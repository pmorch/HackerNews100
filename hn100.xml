</figcaption>  </figure><h2><strong>Why It Matters</strong></h2><p>El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele responded Monday to questions about the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, stating that he lacked the authority to return individuals sent by the U.S. to the Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT).</p><p>This remark came amid growing criticism of the government's handling of due process, opponents accusing the administration of bypassing legal safeguards in its treatment of deportees. Critics argue that Garcia's deportation reflects a broader pattern of disregarding constitutional rights, sparking concerns over the erosion of legal protections in the country's justice system.</p><p>President <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/topic/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donald Trump</a> has pledged to conduct the largest deportation operation in American history as his administration looks to remove millions of undocumented immigrants. The White House has said anyone living in the country unlawfully is considered a "criminal" by the federal government. Since the beginning of Trump's second term, thousands of migrants have been arrested.</p><h2><strong>What To Know</strong></h2><p>Gutiérrez, who fled instability in Venezuela and was pursuing an asylum case in the U.S, was detained in the Bronx by ICE agents conducting a targeted operation.</p><p>According to his father, the agents initially acknowledged he was not the individual they were seeking—but chose to detain him anyway.</p><p>Just days later, Gutiérrez was deported to El Salvador, where he was transferred to a high security prison known for housing members of violent gangs, including the transnational criminal group <em>Tren de Aragua</em>.</p><p>His family and attorneys say he has no criminal record, no gang affiliations, and "not even a tattoo," which authorities often use to profile alleged gang members.</p><p>Wilmer Gutiérrez last spoke to his son on March 16 during a brief call allowed by police. He had spent days searching for information, visiting police stations and courthouses, only to be told there was no record of his son.</p><p>During the call, Merwil Gutiérrez said he was being held in Pennsylvania and expected to be transferred to Texas before returning to Venezuela. That transfer never happened.</p><p>Wilmer Gutiérrez later discovered through a news report that his son had been deported to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. Videos circulating online showed detainees in harsh conditions, their heads shaved and marched to cells.</p><p>"I could have understood if he'd been sent back to Venezuela," he said. "But why to a foreign country he's never even been to?"</p><p>In May 2023, Wilmer Gutiérrez left Venezuela with his son Merwil and nephew Luis, traveling through Colombia and the Darién Gap into Panama. The monthlong journey eventually brought them to Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, where they applied for Temporary Protected Status (TPS) through the CBP One app. While waiting for their immigration appointment, they took temporary jobs and slept near the border to keep their place in line.</p><p>Before leaving Venezuela, Wilmer had lived in Los Teques, near Caracas, working for the state oil company PDVSA and later running a cellphone repair business. However ongoing political instability and a collapsing economy made it increasingly difficult to support his family, including his three children and his mother, who was battling cancer.</p><h2><strong>What People Are Saying</strong></h2><p><strong>William Parra, an immigration attorney from Inmigración Al Día said:</strong> "Merwil was detained for hanging out with friends and was at the wrong place at the wrong time. ICE was not looking for him, nor is there any evidence whatsoever that Merwil was in any gang."</p><p><strong>Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, senior fellow at the American Immigration Council said in a post on X, formerly Twitter</strong>: "19-year-old Merwil Gutierrez was grabbed off the street in New York City days before he was sent to El Salvador. His family insists he has no connection to <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/topic/tren-de-aragua" data-sys="1">Tren de Aragua</a>. He doesn't even have any tattoos."</p><h2><strong>What Happens Next</strong></h2><p>Gutiérrez's legal team is calling for immediate diplomatic intervention to secure his release and safe return.</p>  </div></div>]]></description>

<p>You can’t.</p>



<p>That’s because toddlers don’t understand what an argument is and aren’t interesting in having one.</p>



<p>Toddlers (which includes defensive bureaucrats, bullies, flat earthers, folks committed to a specific agenda and radio talk show hosts) may indicate that they’d like to have an <a href="https://youtu.be/ohDB5gbtaEQ?si=AvfXoVSSSAzU04WW">argument</a>, but they’re actually engaging in connection, noise, play acting or a chance to earn status. It can be fun to be in opposition, to harangue or even to use power to change someone’s position.</p>



<p>An argument, though, is an exchange of ideas that ought to surface insight and lead to a conclusion.</p>



<p>If you’re regularly having arguments with well-informed people of goodwill, you will probably ‘lose’ half of them–changing your mind based on what you’ve learned. <em>If you’re not changing your mind, it’s likely you’re not actually having an argument</em> (or you’re hanging out with the wrong people.) While it can be fun to change someone else’s position, it’s also a gift to learn enough to change ours.</p>



<p>The toddler puts on a show of having an argument, but they are holding a tantrum in reserve. If they ‘win’ the argument, no tantrum is needed. If they lose, they can tell themselves that they tried but the other person deserved the tantrum because they didn’t listen.</p>



<p>“Tell me about other strongly-held positions you’ve changed as the result of a discussion like this one…” is a direct way to start a conversation about the argument you’re proposing to have. “What sort of information would make it likely you could see this in a different way?”</p>



<p>It probably doesn’t pay to argue over things we have chosen to believe as part of our identity.</p>

  <p>On April 2nd, 2025, our president announced major new taxes on imports from foreign countries (“tariffs”), ranging from 10% to 49%. The stated goal is to bring manufacturing back to the United States and to “make America wealthy again”.</p><p>These tariffs will not work. In fact, they may even do the opposite, fail to bring manufacturing back and make America poorer in the process.</p><p>This article gives the 14 reasons why this is the case, how the United States could bring manufacturing back if it were serious about doing so, and what will ultimately happen with this wrongheaded policy</p><p>I’ve been in the manufacturing industry for 15 years. I’ve manufactured in the USA and in China. I worked in a factory in China. I speak and read Chinese. I’ve purchased millions of dollars worth of goods from the US and China, but also Vietnam, Indonesia, Taiwan, and Cambodia. I’ve also visited many factories in Mexico and consider myself a student of how countries rise and fall.</p><p>In other words, unlike many who have voiced an opinion on this topic, I know what I am talking about. And that’s why I felt compelled to write this article. I had to do it. I’m a first generation American and I love my country and it pains me to see it hurtling at high speed towards an economic brick wall. This article is an attempt to hit the brakes.</p><h3>The 14 Reasons Why these Tariffs Will Not Bring Manufacturing Back</h3><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><div><p><strong>They’re not high enough</strong></p><p>A tariff is a tax on an imported product. For example, when Apple imports an iPhone that was made in China it declares to the United States government what it paid to make that product overseas. Let’s say it’s $100. When there is a 54% tariff, Apple pays $100 to the manufacturer in China and $54 to the US government when importing. In this simplified example, an iPhone used to cost Apple $100, but it now costs $154. For every dollar Apple spends, Apple needs to make profit. So Apple sells iPhones to stores for double what it pays for them. And stores sell iPhones to consumers like you and me for double what it pays for them, as well.</p><p><strong>Before the tariffs, prices looked like this:</strong> <br>Apple bought iPhones it designed for $100<br>Apple sold iPhones for $200 to stores<br>Stores sold iPhones to you and me for $400</p><p><strong>After the tariffs, prices look like this:</strong><br>Apple bought iPhones for $154 ($100 + $54 in import taxes)<br>Apple sells those iPhones for $308 (double what it paid)<br>Stores sell those iPhones to you and me for $616 (double what they paid)</p><p>Now that you know what a tariff is, let me tell to you why they aren’t high enough to bring manufacturing back to the United States.</p><p>In short, manufacturing in the United States is so expensive and our supply chain (we’ll explain that next) is so bad that making that iPhone in the United States without that 54% tariff, would still cost more than in China with 54% tariff. Since it still costs less to make the iPhone in China, both Apple and consumers would prefer it be made there, so it will, and not in the USA.</p></div></li><li><div><p><strong>America’s industrial supply chain for many products is weak.</strong></p><p>Think of a supply chain as a company’s ability to get the components it needs to build a finished product. Suppose you wanted to build and sell wooden furniture. You’re going to need wood, nails, glue, etc. Otherwise you can’t do it. If you want to build an iPhone you need to procure a glass screen, shaped metal, and numerous internal electronic components.</p><p>Now you might be thinking, “what do you mean America has a weak supply chain? I’ve built furniture, I’ve assembled a computer. I can get everything I want at Home Depot and at Amazon.”</p><p>That’s because America has an amazing <em>consumer</em> supply chain, one of the best, if not the best in the world, but this is totally different from having an <em>industrial</em> supply chain.</p><p>When you’re operating a furniture factory, you need an industrial quantity of wood, more wood than any Home Depot near you has in store. And you need it fast and cheap. It turns out that the United States has a good supply chain for wood, which is why, despite higher wages, we export chopsticks to China. We have abundant cheap wood in the forests of the Northern United States. But if you decided to move that chopstick factory to desert Saudi Arabia, you would not succeed, because their supply chain for wood is poor; there simply aren’t any trees for 1,000s of miles.</p><p>When it comes to the iPhone, all the factories which make the needed components are in Asia, which is one reason why, even with a 54% tariff, it’s cheaper to assemble that iPhone in China than in the United States. It’s cheaper and faster to get those components from nearby factories in Asia than it is to get them from the US, which, because said factories no longer exist here, has to buy these components from Asia anyways.</p><p>Supply chains sound complicated, but aren’t. If you can’t get the components you need at a reasonable price and timeline to build a finished product, it doesn’t matter what the tariffs are, you have to import it, because you can’t build it locally.</p></div></li><li><div><p><strong>We don’t know how to make it</strong></p><p>Apple knows how to build an iPhone, but may not know how to make the individual components. It may seem trivial to make that glass that separates your finger from the electronic engineering that powers your ability to access the internet, but it’s difficult. </p><p>The world buys semiconductors from Taiwan, not just because its relatively inexpensive (but more expensive than China) labor and excellent supply chain, but because they know how to make the best semiconductors in the world. Even with infinite money, we cannot duplicate that, because we lack the knowhow.</p><p>A 54% tariff does not solve that problem. We still need to buy semiconductors from Taiwan, which is perhaps why the administration put in an exception for semiconductors, because we need them and because we can’t make them without their help.</p><p>This is a problem which applies to more than just semiconductors. We have forgotten how to make products people wrongly consider to be basic, too.</p><p>My company makes educational toys from plastic called Brain Flakes. To make Brain Flakes, you melt plastic and force it into shaped metal molds. Were we to import the machines and molds needed to do this, it would work for a little while, but as soon as one of those molds broke, we’d be in trouble, because there are almost no moldmakers left in the United States. The people who knew how to build and repair molds have either passed away or are long retired. In the event of a problem, we’d have to order a new mold from China or send ours back, shutting down production for months.</p><p>People trivialize the complexity and difficulty of manufacturing when it’s really hard. And if we don’t know how to make something, it doesn’t matter what the tariff is. It won’t get made in America.</p></div></li><li><div><p><strong>The effective cost of labor in the United States is higher than it looks</strong>Most people think that the reason why we make products in China instead of the United States is cheaper labor. That’s true, but it’s not the whole story. Frankly, the whole story is hard to read. People are not machines, they are not numbers on a spreadsheet or inputs into a manufacturing cost formula. I respect everyone who works hard and the people I have worked with over the years, and I want Americans to live better, happier lives.</p><p>Chinese manufacturing labor isn’t just cheaper. It’s better.</p><p>In China, there are no people who are too fat to work. The workers don’t storm off midshift, never to return to their job. You don’t have people who insist on being paid in cash so that they can keep their disability payments, while they do acrobatics on the factory floor that the non-disabled workers cannot do.</p><p>Chinese workers much less likely to physically attack each other and their manager. They don’t take 30 minute bathroom breaks on company time. They don’t often quit because their out-of-state mother of their children discovered their new job and now receives 60% of their wages as child support. They don’t disappear because they’ve gone on meth benders. And they don’t fall asleep on a box midshift because their pay from yesterday got converted into pills.</p><p>And they can do their times tables. To manufacture, you need to be able to consistently and accurately multiply 7 times 9 and read in English, and a disturbingly large portion of the American workforce cannot do that.</p><p>Chinese workers work longer hours more happily and they’re physically faster with their hands; they can do things that American labor can’t. It’s years of accumulated skill, but it’s also a culture that is oriented around hard work and education that the United States no longer has.</p><p>Sadly, what I describe above are not theoretical situations. These are things that I have experienced or seen with my own eyes. It’s fixable, but the American workforce needs great improvement in order to compete with the world’s, even with tariffs.</p><p>So yes, Chinese wages are lower, but there many countries with wages lower than China’s. It’s the work ethic, knowhow, commitment, combined with top notch infrastructure, that makes China the most powerful manufacturing country in the world today.</p></div></li><li><div><p><strong>We don’t have the infrastructure to manufacture</strong></p><p>The inputs to manufacturing are not just materials, labor, and knowhow. You need infrastructure like electricity and good roads for transportation, too.</p><p>Since the year 2000, US electricity generation per person has been flat. In China, over the same time period, it has increased 400%. China generates over twice as much electricity person today as the United States. Why?</p><p>Manufacturing.</p><p>To run the machines which make the products we use, you need electricity, a lot of it. We already have electricity instability in this country. Without the construction of huge amounts of new energy infrastructure, like nuclear power plants, we cannot meaningfully increase our manufacturing output.</p><p>And it would put huge stress on our roads and create lots more dangerous traffic. When we import finished goods from foreign countries, a truck delivers them from the port or the airport to distribution centers, stores, and where we live and work.</p><p>When you start manufacturing, every single component, from factory to factory, needs to be moved, increasing the number of trucks on the road many times.</p><p>Paving more roads, modernizing our seaports, improving our airports, speeding up our train terminals, and building power plants in the costliest nation in the world to build is a huge undertaking that people are not appreciating when they say “well, we’ll just make it in America”.</p></div></li><li><div><p><strong>Made in America will take time.</strong></p><p>We placed a $50,000 order with our supplier overseas before the election in November 2024. At the time of ordering, there were no import taxes on the goods. By the time it arrived, a 20% tariff had been applied and we had a surprise bill for $10,000. It can easily take 180 days for many products to go from order, to on your doorstep and this tariff policy seems not to understand that.</p><p>It takes at least, in the most favorable of jurisdictions, 2 years (if you can get the permits) to build a factory in the United States. I know because I’ve done it. From there, it can take 6 months to a year for it to become efficient. It can take months for products to come off the assembly lines. All this ignores all the infrastructure that will need to be built (new roads, new power plants, etc.) to service the new factory.</p><p>By the time “made in America” has begun, we will be electing a new president.</p></div></li><li><div><p><strong>Uncertainty and complexity around the tariffs</strong>To start manufacturing in the United States, a company needs to make a large investment. They will need to buy new machinery and if no existing building is suitable, they will need to construct a new building. These things cost money, a lot, in fact. And significantly more in the USA, than they do in other countries. In exchange for this risk, there must be some reward. If that reward is uncertain, no one will do it.</p><p>Within the past month, the president put a 25% tariff on Mexico, and then got rid of it, only to apply it again, and then get rid of it a second time. Then, last week, he was expected to apply new tariffs to Mexico, but didn’t.</p><p>If you’re building a new factory in the United States, your investment will alternate between maybe it will work, and catastrophic loss according to which way the tariffs and the wind blows. No one is building factories right now, and no one is renting them, because there is no certainty that any of these tariffs will last. How do I know? I built a factory in Austin, Texas in an industrial area. I cut its rent 40% two weeks ago and I can’t get a lick of interest from industrial renters.</p><p>The tariffs have frozen business activity because no one wants to take a big risk dependent on a policy that may change next week.</p><p>Even further, the tariffs are confusing, poorly communicated, and complex. Today, if you want to import something from China, you need to add the original import duty, plus a 20% “fentanyl tariff”, plus a 34% “reciprocal tariff”, and an additional 25% “Venezuelan oil” tariff, should it be determined that China is buying Venezualan oil. The problem is there is no list of countries which are importing Venezuelan oil provided by the White House, so you don’t know if you do or don’t need to add that 25% and you also don’t know when any of these tariffs will go into effect because of unclear language.</p><p>As such, you can’t calculate your costs, either with certainty or accuracy, therefore, not only do you not build a factory in the United States, you cease all business activity, the type of thing that can cause a recession, if not worse.</p><p>For the past month, as someone who runs a business in this industry, I have spent a huge portion of my time just trying to keep up with the constant changes, instead of running my business. </p></div></li><li><div><p><strong>Most Americans are going to hate manufacturing</strong></p><p>Americans want less crime, good schools for their kids, and inexpensive healthcare.</p><p>They don’t want to be sewing shirts.</p><p>The people most excited about this new tariff policy tend to be those who’ve never actually made anything, because if you have, you’d know how hard the work is.</p><p>When I first went to China as a naive 24 year old, I told my supplier I was going to “work a day in his factory!” I lasted 4 hours. It was freezing cold, middle of winter, I had to crouch on a small stool, hunched over, assembling little parts with my fingers at 1/4 the speed of the women next to me. My back hurt, my fingers hurt. It was horrible. That’s a lot of manufacturing.</p><p>And enjoy the blackouts, the dangerous trucks on the road, the additional pollution, etc. Be careful what you wish for America. Doing office work and selling ideas and assets is a lot easier than making actual things.</p></div></li><li><div><p><strong>The labor does not exist to make good products</strong>There are over a billion people in China making stuff. As of right now there are 12 million people looking for work in the United States (4% unemployment). Ignoring for a moment the comparative inefficiency of labor and the billions of people making products outside of China, where are the people that are going to do these jobs? Do you simply say “make America great again” 3 times and they will appear with the skills needed to do the work?</p><p>And where are the managers to manage these people? One of the reasons why manufacturing has declined in the United States is a brain drain towards sectors that make more money. Are people who make money on the stock market, in real estate, in venture capital, and in startups going to start sewing shirts? It’s completely and totally unrealistic to assume that people will move from superficially high productivity sectors driven by US Dollar strength to products that are low on the value chain.</p><p>The United States is trying to bring back the jobs that China doesn’t even want. They have policies to reduce low value manufacturing, yet we are applying tariffs to bring it back. It’s incomprehensible.</p></div></li><li><div><p><strong>Automation will not save us.</strong>Most people think that the reason why American manufacturing is not competitive is labor costs. Most people think this can be solved by automation.</p><p>They’re wrong.</p><p>First, China, on a yearly basis installs 7x as many industrial robots as we do in the United States. Second, Chinese robots are cheaper. Third, most of today’s manufacturing done by people cannot be automated. If it could, it would have already been done so, by China, which, again, has increasingly high labor costs relative to the rest of the world.</p><p>The robots you see on social media doing backflips are, today, mostly for show and unreliable off camera. They are not useful in industrial environments where, if a humanoid robot can do it, an industrial machine which is specialized in the task can do it even better. For example, instead of having a humanoid robot doing a repetitive task such as carrying a boxes from one station to another, you can simply set up a cheaper, faster conveyor belt.</p><p>Said another way, the printer in your office, is cheaper and more efficient than both a human and a humanoid robot with a pen, hand drawing each letter.</p><p>It’s unlikely that American ingenuity will be able to counter the flood of Chinese industrial robots which is coming. The first commercially electrical vehicle was designed and built in the United States, but today China is dominating electric vehicle manufacturing across the world. Industrial robots will likely be the same story.</p></div></li><li><div><p><strong>Robots and overseas factory workers don’t file lawsuits, but Americans do</strong>I probably should not have written this article. Not only will I be attacked for being unpatriotic, but what I have written here makes me susceptible to employment lawsuits. For the record, I don’t use a person’s origin to determine whether or not they will do good work. I just look at the person and what they’re capable of. Doing otherwise is bad business because there are talented people everywhere.</p><p>America has an extremely litigious business environment, both in terms of regulation and employment lawsuits. Excessive regulation and an inefficient court system will stifle those with the courage to make in this country.</p></div></li><li><div><p><strong>Enforcement of the tariffs will be uneven and manipulated</strong>Imagine two companies which import goods into the United States. One is based in China, while the other is based in the United States. They both lie about the value of their goods so that they have to pay less tariffs. </p><p>What happens to the China company? Perhaps they lose a shipment when it’s seized by the US government for cheating, but they won’t pay additional fines because they’re in China, where they’re impervious to the US legal system.</p><p>What happens to the USA company? Owners go to prison.</p><p>Who do you think is going to cheat more on tariffs, the China or the US company? </p><p>Exactly.</p><p>So, in other words, paradoxically, the policies which are designed to help Americans, will hurt them more than the competition these policies are designed to punish.</p></div></li><li><div><p><strong>The tariff policies are structured in the wrong way</strong>Why didn’t the jobs come back in 2018 when we initiated our last trade war? We applied tariffs, why didn’t it work?</p><p>Instead of making America great, we made Vietnam great.</p><p>When the United States applied tariffs to China, it shifted huge amounts of manufacturing to Vietnam, which did not have tariffs applied to it. Vietnam, which has a labor force that is a lot more like China’s than the United States’, was able to use its proximity to China for its supply chain and over the past 7 or so years, slowly developed its own. With Vietnamese wages even lower than Chinese wages, instead of the jobs coming to the United States, they just went to Vietnam instead.</p><p>We’re about to make the same mistake again, in a different way.</p><p>Let’s go back to that last example, the China based and the US based companies which were importing goods into the United States. That US based importer could’ve been a manufacturer. Instead of finished iPhones, perhaps they were importing the glass screens because those could not be found in the USA, for final assembly.</p><p>Our government applied tariffs to finished goods and components equally.</p><p>I’ll say that again. They applied the same tax to the components that you need to make things in America that they did to finished goods that were made outside of America.</p><p>Manufacturing works on a lag. To make and sell in America, first you must get the raw materials and components. These tariffs will bankrupt manufacturers before it multiplies them because they need to pay tariffs on the import components that they assemble into finished products.</p><p>And it gets worse.</p><p>They put tariffs on machines. So if you want to start a factory in the United States, all the machinery you need which is not made here, is now significantly more expensive. You may have heard that there is a chronic shortage of transformers needed for power transmission in the United States. Tariffed that too.</p><p>It gets even worse.</p><p>There is no duty drawback for exporting. In the past, even in the United States, if you imported something and then exported it, the tariff you paid on the import would be refunded to you. They got rid of that so we’re not even incentivizing exports to the countries that we are trying to achieve trade parity with.</p><p>Tariffs are applied to the costs of the goods. The way we’ve structured these tariffs, factories in China which import into the United States will pay lower tariffs than American importers, because the Chinese factory will be able to declare the value of the goods at their cost, while the American importer will pay the cost the factory charges them, which is of course higher than the factory’s cost.</p><p>Worse still.</p><p>With a few exceptions like steel and semiconductors, the tariffs were applied to all products, ranging from things that we will never realistically make like our high labor <a href="https://tigerharttoys.com/" target="_blank">Tigerhart stuffed animals</a> to things that don’t even grow in the continental USA, like coffee.</p><p>Call me crazy, but if we’re going to make products in America, we could use some really cheap coffee, but no, they tariffed it! Our educational <a href="https://brainflakes.com/" target="_blank">engineering toy Brain Flakes</a>, also got tariffed. How is the next generation supposed to build a manufacturing powerhouse if it cannot afford products that will develop its engineering ability? It’s like our goal was to make education and raising children more expensive.</p><p>Not only did we put tariffs on the things that would help us make this transformation, we didn’t put higher tariffs on things that hurt us like processed food which makes us tired and fat or fentanyl precursors which kill us.</p><p>The stated goal of many of our tariffs was to stop the import of fentanyl. 2 milligrams of fentanyl will kill an adult. A grain of rice is 65 milligrams. How do you stop that stuff from coming in? It’s basically microscopic.</p><p>Maybe we could do what every other country has done and focus on the demand, instead of the supply, ideally starting with the fentanyl den near my house which keeps my children indoors or in our backyard instead of playing in the neighborhood.</p><p>It’s frustrating to see our great country take on an unrealistic goal like transforming our economy, when so many basic problems should be fixed first.</p></div></li><li><div><p><strong>Michael Jordan sucked at baseball</strong></p><p>America is the greatest economic power of all time. We’ve got the most talented people in the world and we have a multi-century legacy of achieving what so many other countries could not.</p><p>Michael Jordan is arguably the greatest basketball player of all time, perhaps even the greatest athlete of all time.</p><p>He played baseball in his youth. What happened when he switched from basketball to baseball? He went from being an MVP champion to being a middling player in the minor leagues. 2 years later, he was back to playing basketball.</p><p>And that’s exactly what’s going to happen to us.</p></div></li></ol><h3>My prediction for what will happen with the tariffs</h3><div><p>This is probably the worst economic policy I’ve ever seen. Maybe it’s just an opening negotiating position. Maybe it’s designed to crash the economy, lower interest rates, and then refinance the debt. I don’t know.</p><p>But if you take it at face value, there is no way that this policy will bring manufacturing back to the United States and “make America wealthy again”. Again, if anything, it’ll do the opposite; it’ll make us much poorer.</p><p>Many are saying that this tariff policy is the “end of globalization”. I don’t think so.</p><p>Unless this policy is quickly changed, this is the end of America’s participation in globalization. If we had enacted these policies in 2017 or 2018, they stood a much stronger chance of being successful. That was before Covid. China was much weaker economically and militarily then. They’ve been preparing 8 years for this moment and they are ready.</p><p>China trades much less with the United States as a percent of its total exports today than it did 8 years ago, and as such is much less susceptible to punishing tariffs from the United States today than it was back then.</p><p>Chinese made cars, particularly electric vehicles, are taking the world by storm, without the United States. Go to Mexico to Thailand to Germany and you will see Chinese made electric vehicles on the streets. And they’re good, sometimes even better than US made cars, and not just on a per dollar basis, but simply better quality.</p><p>That is what is going to happen to the United States. Globalization will continue without us if these policies continue unchanged.</p><p>That said, I think the tariffs will be changed. There’s no way we continue to place a 46% tariff on Vietnam when 8 years ago we nudged American companies to put all their production there.  Most likely, this policy will continue another round of the same type of investment; rather than replacing made in China with made in the USA, we’ll replace it with made in Vietnam, Mexico, etc.</p><p>Finally, in the process of doing this, regardless of whether or not we reverse the policies, we will have a recession. There isn’t time to build US factories, nor is it realistic or likely to occur, and American importers don’t have the money to pay for the goods they import.</p><p>People are predicting inflation in the cost of goods, but we can just as easily have deflation from economic turmoil.</p><p>The policy is a disaster, how could it be done better? And what’s the point of this anyways?</p></div><h3>The 3 reasons why we want to actually bring manufacturing back</h3><p><br>1. It makes our country stronger. If a foreign country can cut off your supply of essentials such as food, semiconductors, or antibiotics you’re beholden to that country. The United States must have large flexible capacity in these areas.</p><p>2. It makes it easier to innovate. When the factory floor is down the hall, instead of 30 hours of travel away, it’s easier to make improvements and invent. We need to have manufacturing of high value goods, like drones, robots, and military equipment that are necessary for our economic future and safety. It will be difficult for us to apply artificial intelligence to manufacturing if we’re not doing it here.</p><p>3. People can simplistically be divided into three buckets: those of verbal intelligence, those of mathematical intelligence, and those of spatial intelligence. Without a vibrant manufacturing industry, those with the latter type of intelligence cannot fulfill their potential. This is one reason why so many men drop out, smoke weed, and play video games; they aren’t built for office jobs and would excel at manufacturing, but those jobs either don’t exist or pay poorly.</p><h3>How to actually bring manufacturing back</h3><div><p>Every country that has gone on a brilliant run of manufacturing first established the right conditions and then proceeded slowly.</p><p>We’re doing the opposite right now, proceeding fast with the wrong conditions.</p><p>First, the United States must fix basic problems which reduce the effectiveness of our labor. For example, everyone needs to be able to graduate with the ability to do basic mathematics. American healthcare is way too expensive and it needs to be fixed if the United States wants to be competitive with global labor. I’m not saying healthcare should be socialized or switched to a completely private system, but whatever we’re doing now clearly is not working, and it needs to be fixed.</p><p>We need to make Americans healthy again. Many people are too obese to work. Crime and drugs. It needs to stop.</p><p>And to sew, we must first repair the social fabric.</p><p>From Covid lockdowns to the millions of people who streamed over our border, efforts must be made to repair society. Manufacturing and economic transformations are hard, particularly the way in which we’re doing it. Patriotism and unity are required to tolerate hardship, and we seem to be at all-time lows for those right now.</p><p>Let’s focus on America’s strengths in high end manufacturing, agriculture, and innovation instead of applying tariffs to all countries and products blindly. We should be taxing automated drones for agriculture at 300% to encourage their manufacture here, instead of applying the same blanket tariff of 54% to that that we apply to t-shirts.</p><p>The changes in the policies needed are obvious. Tax finished products higher than components. Let exporters refund their import duties. Enforce the tariffs against foreign companies more strenuously than we do against US importers.</p><p>If American companies want to sell in China, they must incorporate there, register capital, and name a person to be a legal representative. To sell in Europe, we must register for their tax system and nominate a legal representative. For Europeans and Chinese to sell in the United States, none of this is needed, nor do federal taxes need to be paid.</p><p>We can level the playing field without causing massive harm to our economy by adopting policies like these which cause foreign companies to pay the taxes domestic ones pay.</p><p>And if we want to apply tariffs, do it slowly. Instead of saying that products will be tariffed at 100% tomorrow, say they’ll be 25% next year, 50% after that, 75% after that, and 100% in year four. And then make it a law instead of a presidential decree so that there is certainty so people feel comfortable taking the risks necessary to make in America.</p></div><p>Sadly, a lot of the knowhow to make products is outside of this country. Grant manufacturing visas, not for labor, but for knowhow. Make it easy for foreign countries to teach us how they do waht they do best.</p><h3>Conclusion and final thoughts</h3><p>I care about this country and the people in it. I hope we change our mind on this policy before it’s too late. Because if we don’t, it might break the country. And, really, this country needs to be fixed.</p>

                The DOGE team may have taken data related to union organizing and labor complaints and hid its tracks, according to a whistleblower.

   <p>In the first days of March, a team of advisers from President Trump's new Department of Government Efficiency initiative arrived at the Southeast Washington, D.C., headquarters of the National Labor Relations Board.</p>   <p>The small, independent federal agency investigates and adjudicates complaints about unfair labor practices. It stores reams of potentially sensitive data, from confidential information about employees who want to form unions to proprietary business information.</p>   <p>The DOGE employees, who are effectively led by White House adviser and billionaire tech CEO Elon Musk, appeared to have their sights set on accessing the NLRB's internal systems. They've said their unit's overall mission is to review agency data for compliance with the new administration's policies and to cut costs and maximize efficiency.</p>   
   <p>But according to an official whistleblower disclosure shared with Congress and other federal overseers that was obtained by NPR, subsequent interviews with the whistleblower and records of internal communications, technical staff members were alarmed about what DOGE engineers did when they were granted access, particularly when those staffers noticed a spike in data leaving the agency. It's possible that the data included sensitive information on unions, ongoing legal cases and corporate secrets — data that four labor law experts tell NPR should almost never leave the NLRB and that has nothing to do with making the government more efficient or cutting spending.</p>

   <p>Meanwhile, according to the disclosure and records of internal communications, members of the DOGE team asked that their activities not be logged on the system and then appeared to try to cover their tracks behind them, turning off monitoring tools and manually deleting records of their access — evasive behavior that several cybersecurity experts interviewed by NPR compared to what criminal or state-sponsored hackers might do.</p>   <div id="resg-s1-59679">

   <p>The employees grew concerned that the NLRB's confidential data could be exposed, particularly after they started detecting suspicious log-in attempts from an IP address in Russia, according to the disclosure. Eventually, the disclosure continued, the IT department launched a formal review of what it deemed a serious, ongoing security breach or potentially illegal removal of personally identifiable information. The whistleblower believes that the suspicious activity warrants further investigation by agencies with more resources, like the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency or the FBI.</p>   
   <p>The labor law experts interviewed by NPR fear that if the data gets out, it could be abused, including by private companies with cases before the agency that might get insights into damaging testimony, union leadership, legal strategies and internal data on competitors — Musk's SpaceX among them. It could also intimidate whistleblowers who might speak up about unfair labor practices, and it could sow distrust in the NLRB's independence, they said.</p>

   <p>The new revelations about DOGE's activities at the labor agency come from a whistleblower in the IT department of the NLRB, who disclosed his concerns to Congress and the U.S. Office of Special Counsel in a detailed report that was then provided to NPR. Meanwhile, his attempts to raise concerns internally within the NLRB preceded someone "physically taping a threatening note" to his door that included sensitive personal information and overhead photos of him walking his dog that appeared to be taken with a drone, according to a cover letter attached to his disclosure filed by his attorney, Andrew Bakaj of the nonprofit Whistleblower Aid.</p>   <p>The whistleblower's account is corroborated by internal documentation and was reviewed by 11 technical experts across other government agencies and the private sector. In total, NPR spoke to over 30 sources across the government, the private sector, the labor movement, cybersecurity and law enforcement who spoke to their own concerns about how DOGE and the Trump administration might be handling sensitive data, and the implications for its exposure. Much of the following account comes from the whistleblower's official disclosure and interviews with NPR.</p>   <p>"I can't attest to what their end goal was or what they're doing with the data," said the whistleblower, Daniel Berulis, in an interview with NPR. "But I can tell you that the bits of the puzzle that I can quantify are scary. ... This is a very bad picture we're looking at."</p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RESNX-S1-5355896-102" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>The whistleblower's story sheds further light on how DOGE is operating inside federal systems and comes on the heels of <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/03/26/nx-s1-5339842/doge-data-access-privacy-act-social-security-treasury-opm-lawsuit" target="_blank">testimony in more than a dozen court cases</a> across the United States that reveal how DOGE rapidly gained access to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/03/11/nx-s1-5305054/doge-elon-musk-security-data-information-privacy" target="_blank">private financial and personal information on hundreds of millions of Americans</a>. It's unclear how or whether DOGE is protecting the privacy of that data. Meanwhile, the threatening note, though its origins are unknown, is reflective of the current climate of fear and intimidation toward whistleblowers.</p>

   <p>Tim Bearese, the NLRB's acting press secretary, denied that the agency granted DOGE access to its systems and said DOGE had not requested access to the agency's systems. Bearese said the agency conducted an investigation after Berulis raised his concerns but "determined that no breach of agency systems occurred."</p>   <p>Notwithstanding the NLRB's denial, the whistleblower's disclosure to Congress and other federal overseers includes forensic data and records of conversations with colleagues that provide evidence of DOGE's access and activities. Meanwhile, NPR's extensive reporting makes clear that DOGE's access to data is a widespread concern. Across the government, 11 sources directly familiar with internal operations in federal agencies and in Congress told NPR that they share Berulis' concerns, and some have seen other evidence that DOGE is exfiltrating sensitive data for unknown reasons.</p>   
   <p>A representative of DOGE did not respond to NPR's requests for comment.<br></p>   <h3>Taking apart computers to protecting government data</h3>   <p>Instead of a brand-new car for a 16th-birthday present, Berulis got his first computer.</p>   <p>It's a familiar story for tech nerds the world over: He methodically took the machine apart "to figure out how it works," just like he had dissected radios from the thrift store years earlier. "I electrocuted myself once," he recalled.</p>   <p>Berulis was always interested in public service, but the traditional paths didn't suit him.</p>

   <p>While he didn't know much about the agency, Berulis<strong> </strong>quickly found its mission to protect employees' rights in line with his long-standing desire "to help people."</p>   <p>He started about six months before President Trump was inaugurated for his second term this past January. Berulis said he hit the ground running, securing the NLRB's cloud-based data servers and reinforcing what's called "zero trust" principles, which means that users can get access only to the parts of the system they need in order to do their jobs — no more, no less. That way, if an attacker gets hold of a single username and password, the attacker can't access the whole system.</p>   <p>"When I first started, it was a dream come true," he said. "There was a great opportunity to build up and do some good." But after the inauguration, he described a "culture of fear" descending over the agency.<br></p>   
   <h3>DOGE arrives&nbsp;</h3>   <p>The first week of March, engineers associated with DOGE arrived at the NLRB's headquarters, according to Berulis' disclosure. Beforehand, they had asked about what software, hardware, programming languages and applications the NLRB was using. DOGE learned that it used commercially available cloud infrastructure that businesses typically use, which connects to government cloud systems at other agencies and can be accessed remotely.</p>   <p>Berulis said he and several colleagues saw a black SUV and police escort enter the garage, after which building security let the DOGE staffers in. They interacted with a small number of staffers, never introducing themselves to most of the IT team.</p>   <p>Berulis says he was told by colleagues that DOGE employees demanded the highest level of access, what are called "tenant owner level" accounts inside the independent agency's computer systems, with essentially unrestricted permission to read, copy and alter data, according to Berulis' disclosure.</p>   <p>When an IT staffer suggested a streamlined process to activate those accounts in a way that would let their activities be tracked, in accordance with NLRB security policies, the IT staffers were told to stay out of DOGE's way, the disclosure continues.</p>   <p>For cybersecurity professionals, a failure to log activity is a cardinal sin and contradicts best practices as recommended by the <a href="https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework" target="_blank">National Institute of Standards and Technology</a> and the Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, as well as the FBI and the National Security Agency.</p>   <p>"That was a huge red flag," said Berulis. "That's something that you just don't do. It violates every core concept of security and best practice."</p>   <div data-crop-type="" id="resg-s1-59634">

   <p>Those forensic digital records are important for record-keeping requirements and they allow for troubleshooting, but they also allow experts to investigate potential breaches, sometimes even tracing the attacker's path back to the vulnerability that let them inside a network. The records can also help experts see what data might have been removed. Basic logs would likely not be enough to demonstrate the extent of a bad actor's activities, but it would be a start. There's no reason for any legitimate user to turn off logging or other security tools, cybersecurity experts say.</p>   
   <p>"None of this is normal," said Jake Braun, the executive director of the Cyber Policy Initiative at the University of Chicago's Harris School of Public Policy and former acting principal deputy national cyber director at the White House, in an interview with NPR about the whistleblower's disclosure. "This type of activity is why the government buys insider-threat-monitoring technology. So we can know things like this are happening and stop sensitive data exfiltration before it happens," he told NPR.</p>   <p>However, the NLRB's budget hasn't had the money to pay for tools like that for years, Berulis said.<br></p>   <h3>A backdoor to government systems?</h3>   <p>A couple of days after DOGE arrived, Berulis saw something else that alarmed him while browsing the internet over the weekend.</p>   <p>Massachusetts Institute of Technology graduate and DOGE engineer Jordan Wick had been sharing information about coding projects he was working on to his public account with GitHub, a website that allows developers to create, store and collaborate on code.</p>   <p>After journalist Roger Sollenberger started <a href="https://x.com/SollenbergerRC/status/1895609294810464390" target="_blank">posting on X</a> about the account, Berulis noticed something Wick was working on: a project, or repository, titled "NxGenBdoorExtract."</p>   <p>Wick made it private before Berulis could investigate further, he told NPR. But to Berulis, the title itself was revealing.</p>   <p>"So when I saw this tool, I immediately panicked, just for lack of a better term," he said. "I kind of had a conniption and said, 'Whoa, whoa, whoa.'" He immediately alerted his whole team.</p>   <p>While NPR was unable to recover the code for that project, the name itself suggests that Wick could have been designing a backdoor, or "Bdoor," to extract files from the NLRB's internal case management system, known as NxGen, according to several cybersecurity experts who reviewed Berulis' conclusions.</p>   <p>Wick did not respond to NPR's requests for comment.</p>   <div id="resg-s1-60224">

   <p>"It definitely seems rather odd to name it that," said one of the engineers who built NxGen and asked for anonymity so as not to jeopardize their ability to work with the government again. "Or brazen, if you're not worried about consequences."</p>   
   <p>"The whole idea of removing logging and [getting] tenant-level access is the most disturbing part to me," the engineer said.</p>   <p>NxGen is an <a href="https://www.governmentattic.org/57docs/NLRBnxGenCMSreplace2024-2025.pdf" target="_blank">internal system</a> that was designed specifically for the NLRB in-house, according to several of the engineers who created the tool and who all spoke to NPR on condition of anonymity to avoid retaliation or adverse consequences for any future government work.</p>   <p>The engineers explained that while many of the NLRB's records are eventually made public, the NxGen case management system hosts proprietary data from corporate competitors, personal information about union members or employees voting to join a union, and witness testimony in ongoing cases. Access to that data is protected by numerous federal laws, including the Privacy Act.</p>   <p>Those engineers were also concerned by DOGE staffers' insistence that their activities not be logged, allowing them to probe the NLRB's systems and discover information about potential security flaws or vulnerabilities without being detected.</p>   <p>"If he didn't know the backstory, any [chief information security officer] worth his salt would look at network activity like this and assume it's a nation-state attack from China or Russia," said Braun, the former White House cyber official.<br></p>   <h3>Putting the puzzle pieces together</h3>   <p>About a week after arriving, the DOGE engineers had left the NLRB and deleted their accounts, according to Berulis' disclosure to Congress.</p>   <p>In the office, Berulis had had limited visibility into what the DOGE team was up to in real time.</p>   <p>That's partly because, he said, the NLRB isn't advanced when it comes to detecting insider threats or potentially malicious actors inside the agency itself. "We as an agency have not evolved to account for those," he explained. "We were looking for [bad actors] outside," he said.</p>   <p>But he counted on DOGE leaving at least a few traces of its activity behind, puzzle pieces he could assemble to try to put together a picture of what happened — details he included in his official disclosure.</p>   
   <p>First, at least one DOGE account was created and later deleted for use in the NLRB's cloud systems, hosted by Microsoft: "<a href="mailto:DogeSA_2d5c3e0446f9@nlrb.microsoft.com" target="_blank">DogeSA_2d5c3e0446f9@nlrb.microsoft.com</a>."</p>   <p>Then, DOGE engineers installed what's called a "container," a kind of opaque virtual computer that can run programs on a machine without revealing its activities to the rest of the network. On its own, that wouldn't be suspicious, though it did allow the engineers to work invisibly and left no trace of its activities once it was removed.</p>   <p>Then, Berulis started tracking sensitive data leaving the places it's meant to live, according to his official disclosure. First, he saw a chunk of data exiting the NxGen case management system's "nucleus," inside the NLRB system, Berulis explained. Then, he saw a large spike in outbound traffic leaving the network itself.</p>   <div id="resg-s1-60219">

   <p>From what he could see, the data leaving, almost all text files, added up to around 10 gigabytes — or the equivalent of a full stack of encyclopedias if someone printed them, he explained. It's a sizable chunk of the total data in the NLRB system, though the agency itself hosts over 10 terabytes in historical data. It's unclear which files were copied and removed or whether they were consolidated and compressed, which could mean even more data was exfiltrated. It's also possible that DOGE ran queries looking for specific files in the NLRB's system and took only what it was looking for, according to the disclosure.</p>   <p data-pym-loader="" data-child-src="https://apps.npr.org/dailygraphics/graphics/doge-nlrb-diagrams-20250404/container.html" id="responsive-embed-doge-nlrb-diagrams-20250404-container"> Loading... </p>

   <p>Regardless, that kind of spike is extremely unusual, Berulis explained, because data almost never directly leaves from the NLRB's databases. In his disclosure, Berulis shared a screenshot tracking data entering and exiting the system, and there's only one noticeable spike of data going out. He also confirmed that no one at the NLRB had been saving backup files that week or migrating data for any projects.</p>   <p>Even when external parties like lawyers or overseers like the inspector general are granted guest accounts on the system, it's only to view the files relevant to their case or investigation, explained labor law experts who worked with or at the NLRB, in interviews with NPR.</p>   <p>"None of that confidential and deliberative information should ever leave the agency," said Richard Griffin, who was the NLRB general counsel from 2013 to 2017, in an interview with NPR.<br></p>   <h3>"We are under assault right now"</h3>   <p>For cybersecurity experts, that spike in data leaving the system is a key indicator of a breach, Berulis explained.</p>   
   <p>"We are under assault right now," he remembered thinking.</p>   <p>When Berulis asked his IT colleagues whether they knew why the data was exfiltrated or whether anyone else had been using containers to run code on the system in recent weeks, no one knew anything about it or the other unusual activities on the network, according to his disclosure. In fact, when they looked into the spike, they found that logs that were used to monitor outbound traffic from the system were absent. Some actions taken on the network, including data exfiltration, had no attribution — except to a "deleted account," he continued. "Nobody knows who deleted the logs or how they could have gone missing," Berulis<strong> </strong>said.</p>   <p>The IT team met to discuss insider threats — namely, the DOGE engineers, whose activities it had little insight into or control over. "We had no idea what they did," he explained. Those conversations are reflected in his official disclosure.</p>   <p>They eventually launched a formal breach investigation, according to the disclosure, and prepared a request for assistance from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). However, those efforts were disrupted without an explanation, Berulis said. That was deeply troubling to Berulis, who felt he needed help to try to get to the bottom of what happened and determine what new vulnerabilities might be exploited as a result.</p>   <p>In the days after Berulis and his colleagues prepared a request for CISA's help investigating the breach, Berulis found a printed letter in an envelope taped to his door, which included threatening language, sensitive personal information and overhead pictures of him walking his dog, according to the cover letter attached to his official disclosure. It's unclear who sent it, but the letter made specific reference to his decision to report the breach. Law enforcement is investigating the letter.</p>   
   <p>"If the underlying disclosure wasn't concerning enough, the targeted, physical intimidation and surveillance of my client is. If this is happening to Mr. Berulis, it is likely happening to others and brings our nation more in line with authoritarian regimes than with open and free democracies," wrote Bakaj, his attorney, in a statement sent to NPR. "It is time for everyone – and Congress in particular – to acknowledge the facts and stop our democracy, freedom, and liberties from slipping away, something that will take generations to repair."</p>   <p>In part because of the stymied internal investigation and the attempts to silence him, Berulis decided to come forward publicly.</p>   <p>In fact, despite all that, Berulis managed to uncover some stranger and more troubling details about what happened while DOGE was logged on, which he enumerated in his official declaration.</p>   <p>Unknown users also gave themselves a high-level access key, what's called a SAS token, meaning "shared access signature," to access storage accounts, before deleting it. Berulis said there was no way to track what they did with it.</p>   <p>Someone had disabled controls that would prevent insecure or unauthorized mobile devices from logging on to the system without the proper security settings. There was an interface exposed to the public internet, potentially allowing malicious actors access to the NLRB's systems. Internal alerting and monitoring systems were found to be manually turned off. Multifactor authentication was disabled. And Berulis noticed that an unknown user had exported a "user roster," a file with contact information for outside lawyers who have worked with the NLRB.</p>   <p>Berulis said he noticed five PowerShell downloads on the system, a task automation program that would allow engineers to run automated commands. There were several code libraries that got his attention — tools that he said appeared to be designed to automate and mask data exfiltration. There was a tool to generate a seemingly endless number of IP addresses called "requests-ip-rotator," and a commonly used automation tool for web developers called "browserless" — both repositories starred or favorited by Wick, the DOGE engineer, according to an archive of his GitHub account reviewed by NPR.</p>   
   <p>While investigating the data taken from the agency, Berulis tried to determine its ultimate destination. But whoever had exfiltrated it had disguised its destination too, according to the disclosure.</p>   <p>DOGE staffers had permission to access the system, but removing data is another matter.</p>   <p>Berulis says someone appeared to be doing something called DNS tunneling to prevent the data exfiltration from being detected. He came to that conclusion, outlined in his disclosure, after he saw a traffic spike in DNS requests parallel to the data being exfiltrated, a spike 1,000 times the normal number of requests.</p>   <p>When someone uses this kind of technique, they set up a domain name that pings the target system with questions or queries. But they configure the compromised server so that it answers those DNS queries by sending out packets of data, allowing the attacker to steal information that has been broken down into smaller chunks.</p>   <p>"We've seen Russian threat actors do things like this on U.S. government systems," said one threat intelligence researcher who requested anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak publicly by their employer. That analyst, who has extensive experience hunting nation-state-sponsored hackers, reviewed the whistleblower's technical claims.</p>   <p>"The difference is, they were given the keys to the front door," the researcher continued. While the researcher clarified that it would be difficult to fully verify what happened without full access to the NLRB system, they said Berulis' conclusions and accompanying evidence were a cause for concern. "None of this is standard," they said.</p>   <p>Russ Handorf, who served in the FBI for a decade in various cybersecurity roles, also reviewed Berulis' extensive technical forensic records and analysis and spoke to NPR about his conclusions.</p>   <p>"All of this is alarming," he said. "If this was a publicly traded company, I would have to report this [breach] to the Securities and Exchange Commission. The timeline of events demonstrates a lack of respect for the institution and for the sensitivity of the data that was exfiltrated. There is no reason to increase the security risk profile by disabling security controls and exposing them, less guarded, to the internet. They didn't exercise the more prudent standard practice of copying the data to encrypted and local media for escort."</p>   <p>"Until there's an investigation done, there's no way to definitively prove who did it," Handorf concluded.<br></p>   <h3>"No reason whatsoever for accessing the information"</h3>   <div id="resg-s1-60227">

   <p>DOGE's intentions with regard to the NLRB data remain unclear. Many of the systems that DOGE embedded itself in across the rest of the government <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/03/08/nx-s1-5321323/trump-doge-gsa-federal-buildings" target="_blank">have payment or employment data</a>, information that it could use to evaluate which grants and programs to halt and whom to fire.</p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RESNX-S1-5355896-106" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>But the case management system is very different.</p>   <p>It houses information about ongoing contested labor cases, lists of union activists, internal case notes, personal information from Social Security numbers to home addresses, proprietary corporate data and more information that never gets published openly.</p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RESNX-S1-5355896-107" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>Experts interviewed by NPR acknowledge that there are inefficiencies across government that warrant further review, but they say they don't see a single legitimate reason that DOGE staffers would need to remove the data from the case management system to resolve those problems.</p>   <p>"There is no reason whatsoever for accessing the information. Now, could any agency be more efficient? More effective? Positively. But what you need for that is people who understand what the agency does. That is not by mining data, putting algorithms in and creating a breach of security," said Harley Shaiken, a professor emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley who specializes in labor and information technology.</p>   <p>"There is nothing that I can see about what DOGE is doing that follows any of the standard procedures for how you do an audit that has integrity and that's meaningful and will actually produce results that serve the normal auditing function, which is to look for fraud, waste and abuse," said Sharon Block, the executive director of Harvard Law School's Center for Labor and a Just Economy and a former NLRB board member.</p>   <p>"The mismatch between what they're doing and the established, professional way to do what they say they're doing ... that just kind of gives away the store, that they are not actually about finding more efficient ways for the government to operate," Block said.</p>   <p>For labor law experts, the mere possibility that sensitive records were copied is a serious danger that could create a chilling effect for employees everywhere who turn to the National Labor Relations Board for protection.</p>   <p>"Just saying that they have access to the data is intimidating," said Kate Bronfenbrenner, the director of labor education research at Cornell University and co-director of the Worker Empowerment Research Network. "People are going to go, 'I'm not going to testify before the board because, you know, my employer might get access.'"</p>   <p>Bronfenbrenner, the child of immigrant parents who fled the Soviet Union and Nazi-controlled Germany, said she spends a lot of time thinking about how systems can crumble under the right circumstances. "You know, there's this belief that we have these checks and balances … but anyone who's part of the labor movement should know that's not true," she told NPR.</p>   <p>With access to the data, it would make it easier for companies to fire employees for union organizing or keep blacklists of organizers — illegal activities under federal labor laws enforced by the NLRB. But "people get fired in this country all the time for the lawful act of trying to organize a union," said Block.</p>   <p>Having a copy of the opposing counsel's notes as companies prepare for legal challenges would also be an attractive possibility, she continued.</p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RESNX-S1-5355896-108" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>It's not just employees who might suffer if this data got out. Companies also sometimes provide detailed statements on internal business planning and corporate structure in the midst of unfair-labor-practice complaint proceedings. If a company was attempting to fire someone who it alleged had disclosed trade secrets and was fighting an unfair-labor-practice complaint based around that decision, those trade secrets might come up in the board's investigation too. That information would be valuable to competitors, regulators and others.</p>   <p>Overall, the potential exposure of the NLRB's data could have serious implications.</p>   <p>"I think it is very concerning," said Shaiken. "It could result in damage to individual workers, to union-organizing campaigns and to unions themselves," he said.</p>   <p>"It is bringing a wrecking ball into the dentist office, meaning this is wildly disproportionate and raises real dangers," Shaiken continued.<br></p>   <h3>A conflict of interest and the dangers of exposure</h3>   <p>Labor law experts were particularly concerned about what they described as clear conflicts of interest, particularly when it comes to Elon Musk, his companies and his vast network of former employees and allies who are now getting access to government jobs and data.</p>

   <p>Trump and Musk, during an interview with Fox News's Sean Hannity, said Musk would recuse himself from anything involving his companies. "I haven't asked the president for anything ever," <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/remarks/2025/02/interview-of-president-trump-and-elon-musk-by-sean-hannity-the-sean-hannity-show/" target="_blank">Musk said</a>. "I'm getting a sort of a daily proctology exam here. You know, it's not like I'll be getting away [with] something in the dead of night." However, DOGE has been granted high-level access to a lot of data that could benefit Musk, and there has been no evidence of a firewall preventing misuse of that data.</p>

   <p>Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn. <a href="https://www.murphy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/murphy-presses-labor-secretary-nominee-on-protecting-sensitive-data-and-the-nlrb-from-elon-musk" target="_blank">raised his concerns </a>about Musk accessing sensitive labor investigation data on cases against his companies or competitors during the confirmation hearing for Trump's labor secretary, Lori Chavez-DeRemer, in mid-February. He pressed her to answer whether she believed the NLRB is constitutional and to commit to keeping sensitive data confidential. While she said she was committed to "privacy" and said she respects the NLRB's "authority," she insisted that Trump "has the executive power to exercise it as he sees fit."</p>   <p>All this is happening in the context of a broader attempt by the White House to hamstring labor agencies.</p>   <p>The NLRB was created "to guarantee workers' rights to organize and to address problems that workers have in the workplace," said Shaiken, of UC Berkeley. Under President Joe Biden, he recalled, the labor movement enjoyed an unusual amount of support from Washington. "But what we have seen is a sharp slamming of the brakes to that and putting the vehicle in reverse in terms of what Trump has done so far," he continued.</p>   <p>In addition to sending DOGE to the NLRB, the Trump administration tried to neutralize the board's power to enforce labor law by removing its member Gwynne Wilcox. Courts have gone <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kyledcheney.bsky.social/post/3lm7wvvih4c27" target="_blank">back and forth</a> on whether Wilcox's removal was illegal, as presidents are meant to demonstrate cause for dismissal of independent board members.</p>   <p>Representatives of DOGE and former colleagues of Musk's who have been installed across the federal government have failed to reassure the public or the courts that they have taken the proper precautions to protect the data they're ingesting and that private business interests won't influence how that data is used or what policy decisions are made, Block and the other labor law experts interviewed by NPR say.</p>   <p>"It's not that he's a random person who's getting information that a random person shouldn't have access to," said Harvard Law's Block. "But if they really did get everything, then he has information about the cases the government is building against him," she said.</p>   <p>"DOGE is, whether they admit it or not, headed by somebody who is the subject of active investigation and prosecution of cases. It is incredibly troubling," she said.</p>   <p>Musk's company xAI could also benefit from sucking up all the data DOGE has collected to train its algorithms. Cybersecurity experts like Bruce Schneier, a well-known cryptographer and adjunct lecturer at the Harvard Kennedy School, have <a href="https://www.hks.harvard.edu/faculty-research/policy-topics/science-technology-data/doge-putting-countrys-data-and-computing" target="_blank">pointed to this concern</a> at length in interviews and written pieces.</p>   <p>According to two federal government sources who were not authorized to speak publicly about their workplaces and who shared email documentation with NPR, managers have consistently been warning employees that their data could be subject to AI review, particularly their email responses to the Musk-led campaign to get federal employees to detail "what they did last week" in five bullet points every Monday.</p>   <p>"It's not a flight of imagination to see several DOGE staffers release some of that [data] surreptitiously to Musk or people close to him," said Shaiken.<br></p>   <h3>Access for adversaries</h3>   <div data-crop-type="" id="resg-s1-59635">

   <p>If the data isn't properly protected after it leaves the agency or if DOGE left a digital door open to the agency itself, data could also be exposed to potential sale or theft by criminals or foreign adversaries. An attacker could also try to take advantage of the connections between the NLRB's cloud account and other government cloud environments, using their access to the NLRB as a foothold to move to other networks.</p>   <p>"Both criminals and foreign adversaries traditionally have used information like this to enrich themselves through a variety of actions," explained Handorf, the former FBI cyber official. "That includes blackmail, targeting and prioritizing intellectual property theft for espionage or even harming a company to enrich another."</p>   <p>Within minutes after DOGE accessed the NLRB's systems, someone with an IP address in Russia started trying to log in, according to Berulis' disclosure. The attempts were "near real-time," according to the disclosure. Those attempts were blocked, but they were especially alarming. Whoever was attempting to log in was using one of the newly created DOGE accounts — and the person had the correct username and password, according to Berulis. While it's possible the user was disguising their location, it's highly unlikely they'd appear to be coming from Russia if they wanted to avoid suspicion, cybersecurity experts interviewed by NPR explained.</p>   <p>On their own, a few failed login attempts from a Russian IP address aren't a smoking gun, those cybersecurity experts interviewed by NPR said. But given the overall picture of activity, it's a concerning sign that foreign adversaries may already be searching for ways into government systems that DOGE engineers may have left exposed.</p>   <p>"When you move fast and break stuff, the opportunity to ride the coattails of authorized access is ridiculously easy to achieve," said Handorf. What he means is that if DOGE engineers left access points to the network open, it would be very easy for spies or criminals to break in and steal data behind DOGE.</p>   <p>He said he could also see foreign adversaries trying to recruit or pay DOGE team members for access to sensitive data. "It would not surprise me if DOGE is accidentally compromised."</p>   <p>"This is exactly why we usually architect systems using best practices like the principle of least privilege," Ann Lewis, the former director of Technology Transformation Services at the General Services Administration, told NPR in an interview. "The principle of least privilege is a fundamental cybersecurity concept … that states that users should have only the minimum rights, roles and permissions required to perform their roles and responsibilities. This protects access to high-value data and critical assets and helps prevent unauthorized access, accidental damage from user errors and malicious actions. "</p>   <p>Bakaj, Berulis' lawyer, told NPR in a written statement: "This case has been particularly sensitive as it involves the possibility of sophisticated foreign intelligence gaining access to sensitive government systems, which is why we went to the Senate Intelligence Committee directly."<br></p>   <h3><strong>A troubling pattern</strong></h3>   <p>The NLRB isn't alone in those concerns.</p>   <p>In over a dozen lawsuits in federal courts <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/03/26/nx-s1-5339842/doge-data-access-privacy-act-social-security-treasury-opm-lawsuit" target="_blank">around the country</a>, judges have demanded that DOGE explain why it needs such expansive access to sensitive data on Americans, from Social Security records to private medical records and tax information. But the Trump administration has been unable to give consistent and clear answers, largely dismissing cybersecurity and privacy concerns.</p>   <p>In one case dealing with Treasury Department payment systems that control trillions of dollars in federal spending, U.S. District Judge Jeannette Vargas <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/03/31/nx-s1-5345708/doge-data-access-labor-cfpb-hhs" target="_blank">blocked DOGE access</a> on Feb. 21, finding "a real possibility exists that sensitive information has already been shared outside of the Treasury Department, in potential violation of federal law."</p>   <p>It's an <a href="https://oversightdemocrats.house.gov/news/press-releases/committee-democrats-are-shining-light-doges-dark-dealings" target="_blank">area of focus </a>for Democratic lawmakers on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.</p>   <div id="resg-s1-60265">

   <p>One of the first people to speak out about DOGE's access to sensitive data was Erie Meyer, who resigned as the chief technology officer at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) in February. She has provided testimony in ongoing court cases surrounding DOGE's access and also spoke to NPR in an interview. The CFPB has sensitive and potentially market-moving data. Meyer said DOGE employees granted themselves "God-tier" access to the CFPB's systems, turned off auditing and event logs and put the cybersecurity experts responsible for insider threat detection on administrative leave. When IT experts at the CFPB planned to conduct an "after action" report on DOGE's activities, they were stonewalled, she continued.</p>   <p>When she heard about how DOGE engineers operated at the NLRB, particularly the steps they took to obfuscate their activities, she recognized a pattern.</p>   <p>"I am trembling," she said upon hearing about the potential exposure of data from the NLRB. "They can get every piece of whistleblower testimony, every report, everything. This is not good."</p>   <p>Other technical employees working with government agencies who spoke to NPR shared Berulis' concerns.</p>   <p>"Our cyber teams are pissed because they have to sit on their hands when every single alarm system we have regarding insider threats is going off," said one employee at an agency of the Interior Department who requested anonymity, fearing retribution. Cybersecurity teams wanted to shut off new users' access to the system, the employee continued, but were ordered to stand down.</p>   <p>Meanwhile, in a <a href="https://federalnewsnetwork.com/commentary/2025/03/letter-to-the-editor-46-former-gsa-executives-say-cuts-to-cause-irreversible-damage/?readmore=1" target="_blank">letter published</a> on March 13 on Federal News Network, 46 former senior officials from the General Services Administration, one of the government agencies hardest hit by DOGE's cost-cutting efforts and that oversees nearly all federal buildings and purchasing, wrote that they believed "highly-sensitive IT systems are being put at risk and sensitive information is being downloaded to unknown, unvetted external sources in clear violation of privacy and data-protection rules."<br></p>   <h3>The tip of the iceberg</h3>   <p>The Trump administration could be trying to codify DOGE's practices into how the government shares information, said Kel McClanahan, the executive director of nonprofit public interest law firm National Security Counselors, who is representing federal employees in a lawsuit concerning the Office of Personnel Management's use of a private email server.</p>   <p>Weeks after DOGE staffers descended on federal buildings across Washington, Trump issued an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/03/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-eliminates-information-silos-to-stop-waste-fraud-and-abuse-60f3/" target="_blank">executive order</a> urging increased data sharing "by eliminating information silos" in what's seen by experts like McClanahan as an attempt to give DOGE engineers further top cover in accessing and amalgamating sensitive federal data, despite laws concerning privacy and cybersecurity.</p>   <p>"The entire reason we have a Privacy Act is that Congress realized 50 years ago that the federal government was just overflowing with information about normal everyday people and needed some guardrails in place," McClanahan told NPR. "The information silos are there for a reason," he continued. "It's astonishing to me that the very people who not a handful of years ago were screaming about the government tracking us with vaccines now cheer for feeding every piece of information about themselves into Elon Musk's stupid Skynet."</p>   <p>DOGE appears to still be in the process of visiting federal agencies across the country, including just recently the Securities and Exchange Commission, according to one former government source directly familiar with the matter who requested anonymity to share information they weren't authorized to share. Across the government, it's unclear how much sensitive data has been removed and collected and combined.</p>   <p>It's also unclear where the labor data went and who has access to it. But for experts in workers' rights, the threat is immediate and existential.</p>   <p>"This shocks the conscience," said Richard Griffin, the former general counsel of the NLRB. "And if DOGE operatives captured and removed case files, it could constitute a violation of the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/03/13/1238261955/over-a-dozen-lawsuits-to-stop-doge-data-access-are-betting-on-a-1974-law" target="_blank">Privacy Act</a>."</p>   <p>For Berulis, it was important to speak out, because he believes people deserve to know how the government's data and computer systems are at risk, and to prevent further damage. As a former IT consultant, Berulis says he would have been fired for operating like DOGE.</p>   <div id="resg-s1-60230">

   <p>Disclosing his concerns "was a moral imperative at this point," he said. "I've never encountered this in my 20 years of IT."</p>   <p>His hope is that there might be further investigations into mishandling of sensitive data across the federal government.</p>   <p>"I believe with all my heart that this goes far beyond just case data," he said. "I know there are [people] at other agencies who have seen similar behavior. I firmly believe that this is happening maybe even to a greater extent at other agencies."</p>   <p>For overseers, investigators and IT experts in a similar position, he hopes to provide a road map of what to look for.</p>   <p>"It was my goal by disclosing to Congress not to focus on me at all, but to give them information that they might not necessarily have, the things that you don't necessarily look for unless you know where to look," he continued.</p>   <p>The NLRB said it would cooperate with any investigations that stem from Berulis' disclosure to Congress.</p>   <p>"As an agency protecting employee rights, the NLRB respects its employee's right to bring whistleblower claims to Congress and the Office of Special Counsel, and the Agency looks forward to working with those entities to resolve the complaints," said Bearese, the agency's acting spokesperson, in a statement.</p>   <p>Berulis had a simple request for the DOGE engineers: "Be transparent. If you have nothing to hide, don't delete logs, don't be covert. ... Be open, because that's what efficiency is really about. If this is all a huge misunderstanding, then just prove it. Put it out there. That's all I'm asking."</p>   <p>But ultimately, if the systems that DOGE accesses are left insecure, it might not matter if its intentions are honorable, he concluded.</p>   <p>"This could just be the start of the operation. ... They still haven't crossed that boundary where they're plugged into every federal system out there," he continued. "So maybe there is still time."</p>   <p><strong><em>NPR's Stephen Fowler contributed reporting.

            <span>Abstract:</span>We present two multilingual LLMs designed to embrace Europe's linguistic diversity by supporting all 24 official languages of the European Union. Trained on a dataset comprising around 60% non-English data and utilizing a custom multilingual tokenizer, our models address the limitations of existing LLMs that predominantly focus on English or a few high-resource languages. We detail the models' development principles, i.e., data composition, tokenizer optimization, and training methodologies. The models demonstrate competitive performance across multilingual benchmarks, as evidenced by their performance on European versions of ARC, HellaSwag, MMLU, and TruthfulQA.

Ghidra is a free and open-source suite of reverse engineering tools from the NSA; it's an alternative to the paid <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://hex-rays.com/ida-pro/"><span>IDA Pro</span></a>.</p><p>This file we're opening is the partition image direct from the flash; it's comprised of multiple segments of data, each getting mapped to different virtual memory regions on the ESP32. For example, data at offset <code>0x17CC4</code> in the partition image is actually mapped to <code>0x40080ce0</code> in the device's virtual memory, so although this file contains all of the application logic and data, Ghidra won't understand how to resolve any absolute memory references, at least for now. There will be more on this later!</p><p>The ESP32 microprocessor uses the Xtensa instruction set, and Ghidra has recently added support for this! When loading the image, you can select the language <code>Tensilica Xtensa 32-bit little-endian</code>. We can run the auto analysis; although it won't give us great results just yet, we can still look at any defined strings it is able to find.</p><h2><a href="#string-theory" title="String Theory"><span>String Theory</span></a></h2><p>Text strings in a compiled application are a fast-track way of locating and understanding logic when reverse engineering; they can reveal a lot about the application. </p><p>Because this compiled file only contains bytecode instructions for the processor, there are no function names, data types, or parameters. It can initially seem like a giant blob of nonsense, but as soon as you a string reference like <code>Failed to read wifi config file</code>, you can start to piece together what the logic is doing. Reverse engineering compiled applications can be difficult, but it is certainly a rewarding challenge.</p><p>So, I had a look through the <code>Defined Strings</code> window in Ghidra to see what I could find, and noticed all of the strings we saw in the serial output, such as:</p><div><div><pre><code><span><span>000031c4	</span><span>"Serial Number: %s</span><span>\r</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>

Ideally, this should be the address in the virtual memory when running on the ESP32; that way, we can see any bytecode that references this string. We'll tackle that soon!</p></div><p>In close proximity to these strings were some others of interest:</p><div><div><pre><code><span><span>000030d0	</span><span>"Message CRC error</span><span>\r</span><span>"</span><span>

This has a handy feature to show the checksum of the currently selected data. </p><p>Because the other function reads a 16-bit uint, I select CRC-16 and start selecting regions of bytes that would likely be hashed, leaving 2 bytes unselected where I think the 16-bit hash could be.</p><p>No luck so far, but then I noticed you can configure the CRC-16 parameters in ImHex. So, I tried a cheap shortcut and set up ImHex to calculate CRC-16 checksums with a bunch of different parameter combinations using the values found in the decompiled function.</p><p>Success! The last 2 bytes of the packet turned out to be a CRC checksum of all other data in the packet, specifically CRC-16 with <code>0x1021</code> polynomial and <code>0xFFFF</code> initial value.

So, what exactly are they?</p><p>ECDH (Elliptic Curve Diffie–Hellman Key Exchange) is a key agreement protocol that allows 2 parties (like the smart device and its cloud server), each having an elliptic-curve public–private key pair, to establish a shared secret over an insecure channel (UDP). I found a great explanation of this in more detail in "Practical Cryptography for Developers": <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://cryptobook.nakov.com/asymmetric-key-ciphers/ecdh-key-exchange"><span>ECDH Key Exchange</span></a>.</p><p>Essentially, if the smart device and server generate an EC key pair and exchange their public keys, they can use the other's public key with their private key to compute a shared secret key. This shared secret key could be used to encrypt and decrypt the packets! And even though they exchange public keys over the insecure network, you still need one of the private keys in order to compute the shared key.</p><p>This is ideal for securing packets like this, and the first packet sent by the client is actually named the <code>ECC conn packet</code> in the logs:</p><div><pre><code><span><span>UDP Connect</span><span>:</span><span> smartdeviceep.---.com
</span></span><span><span>smartdeviceep.---.com = </span><span>192.168</span><span>.</span><span>0.10</span><span>
</span></span><span>UDP Socket created
</span><span>UDP RX Thread Start
</span><span>Write ECC conn packet</span></code></pre></div><p>This is great progress; we know the first packet exchange is likely exchanging EC public keys to establish an ECDH key agreement to encrypt all the other packets.</p><p>If we ignore the packet header (13 bytes from the start) and checksum (2 bytes at the end), we can see the contents of the packets for this potential key exchange are both 32 bytes (256 bits), which would be a valid size for a public key. Even though the client's request has <code>00 01</code> at the start, we can assume this is some unimportant data descriptor as it doesn't change value between boots:</p><div><pre><code><span><span>// Client request packet contents:</span><span>

That is HMAC-based key derivation. It can be used to convert shared secrets computed from Diffie–Hellman into key material suitable for use in encryption. Wow, that makes a lot of sense; it's most likely doing exactly that to derive a key to encrypt and decrypt the other packets.</p><h2><a href="#cryptography-analysis" title="Cryptography Analysis"><span>Cryptography Analysis</span></a></h2><p>To be able to decrypt these packets, we need to understand exactly how the key for encryption is generated.

So, that's what we're going to do!</p><p>The main aim now is to decrypt and log as much data as possible; then, we can reference that to write a local server endpoint that entirely replaces their cloud server.</p><p>I hack together a quick Node.js script to do this:</p><div><div><pre><code><span><span>const</span><span> dns </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>require</span><span>(</span><span>"dns"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span>

However, the source of truth for state updates is always the device, meaning the state will never update in the MQTT broker unless the device updates it via the custom server. This covers a couple of edge cases:</p><ul><li><p>If the state update was unsuccessful, we should not display the state as updated.</p></li><li><p>The state update should be reflected via the MQTT broker if the smart device was updated via its physical control panel.</p></li></ul></div><p>The three main cases we are supporting here are:</p><ul><li><p>When the smart device boots and initially connects to the custom server, it requests the latest state; we can attempt to obtain this from the MQTT broker's retained value or fall back to a default state.</p></li><li><p>When Home Assistant wants to update the state, it will send a command to the MQTT broker. We can subscribe to this command topic from the custom server and forward the request to the smart device.</p></li><li><p>When the smart device's state changes for any reason, it sends the <code>mirror_data</code> packet to update the server state; we send this value to the MQTT broker to update the state and tell it to retain the data as the latest value.</p></li></ul><p>I run this custom server alongside Mosquitto and Home Assistant on my small home automation server.

They created a custom solution which introduced some downsides to the system:</p><ul><li><div><p>We're not certain if each device has its own unique private key, but whether it does or not, both have downsides:</p><ul><li><p>If all devices share the same firmware private key, the attacker needs to reverse engineer just a single device to MITM attack any other devices.</p></li><li><p>However, if every device has its own unique private key, the server must keep a data store mapping device serial numbers to the key of each device. So, In the case of any data loss, the server would entirely lose the ability to respond to any device communications; that is a scary thought for the business. Unless there is an insecure network fallback in place, which is equally alarming and time-consuming to develop</p></li></ul></div></li><li><p>Because the firmware contains a private key that is static, an attacker needs a single firmware dump to obtain the key and perform an MITM attack. Whereas, if an EC private key was instead generated at runtime, write access would be required in order to patch the server public key or application firmware, which could be protected by other means.</p></li></ul><p>Also, the mobile app has a 1-star review on the app store. It makes me wonder if there is a correlation between the unexpectedly custom technical implementation and the abnormally poor end-user app experience. Building a custom system is far more than just the initial development; systems need support, and bugs need fixing. </p><p>Overall, it wasn't a bad implementation from a security perspective; you'd still need physical access to attack the device; there are pros and cons to everything and variables that aren't visible from our perspective.</p><p>The custom implementation increased the obscurity of network communication. However, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_through_obscurity"><span>Security through obscurity</span></a> is simply a short-term win. While it may deter generic attacks on standard technical implementations. In the bigger picture, it's just an annoying yet passable hoop for an attacker to jump through. </p><p>I've had a few conversations recently about why engineers build from the ground up vs. using proven standards. And that's a very interesting topic; I'll save that for another post!</p><h2><a href="#conclusion" title="Conclusion"><span>Conclusion</span></a></h2><p>What a crazy journey that was! </p><p>I'd like to emphasize that the reverse-engineering process was not as smooth as it may seem from this post; I've done my best to format everything to be best read by you. But in reality, I was often in the dark, unsure if the next thing would work or not, and juggling many tasks and theories, iteratively making progress in multiple places to test my assumptions ASAP.</p><p>I tried some things that hit dead-ends and weren't worth dedicated sections in this post:</p><ul><li><p>I tried running the firmware in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://github.com/espressif/qemu"><span>Espressif's fork of QEMU</span></a>, patched out the CapSense service, and loaded virtual e-fuses to match the MAC address from the firmware, all to find out it doesn't support WiFi emulation. It was fun to see it booting virtually, though!</p></li><li><p>I also tried flashing a different serial number, device key, and certificates to see if that affected anything before I got around to fully reversing the application logic. I didn't get much from this. Turns out this likely would have just affected the computed shared secret used for the HKDF salt, which we dumped anyway.</p></li></ul><p>I've certainly sharpened a variety of skills from this project. I'm also proud I achieved my goal of adding this device to Home Assistant! The moment I managed to successfully decrypt the first packet was great; everything just clicked into place.</p><p>I'm still curious to explore creating an open-source project to de-cloud and debug smart home products; I've learned much more about the technical aspects of achieving that.</p><p>Thanks for reading! I hope you found some value in this post. I put a massive amount of effort into creating it, probably more than I did actually doing the project itself. It would be amazing to receive feedback on the format!</p><p>I'd also really appreciate it if you could help share the post. </p><p>You can drop a follow on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://twitter.com/jmswrnr"><span>X</span></a> to stay updated with what I'm doing.</p><p>If you found it helpful and would like to support my content creation, you can <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://buymeacoffee.com/jmswrnr"><span>Buy Me a Coffee</span></a>!

It is also unconstitutional," attorney Luna Droubi said in an email.</p><p>According to the court filing, Mahdawi was born in a refugee camp in the West Bank and moved to the United States in 2014.</p><p>He recently completed coursework at Columbia in New York and was expected to graduate in May before beginning a master's degree program there in the fall.</p><p>The petition describes him as a committed Buddhist who believes in "non-violence and empathy as a central tenet of his religion."</p><h2>Arrest 'immoral, inhumane, and illegal'</h2><p>As a student, Mahdawi was an outspoken critic of Israel's military campaign in Gaza and organized campus protests until March 2024.</p><p>He co-founded the Palestinian Student Union at Columbia with Mahmoud Khalil, another Palestinian permanent resident of the U.S. and graduate student who recently was detained by ICE.</p><p>Khalil was the first person arrested under President Donald Trump's promised crackdown on students who joined campus protests against the war in Gaza.</p><p>On Friday, an immigration judge in Louisiana ruled that Khalil can be deported as a national security risk.</p><p>Christopher Helali, a friend of Mahdawi who lives near him in Vermont, was present outside the immigration office when Mahdawi was detained and recorded a video of Mahdawi being led away by authorities.</p><p>In the video, which Helali released on social media Monday, Mahdawi is shown giving a peace sign with his hands and being led away to a car.</p><p>Helali described Mahdawi as a peaceful demonstrator who has worked to foster dialogue about the struggle of Palestinians in his homeland.</p><p>Helali said he and Mahdawi were aware that Mahdawi could be detained today and that his friend went forward with the appointment anyway.</p><p>"And rightfully so, he was nervous for what was going on around him. But he was very much resolute in coming to this interview and coming today because he didn't do anything wrong and was a law-abiding citizen, or soon-to-be citizen," Helali said.</p><p>Vermont's congressional delegation issued a statement condemning Mahdawi's arrest, saying that instead of taking one of the final steps in his citizenship process, he was handcuffed by armed officers with their faces covered.</p><p>"This is immoral, inhumane and illegal. Mr. Mahdawi, a legal resident of the United States, must be afforded due process under the law and immediately released from detention," said the statement from Sen. Bernie Sanders, Sen.

						<p>The whole “vibe coding” thing is another reminder that quite a lot of people working in tech don’t understand the difference between programs and products.</p>

<p>To me, programs are “works on my machine” code. The kind of things many of us crank out a few times every week. Experiments, prototypes… that script you hacked up to rename all the MP4 files in a folder? You know the one. No error checking. Hard-coded path names. Does it work on Windows? Who cares? I’m on Linux right now and I got work to do.</p>

<p>I have dozens of these kinds of programs I use every day. They’re tools I use to automate bits of my work. They crash all the time (“what? Oh… that person has a backslash in the title of their presentation… interesting.”) - but that doesn’t matter; I fix them, I get the results I need, I move on. The code is just a means to an end. The result is what matters.</p>

<p>If you’re writing software that you’re planning to ship; to distribute to other people, perhaps even sell it to paying customers? Well, now that’s a whole different ball game.</p>

<p>Probably the single most important lesson I’ve learned in my career, the thing that I would argue is the hallmark of “experience”, is understanding just how much work it takes to turn a working <em>program</em> into a viable <em>product</em>. It’s why developer estimates are so notoriously optimistic - and why experienced developers are so notoriously cynical. Let’s say you crank out a bit of code that’ll take responses from a web form and add them in an Excel spreadsheet. That’s not that hard… yay! we just built a Typeform competitor in one afternoon! Except, no, you didn’t. You made one thing work one time on one computer. You haven’t considered encoding, internationalization, concurrency, authentication, telemetry, billing, branding, mobile devices, deployment. You haven’t hit any of the weird limits yet - ever had a system work brilliantly for the first 65,535 requests and then fall over? You don’t have a product. At best, you have a proof-of-concept of a good idea that, if some very smart people work very hard, might become a viable product.</p>

<p>One of the genuinely positive things about tools like Copilot and ChatGPT is that they empower people with minimal development experience to create their own programs. Little programs that do useful things - and that’s <em>awesome</em>. More power to the users.</p>

<p>But that’s not product development, it’s programming. They aren’t the same thing. Not even close.</p>

<p>Temu completely shut off Google Shopping ads in the U.S. on April 9, with its App Store ranking subsequently plummeting from a typical third or fourth position to 58th in just three days. </p>



<p>The company’s impression share, which measures how often their ads appear compared to eligibility, dropped sharply before disappearing completely from advertiser auction data by April 12.</p>



<p>The timing coincided with the Trump administration’s hardened stance on Chinese imports, raising tariffs to 125% while maintaining a more moderate approach to other trading partners.</p>



<p><strong>First seen.</strong> Mike Ryan, head of ecommerce insights at Smarter Ecommerce, shared this news on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mikeryanretail_%F0%9D%97%A7%F0%9D%97%B2%F0%9D%97%BA%F0%9D%98%82-%F0%9D%97%B5%F0%9D%97%AE%F0%9D%98%80-%F0%9D%97%B9%F0%9D%97%B2%F0%9D%97%B3%F0%9D%98%81-%F0%9D%98%81%F0%9D%97%B5%F0%9D%97%B2-%F0%9D%97%AF%F0%9D%98%82%F0%9D%97%B6%F0%9D%97%B9%F0%9D%97%B1%F0%9D%97%B6%F0%9D%97%BB%F0%9D%97%B4-activity-7317519336426901504-Kucf/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAB0N7MBstWf5SblEci2G1F3WzMSeIW1b7s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn</a>:</p>

<p><strong>Between the lines</strong>. Temu’s business model relied on heavily subsidized orders from parent company PDD to drive market share growth, despite operating at a loss on individual sales.</p>



<ul>
<li>New tariffs, combined with crackdowns on “de minimis” import loopholes, have severely undermined Temu’s direct-from-manufacturer approach.</li>



<li>The company’s inability to maintain app performance without advertising for even a single day demonstrates the fragility of its market position.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Why we care</strong>. Ecommerce advertisers may experience temporary relief in digital advertising costs as Temu’s aggressive spending vanishes from auction platforms. Similar rapid market exits (e.g., Amazon during early pandemic lockdowns) led to drops in cost-per-click metrics. Some reduction in CPM rates is expected, potentially lowering both CPC and cost-per-conversion for remaining advertisers.</p>



<p><strong>Tariffs</strong>. The underlying causes of Temu’s retreat (tariffs and import restrictions) could ultimately prove more damaging to the ecommerce landscape, particularly for small and medium-sized businesses.</p>



<p><strong>Bottom line</strong>. Unlike failed competitor Wish.com, Temu’s parent company remains fundamentally sound. With U.S. trade policy still in flux and facing internal opposition even within the administration, Temu’s retreat may not be permanent.</p>

<p>On Friday, Feb 7, 2025 we had an incident with our Next.js web app hosted on Vercel that could've cost us $7,000 if we didn't notice it in time.</p>
<p>We had a spike in LLM bot traffic coming from Amazonbot, Claudebot, Meta and an unknown bot. Together they sent 66.5k requests to our site within a single day. Bots scraped thousands of images that used Vercel's Image Optimization API, which cost us $5 per 1k images.</p>
<p>The misconfiguration on our side combined with the aggressive bot traffic created an economically risky situation for our tiny bootstrapped startup.</p>
<h2 id="context"><a href="#context">Context</a></h2>
<p>Metacast is a podcast tech startup. Our main product is a <a href="https://metacast.app/">podcast app</a> for iOS and Android.</p>
<p>For every podcast episode on the platform, our web app has a web page. Our platform has ~1.4M episodes, which means we have 1.4M web pages that are discoverable by crawlers. These pages are generated server-side at request time, then cached.</p>
<p><img src="https://metacast.app/images/blog/engineering/postmortem-llm-bots-image-optimization/lex-podcast-page-metacast.png" alt="Lex Fridman Podcast"></p>
<h2 id="how-we-discovered-the-problem"><a href="#how-we-discovered-the-problem">How we discovered the problem</a></h2>
<h3 id="step-1-a-cost-spike"><a href="#step-1-a-cost-spike">Step 1: A cost spike</a></h3>
<p>First, we received a cost alert from Vercel saying that we've hit 50% of the budget for resources metered by usage.</p>
<p><img src="https://metacast.app/images/blog/engineering/postmortem-llm-bots-image-optimization/vercel-cost-alert.png" alt="Vercel cost alert"></p>
<h3 id="step-2-image-optimization-api-usage-spike"><a href="#step-2-image-optimization-api-usage-spike">Step 2: Image Optimization API usage spike</a></h3>
<p>We looked into it and saw that it's driven by the Image Optimization API, which peaked on Feb 7.</p>
<p><img src="https://metacast.app/images/blog/engineering/postmortem-llm-bots-image-optimization/vercel-image-optimization-usage-summary.jpg" alt="Image Optimization Usage"></p>
<p><img src="https://metacast.app/images/blog/engineering/postmortem-llm-bots-image-optimization/vercel-image-optimization-chart.jpg" alt="Image Optimization Usage Chart"></p>
<p>Every page in the podcast directory has an image of a podcast cover (source image dimensions are 3000x3000px). With Image Optimization, podcast covers were reduced to 1/10th of the size, then cached. Image Optimization made the web app really snappy. It worked like a charm, except it turned out to be very expensive.</p>
<p>Vercel <a href="https://vercel.com/docs/image-optimization/limits-and-pricing">charges</a> $5 for every 1,000 images optimized. With thousands of requests coming our way, we were accumulating cost at the rate of $5 per each 1k image requests. In the worst case scenario, if all 1.4M images were crawled we'd hypothetically be looking at a $7k bill from Vercel.</p>
<h3 id="step-3-tens-of-thousands-of-requests-from-llm-bots"><a href="#step-3-tens-of-thousands-of-requests-from-llm-bots">Step 3: Tens of thousands of requests from LLM bots</a></h3>
<p>We looked at the user agents of requests in the Firewall in Vercel and saw Amazonbot, ClaudeBot, meta_externalagent and an unknown bot disguising itself as a browser.</p>
<p><img src="https://metacast.app/images/blog/engineering/postmortem-llm-bots-image-optimization/vercel-user-agent-stats.png" alt="User Agents"></p>
<p>We can't say definitively which bots were downloading images, because we are on the Pro plan on Vercel and no longer have access to logs from Friday. We only know that it was bot traffic.</p>
<h2 id="mitigation"><a href="#mitigation">Mitigation</a></h2>
<h3 id="step-1-stop-the-bleeding"><a href="#step-1-stop-the-bleeding">Step 1: Stop the bleeding</a></h3>
<p>Both of us used to work at AWS where we internalized the golden rule of incident recovery - <strong>stop the bleeding first, do a long-term fix later</strong>.</p>
<p>We configured firewall rules in Vercel to block bots from Amazon, Anthropic, OpenAI and Meta. To be fair, OpenAI didn't crawl our site, but we blocked it as a preventative measure.</p>
<p><img src="https://metacast.app/images/blog/engineering/postmortem-llm-bots-image-optimization/vercel-firewall-rules.jpg" alt="Firewall rules"></p>
<h3 id="step-2-disable-image-optimization"><a href="#step-2-disable-image-optimization">Step 2: Disable Image Optimization</a></h3>
<p>First, we disabled image optimization by adding an <code>unoptimized</code> property to podcast images in Next.js. Our reasoning was that users accessing the pages will get the latest version of the page with unoptimized images.</p>
<p>We didn't consider that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bots had already crawled thousands of pages and would crawl the <em>optimized</em> images using the URLs they extracted from the "old" HTML.</li>
<li>Our site enabled image optimization for all external hosts.</li>
</ul>
<p>The latter is the most embarrassing part of the story. We missed an obvious exploit in the web app.</p>

<span data-line=""><span>  ...</span></span></code></pre></figure>
<p>To explain why we did this in the first place, we need to add some important context about podcasting.</p>
<p>We do not own the podcast content displayed on our site. Similar to other podcast apps like Apple and Spotify, we ingest podcast information from RSS feeds and display it in our directory. The cover images are hosted on specialized podcast hosting platforms like <a href="https://transistor.fm/">Transistor</a>, <a href="https://www.buzzsprout.com/">Buzzsprout</a>, and others. But podcasts could be hosted anywhere from a WordPress website to an S3 bucket. It is impractical to allowlist all possible hosts.</p>
<p>Optimizing an image meant that Next.js downloaded the image from one of those hosts to Vercel first, optimized it, then served to the users. If we wanted to make our site snappy, we had to either build and maintain an image optimization pipeline ourselves or use the built-in capability. As a scrappy startup for whom a web app was at best secondary, we chose the faster route without thinking much about it.</p>
<p>In retrospect, we should've researched how it works. We're lucky no one started using our site as an image optimization API.</p>
<p>To mitigate the problem entirely, we disabled image optimization for any external URLs. Now, image optimization is only enabled for images hosted on our own domain. Podcast covers load noticeably slower. We'll need to do something about it eventually.</p>
<p>But this is not all.</p>
<h3 id="step-3-robotstxt"><a href="#step-3-robotstxt">Step 3: robots.txt</a></h3>
<p>Of course, we knew about <code>robots.txt</code>, a file that tells crawlers whether they're allowed to crawl the site or not.</p>
<p>Since both of us were new to managing a large-scale content site (our background is in backends, APIs, and web apps behind auth), we didn't even think about LLM bots. It's just not something that was on our radar. So, our <code>robots.txt</code> was a simple allow-all except for a few paths that we disallowed.</p>
<p>Our first reaction was to disable all bot traffic except Google. But when we understood that the root cause of the problem lied in the misconfigured image optimization, we decided to keep our site open to all LLM and search engine bots. Serving the text content doesn't cost us much, but we may benefit from being shown as a source of data in LLMs, which would be similar to being shown on a search engine results page (SERP).</p>
<p>We generate <code>robots.txt</code> programmatically using <a href="https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/metadata/robots">robots.ts</a> in Next.js. We researched the bots and added their user agents to our code. If we ever need to disable any of the bots, we can do so very quickly now. While we were at it, we disabled some paths for SEO bots like Semrush and MJ12Bot.</p>
<p>Note that <code>robots.txt</code> only works if bots respect it. It's honor-based system and there are still bad bots out there that ignore it and/or attempt to disguise themselves as users.</p>

<p>We will start with the one thing we've done well.</p>
<h3 id="continue-with-a-sensitive-spend-limit"><a href="#continue-with-a-sensitive-spend-limit">Continue with a sensitive spend limit</a></h3>
<p>We had a very sensitive spend limit alert. We knew we should not be spending much on Vercel, so we set it very low. When it triggered, we knew something was off.</p>
<p>This may be the most important lesson to all startups and big enterprises alike - always set spend limits for your infrastructure, or the bill may ruin you. You can probably negotiate with Vercel, AWS, GCP, etc. and they'll reduce or forgive your bill. But it's best to not put yourself in a situation where you have to ask for a favor.</p>
<h3 id="mindset-for-scale"><a href="#mindset-for-scale">Mindset for scale</a></h3>
<p>We've learned a ton and have (hopefully) attuned ourselves to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The scale we're operating at</strong> – we're serving millions of pages and need to be prepared for user traffic at that scale. The bots gave us a taste for what it would've been like had our app gone viral.</li>
<li><strong>The scale of web crawlers, both good and bad</strong> – we need to be prepared to be "anthropized", "openAIed", "amazoned", or "semrushed." It's the new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slashdot_effect">slasdot effect</a> but without the benefit of immediate gratification.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ready-for-defense"><a href="#ready-for-defense">Ready for defense</a></h3>
<p>We've now better understood the options we have for firewalling ourselves from bots if we have to do so in the future. We can use Vercel firewall as the first line of defense or add a more advanced WAF from Cloudflare if things get dire.</p>
<p>See this post from Cloudflare: <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/declaring-your-aindependence-block-ai-bots-scrapers-and-crawlers-with-a-single-click/">Declare your AIndependence: block AI bots, scrapers and crawlers with a single click</a></p>

<p>When we discovered the rate at which bots were crawling our site, we <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ilyabezdelev_our-site-is-getting-totally-slammed-by-activity-7293596095778074624-MD_I">posted about it</a> on LinkedIn. We were just sharing what's going on in real time, but boy did it hit the nerve. Almost 400k impressions, 2.4k likes, 270+ comments, 120+ reposts.</p>
<p><img src="https://metacast.app/images/blog/engineering/postmortem-llm-bots-image-optimization/linkedin-post.jpg" alt="LinkedIn post stats"></p>
<p>We've gone through all comments on the post and responded to most of them.</p>
<p>Lots of folks offered solutions like <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/declaring-your-aindependence-block-ai-bots-scrapers-and-crawlers-with-a-single-click/">CloudFlare</a>, using middleware, rate limiting, etc. Some offered to feed junk back to LLM bots.</p>
<p>We learned about <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/ai-haters-build-tarpits-to-trap-and-trick-ai-scrapers-that-ignore-robots-txt/">tarpit</a> tools like <a href="https://iocaine.madhouse-project.org/">iocaine</a> and <a href="https://zadzmo.org/code/nepenthes/">Nepenthes</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>You could lure them into a honeypot?<br>
Like nepenthes or locaine.<br>
If you feel like poisoning the ai well</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>People rightfully pointed out that you can get ruined by infinite scalability of cloud resources.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>that's my biggest concern about cloud providers. You make a small mistake (everyone does) and the costs can skyrocket overnight.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We learned that some people aren't aware of the LLM bot crawling activity or the scale of it. They thanked us for raising awareness.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>WOW - thanks for alerting us.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some people had been surprised by bots just like we were.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Same here. At first I was super excited to get so many new subscriptions. We did reCaptcha and Cloudflare. Things have quieted down. Thanks for posting. I thought we were the only ones</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some aren't surprised at all and see it as a problem.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Very recognizable (unfortunately). These (predominantly AI) bots started noticeably hitting our platform back in May/June 2024. Lots of time &amp; efforts wasted to keep our bills in check. We also found out that not all of them respect Robots.txt, so indeed a WAF is needed as well. I can(not) imagine how painful this must/will be for smaller businesses...</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some people blamed us for not being prepared and called us out on calling out AI companies. Others defended us. Virality is a double-edged sword.</p>
<p>A large portion of the comments were claiming that data scraping is unethical, illegal, etc. People were outraged. It wasn't our intention, but our post brought the issue to the zeitgeist of that day.</p>
<h2 id="parting-thoughts"><a href="#parting-thoughts">Parting thoughts</a></h2>
<p><strong>There's a part of me that is glad that this happened.</strong></p>
<p>We got a taste of operating a web app at scale before reaching scale. It was easy to block bots, but had it been caused by user traffic, we'd have to swallow the cost or downgrade the experience. Bots were the canaries in a coalmine.</p>
<p><strong>Any technology has negative externalities.</strong></p>
<p>Some are obvious, some aren't. Of all the things that were happening, I was worried that we'd get penalized by podcast hosters whose endpoints we were hitting at the same rate as bots requested images from our site.</p>
<p><strong>Operating at scale on the internet is a game of defense</strong></p>
<p>We can rant about bots as much as we want, but that <em>is</em> the reality we operate in. So we better acknowledge it and deal with it.</p>
<p>P.S. We'll be discussing this topic on the next episode of the <a href="https://metacast.app/podcasts/7d7e381e-907c-5b22-aefc-1fc8311d2a71">Metacast: Behind the scenes</a> podcast. Follow us wherever you listen to podcasts to hear the story with more nuance.</p>
<h2 id="upd-vercel-changed-their-image-optimization-pricing"><a href="#upd-vercel-changed-their-image-optimization-pricing">UPD: Vercel changed their image optimization pricing</a></h2>
<p>On Feb 18, 2025, just a few days after we published this blog post, Vercel <a href="https://vercel.com/changelog/faster-transformations-and-reduced-pricing-for-image-optimization">changed</a> their image optimization pricing. With the new pricing we'd not have faced a huge bill.</p>
<p><img src="https://metacast.app/images/blog/engineering/postmortem-llm-bots-image-optimization/vercel-new-pricing.webp" alt="New Image Optimization pricing on Vercel"></p>
<p>However, this wouldn't address the problem that we need to optimize images hosted outside of our domain. We ended up implementing our own image optimization.</p></div></article></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Raghib Hussain appointed chief executive officer of Altera.</p><div nonce="ijCpSEMuRnL490hOs/kXNA==">

					
						

					<!--?xml encoding="utf-8" ?--><p>SANTA CLARA, Calif.; SAN JOSE, Calif.; and MENLO PARK, Calif., April 14, 2025 – Intel Corporation today announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to sell 51% of its Altera business to Silver Lake, a global leader in technology investing.</p><p>The transaction, which values Altera at $8.75 billion, establishes Altera’s operational independence and makes it the largest pure-play FPGA (field programmable gate array) semiconductor solutions company. Altera offers a proven and highly scalable architecture and tool chain and is focused on driving growth and FPGA innovation to meet the demands and opportunities of an AI-driven market.</p><p>Intel will own the remaining 49% of the Altera business, enabling it to participate in Altera’s future success while focusing on its core business.</p><p>Intel also announced that Raghib Hussain will succeed Sandra Rivera as chief executive officer of Altera, effective May 5, 2025. Hussain is a highly accomplished and visionary technology executive with strong business acumen and engineering credentials. He joins Altera from his previous role as president of Products and Technologies at Marvell. Prior to joining Marvell in 2018, Hussain served as chief operating officer of Cavium, a company he co-founded. Prior to Cavium, Hussain held engineering roles at both Cisco and Cadence and helped found VPNet, an enterprise security company.</p><p>“Today’s announcement reflects our commitment to sharpening our focus, lowering our expense structure and strengthening our balance sheet,” said Lip-Bu Tan, chief executive officer of Intel. “Altera continues to make progress repositioning its product portfolio to participate in the fastest growing and most profitable segments of the FPGA market. We are grateful for Sandra’s strong leadership and lasting impact throughout her 25-year Intel career and wish her continued success as she begins a new chapter. Raghib is a superb executive we selected to lead the business forward based on his vast industry experience and proven track record of success. We look forward to partnering with Silver Lake upon closing of the transaction, as their industry expertise will help to accelerate Altera's efforts and unlock additional economic value for Intel.”</p><p>“This investment represents a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in a scale leader in advanced semiconductors. Together with Raghib, we will be focused on strengthening Altera’s technology leadership position and investing in emerging AI-driven markets such as edge computing and robotics,” said Kenneth Hao, chairman and managing partner of Silver Lake. “We look forward to working closely with Intel as a strategic partner who will continue to provide U.S.-based foundry services and complementary engagement with customers.”</p><p>“I am excited to lead Altera in its next chapter, and this milestone with Silver Lake furthers Altera’s journey to be the world's No. 1 FPGA solutions provider,” said Hussain. “Backed by Silver Lake’s strong track record and now with clarity of focus as an independent company, Altera is well-positioned to build on its momentum and deliver breakthrough FPGA-based solutions that are shaping the future of compute driven by AI. I am grateful for the impact Sandra has made and the team she has built as we begin Altera’s next phase of growth.”</p><p>Altera has been at the forefront of driving FPGA innovations for more than 40 years. The company provides leading programmable solutions that are easy-to-use and deploy in a range of strategically important segments such as industrial, communications, data center and military, aerospace, and government, as well as emerging markets such as AI/edge and robotics. Its broad portfolio of programmable semiconductor solutions, software and development tools deliver the reliability and flexibility needed to accelerate customer technology innovation.</p><p>The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2025, subject to customary closing conditions.</p><p>Upon closing, Intel expects to deconsolidate Altera’s financial results from Intel’s consolidated financial statements. In Fiscal Year 2024, Altera generated revenues of $1.54 billion, GAAP gross margin of $361 million and GAAP operating loss of $615 million. Altera’s Fiscal Year 2024 non-GAAP gross margin was $769 million and non-GAAP operating income was $35&nbsp;million. Reconciliations between the GAAP and non-GAAP measures are provided below.</p><p>Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. LLC acted as financial advisor to Intel.</p><p><strong>Forward-Looking Statements</strong></p><p>This release contains forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties, including with respect to the terms and anticipated timing of closing the agreed upon sale of a controlling interest in Altera and the potential benefits of such sale to Intel and Altera. Such statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied, including:&nbsp; the risk that the transaction may not be completed in a timely manner or at all, including as a result of a failure to receive regulatory approvals; the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstance that could give rise to the termination of the transaction; the risk that the expected benefits of the transaction, including as a result of the increased independence of Altera, may not be realized; the risk of future loss of the Altera business by Intel as a result of the sale of a controlling interest in Altera; disputes or potential litigation related to the transaction or the ownership, control and operation of the Altera business, including as it relates to Intel; unanticipated costs related to the transaction or the Altera business that may be incurred; risks as to the retention of key Altera personnel and customers; risks related to the diversion of management’s attention during the pendency of the transaction; potential adverse reactions or changes to business relationships resulting from the announcement or completion of the transaction; changes in demand for Altera’s semiconductor products; the high level of competition and rapid technological change in the semiconductor industry; and other risks and uncertainties described in Intel’s 2024 Form 10-K and our other filings with the SEC.</p><p>Given these risks and uncertainties, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Readers are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made in this release and in other documents we file from time to time with the SEC that disclose risks and uncertainties that may affect our business.</p><p>All information in this press release reflects Intel management views as of the date hereof unless an earlier date is specified. Intel does not undertake, and expressly disclaims any duty, to update such statements, whether as a result of new information, new developments, or otherwise, except to the extent that disclosure may be required by law.</p><p><strong>Non-GAAP Financial Measures</strong></p><p>This release contains references to non-GAAP financial measures: Altera non-GAAP gross margin and Altera non-GAAP operating income / (loss) measures. Set out below are reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed herein should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Please refer to “Explanation of Non-GAAP Measures” in Intel’s earnings release dated Jan. 30, 2025 for a detailed explanation of the adjustments made to the comparable GAAP measures, the ways management uses the non-GAAP measures, and the reasons why management believes the non-GAAP measures provide investors with useful supplemental information.</p><table nonce="ijCpSEMuRnL490hOs/kXNA==">

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>People say many things about entropy: entropy increases with time, entropy is disorder, entropy increases with energy, entropy determines the arrow of time, etc.. But I have no idea what entropy is, and from what I find, neither do most other people. This is the introduction I wish I had when first told about entropy, so hopefully you find it helpful. My goal is that by the end of this long post we will have a rigorous and intuitive understanding of those statements, and in particular, why the universe looks different when moving forward through time versus when traveling backward through time.</p><p>This journey begins with defining and understanding entropy. There are multiple formal definitions of entropy across disciplines—thermodynamics, statistical mechanics, information theory—but they all share a central idea: <strong>entropy quantifies uncertainty</strong>. The easiest introduction to entropy is through Information Theory, which will lead to entropy in physical systems, and then finally to the relationship between entropy and time.</p><h2 id="information-theory"><span>Information Theory</span><a href="#information-theory"><i></i></a></h2><p>Imagine you want to communicate to your friend the outcome of some random events, like the outcome of a dice roll or the winner of a lottery, but you want to do it with the fewest number of bits (only 1s and 0s) as possible. How few bits could you use?</p><p>The creator of Information Theory, Claude Shannon, was trying to answer questions such as these during his time at Bell labs. He was developing the mathematical foundations of communication and compression, and eventually he discovered that the minimum number of bits required for a message was directly related to the uncertainty of the message. He was able to then formulate an equation to quantify the uncertainty of a message. When he shared it with his physicist colleague at Bell Labs, John von Neumann, von Neumann suggested calling it <em>entropy</em> for two reasons:</p><blockquote><p>Von Neumann, Shannon reports, suggested that there were two good reasons for calling the function “entropy”. “It is already in use under that name,” he is reported to have said, “and besides, it will give you a great edge in debates because nobody really knows what entropy is anyway.” Shannon called the function “entropy” and used it as a measure of “uncertainty,” interchanging the two words in his writings without discrimination.<br> — <em>Harold A. Johnson (ed.),</em> <em>Heat Transfer, Thermodynamics and Education: Boelter Anniversary Volume</em> (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1964), p. 354.</p></blockquote><p>Later we will see that the relationship between Shannon’s entropy and the pre-existing definition of entropy was more than coincidental, they are deeply intertwined.</p><p>But now let us see how Shannon found definitions for these usually vague terms of “information” and “uncertainty”.</p><p>In Information Theory, the information of an observed state is formally defined as the number of bits needed to communicate that state (at least for a system with equally likely outcomes with powers of two, we’ll see shortly how to generalize this). Here are some examples of information:</p><ul><li>If I flip a fair coin, it will take one bit of information to tell you the outcome: I use a <code>0</code> for head and a <code>1</code> for tails.</li><li>If I roll a fair 8-sided dice, I can represent the outcome with 3 bits: I use <code>000</code> for a 1, <code>001</code> for 2, <code>010</code> for 3, etc.</li></ul><p>The more outcomes a system can have, the more bits (information) it will require to represent its outcome. If a system has $N$ equally likely outcomes, then it will take $\text{log}_2(N)$ bits of information to represent an outcome of that system.</p><p>Entropy is defined as the expected number of bits of information needed to represent the state of a system (this is a lie, but it’s the most useful definition for the moment, we’ll fix it later). So the entropy of a coin is 1 since on average we expect it to take 1 bit of information to represent the outcome of the coin. An 8-sided dice will have an entropy of 3 bits, since we expect it to take an average of 3 bits to represent the outcome.</p><p>It initially seems that entropy is an unnecessary definition since we can just look at how many bits it takes to represent the outcome of our system and use that value, but this is only true when the chance of the outcomes are all equally likely.</p><p>Imagine now that I have a weighted 8-sided dice, so the number 7 comes up $50$% of the time while the rest of the faces come up $\approx 7.14$% of the time. Now, if we are clever, we can reduce the expected number of bits needed to communicate the outcome of the dice. We can decide to represent a 7 with a <code>0</code>, and all the other numbers will be represented with <code>1XXX</code> where the <code>X</code>s are some unique bits. This would mean that $50$% percent of the time we only have to use 1 bit of information to represent the outcome, and the other $50$% of the time we use 4 bits, so the expected number of bits (the entropy of the dice) is 2.5. This is lower than the 3 bits of entropy for the fair 8-sided dice.</p><p>Fortunately, we don’t need to come up with a clever encoding scheme for every possible system, there exists a pattern to how many bits of information it takes to represent a state with probability $p$. We know if $p=0.5$ such as in the case of a coin landing on heads, then it takes 1 bit of information to represent that outcome. If $p=0.125$ such as in the case of a fair 8-sided dice landing on the number 5, it takes 3 bits of information to represent that outcome. If $p=0.5$ such as in the case of our unfair 8-sided dice landing on the number 7, then it takes 1 bit of information, just like the coin, which shows us that all that matters is the probability of the outcome. With this, we can discover an equation for the number of bits of information needed for a state with probability $p$.</p><p>\[I(p) = -\text{log}_2(p)\]</p><p>This value $I$ is usually called <em>information content</em> or <em>surprise</em>, since the lower the probability of a state occurring, the higher the surprise when it does occur.</p><p>When the probability is low, the surprise is high, and when the probability is high, the surprise is low. This is a more general formula then “the number of bits needed” since it allows for states that are exceptionally likely (such as $99$% likely) to have surprise less then 1, which would make less sense if we tried to interpret the value as “the number of needed bits to represent the outcome”.</p><p>And now we can fix our definition of entropy (the lie I told earlier). Entropy is not necessarily the expected number of bits used to represent a system (although it is when you use an optimal encoding scheme), but more generally the entropy is the expected <em>surprise</em> of the system.</p><p>And now we can calculate the entropy of systems like a dice or a coin or any system with known probabilities for its outcomes. The expected surprise (entropy) of a system with $N$ possible outcomes each with probability $p_i$ (all adding up to 1) can be calculated as</p><p>\[\begin{align} \sum_{i=1}^{N} p_i \cdot I(p_i) = - \sum_{i=1}^{N} p_i \cdot \text{log}_2(p_i)\label{shannon_entropy}\tag{Shannon entropy}\\ \end{align}\]</p><p>And notice that if all the $N$ probabilities are the same (so $p_i = \frac{1}{N}$), then the entropy equation can simplify to</p><p>\[- \sum_{i=1}^{N} p_i \cdot \text{log}_2(p_i) \Rightarrow \text{log}_2(N)\]</p><p>Here are some basic examples using $\eqref{shannon_entropy}$.</p><ul><li>The entropy of a fair coin is</li></ul><p>\[- ( 0.5 \cdot \text{log}_2(0.5) + 0.5 \cdot \text{log}_2(0.5)) = \text{log}_2(2) = 1\]</p><ul><li>The entropy of a fair 8-sided dice is</li></ul><p>\[- \sum_{i=1}^{8} 0.125 \cdot \text{log}_2(0.125) = \text{log}_2(8) = 3\]</p><ul><li>The entropy of an unfair 8-sided dice, where the dice lands on one face $99$% of the time and lands on the other faces the remaining $1$% of the time with equal probability (about $0.14$% each), is</li></ul><p>\[- (0.99 \cdot \text{log}_2(0.99) + \sum_{i=1}^{7} 0.0014 \cdot \text{log}_2(0.0014)) = 0.10886668511648723\]</p><p>Hopefully it is a bit more intuitive now that entropy represents uncertainty. An 8-sided dice would have higher entropy than a coin since we are more uncertain about the outcome of the 8-sided dice than we are about the coin (8 equally likely outcomes are more uncertain than only 2 equally likely outcomes). But a highly unfair 8-sided dice has less entropy than even a coin since we have very high certainty about the outcome of the unfair dice. Now we have an actual equation to quantify that uncertainty (entropy) about a system.</p><p>It is not clear right now how this definition of entropy has anything to do with disorder, heat, or time, but this idea of entropy as uncertainty is fundamental to understanding the entropy of the universe which we will explore shortly. For reference, this definition of entropy is called Shannon entropy.</p><p>We will move on now, but I recommend looking further into Information Theory. It has many important direct implications for data compression, error correction, cryptography, and even linguistics, and touches nearly any field that deals with uncertainty, signals, or knowledge.</p><h2 id="physical-entropy"><span>Physical Entropy</span><a href="#physical-entropy"><i></i></a></h2><p>Now we will see entropy from a very different lens, that of Statistical Mechanics. We begin with the tried-and-true introduction to entropy which every student is given.</p><h3 id="balls-in-a-box"><span>Balls in a box</span><a href="#balls-in-a-box"><i></i></a></h3><p>I shall give you a box with 10 balls in it, $p_0$ through $p_9$, and we will count how many balls are on the left side of the box and on the right side of the box. Assume every ball is equally likely to be on either side. Immediately we can see it is highly unlikely that we count all the balls are on the left side of the box, and more likely that we count an equal number of balls on each side. Why is that?</p><p>Well, there is only one state in which we count all the balls on the left, and that is if every ball is on the left (truly astounding, but stay with me). But there are many ways in which the box is balanced: We could have $p_0$ through $p_4$ one side and the rest on the other, or the same groups but flipped from left to right, or we could have all the even balls on one side and the odd on the other, or again flipped, or any of the other many possible combinations.</p><p>This box is a system that we can measure the entropy of, at least once I tell you how many balls are counted on each side. It can take a moment to see, but imagine the box with our left and right counts as a system where the outcome will be finding out where all the individual balls are in the box, similar to rolling a dice and seeing which face it lands on.</p><p>This would mean that the box where we count all the balls on the left side only has one possible outcome: all the balls are on the left side. We would take this to mean that this system has $0$ entropy (no expected surprise) since we already know where we will find each individual ball.</p><p>The box with balanced sides (5 on each) has many possible equally likely outcomes, and in fact, we can count them. A famous equation in combinatorics is the N-choose-k equation, which calculates exactly this scenario. It tells us that there are 252 possible ways in which we can place 5 balls on each side. The entropy for this system would then be $- \sum_{i=1}^{252} \frac{1}{252} \cdot \text{log}_2(\frac{1}{252}) = \text{log}_2(252) = 7.9772799235$. This is the same as calculating the entropy of a 252-sided dice.</p><p>And if we were to increase the number of balls, the entropy of the balanced box would increase since there would then be even more possible combinations that could make up a balanced box.</p><p>We should interpret these results as: The larger the number of ways there are to satisfy the large-scale measurement (counting the number of balls on each side), the higher the entropy of the system. When all the balls are on the left, there is only one way to satisfy that measurement and so it has a low entropy. When there are many ways to balance it on both sides, it has high entropy.</p><p>Here we see 1000 balls bouncing around in a box. They will all start on the left, so the box would have 0 entropy, but once the balls start crossing to the right and changing the count on each side, the entropy will increase.</p><p><a href="https://jasonfantl.com/assets/img/posts/Entropy/2_cell_box.gif"><img data-src="/assets/img/posts/Entropy/2_cell_box.gif" alt=" balls in a box with its entropy " width="300" data-proofer-ignore=""></a></p><p>In Statistical Mechanics, the formal term for the large-scale measurement is the <em>macrostate</em>, and the specific states that can satisfy that measurement are <em>microstates</em>. We would call the measurement of the number of balls on each side of the box the macrostate, and the different combinations of positions of individual balls the microstates. So rephrasing the above: There is only one microstate representing the macrostate of all balls being counted on one side, and there are many microstates representing the macrostate of a balanced box.</p><p>But why did we decide to measure the number of balls on the left and right? We could have measured a different macrostate, and the entropy would be different.</p><h3 id="macrostates"><span>Macrostates</span><a href="#macrostates"><i></i></a></h3><p>Imagine instead of selecting the left and right halves of the box to count the number of balls, we instead count how many balls are in each pixel of the box. In this scenario, the entropy would almost always be maximized, as the balls rarely share a pixel. Even if all the balls were on the left side of the box, they would likely still each occupy a different pixel, and the measured entropy would be the same as if the balls were evenly distributed in the box.</p><p>If we use an expensive instrument to measure the box and track the balls with high precision, then the entropy would rarely change and would be very high. If we instead use an inexpensive instrument that can only tell if a ball is on the left or right of the box, then the entropy will be low and could very easily fluctuate if some of the balls temporarily end up on the same side of the box.</p><p>Let’s run exactly the same simulation of 1000 balls in the box again, still starting with the balls on the left. But, this time we count how many balls are in each cell in a 50x50 grid, as opposed to the previous two cells (the left and right cells). The entropy will be high since there are many microstates that represent a bunch of cells with only 1 ball in it, and the entropy won’t change much since two balls rarely share the same cell. Recall that if two balls share the same cell, the count would go up, and there are fewer microstates that satisfy a cell with a count of 2 compared to two cells with a count of 1 in each.</p><p><a href="https://jasonfantl.com/assets/img/posts/Entropy/50_cell_box.gif"><img data-src="/assets/img/posts/Entropy/50_cell_box.gif" alt=" balls in a box with its entropy " width="300" data-proofer-ignore=""></a></p><p>Entropy is not intrinsic to the physical system alone, but rather to our description of it as well — i.e., the macrostate we’re measuring, and the resolution at which we observe it.</p><p>This process of measuring a lower-resolution version of our system (like counting how many balls are on the left or right side of a box) is called <em>coarse-graining</em>.</p><p>How we choose/measure the macrostate, that is, how we coarse-grain the system, is dependent on the problem we are solving.</p><ul><li>Imagine you have a box of gas (like our balls in a box, but at the scale of $10^{25}$ balls in the box), and we place a temperature-reader on the left and right side of the box. This gives us a macrostate of two counts of the average ball speed on the left and right sides of the box. We can then calculate the entropy by comparing when the temperature-readers are equal to when they are different by $T$ degrees. Once we learn how time and entropy interact, we will use this model to show that the two temperature-readers are expected to converge to the same value over time.</li><li>Imagine you sequence the genome of many different people in a population, you could choose many different macrostates based on what you care about. You could count how many of each nucleotide there are in all the sequences, allowing you to quantify how variable the four nucleotides are in DNA. You could calculate the entropy of every individual position in the DNA sequence by counting how many nucleotide types are used in that position across the population, allowing you to identify portions of DNA that are constant across individuals or vary across individuals.</li></ul><p>How you choose to measure the macrostate can come in many forms for the same system, depending on what you are capable of measuring and/or what you care about measuring.</p><p>But once we have a macrostate, we need a way to identify all the microstates and assign probabilities to them.</p><h3 id="microstates"><span>Microstates</span><a href="#microstates"><i></i></a></h3><p>When we were looking at the positions of balls in a box in equally sized cells, it was easy to see that every ball was equally likely to be in any of the cells, so each microstate was equally likely. This made calculating the entropy very simple, we just used the simplified version of $\eqref{shannon_entropy}$ to find that for $W$ microstates that satisfy a given macrostate, the entropy of the system is $\text{log}_{2}(W)$. It isn’t too hard to extend this idea to microstates that are not equally likely.</p><p>For example, let’s calculate the entropy of a box with 5 balls on the left and 5 balls on the right, but we replace one of the balls in the box with a metal ball that is pulled by a magnet to the left. In this case, the probability of each microstate is no longer equally likely. If we assume there is an $80$% chance that the metal ball is on the left side instead of the right side, then the entropy of the box can be calculated as follows: For all of the 252 microstates, 126 of them have the metal ball on the left, which has a $0.8$ chance of being true, and the other 126 have the metal ball on the right with a $0.2$ chance. This means using the $\eqref{shannon_entropy}$ we get an entropy of</p><p>\[- \sum_{i=1}^{126} \frac{0.2}{126} \cdot \text{log}_2(\frac{0.2}{126}) - \sum_{i=1}^{126} \frac{0.8}{126} \cdot \text{log}_2(\frac{0.8}{126}) = 7.69921\]</p><p>This is a little less than the box with normal balls which had $7.9772799235$ entropy. This is exactly what we should expect, we are a bit more certain about the outcome of this system since we knew where one of the balls was more likely to be.</p><p>But this raises a subtle question: why did we choose this particular set of microstates? For example, if we have the macrostate of 5 balls on the left and 5 balls on the right, but we decide to use the 50x50 grid of cells to describe the microstates, then there are far more microstates that satisfy the macrostate compared to when we were using the 2x1 grid of left and right.</p><p>Let’s calculate the entropy for those two examples. Keep in mind they both have the same macrostate: 5 balls on the left and 5 balls on the right.</p><ul><li>If we choose to use the microstates of looking at the position of individual balls between two cells splitting the box in half, then we can use n-choose-k to calculate that there are 252 possible combinations of balls across the two cells. This gives us an entropy of $\text{log}_2(252) = 7.977279923$.</li><li>If we choose to use the microstates of looking at the position of individual balls between 50x50 (2500) cells splitting the box into a grid, then we can use n-choose-k to calculate that there are 252 possible combinations of balls across the two halves of the box, for each of which every ball could be in any of 50x25 (1250) cells. This gives us an entropy of $\text{log}_2(252*1250^{10}) = 110.8544037$.</li></ul><p>This result lines up very well with our Information-theoretic understanding of entropy: when we allow more microstates to represent the same macrostate, we are more uncertain about the microstate our system is in. But this result does raise some concerns.</p><p>If different microstates give different entropy, how do we choose the right microstates for our problem? Unlike the macrostate, this decision of which microstates to use is not determined by our instruments or the scope of the problem, it has to be determined by the person making the calculation. Often for physical systems people will use the set of microstates that capture all the relevant information related to the macrostate. For example, if our macrostate is about balls on the left or right side of a box, then we probably don’t care about the ball’s velocity or mass or anything else but the ball position.</p><p>Another concern is that it feels wrong that the same physical system with the same macrostate can have different entropies depending on the microstate representation we use. Usually, we expect physical systems to have invariant measurements regardless of the internal representation we decide to use for our measurement. But this is incorrect for entropy. We need to recall that entropy is the uncertainty of a system and that the definition of entropy is completely dependent on what we are uncertain about, which for physical systems are the microstates. This would be similar to someone asking “How many parts make up that machine?”, to which we should respond “How do you define a ‘part’?”. When we ask “What is the entropy of this macrostate?”, we need to respond with “What microstates are we using?”.</p><p>With all that said, there is some small truth to what our intuition is telling us, although it doesn’t apply to the general case. While the entropy of the system changes when we change the microstates, the relative differences in entropy across macrostates will be equal <em>if</em> the new microstates uniformly multiply the old microstates. That is, if each original microstate is split into the same number of refined microstates, then the entropy of every macrostate increases by a constant. We’re getting lost in the terminology, an example will demonstrate.</p><p>Let us again take the 10 balls in a box, and we will calculate the entropy of the system for a few different macrostates and microstate representations. We indicate the number of balls on each side of the box with <code>(L, R)</code>, where <code>L</code> is the number of balls on the left and <code>R</code> is the number of balls on the right. Then we calculate the entropy using the microstate of a 2x1 grid of cells (just the left and right halves of the box) and for the 50x50 grid of cells.</p><div><table><thead><tr><th>&nbsp;</th><th>(10,0)</th><th>(9,1)</th><th>(8,2)</th><th>(7,3)</th><th>(6,4)</th><th>(5,5)</th><th>(4,6)</th><th>(3,7)</th><th>(2,8)</th><th>(1,9)</th><th>(0,10)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>2x1</td><td>0.00000</td><td>3.32193</td><td>5.49185</td><td>6.90689</td><td>7.71425</td><td>7.97728</td><td>7.71425</td><td>6.90689</td><td>5.49185</td><td>3.32193</td><td>0.00000</td></tr><tr><td>50x50</td><td>102.87712</td><td>106.19905</td><td>108.36898</td><td>109.78401</td><td>110.59137</td><td>110.85440</td><td>110.59137</td><td>109.78401</td><td>108.36898</td><td>106.19905</td><td>102.87712</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>And if we look, we will see that the entropy in the 50x50 grid microstate values is just the 2x1 grid values plus a constant. The relative entropy in both cases would be identical. This is even more clear if we mathematically show how the entropy is calculated. For the 2x1 grid we use the equation $\text{log}_2({10 \choose L})$, and for the 50x50 grid we use $\text{log}_2(1250^{10} {10 \choose L}) = \text{log}_2(1250^{10}) + \text{log}_2({10 \choose L})$. Mathematically we can see that it is the same as the entropy of the 2x1 grid offset by $\text{log}_2(1250^{10})$.</p><p>You can imagine if we added another dimension along the microstates that we would increase the entropy again by a constant. For example, if each of the 10 balls could be one of 3 colors, then the number of microstates would grow by a factor of $3^{10}$, and so the entropy of the whole system would increase by $\text{log}_2(3^{10})$.</p><p>Our intuition was correct when we used different microstates that are multiples of each other, but that intuition fails if the microstates are not so neatly multiples of each other. An easy example of this is if we represent the left side of the box as one cell and the right as a 50x25 grid of cells, then the entropy looks very different. Below is the table again, but with the added row of our non-homogenous microstates. An example of how we calculate the entropy of macrostate $(3, 7)$ is: there are 120 equally likely ways to place 3 balls on the left and 7 balls on the right, but the balls on the right can also be in $1250^7$ different states, so the entropy is $\text{log}_2(120 \cdot 1250^7) = 78.920877252$.</p><div><table><thead><tr><th>&nbsp;</th><th>(10,0)</th><th>(9,1)</th><th>(8,2)</th><th>(7,3)</th><th>(6,4)</th><th>(5,5)</th><th>(4,6)</th><th>(3,7)</th><th>(2,8)</th><th>(1,9)</th><th>(0,10)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>2x1</td><td>0.00000</td><td>3.32193</td><td>5.49185</td><td>6.90689</td><td>7.71425</td><td>7.97728</td><td>7.71425</td><td>6.90689</td><td>5.49185</td><td>3.32193</td><td>0.00000</td></tr><tr><td>50x50</td><td>102.87712</td><td>106.19905</td><td>108.36898</td><td>109.78401</td><td>110.59137</td><td>110.85440</td><td>110.59137</td><td>109.78401</td><td>108.36898</td><td>106.19905</td><td>102.87712</td></tr><tr><td>mixed</td><td>0.00000</td><td>13.60964</td><td>26.06728</td><td>37.77003</td><td>48.86510</td><td>59.41584</td><td>69.44052</td><td>78.92088</td><td>87.79355</td><td>95.91134</td><td>102.87712</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>A funny thing to note is that when all the balls are on the left, the entropy is zero, but when all the balls are on the right, the entropy is maximized. And again, hopefully, this makes sense from our understanding of entropy, that it measures uncertainty relative to our microstates. If we know all the balls are on the left, then we know they must be in the single left cell, so no uncertainty. If we know the balls are all on the right, then they could be in any of $1250^{10}$ microstates, so high uncertainty.</p><p>Clearly, we need to be careful and aware of what microstates we are choosing when measuring the entropy of a system. Fortunately, for most physical systems we use the standard microstates of a uniform grid of positions and momentums of the balls (particles) in the system. Another standard microstate to use is the continuous space of position and momentum.</p><h3 id="continuous-microstates"><span>Continuous Microstates</span><a href="#continuous-microstates"><i></i></a></h3><p>So far, we’ve looked at discrete sets of microstates — such as balls in cells. But in physical systems, microstates are often continuous: positions and momenta can vary over a continuum. How do we compute entropy in this setting? This is not related to the rest of the explanation, but it is an interesting tangent to explore.</p><p>Let’s return to our 10 balls in a 2D box. If each ball can occupy any position in the square, then the microstate of the system is a point in a $20$-dimensional space (2 dimensions per ball). The number of possible microstates is infinite — and each individual one has infinitesimal probability.</p><p>In this setting, we use a probability density function $\rho(x)$, and entropy becomes a continuous integral:</p><p>\[S = - \int_X \rho(x) \log_2 \rho(x) \, dx\]</p><p>This is called differential entropy. It generalizes Shannon entropy to continuous systems, though it has some subtleties — it can be negative, and it’s not invariant under coordinate transformations.</p><p>If the density is uniform, say $\rho(x) = \frac{1}{V}$ over a region of volume $V$, then the entropy becomes:</p><p>\[S = - \int_X \frac{1}{V} \log_2 \left( \frac{1}{V} \right) dx = \log_2(V)\]</p><p>So entropy still grows with the logarithm of the accessible state volume, just as in the discrete case.</p><p>This formalism is particularly natural in quantum mechanics, where the wavefunction $\psi(x)$ defines a probability density $\rho(x) = |\psi(x)|^2$. Consider a 1D Gaussian wavefunction:</p><p>\[\psi(x) = \left( \frac{1}{\pi \sigma^2} \right)^{1/4} e^{-x^2 / (2 \sigma^2)}\]</p><p>Its entropy (in bits) is:</p><p>\[S = - \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \rho(x) \log_2 \rho(x) \, dx = \frac{1}{2} \log_2(2 \pi e \sigma^2)\]</p><p>This shows that wider distributions have higher entropy, as expected: a more spread-out wavefunction indicates more uncertainty in the particle’s location.</p><p>For instance:</p><ul><li>If $\sigma = 1$, then $S \approx 2.047$</li><li>If $\sigma = 3$, then $S \approx 3.600$</li></ul><p>Which again should make sense: When we are less certain about a system, like where a particle will be when measured, the more entropy it has.</p><p>And a quick issue to address: If the state space is unbounded, like momentum in classical mechanics, then the entropy can diverge. This isn’t a problem in practice because physical systems typically have probability distributions (like Gaussians) that decay quickly enough at infinity to keep the entropy finite. When that’s not the case, we either limit the system to a finite region or focus on entropy differences, which remain well-defined even when absolute entropy diverges.</p><p>But let’s get back to our main topic, and we’ll get back into it with a historical overview.</p><h3 id="standard-usage-of-entropy"><span>Standard Usage of Entropy</span><a href="#standard-usage-of-entropy"><i></i></a></h3><p>Eighty years before Claude Shannon developed Information Theory, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Boltzmann">Ludwig Boltzmann</a> formulated a statistical definition of entropy for an ideal gas. He proposed that the entropy $S$ of a system is proportional to the logarithm of the number of microstates $W$ consistent with a given macrostate:</p><p>\[\begin{align} S = k_{B} \ln(W) \label{boltzmann_entropy}\tag{Boltzmann entropy} \end{align}\]</p><p>This equation should look familiar: it’s the equal-probability special case of the Shannon entropy we’ve been using, just with a change of base (from $\log_2$ to $\ln$) and a scaling factor $k_B$ (Boltzmann’s constant). The connection between Boltzmann’s statistical mechanics and Shannon’s information theory is more than historical coincidence—both quantify uncertainty, whether in physical states or messages.</p><p>A few years later, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josiah_Willard_Gibbs">Josiah Willard Gibbs</a> generalized Boltzmann’s definition to cases where microstates are not equally likely. His formulation remains the standard definition of entropy in modern physics:</p><p>\[\begin{align} S = -k_B \sum_{i} p_i \ln(p_i) \label{gibbs_entropy}\tag{Gibbs entropy} \end{align}\]</p><p>This is formally identical to Shannon entropy, again differing only in logarithm base and physical units. But Gibbs’s generalization was a profound leap: it enabled thermodynamics to describe systems in contact with heat baths, particle reservoirs, and other environments where probability distributions over microstates are non-uniform. This made entropy applicable far beyond ideal gases—covering chemical reactions, phase transitions, and statistical ensembles of all kinds.</p><p>Now that we have a formal understanding of entropy with some historical background, let’s try to understand how entropy relates to our universe and in particular to time.</p><h3 id="time"><span>Time</span><a href="#time"><i></i></a></h3><p>How does time play a role in all of this?</p><p>When you drop a spot of milk into tea, it always spreads and mixes, and yet you never see the reverse where the milk molecules spontaneously separate and return to a neat droplet. When ocean waves crash into the shore, the spray and foam disperse, but we never see that chaos reassemble into a coherent wave that launches back into the sea. These examples are drawn from this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROrovyJXSnM">lecture on entropy</a> by Richard Feynman. If you were shown a reversed video of these events, you’d immediately recognize something was off. This sounds obvious at first, but it actually isn’t clear this should be true if we just look at the laws of physics. All the known laws of physics are time-reversible (the wave function collapse seems to be debatable), which just means that they <em>do</em> look the same playing forward and backward. The individual molecules all obey these time-reversible laws, and yet the cup of tea gets murky from the milk always mixing in.</p><p>This highlights a fundamental paradox: the microscopic laws of physics are time-reversible, but the macroscopic world is not. If you took a video of two atoms bouncing off each other and played it backward, it would still look physically valid, but play a video of milk mixing into coffee backward, and it looks obviously wrong.</p><p>We want to build a simplified model of time in a way that reflects both the time-reversibility of microscopic laws and the time-asymmetry of macroscopic behavior. Let’s imagine the complete state of a physical system, like a box of particles, as a single point in a high-dimensional space called phase space, with each dimension corresponding to a particle’s position and momentum. As time evolves, the system traces out a continuous trajectory through this space.</p><p>The laws of physics, such as Newton’s equations, Hamiltonian mechanics, or Schrödinger’s equation, all govern this trajectory. They are deterministic and time-reversible. That means if you reverse the momenta of all particles at any moment, the system will retrace its path backward through state space.</p><p>So far everything is time-reversible, including this view of how the universe moves through time. But we will see that even in this toy model, time appears to have a preferred direction, an <em>arrow of time</em>.</p><p>The key lies in coarse-graining. When we observe the world, we don’t see every microscopic detail. Instead, we measure macrostates: aggregate properties like temperature, pressure, position of an object, or color distribution in a cup of tea. Each macrostate corresponds to many underlying microstates — and not all macrostates are created equal.</p><p>For example, consider a box sliding across the floor and coming to rest due to friction. At the microscopic level, the system is just particles exchanging momentum, and all time-reversible. But we certainly would not call this action time-reversible, we never see a box spontaneously start speeding up from stand-still. But, if we took the moment after the box comes to a rest due to friction, and you reversed the velocities of all the particles (including those in the floor that absorbed the box’s kinetic energy as heat), the box <em>would</em> spontaneously start moving and slide back to its original position. This would obey Newton’s laws, but it’s astronomically unlikely. Why?</p><p>The number of microstates where the energy is spread out as heat (the box is at rest, and the molecules in the floor are jiggling) vastly outnumber the microstates where all that energy is coordinated to move the box. The stand-still macrostate has high entropy while the spontaneous-movement macrostate has low entropy. When the system evolves randomly or deterministically from low entropy, it is overwhelmingly likely to move toward higher entropy simply because there are more such microstates.</p><p>If you had perfect knowledge of all particles in the universe (i.e., you lived at the level of microstates), time wouldn’t seem to have a direction. But from the perspective of a coarse-grained observer, like us, entropy tends to increase. And that’s why a movie of tea mixing looks natural, but the reverse looks fake. At the level of physical laws, both are valid. But one is typical, and one is astronomically rare, all because we coarse-grained.</p><p>To drive the point home, let’s again look at the balls in a box. We’ll define macrostates by dividing the box into a grid of cells and counting how many balls are in each bin.</p><p>Now suppose the balls move via random small jitters (our toy model of microscopic dynamics). Over time, the system will naturally tend to explore the most probable macrostates, as the most probable macrostates have far more microstates for you to wander into. That is, entropy increases over time, not because of any fundamental irreversibility in the laws, but because high-entropy macrostates are far more typical.</p><p>If we started the simulation with all the balls packed on the left, that’s a very specific (low entropy) macrostate. As they spread out, the number of compatible microstates grows, and so does the entropy.</p><p>This leads to a crucial realization: Entropy increases because we started in a low-entropy state. This is often called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Past_hypothesis">Past Hypothesis</a>, the postulate that the universe began in an extremely low-entropy state. Given that, the Second Law of Thermodynamics follows naturally. The arrow of time emerges not from the dynamics themselves, but from the statistical unlikelihood of reversing them after coarse-graining, and the fact that we began in a low-entropy state.</p><p>You could imagine once a system reaches near-maximum entropy that it no longer looks time-irreversible. The entropy of such a system would <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluctuation_theorem">fluctuate a tiny bit</a> since entropy is an inherently statistical measure, but they would be small enough not to notice. For example, while it is clear when a video of milk being poured into tea (a low-entropy macrostate) is playing forward as opposed to backward, you couldn’t tell if a video of already-combined milk and tea (a high-entropy macrostate) being swirled around is playing forward or backward.</p><p>While there are tiny fluctuations in entropy, they are not enough to explain the large-scale phenomena that sometimes seem to violate this principle that we just established of entropy always increasing with time.</p><h3 id="violations-of-the-second-law"><span>Violations of the Second Law?</span><a href="#violations-of-the-second-law"><i></i></a></h3><p>Some real-world examples seem to contradict the claim that entropy always increases. For instance, oil and water separate after mixing, dust clumps into stars and planets, and we build machines like filters and refrigerators that separate mixed substances. Aren’t these violations?</p><p>The issue is we have only been considering the position of molecules, while physical systems have many different properties which allow for more microstates. For example, if we start considering both the position and velocity of balls in a box, then the entropy can be high even while all the balls are on the left side of the box since every ball could have a different velocity. If the balls were all on the left <em>and</em> the velocities were all the same, then the entropy would be low. Once we consider velocity as well, entropy can increase both from more spread out positions and more spread out velocities.</p><p>When water and oil separate, the positions of the molecules separate into top and bottom, which appears to decrease positional entropy. However, this separation actually increases the total entropy of the system. Why? Water molecules strongly prefer to form hydrogen bonds with other water molecules rather than interact with oil molecules. When water molecules are forced to be near oil molecules in a mixed state, they must adopt more constrained arrangements to minimize unfavorable interactions, reducing the number of available microstates. When water and oil separate, water molecules can interact freely with other water molecules in more configurations, and oil molecules can interact with other oil molecules more freely. This increase in available microstates for molecular arrangements and interactions more than compensates for the decrease in positional mixing entropy. So, while the entropy decreases if we only consider the general positions of molecules (mixed versus separated), the total entropy increases when we account for all the molecular interactions, orientations, and local arrangements. This demonstrates why we need to consider all properties of a system when calculating its entropy.</p><p>When stars or planets form together from dust particles floating around in space and clump together from gravity, it would seem that even when we consider position and velocity of the particles that the entropy might be decreasing. Even though the particles speed up to clump together, they slow down after they collide, seemingly decreasing entropy. This is because we are again failing to consider the entire system. When particles collide with each other, their speed decreases a bit by turning that kinetic energy into radiation, causing photons to get sent out into space. If we considered a system where radiation isn’t allowed, then the kinetic energy would just get transferred from one particle to another through changes in velocity, and the entropy of the system would still be increasing because of the faster velocities. Once we start considering the entropy of the position, velocity, and <em>all</em> particles in a system, we can consider <em>all</em> the microstates that are equally likely and calculate the correct entropy.</p><p>Similarly, once we consider the entire system around a refrigerator, the decrease in entropy disappears. The entropy from the power generated to run the refrigerator and the heat moved from the inside to the outside of the refrigerator will offset the decrease in entropy caused by cooling the inside of the refrigerator. Local decreases in entropy <em>can</em> be generated, as long as the entropy of the entire system is still increasing.</p><p>Ensure that the entire system is being considered when analyzing the entropy of a system, with the position, velocity, other interactions of particles, that all particles are included, and that the entire system is actually being analyzed.</p><h3 id="disorder"><span>Disorder</span><a href="#disorder"><i></i></a></h3><p>Entropy is sometimes described as “disorder,” but this analogy is imprecise and often misleading. In statistical mechanics, entropy has a rigorous definition: it quantifies the number of microstates compatible with a given macrostate. That is, entropy measures our uncertainty about the exact microscopic configuration of a system given some coarse-grained, macroscopic description.</p><p>So where does the idea of “disorder” come from?</p><p>Empirically, macrostates we label as “disordered” often correspond to a vastly larger number of microstates than those we consider “ordered”. For example, in a child’s room, there are many more configurations where toys are scattered randomly than ones where everything is neatly shelved. Since the scattered room corresponds to more microstates, it has higher entropy.</p><p>But this connection between entropy and disorder is not fundamental. The problem is that “disorder” is subjective—it depends on human perception, context, and labeling. For instance, in our earlier example of 1000 balls bouncing around a box, a perfectly uniform grid of balls would have high entropy due to the huge number of possible microstates realizing it. And yet to a human observer, such a grid might appear highly “ordered.”</p><p>The key point is: entropy is objective and well-defined given a macrostate and a set of microstates, while “disorder” is a human-centric heuristic concept that sometimes, but not always, tracks entropy. Relying on “disorder” to explain entropy risks confusion, especially in systems where visual symmetry or regularity masks the underlying statistical structure.</p><h2 id="conclusion"><span>Conclusion</span><a href="#conclusion"><i></i></a></h2><p>So here are some thoughts in regard to some common statements made about entropy:</p><ul><li>Entropy is a measure of disorder.<ul><li>“disorder” is a subjective term for states of a system that humans don’t find useful/nice, and usually has much higher entropy than the “ordered” macrostate that humans create. Because of this, when entropy increases, it is more likely that we end up in disordered state, although not guaranteed.</li></ul></li><li>Entropy always increases in a closed system.<ul><li>This is a statistical statement that for all practical purposes is true, but is not guaranteed and can fail when you look at very small isolated systems or measure down to the smallest details of a system. It also assumes you started in a low-entropy state, giving your system space to increase in entropy. This has the neat implication that since our universe has been observed to be increasing in entropy, it must have begun in a low-entropy state.</li></ul></li><li>Heat flows from hot to cold because of entropy.<ul><li>Heat flows from hot to cold because the number of ways in which the system can be non-uniform in temperature is much lower than the number of ways it can be uniform in temperature, and so as the system “randomly” moves to new states, it will statistically end up in states that are more uniform.</li></ul></li><li>Entropy is the only time-irreversible law of physics.<ul><li>All the fundamental laws of physics are time-reversible, but by coarse-graining and starting from a lower-entropy state, a system will statistically move to a higher-entropy state. This means if a system is already in a near-maximum entropy state (either because of its configuration or because of the choice for coarse-graining) or we don’t coarse-grain, then entropy will not look time-irreversible.</li></ul></li></ul><p>And here is some further reading, all of which I found supremely helpful in learning about entropy.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROrovyJXSnM">Lecture on entropy by Richard Feynman</a></li><li><a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/schwartz/files/6-entropy.pdf">Lecture notes on entropy from the Statistical Mechanics course at Harvard taught by Matthew Schwartz</a></li><li><a href="https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/what_is_entropy.pdf">A both friendly and rigorous textbook on entropy by John C.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>

			<div>
				
<div><p>Dear Members of the Harvard Community,</p><p>&nbsp;For three-quarters of a century, the federal government has awarded grants and contracts to Harvard and other universities to help pay for work that, along with investments by the universities themselves, has led to groundbreaking innovations across a wide range of medical, engineering, and scientific fields. These innovations have made countless people in our country and throughout the world healthier and safer. In recent weeks, the federal government has threatened its partnerships with several universities, including Harvard, over accusations of antisemitism on our campuses. These partnerships are among the most productive and beneficial in American history. New frontiers beckon us with the prospect of life-changing advances—from treatments for diseases such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and diabetes, to breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, quantum science and engineering, and numerous other areas of possibility. For the government to retreat from these partnerships now risks not only the health and well-being of millions of individuals but also the economic security and vitality of our nation.</p><p>&nbsp;Late Friday night, the administration issued an updated and expanded list of demands, warning that Harvard must comply if we intend to “maintain [our] financial relationship with the federal government.” It makes clear that the intention is not to work with us to address antisemitism in a cooperative and constructive manner. Although some of the demands outlined by the government are aimed at combating antisemitism, the majority represent direct governmental regulation of the “intellectual conditions” at Harvard.</p><p>&nbsp;I encourage you to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.harvard.edu/research-funding/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2025/04/Letter-Sent-to-Harvard-2025-04-11.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">read the letter</a>&nbsp;to gain a fuller understanding of the unprecedented demands being made by the federal government to control the Harvard community. They include requirements to “audit” the viewpoints of our student body, faculty, staff, and to “reduc[e] the power” of certain students, faculty, and administrators targeted because of their ideological views. We have informed the administration through our legal counsel that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.harvard.edu/research-funding/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2025/04/Harvard-Response-2025-04-14.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we will not accept their proposed agreement</a>. The University will not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights.</p><p>&nbsp;The administration’s prescription goes beyond the power of the federal government. It violates Harvard’s First Amendment rights and exceeds the statutory limits of the government’s authority under Title VI. And it threatens our values as a private institution devoted to the pursuit, production, and dissemination of knowledge. No government—regardless of which party is in power—should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue.</p><p>&nbsp;Our motto—Veritas, or truth—guides us as we navigate the challenging path ahead. Seeking truth is a journey without end. It requires us to be open to new information and different perspectives, to subject our beliefs to ongoing scrutiny, and to be ready to change our minds. It compels us to take up the difficult work of acknowledging our flaws so that we might realize the full promise of the University, especially when that promise is threatened.</p><p>&nbsp;We have made it abundantly clear that we do not take lightly our moral duty to fight antisemitism. Over the past fifteen months, we have taken many steps to address antisemitism on our campus. We plan to do much more. As we defend Harvard, we will continue to:&nbsp;</p></div>



<ul>
<li>nurture a thriving culture of open inquiry on our campus; develop the tools, skills, and practices needed to engage constructively with one another; and broaden the intellectual and viewpoint diversity within our community;&nbsp;</li>



<li>affirm the rights and responsibilities we share; respect free speech and dissent while also ensuring that protest occurs in a time, place, and manner that does not interfere with teaching, learning, and research; and enhance the consistency and fairness of disciplinary processes; and&nbsp;</li>



<li>work together to find ways, consistent with law, to foster and support a vibrant community that exemplifies, respects, and embraces difference. As we do, we will also continue to comply with&nbsp;<em>Students For Fair Admissions v. Harvard</em>, which ruled that Title VI of the Civil Rights Act makes it unlawful for universities to make decisions “on the basis of race.”&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<div><p>These ends will not be achieved by assertions of power, unmoored from the law, to control teaching and learning at Harvard and to dictate how we operate. The work of addressing our shortcomings, fulfilling our commitments, and embodying our values is ours to define and undertake as a community. Freedom of thought and inquiry, along with the government’s longstanding commitment to respect and protect it, has enabled universities to contribute in vital ways to a free society and to healthier, more prosperous lives for people everywhere. All of us share a stake in safeguarding that freedom. We proceed now, as always, with the conviction that the fearless and unfettered pursuit of truth liberates humanity—and with faith in the enduring promise that America’s colleges and universities hold for our country and our world.</p><p>&nbsp;Sincerely,<br>Alan M. Garber</p></div>

The clients will therefore end up with the content exactly when they were supposed to show it, and therefore they would have no time to forward it to anyone else, lest that downstream would get the content AFTER they were supposed to show it.</p></div></td></tr>

As you say, there are some latency pitfalls you'll have to avoid, but that's nothing you can't hack yourself out of.</p><p>Livestreaming is a different beast. As you say, the problem with livestreaming is that everyone needs the same content at the same time. If I spend 200ms downloading the next 500ms worth of content, then there's nobody to share it with, they all spent the 200ms doing the same. BitTorrent relies on the time shift that is allowed between me downloading the content and you requesting it. If you request it before I've got it, well I can't fulfil that request, only the guy I intend to get it from can.</p><p>If you wanted to implement something like that, you would probably pick a tree of seeders where the protocol would pick a subset of trusted nodes that it would upload the content to before then allowing them to seed it, and the have them doing the same recursively.</p><p>That would obviously introduce a bunch of complexity and latency, and would very much not be BitTorrent anymore.</p></div></td></tr>

Ping times are 100ms or more across the ocean, there will be some random packets lost, but ping times within the UK are around 15ms max. By working co-operatively and sharing among themselves the clients in one cluster can fill in missing packets from a different cluster far quicker than the requesting them from the originating host.</p><p>In general, the ability to request missing packets from a more local source should be able to improve overall video call quality. It still might be "too late", because for minimal latency, you might choose to use packets as soon as they arrive and maybe even treat out-of-order packets as missing, and just display a blockier video instead, but if the clients can tolerate a little more latency (maybe a tunable setting, like 50ms more than the best case) then it should in theory work better than current systems.</p><p>I've been mulling over some of these ideas myself in the past, but it's never been high enough on my TODO list to try anything out.</p></div></td></tr>

If the nodes operate independently from one another (which they would, being non-cooperating) they'd all get a response in ~100ms (computation and signaling time is negligible here), which is faster than they could get it cooperatively, even if we assume perfect cooperation (100ms for the first local node + 15ms from there). It's parallelism. Doing less work might seem theoretically nice, but if you have the capacity to do the same work twice simultaneously you avoid the synchronization.</p><p>Basically, it falls somewhere in my loose "tree based system" sketch. In this case the "trusted" nodes would be picked based on ping time clustering, but the basic sketch that you pick a subset of nodes to be your local nodes and then let that structure recursively play out is the same.</p><p>The problem you run into is latency. There's no good way to pick a global latency figure for the whole network, since it varies by how deep into the tree you are. As the tree grows deeper, you end up having to retune the delay. The only other option is to grow in width at which point you've just created a another linear growth problem, albeit with a lower slope.</p></div></td></tr>

                  <p>The biggest issue I've seen with these is the networking limitations in a browser - there might be hundreds of seeders for a video and using a normal streaming torrent video player works well, but as torrent clients in the browser need to use WebRTC / WebTorrent, there might be just 0-5 seeders supporting it. I don't see much adoption for WebTorrents before the widely used standard Bittorrent clients support the protocol.</p>

We will also provide pluggable content discovery mechanisms as well as a lightweight content tracker implementation.</p><p>There is an experimental tracker here: <a href="https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh-experiments/tree/main/content-discovery">https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh-experiments/tree/main/co...</a></p><p>Due to the properties of the BLAKE3 tree hash you can start sharing content even before you have completely downloaded it, so blobs is very well suited to the use case described above.</p><p>We already did a few explorations regarding media streaming over iroh connections, see for example <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3qqyu1mmGQ" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3qqyu1mmGQ</a> .</p><p>The big advantage of iroh over bittorrent is that content can be shared efficiently from even behind routers that don't allow manual or automatic port mapping, such as many carrier grade NAT setups.</p><p>Another advantage that BLAKE3 has over the bittorrent protocol is that content is verified <i>incrementally</i>. If somebody sends you wrong data you will notice after at most ~16 KiB. Bittorrent has something similar in the form of piece hashes, but those are more coarse grained. Also, BLAKE3 is extremely fast due to a very SIMD friendly design.</p><p>We are big fans of bittorrent and actually use parts of bittorrent, the mainline DHT, for our node discovery.</p><p>Here is a talk from last year explaining how iroh works in detail: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj-7Y_7p4Dg" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj-7Y_7p4Dg</a> , also briefly covering the blobs protocol.</p></div></td></tr>

The interesting question is why didn’t it take off—especially when the technology was there.</p><p>One possibility as you allude to is licensing. In a P2P streaming model “rights” holders want to collect royalties on content distribution. I’m not sure of a way you could make this feel legal short of abolishing copyright, but if you could build a way to fairly collect royalties, I wonder if you’d make inroads with enforcers. But overall that problem seems to have been solved with ads and subscription fees.</p><p>Another data point is that the behemoths decided to serve content digitally. Netflix and Spotify showed up. The reason the general population torrented music is because other than a CD changer, having a digital library was a requirement in order to listen to big playlists of songs on your… Zune. Or iPod. That problem doesn't exist anymore and so the demand dried up. There was also an audiophile scene but afaik with Apple Lossless the demand there has diminished too.</p><p>And finally, since people were solving the problem for real, we also entertained big deal solutions to reduce the strain on the network. If you stream P2P your packets take the slow lane. Netflix and other content providers build out hardware colocated with last mile ISPs so that content distribution can happen even more efficiently than in a P2P model.</p><p>In short: steaming turned into a real “industry”. Innovators and capitalists threw lots of time and money at the problem. Streaming platforms emerged, for better and for worse. And here we are today, on the cusp of repeating the past because short sighted business mongers have balkanized access  with exclusive content libraries for the user numbers.</p></div></td></tr>

                  <p>Build it. Use Go. Maybe nknorg/nnet for P2P. Signed HLS segments. Have Go also serve the web front-end with a WASM web worker. Public nodes can run on a very lightweight VPS/server with an autocert domain. Viewers browser join the swarm with WASM-- this way people can just type in a web address so it's very user friendly but the domain doesn't actually have to serve any data. I would just use a trusted pubkey to sign P2P updates so nodes can block naughty IP addresses. Should get you very friendly user experience, easy node deployment, pretty low latency, and bittorrent level of legal resilience.</p>

            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>
                Audio and music generation have emerged as crucial tasks in many applications, yet existing approaches face significant limitations: they operate in isolation without unified capabilities across modalities, suffer from scarce high-quality, multi-modal training data, and struggle to effectively integrate diverse inputs. In this work, we propose AudioX, a unified Diffusion Transformer model for Anything-to-Audio and Music Generation. Unlike previous domain-specific models, AudioX can generate both general audio and music with high quality, while offering flexible natural language control and seamless processing of various modalities including text, video, image, music, and audio. Its key innovation is a multi-modal masked training strategy that masks inputs across modalities and forces the model to learn from masked inputs, yielding robust and unified cross-modal representations. To address data scarcity, we curate two comprehensive datasets: vggsound-caps with 190K audio captions based on the VGGSound dataset, and V2M-caps with 6 million music captions derived from the V2M dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AudioX not only matches or outperforms state-of-the-art specialized models, but also offers remarkable versatility in handling diverse input modalities and generation tasks within a unified architecture.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://podman-desktop.io/blog/podman-quadlet">https://podman-desktop.io/blog/podman-quadlet</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43683641">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="__blog-post-container"><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="banner" src="https://podman-desktop.io/assets/images/banner-b4811c66dc40efde426f577bd07fc7fd.png" width="1216" height="832"></p>
<p>Containers are typically deployed in Kubernetes clusters.
However, for smaller-scale use cases such as on a single-node server or during development, Kubernetes can be overkill.</p>
<p>What’s a more lightweight solution for running autonomous applications with multiple interacting containers?</p>
<p>In this blog, we'll dive into what Quadlets are, their benefits, and how to use them within Podman Desktop.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-quadlets">What Are Quadlets?<a href="#what-are-quadlets" aria-label="Direct link to What Are Quadlets?" title="Direct link to What Are Quadlets?">​</a></h2>
<p>Podman Quadlets allow you to manage containers declaratively using systemd<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-1-4453df" id="user-content-fnref-1-4453df" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup>.
Since version 4.4, Podman can create, start, and manage containers (including pulling images, creating volumes, and managing pods) through systemd.</p>
<p>Quadlets are simplified configuration files—recognized by their specific extensions,
such as <code>*.container</code>, <code>*.pod</code>, or <code>*.image</code> that are processed during startup or when you reload the daemon using the <code>systemctl daemon-reload</code> command.</p>
<p>Quadlets generate the equivalent systemd unit files, streamlining the container management process.</p>
<h3 id="why-use-quadlets">Why Use Quadlets?<a href="#why-use-quadlets" aria-label="Direct link to Why Use Quadlets?" title="Direct link to Why Use Quadlets?">​</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Declarative Configuration</strong>: Similar to Compose or Kubernetes manifests, Quadlets allow you to declare what you want to run, simplifying the workload setup.</li>
<li><strong>Tight System Integration</strong>: Quadlets align with Podman’s philosophy of integrating seamlessly with Linux, leveraging systemd’s process management capabilities.</li>
<li><strong>Ease of Automation</strong>: Quadlets make it simple to configure containers to start at boot, restart on failure, and more.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="example-a-quadlet-file-for-nginx">Example: A Quadlet File for Nginx<a href="#example-a-quadlet-file-for-nginx" aria-label="Direct link to Example: A Quadlet File for Nginx" title="Direct link to Example: A Quadlet File for Nginx">​</a></h3>
<p>Below is an example of an <code>nginx.container</code> Quadlet file, which starts an nginx container at boot:</p>
<div><p>~/.config/containers/systemd/nginx.container</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span># nginx.container</span><br></span><span><span>[Container]</span><br></span><span><span>ContainerName=nginx</span><br></span><span><span>Image=nginx</span><br></span><span><span>PublishPort=80:8080</span><br></span><span><span></span><br></span><span><span>[Service]</span><br></span><span><span>Restart=always</span><br></span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>This configuration ensures the container restarts automatically if stopped, and exposes port 8080.</p>

<p>Managing Quadlets directly on non-Linux platforms can be challenging due to virtualized environments (e.g., WSL or Hyper-V).
Fortunately, the Podman Desktop extension Podman Quadlet simplifies this process, enabling you to list, generate, and edit Quadlets visually.</p>
<h3 id="key-features-of-the-extension">Key Features of the Extension<a href="#key-features-of-the-extension" aria-label="Direct link to Key Features of the Extension" title="Direct link to Key Features of the Extension">​</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Integration with Podlet</strong>: Generates Quadlets from existing Podman objects<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-2-4453df" id="user-content-fnref-2-4453df" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup>.</li>
<li><strong>Quadlet Management UI</strong>: Provides a dedicated interface to list, edit, delete, start, and stop Quadlets.</li>
<li><strong>Logs Viewer</strong>: Fetches and displays systemd logs using journalctl for troubleshooting.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="installation">Installation<a href="#installation" aria-label="Direct link to Installation" title="Direct link to Installation">​</a></h3>
<p>If you already have the latest version of Podman Desktop, you can <a href="podman-desktop:extension/podman-desktop.quadlet"><strong>click here to install the Podman Quadlet extension</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Alternatively, navigate to the Extensions page within Podman Desktop to install it.</p>
