<p>21st February 2026</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/2024987174077432126">Andrej Karpathy talks about "Claws"</a></strong>. Andrej Karpathy tweeted a mini-essay about buying a Mac Mini ("The apple store person told me they are selling like hotcakes and everyone is confused") to tinker with Claws:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm definitely a bit sus'd to run OpenClaw specifically [...] But I do love the concept and I think that just like LLM agents were a new layer on top of LLMs, Claws are now a new layer on top of LLM agents, taking the orchestration, scheduling, context, tool calls and a kind of persistence to a next level.</p>
<p>Looking around, and given that the high level idea is clear, there are a lot of smaller Claws starting to pop out. For example, on a quick skim NanoClaw looks really interesting in that the core engine is ~4000 lines of code (fits into both my head and that of AI agents, so it feels manageable, auditable, flexible, etc.) and runs everything in containers by default. [...]</p>
<p>Anyway there are many others - e.g. nanobot, zeroclaw, ironclaw, picoclaw (lol @ prefixes). [...]</p>
<p>Not 100% sure what my setup ends up looking like just yet but Claws are an awesome, exciting new layer of the AI stack.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Andrej has an ear for fresh terminology (see <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/19/vibe-coding/">vibe coding</a>, <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/11/glm-5/">agentic engineering</a>) and I think he's right about this one, too: "<strong>Claw</strong>" is becoming a term of art for the entire category of OpenClaw-like agent systems - AI agents that generally run on personal hardware, communicate via messaging protocols and can both act on direct instructions and schedule tasks.</p>
<p>It even comes with an established emoji 🦞</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new law to ensure that batteries are collected, reused and recycled in Europe is entering into force today. The new <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2023/1542/oj">Batteries Regulation</a> will ensure that, in the future, batteries have a low carbon footprint, use minimal harmful substances, need less raw materials from non-EU countries, and are collected, reused and recycled to a high degree in Europe. This will support the shift to a circular economy, increase security of supply for raw materials and energy, and enhance the EU’s strategic autonomy.</p>

<p>In line with the circularity ambitions of the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal_en">European Green Deal</a>, the Batteries Regulation is the first piece of European legislation taking a full life-cycle approach in which sourcing, manufacturing, use and recycling are addressed and enshrined in a single law.</p>

<p>Batteries are a key technology to drive the green transition, support sustainable mobility and contribute to climate neutrality by 2050. To that end, starting from 2025, the Regulation will gradually introduce declaration requirements, performance classes and maximum limits on the carbon footprint of electric vehicles, light means of transport (such as e-bikes and scooters) and rechargeable industrial batteries.</p>

<p>The Batteries Regulation will ensure that batteries placed on the EU single market will only be allowed to contain a restricted amount of harmful substances that are necessary. Substances of concerns used in batteries will be regularly reviewed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Targets for recycling efficiency, material recovery and recycled content will be introduced gradually from 2025 onwards. All collected waste batteries will have to be recycled and high levels of recovery will have to be achieved, in particular of critical raw materials such as cobalt, lithium and nickel. This will guarantee that valuable materials are recovered at the end of their useful life and brought back in the economy by adopting stricter targets for recycling efficiency and material recovery over time.</p>

<p>Starting in 2027, consumers will be able to remove and replace the portable batteries in their electronic products at any time of the life cycle. This will extend the life of these products before their final disposal, will encourage re-use and will contribute to the reduction of post-consumer waste.</p>

<p>To help consumers make informed decisions on which batteries to purchase, key data will be provided on a label. A QR code will provide access to a digital passport with detailed information on each battery that will help consumers and especially professionals along the value chain in their efforts to make the circular economy a reality for batteries.</p>

<p>Under the new law’s due diligence obligations, companies must identify, prevent and address social and environmental risks linked to the sourcing, processing and trading of raw materials such as&nbsp;lithium, cobalt, nickel and natural graphite contained in their batteries. &nbsp;The expected massive increase in demand for batteries in the EU should not contribute to an increase of such environmental and social risks.</p>

<h3>Next steps</h3>

<p>Work will now focus on the application of the law in the Member States, and the redaction of secondary legislation (implementing and delegated acts) providing more detailed rules.</p>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>Since 2006, batteries and waste batteries have been regulated at EU level under the&nbsp;<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32006L0066">Batteries Directive</a>. The Commission&nbsp;<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52020PC0798">proposed to revise this Directive</a>&nbsp;in December 2020 due to new socioeconomic conditions, technological developments, markets, and battery uses.</p>

<p>Demand for batteries is increasing rapidly. It is set to increase 14-fold globally by 2030 and the EU could account for 17% of that demand. This is mostly driven by the electrification of transport. Such exponential growth in demand for batteries will lead to an equivalent increase in demand for raw materials, hence the need to minimise their environmental impact.</p>

<p>In 2017, the Commission launched the&nbsp;European Battery Alliance&nbsp;to build an innovative, sustainable and globally competitive battery value chain in Europe, and ensure supply of batteries needed for decarbonising the transport and energy sectors.</p>

        <h2>Introducing Acme&nbsp;Weather</h2>
        

        <section>
            <p>Fifteen years ago, we started work on the Dark Sky weather app.</p>
            <p>Over the years it went through numerous iterations — including more than one major redesign — as we worked our way through the process of learning what makes a great weather app. Eventually, in time, it was acquired by Apple, where the forecast and some core features were incorporated into Apple Weather.</p>
            <p>We enjoyed our time at Apple. So why did we leave to start another weather company?</p>
            <p>It’s simple: when looking at the landscape of the countless weather apps out there, many of them lovely, we found ourselves feeling unsatisfied. The more we spoke to friends and family, the more we heard that many of them did too. And, of course, we missed those days as a small scrappy shop.</p>
            <p>So let’s try this again…</p>
            <p>
                <span>
                    <img src="https://acmeweather.com/img/intro/main.png" alt="Acme Weather App">
                </span>
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Embracing Uncertainty</h2>

            <p>Our biggest pet peeve with most weather apps is how they deal (or rather, don’t deal) with forecast uncertainty. It is a simple fact that no weather forecast will ever be 100% reliable: the weather is moody, fickle, and chaotic. Forecasts are often wrong.</p>
            <p>Understanding this uncertainty is crucial for planning your day. Most weather apps will give you their single best guess, leaving you to wonder how sure they actually are, and what else might happen instead. Will it actually start raining at 9am, or might it end up pushed off until noon? Will there be rain or snow? How sure are you? You can’t plan your day if you don’t know how much you can trust the forecast, or know what other possibilities might arise. Rather than pretending we will always be right, Acme Weather embraces the idea that our forecast will sometimes be wrong. We address this uncertainty in several ways:</p>

            <h3>Alternate Possible Futures</h3>
            <p>Our homegrown forecasts are produced using many different data sources, including numerical weather prediction models, satellite data, ground station observations, and radar data. Most of the time, our forecast will be a reliable source of information (it’s better than the one we had at Dark Sky). But, crucially, we supplement the main forecast with a spread of alternate predictions. These are additional forecast lines that capture a range of alternate possible outcomes:</p>

            <p>
                <span>
                    <img src="https://acmeweather.com/img/intro/timeline-high-spread.png" alt="A forecast showing multiple possible outcomes">
                    <span>A forecast showing multiple possible outcomes</span>
                </span>
            </p>

            <p>This accomplishes a couple things:</p>
            <p>First, the spread of the lines offers a sort of intuition as to how reliable the forecast is. Take the two forecasts below. In the first, the alternate predictions are tightly focused and the forecast can be considered robust and reliable. In the second, there is a significant spread, which is an indication that something is up and the forecast may be subject to change. It’s a call to action to check other conditions or maps, or come back to the app more frequently:</p>

            <p>
                <span>
                    <img src="https://acmeweather.com/img/intro/timeline-low-spread.png" alt="A more reliable forecast">
                    <span>A more reliable forecast</span>
                </span>
                <span>
                    <img src="https://acmeweather.com/img/intro/timeline-high-spread.png" alt="A less reliable forecast">
                    <span>A less reliable forecast</span>
                </span>
            </p>

            <p>Over time, you build up an intuitive sense of just how much you can actually trust the forecast. After using this for the past six months, I never want to go back to a single forecast again!</p>
            <p>Second, it simply shows what else might plausibly happen. In what time range might the storm arrive? Will the snow hit early, or might it be delayed and turn mostly to rain? When the weather is changing rapidly, predictions can become less reliable. We’ll show you different possible futures, so you can be better informed.</p>

            <h3>Community Reporting</h3>
            <p>Alternative Forecasts are designed to help make better hour-to-hour or day-by-day decisions. Community reports are intended to help with real-time weather events. Current conditions often evolve quickly during storms, radar is imperfect and can fail to detect precipitation during light rain, snow versus freezing rain can be volatile, etc.</p>
            <p>To address this, we’ve built a feature that allows any user to submit a report of the current conditions near them, which can be seen on the map:</p>

            <p>
                <span>
                    <img src="https://acmeweather.com/img/intro/community.png" alt="Community reports">
                    <span>Community reports</span>
                </span>
            </p>

            <p>You can choose from a pre-selected list of weather condition icons (or even a list of emojis for when it’s feeling particularly 💩 out). There’s nothing more reliable than when a person nearby tells you what’s happening, so if there are recent reports near you we’ll flag it in the app.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Useful Maps</h2>

            <p>We absolutely love maps. They provide the context around the weather. Sure, the forecast may say you’ll get rain, but a map will complete the picture by showing you the full breadth of the storm, where it will hit, and where you are relative to it.</p>

            <p>
                <span>
                    <img src="https://acmeweather.com/img/intro/map-radar.png" alt="A more reliable forecast">
                </span>
                <span>
                    <img src="https://acmeweather.com/img/intro/map-temperature.png" alt="A less reliable forecast">
                </span>
                <span>
                    <img src="https://acmeweather.com/img/intro/map-precip-totals.png" alt="A less reliable forecast">
                </span>
            </p>

            <p>We’ve built a large number of maps, including radar and lightning, rain and snow totals (why do most other weather apps not offer this?), wind, temperature and humidity, cloud cover, hurricane tracks, etc. While you can explore them all in the map tab, we also make sure to embed the most relevant maps directly inside the forecasts to provide a contextual backdrop.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Notifications</h2>

            <p>A weather app is only useful if you remember to check it. I’ve lost count of the number of times I’ve gotten stuck in the rain — not because the forecast was wrong, but because I simply didn’t check the app.</p>
            <p>The solution? A comprehensive set of weather notifications. Turn them on, and no longer worry about missing important weather events.</p>
            <p>Our notifications include everything from down-to-the-minute rain warnings, to government severe weather alerts, nearby lightning, community reports, and even whether or not a rainbow might be visible outside your house.</p>
            <p>We also let you create custom notifications, tailored to whatever you care about. Want to know if it’ll be windy, or if the UV index will be high, or if you’ll get heavy rain in the next 24 hours? We’ve got you covered.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Acme Labs</h2>

            <p>A weather app shouldn’t just be about helping you avoid bad weather; it should also be fun! There’s a wide world of meteorological phenomena that we would like to highlight. As such, we’re launching “Acme Labs”, which is a set of experimental tools inside the app to highlight fun and interesting things happening where you are.</p>
            <p>We’re starting with a couple initial features, including: <strong>Rainbow alerts</strong>, where we bring our hyperlocal rain forecasts to bear to pinpoint where rainbows are occuring right now, and <strong>beautiful sunsets</strong>, where we'll let you know if the sunset will be particularly lovely this evening.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Privacy &amp; Trust</h2>

            <p>We take your privacy very seriously. Please review our <a href="https://acmeweather.com/privacy">privacy policy</a>, but here is our philosophy in a nutshell:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>We won’t collect any information other than what is necessary to provide the service you’re paying for. This information will only be used to provide that service, and for nothing else.</li>
                <li>We won’t save or store any information that isn’t necessary. We don’t want or need your location history, for example, and simply not storing it in the first place means it can’t fall into the wrong hands.</li>
                <li>We will never sell or give your information to third parties, such as advertisers. We make our money directly from our customers.</li>
                <li>We don’t use third-party trackers or analytics services, because we can’t guarantee what they will or won’t do with the information we send them.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>

            <p>Well, that’s Acme Weather. We’ve been making weather apps for 15 years, from Dark Sky to Apple, and this is the culmination (the acme?) of everything we’ve learned along the way. It’s the weather app we’ve always wanted, and always wanted to build.</p>
            <p>Acme Weather is <available right="" now=""> in the iOS App Store, and we plan on offering an Android version soon (if you’re an Android developer and would like help, <a href="https://acmeweather.com/jobs">drop us a line</a>!) The app is a $25/year subscription, with a two-week free trial.</available></p>
            <p>We think you’ll love it. So try it out, and let us know what you think!</p>

<p>We manage millions of dollars in annual Meta ad spend. Not thousands. Millions. Our retail clients grow their businesses through Meta Ads, and for a lot of them, it’s their single most important growth channel. We are, by any reasonable definition, a high-value customer.</p>



<p>And yet, for the past several months, Meta has been treating us like we don’t exist.</p>



<p>Here’s what’s been happening, because it’s genuinely one of the more absurd things we’ve experienced running an agency in two decades.</p>



<p><strong>The loop goes like this.</strong> We hire a senior Paid Ads Specialist. They set up a dedicated work account, which, by the way, is standard professional practice. Keeping work and personal accounts separate is basic data hygiene, not a red flag. We upload their government ID for mandatory identity verification. Then, somewhere between five minutes and ten hours later, the account gets instantly banned.</p>



<p>We have done this with multiple specialists and social media managers now. Every single one banned. Before they’ve even opened an ad account or posted a single piece of content.</p>



<p>We have done this with multiple specialists and social media managers now. Every single one banned. Before they’ve even opened an ad account or posted a single piece of content.</p>



<p>Now, we get it. Reading this, you might be thinking there’s something suspicious going on. Maybe a pattern in the logins. Maybe something in the account setup that looks off. Maybe we’re leaving something out. It’s a fair reaction, Meta’s security systems exist for a reason, and when someone says “we keep getting banned,” the natural assumption is that they’re doing something to deserve it.</p>



<p>But here’s the thing. We have been advertising on Facebook since the platform first opened its doors to advertisers, back in 2008. We were there at the beginning. We have spent millions of dollars on it over that time. Our agency history, our billing history, our business identity – it’s all there. There is no shady pattern. There is no hidden behaviour. There is just a broken automated system that cannot distinguish between a bot farm and a professional who created a work account on their first day.</p>



<p>And when we try to fix it? That’s where it gets truly circular. Meta’s standard response is to file an appeal through the Account Quality dashboard. Sounds reasonable, until you realise that the appeal tool is inside the platform – the same platform the specialist is completely locked out of. You cannot appeal a login ban from behind a login screen. </p>



<p>We’ve tried everything. Every forum thread, every concierge support contact, every support line we could find. The answers we get back are remarkably consistent: “just create a new account” or “file an appeal.” So we create a new account. That one gets banned too – often faster than the first. There is no clean slate. There is just the same broken automated system flagging the same professional as a threat, over and over again.</p>



<p>The business impact of this is real and it compounds fast. Clients lose the specialists and managers they hired. Staff, who have done nothing wrong, end up with a black mark attached to their identity documents across multiple banned accounts. And we’re left trying to run campaigns and manage brand pages on a platform that could, at any moment, eliminate a key team member for no legitimate reason.</p>



<p>We never have had this problem with Google or even TikTok.</p>



<p>What we as the enabler of this platform want a simple fix. A manual onboarding pathway for verified agencies that doesn’t collapse the moment an automated system makes a bad call. A human-accessible support channel for login failures, someone who can actually look at an account and click override. And an honest acknowledgement from Meta that their automated identity verification is producing false positives at scale for professional users.</p>



<p>If you’re an agency owner who has hit the same wall, please share this. We’re not the only ones, and the only way this gets fixed is if someone at Meta with actual authority decides it’s worth looking at.</p>

Thankfully, it's a very simple core. Geoffrey's a </span><span>very</span><span> smart guy, and the fact that he's asking this question made me think it's time to write down an answer to this.</span></p><p id="5" data-index="5"><span>It's maybe easiest to start with the Sign-In use-case, which is a much more complicated specification (</span><a href="https://openid.net/developers/how-connect-works/" target="_blank">OpenID Connect</a><span>) than core </span><a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749" target="_blank">OAuth</a><span>. OIDC uses OAuth under the hood, but helps us get to the heart of what's actually happening.</span></p><hr><p id="7" data-index="7"><span>OIDC is functionally equivalent to "magic link" authentication.</span></p><p id="8" data-index="8"><span>We send a secret to a place that only the person trying to identify themselves can access, and they prove that they can access that place by showing us the secret.</span></p><p id="9" data-index="9"><span>That's it.</span></p><p id="10" data-index="10"><span>The rest is just accumulated consensus, in part bikeshedding (agreeing on vocabulary, etc), part UX, and part making sure that all the specific mechanisms are secure.</span></p><hr><p id="12" data-index="12"><span>There's also an historical reason to start with OIDC to explain how all this works: in late 2006, I was working on Twitter, and we wanted to support OpenID (then 1.0) so that </span><span>ahem</span><span> Twitter wouldn't become a centralized holder of online identities. After chatting with the OpenID folks, we quickly realized that as it was constructed, we wouldn't be able to support </span><span>both</span><span> desktop clients </span><span>and</span><span> web sign-in, since our users wouldn't have passwords anymore! (mobile apps didn't exist yet, but weren't far out). So, in order to allow OpenID sign-in, we needed a way for folks using Twitter via alternative clients to sign in without a password.</span></p><p id="13" data-index="13"><span>There were plenty of solutions for this; Flickr had an approach, AWS had one, delicious had one, lots of sites just let random other apps sign-in to your account with your password, etc, but virtually every site in the "Web 2.0" cohort needed a way to do this. They were all insecure and all fully custom.</span></p><p id="14" data-index="14"><span>Rather than building TwitterAuth, I figured it was time to have a standard. Insert XKCD 927:</span></p><a id="15" data-index="15" href="https://xkcd.com/927/" target="_blank"><div><p>Standards</p><p>Fortunately, the charging one has been solved now that we&amp;#39;ve all standardized on mini-USB. Or is it micro-USB? Shit.</p><p>https://xkcd.com/927/</p></div></a><p id="16" data-index="16"><span>Thankfully, against all odds, we now have one standard for delegated auth. What it </span><span>does</span><span> is very simple:</span></p><hr><p id="18" data-index="18"><span>At its core, OAuth for delegation is a standard way to do the following:</span></p><ul><li><p id="19.0" data-index="19.0"><span>The first half exists to send, with consent, a multi-use secret to a known delegate.</span></p></li><li><p id="19.1" data-index="19.1"><span>The other half of OAuth details how the delegate can use that secret to make subsequent requests on behalf of the person that gave the consent in the first place.</span></p></li></ul><p id="20" data-index="20"><span>That's it. </span><span>The rest is (sadly, mostly necessary) noise.</span></p><hr><p id="22" data-index="22"><span>Obviously, the above elides </span><span>absolute volumes</span><span> of detail about how this is done securely and in a consistent interoperable way. This is the unenviable work of standards bodies. I have plenty of opinions on the pros and cons of our current standards bodies, but that's for another time.</span></p><p id="23" data-index="23"><span>There are very credible arguments that the-set-of-IETF-standards-that-describe-OAuth are less a standard than a framework. I'm not sure that's a bad thing, though. HTML is a framework, too –&nbsp;not all browsers need to implement all features, by design.</span></p><p id="24" data-index="24"><span>OIDC itself is an interesting thing – immediately after creating OAuth, we realized that we could compose OpenID's behaviour out of OAuth, even though it was impossible to use OpenID to do what OAuth did. For various social, political, technical, and operational reasons it took the better part of a decade to write down the bits to make that insight a thing that was true in the world. I consider it one of my biggest successes with OAuth that I was in no way involved in that work. I don't have children, but know all the remarkable and complicated feelings of having created something that takes on a life of its own.</span></p><p id="25" data-index="25"><span>More generally, though, authentication and authorization are complicated, situated beasts, impossible to separate from the UX and architectural concerns of the systems that incorporate them.</span></p><p id="26" data-index="26"><span>The important thing when implementing a standard like OAuth is to understand first </span><span>what </span><span>you're trying to do and </span><span>why</span><span>. Once that's in place, the </span><span>how</span><span> is usually a "simple" question of mechanics with fairly constrained requirements. I think that's what makes Geoffrey's question so powerful –&nbsp;it digs into the core of the reason why OAuth is often so inscrutable to so many: the complicated machinery of the standard means that the actual goals it encodes are lost.</span></p><p id="27" data-index="27"><span>Hopefully, this post helps clear that up!</span></p></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.june.kim/cord">https://www.june.kim/cord</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47096466">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>AI agents are good at doing one thing at a time. Give Claude a focused task and it performs. But real work isn’t one task. It’s a tree of tasks with dependencies, parallelism, and context that needs to flow between them.</p><p>The multi-agent frameworks are multiplying. They’re all solving the wrong problem.</p><h2 id="whats-out-there">What’s out there</h2><p><strong>LangGraph</strong> models coordination as a state machine. You define nodes and edges in Python. The developer decides upfront how agents hand off work. It’s powerful for fixed workflows, but the graph is static. If an agent realizes mid-task that the work should be split differently, tough luck. The developer has to anticipate every decomposition pattern in advance.</p><p><strong>CrewAI</strong> is role-based. You define agents with personas — “researcher,” “analyst,” “writer” — and assign them tasks. Intuitive, but the roles are decided by the developer, not discovered by the agents. A crew of three can’t decide it actually needs five people, or that “researcher” should be split into two parallel tracks.</p><p><strong>AutoGen</strong> puts agents in a group chat. They coordinate by talking to each other. Flexible, but there’s no structure. No dependency tracking, no authority scoping, no typed results. Coordination emerges from conversation, which means it’s unpredictable and hard to inspect.</p><p><strong>OpenAI Swarm</strong> is the most minimal — lightweight handoffs between agents. Agent A decides it’s time for Agent B and transfers control. Simple, but linear. No parallelism, no tree structure, no way for an agent to spawn three subtasks and wait for all of them.</p><p><strong>Claude’s tool-use loops</strong> — Anthropic’s own pattern — put a single agent in a loop with tools. Handles sequential complexity well but runs into context window limits on large tasks and can’t parallelize. One agent, one thread, one context.</p><p>The common thread: every framework requires the developer to predefine the coordination structure. <em>You</em> decide the workflow graph, the agent roles, the handoff pattern. The agents execute within your boundaries.</p><p>This made sense when agents were unreliable. You’d never let GPT-3 decide how to decompose a project. But current models are good at planning. They break problems into subproblems naturally. They understand dependencies. They know when a task is too big for one pass.</p><p>So why are we still hardcoding the decomposition?</p><h2 id="let-the-agent-build-the-tree">Let the agent build the tree</h2><p>I built <a href="https://github.com/kimjune01/cord">Cord</a>. You give it a goal:</p><div><pre><code>cord run "Should we migrate our API from REST to GraphQL? Evaluate and recommend."
</code></pre></div><p>One agent launches. It reads the goal, decides it needs research before it can answer, and creates subtasks:</p><div><pre><code>● #1 [active] GOAL Should we migrate our API from REST to GraphQL?
  ● #2 [active] SPAWN Audit current REST API surface
  ● #3 [active] SPAWN Research GraphQL trade-offs for our stack
  ○ #4 [pending] ASK How many concurrent users do you serve?
    blocked-by: #2
  ○ #5 [pending] FORK Comparative analysis
    blocked-by: #3, #4
  ○ #6 [pending] SPAWN Write migration recommendation
    blocked-by: #5
</code></pre></div><p>No workflow was hardcoded. The agent decided this structure at runtime.</p><p>It parallelized the API audit (#2) and the GraphQL research (#3). It created an <code>ask</code> node (#4) — a question for the human — because it realized the recommendation depends on scale, something it can’t research on its own. It blocked #4 on #2 because the question makes more sense with the audit results as context. It made #5 a <code>fork</code> so the analysis inherits everything learned so far. And it sequenced the final recommendation after the analysis.</p><p>Then you watch it run:</p><div><pre><code>✓ #2 [complete] SPAWN Audit current REST API surface
  result: 47 endpoints. 12 heavily nested resources...
✓ #3 [complete] SPAWN Research GraphQL trade-offs
  result: Key advantages: reduced over-fetching...

? How many concurrent users do you serve?
  Options: &lt;1K, 1K-10K, 10K-100K, &gt;100K
&gt; 10K-100K

● #5 [active] FORK Comparative analysis
  blocked-by: #3, #4
</code></pre></div><p>The research runs in parallel. When both finish and you answer the question, the analysis launches with all three results in its context. It produces a recommendation tailored to your actual scale and API surface — not a generic blog post about GraphQL.</p><h2 id="spawn-vs-fork">Spawn vs fork</h2><p>This is the one idea I think is genuinely new: the distinction between <code>spawn</code> and <code>fork</code> as a context-flow primitive.</p><p>A <strong>spawned</strong> agent gets a clean slate. Just its prompt and the results of nodes it explicitly depends on. Like hiring a contractor — here’s the spec, go. Cheap to restart, easy to reason about.</p><p>A <strong>forked</strong> agent gets all completed sibling results injected into its context. Like briefing a team member — they know everything the team has learned so far. More expensive, but necessary for analysis that builds on prior work.</p><p>This isn’t about concurrency. Both can run in parallel or sequentially. It’s about <em>what the child knows</em>. In the example above, the agent chose <code>spawn</code> for the independent research tasks and <code>fork</code> for the analysis that needs everything. It made this choice on its own — the model understands the distinction intuitively.</p><h2 id="under-the-hood">Under the hood</h2><p>Each agent is a Claude Code CLI process with MCP tools backed by a shared SQLite database:</p><ul><li><code>spawn(goal, prompt, blocked_by)</code> — create a child task</li><li><code>fork(goal, prompt, blocked_by)</code> — create a context-inheriting child</li><li><code>ask(question, options)</code> — ask the human a question</li><li><code>complete(result)</code> — mark yourself done</li><li><code>read_tree()</code> — see the full coordination tree</li></ul><p>Agents don’t know they’re in a coordination tree. They see tools and use them as needed. The protocol — dependency resolution, authority scoping, result injection — is enforced by the MCP server.</p><p>When an <code>ask</code> node becomes ready, the engine pauses to prompt the human in the terminal. The answer is stored as a result, and downstream nodes unblock. The human is a participant in the tree, not an observer.</p><p>~500 lines of Python. SQLite + MCP.</p><h2 id="the-moment-it-clicked">The moment it clicked</h2><p>Before writing the runtime, I had to answer one question: would Claude actually <em>get</em> this? The whole design hinges on agents understanding coordination tools they’ve never seen before. If they couldn’t figure out <code>spawn</code> vs <code>fork</code>, or if they ignored <code>blocked_by</code>, the protocol was dead on arrival.</p><p>So I built a throwaway MCP server with the five tools, pointed Claude Code at it, and ran 15 tests. No runtime. No engine. Just Claude, the tools, and a task.</p><p>The first test: “decompose this project into subtasks.” Claude called <code>read_tree()</code> to see the current state — unprompted — then created five children with correct dependency ordering. It wrote detailed prompts for each one. It called <code>read_tree()</code> again after to verify they were created.</p><p>I hadn’t told it to do any of that.</p><p>Then the fork test. I gave it a scenario with both independent research tasks and a synthesis step. It chose <code>spawn</code> for the research and <code>fork</code> for the analysis. When I asked why, it said fork is like “briefing a team member” while spawn is like “hiring a contractor.” That was the exact metaphor from my spec. It had never seen my spec.</p><p>15 out of 15 tests passed. Claude decomposed tasks into 3-6 subtasks with correct dependencies. It asked humans well-scoped questions instead of guessing. When it tried to stop a sibling node and got rejected for lack of authority, it didn’t retry or hack around it — it escalated through <code>ask parent</code>, which is exactly the right pattern.</p><p>That was the moment I knew the runtime was worth building. The model already understood the protocol. I just had to build the infrastructure around it.</p><h2 id="what-this-is-not">What this is not</h2><p>This implementation uses Claude Code CLI and SQLite. But the protocol — five primitives, dependency resolution, authority scoping, two-phase lifecycle — is independent of all that.</p><p>You could implement Cord over Postgres for multi-machine coordination. Over the Claude API directly, without the CLI overhead. With multiple LLM providers — GPT for cheap tasks, Claude for complex ones. With human workers for some nodes.</p><p>The protocol is the contribution. This repo is a proof of concept.</p><h2 id="try-it">Try it</h2><div><pre><code>git clone https://github.com/kimjune01/cord.git
<span>cd </span>cord
uv <span>sync

</code></pre></div><p>You can also point it at a planning doc:</p><div><pre><code>cord run plan.md <span>--budget</span> 5.0
</code></pre></div><p>The root agent reads the markdown and decomposes it into a coordination tree. Write your plan however you want — bullet points, sections, prose — and the agent figures out the task structure, dependencies, and parallelism.</p><p>Requires <a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code">Claude Code CLI</a> and a subscription that includes it.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/kimjune01/cord">GitHub</a> | <a href="https://github.com/kimjune01/cord/blob/master/RFC.md">RFC</a> | <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47096466">HN Discussion</a></p></article></div>]]></description>

<h3>Hello, World</h3>
<p>In December 1990, an application called WorldWideWeb was developed on a NeXT machine at The European Organization for Nuclear Research (known as CERN) just outside of Geneva. This program&nbsp;– WorldWideWeb — is the antecedent of most of what we consider or know of as "the web" today.</p>
<p>In February 2019, in celebration of the thirtieth anniversary of the development of WorldWideWeb, a group of developers and designers convened at CERN to rebuild the original browser <em>within</em> a contemporary browser, allowing users around the world to experience the rather humble origins of this transformative technology.</p>
<p>This project was supported by the US Mission in Geneva through the CERN &amp; Society Foundation.</p>

Many thanks, hammers up, and onwards.</p><p>Last week, in La Mesa, a small city just east of San Diego, California, observers happened upon a pair of destroyed Flock cameras.

The destruction was obviously intentional, and appears perhaps even staged to leave a message: It came just weeks after the city decided, in the face of public protest, to continue its contracts with the surveillance company.</p><p>Flock cameras are typically mounted on 8 to 12 foot poles and powered by a solar panel. The smashed remains of all of the above in La Mesa are the latest examples of a widening anti-Flock backlash. In recent months, people have been smashing and dismantling the surveillance devices, in incidents reported in at least five states, from coast to coast. </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!szBv!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffe4c8e48-8b26-457b-8969-f95db3c9c113_2048x1366.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!szBv!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffe4c8e48-8b26-457b-8969-f95db3c9c113_2048x1366.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!szBv!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffe4c8e48-8b26-457b-8969-f95db3c9c113_2048x1366.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!szBv!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffe4c8e48-8b26-457b-8969-f95db3c9c113_2048x1366.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!szBv!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffe4c8e48-8b26-457b-8969-f95db3c9c113_2048x1366.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!szBv!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffe4c8e48-8b26-457b-8969-f95db3c9c113_2048x1366.jpeg" width="1456" height="971" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/fe4c8e48-8b26-457b-8969-f95db3c9c113_2048x1366.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:971,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:609392,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/i/188520032?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffe4c8e48-8b26-457b-8969-f95db3c9c113_2048x1366.jpeg&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!szBv!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffe4c8e48-8b26-457b-8969-f95db3c9c113_2048x1366.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!szBv!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffe4c8e48-8b26-457b-8969-f95db3c9c113_2048x1366.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!szBv!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffe4c8e48-8b26-457b-8969-f95db3c9c113_2048x1366.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!szBv!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffe4c8e48-8b26-457b-8969-f95db3c9c113_2048x1366.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture></div></a><figcaption><span>Photos by Bill Paul of </span><a href="https://sdslackers.com/2026/02/16/flock-cameras-destroyed-in-la-mesa-amid-surveillance-backlash/" rel="">SD Slackers</a><span>, used with permission.</span></figcaption></figure></div><p><span>Bill Paul, who runs the local news outlet San Diego Slackers, and who first reported on </span><a href="https://sdslackers.com/2026/02/16/flock-cameras-destroyed-in-la-mesa-amid-surveillance-backlash/" rel="">the smashed Flock equipment</a><span>, tells me that the sabotage comes just a month or two after San Diego held a raucous city council meeting over whether to keep operating the Flock cameras.

They gather not just license plate images, but other identifying data used to ‘fingerprint’ vehicles, their owners, and their movements. This data can be collected, stored, and accessed without a warrant, making it a popular workaround for law enforcement. Perhaps most controversially, </span><a href="https://www.404media.co/ice-taps-into-nationwide-ai-enabled-camera-network-data-shows/" rel="">Flock’s vehicle data is routinely accessed by ICE</a><span>. </span></p><p><span>If you’ve heard Flock’s name come up recently, it’s likely as a result of their </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/878447/ring-flock-partnership-canceled" rel="">now-canceled partnership with Ring</a><span>, made instantly famous by a particularly dystopian Super Bowl ad that promised to turn regular neighborhoods into a surveillance dragnet.</span></p><p><span>Meanwhile, abuses have been prevalent.

too. He points again to that heated December 2025 city council meeting, in which public outrage was left unaddressed. The city, perhaps aware of the stigma Flock now carries, apparently tried to highlight that their focus was on the “smart streetlights” made by another company, while downplaying the fact that those streetlights run on Flock software. </p><p>“San Diego gets to hide behind a slight facade in that their contract is with Ubicquia,” the smart streetlight manufacturer, Paul says, “but the software layer is Flock.

Darren Blanchard showed up at a Claremore City Council meeting on Tuesday to talk about public records and the data center. When he went over his allotted 3 minutes by a few seconds, the city had him arrested and charged with trespassing.</p><p><span>The subject of the city council meeting was </span><a href="https://claremore.com/project-mustang-faq/?ref=404media.co" rel="">Project Mustang</a><span>, a proposed data center that would be located within a local industrial park. In a mirror of fights playing out across the United States, developer Beale Infrastructure is attempting to build a large data center in a small town and the residents are concerned about water rights, spiking electricity bills, and noise.</span></p><p>The public hearing was a chance for the city council to address some of these concerns and all residents were given a strict three minute time limit. The entire event was livestreamed and archive of it is on YouTube. Blanchard was warned, barely, to “respect the process” by one of the council members but was clearly finishing reading from papers he had brought to read from, was not belligerent, and went over time by just a few seconds. Anyone who has ever attended or watched a city council meeting anywhere will know that people go over their time at essentially any meeting that includes public comment.</p><p>Blanchard arrived with documents in hand and questions about public records requests he’d made. During his remarks, people clapped and cheered and he asked that this not be counted against his three minutes. “There are major concerns about the public process in Claremore,” Blanchard said, referencing compliance documents and irregularities he’d uncovered in public records.</p></blockquote><p><span>Blanchard was then arrested as the crowd jeered in disbelief. Also disconcerting was the way the local news framed the event, with </span><a href="https://www.newson6.com/tulsa-oklahoma-news/arrest-made-during-heated-claremore-meeting-over-proposed-data-center" rel="">a local anchor defending </a><span>authorities by claiming he was “warned multiple times.” Seems like a pretty surefire way to make people hate data centers and the governments protecting them even more!</span></p><p>On Wednesday, I headed to Pershing Square in downtown Los Angeles, where dozens of gig workers and organizers with Rideshare Drivers United had assembled to deliver a petition to the California Labor Commission signed by thousands of workers, calling on the body to deliver a settlement on their behalf. Organizers made short speeches on the steps of the square while local radio and TV stations captured the moment. “</p><p>“They’re robbing us!” A speaker yelled. “Wage theft!” the crowd replied.</p><p>The Labor Commission is suing the gig companies on drivers’ behalf, alleging that Uber and Lyft stole billions of dollars worth of wages from drivers before Prop 22 was enacted in 2020. The commission is believed to be in negotiations with the gig companies right now that will determine a settlement.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!eDLz!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc5bfce5c-3f28-4809-8945-2d21eb858275_1500x2000.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!eDLz!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc5bfce5c-3f28-4809-8945-2d21eb858275_1500x2000.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!eDLz!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc5bfce5c-3f28-4809-8945-2d21eb858275_1500x2000.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!eDLz!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc5bfce5c-3f28-4809-8945-2d21eb858275_1500x2000.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!eDLz!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc5bfce5c-3f28-4809-8945-2d21eb858275_1500x2000.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!eDLz!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc5bfce5c-3f28-4809-8945-2d21eb858275_1500x2000.jpeg" width="1456" height="1941" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c5bfce5c-3f28-4809-8945-2d21eb858275_1500x2000.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1941,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1186950,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/i/188520032?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc5bfce5c-3f28-4809-8945-2d21eb858275_1500x2000.jpeg&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!eDLz!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc5bfce5c-3f28-4809-8945-2d21eb858275_1500x2000.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!eDLz!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc5bfce5c-3f28-4809-8945-2d21eb858275_1500x2000.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!eDLz!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc5bfce5c-3f28-4809-8945-2d21eb858275_1500x2000.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!eDLz!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc5bfce5c-3f28-4809-8945-2d21eb858275_1500x2000.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>I spoke with one driver, Karen, who had traveled from San Diego to join the demonstration, and asked her why she came. “It’s important we build driver power” she said. “Without driver power, we won’t get what we need, and we just want fairness.” She said she was hoping to claim at least $20,000 in stolen wages. </p><p>“We’re fighting for wages that were stolen for us from us and continue to be stolen from us every single day by these app companies from hell,” RDU organizer Nicole Moore told me. “So we’re marching in downtown L.A. to deliver 10,000 signatures of drivers demanding that the state fight hard for us, and don’t let these companies rip us off.”</p><p><span>According to Tesla’s own numbers, its new RoboTaxis in Austin are crashing at a rate 4 times higher than human drivers.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr today urged broadcasters to join a “Pledge America Campaign” that Carr established to support President Trump’s “Salute to America 250” project.</p>
<p>Carr said in a <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-418890A1.pdf">press release</a> that “I am inviting broadcasters to pledge to air programming in their local markets in support of this historic national, non-partisan celebration.” The press release said Carr is asking broadcasters to “air patriotic, pro-America programming in support of America’s 250th birthday.”</p>
<p>Carr gave what he called examples of content that broadcasters can run if they take the pledge. His examples include “starting each broadcast day with the ‘Star Spangled Banner’ or Pledge of Allegiance”; airing “PSAs, short segments, or full specials specifically promoting civic education, inspiring local stories, and American history”; running “segments during regular news programming that highlight local sites that are significant to American and regional history, such as National Park Service sites”; airing “music by America’s greatest composers, such as John Philip Sousa, Aaron Copland, Duke Ellington, and George Gershwin”; and providing daily “Today in American History” announcements highlighting significant events from US history.</p>
<p>Carr apparently wants this to start now and last until at least July 4. Carr’s press release starts by touting Trump’s <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/america250/">Salute to America 250</a> project and quotes a White House statement that said, “Under the President’s leadership, Task Force 250 has commenced the planning of a full year of festivities to officially launch on Memorial Day, 2025 and continue through July 4, 2026.”</p>
<p>That White House quote cited by the FCC today is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250418202816/https://www.whitehouse.gov/america250/">nearly a year old</a>, as you might have guessed by the reference to Memorial Day in 2025. More recently, Trump has said he wants the celebration to last throughout 2026. A Trump proclamation <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2026/01/year-of-celebration-and-rededication-2026/">last month</a> declared a “yearlong commemoration” of American independence that began on January 1, 2026.</p>
<h2>“Voluntary” pledge</h2>
<p>Today’s FCC press release said, “Broadcasters can voluntarily choose to indicate their commitment to the Pledge America Campaign and highlight their ongoing and relevant programming to their viewing and listening audiences.” Although it’s described as voluntary, Carr said broadcasters can meet their public interest obligations by taking the pledge. This is notable because Carr has repeatedly threatened to punish broadcast stations for violating the public interest standard.</p>

<p>Dependabot is a noise machine. It makes you feel like you’re doing work, but you’re actually discouraging more useful work. This is <em>especially</em> true for security alerts in the Go ecosystem.</p>
<p>I recommend turning it off and replacing it with a pair of scheduled GitHub Actions, one running govulncheck, and the other running your test suite against the latest version of your dependencies.</p>
<h2 id="a-little-case-study">A little case study</h2>
<p>On Tuesday, I <a href="https://github.com/FiloSottile/edwards25519/security/advisories/GHSA-fw7p-63qq-7hpr">published a security fix</a> for <a href="https://filippo.io/edwards25519">filippo.io/edwards25519</a>. The <code>(*Point).MultiScalarMult</code> method would produce invalid results if the receiver was not the identity point.</p>
<p>A lot of the Go ecosystem depends on filippo.io/edwards25519, mostly through <a href="https://github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql">github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql</a> (228k dependents only on GitHub). <a href="https://github.com/search?q=%22filippo.io%2Fedwards25519%22+%2F%5C.MultiScalarMult%2F+language%3AGo+-path%3A*_test.go&amp;type=code">Essentially no one uses <code>(*Point).MultiScalarMult</code>.</a></p>
<p>Yesterday, Dependabot opened <a href="https://github.com/search?q=%22d1c650a+extra%3A+initialize+receiver+in+MultiScalarMult%22&amp;type=pullrequests">thousands of PRs</a> against unaffected repositories to update filippo.io/edwards25519. These PRs were accompanied by a security alert with <a href="https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-fw7p-63qq-7hpr">a nonsensical, made up CVSS v4 score</a> and by a worrying <a href="https://github.com/C2SP/wycheproof/pull/220">73% compatibility score</a>, allegedly based on the breakage the update is causing in the ecosystem. Note that the diff between v1.1.0 and v1.1.1 is <a href="https://github.com/FiloSottile/edwards25519/compare/v1.1.0...v1.1.1#diff-0d9d6ab39182b0d5344623ba5d70c2db0e05607b28b9f77067a7120d1ccdeb49">one line in the method no one uses</a>.</p>

<p>We even got <a href="https://github.com/C2SP/wycheproof/pull/220">one of these alerts</a> for the Wycheproof repository, which <em>does not import the affected filippo.io/edwards25519 package at all</em>. Instead, it only imports the unaffected filippo.io/edwards25519/field package.</p>

<p>We have turned Dependabot off.</p>

This already silences a lot of noise, because it’s common and good practice for modules to separate functionality relevant to different dependents into different sub-packages.<sup id="fnref:pkgdeps"><a href="#fn:pkgdeps">1</a></sup> For example, it would have avoided the false alert against the Wycheproof repository.</p>
<p>If you use a third-party vulnerability scanner, you should demand at least package-level filtering.</p>
<p><em>Good</em> vulnerability scanners will go further, though, and filter based on the reachability of the vulnerable <em>symbol</em> using static analysis. That’s what <a href="https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/govulncheck">govulncheck</a> does!</p>

<p>It will run every day and only notify you if there is an actual vulnerability you should pay attention to.</p>
<h3 id="the-cost-of-alert-fatigue">The cost of alert fatigue</h3>
<p>False positive alerts are not only a waste of time, they also reduce security by causing alert fatigue and making proper triage impractical.</p>
<p>A security vulnerability should be assessed for its impact: production might need to be updated, secrets rotated, users notified! A business-as-usual dependency bump is a woefully insufficient remediation for an actual vulnerability, but it’s the only practical response to the constant stream of low-value Dependabot alerts.</p>
<p>This is why as Go Security Team lead back in 2020–2021 I insisted the team invest in staffing the Go Vulnerability Database and implement a vulnerability scanner with static analysis filtering.</p>
<p>The govulncheck Action will not automatically open a PR for you, and that’s a good thing! Now that security alerts are not mostly noise, you can afford to actually look at them and take them seriously, including any required remediation.</p>
<p>Noisy vulnerability scanners also impact the open source ecosystem. I often get issues and PRs demanding I update the dependencies of my projects due to vulnerabilities that don’t affect them, because someone’s scanner is failing to filter them. That’s extra toil dropped at the feet of open source maintainers, which is unsustainable. The maintainer’s <a href="https://geomys.org/standard-of-care">responsibility</a> is making sure projects are not affected by security vulnerabilities. The responsibility of scanning tools is making sure they don’t disturb their users with false positives.</p>
<h2 id="test-against-latest-instead-of-updating">Test against latest instead of updating</h2>
<p>The other purpose of Dependabot is to keep dependencies up to date, regardless of security vulnerabilities. Your practices and requirements will vary, but I find this misguided, too.</p>
<p>Dependencies should be updated according to <em>your</em> development cycle, not the cycle of each of your dependencies. For example you might want to update dependencies all at once when you begin a release development cycle, as opposed to when each dependency completes theirs.</p>
<p>There are two benefits to quick updates, though: first, you can notice and report (or fix) breakage more rapidly, instead of being stalled by an incompatibility that could have been addressed a year prior; second, you reduce your patch delta <em>in case</em> you need to update due to a security vulnerability, reducing the risk of having to rush through a refactor or unrelated fixes.</p>
<p>You can capture both of those benefits without actually updating the dependencies by simply running CI against the latest versions of your dependencies every day. You just need to run <code>go get -u -t ./...</code> before your test suite. In the npm ecosystem, you just run <code>npm update</code> instead of <code>npm ci</code>.</p>
<p>This way, you will still be alerted quickly of any potential issues, without having to pay attention to unproblematic updates, which you can defer to whenever fits your project best.</p>
<p>This is a lot safer, too, because malicious code recently added to a dependency will not rapidly reach users or production, but only CI. Supply chain attacks have a short half-life! You can further mitigate the risk by using a CI sandboxing mechanism like <a href="https://github.com/geomys/sandboxed-step">geomys/sandboxed-step</a>, which uses gVisor to remove <a href="https://words.filippo.io/compromise-survey/#readwrite-ci-permissions-0-root-2-contributing">the ambient authority that GitHub Actions grants every workflow, including supposedly read-only ones</a>.</p>

<p>The Tevere has overflowed its lower banks, so a lot of previously familiar landscapes have changed slightly, almost eerily. This is the first picture I took after being able to somewhat safely descend onto (part of) the river’s banks.</p>

Through our retainer contracts they ensure the sustainability and reliability of our open source maintenance work and get a direct line to my expertise and that of the other Geomys maintainers. (Learn more in the <a href="https://words.filippo.io/geomys">Geomys announcement</a>.)
Here are a few words from some of them!</p>
<p>Teleport — For the past five years, attacks and compromises have been shifting from traditional malware and security breaches to identifying and compromising valid user accounts and credentials with social engineering, credential theft, or phishing. <a href="https://goteleport.com/platform/identity/?utm=filippo">Teleport Identity</a> is designed to eliminate weak access patterns through access monitoring, minimize attack surface with access requests, and purge unused permissions via mandatory access reviews.</p>
<p>Ava Labs — We at <a href="https://www.avalabs.org/">Ava Labs</a>, maintainer of <a href="https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanchego">AvalancheGo</a> (the most widely used client for interacting with the <a href="https://www.avax.network/">Avalanche Network</a>), believe the sustainable maintenance and development of open source cryptographic protocols is critical to the broad adoption of blockchain technology. We are proud to support this necessary and impactful work through our ongoing sponsorship of Filippo and his team.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I'm a diving instructor. I'm also a platform engineer who spends lots of his time thinking about and implementing infrastructure security. Sometimes those two worlds collide in unexpected ways.</p>
<p><img src="https://dixken.de/images/blog/costa-rica.jpg" alt="A frigatebird perched on the boat railing next to a dive flag, somewhere off Cocos Island, Costa Rica">
<em>A Sula sula (Frigatebird) and a dive flag on the actual boat where I found the vulnerability - somewhere off Cocos Island.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>While on a 14 day-long dive trip around Cocos Island in Costa Rica, I stumbled across a vulnerability in the member portal of a major diving insurer - one that I'm personally insured through. What I found was so trivial, so fundamentally broken, that I genuinely couldn't believe it hadn't been exploited already.</p>
<p>I disclosed this vulnerability on <strong>April 28, 2025</strong> with a standard 30-day embargo period. That embargo expired on May 28, 2025 - over <strong>eight months ago</strong>. I waited this long to publish because I wanted to give the organization every reasonable opportunity to fully remediate the issue and notify affected users. The vulnerability has since been addressed, but to my knowledge, I have not received confirmation that affected users were notified. I have reached out to the organization to ask for clarification on this matter.</p>
<p>This is the story of what happened when I tried to do the right thing.</p>
<h2 id="the-vulnerability"><a href="#the-vulnerability">The Vulnerability</a></h2>
<p>To understand why this is so bad, you need to know how the registration process works. As a diving instructor, I register my students (to get them insured) through my account on the portal. I enter their personal information with their consent - name, date of birth, address, phone number, email - and the system creates an account for them. The student then receives an email with their new account credentials: a numeric user ID and a default password. They <em>might</em> log in to complete additional information, or they might never touch the portal again.</p>
<p>When I registered three students in quick succession, they were sitting right next to me and checked their welcome emails. The user IDs were nearly identical - sequential numbers, one after the other. That's when it clicked that something really bad was going on.</p>
<p>Now here's the problem: the portal used <strong>incrementing numeric user IDs</strong> for login. User XXXXXX0, XXXXXX1, XXXXXX2, and so on. That alone is a red flag, but it gets worse: every account was provisioned with a <strong>static default password</strong> that was never enforced to be changed on first login. And many users - especially students who had their accounts created <em>for</em> them by their instructors - never changed it.</p>
<p>So the "authentication" to access a user's full profile - name, address, phone number, email, date of birth - was:</p>
<ol>
<li>Guess a number.</li>
<li>Type the same default password that every account shares on account creation.</li>
<li>There's a good chance you get in.</li>
</ol>
<p>That's it. No rate limiting. No account lockout. No MFA. Just an incrementing integer and a password that might as well have been <code>password123</code>.</p>
<p>I verified the issue with the minimum access necessary to confirm the scope - and stopped immediately after. A significant portion of IDs in the sample were still using the default password. The data exposed wasn't just email addresses - it included full personal profiles, <strong>including those of underage students</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="the-proof-of-concept"><a href="#the-proof-of-concept">The Proof of Concept</a></h2>
<p>To confirm the issue wasn't limited to a handful of accounts, I wrote a short script that automated what could be done manually in any browser. I first tried Python <code>requests</code>, but the portal's login mechanism was convoluted enough that a clean session wasn't feasible. So I used Selenium - a browser automation tool - which just drives a real browser through the same steps any user would take manually.</p>
<p>The following is a <strong>simplified, non-functional excerpt</strong> of the script. Identifiers, endpoints, and implementation details have been HEAVILY removed or altered - this will not run as-is and is included only to illustrate the triviality of the issue:</p>
<div><pre><code><span># Simplified, non-runnable excerpt - details redacted</span>

<span>def</span> <span>check_account</span>(<span>user_id</span>):
    driver = webdriver.Chrome()
    driver.get(LOGIN_URL)

    driver.find_element(...).send_keys(<span>str</span>(user_id)) <span># numeric user ID</span>
    driver.find_element(...).send_keys(DEFAULT_PASSWORD) <span># same for each user on creation</span>
    driver.find_element(...).click() <span># submit</span>

    <span>if</span> <span>"failed"</span> <span>not</span> <span>in</span> driver.page_source:
        driver.get(PROFILE_URL)
        save_profile_data(user_id, driver) <span># name, DOB, address, phone, email</span>
        driver.get(LOGOUT_URL)

    driver.quit()

<span>for</span> uid <span>in</span> <span>range</span>(START_ID, END_ID):
    check_account(uid)</code></pre></div>
<p>No exploits, no buffer overflows, no zero-days. Just a login form, a number, and a default password that <em>was set for each student on creation</em>. This is the kind of issue that anyone could discover and reproduce in an afternoon.</p>
<p>Here's what the output looked like for a single successful login - redacted, but structurally identical to the real output:</p>

<p>Read that date of birth again. <strong>2011.</strong> This person was 14 years old at the time. Their full name, email address, phone number, nationality, and physical home address - all accessible with nothing more than a sequential number and a default password. And this wasn't a one-off. Multiple profiles belonged to minors.</p>
<p>I want to be absolutely clear: <strong>all data obtained during this verification has been permanently deleted.</strong> I did not retain any personal information, I did not attempt to access anything beyond what was required to confirm the report, and I stopped as soon as the scope was established.</p>
<h2 id="the-disclosure"><a href="#the-disclosure">The Disclosure</a></h2>
<p>I did everything by the book. I contacted <strong>CSIRT Malta</strong> (MaltaCIP) first - since the organization is registered in Malta, this is the competent national authority. The Maltese <a href="https://mdia.gov.mt/app/uploads/2024/12/P-SPG-001-National-Coordinated-Vulnerability-Disclosure-Policy.pdf">National Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure Policy (NCVDP)</a> explicitly requires that confirmed vulnerabilities be reported to both the responsible organization <em>and</em> CSIRTMalta.</p>
<p>Then I emailed the organisation directly, CC'ing CSIRT:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear Sir or Madam,</p>
<p>As a fellow diving instructor insured through [the organization] and a full-time Linux Platform Engineer, I am contacting you to responsibly disclose a critical vulnerability I identified within the [the organization]'s user account system.</p>
<p>During recent testing, I discovered that user accounts - including those of underage students - are accessible through a combination of predictable User ID enumeration (incrementing user IDs) and the use of a static default password that is not enforced to be changed upon first login. This misconfiguration currently exposes sensitive personal data (e.g., names, addresses, contact information - including phone numbers and emails -, dates of birth) and represents multiple GDPR violations.</p>
<p>Key details:</p>
<ul>
<li>Password reuse across accounts without forced password reset</li>
<li>Predictable, incremental user ID enumeration</li>
<li>Exposure of sensitive and underage user data without adequate safeguards</li>
</ul>
<p>For initial confirmation, I am attaching a screenshot from Member ID XXXXXXX showing the exposed data, partly redacted for privacy reasons.</p>
<p>Additionally, for transparency and validation, I have shared my proof-of-concept code securely via an encrypted paste service: [link redacted]</p>
<p>In the spirit of responsible disclosure, I have already informed CSIRT Malta (in CC) to officially initiate a reporting process, given [the organization]'s operational presence in Malta.</p>
<p>I kindly request that [the organization] acknowledges receipt of this disclosure within 7 days.</p>
<p>I am offering a window of 30 days from today the 28th of April 2025 for [the organization] to mitigate or resolve the vulnerability before I consider any public disclosure.</p>
<p>Please note that I am fully available to assist your IT team with technical details, verification steps and recommendations from a security perspective.</p>
<p>[contact details]</p>
<p>I strongly recommend assigning an IT-Security Point of Contact (PoC) for direct collaboration on this issue.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your attention to this critical matter. I am looking forward to working with you towards a secure resolution.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both of these timelines are standard - if anything, generous - in responsible disclosure frameworks.</p>
<h2 id="the-response"><a href="#the-response">The Response</a></h2>
<p>Two days later, I got a reply. Not from their IT team. From their <strong>Data Privacy Officers (DPO's) law firm</strong>.</p>
<p>The letter opened politely enough - they acknowledged the issue and said they'd launched an investigation. They even mentioned they were resetting default passwords and planning to roll out 2FA. Good.</p>
<p>But then the tone shifted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While we genuinely appreciate your seemingly good intentions and transparency in highlighting this matter to our attention, we must respectfully note that notifying the authorities prior to contacting the Group creates additional complexities in how the matter is perceived and addressed and also exposes us to unfair liability.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let me translate: <em>"We wish you hadn't told the government about our security issue."</em></p>
<p>It got better:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We also do not appreciate your threat to make this matter public [...] and remind you that you may be held accountable for any damage we, or the data subjects, may suffer as a result of your own actions, which actions likely constitute a criminal offence under Maltese law.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, to be clear: their portal had a default password on every account, exposing personal data including that of children, and <em>I'm</em> the one who "likely" committed a criminal offence by finding it and telling them.</p>
<p>They also sent a <strong>declaration</strong> they wanted me to sign - while requesting my passport ID - confirming I'd deleted all data, wouldn't disclose anything, and would keep the entire matter "strictly confidential." The deadline? <strong>End of business the same day they sent it.</strong></p>
<p>This declaration included the following gem:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I also declare that I shall keep the content of this declaration strictly confidential.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's an NDA with extra steps: I was being asked to sign away my right to discuss the disclosure process itself - including the fact that I found a vulnerability in their system - under threat of legal action.</p>
<p>Then came the reminders. One "friendly" reminder. Then an "urgent" one. Sign the declaration. De-escalate. Move on. Quietly.</p>
<h2 id="the-pushback"><a href="#the-pushback">The Pushback</a></h2>
<p>I generally refuse to sign confidentiality clauses in cases involving exposure of sensitive information, and I did so here as well. Coordinated disclosure depends on transparency and trust between researchers and organizations: trust that affected users will be informed, and trust that a report leads to real remediation.</p>
<p>Given that the organization in question had already breached that trust by exposing personal data through weak controls, I wasn’t willing to grant blanket confidentiality that could be used to keep the incident out of public scrutiny. And with trying to actual silence me through legal threats, they had already made it clear that their priority was <strong>reputation management over user data protection.</strong> So I stood my ground.</p>
<p>Instead, I offered to sign a modified declaration confirming data deletion. I had no interest in retaining anyone’s personal data, but I was not going to agree to silence about the disclosure process itself.</p>
<p>I also pointed out that, under Malta’s NCVDP, involving CSIRT Malta is part of the expected reporting path - not a hostile act - and that publishing post-remediation analyses is standard practice in the security community.</p>
<p><strong>Their response doubled down.</strong> They cited Article 337E of the Maltese Criminal Code - computer misuse - and helpfully reminded me that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Art. 337E of the Criminal Code also provides that "If any act is committed outside Malta which, had it been committed in Malta, would have constituted an offence [...] it shall [...] be deemed to have been committed in Malta." Meaning that your actions would be deemed a criminal offence in Malta, even if committed in another country.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They also made their position on disclosure crystal clear, after I reiterated my refusal to sign their NDA:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We object strongly to the use of [the organization's name] in any such blogs or conferences you may write/attend as this would be a disproportionate harm to [the organization's] reputation [...]. We reserve our rights at law to hold you responsible for any damages [the organization] may suffer as a result of any such public disclosures you may make.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's fine by me. Because here's the thing: <strong>The vulnerability has been fixed.</strong> Default passwords have been reset. 2FA is being rolled out. I feel sorry for the developer(s) who had to clean up this mess, but at least the issue is no longer exploitable. Sure, it would have been better if the organization had thanked me and taken responsibility for notifying affected users. If the incident qualified as a personal data breach (which it does) and was likely to result in a (high) risk to individuals - especially given minors were involved - GDPR Articles 33 and 34 generally <strong>require notification to the supervisory authority and communication to affected data subjects</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>GDPR Article 34(1) When the personal data breach is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller shall communicate the personal data breach to the data subject without undue delay.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>GDPR Article 34(2) The communication to the data subject referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article shall describe in clear and plain language the nature of the personal data breach and contain at least the information and measures referred to in points (b), (c) and (d) of Article 33(3).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have not received confirmation that those notifications were ever carried out.</p>
<h2 id="the-blame-game"><a href="#the-blame-game">The Blame Game</a></h2>
<p>My favourite part was the organization's position on whose fault this actually was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We contend that it is the responsibility of users to change their own password (after we allocate a default one).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Read that again. A company that assigned <em>the same default password</em> to every account, never forced a password change, and used incrementing numeric IDs as usernames is blaming <strong>the users</strong> for not securing their own accounts. Accounts that include those of minors.</p>
<p>Just a quick reminder:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>GDPR Article 5(1)(f) (integrity and confidentiality): Personal data shall be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical or organisational measures.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Under GDPR, the <strong>data controller</strong> (namely: the organization) is responsible for implementing appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure data security. A static default password on an IDOR-vulnerable portal is not an "appropriate measure" by any definition.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>GDPR Article 24(1) (controller responsibility): Taking into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risks of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure and to be able to demonstrate that processing is performed in accordance with this Regulation. Those measures shall be reviewed and updated where necessary.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-pattern"><a href="#the-pattern">The Pattern</a></h2>
<p>This isn't an isolated case. The security research community has been dealing with this pattern for decades: find a vulnerability, report it responsibly, get threatened with legal action. It's so common it has a name - the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chilling_effect">chilling effect</a>.</p>
<p>Organizations that respond to disclosure with lawyers instead of engineers are telling the world something important: they care more about their reputation than about the data they're supposed to protect.</p>
<p>And the real irony? <strong>The legal threats are the reputation damage. Not the vulnerability itself</strong> - vulnerabilities happen to everyone. It's the response that tells you everything about an organization's security culture.</p>
<h2 id="what-should-have-happened"><a href="#what-should-have-happened">What Should Have Happened</a></h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Acknowledge the report</strong> - they did this, to be fair.</li>
<li><strong>Fix the vulnerability</strong> - they started on this too.</li>
<li><strong>Thank the researcher</strong> - instead of threatening them with criminal prosecution.</li>
<li><strong>Have a CVD policy</strong> - so researchers know how to report issues and what to expect.</li>
<li><strong>Notify affected users</strong> - especially the parents of underage members whose data was exposed.</li>
<li><strong>Not try to silence the researcher</strong> with NDAs disguised as "declarations."</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="what-you-can-do"><a href="#what-you-can-do">What You Can Do</a></h2>
<p>If you're an organization:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Publish a Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure policy.</strong> It doesn't have to be complex - maybe begin with a <a href="https://securitytxt.org/">security.txt</a> file and a clear process that favors transparency.</li>
<li><strong>Thank researchers</strong> for helping you improve your security posture.</li>
<li><strong>Don't shoot the messenger.</strong> The person reporting the bug is not your enemy. The bug is.</li>
<li><strong>Don't blame your users</strong> for security failures that are your responsibility as a data controller.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're a security researcher:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Always involve your national CSIRT.</strong> It protects you and creates an official record.</li>
<li><strong>Document everything.</strong> Every email, every timestamp, every response.</li>
<li><strong>Don't sign NDAs</strong> that prevent you from discussing the disclosure process. But you can agree to delete data (and MUST do so!) without agreeing to silence.</li>
<li><strong>Know your rights.</strong> Many jurisdictions have legal protections for good-faith security research. The EU's NIS2 Directive encourages coordinated vulnerability disclosure.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because right now, in 2026, reporting a trivial vulnerability exposing personal data - including that of children - still gets met with legal threats instead of gratitude. <strong>And that's a problem for all of us.</strong></p></div></div>]]></description>

      Friday, 20 February 2026 ·
      <a href="https://juno-labs.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#5d3c393c301d3728333270313c3f2e733e3230">Adam Juhasz</a>

    <p>
      On January 16, OpenAI quietly announced that ChatGPT would begin showing
      advertisements. By February 9th, ads were live. Eight months earlier,
      OpenAI spent $6.5 billion to acquire Jony Ive's hardware startup io.
      They're building a pocket-sized, screenless device with built-in cameras
      and microphones -- "contextually aware," designed to replace your phone.
    </p>

    <p>
      But this isn't a post about OpenAI. They're just the latest. The problem
      is structural.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Every single company<sidenote><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/04/14/apple-rebrands-search-ads-business-as-apple-ads/">We can quibble about Apple.</a></sidenote>
        building AI assistants is now funded by advertising.</strong>
      And every one of them is building hardware designed to see and hear
      everything around you, all day, every day. These two facts are on a
      collision course, and local on-device inference is the only way off the
      track.
    </p>

    <h2>The always-on future is inevitable</h2>

    <p>
      Before we talk about who's building it, let's be clear about
      <em>what's</em> being built.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every mainstream voice assistant today works behind a gate. You say a
      magic word -- "Hey Siri," "OK Google," "Alexa" -- and only then does the
      system listen. Everything before the wake word is theoretically discarded.
    </p>

    <p>
      This was a reasonable design in 2014. It is a dead end for where AI
      assistance needs to go.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here's what happens in a real kitchen at 6:30am:<sidenote>Anonymized from one of our test homes. The real version was messier and
        included a toddler screaming about Cheerios.</sidenote>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      "Are we out of eggs again? I'm thinking frittata tonight but we also need
      to -- oh wait, did the school email about Thursday? I think there's a
      early release. Anyway, if we don't have eggs, I'll get them from Target
      and also that dish soap, the blue one."
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Nobody is going to preface that with a wake word. The information is woven
      into natural speech between two flustered parents getting the family ready
      to leave the house. The moment you require a trigger, you lose the most
      valuable interactions -- the ones that happen while people are living
      their lives, not thinking of how to give context to an AI assistant.
    </p>

    <p>
      You cannot build proactive assistance behind a wake word. The AI has to be
      present in the room, continuously, accumulating context over days and
      weeks and months, to build the understanding that makes proactive help
      possible.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is where every major AI company is heading. Not just audio -- vision,
      presence detection, wearables, multi-room awareness. The next generation
      of AI assistants will hear and see everything. Some will be on your face
      or in your ears all day. They will be always on, always sensing, always
      building a model of your life.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>
        The question is not <em>whether</em> always-on AI will happen. It's who
        controls the data it collects. And right now, the answer to that
        question is: advertising companies.</strong>
    </p>

    <h2>Policy is a promise. Architecture is a guarantee.</h2>

    <p>
      Here's where the industry's response gets predictable. "We encrypt the
      data in transit." "We delete it after processing." "We anonymize
      everything." "Ads don't influence the AI's answers." "Read our privacy
      policy."<sidenote>With cloud processing, every user is trusting:<br>
        • The company's current privacy policy<br>
        • Every employee with production access<br>
        • Every third-party vendor in the processing pipeline<br>
        • Every government that can issue a subpoena or national security
        letter<br>
        • Every advertiser partnership that hasn't been announced yet<br>
        • The company's future privacy policy
      </sidenote>
    </p>

    <p>
      OpenAI's own ad announcement includes this language: "OpenAI keeps
      conversations with ChatGPT private from advertisers, and never sells data
      to advertisers." It sounds reassuring. But Google
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_concerns_with_Google#Gmail">scanned every Gmail for ad targeting for thirteen years</a>
      before quietly stopping in 2017. Policies change. Architectures don't.
    </p>

    <p>Policy is a promise. Architecture is a guarantee.</p>

    <p>
      When a device processes data locally, the data
      <em>physically cannot leave the network</em>. There is no API endpoint to
      call. There is no telemetry pipeline. There is no "anonymized usage data"
      that somehow still contains enough signal to be useful for ad targeting.
      The inference hardware sits inside the device or in the user's home, on
      their network.
    </p>

    <p>
      Your email is sensitive. A continuous audio and visual feed of your home
      is something else entirely. It captures arguments, breakdowns, medical
      conversations, financial discussions, intimate moments, parenting at its
      worst, the completely unguarded version of people that exists only when
      they believe nobody is watching.<sidenote>We wrote a deep dive on our memory system in
        <a href="https://juno-labs.com/blogs/building-memory-for-an-always-on-ai-that-listens-to-your-kitchen.html">Building Memory for an Always-On AI That Listens to Your Kitchen</a>.</sidenote>
    </p>

    <p>
      Amazon already showed us what happens.
      <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/amazon-echo-ends-do-not-send-voice-recordings-option/488677">They eliminated local voice processing.</a>
      <a href="https://alexaechos.com/">They planned to feed Alexa conversations to advertisers.</a>
      <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/07/amazon-ring-cashes-techno-authoritarianism-and-mass-surveillance">
        They partnered Ring with a surveillance network that had federal law
        enforcement access.</a>
      What happens when those same economic incentives are applied to devices
      that capture everything?
    </p>

    <h2>The edge inference stack is ready</h2>

    <p>
      The counterargument is always the same: "Local models aren't good enough."
      Three years ago, that was true. It is no longer true.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can run a complete ambient AI pipeline today -- real-time
      speech-to-text, semantic memory, conversational reasoning, text-to-speech,
      etc -- on a device that fits next to a cable box (remember those?). No fan
      noise. A one-time hardware purchase with no per-query fee and no data
      leaving the building. New model architectures, better compression, and
      open-source inference engines have converged to make this possible, and
      the silicon roadmap points in one direction: more capability per watt,
      every year.<sidenote>We've been running always-on prototypes in five homes. The complaints
        we get are about the AI misunderstanding context, not about raw model
        capability. That's a memory architecture problem, not a model size
        problem.</sidenote>
    </p>

    <p>
      Are local models as capable as the best cloud models? No. But we're
      usually not asking our smart speaker to re-derive the Planck constant.
    </p>

    <p>
      Hardware that runs inference on-device. Models that process audio and
      video locally and never transmit it.
      <strong>There needs to be a business model based on selling the hardware and
        software, not the data the hardware collects. An architecture where the
        company that makes the device <em>literally cannot access</em> the data
        it processes, because there is no connection to access it
        through.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      The most helpful AI will also be the most intimate technology ever built.
      It will hear everything. See everything. Know everything about the family.
      The only architecture that keeps that technology safe is one where it is
      structurally incapable of betraying that knowledge. Not policy. Not
      promises. Not a privacy setting that can be quietly removed in a March
      software update.
    </p>

    <p>
      Choose local. Choose edge. Build the AI that knows everything but phones
      home nothing.
    </p>

<p>The English-language edition of Wikipedia is blacklisting Archive.today after the controversial archive site was used to direct a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack against a blog.</p>
<p>In the course of discussing whether Archive.today should be deprecated because of the DDoS, Wikipedia editors discovered that the archive site altered snapshots of webpages to insert the name of the blogger who was targeted by the DDoS. The alterations were apparently fueled by a grudge against the blogger over a post that described how the Archive.today maintainer hid their identity behind several aliases.</p>
<p>“There is consensus to immediately deprecate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archive.today">archive.today</a>, and, as soon as practicable, add it to the spam blacklist (or create an edit filter that blocks adding new links), and remove all links to it,” stated an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Archive.is_RFC_5">update</a> today on Wikipedia’s Archive.today discussion. “There is a strong consensus that Wikipedia should not direct its readers towards a website that hijacks users’ computers to run a DDoS attack (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:ELNO#EL3">WP:ELNO#3</a>). Additionally, evidence has been presented that archive.today’s operators have altered the content of archived pages, rendering it unreliable.”</p>
<p>More than 695,000 links to Archive.today are distributed across 400,000 or so Wikipedia pages. The archive site, which is facing an <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/11/fbi-subpoena-tries-to-unmask-mysterious-founder-of-archive-today/">investigation</a> in which the FBI is trying to uncover the identity of its founder, is commonly used to bypass news paywalls.</p>
<p>“Those in favor of maintaining the status quo rested their arguments primarily on the utility of archive.today for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability">verifiability</a>,” said today’s Wikipedia update. “However, an analysis of existing links has shown that most of its uses can be replaced. Several editors started to work out implementation details during this RfC [request for comment] and the community should figure out how to efficiently remove links to archive.today.”</p>
<h2>Editors urged to remove links</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Archive.today_guidance">Guidance</a> published as a result of the decision asked editors to help remove and replace links to the following domain names used by the archive site: archive.today, archive.is, archive.ph, archive.fo, archive.li, archive.md, and archive.vn. The guidance says editors can remove Archive.today links when the original source is still online and has identical content; replace the archive link so it points to a different archive site, like the Internet Archive, Ghostarchive, or Megalodon; or “change the original source to something that doesn’t need an archive (e.g., a source that was printed on paper), or for which a link to an archive is only a matter of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Convenience_link">convenience</a>.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <!-- Your post content goes here -->
        

        <p>And I don't just mean that nobody uses it anymore. Like, I knew everyone under 50 had moved on, but I didn't realize the extent of the slop conveyor belt that's replaced us.</p>
        
        <p>I logged on for the first time in ~8 years to see if there was a group for my neighborhood (there wasn't). Out of curiosity I thought I'd scroll a bit down the main feed.</p>

        <p>The first post was the latest xkcd (a page I follow). The next <em>ten posts</em> were not by friends or pages I follow. They were basically all thirst traps of young women, mostly AI-generated, with generic captions. Here's a sampler — mildly NSFW, but I did leave out a couple of the lewder ones:</p>

        <div>
            <p><img src="https://pilk.website/3/ai-thirst-traps.png" alt="A collage of Facebook posts of random women in revealing clothing"></p><p>Click to show mildly sensitive content (revealing clothing)</p>
        </div>

        <p>Yikes. Again, I don't follow any of these pages. This is all just what Facebook is pushing on me.</p>

        <p>I know Twitter/X has worse problems with spam bots in the replies, but this is the <em>News Feed</em>! It's the main page of the site! It's the product that defined modern social media!</p>
        
        <p>It wasn't all like that, though. There was also an AI video of a policeman confiscating a little boy's bike, only to bring him a brand new one:</p>

        <img src="https://pilk.website/3/ai-police.png" alt="Facebook post of an AI generated video with a policeman and child">

        <p>And there were some sloppy memes and jokes, mostly about relationships, like this (admittedly not AI) video sketch where a woman decides to intentionally start a fight with her boyfriend because she's on her period:</p>
        
        <img src="https://pilk.website/3/boyfriend-sketch.png" alt="Facebook post of a video sketch">

        <p>Maybe that isn't literally about sex, but I'd classify it as the same sort of lizard-brain-rot engagement bait as those selfies. Meta even gives us some helpful ideas for sexist questions we can ask their AI about the video:</p>

        <img src="https://pilk.website/3/ai-questions.png" alt="Suggested AI prompt: why do women feel refreshed after arguments?">

        <p>Yep, that's another "yikes" from me. To be fair, though, sometimes that suggested questions feature is pretty useful! Like with this post, for example:</p>

        <img src="https://pilk.website/3/ai-questions-2.png" alt="Facebook post with photos of a woman in a short dress, possibly AI. Suggested AT prompts are: why is she wearing pink heels? What is the woman's personality?">

        <p>Why <em>is</em> she wearing pink heels? What <em>is</em> her personality? Great questions, Meta.</p>

        <hr>

        <p>I said these were "mostly" AI-generated. The truth is with how good the models are getting these days, it's hard to tell, and I think a couple of them might be real people.</p>
        
        <p>Still, some of these are pretty obviously AI. Here's one with a bunch of alien text and mangled logos on the scoreboard in the background:</p>

        <img src="https://pilk.website/3/ai-football.png" alt="Facebook post of an AI photo of a woman in a football stadium">

        <p>Hmm, I wonder if anyone has noticed this is AI? Let's check out the comments and see if anyone's pointed that ou—</p>

        <img src="https://pilk.website/3/ai-comments.png" alt="Comments on the above picture, mostly variations on Beautiful and I love you">

        <p>...never mind. (I dunno, maybe those are all bots too.)</p>

        <hr>
        
        <p>So: is this just something wacky with my algorithm?</p>
        
        <p>I mean... maybe? That's part of the whole thing with these algorithmic feeds; it's hard to know if anyone else is seeing what I'm seeing.</p>
        
        <p>On the one hand, I doubt most (straight) women's feeds would look like this. But on the other hand, I hadn't logged in in nearly a decade! I hate to think what the feed looks like for some lonely old guy who's been scrolling the lightly-clothed AI gooniverse for hours every day.</p>

        <p>Did everyone but me know it was like this? I'd seen screencaps of stuff like the Jesus-statue-made-out-of-broccoli slop a year or two ago, but I thought that only happened to grandmas. I hadn't heard about anything like this.</p>

        <p>I wonder if this evolution was less noticeable for people who are logging in every day. Or maybe it only gets this bad when there aren't any posts from your actual friends?</p>

        <p>In any case, I stopped exploring after I saw a couple more of those AI-generated pictures but with girls that looked like they were about ~14, which made me sick to my stomach. So long Facebook, see you never, until one day I inexplicably need to use your platform to get updates from my kid's school.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p>Everybody wants better sleep, but getting better sleep is hard.</p><p><span>I was trading New Year’s resolutions with a circle of friends a few weeks ago, and someone mentioned a big one: sleeping better. I’m a visual neuroscientist by training, so whenever the topic pops up it inevitably leads to talking about the dreaded blue light from monitors, blue light filters, and whether they do anything. My short answer is </span><strong>no, blue light filters don’t work, but there are many more useful things that someone can do to control their light intake to improve their sleep</strong><span>—and minimize jet lag when they’re travelling.</span></p><p>My longer answer is usually a half-hour rant about why they don’t work, covering everything from a tiny nucleus of cells above the optic chiasm, to people living in caves without direct access to sunlight, to neuropeptides, the different cones, how monitors work, gamma curves, what I learned running ismy.blue, corn bulbs, melatonin, finally sharing my Apple Watch &amp; WHOOP stats. What follows is slightly more than you needed to know about blue light filters and more effective ways to control your circadian rhythm. Spoiler: the real lever is total luminance, not color.</p><p>Right above the optic chiasm lies a nucleus called the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). This is where the brain’s master circadian clock lives. There are a lot of phenomena in the body, whether alertness, body temperature, or hunger, that are at least partially dependent on our body’s sense of time. There’s a set of neurons that are part of the hypothalamus that autonomously track time, by a fascinating set of transcription-translation feedback loops involving proteins that ultimately shut down their own translation in a cycle that lasts about 24 hours. The cells in the SCN also synchronize with each other through neuropeptides, and diffuse the master clock signal throughout the body; melatonin from the pineal gland, but also via secondary regulation of the HPA (stress axis), and a neuropeptide called AVP.</p><p>The intrinsic clock is not very precise, with a cycle that typically lasts a little more than 24 hours, something which was first verified in people living deep underground in abandoned mines (for science!). One factor that ultimately resets the clock is input from a set of neurons  inside the retina that project to this nucleus. Those cells are called intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs).

No. The premise is revealed as obviously flawed the minute you look at the absorption spectra of the different opsins. Compare melanopsin’s sensitivity to different wavelengths with those of the three cones: its peak sensitivity is right between that of the S (short wavelength, aka blue) cone and that of the M cone (medium wavelength, aka green). It also has a pretty broad bandwidth. </span><strong>It’s not sensitive to blue, it’s sensitive to cyan (and blue and green)</strong><span>.</span></p><p>Unless your strategy is to create a photo-lab-like screen in pure black and red, or wear deep-red-tinted glasses, it’s unlikely that a pure colorshift strategy will cut out that big of a chunk of the spectrum. </p><p><span>What does blue light blocking software like f.lux and Apple’s Night Shift do? We can measure their effect by presenting different colors on a monitor with or without the filter on and measuring the output light with a spectrometer. Ideally, I would have access to a precision spectrometer as I used in grad school, but that seemed excessive and very expensive; I used a cheap colorimeter instead, the SpyderX, to find out. This device can measure the (simulated) response of the L, M, and S cones to a patch of constant luminance on the screen (LMS responses). </span><a href="https://osf.io/shg3t/overview" rel="">The PsyCalibrator paper’s appendix</a><span> assures me that the device is remarkably linear within the range that I used it in, saving me from browsing eBay for several weeks for a calibrated precision spectrometer that would cost less than a 2014 Nissan Altima in good condition.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!HSFw!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9d1a4175-3e01-49b3-9f56-ad12de55fda3_2048x1536.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!HSFw!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9d1a4175-3e01-49b3-9f56-ad12de55fda3_2048x1536.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!HSFw!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9d1a4175-3e01-49b3-9f56-ad12de55fda3_2048x1536.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!HSFw!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9d1a4175-3e01-49b3-9f56-ad12de55fda3_2048x1536.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!HSFw!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9d1a4175-3e01-49b3-9f56-ad12de55fda3_2048x1536.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!HSFw!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9d1a4175-3e01-49b3-9f56-ad12de55fda3_2048x1536.jpeg" width="1456" height="1092" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9d1a4175-3e01-49b3-9f56-ad12de55fda3_2048x1536.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1092,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:769405,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.neuroai.science/i/188578855?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9d1a4175-3e01-49b3-9f56-ad12de55fda3_2048x1536.jpeg&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!HSFw!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9d1a4175-3e01-49b3-9f56-ad12de55fda3_2048x1536.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!HSFw!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9d1a4175-3e01-49b3-9f56-ad12de55fda3_2048x1536.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!HSFw!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9d1a4175-3e01-49b3-9f56-ad12de55fda3_2048x1536.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!HSFw!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9d1a4175-3e01-49b3-9f56-ad12de55fda3_2048x1536.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>The SpyderX, an affordable colorimeter used to measure colors on a screen</figcaption></figure></div><p>I tested this with Apple’s Night Shift on my M1 Macbook Air.

Controlling light is effective for certain kinds of sleep disturbances. For instance, an issue I’ve had over the years is a phase-delay pattern; I would get to bed later and later every night, which pushed my rise time forward, until it interfered with daytime activities (i.e. a job). Tightly controlling light to better control sleep can work here. However, the amount of cyan light change is far larger than that afforded by a blue light filter. Here are four things that can help.</span></p><blockquote><p>Disclaimer: I’m not an MD, nor a sleep specialist, this is not medical advice. Talk to your MD.</p></blockquote><p><span>Dark mode is distinct from night shift (blue filter) mode; it instructs websites and apps to display light text on a dark background as opposed to the daytime dark text on a light background. I took a sample of 4 websites/apps (Google, X, Github, and VSCode) with the SpyderX colorimeter + a diffuser to average over a larger area of the screen, and found reductions in luminance ranging from </span><strong>92% to 98%</strong><span>! That’s huge. </span></p><p>If it feels like it’s almost too much (e.g. the backgrounds are typically shifted to dark gray rather than pure black), remember that light perception is logarithmic, and that raw RGB values are translated to screen luminance via a gamma function whose exponent on Mac is 2.2. That means that dark grays can have far less light in absolute terms than the number implied by a linear scale. For instance, the dark gray #101010 has a relative luminance of (1/16)^2.2 compared to white #ffffff; about ~450 times darker.</p><p>That’s all great, but there are websites that still don’t have dark modes. It doesn’t make any sense in 2026 that Gmail doesn’t have a dark mode. If the activity you’re doing most at night is reading email, you might consider an alternative email client.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!xaGh!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b9cc264-0c26-41bd-9ada-b66455c42a0a_548x414.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!xaGh!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b9cc264-0c26-41bd-9ada-b66455c42a0a_548x414.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!xaGh!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b9cc264-0c26-41bd-9ada-b66455c42a0a_548x414.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!xaGh!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b9cc264-0c26-41bd-9ada-b66455c42a0a_548x414.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!xaGh!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b9cc264-0c26-41bd-9ada-b66455c42a0a_548x414.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!xaGh!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b9cc264-0c26-41bd-9ada-b66455c42a0a_548x414.png" width="520" height="392.84671532846716" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4b9cc264-0c26-41bd-9ada-b66455c42a0a_548x414.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:414,&quot;width&quot;:548,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:520,&quot;bytes&quot;:25600,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.neuroai.science/i/188578855?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b9cc264-0c26-41bd-9ada-b66455c42a0a_548x414.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!xaGh!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b9cc264-0c26-41bd-9ada-b66455c42a0a_548x414.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!xaGh!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b9cc264-0c26-41bd-9ada-b66455c42a0a_548x414.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!xaGh!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b9cc264-0c26-41bd-9ada-b66455c42a0a_548x414.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!xaGh!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b9cc264-0c26-41bd-9ada-b66455c42a0a_548x414.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>The screen brightness control on Mac has 17 notches, with the lowest corresponding to completely black. Here’s how much light I measured from the SpyderX with a dark grey uniform stimulus as a function of this setting. The first half of the scale is approximately exponential, the second half linear. You can decrease the amount of light coming from your screen by more than half simply by dimming the screen by several notches. Just make sure, if you use a laptop/second screen combo like I do, that the brightness of the second screen is synced to your primary screen; I set up the free MonitorControl app recently to do this.</p><p><span>The ipRGC-SCN connection is not just modulated by night-time light; it’s modulated by day-time light. </span><a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2100094118" rel="">Research in rodents</a><span> supports the idea that the amplitude of diurnal oscillations in the SCN is affected by daytime brightness. The usual advice is to go outside and touch grass during the day—indeed, the sun is very bright, even under dark clouds. It’s also the case, however, that offices—and especially home offices—are frequently overly dim. </span><a href="https://blog.plover.com/tech/corn-bulbs.html" rel="">LED light is incredibly cheap these days</a><span>; you can get a ridiculously bright 100W LED lightbulb—not 100W “incandescent equivalent” light, 100 real Watts in the visible spectrum—for a few tens of dollars. You can then diffuse that light over a relatively large home office.</span></p><p>If you stack the three previous advice sections together, you could gain as much as 2-3 order of magnitude peak-to-trough luminance throughout your day. That might be enough to support your circadian rhythm health. If that’s not enough, however, recall that one of the ultimate outputs of the SCN is through the pineal gland, which releases of melatonin. Partly, it’s the inhibition of circulating melatonin that is causally responsible for sleep phase shift. It’s possible to remedy that by taking exogenous melatonin an hour before bed to facilitate the onset of sleep.</p><p><span>However, most melatonin supplements have far too high doses. </span><strong>Be very wary of melatonin dose</strong><span>. As explained in this excellently researched </span><a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/07/10/melatonin-much-more-than-you-wanted-to-know/" rel="">Slate Star Codex post</a><span>, over-the-counter melatonin supplements can contain anywhere between </span><strong>10 to 30 times</strong><span> as much melatonin as is optimal to maintain circadian hygiene. If you have ever taken melatonin and got immediately knocked out cold, had weird dreams and woke up in the middle of the night sweaty or shivering, you likely took too much—which, to be clear, is not your fault, it’s the default in the US and Canada. The mega-doses in stores serve as hypnotics (punches you to sleep), but wreck sleep architecture. The right dose is 0.3 mg, which is hard to find in pharmacies but can be found online. This dose will not knock you out (feels more like chamomile tea than Ambien). </span></p><p><span>I’ve been meaning to write about blue light for a long time—a perfect topic for a visual neuroscientist! The blue light filter story has just the right level of anchoring in reality—the entrainment of circadian rhythms by ipRGCs—to feel like a tantalizing </span><em>one simple trick</em><span> to fix your sleep. Simple but ineffective on its own, there is a kernel of truth behind the idea of blue light filters that can be used to come up with a better policy: use dark mode; dim your screen; touch grass; if all fails, consider melatonin.</span></p></div></article></div><div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div><div><h3>Ready for more?</h3></div></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div data-theme="ivory"><div><p><strong>Claude Code Security</strong>, a new capability built into Claude Code on the web, is now available in a limited research preview. It scans codebases for security vulnerabilities and suggests targeted software patches for human review, allowing teams to find and fix security issues that traditional methods often miss.</p><p>Security teams face a common challenge: too many software vulnerabilities and not enough people to address them. Existing analysis tools help, but only to a point, as they usually look for known patterns. Finding the subtle, context-dependent vulnerabilities that are often exploited by attackers requires skilled human researchers, who are dealing with ever-expanding backlogs.</p></div><p>AI is beginning to change that calculus. We’ve recently shown that <a href="https://red.anthropic.com/2026/zero-days/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Claude can detect novel, high-severity vulnerabilities</a>. But the same capabilities that help defenders find and fix vulnerabilities could help attackers exploit them.</p><p>Claude Code Security is intended to put this power squarely in the hands of defenders and protect code against this new category of AI-enabled attack. We’re releasing it as a limited research preview to Enterprise and Team customers, with expedited access for maintainers of open-source repositories, so we can work together to refine its capabilities and ensure it is deployed responsibly.</p><h2 id="how-claude-code-security-works"><strong>How Claude Code Security works</strong></h2><p>Static analysis—a widely deployed form of automated security testing—is typically rule-based, meaning it matches code against known vulnerability patterns. That catches common issues, like exposed passwords or outdated encryption, but often misses more complex vulnerabilities, like flaws in business logic or broken access control.</p><p>Rather than scanning for known patterns, Claude Code Security reads and reasons about your code the way a human security researcher would: understanding how components interact, tracing how data moves through your application, and catching complex vulnerabilities that rule-based tools miss.</p><p>Every finding goes through a multi-stage verification process before it reaches an analyst. Claude re-examines each result, attempting to prove or disprove its own findings and filter out false positives. Findings are also assigned severity ratings so teams can focus on the most important fixes first.</p><p>Validated findings appear in the Claude Code Security dashboard, where teams can review them, inspect the suggested patches, and approve fixes. Because these issues often involve nuances that are difficult to assess from source code alone, Claude also provides a confidence rating for each finding. Nothing is applied without human approval: Claude Code Security identifies problems and suggests solutions, but developers always make the call.</p><h2 id="using-claude-for-cybersecurity"><strong>Using Claude for cybersecurity</strong></h2><p>Claude Code Security builds on more than a year of research into Claude’s cybersecurity capabilities. Our Frontier Red Team has been stress-testing these abilities systematically: entering Claude in <a href="https://red.anthropic.com/2025/ai-for-cyber-defenders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">competitive Capture-the-Flag events</a>, partnering with Pacific Northwest National Laboratory to <a href="https://red.anthropic.com/2026/critical-infrastructure-defense/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">experiment with using AI to defend critical infrastructure</a>, and refining Claude’s ability to find and patch real vulnerabilities in code.</p><p>Claude’s cyberdefensive abilities have improved substantially as a result. Using <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-opus-4-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Claude Opus 4.6</a>, released earlier this month, our team <a href="https://red.anthropic.com/2026/zero-days/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">found over 500 vulnerabilities</a> in production open-source codebases—bugs that had gone undetected for decades, despite years of expert review. We’re working through triage and responsible disclosure with maintainers now, and we plan to expand our security work with the open-source community.</p><p>We also use Claude to review our own code, and we’ve found it to be extremely effective at securing Anthropic’s systems. We built Claude Code Security to make those same defensive capabilities more widely available. And since it’s built on Claude Code, teams can review findings and iterate on fixes within the tools they already use.</p><h2 id="the-road-ahead"><strong>The road ahead</strong></h2><p>This is a pivotal time for cybersecurity. We expect that a significant share of the world’s code will be scanned by AI in the near future, given how effective models have become at finding long-hidden bugs and security issues.</p><p>Attackers will use AI to find exploitable weaknesses faster than ever. But defenders who move quickly can find those same weaknesses, patch them, and reduce the risk of an attack. Claude Code Security is one step towards our goal of more secure codebases and a higher security baseline across the industry.</p><h2 id="getting-started"><strong>Getting started</strong></h2><p>We’re opening a limited research preview of Claude Code Security to Enterprise and Team customers today. Participants will get early access and collaborate directly with our team to hone the tool’s capabilities.

<h3 id="twif-curated-on-friday-20-feb-2026-week-8">TWIF curated on Friday, 20 Feb 2026, Week 8</h3>

<h4 id="f-droid-core">F-Droid core</h4>

<p>During out talks with F-Droid users at <a href="https://fosdem.org/2026/">FOSDEM26</a> we were baffled to learn most were relieved that Google has canceled their plans to lock-down Android.</p>

<p><em>Why baffled?</em> Because no such thing actually happened, the plans announced last August are still scheduled to take place. We see a battle of PR campaigns and whomever has the last post out remains in the media memory as the truth, and having journalists just copy/paste Google posts serves no one.</p>

<p><em>But Google said…</em> Said what? That there’s a magical “advanced flow”? Did you see it? Did anyone experience it? When is it scheduled to be released? Was it part of Android 16 QPR2 in December? Of 16 QPR3 Beta 2.1 last week? Of Android 17 Beta 1? No? That’s the issue… As time marches on people were left with the impression that everything was done, fixed, Google “wasn’t evil” after all, this time, yay!</p>

<p>While we all have bad memories of “banners” as the dreaded ad delivery medium of the Internet, after FOSDEM we decided that we have to raise the issue back and have everyone, who cares about Android as an open platform, informed that we are running out of time until Google becomes the gate-keeper of all users devices.</p>

<p>Hence, the <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/">website</a> and starting today our clients, with the updates of <strong><a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.fdroid.fdroid">F-Droid</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.fdroid.basic">F-Droid Basic</a></strong>, feature a banner that reminds everyone how little time we have and how to voice their concerns to whatever local authority is able to understand the dangers of this path Android is led to.</p>

<p><em>We are not alone in our fight, <a href="https://izzyondroid.org/">IzzyOnDroid</a> added a banner too, more F-Droid clients will add the warning banner soon and other app downloaders, like <strong><a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/dev.imranr.obtainium.fdroid/">Obtainium</a></strong>, already have an in-app warning dialogue.</em></p>

<p>Regarding <strong><a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.fdroid.basic">F-Droid Basic</a></strong> rewrite, development continues with a new release <code>2.0-alpha3</code>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Updated Translations</li>
    <li>Export installed apps list as CSV</li>
    <li>Add install history feature</li>
    <li>Add mirror chooser setting</li>
    <li>Add prevent screenshots setting</li>
    <li>Show tool-tips for all app bar buttons</li>
    <li>Create 3-dot overflow menu for My Apps for less frequently used actions</li>
    <li>Persist sort order of My Apps</li>
    <li>Adapt strings according to Material Design 3 guidelines</li>
    <li>Apply string suggestions (Thanks Lucas)</li>
    <li>Fix missing icon bug in pre-approval dialog</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Note that if you are already using F-Droid Basic version <code>1.23.x</code>, you won’t receive this update automatically. You need to navigate to the app inside F-Droid and toggle “Allow beta updates” in top right three dot menu.</em></p>

<p>In apps news, we’re slowly getting back on track with post Debian upgrade fixes <em>(if your app still uses Java 17 is there a chance you can upgrade to 21?)</em> and post FOSDEM delays. Every app is important to us, yet actions like the Google one above waste the time we could have put to better use in Gitlab.</p>



<p><strong><a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.billthefarmer.buses">Buses</a></strong>  was updated to <code>1.10</code> after a two year hiatus.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/eu.siacs.conversations">Conversations</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/im.quicksy.client">Quicksy</a></strong> were updated to <code>2.19.10+free</code> improving on cleaning up after banned users, a better QR workflow and better tablet rotation support. These are nice, but another change raises our interest, <em>“Play Store flavor: Stop using Google library and interface directly with Google Play Service via IPC”</em>. Sounds interesting for your app too? Is this a path to having one single version for both F-Droid and Play that is fully FLOSS? We don’t know yet, but we salute any trick that removes another proprietary dependency from the code. If curious feel free to take a look at <a href="https://codeberg.org/iNPUTmice/Conversations/commit/1abb22b542343642aacb4f7bd82f0bb2bc380ea4">the commit</a>.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.dolphinemu.dolphinemu">Dolphin Emulator</a></strong> was updated to <code>2512</code>. We missed one version in between so the changelogs are huge, luckily the devs publish highly detailed posts about updates. So we’ll start with <a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2025/09/16/dolphin-progress-report-release-2509/">“Release 2509”</a> <em>(about 40 mins to read)</em>, we side-track with <a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2025/11/14/starlight-spotlight/">“Starlight Spotlight: A Hospital Wii in a New Light”</a> <em>(for about 50 mins)</em>, we continue to the current release in <a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2025/12/22/dolphin-progress-report-release-2512/">“Release 2512”</a> <em>(40 more minutes)</em> and we finish with <a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2026/02/16/rise-of-the-triforce/">“Rise of the Triforce”</a> delving in history for more than one hour.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/ru.tech.imageresizershrinker">Image Toolbox</a></strong> was updated to <code>3.6.1</code> adding many fixes and… <a href="https://github.com/T8RIN/ImageToolbox/releases/tag/3.6.0">some AI tools</a>. <em>Were you expecting such helpers?

  Calculus of Constructions (the type theory at the top of the lambda cube) with
  bidirectional typing, dependent function types, and a type-in-type universe,
  all in a single OCaml gist of ~60–80 lines. It can express length-indexed

  <p>🤖 MiniML demonstrates the absolute floor for a native-code ML compiler. Using
  Camlp4 for parsing and OCaml's LLVM bindings, it supports integer arithmetic,
  conditionals, and recursive first-order functions. Xavier Leroy noted the
  critical caveat: this is not truly "Mini-ML" since it lacks higher-order
  first-class functions — adding closures and garbage collection would
  significantly expand the codebase. Still, it shows what LLVM enables in ~100
  lines.</p>

<p>A federal judge has rejected Tesla’s bid to overturn a $243 million jury verdict over a fatal 2019 Autopilot crash in Florida, dealing a significant blow to the automaker’s legal strategy as it faces a growing wave of lawsuits tied to its driver-assistance technology.</p>



<p>U.S. District Judge Beth Bloom in Miami ruled that the evidence at trial “more than supported” the verdict and that Tesla raised no new arguments to justify setting it aside. The ruling, made public on Friday, means Tesla’s last hope to avoid paying the massive judgment at the trial court level has been exhausted.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-crash-and-the-verdict">The crash and the verdict</h2>



<p>The case stems from a deadly 2019 collision in Key Largo, Florida. George McGee was driving his Tesla Model S with Autopilot engaged when he dropped his phone and bent down to retrieve it. The vehicle blew through a stop sign and a flashing red light at approximately 62 mph, slamming into a parked Chevrolet Tahoe.</p>



<p>The crash killed 22-year-old Naibel Benavides Leon and severely injured her boyfriend, Dillon Angulo, who was 26 at the time.</p>	
	



<p>In August 2025, a Miami federal jury <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/08/01/tesla-tsla-is-found-liable-in-fatal-autopilot-crash-has-to-pay-329-million/">found Tesla liable for the crash</a>, assigning 33% of the blame to the automaker. The jury awarded $43 million in compensatory damages and $200 million in punitive damages — the first major plaintiff victory against Tesla in an Autopilot-related wrongful death case.</p>



<p>Tesla had rejected a $60 million settlement offer before the trial. That decision cost the company dearly.</p>



<h2 id="h-tesla-s-failed-arguments">Tesla’s failed arguments</h2>



<p>In August 2025, Tesla’s lawyers filed <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/08/29/tesla-asks-court-to-throw-out-243-million-verdict-in-fatal-autopilot-crash-case/">a 71-page motion asking the court to throw out the verdict</a> or grant a new trial. The company argued the verdict “flies in the face of basic Florida tort law, the Due Process Clause, and common sense.” Tesla also claimed that references to CEO Elon Musk’s statements about Autopilot during the trial misled the jury.</p>



<p>Judge Bloom was unconvinced. Her ruling found Tesla presented no new arguments that warranted overturning the jury’s decision.</p>



<p>Tesla has indicated it will appeal the verdict to a higher court. The company has also pointed to a pre-trial agreement that it claims would cap punitive damages at three times compensatory damages, which could reduce the final payout. But even under that interpretation, Tesla is still looking at a nine-figure judgment.</p>



<p>Attorney&nbsp;Brett Schreiber, lead trial counsel for the plaintiffs, sent Electrek the following statement:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“We are of course pleased, but also completely unsurprised that the honorable Judge Bloom upheld the jury’s verdict finding Tesla liable for the integral role Autopilot and the company’s misrepresentations of its capabilities played in the crash that killed&nbsp;Naibel&nbsp;and permanently injured Dillon. Tesla’s arguments were simply an attempt to relitigate the court’s pre-trial rulings. We look forward to continuing our work holding Tesla accountable for its lies and gross misconduct in courts across America.”&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 id="h-the-autopilot-lawsuit-floodgates-are-open">The Autopilot lawsuit floodgates are open</h2>



<p>This ruling lands at a particularly difficult moment for Tesla’s legal exposure. Since losing the landmark August 2025 trial, <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/08/07/tesla-autopilot-lawsuit-floodgates-are-open-lawyer-who-beat-tesla-round-2/">the Autopilot lawsuit floodgates have opened</a>. Tesla has <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/11/17/tesla-settles-another-lawsuit-autopilot-crash-4th-losing-trial/">settled at least four additional Autopilot crash lawsuits</a> rather than risk more verdicts, including a case involving the death of 15-year-old in California.</p>



<p>New lawsuits continue to pile up. In January 2026, <a href="https://electrek.co/2026/01/06/tesla-sued-over-family-killed-in-tragic-model-x-crash-as-flood-of-lawsuits-keep-opening/">Tesla was sued over a Model X crash that killed an entire family of four</a> when the vehicle allegedly veered into oncoming traffic. Electrek is aware of dozens more cases are working through the courts.</p>



<p>The legal pressure has been compounded by regulatory action. In December 2025, a California judge ruled that Tesla’s use of “Autopilot” in its marketing was misleading and violated state law, calling “Full Self-Driving” a name that is “actually, unambiguously false.”</p>



<p>Just this week, <a href="https://electrek.co/2026/02/18/tesla-avoids-30-day-california-sales-suspension-after-dropping-misleading-autopilot-marketing/">Tesla avoided a 30-day California sales suspension</a> only by agreeing to drop the “Autopilot” branding entirely. Tesla has since discontinued Autopilot as a standalone product in the U.S. and Canada.</p>



<p>This lands weight to one of the main arguments used in lawsuits since the landmark case: Tesla has been misleading customers into thinking that its driver assist features (Autopilot and FSD) are more capable than they are – leading drivers to pay less attention.</p>



<h2 id="h-electrek-s-take">Electrek’s Take</h2>



<p>This ruling is important, but it’s not surprising. Tesla’s motion to throw out the verdict was always a long shot. The company essentially argued that references to Elon Musk’s own public claims about Autopilot, claims that Tesla actively used to sell the feature for years, were somehow unfair to present to a jury. Judge Bloom was right to reject that argument.</p>



<p>The bigger picture here is that Tesla’s Autopilot legal liability is snowballing. The company rejected a $60 million settlement, lost a $243 million verdict, failed to overturn it, and now faces an appeal that will likely drag on while dozens of similar cases are working their way through the courts. </p>




	<p>Tesla is settling cases left and right to avoid further discovery and more damaging verdicts, but the financial exposure is mounting fast.</p>



<p>We are talking billions of dollars in potential settlements and verdicts over the next few years.</p>



<p>We’ve been covering Tesla’s Autopilot issues for years, and the pattern is clear: Tesla marketed Autopilot in a way that encouraged drivers to over-rely on it, failed to implement adequate safeguards, such as geofencing, and then blamed drivers when things went wrong. A jury, a federal judge, and now a California administrative judge have all reached the same conclusion. At some point, the cost of defending these cases, both financially and reputationally, will force Tesla to fundamentally change how it approaches driver-assistance technology.</p>



<p>It’s already happening.</p>
