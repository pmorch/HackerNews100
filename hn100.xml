<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span><span><span><span><span>Rates of new-onset type 2 diabetes climbed 62%—and type 1 diabetes increased 17%—among US youth after the COVID-19 pandemic began, especially in Black and Hispanic children, according to a </span></span><a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2809781"><span><span>study</span></span></a><span><span> published yesterday in <em>JAMA Network Open</em>.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>For the study, Kaiser Permanente researchers tracked rates of type 1 and type 2 diabetes among health system members aged 0 to 19 years in southern California with no history of diabetes from January 2016 to December 2021. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>"Youth-onset diabetes is a serious chronic health condition, placing individuals at risk for early complications, comorbidities, and excess mortality, in particular among those who develop type 2 diabetes and those from racial and ethnic minority groups such as non-Hispanic Black individuals," the study authors wrote.</span></span></span></p>

<h3><span><span><span><span><strong><span><span>Kids aged 10 to 19 years especially affected</span></span></strong></span></span></span></span></h3>

<p><span><span><span>Over the study period, 1,200 youth were diagnosed as having type 1 diabetes, 1,100 diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, and 63 patients with "other" diabetes. Type 1 diabetes rates climbed from 18.5 per 100,000 person-years in 2016 to 2019 to 22.4 per 100,000 person-years from 2020 to 2021. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Relative to 2016 to 2019, in 2020 to 2021, the incidence of new-onset type 1 diabetes was 17% higher (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 1.17). The incidence was higher among patients aged 10 to 19 years (IRR,1.17), boys (IRR, 1.18), and Hispanic patients (1.21). </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Rates of type 2 diabetes were 62% higher (IRR, 1.62) in 2020 to 2021 than in 2016 to 2019. The incidence of type 2 diabetes rose from 14.8 to 24.7 per 100,000 person-years over that time.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Rates were higher among patients aged 10 to 19 years (IRR, 1.63), girls (IRR, 1.44), boys (IRR, 1.83), Black patients (IRR, 1.95), Hispanic patients (IRR, 1.61), and other/unknown racial groups (IRR, 2.96). The incidence rate differences followed similar patterns for both type 1 and type 2 diabetes.</span></span></span></p>

<h3><span><span><span><span><strong><span><span>Black, Hispanic patients had heavy diabetes burden</span></span></strong></span></span></span></span></h3>

<p><span><span><span>By quarter, rates of type 1 diabetes fluctuated seasonally but climbed among patients aged 10 to 19 years in Q1 of 2021. Among youth with type 2 diabetes, a spike in incidence occurred in Q3 and Q4 of 2020, especially among Black and Hispanic patients, which the researchers said suggests that they bore a disproportionate burden of type 2 diabetes.</span></span></span></p>

<blockquote>
<p><span><span><span>Diabetes risk factors may have been exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic including limited physical activity, increased sedentary behaviors, sleep disturbances, and increased intake of processed foods.</span></span></span></p>
</blockquote>

<p><span><span><span>Sociodemographic factors, average body mass index, fasting and random glucose levels, and hemoglobin A<sub>1c</sub>&nbsp;concentrations didn't change from 2016 to 2021. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>The authors noted that research has shown that coronavirus-binding via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors damages islet cells in the pancreas and may lead to diabetes. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>"Hyperglycemia and insulin resistance have been noted in patients with COVID-19 infection without prior indicators of diabetes risk," they wrote. "Additionally, diabetes risk factors may have been exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic including limited physical activity, increased sedentary behaviors, sleep disturbances, and increased intake of processed foods." </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>The findings, they added, point to the need for future research on physiologic and behavioral risk factors for new-onset diabetes before and during the pandemic.</span></span></span></p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a href="#introduction" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>Postgres queue tech is a thing of beauty, but far from mainstream. Its relative obscurity is partially attributable to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult">cargo cult</a> of “scale”. The scalability cult has decreed that there are several queue technologies with greater “scalability” than Postgres, and for that reason alone, Postgres isn’t suitably scalable for anyone’s queueing needs. The cult of scalability would rather we build applications that scale beyond our wildest dreams than ones that solve real problems beyond our wildest dreams. Postgres’ operational simplicity be dammed; scale first, operate later.</p>
<p>Yet some intrepid technologists, such as those at <a href="https://webapp.io/blog/postgres-is-the-answer/">webapp.io</a> have risked excommunication – their product relies on Postgres queues for core functionality. Companies like webapp.io are an exception to the norm, recognizing that sometimes other principles outweigh “scalability”. When the cult of scalability fractures, the fractures are often small, but they congeal around new principles like operational simplicity, maintainability, understandability, and familiarity. Sometimes they congeal around new ideas like reusing old tech in <a href="https://fly.io/blog/all-in-on-sqlite-litestream/">novel ways</a>, or using Postgres for queues. You, too, should dare risking excommunication from the cult of scalability.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-postgres-queue-tech">What is Postgres queue tech?<a href="#what-is-postgres-queue-tech" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>Postgres queue tech consists of two parts: announcing and listening for new jobs (pub/sub) and mutual exclusion (row locks). Both are provided out-of-the-box since Postgres 9.5, released in 2016.</p>
<p>By combining <code>NOTIFY</code> and <code>LISTEN</code>, Postgres makes adding pub/sub to any application trivial. In addition to pub/sub, Postgres also provides one-job-per-worker semantics with <code>FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED</code>. Queries with this suffix acquire <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/explicit-locking.html#LOCKING-ROWS">row locks</a> on matching records, and ignore any records for which locks are already held. Applied to <code>job</code> records, this feature enables simple queue processing queries, e.g. <code>SELECT * FROM jobs ORDER BY created_at FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED LIMIT 1</code>.</p>
<p>Combined, these two features form the basis for resource-efficient queue processing. Importantly <code>SKIP LOCKED</code> provides an “inconsistent” view of one’s data. That inconsistency is exactly what is needed from a queue; jobs already being processed (i.e. row-locked) are invisible to other workers, offering distributed mutual exclusion. These locks pave the way for both periodic batch processing, and real-time job processing by <code>NOTIFY</code>ing <code>LISTEN</code>ers of new jobs.</p>
<p>Despite these Postgres features having many users, there are relatively few public advocates for combining them as a queue backend. For example, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20022572">this Hacker News comment</a> stated that using Postgres this way is “hacky” and the commenter received no pushback. I found the comment to be load of BS and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man">straw man arguments</a>. This thinking seems to be “the prevailing wisdom” of the industry – if you want to talk about queue technology in public, it better not be a relational database. This industry of cargo cults has little appetite for pushing back on whatever wisdom is “prevailing”. I hope to disimbue anyone of the notion that Postgres is an inferior queue technology.</p>
<p>We’ll use “background jobs” as the pretext for this discussion since adding background job processing to applications is a common decision made by developers, which can have far-reaching implications for system maintenance burden. We can think of “background jobs” as any sort of potentially long-running task such as “generate a report and email it to a customer”, or “process an image and convert it to several other formats”. These sorts of use cases generally necessitate queues.</p>
<h2 id="the-background-job-landscape">The background job landscape<a href="#the-background-job-landscape" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>Like all technology decisions, choosing how to process long-running tasks is a choice with many tradeoffs. In the past decade, the tech industry has seemingly come to a consensus that there are a few good tools for queuing long-running tasks for processing:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://redis.io/">Redis</a> is a wonderful in-memory data store and “message broker”^ that is the backend for many popular background job libraries</li>
<li><a href="https://kafka.apache.org/">Apache Kafka</a> A distributed “event streaming platform” maintained by the Apache Foundation</li>
<li><a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/">RabbitMQ</a> Allegedly the most widely deployed “message broker”^</li>
<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/">Amazon SQS</a> An Amazon SaaS product for highly scalable queues</li>
</ul>
<p>My apologies if I’ve excluded your favorite(s); this is not meant to be exhaustive.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>^ “Message broker” simply means that a queue system does other fancy stuff on top of being a queue, but for our discussion, let’s consider message brokers queues. There are multiple words and phrases that I consider effectively synonymous with “queue” and “queue processing”: “message broker(ing)”, “stream processing”, “streaming data”, etc. I’m aware that these mean specific things that are not exactly “queue” or “queue processing”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think it’s important to pause here and discuss Redis’ significance in the world of “background jobs”. If you browse the <a href="https://github.com/topics/background-jobs">background jobs GitHub topic</a>, the top five most popular libraries are all backed by Redis:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq">Sidekiq</a> (ruby)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/resque/resque">resque</a> (ruby)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rq/rq">rq</a> (python)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/HangfireIO/Hangfire">Hangfire</a> (C#)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/hibiken/asynq">asynq</a> (go)</li>
</ol>
<p>There’s a reason for this; because Redis stores data in memory, both its insertion and retrieval speed are phenomenal. It also has a pub-sub API built in, and with native <code>list</code> and <code>set</code> data structure which, when combined, <a href="https://redis.com/glossary/redis-queue/">make for a fantastic queue</a>. Redis <em>scales</em>. For many developers, that scalability has made it the default choice, and defaults are profoundly powerful.</p>
<p>But before choosing Redis because it scales well, consider this quote from Ben Johnson’s <a href="https://fly.io/blog/all-in-on-sqlite-litestream/">I’m All-In on Server-Side SQLite</a>. It’s specifically talking about database scalability, but the statement holds for scaling all sorts of infrastructure, like queues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When we think about new database architectures, we’re hypnotized by scaling limits. If it can’t handle petabytes, or at least terabytes, it’s not in the conversation. But most applications will never see a terabyte of data, even if they’re successful. We’re using jackhammers to drive finish nails.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As an industry, we’ve become absolutely obsessed with “scale”. Seemingly at the expense of all else, like simplicity, ease of maintenance, and reducing developer cognitive load. We all want to believe that we’re building the next thing that will demand Google, Facebook, or Uber scale, but the fact is, we’re almost always – not. Our technology decisions should reflect that fact. We’re more likely building for relatively small scale, and should be optimizing our decisions around a completely different set of factors that have more to do with team composition than technological superiority.</p>
<p>When we’re starting projects and businesses, we should be optimizing for everything <em>but</em> scale at the outset. Of course, we don’t want to back ourselves into a corner with technology decisions, but we also don’t want to build Kubernetes clusters to serve marketing sites for products that are likely to fail for every reason <em>but</em> the fact that they don’t scale well. We should be thinking about what technologies we <em>know well</em>, what is <em>good enough</em>, and what is the <em>least toilsome</em> solution that meets user needs and our team’s skill sets. Be proud of choosing “good enough” over “the best”; sometimes “the best” is simply a more difficult path to inevitable failure. List in your head every product that failed because it couldn’t scale. There’s a much longer list of products that failed long before they needed to.</p>
<p>What hasn’t been said yet, is that Postgres <em>actually does scale well.</em> But Postgres is general-purpose software, and it’s not going to be “the best” at scaling for queue use cases. It’s going to perform pretty well for that use case, just like it performs pretty well doing everything that it does.</p>
<h2 id="making-decisions">Making decisions<a href="#making-decisions" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>If you’re here and feel like you’ve seen enough of what I have to say, feel free to abandon this page and scroll through Dan McKinley’s <a href="https://boringtechnology.club/">choose boring technology</a> slide deck. I’m confident that whether you finish this post or Dan’s slide deck, you’ll make similar decisions when it comes to your next queue technology choice. After all, Dan’s “Choose Boring Technology” talk was the inspiration for this post’s title.</p>
<hr>
<p>The most important question to ask when making technology decisions is: what technologies am I currently using and understand well?</p>
<p>The answer to this question informs the “cost” of choosing technologies for your software stack. Technologies already in use are, presumably, cheap. Assuming they’re well understood.</p>
<p>There’s a good chance that you’re already using a relational database, and if that relational database is Postgres, you should consider it for queues before any other software. If you’re not using Postgres, you should consider whatever is the most boring technology to you, before considering anything else.</p>

      <figcaption>When costs are low, choose any. Source: https://boringtechnology.club</figcaption>
    
  </figure>


<p>Technologies not (yet) in use are more expensive.</p>

    <img src="https://adriano.fyi/img/choose_boring_tech_cost2.jpeg" alt="making technology choices">
    
      <figcaption>When costs are high, choose few. Source: https://boringtechnology.club</figcaption>
    
  </figure>


<p>In other words, boring technology is relative to what is already in use. Applications that are oriented around message-passing, like notification systems, might consider RabbitMQ boring technology. Caching applications might consider Redis boring technology. Applications with a large amount of relational data might consider Postgres boring technology. The maximally boring choice is likely the right one for you and your team.</p>
<p>If you’re not already using Redis, Kafka, RabbitMQ, or SQS, adopting any one of them <em>only</em> for background jobs is expensive. You’re adding a new system dependency to every development, test, and production environment, likely for the rest of the application’s life. A new set of skills is now required of every future Developer, DBA, and/or SRE role on the team. Now they need to know these new systems’ intricate failure modes and configuration knobs. Job candidates must be convinced that learning this new technology is a worthwhile time investment. DBAs/SREs need to know how to recover from operational failure, diagnose problems, and monitor performance. There’s a lot to know; and there’s a lot that nobody on the team realizes they need to know. These systems’ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_are_unknown_unknowns">unknown unknowns</a> are a risk. Especially if these systems are a default choice for you, and you haven’t put a lot of though into <em>why</em> they’re your default choice.</p>
<p>This is not all to say that the most boring technology is a panacea – Postgres included. What one gives up for familiarity, known failure modes, and amortized “cost” might be paid for in performance, or some other vital principle. After all, pushing and popping from a Postgres queue is considerably slower than Redis. Using Postgres for queues may mean that instead of having a single relational database on a single server, applications now require an “application” database and a “queue” database. It may even mean an entirely separate database server for background jobs, so background jobs are independently scalable. It may mean databases need to be <code>VACUUM</code>ed more frequently, incurring a performance hit in the process. There are <em>many</em> implications that one should consider before adopting Postgres for queues, and they should be weighed against team and application needs so that an informed decision can be made. Postgres shouldn’t be a <em>default</em> choice. Similarly, neither should Redis, Kafka, RabbitMQ, SQS, or any other distributed queue. Choosing boring technology should be one’s default choice.</p>
<p>Technology choices are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtles_all_the_way_down">tradeoffs all the way down</a>. I found that <a href="https://dagster.io/blog/skip-kafka-use-postgres-message-queue#how-we-measured">Dagster had a pragmatic approach</a> to adopting Postgres for their queues. When in doubt, consider the following an axiom:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If and only if boring technology is provably unable to meet demands should alternatives be considered.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="build-with-escape-hatches">Build with escape hatches<a href="#build-with-escape-hatches" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>Earlier I mentioned “not getting backed into a corner”. With respect to background jobs, that means application code for processing jobs should be queue-agnostic.</p>
<p>One day’s cutting edge tech is another day’s boring tech. As applications grow and success is achieved, new technologies tend to get bolted on to applications out of necessity. It’s common to add <a href="https://www.memcached.org/">memcached</a> or Redis as caching layers (but do consider Postgres <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createtable.html#SQL-CREATETABLE-UNLOGGED">unlogged tables</a> first!). That means these technologies become “boring” over time, reducing their cost, and changing the calculus for using them as queues.</p>
<p>Building with escape hatches is all about abstraction. Earlier I listed the top five most popular background job libraries on GitHub. Except for <a href="https://github.com/HangfireIO/Hangfire">Hangfire</a>, none of those libraries provide an escape hatch to queue technologies other than Redis. That means switching queues requires rewriting application code because there’s no robust abstraction in front of the underlying queue.</p>
<p>It shouldn’t be that way. Queue tech should be abstracted away, so users can choose the right queue for the job. I’m not a Hangfire (or C#) user, but Hangfire appears to have gotten the abstraction right.</p>
<p>It was with the preceding philosophy of choosing boring tech and building with escape hatches that I built Neoq (<a href="https://github.com/acaloiaro/neoq)">https://github.com/acaloiaro/neoq)</a>. Neoq queues can be in-memory, Postgres, or Redis (contributions for your favored boring tech welcome!). Users can switch between queues without changing any application code – simply initialize it with a different queue backend. Neoq is more abstraction than it is concrete implementation. While both the in-memory and Postgres implementations are first-party, the Redis implementation is <a href="https://github.com/hibiken/asynq">asynq</a>. It’s more about providing escape hatches than locking developers into a specific underlying queue technology.</p>
<p>I’d love to see more neoq-like libraries for languages other than Go. I think the lack of software libraries with escape hatches is what backs a lot of developers into a corner, forcing them to begin simple projects with a Redis dependency, long before Redis is warranted. Redis is fantastic, but it’s not always the right queue, or right amount of complexity for the job. The same goes for Kafka, RabbitMQ, and SQS.</p>
<h2 id="choosing-postgres-queue-tech">Choosing Postgres queue tech<a href="#choosing-postgres-queue-tech" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>I hope this post encourages others to risk excommunication from the cult of scale the next time they’re choosing queue technology. There are so many important principles that are not “scale” to consider when choosing technologies. Make boring technology your default choice, and choose Postgres if it bores you.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

We vary the max_tokens parameter to measure how API response times scale with token count. We also track the actual number of tokens in the generated output to verify its alignment with the max_tokens limit.</p><p>We use scatter points for individual latency measurements and box plots to show the spread and median latency per model and token count.

        <small>2023-09-24</small>
        <p>The nine nines. 99.9999999% of uptime. Whether the AXD301 actually deserves to be held up as a system of nine nines seems debatable. I am not particularly interested in that debate. Erlang has a strong record for reliability and a design intended to help you as a developer and operator achieve your nines. Maybe just five of them. Up to you really.</p>
<p>Previous episodes of this article series has unpacked <a href="https://underjord.io/unpacking-elixir-concurrency.html">Concurrency</a>, <a href="https://underjord.io/unpacking-elixir-realtime-latency.html">Real-time &amp; Latency</a> and <a href="https://underjord.io/unpacking-elixir-syntax.html">the syntax</a>. In this one we talk about how Elixir and Erlang achieve reliability.</p>
<p>There are agressive, defensive and rigorous practices you can adopt in a variety of ways to achieve reliability and resilience. Testing, profiling, specifications, design, observability, culture, operations and so on. This is not about most of those. This is about software abstractions that serve you in making your system more resilient and allow you to construct resilient designs.</p>
<p>Erlang implements the Actor model, the typical actor in Erlang and Elixir terminology is the GenServer. The generic server. It is a process that has some nice facilities for receiving calls (“synchronous” messages, expecting a response within a timeout) and casts (asynchronous messages, with no expectation of reply). A GenServer is a bunch of API wrapped around the basic Erlang process. A process can receive and send messages. A GenServer (also other related types, gen_event, gen_statem) implements capturing errors that occur and the subsequent exit and passing information about the problems to the parental process as a message.</p>
<p>So what is the parental process. Well it is usually a special type of Erlang process called a Supervisor. A Supervisor can run multiple child processes that implement the necessary API for being a child. The Supervisor then handle problems with the children falling over by applying a strategy.</p>
<p>The strategies are normally <code>one_for_one</code>, <code>one_for_all</code> and <code>one_for_rest</code>. One for one indicates that if a child crashes it, it and only it should be considered when restarting. Leave the others alone. One for all means that the supervisor should restart all children if one child fails. This is often useful if the children are sharing a workload in some important way where restarting one would cause trouble with the others. One for rest is kind of nuanced in that the Supervisor will restart any child defined in the starting order after the crashing one. This can be used to kill a supporting process if the main one dies for example.</p>
<p>So a Supervisor supervises a set of child processes. This set can be dynamic, growing and shrinking as the system operates. In Elixir that would be a DynamicSupervisor. If a single crash happens within a child it will apply the strategy. If the new child crashes immediately it will try again. If there are enough failures within a given threshold the Supervisor will consider itself failing at the job and crash.</p>
<p>This crashing is a feature, not a bug. By crashing it will propagate a signal to whatever Supervisor started this Supervisor that there is an issue. This Supervisor can in turn apply strategies to try and recover the Supervisor through the tried and true practice of turning it off and on again. Or via custom logic if you are feeling spicy.</p>
<p>How many restarts, how often, how intense it is allowed to get. That’s all configurable. You might be fine with the defaults but if you have something particular in mind you have a pretty solid set of knobs to twiddle.</p>
<p>By having Supervisors supervise Supervisors all the way back to the root Supervisor which sits on top of your particular Erlang application we have defined a supervision tree. The idea being that any issue out in a nice leaf node of a tree is probably addressable there and should not affect the rest of your nice stateful actor-packed system. But if it isn’t, it is probably addressable at a branch closer to the tree.</p>
<p>A typical use-case for a Supervisor is a connection pool. And it might be the case that if any of the connections crash that indicates a problem with the server and you know from experience that you might as well re-establish every connection in the pool. Cool. Your Supervisor should do <code>one_for_all</code>. While if a phone-call crashes you probably don’t want to dump out every call in the system just because one had a weird issue. <code>one_for_one</code> should do it.</p>
<p>This is where the Erlang “Let it Crash” idea comes from. It is a bit of a meme (often repeated, poorly examined, often misunderstood, sometimes with funny pictures). Fundamentally, if there is nothing useful your code can do on a failure, no mitigation, no meaningful fallback, then you might as well have it blow up and rely on the underlying tree to make whatever is most useful out of it. You should probably handle the usual suspects “oh, data is missing, let’s 404”. That is an expected failure mode. “oh, hard drive has imploded and disk can’t be read” is a very different error and a 500 Internal Server Error is probably fine.</p>
<p>I don’t think I’ve seen an up-and-running Elixir application go down due to exhausting the Supervision tree with erroring out. I have seen it many times as a failure mode for a misconfigured deploy, typically missing an env variable, where starting the initial supervision tree fails.</p>
<p>Supervision is the fundamental building block in Erlang’s resilience story.</p>
<p>How is it used in Elixir? Not much. As in, we don’t typically need to think about it. Phoenix ships a practical and helpful Supervision tree. Ecto ships a good Supervision tree for your database connections and all that. These Supervision trees live a peaceful secretive life under the guise of library code and you get all the advantage with none of the work. And the moment you start coloring outside the lines and building your own GenServers the facilities are there for you.</p>
<p>With your regular generated Phoenix web application all you see is that your <code>application.ex</code> file contains a few entries for different purposes. These are the first branches of your supervision tree and all that you really see.</p>
<p>You get <code>MyApp.Repo</code> for your Ecto Repo which is the abstraction for all your database connectivity, hiding your connection pools and whatnot. You get <code>MyApp.Endpoint</code> which wraps up your HTTP server (Cowboy or Bandit) in Plug and Phoenix abstractions to respond. Under this you will build up a subtree with a variety of jobs. For HTTP requests you have processes that respond. I believe Cowboy uses a pool and Bandit spawns more ad-hoc. There are also the WebSockets and the specific Phoenix Channels or LiveView processes that belong to the state of your application. This all branches out from your Endpoint as it is all related to your web serving.</p>
<p>You can hear more about <a href="https://www.beamrad.io/53">how Bandit operates</a> on the BEAM Radio episode we did with Mat Trudel. We got into the process usage a decent bit there.</p>
<p>Separately you’ll have <code>MyApp.PubSub</code> which starts the Process Groups (pg2) or Redis adapter for doing cool PubSub stuff. This is not strictly web-related, so it has a separate sub-tree. Someone did a thinking.</p>
<p>I appreciate that Phoenix doesn’t try to hide this stuff from you any more than abstracting away the details. If you want to run your app without the web part you can quickly get to the idea of dropping the Endpoint from the list. You simply don’t start it. Same with the DB, just cut out the Repo. Likewise if you need multiple DBs or multiple web services. You can make more Repos and Endpoints. It is explicit. The code is right there. It uses the standard Erlang and Elixir way of starting things.</p>
<p>Anyway, that’s a detour from resilience and reliability. Fundamentally you have these supervisors, strategies as a structure to contain the blast radius of errors. The places this approach falls down is if you build a native implemented function (NIF) in C or similar. A crash in that brings down the whole VM. This is why doing work in properly managed BEAM code is preferred in most cases and why you’ll often see attempts to re-implement things in Elixir/Erlang rather than just binding to an existing C library. Rust and Rustler, Zig and Zigler both offer NIF implementations with some additional safety. Of course they don’t entirely remove the risks of native code though.</p>
<p>Rustler uses <a href="https://medium.com/@jlouis666/erlang-dirty-scheduler-overhead-6e1219dcc7">dirty schedulers</a> and I expect Zigler does something similar or at least supports the old and the new options for building NIFs. So they should play nice-ish with Erlang scheduling. But fundamentally native code doesn’t quite offer the same safety or same behavior.</p>
<p>Beyond Supervision trees there are more aspects of Erlang that are resilient. Scheduling and pre-empting was intended to produce <a href="https://underjord.io/unpacking-elixir-realtime-latency.html">consistently low latencies</a> but it also protects you from heavy workloads bogging things down, it prevents infinitely looping bugs from slowing the system to a crawl and in general makes things resilient to things not being ideal all the time.</p>
<p>Another thing is the Erlang heart. That’s a module that can be used to detect the Erlang application itself going down and being able to start it again. An almost-supervisor for your entire application. The IoT <a href="https://nerves-project.org/">Nerves project</a> also uses a variant of this to help ensure a resilient device.</p>
<p>Having built in other web frameworks and languages this is all a bit foreign. It is more reminiscent of building a microservice architecture than building a single application. But it does occur at the application level. It gives you tools to think about bringing up your system, bringing down your system, handling failure in your system. Those concerns all exist in other languages but the control-mechanisms tend to be quite coarse. Erlang and Elixir helps you think about how you design your application.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>


<p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="326" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/258671812?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=44BBDD" width="580" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></p>
<p>On March 3<sup>rd</sup>, during a large East Coast winter storm, I headed to the ocean to capture some wave action. My travels eventually took me to Great Island Commons in New Castle, NH where Whaleback Lighthouse is prominently featured 0.8 miles offshore. I was hoping to capture big waves crashing around the lighthouse, and Mother Nature didn’t disappoint.</p>
<p>Great Island Common is a wide open park where people come to picnic during the summer and to watch the ocean during the winter. After arriving, I set up my tripod and my Canon 5D Mark IV with Sigma 150-600mm lens on a tripod and positioned myself just to the right of a tree in order to help reduce the pummeling Northerly winds. As many of you know, it’s a challenge keeping 600mm stable in high winds, even on a tripod.</p>
<p>I set the camera up and then waited until I saw a wave starting to hit the lighthouse. I then kept firing until the splash ended, not knowing ahead of time the action of the wave. Most shots never panned out, but about three of them over the course of about 45 minutes were pretty decent.</p>
<p>Once back at home, I culled through the images and choose one to edit and upload to Instagram, replacing an earlier upload that was done in haste while still in the parking lot.</p>
<p>When a local TV station shared the photo to their Facebook page (with permission) it started to receive a large amount of shares, comments, and likes; however, there was one comment that mentioned that I had stolen the image from another New England photographer, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ericgendronphotography/">Eric Gendon</a>. After letting the commenter know that it was indeed my image and that I possess the original RAW file, I headed over to the other photographers page and was blown away.</p>
<p>We had what looked like the exact same image, taken at the exact millisecond in time, from what looked like the same exact location and perspective.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dpreview.com/files/p/articles/7338941576/Eric_Ron_sidebyside.jpeg" target="article-7338941576"><img data-thumbnail-height="0" data-thumbnail-width="590" height="282" src="https://4.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS590x0~articles/7338941576/Eric_Ron_sidebyside.jpeg" width="590" data-filename="Eric_Ron_sidebyside.jpeg" srcset="https://4.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS1180x0~articles/7338941576/Eric_Ron_sidebyside.jpeg 2x"></a></p>
<p>Aside from choices made in Lightroom, the photos at first glance look virtually identical aside from water in front and some of the white caps being in different position. Even then, the white caps were identical in size and shape—and I know those things are easily moved using the clone stamp in Photoshop—so I was concerned that maybe MY image was stolen and altered a bit.</p>
<p>Initially, I only had access to his shared, low-resolution, image so I wasn’t able to make out some of the very fine details that ultimately helped to convince me that we both had originals. After overlaying and aligning the images in Photoshop I was blown away that the lighthouse and waves were carbon copies, almost to the pixel. As mentioned already, there were many differences in the foreground water and the white caps on the horizon, and it was these differences that held me back from claiming he stole my image.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until another local photographer started comparing my photo to a higher resolution version of Eric’s image that he noticed that the iron gating around the top of the lighthouse had slightly different spacing between the vertical bars compared to my image. This would indicate that the other photographer was likely standing just a little bit left of where I was standing.</p>
<p>Since the 60D uses an APS-C sensor he would have also likely been back a little further to compensate for the 1.6x “zoom” / crop of the sensor or using a shorter focal length to compensate. This would also explain the white caps being in different positions.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dpreview.com/files/p/articles/7338941576/Compare_with_circles.jpeg" target="article-7338941576"><img data-thumbnail-height="0" data-thumbnail-width="590" height="306" src="https://3.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS590x0~articles/7338941576/Compare_with_circles.jpeg" width="507" data-filename="Compare_with_circles.jpeg"></a></p>
<p>However, the fact that the lighthouse doesn’t really show any rotational changes—and the crashing wave is an exact match—makes this all the more remarkable that these were captured randomly from two different photographers.</p>
<p>The next morning, Eric woke up to a flood of messages from me as well as other photographers, and immediately contacted me to share his EXIF data, and to agree that it was astounding that we both captured the exact same image of water motion at the exact millisecond in time. What makes this even more amazing is that this wasn’t a planned event (aka. sporting event, shuttle launch, etc.).</p>
<p>I also didn’t know Eric—we each chose this location randomly, and we both shot with different cameras (60D and 5D Mark IV) with different size sensors.</p>
<p>The 60D has a burst mode of 5.3fps, the 5DMKIV is 7fps; we both used a 600mm focal length; our exposures and depth-of-field were almost the same as well (F8 aperture, ISO 400, 1/1600<sup>th</sup> shutter vs. F8, ISO 320, 1/1000<sup>th</sup> shutter); and, ultimately, we both selected the same photo from that day to promote. Come to find out we were only <em>28 meters away from each other</em>. He was hunkered down under a picnic enclosure to help block some of the wind and I was up against a tree to help reduce the wind.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dpreview.com/files/p/articles/7338941576/Photographers_Position.jpeg" target="article-7338941576"><img data-thumbnail-height="0" data-thumbnail-width="590" height="507" src="https://3.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS590x0~articles/7338941576/Photographers_Position.jpeg" width="590" data-filename="Photographers_Position.jpeg"></a></p>
<p>I did a Google search to see how often this happens and could only find one article from 2011 where two photographers filming a surf competition on Huntington Beach ended up catching a virtually identical image of a surfer and its wave action.</p>
<p>If you shoot water in burst mode you know how different each exposure is even when the difference in time is just 1/7<sup>th</sup> of a second between shots. And I have been leading night-sky photography workshops for five years and have had well over 200 photographers who are often aiming at the same subject, shooting with similar cameras and lenses, and capturing at the same moment in time, even doing continuous shooting for time lapse, and until now I have never seen two images that were so close as to be virtual clones of each other.</p>
<p>While this is a rare occurrence, I believe that with cameras getting faster and photographers taking more time to prepare for their shots, I have to imagine that these situations will happen more frequently. It happens every day with stationary or slow motion objects (buildings, sun/moon rise) but almost never with water movement.</p>
<p>One commenter on my FB post mentioned how this mistake brings to light the importance that post-processing plays in making your images your own. Here we had two essentially identical images—one edited to preserve a more natural feel, while the other image was edited to enhance the drama and emotion of the scene.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Let me introduce you to <a href="https://tomscii.sig7.se/umon">μMon</a>, my
personal, minimalist, opinionated take on host monitoring based on
<a href="https://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/">RRDtool</a>, SNMP, some lightweight
shell scripting, and a small FastCGI server written using a modest
subset of modern C++.</p>

<p>Migrating my monitoring setup to <em>μMon</em> also serves as a case study
in <em>complexity reduction,</em> which is the broader theme of this post.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Here is an example of how <em>μMon</em> might look like:</p>

<p><a href="https://tomscii.sig7.se/images/umon/aurora_main.png"><img src="https://tomscii.sig7.se/images/umon/aurora_main_thumb.jpg" alt=""></a><br>
<em>Main view of my Pinebook Pro (click to enlarge)</em></p>

<p>The above view covers the better part of my Pinebook Pro upgrading
itself to OpenBSD 7.1, compiling the whole system from source. The
vertical gaps are due to the machine being off.<sup><a href="#f1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Here is a second example with a different view on another host:</p>

<p><a href="https://tomscii.sig7.se/images/umon/hq_ups.png"><img src="https://tomscii.sig7.se/images/umon/hq_ups_thumb.jpg" alt=""></a><br>
<em>Upsc view of the server that brought you this webpage (click to enlarge)</em></p>

<p>This view captures a short planned test of my UPS (visible in the
middle).  Data is sourced directly from the output of the <code>upsc</code>
command, as opposed to
<a href="https://github.com/tomscii/upsc-snmp-agent">SNMP</a>.
(Yeah, I know. Time for a new UPS battery.)</p>

<h2 id="why-μmon">Why μMon?</h2>

<p>I created <em>μMon</em> due to my love of minimalism and how short
existing solutions fall from that ideal. Specifically, I migrated my
stack of Prometheus + Grafana that I have been running at home for the
last couple years to <em>μMon</em>. By doing so, I managed to finally get
rid of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A full-blown time-series database (with gigabytes
of rolling on-disk data).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Several Go binaries dozens of megabytes each, also consuming runtime
resources. (One of them got habitually stuck in an endless loop, so
I put in a crontab entry to restart it daily. I do not appreciate
black boxes like that.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Lengthy configuration files and lengthy argument lists to said
binaries.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Systems continuously talking to each other over the network (even
when nobody is looking at any dashboard), periodically pulling
metrics from nodes into Prometheus, which in turn runs all sorts of
consolidation routines on that data. A constant source of noise in
otherwise idling systems.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A mind-boggingly complex web front-end (Grafana) with its own
database, tons of JavaScript running in my browser, and role-based
access control over multiple users.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A bespoke query language to pull metrics into dashboards, and lots
of specialized knowledge in how to build useful dashboards.  It is
all meant to be intuitive, but man, is it complicated!  (People
write whole books on how to operate and use this!)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tons of eye candy I did not really mind, but did not really
appreciate either.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>No doubt this complex (and to me, opaque) stack would inevitably get
obsolete, necessitating migrations prone to failure, or demand my
attention in other, even less predictable ways. In short: keeping up
with the state of the art requires an ongoing investment.</p>

<p>I have a general inclination towards minimalism, and a preference for
long-term durable solutions that do not need continuous attention and
care. Having spent many years as a student of complexity (commonly
referred to as a career in IT), I have come to hate the kind of
surprises that complex (clever, if you will) systems are so prone to.
Nowadays, when I provision something, I ask: would this run for 10
years if I forgot about it? How long before it would break, or need to
be redeployed with a new (incompatible) major version? Or, if nothing
else, go hopelessly out of fashion (hello docker!)?</p>

<p>So I substituted all the above with an extremely lightweight stack
based on very well understood, several decades old concepts and
programs. I now have a system that is comprehensible in its scope and
size, and trivially understandable in its simplicity. I did this in
the hope that it will serve me for decades to come, without any undue
need of caring for it. In fact, my ambition was to solve the problem
of server monitoring <em>once and for all</em>, at least for all systems in
my care. This fits neatly into my overall strategy of establishing
fully autonomous, sustainable personal computing. Less bells and
whistles, less overhead and less <em>churn</em> equals less to worry about,
while keeping all the features actually needed.</p>

<p>By the way, I am not meaning to pick on Prometheus and Grafana in
particular. If you have used Cacti, Collectd, Graphite, InfluxDB,
Nagios, OpenNMS, Zabbix, or anything similar, then you will probably
agree that setting up and using any of these tools is anything but
simple. In fact, any monitoring stack will be similar to what I
described above in terms of its complexity.<sup><a href="#f2">2</a></sup>
Granted, if you get paid as a <del>sysadmin</del> <del><em>DevOps</em></del> <strong>Site
Reliability Engineer</strong>, you probably need to master some locally
useful combination of these comprehensive tools. If that is not your
job, and you want something <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle">simple and
stupid</a>, you might find
<em>μMon</em> interesting.</p>

<p>Keeping it simple and stupid is such a priority that as an all-time
reminder, I decided to include the word <em>simplicity</em> right in the
<em>μMon</em> logo I “designed”:</p>

<p><img src="https://tomscii.sig7.se/images/umon/umon_logo_black.png" alt=""></p>

<p>In total, I estimate that I spent the equivalent of <em>at most</em> one week
of full-time engineering work (scattered over about a month of
evenings and weekends) on creating <em>μMon</em>. Including the logo!</p>

<p>Granted, <em>μMon</em> does not cater to every need, only my very own —
and those are definitely modest. I do not run anything that could be
considered modern or fashionable; I only run a bunch of Unix boxes (a
mixture of Linux and BSD). No Docker (or podman), no ProxMox, no
Kubernetes. Anywhere I get to decide, I use stable, proven, old
technology. In addition, my monitoring needs are fairly modest: I only
want basic metrics. Most importantly, I do not use any fancy alerting
functionality.<sup><a href="#f3">3</a></sup> That could be added on top of what
exists in <em>μMon</em>, but it stands for a sizable chunk of complexity
in the “real” monitoring systems mentioned above; getting it right is
very non-trivial, and not just from a technical
perspective.<sup><a href="#f4">4</a></sup> Since the small-scale servers I run
work pretty much unattended year in and year out, this is fine — I
only want to be able to look at metrics to spot trends and interesting
times to investigate by looking at event logs, etc.</p>

<p>That said, <em>μMon</em> gives me everything I have ever gotten from my
old setup (mostly the “interesting subset” of the output of
<code>node_exporter</code>, plus the metrics of a custom <code>upsc</code> feeder I hacked
together). And there are distinct advantages to <em>μMon</em>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A well understood, constant-space storage model thanks to RRDtool. I
know exactly how much disk space the aggregated data takes, and more
importantly, I know it will never grow beyond that extent.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A well understood model of data consolidation and retention, built
on RRDtool’s consolidation functions. I can look back at anywhere
between the last one hour and the last two years, with the right
temporal resolution.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Independent nodes. Each host runs <em>μMon</em> on its own, both to
collect metrics and to serve the webpage. There is no single point
of collection, storage, or access to the system, nor a single point
of failure. (Arguably, this can be a disadvantage depending on your
perspective, but it matches my preference.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Very lightweight data collection. Each host collects its own metrics
in locally stored round-robin archives; data collection does not
incur any network activity. Configuration of metrics collection
equals listing the probes you want (but you can use all the power of
shell scripting, if you wish).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Very simple server setup. I use <code>(x)inetd</code> to serve the FastCGI of
<em>μMon</em> via a TCP socket to whatever web server I have on the host
(or a different host). The <em>μMon</em> collector script is run by cron.
Everything that belongs to <em>μMon</em> resides and runs under an
unprivileged user.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Extremely minimal dependencies. To install <em>μMon</em>, all I need is a
Unix system with a POSIX shell (<code>/bin/sh</code>), a modern C++ compiler,
and the ability to install <code>rrdtool</code>. No PHP (or other web toolkit),
no Python, no NodeJs. No database (time-series or relational). A
local webserver (with FastCGI support) is optional; a remote
webserver can act as the proxy as well.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Graphs (plots of certain groups of metrics) and views (collections
of graphs) can be created or modified any time, by editing simple,
small shell scripts. They can even be edited in place for immediate
effect (nothing to restart). Of course, knowledge of RRDtool and the
POSIX shell is mandatory, but then again, <em>μMon</em> is for hardcore
Unix sysadmins with modest needs.  Anything you need to know above
what is already etched into your brain you will find in the <code>rrd*</code>
man pages. But you can get started without changing anything.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="not-invented-here">Not invented here?</h2>

<p>You could argue that I am exhibiting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here">NIH
syndrome</a> by
inventing my own (inferior) solution to a problem space well
understood and explored by many, many others. You would perhaps not be
very wrong.</p>

<p>To my defense, let me state that I am not forcing (not even
encouraging) anyone to adopt and use <em>μMon</em>. Rather, I am showing
it here as a case study in the noble pursuit of complexity reduction,
something that I feel is getting more and more important.  Especially
when focusing on one’s own personal computing affairs.</p>

<h2 id="reduction-in-complexity">Reduction in complexity</h2>

<p>Here is a table to recap the transition from all-in to minimal
complexity. Note that this is <em>not</em> a moral stance against higher
complexity, which you might need for fully legitimate reasons (such as
requiring complex alerting over metrics aggregated from different
hosts) that <em>μMon</em> does not support.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I am not saying that “big solutions” are necessarily bad or wrong. But
I do want to argue that there is a place for small, perhaps even
bespoke, site-only solutions that can serve the common 80% of needs
just as well, at several orders of magnitude less complexity. All the
while retaining nimbleness to be extended to cover the remaining 20%,
when prompted by actual need. There is something to be said for a
(figurative) napkin’s worth of code hacked together in a man-week that
is capable of bringing the same ultimate value as a full-fledged stack
that was no doubt developed in what is probably several man-decades
(if not centuries) of engineering work.  Sometimes a simple, dumb
solution can be fairly robust and complete. I believe <em>μMon</em> is a
good illustration of this general idea.</p>

<p>At the same time, I feel this is ultimately less of a surprise than it
might first seem. Let us not forget that running Unix-descended or
Unix-like systems means we are standing on the shoulders of giants: we
have time-proven architectural tenets, open standards and systems
programming APIs, plus free development tools at our disposal. On top
of that, the venerable RRDtool embeds some pretty sophisticated,
time-honed data sampling and graph rendering logic.  Granted, it takes
an educated sysadmin to make use of it all (being a competent systems
programmer as well is a big plus), but that is pretty much the
original intended audience of these operating systems.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/tomscii/umon">μMon</a> is released to the public
under the BSD license (the same zero-clause flavour that OpenBSD
uses).  If you feel inclined to try it yourself, please recall that it
is not my goal to supply you (or the world) with a toolkit that works
out of the box and suits everyone. I am specifically not advocating
<em>μMon</em> as a direct substitute to any of the well-known monitoring
stacks.<sup><a href="#f5">5</a></sup> In the spirit of the BSD license, it is
simply my gift to the world. What you do with it (whether or not you
find it useful) is up to you.  At any rate, you are expected to read
your way through some simple shell scripts and adapt them to your
needs. That said, if you have educated questions or constructive
feedback (positive or negative) about it, feel free to <a href="https://tomscii.sig7.se/id/">contact
me</a>.</p>

<hr>

<p><b id="f1">1</b> The machine froze Friday night, which I did not
notice for over an hour. Apparently building the OpenBSD base system
with <code>-j 6</code> was too much to ask from the hardware, so I resumed with
my usual <code>-j 4</code>.</p>

<p><b id="f2">2</b> What looks like the closest existing solution to
<em>μMon</em> is a stack of programs called
<a href="https://wpd.home.xs4all.nl/symon/index.html">symon</a>, consisting of
(at least) <code>symon</code>, <code>symux</code> and <code>syweb</code>. This is also largely
RRDtool-based. But… the user needs to configure listeners with port
numbers just to get some data collection going; needs to install
RRDtool into a webserver chroot; needs a webserver with PHP enabled,
etc.</p>

<p><b id="f3">3</b> I do have my personal collection of cron-driven
scripts that check essentials (such as expired SSL certificates) and
email me if there is anything that needs my attention. I just prefer
to keep these things separate from monitoring data rates and disk
usage percentages.</p>

<p><b id="f4">4</b> I could rant about the incessant floods of useless
email/pager alerts coming from everywhere, seemingly so inseparable
from Big Tech Company Culture, complete with the inevitable result of
people ignoring/filtering them out, for a net result of precisely zero
business value achieved at a tremendous cost. But that is another post
patiently waiting to be written.</p>

<p><b id="f5">5</b> Let’s be real: <em>μMon</em> absolutely <em>does not</em>
support many of the important use cases of the more complicated
stacks. Do I care about any of it? Absolutely not. The point of this
exercise was not to create a rewrite of Prometheus + Grafana (they are
fine as is), but rather create something that is at least three orders
of magnitude smaller, while providing all the functionality I need.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Inside the row of workshops in an industrial stretch of Pacoima, men labored over hefty slabs of speckled stone, saws whining over the sounds of Spanish-language rock.</p><p>Pale dust rose around them as they worked. Many went without masks. Some had water spurting from their machines, but others had nothing to tamp down the powder rising in the air.</p><p>"Nobody uses water," one man in a Dodgers cap said in Spanish when Maria Cabrera approached, holding flyers about silicosis, an incurable and suffocating disease that has devastated dozens of workers across the state and killed men who have barely reached middle age.</p><p>Cabrera, a community outreach worker with the nonprofit Pacoima Beautiful, urged him and others at the Branford Street site to try to protect themselves. Silicosis can ravage the lungs of workers after they inhale tiny particles of crystalline silica while they cut and grind stone that contains the mineral.</p><p>The disease dates back centuries, but researchers say the booming popularity of countertops made of engineered stone, which has much <a href="https://www.osha.gov/sites/default/files/publications/OSHA3768.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:higher concentrations of silica;elm:context_link;itc:0">higher concentrations of silica</a> than many kinds of natural stone, has driven a new epidemic of an accelerated form of the suffocating illness. As the dangerous dust builds up and scars the lungs, the disease can leave workers short of breath, weakened and ultimately suffering from lung failure.</p><p>"You can get a transplant," Cabrera told the man in Spanish, "but it won't last."</p><p>In California, it has begun to debilitate young workers, largely Latino immigrants who cut and polish slabs of engineered stone. Instead of cropping up in people in their 60s or 70s after decades of exposure, it is now afflicting men in their 20s, 30s or 40s, said Dr. Jane Fazio, a pulmonary critical care physician who became alarmed by cases she saw at Olive View-UCLA Medical Center. Some California patients have <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6838a1.htm" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:died in their 30s;elm:context_link;itc:0">died in their 30s</a>.</p><p>"They're young guys who essentially have a terminal diagnosis," Fazio said.</p><p><b>Read more:</b> <a href="https://www.latimes.com/projects/community-civic-engagement-government-participation?utm_source=yahoo&amp;utm_medium=promo_module&amp;utm_campaign=rss_feed" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Shape Your L.A. — at the county level;elm:context_link;itc:0">Shape Your L.A. — at the county level</a></p><p>In Pacoima, a 27-year-old father said he now has to hustle home from the park with his 8-year-old daughter and 5-year-old son because his oxygen tank starts to run out as they play. Leobardo Segura Meza said he could no longer run around on the soccer field or exercise the way he used to.</p><p>Nor is he able to work. For a decade, he made a living by cutting, polishing and installing countertops in and around Los Angeles County. Dust was everywhere, he said, and he was given only a dust mask — one he said was inadequate for the job — to protect himself. Sometimes he brought a hose and tried to attach it to the machine to reduce dust, but there were no machines dispensing water as they were cutting, he said.</p><p>He began to suffer a cough that wouldn't go away and lost his breath when going up stairs, he said. His weight dropped. At one point, he was hospitalized when one of his lungs collapsed.</p><p>Segura Meza had never heard of silicosis before he was diagnosed. "There's no cure for this illness. The only thing they can do is a lung transplant," he said in Spanish.</p><p>What he fears, he said, is that as more workers grow ill, "there aren't enough lungs for us." At a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAsUzZtipiI" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:state hearing;elm:context_link;itc:0">state hearing</a> this summer, Segura Meza said two of his co-workers had already died waiting for transplants.</p><p>To warn workers about the threat, Cabrera and another Pacoima Beautiful outreach worker, Claudia Vasquez, made their rounds at the parking lot of the Home Depot in San Fernando, where laborers in long-sleeve shirts waited for people to drive up and offer them work. Few had heard of the disease.</p><p>"It's very dangerous, this illness?" asked one man in Spanish, leaning against a palm tree in the parking lot.</p><p>Cabrera told him there was no cure. She urged him to use wet saws to limit any dangerous dust rising in the air and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/index.htm" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:NIOSH;elm:context_link;itc:0">NIOSH</a>-approved respirators to avoid breathing it in. <a href="https://www.osha.gov/sites/default/files/publications/OSHA3768.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Workplace safety regulators;elm:context_link;itc:0">Workplace safety regulators</a> have recommended a suite of measures including water spraying systems, ventilation and vacuum systems to clear dust, in addition to protective respirators for workers — ones covering the entire face if silica levels in the air are high.</p><p>The risk is serious for workers in the industry: Although estimates of its prevalence vary from <a href="https://www.atsjournals.org/doi/full/10.1164/rccm.202008-3297LE" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:study;elm:context_link;itc:0">study</a> to <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31562234/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:study;elm:context_link;itc:0">study</a>, some <a href="https://www.9news.com.au/health/lung-disease-present-in-20-per-cent-of-queensland-stonemasons/778abf2c-f177-4334-ab9a-e144fd84b232" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:screenings;elm:context_link;itc:0">screenings</a> in Australia have found <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10423513/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:roughly 1 in 5;elm:context_link;itc:0">roughly 1 in 5</a> stone workers had the disease. In California, workplace safety regulators have <a href="https://www.dir.ca.gov/oshsb/documents/petition-597-CalOSHAeval.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:estimated;elm:context_link;itc:0">estimated</a> that out of roughly 4,000 workers in the industry across the state, silicosis will afflict between 485 and 848 — and that as many as 161 could ultimately die.</p><p>A recent <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/2807615" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:study;elm:context_link;itc:0">study</a> by UCLA and UCSF physicians found that among dozens of California workers who got silicosis from grinding countertops, nearly a fifth had died. Their median age at death was 46. More than half had suffered delays in getting diagnosed, as the disease was mistaken for bacterial pneumonia or tuberculosis, and over a third already had severe scarring in their lungs when they were diagnosed.</p><p>Los Angeles County has been an epicenter of the debilitating disease, with 60 out of the 83 cases among countertop workers identified across the state since 2019 by the California Department of Public Health.</p><p>The San Fernando Valley is a hub for the stone "fabrication" industry — those who cut and polish the slabs made by manufacturers — and county officials also said that growing awareness spurred by Fazio and others may have resulted in better reporting of such cases in L.A. In July, the state sent out an advisory to healthcare providers about the threat, recommending that physicians ask if ailing patients have worked as countertop cutters and urging them to report any identified cases of silicosis to the state.</p><p>California workplace safety regulators are now drafting emergency rules to try to protect workers as engineered stone has come to dominate the countertop industry. The material is also sometimes called artificial or synthetic stone, made with crushed quartz bound together with resin. L.A. County is exploring whether to go further and ban the sale and installation of "silica engineered stone" entirely.</p><p>Existing safety standards must be followed, but "we feel that there need to be additional changes to the standards to make it even more safe in the workplace," said Dr. Nichole Quick, deputy director of health protection with the L.A. County public health department.</p><p>The county department is now preparing a report requested by county supervisors on options for a potential ban, as well as other possible steps. It has also partnered with Pacoima Beautiful to provide outreach. "This is a preventable disease," Quick said, "and we want to take appropriate action to make these workplaces safer."</p><p>One question before the county — and government regulators across the globe — is whether any safeguards will effectively protect workers grinding materials so high in silica. The Agglomerated Stone Manufacturers Assn., an international group representing manufacturers of engineered stone, <a href="https://www.astaworldwide.com/general-statement-engineered-stone-manufacturers-association-a-st-a-world-wide/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:maintains;elm:context_link;itc:0">maintains</a> its products can be cut "with no safety issues or health hazards if it is performed according to the best practices."</p><p>In a statement, the association said the risk lies not with engineered stone itself, but poor adherence to safety measures by fabricators, arguing that safety regulations need to be "simplified and rigorously enforced." Members of the Stone Coalition, which represents fabricators as well as manufacturers, said an L.A. County ban would have "severe economic consequences" and argued for additional enforcement and training on workplace safety, especially efforts to eliminate "dry cutting."</p><p>And the Los Angeles County Business Federation contended that enforcing safety regulations "will do more to prevent disease, while not adversely [affecting] the cost of construction at a time when Los Angeles is seeing a devastating housing crisis."</p><p>But Raphael Metzger, a Long Beach attorney who represents Segura Meza and other workers suing manufacturers of engineered stone such as Cambria and Caesarstone for damages, argued that typical respirators and other standard measures don't go far enough. Even with many "wet methods," workers can be exposed to dangerous levels of silica and need additional protection, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/surveyreports/pdfs/2021-DFSE-710.pdf?id=10.26616/NIOSHEPHB2021DFSE710" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:NIOSH research;elm:context_link;itc:0">NIOSH research</a> has found.</p><p><b>Read more:</b> <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-09-14/tens-of-thousands-of-kaiser-healthcare-workers-approve-possible-strike?utm_source=yahoo&amp;utm_medium=promo_module&amp;utm_campaign=rss_feed" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Tens of thousands of Kaiser healthcare workers approve possible strike;elm:context_link;itc:0">Tens of thousands of Kaiser healthcare workers approve possible strike</a></p><p>Nearly half of the workers suffering silicosis in the UCLA and UCSF study said their workplaces were using water to control dust. Roughly a quarter said they always had respiratory protection. Fazio said studies have found that in many shops, dust is so thick in the air that respirators cannot filter out a sufficient amount.</p><p>Metzger argued that the kind of sophisticated and costly measures that would be needed to reliably protect workers cutting engineered stone are not economically plausible in an industry where immigrant workers typically labor in small shops and are often paid in cash. Engineered stone "is too dangerous to be used safely," he said. "If there’s any industrial product that should be banned, this is the product."</p><p>Segura Meza agreed, calling it "very deadly." Vasquez, with Pacoima Beautiful, said that when she and Cabrera started talking to workers about engineered stone and silicosis, many of them asked, "How come they don't do anything with the stores that sell the products?"</p><p>In Australia, where the government is <a href="https://www.safeworkaustralia.gov.au/media-centre/news/closing-soon-consultation-prohibition-use-engineered-stone" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:weighing whether to ban;elm:context_link;itc:0">weighing whether to ban</a> engineered stone, a professional group whose members assess worker health hazards concluded that the high concentration of silica in engineered stone makes it difficult for measures such as wet cutting and ventilation to adequately protect workers.</p><p>Additional measures for respiratory protection are needed, but such systems "have largely been absent from this sector," the Australian Institute of Occupational Hygienists wrote. In light of those concerns, it <a href="https://www.aioh.org.au/product/consultation-on-the-prohibition-on-the-use-of-engineered-stone/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:recommended;elm:context_link;itc:0">recommended</a> prohibiting engineered stone containing more than 10% crystalline silica, but said it would also support banning all engineered stone because of the rigorous compliance needed even at a 10% level.</p><p>In California, existing rules to protect workers have often not been followed, state regulators found. Cal/OSHA, which is now hustling to draft emergency standards to protect California workers in the stone cutting and polishing industry, found rampant violations of the current standards when it looked closer in 2019 and 2020.</p><p>Despite the rise of the deadly disease, homeowners and other consumers shopping for countertops know little about the threat it could pose to the workers behind the surfaces in their kitchens and bathrooms, Fazio said. Engineered stone is now estimated to represent more than 60% of materials used for countertops, the L.A. County business federation said, and market researchers say its popularity is <a href="https://www.freedoniagroup.com/industry-study/engineered-stone-countertops-4395.htm" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:only expected to rise;elm:context_link;itc:0">only expected to rise</a>.</p><p>Engineered stone “is everywhere and people have no idea," Fazio said. Consumers "have a right to know that the countertop that might be the cheapest one ... may really be costing folks' lives."</p><p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/newsletters/essential-california?utm_source=yahoo&amp;utm_medium=newsletter_module&amp;utm_campaign=essential-california" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Sign up for Essential California for news, features and recommendations from the L.A.

 <li><p><strong>The sample capsule has arrived at the highly-secured clean room facility in Utah following its landing earlier this morning in the desert.</strong> This significant moment marks the successful delivery from the Utah desert into the clean room, and of course the 1.2 billion-mile journey from the asteroid Bennu back to Earth.</p></li>
 <li><p><strong>Mission members also obtained samples from the surrounding area of the landing zone. </strong>Nasa TV showed scientists taking photos around the landing zone as well as measuring air and gas levels.</p></li>
 <li><p><strong>Sir Brian May, of Queen, has told <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/nasa" data-link-name="in body link">Nasa</a> TV he is “immensely proud” to be a team member of Osiris-Rex. </strong>May was among those who helped to identify the location on Bennu where the samples would be collected.</p></li>
 <li><p><strong>Nasa administrator Bill Nelson hailed the Osiris-Rex mission’s success following its capsule’s landing in the Utah desert today. “</strong>This mission proves that NASA does big things, things that have inspired us, things that unite us,” he said.</p></li>
 <li><p><strong>By studying the samples from Bennu, scientists can compare their results against the data they obtained from instruments on board the spacecraft. </strong>This ‘ground-truthing’ means they can then calibrate the latter, allowing them to more accurately explore differences in composition across the surface of Bennu.</p></li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p><span>Systems Approach</span> With the annual SIGCOMM conference taking place this month, we observed that congestion control still gets an hour in the program, 35 years after the first paper on TCP congestion control was published. So it seems like a good time to appreciate just how much the success of the internet has depended on its approach to managing congestion.</p>
<p>Following my recent <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://peertube.roundpond.net/w/1hSTyT2J4cKrLaoU3sJeqT">talk</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/06/28/60_years_of_networking/">article</a> on 60 years of networking, which focused almost entirely on the internet and ARPANET, I received quite a few comments about various networking technologies that were competing for ascendancy at the same time.</p>
<p>These included the OSI stack (anyone remember CLNP and TP4?), the Coloured Book protocols (including the Cambridge Ring), and of course ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) which was actually the first networking protocol on which I worked in depth. It’s hard to fathom now, but in the 1980s I was one of many people who thought that ATM might be the packet switching technology to take over the world.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>I rate congestion control as one of the key factors that enabled the internet to progress from moderate to global scale</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ATM proponents used to refer to existing technologies such as Ethernet and TCP/IP as “legacy” protocols that could, if necessary, be carried over the global ATM network once it was established. One of my fond memories from those days is of Steve Deering (a pioneer of IP networking) boldly (and correctly) stating that ATM would never be successful enough to even be a legacy protocol.</p>
<p>One reason I skipped over these other protocols when earlier retelling the history of networking was simply to save space – it’s a little-known fact that my Systems Approach colleague Larry Peterson and I aim for brevity, especially since receiving a <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1IVEX207N7WY8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B004VF6216">one-star review</a> on Amazon that called our book “a wall of text.” But I was also focused on how we got to the internet of today, where TCP/IP has effectively out-competed other protocol suites to achieve global (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/12/28/cloud_native_principles_wireless_networks/">or near-global</a>) penetration.</p>

    

<p>There are many theories about why TCP/IP was more successful than its contemporaries, and they are not readily testable. Most likely, there were many factors that played into the success of the internet protocols. But I rate congestion control as one of the key factors that enabled the internet to progress from moderate to global scale.</p>

        


        

<p>It is also an interesting study in how the particular architectural choices made in the 1970s proved themselves over the subsequent decades.</p>
<h3>Distributed resource management</h3>
<p>In David Clark’s paper [<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://ccr.sigcomm.org/archive/1995/jan95/ccr-9501-clark.pdf">PDF</a>] “The Design Philosophy of the DARPA Internet Protocols," a stated design goal is: “The internet architecture must permit distributed management of its resources.” There are many different implications of that goal, but the way that Jacobson and Karels [<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://ee.lbl.gov/papers/congavoid.pdf">PDF</a>] first implemented congestion control in TCP is a good example of taking that principle to heart.</p>
<p>Their approach also embraces another design goal of the internet: accommodate many different types of networks. Taken together, these principles pretty much rule out the possibility of any sort of network-based admission control, a sharp contrast to networks such as ATM, which assumed that a request for resources would be made from an end-system to the network before data could flow.</p>
<p>Part of the “accommodate many types of networks” philosophy is that you can’t assume that all networks have admission control. Couple that with distributed management of resources and you end up with congestion control being something that end-systems have to handle, which is exactly what Jacobson and Karels did with their initial changes to TCP.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>We’re trying to get millions of end-systems to cooperatively share the bandwidth of bottleneck links in some fair way</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The history of TCP congestion control is long enough to fill a book (<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://tcpcc.systemsapproach.org/">and we did</a>) but the work done at Berkeley from 1996 to 1998 casts a long shadow, with Jacobson’s <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/52324.52356">1988 SIGCOMM paper</a> ranking among the most cited networking papers of all time.</p>
<p>Slow-start, AIMD (additive increase, multiplicative decrease), RTT estimation, and the use of packet loss as a congestion signal were all in that paper, laying the groundwork for the following decades of congestion control research. One reason for that paper's influence, I believe, is that the foundation it laid was solid, while it left plenty of room for future improvements–as we see in the continued efforts to improve congestion control today.</p>

        

<p>And the problem is fundamentally hard: we’re trying to get millions of end-systems that have no direct contact with each other to cooperatively share the bandwidth of bottleneck links in some moderately fair way using only the information that can be gleaned by sending packets into the network and observing when and whether they reach their destination.</p>

<p>Arguably one of the biggest leaps forward after 1988 was the realization by Brakmo and Peterson (yes, that guy) that packet loss wasn't the only signal of congestion: so too was increasing delay. This was the basis for the 1994 <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/190809.190317">TCP Vegas paper</a>, and the idea of using delay rather than loss alone was quite controversial at the time.</p>
<p>However, Vegas kicked off a new trend in congestion control research, inspiring many other efforts to take delay into account as an early indicator of congestion before loss occurs. Data center TCP (<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1851275.1851192">DCTCP</a>) and Google’s <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/google/bbr">BBR</a> are two examples.</p>
<p>One reason that I give credit to congestion control algorithms in explaining the success of the internet is that the path to failure of the internet was clearly on display in 1986. Jacobson describes some of the early congestion collapse episodes, which saw throughput fall by three orders of magnitude.</p>
<p>When I joined Cisco in 1995 we were still hearing customer stories about catastrophic congestion episodes. The same year Bob Metcalfe, inventor of Ethernet and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/03/23/turing_award_goes_to_robert/">recent Turing Award winner</a>, famously predicted that the internet would collapse as consumer internet access and the rise of the web drove rapid growth in traffic. It didn’t.</p>

        

<p>Congestion control has continued to evolve, with the QUIC protocol, for example, offering both better mechanisms for detecting congestion and the option of experimenting with multiple congestion control algorithms. And some congestion control has moved into the application layer, eg: Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.theregister.com/2012/09/09/mpeg_dash_web_vid_spec/">DASH</a>).</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/08/16/datacenter_east_west_security/">Why securing East-West network traffic is so important – and how it can be done</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/04/25/building_private_5g/">Building your own private 5G is as easy as Wi-Fi</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/10/07/quic_tcp_replacement/">If you need a TCP replacement, you won't find a QUIC one</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/08/26/network_edge/">The internet's edge routers are all so different. What if we unified them with software?</a></li>
</ul>
<p>An interesting side effect of the congestion episodes of the 1980s and 1990s was that we observed that small buffers were sometimes the cause of congestion collapse. An <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/205511.205520">influential paper</a> by Villamizar and Song showed that TCP performance dropped when the amount of buffering was less than the average delay × bandwidth product of the flows.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the result only held for very small numbers of flows (as was acknowledged in the paper) but it was widely interpreted as an inviolable rule that influenced the next several years of router design.</p>
<p>This was finally debunked by the buffer sizing work of <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1015467.1015499">Appenzeller <em>et al</em></a> in 2004, but not before the unfortunate phenomenon of <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.bufferbloat.net/projects/">Bufferbloat</a> – truly excessive buffer sizes leading to massive queuing delays – had made it into millions of low-end routers. The <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.waveform.com/tools/bufferbloat">self-test</a> for Bufferbloat in your home network is worth a look.</p>
<p>So, while we don’t get to go back and run controlled experiments to see exactly how the internet came to succeed while other protocol suites fell by the wayside, we can at least see that the internet avoided potential failure because of the timely way congestion control was added.</p>
<p>It was relatively easy in 1986 to experiment with new ideas by tweaking the code in a couple of end-systems, and then push the effective solution out to a wide set of systems. Nothing inside the network had to change. It almost certainly helped that the set of operating systems that needed to be changed and the community of people who could make those changes was small enough to see widespread deployment of the initial BSD-based algorithms of Jacobson and Karels.</p>
<p>It seems clear that there is no such thing as the perfect congestion control approach, which is why we continue to see new papers on the topic 35 years after Jacobson’s. But the internet's architecture has fostered the environment in which effective solutions can be tested and deployed to achieve distributed management of shared resources.</p>
<p>In my view that’s a great testament to the quality of that architecture. ®</p>

<h4 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-what" dir="auto"><a href="#what">What?</a></h4>
<p dir="auto">Have you ever wanted to use your Kindle Paperwhite to write, even more, with a vim-like editor? This is what PiWrite is for.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-how" dir="auto"><a href="#how">How?</a></h4>
<p dir="auto">The TL;DR is <em>a webserver running somewhere a keyboard can be plugged, and a page opened in the Kindle's web browser</em>.</p>
<p dir="auto">The not-so-short version requires more effort and details, but is the UX I wanted to get:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>A <strong>Raspberry Pi Zero W</strong>…</li>
<li>Paired with a <strong>Bluetooth keyboard</strong>…</li>
<li>Set up in <strong>access point mode</strong>…</li>
<li>With <strong>this package</strong> installed…</li>
<li>And configured to <strong>start automatically</strong> on boot.</li>
</ul>
<h4 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-why" dir="auto"><a href="#why">Why?</a></h4>
<p dir="auto">I was inspired by <a href="https://solarwriter.msol.io/" rel="nofollow">SolarWriter by Michael Solomon</a>. I had always wanted to use my Kindle for writing. SolarWriter solves that by setting up a local web server on your phone (iOS or Android), then you type with a Bluetooth keyboard paired with it. But you need to set up hotspot, keep your screen on… I didn't like those parts. So I wrote this.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-contributions" dir="auto"><a href="#contributions">Contributions?</a></h4>
<p dir="auto">This is open source, and I'll be happy to see it extended and improved. But I'm unlikely to accept contributions: I want a reduced feature set, with only what <em>I</em> need. This is why I didn't release this to PyPI, so anybody can have its own version with custom tweaks and installs it easily from their own repository.</p>

<hr>
<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-installing-the-package" dir="auto"><a href="#installing-the-package">Installing the package</a></h2>
<p dir="auto">With a current enough version of <code>pip</code> you can install directly from the repository (or from your fork) with</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="pip install piwrite@git+https://github.com/rberenguel/PiWrite"><pre>pip install piwrite@git+https://github.com/rberenguel/PiWrite</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Or with pipx (<strong>recommended</strong>) with</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="pipx install piwrite@git+https://github.com/rberenguel/PiWrite"><pre>pipx install piwrite@git+https://github.com/rberenguel/PiWrite</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">You might need to add <code>/home/YOU/.local/bin</code> to your <code>PATH</code> (like adding <code>export PATH="/home/YOU/.local/bin:$PATH"</code> at the end of your <code>.bashrc</code>, <code>.zshenv</code> or similar).</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-trying-it-before-installing" dir="auto"><a href="#trying-it-before-installing">Trying it before installing</a></h2>
<p dir="auto">Once you have installed it you can try it locally (by default it will serve back at <code>127.0.0.1:80</code>), and optionally configure host and port, like:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="PIWRITE_HOST=pi
PIWRITE_PORT=31415"><pre>PIWRITE_HOST=pi
PIWRITE_PORT=31415</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Point your web browser to this address and try! The editor is vim inspired, and the instructions can be found in <a href="https://github.com/rberenguel/PiWrite/blob/main/piwrite/help">help</a></p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-setting-up-your-raspberry-pi-zero" dir="auto"><a href="#setting-up-your-raspberry-pi-zero">Setting up your Raspberry Pi Zero</a></h2>
<p dir="auto">If you need a Pi, I can't recommend <a href="https://shop.pimoroni.com/" rel="nofollow">Pimoroni</a> enough. I'm not affiliated, I just buy always from them.</p>
<p dir="auto">The instructions below may be missing some piece, I have written it based on my bash history and what I remember having to tweak. With the information of <em>what</em> you need to do, there are plenty of tutorials on how to approach each step though.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-basics" dir="auto"><a href="#basics">Basics</a></h2>
<p dir="auto">Best is installing a lightweight Raspbian version, since the Zero is not a terribly fast machine. By "mistake" (I was trying something) I updated the lite version (on Buster, I think) to Bookworm. Don't do that, not needed.</p>
<p dir="auto">To configure everything you will need to set up the Raspberry for <code>ssh</code> access, and better with password. For using it as a "magical thing that lets the Kindle work as a text editor" is better if you disable requiring password for logging in via <code>tty</code>. You can enable this (known as autologin) by running <code>sudo raspi-config</code>, in the <em>System Options</em> section. You specifically want <em>Console autologin</em>.</p>
<p dir="auto">You also better set up wifi connectivity too. You can set this up by adding a wpa_supplicant.conf file to the boot partition of the SD card with contents like the following:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="network={
    ssid=&quot;YOUR_NETWORK_NAME&quot;
    psk=&quot;YOUR_PASSWORD&quot;
    key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
}"><pre><code>network={
    ssid="YOUR_NETWORK_NAME"
    psk="YOUR_PASSWORD"
    key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
}
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Steps needed after this:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Pair with a Bluetooth keyboard;</li>
<li>Set up a wireless access point on your Raspberry;</li>
<li>Install the package and set it up;</li>
<li>Nice-to-have: ssh via USB (there are many tutorials for this).</li>
</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-pairing-with-a-bluetooth-keyboard" dir="auto"><a href="#pairing-with-a-bluetooth-keyboard">Pairing with a Bluetooth keyboard</a></h2>
<p dir="auto">Pick your poison. The standard way is using <code>bluetoothctl</code>. I found that installing <a href="https://darkhz.github.io/bluetuith/Installation.html" rel="nofollow">Bluetuith</a> was more convenient to be sure the pairing had worked. On the con side, you need to install the whole Go runtime.</p>
<p dir="auto">Remember: the keyboard will be usable in the <code>tty</code> session, not in any ssh-initiated session.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you want any fancy keyboard configuration (I use Colemak, and like my caps to be control) you will have to edit <code>/etc/default/keyboard</code> and add something like the following:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="XKBMODEL=&quot;pc105&quot;
XKBLAYOUT=&quot;us&quot;
XKBVARIANT=&quot;colemak&quot;
XKBOPTIONS=&quot;ctrl:nocaps&quot;"><pre><code>XKBMODEL="pc105"
XKBLAYOUT="us"
XKBVARIANT="colemak"
XKBOPTIONS="ctrl:nocaps"
</code></pre></div>
<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-wireless-access-point" dir="auto"><a href="#wireless-access-point">Wireless access point</a></h2>
<p dir="auto">I followed the instructions from here: <a href="https://www.stevemurch.com/setting-up-a-raspberry-pi-for-ad-hoc-networking-tech-note/2022/12" rel="nofollow">Turn a Raspberry Pi into a Web Server with Its Own Wifi Network (Tech Note)</a>. From these instructions, you can (optionally) skip the routing stuff for this. Although the post mentions <em>only</em> working in Buster, I followed the exact same steps and worked just fine in Bookworm.</p>
<p dir="auto">The TL;DR version:</p>
<p dir="auto">Get the access point and DNS services</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="sudo apt install hostapd dnsmasq"><pre><code>sudo apt install hostapd dnsmasq
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Turn it on</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="sudo systemctl unmask hostapd
sudo systemctl enable hostapd"><pre><code>sudo systemctl unmask hostapd
sudo systemctl enable hostapd
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Edit <code>/etc/dhcpcd.conf</code> (sudo) and add at the end</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="interface wlan0
    static ip_address=192.168.11.1/24
    nohook wpa_supplicant"><pre><code>interface wlan0
    static ip_address=192.168.11.1/24
    nohook wpa_supplicant
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto"><span>Important</span><br>
When you want to re-connect your Zero to your wifi, you need to comment this out, otherwise you are out of AP access and out of SSH via Wifi (or even USB gadget) access. If you forget, you'll need to edit the raw disk from another Linux device.</p>
<p dir="auto">You now need to configure <code>/etc/dnsmasq.conf</code> with</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="interface=wlan0 # Listening interface
dhcp-range=192.168.11.2,192.168.11.20,255.255.255.0,24h
                # Pool of IP addresses served via DHCP
domain=write     # Local wireless DNS domain

                # Alias for this router"><pre><code>interface=wlan0 # Listening interface

<p dir="auto">The Kindle browser is weird and does not support everything. No websockets, only longpolling (or so it seems). For some reason, only version 3.0 of the socketio JavaScript libraries worked correctly. I found no way to get the Kindle browser to rotate the whole page via CSS so I could have a landscape view.</p>
<p dir="auto">My first trial implementation tried using pynvim (the NeoVim API layer) as the underlying editor. That would have been awesome, real vim! But it didn't work for obscure reasons (I had to do some unholy things with asyncio that caused it to explode easily).</p>

Within a few weeks of the dense fog's arrival, many of the laborers grow tired and develop headaches and fevers. Each time, those who have evaded illness wonder whether they will be next. Experienced farmworkers expect this affliction, but when Rosalinda Guillen arrived from Washington State 25 years ago, she had never seen anything like it. She watched, helpless, as other farmworkers coughed and tried to catch their breath.</p>

<p>That was the first time Guillen, a seasonal farmworker and agricultural justice leader, heard the term “Valley fever.” The disease is caused by two species of shapeshifting fungus in the genus <em>Coccidioides</em>, both of which flourish when exposed to moist springs and arid summers—like those in the San Joaquin Valley, where the fever got its name. Guillen had not encountered such a thing in her home state. But because of drier landscapes and warming temperatures, the fungus's range appears to be spreading.</p>

<p>No one knows for sure whether wind is moving <em>Coccidioides</em> north or whether it has been there undisturbed until now. But even as researchers have been discovering it in new pockets throughout the western U.S., many state health departments have failed to track it. What limited data exist indicate that 40 percent of cases become symptomatic, and among those the people most at risk of life-threatening disease are Latino, Asian and Native American people, who contract Valley fever at two to four times the rate of white people. That increased risk seems to be primarily attributable to their frequent exposure and long hours spent in dusty outdoor locations, although genetic variations haven't yet been ruled out.</p>

<p>Many of those affected lack basic health care, and some are afraid to seek medical help for fear of employer retaliation or even deportation. As a result, Valley fever is undersurveilled and underdiagnosed, and its study and treatment are underfunded. Research on the condition has remained limited, but it's clear that the disease disproportionately strikes people in the most vulnerable populations.</p>

<p>After decades of neglect, however, there's a new push at both the local and federal levels to find out more about the extent of Valley fever's threat. In addition, a small group of researchers is working to understand how to treat and even prevent it. That knowledge can't come soon enough, Guillen says: “All we really know is that farmworkers may already be sick.”</p>

<h2>Growing Evidence</h2>

<p>Valley fever thrives both in dirt and in human lungs. After a heavy rain, the fast-growing <em>Coccidioides</em> spreads through the wet soil like mold through bread. When it dries out, its spores mingle with dusty topsoil and can be inhaled as airborne pathogens. Once they're in the lungs, those spores take on a wholly different form, each morphing into a reproductive cell in which new spores multiply. The full cells burst within five days, releasing spores that travel throughout the body. The fungus can cause coughing, fevers, body aches, fatigue, rashes and appetite loss. In up to 10 percent of those infected, some symptoms can last for years. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report that about 200 people die from the disease every year.</p>

<p>Bridget Barker, a mycologist and geneticist at Northern Arizona University, has spent her decades-long career figuring out how to detect <em>Coccidioides</em> and understand its role in the larger ecosystem. She and her team designed a probe to extract it from the soil so they can analyze it. Their research has revealed the fungus's resilience: <em>Coccidioides</em> needs moisture to grow, flourishing when the rains arrive, then stagnating when the ground dries up again. Its spores remain in the topsoil, where they can survive for years.</p>

<p>Barker and others refer to this process as the “grow-and-blow” cycle: once the fungus stops growing and becomes dehydrated, wind picks up the spores and carries them to new areas. This may be one way <em>Coccidioides</em> has expanded into the Pacific Northwest from the southwestern states, such as California, Arizona and New Mexico, where it is endemic. Researchers at the University of California, Irvine, predict that if warming trends continue and droughts persist, Valley fever could eventually stretch as far north as the U.S.-Canada border and as far northeast as North Dakota.</p>

<p>Amanda Gomez-Weaver, a doctoral student in environmental health sciences at the University of California, Berkeley, has been investigating the correlation between climate-influenced dust exposure and Valley fever epidemiology. Previous research had indicated that spores can become airborne anytime dirt is disrupted, making people working in construction and agriculture particularly susceptible. Gomez-Weaver has also found a strong association between Valley fever incidence and ambient dust, indicating that spores become suspended in the air and linger there much like other atmospheric particulates. This work has convinced her that anyone who spends most of their day in dusty outdoor areas in the western U.S. would need a <em>Coccidioides</em> vaccine to remain uninfected. To date, however, no vaccine is available for any fungal disease. A vaccine, Gomez-Weaver says, “would be the most powerful tool in our arsenal.”</p>

<h2>The Data GAP</h2>

<p>Valley fever's mortality rate is about one death per 1,000 infections, according to infectious disease physician John Galgiani, director of the University of Arizona's Valley Fever Center for Excellence. It doesn't need to be so high. There are medications to treat it, but patients often receive incorrect diagnoses.</p>

<p>Physicians and other health-care practitioners who work where Valley fever is prevalent often don't know to test for it, because there's a general lack of awareness about the disease and because its symptoms can be mistaken for other respiratory illnesses, such as pneumonia. Patients usually end up with antibiotics or other medications that kill bacteria but not fungi.</p>

<p>The CDC estimates that only one in 33 cases is reported and has suggested that hundreds of thousands of infections have probably been missed over the past 10 years. Because the organization does not mandate that public health departments report Valley fever—only 26 states have submitted case numbers—it has no data at all from some states where the fungus is endemic, such as Texas and Idaho.</p>

<p>Farmworkers and laborers who toil in the dusty outdoors, most often people of color, have been trying to get the attention of state and federal agencies for decades. “If something is harming us,” Guillen says, “it's hard to prove based on the way that data-collecting systems are structured.”</p>

<h2>Proof of Concept</h2>

<p>To show that a vaccine could be effective protection against <em>Coccidioides</em>, Galgiani and his team started by focusing on an immunization for dogs with the infection. Dogs are vulnerable to the disease, too. Because they explore the environment through their noses and can inhale large quantities of fungal spores in a short time, they contract Valley fever more often than humans do, and their symptoms can be more severe.</p>

<p>The canine vaccine Galgiani helped to develop has already proved itself. It uses attenuated live spores of <em>Coccidioides</em> that can't reproduce but still prompt an immune reaction in the body. The response they elicit is so robust that a veterinary pharmaceutical company has licensed the rights to the vaccine and is seeking approval from the Department of Agriculture for its use in pets. Galgiani has now moved on to humans.</p>

<p>One potential benefit of a Valley fever vaccine is that it could be a one-and-done kind of thing—unlike those for influenza or even tetanus, which must be updated regularly. According to studies by microbiologist Deborah Fuller of the University of Washington School of Medicine, people who get Valley fever develop lifelong immunity. That, Fuller says, “is the golden egg.”</p>

<p>Fuller's team is pursuing both DNA- and RNA-based vaccines, each of which would prompt the body to produce proteins that trigger an immune response. Fuller notes that any vaccine against <em>Coccidioides</em> would serve a greater purpose than just fighting Valley fever: it could allow researchers to understand immune response to other fungal diseases and provide insight into how to better treat such conditions.</p>

<p>Galgiani believes that if funding allows, a human version of his vaccine could be ready for approval within eight years. That funding may finally be within reach. After Valley fever's annual incidence surpassed 20,000 cases in 2019, two congressional representatives—Kevin McCarthy of California and David Schweikert of Arizona—called on the National Institutes of Health to make a substantial investment in Valley fever research. Last year the NIH complied, dedicating $4.5 million in funding to the cause.</p>

<p>It's about time, Guillen says. She has seen how agricultural workers are made vulnerable just by the dint of their surroundings, toiling in jobs that expose them to agrochemicals, dehydration, extreme heat, and more. Growing up in Washington State, working in the fields herself starting at age 16, she never had to worry about Valley fever. But now she's watching it creep in and threaten the people she's tried so hard to protect. She's fighting to make sure some of the most invisible workers are seen.</p>

and many people stepped up to tell me that learning styles are a myth.  I
know the research about learning styles, but people are over-applying it to
dictate how people should learn.</p><p>If you haven’t heard about the theory and its debunking, you can read about
it in <a rel="external noopener" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/04/the-myth-of-learning-styles/557687/">The Atlantic</a> or <a rel="external noopener" href="https://www.educationnext.org/stubborn-myth-learning-styles-state-teacher-license-prep-materials-debunked-theory/">Education
Next</a>.  Briefly: the theory was that some people were inherently visual
learners, while others were textual learners, among other kinds.  This has been
proven untrue.</p><p>When I said “learn how you learn,” I meant for learners to take an active
role in choosing what their path should be.  I’m not talking about the four
modalities from the debunked “learning styles” myth.  There are many effective
ways to learn how to program, and you have to choose your way.  There are lots
of possible choices:</p><ul><li>Do you want to start with computer science theory, or jump into writing
small programs?</li><li>Do you want to know the inner workings of things, or just how to use
them?</li><li>Do you want to work on small exercises, or choose a project of your
own?</li><li>Once you’ve started a project, do you complete it, or are you willing to
leave things unfinished because something else has drawn your attention?</li><li>Do you work a fixed amount of time each day, or do you adapt as your energy
waxes and wanes?</li><li>Do you want to dive deep into one technology or language, or dabble in
many?</li><li>Are you proactive (learn what you might need it later) or reactive (learn
what you need right now)?</li><li>Does studying with others help you, or are you better off learning
alone?</li><li>Are you choosing an industry, and aiming your work directly at it, or trying
out many different domains?</li><li>Do you like videos, or reading text?</li></ul><p>These aren’t always binary choices: you might be somewhere in the middle, or
shift over time, or seesaw back and forth.  Understand what works for you.</p><p>I saved videos vs text for last because it seems to be the most
contentious.  Many people will tell you that watching videos is a bad way to
learn programming.  I agree that <em>passively</em> watching videos can lull you
into thinking you understand concepts.  You must write code to truly cement your
understanding.  Videos can be a fine way to learn, as long as you are active in
the learning.  But some people will simply rail against videos entirely.</p><p>Some experts lean too hard on “learning styles are a myth” and “videos are
bad.” This seems to be just another gate-keeping flavor of “the way I did it is
the right way.”</p><p>The debunking of learning styles was important because teachers were being
expected to develop curriculum in many styles to suit different students’ needs.
This was extra work, and could also prevent the students from developing
learning skills in other modalities.</p><p>But I’m not talking about teachers’ choice of modality. I’m talking about
learners finding paths that work for them.  Today we have an abundance of
learning materials, and learners have to choose among them.  Everyone has be
empowered to use the ones that suit them.  This is a much bigger range than
visual/textual/auditory.</p><p>Learners have to learn how they learn, and choose the path and materials that
work best for them.</p></article></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p><br><span><span>O</span></span>n a frigid evening in January 2018, Brian Wharton was sitting at home in Hawkins, a small town in the backcountry of east <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/texas" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Texas</a>, when there was a knock on the door. A woman introduced herself as a lawyer working to spare the life of Robert Roberson, a death row inmate who had come within four days of execution.</p><p>Wharton immediately understood the significance of this visit. He was a retired detective from the police department in Palestine, another small town about 80 miles away, and in 2002 he had been involved in a case that stuck in his memory.</p><p>On 31 January that year, Wharton was called to Palestine hospital after receiving reports of a mortally ill child. Her father, Roberson, had brought his two-year-old daughter Nikki into the ER in a comatose state, the little girl lying limp in his arms and turning blue.

Why had the doctors and nurses seized on shaken baby syndrome as the cause of Nikki’s injuries almost immediately, and why with such certainty? Why had a nurse told him she had found indicators of sexual assault on Nikki’s body when he could see no such evidence?</p><p>Why, when he escorted Roberson back to his house on the day of Nikki’s collapse, could he find no signs of a violent altercation? Why were there no marks or indentations on the walls, no holes in the sheetrock, nothing – and no blood anywhere except a few drops on a washcloth Roberson gave him?</p><p>Above all, why had Roberson himself acted so strangely? As a police officer, Wharton had dealt with both perpetrators and victims of violent crimes, but Roberson’s behavior fitted the pattern of neither criminal nor victim. He came across as flat, emotionless, matter-of-fact, as though nothing was registering with him.</p><p>All these things bugged the former detective to the point that he felt haunted by them. So when the doorbell rang, and Roberson’s lawyer stood before him, Wharton knew exactly what to do.</p><p>“Come in,” he said. “I’ve been waiting for you.”</p><hr><p><span><span>O</span></span>n Tuesday, the US supreme court will convene in Washington for what is known as a “long conference”, preceding the start of its <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/" data-link-name="in body link">2023-24 term</a>. The justices will meet in private to sift through the backlog of cases that have amassed over the summer, tossing out those they are disinclined to consider.</p><p>The lawyer Gretchen Sween will be waiting on tenterhooks for news of which petitions the court has discarded.

Should the justices reject his approaches, the state of Texas would be free to set a new execution date.</p><p>Roberson has asked the court to review the decision of the Texas state courts to <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2023/01/11/robert-roberson-texas-death-penalty-shaken-baby/" data-link-name="in body link">deny</a> a retrial despite new evidence that has emerged casting doubt on his conviction. Since Sween took over as his attorney in 2016 she has discovered that:</p><ul>
 <li><p>Nikki, who shortly before she died had been placed in Roberson’s custody, was chronically sick almost from birth. She suffered bouts of breathing apnea which caused her suddenly to stop breathing and collapse. Shortly before her father rushed her to hospital, she had had diarrhea for five days and had a fever of 104.5F (40.3C).</p></li>
 <li><p>Nikki also had severe undiagnosed pneumonia.</p></li>
 <li><p>She had been prescribed medications, including an opioid, that are no longer considered safe for children as they can cause fatal breathing problems and oxygen deprivation.</p></li>
 <li><p>The sexual assault allegation was unsupported by any evidence, and the nurse who raised it was unqualified to identify it.</p></li>
</ul><p>Then there is the overarching question of shaken baby syndrome. The petition asks the supreme court to weigh whether a death sentence based largely on a scientific hunch presented to the jury as fact should be allowed to stand when, in the intervening years, that theory has been largely discredited.</p><p>In other words: should Texas be allowed to execute a man on the basis of junk science?</p><p>“This is a shocking, social failure,” Sween said. “This is not simply a matter of having the wrong guy, it’s a matter of there having been no crime committed in the first place.”</p><hr><p>Texas houses its <a href="https://www.tdcj.texas.gov/death_row/dr_offenders_on_dr.html" data-link-name="in body link">179 male death row inmates</a> in the Allen B Polunsky Unit, a complex of windowless grey boxes resembling a Walmart supercenter shrouded in barbed wire.</p><p>Roberson, 56, was waiting in the secure metal cubicle assigned for media visits.

From the first exchange, his highly unusual way of speaking was evident.</p><p>“Thank you for for for for for, ah ah, this interview, sir sir,” he said, blinking fast behind his glasses, in time with his stutter.</p><p>That was a clue as to why medical staff were so quick to suspect Roberson when they encountered him, and why Wharton found his behaviour so singular.

During the trial, the prosecution said he came across as cold and uncaring because he didn’t cry, but he said that was because he had trained himself not to cry during his difficult childhood.</p><p>“It’s hard for me to cry because I got my behind whooped by my father who would say, ‘Shut up or dry it up or we’ll give you some more.’ My dad was kind of abusive, you know.”</p><p>Roberson was taken into custody within hours of Nikki’s death.

I wouldn’t want that to be on nobody: to lose a child, especially if you tried to do right and you loved her and tried to get to know her, then to be accused.”</p><p>Roberson said he knew nothing about the medical hypothesis that fueled his prosecution until long after he was arrested. He read about it in a brochure someone gave his mother.</p><p>“I’d never heard about shaken baby in my life,” he said.</p><hr><p><span><span>S</span></span>haken baby syndrome (SBS) began life in the early 1970s as a medical hypothesis for why some children become severely ill, some fatally, showing signs of internal head trauma but little or no signs of external trauma. One of the first to float the idea was a British pediatric neurosurgeon, Norman Guthkelch, who in 1971 suggested the cause might be violent shaking.</p><p>By the 1980s, SBS had developed into a detailed theory focusing on three symptoms, known as the triad, that it was believed could indicate abusive shaking: bleeding between the tissue layers covering the brain, swelling on the brain, and bleeding at the back of the eyes. When that triad was seen, even without any outward sign of force, child abuse might be behind it.</p><p>By the 1990s, a form of groupthink had crept in, medical practitioners firming up what had begun as a mere hunch into a formal diagnosis. The collective thinking now was that where those three symptoms were seen in young children, not only could abusive shaking be presumed, it had to be taken as the cause.</p><p>In 2001, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the world’s leading pediatric medical organization, issued official guidance. It said that where a young child had internal head injuries there was “the need for a presumption of child abuse” – a categoric finding that rapidly became medical, and then forensic dogma.</p><p>So it was that a year later, when Roberson brought Nikki to ER, he was met by a cordon of medical staff trained in this thinking, with detectives and prosecutors following their lead.</p><p>“When we got to Palestine hospital, the conversation was about shaken baby,” Wharton recalled, “so for me and my detectives that’s the direction we were going.”</p><p>The problem was that the presumption that the triad must be caused by violent shaking had no scientific foundations. As a new book of essays, <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/shaken-baby-syndrome/67016F1A1F6ED92141A179E9A5D145FB" data-link-name="in body link">Shaken Baby Syndrome</a>, published by Cambridge University Press and edited by prominent scientists and law professors in the US, UK, Europe and Japan, points out, shaking is essentially a biomechanical issue pediatric doctors know little about.</p><p>One of the first biomechanical studies to be carried out into SBS was conducted in 1987, almost 20 years after the hypothesis emerged. It found that violent shaking produces a force inside the head well below that involved in impact injuries such as car crashes, and much weaker than child abuse experts had assumed.</p><p>The new book’s conclusion is that 50 years after Guthkelch’s hunch, “this hypothesis still lacks a scientific evidence base”.</p><p>In 1997, shaken baby syndrome became a global sensation with the televised trial of a British nanny, Louise Woodward, in Massachusetts. She was prosecuted following the death of the eight-month-old in her care, Matthew Eappen.</p><p>Woodward was convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to life, later reduced to <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23979627-34-declaration-of-norman-guthkelch-expresses-some-horror-dated-feb-3-2012" data-link-name="in body link">involuntary manslaughter</a> and time served. Her trial was so high-profile that it brought to public attention serious doubts about the credibility of SBS raised by the nanny’s defense attorney, the co-founder of the Innocence Project, Barry Scheck.</p><p>Since Roberson was sentenced to death in 2002, those doubts have steadily grown. Dr Patrick Barnes, a key prosecution witness in the Woodward trial, retracted his testimony and became a vocal critic of the syndrome.</p><figure id="e16d1f00-fa90-4551-b3bc-0f55f86b09ed" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-4"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/718db076fe57df0a24482eeb6f1f80e3815c7473/0_0_2048_1532/master/2048.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/718db076fe57df0a24482eeb6f1f80e3815c7473/0_0_2048_1532/master/2048.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1300px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/718db076fe57df0a24482eeb6f1f80e3815c7473/0_0_2048_1532/master/2048.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1140px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1140px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/718db076fe57df0a24482eeb6f1f80e3815c7473/0_0_2048_1532/master/2048.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1140px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/718db076fe57df0a24482eeb6f1f80e3815c7473/0_0_2048_1532/master/2048.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/718db076fe57df0a24482eeb6f1f80e3815c7473/0_0_2048_1532/master/2048.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 980px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/718db076fe57df0a24482eeb6f1f80e3815c7473/0_0_2048_1532/master/2048.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/718db076fe57df0a24482eeb6f1f80e3815c7473/0_0_2048_1532/master/2048.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/718db076fe57df0a24482eeb6f1f80e3815c7473/0_0_2048_1532/master/2048.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/718db076fe57df0a24482eeb6f1f80e3815c7473/0_0_2048_1532/master/2048.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/718db076fe57df0a24482eeb6f1f80e3815c7473/0_0_2048_1532/master/2048.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/718db076fe57df0a24482eeb6f1f80e3815c7473/0_0_2048_1532/master/2048.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="old photo of a woman and a child" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/718db076fe57df0a24482eeb6f1f80e3815c7473/0_0_2048_1532/master/2048.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="332.880859375" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>The trial of Louise Woodward, a British nanny in the US, brought to public attention serious doubts about the credibility of SBS.</span> Photograph: Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>Even Guthkelch, its creator, <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23979627-34-declaration-of-norman-guthkelch-expresses-some-horror-dated-feb-3-2012" data-link-name="in body link">came out in 2012</a> and said his work had been distorted.

Since 1993 there have been 32 exonerations in the US following SBS convictions, according to the <a href="https://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Pages/detaillist.aspx" data-link-name="in body link">National Registry of Exonerations</a>.</p><p>This week, an <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23986841-20230913-decision-affirming-preclusion" data-link-name="in body link">appeals court in New Jersey ruled</a> that SBS was “junk science” and “scientifically unreliable” and could not be used by prosecutors at trial.</p><p>In Ohio, <a href="https://www.dispatch.com/story/news/courts/2022/12/08/columbus-man-out-on-bond-after-being-granted-new-trial-in-shaken-baby-case/69713472007/" data-link-name="in body link">Alan Butts</a> was released in December after 19 years in prison having been granted a new trial. His story is uncannily similar to Roberson’s: he was accused of the “shaking baby” death of his girlfriend’s two-year-old son, Jadyn, in 2002, the year Nikki died.</p><p>New evidence showed Jadyn had pneumonia at the time of his death – just like Nikki. The toddler was on medication no longer given to children because it can cause sudden death – just like Nikki.</p><p>Katherine Judson is a lawyer who has represented Butts for several years. She is also executive director of the Center for Integrity in Forensic Sciences, which has<a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23979629-cifs-center-for-integrity-in-forensic-sciences-amicus-brief" data-link-name="in body link"> filed a brief</a> supporting Roberson in his supreme court petition.</p><p>In Judson’s view, the Butts and Roberson narratives are so remarkably akin that they provide an excellent example of “flukey justice”.</p><p>“You can have the exact same facts in a different jurisdiction,” she said, “and one person gets released while the other person languishes on death row.”</p><hr><p><span><span>I</span></span>n recent years, the Innocence Project has become increasingly involved in exposing junk science. The group has focused on a range of forensic techniques that in their application have put innocent people at risk.</p><p>They include <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/28/forensics-bite-mark-junk-science-charles-mccrory-chris-fabricant" data-link-name="in body link">bitemark analysis</a>, under which it was believed erroneously that a bite on a corpse’s skin could be matched to a suspect’s dentition; hair microscopy, which claimed falsely that a single hair from a crime scene could be linked visually to an individual; and fire science, which suggested that analysis of a burn pattern could determine whether a fire was arson – until it was discovered that intentional and accidental fires leave the same imprints.</p><figure id="6864c3b2-d0da-4bba-aa1f-fe8b9f97bd76" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" deferuntil="idle" props="{&quot;richLinkIndex&quot;:73,&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/feb/05/texas-john-balentine-death-penalty-case-execution&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;‘Can you spell lynching?’: lawyer’s shocking note in Texas execution case&quot;,&quot;prefix&quot;:&quot;Related: &quot;,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;richLink&quot;,&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;6864c3b2-d0da-4bba-aa1f-fe8b9f97bd76&quot;},&quot;ajaxUrl&quot;:&quot;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;display&quot;:1,&quot;theme&quot;:0,&quot;design&quot;:10}}" config="{&quot;renderingTarget&quot;:&quot;Web&quot;}"></gu-island></figure><p>The Innocence Project has joined Roberson’s legal team. Vanessa Potkin, director of special litigation, said the group had decided to fight for the prisoner’s life because “an innocent man is at serious risk of being executed”.</p><p>She added: “Like so many faulty forensics that have played a role in the nation’s exonerations, the evidence upon which his conviction and death sentence rest has been disproven since the time of his trial.”</p><p>Paradoxically, Texas is a leader in countering junk science. In 2013, the state introduced a first-in-the-nation <a href="https://www.texasbar.com/AM/Template.cfm?Section=articles&amp;Template=/CM/HTMLDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentID=47776" data-link-name="in body link">“junk science writ”</a> that allowed prisoners – especially those on death row – to challenge sentences on grounds of misused forensic science. It was under this law that in 2016 Sween saved Roberson from imminent death by securing a stay of execution four days before his scheduled lethal injection.</p><p>But the hope generated by the new junk science law in Texas has proven a chimera. There have been about 70 attempts by death row inmates to utilize the law and of those the number that have obtained relief is zero.</p><p>Kosoul Chanthakoummane was one of those who appealed through the junk science law. He had been put on death row on the back of three different types of junk science: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/oct/04/false-witness-us-using-hypnosis-convict-criminals" data-link-name="in body link">hypnosis of a witness</a> to obtain identification, bitemark analysis and a discredited form of DNA testimony.</p><p>In August 2022, Texas <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2022/08/17/texas-execution-kosoul-chanthakoummane-lethal-injection/10354060002/" data-link-name="in body link">executed him</a> anyway.</p><p>There is a real possibility that that fate now awaits Roberson. Having secured a stay of execution, he was granted an evidentiary hearing at his trial court. Sween presented a mass of new evidence. Expert witnesses were called to speak about the growing consensus that SBS is junk science.</p><p>The court heard that Nikki’s symptoms could all be explained by natural rather than violent causes, including her pneumonia and chronic illness and the life-threatening medication. It was also told about Roberson’s autism, and the unfounded nature of the sexual assault allegation.</p><p>Despite the voluminous testimony, a state judge <a href="https://www.cbs19.tv/article/news/local/judge-denies-recommending-east-texas-death-row-inmates-appeal-exoneration-new-trial/501-39bfdd8e-b687-4065-9b34-25b60c320e6c?fbclid=IwAR0prM39z6qk3QAM9lMHodMm71V2SG_zOvR1_oPXgmpnDu_rqggbD0Edg8c" data-link-name="in body link">denied the appeal</a>. She said shaken baby syndrome remained a reasonable diagnosis and that Roberson “failed to provide any newly discovered evidence” undermining his conviction.</p><p>In January, the Texas court of criminal appeals <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2023/01/11/robert-roberson-texas-death-penalty-shaken-baby/" data-link-name="in body link">affirmed that decision</a>.</p><p>The state is now <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/22/22-7546/272085/20230714145417415_Roberson%20BIO%20FINAL%20Tables%20SIGNED.pdf" data-link-name="in body link">actively lobbying</a> the supreme court justices to persuade them not to take Roberson’s case. Its argument cites testimony from Teddie, Roberson’s estranged girlfriend, who said he had a bad temper and would yell at Nikki and hit her.</p><p>Roberson’s legal team counter that Teddie was not a credible witness. Her own sister testified for Roberson, insisting she had never seen him mistreat Nikki and telling the jury Teddie had a problem with telling the truth.</p><p>Brian Wharton, who after retiring from law enforcement retrained as a cleric and is now pastor of a United Methodist church situated 10 miles away from death row,<strong> </strong>testified at the junk science hearing. He told the court that, drawing on his 14 years’ experience as a police officer, he had come to the view that shaken baby syndrome was a fallacy and that without it there was no evidence supporting Roberson’s death sentence.</p><p>“What case would we have been able to make?” Wharton told the Guardian. “There was no crime scene, no forensic evidence. It was just three words: shaken baby syndrome. Without them, he would be a free man today.”</p><p>Roberson said the worst part of his fight to stay alive was not knowing. Will the supreme court take his petition, or will they not?</p><p>He has had so many knock-backs that he knows the worst could happen. But he says he’s ready for whatever comes. He recently participated in the first faith-based program on Texas’s death row and said it had deepened his religious belief.</p><p>Roberson has a tattoo on his right arm which he inked himself when he was still a child, aged 17. That was many years before he grew up and became a father to Nikki.</p><figure id="2edf0ba4-283f-4b1c-b8b2-b1f16eae15ab" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-5"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/331bb1fc751e5602430cae3daf5a5e7d776211d2/0_0_4000_2667/master/4000.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/331bb1fc751e5602430cae3daf5a5e7d776211d2/0_0_4000_2667/master/4000.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1300px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/331bb1fc751e5602430cae3daf5a5e7d776211d2/0_0_4000_2667/master/4000.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1140px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1140px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/331bb1fc751e5602430cae3daf5a5e7d776211d2/0_0_4000_2667/master/4000.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1140px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/331bb1fc751e5602430cae3daf5a5e7d776211d2/0_0_4000_2667/master/4000.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/331bb1fc751e5602430cae3daf5a5e7d776211d2/0_0_4000_2667/master/4000.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 980px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/331bb1fc751e5602430cae3daf5a5e7d776211d2/0_0_4000_2667/master/4000.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/331bb1fc751e5602430cae3daf5a5e7d776211d2/0_0_4000_2667/master/4000.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/331bb1fc751e5602430cae3daf5a5e7d776211d2/0_0_4000_2667/master/4000.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/331bb1fc751e5602430cae3daf5a5e7d776211d2/0_0_4000_2667/master/4000.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/331bb1fc751e5602430cae3daf5a5e7d776211d2/0_0_4000_2667/master/4000.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/331bb1fc751e5602430cae3daf5a5e7d776211d2/0_0_4000_2667/master/4000.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="A tattoo on Robert Roberson’s arm." src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/331bb1fc751e5602430cae3daf5a5e7d776211d2/0_0_4000_2667/master/4000.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="296.70374999999996" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>A tattoo on Robert Roberson’s arm.</span> Photograph: Ed Pilkington/The Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>“F T W,” it says.</p><p>The Guardian asked what it stood for.

<p><em>Reckless destruction of houses and removal of belongings takes Liberlanders by surprise </em></p>



<p>MATEOS MARINA, LIBERLAND, SEPTEMBER 22 – On the morning of Thursday, September 21, a private company under orders from the Zupan (Prefecture) Inspector acting on behalf of the Croatian Forests (Hrvatske Šume d.o.o.) made an unannounced extraterritorial incursion into Liberland and demolished and removed Liberland property. Liberlanders living on the land were threatened with arrest if they interfered.&nbsp;An unspecified number of Liberlanders were arrested under the vague charges of “failure to comply with a lawful order.”</p>



<p>Croatian police escorted the demolition crews who committed this act of indiscriminate destruction. This assault was committed without warning and without the forest company or police issuing any reasons or justification.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Persons present were not given any time to gather their own personal belongings, much less their equipment. Thankfully, no one was injured, but our property was damaged and confiscated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This has occurred on the International Day of Peace, of all days.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some of our buildings and equipment that were destroyed and/or removed:</p>



<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Two well-constructed garden houses and one marina house</li>



<li>One well-constructed and fully functioning field kitchen with multiple refrigeration units and stoves</li>



<li>Generators and electronic equipment</li>



<li>Starlink antenna and router</li>



<li>Quad bike, bicycles and other transportation</li>



<li>Food and other supplies</li>



<li>Personal belongings</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>



<p>Croatian law enforcement officers and employees of Hrvatske Šume d.o.o. involved in this operation have acted unprofessionally, and have been insulting and obnoxious to our people. We asked for a written notice or report and we were told there is no report and there won’t be one.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have documented this incident and the individuals involved with photos and video, and we are already pursuing legal action against these acts on several levels.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The settlement heroically remains on the land and is resisting these attempts at breaking their will.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Croatian demolition of Liberland structures goes back to September 2017, when the original hunting lodge (lovački dom) was demolished. In 2023, we established Jefferson Square in front of the old house and began excavation and rebuilding of the old lodge and its basement.</p>

<p>The Free Republic of Liberland was proclaimed on April 13, 2015 on this parcel of land, Gornja Siga, in accordance with international law regarding terra nullius and bona vacantia, as the land remained unclaimed by either Serbia or Croatia for over 25 years. Liberland has the ability to bring significant investment, jobs and tourism to this economically depressed region.</p>



<p>Our legal position supporting our claim is clear: that the territory has never been part of Croatia and falls outside of its borders. This has been confirmed in their diplomatic correspondence with Serbia as well as its complete absence in all official published maps of Croatia. The Croatian border police are duly authorized to conduct activities aimed at safeguarding both Croatia’s national boundaries and the broader Schengen borders within Liberland. We not only acknowledge this authority but also welcome it, as their efforts contribute to enhancing the overall security of our own nation.</p>

<p>In addition, Serbia has relinquished its authority over the territory. There are no competing claims to land in Gornja Siga other than the Free Republic of Liberland and this land has no state affiliation with Croatia or Serbia.</p>



<p>We seek to work with the Croatians to find a peaceful, mutually beneficial solution for our countries. Liberland officials have always acted in accordance with international law and to avoid confrontations with Croatian border police. Our position is that people of Liberland should be able to visit and live in the area without harassment or arrest. Our citizens are not building on Croatian soil, but in their own country, the Free Republic of Liberland, and we are not a threat or risk to Croatia in any way.</p>

<p>Liberland wishes to become a good, reliable partner with Croatia. <strong>The settlement will be rebuilt immediately.</strong> Plans for the next months include the construction of a hotel [link to video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEa9CQVsjik">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEa9CQVsjik</a> ], children’s park, adventure tours, boating, cycling and much more. We also look forward to working with the Croatian state forest company, Hrvatske Šume d.o.o., on future harmonious cooperation and to avoid conflict.</p>



<p>Our project aims to be one of the biggest opportunities that Croatia has to bring investment, jobs and tourism to a region that has been languishing economically for some time. We have already spent considerable funds in the local economy in Osijek-Baranja County and this can only grow as more people want to visit the area – with the approval and participation of our closest neighbors, we can develop those opportunities together.</p>

Twenty years ago, a group of friends shot a Matrix fan film on a limited budget. Sharing their creation with the rest of the word initially appeared to be too expensive, but then they discovered a new technology called BitTorrent. Fast forward two decades and their “Fanimatrix" release is the oldest active torrent that's still widely shared today.

Dial-up connections were still the default and YouTube, Facebook, and Gmail had yet to be invented. </p>
<p>There was a new technology making waves at the time. BitTorrent made it much easier for people to transfer large files, opening the door to unlimited video-sharing without restraints. </p>
<p>Many people started experimenting with BitTorrent by sharing pirated films and TV shows. These files made their way all over the world and remained available as long as all pieces were shared in the swarm. </p>
<p>Most of these early releases remained available for a few days or weeks, and some lasted well over a year before people lost interest. In extreme cases, some torrents have managed to survive for over a decade.</p>
<h2>The Fanimatrix Torrent Turns 20</h2>
<p>The oldest surviving torrent we have seen is a copy of the Matrix fan film “<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0395147/?ref_=nm_knf_t_1">The Fanimatrix</a>”. The torrent was <a href="https://www.thefanimatrix.net/download.html">created in September 2003</a> and will turn 20 years old in a few days. A truly remarkable achievement.</p>
<p>The film was shot by a group of New Zealand friends. With a limited budget of just $800, nearly half of which was spent on a leather jacket, they managed to complete the project in nine days.</p>
<p>While shooting the film was possible with these financial constraints, finding a distribution channel proved to be a major hurdle. Free video-sharing services didn’t exist yet and server bandwidth was still very costly. </p>
<p>Technically the team could host their own server, but that would cost thousands of dollars, which wasn’t an option. Luckily, however, the group’s IT guy, Sebastian Kai Frost, went looking for alternatives. </p>
<h2>Promising New Technology</h2>
<p>Frost had a bit part in the film and did some other work as well, but the true breakthrough came when he stumbled upon a new technology called BitTorrent. This appeared to be exactly what they were looking for.</p>
<p>“It looked promising because it scaled such that the more popular the file became, the more the bandwidth load was shared. It seemed like the perfect solution,” Frost told us earlier.</p>
<p>After convincing the crew that BitTorrent was the right choice, Frost created a torrent on September 28, 2003. He also compiled a tracker on his own Linux box and made sure everything was running correctly.</p>
<center><img decoding="async" src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/fanimatrix-1.jpg" alt="fanimatrix-torrent" width="500" height="187" srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/fanimatrix-1.jpg 686w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/fanimatrix-1-300x112.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20500%20187'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/fanimatrix-1.jpg 686w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/fanimatrix-1-300x112.jpg 300w" data-lazy-src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/fanimatrix-1.jpg"></center>
<p>Today, more than twenty years have passed and the torrent is still up and running with more than a hundred seeders. As far as we know, it’s the oldest active torrent on the Internet, one that deserves to be in the history books.</p>
<h2>A Proper Celebration for the 25th?</h2>
<p>Initially, there was a plan to celebrate the 20th anniversary but that hasn’t come to fruition. Some of the original <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0395147/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm">cast members</a> have fairly successful careers now and are scattered around the world, so getting the team back together is a challenge. </p>
<p>Director and writer Rajneel Singh, who is still active in the film industry, would like to do something special for the 25th anniversary. Frost says that there is a plan to get the cast together to shoot and release a new clip, perhaps coupled with some fresh “Fanimatrix” merchandise.</p>
<p>Whether the torrent will still be going by that time is unclear, but Frost will do everything in his power to make that happen. </p>
<p>“I never expected to become the world’s oldest torrent but now it’s definitely become a thing I’d love to keep carrying on. So I’ll be keeping this active as long as I physically can,” Frost tells us. </p>
<p>There were a few times that the torrent almost died but after the news broke that this was the oldest active torrent, dozens of people stepped forward to donate their bandwidth. </p>
<p>“It’s really heartening seeing the community pull together around this torrent, despite its usually low transfer count, and work together to keep it alive and kicking. It warms my heart on the daily.” </p>
<p>“We’re super pumped that it’s still going and that people still take an interest in it. Looking forward to the 25th and having something special to share with the world,” Frost concludes. </p>

<p>Whenever I explain my research at Google into mobile text editing, I’m usually met with blank stares or a slightly hostile “Everyone can edit text on their phones, right? What’s the problem?”</p>



<p>Text editing on mobile isn’t ok. It’s actually much worse than you think, an invisible problem no one appreciates. I wrote this post so you can understand why it’s so important. But as it’s a rather nuanced issue, I may lose you. To help, I’ve sprinkled lots of headers throughout so if you get bored, just skip ahead.</p>



<h2>TL;DR</h2>



<p>Android and iOS share a common problem: they copied desktop text editing conventions, but without a menu bar or mouse. This forced them to overload the tap gesture with a wide range of actions: placing the cursor, moving it, selecting text, and invoking a pop-up menu. This results in an overly complicated and ambiguous mess-o-taps, leading to a variety of user errors.</p>



<p>It’s less of a problem if you only do short bursts of text in social media or messaging apps. But doing anything more complicated like an email gets tedious. However, in my user study on text editing, I was surprised to find that everyone had significant problems and rather severe workaround for editing text.  </p>



<p>With the extremely talented <a href="https://www.32al.io/">Olivier Bau</a>, together we created a prototype called Eloquent, which offers a much simpler solution. We presented this work at <a href="https://programs.sigchi.org/uist/2021/program/content/61484">UIST 2021</a>.</p>



<h2>Yes, text editing really is a problem</h2>



<p>In 2017, while working on Android, I had some questions about text editing and started asking around for existing user studies. I assumed that for something so core to the user experience, we would have at least a few studies. Looking back over seven years of research, I couldn’t find a single one on text editing. I was a bit stunned.</p>



<p>Text editing on mobile was considered “good enough.” Since people weren’t complaining, there was little motivation to improve it. However, I decided to conduct my own study, and the results were surprising. I gave 10 participants a simple set of text editing tasks, such as deleting an “x” from a string of characters or moving a word to the end of a sentence. Every single person had problems with targeting, using the clipboard and lots and lots of errors.</p>



<p>I asked the participants about their overall experience editing text on mobile devices. They all expressed frustration, but not so much with messaging or social media apps, where they typically only needed to write short bursts of text. However, when it came to composing more complex text, such as multiple-sentence emails, they often said things like, “I’ll start it on my phone, but if it gets too complex, I’ll just finish it on my laptop.” Even more surprising, over half of the participants said that instead of editing text, it was easier to just select all, delete, and retype, bypassing editing entirely. This is not a sign that things are working well.</p>



<p>Just to be clear, the problem here isn’t <strong>entering</strong> text, but with <strong>editing</strong> it. With better keyboards, voice transcription, and physical keyboards on many tablets, getting text into a device is not the problem it used to be. However, you will always want to edit your words afterwards.</p>



<p>While my research focused on fixing text editing problems on Android, I want to be clear that iOS, which has some significant differences to Android text editing, still has many of the same problems.</p>



<h2>Text editing is a hack</h2>



<p>Mobile devices were originally designed for consumption. The revolution of flick-scrolling made it easy to move through content. The superpower of mobiles was their on-the-go consumption of videos, photos, social media, and messaging. These are valuable tasks but require little text editing. People forget the original iPhone didn’t even have clipboard support!&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yet over the last 10 years we’ve heard over and over that it’s only a matter of time before everyone will be using tablets for everything. Apple ran an add a few years ago “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5BLs51yDQ">What’s a computer?</a>” and in 2013, Google tried a “Tablet Tuesdays” campaign to get it’s workers to use their tablets all day while at work. Tablets continue to sell fairly well but as a desktop replacement, it’s been, let’s just say, less than a resounding success.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This has been <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=tablets+not+replacing+computers&amp;sca_esv=566788144&amp;sxsrf=AM9HkKlmFItGPFjEaiRnbM2TkMs7l7k9yw%3A1695172364343&amp;ei=DEcKZcnBFLGkptQP-OyVoAk&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjJ9--UgbiBAxUxkokEHXh2BZQQ4dUDCBA&amp;uact=5&amp;oq=tablets+not+replacing+computers&amp;gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiH3RhYmxldHMgbm90IHJlcGxhY2luZyBjb21wdXRlcnMyBRAhGKABMgUQIRigATIIECEYFhgeGB1IpElQvQ9Y5kdwAXgAkAEAmAGBAaABoBWqAQQ2LjIwuAEDyAEA-AEBwgIKECMYsAIYsAMYJ8ICCxAAGIoFGIYDGLADwgIFEAAYogTCAgwQABgFGB4YDRgPGArCAggQABiKBRiGA8ICCBAhGKABGMMEwgIKECEYoAEYwwQYCsICBRAhGKsCwgIHECEYoAEYCuIDBBgBIEGIBgGQBgI&amp;sclient=gws-wiz-serp">written about</a> quite extensively, I’m not really saying anything new here. However, people don’t seem to agree why. It’s not that some people can’t be productive on tablets. There clearly are people that can make this work. But most can’t.&nbsp;Why is that? </p>



<p>There are likely many reasons, but I would argue that there are a few deep foundational UX problems with tablets that hinders productively. Text editing is one. Another is file handling, <a href="https://jenson.org/files2">something I’ve previous written about</a> if you’re interested. However, before anyone accuses me of being a nostalgic fool, I want to be clear that I am not anti-mobile. <strong>My goal is not to return back to the desktop, but to move mobile forward.</strong> How can we actually use our fix our phones and tablets to be as productive and fast as we are on desktop systems?</p>



<h2>Start with desktop text editing…</h2>



<p>Text editing on desktop has a long and interesting history, but let’s focus post 2000, where it started to stabilize. Every desktop OS has a mouse cursor that can be moved accurately with a mouse or trackpad, making it easy to click on the exact character you want.</p>



<p>Selecting text is also quite simple: after clicking down on the mouse, an additional drag of the cursor selects more. Then an EDIT menu with the classic Cut/Copy/Paste commands let you act on your selection. For must faster actions, the command keys X, C, and V made it significantly faster.</p>



<p>The combination of these three features—an accurate pointer, simple selection, and a menu with command keys—made text editing easy, relatively error-free, and unambiguous. To be fair, one can imagine improvements to this system, and I don’t wish to imply that it is perfect. It is simply the baseline against which I am comparing mobile text editing.</p>



<h2>…and then poorly copy it</h2>



<p>Given how prevalent desktop UI was when mobile was launched, it’s not surprising that it tried to copy desktop editing. The problem is that there was no mouse pointer and a menu bar with command keys. This meant it had to make significant compromises.</p>



<p>For example, instead of clicking with a mouse pointer, mobile devices use a finger to tap. This means that placing the text cursor is less accurate. This is well known in UX research as the ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat-finger_error" data-type="link" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat-finger_error">fat finger</a>‘ problem. This is why user interface guidelines suggest buttons to be fairly tall and wide as bigger targets are easier to hit. However, text characters can’t be made big enough. This usually results in placing the text cursor a bit to the left or right of where you intended.</p>



<p>The targeting problem has led to a cascade of new interaction mechanisms that technically solve the problem but have unfortunate side effects.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>The 4 changes mobile made to text editing</h2>



<h3><strong>1. Text Handles</strong></h3>



<p>Mobile adds a teardrop handle to the bottom of the text cursor. This allows the text cursor to be seen more easily and gives a handle to drag the cursor to the correct position if you miss. This all seems pretty reasonable right?</p>


<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://jenson.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image.png" alt="" width="156" height="101" srcset="https://jenson.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image.png 583w, https://jenson.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-120x78.png 120w" sizes="(max-width: 156px) 100vw, 156px"></figure></div>


<p>Actually, no! This creates our first ambiguity. The text handle is itself a tap target. Unfortunately, so is the text surrounding it. We now have two potential tap targets. When they are far apart, it’s fine. The problem only occurs when I want to tap just to the left or right of the text cursor. In this case, it’s unclear what the user wants: to move the cursor or to tap/drag the handle.</p>



<p>We saw this in our user testing when users tried to place the text cursor accurately: they would miss by a few characters and tap again to the side but the text handle would take priority and ‘eat the tap’ incorrectly assuming that the user wanted to drag it. On the desktop, if you clicked in the wrong location, you’d just click again to move the cursor, there was no ambiguity.&nbsp; While this isn’t disastrous, it adds friction. Worse, it’s the start of a trend. As we get to the other changes below, this input ambiguity will grow worse.&nbsp;</p>



<p>iOS doesn’t have a teardrop handle but it’s text cursor still has the same ‘eat the tap’ problem.</p>



<h3><strong>2. Magnifier</strong></h3>



<p>Because the text on mobile devices is so small and the finger is so relatively big, mobile devices added a magnifying glass.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are two issues with the magnifier. First, it doesn’t help you very much before you tap to place the cursor, it’s more there to help you correct your mistake. It does this by making it easier to see where you are dragging. Second, It’s visually confusing. By floating above your finger, it creates two visible cursors: the real one under your finger and a duplicate in the magnifier. It’s actually not that bad with very short text fields, but with longer emails, it’s easy to get lost and not be sure where you are in the&nbsp; text.</p>


<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" src="https://jenson.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image2-700x362.png" alt="" width="498" height="258" srcset="https://jenson.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image2-700x362.png 700w, https://jenson.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image2-120x62.png 120w, https://jenson.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image2-768x397.png 768w, https://jenson.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image2-1536x794.png 1536w, https://jenson.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image2-2048x1059.png 2048w, https://jenson.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image2-720x372.png 720w, https://jenson.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image2-1440x744.png 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 498px) 100vw, 498px"><figcaption>Android Magnifier is visually confusing in large text fields.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Apple’s magnifier is even more chaotic, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22524824/apple-ios-15-iphone-text-selection-magnifying-glass-reversal" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxapcquSZxs">vanishing in iOS13</a> and returning in iOS15. </p>



<h3><strong>3. Selecting text</strong></h3>



<p>On desktop, selecting text was a natural extension of mouse clicking by keeping the button down and dragging. With mobile this isn’t possible so there is a completely new gesture, double tap. Wait, there is actually a third gesture long press, which also works. Both do the same thing. Don’t look at me, I didn’t design this….</p>



<p>However this new gesture causes more friction as decoding a ‘double tap’ must wait a bit to see if another tap is coming, so this usually delays the effect of a single tap. This means the text handle has another way to ‘eat a tap’.</p>



<p>However selection is still not done as you often want to select more than a single word. To solve this problem, the text cursor handle is at both ends of the selection. This allows you to extend your selection by dragging it at either end. This means selecting a few words is actually a two step process: select a word and then drag the selection handles. This compound set of gestures to edit text, like placing the cursor described above isn’t horrible, but it isn’t nearly as elegant as desktop and definitely adds yet more friction.</p>


<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://jenson.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Selection-Handles.png" alt="" width="151" height="76" srcset="https://jenson.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Selection-Handles.png 361w, https://jenson.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Selection-Handles-120x60.png 120w" sizes="(max-width: 151px) 100vw, 151px"></figure></div>


<h3><strong>4. Popup menu</strong></h3>



<p>As there is no menu bar with mobile, there needs to be some way to invoke the clipboard commands. This is done in two ways. The first is the most obvious: as soon as there is a text selection, show a menu above the selection. This is visually a bit busy but it doesn’t create any tapping ambiguity. This works fairly well for cut/copy but is more problematic for pasting, which usually doesn’t start with a selection. The solution is a bit hidden: you can bring up this same menu by tapping the text handle. This means users have to learn TWO different gestures to bring up the menu. iOS is nearly the same.</p>

<p>This problem is made even worse on Android as the text handle actually disappears after 4 seconds of inactivity. The reason for this is that the handle slightly obscures text beneath it. This makes the menu completely unavailable. If you want to bring up the menu, you have to tap again to make the handle appear and then tap the handle a second time. It’s no wonder people are confused.</p>



<p>This menu-on-handle-tap adds yet another targeting ambiguity. A common problem with trying to place the cursor is that the user accidentally taps the handle which brings up the menu.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For highly proficient users, this gets even worse as their is no command key equivalents for cut, copy, or paste. Whether you are a beginner or expert, you must use the menu in the exact same way. Imagine if on the desktop, everyone had to use the Edit menu to cut and paste text. This is just lazy design. While we should always take care of novice users first, we shouldn’t ignore proficient users. Part of the unspoken reason desktop clipboard use is so high is the speed in which it can be used. Mobile has none of this.</p>



<h2>How a tap can be misinterpreted</h2>



<p>These extra mobile hacks that shoehorn desktop text editing into the mobile experience are functional, they get the job done, but each one adds another way a tap can be misinterpreted. Each time the user taps one of these actions can occur:</p>



<ul>
<li>place the cursor</li>



<li>bring up the menu (if there already is a cursor)</li>



<li>start a drag</li>



<li>start a double tap</li>



<li>start a long press</li>
</ul>



<p>If you are very deliberate, these separate actions can be managed. This isn’t a complete train wreck. My point however is that it is fragile. There are just so many ways the user can end up surprised. Here are some of the errors I saw in my user testing:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Problem 1:</strong> When a user taps, due to the fat finger problem, they miss the location they wanted. </li>



<li><strong>Problem 2:</strong> If they tap slightly to the side to place the cursor correctly, they tap the text handle and the menu comes up, confusing them. They are forced to tap away to dismiss the menu and try again.</li>



<li><strong>Problem 3:</strong> Instead of getting the menu, their second tap is interpreted as a trivial drag and nothing happens.</li>



<li><strong>Problem 4:</strong> If the user attempts a double tap, but taps a bit to the side, or hits the text handle, the OS misunderstands and nothing happens.</li>



<li><strong>Problem 5:</strong> The user wants to paste into an empty field and is confused as there is no text cursor and no menu. They must first tap into the empty field to get the cursor and THEN tap the cursor a second time to get the menu.</li>



<li><strong>Problem 6:</strong> The user traps to place the cursor but looks up to talk for a second, During this brief pause, the text handle times out and disappears. Looking down they want to tap the handle but don’t see it and are confused. They have to tap again.</li>
</ul>



<p>All of this friction starts to add up. Each of these changes, on their own, seem reasonable. However, taken together they add a significant amount of errors and friction to the process. In my study of 10 users, it took 5 attempts on average to place the cursor accurately. We had one user tap 19 times! It’s no longer a surprise why so many of our test users just gave up on text editing, retyping everything instead of actually editing the text. </p>



<p>Obviously, text editing on mobile is possible as millions do it every day. My point isn’t that “it’s impossible” but a much more subtle “it’s much harder than we think”. Many of you will just say “get a grip grandpa, it’s not that bad” and dismiss my concerns. But keep in mind that most text created on mobile is short and low effort, usually messages and social media comments. Editing is rarely needed so this friction doesn’t matter so much. I’ve also had many people tell me of students writing entire papers on their phone. That’s right, it’s possible! Lots of people run marathons too, that doesn’t mean everyone is able to.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you don’t believe me, please try doing some significant text editing on either Android or iOS. Just use voice input to dictate a quick paragraph and then try to clean it up. Pay attention to how many errors happen and then honestly tell me that it was a simple and easy experience.</p>



<p>If we want mobile to replace desktop (or at least compete with it), it has to grow beyond these backward looking tap-hacks to something designed specifically for mobile. Instead of poorly copying the desktop, we should lean into the touch experience to create something fluid, clear, and much simpler.</p>



<h2>Eloquent: one path forward</h2>



<p>Before I go into the details of Eloquent, I want to emphasize that my primary goal in this post is to fully describe the problem. Make this invisible problem visible to you. Many people don’t realize how bad it is. Given this, I hope we can agree that something needs to be done. You may not agree with Eloquent, and that’s fine. I hope that other, even better solutions will be suggested.</p>



<p>Since this post is already quite long, I will list the key things we tried below, but I will rely on the introductory video I made for UIST to give you a more complete demonstration of our efforts. Because the problem involves the collision between tapping, selecting, the magnifier, and menu usage, it is difficult to fix the problem without addressing all four simultaneously.</p>



<h3><strong>Simplified cursor placement</strong></h3>



<p>Our core goal was to create a tap action that is completely unambiguous, similar to the simplicity of a mouse click on desktop. We wanted a tap to always place the cursor. As mentioned above, one problem with today’s text handles is that they “eat” the cursor, thinking it is the start of a drag or menu. We unified this logic so that any time the finger touches the screen, it is considered the start of a drag. A tap is simply a very short drag. This means that if you tap to the side of the handle and lift quickly, the cursor will jump to the new location; if however you drag slowly, the cursor drags to the same location. Problem solved.</p>



<p>Visually, we always keep the text handle visible. We didn’t want it to come and go. This encourage users to drag, which is more accurate than tapping. We made it semi-transparent so that it didn’t obscure the text. This made the cursor visually stable and eliminated the 4-second timeouts.</p>



<h3><strong>Unified magnifier</strong></h3>



<p>By having the magnifier integrated over the text cursor, it simplifies the visual presentation so the user is always looking at the cursor in context. As Eloquent is so drag focused, this improves the overall experience and encourages dragging. We use a fisheye technique to economize on space and keep the user oriented to their text.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, this approach led us to an unexpected place: it’s actually better to ALWAYS drag the cursor as the magnifier allows much more accurate placement of the text cursor. As we started using this system more, we just starting dragging immediately and narrowed in on our target. This is a new behavior but one we found was very very quick to adopt.</p>



<h3><strong>Drag Press for text selection</strong></h3>



<p>The main reason there is so much ambiguity today is that there is only a single tap gesture. This forces the ambiguities we’ve seen. So we created a new gesture while the user was dragging: pressing harder while dragging. This gesture starts a text selection. We used the barometric pressure sensor in the phone to detect when the user pressed. We did this as it was the only hardware sensor available to us at the time. We maintained two running averages, a long one as a base measure and a short one to trigger the event. When the short average went above the long average, we fired a drag-press event. This was remarkably robust, working well even though the sensor varies quite a bit. A more advanced mechanism, such as Apple’s unfortunately discontinued<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_Touch#3D_Touch"> 3D Touch hardware</a> could be a better solution.</p>



<h3><strong>Improved menus</strong></h3>



<p>Finally, we try to enable a more fluid gesture so that proficient users can actually get some much needed speed into using copy/paste. As nearly every text menu today (both Android and iOS) are hierarchical, we wanted to take this opportunity to flatten the menu as well. This wasn’t a critical goal but was such a horrible UX crime that we wanted to solve it as well. We wanted to at least try to come up with something that is more discoverable. Every single user tester found this easily and enjoyed using it. </p>



<p>In addition, after the drag-press starts the selction, a second drag-press brings up the menu. This allows targeting, selecting, and bringing up the menu in a single fluid gesture. As a power user feature, it’s also possible to quickly flick to invoke the menu item. This allows mobile a rough equivalent of command keys. This isn’t a backward looking hack but a mobile inspired approach where the entire process of targeting, selecting, and clipboard action can now be done with a single fluid gesture. (see the video below for a demonstration)</p>

It also has no hierarchy and just slides off screen</figcaption></figure>



<h3><strong>Game-like animations</strong></h3>



<p>We added several small visual animations to help users learn and understand what is going on:</p>



<ol>
<li>The text cursor ‘scoots’ between locations and the handle ‘wobbles’ when it arrives. We did this to reinforce the idea that the cursor was always there. It also implied you could always drag it.</li>



<li>The cursor also ‘dimples’ when you tap, invoking the magnifier briefly. The goal here is to encourage users to do more than just tap. We were trying to encourage dragging.</li>



<li>When a force-press occurs over a word, we ‘inflate’ the highlight, reinforcing the gesture.</li>



<li>Swipe menu gestures animate the selection in the direction of the swipe. Swipe up for cut removes the selection upwards. Swipe down for paste, drops the new selection down.</li>
</ol>

<h3><strong>Backward compatibility</strong></h3>



<p>We made a concerted effort to make today’s existing actions possible in this new model, as we wanted to provide a bridge for existing users. For example, by making tap and drag ALWAYS drag the cursor wouldn’t work for large vertically scrolling text fields. So we did a simple check on drag-start and if it the first few pixels were vertical, we’d do a standard vertical scroll of the text field. All other drags just placed and dragged the cursor. It actually worked quite well.</p>



<p>Enough text, here is a quick demo that shows it off much better:</p>

</p></figure>



<h2>Shipping this</h2>



<p>Unfortunately, shipping something like Eloquent would be challenging. First, as too many people mistakenly see text editing as “done”, there is little appetite to fix it. Second, users have been trained to cope with this error-prone approach for well over a decade. Asking people to change at this point would be hard.</p>



<p>But most importantly, fixing text editing isn’t seen as important enough in the war between Android and iOS. It’s not the flashy feature that shifts your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_promoter_score" data-type="link" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_promoter_score">Net Promoter Scores</a>. What I find ironic is that a fundamental change, like fixing text editing, could make people feel much more at ease using their phones  and could be an enormous reason to switch. But it would be a slow burn and take years of steady effort. Android just can’t think this way. Apple just might.</p>



<p>It’s too bad, because I’d like mobile to grow and be even more productive than desktops are today. But the way we’re going, we’ll be editing text this way for the next 20 years at least. Do we really want this? Too bad text editing is an invisible problem no one appreciates.</p>
