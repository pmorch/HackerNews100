                            <blockquote>
<p>14 Nov 2025 UPD: We have updated the article with more information on the bailiff reports sent to us and the person who ordered them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The FBI has been investigating Archive.is (also known as Archive.today), <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/11/fbi-subpoena-tries-to-unmask-mysterious-founder-of-archive-today/">as was recently revealed</a>. The agency issued a subpoena to the site’s domain registrar, asking for information about the person behind it, citing a “federal criminal investigation.”</p>
<p>Archive.is was launched in 2012 by someone using the name <em>Denis Petrov</em> — though whether that’s their real identity remains unclear. The site lets users save “snapshots” of web pages by submitting URLs, which makes it a valuable tool for preserving content that might otherwise disappear. But because it can also be used to bypass paywalls, it’s long been a thorn in the side of many media organizations.</p>
<p>While the exact nature of the FBI investigation hasn’t been confirmed, it is speculated it can be related to copyright or CSAM (child sexual abuse material) dissemination issues. Altogether, the situation suggests growing pressure on whoever runs Archive.is, and on intermediaries that help make its service accessible. AdGuard DNS, as it turns out, may have just become one such pressure point.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-got-entangled">How we got entangled</h2>
<p>A few weeks ago, we were contacted by a representative of an organization called the <em>Web Abuse Association Defense</em>, a French group claiming to fight against child pornography. Their website is <a href="https://webabusedefense.com/">webabusedefense.com</a>, and here is the <a href="https://archive.fo/7wxhb">archived version</a> as of November 7.</p>
<p>They demanded that we block the domain <code>archive.today</code> (and its mirrors) in AdGuard DNS, alleging that the site’s admin had refused to remove illegal content since 2023. To be clear, Archive.today allows users to take “snapshots” of any webpages, including potentially illegal material. In such cases, it’s the site admin’s job to respond to complaints and promptly remove that content.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.adtidy.org/blog/new/tcg4cemails1.png" alt="The email we received from WAAD" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>This struck us as strange — we’re not a hosting provider, and it seemed unusual for an infrastructure-level service like ours to be asked to take action like this.</p>
<p>Soon after, the situation escalated into what we could only describe as direct threats:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.adtidy.org/blog/new/d4962emails2.png" alt="One of the follow-up emails we received" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>We won’t share all the screenshots here, but there were several similar messages.</p>
<p>We sought legal advice, and unfortunately discovered that French law, specifically Article 6-I-7 of the <em>Loi pour la Confiance dans l'Économie Numérique</em> (LCEN), might actually require us to respond and apply blocking measures, at least for French users.</p>
<p><strong>That said, this whole situation shows just how inadequate this regulation is. Such decisions should be made by a court — a private company shouldn’t have to decide what counts as “illegal” content under threat of legal action.</strong></p>
<p>Even so, the story didn’t quite add up. Since someone was trying to pressure us into taking action, we decided to contact the other side, Archive.today, directly.</p>
<p>We sent an email to Archive.today’s contact address and asked two simple questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Can they remove the illegal content from the URLs we were informed about?</li>
<li>Is it true that they refused to remove such content in the past, and had they been notified about it before?</li>
</ol>
<p>They replied within a few hours. The response was straightforward: the illegal content would be removed (and we verified that it was), and they had <em>never</em> received any previous notifications about those URLs.</p>
<p>Moreover, they hinted that Archive.today had been targeted by a campaign of “serial” complaints, supposedly from French organizations, sent to various companies and institutions that could potentially harm the site. They even shared <a href="https://imgur.com/a/6Dh2YVq">a link</a> demonstrating a complaint similar to the one we had received.</p>
<p>At that point, things were looking increasingly odd, so we decided to dig deeper into the “complainant.”</p>
<p><em>The Web Abuse Association Defense</em> website references several well-known organizations — Europol, OFAC, NCA — yet provides no details or evidence of any cooperation with them.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.adtidy.org/blog/new/e6k6opolice.png" alt="A screenshot taken on the WAAD website" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>The association itself was registered in February–March 2025, around the same time its website appeared. There is very little public information about it. Interestingly, registering an association in France can apparently be done <a href="https://www.associations.gouv.fr/e-creation">entirely online</a> and does not require proof of identity.</p>
<p>The association is registered at an address used for <a href="https://www.bureaucrequi.fr/">mass company registration</a>, which isn’t inherently problematic but it does indicate that the entire registration process could have been carried out online by a single person.</p>
<p>Its <a href="https://x.com/webabuseasso">Twitter/X account</a> appeared only recently — in August 2025. It has just four followers, and its feed consists of just a few reposts.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.adtidy.org/blog/new/wl9kytwitter.png" alt="WAAD X account" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>None of this proves anything by itself, but something still doesn’t add up. In their first email, the “head” of the association claimed that their correspondence with Archive.today started with a bailiff report from 2023. That timeline simply doesn’t fit.</p>
<p>We examined the so-called “bailiff reports” they had sent us as evidence. It’s important to note that these aren’t bailiff reports in the English sense — they’re <em>“constat d’huissier sur Internet,”</em> official records of online content such as webpages, posts, or videos. <a href="https://qualijuris.constat-huissier-internet.fr/">These particular reports were ordered online via the service called Qualijuris</a>, and, based on the timestamps, most of them were also created in August 2025 — not 2023.</p>
<p>Only two of these bailiff reports were ordered in 2023 from a similar service. What’s interesting is that they weren’t ordered by WAAD. The name of the person who ordered these bailiff reports matches the name that appears in <a href="https://imgur.com/a/6Dh2YVq">the correspondence</a> shared with us by the Archive.today administrator — the same one he wrote about <a href="https://x.com/archiveis/status/1771339650176553315">on X in 2024</a>. In that case, the complaint appeared to come from a real lawyer — but someone had registered a domain with the lawyer’s surname, containing nothing but a redirect to the lawyer’s actual website, and did it on the same day the complaint was sent. The domain was used solely to send the emails and it is not active anymore. Interestingly, that email also invoked the LCEN law.</p>
<p>So what is the link between WAAD and that lawyer from before? Are these bailiff reports real and could it be that this is a case of impersonation of a real person? We don’t know yet, but we hope to discover the truth soon enough.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we couldn’t dig any deeper about who exactly is behind WAAD. The domain <code>webabusedefense.com</code> is registered with <em>name.com</em>, but ownership information (including historical records) is hidden. They use ProtonMail for email, so that’s another dead end. The site itself is behind Cloudflare, making further tracing impossible.</p>
<h2 id="what-we-have-in-the-end">What we have in the end</h2>
<p>With everything said and done, here’s where things stand now:</p>
<ol>
<li>The illegal content was promptly removed from Archive.today after we notified them.</li>
<li>The complaints against the site look extremely suspicious. In our case, they came from an organization that was only recently registered that seems deliberately set up to hide the identities of those behind it.</li>
<li>The sample complaint shared by Archive.today’s admin shows signs of impersonating a real person. We have contacted the person in question and are currently waiting for a reply.</li>
<li>In both our case and that other example, the recipients were pressured to act under the French LCEN law. However, that same law also provides penalties for false reports:
<blockquote>
<p>Art. 6-I-4 LCEN:<br>
4. Any person who presents content or activity to the persons referred to in paragraph 2 as being illegal with the aim of having it removed or its dissemination stopped, when they know this information to be inaccurate, shall be punished by one year’s imprisonment and a fine of €15,000.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>We believe there are indications of criminal behavior here that should be investigated by law enforcement. Therefore, we will file an official complaint with the French police, including all relevant details.</li>
<li>All this is unfolding amid reports of an <a href="https://www.heise.de/en/news/Archive-today-FBI-Demands-Data-from-Provider-Tucows-11066346.html">FBI investigation</a> into the owner of Archive.today. It seems that this investigation may be related to CSAM hosting. While we can’t confirm any connection between that case and ours, the timing is certainly suspicious.</li>
</ol>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>  <p>Spec-Driven Development (SDD) revives the old idea of heavy documentation before coding — an echo of the Waterfall era. While it promises structure for AI-driven programming, it risks burying agility under layers of Markdown. This post explores why a more iterative, natural-language approach may better fit modern development.</p>
<h2 id="the-rise-of-specification"><a href="#the-rise-of-specification">The Rise of Specification</a></h2>
<p>Coding assistants are intimidating: instead of an IDE full of familiar menus and buttons, developers are left with a simple chat input. How can we ensure that the code is correct with so little guidance?</p>
<p><img src="https://marmelab.com/_astro/before-after.fEW0y8It_Z2geGnl.webp" alt="Before and after" width="960" height="326" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></p>
<p>To help people write good software with coding assistants, the open-source community designed a clever way to guide a coding agent. Based on an initial prompt and a few instructions, an LLM generates product specifications, an implementation plan, and a detailed list of tasks. Each document depends on the previous one, and users can edit the documents to refine the spec.</p>
<p><img src="https://marmelab.com/_astro/SDD.BHlY9x0e_2bwTOz.svg" alt="Spec-Driven-Development" width="2030" height="356" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></p>
<p>Eventually, these documents are handed over to a coding agent (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, you name it). The agent, now properly guided, should write solid code that satisfies the business requirements.</p>
<p>This approach is called Spec-Driven Development (SDD), and several toolkits can get you started. To name a few:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/github/spec-kit">Spec-Kit</a> by GitHub</li>
<li><a href="https://kiro.dev/">Kiro</a> by AWS</li>
<li><a href="https://tessl.io/">Tessl</a> by Tessl</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD">BMad Method (BMM)</a> by BMad Code</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want a comparison of these tools, I recommend the excellent article <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/exploring-gen-ai/sdd-3-tools.html">Understanding Spec-Driven-Development: Kiro, spec-kit, and Tessl</a> by Birgitta Böckeler.</p>
<h2 id="the-markdown-awakens"><a href="#the-markdown-awakens">The Markdown Awakens</a></h2>
<p>How does a spec look? It’s essentially a bunch of Markdown files. Here’s an example using GitHub’s spec-kit, where a developer wanted to display the current date on a time-tracking app, resulting in <a href="https://github.com/adguernier/frequentito/pull/42/files">8 files and 1,300 lines of text</a>:</p>

<p>At first glance, these documents look relevant. But the devil is in the details. Once you start using SDD, a few shortcomings become clear:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Context Blindness</strong>: Like coding agents, SDD agents discover context via text search and file navigation. They often miss existing functions that need updates, so reviews by functional and technical experts are still required.</li>
<li><strong>Markdown Madness</strong>: SDD produces too much text, especially in the design phase. Developers spend most of their time reading long Markdown files, hunting for basic mistakes hidden in overly verbose, expert-sounding prose. It’s exhausting.</li>
<li><strong>Systematic Bureaucracy</strong>: The three-step design process is excessive for most cases. Specs contain many repetitions, imaginary corner cases, and overkill refinements. It feels like they were written by a picky clerk.</li>
<li><strong>Faux Agile</strong>: SDD toolkits generate what they call “User Stories,” but they often misuse the term (e.g. “As a system administrator, I want the referred by relationship to be stored in the database” is not a user story). It doesn’t cause bugs but it’s distracting.</li>
<li><strong>Double Code Review</strong>: The technical specification already contains code. Developers must review this code before running it, and since there will still be bugs, they’ll need to review the final implementation too. As a result, review time doubles.</li>
<li><strong>False Sense of Security</strong>: The SDD methodology is meant to keep the coding agent on track, but in practice, agents don’t always follow the spec. In the example above, the agent marked the “verify implementation” task as done without writing a single unit test—it wrote manual testing instructions instead.</li>
<li><strong>Diminishing Returns</strong>: SDD shines when starting a new project from scratch, but as the application grows, the specs miss the point more often and slow development. For large existing codebases, SDD is mostly unusable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most coding agents already have a <a href="https://code.claude.com/docs/en/common-workflows#use-plan-mode-for-safe-code-analysis">plan mode</a> and a <a href="https://www.vtrivedy.com/posts/claudecode-tools-reference#11-todowrite">task list</a>. In most cases, SDD adds little benefit. Sometimes, it even increases the cost of feature development.</p>
<p>To be fair, SDD helps agents stay on task and occasionally spots corner cases developers might miss. But the trade-off (spending 80% of your time reading instead of thinking) is, in my opinion, not worth it.</p>
<h2 id="revenge-of-the-project-manager"><a href="#revenge-of-the-project-manager">Revenge of the Project Manager</a></h2>
<p>Maybe SDD doesn’t help much today because the toolkits are still young and the document prompts need refinement. If that’s the case, we just need to wait a few months until they improve.</p>
<p>But my personal opinion is that <strong>SDD is a step in the wrong direction</strong>. It tries to solve a faulty challenge:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“How do we remove developers from software development?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It does so by replacing developers with coding agents and guarding those agents with meticulous planning.</p>
<p>In that sense, SDD reminds me of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model">the Waterfall model</a>, which required massive documentation before coding so that developers could simply translate specifications into code.</p>
<p><img src="https://marmelab.com/_astro/waterfall.DdJJ7uzH_1qgaN.webp" alt="Waterfall model" width="570" height="374" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></p>
<p>But developers haven’t been mere executors for a long time, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_design_up_front">Big Design Up Front</a> has proven to fail most of the time because it piles up hypotheses. <strong>Software development is fundamentally a non-deterministic process</strong>, so planning doesn’t eliminate uncertainty (see the classic <a href="https://www.cs.unc.edu/techreports/86-020.pdf">No Silver Bullet</a> paper).</p>
<p>Also, who is SDD really for? You must be a <strong>business analyst</strong> to catch errors during the requirements phase, and a <strong>developer</strong> to catch errors during design. As such, it doesn’t solve the problem it claims to address (removing developers), and it can only be used by the rare individuals who master both trades. SDD repeats the same mistake as No Code tools, which promise a “no developer” experience but actually require developers to use them.</p>
<h2 id="a-new-hope"><a href="#a-new-hope">A New Hope</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://agilealliance.org/agile101/">Agile methodologies</a> solved the problem of non-deterministic development by trading predictability for adaptability. I believe they show us a path where coding agents can help us build reliable software, without drowning in Markdown.</p>
<p>Give a coding agent a simple enough problem, and it won’t go off the rails. Instead of translating complex requirements into complex design documents, we should <strong>split complex requirements into multiple simple ones</strong>.</p>
<p>I’ve successfully used coding agents to build fairly complex software without ever looking at the code, by following a simple approach inspired by <a href="https://theleanstartup.com/principles">the Lean Startup methodology</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Identify the next most risky assumption in the product.</li>
<li>Design the simplest experiment to test it.</li>
<li>Develop that experiment. If it fails, go back to #2. Otherwise, repeat starting from #1.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here’s an example: this <a href="https://github.com/marmelab/sculpt-3D">3D sculpting tool</a> with adaptive mesh, which I built with <a href="https://claude.com/product/claude-code">Claude Code</a> in about 10 hours:</p>
<video controls="" autoplay="" playsinline="" muted="true" loop=""><source src="https://marmelab.com/_astro/sculpt-3D-demo.THlcK5vM.mp4" type="video/mp4"><p>Your browser does not support the video tag.</p></video>
<p>I <strong>didn’t write any spec</strong>. I just added small features one by one, correcting the software when the agent misunderstood me or when my own idea didn’t work well. You can see my instructions in the <a href="https://github.com/marmelab/sculpt-3D/blob/main/claude_code_logs.md">coding session logs</a>: they’re often short and vague, and sometimes lead to dead ends, but that’s fine. When implementing simple ideas is cheap, building in small increments is the fastest way to converge toward a good product.</p>
<p>Agile methodologies freed us from the bureaucracy of waterfall. They showed that close collaboration between product managers and developers eliminates the need for design documents. <strong>Coding agents supercharge Agile</strong>, because we can literally write the product backlog and see it being built in real time—no mockups needed!</p>
<p>This approach has one drawback compared to Spec-Driven Development: it doesn’t have a name. “Vibe coding” sounds dismissive, so let’s call it <a href="https://marmelab.com/blog/2025/09/03/natural-language-developers.html">Natural Language Development</a>.</p>
<p>I do have one frustration, though: coding agents use text, not visuals. Sometimes I want to point to a specific zone, but browser automation tools aren’t good enough (I’m looking at you, <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp">Playwright MCP Server</a>). So if we need new tools to make coding agents more powerful, I think the focus should be on richer visual interactions.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>Agile methodologies killed the specification document long ago. Do we really need to bring it back from the dead?</p>
<p>Spec-Driven Development seems born from the minds of CS graduates who know their project management textbooks by heart and dream of removing developers from the loop. I think it’s a missed opportunity to use coding agents to empower a new breed of developers, those who use natural language and build software iteratively.</p>
<p>Let me end with an analogy: coding agents are like the invention of the combustion engine. Spec-Driven Development keeps them confined to locomotives, when we should be building cars, planes, and everything in between. Oh, and just like combustion engines, we should use coding agents sparingly if we care about the environment.</p>  </div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://cefboud.com/posts/tcp-deep-dive-internals/">https://cefboud.com/posts/tcp-deep-dive-internals/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45935503">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><span>The Internet is Cool. Thank you, TCP</span> </p><div><p>The internet is incredible. It’s nearly impossible to keep people away from. But it can also be unreliable: packets drop, links congest, bits mangle, and data corrupts. <em>Oh, it’s dangerous out there!</em> (I’m writing this in Kramer’s tone)</p><p>So how is it possible that our apps just work? If you’ve networked your app before, you know the drill: <code>socket()</code>/<code>bind()</code> here, <code>accept()</code> there, maybe a <code>connect()</code> over there, and it just works. Reliable, orderly, uncorrupted data flows to and fro.</p><p>Websites (HTTP), email (SMTP) or remote access (SSH) are all built on top of TCP and just work.</p><h2 id="why-tcp"><span>Why TCP</span><a href="#why-tcp"><i></i></a></h2><p>Why do we need TCP? Why can’t we just use the layer below, IP?</p><blockquote><p>Remember, the network stack goes: Physical –&gt; Data Link (Ethernet/Wi-Fi, etc) –&gt; Network (IP) –&gt; Transport (TCP/UDP).</p></blockquote><p>IP (Layer 3) operates at the host level, while the transport layer (TCP/UDP) works at the application level using ports. IP can deliver packets to the correct host via its IP address, but once the data reaches the machine, it still needs to be handed off to the correct process. Each process “binds” to a port: its address within the machine. A common analogy is: the IP address is the building, and the port is the apartment. Processes or apps live in those apartments.</p><p>Another reason we need TCP is that if a router (a piece of infra your average user does not control) drops packets or becomes overloaded, TCP at the edges (on the users’ machines) can recover without requiring routers to participate. The routers stay simple, the reliability happens at the endpoints.</p><p>Packets get lost, corrupted, duplicated, and reordered. That’s just how the internet works. TCP shields developers from these issues. It handles retransmission, checksums, and a gazillion other reliability mechanisms. If every developer had to implement those themselves, they’d never have time to properly align their flexboxes, a truly horrendous alternate universe.</p><p>Jokes aside, the guarantee that data sent and received over a socket isn’t corrupted, duplicated, or out of order, despite the underlying network being unreliable, is exactly why TCP is awesome.</p><h2 id="flow-and-congestion-control"><span>Flow and Congestion Control</span><a href="#flow-and-congestion-control"><i></i></a></h2><p>When you step back and think about network communication, here’s what we’re really trying to do: machine A sends data to machine B. Machine B has a finite amount of space and must store the incoming data somewhere before passing it to the application, which might be asleep or busy. This temporary storage takes the name of a <strong>receive buffer</strong> and is managed by the kernel:</p><p><code>sysctl net.ipv4.tcp_rmem</code> =&gt; <code>net.ipv4.tcp_rmem = 4096 131072 6291456</code>, a min of 4k, default of 128k and max of 8M.</p><p>The problem is that space is finite. If you’re transferring a large file (hundreds of MBs or even GBs), you could easily overwhelm the destination. The receiver therefore needs a way to tell the sender how much more data it can handle. This mechanism is called <strong>flow control</strong>, and TCP segments include a field called the <strong>window</strong>, which specifies how much data the receiver is currently willing to accept.</p><p>Another issue is overwhelming the network itself, even if the receiving machine has plenty of buffer space. You’re only as strong as your weakest link: some links carry gigabits, others only megabits. If you don’t tune for the slowest link, congestion is inevitable.</p><p>Fun fact: in 1986, the Internet’s bandwidth dropped from a few dozen KB/s to as low as <strong>40 bps</strong> (yes, bits per second! yes, those numbers are wild!), in what became known as <strong>congestion collapse</strong>. When packets were lost and systems retried sending them, they made congestion even worse: a doom loop. To fix this, TCP incorporated ‘play nice’ and ‘back off’ behaviors known as <strong>congestion control</strong>, which help prevent the Internet from clogging itself to death.</p><h2 id="some-code-a-plain-tcp-server"><span>Some Code: A Plain TCP Server</span><a href="#some-code-a-plain-tcp-server"><i></i></a></h2><p>With all low-level things like TCP, C examples are the way to go. Just show it like it is.</p><div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

        <section><h2>Language Design</h2><img src="https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/images/languagedesignscribe.png"></section>

<p>So, you want to design your own language? Of course you do. Or perhaps you are taking a class and are being forced to create a programming language under penalty of a bad grade. What kinds of things do you need to know?</p>

<h2>Designing a Language</h2>

<p>Of course you want to design (and implement!) your own programming language! It’s fun. It’s creative. It’s empowering.</p>

<p>How do we do it? In a nutshell, the process is iterative, cycling between four phases:</p>

<p><img src="https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/images/languagedesign.png" alt="languagedesign.png"></p>
<p>Doing the phases over and over is important; for example, while writing the compiler, you may be like “woah this is impossible” and then realize “oh shoot this part of the language wasn’t designed right!”</p>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<p>It helps to be experienced. If you’re not, that’s okay, actually—you might get lucky!</p>

<p>But don’t mistake creativity for luck that shows up without pre-existing knowledge. The most creative people are those with a <em>lot</em> of knowledge and experience. So you should still study and practice!</p>

<p>Your success as a language designer will be massively aided by knowledge in three main areas:</p>

<ol>
<li><b>Programming Paradigms</b>. You should know a number of different ways that computations can be structured. These include: <span>imperative</span> <span>declarative</span> <span>structured</span> <span>object-oriented</span> <span>functional</span> <span>applicative</span> <span>concatenative</span> <span>logic</span> <span>protocol-oriented</span> <span>aspect-oriented</span> <span>array</span> <span>event-driven</span> <span>dataflow</span> <span>agent-based</span> etc.<p>See Wikipedia’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm">list of programming paradigms</a>.</p>
</li>

<li><b>Programming Language Concepts</b>. You should have a good sense of most, if not all, of the following things: Sequencing, conditional execution, iteration, recursion, functional decomposition, modularity, synchronization, metaprogramming, binding, scope, extent, volatility, subtyping, pattern matching, type inference, closures, prototypes, introspection, instrumentation, annotations, decorators, memoization, traits, streams, monads, actors, mailboxes, comprehensions, continuations, wildcards, promises, regular expressions, proxies, transactional memory, inheritance, polymorphism, parameter modes, type classes, generics, reflection, concurrency, parallelism, distribution, persistence, transactions, garbage collection, and many more terms.<p>I’m working on a <a href="https://github.com/rtoal/plang-glossary">glossary</a> of such terms that may be helpful to review.</p>

</li><li><b>Existing ProgrammingLanguages</b>. It’s nice to have a feel for a variety of languages. Here are a few that are good to be familiar with (and the reasons why they are good to study):
<ul>
<li><b>Python</b>, for basic imperative programming and scripting
</li><li><b>Smalltalk</b>, for OOP done beautifully
</li><li><b>JavaScript</b>, for event-driven features, async, and promises
</li><li><b>Io</b>, for ideas on building up everything from a minimal semantics
</li><li><b>Julia</b>, for multiple dispatch
</li><li><b>Clojure</b>, <b>Racket</b>, <b>Scheme</b>, and <b>Common Lisp</b>, for Lispiness (macros, etc.)
</li><li><b>Standard ML</b>, <b>OCaml</b>, <b>F#</b>, and <b>Elm</b>, for Hindley-Milner typing and more
</li><li><b>Haskell</b>, for typeclasses and functional purity
</li><li><b>eToys</b>, <b>Scratch</b>, <b>Snap!</b>, and <b>GP</b> for the blocks approach
</li><li><b>Java</b> and <b>C#</b>, for being enterprisey
</li><li><b>Kotlin</b>, <b>Ceylon</b>, and <b>Scala</b>, as examples of evolving Java
</li><li><b>Erlang</b> and <b>Elixir</b>, for expressing concurrent processes in a distributed fashion
</li><li><b>Fortran</b>, <b>Chapel</b>, and <b>Parasail</b>, for expressing muticore and parallel programming
</li><li><b>PureScript</b>, <b>TypeScript</b>, and <b>ClojureScript</b>, as examples of evolving JavaScript
</li><li><b>C</b>, because it is the quintessential systems language</li>
<li><b>C++</b>, <b>Rust</b>, <b>Zig</b>, and <b>Odin</b> for making systems programming less painful and more secure
</li><li><b>Go</b> and <b>Swift</b>, for more examples of modern, but generally mainline, ideas
</li><li><b>J</b> and <b>K</b>, for array programming
</li><li><b>Idris</b>, for dependent typing
</li><li><b>Prolog</b> and <b>Mercury</b>, for logic programming
</li><li><b>Forth</b> and <b>Factor</b>, for concatenative programming
</li><li><b>Quipper</b>, because it’s a language for quantum computing
</li><li><b>Brainfuck</b>, <b>Malbolge</b>, <b>LOLCODE</b>, <b>Whitespace</b>, and other classic esoterics
</li><li><b>GolfScript</b>, <b>CJam</b>, <b>Pyth</b>, <b>Jelly</b>, and other golfing languages, because this gives you a good sense of putting power into small syntactic constructs
</li><li><b>Piet</b> and <b>Hexagony</b>, for, well, check them out....
</li></ul>
<p>Also check out <a href="http://rtoal.github.io/ple/overviews.html">this mini-encyclopedia of 70 languages</a>.</p>

<h2>Getting Ready</h2>

<p>Remember, many people have designed languages before you. They made mistakes. They came up with brilliant ideas. Many were wildly successful. Some never made it big. Some people have brought in years of research on how people think and learn to come up with principles for language (and environment) design.</p>

<p>You should learn form their experiences.</p>

<p>Study classic papers. Read web essays. Visit online courses. Here is a small sampling of things to study and places to look for more information:</p>

<p>And understand that traditional, mainstream programming languages, are not at all the epitome of computational expression. Languages can be much more:</p>

<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/prIwpKL57dM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>Ready to strike out on your own? Here are some things to think about, in the form of a, you guessed it, a checklist:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you have a specific audience in mind? Artists? Graphic designers? AI researchers? Numeric and Scientific nerds? Natural language types? Game developers? Machine learning people? Animators? High performance folks? System programmers? Or do you want a general purpose language? Or do you just want to do what <em>you</em> want?</li>
<li>Understand the audience that the language is designed for, and what kinds of things they want to create with it (or problems they want to solve with it).</li>
<li>Determine if your language is to be (1) a reasonable, usable language or (2) an esoteric/joke/golfing language.</li>
<li>Determine if it is to be pragmatic, idealistic, researchy, or evil.
</li><li>Determine whether you want your language firmly in one camp—OO, functional, logic, concatenative, plain-imperative—or be a multiparadigm symphony. Or a multiparadigm cacophony.
</li><li>Determine whether it is to be built on a single characteristic building block (a <em>crystallization of style</em>) or one with a huge variety of syntactic forms for multiple semantic aspects (an <em>agglutination of features</em>).
</li><li>Determine your concurrency model. Do you want all your programs to be single-threaded and sequential? Or are you looking for something event-driven and async? Or multithreaded? Or distributed?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Choosing a Starter Set of Features</h2>

<p>Come up with a list of capabilities, or features. Make sure they enable programmers to express their creations by following the suggestions and principles in the <a href="http://worrydream.com/#!/LearnableProgramming">Learnable Programming</a> essay, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Make meaning transparent
  </li><li>Explain in context
  </li><li>Make flow and time tangible and visible
  </li><li>Show the data, and avoid hidden state
  </li><li>Use metaphor
  </li><li>Allow easy decomposition and recomposition
  </li><li>Allow the programmer to write readable code—you <em>do</em> support mentioning parameter names in calls, right?
</li></ul>

<div><p><b>Exercise</b>: Skim the Learnable Programming essay. Or, better, read the whole thing </p><s>if</s><p> when you have time.
</p></div>
<p>What kind of questions might you have here? Here are some totally random ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>If your language supports functions:
  <ul>
  <li>Must you pass the exact number of arguments the function expects?
  </li><li>Can you specify parameter names in the call?
  </li><li>Do you have rest parameters? optional parameters? keyword parameters? default parameters?
  </li><li>Are the parameters typed?

  </li><li>Any dependent types?
  </li></ul>
</li><li>What do your expressions look like?
  <ul>
  <li>And does your runtime follow eager or lazy evaluation? Or both?
  </li><li>Do you have only prefix, only postfix, only infix, or a wild mix of operators?
  </li><li>Can you overload operators? If so, how?
  </li><li>Can you change the precedence of operators? Even the built-in ones? At runtime?

  </li><li>Do you have <code>break</code> and <code>continue</code>? Anything like Ruby’s <code>retry</code> and <code>redo</code>?
  </li><li>Do you have exceptions? Or do you need Go-style constructs? Or do you have nullables everywhere?
  </li><li>Do you have a timer for sleeping, delaying execution, or running on intervals?

  </li></ul>
</li><li>How do you support concurrency?
  <ul>

  </li><li>Shared memory only? Message passing only? Or both? If shared memory, is it mutable? If so, do you have locks, higher-level synchronization devices, or some kind of transactional memory?
  </li><li>Do you support different levels of granularity of concurrency?
  </li><li>Are tasks spawned implicitly when their enclosing block begins, or do they require explicit invocation?
  </li><li>Do tasks die when the enclosing block or spawning task terminates? Or does the spawner wait for all internal tasks to terminate?
  </li><li>Do taks know who started them?
  </li><li>If an asynchronous task is launched, how is a result obtained? Callback, promise, or some other mechanism?
  </li><li>Is message passing done via named channels, named processes, or bulletin board?
  </li><li>Is message passing always synchronous, asynchronous, or both?
  </li><li>Is there timed or conditional synchronization mechanisms?
  </li><li>Can tasks detect their own state?
  </li></ul>
</li><li>How meta are you?
  <ul>
  <li>Can a program get a list of its global variables, loaded classes, top-level functions, etc.? Can a class get a list of its fields, methods, constructors, superclass(es), subclasses, etc.? Can a function get its parameters, locals, return types, etc.?
  </li><li>Can a function find out who called it?
  </li><li>Can a variable be read or set via its name (a string) only? Can a function or method be invoked by its name (a string) only? Can new variables or types or functions be created at run time, given only their name and some indication of how they should look?
  </li><li>Does the language have a macro system? If so, is it string-based or AST-based?
  </li><li>Is it possible to unquote within a macro?
  </li><li>Are macros hygienic? What syntactic devices are provided to explicitly capture in- scope variables, if any?
  </li></ul>
</li></ul>

<h2>From Features To Abstract Syntax</h2>

<p>When you have a good idea of your language features, you’ll want to figure out a good way to organize them, structurally. This is known as your language’s <dfn>abstract syntax</dfn>. In an abstract syntax we don’t worry much about punctuation and parentheses and such microscopic details. We are interested in the overall structure. Here’s a look at abstract syntax trees in JavaScript:</p>

<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4OWdhor5btU?si=kytoL6z6AlxLZ8Pl" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<p>When defining your language, you will want to specify exactly what the AST Nodes are, how they are related to each other, and what their properties are. For JavaScript, the AST Node types come from a specification called <a href="https://github.com/estree/estree">EsTree</a>. I've summarized the main interfaces here:</p>

<p>I’ve built an interactive application for you to explore AST generation. Please <a href="https://rtoal.github.io/js-ast/">try it out!</a>.</p>

<p><b>Exercise</b>: Please try it out.
</p>
<blockquote><strong>Too much detail?</strong><p>You may notice that the EsTree specification has a lot more detail than the hand-drawn ASTs in the video above. This is okay. The specification is used to build actual compilers and interpreters, while for hand-drawn ASTs we just like to give the big picture and can take some “shortcuts.”</p></blockquote>

<h2>From Abstract Syntax to Concrete Syntax</h2>

<p>Now it’s time to think about what your language will really look like! Remember that design is creative and iterative, so you will want to begin, like all artists do, with sketches:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sketch programs or program fragments in your language.
</li><li>Sketch fragments that are <em>not</em> in your language.
</li><li>Come up with a nice, consistent, syntactic theme.
</li></ul>

<p>Do a lot of experimentation here! You will probably want to put creative effort into designing languages people like to use! What kind of syntax issues do they deal with? Dozens, actually, and we can’t cover them all. But how about a taste of just a few. We’ll peek at just a few issues that sometimes generate strong opinions.</p>

<h3>Overall Phrase Structure</h3>

<p>You will need to adopt a scheme for showing structure. The popular approaches are: Curly-brace (JavaScript, Java, C++, C#), Terminal-end (Ruby, Ada), Nested parentheses (Lisp, Clojure, Racket), Indentation (Python), Blocks (EToys, Scratch, Snap!), Pictures (Piet), Other (Haskell, Erlang, Prolog).</p>

<p>The important idea here is that a single abstract syntax can be realized with many different <dfn>concrete syntaxes</dfn>. A concrete syntax specifies exactly which strings of characters make up structurally valid programs. For example, the AST:</p>

<p><img src="https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/images/little-ast.png" alt="little-ast.png"></p>
<p>represents each of the following (and more!):</p>

<pre><code>while y - 5 == 3:
    print(x * (3 + y))
</code></pre>
<pre><code>while y - 5 == 3 {
  print(x * (3 + y))
}
</code></pre>
<pre><code>while y - 5 == 3 loop
  print(x * (3 + y))
end
</code></pre>
<pre><code>(while (= (- y 5) 3)
    (print (* x (+ 3 y))))
</code></pre>
<p><b>Exercise</b>: The last syntax is used in Clojure, Lisp, Scheme and others. Note that in some ways, this <strong>IS</strong> the abstract syntax. How so?
</p>
<p><b>Exercise</b>: Here is another: <code>y 5 - 3 == [x 3 y + * print] while</code>. Do you know of, or can you find, any languages which have that kind of syntax?
</p>
<p>In addition to structure, your choice of keywords, operators, punctuation (or lack thereof) are part of your design. Here’s an abstract syntax:</p>

<p><img src="https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/images/ikiast.png" alt="ikiast.png"></p>
<p>Let’s try out a few things:</p>

<pre><code>program:
    var x, y: integer
    while y - 5 == 3:
        var y: integer
        get(x)
        get(y)
        x = 2 * (3 + y)
    put(5)
</code></pre>
<pre><code>int x, y;
while y - 5 = 3 {
    int y;
    STDIN -&gt; x;
    STDIN -&gt; y;
    x &lt;- 2 * (3 + y);
}
STDOUT &lt;- 5;
</code></pre>
<pre><code>COMMENT THIS LOOKS LIKE OLD CODE
DECLARE INT X.
DECLARE INT Y.
WHILE DIFFERENCE OF Y AND 5 IS 3 LOOP:
    DECLARE INT Y.
    READ FROM STDIN INTO X.
    READ FROM STDIN INTO Y.
    MOVE PRODUCT OF 2 AND (SUM OF 3 AND Y) INTO X.
END LOOP.
WRITE 5 TO STDOUT.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>(program
  (declare x int)
  (declare y int)
  (while (= (- y 5) 3)
    (define (y int))
    (read x y)
    (assign x (* 2 (+ 3 y)))
  )
  (write 5)
)
</code></pre>
<p><b>Exercise</b>: Play around and sketch a few more.
</p>
<h3>Delimiters</h3>

<p>How to separate one construct from another is a really big issue in syntax design, believe it or not. We can identify two main classes of languages: those in which newlines are significant and those in which they are not.</p>

<h4>“Insignificant” Newlines</h4>

<p>In many languages, newlines are just like any other whitespace character (except for minor exceptions such as single-line comments and single-line string literals. Then, unless you have an S-Expression-based syntax as in LISP, Scheme, and Clojure, you’ll need semicolons to terminate (or separate) statements. This means you <em>can</em> (but shouldn’t) write code like:</p>

<pre><code>#define ZERO 0
    unsigned  gcd(   unsigned   int  // Euclid's algorithm
      x,unsigned   y) {   while ( /* hello */  x&gt;   ZERO
   ){unsigned temp=x;x=y   %x;y  = temp ;}return

   y ;}
</code><img src="https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/images/c-logo32.png"></pre>
<h4>“Significant” Newlines</h4>

<p>Where you place your newlines matters greatly in, let’s see, Assembly languages, Python, Ruby, JavaScript, Elm, Haskell, Go, Swift, and yes, many others. The rules can get pretty technical.</p>

<p><strong>Python</strong> scripts are defined as sequences of <dfn>logical lines</dfn>, delimited by the token NEWLINE. A statement may not cross logical lines, except in the case of <dfn>compound statements</dfn> in which each constituent <dfn>simple statement</dfn> ends with a NEWLINE. Logical lines are made up of one or more physical lines according to line joining rules. Lines are <em>implicitly</em> jointed within parentheses, brackets, or braces; lines can be <em>explicitly</em> joined by ending with a backslash. These rules are somewhat exclusive of comments and string literals.</p>

<p><strong>Ruby</strong> looks at the end of each line and says “well if up to here it looks like we’ve completed a statement the we have.”  This means you have to be careful where you break lines:</p>

<pre><code>puts 5
  + 3
puts 5 +
  3
</code><img src="https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/images/ruby-logo32.png"></pre>
<p>prints 5 then 8.</p>

<p><b>Exercise</b>: Why?
</p>
<h4>“Possibly Significant” Newlines</h4>

<p>JavaScript requires most statements to be terminated by semicolons, but the <em>compiler will put one in for you if it looks like you might have missed one</em>. The rules by which this <dfn>automatic semicolon insertion</dfn> (ASI) is done have to be learned and they might be hard to remember.</p>

<blockquote data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">[God creating JavaScript]<br>GOD: It uses prototype-based inheritance.<br>Angel: Nice.<br>GOD: Also it secretly adds semicolons to ur code.<br>A: wat</p>— Neckbeard Hacker (@NeckbeardHacker) <a href="https://twitter.com/NeckbeardHacker/status/768475375399755776">August 24, 2016</a></blockquote>


<p>If you are going to be a serious JavaScript programmer, you need to learning the rules of ASI <strong>whether you choose to use semicolons or not</strong>.</p>

<p><b>Exercise</b>: Research the famous <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/9.0/index.html#sec-rules-of-automatic-semicolon-insertion">Rules of Automatic Semicolon Insertion</a>. Which statements are supposed to be terminated by a semicolon? When is a semicolon inserted? Give four examples of how writing JavaScript in a "free-form" manner is impossible because of semicolon insertion.
</p>

<p>Some people feel very strongly whether to use or not to use semicolons:</p>

<p><img src="https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/images/zzzzing.png" alt="zzzzing.png"></p>
<h3>Function Calls</h3>

<p>Most programming languages have functions. Seriously. But there are a lot of ways to work them into your design. Basic questions include: Must functions have exactly one argument, or zero or more arguments? Parens or no parens? Positional or keyword arguments? Argument labels? If no arguments, can we omit parentheses?</p>

<p>You can play around and see what you can come up with:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>push(myStack, 55)</code></li>
<li><code>push myStack 55</code></li>
<li><code>[push myStack 55]</code></li>
<li><code>(push myStack 55)</code></li>
<li><code>push(on: myStack, theValue: 55)</code></li>
<li><code>push(theValue: 55, on: myStack)</code></li>
<li><code>push on:myStack theValue:55</code></li>
<li><code>push({ on: myStack, theValue: 55 })</code></li>
<li><code>push { on: myStack, theValue: 55 }</code></li>
<li><code>push({ theValue: 55, on: myStack })</code></li>
</ul>
<p>You might want to consider an ultra-low precedence function application, like they have in Haskell and F#:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>sum (filter even (map square a))</code></li>
<li><code>sum $ filter even $ map square $ a</code></li>
<li><code>sum &lt;| filter even &lt;| map square &lt;| a</code></li>
<li><code>a |&gt; filter even |&gt; map square |&gt; sum</code></li>
</ul>

<p>The flip side of function calls is function definitions. You’re likely familiar with default parameters, and rest parameters. Python has cool mechanisms for requiring arguments to be positional or keyword, based on the definition. Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>def sqrt(x, /)</code></li>
<li><code>def line(*, x1, x2, y1, y2, width, style, color)</code></li>
<li><code>def f(a, b, /, c, d, *, e, f)</code></li>
</ul>

<h3>Syntactic Sugar</h3>

<p><dfn>Syntactic sugar</dfn> refers to forms in a language that make certain things easier to express, but can be considered surface translations of more basic forms.</p>

<p>This is best understood by example. There are zillions of examples out there. Here are a few. (<strong>Disclaimer</strong>: Some of these are just examples I made up and are not part of any real language.)</p>

<table aria-label="desugaring">
<tbody><tr><th>Construct</th><th>Desugared Form</th><th>Description
</th></tr><tr><td><code>x += n</code></td><td><code>x = x + n</code></td><td>Compound assignment

</td></tr><tr><td><code>a + b</code></td><td><code>operator+(a, b)</code> <i>or</i><br><code>"+"(a, b)</code> <i>or</i><br><code>__add__(a, b)</code></td><td>Common in languages that allow overloading

</td></tr><tr><td><code>a[i]</code></td><td><code>*(a + i)</code></td><td>(C, C++ pointer arithmetic) And <code>i[a]</code> works too!

<p>When the sugared form is completely gratuitous or actually makes the code <em>less</em> readable, you sometimes hear the term <dfn>syntactic syrup</dfn> or <dfn>syntactic saccharin</dfn>.</p>

<h3>Syntactic Salt</h3>

<p>Here’s the definition from <a href="http://www.outpost9.com/reference/jargon/jargon_toc.html">The New Hacker’s Dictionary</a>:</p>

<blockquote>The opposite of syntactic sugar, a feature designed to make it harder to write bad code.
Specifically, syntactic salt is a hoop the programmer must jump through just to prove that he knows what’s going on, rather than to express a program action. Some programmers consider required type declarations to be syntactic salt. A requirement to write “<code>end if</code>”, “<code>end while</code>”, “<code>end do</code>”, etc. to terminate the last block controlled by a control construct (as opposed to just “<code>end</code>”) would definitely be syntactic salt. Syntactic salt is like the real thing in that it tends to raise hackers’ blood pressures in an unhealthy way.</blockquote>

<h3>Candygrammars</h3>

<p>Some people love verbose code, because explicit is better than implicit. But if you are language designer, be pragmatic: there is such a thing as code that is too verbose. What about trying to make the code like human language? Here’s an example in Hypertalk (taken from Wikipedia):</p>

<pre><code>on mouseDown
  answer file "Please select a text file to open."
  if it is empty then exit mouseDown
  put it into filePath
  if there is a file filePath then
    open file filePath
    read from file filePath until return
    put it into cd fld "some field"
    close file filePath
    set the textStyle of character 1 to 10 of card field "some field" to bold
  end if
end mouseDown
</code></pre>
<p>And here’s an example from a language that some students developed, and regretted:</p>

<pre><code>to get the truth value prime of whole number n:
    return no if n &lt; 2
    for each d in 3 to n - 1 by 2:
        return no if d divides n
    end
    return yes
end
for each k in 1 to 100:
    write k if prime(k)
end
</code></pre>
<p>In practice this kind of verbosity is worse than it sounds. Here’s what the New Hacker’s Dictionary has to say about this:</p>

<blockquote>
<strong>candygrammar /n./</strong> A programming-language grammar that is mostly syntactic sugar; the term is also a play on “candygram.” COBOL, Apple’s Hypertalk language, and a lot of the so-called “4GL” database languages share this property. The usual intent of such designs is that they be as English-like as possible, on the theory that they will then be easier for unskilled people to program. This intention comes to grief on the reality that syntax isn’t what makes programming hard; it’s the mental effort and organization required to specify an algorithm precisely that costs. Thus the invariable result is that candygrammar languages are just as difficult to program in as terser ones, and far more painful for the experienced hacker.
<p>[The overtones from the old Chevy Chase skit on Saturday Night Live should not be overlooked. This was a "Jaws" parody. Someone lurking outside an apartment door tries all kinds of bogus ways to get the occupant to open up, while ominous music plays in the background. The last attempt is a half-hearted "Candygram!" When the door is opened, a shark bursts in and chomps the poor occupant. There is a moral here for those attracted to
candygrammars.]

<h3>Terseness</h3>

<p>Some languages pride themselves on doing a whole lot with few characters:</p>

<p>An example from Ruby (do you see what this does?):</p>

<pre><code>c = Hash.new 0
ARGF.each {|l| l.scan(/[A-Z']+/i).map {|w| c[w.downcase] += 1}}
c.keys.sort.each {|w| puts "#{w}, #{c[w]}"}
</code><img src="https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/images/ruby-logo32.png"></pre>
<p>An example from APL (The 99 bottles of beer program taken from Rosetta Code):</p>

<pre><code>bob  ←  { (⍕⍵), ' bottle', (1=⍵)↓'s of beer'}
bobw ←  {(bob ⍵) , ' on the wall'}
beer ←  { (bobw ⍵) , ', ', (bob ⍵) , '; take one down and pass it around, ', bobw ⍵-1}
↑beer¨ ⌽(1-⎕IO)+⍳99
</code><img src="https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/images/apl-logo32.png"></pre>
<p>Here’s APL again, with an expression to find all the prime numbers up to R:</p>

<pre><code>(~R∊R∘.×R)/R←1↓⍳R
</code><img src="https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/images/apl-logo32.png"></pre>
<p>Some people love terse, concise code, because it says only what it needs and reduces the cognitive load, leaving you with less useless noisy syntax to learn. But if you are language designer, be pragmatic: there is such a thing as code that is too terse. Unless...that’s your goal....</p>

<h3>Golfing Languages</h3>

<p>Golfing languages take terseness to the next level. A golfing language is a kind of <a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language">esoteric programming language</a> (a non-practical language created to experiment with weird ideas, be hard to program in, or be humorous) that allows programs to be written in an insanely small number of characters (or bytes).</p>

<p>Here are some CJam programs:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>"Hello, world!"</code></li>
  <li><code>5{"Hello, world"oNo}*</code></li>
  <li><code>0X{_2$+}A*]N*</code></li>
  <li><code>l~@-@@-mh</code></li>
  <li><code>1{_B&lt;}{_'**N+o)}w;</code></li>
</ul>
  
<p>Here are some Pyth programs (taken from the documentation):</p>

<ul>
<li><code>"Hello, world!</code></li>
<li><code>FNrZhTN</code></li>
<li><code>FNUhTN</code></li>
<li><code>VhTN</code></li>
<li><code>K1FNr1hQ=K*KN;K</code></li>
<li><code>.!Q</code></li>

<h2>Defining Your Language</h2>

<p>Traditionally, real world language definitions come in three main flavors:</p>
<ul>
<li>An official document, with a mix of formal notation and informal descriptions (Very common)
</li><li>An official document, with 100% of the definition specified in a formal notation (Very rare)
</li><li>A “reference implementation,” namely a compiler or interpreter, so that the language “definition” is simply “whatever this program does” (Typical for some scripting languages). An advantage if this approach is that there are never any compiler bugs!
</li></ul>

<p><b>Exercise</b>: Why exactly is a reference implementation compiler by definition bug-free? If being bug-free is so great, why don’t all languages do this? What are the downsides?
</p>
<p>An official definition will have three parts:</p>

<table aria-description="three-part-language-definition">
<tbody><tr><th rowspan="2">Syntax (Structure)</th><th colspan="2">Semantics (Meaning)</th></tr>
<tr><th>Statics</th><th>Dynamics</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>What are the structural entities (e.g., declarations, expressions, statements, modules) and how do they fit together, perhaps with punctuation?</td>
<td>What are the non-structural rules that define a legal program (e.g., type checks, argument-parameter matching rules, visibility rules, etc.)?</td>
<td>What does a program do? What effects do each of the forms of a well-structured, legal program have on the run-time environment?</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>Why are there three parts instead of two (i.e., just syntax and semantics)? Here’s why. While everyone might agree that the following is <em>structurally</em> malformed:</p>

<pre><code>#&lt;include &gt; stdio.h
main() int }
    printf["Hello, world!\n");]
{
</code></pre>
<p>the following program looks good in terms of “structure” but it’s actually <em>meaningless</em> since it violates a <strong>contextual rule</strong> that says identifiers must be declared before use:</p>

<pre><code>int main() {
    printf("%d\n", x);
}
</code></pre>
<p>We say the latter program has <dfn>static semantic errors</dfn> because they can be detected by a compiler before the program is ever run. This is in contrast to a dynamic semantic error, which can only be detected at run time.</p>

<p><b>Example</b>: You’ve probably heard the distinction between “static” and “dynamic” before. Perhaps you know that “static typing” involves type checking is done <em>prior to</em> program execution and “dynamic typing” involves checking <em>during</em> program execution. Most languages do a little of both, but one or the other usually predominates. Sometimes you get a good deal of both: in TypeScript for example, you have a set of static types which is much larger and completely different than the eight dynamic types. Fun.
</p>
<h3>Defining the Syntax</h3>

<p>Let‘s see how we would formally specify the syntax for the simple language <a href="https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/astro/">Astro</a>. Assume we’ve gone through the first two design phases, and we’ve sketched out a program that shows all the features:</p>

<pre><code>// A simple program in Astro

radius = 55.2 * (-cos(2.8E-20) + 89) % 21;    // assignment statement
the_area = π * radius ** 2;                   // a built-in identifier
print hypot(2.28, 3 - radius) / the_area;     // print statement
</code></pre>
<p>Next, we put our ideas into words. A first pass: “Programs are structured as a sequence of one or more statements, each of which is an assignment or print statement, with expressions formed with numbers, variables, function calls, and the usual arithmetic operators, which can have parentheses when needed. Comments look like the slash-slash comments of C-like languages.”</p> 

<p>Natural language isn’t super precise, so let’s try to tighten this up. Let’s get started defining programs, statements, and expressions:</p>

<pre>Program     = Statement+
Statement   = id "=" Exp ";"
            | print Exp ";"
Exp         = numeral
            | id
            | id "(" (Exp ("," Exp)*)? ")" 
            | "-" Exp
            | Exp ("+" | "-" | "*" | "/" | "%" | "**") Exp
            | "(" Exp ")"
</pre>

<p>An <dfn>identifier</dfn> is the computer science word for a <em>name</em> you attach to an <dfn>entity</dfn> (a variable, constant, function, type, parameter, or similar thing). Let’s decree that Astro identifiers begin with a letter, and can have letters, digits, and underscores (examples: <code>x</code>, <code>last_attempt</code>, <code>p1</code>, <code>p2</code>, <code>overTheLimit</code>, <code>bot8675309_jEnNy</code>). We will call letters, digits, and underscores <dfn>identifier characters</dfn> (<code>idchar</code>s). But let’s also decree that <code>print</code> is not allowed to be an identifier (so we don’t confuse people)!</p>

<p>This means we have to carefully define the <code>print</code> keyword very carefully. It’s not just the five letters p, r, i, n, and t. If it were then the program:</p>
<pre>    printy;
</pre>
<p>would be legal! It would be the five characters spelling print followed by a legal expression, namely the identifer $y$. We want the word <code>print</code> to not bleed into any following characters that might be part of an expression. In other words, <code>print</code> must not be immediately followed by an identifier character. And, we have to explicitly exclude <code>print</code> from our category of identifiers. Both things are necessary. Let’s use the <code>~</code> symbol in our notation to exclude things:</p>

<pre>print       = "print" ~idchar
idchar      = letter | digit | "_"
id          = ~print letter idchar*
</pre>

<p><b>Exercise</b>: Make sure you understand how this definition ensures that “printy” is an identifier and not <code>print</code> followed by the identifier <code>y</code>.
</p>
<p>Now time for numerals. We’ll keep things in decimal only (no worries about hex or binary), and use the times-ten-to-the notation from popular programming languages:</p>

<pre>numeral     = digit+ ("." digit+)? (("E" | "e") ("+" | "-")? digit+)?
</pre>

<p>Looking good. But what about things like <code>letter</code> and <code>digit</code>? Should we define these? Nah, let’s say that in our definition schema that these things are built-in. Let’s in fact “build in” all of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>letter</code>, for any Unicode letter</li>
<li><code>digit</code>, for <code>"0".."9"</code></li>
<li><code>alnum</code>, for <code>letter | digit</code></li>
<li><code>upper</code>, for any Unicode uppercase letter</li>
<li><code>lower</code>, for any Unicode lowercase letter</li>
<li><code>hexDigit</code>, for <code>digit | "a".."f" | "A".."F"</code></li>
<li><code>any</code>, for any Unicode character at all</li>
</ul>

<h4>Lexical vs. Phrase Syntax</h4>

<p>Did you notice that some of our syntax categories (Program, Statement, Exp) were capitalized and others (id, numeral, letter, digit) were not? Why did we do this?</p>

<p>The latter things are very primitive. They can not have internal spaces. We call these <dfn>tokens</dfn>. Think of these as basic “words”. The former, called <dfn>phrases</dfn> are more complex. Think of them as sentences. They are made up of tokens <strong>that can be separated by spaces</strong>. Tokens and phrases are very different, so we should denote them differently.</p>

<p><b>Exercise</b>: Is capitalization a good convention for distinguishing tokens from phrases? Is it biased against languages that don’t distinguish capital and small letters?
</p>
<p>So what are spaces—those characters that can separate tokens from each other? We’ll take them to be any Unicode space character. But we also want to separate tokens with comments. Let’s define how tokens should look in our language, and <em>add</em> them to the special <code>space</code> category:</p>

<pre>space      += "//" (~"\n" any)*
</pre>

<p><b>Exercise</b>: Explain why this reads as “a comment starts with two slashes and goes to the end of the line.”
</p>
<p>Let’s take a deeper look into how the lexical and phrase syntaxes differ. As a specific example, this program:</p>
<pre>  print( // ⿇🌿
420 );
</pre>
<p>is made up of these characters:</p>
<p>
<span>SPACE</span>
<span>SPACE</span>
<span>LATIN&nbsp;SMALL&nbsp;LETTER&nbsp;P</span>
<span>LATIN&nbsp;SMALL&nbsp;LETTER&nbsp;R</span>
<span>LATIN&nbsp;SMALL&nbsp;LETTER&nbsp;I</span>
<span>LATIN&nbsp;SMALL&nbsp;LETTER&nbsp;N</span>
<span>LATIN&nbsp;SMALL&nbsp;LETTER&nbsp;T</span>
<span>LEFT PARENTHESIS</span>
<span>TAB</span>
<span>SOLIDUS</span>
<span>SOLIDUS</span>
<span>SPACE</span>
<span>KANGXI&nbsp;RADICAL&nbsp;HEMP</span>
<span>HERB</span>
<span>LINEFEED</span>
<span>DIGIT&nbsp;FOUR</span>
<span>DIGIT&nbsp;TWO</span>
<span>DIGIT&nbsp;ZERO</span>
<span>SPACE</span>
<span>RIGHT PARENTHESIS</span>
<span>SEMICOLON</span>
</p>

<p>Following the lexical syntax, skipping the spaces (and comments), we get the <dfn>token stream</dfn>:</p>

<p>
<code>print</code>
<code>(</code>
<code>num(420)</code>
<code>)</code>
<code>;</code>
</p>

<p>Following the phrase syntax, we can uncover the underlying <dfn>parse tree</dfn>:</p>

<p><img src="https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/images/420parsetree.png" alt="420parsetree.png"></p>
<p>A very important thing to note: <strong>The frontier of the parse tree is the token stream</strong>.</p>

<p><b>Exercise</b>: Repeat this phrase to yourself five times: The frontier of the parse tree is the token stream.
</p>
<blockquote><b>The parse tree ends at tokens, not characters</b><p>Please take the time to consider how silly it would be if the parse tree expanded all of the lexical rules down to characters. Having the parse tree stop at tokens is a good example of what we would call “breaking a complex problem down into simpler parts.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Another term for “parse tree” is <dfn>concrete syntax tree</dfn> (CST).</p>

<h4>Ambiguity</h4>

<p>How are we doing so far? We are able to distinguish well-structured Astro programs from all other Unicode strings. But there are some things we haven’t dealt with yet. For one, we have some strings with multiple structural forms. For example, the phrase <code>9-3*7</code> can be <dfn>parsed</dfn> in two ways:</p>

<p><img src="https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/images/ambiguity.png" alt="ambiguity.png"></p>
<p>Having more than one parse tree for a given input string means that our syntax description is <dfn>ambiguous</dfn>. It’s possible to handle this particular kind of ambiguity in the syntax. Here’s how.</p>

<h4>Precedence</h4>
    
<p>We can create rules that force certain operators to be applied before others; that is, the <dfn>precedence</dfn> of operators can be enforced in our syntax definition. To do so, we define additional syntactic categories. We say:</p>

<ul>
  <li>An expression is a sequence of one or more <dfn>terms</dfn>, separated by additive operators.</li>
  <li>A term is a sequence of one or more <dfn>factors</dfn>, separated by multiplicative operators.</li>
  <li>A factor is made up of <dfn>primaries</dfn>, separated by exponentiation operators, or a factor can just be a negated primary.</li>
  <li>A primary is the most basic expression possible: either a simple identfier, a numeral, a call, or a parenthesized expression. Parentheses allow unlimited nesting.</li>
</ul>

<p>So let’s revise our syntax specification:</p>

<pre>Exp         = Term ( ("+" | "-") Term )*
Term        = Factor ( ("*" | "/" | "%") Factor )*
Factor      = Primary ( "**" Primary )*
            | "-" Primary
Primary     = numeral | id | id "(" (Exp ("," Exp)*)? ")" | "(" Exp ")"
</pre>

<p>Great! Now there is one and only one parse tree for that previously problematic expression:</p>

<p><img src="https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/images/nonambiguity.png" alt="nonambiguity.png"></p>
<p>Note that the new syntax has forced the binary operators into a precedence hierarchy!</p>
<ul>
<li><code>+</code> and <code>-</code> have the lowest precedence.</li>
<li><code>*</code>, <code>/</code>, and <code>/</code> have the next higher precedence.</li>
<li><code>**</code> has the highest precedence.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, you can think of parenthesized expressions as being done before anything else, though we don’t usually think of these as operators.</p>

<p><b>Exercise</b>: Precedence is usually a concept that applies only to binary operators, but they way in which unary operators mix with binary operators does need to be addressed. For instance, how should<code>-3**2</code> be parsed? In Python exponentiation precedes negation, like <code>-(3**2)</code>. In Elm, negation precedes exponentiation, like <code>(-3)**2</code>. Astro follows JavaScript and simply does not allow this expression (forcing programmers to use parentheses in this case)! Show how this is done.
</p>
<p><b>Exercise</b>: Our specification does not allow <code>-3**2</code> as an expression, but it does allow <code>-3+2</code> and <code>-3*2</code>. Why did we care only enough to ensure negation did not mix with exponentiation, but we were fine with it mixing with addition and multiplication?
</p>
<h4>Associativity</h4>

<p>Wait, we are not done with structuring our operators just yet. The way things stand now, the parse tree for <code>3-8-5</code> looks pretty flat:</p>

<p><img src="https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/images/flatexpression.png" alt="flatexpression.png"></p>
<p>It doesn’t suggest whether we mean to compute <code>(3-8)-5</code> (which would be -10) or <code>3-(8-5)</code> (which would be 0). We can give a syntax that makes this clear. In our design, let’s make the additive and multiplicative operators <dfn>left-associative</dfn> and the exponentiation operator <dfn>right-associative</dfn>:</p>

<pre>Exp         = Exp ("+" | "-") Term
            | Term
Term        = Term ("*" | "/" | "%") Factor
            | Factor
Factor      = Primary "**" Factor
            | "-" Primary
            | Primary
</pre>

<p>How the heck does this work? Study these parse trees, and hopefully the insight will come to you! (Hint: remember the syntax is <em>designed</em> to force the tree to “come out” a certain way.</p>

<p><img src="https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/images/associativity.png" alt="associativity.png"></p>
<p><b>Exercise</b>: Study this until you understand it well.
</p>
<h4>Grammars</h4>

<p>The notation we’ve been using to precisely describe our syntax is a kind of a <dfn>grammar</dfn>. In fact, it is very close to a specific kind of grammar called an <dfn>Ohm Grammar</dfn>. Ohm requires a bit more ceremony than what we’ve been using so far. We’ll just jump right in and extend our work so far to a complete and working Ohm grammar:</p>

<p><span>astro.ohm</span></p><pre><code>Astro {
  Program     = Statement+
  Statement   = id "=" Exp ";"                         --assignment
              | print Exp ";"                          --print
  Exp         = Exp ("+" | "-") Term                   --binary
              | Term
  Term        = Term ("*" | "/" | "%") Factor          --binary
              | Factor
  Factor      = Primary "**" Factor                    --binary
              | "-" Primary                            --negation
              | Primary
  Primary     = id "(" ListOf&lt;Exp, ","&gt; ")"            --call
              | numeral                                --num
              | id                                     --id
              | "(" Exp ")"                            --parens

  numeral     = digit+ ("." digit+)? (("E" | "e") ("+" | "-")? digit+)?
  print       = "print" ~idchar
  idchar      = letter | digit | "_"
  id          = ~print letter idchar*
  space      += "//" (~"\n" any)*                      --comment
}

<p>When you are <strong>designing</strong> your language, you will build up your grammar iteratively, from increasingly more complex examples, and test the grammar as you go.

This is an amazing tool for <a href="http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~todd/theses/warth_dissertation.pdf">experimenting with programming languages</a>.</p>

The right panel is an interactive concrete syntax tree for the currently selected test case.</p>
  
<p>This tool will save you a lot of time.</p>
  
<p>It is an essential component of your language design toolbox.</p>

<blockquote><strong>How essential is it?</strong><p>Unless your language is trivial, tools like the Ohm Editor are very important!

<h3>Defining the Statics</h3>

<p>Question: Does the grammar we defined above for Astro capture the following (desirable) rule:</p>

<p>“You can only use an identifier if it has been previously assigned to.”</p>

<p>Answer: It does not.</p>

<p><b>Exercise</b>: Show that it does not. Hint: Is <code>print x;</code> a legal program according to the grammar?
</p>
<p><b>Exercise</b>: Show how to capture the rule in a grammar. Hint: Do not be frustrated if you cannot.
</p>
<p>Enforcing this rule requires knowledge of <dfn>context</dfn>. That is, the syntactic rule for producing expressions such as calls and arithmetic operations would need to somehow know which identifiers appeared on the left hand side of some previous assignment statement. This turns out to be so hard that even designers of real programming languages omit enforcement of contextual rules from the grammar! In fact, while the official grammar for Java will not derive this program:</p>

<pre><code>class A {2 / == {{;
</code></pre>
<p>and report a <dfn>syntax error</dfn>, a Java compiler will say that this program:</p>

<pre><code>class A {int x = y;}
</code></pre>
<p><em>is</em> structurally well formed according to the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se21/html/jls-19.html">official syntax of the Java language</a>! The compilation unit consists of a type declaration that is a class declaration whose body consists of a field declaration with a type, a name, and an initializing expression which is an identifier. But we know this program is not legal, since the identifier <var>y</var> has not been declared. It’s not only Java that has grammars overspecifying things: pretty much every programming language uses a grammar to define structural rules only, and specifies contextual rules in prose, or in a separate semantic definition.</p>

<p>For Astro, we will “define” the following contextual rules:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The following identifiers are built-in:
    <ul>
      <li><code>π</code>, a number</li>
      <li><code>sqrt</code>, a function of exactly one argument</li>
      <li><code>sin</code>, a function of exactly one argument</li>
      <li><code>cos</code>, a function of exactly one argument</li>
      <li><code>hypot</code>, a function of exactly two arguments</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>An identifier cannot be used in an expression unless it is one of the built-in identifiers or has been previously assigned to.</li>
  <li>All function calls must accept the proper number of arguments.</li>
  <li>The built-in identifiers cannot be assigned to.</li>
  <li>Identifiers declared as functions can only be called, not used in any other context. Identifiers declared as numbers cannot be called.</li>
</ol>

<p>For more complex languages, the statics definition (contextual rules) can be quite large. Here are some things that might appear:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Identifiers have to be declared before they are used.
  </li><li>Identifiers may not be used in a place where they may have not yet been initialized.
  </li><li>Identifier declarations must be unique within a scope, unless a language provides overloading.
  </li><li>All expressions must be used according to their type.</li>
  <li>Identifiers must be used according to (1) their <b>scope</b>, (2) their <b>access modifiers</b> (private, protected, package, public, whitelist, blacklist, ...), and (3) any other meta-level attributes (enumerable, configurable, writable, deletable, callable, ...).
  </li><li>Arguments must match up with parameters in terms of number, order, name, mode, and type.
  </li><li><code>break</code> and <code>continue</code> statements may only appear in a loop. <code>return</code> statements may only appear in a function it’s <em>possible</em> to encode these restrictions in the grammar, but it would be ugly).
  </li><li>All paths through a function must have a return.
  </li><li>All possible matches in a pattern match expression, or a switch statement, must be covered.
  </li><li>When inheriting from a base class with abstract methods, or implementing an interface, all abstract methods must be implemented, or the derived class must be declared abstract.
  </li><li>All declared local variables must be subsequently read, and declared private functions must be called.
</li></ul>
  
<h3>Defining the Dynamics</h3>

<p>The dynamics for most programming languages are given in prose. If you language is simple enough, a formal semantic definition is possible. For the sample languages in this course, Astro and Bella are given both informal and formal semantic definitions. We’ll not be studying formal semantics at this time, but feel free to study the definitions on your own.</p>

<h2>Prototyping</h2>

<p>During your language design, you will want to whip up a simple interpreter to at the very least make sure your design is reasonable. You may wish to developer your interpreter in parallel with your language design.</p>

<p>Ohm was designed for prototyping programming languages, so it is a natural choice. The Ohm Editor, as we just saw, helps you design the syntax. To write an actual interpreter, we’ll have to go much deeper into Ohm. We’ll be doing this in our next unit of study in this course, which is, indeed, a deep study of <a href="https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/introohm/">Ohm</a>.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>Many well-known programming languages have published, formal definitions. You can find them by searching the web.</p>

<p>For this class, we will be studying five little languages crafted especially to help you in your stufy of language design and implementation. We will be studying them in order, building upon previous languages and learning new things as we progress. This will allow us to introduce the huge topic of language processing in a practical setting, writing real compilers for real languages. The languages are Astro, Bella, Carlos, Dax, and Ekko.</p>

<h3>Astro</h3>
<p><img src="https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/images/astrologo.png" alt="Astro logo" height="160"></p><p>We all begin as a white belt in every new endeavor. We will start, then, with a very simple, almost trivial, language. All it has are numbers, arithmetic operators, variables, and a few pre-defined constants and functions. Here’s an example program:</p>

<pre>// A simple program in Astro
rAd1uS = 55.2 * (-cos(2.8E-20) + 89) % 21;
the_area = π * rAd1uS ** 2;
print(hypot(2.28, 3 - rAd1uS) / the_area);    // woohoo 👻
</pre>

<p>There are only two kinds of statements: assignments and print statements. Expressions include numbers, variables, function calls, arithmetic expressions with <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>*</code>, <code>/</code>, <code>%</code>, and <code>**</code>, and can be parenthesized. We will cover the <a href="https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/astro/">official definition of the language</a>, and use the language to motivate a formal study of syntax.</p>

<p>When studying this language, we’ll learn about the separation of context-free syntax from contextual rules. Contextual rules include such things as: having to match the number of arguments in a call with the number of defined parameters, rudimentary type checking, and not allowing assignments to read-only variables.</p>

<p>As Astro will be our first language, we will use it as a case study to learn the amazing <a href="https://ohmjs.org/">Ohm Language Library</a> to build an <a href="https://github.com/rtoal/astro-interpreter">interpreter</a>. The details of how the interpreter is constructed are covered in the <a href="https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/introohm/">course notes on Ohm</a>.</p>

<h3>Bella</h3>
<p><img src="https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/images/bellalogo.png" alt="Bella logo" height="128"></p><p>Our second language has a few things Astro does not: a richer set of operators, variable declarations, and user-defined functions. The contextual rules for Bella are much richer than that of Astro, since we now have actual declarations, and scope! Here’s an example program:</p>

<pre>let dozen = 12;
print dozen % 3 ** 1;
function gcd(x, y) = y == 0 ? x : gcd(y, x % y);
while dozen &gt;= 3 || (gcd(1, 10) != 5) {
  dozen = dozen - 2.75E+19 ** 1 ** 3;
}
</pre>

<p>We will first look at the <a href="https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/bella/">official specification</a>, introducing all sorts of interesting concepts. Then we’ll study a real, actual <a href="https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/bellacompiler/">Bella compiler</a>. Here we learn about designing and architecting a compiler, building the components (analyzer, optimizer, and generator), and getting 100% test coverage. The compiler source code is on <a href="https://github.com/rtoal/bella">GitHub</a>.</p>

<h3>Carlos</h3>
<p><img src="https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/images/carlos-logo.png" alt="Carlos logo"></p><p>In our third language, we encounter arrays, structs, and optionals: our first language that is basically useful. If you are taking the compiler course for which these notes were written, Carlos is a good example of the minimal language complexity you will need for your term project.</p>

<pre>const languageName = "Carlos";

function greeting() {
  return random(["Welcome", "こんにちは", "Bienvenido"]);
}

print("👋👋👋");
repeat 5 {
  print(greeting() + " " + languageName);
}
</pre>

<p>We’ll be visiting the language’s <a href="https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/carlos/">official specification</a> and a <a href="https://github.com/rtoal/carlos-lang">compiler on GitHub</a>. The compiler (of course!) uses the Ohm Language Library.</p>
<p>There’s no separate page of notes describing the compiler. After studying the Astro and Bella compilers, you’ll be able to find your way around the code on GitHub (there’s documentation). And don’t worry, it’s development and usage will be covered in class, and the teaching staff can help you with any questions you might have.</p>

<h3>Dax</h3>
<p><img src="https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/images/daxlogo.png" alt="Dax logo" height="180"></p><p>Language number four is a functional language, that is, a language with no assignments! The only bindings of names to entities happens when passing arguments to parameters, though there is that famous <code>let</code> declaration which nicely sugars a function call: it’s nicer to say <code>let x = 5 in x * y end</code> than <code>{x =&gt; x * y}(5)</code>.</p>

<p>Here’s a sample program to get the feel for the language:</p>

<pre>let
  gcd = {x =&gt; {y ==&gt; y == 0 ? x : gcd y (x % y)}};
  z = 5
in
  [1, 3, z] |&gt; filter {x =&gt; x &gt; 2} |&gt; map {x =&gt; x ** 2} |&gt; print
  then
  "hello" |&gt; substring 2 5 |&gt; print
  then
  print (gcd 33 99)   // This is fine, you don't HAVE to use |&gt;
end
</pre>

<p>If you have not yet seen languages with the awesome <code>|&gt;</code> operator, here’s your chance to be wowed.</p>

<p>We will discuss the <a href="https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/dax/">language design</a> and <a href="https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/daxcompiler/">compiler</a> later in the course.</p>

<h3>Ekko</h3>
<p><img src="https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/images/ekkologo.png" alt="Ekko logo" height="160"></p><p>Our fifth language, Ekko (starting with E like Erlang and Elixir, which greatly influence it), is a kind of experimental language that deals quite a lot with <strong>time</strong>.</p>

<p>Ekko mixes styles of asynchronous programming from JavaScript and the distributed process-orientation of Erlang and Elixir: Ekko’s <code>future</code> objects are based on JS promises, and its processes communicate via messages as in Erlang. There’s also quite a bit more temporal goodness, including timeout calls, value histories with time travel (influenced by older versions of Elm), and even explicit parallelism.</p>

<h2>More Examples</h2>

<p>Students in previous iterations of the course have designed and implemented their own languages. Here’s a sampling of language over the past decade or so. (Please note that there is a very wide variety of quality in these examples. They are presented here without any evaluative commentary as to whether they are suitable building blocks for one’s own project.)</p>

<li>What were the four big ideas in programming languages mentioned in Bret Victor’s <em>Future of Programming</em> talk? <p>(1) Direct manipulation of data rather than showing the code, (2) Goals and constraints rather than procedures, (3) Spatial representation of code rather than textual representations, and (4) Concurrent computation rather than sequential</p>
</li><li>What language did Alan Kay feature in his Programming Languages video? <p>eToys</p></li>
<li>What are some things to decide upon while undertaking language design? <p>The audience, the purpose, the scope, the problem domain it is target to, whether it is reasonable or esoteric, whether it has a simple foundation or favors pragmatism, its concurrency model.</p></li>
<li>In what essay did Bret Victor lay out several principles that languages and programming enviroments should follow to aid their users’ learning? <p>Learnable Programming</p></li>

<li>What is syntactic sugar? <p>Syntax within a programming language that is designed to make certain phrases more clear, concise, or elegant than the basic forms defined in the language.</p></li>
<li>What is syntactic salt? <p>Syntax within a programming language that is designed to make certain phrases more confusing, verbose, or awkward than the basic forms defined in the language.</p></li>
<li>What is a candygrammar? <p>A syntax that looks sweet and natural language-like that appears good but turns out to be bad for you.</p></li>
<li>What is a golfing language? <p>A language designed to be as terse as possible, often for the purpose of helping you win shortest-possible code challenges.</p></li>
<li>What are some examples of golfing languages? <p>CJam, Pyth, Stax, GolfScript, 05Ab1E</p></li>
<li>What are three styles of programming language definition? <p>Informal, formal, and executable</p></li>
<li>What is the difference between syntax and semantics? <p>Syntax deals with program structure. Semantics deals with program meaning.</p></li>
<li>What is the difference between a language’s <strong>statics</strong> and its <strong>dynamics</strong>? <p>Statics refers to the rules that can be checked at compile time. Dynamics refers to the rules that can only be checked at run-time.</p></li>
<li>What are syntax definitions generally split into lexical and phrase syntaxes? <p>Lexical syntax defines how invidividual characters are grouped in to words (tokens), while phrase syntax defines how these tokens are combined to form larger structures.</p></li>
<li>What is a parse tree? <p>A tree that describes the syntactic structure of a program as defined by the language’s syntax.</p></li>

Heavy, hard to run, resource-hungry, and complex, Loki and Prometheus were the perfect fit back then.</p><p>So I created a <code>docker-compose.yaml</code> with Loki, Prometheus and Grafana. Since they all had the internal Docker network, we required no auth between them. Grafana was only exposed over an SSH tunnel. One static scrape config and the Docker Loki log plugin later, we had our observability stack. For non-Docker logs, we used Promtail. Loki and Prometheus stayed on the same machine and all we required was a local volume mount. Load was minimal.</p><blockquote><p>ℹ️ This is when I learned that you should not transform every log parameter to an label just to make it easier to select in the Grafana UI. Having a label for latency with basically limitless values will fill every disks inodes, thats just how Cortex bin-packs.</p></blockquote><p>I also found out Grafana Labs has a cloud offering with a nice free tier. So I even used this for personal stuff. I had a good experience with them.</p><p>Time goes on, and I switched jobs. Now we have Kubernetes.<br> The Prometheus container was now switching nodes. Roming storage was a problem back then, and also our workload increased by a lot. We also needed long-term storage (13 months). So I looked around and found Thanos and Mimir.<br> Previous experiences with Grafana products were good, so I chose Mimir. Should be similar to Loki since both are based on Cortex. Now we didn’t really need Prometheus anymore. We were only using <code>remote_write</code> from Prometheus. Grafana had a solution for this. With the Grafana Agent, you can ship both logs and metrics to a remote location all in one binary. This seemed like a no-brainer.</p><p>Time goes on, and Grafana changed the Grafana Agent setup to Grafana Agent Flow Mode—some adjustments, but okay - software changes. And man, did Grafana like to change things.</p><p>They started to build their own observability platform to steal some of DataDogs customers. They created Grafana OnCall their own notification system. Not only that, but they heavily invested in Helm charts and general starter templates. Basically two commands to install the metric/log shippers and use Grafana Cloud. And even when you don’t want or can’t use Grafana Cloud, here are the Helm charts to install Mimir/Loki/Tempo. To make things even easier, let’s all put it in an umbrella chart (it renders to 6k lines in the default state). Or use their Grafana Operator to manage Grafana installs - or at least parts of it.</p><p>As many may have experienced, software maintenance shows with age.<br> Grafana OnCall is deprecated, and Grafana Agent and Agent Flow were deprecated within 2-3 years of their creation. Some of the <em>easy to use</em> Helm charts are not maintained anymore. They also deprecated Angular within Grafana and switched to React for dashboards. This broke most existing dashboards.</p><p>On the same day they deprecated the Grafana Agent, they announced Grafana Alloy. The all in one replacement. It can do Logs, Metrics, Traces (zipkin &amp; jaeger) and OTEL. The solution for everything!<br> The solution kind of had a rough start and was a <em>little</em> buggy. But it got better over time. The Alloy Operator also entered the game because why not.</p><blockquote><p>ℹ️ They choose to use their own configuration language for alloy. Something that looks like HCL. I can understand why thy didn’t want to use YAML but I’m still not a fan of this. Not everything needs their own DSL.</p></blockquote><p>Happy End, right? &nbsp;- Not quite<br> The all-in-one solution does not support everything. While Grafana built their own monitoring empire, the kube-prometheus community consistently and naturally developed. The Prometheus Operator with <code>ServiceMonitor</code> and <code>PodMonitor</code> CRDs became the defacto standards. So Alloy also supports the <code>monitoring.coreos.com</code> api-group CRDs, at least some parts of it. It natively works with <code>ServiceMonitor</code> and <code>PodMonitor</code>, but <code>PrometheusRules</code> needs extra configuration. The <code>AlertmanagerConfig</code> which would need to be implemented in Mimir is not supported. Because Mimir brings its own Alertmanager - at least sort of. There are version differences and small incompatibilities. &nbsp;</p><p>But I got it all working; now I can finally stop explaining to my boss why we need to re-structure the monitoring stack every year.</p><p>Grafana just released Mimir 3.0. They re-architected the ingestion logic for scalability, and now they use a message broker. Yes, Mimir in version 3.0 needs Apache Kafka to work.<br> None of the above things alone would be a reason to ditch Grafana products. Set aside the fact that they made it incredibly difficult now to find the ingestion endpoints for Grafana Cloud since they want to push users to use their new fleet-config management service. But all this together makes me uncomfortable recommending Grafana stuff.<br> I just don’t know what will change next.</p><p>I want stability for my monitoring; I want it boring, and that’s something Grafana is not offering. &nbsp; It seems like the pace within Grafana is way too fast for many companies, and I know for a fact that that pace is partially driven by career-driven development. There are some smart people at Grafana but not every customer is smart nor has the capacity to make Grafana their priority number one. Complexity kills - we’ve seen this.</p><blockquote><p>ℹ️ Don’t get me wrong. Mimir, Loki and Grafana are technically really good software products and I (mostly) still like them but it’s the way these products are managed which makes me question them.</p></blockquote><p>Sometimes I wonder how I would see this if I had chosen the ELK stack at my first job. I also wonder if the OpenShift approach (kube-prometheus-stack) with Thanos for long-term storage is the most time-stable solution. &nbsp; I just hope OTEL settles, gets stable and boring fast, and just lets me pick whatever I want for my backend. Because right now I’m done with monitoring. I just want to support our application and do not want to revisit the monitoring setup every x weeks, because monitoring is a necessity—not the product. At least for most companies.</p></article></div>]]></description>

How do we lead AI developers to do what the hardware prefers?</p>
<p>AMD GPUs are now offering state-of-the-art speeds and feeds. However, this performance is locked away from AI workflows due to the <a href="https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/blog/2025-11-09-hk">lack of mature AMD software</a>. We share HipKittens, an opinionated collection of programming primitives to help developers realize the hardware's capabilities: optimized register tiles, 8-wave and 4-wave kernel patterns instead of wave-specialization to schedule work within processors, and chiplet-optimized cache reuse patterns to schedule work across processors.</p>

<h3>What do AMD CDNA GPUs look like? A lay of the land.</h3>
<p>An AMD MI355X GPU has 256 processors called “compute units” (CUs) and a CU contains four SIMDs. A SIMD has different execution units. A 64-thread “wave” (contrasting a 32-thread warp on NVIDIA) occupies a single SIMD. We show the MI355X memory hierarchy below.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, making AMD GPUs go brr boils down to keeping the “matrix cores” (tensor cores on NVIDIA) fed. There are a few differences in how we think about this hardware:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>What it's not.</strong> An MI355X has 70% the SRAM of a B200 (165KB instead of 228KB), lacks asynchronous matrix multiplication instructions that operate on inputs in shared or tensor memory (wgmma, tcgen05), lacks register reallocation (the ability for some waves to give their registers to others), lacks tensor memory acceleration (dedicated hardware for global memory access), and lacks first class mbarrier primitives (for fine-grained synchronization).</li>
<li><strong>What it is.</strong> On the other hand, AMD GPUs have a 2x larger register file per processor than the B200 and offers 60% more processors per GPU (256 compute units versus 160 streaming multiprocessors). AMD offers tiny and fine-grained matrix core instructions, while NVIDIA tensor cores instructions are generally called with large input operands. AMD has a TMA-like direct global to shared memory loads via <span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mtext mathvariant="monospace">buffer_load_dword</mtext></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\verb|buffer_load_dword|</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span> instructions, which bypass the register file.</li>
<li><strong>Towards chiplet architectures.</strong> AMD is also leading the charge in the shift from monolithic grids to chiplets. AMD splits the 256 processors into 8 chiplets called “XCDs” of 32 CUs. NVIDIA B200s include 2 chips. The AMD cache is disaggregated: an AMD XCD has a private L2 cache and there is an extra last level cache (LLC) that sits between the L2 and HBM memory.</li>
</ol>

<figcaption><p>Table 1: <strong>Hardware overview.</strong> Peak memory and compute speeds for the latest generation GPU platforms.</p></figcaption>
<p>These differences impact the ways in which we design kernels on AMD.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Optimized memory access:</strong> Of course this matters on NVIDIA, but AMD’s layouts, HIPCC compiler limitations, and (undocumented) quirky behaviors of different I/O instructions yields new challenges.</li>
<li><strong>Scheduling within processors:</strong> We need to rely on our register file and small matrix core instructions instead of shared memory and bulky wgmma/tcgen05 instructions to establish deep pipelines and hide memory costs. Wave specialization / producer consumer, which reigns supreme in NVIDIA kernels, is not the right answer on AMD.</li>
<li><strong>Scheduling across processors:</strong> We need to start thinking about NUMA effects at the cache level as we schedule work across thread blocks.</li>
</ol>
<p>We walk through these three topics next.</p>
<h3>HipKittens memory access patterns</h3>
<p>As in <a href="https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/blog/2024-05-12-tk">ThunderKittens</a>, in HK, developers program using tiles as the basic data structure. Tiles exist in shared or register memory, and are parametrized by a data type, size dimensions (a multiple of the matrix core instruction shape), and layout. HK provides a library of PyTorch-like functions that operate on tiles, for instance <span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mtext mathvariant="monospace">exp</mtext></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\verb|exp|</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>, <span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mtext mathvariant="monospace">mma</mtext></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\verb|mma|</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>, <span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mtext mathvariant="monospace">sub</mtext></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\verb|sub|</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>, <span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mtext mathvariant="monospace">add</mtext></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\verb|add|</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>, <span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mtext mathvariant="monospace">row_max</mtext></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\verb|row_max|</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span> compute ops and load, store memory ops. A tile is collectively owned by threads in a wave (warp). The functions use template metaprogramming to generalize to different input tiles and are lightweight, directly wrapping assembly (PTX, CDNA ISA) and C++.</p>
<p>A memory layout determines how data elements map to thread ownership. A matrix core instruction expects a particular register layout depending on the data type and instruction shape. We also want to maximize the granularity and coalescing of global memory loads. Between registers and HBM, shared memory is split into banks (4-byte regions) that can serve data simultaneously. If threads from a wave request data from the same bank at the same time, their accesses are serialized; efficient kernels use “swizzle patterns” to organize data in a way that avoids these bank conflicts.</p>
<p>A few challenges for memory access in HK include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Register scheduling:</strong> A core tenant of HK and TK is to give developers full control over register allocation by remaining C++ embedded. Compilers like Triton prevent register management altogether, but surprisingly we find that even the HIPCC compiler imposes severe limitations (no wonder AMD uses raw assembly!).<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup> For instance, 4-wave (1-wave per SIMD) kernels compiled via HIPCC cannot use data held in certain types of registers as inputs to matrix instructions. This motivated us to add explicit register scheduling to HK, where developers pin specific registers when creating registers tiles, effectively replacing the compiler’s register management capabilities. Developers thus have the control necessary to write peak performance kernels!</li>
</ul>
<details><summary>Learn more about explicit register scheduling</summary><p>When a single wave is mapped per SIMD, the 512 registers are actually divided into 256 accumulator general purpose registers (AGPRs) and 256 vector general purpose registers (VGPRs). AGPRs have fundamental hardware limitations (e.g., vector arithmetic instructions cannot operate on them), but they can still crucially serve as the input or outputs for MFMA instructions. HIPCC, however, cannot generate code that uses AGPRs as input to MFMA instructions, leading to inefficient register management for register heavy workloads and redundant accvgpr_read/write instructions that move data between VGPRs and AGPRs.</p></details>
<ul>
<li><strong>Register layouts</strong>: NVIDIA tensor core layouts are regular – as we vary the data type or matrix shape, the layout is composed of an underlying “core matrix” structure. Thus, frameworks like TK and Gluon can apply a unified swizzling rule to avoid bank conflicts. However, AMD layouts differ significantly based on the data type and matrix shape. In fact, we show that it’s not possible to use a single swizzle pattern for all layouts. Further, sometimes we want to use multiple matrix shapes within the same kernel meaning that our swizzle pattern needs to be compatible with multiple types of layouts concurrently.</li>
</ul>
<figure><img src="https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/static/posts/2025-11-09-amd-brr/matrix.png"><figcaption><p>Figure: AMD register layouts for matrix instructions are less structured. NVIDIA layouts are all composed from an underlying core matrix structure.</p></figcaption></figure>
<ul>
<li><strong>Instruction phases:</strong> Waves (and NVIDIA warps) execute shared memory read/write instructions <a href="https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/how-to-understand-the-bank-conflict-of-shared-mem/260900">in phases</a>, where a subset of threads in the wave access shared memory concurrently. NVIDIA instructions sequentially assign threads to phases (e.g., threads 0-7 in phase one, 8-15 in phase two). However, the phase groups are both non-sequential and differ entirely based on AMD CDNA memory instruction. For example, we found that a <span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mtext mathvariant="monospace">ds_read_b128</mtext></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\verb|ds_read_b128|</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span> instruction reading 128 bits for each thread executes across 4 phases and has access to 64 banks. On the other hand, a <span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mtext mathvariant="monospace">ds_write_b64</mtext></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\verb|ds_write_b64|</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span> instruction writing 64 bits for each thread executes across 4 phases and has access to only 32 banks. This behavior is not well-documented even within AMD(! 😔), so we created and release solvers that reverse-engineer this behavior.</li>
</ul>
<details><summary>Learn why we can't use a single swizzle pattern for all AMD layouts.</summary><p>Proof by contradiction:</p><p>To show why a single swizzling pattern is insufficient across different register tile
shapes and layouts on AMD GPUs, consider the following two access patterns that surface in attention backwards:</p><ol>
<li>A row-layout 16x16 bf16 tile is written to shared memory. For this tile configuration, each thread holds 4 contiguous bf16 values - 64 bits in memory - and the most optimal instruction to issue this write is <span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mtext mathvariant="monospace">ds_write_b64</mtext></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\verb|ds_write_b64|</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>. Avoiding bank conflicts for this access requires a swizzle pattern that respects the phase ordering and bank behavior previously mentioned. In this case, a swizzle that abides by these constraints is computed as <span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">o</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">f</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">f</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">s</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">e</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">t</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathrm{offset}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span> ^ <span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo>=</mo><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">o</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">f</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">f</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">s</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">e</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">t</mi></mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">%</mi><mn>512</mn><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>&gt;</mo><mo>&gt;</mo><mn>7</mn><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>&lt;</mo><mo>&lt;</mo><mn>3</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">= ((\mathrm{offset} \% 512) &gt;&gt; 7) &lt;&lt; 3</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>, where 64-bit chunks of memory is shifted around memory using an XOR swizzle.</li>
<li>A row-layout 16x32 bf16 tile is read from shared memory. For this tile, each thread holds 8 contiguous bf16 values - 128 bits in memory - and the most optimal instruction to issue this read is <span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mtext mathvariant="monospace">ds_read_b128</mtext></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\verb|ds_read_b128|</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>.</li>
</ol><p>Regardless of the swizzling pattern required for <span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mtext mathvariant="monospace">ds_read_b128</mtext></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\verb|ds_read_b128|</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>, the granularities of these two instructions are in conflict with each other. <span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mtext mathvariant="monospace">ds_read_b128</mtext></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\verb|ds_read_b128|</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span> requires at least 128 bits of memory to be contiguous in shared memory, and the swizzle pattern for <span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mtext mathvariant="monospace">ds_write_b64</mtext></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\verb|ds_write_b64|</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span> breaks apart memory into 64-bit chunks. As a result, different swizzling patterns need to be used for each.</p></details>
<ul>
<li><strong>Address generation:</strong> AMD GPUs support direct asynchronous HBM to shared memory loads. Like TMA, these loads bypass the register file. The instruction takes as input per-thread addresses in HBM from which each thread will read data. While DSLs like TK directly swizzle the shared memory addresses, swizzling shared memory on AMD is instead accomplished by swizzling on the HBM addresses.</li>
</ul>
<p>We provide developers with optimized tile layouts and memory access patterns by default within HK. Checkout our paper to learn more about how we implement solutions to the above challenges.</p>
<h3>HipKittens schedules within a processor</h3>
<p>Ideally we would have simple, reusable patterns for scheduling the compute and memory within kernels that generalize across AI workloads. Wave specialization / producer consumer serves this purpose on NVIDIA, but what about on AMD?</p>
<p><strong>Wave specialization struggles on AMD.</strong> Wave specialization is the dominant paradigm for achieving high occupancy on modern NVIDIA GPUs. Producer waves focus on memory movement while consumer waves focus on computation. This strategy underpins today’s state-of-the-art AI kernels—including <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08608">FlashAttention-3</a>, <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=fGgQS5VW09">COMET for MOE models</a>, and <a href="https://research.colfax-intl.com/nvidia-hopper-gemm-cutlass/">high-performance GEMMs</a> —as well as kernel DSLs such as <a href="https://github.com/HazyResearch/ThunderKittens/blob/main/kernels/matmul/H100/matmul.cu">ThunderKittens LSCF</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17577">TileLang</a>.</p>
<p>But, we show that wave specialization underperforms on AMD due to the lack of register reallocation. On the MI355X, registers are statically divided across all waves. Producer waves that only need a few registers for address calculation are allocated more registers than they need; consumer waves cannot recoup those registers and must either spill registers to scratch memory or run at a lower arithmetic intensity. Both are disastrous for performance. Wave specialization limits the output tile size and makes our kernels more memory bound.  For GEMMs, data loaded from memory is O(MK + NK) while compute is O(MNK). Decreasing the M or N in our per thread block output tile size lowers arithmetic intensity.

The CUTLASS GEMM is selected and tuned using the CUTLASS profiler tool on a B200 GPU.</p></figcaption>
<p>As an aside, it might be surprising that AMD matches NVIDIA GEMM performance without all the bells and whistles of wgmma/tma, producer consumer, TMA, mbarriers, large shared memory for deep multi-stage pipelining etc. But… AMD has a <span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>×</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">2\times</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span> larger register file and AMD’s smaller tensor core shapes (e.g., <span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>16</mn><mo>×</mo><mn>16</mn><mo>×</mo><mn>32</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">16\times16\times32</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>) provide an alternative path to establish deep pipelines by using finer-granularity load and compute stages.</p>
<p>Scheduling patterns for AMD. Our attempt to use wave specialization - a strategy that works well on NVIDIA GPUs - did not yield the expected speedups on AMD hardware. All is not lost! We found two scheduling patterns that consistently yield high occupancy AMD GPUs, while using tile programming primitives (no raw assembly)!</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>8-wave ping-pong:</strong> We assign two waves per SIMD and at any given time, one is executing a cluster of memory instructions while the other wave executes a cluster of compute instructions. The waves swap at the end of cluster execution. With this approach, the developer can use large HK tiles since a thread issues many of the same instructions at once!</li>
<li><strong>4-wave interleave:</strong> We assign one wave per SIMD and threads in this wave finely switch between issuing memory and compute operations. Here, the developer uses small HK tiles (essentially matching the size of the matrix core instruction shape) to achieve the fine-grained schedule.</li>
</ol>
<p>These two patterns tradeoff programmability and performance, where 8-wave and its large tile primitives lead to compact code and 4-wave fine-grained interleaving expands code size. Surprisingly, the 8-wave schedule is sufficient to achieve SoTA-level performance on GEMMs and attention forwards. For GQA non-causal attention backwards, 8-wave also outperforms all AMD baselines by <span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>1.8</mn><mo>×</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">1.8\times</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>, and our HK 4-wave further outperforms by <span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>2.3</mn><mo>×</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">2.3\times</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>.</p>

<h3>HipKittens schedules across processors</h3>
<p>Modern GPUs are moving toward chiplet-based architectures, shifting away from traditional monolithic dies. AMD’s MI355X, for instance, integrates eight chiplets (XCDs), each with its own L2 cache, while NVIDIA’s B200 pairs two dies together. This shift enables higher scalability and yield but introduces a new performance challenge: disaggregated memory hierarchies. Each cluster of compute units now has local caches, and memory locality is no longer uniform across the chip.</p>
<p>On AMD GPUs, thread blocks are scheduled to chiplets in a round-robin fashion, meaning that the order in which blocks are launched—the grid schedule—directly affects how effectively data is reused in cache. Even perfectly tuned kernels can lose bandwidth if their grid layout is cache-unfriendly.</p>

Further, optimizing purely for L2 locality can cause each XCD to fetch disjoint portions of A and B, leading to redundant loads at the next cache level.</p>
<p>To address this, HipKittens introduces a chiplet-aware scheduling strategy that reorganizes the grid launch order to better exploit locality at both the L2 (per-chiplet) and LLC (shared) cache levels for GEMM workloads. The key idea is to group thread blocks that operate on nearby regions of the output matrix so that they naturally reuse overlapping tiles of input data across cache hierarchies.</p>
<h3>Putting it all together</h3>
<p>Let's take a look at a few kernels written in HK.</p>

We can see that the kernel uses HK's 8-wave ping pong schedule where waves alternate between compute instruction clusters and memory clusters.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="2">
<li>Here's the core hot loop structure for our BF16 GEMM kernel. Again, we can see that waves alternate between compute clusters and memory clusters using HK's 8-wave ping pong schedule.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Multi-silicon AI is coming!</h3>
<p>HipKittens delivers competitive performance on AMD CDNA3 and CDNA4 through three key insights: optimized memory access, AMD-centric wave scheduling patterns within a processor, and chiplet-aware grid scheduling across processors to exploits AMD's disaggregated cache hierarchy. Our kernels consistently achieve peak performance amongst AMD baselines across workloads (and compete with peak Blackwell kernels as well).</p>
<p>Realizing AI's full potential requires diverse, open hardware.<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup> Today, that means making AMD GPUs truly accessible.</p>
<p>We want more AI in the world. AI has relied on and innovated on a single hardware provider, but we need to be able to use and experiment with all the compute we can. We need to be able to use the fastest hardware out there. We’re happy to help address these problems with HipKittens!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>This past Monday, November 10th, we celebrated the 16th anniversary of Go’s
<a href="https://opensource.googleblog.com/2009/11/hey-ho-lets-go.html" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">open source
release</a>!</p>
<p>We released <a href="https://go.dev/blog/go1.24">Go 1.24 in February</a> and <a href="https://go.dev/blog/go1.25">Go 1.25 in
August</a>, following our now well-established and dependable release
cadence. Continuing our mission to build the most productive language platform
for building production systems, these releases included new APIs for building
robust and reliable software, significant advances in Go’s track record for
building secure software, and some serious under-the-hood improvements.
Meanwhile, no one can ignore the seismic shifts in our industry brought by
generative AI. The Go team is applying its thoughtful and uncompromising mindset
to the problems and opportunities of this dynamic space, working to bring Go’s
production-ready approach to building robust AI integrations, products, agents,
and infrastructure.</p>
<h2 id="core-language-and-library-improvements">Core language and library improvements</h2>
<p>First released in Go 1.24 as an experiment and then graduated in Go 1.25, the
new <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/testing/synctest" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>testing/synctest</code></a> package
significantly simplifies writing tests for <a href="https://go.dev/blog/testing-time">concurrent, asynchronous
code</a>. Such code is particularly common in network services,
and is traditionally very hard to test well. The <code>synctest</code> package works by
virtualizing time itself. It takes tests that used to be slow, flaky, or both,
and makes them easy to rewrite into reliable and nearly instantaneous tests,
often with just a couple extra lines of code. It’s also a great example of Go’s
integrated approach to software development: behind an almost trivial API, the
<code>synctest</code> package hides a deep integration with the Go runtime and other parts
of the standard library.</p>
<p>This isn’t the only boost the <code>testing</code> package got over the past year. The new
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev/testing#B.Loop" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>testing.B.Loop</code></a> API is both easier to use
than the original <code>testing.B.N</code> API and addresses many of the traditional—and
often invisible!—<a href="https://go.dev/blog/testing-b-loop">pitfalls</a> of writing Go benchmarks. The
<code>testing</code> package also has new APIs that <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/testing#T.Context" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">make it easy to
cleanup</a> in tests that use
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev/context#Context" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>Context</code></a>, and that <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/testing#T.Output" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">make it
easy</a> to write to the test’s log.</p>
<p>Go and containerization grew up together and work great with each other. Go 1.25
launched <a href="https://go.dev/blog/container-aware-gomaxprocs">container-aware scheduling</a>, making
this pairing even stronger. Without developers having to lift a finger, this
transparently adjusts the parallelism of Go workloads running in containers,
preventing CPU throttling that can impact tail latency and improving Go’s
out-of-the-box production-readiness.</p>
<p>Go 1.25’s new <a href="https://go.dev/blog/flight-recorder">flight recorder</a> builds on our already
powerful execution tracer, enabling deep insights into the dynamic behavior of
production systems. While the execution tracer generally collected <em>too much</em>
information to be practical in long-running production services, the flight
recorder is like a little time machine, allowing a service to snapshot recent
events in great detail <em>after</em> something has gone wrong.</p>
<h2 id="secure-software-development">Secure software development</h2>
<p>Go continues to strengthen its commitment to secure software development, making
significant strides in its native cryptography packages and evolving its
standard library for enhanced safety.</p>
<p>Go ships with a full suite of native cryptography packages in the standard
library, which reached two major milestones over the past year. A security
audit conducted by independent security firm <a href="https://www.trailofbits.com/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Trail of
Bits</a> yielded <a href="https://go.dev/blog/tob-crypto-audit">excellent
results</a>, with only a single low-severity finding.
Furthermore, through a collaborative effort between the Go Security Team and
<a href="https://geomys.org/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Geomys</a>, these packages achieved CAVP certification,
paving the way for <a href="https://go.dev/blog/fips140">full FIPS 140-3 certification</a>. This is a
vital development for Go users in certain regulated environments. FIPS 140
compliance, previously a source of friction due to the need for unsupported
solutions, will now be seamlessly integrated, addressing concerns related to
safety, developer experience, functionality, release velocity, and compliance.</p>
<p>The Go standard library has continued to evolve to be <em>safe by default</em> and
<em>safe by design</em>. For example, the <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/os#Root" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>os.Root</code></a>
API—added in Go 1.24—enables <a href="https://go.dev/blog/osroot">traversal-resistant file system
access</a>, effectively combating a class of vulnerabilities where an
attacker could manipulate programs into accessing files intended to be
inaccessible. Such vulnerabilities are notoriously challenging to address
without underlying platform and operating system support, and the new
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev/os#Root" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>os.Root</code></a> API offers a straightforward,
consistent, and portable solution.</p>
<h2 id="under-the-hood-improvements">Under-the-hood improvements</h2>
<p>In addition to user-visible changes, Go has made significant improvements under
the hood over the past year.</p>
<p>For Go 1.24, we completely <a href="https://go.dev/blog/swisstable">redesigned the <code>map</code>
implementation</a>, building on the latest and greatest ideas in
hash table design. This change is completely transparent, and brings significant
improvements to <code>map</code> performance, lower tail latency of <code>map</code> operations, and
in some cases even significant memory wins.</p>
<p>Go 1.25 includes an experimental and significant advancement in Go’s garbage
collector called <a href="https://go.dev/blog/greenteagc">Green Tea</a>. Green Tea reduces garbage
collection overhead in many applications by at least 10% and sometimes as much
as 40%. It uses a novel algorithm designed for the capabilities and constraints
of today’s hardware and opens up a new design space that we’re eagerly
exploring. For example, in the forthcoming Go 1.26 release, Green Tea will
achieve an additional 10% reduction in garbage collector overhead on hardware
that supports AVX-512 vector instructions—something that would have been nigh
impossible to take advantage of in the old algorithm. Green Tea will be enabled
by default in Go 1.26; users need only upgrade their Go version to benefit.</p>
<h2 id="furthering-the-software-development-stack">Furthering the software development stack</h2>
<p>Go is about far more than the language and standard library. It’s a software
development platform, and over the past year, we’ve also made four regular
releases of the <a href="https://go.dev/gopls">gopls language server</a>, and have formed partnerships to
support emerging new frameworks for agentic applications.</p>
<p>Gopls provides Go support to VS Code and other LSP-powered editors and IDEs.
Every release sees a litany of features and improvements to the experience of
reading and writing Go code (see the <a href="https://go.dev/gopls/release/v0.17.0">v0.17.0</a>,
<a href="https://go.dev/gopls/release/v0.18.0">v0.18.0</a>, <a href="https://go.dev/gopls/release/v0.19.0">v0.19.0</a>, and
<a href="https://go.dev/gopls/release/v0.20.0">v0.20.0</a> release notes for full details, or our new
<a href="https://go.dev/gopls/features">gopls feature documentation</a>!). Some highlights include many
new and enhanced analyzers to help developers write more idiomatic and robust Go
code; refactoring support for variable extraction, variable inlining, and JSON
struct tags; and an <a href="https://go.dev/gopls/features/mcp">experimental built-in server</a> for the
Model Context Protocol (MCP) that exposes a subset of gopls’ functionality to AI
assistants in the form of MCP tools.</p>
<p>With gopls v0.18.0, we began exploring <em>automatic code modernizers</em>. As Go
evolves, every release brings new capabilities and new idioms; new and better
ways to do things that Go programmers have been finding other ways to do. Go
stands by its <a href="https://go.dev/doc/go1compat">compatibility promise</a>—the old way will continue
to work in perpetuity—but nevertheless this creates a bifurcation between old
idioms and new idioms. Modernizers are static analysis tools that recognize old
idioms and suggest faster, more readable, more secure, more <em>modern</em>
replacements, and do so with push-button reliability. What <code>gofmt</code> did for
<a href="https://go.dev/blog/gofmt">stylistic consistency</a>, we hope modernizers can do for idiomatic
consistency. We’ve integrated modernizers as IDE suggestions, where they can
help developers not only maintain more consistent coding standards, but where we
believe they will help developers discover new features and keep up with the
state of the art. We believe modernizers can also help AI coding assistants keep
up with the state of the art and combat their proclivity to reinforce outdated
knowledge of the Go language, APIs, and idioms. The upcoming Go 1.26 release
will include a total overhaul of the long-dormant <code>go fix</code> command to make it
apply the full suite of modernizers in bulk, a return to its <a href="https://go.dev/blog/introducing-gofix">pre-Go 1.0
roots</a>.</p>
<p>At the end of September, in collaboration with
<a href="https://www.anthropic.com/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Anthropic</a> and the Go community, we released
<a href="https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/releases/tag/v1.0.0" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">v1.0.0</a> of
the <a href="https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">official Go SDK</a> for the
<a href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Model Context Protocol (MCP)</a>. This SDK
supports both MCP clients and MCP servers, and underpins the new MCP
functionality in gopls. Contributing this work in open source helps empower
other areas of the growing open source agentic ecosystem built around Go, such
as the recently released <a href="https://github.com/google/adk-go" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Agent Development Kit (ADK) for
Go</a> from <a href="https://www.google.com/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Google</a>.
ADK Go builds on the Go MCP SDK to provide an idiomatic framework for building
modular multi-agent applications and systems. The Go MCP SDK and ADK Go
demonstrate how Go’s unique strengths in concurrency, performance, and
reliability differentiate Go for production AI development and we are expecting
more AI workloads to be written in Go in the coming years.</p>
<h2 id="looking-ahead">Looking ahead</h2>
<p>Go has an exciting year ahead of it.</p>
<p>We’re working on advancing developer productivity through the brand new <code>go fix</code>
command, deeper support for AI coding assistants, and ongoing improvements to
gopls and VS Code Go. General availability of the Green Tea garbage collector,
native support for Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) hardware features,
and runtime and standard library support for writing code that scales even
better to massive multicore hardware will continue to align Go with modern
hardware and improve production efficiency. We’re focusing on Go’s “production
stack” libraries and diagnostics, including a massive (and long in the making)
<a href="https://go.dev/issue/71497">upgrade to <code>encoding/json</code></a>, driven by Joe Tsai and people across
the Go community; <a href="https://go.dev/design/74609-goroutine-leak-detection-gc">leaked goroutine
profiling</a>, contributed by
<a href="https://www.uber.com/us/en/about/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Uber’s</a> Programming Systems team; and many
other improvements to <code>net/http</code>, <code>unicode</code>, and other foundational packages.
We’re working to provide well-lit paths for building with Go and AI, evolving
the language platform with care for the evolving needs of today’s developers,
and building tools and capabilities that help both human developers and AI
assistants and systems alike.</p>
<p>On this 16th anniversary of Go’s open source release, we’re also looking to the
future of the Go open source project itself. From its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwoWei-GAPo" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">humble
beginnings</a>, Go has formed a
thriving contributor community. To continue to best meet the needs of our
ever-expanding user base, especially in a time of upheaval in the software
industry, we’re working on ways to better scale Go’s development
processes—without losing sight of Go’s fundamental principles—and more deeply
involve our wonderful contributor community.</p>
<p>Go would not be where it is today without our incredible user and contributor
communities. We wish you all the best in the coming year!</p>

  <p><strong>Granny won me over with the government cheese.</strong> As a child, maybe 4 or 5 years old, when I’d visit her on occasional Sundays in Blue Ridge, Georgia, she’d slice me off a little treat — an orange rectangle from a brown cardboard box in the refrigerator. We would sit around her kitchen table, where she held court with my aunts by telling stories and making plans for canning vegetables. Sometimes the aunts smoked cigarettes, which they’d quickly stamp out when my preacher-grandfather came around the corner. Nevermind that my snack was processed and inexpensive, a generic type of Velveeta. In those days at Granny’s, sitting with my cheese and the grown-ups in our rural mountain town, I might as well have been tasting Camembert on the banks of the Seine.&nbsp;</p><p>Nevermind, too, the Mason jars of homemade soup on her shelves, a kaleidoscope of summer’s bounty — tomatoes, okra, corn — put up and waiting to take the chill off colder days. Nevermind the freshly baked pound cakes under Tupperware domes like trophies, which she kept atop the washing machine, also in the kitchen, or the biscuits she could whip up with nary a measuring device or recipe. I would learn to appreciate all those later. As a kid, the cheese wowed me.&nbsp;</p><p>My mother tried to explain that it was a commodity provided by government funding for the school cafeteria where my grandmother worked. “Maybe you shouldn’t mention the cheese,” Mom said recently, when I told her about writing this story. She has a good point. Folks don’t like to hear the words <em>processed</em> and <em>school food</em> in the same sentence. And Mom wouldn’t want people to think Granny was somehow taking advantage of the system. But don’t worry, Mom. The cheese is part of the point. I want people to know how Granny believed in wasting nothing, in sharing everything. In cooking from scratch as often as possible but also making do with every resource provided to her. And, yes, she sometimes had leftover cheese at home, but she also got in trouble for sneaking extra food into the paper sacks of kids without lunch money or even handing food out the back of the lunchroom screen door. “Situational ethics,” my cousin Susie calls it. I’d come to understand all that later. But as a kid, I just knew Granny’s job was cool.&nbsp;</p>

            <p><strong>Beulah Culpepper, </strong>the writer’s grandmother, was married to Rev. Paul Culpepper and spent her early years at home in the Georgia mountains, taking care of their eight children. At age 43, she began her food service career at Blue Ridge Elementary where, for about three decades, she found a sort of ministry of her own — making sure kids were well fed.</p>

  <p>Beulah Culpepper started work as an assistant lunch lady at Blue Ridge Elementary School in 1950 at age 43. That’s after she’d had eight kids of her own, whom she raised by home cooking, pickling, canning, and keeping chickens. She married young, after a rough childhood. My grandparents held a small ceremony on the railroad tracks outside the textile plant where they’d met. My grandfather called her Sunshine. And, for the outsized proportion of his noggin, she called him Fathead. She never learned to drive, and she only had a third-grade education. But when my father, her youngest, started school, she decided she was going with him. “We walked to school together every morning,” Dad told me.&nbsp;</p><p>She worked her way to manager at the cafeteria, retiring in the early 1980s. Over the course of her tenure, her education level sometimes couldn’t keep up with her natural-born smarts, so she’d ask for my aunt’s help on the weekends to work out the financial parts of her menus. She became known for her vegetable soups, yeast rolls, and peanut butter cookies.</p><p>Mom remembers Granny’s frustration as, over time, guidelines and budgets added complicated layers to the work and hampered the scratch cooking she preferred. The government cheese went into big batches of creamy macaroni served alongside crisp, fried fish and scoops of turnip greens. She’d sneak in bacon grease from home to flavor green beans. Sadly, her own savory cornbread eventually gave way to a quicker and sweeter mix at school. My cousin Margaret remembers a student asking her: “Mrs. Culpepper, is this cornbread — or just bad cake?”</p><p>County employees would sometimes join the students for lunch as if she were running a restaurant. “She had a name county-wide for the meals she served,” says Gene Crawford, a columnist for the local newspaper who taught at the school in the 1970s.</p>

  <p>Dad remembers when the lunchroom was just an old clapboard structure with wooden floors. Students who brought their lunch, often because they couldn’t afford the cafeteria meal, sat on benches along the perimeter. Granny tried to be discreet in making sure those kids had plenty. “What have you got to eat today?” Dad remembers her asking, peeking into their bags and sometimes finding nothing but a leftover biscuit. “She would give them anything she could get her hands on,” he says. She left out extra bowls of grits and gravy or commodity foods for students to share. At least once, the principal scolded her for giving away food for free. “Do I make money for this lunchroom?” she asked him. <em>Yes.</em> “Do I lose money for this lunchroom?” <em>No.</em> “Well, don’t you ever get on to me again for giving those kids food,” my mother remembers Granny recounting. “No kid will ever leave this lunchroom hungry.”&nbsp;</p><p>But before we go too far: a warning. If you’re looking for a dreamy, idyllic grandma story where I stand at her elbow and learn recipes, this ain’t it. I somehow don’t have a single recipe from Granny, even if she was the best cook I’ve ever known. But I did learn plenty else from her and felt her love in different ways. I’d sometimes sit with her and her dogs Tico or George while she chewed tobacco and watched Braves games. I remember her feisty attitude, stout build, and strong hands. She would squeeze my upper arms every time I entered her kitchen and compliment me on weight gain (a confusing but comforting message for a teen girl). It took me years to realize how she’d influenced my life as a food writer.&nbsp;</p><p>In reflecting on her now, I wanted to check in with modern-day heroes of the school lunch line. Even as it feels like our social safety nets are crumbling, I see in these workers a sharp stewardship of resources, a special sort of hospitality, and — despite government red tape and political divides — a deep commitment to community care.</p>

  <p><strong>Stephanie Dillard at Enterprise City Schools in South Alabama likes to sit down for lunch with the kids and hear their thoughts on the food.</strong> She’s a longtime board member and newly elected president of the School Nutrition Association, a nonprofit organization of more than 50,000 lunch ladies (and fellas) and others interested in school nutrition. But day to day, you’ll find Dillard filling in for kitchen staff, crunching budget numbers, and working to get fresh, locally grown foods onto kids’ plates. Last year that meant satsumas from a neighboring county to serve with roasted chicken and broccoli. It meant local strawberries and even a special shrimp bowl with the region’s beloved Conecuh sausage.&nbsp;</p><p>“The greatest joy is just knowing that we are feeding children healthy meals. So many families rely on us daily,” Dillard says. “I just want to continue to see that all children have equal access to the meals.”&nbsp;</p><p>But Dillard is clear about the challenges. “Number one, we need more funding, so we can increase scratch cooking and more farm-to-school programs,” she says. “With the MAHA movement, they’re pushing, obviously, more scratch cooking, and that’s great and grand. I have no problem with less processed foods in schools, but we need the funding to be able to support it.”&nbsp;</p><p>To be sure, the stew of school food has long been mixed with politics and money. The National School Lunch Act, which passed in 1946, four years before my grandmother started cafeteria work, had its roots in an ecosystem of competing interests, says Marcus Weaver-Hightower, author of <em>Unpacking School Lunch: Understanding the Hidden Politics of School Food</em>. Over the years, politicians have argued over funding cuts, regulations, and what makes food healthy — along with who gets to set the menu.</p><p>Of late, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. seems to champion some of the healthier standards that conservatives once criticized, and partly rolled back, when the same ideas were espoused by then-First Lady Michelle Obama’s Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act campaign. (The opening lines of a 2014 Heritage Foundation article: “Michelle Obama thinks she knows what your children should eat.”)&nbsp;</p><p>Kennedy has advocated for healthier school food even as the Trump administration has cut millions in funding that would help make that possible, including eliminating the Local Food for Schools Cooperative Agreement Program and Patrick Leahy Farm to School Grants.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Samantha Goyret and Caroline Ideus, co-directors of the Northwest Tennessee Local Food Network, had a statewide farm-to-school plan ready to implement — at least until the funding was cut.&nbsp;</p><p>Goyret and Ideus, who produce a guide to local farmers and producers and manage a West Tennessee farmers market, began serving as vital liaisons between farmers and school nutrition directors several years ago. They knew both groups were overworked, with little time to make connections. Goyret and Ideus also helped arrange transportation and delivery. Local farmers earned market values for their products while schools amped up nutrition in ways that appealed to kids. “It’s like, <em>OK, we’re finally finding solutions to these problems</em>,” Goyret says. “Then the government’s like, <em>No, we’re not going to fund you anymore. So, good luck. Just try to figure it out on your own</em>.”&nbsp;</p><p>Lisa Seiber-Garland, school nutrition director for the Trenton Special School District in Trenton, Tennessee, says students loved items like local butter lettuce and purple hull peas obtained through a federal grant. She learned that at least one student convinced her mother to visit a nearby farm for the tender leaves she had tasted atop her school burger. “It was so cool,” Seiber-Garland says. “Grants like that provide access for kids to have things they wouldn’t normally have. With that grant, we were also able to provide fresh ground beef. … We’re still doing it, but not to the extent with the grant. It was such a blessing I didn’t want to stop. I told my farmers I will do what I can to still buy. One had planted his strawberries and his watermelons and everything to meet what we needed in the school for that year. And then we lost the grant.”&nbsp;</p><p>Goyret confirms that, indeed, seeds had been planted, orders had been placed. “With every administration, there’s always changes,” she says. “But what’s different about this administration is that they are taking away already allocated funds — funds allocated by the Congress. That should be 100 percent illegal.”&nbsp;</p><p>But, per usual, school nutrition directors are making do.</p>

  <p>Dillard says the federal funding cuts will hurt local farmers in Alabama, but her state offers rebates when she serves Alabama-grown foods. “They direct us and help me find the farmers that have the ability to grow enough for our district,” she says. “So I’m very lucky in that aspect. As soon as we find something new or new farmers willing to grow for us, we jump on that.”&nbsp;</p><p>Likewise, in Tennessee, Seiber-Garland works through a different grant specifically for elementary students to provide snacks of fresh fruit and vegetables paired with nutritional education. “The kids are the joy for sure. Watching them and their excitement when there’s something they really like,” she says, of offering students new tastes as well as standbys like peaches, grapes, berries, pepper strips, and carrots. A student’s mother came up to her at the cafeteria and said, “You’re the reason my daughter likes raspberries.”&nbsp;</p><p>In 2022, California became the first of a half dozen or so states to offer free school meals to all students, regardless of family income. Dillard supports free meals for all students with an emphatic, “Yes, yes, yes!” Food should not be based on income, she says: “It should be part of the school day. Your transportation is of no charge to students. School books are no charge to students. School lunch should be of no charge to students. … It’s just the right thing to do.”&nbsp;</p><p>Still, most schools must provide a mix of fee-based and subsidized free and reduced-price meals. Some communities with high percentages of families on SNAP and enrolled in Medicaid automatically qualify for the USDA’s Community Eligibility Provision, which authorizes free meals for all students in the district. But, as the “Big Beautiful Bill” slashes both SNAP and Medicaid, it will surely reverberate through school lunchrooms too. “It’s going to be a huge burden for a lot of families,” says Weaver-Hightower. “The number of problems I think [free lunches] would solve is a really long list. There’s paperwork, of course. And there’s the shame and stigma that some kids feel. Why would we do that to little 5-year-olds?”</p>

He left his prestigious role in 2015 to create Brigaid, a company now working with 40 school districts in eight states along with other institutions such as senior centers and prisons.&nbsp;</p><p>His team has adopted the pragmatic approach long espoused by the professionals in those settings. “We don’t say, <em>This is the food you should serve</em>, or, <em>You shouldn’t serve this food</em>,” he explains. “It is their program and it is their community. Who are we to come from the outside to tell them otherwise? So we come in and ask, <em>What are you trying to achieve with your program?</em>”</p><p>Giusti loves the puzzle — the dynamics and balance of nutrition and taste preference. “I was talking with a food service director, and she uses the statistic that roughly 70 percent of the calories students eat in her district come from the food in the schools. So you have a real responsibility to make sure that food is nutritious. But at the same point you also need to make sure kids want to eat it. … Kids need to eat. Period.”</p><p>Giusti stresses that policies need to be backed up with resources. “It’s amazing to talk about removing processed foods, cooking more from scratch. I have a business based off of that,” he says. “It’s also really hard to do. If we’re going to say to School District XYZ, <em>You can’t use these things anymore</em>, then I hope we’re also going to give them money to buy more equipment and train their staff.”</p><p>Furthermore, edicts need to take into account the people who have to implement them, Giusti stresses. “Folks who work in the kitchens get caught in the mix,” he says. “You can feel it on them. They’re just waiting for the next initiative. They’ve maybe been working in these schools for 20, 30 years, and they’ve seen so many initiatives come and go, come and go. They’ve seen people come and go. Superintendents come and go. But they’re still there. Doing this work every day.”</p>

  <p><strong>Similar to my grandmother, Hope North in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, started work at the cafeteria when her son entered school.</strong> She’s been in food service ever since, about 27 years. Long enough to see her grandson attend Murfreesboro City Schools, too.</p><p>On a recent summer day, she climbed onto a brightly painted old school bus with the words CHOW BUS across its front. Inside, the seats had been reconfigured into booths with tables. About 50 meals sat in cooler bags: penne pasta with tomato-meat sauce, a side of carrots, fruit cups, and milk. The bus was headed for Chariot Pointe Apartments, the first stop of about five that day.</p><p>“We meet people where they are,” says Tori Carr, a school employee who was driving a van that followed the bus, which had been converted into a sort of free book store. Its shelves also carry cleaning supplies, pantry items, and simple toys like glow sticks and coloring pages.</p><p>North’s cousin Keith Sneed drives the Chow Bus as well as regular bus routes during the school year. The two make a good team — tough and tender. They run their route every day in the summer heat, bus windows down. North keeps tabs on her people at each stop. She knows their stories and worries. And if they don’t show up for a few days, she’ll be on the case.</p><p>They’d hardly parked at their first location, when a young man in a yellow T-shirt approached the bus. Sneed poked his head out the window. “Man, go get a book!” he said. “You ain’t read a book all summer.” The boy couldn’t help but oblige. Book in hand, he got a fist bump from Sneed as he climbed up the steps for a meal.&nbsp;</p><p>“It’s not just about the food,” Sneed explained later. “All they want is for you to listen to them.” But, of course, food is important, too. Not all schools can serve summer meals, which leaves many students at risk. And while this school used to have three Chow buses, funded by a USDA grant, they’re now down to one. “If we lose this bus,” Sneed says, “people will be hungry.”</p>

  <p><strong>Today, my grandmother’s town of Blue Ridge is surrounded by million-dollar vacation homes, its downtown sidewalks lined with art galleries and outfitters selling $6,000 bamboo fly rods.</strong> The economic disparity between visitors and full-time residents is vast. Fannin County schools qualify for the Community Eligibility Provision, which allows free meals for all — at least for now.&nbsp;</p><p>Martha Williams, who works as director of nutrition and wellness in Fannin County School District, grew up here and originally returned to teach math. But a cafeteria lunch lady inspired Williams to work in school nutrition when she pulled the teacher aside and pointed out a student who seemed disheveled and kept wearing the same clothes. Williams recognized the insights that can be gleaned from the serving line and how the work goes beyond keeping kids fed to providing stability, routine, and community care.&nbsp;</p><p>Williams points to another inspiration, GiGi Thomas, 63, who has worked in school food service for more than two decades. These days one of her duties is serving cookies, kept in an ancient warmer that “probably came over on the Mayflower,” Thomas says with a laugh. She hands students freshly baked cookies on napkins. “I see these kids every day,” she says. Some of them like chocolate chip cookies, others prefer sugar cookies. “It tickles them to death that I kind of remember what they get.”&nbsp;</p><p>In 2023, her cookies were featured in the high school seniors’ graduation video. “If you don’t have the cookies, those kids are devastated,” Thomas says. “That’s all you wanna do is take care of the kids.”&nbsp;</p><p>Over in West Tennessee, Seiber-Garland says she sometimes feels like she has 1,400 kids of her own. If no one shows up for a student on grandparents’ day, she fills in. And she loves running into students outside school, where they’re excited to say, “There’s my lunch lady!” Alumni sometimes share photos of their kids. “They’re so special. Every one of them.”&nbsp;</p><p>Over her 22 years in the business, Seiber-Garland has served her mother’s recipe for poppyseed chicken as well as old favorites like chicken tetrazzini and spaghetti. “I’ve always said, <em>I want this to be their cafe</em>. I can’t control what goes on at night. But for two-thirds or three-fourths of the day, I can. And I want them to be fed and happy, well, and blessed. They bless me.”&nbsp;</p><p>She tells of a student who kept trying to save her meal to carry home, because she didn’t have anything to eat there. Seiber-Garland and her staff found a way to provide her with a second meal for the evening. “I also had a parent come tell me to not let her child eat. And I’m like, <em>No ma’am. If she asks to eat in my line, I’m gonna feed her.</em>” &nbsp;</p><p>Seiber-Garland says there are people who donate every year to help pay off lunch balances that have remained unpaid. Recently, she created a “share table” on a red cart with a donated Yeti cooler that helps teach kids about reducing food waste. It’s where students can leave unopened milks or whole food that they don’t want for their classmates to enjoy. She’s also been known to cover lunches out of her own pocket, and her staff has taken up collections, too. “They’re gonna be fed,” she says. “We’ll find a way.”&nbsp;</p><p>I hear in those words the resourcefulness and care of my own grandmother and a guiding phrase she taught my father in standing up for what you believe. &nbsp;</p><p>As Granny would say, “You take your part.”&nbsp; ◊</p>

Available in public beta, this feature ensures API responses always match your specified JSON schemas or tool definitions.</p><p>With structured outputs, developers can eliminate schema-related parsing errors and failed tool calls by ensuring that Claude's responses conform to a defined schema—whether you're extracting data from images, orchestrating agents, or integrating with external APIs.</p><h3>Building reliable applications</h3><p>For developers building applications and agents in production, a single error in data formatting can cause cascading failures. Structured outputs solves this by guaranteeing your response matches the exact structure you define, without any impact to model performance. This makes Claude dependable for applications and agents where accuracy is critical, including:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Data extraction </strong>when downstream systems rely on error-free, consistent formats.</li><li><strong>Multi-agent architectures </strong>where consistent communication between agents is critical for a performant, stable experience.</li><li><strong>Complex search tools </strong>where multiple search fields must be filled in accurately and conform to specific patterns.</li></ul><p>Structured outputs can be used two ways: with JSON or tools. When used with JSON, you provide your schema definition in the API request. For tools, you define your tool specifications, and Claude's output conforms to those tool definitions automatically.</p><p>The end result is a reliable output, reduced retries, and a simplified codebase that no longer needs failover logic or complex error handling.</p><h3>Customer Spotlight: OpenRouter</h3><p>OpenRouter provides 4M+ developers access to all major AI models through a single, unified interface.</p><p>"Structured outputs have become a really valuable part of the agentic AI stack. Agents constantly ingest and produce structured data, so Anthropic’s structured outputs close a real gap for developers. Agent workflows run reliably, every time, and teams can focus on their customers rather than debugging tool calls,” said Chris Clark, COO, OpenRouter.</p><h3>Getting started</h3><p>Structured outputs is now available in public beta for Sonnet 4.5 and Opus 4.1 on the Claude Developer Platform, with support for Haiku 4.5 coming soon.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Much of the developer world is familiar with the AWS outage in <code>us-east-1</code> that occurred on October 20th <a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/message/101925/">due to a race condition bug</a> inside a DNS management service. The backlog of events we needed to process from that outage on the 20th stretched our system to the limits, and so we decided to increase our headroom for event handling throughput. When we attempted that infrastructure upgrade on October 23rd, we ran into yet another race condition bug in Aurora RDS. This is the story of how we figured out it was an AWS bug (later confirmed by AWS) and what we learned.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>The Hightouch Events product enables organizations to gather and centralize user behavioral data such as page views, clicks, and purchases. Customers can setup syncs to load events into a cloud data warehouse for analytics or stream them directly to marketing, operational, and analytics tools to support real-time personalization use cases.</p>
<p>Here is the portion of Hightouch’s architecture dedicated to our events system:</p>

<p>Hightouch events system architecture</p>
<p>Our system scales on three levers: Kubernetes clusters that contain event collectors and batch workers, Kafka for event processing, and Postgres as our virtual queue metadata store.</p>
<p>When our pagers went off during the AWS outage on the 20th, we observed:</p>
<ul role="list"><li>Services were unable to connect to Kafka brokers managed by AWS MSK.</li><li>Services struggled to autoscale because we couldn’t provision new EC2 nodes.</li><li>Customer functions for realtime data transformation were unavailable due to AWS STS errors, which caused our retry queues to balloon in size.</li></ul>
<p>Kafka’s durability meant that no events were dropped once they were accepted by the collectors, but there was a massive backlog to process. Syncs with consistently high traffic or with enrichments that needed to call slower 3rd party services took longer to catch up and were testing the limits of our (small) Postgres instance’s ability to act as a queue for the batch metadata.</p>
<p>As an aside, at Hightouch, we <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazingcto.com/postgres-for-everything/">start with Postgres where we can</a>. Postgres queues serve our non-events architecture well at ~1M syncs/day and for events scaled to 500K events per second at ~1s end-to-end latency on a small Aurora instance.</p>
<p>After observing the events on the 20th, We wanted to upsize the DB to give us more headroom. Given that <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/CHAP_AuroraOverview.html">Aurora</a> supports <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/AuroraPostgreSQL.Managing.html#:~:text=As%20an%20alternative,Amazon%20Aurora%20PostgreSQL">fast failovers</a> for scaling up instances, we decided to proceed with an upgrade on Oct 23rd without a scheduled maintenance window.</p>
<h3 id="aws-aurora-rds">AWS Aurora RDS</h3>
<p>The central datastore for real-time streaming and warehouse delivery of customer events uses <strong>Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL</strong>.</p>
<p>Aurora's architecture differs from traditional PostgreSQL in a crucial way: it separates compute from storage. An Aurora cluster consists of:</p>
<ul role="list"><li><strong>One primary writer instance</strong> that handles all write operations</li><li><strong>Multiple read replica instances</strong> that handle read-only queries</li><li><strong>A shared storage layer</strong> that all instances access, automatically replicated across multiple availability zones</li></ul>
<p>This architecture enables fast failovers and efficient read scaling, but as we'd discover, it also introduces unique failure modes.</p>
<p>A <strong>failover</strong> is the process of promoting a read replica to become the new primary writer - typically done automatically when the primary fails, or manually triggered for maintenance operations like ours. When you trigger a failover in the AWS console:</p>

<p>How Hightouch Events uses Aurora</p>
<h2 id="the-plan">The Plan</h2>
<p>This was our upgrade plan:</p>
<ol role="list"><li>Add another read replica (instance #3) to maintain read capacity during the upgrade.</li><li>Upgrade the existing reader (instance #2) to the target size and give it the highest failover priority.</li><li>Trigger a failover to promote instance #2 as the new writer (expected downtime less than 15s, handled gracefully by our backend).</li><li>Upgrade the old writer (instance #1) to match the size and make it a reader.</li><li>Remove the temporary extra reader (instance #3).</li></ol>
<p>The AWS docs supported this approach and we had already tested the process successfully in a staging environment while performing a load test, so we were confident in the correctness of the procedure.</p>
<h2 id="the-upgrade-attempt">The Upgrade Attempt</h2>
<p>At 16:39 EDT on October 23, 2025, we triggered the failover to the newly-upgraded instance #2. The AWS Console showed the typical progression: parameter adjustments, instance restarts, the usual status updates.</p>
<p>Then the page refreshed. Instance #1 - the original writer was still the primary. The failover had <strong>reversed itself</strong>.</p>
<p>According to AWS everything was healthy. The cluster appeared healthy across the board. But our backend services couldn't execute write queries. Restarting the services cleared the errors and restored normal operation, but the upgrade had failed.</p>
<p>We tried again at 16:43. Same result: brief promotion followed by immediate reversal.</p>
<p><strong>Two failed failovers in five minutes</strong>. Nothing else had changed - no code updates, no unusual queries, no traffic spikes. We had successfully tested this exact procedure in a staging environment under load earlier in the day. We checked our process to see if we had made any mistakes. We searched online to see if anyone else had encountered this issue but found nothing. Nothing obvious could explain why Aurora was refusing to complete the failover in this cluster. We were perplexed.</p>
<h2 id="the-investigation">The Investigation</h2>
<p>We first checked database metrics for anything unusual. There was a spike in connection count, network traffic, and commit throughput to the read replica (instance #2) during the failover.</p>
<p>The higher commit throughput could have been due to replication or the execution of write queries. The other two metrics simply indicated a higher query volume.</p>
<p>We checked the read query traffic from the app (graph below), and found that there was no change during this period. This told us the extra traffic to instance #2 came from our backend services which are supposed to connect to the writer instance.</p>

<ol role="list"><li>The pods did not get the signal that the writer had changed - i.e. the cluster did not terminate the connection.</li><li>The cluster endpoint incorrectly pointed to a reader instance.</li><li>The pod was connected to the writer, but the write operation was rejected at runtime.</li></ol>
<p>We did not find any evidence supporting or disproving #1 in the application logs. We had a strong suspicion it was either #2 or #3. We downloaded the database logs to take a closer look and found something interesting. In both the promoted reader and the original writer, we found the same sequence of logs:</p>
<pre><code><span>2025</span><span>-10</span><span>-23</span> <span>20</span>:<span>38</span>:<span>58</span> UTC::@:[<span>569</span>]:LOG:  starting PostgreSQL...
...
...
...
LOG:  database <span>system</span> <span>is</span> ready <span>to</span> accept connections
LOG:  server process (PID <span>799</span>) was terminated <span>by</span> signal <span>9</span>: Killed
DETAIL:  Failed process was <span>running</span>: <span>&lt;</span>write query <span>from</span> backend application<span>&gt;</span>
LOG:  terminating <span>any</span> other active server processes
FATAL:  Can<span>'t handle storage runtime process crash
LOG:  database system is shut down
</span></code></pre>
<p>This led us to a hypothesis:</p>
<p>During the failover window, Aurora briefly allowed both instances to process writes. The distributed storage layer rejected the concurrent write operations, causing both instances to crash.</p>
<p>We expect Aurora’s failover orchestration to do something like this:</p>
<ol role="list"><li>Stop accepting new writes. Clients can expect connection errors until the failover completes.</li><li>Finish processing in-flight write requests.</li><li>Demote the writer and simultaneously promote the reader.</li><li>Accept new write requests on the new writer.</li></ol>
<p><strong>There was clearly a race condition between steps 3 &amp; 4.</strong></p>
<h2 id="testing-the-hypothesis">Testing the Hypothesis</h2>
<p>To validate the theory, we performed a controlled failover attempt. This time:</p>
<ol role="list"><li>We scaled down all services that write to the database</li><li>We triggered the failover again</li><li>We monitored for storage runtime crashes</li></ol>
<p>By eliminating <strong>concurrent writes</strong>, the failover completed successfully. This strongly reinforced the race-condition hypothesis.</p>
<h2 id="aws-confirms-the-root-cause">AWS Confirms the Root Cause</h2>
<p>We escalated the findings and log patterns to AWS. After an internal review, AWS confirmed that:</p>
<p>The root cause was due to an internal signaling issue in the demotion process of the old writer, resulting in the writer being unchanged after the failover.</p>
<p><strong>They also confirmed that there was nothing unique about our configuration or usage that would trigger the bug</strong>. The conditions that caused it were not under our control.</p>
<p>AWS has indicated a fix is on their roadmap, but as of now, the recommended mitigation aligns with our solution: use Aurora’s Failover feature on an as-needed basis and ensure that no writes are executed against the DB during the failover.</p>
<h2 id="final-state">Final State</h2>
<p>With the race condition understood and mitigated, we:</p>
<ul role="list"><li>Successfully upsized the cluster in <code>us-east-1</code></li><li>Updated our internal playbooks to <strong>pause writers before an intentional failover</strong></li><li>Added monitoring to detect any unexpected writer role advertisement flips</li></ul>
<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>
<p>The following principles were reinforced during this experience:</p>
<ol role="list"><li>Prepare for the worst in any migration - you could end up in your desired end state, beginning state, or an in-between state - even for services you trust. Ensuring you’re ready to redirect traffic and handle brief outages in dependencies will minimize downtime.</li><li>The importance of good observability cannot be emphasized enough. The “brief writer advertisement” was only detectable because we were monitoring queries to each instance in Datadog and had access to database logs in RDS.</li><li>For large scale distributed systems, isolating the impact any single component can have on the system can help both uptime and maintenance. It helps a lot if the design allows for such events without completely shutting down the system.</li><li>Test setups are not always representative of production environments. Even though we practiced the upgrade process during a load test in a staging region, we could not reproduce the exact conditions that caused the race condition in Aurora. AWS confirmed that there was nothing specific about our traffic pattern that would trigger it.</li></ol>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-id="4189490c" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="theme-post-content.default">
					<p>A major political confrontation over online privacy is approaching as European governments prepare to decide on “<a href="https://reclaimthenet.org/eu-chat-control-2-0-experts-warn-against-encryption-surveillance-law">Chat Control 2.0,</a>” the European Commission’s revised proposal for monitoring private digital communications.</p>
<p>The plan, which could be endorsed behind closed doors, has drawn urgent warnings from Dr. Patrick Breyer, a jurist and former Member of the European Parliament, who says the draft conceals sweeping new surveillance powers beneath misleading language about “risk mitigation” and “child protection.”</p>
<p>In a release sent to Reclaim The Net, Breyer, long a defender of digital freedom, argues that the Commission has quietly reintroduced compulsory scanning of private messages after it was previously rejected.</p>
<p>He describes the move as a “deceptive sleight of hand,” insisting that it transforms a supposedly voluntary framework into a system that could compel all chat, email, and messaging providers to monitor users.</p>
<p>“This is a political deception of the highest order,” Breyer said.</p>
<p>“Following loud public protests, several member states, including <a href="https://reclaimthenet.org/germany-rejects-eu-chat-control-law">Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, and Austria, said ‘No’</a> to indiscriminate Chat Control. Now it’s coming back through the back door disguised, more dangerous, and more comprehensive than ever. The public is being played for fools.”</p>
<p>Under the <a href="https://docs.reclaimthenet.org/council-presidency-lewp-csa-r-presidency-compromise-texts-14092.pdf">new text</a>, providers would be obliged to take “all appropriate risk mitigation measures” to prevent abuse on their platforms. While the Commission presents this as a flexible safety requirement, Breyer insists it is a loophole that could justify forcing companies to scan every private message, including those protected by end-to-end encryption.</p>
<p>“The loophole renders the much-praised removal of detection orders worthless and negates their supposed voluntary nature,” he said.</p>
<p>He warns that it could even lead to the introduction of “client-side scanning,” where users’ devices themselves perform surveillance before messages are sent.</p>
<p>Unlike the current temporary exemption known as “Chat Control 1.0,” which allows voluntary scanning of photos and videos, the new draft would open the door to text and metadata analysis. Algorithms and artificial intelligence could be deployed to monitor conversations and flag “suspicious” content.</p>
<p>Breyer notes that such automated scrutiny cannot interpret context and risks sweeping up ordinary exchanges. “No AI can reliably distinguish between a flirt, sarcasm, and criminal ‘grooming’,” he said. “Imagine your phone scanning every conversation with your partner, your daughter, your therapist, and leaking it just because the word ‘love’ or ‘meet’ appears somewhere. This is not child protection, this is a digital witch hunt.”</p>
<p>According to Breyer, the existing voluntary system has already proven flawed, with German police reporting that roughly half of all flagged cases turn out to be irrelevant.</p>
<p>The proposal also carries major implications for identity and anonymity online. A new requirement would force users to verify their age before creating accounts on messaging or email platforms, an obligation that would likely require official ID or biometric checks.</p>
<p>Breyer argues that such measures effectively abolish anonymous communication. “This is the de facto end of anonymous communication online, a disaster for whistleblowers, journalists, political activists, and people seeking help who rely on the protection of anonymity,” he said.</p>
<p>He also condemned the provision restricting minors under 16 from using messaging and social media platforms with chat functions. “Digital isolation instead of education, protection by exclusion instead of empowerment, this is paternalistic, out of touch with reality, and pedagogical nonsense,” he warned, saying the measure risks cutting young people off from key channels of social and educational interaction.</p>
<p>Breyer is calling on EU governments that previously resisted mass surveillance, among them Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, Czechia, Luxembourg, Finland, Austria, and Estonia, to block the regulation in its current form.</p>
<p>“Now, these governments must show some backbone!” he urged. “Block this sham compromise in the Council and demand immediate corrections to save the fundamental rights of all citizens.”</p>
<p>He proposes a series of specific changes before any agreement should move forward: a guarantee that “risk mitigation” cannot be used to mandate scanning, a prohibition on AI-driven monitoring of text conversations, strict judicial oversight for targeted investigations, and the preservation of anonymous access to communication tools.</p>
<p>“They are selling us security but delivering a total surveillance machine,” Breyer concluded.</p>
<p>“They promise child protection but punish our children and criminalize privacy. This is not a compromise; this is a fraud against the citizen. And no democratic government should make itself an accomplice.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
        <p>Bitchat is a new messaging app that allows users to chat securely with or without internet access. Download it today via the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bitchat-mesh/id6748219622?ref=updates.techforpalestine.org"><u>App Store</u></a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bitchat.droid&amp;ref=updates.techforpalestine.org"><u>Google Play store</u></a> to begin communicating safely, even when connectivity disappears.</p><p><strong><u>Why Bitchat is needed</u></strong></p><p>Palestinians are dependent on Israel for their access to electricity, telecoms, and internet routing. Israel has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/09/world/middleeast/gaza-electricity.html?ref=updates.techforpalestine.org"><u>weaponized</u></a> this dependence in Gaza by deliberately causing <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/un-says-full-internet-blackout-gaza-paralyzing-aid-operations-2025-06-12/?ref=updates.techforpalestine.org"><u>blackouts</u></a> that have left Palestinians cut off from communicating with each other or with the outside world. The relentless bombing campaign has also destroyed or severely crippled any remaining communication infrastructure.</p><p>Even when Palestinians use regular communication methods, their conversations and messages can be <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/06/microsoft-israeli-military-palestinian-phone-calls-cloud?ref=updates.techforpalestine.org"><u>monitored and recorded</u></a>, leaving them exposed to surveillance and potential targeting.</p><p>The basic human right to communicate freely, and without interruption, has been denied to the Palestinian people.</p><p><strong><u>The solution</u></strong></p><p>Bitchat lets you keep messaging even when the internet or power is down. It connects phones directly through Bluetooth, and each phone helps pass messages along, allowing communication to stretch much farther than just your immediate area. Everything is fully encrypted so your conversations stay private.</p><p>When you do have internet or cell service, Bitchat can send your messages anywhere in the world using a network of relays. There is no central server that stores any of your data. You don’t need to create an account, share your phone number or email, or even have a SIM card to use it.</p><p><strong><u>Staying connected when all else fails</u></strong></p><p>Bitchat is an Israel-proof messaging alternative that continues to work even when traditional networks are shut down. The app also has “Geohash” channels that allows users to join location-based chats, so Palestinians can stay connected to their neighbors down the street or to the larger community in cities across the region.&nbsp;</p><p>This lets Palestinians check on the safety of loved ones, organize and coordinate within their communities, and share critical news and updates.</p><p><strong><u>Validated by T4P</u></strong></p><p>T4P has evaluated the app, testing it in various conditions, and looked at the technology and governance of the application. After this evaluation, T4P recognizes it as a secure and resilient communication tool for Palestinian communities when faced with internet disruptions or outages. In addition, Tech for Palestine community members are among BitChat’s top code contributors.</p><p>Bitchat has seen a surge in downloads in countries facing civil unrest like Nepal, Indonesia, Côte d'Ivoire, and most recently Madagascar. The Nepali government <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2025/09/11/jack-dorseys-bitchat-gains-traction-during-nepals-unrest/?ref=updates.techforpalestine.org"><u>blocked access</u></a> to all major social media platforms, forcing civilians to search for alternative methods of communication.</p><p>WhatsApp is known to <a href="https://theintercept.com/2024/05/22/whatsapp-security-vulnerability-meta-israel-palestine/?ref=updates.techforpalestine.org"><u>expose</u></a> <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/en/pixels/article/2025/09/09/whatsapp-and-meta-accused-of-serious-security-breaches-by-former-executive_6745186_13.html?ref=updates.techforpalestine.org"><u>private</u></a> data, potentially to Israel – and these breaches have been used to <a href="https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20240418-israel-using-metas-whatsapp-to-kill-palestinians-in-gaza-through-ai-system/?ref=updates.techforpalestine.org"><u>target Palestinians</u></a>.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
			<p>The more I speak about being poor, the more I realize how fundamentally other folks misunderstand what it means to be poor versus being broke. The advice folks will give comes from a good place. However, I would like to give some examples to help everyone understand most advice from non-poor folks isn’t helpful.</p>
<p>Everyone has experienced being broke. Being broke sucks. You are watching every dollar spent, finding wayys to trim or make things stretch until the next payday. The difference is when you are broke you have <em>some money</em>. You can afford to put gas in your car, but not enough to do that repair. Money is tight, but you can get the basics at the grocery store. You can’t afford to go to the movies, but will stay home and watch what’s new on Netflix. Being broke sucks. You are watching every dollar spent, finding ways to trim or make things stretch until the next payday.</p>
<p>When you are poor that next payday brings no relief. It is like an endless runner game. No matter how fast you run or how high you jump you can never see the finish line. No matter how tired you are the ground keeps moving. There is no room for errors as the punishment for mistakes is astronomical. When you hit an obstacle you don’t restart from the last checkpoint, you go back to the beginning.</p>
<p>There is this mindset from folks that poor people must not be smart. I mean, you’re smart and you’re not poor! The problem must be a skill issue! Learn the skills to do it yourself and you’ll be able to pull yourself up.</p>
<p>The other mindset is poor people are lazy. Quit complaining and do it yourself!  Just get a better job! Get a second job! There’s money out there, you just have to go get it.</p>
<p>The last is these folks think they understand what it is like to be poor. Hey, I was a broke college student and I get being poor! I had a rough patch, it will pass.</p>
<p>Let’s start at the top.</p>
<p>I have a van that is falling apart. It needs a lot of work that we cannot afford to do. In the mindset that poor people are unskilled, it appears that I should watch some YouTube videos, get the parts, and do it myself. The misunderstanding is that being poor means you have tons and tons of skills. You have to fix everything yourself. There is never, I mean never, a time you can pay someone to fix it for you.</p>
<p>In this example folks think, “If the repair at the shop costs $1,000, but the parts cost $300, you can save a lot of money doing it yourself.” You are absolutely correct. Yet, I still need to be able to afford the $300 in parts.</p>
<p>Do you see the misunderstanding? I can’t make $300 appear out of thin air. I have the skills, I’ve had to fix all my cars myself. I’ve done complete engine rebuilds, I’ve replaced transmissions, I do all my own regular maintenance. The problem isn’t skills, its <em>money</em>. When you are broke, spending $300 instead of $1,000 sounds like a win because you can’t afford the $1,000. When you’re poor $300 might as well be $1,000 or $10,000, you will never afford it.</p>
<p>This is not a matter of time, either. I can’t put aside money each month and then get it. There is never money to put aside. I can’t put it on the credit card as I know I will never be able to pay it. I’ll just have this $300 debt looming over me, increasing with interest every month, mocking how much of a loser I am.</p>
<p>The second mindset: Being lazy.</p>
<p>How do I have the time to work multiple jobs when I’m doing all this extra work? How do I have the time when in my extra time I’m fixing cars, appliances, the roof, and cooking every meal from scratch?</p>
<p>Should I work a second job and never see my wife? My kids? Should I never have any personal time? Should my entire life revolve around money? Should I kill myself for capitalism?</p>
<p>Folks who say things like this have only ever experienced being broke. It is a temporary situation and a few months of extra income will solve the problem. Being poor is not missing $1,000 or $10,000 in the short term. It’s missing $40,000 a year, every year, forever. There is no short term relief. This isn’t a rough patch. It is The Pit in The Dark Knight Rises.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“There’s a reason why this prison is the worst hell on earth… Hope. Every man who has rotted here over the centuries has looked up to the light and imagined climbing to freedom. So easy… So simple… And like shipwrecked men turning to sea water from uncontrollable thirst, many have died trying. I learned here that there can be no true despair without hope.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, it is possible to escape. Hell, two people have done it! Why can’t you do it! But you are completely ignoring how many people have fallen to their death trying.</p>
<p>All of the general guidance to escape being poor is actually advice for getting through being broke.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cancel Netflix</li>
<li>Make food at home</li>
<li>Stop going to Starbucks</li>
<li>Fix it yourself</li>
<li>Don’t upgrade your phone</li>
</ul>
<p>These are all things that will help you <em>temporarily</em>. It will help you get through a short period of being broke. Or it will help you get your spending under control. You have enough money, you just don’t spend it wisely.</p>
<p>Being poor is you already did all those things. You cancelled all your streaming services years ago. You make all your food from scratch all the time. You never go to fucking Starbucks. You fix everything yourself. You already stretch everything to the limit. That is how you have to live every day of your life, for eternity, with no relief in sight.</p>
<p>Last example and is pertinent to our times in the US. A lot of poor folks are having to stand in line for hours and hours to get food at a food bank due to goverment ineptitude. The advice to simply cook at home doesn’t fix that there isn’t any food at home.</p>
<p>Do you honestly think people standing in line at a food bank could fix their situation if they stopped getting DoorDash? Going to Starbucks? Fuck off. They weren’t doing that already.</p>
<p>How are they to get another job or put in extra hours if they have to stand in line for 3 hours to get food? Should they go without food until they get that job and the paycheck?</p>
<p>You need to step aside and think about the differences between being broke and being poor.</p>

         A new study finds that the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, which causes Lyme disease, can be weakened by disrupting its balance of manganese.

        </div>

        
            <div id="news-story">
                        <p>For decades, Lyme disease has frustrated both physicians and patients alike. Caused by the corkscrew-shaped bacterium <em>Borrelia burgdorferi</em>, the infection, if left untreated, can linger for months, leading to fever, fatigue and painful inflammation.</p>

<p>In a new study, Northwestern University and Uniformed Services University (USU) scientists have uncovered a surprising — and ironic — vulnerability in the hardy bacterium. By exploiting this vulnerability, researchers could help disarm&nbsp;<em>B. burgdorferi</em>, potentially leading to new therapeutic strategies for Lyme disease.</p>

<p>The Northwestern and USU team discovered that manganese, which helps shield <em>B. burgdorferi</em> against its host’s immune system, is simultaneously also a crack in its armor. If <em>B. burgdorferi</em> is either starved of or overloaded with manganese, the bacteria become highly vulnerable to the host’s immune system or treatments they would otherwise resist.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/mbio.02824-25">study was published</a> today (Nov. 13) in the journal mBio.</p>

<p>“Our work shows that manganese is a double-edged sword in Lyme disease,” said Northwestern’s <a href="https://sites.northwestern.edu/hoffmanchem/">Brian Hoffman</a>, who co-led the study with USU’s <a href="https://www.usuhs.edu/profile/michael-daly-phd">Michael Daly</a>. “It’s both Borrelia’s armor and its weakness. If we can target the way it manages manganese, we could open doors for entirely new approaches for treating Lyme disease.”</p>

<p>Hoffman is the Charles E. and Emma H. Morrison Professor of Chemistry and molecular biosciences at Northwestern’s <a href="https://weinberg.northwestern.edu/">Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences</a>. He also is a member of the <a href="https://clp.northwestern.edu/">Chemistry of Life Processes Institute</a> and the <a href="https://www.cancer.northwestern.edu/">Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University</a>. Daly is an emeritus professor of pathology at USU.</p>

<p>Since the 1980s, the occurrence of Lyme disease has increased dramatically across North America and around the globe. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/data-research/facts-stats/index.html">roughly 476,000 people</a> in the United States are diagnosed annually. Currently, there are no approved vaccines against the disease, and long-term use of antibiotics is problematic.</p>

<p>“Although antibiotics harm <em>B. burgdorferi</em>, they also kill beneficial gut bacteria,” Daly said. “Lyme disease is transmitted through tick bites and — if not treated promptly — can cause lingering effects by attacking the patient’s immune, circulatory and central nervous systems.”</p>

<p>In a series of previous studies, Hoffman and Daly collaborated to <a href="https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2024/12/how-conan-the-bacterium-withstands-extreme-radiation">understand the role of manganese in Deinococcus radiodurans</a>, a radiation-resistant bacteria known as “Conan the Bacterium” for its extraordinary ability to survive harsh conditions. Now, they wanted to see if manganese played a role in <em>B. burgdorferi’s</em> defenses.</p>

<p>To conduct the study, the team used a new tool called electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) imaging to characterize the atomic composition of manganese inside the living bacteria. To add even finer detail, the team harnessed electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) spectroscopy to examine the atoms surrounding manganese. Together, the technologies created a molecular map, showing which forms of manganese were present, where they were located and how they changed under stress.</p>

<p>The “map” revealed a two-tier, manganese-based defense system comprising an enzyme called MnSOD and a pool of manganese metabolites. To withstand bombardment from the host’s immune system, the bacteria first use MnSOD, which acts like a shield. If any oxygen radicals slip past this shield, they are met with the metabolite pool, which acts like a sponge to soak up and neutralize those toxic molecules.</p>

<p>“Our study demonstrates the power of EPR and ENDOR spectroscopies for uncovering hidden biochemical mechanisms in pathogens,” Hoffman said. “Without these tools, <em>B. burgdorferi</em>’s defense system and weak spots would have remained invisible.”</p>

<p>The scientists found the bacteria constantly juggle where to send the manganese — to the MnSOD enzymes or the metabolite pool. Too little manganese and the bacteria lose their defense mechanisms. But, as the microbes age, their metabolite pools dramatically shrink, leaving them exposed to damage and stress. At this point, too much manganese becomes toxic because the bacteria can no longer store it safely.</p>

<p>This discovery holds potential for new Lyme disease therapies. Future drugs could starve the bacterium of manganese, disrupt its ability to form protective manganese complexes or even push it into toxic overload. Any of these approaches would leave&nbsp;<em>B. burgdorferi</em>&nbsp;wide open to attack by the immune system.</p>

<p>“By disrupting the delicate balance of manganese in&nbsp;<em>B. burgdorferi</em>, it may be possible to weaken the pathogen during infection,” Daly said. “Manganese is an Achilles’ heel of its defenses.”</p>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>The study was supported by the Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs’ Tick-borne Disease Research Program and the National Institutes of Health. Additional funds were from the Defense Threat Reduction Agency and National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.</p>

				<h3>from the <i>abandonware</i> dept</h3>
				


				<p>One of my favorite things in all of professional sports is the unofficial holiday referred to as “<a href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/45590991/bobby-bonilla-day-2025-new-york-mets-pay-million-every-july-1">Bobby Bonilla Day.</a>” The short version of it is that Bonilla played for the New York Mets decades ago and eventually bought out his contract in 2000 when they decided they were done with him. Rather than pay the $5.9 million buyout of the contract up front, the team instead made the bonkers decision to negotiate a deferred payment schedule for that amount <em>with 8% interest</em> over the course of 25 years. The result is that the Mets will be paying Bonilla $1.2 million per year every July 1st, starting in 2011 and ending in 2035. And if you can’t make sense of the math on that one, it’s because you aren’t aware that the Mets ownership <a href="https://people.com/the-former-mlb-player-making-millions-a-year-because-of-bernie-madoff-11764506">was one of Bernie Madoff’s many victims</a>, which is why they had to defer the payments.</p>
<p>November 10th is <em>not</em> Bobby Bonilla Day. But it should be named “Let Us Play <em>No One Lives Forever</em>, You Assholes Day.” The classic spy-shooter turned 25 on that date and, for the exact <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2020/11/11/happy-20th-birthday-to-no-one-lives-forever-classic-pc-game-that-cant-be-sold-today-thanks-to-ip/">same reasons</a> we’ve detailed for a god damned <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2015/03/25/no-copyright-lives-forever-how-apathy-ip-rights-holders-about-their-copyrights-killed-game-re-release/">decade now</a>, you still can’t buy the game.</p>
<p>Here’s the short of it. Due to a series of mergers, closures, and rights purchases, the IP rights for <em>No One Lives Forever</em> and its sequel have been potentially split into three pieces between Warner Bros., Activision, and 20th Century Fox, like it was some kind of fucking horcrux. I say potentially because nobody really knows who owns what, if anything, when it comes to these games. When one company, Nightdive Studios, attempted to remaster and re-release the game as they’ve done with other titles, along with securing trademark rights to the game which hasn’t been sold in over a decade, all three companies complained that they may have rights to it and may sue over it.</p>
<p>All of those qualifiers are, again, because even these companies themselves don’t know what rights they actually have. And why is that? Well, because the gaming rights deals were inked before digital storage was widely used for this sort of thing and, well, nobody seems to be able to locate the actual paperwork denoting who owns what. Here’s an example of an exchange Nightdive had with Activision.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“So we went back to Activision and, [after] numerous correspondence going back and forth, they replied that they thought they might have some rights, but that any records predated digital storage. So we’re talking about a contract in a box someplace.” Kuperman laughed. “The image I get is the end of Indiana Jones… somewhere in a box, maybe in the bowels of Activision, maybe it was shipped off to Iron Mountain or somewhere. And they confessed, they didn’t have [their] hands on it. And they weren’t sure that they even had any of those rights.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which didn’t keep Activision from warning Nightdive that it <em>might</em> totally sue if it moved forward with remastering the game. The other companies made similar noises.</p>
<p>So what’s a person to do if they want to play this game? You can’t buy it legitimately currently. It’s not even for sale anywhere. And a situation like that, which I’ve stated before, completely breaks the copyright bargain. The only option is, as Kotaku of all places notes, to <a href="https://kotaku.com/no-one-lives-forever-modernized-nolf-abandonware-2000642390">download it for free from somewhere</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Downloading games that are available for sale is piracy. It’s illegal, and it’s not supportive of developers and their art. But when companies have gone out of their way to refuse to take your money for a game for the better part of two decades, it’s a very different situation. Look, I’m not your real mom and dad, and I can’t tell you what to do. But if you&nbsp;were&nbsp;to click on this link&nbsp;(link removed by Techdirt due to us not knowing where it takes you) and download both games (as well as spin-off&nbsp;Contract Jack), you’d end up with modernized versions of these classic games, with mods that allow them to work on Windows 10 and 11, and in widescreen. And what better time to do (or not do) this than on the first game’s 25th anniversary?</em></p>
<p><em>At this point (as indeed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/no-one-will-sell-no-one-lives-forever-so-lets-download-it">it was over eight years ago, the last time I suggested just downloading it, to no negative response at all</a>) we have to consider&nbsp;No One Lives Forever&nbsp;to be abandonware. No one is willing to take ownership of it, although those that&nbsp;could&nbsp;do so sometimes mindlessly threaten to intervene should anyone else try to rebuild it for sale. Nightdive were scared off a decade ago, and it’s been sitting on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gog.com/dreamlist/game/the-operative-no-one-lives-forever">GOG’s Dreamlist since that launched earlier this year</a>&nbsp;(with 87,171 people saying they’d pay for it if they could). It’s far too small of a concern for any of the megacorps who&nbsp;might&nbsp;own it to spend the time and money to work out if they do, but it’s far too big of a concern within gaming history to be allowed to just disappear. Thank goodness for the anonymous heroes running NOLF Revival. I thank them for their service.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s the only option the public has to play this game and enjoy this small piece of our collective culture. The real answer here is some sort of copyright reform that makes this situation not a thing. If a company, or group of companies, won’t offer a piece of work for sale, can’t be bothered to understand what they own of it, if anything, and have no plans to figure any of that out… then how can this be copyright infringement?</p>
<p>So happy “Let Us Play <em>No One Lives Forever</em>, You Assholes” Day. Maybe we’ll be able to play this game legitimately by the time Bobby Bonilla stops making his million and change per year.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><main components="[object Object]"><p>A part of me still hasn't recovered from learning that some people believe there is no such thing as an untranslatable word. I've written about why I disagree <a href="https://aethermug.com/posts/is-there-anything-untranslatable">before</a>, but that explanation didn't satisfy me completely. There was a stronger argument to be made, I thought, but I couldn't put it into words. Now I remember, though: you need to see language as (a little bit) like math. Call me crazy, but I think that language translation is like a change of basis in linear algebra.</p>
<p>Me making weird connections like this might simply be an occupational hazard. Both my PhD research and my first job had to do with controlling the position and orientation of spacecraft and rocks in space, which means that I spent years juggling vectors, matrix multiplications, and reference frames almost daily. Still, I think it is simple enough to be understood by anyone, so hear me out.</p>

<p><em>If the mere sight of the above is like a punch in the face for you, don't worry. I'm not going to math you to death in what follows. I will only remind you of a tiny basic part of it that I think relates to languages.)</em></p>
<p>During those same mathematical days, I was also learning Japanese. The language fascinated me for many reasons, like its <a href="https://aethermug.com/posts/the-beautiful-dissociation-of-the-japanese-language">beautiful dissociation</a> between written and spoken words and its <a href="https://aethermug.com/posts/i-like-the-sound-of-how-you-look-at-me">many</a> <a href="https://aethermug.com/posts/what-if-gratitude-was-built-into-the-grammar">unique</a> <a href="https://aethermug.com/posts/in-japanese-you-need-a-dictionary-to-count-things">quirks</a>, but I was also struck early on by something a bit more meta: how hard it is to translate things to and from it.</p>
<p>These two concurrent interests made it hard for me not to see a connection. For almost a decade now, I've held it in a corner of my mind without telling anyone, perhaps because I thought it would be seen as too outrageous, but hey! Now LLMs are popular and they <em>literally</em> handle words and concepts as vectors with linear algebra operations, so maybe my analogy isn't <em>that</em> out there. Let me give it a try.</p>
<h3>The Case of Vectors</h3>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, a vector is not "a list of numbers" but an abstract object with no predefined way to express it.</p>
<figure><img src="https://aethermug.com/assets/posts/linear-algebra-explains-why-some-words-are-effectively-untranslatable/vec_1.webp" alt="You can think of vectors as arrows floating in space. No numbers involved." title="Image of two vectors with the same origin but different directions, on a blank background. They are labeled a and b."><figcaption>You can think of vectors as arrows floating in space. No numbers involved.</figcaption></figure>
<p>But a vector is not very useful in this abstract state. We need a way to write it down so that we can manipulate it with algebra and communicate it to others. We do this by choosing a frame of reference—or, more accurately, a set of vectors to use as "basis" to quantify all others.</p>
<figure><img src="https://aethermug.com/assets/posts/linear-algebra-explains-why-some-words-are-effectively-untranslatable/vec_2.webp" alt="In the 2D case like this, if you set two vectors (e1 and e2) as the basis and decide that they have length 1, then you can find the coordinates of all other vectors based on their comparison to that basis. The basis vectors act as measuring sticks." title="Image of the same two vectors a and b, with the addition of two basis vectors titled e1 and e2 with the text 'length = 1'. Both the a and b vectors have lines projecting them perpendicularly against the e1 and e2 vectors, with numbers expressing what fraction of that vector's length the line intersects at."><figcaption>In the 2D case like this, if you set two vectors (e1 and e2) as the basis and decide that they have length 1, then you can find the coordinates of all other vectors based on their comparison to that basis. The basis vectors act as measuring sticks.</figcaption></figure>
<p>This is where numbers come into play. By projecting the vectors against the basis vectors, you can assign them lists of numbers (two numbers each, in this two-dimensional case):</p>
<span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="bold">a</mi><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo fence="true">(</mo><mtable rowspacing="0.16em" columnalign="center" columnspacing="1em"><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mn>0.5</mn></mstyle></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mn>0.7</mn></mstyle></mtd></mtr></mtable><mo fence="true">)</mo></mrow><mo separator="true">,</mo><mspace width="1em"></mspace><mi mathvariant="bold">b</mi><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo fence="true">(</mo><mtable rowspacing="0.16em" columnalign="center" columnspacing="1em"><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mn>0.8</mn></mstyle></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mn>0.3</mn></mstyle></mtd></mtr></mtable><mo fence="true">)</mo></mrow></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbf{a} = \begin{pmatrix} 0.5 \\ 0.7 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 0.8 \\ 0.3 \end{pmatrix}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>
<p>Those numbers are the <em>coordinates</em> of the vectors in that basis. For instance, the vector <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="bold">a</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbf{a}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> can be read as "<em>half as long as the <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant="bold">e</mi><mn mathvariant="bold">1</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbf{e_1}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> vector along the direction of <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant="bold">e</mi><mn mathvariant="bold">1</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbf{e_1}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, and <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>0.7</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">0.7</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> times as long as the <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant="bold">e</mi><mn mathvariant="bold">2</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbf{e_2}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> vector along the direction of <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant="bold">e</mi><mn mathvariant="bold">2</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbf{e_2}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></em>."</p>
<p>The important thing I want to convey here (and the last mathy thing to remember) is that if you were to choose a different basis, the same vector would have different coordinates.</p>
<figure><img src="https://aethermug.com/assets/posts/linear-algebra-explains-why-some-words-are-effectively-untranslatable/vec_3.webp" alt="Same vectors, different basis: the numbers are different." title="Image of the same two vectors a and b, this time with a different pair of perpendicular basis vectors titled u1 and u2 with a different angle respect to the two in the previous image. The text still says 'length = 1' for these basis vectors. The lines projecting a and b perpendicularly against the u1 and u2 vectors now show different numbers."><figcaption>Same vectors, different basis: the numbers are different.</figcaption></figure>
<p>In this new basis, the two vectors are written as:</p>
<span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="bold">a</mi><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo fence="true">(</mo><mtable rowspacing="0.16em" columnalign="center" columnspacing="1em"><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mn>0.8</mn></mstyle></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mn>0.2</mn></mstyle></mtd></mtr></mtable><mo fence="true">)</mo></mrow><mo separator="true">,</mo><mspace width="1em"></mspace><mi mathvariant="bold">b</mi><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo fence="true">(</mo><mtable rowspacing="0.16em" columnalign="center" columnspacing="1em"><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mn>0.8</mn></mstyle></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mo>−</mo><mn>0.2</mn></mrow></mstyle></mtd></mtr></mtable><mo fence="true">)</mo></mrow></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbf{a} = \begin{pmatrix} 0.8 \\ 0.2 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 0.8 \\ -0.2 \end{pmatrix}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>
<p>In short, change the basis (e.g. from "<span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant="bold">e</mi><mn mathvariant="bold">1</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbf{e_1}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> &amp; <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant="bold">e</mi><mn mathvariant="bold">2</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbf{e_2}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>" to  "<span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant="bold">u</mi><mn mathvariant="bold">1</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbf{u_1}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> &amp; <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant="bold">u</mi><mn mathvariant="bold">2</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbf{u_2}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>") and the same abstract object (vector) will be represented with different numbers. You can do all the same operations with them, like changing the vector's length and direction, calculating the angle between the vectors, and so on, and you'll get the same results in both bases, because they are operations on the same objects. The choice of basis is merely cosmetic from this point of view.</p>
<h3>The Case of Language</h3>
<p>Now let's turn to language and see the parallel.</p>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, a concept is not a word or a group of words but an abstract object in your mind.</p>
<figure><img src="https://aethermug.com/assets/posts/linear-algebra-explains-why-some-words-are-effectively-untranslatable/joukyou.webp" alt="A concept I have in mind now, shown as a drawing rather than words." title="AI drawing of a woman with a backpack walking under cherry blossoms, with a bullet train on the background."><figcaption>A concept I have in mind now, shown as a drawing rather than words.</figcaption></figure>
<p>But a concept is not very useful in this abstract state. We need a way to write it down so that we can manipulate it with grammar and communicate it to others. We do this by choosing a language that is shared with the receiver of the message.</p>
<p>For the concept in my head right now, and choosing the English language to represent it, you get this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>"Going to Tokyo"</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is where words come into play. By projecting the abstract idea onto the standard English vocabulary and grammar, you can assign it a list of words:</p>
<span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><semantics><mrow><mtext>💭</mtext><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo fence="true">(</mo><mtable rowspacing="0.16em" columnalign="center" columnspacing="1em"><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mtext>Going</mtext></mstyle></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mtext>to</mtext></mstyle></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mtext>Tokyo</mtext></mstyle></mtd></mtr></mtable><mo fence="true">)</mo></mrow></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">💭 = \begin{pmatrix} \text{Going} \\ \text{to} \\ \text{Tokyo} \end{pmatrix}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>
<p>Those words are the equivalent of the coordinates of the vectors in linear algebra. The way I just wrote it is not accurate, though, because it makes it look as if English only had 3 dimensions (3 words), just like the 2-element vectors were 2-dimensional. English actually has hundreds of thousands of words,  so we would need a vector that long to fully represent it, with blank spaces for all the words that aren't involved in this case.</p>
<span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><semantics><mrow><mtext>💭</mtext><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo fence="true">(</mo><mtable rowspacing="0.16em" columnalign="center" columnspacing="1em"><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mtext>Going</mtext></mstyle></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mtext>to</mtext></mstyle></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mtext>Tokyo</mtext></mstyle></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mi mathvariant="normal">∅</mi></mstyle></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mi mathvariant="normal">∅</mi></mstyle></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mi mathvariant="normal">∅</mi></mstyle></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">⋮</mi><mpadded height="0em" voffset="0em"><mspace mathbackground="black" width="0em" height="1.5em"></mspace></mpadded></mrow></mstyle></mtd></mtr></mtable><mo fence="true">)</mo></mrow></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">💭 = \begin{pmatrix} \text{Going} \\ \text{to} \\ \text{Tokyo} \\ \emptyset \\ \emptyset \\ \emptyset \\ \vdots \end{pmatrix}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>
<p>The English language offers its speakers many other words, like <em>camel</em>, <em>frolic</em>, and <em>or</em>, but in this case none of them was necessary to express the idea that was in my mind, so they remain empty (<span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∅</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\emptyset</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>) and absent from my utterance of "going to Tokyo".</p>
<hr><figure id="floating-1"><img src="https://aethermug.com/assets/posts/linear-algebra-explains-why-some-words-are-effectively-untranslatable/vackground-com-F0qfw5H-pUU-unsplash.webp" alt="Abstract mosaic of irregular polygons in purple, pink, and white"><figcaption>Image by vackground.com, Unsplash</figcaption></figure>
<p>Of course, similar to vectors with bases, you can express the same concept in a different language. If I chose Italian as the "basis", you'd get:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>"Andare a Tokio"</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The concept is the same, but now its representation (its "word coordinates") is different:</p>
<span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><semantics><mrow><mtext>💭</mtext><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo fence="true">(</mo><mtable rowspacing="0.16em" columnalign="center" columnspacing="1em"><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mtext>Andare</mtext></mstyle></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mtext>a</mtext></mstyle></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mtext>Tokio</mtext></mstyle></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mi mathvariant="normal">∅</mi></mstyle></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mi mathvariant="normal">∅</mi></mstyle></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mi mathvariant="normal">∅</mi></mstyle></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">⋮</mi><mpadded height="0em" voffset="0em"><mspace mathbackground="black" width="0em" height="1.5em"></mspace></mpadded></mrow></mstyle></mtd></mtr></mtable><mo fence="true">)</mo></mrow></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">💭 = \begin{pmatrix} \text{Andare} \\ \text{a} \\ \text{Tokio} \\ \emptyset \\ \emptyset \\ \emptyset \\ \vdots \end{pmatrix}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>
<p>You can, in theory, say those two different sequences of sounds in those two languages, and obtain the same effect in the mind of the receiver. The only requirement is that all people involved know both languages.</p>
<h3>Cosmetics Matter</h3>
<p>Alright, the parallel seems plain enough. Sadly, expressing all language in that vector-like format would use up a lot of ink and is not really practical for everyday use. (LLMs kind of achieve that feat, but in a more convoluted and definitely not human-readable way.)</p>
<p>Why do I think it is interesting, then? Because "untranslatable" words exist.</p>
<p>The words that people sometimes call "untranslatable" are terms that have a clear and widely understood meaning in one language, but no equivalent in another one. I gave <a href="https://aethermug.com/posts/is-there-anything-untranslatable">some examples</a> from Japanese before, and the web is awash with blog posts <a href="https://www.rocketlanguages.com/blog/20-of-the-worlds-most-beautiful-untranslatable-words" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">enumerating</a> curious words like that from many other languages. The key takeaway is that what only takes a single word in Language 1 can only be expressed with some accuracy in Language 2 if you use many words to explain them in all of their facets.</p>
<p>I wrote that the choice of basis in linear algebra is "cosmetic", because the result of an operation on vectors does not change depending on the basis. But that is only the ideal, mathematical way to look at it. We humans are not so ideal. We are weak and fallible and sometimes we even stink.</p>
<p>Which vector representation do you like better between these two?</p>
<span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="bold">v</mi><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo fence="true">(</mo><mtable rowspacing="0.16em" columnalign="center" columnspacing="1em"><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mn>0.498213</mn></mstyle></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mn>0.731212</mn></mstyle></mtd></mtr></mtable><mo fence="true">)</mo></mrow></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 0.498213 \\ 0.731212 \end{pmatrix}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>

<p>Both represent the same vector under different bases, because I chose a base that has the vector <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="bold">v</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbf{v}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> <em>as one of the basis vectors</em>. Here is what the two cases look like graphically:</p>
<figure><img src="https://aethermug.com/assets/posts/linear-algebra-explains-why-some-words-are-effectively-untranslatable/vec_4.webp" alt="Left: a vector in a generic basis, with both components not zero. Right: the same vector in a basis where it is itself one of the basis vectors. In this case, the coordinates are 1 on the first component e1 (it is &quot;one times&quot; itself) and 0 on the other (there is &quot;nothing to project&quot; on it)." title="Images of a vector under two bases, shown side by side. One represents the vector in a generic basis, similar to the previous examples. The other shows the same vector in a basis where one of the basis vectors coincides exactly with the vector v. In this second case the projection onto the other basis vector is zero."><figcaption>Left: a vector in a generic basis, with both components not zero. Right: the same vector in a basis where it is itself one of the basis vectors. In this case, the coordinates are 1 on the first component e1 (it is "one times" itself) and 0 on the other (there is "nothing to project" on it).</figcaption></figure>
<p><em>In theory</em>, both representations are exactly equivalent to each other. A computer wouldn't have any preference. But the second representation, the clean one with a simple one and zero, is not only easier to remember and grasp for a person, but it is also easier to handle mathematically. Things simplify easily with it, everything that is multiplied by zero becomes zero, and similarly for the multiplications by one. The calculations proceed faster and with fewer errors.</p>
<p>This means that, at least for our feeble organic minds, the choice of basis does matter.</p>
<p>The same holds for language. A concept that took several words in English...</p>

<p>Looking at it in the other direction, a native word in one language is like one of its "basis vectors"—simple and straightforward—but the underlying concept might need to be "spread out" onto several words when applying a different language (i.e. "basis").</p>
<p>Arguably, having a compact word makes it easier not only to express the concept, but also to think about it. This is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Linguistic_relativity" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sapir-Whorf debate</a>, but I'll leave that for another day. Instead, I want to show you what this means for untranslatability, because there are people who vehemently deny their existence.</p>
<h3>Losing in Translation</h3>
<p>I think there are two ways in which this analogy makes it quite obvious that "practical untranslatability" is a thing.</p>
<p>First, communication is costly, and we don't have infinite time and space to put in all the words that are needed. Even if the word could <em>in theory</em> be explained in the other language, usually it's not worth it.</p>
<p>For example, the Japanese term <em>mono no aware</em> (物の哀れ) could be rather accurately translated as</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a gentle, poignant sadness or pathos felt in response to the transient nature of all things, a deep awareness of their impermanence that evokes a subtle, bittersweet sorrow and a profound, quiet empathy for their passing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a dictionary, perhaps that's okay. But a dictionary is not translation. Translation is about conveying the meaning of full texts, and you can't do that kind of multi-line expansion for every word.</p>
<p>And so the translator simplifies it to the gist, e.g. as <em>the pathos of all things</em>. This conveys the majority of the meaning and it is usually enough, but it does lose a lot in the process.</p>
<p>This is exactly analogous to the data analysis technique called Principal Component Analysis (PCA), where one simplifies a vector by picking only its largest coordinates and disregarding all others. This means choosing a subset of the basis vectors that are more closely aligned with the vectors of interest, and ignoring the existence of the other basis vectors, effectively reducing the dimensions of the data. Translators use a version of PCA every time they (begrudgingly) accept to leave the finer nuances of a concept unsaid for the sake of space.</p>
<p>But, even assuming you <em>do</em> have time to explicate, using many more words increases the risk of introducing unintended nuances that come bundled with those extra words. This is like doing PCA but selecting inappropriate basis vectors, which introduce lots of small errors in the calculation of the vector's coordinates. Is "sorrow" too emotionally charged in that long translation of <em>mono no aware</em>? Does the use of "passing" unnecessarily remind English speakers of people dying?</p>
<p>You eventually hit diminishing returns: using more words confuses the reader instead of clarifying things further.</p>

<p>The second problem with translation is precision. Even if you can use many words, and even if none of those are misleading, words are still finite in number. Unlike ideal numerical coordinates, which can take any value down to the finest detail, you only have a small selection of words to convey a given bit of meaning.</p>
<p>Suppose you realize that the word "subtle" is not accurate enough in the "...evokes a subtle, bittersweet" part of the translation above. Maybe you do want to convey subtlety, but feel that the simple word "subtle" feels too strong in this case. You might try to soften it with an adverb, like "somewhat subtle" or "slightly subtle", but there aren't many other options out there. What if none of them is perfect for your current needs?</p>
<p>In this sense, language is "quantized": you can jump from one level of intensity of some meaning to the next, but you can't express anything in between.</p>
<p>This is a problem shared by all computers. Unlike ideal numbers, the numbers in a processor necessarily have a finite number of decimal places. So when you want to work with the ideal vector</p>

<p>(Modern computers can usually handle many more digits than that, but you get the idea.)</p>
<p>Graphically, it looks something like this:</p>

<p>(Incidentally, AI engineers sometimes intentionally quantize large language models to make them take up less memory, but this tends to make them dumber, because they lose nuance.)</p>
<p>With language, like with computers, we're forced to "lower the resolution" of our concepts whenever we put them into words. This happens twice in translated text: once when the author first writes down their thoughts, then once more when the translator transports that already-degraded concept into a different language with different "quantization steps".</p>
<h3>Between the Lines</h3>
<p>I hope these rather unorthodox leaps between linguistics and mathematics helped make it almost obvious that some words and ideas are untranslatable <em>in practice</em>. I also hope you don't take the analogy <em>too</em> seriously, because it won't go much further than this. You might be tempted to begin talking about "word matrices" and whatnot, but I doubt it would help clarify things. That kind of advanced linear algebra with concepts might work for LLMs, but it doesn't seem to map to anything intelligible for a human being, not to mention make you any wiser.</p>
<p>Besides, language has something going for it that doesn't seem to have a mathematical equivalent: what does it mean to "read between the lines"?</p>
<p>It's hard to pin down, but I think it has to do with the <em>structure</em> and <em>context</em> of the words communicating something that is not contained in any of the words themselves. Perhaps it is the clever use of those "negligible coordinates"—the fringe nuances—of words scattered around the text to produce a collective effect on the reader.</p>
<p>A good translator might not be able to exactly translate a given word or sentence, but they might be able to "write between the lines" so that it doesn't matter very much. ●</p>
