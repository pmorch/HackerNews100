<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div aria-label="Content">
        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>a kind reader reached out about <a href="https://blog.greg.technology/2024/01/01/all-of-my-iphone-alarms.html">all of my iphone alarms</a> and asked how specifically did I run OCR on my mac. I’m not one to gatekeep, so here’s how you can get yourself a nice local ocr ‘service’ that works in the terminal/CLI/python and costs 0 dollars:</p>

<ul>
  <li>((by the way sharing Shortcuts <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/03/24/icloud-shortcut-sharing-broken/">is really weird</a> which is why I’m having you do this all manually…))</li>
  <li>(also, most of the stuff below only needs to be done once – after that, actually ocr’ing is easy)</li>
  <li>open the <strong>Shortcuts</strong> app in your Applications folder</li>
  <li>click the “<strong>+</strong>” button to create a new shortcut</li>
  <li>in the right sidebar, search for “<strong>extract text</strong>”</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://blog.greg.technology/assets/how-to-ocr/step1.png"></p>

<ul>
  <li>you should see “<strong>Extract Text from Image</strong>” in the list of possible actions. <strong>drag it</strong> from the right sidebar into the main area on the left</li>
  <li>in the “Extract text from …” action that’s now on the left, click on the pale “<strong>Image</strong>” blue-ish pill</li>
  <li>pick “<strong>Shortcut Input</strong>”</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://blog.greg.technology/assets/how-to-ocr/step2.png"></p>

<ul>
  <li>you’ll see a big “<strong>Receive <em>Any</em> input from <em>Nowhere</em></strong>” action appear above the “Extract text from Shortcut Input”. it’s all good, leave it as is</li>
  <li>in the right sidebar, search for “<strong>copy</strong>”. you should see “<strong>Copy to Clipboard</strong>”. drag that action below the “<strong>Extract text from …</strong>” one
    <ul>
      <li>dragging the “Copy to …” action below the “Extract from …” is really annoyingly hard. just keep dragging it <em>really</em> below and it will work at some point</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>your final setup should look like this:</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://blog.greg.technology/assets/how-to-ocr/step3.png"></p>

<ul>
  <li>in the last action, make sure that after “<strong>Copy</strong>” it does say “<strong>Text from Image</strong>”!</li>
  <li>you’re like almost done!!</li>
  <li>in the window title bar, type stuff to name the shortcut. because <a href="https://twitter.com/TheIdOfAlan/status/1458117496087748618">I’m from a generation</a>, I recommend naming it “extract-text” or “ocr-text” or something simple with no spaces and all lowercase. sorry. <strong>press enter</strong> after naming the shortcut otherwise it won’t remember the name (…??)</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://blog.greg.technology/assets/how-to-ocr/step4.png"></p>

<ul>
  <li>ok you may be actually done here I think</li>
  <li>try out the shortcut in your terminal:</li>
</ul>

<div><pre><code>shortcuts run ocr-text <span>-i</span> &lt;A PATH TO SOME IMAGE&gt;
</code></pre></div>

<ul>
  <li>then try <strong>command-V</strong> – do you see the resulting text? if yes, you’re good to go!!!</li>
  <li>from python, you can do the following:</li>
</ul>

<div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>subprocess</span>

<span>file_path</span> <span>=</span> <span>'... some file path ...'</span>
<span>ocr_out</span> <span>=</span> <span>subprocess</span><span>.</span><span>check_output</span><span>(</span>
    <span>f</span><span>'shortcuts run ocr-text -i "</span><span>{</span><span>file_path</span><span>}</span><span>"'</span><span>,</span> <span>shell</span><span>=</span><span>True</span>
<span>)</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>ocr_out</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<ul>
  <li>THAT’S IT! x</li>
</ul>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.daemonology.net/blog/2023-12-31-Canadian-payroll-dependency-chart.html">https://www.daemonology.net/blog/2023-12-31-Canadian-payroll-dependency-chart.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38843388">Hacker News</a></p>

<p>
The Canada Revenue Agency publishes, on a regular basis (they're now up to
the 119th edition), a document entitled
<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/payroll/t4127-payroll-deductions-formulas/t4127-jan/t4127-jan-payroll-deductions-formulas-computer-programs.html">"Payroll
Deductions Formulas"</a>.  This document contains all of the formulas needed
to calculate payroll deductions collected by the CRA: Canada Pension Plan,
Employment Insurance, and Income Tax.  As someone running a
<a href="https://www.tarsnap.com/">small business in Canada</a> and not wanting
to use an external payroll provider, I implement these formulas myself in a
spreadsheet.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, like most aspects of the tax system, this steadily increases
in complexity, and this year with the Canada Pension Plan including not just
"base" premiums and "additional" premiums but also "second additional
premiums", I needed to rewrite my spreadsheet from scratch; and also very
unfortunately, the authors of the document have failed to grasp an essential
detail of software: You have to calculate values before you use them.  This
results in a document requiring constant jumping back and forth to find
where each value is calculated — before <i>or after</i> it is used.
</p><p>
To help myself keep everything straight, I decided to draw a dependency chart
using GraphViz.  There are 79 nodes in the graph, starting with values like
"Year's Annual Maximum Pensionable Earnings" ($73200 in the 2024 tax year),
and ending up with "Total payroll deductions".  Note that I did not write the
formulas onto the chart — I simply recorded which other values they
depend upon, so someone (aka myself) looking at the chart can figure out
what to calculate first without going around in circles.
</p><p>
Oh, and to keep things simple, I assumed I wasn't dealing with commissioned
employees, employees entering or exiting the Canada Pension Plan, or anyone
resident in Quebec, Nova Scotia, Yukon, or Ontario (each of which has their
own special tax complications).

I've been working in IT security consulting for about two years since graduating with a masters in Computer Science specialized in IT-Security.

Understanding whatever I do all the way down to the RFC and thinking of every possible thing that could go wrong or be abused are core security principles for me. Boring, standardized and automated is the way any system should be run.</p><p>I run my own hypervisor at home for fun and spent many years developing Open Source Minecraft Plugins and writing my own Minecraft client from scratch. I like to spend my free time tinkering with technology and learning something new.</p><p>Specifically looking for a 100% remote job, though occasional travel is okay.

I learned how to code while I was recovering from a motorcycle accident and since then have continued to challenge myself in various roles.

From improving legacy infra and processes in an established telco company to scaling a fast-moving startup from 200K to 2M users.

Another particular interest is in B2C businesses where the 'C' is software developers. I'd love to chat and network about opportunities; if you think you have a product that could benefit from my skill set, drop me a line!

Hey there. I hope you're having a great start to the new year.<p>My name is Koray. I’ve been programming since I was ten years old, starting with computer magazines. It quickly turned into my career, and I've had the opportunity to work in various companies since I was 16.</p><p>Eight years ago, at the age of 23, I started my first company. Since then, I've been involved in different roles, primarily focusing on technical product leadership and cross-platform application development. Some of the products I have built and helped build have been embraced by millions of users, received awards, and consistently maintained high rankings on app stores.</p><p>Recently, my latest pursuit came to an end due to funding constraints. Now, I'm excited to explore new opportunities where I can wear different hats. I'm open to any industry and I'm technology-agnostic.</p><p>I love learning new things and have a wide range of interests, including 3D printing, IoT, and home automation. On a fun note, I also collect vinyls, synthesisers and groove boxes.</p><p>You can find additional information on my website and CV. If there is a match, let's chat!

Always happy to pick up new stuff if necessary if my experience looks like a good fit. Hoping to continue to grow into more leadership positions, but I'm amenable to anything so long as it drives successful business outcomes. I've generally been moved between teams to help mentor junior engineers, and solve any sticky problems that others have struggled with. I'm also comfortable wearing many hats including Product management, Product management, Architecture, and the list goes on.</p><p>Look forward to hearing from you soon!

So basically I have my bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering and started out as an energy engineer but pivoted to software development. I got my masters in computer science and I am now working as a contractor for a Big 3 Automotive company in their embedded software group. It's fun, but I am looking at other options since they're making us come back into the office this year. I would be open to working in an office, but it has to be the right location.<p>I would love a role where I can learn more, diversify my skills, and have some cool stories to tell.

Hi! My name's Nathan Douglas, and I'm a squishy generalist; I prefer SRE/platform engineering/DevOps-as-a-role but I've been fighting with computers for about 30 years now and I've done a little of everything. I tend to be the guy who debugs the Hard Problems, because I'm tenacious and a bit obsessive. I love DevOps-as-a-methodology because I love studying processes, creating value stream maps, identifying, planning, and implementing improvements, etc. But I also love the role because when something happens on a running server, I'm fairly good at staying calm, figuring out what's causing the problem, and fixing it.</span></p></div></td></tr>

Hi, my name is Eli. I've worked for years as a fully remote Python programmer for a very large financial institution in their cybersecurity department. I'm ready for something new.<p>I took some time off starting at the end of August to evaluate my options. I was going to go back to grad school to study AI, but I've realized that many of the foremost AI researchers right now are in the industry, not necessarily at Stanford or CMU. I am interested in working with these people to help propel the field of AI forward, in whichever way I can contribute. My educational background is in Math and Biology.

Hello! I am a software engineer with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, more than 10 years of experience and 10 professional certifications earned after a lot of study and hard work.<p>You can see several technologies in the above list but I personally prefer to work with anything related to the Rust Programming Language. Backend? Blockchain? Compilers? DevOps? Embedded? Mobile? I am totally onboard as long as you have a little bit of Rust involved.</p><p>For more information, take a look at my CV (<a href="https://c410-f3r.github.io/curriculum.pdf" rel="nofollow">https://c410-f3r.github.io/curriculum.pdf</a>) or my GitHub account (<a href="https://github.com/c410-f3r">https://github.com/c410-f3r</a>).

Each step in that process sheds more light on what is possible, what the requirements and scopes of the projects actually are, and what changes and alterations to the design should be made. In my experience following an iterative, agile approach where product owners are kept in-the-loop throughout the entire dev cycle results is vastly better products.</p><p>I'm very good at getting up to speed with new technologies and requirements and thrive solving difficult or nebulous problems. My development background has required me to pick up a broad range of skills and to tackle a broad range of problems from security design to debugging and patching 3rd-party libraries. It's my policy to try and leave teams, products, and codebases in a better position and in a better condition than I found them.</p><p>I am currently interested in both consulting and contracting roles. My dev process when contracting is very similar to how I approach consulting tasks; I believe there's a huge value add in making sure that development processes are tightly integrated into the planning and design of features, products, and architecture. If you have an interesting problem to solve, I'd love to get in touch :)

A little about myself: My CV is not up to date, I have been working as non-founding CTO for a smaller games company for the last 18 months. During this time I have been responsible for 12 direct reports and 25-ish indirect reports. I've revamped and refined the technology direction (going from an outsourced tech prototype to a beta-released quality product), grown the team (and culture) from 4 persons to a 50 person startup, including managing software licensing and budgeting, I have lead direction on the behaviour of online systems, conformance testing for non-PC platforms.<p>I also acted as legal guarantor, streamlined developer productivity with better (and easier to collaborate) tools including a migration from Office365 to Google Workspace, Bitbucket-&gt;Gitlab, SVN-&gt;Perforce Helix (game studio, of course) and standardised on an IDE platform that supports remote and live collaborative development, I have acted as mentor to over 4 people in very disparate areas of the tech organisation (Build Engineering, Gameplay programming, tools programming and online backend team). I have also been the person primarily responsible for creating realistic milestones while taking into consideration our limited capacity and externally communicated ambitious deadlines -- without the expertise of a project manager or producer. -- all of this in a fully remote environment.</p><p>I seem to be received well as a senior manager, based on what my reports say to the head of operations at least, but I prefer going technically deep on topics and not spending all my time in more high level areas (and meetings). In my professional life I have had success as an SRE-type person but would prefer perhaps to work in developer experience or backend programming roles.</p><p>I have previously released games as part of a very small  Live Operations team such as: "Tom Clancy's The Division" and it's sequel "The Division 2"; as part of Ubisoft/Massive and I released "Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodhunt" as part of Tencent/Sharkmob. Before this I worked in eCommerce. In all positions I was SRE. Ask me about the depth of my automation if you want war stories. :)</p><p>I have gone extremely deep into linux system internals, databases and networking. My knowledge of Rust and Python is strong but my Go is a little lackluster unfortunately as on a personal level I dislike its slice mutability semantics and propensity for data races (which do not exist in Rust and is something that the GIL outright kills in Python)</p><p>I'm open to relocation, and even taking a pretty drastic pay cut as I'm currently paid as a CTO.. What I really need is a culture of trust and autonomy, as I have strong intrinsic motivation and a decent amount of skill but unfortunately I dislike politics and bureaucracy.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.biia.com/japan-goes-all-in-copyright-doesnt-apply-to-ai-training/">https://www.biia.com/japan-goes-all-in-copyright-doesnt-apply-to-ai-training/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38842788">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-106014">
														
							
														
							
														
							<div>
									<p><span>In a surprising move, Japan’s government recently reaffirmed that it will not enforce copyrights on data used in AI training. The policy allows AI to use any data <a href="https://www.biia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Keiko_Nagaoka_20151102_cropped-600x800-1-e1687193572247.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.biia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Keiko_Nagaoka_20151102_cropped-600x800-1-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="165" height="220" data-src="https://www.biia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Keiko_Nagaoka_20151102_cropped-600x800-1-225x300.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></a>“regardless of whether it is for non-profit or commercial purposes, whether it is an act other than reproduction, or whether it is content obtained from illegal sites or otherwise.” <strong>Keiko Nagaoka, Japanese Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology</strong>,&nbsp;<a href="https://go2senkyo.com/seijika/122181/posts/685617" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a>&nbsp;the bold stance to local meeting, saying that Japan’s laws won’t protect copyrighted materials used in AI datasets.</span></p>

<p><span>English language coverage of the situation is sparse. It seems the Japanese government believes copyright worries, particularly those linked to anime and other visual media, have held back the nation’s progress in AI technology. In response, Japan is going all-in, opting for a no-copyright approach to remain competitive.</span></p>
<p><span>This news is part of Japan’s ambitious plan to become a leader in AI technology. Rapidus, a local tech firm known for its advanced 2nm chip technology, is stepping into the spotlight as a serious contender in the world of AI chips. With Taiwan’s political situation looking unstable, Japanese chip manufacturing could be a safer bet. Japan is also stepping up to help shape the global rules for AI systems within the G-7.</span></p>
<h2><span>Artists vs. Business (Artists Lost)</span></h2>
<p><span>Not everyone in Japan is on board with this decision. Many anime and graphic art creators are concerned that AI could lower the value of their work. But in contrast, the academic and business sectors are pressing the government to use the nation’s relaxed data laws to propel Japan to global AI dominance.</span></p>
<p><span>Despite having the world’s third-largest economy, Japan’s economic growth has been sluggish since the 1990s. Japan has the lowest per-capita income in the G-7. With the effective implementation of AI, it could potentially boost the nation’s GDP by 50% or more in a short time. For Japan, which has been experiencing years of low growth, this is an exciting prospect.</span></p>
<h2><span>It’s All About The Data</span></h2>
<p><span>Western data access is also key to Japan’s AI ambitions. The more high-quality training data available, the better the AI model. While Japan boasts a long-standing literary tradition, the amount of Japanese language training data is significantly less than the English language resources available in the West. However, Japan is home to a wealth of anime content, which is popular globally. It seems Japan’s stance is clear – if the West uses Japanese culture for AI training, Western literary resources should also be available for Japanese AI.</span></p>
<h2><span>What This Means For The World</span></h2>
<p><span><strong>On a global scale, Japan’s move adds a twist to the regulation debate</strong>. Current discussions have focused on a “rogue nation” scenario where a less developed country might disregard a global framework to gain an advantage. But with Japan, we see a different dynamic. <strong>The world’s third-largest economy is saying it won’t hinder AI research and development. Plus, it’s prepared to leverage this new technology to compete directly with the West</strong>.</span></p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://chrisnicholas.dev/blog/a-new-blog-for-2024">https://chrisnicholas.dev/blog/a-new-blog-for-2024</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38842116">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>It’s been a <em>long time</em> since I’ve published a blog post, two whole years. Part of the reason is that it took too much effort to create posts for my previous blog. I needed better DX. A few nights ago, feeling inspired after reading articles by <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" href="https://ped.ro/writing/website-refresh-2023" data-headlessui-state="">Pedro Duarte</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" href="https://rauno.me/craft/vercel" data-headlessui-state="">Rauno Freiberg</a>, and <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" href="https://leerob.io/blog/2023" data-headlessui-state="">Lee Robinson</a>, I decided it was time to start over.</p>

<p>So here’s the score—I want a blog with great DX that makes it as easy as possible to create posts. I also want to go <em>minimal</em>, so I can get away with a single design on mobile and desktop. No faffing around; I want this blog built and published in 5 days! And lastly, I’m looking to try some new libraries and technologies. Right, let’s dive in.</p>

<p>At work I spend most of my time <a data-headlessui-state="" href="https://chrisnicholas.dev/work">writing and programming</a>, so dipping my toes into design was a nice change. Here’s a couple of details.</p>

<p>For the header, I was aiming for an animated background that combined an <em>aurora</em>, <em>light beams</em>, and a <em>rainbow</em>. I’m quite pleased with the result, and it's actually pure CSS—try changing <code><span><span>hue</span><span>-</span><span>rotate</span></span></code> below to emulate the animation.</p>
<figure><figcaption>An interactive demo showing the header background</figcaption><pre><code>.aurora <!-- -->{<br>  <!-- -->filter:<!-- --> <span>hue-rotate(<!-- -->0<!-- -->deg)</span> <span>saturate(<!-- -->7.0<!-- -->)</span> <span>blur(<!-- -->30<!-- -->px)</span>;<br>}</code></pre><div><p><label for="change-aurora-hue"><code>hue-rotate</code></label><label for="change-aurora-saturate"><code>saturate</code></label><label for="change-aurora-blur"><code>blur</code></label></p></div></figure>
<h3 id="saturated-text"><a href="#saturated-text">Saturated text</a></h3>
<p>All text that overlays the aurora is saturated with its underlying colours—a tiny touch that really unifies the design. You can do this by simply applying a <code><span><span>luminosity</span></span></code> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" href="https://www.ctnicholas.dev/articles/which-blend-mode" data-headlessui-state="">blend mode</a> to the text.</p>
<figure><div><p>My name’s Chris Nicholas</p></div><div data-slot="field" data-headlessui-state=""><p><span data-slot="control" id="headlessui-control-:R8lmuuuela:" role="checkbox" aria-checked="true" tabindex="0" data-headlessui-state="checked" data-checked=""><span><svg viewBox="0 0 14 14" fill="none"><path d="M3 8L6 11L11 3.5" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"></path><path d="M3 7H11" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"></path></svg></span></span><label data-slot="label" id="headlessui-label-:R9olmuuuela:" for="headlessui-control-:R8lmuuuela:" data-headlessui-state=""><code>mix-blend-mode: luminosity;</code></label></p></div></figure>
<h3 id="noise"><a href="#noise">Noise</a></h3>
<p>I’m applying a tiny amount of film grain to the <code><span><span>body</span></span></code>. To me, this makes the page feel like one consistent piece; as you scroll down, the noise sticks to the content, somewhat similar to seeing texture on paper.</p>
<figure><figcaption>An interactive demo allowing you to change the noise level on the page</figcaption><pre><code>.noise <!-- -->{<br>  <!-- -->opacity:<!-- --> <span>0.018</span>;<br>}</code></pre><p><label for="change-noise-opacity"><code>opacity</code></label></p></figure>
<p>I wouldn’t recommend noise for most websites, and it’s very easy to overdo it, but I enjoy the subtle filmic effect on my blog.</p>
<h3 id="catalyst"><a href="#catalyst">Catalyst</a></h3>
<p>I’m using <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" href="https://tailwindcss.com/blog/introducing-catalyst" data-headlessui-state="">Catalyst</a>, a new UI kit by the Tailwind team. It’s clear that a tonne of thought has gone into making these components accessible, and pixel perfect, on both light and dark modes.</p>
<figure><figcaption>Tailwind UI Catalyst demo</figcaption><div><p><span>badge</span><span data-slot="control" aria-label="Example checkbox" id="headlessui-checkbox-:R2p3muuuela:" role="checkbox" aria-checked="true" tabindex="0" data-headlessui-state="checked" data-checked=""><span><svg viewBox="0 0 14 14" fill="none"><path d="M3 8L6 11L11 3.5" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"></path><path d="M3 7H11" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"></path></svg></span></span></p></div></figure>
<p>Catalyst provides you with a set of files to download into your project, and you can export your components from these. <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" href="https://heroicons.com/" data-headlessui-state="">Heroicons</a> has also been updated with new icons that fit neatly into Catalyst.</p>

<pre><code><span><span>import</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>Button</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>../components/Button</span><span>"</span><span>;</span><span></span></span>

<span><span>	</span><span></span></span>

<span><span>  </span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span></code></pre>
<p>If you’d like to customise your components further, you can edit the downloaded files directly. Each file contains <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" href="https://headlessui.com/" data-headlessui-state="">Headless UI</a> components with lists of carefully annotated classes dispersed throughout.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>&lt;</span><span>HeadlessListBoxButton</span><span></span></span>
<span><span>  </span><span>className</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>clsx</span><span>(</span><span></span></span>

<span><span>  </span><span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span><span></span></span>
<span><span>/&gt;</span><span></span></span></code></pre>
<p>Catalyst is still in alpha, so be warned, breaking changes will most likely be ahead!</p>
<h3 id="twc"><a href="#twc">TWC</a></h3>
<p>While we’re talking about Tailwind, I’ve used a new library called <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" href="https://react-twc.vercel.app/" data-headlessui-state="">TWC</a> to save time building reusable components. It takes boilerplate code you've written countless times (forwarding refs, adding <code><span><span>clsx</span></span></code>, etc.), and makes it a one-liner.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>Card</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>twc</span><span>.</span><span>div</span><span>`</span><span>rounded-lg border bg-slate-100 text-white shadow-sm</span><span>`</span><span>;</span><span></span></span>

<h3 id="nextjs"><a href="#nextjs">Next.js</a></h3>
<p>I’ve used <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" href="https://nextjs.org/" data-headlessui-state="">Next.js</a> to build my new blog, and virtually every component is a server component. It feels pretty snappy, I like it.</p>
<h4>Layout files</h4>
<p>Did you notice that the header animation continues running when you change pages? That’s because it’s placed in a Next.js <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" href="https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts#layout-pattern" data-headlessui-state="">layout file</a>, meaning it doesn’t get refreshed on route changes.</p>

<h4>OG image generation</h4>
<p>A major pain point on my previous blog was manually creating each social media image. Nowadays, you can <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" href="https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/metadata/opengraph-image" data-headlessui-state="">generate OpenGraph images dynamically</a> in Next.js, and it’s very little effort to get started.</p>

Initially, the images that flashed before her eyes were beautiful: fountains of colors, fields of tulips, peacock feathers. Then they turned dark: monsters, claws, demonic eyes, vampires. She saw kings and beggars dead, buried, eaten by worms, providing food for animals and eventually for other people. “Imagine the countless atoms of our ancestors in this perpetual motion!” she cried aloud, describing everything she saw to another patient, sitting beside her bed.</p><p>Hana had a troubled life. Born in 1949, she grew up in a town south of Prague, in a family crushed by poverty. When Hana was a child, her father drank and her spiteful mother often hit her for wetting the bed. At school, classmates teased her for wearing secondhand clothes, which were often damp because she was too shy to ask permission to go to the bathroom. In her teens, she was lonely and angry, so tormented by vivid dreams of murdering her enemies that she asked to be hospitalized. At 18, she married a boy she barely knew, separated from him after four months, and then tried to kill herself by swallowing 30 sleeping pills.</p><div><figure><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Karel_%C5%A0ebek_in_Lochovice" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img decoding="async" width="800" height="563" src="https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Hana-K.jpg" alt=""></a><figcaption>Hana K.

Although intelligent, she was also considered hopelessly psychotic. But in 1969, when she faced another return to Dobřany, Hana told her family doctor she would rather kill herself — and this time the doctor referred her to the 112-bed clinic at Sadská, a facility east of Prague specializing in repeated sessions of LSD psychotherapy, directed by the psychiatrist Milan Hausner (1929–2000).</p><p>Hausner originally doubted that she could be helped. But as he listened to a recording of Hana’s third LSD session, he saw some hope. “The most pronounced aspect of this session is her archetypal regression into the realm of antiquity and to the very beginnings of humanity,” Hausner later wrote. “Hana is beginning to formulate a new attitude toward death and eternity.”</p><p>Over the next six months, Hana had 20 more sessions of LSD. Hausner told her that she might need 60 to be cured.</p><hr><p>As Sarah Marks and others have <a href="https://journals.openedition.org/monderusse/8165" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">detailed</a>, psychiatry in communist Europe was not merely an obedient lapdog to the Pavlovian conditioning promoted by the Soviet Union. It was far more varied and complex — and certainly one of its most unusual chapters concerns the use of LSD psychotherapy in 1960s Czechoslovakia, when that country’s progression to a more humane government, its increasing openness to Western Europe, and its developments in psychiatry and pharmacology all coincided with a worldwide curiosity about psychedelic drugs.</p><figure><blockquote><p>The drug was a “probe into the subconscious,” Hausner wrote — and “the probe goes very deep, often into the first days of life, if not further.”</p></blockquote></figure><p>Until recently, LSD therapy in Czechoslovakia was known mainly through the work of Stanislav Grof (1931–), who practiced at Prague’s Psychiatric Research Institute, moved to the U.S. in 1967, and is today celebrated as one of the founders of transpersonal psychology. But dozens of other Czech and Slovak psychiatrists also used LSD in psychotherapy, and the most dedicated and outspoken of them was Hausner, who supervised more than 3,000 LSD sessions, published research in more than 100 articles and books, and yet remains largely unknown, even in his homeland.</p><p>Hausner grew up in Prague, the only child of an insurance clerk and a pharmacist. He was drawn to the healing arts early: In May 1945, during the uprising against Nazi Germany’s occupation of Czechoslovakia, he cared for fighters at Prague’s barricades. Germany had closed Czech universities during the six-year occupation, so after the war, the need for young doctors was acute, and in 1948 — the same year the communists seized control of Czechoslovakia’s government — Hausner enrolled in medicine at Prague’s Charles University. After graduating in 1953, he practiced psychiatry in various places around the country, including a children’s hospital. He married Zdena Procházková, a medical statistician, completed his compulsory military service, and by 1958 was back in Prague, busily working on several psychiatric wards, often traveling from one hospital to another on the same day.</p><div><figure><a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262546935/expanding-mindscapes/" target="_blank"><img decoding="async" width="320" height="480" src="https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/expanding-mindscapes.jpg" alt=""></a><figcaption>This story is excerpted from the volume “<a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262546935/expanding-mindscapes/" target="_blank">Expanding Mindscapes</a>.” An open access edition of the book is freely available to download <a href="https://direct.mit.edu/books/oa-edited-volume/5697/Expanding-MindscapesA-Global-History-of" target="_blank">here</a>.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Hausner first experienced LSD in experiments conducted by Jiří Roubíček, likely in 1954. Roubíček, a neurologist, was interested in comparing the brain-wave patterns of schizophrenic patients with those of healthy subjects undergoing a “model psychosis” induced by LSD, which he obtained from Sandoz and started experimenting with in 1952. Since LSD produces mind-altering effects in tiny amounts without inflicting physical harm, Roubíček’s superiors considered it safe, and many young psychiatrists became his test subjects. (Czech doctors have a tradition of self-experimentation: The Czech medical society is named after Jan Evangelista Purkyně, a 19th-century physiologist who asserted that one learns best from direct experience and studied the effects that he underwent after ingesting such substances as digitalis and belladonna.) Unfortunately, it’s not known what Hausner thought of his own LSD experiences, as he did not describe them in his writings.</p><p>In the late 1950s, Hausner started conducting his own medical research, publishing a study of his application of the new antipsychotic drug chlorpromazine combined with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Increasingly, however, he was interested less in biological psychiatry and more in psychotherapy — a controversial discipline, as it was often associated with Freudian psychoanalysis, which communists considered unscientific, individualistic, and likely to bankrupt national health insurance programs. In 1959, Czech ideologues denounced Ferdinand Knobloch (1916–2018), the head of psychiatry at Charles University’s medical-faculty polyclinic, for advocating the use of psychotherapy to treat neuroses, and Hausner came to his defense. In the journal <em>Czechoslovak psychiatry</em>, Knobloch assured his readers that he was developing a “materialistic” psychotherapy, with measurable results, and Hausner provided a survey of recent Soviet medical literature showing that Russian doctors already were practicing psychotherapy in various forms, using suggestion (often with hypnosis) and persuasion, in an effort to fully understand “the personality of socialist man in unity with the socialist environment.” (Hausner read and spoke Russian, along with English and German.) Czechoslovakia held an international congress on treating neuroses later that year, so a wider acceptance of psychotherapy was already underway. But Knobloch likely appreciated Hausner’s support, because he soon hired Hausner to work at the university polyclinic.</p><p>Between seeing patients, Hausner wrote his first book, “The Mentally Ill Among Us” (1961), a guide to the mental-health system for patients and their families that told the story of a young man’s psychotic break, his treatment through medication and psychotherapy, and his return to work. In the preface, Hausner noted that Czechoslovakia’s third Five-Year Plan (1961–1965) called for wider treatment of “nervous diseases,” and he hoped that his readers would learn that “mental illness does not equal disgrace, but can be successfully treated like any other physical illness.” (Hausner’s compassionate book was so popular that it was republished in 1969, 1978, and 1981.) During this time, he also began paying privately to undergo psychoanalysis, perhaps with Knobloch, as part of his training to become a psychoanalyst himself. Most fatefully, though, he became interested in treating patients with LSD, newly available from Czechoslovakia’s government laboratories.</p><p>In 1956, chemists at the Research Institute for Pharmacy and Biochemistry in Prague filed a patent for a new process for making LSD, and in 1959, the ministry of health gave the institute permission to begin producing the drug, trademarked Lysergamid, “primarily for experimental purposes.” So Hausner devised an experiment. In 1954, R. A. Sandison and other British doctors had <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1955-02868-001" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">reported benefits</a> in neurotic patients who received small-to-substantial doses of LSD (25 to 400 <em>µ</em>g, or micrograms) in conjunction with individual psychotherapy, applied repeatedly over several months<sup> </sup>— a method that Sandison later called “psycholytic” therapy. Hausner wondered if this would work in groups. Through the university, he knew Vladimír Doležal, a medical doctor and chemist specializing in toxicology, and they proposed using LSD in a therapeutic community established by Hausner’s boss.</p><figure><blockquote><p>Even under communism, Czechs with “bad nerves” were typically treated with baths at the country’s opulent 19th-century spa resorts.</p></blockquote></figure><p>At the polyclinic, Knobloch had become intrigued by the self-defeating behavior of his neurotic patients, so he’d developed a retreat for them on a state farm in Lobeč (35 miles north of Prague), modeled on the therapeutic community for traumatized soldiers that Maxwell Jones <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0957154X221140734" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">had established</a> near London in 1947. Even under communism, Czechs with “bad nerves” were typically treated with baths at the country’s opulent 19th-century spa resorts, and Knobloch wanted to prove that he could help more people at less cost. At Lobeč, 15 men and 15 women spent several hours every day working on the farm, and several additional hours with a rehabilitation aide engaged in group discussions or various types of therapy, producing art or music or acting out events from their lives via psychodrama or “psychogymnastics,” a nonverbal exercise incorporating movement and mime. A psychiatrist from Prague visited to direct individual and group psychotherapy only once or twice a week, so the patients effectively became cotherapists, a design that Hausner tried to duplicate at Sadská.</p><p>In their experiment, Hausner and Doležal gave 11 neurotic patients 100 <em>µ</em>g of LSD in conjunction with six hours of individual psychotherapy; seven got 50 <em>µ</em>g and group therapy, and seven got saline as a control. After several weeks, the patients who’d received LSD and individual therapy showed the most improvement, displaying new insights and changed attitudes in their relationships with staff and other patients. Those who received LSD in the group had the worst results: “Patients were more concerned about their unusual experiences than to expose them to the therapeutic effect of the collective.” It was a modest study, but the first on LSD psychotherapy to appear in the Czech medical literature.</p><p>Other Czech doctors were starting to use the drug. Stanislav Grof began psycholytic therapy with neurotic patients at the Psychiatric Research Institute in 1961, and that year the authorities approved Lysergamid for outpatient psychiatry, encouraging other doctors around Czechoslovakia to test it in their own practices. Individual psychotherapy expanded, and soon it was possible to discuss concepts that were essentially Freudian: In 1963, Hausner and Doležal published a remarkable how-to guide for hallucinogens in the journal <em>Czechoslovak psychiatry</em>, citing the West German psychiatrist Hanscarl Leuner’s contention that such drugs “reawakened psychic dynamics” by evoking “age regression going to the first years of life,” “re-living of forgotten traumatic events,” and providing “abreactive emotional release with subsequent insight.” They outlined radical techniques, some borrowed from Leuner and other Western LSD doctors, that they used at Lobeč: getting patients to write out their autobiographies, using family photos to encourage associations, having the doctor play characters perceived in patients’ hallucinations, and even recruiting other patients to assist with the sessions. Hausner and Doležal quoted their patients endorsing LSD therapy, included samples of patients’ artwork, and claimed that after a year, 75 percent of their patients receiving LSD and individual therapy had improved, although the best results were in those who’d combined such therapy with a stay at Lobeč, where they could practice insights acquired from their LSD experience.</p><p>Through such research, Hausner established contact with Leuner, who became the principal advocate for psycholytic therapy after Sandison moved on from LSD in 1964. Hausner started getting published in international journals, Czechoslovakia began permitting academics to travel to capitalist countries, and in August 1964, Hausner summarized his Lobeč work at the Sixth International Congress of Psychotherapy in London. By 1965, Czechoslovakia’s authorities had approved commercial production of its LSD, and Hausner wrote a paper — published in English — for the state pharmaceutical export firm, noting that Lysergamid was indistinguishable from Sandoz’s product and describing its effectiveness in outpatient psychiatry. He would run 104 sessions with 65 patients, using doses of 50 to 300 <em>µ</em>g, and found LSD was “a valuable means for deepening and accelerating the psychotherapy.” (Perhaps reluctant to limit foreign interest in Lysergamid to therapeutic communities, Hausner downplayed his Lobeč research, writing that he’d seen “no impressive differences” in results with outpatients.)</p><p>Hausner had credentials, contacts, and a steady supply of LSD. He was ready to apply everything that he’d learned at a clinic of his own.</p><hr><p>The psychiatric clinic at Sadská, a town of 3,000 residents 40 miles east of Prague, consisted of a pair of two-floor pavilions originally constructed in the 1920s as a retreat for postal employees to enjoy a nearby lake and mineral spa, or walk along the Elbe River and through the Kersko forests. To meet the growing demand for psychiatric care, the ministry of health acquired the facility and began admitting patients in 1962. But by the autumn of 1965, Sadská’s chief physician was losing his eyesight. The clinic was affiliated with Charles University’s faculty of medicine, so Hausner, then 36, got the job, and he quickly made changes.</p><p>Pavilion A remained devoted to standard psychiatry for inpatients suffering issues from hysteria to psychosis. But Hausner had Pavilion B remodeled as an open ward to suit a therapeutic community. He selected some 50 inpatients for it, to stay six to eight weeks, and from them, he chose one or two groups of 12 to 14 patients who he thought were most likely to benefit from LSD, to stay six months. As at Lobeč, the patients spent mornings laboring in the forest or in the clinic’s garden and workshop, afternoons in group discussions, and evenings hearing lectures, creating dances or plays, or watching films. But with his own facility, Hausner could fully implement psycholytic therapy, and every day several patients underwent LSD.</p><p>The drug was usually delivered by injection to control the dosage, and before breakfast so the patients wouldn’t be hungry in the middle of their trip. Sessions were conducted in the patients’ rooms — LSD groups were on the ground floor — and the patients were accompanied by a sitter. Outpatients also came to Sadská for “weekend therapy,” undergoing LSD and individual or group analysis and returning to work on Monday. Like the inpatients, these visitors underwent dozens of treatments: one 42-year-old male received 300 <em>µ</em>g 37 times in 18 months.</p><figure><blockquote><p>“Talk openly about everything that comes to mind while using the substance,” Hausner advised. “The purpose of sitting is not to ‘extract’ experiences that you would not discuss in a completely awake state.”</p></blockquote></figure><p>Hausner wrote up a guide for patients, introducing them to psycholytic therapy. Many instructions were typical of clinics elsewhere — he advised patients to keep their eyes closed while on LSD and to accept unpleasant or frightening episodes, as they might reveal the sources of their psychological difficulties — but others seemed worded to reassure patients who had lived under totalitarianism. “Talk openly about everything that comes to mind while using the substance,” Hausner advised. “The purpose of sitting is not to ‘extract’ experiences that you would not discuss in a completely awake state.”</p><p>He also wrote detailed instructions for the staff. Nurses were to supervise patients filling out the numerous questionnaires, to conduct art and occupational therapy, and to sit with patients during LSD sessions. Some patients might undergo psychotic episodes, he warned: “Remember that kindness, an effort to understand seemingly bizarre behavior, and minimal restraints can usually eliminate even the most violent manifestations.” Any doctor or therapist working with LSD was required to have at least three experiences with the drug themselves so that they could better understand their patients, and nurses had the option to undergo LSD as well. “When work started at Sadská, the personnel took a very skeptical attitude to the whole undertaking,” Hausner told a reporter, but most employees came around. “Their first eye-opener is that as ‘normal’ people they are not so very different from the patients under LSD intoxication. This discovery breaks down the barrier of prejudice in them.”</p><p>The LSD therapy at Sadská was also greatly influenced by Zbyněk Havlíček (1922–1969), a psychologist and surrealist poet who had worked at the Dobřany mental hospital in the 1950s and was at Sadská when Hausner arrived. Fascinated by psychoanalysis, Havlíček considered LSD a “miracle” compared to the mind-numbing drugs issued by most psychiatrists, and he ran many of the early psycholytic groups at Sadská, interviewing patients while they were hallucinating.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1000" height="1040" src="https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/hausner-counsels-a-patient.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>Milan Hausner counsels a patient in his office at the Sadská clinic in 1974. A color photo of the same scene in a popular magazine contributed to the end of LSD psychotherapy in Czechoslovakia. Reproduced courtesy of Vladimír Lammer.</figcaption></figure><p>In letters to his girlfriend, Havlíček described his method in detail, playing with patients’ symptoms “like a bullfighter, waving a red cloth to their statements,” probing their visions and memories and finding connections in their biographies and patterns of behavior. This LSD analysis apparently worked: Hausner reported that 80 hospitalized patients underwent psycholytic therapy at Sadská in 1966, mainly suffering from neuroses, sexual disorders, and psychosomatic syndromes that hadn’t responded to other treatments for years, and 47 of them improved enough to be discharged. “The more sessions, the better the results,” Hausner said: patients who improved significantly had an average of 12 sessions (average dose 250 <em>µ</em>g), while those showing no improvement had an average of six.</p><p>This was good news at a time when moral panic about LSD was cresting elsewhere. In April 1966, a few days after the <em>New York Times</em> reported that a man claiming to be “flying” on LSD had stabbed his mother-in-law to death, Sandoz announced that it was stopping all distribution of its product, and therapists from the U.S., the UK, Italy, and other countries started visiting the Sadská clinic, hoping to buy Lysergamid. Stanislav Grof knew many prominent LSD doctors after presenting his own psycholytic research at a conference in New York, and he brought several of them to Sadská, including Harvard’s Walter Pahnke. But the panic elsewhere reached Czechoslovakia, too: The communist daily <em>Rudé Právo</em> ran an article denouncing LSD as a “new god” that had unleashed madness in the West, and Hausner had to respond. No misuse of Lysergamid had occurred in Czechoslovakia, he assured readers; only trained psychiatrists could request the drug after approval by a special committee of the ministry of health. (Hausner was the committee secretary, and he directed foreigners’ inquiries to the state export company.) Besides, LSD was too valuable a tool to be outlawed. The drug was a “probe into the subconscious,” Hausner wrote — and “the probe goes very deep, often into the first days of life, if not further.”</p><p>This was an extraordinary claim, especially for the pages of the official Communist Party newspaper, but it did reflect what the doctors were seeing. Hausner reported elsewhere that two-thirds of his LSD patients “relived phantasies concerning their birth, intrauterine life, ‘birth trauma,’ [or] first events of the sucking age.” At an October 1966 conference in Amsterdam, Grof theorized that LSD brought forth constellations of emotionally charged, condensed experiences (COEX), individual to each patient’s life, and these earliest memories or fantasies lay at the core of each COEX system, providing a key to understanding the patient’s problems. Havlíček, the Freudian, disagreed, arguing that such experiences were merely “a retroprojection of later conflicts” onto the richly symbolic moment of birth. To Hausner, these were theoretical differences; he was focused on managing his clinic, and he instructed Sadská’s nurses to comfort patients in a “pediatric regression” by “stroking, taking a hand, etc.” — which required “a certain skill” in distinguishing regression from “adult manifestation on an erotic level.”</p><figure><blockquote><p>Havlíček argued that the psychedelic experience was essentially narcissistic and typically American — a retreat into a “luxurious uterus.”</p></blockquote></figure><p>The most fundamental dispute between the doctors, however, occurred over how LSD therapy should be conducted. In 1967, Grof got a fellowship to work at Baltimore’s Spring Grove State Hospital, which used “psychedelic” therapy, giving alcoholics one huge dose of LSD (400 <em>µ</em>g or more) to induce a life-changing spiritual experience. Grof started thinking that Europe’s psycholytic advocates were on the wrong track: Repeated sessions of psychoanalysis were time-consuming and couldn’t grasp the profound sensations of ego death, rebirth, or cosmic unity that LSD patients often experienced at higher doses, which he saw could be beneficial. Havlíček had none of it: He argued that the psychedelic experience was essentially narcissistic and typically American — a retreat into a “luxurious uterus,” providing feelings of divine exaltation but socially worthless, separating the patient from the real world where their problems began, and where they had to learn to survive. Hausner, who’d been elected vice president of the European Association for Psycholytic Therapy, agreed: “In my experience,” he later wrote, “achieving true transcendental insight is rare unless the subject succeeds in discarding the negative aspects of his unconscious and erases the faulty programming that is causing the problem.” (To avoid confusion with psychedelic therapy, Hausner usually referred to the drugs as “psychodysleptics,” meaning that they induced a dreamlike state.)</p><figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="900" height="673" src="https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/hausner-at-sadska.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>Hausner and his colleagues at the Sadská clinic listen to news of the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in August 1968. In the years following, hardline Communist bureaucrats took an increasingly dim view of LSD psychotherapy.</figcaption></figure><p>Grof prepared a response, proposing a way to integrate psycholytic and psychedelic techniques at an international LSD congress to be held in Prague in September 1968, but the paper was never heard. On August 20, Soviet troops invaded Czechoslovakia to crush the democratic progress emerging during the Prague Spring. Then, on January 7, 1969, Havlíček died of leukemia. Sadská’s fortunes were destined to change after that.</p><hr><p>When Hana K. arrived at Sadská in 1970, she spent four months in group therapy while Hausner assessed her. She answered questionnaires and wrote her autobiography, read books by Freud and Erich Fromm, and sat in on discussions about relationships — many of the patients were young and had family conflicts because the state wouldn’t assign them apartments of their own unless they were married. Then Hana started the LSD treatments, and by sharing work and experiences with other patients, for the first time in her life she made some friends.</p><p>After 22 sessions, Hausner decided that Hana had improved enough to join a group psycholytic session. Although his early research suggested that group LSD sessions had little value, Hausner found that low doses of the drug helped some patients see their own “faulty, unbalanced behavior” when interacting with others. Hana received 100 <em>µ</em>g with half the patients in her group. At first, the experience was unpleasant, like she was being watched on a stage. But soon members of the community started violently arguing with each other — and Hana was flooded with empathy.</p><p>“I am actually beginning to understand and to relate to people,” Hana wrote in her diary. “I can see and understand the reason for the things they do, and I don’t hate them anymore! Poor doctor. He’s got so many children. How can he cope with it all?”</p><p>After the 1968 invasion, it took Czechoslovakia’s new Soviet-backed government several years to replace key officials with hardline communists, and during that time Hausner was able to continue LSD therapy. Newcomers joined Sadská, including a psychoanalyst from Poland and a group therapist from Barcelona, and foreigners continued to tour the clinic — R. A. Sandison visited in 1970 — but increasingly from the Soviet bloc, curious about methods unavailable in their own countries. “We have found your system of contacting LSD group’s therapy very fascinating,” two Polish psychologists wrote in Sadská’s guestbook after staying several weeks in the summer of 1969. “We have seen wonderful results. We have taken LSD ourselves and experienced that it helps very much in speeding up psychotherapy. We would like to arrange LSD group’s psychotherapy in Poland.”</p><p>To hear the people who worked there describe it, Sadská was more like an offbeat arts college than a Soviet medical facility. Hausner brought his three children to the clinic, and sculptors and dream interpreters came from Prague to give classes to the patients. Some evenings, they held masquerades or parties; the doctors and nurses and patients would dance together, and the next day, they would discuss in group how they had interacted. There were a few suicide attempts, but there were also romances: one older LSD patient, who had spent his youth in a Nazi concentration camp and suffered from depression, was so impressed by Sadská that after his discharge, he became a therapist at the clinic and married one of the psychiatrists. As one patient later wrote, “At Sadská, it was Freud and love.”</p><figure><blockquote><p>There were a few suicide attempts, but there were also romances.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Sadly, that love wasn’t felt in the Czech capital. Communists feared that the Western scourge of narcotics addiction was leaking into Czechoslovakia, and in December 1969, the popular magazine <em>Květy</em> ran an article about drug abuse by Prague youths, opening with a rumor that LSD could be bought in front of a downtown cinema from a car with Austrian license plates. Hausner increasingly had to defend the psychiatric use of LSD and the distribution scheme that he helped administer. At the prestigious Collegium Internationale Neuropsychopharmacologicum, held in Prague in 1970, he spoke on the “therapeutic and illegal use of Lysergamide”: After some 3,000 sessions with 300 patients at Sadská, he reported that general health improved for 60 percent of them, and life satisfaction increased for 70 percent. “Nobody of these 300 patients became habituated to LSD,” he asserted; distribution of the drug was under “rigorous governmental control,” and “no misuse has been observed.” But he was swimming against the tide. In February 1971, 34 countries adopted the UN Convention on Psychotropic Substances, classifying LSD as a drug of abuse with no therapeutic value. Czechoslovakia was only an observer of the proceedings, but the Soviet Union soon signed on, and Sadská came under scrutiny.</p><p>In May of that year, a panel of doctors conducted a comprehensive audit of the clinic “due to frequent negative comments” from the regional health authority. Hausner prepared a table showing that LSD patients were a small percentage of Sadská’s admissions, and the time they spent there was decreasing.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2082" height="1138" src="https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/saska.jpg" alt="Sadska admissions table"><figcaption>Sadská’s admissions and the time patients spent at the clinic.</figcaption></figure><p>The panel commended Hausner for fulfilling the planned number of treatments, his focus on “modern currents” in psychiatry, such as “group psychotherapy and active pursuit of cooperation of the patient,” and his “progressive efforts” to reduce hospitalization via his “weekend” LSD therapy. But, “[a]s far as LSD treatment is concerned, we reiterate the fact that this method is not generally accepted. The number of patients treated in this way needs to be limited as much as possible, or to stay with LSD for a few cases that would only go to outpatient treatment.”</p><figure><blockquote><p>Every third or fourth weekend, about 40 patients would endure a “psycholytic marathon,” taking turns sitting for each other and heading back to work on Monday.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Hausner complied, increasingly putting new LSD patients on weekend therapy. Every third or fourth weekend, about 40 patients would endure a “psycholytic marathon,” taking turns sitting for each other and heading back to work on Monday. Each of them would have been hospitalized an average of 64 days without the program, Hausner calculated, so it saved the state 1.34 million Crowns per year. (At the time, the average salary in Czechoslovakia was 26,844 Crowns per year.) To save more money, Hausner recruited psychology students to assist on weekends, and many underwent a “training intoxication” with LSD for university credit.</p><p>Hausner continued to publish articles internationally, including one comparing the symbology of dreams to LSD hallucinations that was subsequently reprinted in a Czech journal for general practitioners. In March 1973, he chaired a conference on psychotherapy in socialist countries that was attended by experts from across the Soviet bloc — although he was careful to mention psycholytic therapy only once in his own paper, surveying the range of techniques used in Czechoslovakia at the time. (For example, Hausner, then president of the psychotherapeutic section of Czech Psychiatric Society, noted that 250 of its 300 members used hypnosis.) In June, he traveled to Oslo for the 9th International Congress of Psychotherapy, where he identified his practice as “<a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1975-21534-001" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">dynamic confrontation therapy</a>,” in which a patient faces the problems of past, present, and future (!) in a controlled environment, with psychodysleptic drugs targeting the “neurochemical, intrapsychic, interpersonal, psychosomatic and the valuation system area[s],” and ultimately providing a corrective emotional experience.</p><p>But officials back in Prague were likely suspicious of the relative freedom that Hausner enjoyed without a Communist Party membership. Drug abuse was becoming a problem in Czechoslovakia, and though nearly all the cases involved prescription medicines, often containing ephedrine or codeine, the bureaucrats feared that LSD was next. In October 1973, they inspected the Sadská clinic, and in its safe, they found 619 ampoules of LSD that had expired in 1969. In January 1974, they consulted the pharmacy that distributed the drug and learned it had another 2,400 ampoules that Hausner had ordered in 1971 and were about to expire. In a series of letters, Hausner apologized. Supplies from the factory had been unpredictable, he said, and LSD remained stable in glass ampoules for many years. Besides, the drug hadn’t been stolen or turned up on the black market, so what was the harm?</p><p>Hausner needed some good press, so he invited journalists from <em>Květy</em> to visit Sadská. The resulting article described a traumatized 18-year-old girl arriving at the clinic, and Hausner’s plans to treat her with LSD, accompanied by a full-page color photo of Hausner ministering to a female patient lying on a wildly patterned couch in his office under a wall of primitive masks. The deputy director of the regional health authority demanded that LSD therapy be stopped. Hausner apologized again, admitting the photo was “too provocative,” and he got letters from other doctors supporting the continued use of LSD. But the health authority ordered Hausner to send reports on every patient receiving the drug, and it started conducting spot checks of the clinic’s supply.</p><p>In the late summer of 1974, Hausner’s father died, and Hausner had a nervous breakdown. “He had the worst fears for the future, he was anxious about his family, and concerned about material security,” one of his colleagues later said. Hausner admitted that he’d considered suicide and was hospitalized in Prague for several months. The regional pharmacist came to Sadská, collected all the ampoules of LSD, and stomped on them in Hausner’s office.</p><p>“They took away all his appetite for work,” a nurse said years after this incident. Hausner suffered another breakdown and received treatments from his Prague colleagues that he’d tried to avoid in his own practice, including ECT, antidepressants, and lithium. When he finally returned to Sadská in 1975, he was emotionally flattened, a changed man. A nearby hospital took over administration of the Sadská clinic and converted the psychotherapeutic pavilion into a ward for chronic psychiatric patients. LSD was still theoretically available with permission from the health ministry, but nobody risked ordering it.</p><p>Hausner left Sadská in 1981, after he and Zdena divorced. Czechoslovakia drifted into a stultifying political “normalization,” and Hausner ended up in the industrial north, providing psychiatry to the employees of a uranium mine. When he died in 2000, Czech medical journals did not mention his passing.</p><hr><p>For many decades, even after the communist regime fell in 1989, Czech medical authorities resisted any talk of reviving LSD therapy, and the few doctors interested in the drug were limited to conducting animal studies. But possibilities are beginning to reopen. Prague psychiatrists are studying the neurobiological effects of psilocybin — in a suite designed to resemble Hausner’s office as it appeared in <em>Květy </em>— and have established a private clinic offering ketamine-assisted psychotherapy, the first in central Europe, although such treatments are not yet covered by Czech medical insurance.</p><p>Hausner’s correspondence, patient files, and hundreds of pieces of artwork reside in the Czech Academy of Sciences archive, but they are currently inaccessible to the public. Thanks to the growing interest in psychedelics, a book that Hausner wrote in 1997 about psycholytic therapy at Sadská has finally been published, but to get a more complete picture of what happened at the clinic, I also sought out people who were there. Some 30 psychiatrists and psychologists worked or trained at the clinic; my colleagues and I interviewed nine of them, and while many said that Hausner was a superb administrator and psychiatrist, they also said that LSD didn’t “accelerate” psychotherapy because so much time was spent in sessions and analyzing the patients’ experiences. Several said that therapists were overwhelmed by the volume of material that LSD evoked and Hausner tried to do too much: Many of the LSD patients had neuroses or depression, but the conditions of others ranged from alcoholism to schizophrenia to psychopathy. I also interviewed five Sadská nurses, all of whom said that it was the most interesting period of their careers, and the clinic was “like a big family.” But did LSD therapy help the patients? “Well, they did not come back,” one nurse said. “They went back to life and everything was OK,” said another. “It is true that it was a half-year-long treatment. But it was successful, at least according to me.”</p><figure><blockquote><p>One woman said that she felt “broken” after every session and experienced unnerving flashbacks years later.</p></blockquote></figure><p>I also interviewed 15 former Sadská patients. Three said that psycholytic therapy hadn’t substantially changed their condition, and four said that it made their condition worse. One woman said that she felt “broken” after every session and experienced unnerving flashbacks years later. A man who suffered sexual neuroses said that he didn’t consider LSD useful because “it opened everything in allegorical terms” and confused the therapeutic relationship: In one session, he tried to rest his head in his doctor’s lap, and she rejected him, which took him a long time to overcome. But eight thought that Sadská’s therapy had helped. A woman who suffered from posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and sexual dysfunction said that she was “newly born” after her third session; she had been raised Catholic, and she said that LSD showed her “what belief really is.” A male alcoholic said that “LSD made the first step” to his sobriety and inspired him to become a therapist for other alcoholics.</p><p>Hana K. was discharged not long after her group LSD session. In 1972, she married a fellow Sadská patient, and eventually they had two sons. Today, she says that she’s become happier as she gets older, and the worst time of her life was just before she went to Sadská.</p><p>“A home, and kind people around me, that is something I never had before,” she said of the clinic nearly 50 years later. “And with LSD they taught me things I never came across anywhere else. But whether the treatment would be equally as successful without LSD I cannot say.”</p><hr><p><em><strong>Ross Crockford</strong> is an award-winning journalist based on Vancouver Island who has written about the medical use of psychedelic drugs for publications in Europe and North America.

</i></span><span></span></a><span>into the era of networking and graphics.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Pike">Rob Pike</a> has described Plan 9 as "an argument" for simplicity and clarity, while others have described it as "UNIX, only moreso."
</span></p>

<p>
<span>From
</span><span><i><a href="http://doc.cat-v.org/plan_9/4th_edition/papers/names">The Use of Name Spaces in Plan 9:</a> </i></span><span></span></p><ul>

<p>
<span>Plan 9 argues that given a few carefully implemented abstractions it
is possible to produce a small operating system that provides support
for the largest systems on a variety of architectures and networks.
</span></p>
</ul>


<p>
<span>From the
<a href="http://man.9front.org/1/intro"></a></span><a href="http://man.9front.org/1/intro"><span><tt>intro(1)
</tt></span><span></span></a><span>man page:
</span></p>

<ul>

<p>
<span>Plan 9 is a distributed computing environment assembled from
separate machines acting as terminals, CPU servers, and file
servers.  A user works at a terminal, running a window
system on a raster display.  Some windows are connected to
CPU servers; the intent is that heavy computing should be
done in those windows but it is also possible to compute on
the terminal.  A separate file server provides file storage
for terminals and CPU servers alike.
</span></p>
</ul>


<p>
<span>The two most important ideas in Plan 9 are:
</span></p>


<ul><span>•
<a href="http://doc.cat-v.org/plan_9/4th_edition/papers/names">private namespaces</a> (each process constructs a unique view of the hierarchical file system)
</span></ul>

<ul><span>•
<a href="http://man.9front.org/5/intro">file interfaces</a> (familiar from UNIX, but taken to the extreme: all resources in Plan 9 look like file systems)
</span></ul>


<p>
<span>Most everything else in the system falls out of these two basic ideas.
</span></p>


<ul><span><i>Plan 9 really pushes hard on some ideas that Unix has that haven’t
really been fully developed, in particular, the notion that just about
everything in the system is accessible through a file.  In other
words, things look like an ordinary disk file.  So all the devices are
controlled this way by means of ASCII strings, not complicated data
structures.  For example, you make network calls by writing an ASCII
string, not the files.  This notion is something that’s actually
leaking quite fast.
</i></span></ul>

<ul><span><i>The second thing is sort of more subtle and sort of hard to appreciate
until you’ve actually played with it.  That is that the set of files
an individual program can see depends on that program itself.  In a
standard kind of system, either with Unix remote file systems or
Windows attached file systems, all the programs running in the machine
see the same thing.  In Plan 9, that’s adjustable per program.  You
can set up specialized name stations that are unique to a particular
program.  I mean, it’s not associated with the program itself but with
the process, with the execution of the process.
</i></span><span></span></ul>

<span>In the words of the

<ul>

<p>
<span>Plan 9 is not Unix.  If you think of it as Unix, you may become
frustrated when something doesn’t exist or when it works differently
than you expected.  If you think of it as Plan 9, however, you’ll find
that most of it works very smoothly, and that there are some truly
neat ideas that make things much cleaner than you have seen before.
</span></p>
</ul>


<p>
<span>Confusion is compounded by the fact that many UNIX commands exist on Plan 9 and behave in similar ways. In fact, some of Plan 9’s userland (such as the
<a href="http://doc.cat-v.org/bell_labs/upas_mail_system"></a></span><a href="http://doc.cat-v.org/bell_labs/upas_mail_system"><span><tt>upas

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_Unix">Research UNIX.</a> </span></p>

<p>
<span>However, Plan 9 is a completely new operating system that makes no attempt to conform to past prejudices. The point of the exercise (circa the late 1980s) was to avoid past problems and explore new territory. Plan 9 is not UNIX
</span><span><i>for a reason.

<h4><span><b>0.1.1.1 - Plan 9 is not plan9port
</b></span><span></span></h4><span></span>

</a><p><a name="0.1.1.1">
<span></span></a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_9_from_user_space">Plan 9 from User Space</a> (also known as plan9port or p9p) is a port of many Plan 9 from Bell Labs libraries and applications to UNIX-like operating systems. Currently it has been tested on a variety of operating systems including: Linux, Mac OS X, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris and SunOS.
</p>

<p>
<span>Plan9port consists of a combination of mostly unaltered Plan 9 userland utilities packaged alongside various attempts to imitate Plan 9’s kernel intefaces using miscellaneous available UNIX programs and commands. Some of the imitations are more successful than others. In all, plan9port does not accurately represent the experience of using actual Plan 9, but does provide enough functionality to make some users content with running acme on their Macbooks.
</span></p>

<p>
<span>It is now being
<a href="https://9fans.topicbox.com/groups/9fans/T15127d7ddd5c7310/sam-and-samterm-in-go">slowly ported</a> to the Go programming language.

<span></span></a><a href="http://www.vitanuova.com/inferno/index.html">Inferno</a> is a distributed operating system also created at Bell Labs, but which is now developed and maintained by
<a href="http://www.vitanuova.com/">Vita Nuova Holdings</a> as free software. It employs many ideas from Plan 9 (Inferno does share some compatible interfaces with Plan 9, including the
<a href="http://9p.cat-v.org/">9P/Styx</a> protocol), but is a completely different OS. Many users new to Plan 9 find out about Inferno and immediately decide to abandon Plan 9 and its opaque user interface for this obviously "more advanced" sibling, but usually abandon that, too, upon first contact with Inferno’s Tk GUI. Notable exceptions duly noted.

<h3><span><b>0.1.3 - Plan 9 is not for you
</b></span><span></span></h3><span></span>

<p>
<span><b>Let’s be perfectly honest.
</b></span><span>Many features that today’s "computer experts" consider to be essential to computing (JavaScript, CSS, HTML5, etc.) either did not exist when Plan 9 was abandoned by its creators, or were purposely left out of the operating system. You might find this to be an unacceptable obstacle to adopting Plan 9 into your daily workflow. If you cannot imagine a use for a computer that does not involve a web browser, Plan 9 may not be for you.

<h2><span><b>0.2 - Why Plan 9?
</b></span><span></span></h2><span></span>

</a><p><a name="0.2">
<span>You may ask yourself, well, how did I get here? In the words of Plan 9 contributor
</span></a><a href="http://swtch.com/">Russ Cox:</a> </p>

<ul>

<p>
<span>Why Plan 9 indeed.  Isn’t Plan 9 just another Unix clone?  Who cares?
</span></p>

<p>
<span>Plan 9 presents a consistent and easy to use interface.  Once you’ve
settled in, there are very few surprises here.  After I switched to
Linux from Windows 3.1, I noticed all manner of inconsistent behavior
in Windows 3.1 that Linux did not have.  Switching to Plan 9 from
Linux highlighted just as much in Linux.
</span></p>

<p>
<span>One reason Plan 9 can do this is that the Plan 9 group has had the
luxury of having an entire system, so problems can be fixed and
features added where they belong, rather than where they can be.  For
example, there is no tty driver in the kernel.  The window system
handles the nuances of terminal input.
</span></p>

<p>
<span>If Plan 9 was just a really clean Unix clone, it might be worth using,
or it might not.  The neat things start happening with user-level file
servers and per-process namespace.  In Unix, /dev/tty refers to the
current window’s output device, and means different things to
different processes.  This is a special hack enabled by the kernel for
a single file.  Plan 9 provides full-blown per-process namespaces.  In
Plan 9 /dev/cons also refers to the current window’s output device,
and means different things to different processes, but the window
system (or telnet daemon, or ssh daemon, or whatever) arranges this,
and does the same for /dev/mouse, /dev/text (the contents of the
current window), etc.
</span></p>

<p>
<span>Since pieces of file tree can be provided by user-level servers, the
kernel need not know about things like DOS’s FAT file system or
GNU/Linux’s EXT2 file system or NFS, etc.  Instead, user-level servers
provide this functionality when desired.  In Plan 9, even FTP is
provided as a file server: you run ftpfs and the files on the server
appear in /n/ftp.
</span></p>

<p>
<span>We need not stop at physical file systems, though.  Other file servers
synthesize files that represent other resources.  For example, upas/fs
presents your mail box as a file tree at /mail/fs/mbox.  This models
the recursive structure of MIME messages especially well.
</span></p>

<p>
<span>As another example, cdfs presents an audio or data CD as a file
system, one file per track.  If it’s a writable CD, copying new files
into the /mnt/cd/wa or /mnt/cd/wd directories does create new audio or
data tracks.  Want to fixate the CD as audio or data?  Remove one of
the directories.
</span></p>

<p>
<span>Plan 9 fits well with a networked environment, files and directory
trees can be imported from other machines, and all resources are files
or directory trees, it’s easy to share resources.  Want to use a
different machine’s sound card?  Import its /dev/audio.  Want to debug
processes that run on another machine?  Import its /proc.  Want to use
a network interface on another machine?  Import its /net.  And so on.

<img src="http://fqa.9front.org/belllabs.jpg">


<p>
<span>All of the people who worked on Plan 9 have moved on from Bell Labs and/or
no longer work on Plan 9. Various reasons have been articulated by various people.

<ul>

<p>
<span>I ran Plan 9 from Bell Labs as my day to day work environment until
around 2002.  By then two facts were painfully clear.  First, the
Internet was here to stay; and second, Plan 9 had no hope of keeping
up with web browsers.  Porting Mozilla to Plan 9 was far too much
work, so instead I ported almost all the Plan 9 user level software to
FreeBSD, Linux, and OS X.
</span></p>
</ul>
<p>
<span>Russ Cox
<a href="http://marc.info/?l=9fans&amp;m=126697423223383">(again):</a> </span></p>

<ul>

<p>
<span>The standard set up for a Plan 9 aficionado here seems to
be a Mac or Linux machine running Plan 9 from User Space
to get at sam, acme, and the other tools.  Rob, Ken, Dave, and I
use Macs as our desktop machines, but we’re a bit of an exception.
Most Google engineers use Linux machines, and I know of
quite a few ex-Bell Labs people who are happy to be using
sam or acme on those machines.  My own setup is two
screens.  The first is a standard Mac desktop with non-Plan 9
apps and a handful of 9terms, and the second is a full-screen
acme for getting work done.  On Linux I do the same but the
first screen is a Linux desktop running rio (formerly dhog’s 8½).
</span></p>

<p>
<span>More broadly, every few months I tend to get an email from
someone who is happy to have just discovered that sam is still
maintained and available for modern systems.  A lot of the time
these are people who only used sam on Unix, never on Plan 9.
The plan9port.tgz file was downloaded from 2,522 unique
IP addresses in 2009, which I suspect is many more than
Plan 9 itself.  In that sense, it’s really nice to see the tools
getting a much wider exposure than they used to.
</span></p>

<p>
<span>I haven’t logged into a real Plan 9 system in many years,
but I use 9vx occasionally when I want to remind myself how
a real Plan 9 tool worked.  It’s always nice to be back,
however briefly.

<a href="http://marc.info/?l=9fans&amp;m=126700061820789">continues:</a> </span></p>

<ul>

<p>
<span>&gt; Can you briefly tell us why you (Russ, Rob, Ken and Dave)
</span></p><p>
<span>&gt; no longer use Plan9 ?
</span></p><p>
<span>&gt; Because of missing apps or because of missing driver for your hardware ?
</span></p><p>
<span>&gt; And do you still use venti ?
</span></p>

<p>
<span>Operating systems and programming languages have
strong network effects: it helps to use the same system
that everyone around you is using.  In my group at MIT,
that meant FreeBSD and C++.  I ran Plan 9 for the first
few years I was at MIT but gave up, because the lack of
a shared system made it too hard to collaborate.
When I switched to FreeBSD, I ported all the Plan 9 libraries
and tools so I could keep the rest of the user experience.
</span></p>

<p>
<span>I still use venti, in that I still maintain the venti server that
takes care of backups for my old group at MIT.  It uses
the plan9port venti, vbackup, and vnfs, all running on FreeBSD.
The venti server itself was my last real Plan 9 installation.
It’s Coraid hardware, but I stripped the software and had installed
my own Plan 9 kernel to run venti on it directly.  But before
I left MIT, the last thing I did was reinstall the machine using
FreeBSD so that others could help keep it up to date.
</span></p>

<p>
<span>If I wasn’t interacting with anyone else it’d be nice to keep
using Plan 9.  But it’s also nice to be able to use off the shelf
software instead of reinventing wheels (9fans runs on Linux)
and to have good hardware support done by other people
(I can shut my laptop and it goes to sleep, and even better,
when I open it again, it wakes up!).  Being able to get those
things and still keep most of the Plan 9 user experience by
running Plan 9 from User Space is a compromise, but one
that works well for me.

<ul>

<p>
<span>What Russ says is true but for me it was simpler. I used Plan 9 as my
local operating system for a year or so after joining Google, but it
was just too inconvenient to live on a machine without a C++ compiler,
without good NFS and SSH support, and especially without a web
browser.  I switched to Linux but found it very buggy (the main
problem was most likely a bad graphics board and/or driver, but still)
and my main collaborator (Robert Griesemer) had done the ground work
to get a Mac working as a primary machine inside Google, and Russ had
plan9port up, so I pushed plan9port onto the Mac and have been there
ever since, quite happily.  Nowadays Apples are officially supported
so it’s become easy, workwise.
</span></p>

<p>
<span>I miss a lot of what Plan 9 did for me, but the concerns at work override that.

<h3><span><b>0.2.4 - What is the deal with Plan 9’s weird license?
</b></span><span></span></h3><span></span><br>
<img src="http://fqa.9front.org/intellectualproperty.jpg">


<p>
<span>Over the years Plan 9 has been released under various licenses, to the consternation of many.
</span></p>

</a><p><a name="0.2.3.3">
<span>The first edition, released in 1992, was made available only to universities. The process for acquiring the software was convoluted and prone to clerical error. Many potential users had trouble obtaining it within a reasonable time frame and many complaints were voiced on the eventual
</span></a><a href="http://fqa.9front.org/fqa2.html#2.2.2">Plan 9 Internet mailing list.</a> </p>

<p>
<span>The second edition, released in 1995 in book-and-CD form under a relatively standard commercial license, was available via mailorder as well as through a special telephone number for a price of approximately $350 USD. It was certainly easier to acquire than the first edition, but many potential users still complained that the price was too high and that the license was too restrictive.

<h4><span><b>0.2.4.1 - Richard Stallman hates the Plan Nine license (circa 2000)
</b></span><span></span></h4><span></span>

</a><p><a name="0.2.4.1">
<span>In the year 2000, the third edition of Plan 9 was finally released under a custom "open source" license, the
</span></a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_9_from_Bell_Labs#History">Plan 9 License.</a> <a href="https://stallman.org/">Richard Stallman</a> was not impressed:
</p>

<ul>

<p>
<span>When I saw the announcement that the Plan Nine software had been released
as "open source", I wondered whether it might be free software as well.
After studying the license, my conclusion was that it is not free; the
license contains several restrictions that are totally unacceptable for
the Free Software Movement. (See

<p>
<span>The new license is utterly unacceptable for use in a BSD project.
</span></p>

<p>
<span>Actually, I am astounded that the OSI would declare such a license
acceptable.
</span></p>

<p>
<span>That is not a license which makes it free.  It is a *contract* with
consequences; let me be clear -- it is a contract with consequences
that I am unwilling to accept.

<h4><span><b>0.2.4.3 - Everyone hates the Plan 9 license (circa 2014)
</b></span><span></span></h4><span></span>

</a><p><a name="0.2.4.3">
<span>In 2014, portions of the Plan 9 source code were again re-licensed, this time under the
</span></a><a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html">GPLv2,</a> for distribution with the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Berkeley">University of California, Berkeley’s</a> <a href="http://akaros.cs.berkeley.edu/akaros-web/">Akaros</a> operating system. Predictably, various parties were not impressed.
</p>

<p>
<span>Russ Cox tried to make sense of the situation by commenting in a
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7232511">Hacker News thread:</a> </span></p>

<ul>

<p>
<span>When you ask "why did big company X make strange choice Y regarding
licensing or IP", 99 times out of 100 the answer is "lawyers". If the Plan
9 group had had its way, Plan 9 would have been released for free under a
trivial MIT-like license (the one used for other pieces of code, like the
one true awk) in 2003 instead of creating the Lucent Public License. Or in
2000 instead of creating the "Plan 9 License". Or in 1995 instead of as a
$350 book+CD that came with a license for use by an entire "organization".
Or in 1992 instead of being a limited academic release.
</span></p>

<p>
<span>Thankfully I am not at Lucent anymore and am not privy to the tortured
negotiations that ended up at the obviously inelegant compromise of "The
University of California, Berkeley, has been authorised by Alcatel-Lucent
to release all Plan 9 software previously governed by the Lucent Public
License, Version 1.02 under the GNU General Public License, Version 2." But
the odds are overwhelming that the one-word answer is "lawyers".
</span></p>
</ul>


<p>
<span>Some have suggested that confusion about licensing may have contributed to Plan 9’s failure to supplant UNIX in the wider computing world.

The A350 came to a stop off the right hand edge of the runway about 1680 meters/5510 feet down the runway and was evacuated. All occupants were able to evacuate. The other aircraft carrying 6 people also burst into flames, 5 of the six occupants are confirmed dead. Both aircraft burned down. 14 occupants of the A359 received injuries, the captain of the Dash 8 received serious injuries.<p>The airline reported their A350 was carrying 367 passengers (including 8 children) and 12 crew, all of them evacuated from the aircraft. In a second press release the airline reported there had been no anomaly with the aircraft prior to departure. The crew had received and read back landing clearance. After the collision and coming to a stand still three emergency slides were used to evacuate the occupants of the aircraft. The details of the accident are under investigation by the JTSB.</p><p>Japan's Coast Guard reported their Dash 8-300 registration JA722A (Code MA722) was carrying 6 people, the captain was able to evacuate, the other 5 are currently missing. The aircraft was carrying supplies to their Niigata based where the New Year's Earthquake struck.</p><p>Tokyo's Metropolitan Police reported 5 of the occupants of the Dash 8 are confirmed dead. </p><p>Tokyo's fire department reported, the captain of the DH8C received serious injuries, 17 occupants of the A359 received injuries. Later the Fire Department corrected the number to 14 injuries amongst the occupants of the A359.</p><p>Passengers of the A359 reported the landing appeared normal at first, after touchdown there was a thud and the outside lit up in orange. A first announcement was made "please calm down" followed by "do not take your luggage and do not stand up". There was no clear announcement to evacuate, however, when other passengers stood up they also stood up and thus escaped.</p><p>Japan's Ministry of Transport stated Haneda Airport was closed, the flights cancelled, there is no prediction when the airport will open again.</p><p>In a press conference the Ministry of Transport stated that it is under investigation whether JL-516 had been cleared to land. There was a Coast Guard aircraft on the runway causing a collision, the details of the collision are under investigation.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article data-comment-id="140-" id="140-"><span><span><a href="http://antirez.com/user/antirez">antirez</a></span> 3 hours ago. 20882 views.  </span><pre>I'll start by saying that this article is not meant to be a retrospective on LLMs. It's clear that 2023 was a special year for artificial intelligence: to reiterate that seems rather pointless. Instead, this post aims to be a testimony from an individual programmer. Since the advent of ChatGPT, and later by using LLMs that operate locally, I have made extensive use of this new technology. The goal is to accelerate my ability to write code, but that's not the only purpose. There's also the intent to not waste mental energy on aspects of programming that are not worth the effort. Countless hours spent searching for documentation on peculiar, intellectually uninteresting aspects; the efforts to learn an overly complicated API, often without good reason; writing immediately usable programs that I would discard after a few hours. These are all things I do not want to do, especially now, with Google having become a sea of spam in which to hunt for a few useful things.

Meanwhile, I am certainly not a novice in programming. I am capable of writing code without any aid, and indeed, I do so quite often. Over time, I have increasingly used LLMs to write high-level code, especially in Python, and much less so in C. What strikes me about my personal experience with LLMs is that I have learned precisely when to use them and when their use would only slow me down. I have also learned that LLMs are a bit like Wikipedia and all the video courses scattered on YouTube: they help those with the will, ability, and discipline, but they are of marginal benefit to those who have fallen behind. I fear that at least initially, they will only benefit those who already have an advantage.

But let's take it step by step.

# Omniscient or Parrots?

One of the most concerning phenomena of this new wave of novelty and progress in machine learning is the limited ability of AI experts to accept their limited knowledge. Homo sapiens invented neural networks, and then, even more crucially, an algorithm to automatically optimize the parameters of a neural network. Hardware has become capable of training increasingly larger models, and using statistical knowledge about the data to be processed (the priors) and through a lot of trial and error for successive approximations, architectures have been discovered that work better than others. But all in all, neural networks remain quite opaque.

In the face of this inability to explain certain emerging capabilities of LLMs, one would have expected more caution from scientists. Instead, many have deeply underestimated LLMs, saying that after all they were nothing more than somewhat advanced Markov chains, capable, at most, of regurgitating extremely limited variations of what they had seen in the training set. Then this notion of the parrot, in the face of evidence, was almost universally retracted.

At the same time, much of the enthusiastic masses attributed to LLMs supernatural powers that do not exist in reality. Unfortunately, LLMs can, at most, interpolate in the space represented by the data they have seen during training: and this would already be a lot. In reality, their ability to interpolate is limited (but still astonishing, and also unexpected). Oh, if only the largest LLMs of today could interpolate continuously in the space bounded by all the code they have seen! Even if they would not be able to produce true novelties, they would be able to replace 99% of programmers. The reality is more modest, as it almost always is. An LLM is certainly capable of writing programs that it has not seen in that exact form, showing a certain ability to blend different ideas that appeared in the training set with a certain frequency. It is also clear that this ability has, at the moment, deep limits, and whenever subtle reasoning is required, LLMs fail disastrously. Yet they represent the greatest achievement of AI, from its dawn to today. This seems undeniable.

# Stupid but All-Knowing

It's true: LLMs are capable, at most, of rudimentary reasoning, often inaccurate, many times peppered with hallucinations about non-existent facts. But they have a vast knowledge. In the field of programming, as well as in other fields for which quality data are available, LLMs are like stupid savants who know a lot of things. It would be terrible to do pair programming with such a partner (for me, pair programming is terrible even in the most general terms): they would have nonsensical ideas and we would have to continuously fight to impose our own. But if this erudite fool is at our disposal and answers all the questions asked of them, things change. Current LLMs will not take us beyond the paths of knowledge, but if we want to tackle a topic we do not know well, they can often lift us from our absolute ignorance to the point where we know enough to move forward on our own.

In the field of programming, perhaps their ability would have been of very little interest up to twenty or thirty years ago. Back then you had to know a couple of programming languages, the classic algorithms, and those ten fundamental libraries. The rest you had to add yourself, your own intelligence, expertise, design skills. If you had these ingredients you were an expert programmer, able to do more or less everything. Over time, we have witnessed an explosion of frameworks, programming languages, libraries of all kinds. An explosion of complexity often completely unnecessary and unjustified, but the truth is that things are what they are. And in such a context, an idiot who knows everything is a precious ally.

Let me give you an example: my experiments on machine learning were carried forward for at least a year using Keras. Then for various reasons, I switched to PyTorch. I already knew what an embedding or a residual network was, but I didn't feel like studying PyTorch's documentation step by step (as I had done with Keras, which I learned when ChatGPT did not yet exist). With LLMs, it was very easy to write Python code that used Torch. I just needed to have clear ideas about the model I wanted to put together and ask the right questions.

# Time for Examples

I'm not talking about easy things like: "Hey, what's the method of class X to do Y"? If it were just for that, one might be tempted to agree with those who are skeptical about LLMs. What the more complex models are capable of is much more elaborate. Until a few years ago, it would have been pure magic. I can tell GPT4: look, this is the neural network model I have implemented in PyTorch. These are my batches. I would like to resize the tensors so that the function that emits the batches is compatible with the input of the neural network, and I would like to represent things in this particular way. Can you show me the code needed to do the reshaping? GPT4 writes the code, and all I had to do was test in the Python CLI if the tensors really have the dimensions that are useful to me and if the data layout is correct.

Here's another example. Some time ago I had to implement a BLE client for certain ESP32-based devices. After some research, I realized that multi-platform Bluetooth programming bindings are more or less all unusable. The solution was simple, write the code in Objective C using macOS's native API. So, I found myself having to deal with two problems at the same time: learning the cumbersome BLE API of Objective C, full of patterns that I consider nonsensical (I'm a minimalist, that kind of API is at the opposite end of the spectrum of what I consider "good design") and at the same time remembering how to program in Objective C. The last time I had written a program in Objective C was ten years ago: I didn't remember the details of the event loop, memory management, and much more.

The final result is this code here, not exactly beautiful, but it does what it has to do. I wrote it in an extremely short time. It would have been impossible otherwise.

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/antirez/freakwan/blob/main/osx-bte-cli/SerialBTE.m">https://github.com/antirez/freakwan/blob/main/osx-bte-cli/SerialBTE.m</a>

The code was written mostly by doing cut &amp; paste on ChatGPT of the things I wanted to do and didn't quite know how to do, so they didn't work properly. Having the LLM explain to me what the problem was and how to solve it. It's true that the LLM didn't write much of that code, but it's also true that it significantly accelerated the writing. Would I have been able to do it without ChatGPT? Certainly yes, but the most interesting thing is not the fact that it would have taken me longer: the truth is that I wouldn't even have tried, because it wouldn't have been worth it. This fact is crucial. The ratio between the effort and the benefit of writing such a program, secondary to my project, would have been inconvenient. Moreover, this had a much more useful secondary collateral effect than the program itself: for that project I modified linenoise (one of my libraries for line editing) so that it works in multiplexing.

Another example, this time less about code writing and more about data interpretation. I wanted to set up a Python script using a convolutional neural network I found online, but it was quite lacking in documentation. The network had the advantage of being in ONNX format, so I could easily extract a list of inputs and outputs, and their assigned names. I only knew one thing about this convnet: it detected certain features within an image. I didn't know the input image format and size, and especially, the network's output was far more complicated than I imagined (I thought it was a binary classifier: is the observed image okay or does it have problems? Two outputs, but there were hundreds). I began by copy-pasting the ONNX network metadata output into ChatGPT. I explain to the assistant what little I know about the network. ChatGPT hypothesizes how the inputs are organized, and that the outputs are probably normalized boxes indicating parts of the images corresponding to potential defects, and other outputs indicating the likelihood of these defects. After a few minutes of back-and-forth, I had a Python script capable of network inference, plus the necessary code to transform the starting image into the tensor suitable for input, and so on. What struck me about that session was ChatGPT finally “understood” how the network functioned once it observed the raw output values (the logits, basically) on a test image: a series of floating-point numbers provided the context to identify the exact output details, the normalization, if the boxes where centred or if the left-top corner was specified, and so forth.

# Disposable Programs

I could document dozens of such cases I've narrated above. It would be pointless, as it's the same story repeating itself in more or less the same way. I have a problem, I need to quickly know something that *I can verify* if the LLM is feeding me nonsense. Well, in such cases, I use the LLM to speed up my need for knowledge.

However, there are different cases where I let the LLM write all the code. For example, whenever I need to write a more or less disposable program. Like this one:

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/antirez/simple-language-model/blob/main/plot.py">https://github.com/antirez/simple-language-model/blob/main/plot.py</a>

I needed to visualize the loss curve during the learning of a small neural network. I showed GPT4 the format of the CSV file produced by the PyTorch program during learning, and then I requested that if I specified multiple CSV files on the command line, I didn’t want the training and validation loss curves of the same experiment anymore, but a comparison of the validation loss curves of different experiments. The above is the result, as generated by GPT4. Thirty seconds in total.

Similarly, I needed a program that read the AirBnB CSV report and grouped my apartments by month and year. Then, considering the cleaning costs, and the number of nights per booking, it would do statistics on the average rental price for different months of the year. This program is extremely useful for me. At the same time, writing it is deadly boring: there's nothing interesting. So I took a nice piece of the CSV file and did copy-paste on GPT4. I wrote to the LLM what the problem was to be solved: the program worked on the first try. I show it to you in full below.

```python
import pandas as pd
pd.set_option('display.max_rows', None)
df = pd.read_csv('listings.csv')
reservations = df[df['Type'] == 'Reservation']
reservations['Start Date'] = pd.to_datetime(reservations['Start Date'])
reservations['Year'] = reservations['Start Date'].dt.year
reservations['Month'] = reservations['Start Date'].dt.month
reservations['Nightly Rate'] = (reservations['Amount'] - reservations['Cleaning Fee']) / reservations['Nights']
all_listings = reservations['Listing'].unique()
all_years = reservations['Year'].unique()
all_months = range(1, 13)
index = pd.MultiIndex.from_product([all_listings, all_years, all_months], names=['Listing', 'Year', 'Month'])
all_data = pd.DataFrame(index=index).reset_index()
merged_data = pd.merge(all_data, reservations, on=['Listing', 'Year', 'Month'], how='left')
average_nightly_rates = merged_data.groupby(['Listing', 'Year', 'Month'])['Nightly Rate'].mean().fillna(0)
print(average_nightly_rates)
```

To understand exactly how to group the data, which were otherwise quite scattered and disordered, requires some simple reasoning: it’s not a problem that an LLM could solve simply by regurgitating something that approximates the language it has seen. GPT4 has certainly observed similar programs during its training, but almost certainly has not seen a program that had to group things in the exact way I asked for and in a CSV file with that specific format. This shows (in my opinion) that LLMs can interpolate to some extent within the space outlined by the different programs in the training set.

Writing this type of program would be, in my opinion, an imprudent use of my time. The fact that an LLM can do it for me certainly speeds up my ability to produce code in a rather direct way: I can focus on the things that matter.

# When things don't go as they should: System Programming

Despite my success with LLMs and programming, when I write a program in C, I almost always end up using LLMs only as a more convenient form of documentation. I am an expert in system programming, and in that context, LLMs would be useful to me only if they were capable of complex reasoning: in this scenario, they almost always fail.

Let's start with the prompt of this experiment:

Outline the requirements of a nice, small but working C implementation of a bloom filter. Focus on the important aspects of the hashing function. Then write it, in good quality C.

Also consider that your example implementation should be sized to store 100,000 elements, with a false positive probability of at most 5%. The elements added are null-terminated strings.

Here’s the output:

```c
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;
#include &lt;math.h&gt;

#define N 100000  // Number of elements
#define P 0.05    // False positive probability
#define M (int)(-(N * log(P)) / (log(2) * log(2)))  // Size of bit array
#define K (int)(M / N * log(2))  // Number of hash functions

unsigned char bitArray[M / 8 + 1];

void setBit(int n) {
    bitArray[n / 8] |= 1 &lt;&lt; (n % 8);
}

int getBit(int n) {
    return bitArray[n / 8] &amp; (1 &lt;&lt; (n % 8));
}

// Basic hash functions (for demonstration purposes)
int hash1(char *str) {
    int hash = 5381;
    int c;
    while ((c = *str++))
        hash = ((hash &lt;&lt; 5) + hash) + c;
    return abs(hash % M);
}

int hash2(char *str) {
    unsigned long hash = 0;
    int c;
    while ((c = *str++))
        hash = c + (hash &lt;&lt; 6) + (hash &lt;&lt; 16) - hash;
    return abs(hash % M);
}

void add(char *str) {
    setBit(hash1(str));
    setBit(hash2(str));
    // Add more hash functions if needed
}

int is_in(char *str) {
    return getBit(hash1(str)) &amp;&amp; getBit(hash2(str));
    // Check more hash functions if used
}

int main() {
    char *testStr = "testString";
    add(testStr);

    if (is_in(testStr)) {
        printf("%s is probably in the set.\n", testStr);
    } else {
        printf("%s is definitely not in the set.\n", testStr);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

The implementation produced by GPT4 is not exactly brilliant. Bloom filters are quite widespread. It’s not such an exotic data structure. However, it’s clear that writing a decent bloom filter requires a greater capacity for abstraction: for example, there’s the problem of finding an effective way to hash the same string N times, and being certain that the hashes are sufficiently decorrelated.

Yet if you explicitly ask GPT4 to modify the hashing function so that it produces N decorrelated outputs, its proposed solution is significantly more acceptable:

```c
unsigned int hash(const char* str, unsigned int hash_id) {
    unsigned int hash = 5381;
    int c;
    while ((c = *str++)) {
        hash = ((hash &lt;&lt; 5) + hash) + c + hash_id;
    }
    return hash % BF_SIZE;
}
```

If it had come up with this idea on its own, it would have written the bloom filter differently, setting K bits at a time using a single hashing function.

GPT4 was able to perform, in isolation, the task of writing an appropriate and more generic hashing function. But in the larger project of writing a bloom filter, it failed to show sufficient reasoning ability, and instead spat out two different but similar hashing functions: this is what one would expect from a poorly written article example on bloom filters.

The current weak reasoning abilities of Large Language Models, combined with a possible scarcity of sources on the subject, and even worse, potentially many low-quality sources, collectively result in this meager outcome. Yet, this is not an isolated case. The few times I attempt to use LLMs in the realm of algorithmic or system programming, the results are extremely poor, even when the expected reasoning abilities are not greater than what LLMs seem to possess in contexts like Python programming.

At the same time, GPT-4 is capable of decompiling the function it produced (in a separate session), and also precisely understand its purpose:

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://chat.openai.com/share/f54b64d7-d19a-4be4-8f10-08553aa812f1">https://chat.openai.com/share/f54b64d7-d19a-4be4-8f10-08553aa812f1</a>

Therefore, stating that there are no uses in system programming contexts is certainly inaccurate.

One interesting and pretty much expected thing is that, in these cases, the difference between smaller and larger models is indeed significant. Let’s see how two local models fare.

For instance, Mixtral, the MoE of Mistral, responded to the same question as follows:

```c
unsigned int hash(const char* str, unsigned int hash_id) {
    unsigned int hash = 5381;
    int c;
    while ((c = *str++)) {
        hash = ((hash &lt;&lt; 5) + hash) + c;
    }
    return hash + hash_id;
}
```

Clearly, adding `hash_id` only at the end is an extremely poor solution. Mixtral is an excellent model for many uses, but as for the already weak reasoning capabilities of LLMs, the rule so far is certainly: larger is better.

This is a chat with the local LLM deepseek-coder, quantized to 4 bits as I don’t have enough RAM to use the model at higher precision. Yet, being 34 billion parameters large, its reasoning capabilities on this matter seem quite advanced. Here’s the log of the chat (conducted with llama.cpp):

&gt; I have a hash function that should output N distinct hashes for the same data. However, I'm seeing a very poor distribution of the produced hashes as I change the value of hash_id:

unsigned int hash(const char* str, unsigned int hash_id) {
    unsigned int hash = 5381;
    int c;
    while ((c = *str++)) {
        hash = ((hash &lt;&lt; 5) + hash) + c;
    }
    return hash + hash_id;
}

Maybe the salting strategy I'm using is poor? How could I change it?

[Deep-seek coder reply]

A possible issue with your implementation is that you're simply adding `hash_id` to the end of the hash. This can potentially lead to a poor distribution, especially if `hash_id` is too large or is not evenly distributed.

Consider using bitwise operations for mixing the `hash_id` in. Here is an example with XOR:

```c
unsigned int hash(const char* str, unsigned int hash_id) {
    unsigned int hash = 5381;
    int c;
    while ((c = *str++)) {
        hash = ((hash &lt;&lt; 5) + hash) ^ c + hash_id; // Using XOR to mix in the hash_id
     }
    return (hash ^ hash_id); // Mixing the hash_id one more time at the end
}
```

This will spread `hash_id` throughout your hashes better than simply adding it, which can lead to less uniform distribution. [Snipped… the actual reply contained more informative stuff]

Not bad for a model running on my MacBook M1 Max. It also mixed the sums with XORs. In this case, the model was certainly helped by the fact that I provided clues about the problem to solve, but it was the model that identified what the real source of the trouble was, and the proposed alternative is valid. Something like the above is not within the reach of any book, documentation, or Google search. And as primitive, a result of interpolation, or however you want to perceive it, the model has performed some form of reasoning, if by reasoning, in this specific case, we accept the identification of the origin of a problem and its potential solution. However one wants to think about LLMs, stating that they are not helpful for programmers is extremely rash.

At the same time, however, my experience over the past few months suggests that for system programming, LLMs almost never provide acceptable solutions if you are already an experienced programmer. Let me show you another real world example. My current project, ggufflib, involves writing a library that reads and writes GGUF format files, which is the format in which llama.cpp loads quantized models. Initially, to understand how the quantization encodings worked (for speed reasons the bits of each quant are stored in fancy ways), I tried using ChatGPT, but then I resolved to reverse engineer llama.cpp's code: it was much faster. An LLM that can decently assist a system programmer, if it sees the data encoding “struct” declaration and the decoding function, should be able to reconstruct the data format documentation. The functions of llama.cpp were small enough to fit entirely in the context of GPT4, yet the output was completely useless. In these cases, things are done as in the past: paper and pen, reading the code, and seeing where the bits that the decoder extracts are registered.

Let me explain better the above use case so that you can try it yourself, if you wish. We have this structure from llama.cpp implementation.

// 6-bit quantization
// weight is represented as x = a * q
// 16 blocks of 16 elements each
// Effectively 6.5625 bits per weight
typedef struct {
    uint8_t ql[QK_K/2];      // quants, lower 4 bits
    uint8_t qh[QK_K/4];      // quants, upper 2 bits
    int8_t  scales[QK_K/16]; // scales, quantized with 8 bits
    ggml_fp16_t d;           // super-block scale
} block_q6_K;

Then there is this function that is used to perform the dequantization:

void dequantize_row_q6_K(const block_q6_K * restrict x, float * restrict y, int k) {
    assert(k % QK_K == 0);
    const int nb = k / QK_K;

    for (int i = 0; i &lt; nb; i++) {

        const float d = GGML_FP16_TO_FP32(x[i].d);

        const uint8_t * restrict ql = x[i].ql;
        const uint8_t * restrict qh = x[i].qh;
        const int8_t  * restrict sc = x[i].scales;
        for (int n = 0; n &lt; QK_K; n += 128) {
            for (int l = 0; l &lt; 32; ++l) {
                int is = l/16;
                const int8_t q1 = (int8_t)((ql[l +  0] &amp; 0xF) | (((qh[l] &gt;&gt; 0) &amp; 3) &lt;&lt; 4)) - 32;
                const int8_t q2 = (int8_t)((ql[l + 32] &amp; 0xF) | (((qh[l] &gt;&gt; 2) &amp; 3) &lt;&lt; 4)) - 32;
                const int8_t q3 = (int8_t)((ql[l +  0]  &gt;&gt; 4) | (((qh[l] &gt;&gt; 4) &amp; 3) &lt;&lt; 4)) - 32;
                const int8_t q4 = (int8_t)((ql[l + 32]  &gt;&gt; 4) | (((qh[l] &gt;&gt; 6) &amp; 3) &lt;&lt; 4)) - 32;
                y[l +  0] = d * sc[is + 0] * q1;
                y[l + 32] = d * sc[is + 2] * q2;
                y[l + 64] = d * sc[is + 4] * q3;
                y[l + 96] = d * sc[is + 6] * q4;
            }
            y  += 128;
            ql += 64;
            qh += 32;
            sc += 8;
        }
    }
}

If I ask GPT4 to write an outline of the format used, it struggles to provide a clear explanation of how the blocks are stored on the lower / upper 4 bits of “ql” depending on the weight position. For this blog post, I also tried asking it to write a simpler function that shows how data is stored (maybe it can’t explain it with words, but can with code). The produced function is broken in many ways, the indexes are wrong, the 6-bit -&gt; 8-bit sign extension is wrong (it just casts to uint8_t), and so forth.

Btw, this is the code that I ended writing myself:

    } else if (tensor-&gt;type == GGUF_TYPE_Q6_K) {
        uint8_t *block = (uint8_t*)tensor-&gt;weights_data;
        uint64_t i = 0; // i-th weight to dequantize.
        while(i &lt; tensor-&gt;num_weights) {
            float super_scale = from_half(*((uint16_t*)(block+128+64+16)));
            uint8_t *L = block;
            uint8_t *H = block+128;
            int8_t *scales = (int8_t*)block+128+64;
            for (int cluster = 0; cluster &lt; 2; cluster++) {
                for (uint64_t j = 0; j &lt; 128; j++) {
                    f[i] = (super_scale * scales[j/16]) *
                           ((int8_t)
                            ((((L[j%64] &gt;&gt; (j/64*4)) &amp; 0xF) |
                             (((H[j%32] &gt;&gt; (j/32*2)) &amp; 3) &lt;&lt; 4)))-32);
                    i++;
                    if (i == tensor-&gt;num_weights) return f;
                }
                L += 64;
                H += 32;
                scales += 8;
            }
            block += 128+64+16+2; // Go to the next block.
        }
   }

From the function above, I removed what was the actual contribution of this code: the long comments documenting the exact format used by llama.cpp Q6_K encoding. Now, it would be immensely useful if GPT could do this for me, and I bet it’s just a matter of months, because these kind of tasks are within what can be reached without any breakthrough, just with a bit of scaling.

# Putting Things in Perspective

I regret to say it, but it's true: most of today's programming consists of regurgitating the same things in slightly different forms. High levels of reasoning are not required. LLMs are quite good at doing this, although they remain strongly limited by the maximum size of their context. This should really make programmers think. Is it worth writing programs of this kind? Sure, you get paid, and quite handsomely, but if an LLM can do part of it, maybe it's not the best place to be in five or ten years.

And then, do LLMs have some reasoning abilities, or is it all a bluff? Perhaps at times, they seem to reason only because, as semioticians would say, the "signifier" gives the impression of a meaning that actually does not exist. Those who have worked enough with LLMs, while accepting their limits, know for sure that it cannot be so: their ability to blend what they have seen before goes well beyond randomly regurgitating words. As much as their training was mostly carried out during pre-training, in predicting the next token, this goal forces the model to create some form of abstract model. This model is weak, patchy, and imperfect, but it must exist if we observe what we observe. If our mathematical certainties are doubtful and the greatest experts are often on opposing positions, believing what one sees with their own eyes seems a wise approach.

Finally, what sense does it make today not to use LLMs for programming? Asking LLMs the right questions is a fundamental skill. The less it is practiced, the less one will be able to improve their work thanks to AI. And then, developing a descriptive ability of problems is also useful when talking to other human beings. LLMs are not the only ones who sometimes don't understand what we want to say. Communicating poorly is a great limitation, and many programmers communicate very poorly despite being very capable in their specific field. And now Google is unusable: using LLMs even just as a compressed form of documentation is a good idea. For my part, I will continue to make extensive use of them. I have never loved learning the details of an obscure communication protocol or the convoluted methods of a library written by someone who wants to show how good they are. It seems like "junk knowledge" to me. LLMs save me from all this more and more every day.</pre></article></div></div>]]></description>

<p>The shadows are appearing behind the seats on the platforms where people are leaning up against the walls and thanks to their appearance, have been nicknamed by some as ghosts.</p>
<p>They are starting to look shabby though, so TfL is trying out an idea to see if it can help reduce the effect or even eradicate it entirely.</p>
<p>One would be to replace all the seats with new designs with backs to lean on, but that would be expensive, so an alternative is to put large decorative stickers on the walls to mask the shadows.</p>

<p>Several designs are being tested at <a href="https://www.ianvisits.co.uk/articles/tag/liverpool-street-station/">Liverpool Street station</a>, ranging from large sheets to “pawns” that sit behind each seat.</p>
<p>The plain pawns are primarily black, but a blue pawn highlights the accessible seats on the ends of the rows. The other pawns and the solid blocks of sheeting are coloured to match the design of the Elizabeth line seating moquette.</p>

<p>A TfL spokesperson said: “The Elizabeth line has had a transformational effect, providing new journey options for customers, including at new central London stations. At some of our underground Elizabeth line stations we have been exploring new ways to clean the walls behind seating to remove any marks and better protect the walls in future to improve the customer experience.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
<p>I'm going to limit my answer to the question, "Why does the
integer representation of a floating point number offer a
piecewise linear approximation to the logarithm?".
The fast inverse square root is a fascinating topic, but I don't
know enough about it to talk about it.</p>
<p>But it's actually pretty easy to answer the question in the title.  First I'll start with the "TL;DR" summary:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This approximation works because when a number is an exact power of the base, its logarithm is (trivially) exactly its exponent when expressed in exponential notation.  Floating-point notations like IEEE-754 <em>are</em> base-2 exponential notations, and the exponent occupies almost the highest-precision bits of the format, excepting only the sign bit, which is 0 for positive numbers and so can be ignored.  And all of lower-precision bits (that is, beneath the exponent) form a perfectly linear progression, notionally from 000 to 999, due in part to the fact that IEEE-754 formats use normalized significands with a "hidden" leading 1 bit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The longer explanation starts with a review: What do we mean by a <em>logarithm</em>?
Well, it's the inverse of the exponential or power function.
Exponentials say things like, ten to the second power
(10<sup>2</sup>) is 100.  So the (base 10) logarithm function
asks things like, What power do we have to raise 10 to to get the
number 100?  The answer, of course, is 2.</p>
<p>You can also ask things like, "What power do we have to raise 10 to to get the
number 50?"  That's obviously harder, because 50 isn't an even
power of 10.  There's some very cool math behind this which I am
not going to try to explain, but raising things to fractional
powers is defined in such a way that 10<sup>1.69897</sup> is 50.
So the log (base 10) of 50 is 1.69897.</p>
<p>And then you don't have to limit yourself to powers of 10, either.
Mathematicians like to use powers of the special number <em>e</em>
(2.71828), and of course computer programmers love (just love) to
use powers of 2.  What power do we have to raise 2 to in order to
get the number 32?  Every computer geek knows it's 5.  So the log
(base 2) of 32 is 5.</p>
<p>And then there's scientific notation.  Let's take the number 12345.
One way of representing that in scientific notation is 1.2345
× 10<sup>4</sup>.  And it turns out that gives us a hint as
to what the base-10 logarithm of 12345 is.  It's going to be
greater than or equal to 4, and less than 5.  (In fact it's about 4.09149.)
This works as long as we pick scientific representations that are
<em>normalized</em> in a certain way, with the <em>significand</em> part
(popularly called the "mantissa") chosen to be
between 1 and 10.  (That is, we wouldn't get a good estimate of
the logarithm in this way if we'd looked at the otherwise-equivalent
notations 0.12345 × 10<sup>5</sup> or 12.345 × 10<sup>3</sup>.)</p>
<p>So now let's turn to computer floating-point representations.
These typically use — and IEEE-754 definitely uses — base-2
(binary) exponential representations, that is, with normalized
significand values multiplied by some power of 2.  For example,
the number 1.125 is represented as 1.125 × 2<sup>0</sup>,
the number 25.25 is represented as 1.578125 × 2<sup>4</sup>,
and the number 0.1875 is represented as 1.5 × 2<sup>-3</sup>.</p>
<p>And, just as for base 10, those exponents give us a rough,
integer-only approximation of the base-2 logarithm — again,
as long as we use normalized significands, in this case between 1 and 2.
So log<sub>2</sub>(25.25) is going to be somewhere between 4 and 5.</p>
<p>It's also time for me to foreshadow
a super-special secret fact implied by the fact that
we're restricting ourselves to normalized significand values.
I said they were going to be "between 1 and 2", but more
precisely, they're going to range from 1.00000 to 1.99999.
But notice that no matter what the significand value is,
for base 2 <em>the first digit is always going to be 1</em>.
In a minute we'll see what we can do with that.</p>
<p>The IEEE-754 binary floating-point representations all consist of
a sign bit, followed by some number of exponent bits, followed
by some number of significand bits.  For example, for our number
25.25, we're going to have a 0 bit representing a positive sign,
followed by some representation of the exponent 4, followed by
some representation of the significand 1.578125.</p>
<p>But now we're getting a glimmer of how the raw-bits
interpretation of a floating-point number might have something to
do with a logarithm.  For positive numbers we don't have to worry
about the sign bit (since it's 0), and the next thing we see is
going to be the exponent, and we've already seen that the
exponent is a rough (integer-only) approximation of the
logarithm.  So all that's left to ask is, how are we going to
interpolate between the power-of-two values that have exact
base-2 logarithms
(log<sub>2</sub>(8) = 3, log<sub>2</sub>(16) = 4,
log<sub>2</sub>(32) = 5, etc.)
and the fractional ones in between?</p>
<p>If I gave you evenly-spaced numbers like 100, 200, 300 and asked
you to fill in the numbers in between, you'd have little trouble:
you'd replace the 00 part by 01, 02, 03, ..., up to 99.
And if you knew anything about binary numbers,
and I asked you do do the same for evenly-spaced binary numbers like</p>
<pre><code>00100000
01000000
01100000
10000000
</code></pre>
<p>you could do more or less the same thing, replacing the <code>00000</code>
part by consecutive binary numbers <code>00001</code>, <code>00010</code>, <code>00011</code>, etc.</p>
<p>Remarkably enough, we're about to see that something <em>exactly
like this</em> goes on when we encode significand values in IEEE-754
floating-point numbers.</p>
<p>Let's start looking at an actual IEEE-754
floating-point format.  We'll use single-precision float32, to
keep the numbers halfway reasonable.  This format uses 1 bit for
the sign (S), 8 bits for the exponent (e), and 23 bits for the
significand (s):</p>
<pre><code>S e e e e e e e e s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s
</code></pre>
<p>Let's start figuring out what the representations of the numbers
16.000 = 2<sup>4</sup> and 32.000 = 2<sup>5</sup> would look like.</p>
<p>16 is 1.0 × 2<sup>4</sup>.  So the significand is 1.0, and the
exponent is 4.  How will these be stored?  I'm going to
concentrate on the significand first.  Remember the observation
that the first digit (the one to the left of the decimal point)
is always 1?  IEEE-754 takes the position that this always-1 leading bit <em>does not need to be stored at all</em>.  The
actual bits stored for a significand of 1.0 will be 00000.
The exponent will be some representation of 4.  So I'm going to
represent the number 16.000 like this:</p>
<pre><code>0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
</code></pre>
<p>Those "4"s are approximate; I still haven't gotten around to
explaining how the exponent is encoded.</p>
<p>The number 32.000 is similar — actually, it's identical, except
for the exponent:</p>
<pre><code>0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
</code></pre>
<p>But the key point I'm building up to is that the numbers in
between — those greater than 16.0, but less than 32.0, will all
be variations on</p>
<pre><code>0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
</code></pre>
<p>except with the 0's replaced by all the consecutive 23-bit binary
numbers — all 2^23 or 8388608 of them — from 000…001 up to 111…111.</p>
<p>So now we've got just about all the pieces in place to see how
"the
integer representation of a floating point number offers a
piecewise linear approximation to the logarithm".  We've shown
that the binary representations of the numbers between 16 and 32
form a nice, linear ramp from a number that starts with something
like 4, to a number that starts with something like 5.</p>
<p>I've been ducking the question of how the exponents are encoded.
That's done using a <em>bias</em> scheme.  For binary32, the bit pattern
stored is the actual exponent value, plus 127.  So our exponent
value of 4 will be stored as a bit pattern of 4+127=131, and 5
will be stored as 132.  So the <em>actual</em> encodings of 16.0 and
32.0 will be</p>
<pre><code>0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
</code></pre>
<p>where I have filled in the binary values of the encoded exponents 131 and 132, namely
<code>10000011</code> and <code>10000100</code>.  And now we can see the actual, raw values</p>
<p><code>01000001100000000000000000000000</code> and
<code>01000010000000000000000000000000</code>, or <code>0x41800000</code> and
<code>0x42000000</code>, or 1098907648 and 1107296256.</p>
<p>Those numbers don't have anything obvious to do with the base-2
logarithms of 16 and 32 (namely, 4 and 5), but they're actually
very close.  They're offset by the effect of the bias, and
they're completely wrong in magnitude.  But that's not surprising:
by taking 32-bit quantities and treating them as integers, we're
getting big numbers (which are indeed integers), but the actual
values for these logarithms should be 4.0 and 5.0, and we'd like
the possibility of a fractional part.  So if we're going to treat
these big integers as some rendition of the logarithms of some
other, smaller numbers, it's going to involve something very much
like a <em>fixed-point</em> representation.</p>
<p>Deriving the details of that fixed-point representation is
straightforward: the scaling factor is clearly 2<sup>23</sup> =
8388608, and there's also an offset, corresponding to the bias
built in to the binary32 format.  That offset will be 1065353216
(127 × 2<sup>23</sup>)
if applied before scaling, or 127 afterwards.</p>
<p>Let's see if this works.  We have come up with integer values of
1098907648 and 1107296256 corresponding to 16.0 and 32.0.  So:</p>
<pre><code>(1098907648 - 1065353216) / 8388608 = 4
(1107296256 - 1065353216) / 8388608 = 5
</code></pre>
<p>or the other way:</p>
<pre><code>1098907648 / 8388608 - 127 = 4
1107296256 / 8388608 - 127 = 5
</code></pre>
<p>So it's working!</p>
<p>It's said that a picture is worth 1,000 words, and it's long past time to do some of this explaining that way.  Here's a graph which — not coincidentally — looks an awful lot like the one you posted from Mitchell 1961:</p>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xyiit.gif" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xyiit.gif" alt="graph of log2(x), and piecewise linear approximation"></a></p>
<p>The red curve is the actual base-2 log function.  The black dots are the places where log<sub>2</sub>(X) is an integer.  Those are the points where the raw bits of a binary32 float value, interpreted as an integer and suitably scaled, are exactly equal to log<sub>2</sub>.  And then in blue we have straight line segments directly connecting those points.</p>
<p>To recap: If we take the raw bits of binary32 float values corresponding to exact powers of 2, we get:</p>

<p>An exact power of two has a significand of 1.0 (that is, these numbers are all 1.0 × 2<sup>N</sup>), meaning that they are encoded in IEEE-754 as all 0's (due to the "hidden 1 bit" property).
And since they're positive, their sign bit is 0 also, and the only part that isn't 0 is the exponent.  And since for exact powers the exponent <em>is</em> the logarithm, for these numbers, the integer interpretation of the raw bit pattern is always exactly the logarithm, after shifting and scaling.  (I presume that some aspect of that "shifting and scaling" is where the magic number 0x5f37642f comes in.)</p>
<p>And then, for all the numbers that aren't exact powers of 2, and for which the logarithm isn't an integer, the way the significand values are laid out means that the raw values (as shown by the blue lines in the plot above) form a perfect linear interpolation between the exact powers.  Therefore, in (almost) all cases, the raw bit patterns do indeed end up being a "piecewise linear approximation to the logarithm".  (I said "almost" because this result does <em>not</em> hold for the subnormals, and for the special values Inf and NaN.)</p>
<p>The other interpretation of the question "Why" is, "Why did the designers of IEEE-754 set things up this way?"  I don't believe it was deliberate, that is, I don't believe that it was a requirement that the raw bit pattern, interpreted as an integer, corresponded to a piecewise linear approximation of the base-2 logarithm.  However, given these three related facts:</p>
<ul>
<li>the definition of an exponential notation basically <em>is</em> a piecewise approximation of a logarithm</li>
<li>IEEE-754 did have a goal of keeping positive floating-point values monotonically increasing per their raw bit values</li>
<li>IEEE-754 hides the high-order "1" bit of the significand; all significands are of the form 1.xxx but only the xxx part is stored as such</li>
</ul>
<p>the "piecewise liner approximation" result falls out rather neatly.</p>

    <h2>
      <a href="https://updown.io/blog">Blog</a> <em>&nbsp;〉</em>The funny rules of SpamAssassin in 2023 (deep dive)
    </h2><p>This investigation was surprising to me so I thought it would be interesting to share my findings and I hope you'll like it.</p>

<p>Some of my clients occasionally reported that the updown confirmation email (used to confirm a new email address, provided by <a href="https://github.com/heartcombo/devise/blob/main/app/views/devise/mailer/confirmation_instructions.html.erb">Devise</a>) had been classified as spam, we're talking about this one:</p>

<p><img src="https://updown.io/files/655b30f9893e4ad2c794f3c4.png" alt="confirmation email screenshot"></p>

<p>Doesn't look too spammy so far but sometimes mails servers running <a href="https://spamassassin.apache.org/">SpamAssassin</a> were indeed reporting a rating above 5 on its "Spam-Score". 5 being the default threshold from SpamAssassin to consider an email as spam. If we have access to the raw email with headers, this is something we can often see easily (real example provided by one client):</p>
<div><pre><code><span>X-Spam-Report</span><span>:</span><span> 
    *  0.0 HTML_MESSAGE BODY: Nachricht =?UTF-8?Q?enth=E4lt?= HTML
    *  2.8 HTML_IMAGE_ONLY_28 BODY: HTML: images with 2400-2800 bytes of words
    * -0.0 T_SCC_BODY_TEXT_LINE No description available.
    *  4.0 URI_PHISH Phishing using web form</span>
<span>X-Spam-Score</span><span>:</span><span> 6.8</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>So I started investigating why SpamAssassin was applying these rules to this email and oh boy I wasn't ready for what I found 😅</p>

<p>I first tried reproducing the problem locally by installing SpamAssassin and running some checks on the exact same email from that client (example instructions used on Ubuntu 22.04):</p>
<div><pre><code><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>sudo </span>apt <span>install </span>spamassassin
<span>
</span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span>spamassassin <span>-V</span>
<span>SpamAssassin version 3.4.6
  running on Perl version 5.34.0

 1.0 URI_PHISH              Phishing using web form
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Dissapointingly the result was very different and the score very low. We could still see the same impacting rules though (<code>HTML_IMAGE_ONLY_28</code> and <code>URI_PHISH</code>) but with lower scores.</p>

<p>I also tried with the <code>-Lt</code> options which means "local-only test" (no calls to remote servers, online blacklists, etc.) and in that case there's fewer tests as expected but it <strong>increases</strong> the score of others:</p>

</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This is likely to make up for the fact that there's less signal to be used so they need to amplify the only available signals in order to reach the spam score threshold of 5 earlier, I guess.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you do/can have a local DNS resolver, I would recommend making sure you enable <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/spamassassin/UsingNetworkTests">network rules</a> for more reliable results. If using <code>spampd</code>, this is configured with <code>LOCALONLY=0</code>  in <code>/etc/default/spampd</code> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So even though the scores were lower, I knew they could be multiplied for some reasons and also by configuration so better see if I can avoid the email being flagged as <code>HTML_IMAGE_ONLY_28</code> and <code>URI_PHISH</code> entirely to eliminate the problem.</p>

<p>I first wrote a quick way to test these emails spam scores in my specs (using <code>spamd</code> the daemon version of SpamAssassin, and <code>spamc</code> the command-line client). In order to be able to iterate and test changes quickly, but also to <strong>avoid regressions in the future</strong>. Future changes of my emails or future versions of SpamAssassin:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>spam_check</span> <span>email</span>

  <span># Using spamassassin (standalone cmd), slower but supports local-only option</span>

<p>Now let's have a look at these two rules. It's hard to find clear definitions sometimes but fortunately SpamAssassin is <a href="https://github.com/apache/spamassassin">open source</a> so where there is a will there's a way.</p>

<h3>HTML_IMAGE_ONLY_24</h3>

<p>This  one is the easiest and the most self-explanatory, it simply checks if the email contains an image (it does, the updown.io logo) and if the content is between 2000 and 2400 bytes. So basically if the email is short and has an image, it's more likely to be spam (this is because of spam email which hide text as images to avoid filters). Only two options here:<br>
1. Remove the image<br>
2. Increase the content length</p>

<p>I choose the later to keep a consistent look and also because of the second rule. In the end I only increased it a bit and now it matches the <code>HTML_IMAGE_ONLY_32</code> rule, this rule scores <strong>2.2</strong> in local-only testing but <strong>0</strong> (surprisingly) when network test are enabled. (If we follow the same logic as <code>HTML_IMAGE_ONLY_24</code>, it should have been 2.2/4 ≃ 0.55)</p>

<p>Getting rid of this rule would require much more text bloat or cheating (invisible text, etc..) and it matches more of my emails, so for the moment I decided to leave it like that and wait for the next problem. 2.2 is not enough on it's own to trip the spam threshold (5) and hopefully spamassassin will improve this part before I need to hack around it.  </p>

<h3>URI_PHISH</h3>

<p>Now for the most interesting part, after some online search I first <a href="https://spamassassin.apache.org/full/3.4.x/doc/Mail_SpamAssassin_Plugin_Phishing.txt">found this</a> which seems to be a plugin checking for URL against a blacklist, but it gives the <code>URI_PHISHING</code>  rule (not exactly the same) and I didn't install any plugin, so this is not the one.</p>

<p>I then found this <a href="https://bz.apache.org/SpamAssassin/show_bug.cgi?id=7940">very interesting report</a> in 2021 about a similar confirmation email receiving a "false positive" classification as <code>URI_PHISH</code>, and the official answer was:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>It's not based on "phishing URLs" or the specific link, it's based on having body text that looks like account phishing and having a URL.  The body text that looks suspiciously like phishing is, unsurprisingly, "confirm your account".</em></p>

<p><em>As Loren said, this is not a FP, as the total score for the message did not exceed the spam threshold. This is a single-rule hit on spammy-looking content without other signs to support it. That happens.</em></p>

<p><em>It is not a bug that a given rule will hit some ham. The only suggestion I can offer is that you reword your message to make it look less like phishing.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So let's skip over the fact that it is now very sad that anti-spam filters have to block any simple confirmation email just because scamers are successfully abusing people with them...</p>

<p>That piqued my curiousity: what are they looking for in the email exactly? how can I make sure that the change I make won't be matched by another rule or in the future? (yes we unfortunately have to think like scammers now in order to get our regular email accepted...)</p>

<p>So by searching for <code>URI_PHISH</code> into the code I ended up in this <a href="https://github.com/apache/spamassassin/blob/773338709e3a4e53380ec9b7ef530af5f115d5ed/rulesrc/sandbox/jhardin/20_misc_testing.cf#L1340">big rules file</a> which does contain this (extract slightly simplified):</p>

</code></pre></div>
<p>Ok so we now have an entry point which contains <strong>MANY</strong> other rules of course (some of which also contains other rules). I checked <strong>ALL</strong> of them for you ^^ and here are my most interesting findings:</p>

<h4>First in the positive rules, which needs to be true:</h4>

<ul>
<li><code>__HAS_ANY_URI</code> → simple regexp on <code>/^\w+:\/\//</code></li>
<li><code>__EMAIL_PHISH || __ACCT_PHISH</code> → these the sub rules where the main "phishing" heuristics happens<br>

<ul>
<li><code>__WEBMAIL_ACCT</code>, <code>__MAILBOX_FULL</code>, <code>__MAILBOX_FULL_SE</code>, <code>__CLEAN_MAILBOX</code>, <code>__VALIDATE_MAILBOX</code>, <code>__VALIDATE_MBOX_SE</code>, <code>__UPGR_MAILBOX</code>, <code>__LOCK_MAILBOX</code>, <code>__SYSADMIN</code>, <code>__ATTN_MAIL_USER</code>, <code>__MAIL_ACCT_ACCESS1</code>, <code>__MAIL_ACCT_ACCESS2</code>, <code>__ACCESS_REVOKE</code>, <code>__PASSWORD_UPGRADE</code>, <code>__PENDING_MESSAGES</code>, <code>__RELEASE_MESSAGES</code>, <code>__PASSWORD_EXP_CLUMSY</code> → these are all regexps for typical email scams (mailbox full, click here to regain access to your account, etc...), nothing matching in my email.</li>
<li><code>__PDS_FROM_NAME_TO_DOMAIN</code> ⚠️ this one is interesting, it triggers if the <strong>From name</strong>  is equal to the <strong>To domain</strong> (for example if the emails is From “example.com” To "<a href="mailto:adrien@example.com">adrien@example.com</a>"). → this is because many scam use that to make it look like the email comes from your "domain administrator". It wasn't the case for me here, but make sure you don't do that.</li>
<li><code>__VERIFY_ACCOUNT</code> → ✅ this is the one matching our email so I had to change the wording to avoid it. The regexp is: <code>/(?:confirm|updated?|verif(?:y|ied)) (?:your|the) (?:(?:account|current|billing|personal|online)? ?(?:records?|information|account|identity|access|data|login)|"?[^\@\s]+\@\S+"? (?:account|mail ?box)|confirm verification|verify k?now|Ihre Angaben .berpr.ft und best.tigt)/i</code></li>
<li><code>__FAILED_LOGINS</code>, <code>__ACCOUNT_REACTIV</code>, <code>__SECURITY_DEPT</code>, <code>__ACCOUNT_ERROR</code>, <code>__ACCOUNT_DISRUPT</code>, <code>__ACCOUNT_UPGRADE</code>, <code>__ACCOUNT_SECURE</code>, <code>__SUSPICION_LOGIN</code>, <code>__ACCESS_SUSPENDED</code>, <code>__ACCESS_RESTORE</code>, <code>__ACCESS_REVOKE</code> → another set of regexp for classic account scams based on fear, I made sure my "account locked" email does not match any of those.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h4>Now let's look at all the negative rules here (starting with a <code>!</code>) which are meant to exclude content (if this rule is true, then the <code>URI_PHISH</code> rule will NOT apply):</h4>

<ul>
<li><code>!__URI_GOOGLE_DOC</code> and  <code>!__URI_GOOG_STO_HTML</code> → regexp on <code>docs\.google\.com</code> and <code>storage\.googleapis\.com</code>, they got their own special rule so are excluded here.</li>
<li><code>!ALL_TRUSTED</code> → this is for when you configure some internal email servers as "trusted", not applicable here</li>
<li><code>!__UNSUB_LINK</code> → ⚠️ Also interesting, this one tries to match unsubscribe links with <code>/\b(?:(?:un)?subscri(?:ber?|ptions?)|abuses?|opt(?:ing)?.?out)\b/i</code>. This is good to know that simply having an unsubscribe link could prevent <code>URI_PHISH</code>, but unfortunately for an account confirmation email you can't really "unsubscribe" people, this is not a mailing list or on-boarding email. Otherwise this would have a been a good option to improve both the spam score and the user experience.</li>
<li><code>!__VIA_ML</code> → this rule checks if the envelope-from/return-path contains "bounces@" to declare this is a "Mailing List". In my case using <a href="https://postmarkapp.com/">Postmark</a> this is the case and cannot be customized unfortunately (only the domain: <code>pm_bounces@bounce.updown.io</code>). So I guess you should avoid using "bounces@" in your return path addresses for transactional emails if you can... </li>
</ul>

<h4>And now let's have a look at my favorites: the totally WTF rules 😱:</h4>

<ul>
<li><code>!__TAG_EXISTS_CENTER</code> → this rule just checks for the presence of a <code>&lt;center&gt;</code> tag. So if you add one, magically your email is no longer <code>URI_PHISH</code>... WAIT, WHAT? Surely if your email is centered the old way, then it's not phishing (tested locally).</li>
<li><code>!__HAS_SENDER</code> → if you add ANY <code>Sender</code> header, the <code>URI_PHISH</code> rule is skipped… The goal of the Sender header is for services sending emails on behalf of other users, it helps for authentication validations. But anybody can put anything in here, so there's no reason to consider an email "less phishing" because it contains this header. (tested locally)</li>
<li><code>!__CAN_HELP</code> →  even simpler, this will skip the rule if the email contains "can help"... (tested locally)</li>
<li><code>!__UPPERCASE_URI</code> → pretty self-explanatory</li>
<li><code>!__HAS_CC</code> → what? why?</li>
<li><code>!__NUMBERS_IN_SUBJ</code> → OK so more than 3 digits in subject line also helps...  <code>/\d{3}/</code></li>
<li><code>!__FB_COST</code> → this is one checks for  the word... "cost". Yep, just that. Put it in an email and suddenly it's not phishing... (tested locally) </li>
<li><code>!__FB_TOUR</code> → similarly this one checks for the word "tour"...</li>
</ul>

<p>It's likely that some of these rules are only here to replace <code>URI_PHISH</code> by another one more specific maybe (like we saw the case with Google Doc URLs), but still in this state it's pretty easy to exploit them and in my testing locally, using those words to trigger those rules didn't cause other spam rules to appear...</p>

<p>Which means that in the end we have a spam filter which is very easy to fool, yet easily tripped by honest emails...</p>

<h3>What I changed in the end</h3>

<ol>
<li>I tried changing the <strong>return-path</strong> to avoid "bounces@" but couldn't do it with Postmark unfortunately.</li>
<li>I did not want to ~use~ <strong>exploit</strong> any of the stupid hacks like "cost" or "&lt;center&gt;".</li>
<li>I changed the <strong>wording</strong> of the email to make it longer and avoid the common word combinations matched in the regexp (see screenshot below for the new version)</li>
<li>I also added a <code>Sender</code> header (only for some emails and with the same value as <code>From</code>) in order to please the rules because this one doesn't look too hackish, but I still don't feel great about this 🙃.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Over 13 years, one man stole $2.3 million in fares from Edmonton LTR one coin at a time using a car antenna and magnet. </h2>

<p>Maintaining public transit ticket machines is crucial to keeping cities moving but not a job that would normally generate headlines. That is unless you’re Salim Kara, who for 13 years used a car antenna and magnet to pilfer $ 2.3 million of fares from Edmonton’s LTR, one coin at a time. Finally caught in 1994, Salim’s <a href="https://www.nofreelunch.co.uk/blog/what-is-salami-slicing-scam/">salami-slicing style scam</a> had netted him 37 tonnes of small change and minor celebrity status. Here’s the fascinating story of Salim Kara’s coin scam in full.</p>



<p>Originally from Uganda but of East Indian descent, Salim Kara fled Idi Amin’s regime in 1972 for England, eventually migrating to Canada and settling in Edmonton, the capital of the province of Alberta. </p>



<h2>Magnet fishing for coins</h2>



<p>In 1981, Kara was hired on a $ 38k-a-year salary to maintain and fix the 68 ticket machines of Edmonton’s LRT – light rail transit system. From the get-go, it seems Salim wasn’t satisfied with being paid $17.66 per hour, so began supplementing his pay by pilfering a portion of the fares.</p>



<p>As Kara only maintained the machine function, he didn’t have direct access to the cash box where the coins were collected after customers had fed them to purchase LRT tickets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Working alone and at night, he developed a simple yet ingenious method for fishing those coins out.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He removed the face plate from the ticket machines, which as a repairman would raise no suspicion, then rigged a car antenna with a magnetic tip, like a make-shift fishing rod. Coin-by-coin, Kara hooked his catch out of the ticketing machine cash box into a shaving bag, which acted as his keep net.</p>



<p><strong>Banking his heavy booty</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://www.nofreelunch.co.uk/blog/what-is-salami-slicing-scam/">Salami-slicing scams</a> focus on stealing tiny amounts of money in the hope that the size of the theft makes it unnoticeable. <a href="https://www.nofreelunch.co.uk/blog/what-was-coin-clipping/">Coin clipping</a>, the removal of small slithers of silver or gold coins, is the original salami-slicing scam, dating back to Roman times, but ended around the 17th century as coin designs became more sophisticated and eventually of no intrinsic value.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The digital age opened up a new era of salami-slicing opportunities, the best of which we’ve summarised in a separate article on computer crimes, but it is unusual for modern salami-slicing type scams to focus on coins.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.nofreelunch.co.uk/blog/why-cash-is-more-anonymous-than-crypto/">Cash is king where organised criminals are concerned</a>, given its untraceable nature, but their preference is for high-value bank notes. </p>



<p>Salim Kara was no King Pin; just a petty criminal with a unique gift and the patience to play the long game, quietly siphoning coins day by day over more than a decade and creating a convincing cover story to enable him to launder the proceeds.</p>



<p>Kara told his bank that he ran a successful machine-vending business. News reports estimated that he stole an average of $3k a week over 13 years, but Kara’s scheme received a boost in 1987 when Canada introduced the $1 loonie, almost doubling his weekly take.</p>



<p>Like an urban pirate, soon Kara was lugging $900 home daily in loot and around $5k a week. </p>



<blockquote>
<p>Such was the scale of coins that Kara accumulated that his bank allowed him to drag his booty through the back door and even considered expanding their vault to accommodate the volume of coinage Kara was regularly hauling in.</p>
<cite>Edmonton Journal, December 2010</cite></blockquote>



<h2><strong>Kara’s coin-powered property empire</strong></h2>



<p>Over time the proceeds from Salim Kara’s scam began to pile up, so he began investing, including a house in Victoria and two other houses in Edmonton. He also sunk $ 1 million into a term deposit but could crucially keep his distance from these visible signs of wealth.</p>



<p>Perhaps one of the main reasons why Kara could maintain his grift so long was being smart enough to keep a low profile locally, helped by the image he presented driving a dilapidated 1977 Chevrolet Malibu.</p>



<p>Sooner or later, the temptation to spend became too much and maybe thinking he would never get caught in 1992, Kara decided to trade up from his modest $136,000 home to something much more fitting of a vending-machine millionaire.</p>



<p>His mountain of coins financed the building of a $ 1 million house in an exclusive area of Edmonton with five bedrooms, five bathrooms, an indoor jacuzzi, a steam room, an indoor fountain and a garage for four cars with a built-in car wash.</p>



<p>If asked about the source of his funds, Kara claimed to have sold properties in England and made various claims to be employed in investment banking or owning a computer repair business.&nbsp;</p>



<div>
<p><strong>Salim Kara’s Coin Scam in numbers</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>$2,327,890 </strong>– total amount stolen&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>13 years</strong> – how long he maintained the salami-slicing scam</li>



<li><strong>37 tonnes</strong> – estimated total weight of stolen coins</li>



<li><strong>2 million </strong>– the number of passenger fares Kara’s crime equated to</li>



<li><strong>150km</strong> – the approximate length of Kara’s haul laid end-to-end; six times the length of the entire Edmonton LTR network</li>



<li><strong>$2,959</strong> – the average amount stolen per week</li>
</ul>
</div>



<h2><strong>All good things come to an end</strong></h2>



<p>Kara was effectively stealing 20% of LRT fares over the 13-year period; one in five coins that were fed into the machines by the paying public ended up in his shaving bag, amounting to around 2 million customer journeys. It seems inconceivable that he wasn’t caught sooner.</p>



<p>The failure to catch him, despite discrepancies between fares and cash raised in two audits, was put down to a belief that the errors were software glitches and, after his arrest, led to a significant amount of internal finger-pointing.</p>



<p>There were suspicions and even video-taped evidence of Kara acting very strangely a year before he was finally caught, but inadequate processes for whistleblowing meant that it took another year for the alarm to be finally raised.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 1993, with the red flags mounting up, the city authorities hired private investigators to observe Kara, which finally caught him in the act. In March 1994, he sliced off the final piece of this very lucrative salami.</p>



<div>
<div>
<p>Two years later, aged 44, Kara was sentenced to four years in jail. Given the unique nature of his crime, the trial attracted plenty of public attention packing out the courthouse, but Kara’s infamy spread further when his attempts to avoid attention outside the courts backfired. </p>



<p>He was rumbled dressing up in disguise worthy of Inspector Clouseau – complete with dark glasses, woolly beanie and trenchcoat – which only heightened interest in him.</p>

</div>



<p>‘There are about 600,000 people living in the city. You have stolen from every citizen, man, woman and child approximately $4 each.’ Associate Chief Justice, A.H. Wachowich commented ahead of passing down the sentence.</p>



<p>As Kara repaid the proceeds of his scam to cover the city’s insurers, he was released after 16 months.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Given the fascinating nature of the crime, the length of time it was maintained and the lifestyle it financed, there were rumours of a book deal, but to date, that hasn’t materialised.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before his sentencing in March 1996, Kara made an enigmatic statement in court, promising at some point to share his side of this fascinating tale “<em>Remember, every coin has two sides</em>”</p>

The code samples are written in a Typescript with some simplifications so that the code is readable on mobile and to make them more concise and easy to follow.

I recommend reading that one too!</p><p><img src="https://damoonrashidi.me/articles/flow-field-methods/example-1.webp?__frsh_c=35d83479d7e5b288d9b64df7753f8a599aa80b3d" alt="Flow field example one" width="300" height="475"><img src="https://damoonrashidi.me/articles/flow-field-methods/example-2.webp?__frsh_c=35d83479d7e5b288d9b64df7753f8a599aa80b3d" alt="Flow field example two" width="300" height="475"><img src="https://damoonrashidi.me/articles/flow-field-methods/example-3.webp?__frsh_c=35d83479d7e5b288d9b64df7753f8a599aa80b3d" alt="Flow field example three" width="300" height="475"></p><h2 id="noise-functions">Noise functions</h2><p>The main driving force behind these flow field images is usually a noise function. Without regurgitating the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise">wikipedia article</a>, a noise function is a function that takes a coordinate in 2d space (higher dimension noise-functions also exist, but are irrelevant for the purpose of this article) and returns a value in the range <code>-1..=1</code> such as points close together return similar, but slightly different, values.</p><p>The interactive illustration below shows how this works by uniformly sampling points in a grid and calling the noise function for that point. Note that the values have been rounded to one decimal for legibility, the actual values have far more precision. Click <code>Regenerate</code> to run the noise function again with a new seed to get new noise values.</p><!--frsh-articles_flow_fields_noise_noiseillustration:0:--><!--/frsh-articles_flow_fields_noise_noiseillustration:0:--><p>And here is the code that generated the image above, abbreviated for clarity.</p><!--frsh-articles_code_code:1:--><pre>[<span>object</span> <span>Object</span>]</pre><!--/frsh-articles_code_code:1:--><p>To make it a bit easier to digest, we can visualize this in a more effective manner by translating the noise values into degrees and draw lines from a starting position and a few pixels following the degree of the noise value.</p><!--frsh-articles_flow_fields_noise_angles_noiseangleillustration:2:--><!--/frsh-articles_flow_fields_noise_angles_noiseangleillustration:2:--><!--frsh-articles_code_code:3:--><pre>[<span>object</span> <span>Object</span>]</pre><!--/frsh-articles_code_code:3:--><p>This doesn't look like much currently. It would appear that lines are fairly disjointed and go off in seemingly random directions. Not at all the smooth effect we're going for.</p><p>It turns out that noise functions are pretty sensitive. You'd think that the points<code>(1.0, 1.0)</code> and <code>(1.0, 2.0)</code> would produce somewhat similar noise values, following the rule that points in close proximity yield fairly similar noise values, but they're not close enough to each other.</p><p>To combat this we can force our points to be closer together by just dividing our x and y coordinates by some smoothness constant. For example, the distance between our two example points was previously <code>1.0</code> for the y-axis, and <code>0.0</code> for the x-axis, for a total distance of <code>1.0</code>.</p><p>If we divide all our x and y values by the constant <code>smoothness = 100</code>  we'd end up with: <code>p1 = (0.01, 0.01), p2 = (0.01, 0.02)</code>, making the distance only <code>0.01</code>, but keeping the relation between the points the same.</p><p>The only change we need to make to our code is the following:</p><!--frsh-articles_code_code:4:--><pre>[<span>object</span> <span>Object</span>]</pre><!--/frsh-articles_code_code:4:--><p>You can think of it as shrinking our domain to better fit the noise values. Or zooming in on the noise function if that helps.</p><!--frsh-articles_flow_fields_noise_angles_noiseangleillustration:5:--><!--/frsh-articles_flow_fields_noise_angles_noiseangleillustration:5:--><p>As we can see by dragging the smoothness value up, closer to 100 in this case, the lines start to smooth out and patterns start to emerge.</p><h2 id="drawing-lines">Drawing lines.</h2><p>At this point we know how to navigate the flow field. Pick any point <code>P</code>, read the noise value <code>n</code> for that point and increment <code>P.x</code> by <code>cos(n)</code> and <code>P.y</code> by <code>sin(n)</code> as well as some extra pixels that represents the distance we want to travel in the direction of the field.</p><p>We did this in the previous examples by sampling points in a grid and and having a fixed line length. To approximate the effect illustrated in the images at the beginning of this article a bit better another implementation is necessary. First we need to pick a random point on the canvas and then ride the flow field until we get out of bounds.</p><!--frsh-articles_code_code:6:--><pre>[<span>object</span> <span>Object</span>]</pre><!--/frsh-articles_code_code:6:--><!--frsh-articles_flow_fields_building_line_buildingaline:7:--><!--/frsh-articles_flow_fields_building_line_buildingaline:7:--><p>Going from the above example to drawing an actual line should now be trivial. Start at any given point on the canvas an instantiate your line, move through the field just as before, but instead of drawing a new point at the given position add it to the points for the line. Stop the loop when the line has reached the end of the canvas and finally draw the line.</p><!--frsh-articles_code_code:8:--><pre>[<span>object</span> <span>Object</span>]</pre><!--/frsh-articles_code_code:8:--><p>Mouse over the illustration below to create new lines from your mouse position.</p><!--frsh-articles_flow_fields_noise_line_noiselineillustration:9:--><!--/frsh-articles_flow_fields_noise_line_noiselineillustration:9:--><h2 id="experimenting-with-lines">Experimenting with lines.</h2><p>So far not a lot of variance has been achieved. All results, no matter what the seed of the noise function is, will yield somewhat similar images. There are a few ways to combat this, one way is by warping the noise value a bit, resulting in lines exaggerating their turns, this is done by simply multiplying the noise value by some constant before applying the <code>cos()</code> and <code>sin()</code> functions.</p><!--frsh-articles_code_code:10:--><pre>[<span>object</span> <span>Object</span>]</pre><!--/frsh-articles_code_code:10:--><p>Another way is by varying the length of the steps each line takes between each step as it progresses through the field.

A proper noise function is a bit complicated and out of scope for this article, but nothing is stopping us from writing a function that returns similar values for a given coordinate, that part can be done pretty easily.</p><p>These home grown functions won't yield as random seeming results as a noise function but they will let us control the final output much more. They will also let us be much more creative in trying new things out now that we can draw lines that reliably follow a path.</p><p>An easy first test we can do is simply taking a coordinate and return it's distance to another point that we'll call the <code>focalPoint</code>, just to see what would happen.

Instead of stopping when we reach the end of the canvas or we've reached the max line length we can instead stop when this line would collide with another line.</p><p>Hover the illustration (or slide your finger over it) to add lines of varying width.</p><!--frsh-articles_flow_fields_collision_detection_collisiondetectionillustration:18:--><!--/frsh-articles_flow_fields_collision_detection_collisiondetectionillustration:18:--><p>Now, a lot can be said about collision detection and how to make it performant. I'll show only one method and a small optimization to keep the solution somewhat performant.</p><p>Checking the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line%E2%80%93line_intersection">intersection of two straight lines</a> isn't too bad and can be done in O(1) time. Our lines aren't straight however so we'll have to be a bit more clever. If we go back to the beginning of how we drew the line, it started with stepping through the noise field and adding a point for each step. If we made that point into a circle by giving it same radius as the line and kept track of each circle, not just in the line but in all lines it's a lot easier to check if the circle we are about to draw overlaps any other circle.</p><p>Checking if two circles overlap is only a matter of checking if the sum of their radii is smaller than the distance between their origo.</p><!--frsh-articles_code_code:19:--><pre>[<span>object</span> <span>Object</span>]</pre><!--/frsh-articles_code_code:19:--><p>Here is another illustration that highlights when two non-linear lines meet using this method. Play with the illustration to move the colliding line.</p><!--frsh-articles_flow_fields_collision_example_collisionexampleillustration:20:--><!--/frsh-articles_flow_fields_collision_example_collisionexampleillustration:20:--><!--frsh-articles_code_code:21:--><pre>[<span>object</span> <span>Object</span>]</pre><!--/frsh-articles_code_code:21:--><h3 id="optimizing-collision-detection">Optimizing it slightly.</h3><p>These example illustrations are fairly small so we haven't ran into any performance issues when checking if our line collides with any other line... yet. When trying to make a larger image however, in a print-friendly size for instance, we'd end up with a lot of lines with a lot of points that we could potentially collide with, meaning that for every new point we add we must check collisions against all other points. This stacks up fast and will make your render times a lot longer than desired. A way to mitigate this is to only check against points that are close enough for us to collide with.</p><p>The simplest way of doing that is by dividing our canvas up into a grid of boxes and whenever we are about to add a new point check which box it would go in, and then only check against collisions with points in that box.</p><p>Time for another illustration. This time, move your finger or mouse cursor around to see which points belong to the same box.</p><!--frsh-articles_flow_fields_pointmap_pointmapillustration:22:--><!--/frsh-articles_flow_fields_pointmap_pointmapillustration:22:--><p>Now, with 100 boxes (10 across, 10 down) and if the points are distributed uniformly on the canvas, we end up doing 1/100<sup>th</sup> as many checks that we did previously, increasing rendering performance by quite a bit! One thing to note however, is that if our boxes would be too small to reliably hold points with the radius of our lines then we'd start to get overlapping lines at the edges. This would also happen if a points origo was at the very edge of a box, causing its body to spill outside the boxes area. We could fix that by checking surrounding boxes for collisions as well, but that would mean we'd check another eight boxes besides the current one, increasing the search space a bit, but the result would be more exact.</p><p>A final optimisation we can do with this technique is that if our step size (the distance between each point in each line) is sufficiently small we could skip checking a few points in the box, since if our circle overlaps with one of the circles there's a high chance that it overlaps with some other circles as well. Now this might yield a less accurate result, but accuracy is not necessarly the end goal. Some small overlaps for a few lines might introduce some visually pleasing artifacts. Usually those kinds of details are <em>happy little accidents</em>.</p><!--frsh-articles_code_code:23:--><pre>[<span>object</span> <span>Object</span>]</pre><!--/frsh-articles_code_code:23:--><p>Here we check against every 7<sup>th</sup> circle in a box hoping to get a hit if there is one. The constant <code>7</code> might be too high in some cases, or could be increased even more, it all depends on the step size for the lines and can be tweaked to get a good balance between render times and correctness.</p><h2 id="colors">Finally, Colors.</h2><p>The theme for this article is converging to <em>"you can achieve a lot of variation with some tweaks"</em>. That's true for applying colors to these images as well. So far things in this article have been pretty monochrome to focus on the underlying techniques of how to achieve the overarching look.</p><p>The easiest way to get some color in there is to create a palette with a few different colors and picking at random when creating a new line.</p><!--frsh-articles_code_code:24:--><pre>[<span>object</span> <span>Object</span>]</pre><!--/frsh-articles_code_code:24:--><!--frsh-articles_flow_fields_color_colorillustration:25:--><!--/frsh-articles_flow_fields_color_colorillustration:25:--><p>Another coloring method is by coloring each line by the angle of the noise function where the line started. This will yield a gradient like coloring across larger images.</p><!--frsh-articles_code_code:26:--><pre>[<span>object</span> <span>Object</span>]</pre><!--/frsh-articles_code_code:26:--><!--frsh-articles_flow_fields_color_colorillustration:27:--><!--/frsh-articles_flow_fields_color_colorillustration:27:--><p>Finally, my favorite method is by subdividing the canvas into a set of regions, either by some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_with_Red_Blue_and_Yellow">Piet Mondrian Composition style</a>, or recursively splitting the canvas into more and more refined polygons. After the canvas has been divided I assign each region a color and whenever a line spawns assign it the color of the region it spawned in.</p><p>This method creates a nice effect where things don't look as disjointed and more like streams of paint flowing into other buckets of paint.</p><!--frsh-articles_flow_fields_color_colorillustration:28:--><!--/frsh-articles_flow_fields_color_colorillustration:28:--><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Even though this article got quite long, it only scratches the surface of all the variants that can be achieved using the fundamental techniques described. I highly recommend trying things out and experimenting, swapping a <code>cos()</code> for a <code>sin()</code> somewhere, or maybe even a <code>tan()</code> if you're crazy.</p><p>Try subdividing the canvas into subregions who all have their own rules, or maybe dive deeper into noise functions. Or have a small border around the canvas and let some small percent of the lines escape it. Why use lines at all? Why not circles or squares or blobs?</p><p>Thanks for sticking in there this long, hope it was helpful.</p></article></div>]]></description>

Humans used storytelling to build society: where we came from; why we’re here; what exists after death; what creates meaning; what’s right and what’s wrong. Daily health related decisions have historically been influenced by story. For example, ideological lists of what one can and cannot eat. Social norms signaling what’s fashionable. Meaning-making to inform what is desirable and laudable. </p><p>

STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering &amp; Math) offered up a new way to approach health. </p><p>

Blueprint is STEM for health. My team and I had endeavored to do what no one had ever done: enable a body to run itself. Practically, I do this by routinely taking hundreds of measurements of my body’s biological processes, enabling my heart, liver, lungs and kidneys to speak for themselves what they need to be in their ideal state. My mind - a story telling creature - is <i><b>unauthorized </b></i>to grocery shop, peruse the pantry, spontaneously order pizza, eat a dessert - to basically make any food related decision. This is my Autonomous Self. </p><p>

My practical and immediate objective is <a href="https://medium.com/future-literacy/my-goal-alignment-problem-d90e0c14b717" target="_blank">Goal Aligning</a> the 35+ trillion cells that make me who I am. Aligning, as best I can, for optimal health and youth.&nbsp;</p><p><b>wtf does any of that even mean? </b><br>This time, our time, right now - the early 21st century - will be defined by the radical evolution of intelligence: human, AI and biology. Our opportunity is to <i><b>be</b></i> this exciting future.&nbsp;</p><p>

Aspire to look and feel your very best? Opt into a system where your body + science and data do the work. It’s akin to saying yes to the internet, computers and AI to improve our lives in ways that exceed our natural abilities.&nbsp;</p><p>This Automation - and the elimination of self destructive behaviors - allows us to improve at the rate at which you can automate important functions without thinking about them - in this case, your health.

	<div grid-col="8" grid-pad="2.5"><p>This thought experiment cleared the fog overlaying my mind. It was 2013 and I’d just sold Braintree Venmo for $800 million in cash, achieving my goal to become independently wealthy by age 30 (I was four years late). A blazing fire had ignited within me when, from ages 19 to 21, I lived among extreme poverty in Ecuador. </p><p>

From that point on, contemplations on how to improve the future of intelligent life were constantly simmering in my mind.Flush with cash, what do I do? And more importantly, what do I not do? 99% of what happens today will be forgotten to history. The future is distant, barely audible. The present is overbearingly loud. Focus on what the 25th century would value.</p><p>

This month is my ten year anniversary check-in (the first 10 years are always the hardest):</p><p>

<b>2016 decision</b>: founded <a href="http://kernel.com/">@KernelCo</a> Our mental health and wellness, and the evolution of our minds, will determine whether we survive ourselves. Seven years in, we’ve built the first non-invasive neuroimaging system capable of planetary scale. What gets measured improves. Currently in clinical trials for depression and dementia.</p><p>

<b>2020 decision</b>: Founded Blueprint to explore a defining question of our time: is death inevitable? Created, and made free for all, potentially the most powerful health protocol in history?</p><p>

<b>2023 decision</b>: DON’T DIE, the rallying cry of the 21st century. <br>Don’t:
<br>
… die;
<br>
… kill each other;<br>
… destroy our biosphere;
<br>
… underestimate the importance of aligning with AI.</p><p>

After billions of years of evolutionary advance, we are on the cusp of what could be the most extraordinary existence in the galaxy.&nbsp; May we have the courage and wisdom to believe that now is the very beginning.</p></div>

<h2>Blueprint Principles</h2><p>
For thousands of years, the human experience has been roughly the same. &nbsp;Things are about to change, and radically. Blueprint is about riding the torrid waves of technological and scientific progress into the future.&nbsp;</p><p>Principle 1: Self destructive behavior is kinda insane<br>
Principle 2: Empower your body to speak for itself&nbsp;<br>
Principle 3: The aspirations we need are beyond our imagination&nbsp;<br>
Principle 4: Look in the darkness to avoid being blinded by the light</p><h2>Principle 1: self destructive behavior is kinda insane&nbsp;<br></h2>
<br><div grid-col="8" grid-pad="2.5" grid-row="" grid-gutter="5" grid-responsive=""><p>Isn’t it weird that we commit the same self destructive behaviors hundreds or even thousands of times in a lifetime? Even when we know they shorten our life, accelerate disease and aging, cloud our judgement and make us feel miserable.&nbsp;</p><p>

Maybe this behavior is a little embarrassing as the self proclaimed most intelligent species on this planet? &nbsp;</p><p>

What if we didn’t commit self harm? What if it wasn’t normalized and gleefully blessed and encouraged by society?&nbsp;</p><p>

If you’d like to stop this insanity...:identify the worst version of yourself. For me, it was 7pm Bryan who would eat everything in sight to try and momentarily escape life pain. He is a monster, overpowering, and indifferent about all other Bryans needs. A sweet talker and expert rationalizer.&nbsp; 7pm Bryan ruins life quality for all other Bryans: </p><ul><li>awful sleep</li><li>overweight</li><li>poor health</li><li>accelerated aging &amp; disease </li><li>turbulent emotions</li><li>depressing life outlook</li></ul><p>The solution: revoking 7pm Bryan’s authority to eat food.</p><p>Now your turn: </p><ul><li>Step 1: identify your 20% rascal.. <br></li><li>Step 2: list what decisions they are and are not authorized to make<br></li><li>Step 3: wait for them to appear <br></li><li>Step 4: approve or deny their requests using step 2 list&nbsp; <br></li><li>Step 5: celebrate happy you for stopping self harm.<br></li></ul>
<p>Believe it or not, this is your most consequential and powerful life intervention.&nbsp;<br>
</p></div>
<h2>Principle #2: Empower your body to speak for itself</h2>What and when I eat is decided by asking my heart, liver, lungs and my other 70+ organs what they need to be optimal. This is done by doing hundreds of organ measurements on a regular basis and then carefully analyzing gold standard scientific evidence. <p>
My mind is demoted, Self is elevated. </p><p>

Allowing our minds to do whatever it wants, whenever it wants, and offering any explanation it wants is a bedrock of our reality. So firmly rooted that it’s beyond most of our imaginations that it would be checked by any other system of decision making.&nbsp;</p><p>

Blueprint takes better care of me than I was ever able. It will for you too.&nbsp;</p><h2>Principle #3: The aspirations we need are beyond our imaginations&nbsp;</h2><br>
It would have been hard to predict the books that would be written with the introduction of the printing press; or what the internet would enable. The same principle applies to what the human race can become when paired with the torrid wave of technological and scientific progress. We can take baby steps as we work on stretching our imaginations:&nbsp;<ul><li> Week 1: drink the Green Giant (GG) daily. <br></li><li>
Week 2: GG + Super Veggie (SV) daily.<br></li><li>
Week 3: GG + SV + Nutty Pudding (NP) daily. <br></li><li>
Week 4: GG + SV + NP + supplements daily.<br></li></ul>
 [<a href="https://protocol.bryanjohnson.com/Step-1-Step-2-Step-3" rel="history">Recipes</a>]<h2>Principle 4: Look in the Darkness to avoid being blinded by the light&nbsp;</h2><br>
A person is looking for their keys under a street light. Someone walks by and inquires, “Are you certain you lost your keys here?”<p>

“No” they reply, “I lost them across the street.”</p><p>

Confused, the stranger says, “Then why are you looking here?”</p><p>

They responded, “The light is much brighter here!”
</p><p>

#</p><p>
Common reactions to Blueprint: </p><ul><li>Bryan, you are surely miserable</li><li>It would be hilarious if Bryan got hit by a bus, lol&nbsp; </li><li>I’d rather die than eat veggies, berries and nuts </li><li>This is dystopic </li><li>I wish u knew my joy of pizza + donuts</li></ul><br>
Or, maybe is it? <br>
<ul><li>I have no control over myself&nbsp;</li><li>Change is hard for me</li><li>I am scared of being left behind</li><li>I’m addicted to self sabotage</li><li>Without unlimited choice to do whatever I want, existence doesn’t make sense to me </li></ul><br>
I hear you. I’ve been there. Felt and thought all these things. <p>

We all know this: no one wants to be sick, diseased and sad. We all want exceptional health and vibrancy.&nbsp;</p></projectcontent>

Boil until tender (7-9 min). Steaming is also acceptable. </li><li>Lentils: bring the water to boil in a medium saucepan. Add lentils. Reduce heat to low and cook uncovered for 18-20 or minutes until "al dente". Place in a colander to drain and rinse under cold water<br></li><li>You can choose to blend or keep whole pieces. </li><li>Blend in a high-speed blender place 1 Tbsp of dried cumin, 1 Tbsp of apple cider vinegar, 1 fresh Lime, cooked black lentils, the strained cooked vegetables, and blend until it becomes thick soup. Can also serve as the picture above. </li><li>If needed add some of the vegetable water (or steaming water) to thin out the texture. </li><li>Top with hemp seeds.</li></ul><p>Prepared correctly, taste should be an easy and smooth tasting veggie hummus. No smell/taste of garlic. </p><p>I season it with <a href="https://amzn.to/3KVhqM2" target="_blank">NuSalt</a> (potassium chloride).&nbsp; </p><p>
*Cooked via low temperature, high humidity, high acidity, high antioxidant cooking methods to minimize formation of Advanced Glycation End-products (AGEs) and Advanced Lipid Peroxidation End-products (ALEs).</p><p><i>A note on Super Veggie taste. The food I eat is delicious to me; one of the most exciting moments of my day. Both my teenage boys, mother, father, and brother eat the same foods daily and they love them too. When starting, sometimes there is a period of adaptation and some want to play with the recipe and texture. </i></p><p>
 Blueprint breaks all kinds of social norms which predictably triggers human responses that draw those lines. My favorite: my 16 yr old eats Super Veggie for school lunch. His friend offering his observations 😂

They were part of an experiment seeking to discover whether a carefully curated selection of plants and animals could develop into a self-sustaining ecosystem: a “Biosphere 2” independent of “Biosphere 1”, aka the outside world.</p><p data-component="paragraph">In terms of proving grand ecological truths the Biosphere 2 experiments were something of a bust. As an illustration of what can happen when somewhat fringe-y science meets extreme wealth they were fascinating. There were fierce fallings-out on both sides of the glass. In 1994 Ed Bass, an oil dynast who had paid for the facility, threw out the management team and handed the reins to Steve Bannon, later a key adviser to Donald Trump. At the same time, though, there was what some took to be a breakthrough in the science of human ageing.</p><p data-component="paragraph">One of the eight biospherians was Roy Walford, a professor of pathology at the University of California, Los Angeles (<small>ucla</small>). Research by Walford and others had shown that restricting what animals ate could significantly lengthen their lives. The lifespans of nematode worms, fruit flies, rodents and dogs could be extended as much as 50% by laboratory protocols which gave them a diet with all the nutrients they needed in terms of minerals, vitamins and the like but fewer calories than were seen as normal.</p><p data-component="paragraph">Biosphere 2 allowed him to test the theory on humans in no position to sneak off for snacks. With a daily intake of 1,750-2,100 calories (7,320-8,790 kilojoules) the biospherians, trim to begin with, all slimmed down. But after eight months their weight stabilised. Gaunt as they were, their energy levels remained high. Blood tests showed physiological responses which matched those of calorie-restricted rodents with extended lifespans.</p><p data-component="paragraph">Some people have taken this as a reason to incorporate calorie restriction into their lives, as Walford did. But such diets, which go well beyond the sort of weight-restricting efforts to which any sensible person might aspire, are hard to maintain. That has provoked an interest in finding ways to get the benefits of calorie restriction without having to engage in it.</p><h2>The garden of forking paths </h2><p data-component="paragraph">Calories are a measure of the amount of energy that cells can get from breaking food into its component chemical parts. The precise nature of that breaking down, and what happens with all the parts, is under the control of a range of signalling pathways which have the job of matching what the cell is doing with how much energy the organism needs and has available. Dysfunction in these nutrient-signalling pathways is one of the 12 hallmarks of ageing listed by Dr López-Otín and his colleagues.</p><p data-component="paragraph">If there is a general truth behind the success of calorie restriction, it is that when energy is on the scarce side, the nutrient signalling pathways in cells pay greater attention to what is going on and keep the cell in better shape. What is necessary if the same pathways are to be recruited without the calorie reduction is an understanding of what other cues can have the same effect.</p><p data-component="paragraph">The research would be both easier to do and easier to understand if these pathways all had distinct, clearly understood functions. Alas, this is not the case. Pathways frequently regulate more than one function, functions are frequently regulated by more than one pathway and the farthest-flung parts of pathways are often obscure. To make things yet less comprehensible, the proteins involved in the pathways have incredibly opaque names.</p><p data-component="paragraph">Take the <small>MTORC1 </small>pathway. The complex of proteins which gives it its name first came to attention because an immune suppressant called rapamycin has a strong effect on it: hence “mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1”. That gives no real clue, however, to the fact that the signalling pathway in which <small>MTORC1 </small>sits is a complex set of controls and feedbacks designed to regulate metabolism in response both to the availability of nutrients (for example, glucose, which provides energy, and amino acids, from which proteins are made) and impediments to their use (for example, low oxygen levels).</p><p data-component="paragraph">The ambit of this regulatory power is broad; it influences the rate at which cells break down damaged internal structures (“autophagy”), the balance of their protein content (“proteostasis”) and the reproduction of their mitochondria, components responsible for turning the calories it receives into a form of energy its proteins can use. Autophagy, proteostasis and mitochondrial reproduction are three more of the 12 hallmarks of ageing.</p><h2>Rap of ages</h2><p data-component="paragraph">What is more, rapamycin, the effects of which give <small>MTORC1</small> its name, turns out to lengthen the lives of lab animals even though it curbs their immune responses. This has led some longevity enthusiasts to seek off-label prescriptions for it. But its side-effects, including anaemia and an insensitivity to insulin, make rapamycin ill-suited for widespread use. There is thus a search for “rapalogs” which provide the benefits of a tuned-up<small> MTORC1</small> pathway without so many costs.</p><p data-component="paragraph">Another pathway which calorie-restriction studies have marked out as promising is named after a protein called <small>AMPK</small> (don’t ask). This regulates the production of <small>ATP</small>, a small energy-carrying molecule produced in mitochondria. When <small>ATP</small> levels fall, the <small>AMPK</small> pathway increases a cell’s sensitivity to insulin.</p><p data-component="paragraph">Metformin, a drug used to treat type-<small>2</small> diabetes, does so by activating the <small>AMPK</small> pathway. Like rapamycin, it extends the lifespans of healthy mice. It does the same for diabetic humans. A study published in 2014 showed that diabetes patients treated with metformin enjoyed a decreased mortality rate, not just compared with patients who were not treated with it, but also with healthy controls who were not given the drug.</p><p data-component="paragraph">Not surprisingly, metformin is also used off-label, probably more widely than rapamycin. The American Federation for Ageing Research, a not-for-profit organisation, hopes soon to start a six-year, 3,000-person clinical trial to measure its effects in people from 65- to 79-years-old. The Targeting Ageing with Metformin (<small>TAME</small>) trial will see if metformin helps prevent cardiovascular disease, cancer and cognitive decline; it will also test the hypothesis that it reduces all-cause mortality.</p><p data-component="paragraph">A further set of medicines developed to treat diabetes but now used more widely are the <small>GLP-1 </small>receptor agonists. The best known, semaglutide (sold as Wegovy), has been specifically licensed in various places for use in people without diabetes who nevertheless need to lose weight. Whether they might live longer than someone of the same final weight who does not take one of the drugs is an open question. There are no published studies that show the drugs to have an effect on the lifespans of laboratory animals.</p><p data-component="paragraph">One thing that does do the job for lab animals is taurine, an amino acid widely used as a dietary supplement. According to a recent paper by Parminder Singh of the Buck Institute for Research on Ageing in Novato, California, and colleagues, in mice taurine increases lifespan by 10%; some of this seems to be due to nutrient signalling. But there are effects on four or five other hallmarks of ageing, too. Taurine levels drop with age in humans but, in those who live to be over 100, levels stay significantly higher. </p><p data-component="paragraph">Nutrient sensitivity may also be enhanced by a molecule called <small>NAD+</small>. Some enzymes—proteins which catalyse chemical reactions—require the presence of a small extra molecule to do their thing. <small>NAD+</small> is such a “co-enzyme”. More than 300 enzymes need it to be present if they are to do their bit for the cell. And if you give mice more of it, they live longer.</p><p data-component="paragraph">Considering that <small>NAD+</small> is so generous with its favours it is difficult to know exactly which of the enzymes it helps are responsible for delivering this effect. But one connection which looks particularly interesting is that with a set of proteins called sirtuins.</p><h2>La vie en vin rouge</h2><p data-component="paragraph">Sirtuins came to prominence two decades ago when David Sinclair, who is now co-director of the Centre for Biology of Ageing Research at Harvard University, showed that stimulating their production prolongs life in a variety of laboratory animals. One form of stimulation is calorie restriction. But Dr Sinclair discovered a chemical alternative: resveratrol, a molecule found, among other places, in the skins of red grapes.</p><p data-component="paragraph">Dr Sinclair is by no means publicity-shy; his discovery saw a great deal of brouhaha. He founded a company, Sirtris, to produce resveratrol derivatives suited to the human body. The work did not amount to much. Sirtris, having been bought by GlaxoSmithKline, ceased to exist as a separate entity in 2013.</p><p data-component="paragraph">That might seem a cautionary tale. But it can also be seen as grounds for hope. Sirtuins got a lot of attention because there had been no similarly credible claims about longevity for some time. Their story set out a blueprint for looking into such things: a mechanism looked interesting, a molecule seemed promising, investigations were carried out, conclusions were drawn. Many more mechanisms and drugs are now being scrutinised in the same way. Some scepticism is warranted. But there is no reason to believe that none of them will get results just because the few looked at so far have not. <span>■</span></p></div><p>This article appeared in the Technology Quarterly section of the print edition under the headline "Don’t be greedy"</p><div orientation="vertical" data-test-id="vertical"><div orientation="vertical"><figure><img alt="Why the EU must get bigger" loading="lazy" width="1280" height="1684" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/16/21/90/media-assets/image/20230930_DE_EU.jpg 16w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/32/42/90/media-assets/image/20230930_DE_EU.jpg 32w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/48/63/90/media-assets/image/20230930_DE_EU.jpg 48w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/64/84/90/media-assets/image/20230930_DE_EU.jpg 64w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/96/126/90/media-assets/image/20230930_DE_EU.jpg 96w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/128/168/90/media-assets/image/20230930_DE_EU.jpg 128w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/256/336/90/media-assets/image/20230930_DE_EU.jpg 256w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/360/473/90/media-assets/image/20230930_DE_EU.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/384/505/90/media-assets/image/20230930_DE_EU.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/480/631/90/media-assets/image/20230930_DE_EU.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/789/90/media-assets/image/20230930_DE_EU.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/834/1097/90/media-assets/image/20230930_DE_EU.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/960/1263/90/media-assets/image/20230930_DE_EU.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/1096/1441/90/media-assets/image/20230930_DE_EU.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1684/90/media-assets/image/20230930_DE_EU.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/1424/1873/90/media-assets/image/20230930_DE_EU.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1424/1873/90/media-assets/image/20230930_DE_EU.jpg"></figure></div><div orientation="vertical"><h3 orientation="vertical">From the September 30th 2023 edition</h3><p orientation="vertical">Discover stories from this section and more in the list of contents </p><a href="https://www.economist.com/printedition/2023-09-30" data-analytics="sidebar:weekly_edition"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><g fill="none" fill-rule="evenodd"><path d="M12 1c6.075 0 11 4.925 11 11s-4.925 11-11 11S1 18.075 1 12 5.925 1 12 1zm.142 4.5l-1.008 1.062c3.33 3.276 4.194 4.14 4.608 4.5-1.602-.018-3.168-.018-10.242-.018v1.584c7.074 0 8.73 0 10.242-.018-.432.36-1.314 1.206-4.608 4.536l1.008 1.044 6.354-6.354L12.142 5.5z" fill="#2E45B8" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></g></svg><span>Explore the edition</span></a></div></div></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="introduction">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>A big part of my daily work is digging around in binary blobs. I’ve been using Hiew almost exclusively for a few years, and I’m a big fan – more people should use it!</p>
<p>The problem is Hiew has a steep learning curve, so if you literally use a hex editor once a year, then it’s probably just not worth it. However, if you live in a hex editor, then it might be more interesting than you realized!</p>
<p>This article assumes you’re already familiar with another hex editor, and are curious if it’s worth your time learning Hiew.</p>
<p>Let me walk you through a few common hex editing tasks and show you how they look… maybe 0.01% of the people reading this will be intrigued 😂</p>
<section id="background">
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Let’s get this out of the way - if you’ve never seen Hiew before, it’s a console hex editor!</p>
<p>It has basic mouse support, but you primarily operate it with the keyboard. If you think <code>vim</code> looks arcane, you’re not going to enjoy using Hiew – that’s okay!</p>
<p>Hiew has been around a long time, first released in 1991. It’s still actively maintained – version 8.80 was just released in November – but it comes from an era where powerful software was usually designed around the idea of keyboard macros.</p>
<p>Like other tools built this way, Hiew has an emphasis on chaining together simple commands to perform complex tasks. That means there’s a steep learning curve before you feel proficient, but as you build up your command vocabulary you’ll be able to perform operations that look like magic.</p>
<p>Okay, Let’s dive right in!</p>
<details>
<summary>
<p>
<em>← Psst…this symbol means there’s a figure available… just click it!</em>
</p>
</summary> <span> 🎈 </span>
</details>
</section>
<section id="scenarios">
<h2>Scenarios</h2>
<section id="scenario-1">
<h3>Scenario #1</h3>
<p><em>You’re trying to understand an undocumented proprietary file format.</em></p>
<hr>
<details>
<summary> A good place to start is usually looking at the list of strings that appear in the file, that’s <kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>f6</kbd>. </summary>
<blockquote>
<figure>
<img src="https://lock.cmpxchg8b.com/img/hiew/stringlist.png" alt=""><figcaption>String List</figcaption>
</figure>
</blockquote>
</details>
<p>Hopefully that will give you some clues about what fields might be in the header. In Hiew, you mark fields using <em>blocks</em>, and you start a block with <kbd>*</kbd>.</p>
<p>I see there’s what looks like a filename near the top, so let me mark that.</p>
<blockquote>
<video controls="">
<source src="https://lock.cmpxchg8b.com/img/hiew/blocksimple.webm" type="video/webm">
</video>
</blockquote>
<p>All the usual movement commands work while you’re defining a block, including searching and jumping. Vim users will recognize this as very similar to visual mode.</p>
<p>Now that it’s marked, you can assign it a color with <kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>m</kbd>, or just give it a random color with <kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>m</kbd>.</p>
<details>
<summary> I like to just keep hitting <kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>m</kbd> until I get a color I like. </summary>
<blockquote>
<video controls="">
<source src="https://lock.cmpxchg8b.com/img/hiew/randomizecolor.webm" type="video/webm">
</video>
</blockquote>
</details>
<p>Okay, now you can watch me repeat that process for a few more fields…</p>
<blockquote>
<video controls="">
<source src="https://lock.cmpxchg8b.com/img/hiew/assignfields.webm" type="video/webm">
</video>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Tip: Feeling <kbd>s</kbd><kbd>h</kbd><kbd>o</kbd><kbd>r</kbd><kbd>t</kbd><kbd>c</kbd><kbd>u</kbd><kbd>t</kbd> overload? Don’t worry, I made <a href="https://taviso.github.io/hiewdocs/index.htm">hiewdocs</a>, an easy online shortcut reference!</p>
</blockquote>
<details>
<summary> Now we probably want to add some notes to remind us what we think a field is. In Hiew, you enter a comment with <kbd>;</kbd>. </summary>
<blockquote>
<video controls="">
<source src="https://lock.cmpxchg8b.com/img/hiew/entercomment.webm" type="video/webm">
</video>
</blockquote>
</details>
<p>Just like with a dissasembler, each location can have a <em>name</em> and a <em>comment</em>, you enter a name with <kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>f12</kbd>. They’re both optional, skip one or both if you like!</p>
<p>Once some fields are marked, you can move between them with <kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>n</kbd> (forward) and <kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>n</kbd> (backward).</p>
<details>
<summary> Hiew will display any names and comments as you navigate around as floating tips. You can also open a list with <kbd>f12</kbd> and jump straight to the one you’re interested in! </summary>
<blockquote>
<video controls="">
<source src="https://lock.cmpxchg8b.com/img/hiew/displaycomments.webm" type="video/webm">
</video>
</blockquote>
</details>
<p>I think we’re making progress. Look at this field, I think it’s the length of the data block:</p>
<blockquote>
<figure>
<img src="https://lock.cmpxchg8b.com/img/hiew/compressedsize.png" alt=""><figcaption>Calculator</figcaption>
</figure>
</blockquote>
<p>If I examine it in the calculator, as a <code>DWORD</code> that would be <code>203008</code>. Okay, Let’s extract a block of that length and save it to a file.</p>
<p>So we need to…</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Hit <kbd>*</kbd> to select a block.</li>
<li>Press <kbd>f5</kbd> to jump to an offset.</li>
<li>Enter <code>+203008t</code> to move forward that many bytes.</li>
</ol>
<details>
<summary> Now we can use <kbd>f2</kbd> to save the current block to a file. </summary>
<blockquote>
<figure>
<img src="https://lock.cmpxchg8b.com/img/hiew/writeblock.png" alt=""><figcaption>Write Block</figcaption>
</figure>
</blockquote>
</details>
<p>You can hit <kbd>backspace</kbd> to jump back to your last location when done.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tip: Hiew has about a million ways to jump around a file! Don’t worry, you don’t need to memorize them!</p>
</blockquote>
<details>
<summary> Let’s take a look at this block we saved. I think I know what this is, if I add a deflate header… </summary>
<blockquote>
<video controls="">
<source src="https://lock.cmpxchg8b.com/img/hiew/zpipe.webm" type="video/webm">
</video>
</blockquote>
<p>Ah-ha, we got back the uncompressed data!</p>
</details>
<p>You probably spotted the <code>PK</code> header, and realized this is not an undocumented file format at all, it’s a ZIP archive. Yep, you got me 🙂</p>
<p>You don’t need to go through this process for common formats like Zip, you can just use a standard template that will populate the fields for you. If I do that, the names list <kbd>f12</kbd> looks like this.</p>
<blockquote>
<figure>
<img src="https://lock.cmpxchg8b.com/img/hiew/kiewtai.png" alt=""><figcaption>Kiewtai</figcaption>
</figure>
</blockquote>
</section>
<section id="scenario-2">
<h3>Scenario #2</h3>
<p>You’re trying to patch an executable you don’t have the source code for.</p>
<hr>
<details>
<summary> The first thing you need to know is that Hiew has three main views. They are <em>text</em>, <em>code</em> and <em>data</em>. You can quickly flip between them without losing your place, just hit <kbd>enter</kbd>. Most Hiew users get into the habit of doing this frequently! </summary>
<blockquote>
<video controls="">
<source src="https://lock.cmpxchg8b.com/img/hiew/hiewviews.webm" type="video/webm">
</video>
</blockquote>
</details>
<p>Let’s take a closer look at the code view.</p>
<blockquote>
<figure>
<img src="https://lock.cmpxchg8b.com/img/hiew/codeview.png" alt=""><figcaption>Code View</figcaption>
</figure>
</blockquote>
<p>As you can see, Hiew has a builtin disassembler, very handy if you work in security and need to extract shellcode!</p>
<details>
<summary> Do you see those little arrow annotations? Those are shortcuts to follow a branch, you just hit the corresponding key to jump to the branch target. This lets you browse the code effectively without leaving Hiew.
<p>If you see <code>↓5</code>, that means it’s a forward branch and you can press <kbd>5</kbd> to jump to the destination. </p></summary>
<blockquote>
<figure>
<img src="https://lock.cmpxchg8b.com/img/hiew/branchannot.png" alt=""><figcaption>Branch Annotations</figcaption>
</figure>
</blockquote>
</details>
<details>
<summary> While we’re browsing around we can enter comments with <kbd>;</kbd>, just like in data view. The only difference is that your comments get added to the disassembly, rather than as floating tooltips! </summary>
<blockquote>
<video controls="">
<source src="https://lock.cmpxchg8b.com/img/hiew/codecomment.webm" type="video/webm">
</video>
</blockquote>
</details>
<p>Here’s a neat feature, see these dashes?</p>
<blockquote>
<figure>
<img src="https://lock.cmpxchg8b.com/img/hiew/bookmarkstack.png" alt=""><figcaption>Bookmark Stack</figcaption>
</figure>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s your bookmark stack! If you want to go explore somewhere else, you can hit <kbd>+</kbd>, then you return later by hitting <kbd>-</kbd>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tip: Take a look at <a href="https://taviso.github.io/hiewdocs/index.htm?query=bookmark">hiewdocs</a> if you want to master the bookmark stack!</p>
</blockquote>
<details>
<summary> Hiew understands most major executable formats, and will populate names automatically. You can easily browse and patch headers, sections, tables, and so on.
<p>Let’s take a look at the imports table. </p></summary>
<blockquote>
<video controls="">
<source src="https://lock.cmpxchg8b.com/img/hiew/imports.webm" type="video/webm">
</video>
</blockquote>
</details>
<p>Look, there’s a call to <code>IsDebuggerPresent()</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<figure>
<img src="https://lock.cmpxchg8b.com/img/hiew/debugger.png" alt=""><figcaption>IsDebuggerPresent</figcaption>
</figure>
</blockquote>
<p>Let’s patch it out just for fun. Hiew not only has a dissasembler built in, it also has an <em>assembler</em>. I think this is a unique feature among major hex editors!</p>
<p>There’s a handy shortcut to just <code>nop</code> an instruction <kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>f2</kbd>.</p>
<blockquote>
<video controls="">
<source src="https://lock.cmpxchg8b.com/img/hiew/nopnop.webm" type="video/webm">
</video>
</blockquote>
<p>Now let’s change this nop into <code>xor eax, eax</code>, and we’re done!</p>
<p>I challenge you to find me a hex editor that makes patching executables easier than Hiew 😂</p>
</section>
<section id="scenario-3">
<h3>Scenario #3</h3>
<p>You’re trying to repair a damaged file.</p>
<hr>
<p>Want to see a picture of my pup 🐶? His name is Deputy Dexter!</p>
<pre><code>$ display dexter.png
display-im6.q16: improper image header `dexter.png' @ error/png.c/ReadPNGImage/4107.</code></pre>
<p>Huh, that didn’t work! Maybe we can fix this problem with Hiew.</p>
<blockquote>
<figure>
<img src="https://lock.cmpxchg8b.com/img/hiew/dexbroken.png" alt=""><figcaption>Broken Header</figcaption>
</figure>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay, this doesn’t look right, there’s an extra <code>0D</code> in the header.</p>
<p>I’d bet this was probably broken by someone trying to convert from UNIX to DOS line endings!<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> We need to go through the file and replace every occurrence of <code>0D 0A</code> with <code>0A</code>.</p>
<p>A repetitive task like this is a good opportunity for me to show you how keyboard macros work. All we need to do is fix one of these errors, then we can tell Hiew to repeat everything we just did.</p>
<p>So, hit <kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>.</kbd> to begin recording a macro. This recording symbol should appear.</p>
<blockquote>
<figure>
<img src="https://lock.cmpxchg8b.com/img/hiew/macroindicator.png" alt=""><figcaption>Macro Indicator</figcaption>
</figure>
</blockquote>
<details>
<summary> Now we need to search for the next occurrence of <code>0D 0A</code>, so <kbd>f7</kbd>, and enter <code>0D0A</code>.
<p>To delete a byte, you mark it then press <kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>f2</kbd>.</p>
<p>That’s it! Now hit <kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>.</kbd> to end the macro. </p></summary>
<blockquote>
<video controls="">
<source src="https://lock.cmpxchg8b.com/img/hiew/macrorecord.webm" type="video/webm">
</video>
</blockquote>
</details>
<p>To tell Hiew to repeat this for every occurrence in the file, open the macro manager with <kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>=</kbd>, and then make sure the <code>L</code> (loop) and <code>S</code> (<strong>s</strong>earch failure) flags are set. This just means that Hiew should repeat exection until a search failure occurs.</p>
<blockquote>
<figure>
<img src="https://lock.cmpxchg8b.com/img/hiew/macromanager.png" alt=""><figcaption>Macro Manager</figcaption>
</figure>
</blockquote>
<p>You can give it a name if you want to save it for future use, but we’re only going to use it once. So hit <kbd>enter</kbd> to run it!</p>
<blockquote>
<video controls="">
<source src="https://lock.cmpxchg8b.com/img/hiew/macroplay.webm" type="video/webm">
</video>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Tip: The default execution speed is 200ms, which is slow enough that you can watch it run. It’s kinda cool to watch, but you can turn it all the way down to 0ms if you like!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let’s check if that worked, can we see Dexter!</p>
<blockquote>
<figure>
<img src="https://lock.cmpxchg8b.com/img/hiew/dexter.png" alt=""><figcaption>Macro Manager</figcaption>
</figure>
</blockquote>
<p>There’s my little guy!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tip: You can abort a running macro with <kbd>esc</kbd>. For some reason it will say “aborted by hacker” lol?</p>
</blockquote>

						<section id="msg_1037197">I'm new in this forum. I am glad it was such a special forum on Audio. I am the writer of the lossless image codec called <a href="https://encode.su/threads/4025-HALIC-(High-Availability-Lossless-Image-Compression)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HALIC(High Availability Lossless Image Compression)</a>. It is a work that can offer a good compression ratio quite quickly. This time I would like to introduce my work called HALAC(High Availability Lossless Audio Compression).<p>In the past(2018-2019), I had been working on the lossless audio compression. However, I could not bring together the work I did. Now I have a little time and I think I developed a fast codec. I worked on 16 bit, 2 channel audio data (.wav). Higher bit and channel options can be added if necessary. As a result, the approach is the same.</p><p>HALAC, like the HALIC, focuses on a reasonable compression ratio and high processing speed. The compression rate for audio data is usually limited. So I wanted a solution that can work faster with a few percent concessions.</p><p>I used a quick estimation with ANS(FSE). I don't know if there are other codecs using ANS, but the majority uses "Rice Coding". However, in my tests, Rice Coding(my own implementation) is a bit behind in terms of speed(0.6x - 0.7x), but it gives better results as compression rate(1% - 2%). The loss of speed in the Rice Coding is due to the calculation of adaptive parameter. I am really happy with ANS right now because speed is more important to me. In addition, I do not think that I use ANS fully efficiently.</p><p>GPU or SIMD was not used. Also now in the single-thread version. In the next version, I can add the Multithread option. I couldn't compile the Linux version because my Linux machine collapsed. I tried to find the middle way by working with different music genres.<br>Below are the comparisons (from original wav, 16 bit, 2 channel, 44100 bps) with FLAC, ALAC and WAVPACK (Pazera_Free_Audio_Extractor ver. 2.11).</p><p><strong>Test Machine (2012):</strong> i7 3770k, 3.9 ghz, 16 gb ram, 256 gb ssd<br><strong>Encode Usage:</strong> halac_encode.exe input.wav out.halac<br><strong>Decode Usage: </strong>halac_decode.exe out.halac original.wav</p><p><img src="https://encode.su/attachment.php?attachmentid=10971&amp;d=1704053753" alt=""></p><p><img src="https://encode.su/attachment.php?attachmentid=10972&amp;d=1704053768" alt=""></p><p><img src="https://encode.su/attachment.php?attachmentid=10973&amp;d=1704053780" alt=""></p></section>

I ran some simple tests here and it seems to compress a tiny bit worse than FLAC 1.4.3 in mode -4 but clearly better than FLAC in mode -3.<br>But in compression speed it beats even FLAC mode -0 and TAK -p0. And seems to beat them all in decoding speed too.

After the installation of my Linux machine is completed, I add execuable files. It is not open source at the moment, but can be evaluated according to the situation in the future. Right now, it's very new and I have things to improve.<p>There are also different predictors I don't use. Some are good in high entropy and some low entropy. As I said, we are at the beginning yet.

This will not have much effect on speed. Because they work extremely fast. However, no one had made such a request in my previous studies. If this is necessary, I will add it in the next version, no problem. Thanks a lot...<p>In addition, dealing with Metadata is the next simple details. We usually do not compress them (a few kilobytes).

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://posixcafe.org/blogs/2024/01/01/0/">https://posixcafe.org/blogs/2024/01/01/0/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38838369">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>

<p>I recently found that MAME supports running the SGI Indy while looking for ways to test some modifications I was making to the mips code in 9front. After a fair bit of elbow grease cinap and I (but mostly cinap) were able to get the old 9front indy kernel booting and running within mame. I thought I might as well document how we set things up here. As a word of warning this will require some decent 9front infrastructure setup already and some familiarity with things like ndb, additionally this system is barely usable from a modern standard so its usefulness is limited.</p>
<h2>Baseline MAME Indy</h2>
<p>The mainline MAME only gives the Indy 16MB of ram, which is a little tight. Thanks to some clever folks on the irixnet forums I found a patch for bumping this limit to the theoretical maximum (256MB), you can grab a prepatched repo <a href="https://github.com/majiru/mame">here</a> or if you are using a system with nix flakes available you can use <code>nix run github:majiru/9front-in-a-box#mame</code>.</p>
<p>Next you'll need to grab the required firmware files, of which I used <a href="https://sgi.neocities.org/">this</a> guide to get going, some links may be dead but some google searching of the required file names should get you some archive.org files.</p>
<p>Next you'll need to configure networking, MAME is a bit unique here and expects a tap named <code>tap-mess-$UID-0</code>, additionally after running once you'll need to modify the <code>$MAMEROOT/cfg/indy_4610.cfg</code> to make the <code>edlc</code> device line like so:</p>
<p><code>&lt;device tag=":edlc" interface="0" mac="08:00:69:12:34:56" /&gt;</code></p>
<p>Then you'll also likely need to modify the network from the in-emulation menu in MAME, which can be found by booting up the emulator, hitting ScrlLk followed by Tab, then clicking network settings and arrowing over to TAP/TUN network. This should only need to be done once as it will change the <code>interface=</code> line for the <code>edlc</code> device, unfortunately this specific index seems to be OS specific (was 0 for me on linux, was 2 for cinap on Windows) so its a bit difficult to modify without the in-emulation menu. At this point you <em>should</em> have a working Indy with networking, I suggest perhaps booting in to IRIX (as documented in the neocities guide) and double checking if you get stuck further on.</p>
<p>(editor's note: a real tap-mess indeed)</p>
<h2>9front bits</h2>
<p>Now for the fun bits, lets setup our 9front grid for bootp'ing this device. Let's first build the userspace and kernel:</p>
<p><code>cd /sys/src/</code></p>
<p><code>objtype=mips mk install</code></p>
<p><code>cd /sys/src/9/sgi</code></p>
<p><code>mk install</code></p>
<p>Next we need to configure the network booting, first add a <code>/lib/ndb/local</code> line to the tune of:</p>
<p><code>ip=192.168.168.214 ether=080069123456 sys=indy dom=indy.genso fs=myfs auth=myauth bootf=/mips/9indy</code></p>
<p>Then assuming you have your <code>ip/tftpd</code> running and MAME setup correctly you can boot up the Indy, click the button for maintenance mode, enter the PROM shell, then type <code>BOOTP();</code> which should grab your kernel and boot right up.</p>
<h2>Profit?</h2>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>[programmers frantically pulling cables out of the wall]</p><p>AI: "Nuclear power. Double teachers' salaries. Build more houses. Distribute food more fairly. TRAINS—"</p></div>— qntmyrrh (@qntm) <a href="https://twitter.com/qntm/status/1728178227355763063?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 24, 2023</a></blockquote><p>I remember growing up with that same old adage of how you could be the next scientist to invent a cure for cancer, or a solution to climate change, or whatever. What they don’t tell you is that we already have solutions for a <strong>lot</strong> of problems, we just don’t use them. Sometimes this is because the solution is too expensive, but usually it’s because competing interests create a tragedy of the commons. Most problems in the modern age aren’t complicated engineering problems, they’re the same problem: coordination failure.</p><p>It was recently unveiled that basically every single UEFI SecureBoot implementation ever made <a href="https://binarly.io/posts/finding_logofail_the_dangers_of_image_parsing_during_system_boot/index.html">can be bypassed with a <em><strong>malicious image file</strong></em></a>. This means that any manufacturer that allows the user to customize the boot image is now vulnerable to a complete bypass of SecureBoot <em>and</em> Intel Boot Guard. Luckily, the fix for this is pretty simple: don’t make the logo customizable. But how did something this absurd happen in the first place?</p><blockquote>The results from our fuzzing and subsequent bug triaging unequivocally say that none of these image parsers were ever tested by IBVs or OEMs. We can confidently say this because we found crashes in almost every parser we tested. Moreover, the fuzzer was able to find the first crashes after running just for a few seconds and, even worse, certain parsers were crashing on valid images found on the Internet. — <a href="https://binarly.io/posts/finding_logofail_the_dangers_of_image_parsing_during_system_boot/index.html">binarly.io</a></blockquote><p>It’s pretty obvious what happened, actually. The image parsers were written with the assumption they’d only ever need to load an image file provided by the manufacturer. When this assumption was violated, all hell broke loose, because <a href="https://davidkcaudill.medium.com/maybe-getting-rid-of-your-qa-team-was-bad-actually-52c408bd048b">we don’t test software anymore</a>. None of this happened because engineering is hard. None of this happened because of some tricky, subtle bug. It happened because the people writing the image parsers made an incredibly stupid mistake and then didn’t bother testing it, because the software industry doesn’t bother with QA anymore. Thus, there was no <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_cheese_model">swiss cheese</a>. There was just one slice of cheese with a gaping hole in it, because it turns out that some manufacturers decided to let users customize their boot image, thinking it would be harmless, and that by itself was enough to wreak havoc.</p><p>Every layer of this problem is a different flavor of coordination failure. No one on the team who implemented this either thought that there might need to be a warning about untrusted images, or whoever did bring it up was ignored because it was supposed to be handled by another team. Except whoever was supposed to put in a warning about this either wasn’t told, or buried it inside a technical document nobody ever reads. The vendors who decided to implement user-customizable boot logos didn’t ask whether this would be a problem, or weren’t told about it.</p><p>And <em>nobody</em>, not a single layer in this clown train, <a href="https://davidkcaudill.medium.com/maybe-getting-rid-of-your-qa-team-was-bad-actually-52c408bd048b#5a65">implemented a proper QA or pentesting process</a> that could have caught this bug, because we just don’t bother testing anything anymore. Our economic incentives have somehow managed to incentivize building the worst possible piece of shit that still technically works. We know how to avoid this situation. We have decades of experience building in-depth QA processes that we are simply ignoring. <strong>We could fix this, we just don’t</strong>.</p><p>This is not exclusive to software, as this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Limpr1L8Pss">fantastic video about the popcorn button</a> explains. Our economic race to the bottom has been sabotaging almost every aspect of engineering in our society. To save a few cents per microwave, the cheap microwaves don’t include a humidity sensor and then lie about having a popcorn button when it can’t actually work properly, which leads to everyone saying “don’t use the popcorn button” and now nobody uses the popcorn buttons <em>even on microwaves that actually have a humidity sensor and a working popcorn button</em>. The cheapskates control the supply chain now. They have pissed in the proverbial pool, and if this sounds familiar, that’s because it’s a classic example of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons">Tragedy of the Commons</a>.</p><p>Except, that’s not an excuse. What’s truly absurd is that the tragedy of the commons <em>isn’t inevitable</em>. We <em>know</em> this because ancient human tribes managed to navigate responsible utilization of common resources <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons#Non-governmental_solution">all the time</a>. It has no historical basis whatsoever. The tragedy of the commons only happens when you have a total failure of collective action. It is the original symptom of societal enshittification.</p><blockquote>[...] many nomadic pastoralist societies of Africa and the Middle East in fact "balanced local stocking ratios against seasonal rangeland conditions in ways that were ecologically sound", reflecting a desire for lower risk rather than higher profit...</blockquote><p>We actually have a cure for blood cancer now, by the way. Like, <a href="https://www.pennmedicine.org/news/news-releases/2023/august/an-immunotherapy-strategy-against-all-blood-cancers">we’ve done it</a>. It’s likely that a similar form of immunotherapy will generalize to most forms of cancer. Unfortunately, the only approved gene therapy we have is for sickle-cell disease and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03590-6">costs $2 million per patient</a>, so most people in America simply assume they will never be able to afford any of these treatments, even if they were dying of cancer, because insurance will never cover it. This is actually really bad, because if nobody can afford the treatment, then biotech companies won’t bother investing into it, because it’s not profitable! We have built a society that <em>can’t properly incentivize</em> <em><strong>CURING CANCER</strong></em>. This is despite the fact that socialized healthcare is a proven effective strategy (as long as the government <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/nhs-crisis-covid-privatisation-funding-b2255741.html">doesn’t sabotage it</a>). <strong>We could fix this, we just don’t</strong>.</p><p>Some people try to complain that this happens because democracy is hard, or whatever, and they’re also wrong. <em>We know exactly what’s wrong with our current voting systems</em> and CGP Grey even put out a video on it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7tWHJfhiyo">13 fucking years ago</a>. It <em>inevitably</em> results in a two-party system, because strategic voting is rational behavior, and you can’t break out of this two-party system because of the spoiler effect, and the solution is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y3jE3B8HsE">Ranked Choice Voting</a> (or the Alternative Vote). If you want to go further and address gerrymandering you can use the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8XOZJkozfI">Single Transferable Vote</a>. All of these better systems were proposed decades ago. We have implemented exactly none of them for the presidential election (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranked-choice_voting_in_the_United_States">except for Maine and Alaska</a>). In fact, America still uses the electoral vote system, which is strictly worse than the popular vote, we all know it’s worse, and we even <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUX-frlNBJY">have a potential solution</a> but we still can’t get rid of it due to counterproductive societal interests.</p><p>We <em>HAVE</em> solutions for these problems. We just don’t use them. We <em>could</em> be running fiber-optic cable to every house in America, and we even know how much it would cost. We just don’t because we gave the money to corporations who then <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/6c5e97/comment/dhsxq6k/">used none of it and instead paid themselves huge bonuses</a>. We <em>know</em> that automation is chipping away at low-skill jobs, which means our workforce needs to be better educated, and that providing free college to everyone would be a good idea, we just don’t. We know how to build interstate high-speed commuter rail, we just don’t (although <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/12/08/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-billions-to-deliver-world-class-high-speed-rail-and-launch-new-passenger-rail-corridors-across-the-country/">Biden is trying</a>). <strong>We could fix everything, we just don’t</strong>.</p><p>We have no excuses anymore. None of these are novel or difficult problems, not even the tragedy of the commons. We can do better. We don’t need AI to fix things. We don’t need new technology to solve these problems. We <em>already know how to do better</em>. Our society is bad at cooperation simply because it’s run by people who are incentivized to sabotage cooperation in the name of profits. That’s it.</p><p>It’s January 1st of the new year, and with all these people wishing each other a “better year”, I am here to remind you that <strong>it will only get worse</strong> unless we <em>do something</em>. Society getting worse is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q118B_QdP2k">not something you are hallucinating</a>. It cannot be fixed by you biking to work, or winning the lottery. We are running on the fumes of our wild technological progress of the past 100 years, and our inability to build social systems that can cooperate will destroy civilization as we know it, unless we <strong>do something about it</strong>.</p><p>We live in what is perhaps the most critical turning point in all of human history, and we’re on a ship that has drifted far off course. The rapid current of technology means that we are swept along faster and faster, making it exponentially harder to steer away from the icebergs ahead of us. We <em><strong>must</strong></em> address our coordination failures. We <em><strong>must</strong></em> build systems that foster better cooperation, or this century won’t be a turning point for humanity, it will be the end of humanity.</p><blockquote>"All that would remain of us would be a thin layer in some future rock face. This is the future we must avoid at all costs." — <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o48X3_XQ9to&amp;t=725s">John D. Boswell (melodysheep)</a></blockquote></div></div>]]></description>

        <p>Every year, around March, a curious social custom occurs in Japanese families.</p><p>Parents of kids entering elementary school visit the grandparents and gingerly tread the topic of buying the kids a very expensive item: a <em>randoseru</em>.</p><p>And gingerly they must tread. The <em>randoseru</em>, a Japanese school bag, costs a whopping 60,000 yen ($450) on average.</p><p>It is customary for grandparents to pay for these expensive bags and they are usually more than happy to.</p><h2 id="history">History</h2><p>During the Meiji Reforms of the late 1800s, Japan aimed to modernize and demonstrate to the world that it was as advanced a country as any other.</p><p>One tiny part of these reforms was the introduction of the rucksack (<em>ransel</em> in Dutch) for soldiers to carry their baggage.</p><p>After a few rounds of bastardization, <em>ransel</em>&nbsp;became “randoseru” in Japanese.</p><p>Now, another part of the reforms was revamping the education system. Several modern schools were established to this end. Most of the initial students were children of the affluent and aristocrats, who could afford such luxuries (and would then go on to occupy top posts, but I digress).</p><p>Gakushuin was one such school in Tokyo.</p><p>Despite being a private school for the nobility, Gakushuin had a few slots for commoners. It also had very egalitarian principles.</p><p>The school recognized that education was the great leveler and that students from different walks of life would attend. They wanted all students feel equal in school.</p><p>Japanese students, for the longest time, took their books to school in a <em>furoshiki</em>. A <em>furoshiki</em> is a … versatile, rectangular piece of cloth. There simply wasn’t a concept of a school bag.</p><figure><img src="https://one-from-nippon.ghost.io/content/images/2024/01/5892619045_3c48cd0f03_k.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://one-from-nippon.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2024/01/5892619045_3c48cd0f03_k.jpg 600w, https://one-from-nippon.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2024/01/5892619045_3c48cd0f03_k.jpg 1000w, https://one-from-nippon.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1600/2024/01/5892619045_3c48cd0f03_k.jpg 1600w, https://one-from-nippon.ghost.io/content/images/2024/01/5892619045_3c48cd0f03_k.jpg 2048w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>Furoshiki&nbsp;– Simple but elegant. </span><i><em>Source: </em></i><a href="https://flic.kr/p/9YHdm6?ref=one-from-nippon.ghost.io" rel="noreferrer"><i><em>weekend knitter</em></i></a></figcaption></figure><p>The children of the affluent would carry their books in, lol, no they didn't carry shite. They had their servants carry their books to school.</p><p>Gakushuin did not like this one bit. They wanted students to learn responsibility and imposed two rules: 1) No commuting by car, rickshaw, or horse and 2) Students had to carry their own books and notebooks in a <em>randoseru</em>.</p><p>At this point, the <em>randoseru</em> still looked like your old-school military satchel. The first box-shaped <em>randoseru</em> was presented by Prime Minister Hirobumi Ito to the Crown Prince Taisho as a gift for entering elementary school. This is the shape that has endured to this day.</p><p>Despite the crown prince’s endorsement, the <em>randoseru</em> was too expensive for most. Since it was made of leather, only the wealthy could afford one. It was only when artificial leather was introduced in the 1950s, that <em>randoseru</em> became affordable for most of the population and popular.</p><h3 id="ran-katsu"><em>Ran</em>-<em>katsu</em></h3><p>Choosing a <em>randoseru</em> is no simple decision. It is a serious, time-consuming affair, involving three generations of the family. </p><p>Japanese even has a word for it: “<em>ran-katsu”</em> (ラン活): <em>ran-</em> for <em>randoseru</em> and <em>katsu</em> for 活動 (activity).&nbsp;</p><blockquote>Note: &lt;something something&gt;-<em>katsu</em> is a common Japanese thing. 就活 (‘shuu-katsu’) is the activity of looking for a job, 婚活 (kon-katsu) is trying to find a partner, 妊活 (‘nin-katsu’) is trying to conceive, and パパ活 (‘papa-katsu’) is … can you guess? Sugar daddying.</blockquote><p>Given how expensive it is, a <em>randoseru</em> is used throughout the six years of elementary school.</p><p>Parents and elementary school-goers-to-be first request paper catalogs from <em>randoseru</em> makers and visit <em>randoseru </em>exhibitions to find out what the next year's fashion is going to be.</p><p>They then visit multiple <em>randoseru</em> showrooms to find which colors and designs they like and which sizes fit well. They then place their orders (which are non-cancellable) and wait with bated breath for 6+ months as the bags are crafted. (There are also <em>randoseru</em> you can buy off the shelf but you don't get to customize these.)</p><p>The general advice is to start <em>ran-katsu</em> at least 18 months ahead of school.</p><figure><img src="https://one-from-nippon.ghost.io/content/images/2024/01/Schoolkids_wearing_hats_and_randoseru_in_Kugayama-_Japan-_January_2010.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="1200" srcset="https://one-from-nippon.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2024/01/Schoolkids_wearing_hats_and_randoseru_in_Kugayama-_Japan-_January_2010.jpg 600w, https://one-from-nippon.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2024/01/Schoolkids_wearing_hats_and_randoseru_in_Kugayama-_Japan-_January_2010.jpg 1000w, https://one-from-nippon.ghost.io/content/images/2024/01/Schoolkids_wearing_hats_and_randoseru_in_Kugayama-_Japan-_January_2010.jpg 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>Children carrying their </span><i><em>randoseru</em></i><span> to school in Tokyo </span><i><em>Source: </em></i><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Schoolkids_wearing_hats_and_randoseru_in_Kugayama,_Japan;_January_2010.jpg?ref=one-from-nippon.ghost.io" rel="noreferrer"><i><em>Wikimedia</em></i></a></figcaption></figure><h3 id="but-why-is-it-so-expensive">But why is it so expensive?</h3><p>It’s valid to ask “What’s in a kid’s school bag for it to cost $400?!<em>”</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>In answering this question I realized just how much of our worldview is informed by everything we touch being mass produced. When we think of things like school bags, we imagine large machines in some factory in China spitting out pieces by the hundreds.</p><p>The <em>randoseru</em> is a little different.</p><p>A <em>randoseru</em> can have up to 200 die cut parts and polyurethane back plates, and are mostly assembled by hand, making it an expensive item to produce.</p><p>Every part is built and assembled with the utmost focus on quality and durability. After all, the bag needs to last throughout the six years of school, through rough and tumble, in the rain, in the humid summer, and in the snow. Take a look at how one of these manufacturers crafts one ↓</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lSochjb6ovI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" title="Tsuchiya Kaban | How we make Randoseru in our Japan studio"></iframe></figure><h3 id="the-user-the-buyer-and-the-sponsor">The User, the Buyer, and the Sponsor</h3><p>In a brilliant exposition of the difference between the user, the buyer, and the sponsor, the <em>randoseru</em> is used by the grandchildren, bought by the parents, and paid for by the grandparents.&nbsp;</p><p>A recent survey uncovered that about 60% of <em>randoseru</em> purchases in 2022 were paid for by grandparents.</p><p>This brings interesting challenges. Grandparents, who went to school many decades ago, have their own ideas on what to buy. In their days, there existed only two types of <em>randoseru</em> (red for girls and black for boys) and customization was limited.</p><p>This sometimes creates friction between the generations, with kids not liking what their grandparents want for them.</p><p>Watch this video from a <em>randoseru</em> manufacturer encouraging children to choose what <em>they</em> want. The kids are first asked to choose what they think their parents would like them to buy. They are then asked to choose what <em>they</em> want to buy. The difference is telling.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r1Bic3Go2dY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" title="【セイバン公式】ランドセル選びドキュメンタリー篇"></iframe><figcaption><p><span>(Tip: Turn on Auto-translate inside ⚙️ for subtitles)</span></p></figcaption></figure><h3 id="but-is-a-randoseru-really-necessary">But is a <em>randoseru</em> really necessary?</h3><p>Curiously, there is <em>absolutely</em> no law, regulation, or rule that requires students to use a <em>randoseru</em>. It is one of those decades-old Japanese traditions has become the <em>de facto</em> choice.</p><p>No choice in life is devoid of downsides and there are a few with <em>randoseru</em> too.</p><p>Doctors are identifying a new class of problems as “<em>randoseru</em> symptoms”: a set of physical and mental issues caused by heavy and badly fitting <em>randoseru</em>.</p><p>In a survey by the Japanese Ministry of Education, today’s average <em>randoseru, </em>when fully loaded, weighs in at 6 kilograms (13.2 lbs.). That is a lot for a child to carry, especially since many children walk to school in Japan.</p><p>The priciness of <em>randoseru</em> also has many questioning the value. Why invest hundreds of dollars in a bag that is heavy and locks your child into a choice for six years? Worse, the cost of the <em>randoseru</em> also brings problems that it was originally meant to solve: it creates divisions between the richer and poorer children, paving the way for other issues.</p><p>A handful of Japanese towns have moved to cheaper, lighter alternatives. Some schools in Shimane prefecture have moved to city-provided lightweight nylon backpacks called <em>ran-bag</em>s (yeah, don’t ask me how they name things in Japan). Unlike the <em>randoseru</em>, these cost a much more affordable 8,000 yen (57 USD), are lighter, and just as durable.</p><h3 id="the-future">The Future?</h3><p>I don’t expect that the <em>randoseru</em> will completely disappear, but look forward to how it evolves as more schoolwork moves to digital devices. Perhaps there will come a day when children simply walk empty-handed to school. </p><p>But seeing how Japan is doing with eliminating fax machines I am not holding my breath…</p>
