<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post"><article><p>06/26/2024</p><section><p>6 min read</p><div><figure><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2024/06/image2-12.png" alt="Cloudflare incident on June 20, 2024" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="900"></figure><p>polyfill.io, a popular JavaScript library service, can no longer be trusted and should be removed from websites.</p><p><a href="https://sansec.io/research/polyfill-supply-chain-attack">Multiple reports</a>, corroborated with data seen by our own client-side security system, <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/page-shield/">Page Shield</a>, have shown that the polyfill service was being used, and could be used again, to inject malicious JavaScript code into users’ browsers. This is a real threat to the Internet at large given the popularity of this library.</p><p>We have, over the last 24 hours, released an automatic JavaScript URL rewriting service that will rewrite any link to polyfill.io found in a website proxied by Cloudflare <a href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/polyfill/">to a link to our mirror under cdnjs</a>. This will avoid breaking site functionality while mitigating the risk of a supply chain attack.</p><p>Any website on the free plan has this feature automatically activated now. Websites on any paid plan can turn on this feature with a single click.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2024/06/image1-22.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1548" height="322"></figure><p>You can find this new feature under <a href="https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/security/settings">Security ⇒ Settings</a> on any zone using Cloudflare.</p><p>Contrary to what is stated on the polyfill.io website, Cloudflare has never recommended the polyfill.io service or authorized their use of Cloudflare’s name on their website. We have asked them to remove the false statement and they have, so far, ignored our requests. This is yet another warning sign that they cannot be trusted.</p><p>If you are not using Cloudflare today, we still highly recommend that you remove any use of polyfill.io and/or find an alternative solution. And, while the automatic replacement function will handle most cases, the best practice is to remove polyfill.io from your projects and replace it with a secure alternative mirror like Cloudflare’s even if you are a customer.</p><p>You can do this by searching your code repositories for instances of polyfill.io and replacing it with <a href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/polyfill/">cdnjs.cloudflare.com/polyfill/</a> (Cloudflare’s mirror). This is a non-breaking change as the two URLs will serve the same polyfill content. All website owners, regardless of the website using Cloudflare, should do this now.</p><h2 id="how-we-came-to-this-decision">How we came to this decision</h2><p>Back in February, the domain polyfill.io, which hosts a popular JavaScript library, was sold to a new owner: Funnull, a relatively unknown company. <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/polyfill-io-now-available-on-cdnjs-reduce-your-supply-chain-risk">At the time, we were concerned</a> that this created a supply chain risk. This led us to spin up our own mirror of the polyfill.io code hosted under cdnjs, a JavaScript library repository sponsored by Cloudflare.</p><p>The new owner was unknown in the industry and did not have a track record of trust to administer a project such as polyfill.io. The concern, <a href="https://x.com/triblondon/status/1761852117579427975">highlighted even by the original author</a>, was that if they were to abuse polyfill.io by injecting additional code to the library, it could cause far reaching security problems on the Internet affecting several hundreds of thousands websites. Or it could be used to perform a targeted supply-chain attack against specific websites.</p><p>Unfortunately, that worry came true on June 25, 2024 as the polyfill.io service was being used to inject nefarious code that, under certain circumstances, redirected users to other websites.</p><p>We have taken the exceptional step of using our ability to modify HTML on the fly to replace references to the polyfill.io CDN in our customers’ websites with links to our own, safe, mirror created back in February.</p><p>In the meantime, additional threat feed providers have also taken the decision to <a href="https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uAssets/commit/91dfc54aed0f0aa514c1a481c3e63ea16da94c03">flag the domain as malicious</a>. We have not outright blocked the domain through any of the mechanisms we have because we are concerned it could cause widespread web outages given how broadly polyfill.io is used with some estimates indicating <a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/js-polyfillio">usage on nearly 4% of all websites</a>.</p><h3 id="corroborating-data-with-page-shield">Corroborating data with Page Shield</h3><p>The original report indicates that malicious code was injected that, under certain circumstances, would redirect users to betting sites. It was doing this by loading additional JavaScript that would perform the redirect, under a set of additional domains which can be considered Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):</p><pre><code>https://www.googie-anaiytics.com/analytics.js

When turned on, it collects information about JavaScript files loaded by end user browsers accessing your website.</p><p>By looking at the database of detected JavaScript files, we immediately found matches with the IoCs provided above starting as far back as 2024-06-08 15:23:51 (first seen timestamp on Page Shield detected JavaScript file). This was a clear indication that malicious activity was active and associated with polyfill.io.</p><h3 id="replacing-insecure-javascript-links-to-polyfillio">Replacing insecure JavaScript links to polyfill.io</h3><p>To achieve performant HTML rewriting, we need to make blazing-fast HTML alterations as responses stream through Cloudflare’s network. This has been made possible by leveraging <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/rust-nginx-module">ROFL (Response Overseer for FL)</a>. ROFL powers various Cloudflare products that need to alter HTML as it streams, such as <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/speed/optimization/content/fonts/">Cloudflare Fonts,</a> <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/tools/scrape-shield/email-address-obfuscation/">Email Obfuscation</a> and <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/speed/optimization/content/rocket-loader/">Rocket Loader</a></p><p>ROFL is developed entirely in Rust. The memory-safety features of Rust are indispensable for ensuring protection against memory leaks while processing a staggering volume of requests, measuring in the millions per second. Rust's compiled nature allows us to finely optimize our code for specific hardware configurations, delivering performance gains compared to interpreted languages.</p><p>The performance of ROFL allows us to rewrite HTML on-the-fly and modify the polyfill.io links quickly, safely, and efficiently. This speed helps us reduce any additional latency added by processing the HTML file.</p><p>If the feature is turned on, for any HTTP response with an HTML Content-Type, we parse all JavaScript script tag source attributes. If any are found linking to polyfill.io, we rewrite the src attribute to link to our mirror instead. We map to the correct version of the polyfill service while the query string is left untouched.</p><p>The logic will not activate if a Content Security Policy (CSP) header is found in the response. This ensures we don’t replace the link while breaking the CSP policy and therefore potentially breaking the website.</p><h3 id="default-on-for-free-customers-optional-for-everyone-else">Default on for free customers, optional for everyone else</h3><p>Cloudflare proxies millions of websites, and a large portion of these sites are on our free plan. Free plan customers tend to have simpler applications while not having the resources to update and react quickly to security concerns. We therefore decided to turn on the feature by default for sites on our free plan, as the likelihood of causing issues is reduced while also helping keep safe a very large portion of applications using polyfill.io.</p><p>Paid plan customers, on the other hand, have more complex applications and react quicker to security notices. We are confident that most paid customers using polyfill.io and Cloudflare will appreciate the ability to virtually patch the issue with a single click, while controlling when to do so.</p><p>All customers can turn off the feature at any time.</p><p>This isn’t the first time we’ve decided a security problem was so widespread and serious that we’d enable protection for all customers regardless of whether they were a paying customer or not. Back in 2014, we enabled <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/shellshock-protection-enabled-for-all-customers">Shellshock protection</a> for everyone. In 2021, when the log4j vulnerability was disclosed <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cve-2021-44228-log4j-rce-0-day-mitigation/">we rolled out protection</a> for all customers.</p><h2 id="do-not-use-polyfillio">Do not use polyfill.io</h2><p>If you are using Cloudflare, you can remove polyfill.io with a single click on the Cloudflare dashboard by heading over to <a href="https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/security/settings">your zone ⇒ Security ⇒ Settings</a>. If you are a free customer, the rewrite is automatically active. This feature, we hope, will help you quickly patch the issue.</p><p>Nonetheless, you should ultimately search your code repositories for instances of polyfill.io and replace them with an alternative provider, such as Cloudflare’s secure mirror under cdnjs (<a href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/polyfill/">https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/polyfill/</a>).

<h2>Detailed Description of the keyboad PCB</h2>
<p>
<b>The LCD</b> is driven in 4-bit mode to save I/O pins on the My4TH I/O connector. There are only 5 unused
digital outputs available on My4TH's I/O connector, but this is two less than needed to drive the large LCD,
which has two chip select inputs. So it was necessary to add some sort of I/O-port expander to get more digital outputs. 
I did this by adding a 74HC574 octal D-type bus latch. This IC is wired as a 4-bit wide shift register with a depth of 2,
so we get another 8 digital outputs. To clock the data into the shift register, I use the SCL line of the I2C bus.
This is no problem at all for the I2C bus, because the devices on the bus will never see a valid I2C start condition 
when the SCL signal is used to clock the 74HC574. To avoid unwanted register writes to the LCD, the display
has its on select-signal on My4TH's digital I/O port (OUT3). Two resistor-diode AND gates
(R3/D6 and R4/D8) mask the chip selects on the LCD. The small capacitors C2 and C3 are required to filter out glitches
caused by the 74HC574's toggling pins together with the parasitic capacitance of D6 and D8.</p>
<p>
<b>The keyboard</b> has 56 keys. The distance between the keys is 12 mm, so it is not possible to use larger, more confortable keys.
I wanted to have the smallest possible device, and the display forced me to use a minimum width of 190 mm. With a spacing
of 12 mm, 14 keys fit in one row, and with 4 rows we get a total of 56 keys. To read the keys, I use all the unused input pins on
the My4TH's I/O-port connector, which are six in total. Together with 9 digital outputs, I can read a matrix of 6 x 9 = 54 keys.
The remaining two keys are special: I added a shift key (which required another digital output) and a reset key.
The reset key is protected by the shift key, i.e. to trigger a hardware reset you need to press the the reset key together
with the shift key.</p>
<p>
<b>A LiPo battery</b> is used to power the system. The charger circuit is based on the TP5400 chip, which is widely used
in cheap USB power banks. If you find it too difficult to solder the tiny SMD components onto the circuit board,
you can use a pre-assembled TP5400 module and connect it to the keyboard PCB via fly wires.</p>
<p>
<b>The Software support</b> for the keyboard PCB is integrated in the My4TH ROM since version 1.0. So if you connect the
keyboard extension board to your My4TH computer board, your My4TH will automatically detect the keyboard and LCD.</p>
<p>
<b>The PCB</b> is prepared so that it can be cut in half to separate the keyboard from the display. This allows you
to a) mount the display at any angle to the keyboard and b) make your own (possibly more comfortable) keyboard.</p>
<p>
To initiate a <b>hardware reset</b>, hold down the shift key and press the |Reset| key.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/introducing-figma-ai/">https://www.figma.com/blog/introducing-figma-ai/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40802423">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>We’re introducing a suite of AI-powered features to help you push past creative blocks and bring your best ideas to life.</p><div colorscheme="[object Object]"><p>Since we first brought <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/introducing-ai-to-figjam/">AI features into FigJam</a>, we’ve been thinking about how to harness the power of AI in Figma. As with everything we do at Figma, our main goal is to give you the tools you need to do your best work—to look beyond the hype and find real solutions to real user problems. Through that lens, we’re excited to introduce Figma AI, a collection of features designed to help you work more efficiently and creatively. Whether you’re searching for inspiration, exploring multiple directions, or looking to automate tedious tasks, we’re building Figma AI to unblock you at&nbsp;any&nbsp;stage.</p><div><p>Our AI features will be free for all users during the beta period, which runs through 2024. As we learn how these tools are used and their underlying costs for Figma, we may need to introduce usage limits for the beta. When Figma AI becomes generally available, we’ll provide clear guidance on pricing. Our goal is to help you work more efficiently while also improving these features in a scalable way.</p></div><h2 id="find-exactly-what-you-need-with-enhanced-search"><a href="#find-exactly-what-you-need-with-enhanced-search">Find exactly what you need with enhanced search</a></h2><p>We know that product designers aren’t always starting from scratch. Many Figma users leverage a production screenshot or try to work with components the team has already created. But locating a specific design or component can feel like searching for a needle in a haystack—especially when working across large organizations with complex design systems. We’re introducing two new ways to help you find the jumping off point that you’re looking for: <strong>Visual Search</strong> and an AI-enhanced <strong>Asset Search</strong>.</p><p><strong>Visual Search</strong> lets you find and reuse designs by uploading an image, selecting an area on your canvas, or entering a text query. Figma will instantly surface visually similar designs from across all your team’s files that you have access to. You can then insert the most relevant frames directly into your working file. In the future, this search capability will extend across our community files, making it easier to find and discover great resources from the&nbsp;community.</p><div><figure><div><p><img src="data:image/png;base64,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" alt="Recipe cards behind a search icon and helper text which reads &quot;Visual search&quot;" width="528" height="422" data-lqip="true"><img data-loading="true" width="528" height="422" loading="lazy" alt="Recipe cards behind a search icon and helper text which reads &quot;Visual search&quot;" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/regionalized/689c1278682ae1b00b39a54e8ae143c7ff819ac8-1080x864.png?rect=0,1,1080,863&amp;w=528&amp;h=422&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/regionalized/689c1278682ae1b00b39a54e8ae143c7ff819ac8-1080x864.png?w=528&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 264w, https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/regionalized/689c1278682ae1b00b39a54e8ae143c7ff819ac8-1080x864.png?w=528&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 396w, https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/regionalized/689c1278682ae1b00b39a54e8ae143c7ff819ac8-1080x864.png?w=528&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format 528w, https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/regionalized/689c1278682ae1b00b39a54e8ae143c7ff819ac8-1080x864.png?w=528&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 792w, https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/regionalized/689c1278682ae1b00b39a54e8ae143c7ff819ac8-1080x864.png?w=528&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1056w"></p></div><figcaption>Instantly find the exact design you need (or uncover new inspiration) by uploading an image and letting Visual Search work its magic.</figcaption></figure></div><div><p>In the future, you’ll be able to also search files and assets from the Figma community directly within the editor.

For example, searching for “primary button” should surface relevant button components, even if they’re named something like “btn_large” in your design system.

Our goal is to solve real pain points and unblock your creativity with tools dialed into your workflow and enhanced&nbsp;by&nbsp;AI.</p><h3 id="our-approach-to-training"><a href="#our-approach-to-training">Our approach to&nbsp;training</a></h3><p>All of the generative features we’re launching today are powered by third-party, out-of-the-box AI models and were not trained on private Figma files or customer data. We fine-tuned Visual and Asset Search with images of user interfaces from public, free Community files.</p><p>While we’re proud of the AI features we’ve built so far, we see ways to accelerate your work further by developing new models that work more efficiently and effectively with Figma-specific concepts and tools. To make these improvements, we need to train models that better understand design concepts and patterns, and Figma’s internal formats and structure through Figma&nbsp;content.</p><p>Two important highlights: First, all admins <strong>have control </strong>of whether their team’s content data is used for training. Second, participation in AI content training is not required to use Figma or Figma’s AI features. <a href="https://www.figma.com/ai/our-approach/">Learn more about our approach to&nbsp;training</a>.</p><p>To make these features more useful, the models we use need to be tuned to the specific ways that designers and product teams work in Figma. We’re committed to building this in a principled way that protects your&nbsp;privacy.</p><h3 id="data-privacy-and-protection"><a href="#data-privacy-and-protection">Data privacy and protection</a></h3><p>We know how important your data is to you, your company, and your clients. Our model development process is designed to protect your privacy and confidential information.</p><p>For all customer data,&nbsp;we:</p><ul><li>Encrypt all data at rest and&nbsp;in&nbsp;transit</li><li>Use security measures designed to protect against unauthorized access to customer&nbsp;data</li><li>Enforce tailored permissions and user access controls around who can view and access your&nbsp;data</li></ul><p>We take additional steps to train our models so that they learn general design patterns and Figma-specific concepts and tools—not your content, concepts, and ideas. For example, we de-identify content and redact sensitive information including from text and&nbsp;images.</p><h3 id="ai-model-training"><a href="#ai-model-training">AI model training</a></h3><p>We are introducing a team-level setting where admins can control customer content sharing with Figma for AI training. Customer content includes file content created in or uploaded to Figma by a user, such as layer names and properties, text and images, comments, and annotations. Sharing your customer content with Figma for AI training is <strong>optional</strong> and your team’s setting preference will go into effect on <strong>August 15, 2024</strong>. If an admin turns off content training after that, new content and edits will not be used to train AI&nbsp;models.</p><p>Starting today, admins can set that content data training preference directly in settings, across all&nbsp;plans.</p><ul><li>Starter and Professional plans are opted in by default, but can&nbsp;opt&nbsp;out.</li><li>Organization and Enterprise plans are opted out&nbsp;by&nbsp;default.</li></ul><p>Our customer agreements with Organization and Enterprise are typically more complex and include specific requirements and restrictions, which is why we’ve chosen a different default setting for those&nbsp;plans.</p><p>No content training will occur until August 15, so you have time to decide. Also, any content generated by Figma AI is considered customer content data. You keep your rights to outputs generated when you use&nbsp;Figma&nbsp;AI.</p><p><em>Usage data</em></p><p>Usage data is distinct from customer content and relates to how Figma is accessed and used. Examples of usage data include technical logs, metadata, telemetry data, and information about how your organization’s content is used (like how many times it is accessed), but usage data does not include your content itself. This data is used in an aggregated, de-identified way to help protect your&nbsp;privacy.</p><p><em>Community files data</em></p><p>Free files in the Figma Community are available under licenses that allow transformation but require attribution. What constitutes attribution in the field of AI is a widely debated topic. Until we decide and transparently communicate our approach, generative models that output design will not be trained on Community files. So far, we’ve used public, free Community files only to improve search use cases, like the new semantic and visual search improvements. We will not be doing any training on paid Community files.</p><h3 id="looking-ahead"><a href="#looking-ahead">Looking ahead</a></h3><p>Our goal is to build AI in service of designers and product teams, while being responsible and clear in our approach. As we combine the power of AI with the wisdom of our creative community, we see a future where AI becomes a true creative partner.</p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="93" height="13" fill="none"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="currentColor"></circle><path fill="currentColor" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0 93 13H80z"></path></svg><p><em>Learn more about our <a href="https://www.figma.com/ai/">AI feature availability</a> and review <a href="https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/17725942479127-Access-or-opt-out-of-AI-features" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">how to opt in or out&nbsp;of&nbsp;training</a>.</em></p><p><em>Our new AI terms and policies take effect on August 15, 2025 and we will send Starter and Pro users an email with the updated <a href="https://www.figma.com/legal/tos/">Terms of Service</a> and <a href="https://www.figma.com/legal/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a>.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main"><article><div><p>Anthropic's mission is to build reliable, interpretable, steerable AI systems. We have been excited to see our technology used in areas like coding, customer service, drug discovery, and medical research. We're eager to make these tools available through expanded offerings to government users. Leveraging the flexibility and security of Amazon Web Services [AWS], our AI models Claude 3 Haiku and Claude 3 Sonnet are now available in the AWS Marketplace for the US Intelligence Community [IC] and in AWS GovCloud.</p><p>Claude offers a wide range of potential applications for government agencies, both in the present and looking toward the future. Government agencies can use Claude to provide improved citizen services, streamline document review and preparation, enhance policymaking with data-driven insights, and create realistic training scenarios. In the near future, AI could assist in disaster response coordination, enhance public health initiatives, or optimize energy grids for sustainability. Used responsibly, AI has the potential to transform how elected governments serve their constituents and promote peace and security.</p><h3>Adapting to government needs</h3><p>We have been carefully considering the needs of public servants about how Claude could be used to further their missions and the unique needs of government users. In addition to making our models available in the AWS marketplaces that meet stringent government security standards, we are also adapting our service agreements to the unique needs, missions, and legal authorities of governments. </p><p>For example, we have crafted a set of <a href="https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/9528712-exceptions-to-our-usage-policy">contractual exceptions</a> to our general <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/legal/aup">Usage Policy</a> that are carefully calibrated to enable beneficial uses by carefully selected government agencies. These allow Claude to be used for legally authorized foreign intelligence analysis, such as combating human trafficking, identifying covert influence or sabotage campaigns, and providing warning in advance of potential military activities, opening a window for diplomacy to prevent or deter them. All other restrictions in our general <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/legal/aup">Usage Policy</a>, including those concerning disinformation campaigns, the design or use of weapons, censorship, and malicious cyber operations, remain.</p><p>At present, this policy applies only to models that are at AI Safety Level 2 (ASL-2) under our<a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropics-responsible-scaling-policy"> Responsible Scaling Policy</a> (RSP). As we move forward, we commit to regularly evaluating our partnerships and their impacts. Our goal remains constant: ensuring that AI serves the public interest while maintaining our empirical approach to mitigating potential risks.</p><h3>Commitment to responsible AI deployment</h3><p>Since our founding, we have been committed to working to support effective government policies about AI. We have stressed the importance of working with governments to develop <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/third-party-testing">effective testing and measurement regimes</a> and recently provided <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-5-sonnet">pre-release access</a> of Claude 3.5 Sonnet to the UK Artificial Intelligence Safety Institute (UK AISI), which conducted pre deployment testing and shared their results with US AI Safety Institute (US AISI). We believe working with governments is essential to ensuring the world safely makes the transition toward transformative AI and are committed to working toward this goal.</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-element="story-body" data-dateline="" data-subscriber-content="">  <p><span>WASHINGTON&nbsp;—&nbsp;</span></p><p>The Supreme Court on Wednesday struck down part of a federal anti-corruption law that makes it a crime for state and local officials to take gifts valued at more than $5,000 from a donor who had previously been awarded lucrative contracts or other government benefits thanks to the efforts of the official.</p><p>By a 6-3 vote, the justices<a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-108_8n5a.pdf" target="_blank"> overturned the conviction of a former Indiana mayor </a>who asked for and took a $13,000 payment from the owners of a local truck dealership after he helped them win $1.1 million in city contracts for the purchase of garbage trucks. </p><p>In ruling for the former mayor, the justices drew a distinction between bribery, which requires proof of an illegal deal, and a gratuity that can be a gift or a reward for a past favor. They said the officials may be charged and prosecuted for bribery, but not for taking money for past favors if there was no proof of an illicit deal. </p><p>“The question in this case is whether [the federal law] also makes it a crime for state and local officials to accept gratuities — for example, gift cards, lunches, plaques, books, framed photos or the like — that may be given as a token of appreciation after the official act. The answer is no,” said Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, writing for the majority.</p><p>Despite his reference to token gifts such as lunches and framed photos, the federal law was triggered only by payments of more than $5,000.</p><p>But the court’s conservative majority said the law in question was a “bribery statute, not a gratuities law.” Kavanaugh said federal law “leaves it to state and local governments to regulate gratuities to state and local officials.”</p><p>Justices Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented. </p><p>“Officials who use their public positions for private gain threaten the integrity of our most important institutions,” Jackson wrote in dissent. </p><p>She said the mayor’s “absurd and atextual reading of the statute is one only today’s court could love.”</p><p>The law as written “poses no genuine threat to common gift giving,” she said, but it “clearly covers the kind of corrupt (albeit perhaps non-quid pro quo) payment [the mayor] solicited after steering the city contracts to the dealership.”</p><p>The ruling could have a broad impact. About 20 million local and state officials are covered by the federal anti-corruption law, including officials at hospitals and universities that receive federal funds.</p><p>Justice Department lawyers told the court that for nearly 40 years, the anti-bribery law has been understood to prohibit payments to officials that “rewarded” them for having steered contracts to the donors. But there are few prosecutions that rely entirely on an after-the-fact payment, they said. </p><p>The Supreme Court justices have faced heavy criticism recently for accepting undisclosed gifts from wealthy patrons. Justice Clarence Thomas regularly took lavish vacations and private jet flights that were paid for by Texas billionaire Harlan Crow. Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. took a fishing trip to Alaska in 2008 aboard a private plane owned by Paul Singer, a hedge fund billionaire. </p><p>The high court has long held that criminal laws restricting “illegal gratuities” to federal officials require proof that the gifts were given for a specific “official act,” not just because of the official’s position. </p><p>The Indiana mayor was charged and convicted of taking the $13,000 payment because of his role in helping his patrons win city contracts. </p><p>Congress in 1986 extended the federal bribery law to cover officials of state or local agencies that receive federal funds. The measure made it a crime to “corruptly solicit or demand ... or accept ... anything of value of $5,000 or more ... intending to be influenced or rewarded in connection with any business or transaction.” </p><p>Prosecutors said James Snyder was heavily in debt and behind in paying his taxes when he became mayor of Portage, Ind., in 2012. The city needed new garbage trucks, and the mayor took over the required public bidding. He spoke regularly with two brothers who owned a local truck dealership that also had financial problems, and he designed the bidding process so that only their two new trucks would meet all of its standards. He also arranged to have the city buy an older truck that was on their lot.</p><p>Two weeks after the contracts were final, the mayor went to see the two brothers and told them of his financial troubles. They agreed to write him a check for $13,000 for undefined consulting services. </p><p>An FBI investigation led to Snyder’s indictment, his conviction and a 21-month prison sentence. </p><p>The former mayor argued that an after-the-fact gift should not be a crime, but he lost before a federal judge and the U.S. appeals court in Chicago.</p><p>The high court agreed to hear<a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/snyder-v-united-states/" target="_blank"> his appeal in Snyder vs. U.S.</a> because appeals courts in Boston and New Orleans had limited the law to bribery only and not gratuities that were paid later. </p><p>In recent years, the Supreme Court has repeatedly limited the scope of public corruption laws and often in unanimous rulings. The common theme is that the justices concluded the prosecutions went beyond the law. </p><p>Last year, the court was unanimous in overturning the corruption convictions of two New York men who were former aides or donors to then-Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat. The court noted that one of the defendants convicted of taking illicit payments did not work for the state during that time.</p><p>Four years ago, the justices were unanimous in overturning the convictions of two aides to then-New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican, who were charged with conspiring to shut down lanes to the George Washington Bridge into New York City. The court said they were wrongly convicted of fraud because they had not sought money or property, which is a key element of a fraud charge.</p><p>In 2016, the court overturned the corruption conviction of former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell, a Republican. While the governor took $175,000 in gifts from a business promoter, he took no official actions to benefit the donor, the court said. </p><div data-list-id="0000018c-4558-d70f-adfc-c77d3e520002" data-module-id="0000018c-4558-d70f-adfc-c77d3e520002" data-click="enhancement" data-align-center="">  <p data-element="element-header" data-click="liZZListTitleCTA">  <h3 data-element="element-header-title" data-counter="3">More to Read </h3>  </p>      </div> </div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  <p>I sometimes think of my computer as a very large house. I visit this house
every day and know most of the rooms on the ground floor, but there are
bedrooms I’ve never been in, closets I haven’t opened, nooks and crannies that
I’ve never explored. I feel compelled to learn more about my computer the same
way anyone would feel compelled to see a room they had never visited in their
own home.</p>

<p>GNU Readline is an unassuming little software library that I relied on for
years without realizing that it was there. Tens of thousands of people probably
use it every day without thinking about it. If you use the Bash shell, every
time you auto-complete a filename, or move the cursor around within a single
line of input text, or search through the history of your previous commands,
you are using GNU Readline. When you do those same things while using the
command-line interface to Postgres (<code>psql</code>), say, or the Ruby REPL
(<code>irb</code>), you are again using GNU Readline. Lots of software depends on the GNU
Readline library to implement functionality that users expect, but the
functionality is so auxiliary and unobtrusive that I imagine few people stop to
wonder where it comes from.
<!--more--></p>

<p>GNU Readline was originally created in the 1980s by the Free Software
Foundation. Today, it is an important if invisible part of everyone’s computing
infrastructure, maintained by a single volunteer.</p>

<h2 id="feature-replete">Feature Replete</h2>
<p>The GNU Readline library exists primarily to augment any command-line interface
with a common set of keystrokes that allow you to move around within and edit a
single line of input. If you press <code>Ctrl-A</code> at a Bash prompt, for example, that
will jump your cursor to the very beginning of the line, while pressing
<code>Ctrl-E</code> will jump it to the end. Another useful command is <code>Ctrl-U</code>, which
will delete everything in the line before the cursor.</p>

<p>For an embarrassingly long time, I moved around on the command line by
repeatedly tapping arrow keys. For some reason, I never imagined that there was
a faster way to do it. Of course, no programmer familiar with a text editor
like Vim or Emacs would deign to punch arrow keys for long, so something like
Readline was bound to be created. Using Readline, you can do much more than
just jump around—you can edit your single line of text as if you were using a
text editor. There are commands to delete words, transpose words, upcase words,
copy and paste characters, etc. In fact, most of Readline’s
keystrokes/shortcuts are based on Emacs. Readline is essentially Emacs for a
single line of text. You can even record and replay macros.</p>

<p>I have never used Emacs, so I find it hard to remember what all the
different Readline commands are. But one thing about Readline that is really
neat is that you can switch to using a Vim-based mode instead. To do this for
Bash, you can use the <code>set</code> builtin. The following will tell Readline
to use Vim-style commands for the current shell:</p>



<p>With this option enabled, you can delete words using <code>dw</code> and so on. The
equivalent to <code>Ctrl-U</code> in the Emacs mode would be <code>d0</code>.</p>

<p>I was excited to try this when I first learned about it, but I’ve found that it
doesn’t work so well for me. I’m happy that this concession to Vim users
exists, and you might have more luck with it than me, particularly if you
haven’t already used Readline’s default command keystrokes. My problem is that,
by the time I heard about the Vim-based interface, I had already learned
several Readline keystrokes. Even with the Vim option enabled, I keep using the
default keystrokes by mistake. Also, without some sort of indicator, Vim’s
modal design is awkward here—it’s very easy to forget which mode you’re in. So
I’m stuck at a local maximum using Vim as my text editor but Emacs-style
Readline commands. I suspect a lot of other people are in the same position.</p>

<p>If you feel, not unreasonably, that both Vim and Emacs’ keyboard command
systems are bizarre and arcane, you can customize Readline’s key bindings and
make them whatever you like. This is not hard to do. Readline reads a
<code>~/.inputrc</code> file on startup that can be used to configure various options and
key bindings. One thing I’ve done is reconfigured <code>Ctrl-K</code>. Normally it deletes
from the cursor to the end of the line, but I rarely do that. So I’ve instead
bound it so that pressing <code>Ctrl-K</code> deletes the whole line, regardless of where
the cursor is. I’ve done that by adding the following to <code>~/.inputrc</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code>Control-k: kill-whole-line
</code></pre></div>

<p>Each Readline command (the documentation refers to them as <em>functions</em>) has a
name that you can associate with a key sequence this way. If you edit
<code>~/.inputrc</code> in Vim, it turns out that Vim knows the filetype and will
help you by highlighting valid function names but not invalid ones!</p>

<p>Another thing you can do with <code>~/.inputrc</code> is create canned macros by mapping
key sequences to input strings. <a href="https://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/readline/readline.html">The Readline
manual</a> gives one
example that I think is especially useful. I often find myself wanting to save
the output of a program to a file, which means that I often append something
like <code>&gt; output.txt</code> to Bash commands. To save some time, you could make this a
Readline macro:</p>

<div><pre><code>Control-o: "&gt; output.txt"
</code></pre></div>

<p>Now, whenever you press <code>Ctrl-O</code>, you’ll see that <code>&gt; output.txt</code> gets added
after your cursor on the command line. Neat!</p>

<p>But with macros you can do more than just create shortcuts for
strings of text. The following entry in <code>~/.inputrc</code> means that, every time I
press <code>Ctrl-J</code>, any text I already have on the line is surrounded by <code>$(</code> and
<code>)</code>. The macro moves to the beginning of the line with <code>Ctrl-A</code>, adds <code>$(</code>,
then moves to the end of the line with <code>Ctrl-E</code> and adds <code>)</code>:</p>



<p>This might be useful if you often need the output of one command to use for
another, such as in:</p>


<p>The <code>~/.inputrc</code> file also allows you to set different values for what the
Readline manual calls <em>variables</em>. These enable or disable certain Readline
behaviors. You can use these variables to change, for example, how Readline
auto-completion works or how the Readline history search works. One variable
I’d recommend turning on is the <code>revert-all-at-newline</code> variable, which by
default is off. When the variable is off, if you pull a line from your command
history using the reverse search feature, edit it, but then decide to search
instead for another line, the edit you made is preserved in the history. I find
this confusing because it leads to lines showing up in your Bash command
history that you never actually ran. So add this to your <code>~/.inputrc</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code>set revert-all-at-newline on
</code></pre></div>

<p>When you set options or key bindings using <code>~/.inputrc</code>, they apply wherever
the Readline library is used. This includes Bash most obviously, but you’ll
also get the benefit of your changes in other programs like <code>irb</code> and <code>psql</code>
too! A Readline macro that inserts <code>SELECT * FROM</code> could be useful if you often
use command-line interfaces to relational databases.</p>

<h2 id="chet-ramey">Chet Ramey</h2>
<p>GNU Readline is today maintained by Chet Ramey, a Senior Technology Architect
at Case Western Reserve University. Ramey also maintains the Bash shell. Both
projects were first authored by a Free Software Foundation employee named Brian
Fox beginning in 1988. But Ramey has been the sole maintainer since around
1994.</p>

<p>Ramey told me via email that Readline, far from being an original idea, was
created to implement functionality prescribed by the POSIX specification, which
in the late 1980s had just been created. Many earlier shells, including the
Korn shell and at least one version of the Unix System V shell, included line
editing functionality. The 1988 version of the Korn shell (<code>ksh88</code>) provided
both Emacs-style and Vi/Vim-style editing modes. As far as I can tell from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151105130220/http://www2.research.att.com/sw/download/man/man1/ksh88.html">the
manual
page</a>,
the Korn shell would decide which mode you wanted to use by looking at the
<code>VISUAL</code> and <code>EDITOR</code> environment variables, which is pretty neat. The parts of
POSIX that specified shell functionality were closely modeled on <code>ksh88</code>, so
GNU Bash was going to have to implement a similarly flexible line-editing
system to stay compliant. Hence Readline.</p>

<p>When Ramey first got involved in Bash development, Readline was a single source
file in the Bash project directory. It was really just a part of Bash. Over
time, the Readline file slowly moved toward becoming an independent project,
though it was not until 1994 (with the 2.0 release of Readline) that Readline
became a separate library entirely.</p>

<p>Readline is closely associated with Bash, and Ramey usually pairs Readline
releases with Bash releases. But as I mentioned above, Readline is a library
that can be used by any software implementing a command-line interface. And
it’s really easy to use. This is a simple example, but here’s how you would you
use Readline in your own C program. The string argument to the <code>readline()</code>
function is the prompt that you want Readline to display to the user:</p>

<div><pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include "readline/readline.h"

int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
    char* line = readline("my-rl-example&gt; ");
    printf("You entered: \"%s\"\n", line);

    free(line);

    return 0;
}
</code></pre></div>

<p>Your program hands off control to Readline, which is responsible for getting a
line of input from the user (in such a way that allows the user to do all the
fancy line-editing things). Once the user has actually submitted the line,
Readline returns it to you. I was able to compile the above by linking against
the Readline library, which I apparently have somewhere in my library search
path, by invoking the following:</p>



<p>The Readline API is much more extensive than that single function of course,
and anyone using it can tweak all sorts of things about the library’s behavior.
Library users can even add new functions that end users can configure via
<code>~/.inputrc</code>, meaning that Readline is very easy to extend. But, as far as I
can tell, even Bash ultimately calls the simple <code>readline()</code> function to get
input just as in the example above, though there is a lot of configuration
beforehand. (See <a href="https://github.com/bminor/bash/blob/9f597fd10993313262cab400bf3c46ffb3f6fd1e/parse.y#L1487">this
line</a>
in the source for GNU Bash, which seems to be where Bash hands off
responsibility for getting input to Readline.)</p>

<p>Ramey has now worked on Bash and Readline for well over a decade. He has never
once been compensated for his work—he is and has always been a volunteer. Bash
and Readline continue to be actively developed, though Ramey said that Readline
changes much more slowly than Bash does. I asked Ramey what it was like being
the sole maintainer of software that so many people use. He said that millions
of people probably use Bash without realizing it (because every Apple device
runs Bash), which makes him worry about how much disruption a breaking change
might cause. But he’s slowly gotten used to the idea of all those people out
there. He said that he continues to work on Bash and Readline because at this

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>The polyfill.io domain is being used to infect more than 100,000 websites with malware after a Chinese organization bought the domain earlier this year.</p>
<p>Multiple security firms sounded the alarm on Tuesday, warning organizations whose websites use any JavaScript code from the polyfill.io domain to immediately remove it.</p>
<p>The site offered <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Polyfill">polyfills</a> – useful bits of JavaScript code that add functionality to older browsers that is built into newer versions. These in-fills make life easier for developers in that by using polyfillers, they know their web code will work across a greater range of browsers.</p>

    

<p>Now we're told polyfill.io is serving malicious code hidden in those scripts, meaning anyone visiting a website using the domain will end up running that malware in their browser.</p>

        


        

<p>"The cdn.polyfill.io domain is currently being used in a web supply chain attack," security monitoring biz c/side's Carlo D'Agnolo <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cside.dev/blog/more-than-100k-websites-targeted-in-web-supply-chain-attack">said</a> in an advisory. "It used to host a service for adding JavaScript polyfills to websites, but is now inserting malicious code in scripts served to end-users."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, we understand Google has started blocking Google Ads for websites that use the impacted code presumably to reduce traffic to them and cut the number of potential victims. Affected site owners have also been alerted by the internet giant.</p>

        

<p>"We detected a security issue recently that may affect websites using certain third-party libraries," a Google spokesperson told <em>The Register</em>. "To help potentially impacted advertisers secure their websites, we have been proactively sharing information on how to quickly mitigate the issue."</p>
<p>Sites that embed poisoned scripts from polyfill.io and also bootcss.com may end up unexpectedly redirecting visitors away from the intended location, and send them to malicious sites, Google <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/spazef0rze/status/1805645015663673670">told</a> advertisers.</p>
<p>More than <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://publicwww.com/websites/%22cdn.polyfill.io%22/">100,000 sites</a> are already carrying the hostile scripts, according to the Sansec security forensics team, which on Tuesday claimed Funnull, a Chinese CDN operator that bought the polyfill.io domain and its associated GitHub account in February, has since been using the service in a supply chain attack.</p>

        

<p>Polyfill.io is used by academic library JSTOR as well as Intuit, World Economic Forum, and tons more.</p>
<p>Since February, "this domain was caught injecting <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240624110153/https://github.com/polyfillpolyfill/polyfill-service/issues/2873">malware</a> on mobile devices via any site that embeds cdn.polyfill.io," Sansec, an e-commerce security company, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://sansec.io/research/polyfill-supply-chain-attack">warned</a>, adding that any <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240229113710/https://github.com/polyfillpolyfill/polyfill-service/issues/2834">complaints</a> about the malicious activity are quickly vanished from the GitHub repository.</p>
<p>"The polyfill code is dynamically generated based on the HTTP headers, so multiple attack vectors are likely," Sansec noted.</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/05/03/it_might_take_a_decade/">It may take decade to shore up software supply chain security, says infosec CEO</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/03/26/corejs_maintainer_jailed_code_release/">What happens when the maintainer of a JS library downloaded 26m times a week goes to prison for killing someone with a motorbike? Core-js just found out</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/03/25/python_package_malware/">Over 170K users caught up in poisoned Python package ruse</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/03/17/ai_supply_chain/">In the rush to build AI apps, please, please don't leave security behind</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In fact, Andrew Betts, who created the open source polyfill service project in the mid-2010s, told people earlier this year to not use polyfill.io at all. As we understand it, Betts maintained the project and contributed to its GitHub repo until a few years ago, arguing now that it's really no longer needed.</p>
<p>In February, he said he had nothing to do with the domain name's sale, and presumably the associated GitHub repo, to the Chinese CDN, and urged everyone to remove its code from their webpages as a precaution following the change in ownership.</p>
<p>"If you own a website, loading a script implies an incredible relationship of trust with that third party," he <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/triblondon/status/1761852117579427975">Xeeted</a> at the time. "Do you actually trust them?"</p>
<p>Soon after other popular CDN providers including <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://community.fastly.com/t/new-options-for-polyfill-io-users/2540">Fastly</a>, where Betts works today, and <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/polyfill">Cloudflare</a> created <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://polykill.io/">mirrors</a> of polyfill.io so that sites could continue to use the code for the meanwhile without having to load in stuff from a Chinese entity.</p>
<p>"The concerns are that any website embedding a link to the original polyfill.io domain will now be relying on Funnull to maintain and secure the underlying project to avoid the risk of a supply chain attack," Cloudflare's Sven Sauleau and Michael Tremante <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/polyfill-io-now-available-on-cdnjs-reduce-your-supply-chain-risk">said</a> in February.</p>
<p>"Such an attack would occur if the underlying third party is compromised or alters the code being served to end users in nefarious ways, causing, by consequence, all websites using the tool to be compromised," they added.</p>
<p>Now that seems to be the case. ®</p>

<p dir="auto"><strong>Important:</strong> The Docker image of r2r operates in server and client mode, with the server being the Docker container and the client being your PC. This means you need to append <code>--client_server_mode</code> to all your queries.</p>
<p dir="auto">Additionally, your PC (acting as the client) needs to have Python, Pip, and the dependencies listed in the r2r folder of the repository. Therefore, you need to have the repository cloned on your computer and run <code>pip install r2r</code> in the root folder of the cloned repository.</p>
<p dir="auto">You have the option to run the client inside the terminal of the Docker container (to have everything in one place), but the use of <code>pip install r2r</code> and <code>--client_server_mode</code> is necessary.</p>

<p>While digging through dumps generated from the Apple Mac SE ROM images we noticed that there was a large amount of non-code, non-audio data. Adam Mayer tested different stride widths and found that at 67 bytes (536 pixels across) there appeared to be some sort of image data that clearly was a picture of people. The rest of the image was skewed and distorted, so we knew that it wasn’t stored as an uncompressed bitmap.</p>
<p>After some investigation, we were able to decode the scrambled mess above and turn it into the full image with a hidden message from “<tt>Thu, Nov 20, 1986</tt>“:</p>

<p>Read on for the reverse engineering details of how we recovered this and the other three photographs stored in the ROM, and some information about the Motorola 68000 era Macintosh.<br>

<p>We found this Macintosh SE on the side of the road in Brooklyn and carried it to NYC Resistor. It boots, but lacks any media, so we decided to do some further digital archeology.</p>

<p>We removed the two ROM chips (the ones in the middle of the board, above the VLSI ASIC that is the Integrated Woz Machine) and dumped them with my <a href="https://bitbucket.org/hudson/prom/">PROMdate</a> device. The pinout for the chips is the same as the M27C512 PROM, but with the <tt>Vpp</tt> pin reused for A17. Since it is a mask ROM that can’t be reprogrammed there is no need for the programming pin (Thanks, Nick!). This exapnds the address space to 128 KB (1024 kilobits) compared to the 64 KB of the M27C512 programmable ROM.</p>

<p>The m68k has a 16-bit wide bus, so each 128 KB 8-bit ROM has half a word and they need to be merged into a single 256 KB binary file. We knew we had a good dump and merge when <tt>strings</tt> on the file contained human readable textlike “<tt>Chicago</tt>“, “<tt>PACK</tt>” and “<tt>CDEF</tt>” (if you have the byte order wrong these will be “<tt>APKC</tt>“, etc).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.eeggs.com/items/2258.html">Reports of the easter egg</a> said that it could be found by jumping to address <tt>0x41D89A</tt>. I was able to boot the ROMs in <a href="http://minivmac.sourceforge.net/">Mini vMac</a> and confirm that these were indeed the secret images that had already been discovered. That could have been the end of it, but we wanted to know how they were stored and displayed, and to be able to look for any other surprises stored in the ROM, so further investigation was required.</p>
<p>To disassemble the ROM, I found it easiest to convert the raw binary dump to an ELF file so that <tt>objdump</tt> will process it. We know from history that the ROM was mapped to address <tt>0x0040_0000</tt> (24 MB) in memory, so we set the starting address of the ELF file there. IDA Pro is another great tool for doing exactly this sort of reverse engineering, but we’re using free software for this analysis.</p>
<pre>m68k-elf-objcopy 
  --change-addresses=0x400000

  roms/mac-se.bin 
  roms/mac-se.elf 
</pre>
<p>Looking at the easter egg function address with <tt>m68k-elf-objdump -D roms/mac-se.elf</tt>, we see:</p>
<pre>  41d89a:       4eba 0018       jsr %pc@(41d8b4 &lt;rom+0x1d8b4&gt;)

  41d8a0:       0287 0000 000c  andil #12,%d7
  41d8a6:       6100 002e       bsrw 41d8d6 &lt;rom+0x1d8d6&gt;
  41d8aa:       307c 00b5       moveaw #181,%a0
  41d8ae:       <b>a03b</b>            0120073
  41d8b0:       4efa ffec       jmp %pc@(41d89e &lt;rom+0x1d89e&gt;)
</pre>
<p>The <tt>0xa03b</tt> instruction is odd — Motorola reserved all instructions that start with <tt>0xA</tt>, so this it is not a legal m68k instruction. Instead it will trigger an illegal instruction trap, and the trap handler looks at the next word and vectors to the appropriate handler. This A-line or A-trap is the official way to enter the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_Toolbox">Macintosh Toolbox</a> and saves significant code space over the normal system call methods. <a href="http://www.mac.linux-m68k.org/devel/macalmanac.php">This list of codes</a> tells us that it is <tt>_Delay</tt> and that the value in <tt>%a0</tt> will be used as an argument for how long to delay. We’ll be refering to this list again to understand what is going on in the assembly code.<br>
Based on this we can translate this function into something like “C”:</p>
<pre>void easter_egg(void)
{
    func_41d8b4();
    while (1)
    {
        d7 = (d7 + 4) &amp; 0xC;
        func_0x41d8d6();
        _Delay(181);
    }
}
</pre>
<p>The first function that this calls is <tt>0x41d8b4</tt>:</p>
<pre>  41d8b4:       31fc ffff 0b9e  movew #-1,b9e
  41d8ba:       594f            subqw #4,%sp
  41d8bc:       2f3c 6262 6d63  movel #1650617699,%sp@-
  41d8c2:       4267            clrw %sp@-
  41d8c4:       a9a0            0124640
  41d8c6:       201f            movel %sp@+,%d0
  41d8c8:       6700 0050       beqw 41d91a &lt;rom+0x1d91a&gt;
  41d8cc:       2040            moveal %d0,%a0
  41d8ce:       21d0 0a78       movel %a0@,a78
  41d8d2:       7e00            moveq #0,%d7
  41d8d4:       4e75            rts
...
  41d91a:       a9ff            0124777
</pre>
<p>This makes the A-line call <tt>0xA9A0</tt>, or <tt>_GetResource(0x62626d63)</tt> and sets <tt>0xb9e</tt>, the <tt>RomInsertFlag</tt> to instruct the search function to look in the ROM tables. If the resource get fails it jumps to a debugger trap (<tt>0xA9FF</tt>), which halts the machine. Otherwise it zeros <tt>%d7</tt> and reads the address of the resource from the address returned by <tt>_GetResource</tt> and writes that value into the global memory location <tt>0xa78</tt> (<tt>AppleScratch</tt>).</p>
<p>If you speak ASCII, the constant might look interesting. It is a multi-byte character ‘<tt>bbmc</tt>‘, which you might have noticed in the <tt>strings</tt> output at offset <tt>0x1af4e</tt>, in what appears to be some sort of structure:</p>

<p>As of now we don’t know how to decode the structure, nor what <tt>%a0</tt> points to when it is dereferenced into the global at <tt>0xa78</tt>. We’ll come back to that later, but it clearly has something to do with <tt>0x009A</tt> and the bit in red at <tt>0x1AFDA</tt>.</p>
<p>Moving on to <tt>func_0x41d8d6()</tt>, with psudeo-code interspersed:</p>
<pre>  41d8d6:       moveal a78,%a0
  41d8da:       addaw %d7,%a0
  41d8dc:       movel %a0@,%d3     d3 = _a78[d7];
  41d8de:       movel a78,a7c
  41d8e4:       addl %d3,a7c       _a7c = _a78 + d3;
  41d8e8:       movel 824,a80      _a80 = _824 // ScrnBase
  41d8ee:       movel #340,%d3     d3 = 340;
                                   do {
  41d8f4:       pea a7c
  41d8f8:       pea a80
  41d8fc:       movew #72,%sp@-        // 72 * 8 == 576 bits
  41d900:       a8d0                   _UnpackBits(&amp;_a7c, &amp;_a80, 72)
  41d902:       subql #8,a80           _a80 -= 8;
  41d906:       dbf %d3,41d8f4     } while (d3--)
  41d90a:       pea a7c
  41d90e:       pea a80
  41d912:       movew #64,%sp@-
  41d916:       a8d0                _Unpackbits(&amp;_a7c, &amp;_a80, 64);
  41d918:       rts                 return;
</pre>
<p>Rewriting these three functions entire code in something more like C:</p>
<pre>void draw_bitmap(const uint8_t * packed)
{
	uint8_t * fb = _ScrnBase;

	for (int y = 0 ; y &lt; 340 ; y++)
	{
		_UnpackBits(&amp;packed, &amp;fb, 72);
		fb -= 8;
	}

	_UnpackBits(&amp;packed, &amp;fb, 64);
}

void easter_egg(void)
{
	const uint8_t ** bbmc = _GetResource('bbmc');
	if (!bbmc)
		halt();
	int image = 0;

	while (1)
	{
		draw_bitmap(bbmc[i]);
		i = (i + 1) % 4;
		_Delay(181);
	}
}
</pre>
<p>Adam found the format expected by <tt>_UnpackBits</tt> defined in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PackBits">PackBits on wikipedia</a>, and wrote a <a href="https://github.com/phooky/PROM/blob/master/tools/unpackbits.py">python unpackbits.py</a> that can be given the offsets of the images in the ROM. So the last piece of the puzzle was to figure out where they are located.</p>
<p>And this is where I cheated… Based on a binary search of the image space using <tt>unpackbits.py</tt>, I found that the first one started at <tt>0x1d93c</tt>. Looking slightly earlier in the ROM dump, I saw:</p>
<pre>001d920: 0000 0064 0000 <b>0018</b> 0000 <b>5618</b> 0000 <b>a71c</b>  ...d......V.....
001d930: 0000 <b>f700</b> 0001 4281 0000 0000 30aa 552a  ......B.....0.U*
001d940: 52a5 294a 5294 a529 4a52 2449 1224 44a9  R.)JR..)JR$I.$D.
</pre>
<p>That <tt>0x0000_0018</tt> looks right; <tt>0x1D924 + 0x18 = 0x1D93C</tt>. And immediately afterwards are additional offsets that look like the right spacing for the other bitmaps. That puts the others at <tt>0x22F3C</tt>, <tt>0x28040</tt>, <tt>0x2D024</tt> and something unused at <tt>0x31BA5</tt>. Looking back at the ROM dump from the region of the resource definition, we even see an offset that points to <tt>0x5801D924</tt>. (Don’t be fooled by the leading <tt>0x58</tt> — the Mac SE only had 24-bit addresses, so it will be ignored by the CPU).</p>
<p>Running Adam’s tool, combined with my <tt>hex2png</tt> on the regions produced success for the four images!</p>
<pre>for offset in 1D93C 22F3C 28040 2D024; do
  off_decimal=`echo 16i $offset p | dc`
  ../unpackbits.py $off_decimal 5000 &lt; mac-se.bin 
	| ../hex2png -w 576 -y 384 -s 24576 
	| convert -crop 512x341+0+0 - 0x$offset.png  
done
</pre>
<p>So here is the team that twenty five years ago found space in the ROM to include their own images as an easter egg. Can anyone identify them? Where are they now? Are they “<tt>JCSLWRLBBMABOEMTDAHJTCFJLMBKCRCLAKEHBRDCDAFSHFT</tt>“? If you do know who they are, please send them our thanks for a fun puzzle!</p>

                      <ul><li><b>New Study from BCG Reveals That When Employees Feel Included at Work, the Likelihood of Burnout Is Halved</b></li><li><b>Report Highlights Four Key Employee Sentiments That Have the Biggest Impact on Inclusion</b></li></ul><p><b>BOSTON—</b>At some point in their careers, most, if not all, employees around the world have likely experienced symptoms of burnout at work—a state of exhaustion characterized by disenchantment with one’s job and a sense of inefficiency. A new report released today by Boston Consulting Group (BCG) reveals that, on average, 48% of workers from eight countries indicate that they are currently grappling with burnout.</p><p>Based on a survey of 11,000 desk-based and frontline workers in eight countries (Australia, Canada, France, Germany, India, Japan, UK, and US) and titled <a href="https://www.bcg.com/publications/2024/four-keys-to-boosting-inclusion-and-beating-burnout" data-path="four-keys-to-boosting-inclusion-and-beating-burnout" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>Four Keys to Boosting Inclusion and Beating Burnout</i></a>, the report also reveals that when employees feel included at work, burnout is halved.</p><p>Inclusion is central to building and maintaining a successful workforce. Inclusion in the workplace means that employees feel valued, respected, supported, and like they belong. Workers experiencing higher inclusion are also more likely to stay in their jobs, decreasing turnover costs for businesses.</p><p>For this research, BCG quantified inclusion as a score of how inclusive an employee finds the workplace to be, using <a href="https://www.bcg.com/publications/2023/how-to-improve-inclusion-in-the-workplace" data-path="how-to-improve-inclusion-in-the-workplace" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BCG’s BLISS Index</a>, a statistically rigorous tool that identifies the factors that most strongly influence feelings of inclusion in the workplace.</p><p>Further, the survey revealed four sentiments that have the greatest impact on employees’ overall sense of feeling included:<br></p><ul><li>Good access to resources</li><li>Senior managerial support</li><li>Psychological safety with direct manager</li><li>Fair and equal opportunity for success</li></ul><p>These signal how much, or how little, people are experiencing inclusion in the workplace. When employees feel that these sentiments are positively addressed in their workplace, they feel <i>more</i> included and <i>less</i> burned out. Unfortunately, these most important sentiments are also the ones where survey respondents indicated the lowest levels of satisfaction.&nbsp;</p><p>And while burnout is prevalent across all employee types, it’s far higher for certain subgroups. Women, members of the LGBTQ+ community, people with disabilities, and deskless workers experienced up to 26% higher burnout. Moreover, these employee groups reported lower inclusion than employees who were in majority groups or were desk-based.</p><p>Feeling included means many different things to many different people. It follows that building inclusion can be daunting. But focusing on these four most important sentiments gives employers a clear starting point to ask workers the right questions and focus their efforts to understand the employee experience.</p><p>“Inclusion doesn’t end at recruitment. It requires listening to workers on an ongoing basis and addressing their pain points. It must address both the employee offer and the daily experience of employees with their managers,” said Gabrielle Novacek, a managing director and partner at BCG and coauthor of the report.</p><p>“By focusing on the four key areas and diagnosing where they may be falling short in their current efforts to meet their employees’ needs, companies will be able to identify where to invest and innovate to improve feelings of inclusion and reduce burnout. Establishing programs to meet these needs will help employers avoid the costs associated with burnout, be able to attract talent, and reap the benefits of a thriving workforce.”</p><p>Download the publication <a href="https://www.bcg.com/publications/2024/four-keys-to-boosting-inclusion-and-beating-burnout" data-path="four-keys-to-boosting-inclusion-and-beating-burnout" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Media Contact:</b><br>Eric Gregoire--<a href="mailto:gregoire.eric@bcg.com" data-path="mailto:gregoire" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gregoire.eric@bcg.com</a></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p><em>The attorney in a country town is as much a businessman as the corporation counsel in a great metropolis. - William Jennings Bryan, 1896</em></p><p>The director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Rohit Chopra, coined the term ‘junk fee,’ and has begun restructuring how financial markets work, removing medical debt from credit reports, fostering competition in credit cards, and examining big tech’s entrance into payments. And yet, for ideological reasons, to many bankers, Chopra is a villain running a government agency full of bureaucratic demons, whose goal is to force them to do paperwork on behalf of nebulous ‘consumers.’ </p><p><span>So it was a </span><a href="https://www.housingwire.com/podcast/james-kleimann-on-va-and-cfpb-news-as-well-as-credit-scores-and-freddies-proposal-for-buying-closed-end-seconds/" rel="">weird da</a><span>y last month when Chopra had a room full of mortgage bankers nodding their heads in furious agreement, and even angry at their own trade association for helping a monopoly take advantage of them. HousingWire’s James Kleimann and Sarah Wheeler were shocked, calling it “Must-See TV.” </span></p><div id="youtube2-LJxKNY1G1kQ" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;LJxKNY1G1kQ&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:&quot;1060&quot;,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LJxKNY1G1kQ?start=1060&amp;rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></p></div><p><span>The Mortgage Bankers Association annual conference started with the typical attack on the government, with President and CEO Bob Broeksmit complaining about ‘regulatory knots’ while decrying government crackdowns on junk fees. CFPB Directors often attend these conferences to communicate with the industry, and the conversations aren’t always pleasant. This one didn’t seem like it would be pleasant either. But Chopra went on stage a few hours later and </span><a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/prepared-remarks-of-cfpb-director-rohit-chopra-at-the-mortgage-bankers-association/" rel="">discussed</a><span> an increasing cost center for banks, which is the credit bureaus and FICO. </span></p><p>“Mortgage lenders in the U.S. increasingly face a lack of competition when it comes to accessing data and reports needed for loan origination,” he said. “In many cases, a handful of firms have cornered the market, allowing those companies to levy a tax on every mortgage application or transaction in the country.” Three firms dominate credit reporting: Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. And just one company handles algorithms, the Fair Isaac Corporation, which sells the FICO score. “Mortgage lenders have shared that costs for credit reports and scores have increased,” he said. “Sometimes by 400% since 2022.” Chopra then went on to lay out some regulatory authority the CFPB has to impose price caps.</p><p><span>The audience, surprisingly for a free market capitalist loving group of lenders, was eating it up.</span><em> </em><span>Why? Well it’s the same reason app developers hate Apple and Google, or cattle ranchers dislike JBS, or producers fear Netflix. The credit bureau cartel are </span><em>gatekeepers </em><span>to their market. And they are being squeezed, increasingly </span><a href="https://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/lenders-keep-losing-money-on-every-loan-produced-mba-says#:~:text=Independent%20mortgage%20bankers%20continued%20to,by%20the%20Mortgage%20Bankers%20Association." rel="">losing</a><span> money on every mortgage they issue.</span></p><p>Consumers pay for credit scoring, but they do so indirectly. When someone is thinking of buying a house, he or she visits a mortgage lender. That lender must buy a credit score from FICO and the bureaus to see what that person can afford. When a customer takes out a loan, that mortgage banker has to purchase another more complete report of credit information.  </p><p>Even if a lender thinks the customer would be a good risk, the lender has to buy a FICO score regardless. Mortgage bankers don’t carry the capital to hold the mortgages they make. Instead they make a loan, and then send it onward to the capital markets. First, the government guarantees most mortgages through Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as well as other programs for veterans and first time homebuyers. Then, the government in turn sends these guaranteed mortgages to Wall Street. This complex process relies on a standard to price the loans, and that standard is FICO, combined with the credit information from the three bureaus.  </p><p>Mortgage bankers aren’t typical Wall Street bankers. While mortgage lending can be done by the big guys, real estate is an inherently localized industry with a clubby network of realtors, title insurers, and various other specialists in the home-buying process, so independent players have a strong foothold. There are roughly a thousand independent mortgage lending firms nationwide, and these lenders live everywhere. So their anger at FICO and the credit bureaus has an element of regional resentment, since they are not Wall Street traders, but are local community members trying to help people get homes.</p><p><span>In January of 2024, the </span><a href="https://www.communitylender.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/CHLA-Credit-Score-White-Paper-FINAL-VSN.pdf" rel="">Community Home Lenders of America</a><span> discussed this dynamic with FICO, calling it a utility, which it is. The “combination of FICO’s extremely high market share, and the fact that Washington agencies require lenders to use this company’s product, means that FICO has unilateral, solid-gold market power, the type rarely seen in any US industry short of highly regulated utilities, whereby rates are set by public-utility boards or commissions.” </span></p><p>But the companies themselves know it and say it. In November 2011, then-CEO of Fair Isaac, Mark Greene, explained that the “network effect” of “FICO Scores . . . being sort of the standard language” and “having everybody . . . standardize on a FICO Score, that’s magic.” FICO sells 10 billion scores every year, four times the number of McDonald’s burgers and twice the number of Starbucks coffees sold annually. According to the company itself, nine out of ten lending decisions rely on FICO. </p><p><span>Credit scoring used to cost a relatively small amount of money, but now it can be up to $60 per pull, with the price quadrupling over the last two years for no reason whatsoever. Only one out of every ten prospective customers ends up taking out a mortgage, so higher prices fronted by mortgage bankers add up. And it’s starting to be a major expense, driving some of the mortgage lenders out of the business entirely. In other words, Chopra, though disliked for calling out junk fees charged by bankers, was actually </span><em>attacking a junk fee that</em><span> </span><em>mortgage bankers themselves have to pay.</em></p><p>After his speech, Chopra and Broeksmit sat down for a public discussion, and Broeksmit pushed back on the criticism of FICO, which had led the price hike charge. And here’s where it got fascinating. Broeksmit was supposed to be representing the mortgage bankers in his association. But Chopra pointed out that, though it was a Mortgage Bankers Association event, the session itself was sponsored by FICO. “That was a wild moment right there,” recounted Wheeler on the HousingWire podcast. The head of the Mortgage Bankers Association, was being bribed by a monopolist to betray the bankers he was supposed to represent. And he was just called out for it.</p><p><span>To understand the roots of this fight, we have to go back to the origins of credit reporting, which extend deep into American history. For 150 years, you could simply escape your debt by moving somewhere else, and adopting an entirely new identity. That’s the premise of the iconic American novel </span><em>The Great Gatsby,</em><span> the story of a mysterious East coast tycoon who has hidden his past. Today, </span><em>The Great Gatsby </em><span>couldn’t be written. Or if it were, it would be a one page story, in which someone runs a credit check on a rich liar named Jay Gatsby. </span></p><p><span>In other words, national credit reports are foundational to modern American society, binding us to one another financially as a nation through a network of computerized records. And that national market of identity is relatively new. Until 1970, credit reporting was localized, mostly through coops of town bankers who hired detectives to investigate borrowers, collecting gossip from snitches about who drank too much, who was a Communist, who slept around, and so forth. As the book </span><em>The Naked Society </em><span>noted, bureaus looked at a consumer’s "honesty, potentially dangerous habits, and manliness." Such information was kept in large paper files, it was secret, and it could often lead to someone never being able to get a job in a certain area, and they would never know why. A Gatsby was plausible, since you could escape your debts and your very identity by leaving one state and moving to another. </span></p><p>Credit bureaus, like the FBI who collaborated with them, were creepy, with no limits on their data collection practices. And they saw themselves explicitly as disciplinarians. In 1968, leading credit bureau Retail Credit Corporation President Lee Burge told Congress that the “availability of record information imposes a discipline on the American citizen. He becomes more responsible for his performance whether as a driver of his car, as an employee in his job performance, or as a payor to his creditors. But this discipline is a necessary one if we are to enjoy the fruits of our economy and the present freedom of our private enterprise.”</p><p>After a lot of complaints, Congress acted. In 1970, the only woman on the Banking Committee, Leonor Sullivan, collaborated with Rep. Wright Patman and Senator William Proxmire to write and pass the Fair Credit Reporting Act. This law eliminated the collection of the gossip, which often included information on race, gender, and sexuality. FCRA gave consumers a set of rights over their credit reporting files even though these files were held by private firms, and set limits on what data could be collected and how it could be used. No longer was it acceptable to take someone’s sex life and put it in a secret file, with that information leading to the inability to get a job for years. The new law treated the credit reporting bureaus as public utilities. </p><p>FCRA was in a sense the last of the New Deal legal arrangements, passed at a moment of immense suspicion over government surveillance, part of a set of rules limiting the use of personal information by the Federal government and corporations. But FCRA also structured the national credit market, fostering the computerization of credit information nationwide, and designed to regulate the emerging industry of credit cards, which had picked up steam during the 1960s. “When a man walks into a bank to get a loan,” said a Bank of America executive in Congressional testimony, “he gives up a certain amount of privacy.” Now the bank’s ability to invade his privacy would be regulated and standardized, with the result that a loan could be done in a national market. The Gatsby era ended.</p><p><span>There were </span><a href="https://www.communitylender.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/CHLA-Credit-Score-White-Paper-FINAL-VSN.pdf" rel="">two thousand credit</a><span> bureaus across the U.S. when FCRA passed. By the 1990s, due to this law and to a relaxation of antitrust, they </span><a href="https://www.philadelphiafed.org/-/media/frbp/assets/consumer-finance/discussion-papers/creditreportinghistory_062002.pdf" rel="">consolidated</a><span> into three main firms, Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. These bureaus take advantage and encourage network effects to exclude rivals. They use a “give-to-get” rule, meaning that a lender that wants credit information to determine whether to offer a loan has to give data on its customers back to the credit bureaus in return for that information. The credit bureaus, fostered by regulatory choices and consolidation, were the first wave of big data firms, laying the groundwork for corporations like Google and Facebook years later.</span></p><p>A different corporation, applies an algorithm to these credit bureau files to give each  consumer a specific score, which is known as a FICO score. Having one number for a credit risk simplified lending and borrowing, especially as loans were split up into tranches and sold to Wall Street in large portfolios. In the 1990s, the government, through its various housing finance programs and entities Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, adopted FICO scores as a way to price mortgage loans. In many ways, FICO is the first artificial intelligence firm. </p><p><span>By the 2000s, the credit bureaus and FICO organized the national credit market, especially when it came to home buying. These firms aren’t just private entities, but have become key parts of governance. If you want to verify </span><a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/how-equifax-became-a-private-irs" rel="">someone’s work and income</a><span>, for instance, or manage unemployment insurance claims at scale, you use one of these bureaus, most likely Equifax (which is the successor to the Retail Credit Corporation.) That firm recently </span><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/equifax-inc-nyse-efx-q1-155655174.html" rel="">bragged</a><span> it signed a billion dollar contract with the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, “over a billion dollars that had a price increase in it,” as well as “annual escalators.” Similarly, Experian is now running </span><a href="https://www.experian.com/blogs/healthcare/100-of-the-u-s-population-now-has-a-universal-patient-identifier-qa-with-experian-health-leader-on-why-this-matters/" rel="">identity</a><span> in our health care system with NCPDP/Experian Universal Patient Identifier.</span></p><p><span>The Fair Credit Reporting Act, the first big data governance law, has been updated multiple times, expanding it to include data furnishers, allowing consumers to get free credit information, and moving regulatory enforcement of the law in 2010 from the Federal Trade Commission to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. If you find an error in your report, you can ask for it to be corrected. However, one statutory flaw with the Fair Credit Reporting Act is that responsibility for errors rests with the consumer, not the bureau. Because of this, 44% of consumers who </span><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2024/05/26/credit-report-errors-what-to-do/73816078007/#:~:text=%E2%97%BE%20Among%20those%20who%20read%20their%20reports%2C%2044%25%20found%20errors.&amp;text=%E2%97%BE%20Of%20the%20errors%2C%2027,wise%20to%20read%20their%20reports." rel="">have looked</a><span> at their credit reports found errors, which can cost credit, jobs, or government benefits.</span></p><p><span>The centralization of credit reporting and scoring had the effect of fostering market power among credit bureaus, which most consumers saw not in terms of cost, but in terms of quality and identity theft. In 2017, Equifax had one of the worst data breaches in history, one that led to Congress </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/event/116th-congress/house-event/LC64089/text" rel="">putting</a><span> credit bureau CEOs on the hot seat in a hearing. It didn’t dent its market position, however. So even Patrick McHenry, the most favorable Wall Street Republican, criticized the bureaus. “There is no better example than the oligopoly that was created than the three that are sitting before us here today,” he said. “Our credit reporting system would be well-served by increased competition." </span></p><p>The monetary cost not levied on consumers is paid by the lenders, employers, government, and other users of credit reports and identity services. And since completing a mortgage loan requires a FICO score from each one of the credit bureaus, what is known as a ‘trimerge,’ all three bureaus plus FICO have massive pricing power. FICO tends to lead the price increase, hiking its algorithm cost, which then allows credit bureaus to raise what they charge. These four firms are all doing quite well, which is odd, considering that mortgage lending is way down due to higher interest rates.</p><p><span>FICO, for instance, offers amazing returns to investors. FICO’s CEO, Will Lansing, has </span><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/4nomq47281anynu2rzwm8/Amended-complaint-10-2023.pdf?rlkey=nzhde04j1osy0io98ka5p26vo&amp;dl=0" rel="">noted</a><span> publicly  that his firm has “quite a bit of discretion in whether we want our margins to be higher or lower or where they are.” In 2023, its operating margin </span><a href="https://fico.gcs-web.com/static-files/20bbbc58-1ef1-4881-8504-2c94975b8c0b" rel="">was</a><span> 51%, and it spent just $159 million on research vs $407.3 million of stock buybacks. </span></p><p><span>The three bureaus are benefitting as well.

In 2006, the three credit bureaus decided they were tired of FICO’s position in the industry, and created a rival, called VantageScore, offering credit ratings for much cheaper than FICO and setting off a litigation war within the industry. FICO immediately sued, alleging an antitrust violation, and even trying to </span><a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCOURTS-mnd-0_06-cv-04112/pdf/USCOURTS-mnd-0_06-cv-04112-5.pdf" rel="">trademark</a><span> the idea of giving credit scores between 300-850. </span></p><p><span>Though they </span><a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCOURTS-mnd-0_06-cv-04112/pdf/USCOURTS-mnd-0_06-cv-04112-5.pdf" rel="">lost that suit in 2010</a><span>, they continued litigation and political attacks, including </span><a href="https://www.progressivepolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/UpdatedCreditScoring_2017.pdf" rel="">hiring</a><span> the Progressive Policy Institute in 2017 to write a pseudo-academic paper supporting their monopoly to fool policymakers.</span></p><p><span>Still, the campaign worked. VantageScore never caught on in the mortgage lending part of credit scoring, instead serving as a cheap proxy for credit. When you see a free credit score on most sites, it’s usually not FICO, it’s VantageScore. In 2011, VantageScore </span><a href="https://consumerfed.org/press_release/annual-survey-reveals-that-low-income-consumers-are-most-likely-to-seek-credit-yet-know-the-least-about-credit-scores/" rel="">partnered</a><span> with the Consumer Federation of America, and tried to make the argument that its scores were better for low-income consumers, in the hopes that </span><a href="https://www.fdic.gov/resources/regulations/federal-register-publications/2013/2013-credit_risk_retention-c_22.pdf" rel="">regulators</a><span> would give them a place in the credit scoring world next to FICO. In 2013, VantageScore released its </span><a href="https://www.creditkarma.com/credit/i/vantagescore-30" rel="">3.0 model</a><span>, which scored 30-35 million Americans who couldn’t get a FICO score. It differentiated medical debt, while FICO did not. </span></p><p><span>VantageScore, though, served its purpose. In a complex set of lawsuits and negotiations from 2013 to 2018, FICO and the bureaus seemed to have come to a set of arrangements to jointly hike prices. Though contract terms are still confidential, some details have come out in an </span><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/4nomq47281anynu2rzwm8/Amended-complaint-10-2023.pdf?rlkey=nzhde04j1osy0io98ka5p26vo&amp;dl=0" rel="">ongoing antitrust suit</a><span> in Illinois by banks against FICO and the three bureaus. The claim is that the four firms are now a cartel.</span></p><p>Contracts between FICO and the bureaus create a set of reciprocal obligations. The contracts include a “no equivalent product” clause that prohibits a credit bureau from developing or distributing a non-FICO analytic. It also includes a “dynamic royalty schedule” that allows FICO to charge seven times more if a lender uses a non-FICO score. In return, the bureaus all get the same price from FICO through a ‘level playing field’ clause, which means they know their costs are identical and so can coordinate pricing more easily. </p><p><span>The net effect is that FICO ends up coordinating pricing in the industry. When FICO hikes prices, so do the credit bureaus. Equifax CEO Begor </span><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/4nomq47281anynu2rzwm8/Amended-complaint-10-2023.pdf?rlkey=nzhde04j1osy0io98ka5p26vo&amp;dl=0" rel="">said</a><span> in 2019 that when FICO “put through a price increase . . . Equifax[,] TU and Experian deliver[ed] that price increase to the marketplace, when they increase the price of their credit score. So that rolled through.”</span></p><p>It’s not that hard to come up with a model for underwriting that is reasonably accurate; any bank with scale could probably do it. But FICO uses trade secrets, copyright, patents, or restrictive contracts to block anyone from doing so. A contact in the industry sent me a sample contract, which is full of absurd restrictions on the ability to use FICO scores. </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F70964134-a08b-4b03-9453-66e424df56a5_606x659.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F70964134-a08b-4b03-9453-66e424df56a5_606x659.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F70964134-a08b-4b03-9453-66e424df56a5_606x659.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F70964134-a08b-4b03-9453-66e424df56a5_606x659.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F70964134-a08b-4b03-9453-66e424df56a5_606x659.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F70964134-a08b-4b03-9453-66e424df56a5_606x659.png" width="606" height="659" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/70964134-a08b-4b03-9453-66e424df56a5_606x659.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:659,&quot;width&quot;:606,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:300805,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F70964134-a08b-4b03-9453-66e424df56a5_606x659.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F70964134-a08b-4b03-9453-66e424df56a5_606x659.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F70964134-a08b-4b03-9453-66e424df56a5_606x659.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F70964134-a08b-4b03-9453-66e424df56a5_606x659.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>FICO prohibits not only validating different models against FICO scores, but even displaying FICO scores next to non-FICO scores. All of these tactics are an invitation to the Antitrust Division to investigate the industry, which it periodically has, most recently </span><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/fico-statement-regarding-antitrust-investigation-301024452.html" rel="">in 2020</a><span>. </span></p><p>And there’s another reason it’s impossible to move away from FICO - switching costs. FICO scores on top of a credit bureau file are baked into the operations of most banks and Wall Street buyers of mortgage bonds. One major lender, for instance, identified over 600 places it was using a FICO score in its business processes. Citibank undertook an 18 month operational review just to move to an updated FICO score. And when investors buy mortgage-backed securities, the FICO scores of the loans are a key mechanism to figure out how to price them. Banks hate change and risk, and a different credit scoring system introduces both.</p><p>Still, for the most part, the credit bureaus stayed off the radar, because the cost of a score had been low compared to the credit product. If you’re making a half a million dollar loan, who cares if you have to shell out $10 for a credit pull?  The bureaus and FICO sell to a broad range of customers, including banking, insurance, retail, healthcare and the government. A little bit of cost for each of them isn’t a big deal, especially when they can pass those costs onward.</p><p><span>But recently, that dynamic changed. In 2022, FICO announced a series of what would become an aggregate 500% price increase for the mortgage industry over the next two years. The reason is likely that the firm’s CEO, Will Lansing, </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/highest-paid-ceo-2023-charts-0d65be3b?st=i5zuxt34reeeoek&amp;reflink=article_copyURL_share" rel="">had</a><span> significant payment contingent on the stock price performance in 2023. And it worked, Lansing was the fifth highest paid CEO in America that year. And though FICO claims it doesn’t set the overall price for credit scores (though many in the industry are skeptical), its stock price reflected much higher margins. </span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3255626c-5d3d-49e7-a0e3-a733b339e1cb_725x487.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3255626c-5d3d-49e7-a0e3-a733b339e1cb_725x487.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3255626c-5d3d-49e7-a0e3-a733b339e1cb_725x487.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3255626c-5d3d-49e7-a0e3-a733b339e1cb_725x487.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3255626c-5d3d-49e7-a0e3-a733b339e1cb_725x487.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3255626c-5d3d-49e7-a0e3-a733b339e1cb_725x487.png" width="725" height="487" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3255626c-5d3d-49e7-a0e3-a733b339e1cb_725x487.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:487,&quot;width&quot;:725,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:83920,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3255626c-5d3d-49e7-a0e3-a733b339e1cb_725x487.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3255626c-5d3d-49e7-a0e3-a733b339e1cb_725x487.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3255626c-5d3d-49e7-a0e3-a733b339e1cb_725x487.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3255626c-5d3d-49e7-a0e3-a733b339e1cb_725x487.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>And a backlash began among their customers, notably mortgage lenders. It’s a bad time to be a mortgage lender, with high interest rates absolutely killing the mortgage market. </p><p>A few years ago, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), which runs most housing finance for the government through its control of secondary mortgage buyers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, decided that it might want to create some competition for FICO. So it turned to VantageScore. Only, it got backlash from Wall Street, which didn’t want to bother changing their models for mortgage backed securities.</p><p><span>Instead of allowing mortgage lenders to pick either FICO or VantageScore, FHFA simply required that lenders use both. So now, instead of having to deal with one monopoly, mortgage lenders will have to deal with two, buying two scores appended to different credit bureaus. That </span><a href="https://www.icba.org/newsroom/news-and-articles/2023/06/23/icba-groups-raise-concerns-with-new-fhfa-credit-score-models" rel="">made</a><span> the whole industry mad. And then FICO </span><a href="https://www.housingwire.com/articles/mortgage-group-asks-regulators-to-stop-ficos-price-hikes-of-up-to-400/" rel="">began</a><span> hiking prices, ostensibly to prepare for this new regime, but in reality simply because they could.</span></p><p>The prospect of having to buy more credit scores at a higher price, all at a time when there are significantly fewer customers, has sent mortgage bankers into a frenzy. If nothing is done, mortgage bankers will have to ask customers upfront to pay for their own credit scoring, which will radically limit who can get a loan.</p><p><span>There are additional problems. When a mortgage banker does a credit pull for a consumer, the credit bureau then puts that consumer on a list, and sells his data to other mortgage bankers. These ‘</span><a href="http://www.brokersdata.com/mortgage-trigger-leads.html" rel="">trigger leads</a><span>’ annoy everyone; when you sign up for anything in real estate, you get a zillion calls and emails, because the bureaus sell your data. And the banker who paid for your credit report now has a lot of people calling to try and poach the customer whose credit report you already paid for. Moreover, consumers can’t reuse credit information; every mortgage banker has to order a new credit report and score for the same consumer, which is just more money transferred to FICO and the bureaus from the lender and consumer.</span></p><p><span>When Rohit Chopra spoke in front of mortgage bankers and lambasted FICO and the credit bureaus, he was pushing on an open door. He offered a creative interpretation of a dormant provision of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, which included price caps for utility-style functions like credit reporting, “a fair and reasonable fee,” </span><a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/1681g" rel="">according to the law</a><span>, when a consumer buys their credit information. The FTC </span><a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2004-11-08/html/04-24841.htm" rel="">never</a><span> did much with this section, in the Bush era when the law was passed.</span></p><p><span>It’s not a perfectly applicable legal tool; the law caps prices for what consumers pay, not lenders, but that’s a technical question that can be overcome. Chopra </span><a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/prepared-remarks-of-cfpb-director-rohit-chopra-at-the-mortgage-bankers-association/" rel="">cited</a><span> this law, and asked the industry to propose ideas “to address price gouging in this market.” Chopra mentioned another authority, which is the ability that the CFPB has to force financial entities to let consumers port their financial information from one entity to another. With a price cap and interoperability, consumers could take their credit score from one mortgage banker to another, without those bankers having to pay for a new credit pull each time. </span></p><p><span>(As an aside, if you want to act on this problem, the CFPB recently opened a </span><a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/06/06/2024-12443/request-for-information-regarding-fees-imposed-in-residential-mortgage-transactions" rel="">public comment docket</a><span> for people to weigh in on what to do about these junk fees and asked the mortgage industry to add their thoughts. Individuals from the industry should weigh in, as the Mortgage Bankers Association is conflicted and cannot represent the industry effectively. The deadline for comments is August 6).</span></p><p><span>There are other possible solutions. More competition would be good. In March, Senator Josh Hawley </span><a href="https://www.hawley.senate.gov/hawley-calls-doj-investigate-fico-anticompetitive-practices/" rel="">asked</a><span> the Antitrust Division to investigate FICO again over its recent price hikes. It should, and that could encourage the firms to stop their aggressive gouging. There are also private suits; the current antitrust case against FICO is proceeding apace. In addition, the FHFA could change its poor decision, and allow mortgage lenders to pick either FICO or VantageScore, which would foster price competition among them. That would require some significant technical changes to how Fannie and Freddie package loans, but they can do that if they want. And then of course Congress could act, and either pass explicit price caps in this particular area, since FICO is clearly a utility, or force FICO to just let other entities use their algorithm so it faces competition.</span></p><p>One of the more interesting dynamics in politics today is what happens when groups of business leaders collectively realize they are being subjected to a coercive monopoly. They often look around and start seeing what others are facing as well. Today, that’s happening among mortgage bankers. What’s particularly interesting is that those HousingWire reporters, who write about and are favorable to mortgage bankers, actually started to notice other consumer harms that Chopra highlighted about credit reporting, once they saw that consumers and bankers were in the same boat. </p><p>Is there a broader lesson here? Well, it’s that in a sense, all of us who make money doing honest business or buying from honest businesses have an interest in the rule of law and assertive regulators. It’s not a coincidence that the people most sympathetic to the problems facing mortgage bankers is Rohit Chopra, an anti-monopolist consumer protection regulator, and Josh Hawley, a populist Senator. After all, who is the real threat to mortgage banking? The CFPB, who is trying to control the costs that they have to pay, and protect consumers at the same time? Or FICO and the credit bureau cartel, who are raising prices in the midst of collapsing demand?</p><p>That’s a lesson being re-learned, in a broader sense, not just by mortgage bankers today, but by independent pharmacists, grocery store owners, farmers and ranchers, app developers, Hollywood producers, doctors, car repair shop owners, and anyone seeing their livelihood squeezed by a coercive middleman. Eventually, someone hits on either government regulation or antitrust, and then the conversations start. In the Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson wrote that “governments are instituted” in order to “to secure these rights” of “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.” These kinds of problems aren’t just something government can tackle, but why a free people build governments in the first place.</p><p><span>Thanks for reading!

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Google Search will stop its <a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-rolling-out-continuous-scroll-on-mobile-375171">continuous scroll</a> user experience where Google loads more results as you scroll past the first page of the search results. Instead, you will see see the classic and old pagination bar at the footer of the Google Search results.</p>



<p><strong>Desktop first. </strong>Starting today, Google will start to turn off continuous scroll for the desktop Google Search results. </p>



<p>Google launched continuous scroll on desktop search in <a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-brings-continuous-scroll-to-desktop-search-results-390004">December 2022</a> and first in mobile search in <a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-rolling-out-continuous-scroll-on-mobile-375171">October 2021</a>.  So continuous scroll only lasted about a year and a half for desktop search.</p>



<p>Google will remove continuous scroll from the mobile search results in the coming month.</p>



<p><strong>What Google said. </strong>A Google spokesperson told Search Engine Land that today, June 25, removing the ability to continuously scroll on desktop Search results, followed by mobile in the coming months. </p>



<p>The “Next” at the bottom of the page will show on desktop search and the “More results” button will show on mobile search.</p>



<p>Google said this change is to allow the search company to serve the search results faster on more searches, instead of automatically loading results that users haven’t explicitly requested. Google also told us that it found that loading more results automatically didn’t lead to significantly higher satisfaction with Google Search.</p>



<p><strong>What continuous scroll looks like on desktop.&nbsp;</strong>Here is a GIF of continues scroll in action on desktop search:</p>

<p><strong>Why we care. </strong>If you were on page two, you may see less clicks to your website. It all depends on if those searchers scroll and now click to the next page. Also this&nbsp;<a href="https://searchengineland.com/how-googles-continuous-scroll-can-affect-impressions-and-ctr-375738">may impact your Search Console data</a>&nbsp;because searchers may scroll more or less versus click the “Next” button.</p>

  <p>The Phil Hartman story could — and perhaps should ‚ be told in two parts.</p><p>In the first story, a charismatic comic goes from the stand-up circuit to <em>Saturday Night Live</em>, becoming an invaluable cast member on America’s most hallowed skit show and graduating to legendary roles on <em>The Simpsons</em>. In the second, an actor on the brink of genuine stardom is murdered, the victim of a terrifying act of domestic violence.</p><p>These stories are best kept distinct in order to fully appreciate Hartman, who – like many tragic artists before him – runs the risk of becoming all but synonymous with his sensational death. His life was so much more than his tragic and infamous killing, enshrined not only in his art, but his charismatic personality often celebrated by his many co-stars and collaborators. We’ll never hear him as Zapp Brannigan or see him in the Troy McClure film he was planning, but thankfully, we’ll always have “<a href="https://youtu.be/cVFsS-AcnjM"><span>A Fish Called Selma</span></a>,” and we’ll never have to go without <a href="https://youtu.be/b5wfPlgKFh8"><span>his pitch-perfect Reagan</span></a>.</p><p>There is, however, a third thread to Hartman’s story, a chapter of public life that’s far less recognized than his indelible screen presence. It picks up long before his charismatic rise to the peak of comedy, when Hartman was more class clown than class act, a Canadian kid moving about the United States. Still going by Hartmann, his birth name, Phil graduated from Westchester High in Los Angeles, taking up art at Santa Monica City College. He soon dropped out to become a roadie for local rock band <a href="http://www.thefinalvinyl.com/rocknfoo.htm"><span>Rockin’ Foo</span></a> and, when the group needed art for <a href="https://www.discogs.com/Rockin-Foo-Rockin-Foo/master/634497"><span>their debut</span></a>, his past as a visual art student made him a natural candidate for the job. The four-piece must’ve liked his work, as Hartmann illustrated — and signed — the art to both <a href="https://www.discogs.com/Rockin-Foo-Rockin-Foo/master/700801"><span>their first and second records</span></a>.</p>

  <p>In 1972, three years on from dropping out, Hartmann started studying graphic design at California State University. This time around he graduated, but not before taking on some projects from his music scene connections. In ‘72 alone, Phil cut covers for power pop four-piece <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bones_(band)"><span>Bones</span></a>, boasting an approachable group photo; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_Food_and_Drug_Act_(band)"><span>The Pure Food and Drug Act</span></a>, whose <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeT76FLDC68&amp;list=OLAK5uy_mUmWJCZMdA2sDP2y43XQLJFL074XxHMnA&amp;ab_channel=PureFoodandDrugAct-Topic"><span>sole record</span></a> bears an FDA-inspired stamp; and Pure Food and Drug Act member <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Mandel"><span>Harvey Mandel</span></a>, for whom Hartmann depicted the scale-laden psychedelia of <a href="https://youtu.be/lVYnmj3t3Ww"><span><em>The Snake</em></span></a>.</p><p>On graduating, Phil opened his own graphic design studio and started taking on commissions. His first big client came to him through his brother, former Geffen-Roberts staffer John Hartmann, who’d recently left that fledgling managerial company and started his own business with Harlan Goodman. <a href="https://www.discogs.com/artist/2194684-Hartmann-Goodman"><span>Hartmann &amp; Goodman</span></a> had managed to make away with a couple of Geffen’s clients, including British rock trio America — you know what they say, a Goodman is a Hartmann to find — but it was their totally new relationship with country rock band <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poco"><span>Poco</span></a> that saw Phil strike up a rapport.</p><p>In hindsight, it’s possible to see Poco as something of an odds-and-ends band. That’s not how it was at the time, but the group — founded by Buffalo Springfield alumni Richie Furay and Jim Messina — might be best remembered as a repository for the immense talent within. Bassist Randy Meisner left during their first record, taking the band’s country rock approach to new heights by co-founding The Eagles. His successor in Poco, Timothy B. Schmidt, would later succeed him in The Eagles after tensions led to a vicious backstage brawl. Poco carved out a string of classic rock hits, but their legacy is often positioned between what had been and what would eventually come to pass.</p><p>It makes sense that Hartmann &amp; Goodman would have had a connection to Poco, seeing as Geffen-Roberts had managed acts such as Buffalo Springfield’s <a href="https://www.discogs.com/Stephen-Stills-Stephen-Stills-2/release/2221225"><span>Stephen Stills</span></a> and Randy Meisner’s <a href="https://www.discogs.com/Eagles-Eagles/master/59496"><span>The Eagles</span></a> in the early 1970s. The first record on which Hartmann &amp; Goodman managed the group, 1974’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_(Poco_album)"><span><em>Seven</em></span></a>, was also the first to boast Phil’s artwork, a minimalist image of an upright horseshoe on a solid green backdrop. If there’s nothing radical about the piece, it does speak to a few simple tenets of the group, imparting luck on their first post-Richie Furay record, tethering them to a classic symbol of country living, and tapping into the folklore of the untamed frontier.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Phil’s second commission came just seven months later, when the quartet dropped <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantamos"><span><em>Cantamos</em></span></a>, a return to their lighter country-rock roots. Phil’s familiar Navajo-inspired textile pattern fits the sound, his folksy ochre palette tethering the Californian record to the distant folklore of the American Southwest. A quaint illustration sits inset, showing the four members jamming away inside a log cabin, flanked by a wood-burning stove. It’s cozy, it’s intimate, it’s unadorned: their electric riffs on hold, the art seems to centre the return of the classic, easygoing Poco.</p><p>Hartmann’s graphic design breakout – if it could be called that – came in 1975, the same year that he joined the then-new Groundlings sketch troupe. Phil designed two albums that year: Poco’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_over_Heels_(Poco_album)"><span><em>Head Over Heels</em></span></a>, a poppier tack that nonetheless flopped, and America’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History:_America%27s_Greatest_Hits"><span><em>History</em></span></a>, a bestselling document of that West Coast trio’s first five years. That’s more on Dewey Bunnell, Gerry Beckley and Dan Peek’s hitmaking prowess than anything else, but Hartmann’s visuals make for a tender front to that premature celebration.</p>

  <p>The <a href="https://www.discogs.com/Silver-Silver/release/965407"><span>one and only record</span></a> by L.A. quintet Silver, featuring the brother of Eagles member Bernie Leadon, was overseen by Hartmann &amp; Goodman. It’s no surprise that Phil was responsible for the fairly simple design, framing pictures taken by prolific music photographer <a href="https://www.discogs.com/artist/620325-Guy-Webster"><span>Guy Webster</span></a>. If these records had seen Hartmann in more unadventurous straits — bulky, patterned and often revolving about the photos of others — his biggest personal achievement came in 1978, when Poco released their eleventh record, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legend_(Poco_album)"><span><em>Legend</em></span></a>.</p><p><em>“I did over 40 album covers, including the white Poco album,”</em> said Hartman <a href="https://archive.vn/20120711225150/http://jam.canoe.ca/Movies/Artists/H/Hartman_Phil/1996/12/01/758979.html#selection-983.46-983.71"><span>in a 1996 interview</span></a>. <em>“That's the only piece I have up in my office.”</em> More than just a passion project or a point of pride, <em>Legend</em> was both a personal achievement for Phil and a commercial peak for the radically restructured group. Arriving after years of commercial failure, <em>Legend </em>was recorded by Poco members Paul Cotton and Rusty Young, whose decision to start their own outfit was trumped by the label’s need for brand recognition. A radio-friendly pivot surely helped the record sell, but Hartmann’s cover can’t have hurt those figures, his minimalist rendering of a galloping horse befitting the lofty title.</p>

  <p>It’s little more than a handful of lines, arranged to both cut a figure and imply a shape unseen. The red eye sits as a solitary splash of colour, drawing the audience’s own to the deceptive simplicity of that eight-line head. It’s not hard to see why the cover ended up mounted on Phil’s office wall – not only is it entirely his own vision and handiwork, but it’s easily a standout in his oft-simple portfolio. It might’ve been the peak, or maybe it was just the best so far: either way, that very year, Phil made his acting debut in Brian Trenchard-Smith’s Ozploitation film, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stunt_Rock"><span><em>Stunt Rock</em></span></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>In 1979, Phil’s work with the Groundlings saw him become a leader in the troupe. He helped fellow Groundling Paul Reubens develop<em> </em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pee-wee_Herman_Show"><span><em>The Pee-wee Herman Show</em></span></a>, a stage show that found its way to HBO in 1981. All the while, Hartmann took on a few more graphic design commissions, designing art for Michael Murphey’s 1979 record, <a href="https://www.discogs.com/Michael-Murphey-Peaks-Valleys-Honky-Tonks-Alleys/master/643034"><span><em>Peaks Valleys Honky-Tonks &amp; Alleys</em></span></a>, which stressed folksy photography; America’s <a href="https://www.discogs.com/America-Silent-Letter/release/2650722"><span><em>Silent Letter</em></span></a>, which saw Phil working with photographer <a href="https://www.discogs.com/artist/2235282-Gary-Heery"><span>Gary Heery</span></a>; and The Firesign Theatre’s <a href="https://www.discogs.com/The-Firesign-Theatre-Fighting-Clowns/master/331971"><span><em>Fighting Clowns</em></span></a>, which fused his worlds of troupe comedy and graphic design.&nbsp;</p><p>His final credits include a cover for America satellite <a href="https://www.discogs.com/Avalon-Everyman-A-King/master/1354123"><span>Avalon</span></a>, an AOR trio whose only record bore some graphic similarities to America’s <em>Harbor</em>, as well as two of Poco’s final records, 1982’s <a href="https://www.discogs.com/Poco-Ghost-Town/master/303556"><span><em>Ghost Town</em></span></a> and 1984’s <a href="https://www.discogs.com/Poco-Inamorata/master/415655"><span><em>Inamorata</em></span></a>. These final assignments were the product of faith alone – Hartmann &amp; Goodman hadn’t managed Poco since <em>Legend</em>, and their late return to the younger Hartmann’s vision falls as a vote of confidence.&nbsp;Phil was confident too, but about something else altogether: in 1985, he co-wrote and appeared in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pee-wee%27s_Big_Adventure"><span><em>Pee-wee’s Big Adventure</em></span></a>, a role that helped him secure his place at <em>Saturday Night Live</em>. Phil’s graphic design days were over: he dropped the second ‘n’ from his surname, and the newly-christened Phil Hartman stepped to the national stage.</p>

  <p>On October 11 1986, Phil Hartman made his debut on the 12th season of SNL. It was just two days later that America submitted their revised sales numbers to the RIAA, earning a quadruple platinum plaque for <em>History</em>. That’s more than four million copies in a little over a decade. The band haven’t run the numbers again in the thirty-six years since, but one thing’s for sure: even before he stepped onto the stage at 30 Rockefeller Plaza, Hartmann’s art had gone international.</p><p>These days, it seems that Hartmann’s most famous covers are the ones he didn’t design. A persistent rumour that he designed the cover for Steely Dan’s <a href="https://www.discogs.com/Steely-Dan-Aja/master/16921"><span><em>Aja</em></span></a> isn’t all that far-fetched, given the proximity of Poco — bassist Schmidt sung backing vocals on three <em>Aja</em> tracks — and the minimalist bent that characterised some of Phil’s work. It’s nice to believe that Hartmann might’ve been hip to the Dan, but <em>Aja</em> owes its striking cover to photographer <a href="https://www.discogs.com/artist/2983708-Hideki-Fujii"><span>Hideki Fujii</span></a> and graphic designers <a href="https://www.discogs.com/artist/3226490-Patricia-Mitsui"><span>Patricia Mitsui</span></a> and <a href="https://www.discogs.com/artist/1123834-Geoff-Westen?type=Credits&amp;subtype=Visual&amp;filter_anv=0"><span>Geoff Westen</span></a>. It’s also easy to see why some believe that Hartmann was responsible for America’s <a href="https://www.discogs.com/America-Hearts/master/67408"><span><em>Hearts</em></span></a>, but that cover was designed by the ever-prolific Gary Burden.&nbsp;</p><p>That being said, there are more Hartmann covers out there. The man himself ballparked his folio at <em>“more than 40”</em> pieces, but Discogs puts just 21 covers to his name, suggesting that there’s just as many still waiting to be exhumed, their attributions yet to make it to the internet. It could be that they’re long out of print, tethered to minor projects that have since faded from our collective memory, or perhaps it’s an issue with credits, like <a href="https://imgur.com/a/q7fJYQf"><span>his Crosby, Stills and Nash logo</span></a>.</p><p>That’s stuff we might never know. If one thing’s for sure, it’s that whether you know him as Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, Lionel Hutz or Troy McClure, you might remember Phil Hartman from more places than you’d think. </p>
