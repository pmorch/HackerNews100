<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>I was sitting in a suburban Cincinnati Starbucks when I realized everything was going to change. </p><p>It was early 2008, and a friend was showing me his new phone. He loaded a website and passed his iPhone across the table, and I scrolled down the page. It was slow and clunky, but it was real. “There it is,” he said. “The internet on my phone.”&nbsp;</p><p>It was like seeing the moment that something fragile falls out of your hands. You know it’s going to be everywhere, but for a second, it isn’t. And everything <em>did</em> change, though not all at once. In the early days, the iPhone was powerful — exciting even — but not dominant. I carried a work-issued Blackberry Curve well into 2012. People had a lot of different phones back then, actually; Nokias, Motorolas, HTCs, Palms. But over time, they were seemingly replaced one by one in the hands of everyone I knew, all with the same device: the iPhone.</p><div><p>Over time, they were seemingly replaced one by one with the same device: the iPhone</p></div><p>I didn’t cover smartphones then, but even just being adjacent to mobile tech, I could feel that the energy around a new iPhone launch was different. Normal people were aware of them, making them very different from the camera launch events I was covering. And they truly felt like <em>events</em>, something that made everyone stop and take notice. They reverberated across the country — from Cupertino all the way to suburban Cincinnati.&nbsp;</p><p>But over the years, the vibe slowly shifted. Last fall, coming off an intense couple weeks of testing the iPhone 15 Pro, I stopped by my wireless carrier’s local store. A sales associate and I chatted as he swapped my eSIM back to a physical SIM card. “What do you think of the new iPhones?” I asked. They were on the store shelves and had only gone on sale a few days ago. “Eh,” he said, “they’re phones.”</p><p>As much as Apple would like us to think otherwise, this is where we are: iPhones are just phones. To most people — even to someone who spends all day selling them — they’re just a tool, and getting a new one feels like an inevitability, not an event. Something about as exciting as upgrading your washing machine.&nbsp;</p><p>Phones have assumed a more appliance-like position in our consciousness; that much was inevitable. That’s not necessarily a problem for us, the consumers, but that’s <em>definitely </em>a problem for Apple. Despite its efforts to diversify over the years, it is still a company whose massive fortunes largely rest on one humble product: the iPhone. Apple has a vested interest in keeping us believing that the brand name on your phone matters.</p><p>Apple’s answer has been to build the walls of its garden higher and higher, making sure customers use its own products and nothing else. Now, those walls are threatening to come tumbling down.</p><div><div role="button" aria-label="Zoom" tabindex="0"><figure><div><p><span><img alt="A hand holding up an iPhone 15 Pro model" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" sizes="(max-width: 1023px) 100vw, 744px" srcset="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:5568x3712/376x251/filters:focal(2784x1856:2785x1857):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24916310/DSC_1099.jpeg 376w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:5568x3712/384x256/filters:focal(2784x1856:2785x1857):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24916310/DSC_1099.jpeg 384w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:5568x3712/415x277/filters:focal(2784x1856:2785x1857):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24916310/DSC_1099.jpeg 415w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:5568x3712/480x320/filters:focal(2784x1856:2785x1857):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24916310/DSC_1099.jpeg 480w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:5568x3712/540x360/filters:focal(2784x1856:2785x1857):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24916310/DSC_1099.jpeg 540w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:5568x3712/640x427/filters:focal(2784x1856:2785x1857):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24916310/DSC_1099.jpeg 640w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:5568x3712/750x500/filters:focal(2784x1856:2785x1857):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24916310/DSC_1099.jpeg 750w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:5568x3712/828x552/filters:focal(2784x1856:2785x1857):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24916310/DSC_1099.jpeg 828w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:5568x3712/1080x720/filters:focal(2784x1856:2785x1857):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24916310/DSC_1099.jpeg 1080w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:5568x3712/1200x800/filters:focal(2784x1856:2785x1857):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24916310/DSC_1099.jpeg 1200w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:5568x3712/1440x960/filters:focal(2784x1856:2785x1857):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24916310/DSC_1099.jpeg 1440w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:5568x3712/1920x1280/filters:focal(2784x1856:2785x1857):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24916310/DSC_1099.jpeg 1920w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:5568x3712/2048x1365/filters:focal(2784x1856:2785x1857):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24916310/DSC_1099.jpeg 2048w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:5568x3712/2400x1600/filters:focal(2784x1856:2785x1857):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24916310/DSC_1099.jpeg 2400w" src="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:5568x3712/2400x1600/filters:focal(2784x1856:2785x1857):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24916310/DSC_1099.jpeg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p></div></figure></div><div><figcaption><em>Apple has scaled back or outright eliminated live launch events for its other products — but not the iPhone.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Nilay Patel / The Verge</cite></p></div></div><p>We’re a long way from the “wow” moment of that first iPhone. It’s not all vibes, either. <a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS51899524">According to IDC</a>, smartphone sales shrunk six out of the last seven years. The firm attributes some of that slump to improved device durability. Just about every flagship phone sold in the past few years, Apple’s lineup included, has offered full water resistance, meaning they’ll survive a brief dip in a body of fresh water. My 2016 iPhone SE did not survive such a fate.</p><p>IDC also points at something that’s a little harder to pin down: a “lengthened replacement cycle.” This is where we get into vibes territory: it just doesn’t feel as urgent to replace your smartphone every few years as it used to. In the real early days, lots of things about a smartphone were just <em>bad</em>. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/9/21/3363238/iphone-5-review#:~:text=lack%20of%20stutter-,Battery%20Life,-One%20of%20the">Battery life wasn’t great</a>. Cameras were bad. Processors would chug, and console-quality mobile gaming was a distant vision. But all those things have gotten much better and increasingly irrelevant in the better part of the past decade.</p><p>Apple consistently ranks as one of the top three companies by revenue in the US, but it is the only company on those lists that makes most of its money from one very specific business: making and selling phones. When the smartphone market is in decline, Apple feels it in a way that Amazon and Walmart don’t. </p><p>So it’s been doing the logical thing for years, which is finding other ways to make money, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/20/18273179/apple-icloud-itunes-app-store-music-services-businesses">it’s been largely successful</a>, particularly as it added the App Store and services like Apple Music. But its fortunes still rest disproportionately on iPhone sales: in <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/pdfs/fy2024-q1/FY24_Q1_Consolidated_Financial_Statements.pdf">Apple’s 2024 Q1 financials</a>, it reports net sales of $119.6 billion in the three months prior to December 30th, 2023, with $69.7 billion attributed to the iPhone. Services — the second-highest business segment — contributed only $23 billion.</p><div><div role="button" aria-label="Zoom" tabindex="0"><figure><div><p><span><img alt="iPhone 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max on a backdrop of colorful bouncy balls." loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" sizes="(max-width: 1023px) 100vw, 744px" srcset="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/376x251/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24020037/226270_iPHONE_14_PHO_akrales_0685.jpg 376w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/384x256/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24020037/226270_iPHONE_14_PHO_akrales_0685.jpg 384w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/415x277/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24020037/226270_iPHONE_14_PHO_akrales_0685.jpg 415w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/480x320/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24020037/226270_iPHONE_14_PHO_akrales_0685.jpg 480w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/540x360/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24020037/226270_iPHONE_14_PHO_akrales_0685.jpg 540w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/640x427/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24020037/226270_iPHONE_14_PHO_akrales_0685.jpg 640w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/750x500/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24020037/226270_iPHONE_14_PHO_akrales_0685.jpg 750w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/828x552/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24020037/226270_iPHONE_14_PHO_akrales_0685.jpg 828w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/1080x720/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24020037/226270_iPHONE_14_PHO_akrales_0685.jpg 1080w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/1200x800/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24020037/226270_iPHONE_14_PHO_akrales_0685.jpg 1200w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/1440x960/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24020037/226270_iPHONE_14_PHO_akrales_0685.jpg 1440w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/1920x1280/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24020037/226270_iPHONE_14_PHO_akrales_0685.jpg 1920w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/2048x1365/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24020037/226270_iPHONE_14_PHO_akrales_0685.jpg 2048w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/2400x1600/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24020037/226270_iPHONE_14_PHO_akrales_0685.jpg 2400w" src="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/2400x1600/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24020037/226270_iPHONE_14_PHO_akrales_0685.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p></div></figure></div><div><figcaption><em>Despite its best efforts, iPhone sales still make up a massive chunk of Apple’s sales.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge</cite></p></div></div><p>Early in its life, the iPhone gained a reputation as a platform that perfected new concepts rather than pioneered them. It wasn’t the first to implement face unlock, high-refresh-rate screens, or telephoto cameras, but it could be relied on to implement new-ish technologies with the edges roughed out (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/9/27/3416396/apple-races-the-clock-maps-issues">well, usually</a>). But as Apple amassed a pile of proprietary features and services in its walled garden — the App Store, iMessage, FaceTime, Apple Wallet, to name a few — and its dominance in the US grew, one thing became clear: the company had no interest in letting anything in that might threaten its position.</p><p>As those products took off, Apple deployed some defensive moves. Take iMessage: it launched in 2011 and reached 140 million users by 2012. In 2013, there was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/9/24/4765240/imessage-chat-for-android-spoof-app">clearly an appetite</a> for cross-platform compatibility. The benefits were obvious — seamless communication rather than a confusing mix of green and blue bubbles, SMS and not. And it wasn’t just a matter of Android users wanting <em>in;</em> keeping Android users out gives iOS users an objectively worse and less secure experience. Apple executive Eddy Cue <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22375128/apple-imessage-android-ecosystem-lock-in-epic-games-filings-app-store-dispute">pushed for an Android iMessage app</a> in 2016, but Craig Federighi responded in an internal email that “iMessage on Android would simply serve to remove an obstacle to iPhone families giving their kids Android phones.”&nbsp;</p><div><p>And Tim Cook, famously, thinks <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/7/23342243/tim-cook-apple-rcs-imessage-android-iphone-compatibility">you should “buy your Mom an iPhone”</a> if you want to use iMessage with her.&nbsp;</p></div><p>We can see the same strategy at work across the ecosystem — from FaceTime to watches, you’ll find a lot of friction if you try to take an Apple product outside of the garden. But while we can speculate about Apple’s motivations for peripherals and services, when it comes to iMessage, there’s no mystery at all: Apple kept it locked down for a decade to keep iOS users locked in. Executives at the company have said as much, both internally and out loud.&nbsp;</p><div><div role="button" aria-label="Zoom" tabindex="0"><figure><div><p><span><img alt="Blue iPhone 15 Pro and natural titanium iPhone 15 Pro Max leaning against a perforated metal background." loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" sizes="(max-width: 1023px) 100vw, 744px" srcset="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/376x251/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24931973/236794_iPhone_15_pro_pro_Max_VPavic_0017.jpg 376w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/384x256/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24931973/236794_iPhone_15_pro_pro_Max_VPavic_0017.jpg 384w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/415x277/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24931973/236794_iPhone_15_pro_pro_Max_VPavic_0017.jpg 415w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/480x320/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24931973/236794_iPhone_15_pro_pro_Max_VPavic_0017.jpg 480w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/540x360/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24931973/236794_iPhone_15_pro_pro_Max_VPavic_0017.jpg 540w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/640x427/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24931973/236794_iPhone_15_pro_pro_Max_VPavic_0017.jpg 640w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/750x500/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24931973/236794_iPhone_15_pro_pro_Max_VPavic_0017.jpg 750w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/828x552/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24931973/236794_iPhone_15_pro_pro_Max_VPavic_0017.jpg 828w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/1080x720/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24931973/236794_iPhone_15_pro_pro_Max_VPavic_0017.jpg 1080w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/1200x800/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24931973/236794_iPhone_15_pro_pro_Max_VPavic_0017.jpg 1200w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/1440x960/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24931973/236794_iPhone_15_pro_pro_Max_VPavic_0017.jpg 1440w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/1920x1280/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24931973/236794_iPhone_15_pro_pro_Max_VPavic_0017.jpg 1920w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/2048x1365/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24931973/236794_iPhone_15_pro_pro_Max_VPavic_0017.jpg 2048w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/2400x1600/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24931973/236794_iPhone_15_pro_pro_Max_VPavic_0017.jpg 2400w" src="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/2400x1600/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24931973/236794_iPhone_15_pro_pro_Max_VPavic_0017.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p></div></figure></div><div><figcaption><em>Apple keeps its customers and its platform under tight control.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge</cite></p></div></div><p>Customer lock-in is only part of the equation — there’s also the platform itself and the people who develop for it. Unsurprisingly, Apple has also maintained a death grip of control over the app store since its inception, placing strict limitations on developers making apps for the platform and building it into a revenue-generating machine for the company.</p><p>The app store launched in 2008 with a key policy in place: Apple would get a 30 percent commission on every app sold. Later, when the company added in-app purchases, it would require developers to use Apple’s own payment processing — with the same 30 percent cut applied to every transaction. Over the years, the app store ballooned — from its initial 500 apps to <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/05/developers-generated-one-point-one-trillion-in-the-app-store-ecosystem-in-2022/">“thousands” at the end of 2008</a> to its <a href="https://www.apple.com/app-store/">present-day total of 1.8 million</a>. And in 2020 alone, it brought Apple <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22220873/apple-2020-app-store-revenue-60-billion-dollars">more than $60 billion in revenue</a>.</p><p>As the App Store grew, Apple’s strict controlling measures came under more and more criticism. Developers complained that the company’s app review process — deciding which apps get to go into the App Store and which don’t — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/4/18652460/apple-class-action-lawsuit-monopoly-app-store">was opaque and unfair</a>. Complaints about the company’s 30 percent cut on purchases led Apple to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/2/12774758/apple-developers-app-store-new-subscription-rules">drop its fee down to 15 percent</a> on subscriptions after the first year. And <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/11/19/9757516/ipad-pro-apps-pricing-ios-developers-opt-out">smaller developers struggled</a> to find a business model that worked between Apple’s commission fees and strict guidelines over how and when it could charge customers for their product.</p><div><p>By 2016, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22667242/apple-app-store-major-policy-changes-history">Apple was taking a much more reactive stance</a> than in the early days — introducing policy changes more frequently and usually in response to criticism.&nbsp;</p></div><p>The result has been a patchy and confusing network of fixes. Certain types of apps <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/27/18519888/apple-screen-time-app-tracking-parental-controls-report">were disallowed</a> and then <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/4/18653142/apple-mdm-parental-control-screen-time-app-store-guidelines-update">quietly re-allowed</a>. App store policies made it difficult for services like Kindle and Netflix to exist on iOS since they let users access subscription content purchased outside of those apps. So Apple <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#reader-apps">carved out an exception</a> for these apps, but <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#reader-apps">controversy ensued</a> when an email app maker tried to apply the classification to its app. Apple’s strategy is starting to look a lot more like defense than offense.&nbsp;</p><p>The tactics are different, but Apple’s situation now smacks of Microsoft’s in the ’90s. Back then, Microsoft was the dominant force in the PC market and made every effort to keep it that way by placing restrictions on Windows. Netscape emerged as a threat to Windows’ dominance, so Microsoft <a href="https://www.justice.gov/atr/us-v-microsoft-courts-findings-fact#iv">cut off its air supply</a> by giving away its own web browser for free with Windows. Microsoft recognized that Java could make porting software from Windows to other systems easier, so it sabotaged Sun’s efforts and instructed its allies not to aid the company.</p><p>But you can only play whack-a-mole with the competition — or push back <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/21/24107633/apple-streaming-super-apps-doj-lawsuit#:~:text=payments%2C%20etc.%E2%80%99%20would%20%E2%80%98-,let%20the%20barbarians%20in%20at%20the%20gate.,-%E2%80%99%E2%80%9D">the barbarians at the gate</a> — for so long.</p><div><div role="button" aria-label="Zoom" tabindex="0"><figure><div><p><span><img alt="iPhone on a glass table." loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" sizes="(max-width: 1023px) 100vw, 744px" srcset="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/376x251/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24931345/236792_iPhone_15_Pro_and_15_Pro_Max_product_photos_AJohnson_0001.jpg 376w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/384x256/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24931345/236792_iPhone_15_Pro_and_15_Pro_Max_product_photos_AJohnson_0001.jpg 384w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/415x277/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24931345/236792_iPhone_15_Pro_and_15_Pro_Max_product_photos_AJohnson_0001.jpg 415w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/480x320/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24931345/236792_iPhone_15_Pro_and_15_Pro_Max_product_photos_AJohnson_0001.jpg 480w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/540x360/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24931345/236792_iPhone_15_Pro_and_15_Pro_Max_product_photos_AJohnson_0001.jpg 540w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/640x427/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24931345/236792_iPhone_15_Pro_and_15_Pro_Max_product_photos_AJohnson_0001.jpg 640w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/750x500/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24931345/236792_iPhone_15_Pro_and_15_Pro_Max_product_photos_AJohnson_0001.jpg 750w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/828x552/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24931345/236792_iPhone_15_Pro_and_15_Pro_Max_product_photos_AJohnson_0001.jpg 828w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/1080x720/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24931345/236792_iPhone_15_Pro_and_15_Pro_Max_product_photos_AJohnson_0001.jpg 1080w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/1200x800/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24931345/236792_iPhone_15_Pro_and_15_Pro_Max_product_photos_AJohnson_0001.jpg 1200w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/1440x960/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24931345/236792_iPhone_15_Pro_and_15_Pro_Max_product_photos_AJohnson_0001.jpg 1440w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/1920x1280/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24931345/236792_iPhone_15_Pro_and_15_Pro_Max_product_photos_AJohnson_0001.jpg 1920w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/2048x1365/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24931345/236792_iPhone_15_Pro_and_15_Pro_Max_product_photos_AJohnson_0001.jpg 2048w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/2400x1600/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24931345/236792_iPhone_15_Pro_and_15_Pro_Max_product_photos_AJohnson_0001.jpg 2400w" src="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/2400x1600/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24931345/236792_iPhone_15_Pro_and_15_Pro_Max_product_photos_AJohnson_0001.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p></div></figure></div><div><figcaption><em>The iPhone is at the center of the Department of Justice’s anti-trust case against Apple.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Allison Johnson / The Verge</cite></p></div></div><p>Apple’s reckoning started in the courtroom. In 2020, Epic sued Apple and Google over their app store practices — specifically, the 30 percent commission that Apple helped establish as an industry standard. The court ruled in favor of Epic, but Apple was ordered to let app makers direct users to payment methods outside of those offered by Apple. Then, in 2022, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/24/22994234/eu-antitrust-legislation-dma-digital-markets-act-details">the European Union introduced legislation</a> trying to reign in the power of big tech companies, Apple included. Apple responded to the pressure by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/16/23964171/apple-iphone-rcs-support">promising to support RCS on the iPhone</a> — a standard that updates the relatively ancient SMS/MMS protocol and includes more iMessage-like features.&nbsp;</p><p>The other shoe fell last month when the US Department of Justice <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/21/24105363/apple-doj-monopoly-lawsuit">filed an antitrust lawsuit against Apple</a> for operating an illegal monopoly in the smartphone market. The legal process is just starting, and when it eventually happens, the trial seems likely to drag on for years into the future. The DOJ’s antitrust case against Microsoft was introduced in 1998; appeals stretched into 2007.</p><div><p>Apple has already started implementing changes as a result of the new EU policies: adding a new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/26/24051823/apple-third-party-app-stores-50-cent-fee">app store commission structure</a>, enabling <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24100979/altstore-europe-app-marketplace-price-games">third-party app stores</a>, and creating <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/6/24092026/heres-the-new-ios-default-browser-nag-for-iphone-users-in-europe">a choice screen</a> for users to pick their preferred web browser. But that’s unlikely to be the end of it — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/26/24052162/spotify-apple-app-store-tax-eu-dma">app developers aren’t happy</a> with the company’s “malicious compliance” to new rules under the DMA, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/25/24111232/european-commission-digital-markets-act-investigation">European regulators are investigating Apple’s response</a>.&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>Apple could have had more control over its destiny by opening up its services earlier</p></div><p>One new law or antitrust case might not be enough to bring down the garden walls, but for Apple, the past five years have amounted to an enormous pressure buildup — and it’s not stopping. Apple could have had more control over its destiny by opening up its services earlier, but it didn’t. Now, it’s being forced to react to regulation, creating different rules for iOS in different regions of the world. It’s hard to run a visionary, future-forward company with lawsuits and regulators as a constant distraction — <a href="https://www.wired.com/2000/11/microsoft-7/">just ask Bill Gates</a>.</p><p>In the years that followed my first glimpse of the iPhone, I’ve used more phones than I could possibly recall or count. And over the years, I’ve seen them get faster, more reliable, and harder to distinguish from one another. A new technology can’t wow us forever; eventually, it’s everywhere. History has shown us that one company can only claim dominance over that technology for so long — and the bigger it gets, the more energy it takes to maintain it. </p><p>A little daylight is creeping into the walled garden now, and I’ll bet there are even brighter days ahead of us.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></description>

  <p>I’m continuing to reflect on the past four years with <a href="https://hubris.oxide.computer/">Hubris</a> — April Fool’s
Day was, appropriately enough, the fourth anniversary of the first Hubris user
program, and today is the fourth anniversary of the first kernel code. (I wrote
the user program first to help me understand what the kernel’s API wanted to
look like.)</p>
<p>Of all of Hubris’s design decisions, there’s one that gets a “wait what”
response more often than any other. It’s also proving to be a critical part of
the system’s overall robustness. In this post, I’ll take a look at our 13th and
oddest syscall, <code>REPLY_FAULT</code>.</p>
<h2 id="a-brief-overview-of-hubris-ipc">A brief overview of Hubris IPC</h2>
<p>Hubris uses a small, application-independent kernel, and puts most of the code
— drivers, application logic, network stack, etc. — in separately compiled
isolated tasks. These tasks can communicate with each other using a cross-task
messaging system (inter-process communication, or IPC). (This section will do a
sort of “Hubris in a nutshell” — if you’d like to learn more I recommend the
<a href="https://hubris.oxide.computer/reference/">Reference Manual</a>.)</p>
<p>IPC in Hubris consists of three core operations, implemented in the kernel,
which tasks can request using syscalls:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>RECV</code> collects the highest priority incoming message, or blocks until one
arrives.</li>
<li><code>SEND</code> stops the caller and transfers a message — and control! — to the
receiving task. The caller is parked until it gets a response.</li>
<li><code>REPLY</code> delivers a response to a task that had previously used <code>SEND</code>,
allowing it to continue.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Hubris IPC scheme is deliberately designed to work a lot like a function
call, at least from the perspective of the client.</p>
<p>We often talk about “clients” and “servers” in Hubris, and it’s worth noting
that these are <em>roles tasks play.</em> A client is just a task using <code>SEND</code>, and a
server is a task using <code>RECV</code> and <code>REPLY</code> – but they’re not mutually exclusive.
A task may be a server to some other tasks, and simultaneously a client to
different tasks. For instance, an “LED Blinker” task may call (client) into a
“GPIO driver” task (server), which itself may call (client) into a supervisory
task (server).</p>
<p>To underscore this point, here’s a graph of the IPC flow (green arrows) between
tasks (rectangles) in Oxide’s production server firmware. Notice that almost all
tasks have arrows both coming out (client) and coming in (server).</p>
<p><img src="https://cliffle.com/blog/hubris-reply-fault/gimlet-graph.svg" alt="A directed graph showing layers of tasks in our firmware with edges drawn between them, which is unfortunately difficult to explain entirely in text."></p>
<h2 id="new-and-exciting-failure-modes">New and exciting failure modes</h2>
<p>When writing a function or procedure in almost any programming language, you
make some assumptions about your callers’ behavior. This creates <em>preconditions</em>
for calling the function. Depending on the language, some are explicit, and some
are implicit. In Rust, for instance, if your function takes an argument of
type <code>String</code>, it’s reasonable to assume your caller passes in a <code>String</code> and
not a <code>bool</code>.</p>
<p>Your function has the backing of the compiler here: the caller has to pass a
compatible type for all arguments, or the compiler won’t let them attempt to
call the function. It’s possible to subvert this if you work at it, of course,
but it’s hard to subvert it by accident.</p>
<p>The compiler and linker conspire behind the scenes to make sure that your
program calls the function you intended. This ensures that you won’t be
surprised by code that attempts to call <code>pet_cat</code> and winds up calling
<code>fire_missiles</code> instead, except in very rare circumstances.</p>
<p>Because IPC crosses task boundaries, and tasks in Hubris are separately compiled
programs, you have to be careful making these same assumptions with IPC. If a
client is compiled against the wrong interface, or confuses one task for
another, the compiler won’t have any idea, since it sees only a single program
at a time. In this respect, IPC acts more like communication over a network.</p>
<p>Every task on Hubris that acts as an IPC server has to deal with the following
<em>potential</em> errors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Getting a message with an operation code that isn’t even appropriate for your
interface, like “operation number 48” in a two-operation interface.</li>
<li>Receiving an uninterpretable bag of bytes instead of the message type you were
expecting — or a message that is much too short or long.</li>
<li>Not getting the sort of loaned memory you require (e.g. you need it writable
but you receive it read-only, or don’t receive it at all).</li>
</ul>
<p>But I describe those as <em>potential</em> errors because, in practice…</p>
<h2 id="none-of-this-happens-in-normal-correct-programs">None of this happens in normal, correct programs</h2>
<p>In a normal Hubris program, none of these things happen.</p>
<p>Tasks are connected to each other by configuration in the build system, so it’s
hard to confuse one for the other. Clients use generated Rust code to construct
and send IPCs to servers, which use different generated Rust code to handle the
result. This lets us squint and pretend that the type system works across task
boundaries — it doesn’t, really, but our tools produce a pretty good illusion.</p>
<p>I always hate to penalize the “good” programs for error cases that they can’t
actually hit. All of the obvious ways of handling the <em>potential but unlikely</em>
errors (described above) hurt good programs.</p>
<p>For example: making all IPC operations return a <code>Result&lt;T, IpcError&gt;</code> where the
good programs can’t actually hit any case in <code>IpcError</code> means that, in practice,
they’ll just <code>unwrap()</code> it. That’s a fairly large operation in terms of code
size — especially when we know the code will never be used! — and costs time
at runtime to check for errors that won’t happen.</p>
<p>To keep every client from needing to <code>unwrap()</code> a bazillion errors, we could put
the <code>unwrap()</code> (or more generally a <code>panic!</code>) into the generated code. This
might reduce the code size impact (by centralizing the <code>panic!</code> in one location)
but won’t reduce the cost at runtime.</p>
<p>There’s also a different kind of cost: a <em>design cost.</em> To be able to return a
universal error from any operation, and have it be understood by a caller
attempting any <em>other</em> operation, we have to make rules about the message
encoding. Every operation must be capable of returning an error, every operation
must have a way of encoding <em>this particular</em> error, and the encoding of this
error by all operations must be <em>identical.</em> </p>
<p>This means you can’t express an operation that <em>can’t</em> fail, which is
particularly annoying: as we’ve built our firmware infrastructure on Hubris, we
keep finding operations that really can’t fail. Setting a GPIO pin, for example.</p>
<p>So we dearly needed an alternative to this “universal error code” approach. I
drew inspiration from a weird design decision I made in the Hubris kernel API:
the Hubris kernel is <em>unusually aggressive.</em></p>
<h2 id="the-kernel-is-not-having-any-of-your-nonsense">The kernel is not having any of your nonsense.</h2>
<p>In most operating systems, if you violate the preconditions for a system call,
you get a polite error code back from the kernel — or, at worst, an exception
handler or signal handler gets triggered. You have an opportunity to recover.</p>
<p>Take Unix for example. If you call <code>close</code> on a file descriptor you never
opened, you get an error code back. If you call <code>open</code> and hand it a null
pointer instead of a pathname? You get an error code back. Both of these are
violations of a system call’s preconditions, and both are handled through the
same error mechanism that handles “file not found” and other cases that <em>can</em>
happen in a correct program.</p>
<p>On Hubris, if you break a system call’s preconditions, your task is immediately
destroyed with no opportunity to do anything else.<sup><a href="#sup">1</a></sup></p>

<p>More specifically, the kernel delivers a <em>synthetic fault.</em> This is very similar
to the hardware faults that a task receives if it, say, dereferences a null
pointer, or divides by zero. Those are produced by the CPU for breaking the
processor architecture’s rules. Synthetic faults, on the other hand, are
produced by the kernel for breaking the kernel’s rules.</p>
<p>For example, when a task calls <code>SEND</code>, it passes the kernel the index of the
intended recipient task, and a pointer to some memory containing the message. If
the recipient task index is out of range for the application? Synthetic fault.
If the message pointer points to memory the task doesn’t actually have access
to? Synthetic fault.</p>
<p>Early in the system’s design, I decided not to permit recoverable/resumable
faults. That is, when a program takes a fault — whether it’s hardware or
synthetic — the task is dead. It can run no further instructions. There is no
way to “fix” the problem and resume the task. This was a conscious choice to
avoid some subtle failure modes and simplify reasoning about the system.<sup><a href="#sup2">2</a></sup></p>

<p>But combined with the kernel’s habit of faulting any task that looks at it
funny, this makes the system’s behavior very unusual compared to most operating
systems.</p>
<p>And it’s been <em>great.</em></p>
<p>Initially I was concerned that I’d made the kernel <em>too</em> aggressive, but in
practice, this has meant that errors are caught very early in development. A
fault is hard to miss, and literally cannot be ignored the way an error code
might be. Humility (our debugger) happily prints a detailed description of any
fault it finds; in fact, one made an appearance in my <a href="https://cliffle.com/blog/who-killed-the-network-switch/">last Hubris-related
post</a>, although in that case it was being reported in error:</p>
<pre><code><span>mem fault (precise: 0x801bffd) in syscall (was: wait: reply from i2c_driver/gen0)
</span></code></pre>
<p>This is a synthetic fault that a task receives for handing the kernel a pointer
to some memory (at address <code>0x801bffd</code> in this case) that the task can’t
actually access.</p>
<p>This behavior was <em>so</em> nice to use in practice, in fact, that it suggested a way
to fix our IPC error reporting woes: generalize the same mechanism.</p>
<h2 id="the-server-isn-t-having-any-of-your-nonsense-either">The server isn’t having any of your nonsense, either.</h2>
<p>Once I realized that our unusually strict kernel was actually <em>helping</em>
developers instead of hindering them, I was inspired to implement Hubris’s 13th
and oddest syscall: <code>REPLY_FAULT</code>.</p>
<p>I mentioned <code>REPLY</code> earlier, the mechanism servers use to respond to their
clients. More specifically,</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When a client uses <code>SEND</code> the kernel marks the client’s task as “waiting to
send” to the recipient task.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the recipient uses <code>RECV</code>, one client task “waiting to send” to it is
updated to “waiting for reply.” The client task will remain in that state
until something changes — usually, the server using <code>REPLY</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>REPLY</code> only works on a task marked as “waiting for reply” from the specific
server task that is attempting to reply. It switches the client task back into
a “runnable” state.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><code>REPLY_FAULT</code> is basically the same thing, except instead of delivering a
message and making the task runnable, it delivers a fault and makes the task
dead. With <code>REPLY_FAULT</code>, we can avoid having unnecessary error handling on IPC
operations, because correct programs will just go on as if the problem can’t
occur — and incorrect programs won’t get to <em>handle</em> the error at all!</p>
<p>Like <code>REPLY</code>, a server can only <code>REPLY_FAULT</code> a task that is waiting for its
reply. You can’t use <code>REPLY_FAULT</code> to kill random tasks, only the set of tasks
from which you have <code>RECV</code>’d a message and not yet <code>REPLY</code>’d.</p>
<p>Our system now uses <code>REPLY_FAULT</code> to handle the three cases I mentioned earlier:
a bogus operation code; or a corrupt, truncated, or otherwise nonsensical
message; or if the client doesn’t send the right kind of loaned memory.</p>
<p>But <code>REPLY_FAULT</code> also provides a way to define and implement <em>new</em> kinds of
errors — application-specific errors — such as access control rules. For
instance, the Hubris IP stack assigns IP ports to tasks statically. If a task
tries to mess with another task’s IP port, the IP stack faults them. This gets
us the same sort of “fail fast” developer experience, with the smaller and
simpler code that results from not handling “theoretical” errors that can’t
occur in practice.</p>
<p>Like the kernel’s aggressive handling of errors in system calls, I was initially
concerned that <code>REPLY_FAULT</code> would be too extreme. After I had the idea, I
delayed several months before starting implementation, basically trying to talk
myself out of it.</p>
<p>I was being too careful. <code>REPLY_FAULT</code> has been great. A new developer on the
system recently cited it as one of the more surprising and pleasant parts of
developing on Hubris, which is what inspired me to write this post.</p>
<h2 id="the-joy-of-panicking-other-programs">The joy of panicking other programs</h2>
<p>I mentioned earlier that Hubris IPC was explicitly designed to behave like a
Rust function call from the perspective of the client.</p>
<p>Well, if you violate the preconditions on a Rust function call, the function
will normally respond with a <code>panic!</code>.</p>
<p><code>REPLY_FAULT</code> essentially provides a way for servers to generate cross-process
<code>panic!</code> in their clients, without requiring clients to contain code to do it
— or, perhaps more importantly, without requiring clients to cooperate in the
process at all.</p>
<p>Overall, this combines with some other system features to make Hubris
“aggressively hostile to malicious programs,” as <a href="https://eliza.me/">Eliza Weissman</a> recently
described it. Since attempts at exploitation often manifest first as errors or
misuse of APIs, a system that responds to any misbehavior by wiping the state of
the misbehaving component ought to be harder to exploit. (This hypothesis has
yet to be tested! Please reach out to me if you’re interested in trying to
exploit Hubris. I will help!)</p>
<p>In practice, the only downside I’ve observed from these decisions is that the
system is <em>really difficult to fuzz test.</em> Because I like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_engineering">chaos
engineering</a>, I’ve implemented a small “chaos” task that generates random
IPCs and system calls to test other components for bugs, and almost anything it
does causes it to get immediately reset. To be useful, it has to base all of its
decisions off the one piece of state that is observably different each time it
starts: the system uptime counter. (However, <code>REPLY_FAULT</code> <em>does</em> provide a way
for servers to force chaos upon their clients by randomly killing them, an
option I haven’t fully evaluated.)</p>
<p>But normal Hubris tasks don’t dynamically generate IPC messages, particularly
ones that are deliberately bogus. In practice, they can carry on without
realizing <code>REPLY_FAULT</code> even exists — because unless they do something <em>really
unusual,</em> they will never see the business end of it anyway.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2024/04/26/janky-apple-id-security/">https://mjtsai.com/blog/2024/04/26/janky-apple-id-security/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40178629">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>I had <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2023/10/23/secondary-apple-id-mess-and-inadvertent-password-reset/">another</a> instance of my Apple ID mysteriously being locked. First, my iPhone wanted me to enter the password again, which I thought was the “normal” thing it has done every few months, almost since I got it. But after doing so it said that my account was locked.</p>
<p>Unlocking the account would require a 1-hour Security Delay, it said, because I had Stolen Device Protection enabled, and I was not at one of my familiar locations. <em>I was at home.</em> But I went to <strong>Settings ‣ Privacy &amp; Security ‣ Location Services ‣ System Services ‣ Significant Locations</strong> to check, and for some reason the <em>only</em> location in the list was the grocery store that I go to once every two weeks. It didn’t figure out the location of the home/office where the phone spends nearly all its time and which is identified as Home in Apple Maps, Contacts, and Find My.</p>
<p>So I went to my Mac, where there was no delay to unlock the account. However, unlocking didn’t work. It had me enter the password, texted a code to my phone, and then wanted me to enter the password again, but the sheet was broken. I typed the password and clicked <strong>Sign In</strong>, and the button stayed grayed out, showed a spinner, and then stopped, but it neither accepted the password nor showed an error. It just got stuck with <strong>Sign In</strong> disabled. Isn’t the new System Settings great?</p>
<p>(Several of the other Apple ID–related sheets have odd layouts and non-standard behavior. If I were not already familiar with this being the unfortunate status quo, I might worry whether they were fake UI trying to phish me.)</p>
<p>(The iPhone version of System Settings also got stuck in a weird state, where the <strong>Apple ID Suggestions</strong> screen was showing a spinner and a <strong>Continue</strong> button that didn’t work. And the whole app was inset with a black border around it. I had to force-quit it. And then it got stuck again the same way.)</p>
<p>The only thing to do was to click <strong>Cancel</strong> to get out of the sheet. Both of my devices kept popping up alerts about signing in to my Apple ID, and I still didn’t want to wait an hour, so I quit System Settings and relaunched it. I followed the exact same procedure as before to unlock my account, but this time it let me do so using my Mac’s password instead of sending a code to the iPhone. And this time the final sheet asking for my Apple ID password worked.</p>
<p>The good news is that the phone automatically unlocked and made the Apple ID services available again. I didn’t have to enter the new password there.</p>
<p>The bad news is that I had to choose <em>another</em> new password for this account. And everything about this process made me feel less secure. If Stolen Device Protection doesn’t work properly, is it going to cause me real trouble sometime? Maybe I should just turn it off. Is there any way I can run my devices <em>without</em> them relying on my Apple ID? Alas, I don’t think so.</p>
<p>(I have another Apple ID that I use on my test Macs, and for some reason it needs to be unlocked <em>every</em> time I use it to sign in to a new installation. I’ve never been asked to reset its password, though.)</p>

<p>There appears to be an increasingly widespread Apple ID outage of some sort impacting users tonight. A number of people on social media say that they were logged out of their Apple ID across multiple devices on Friday evening and forced to reset their password before logging back in…</p>



<h2 id="h-have-you-been-signed-out-of-your-apple-id">Have you been signed out of your Apple ID? </h2>



<p>We received our first tip about this around 8 p.m. ET. In the hours since then, the problem has gained significant traction on social media. </p>



<p>Apple’s <a href="https://www.apple.com/support/systemstatus/">System Status webpage</a> doesn’t indicate that any of its services are having issues this evening. Still, it’s clear based on social media reports that something wonky is going on behind the scenes at Apple. A few of us here at <em>9to5Mac</em> have also been directly affected by the problem. </p>



<p>People are being signed out of their Apple ID across all of their devices. If you try to sign in with your original Apple ID password, you’ll be locked out of your account. You’ll then be forced to reset your password before being able to sign back in. There doesn’t appear to be any rhyme or reason as to <em>why</em> this is happening. </p>



<p>Whether what’s happening on Friday evening has any relation to the <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/01/22/turn-on-iphone-stolen-device-protection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ongoing password reset attacks</a> problem that we’ve been tracking for several weeks is unclear right now. </p>



<p>Additionally, if you have<a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/01/22/turn-on-iphone-stolen-device-protection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Stolen Device Protection enabled</a>, being signed out of an Apple ID randomly can present an especially big headache if you’re away from a trusted location.</p>



<p>Another problem: if you reset your Apple ID password, <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102654" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">any app-specific passwords</a> you had previously set up via iCloud will be reset as well. </p>



<p>I’ve asked Apple for more information and will update if I hear anything back. Have you been signed out of your Apple ID on your devices tonight? Let us know down in the comments. </p>

            <pubDate>Sat, 27 Apr 2024 03:11:53 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/01/20/ipv4_nats_slow_ipv6_transition/">https://www.theregister.com/2022/01/20/ipv4_nats_slow_ipv6_transition/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40176804">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Carriers and Big Tech are happily continuing to use network address translation (NAT) and IPv4 to protect their investments, with the result that transition to IPv6 is glacial while the entire internet is shaped in the image of incumbent players.</p>
<p>That's the opinion of Geoff Huston, chief scientist at regional internet registry the Asia Pacific Network Information Centre (APNIC).</p>
<p>Huston's opinion was published in the conclusion to a <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.apnic.net/2022/01/19/ip-addressing-in-2021/">lengthy post</a> titled "IP addressing in 2021" that reports on IPv4 and IPv6 usage across last year.</p>

    

<p>The post offers very deep detail on adoption of both protocols during 2021. The headline news is that the small pool of available IPv4 addresses continued to dwindle, even as trading in addresses increased. IPv6 adoption, meanwhile, grew by just three per cent – and tellingly, no major player made the move to the newer protocol last year.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>The widespread use of NATs in IPv4 limits the technical substrate of the internet to a very restricted model of simple client/server interactions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But Huston thinks the raw data doesn't explain what's really happening. He argues the widespread use of NAT masks the fact that the internet is largely stuck on IPv4 because incumbents don't see the need to change.</p>
<p>Huston's post ponders what this all means for the future of the internet – and he doesn't like what he sees.</p>

        


        

<p>"We are witnessing an industry that is no longer using technical innovation, openness, and diversification as its primary means of propulsion," he writes.</p>
<p>"The widespread use of NATs in IPv4 limits the technical substrate of the internet to a very restricted model of simple client/server interactions using TCP and UDP. The use of NATs forces the interactions into client-initiated transactions, and the model of an open network with considerable communication flexibility is no longer being sustained in today's network.</p>

        

<p>"Incumbents are entrenching their position, and innovation and entrepreneurialism are taking a back seat while we sit out this protracted IPv4/IPv6 transition."</p>
<p>Those incumbents are large, and act in their own interests.</p>
<p>"Today's internet carriage service is provided by a smaller number of very large players, each of whom appears to be assuming a very strong position within their respective markets," Huston observes. "The drivers for such larger players tend towards risk aversion, conservatism, and increased levels of control across their scope of operation."</p>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/07/26/china_single_stack_ipv6_notice/">China sets goal of running single-stack IPv6 network by 2030, orders upgrade blitz</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/07/15/ipv6_istilli_510_years_away/">IPv6 <i>still</i> 5–10 years away from mainstream use, but K8s networking and multi-cloud are now real</a></li>
</ul>
<p>APNIC expressed similar concerns in December 2021, when a report jointly commissioned by Latin American internet registry LATNIC <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/12/09/study_on_the_internets_technical_success_factors/">suggested</a> that big tech's in-house networks carry a huge slice of global traffic, giving the likes of Google and Facebook enormous influence over internet architecture.</p>
<p>Huston expands on that theme in his post. "The evolving makeup of the internet industry has quite profound implications in terms of network neutrality, separation of carriage and service provision function, investment profiles, expectations of risk and return on infrastructure investments, and on the openness of the internet itself.</p>

        

<p>"Given the economies of volume in this industry, it was always going to be challenging to sustain an efficient, fully open, and competitive industry, but the degree of challenge in this agenda is multiplied many-fold when the underlying platform has run out of the basic currency of IP addresses," he writes.</p>
<p>"These days, we appear to be increasingly looking further afield for a regulatory and governance framework that can challenge the increasing complacency of the newly established incumbents," he laments, concluding with he perhaps grim observation that "It is unclear how successful we will be in this search." ®</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
            <p>Can you remember an Apple product unveiling that went as bad as the Vision Pro? The company known for the iPhone and the Mac had a big task: to convince people to stick a computer on their faces for hours on end, experience the world through cameras and screens, isolate themselves from anyone around them, and pay $3,500 for the privilege. The <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/tim-cook-apple-vision-pro?ref=disconnect.blog">awkward photos of Tim Cook</a> with the thing on his face in <em>Vanity Fair</em> certainly didn’t help convince people it was a future to embrace.</p><p>In the lead up to June 2023 unveiling, the <em>New York Times</em> reported on the internal dissent over the company’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/26/technology/apple-augmented-reality-dissent.html?ref=disconnect.blog">decision to release</a> the product and even <em>Bloomberg</em>’s Apple hype man Mark Gurman had to admit that Cook had <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2023-05-18/apple-s-mixed-reality-headset-may-define-tim-cook-s-legacy?ref=disconnect.blog">mismanaged the project</a>. There were plenty of reasons to believe it was going to be a dud, but there were still a sizeable number of people not willing to write off Apple’s next big thing. After all, this was Apple; one of the most valuable companies in the world that shaped personal computing with the Mac then led the mobile revolution with the iPhone. How could it get a major product release that it had poured $10 billion into so wrong? Its executives must’ve seen something us lowly consumers were missing.</p><p>In the days after the Vision Pro’s release in February, there was an initial wave of hype as the early adopters got their hands on it. Videos proliferated of people using it in cars, on streets, and in planes — mainly for views, but it still got the discourse flowing. Even some critics came up with bad justifications to get their hands on one. But that didn’t change the fact it was a bad product that imagined <a href="https://disconnect.blog/apples-vision-pro-headset-deserves/">an anti-social future</a> that other companies have tried and failed to foist on the public <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/virtual-reality-rich-white-kid-of-technology/?ref=disconnect.blog">many times before</a>. And in an all too rare moment, many tech reviewers agreed.</p><figure><a href="https://disconnect.blog/apples-vision-pro-headset-deserves/"><div><p>Apple’s Vision Pro headset deserves to be ridiculed</p><p>Tech companies want us isolated and constantly staring at screens because it drives profit</p><p><img src="https://disconnect.blog/content/images/size/w256h256/2024/01/disconnect_icon.png" alt=""><span>Disconnect</span><span>Paris Marx</span></p></div><p><img src="https://disconnect.blog/content/images/size/w1200/2024/01/4053f932-9f2c-4340-8631-0efc780b9d2f_2880x1616.png" alt=""></p></a></figure><p>While complimenting the theoretical possibilities the product offered, it was impossible to ignore the many drawbacks on everything from weight to eye strain and headaches to the fact the product just didn’t offer many compelling use cases. Joanna Stern at the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/apple-vision-pro-review-39f2d82e?ref=disconnect.blog">opined</a> that the Vision Pro was “the best mixed-reality headset I’ve ever tried,” but that companies like Apple know “these aren’t really the devices we want.” At <em>The Verge</em>, Nilay Patel was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24054862/apple-vision-pro-review-vr-ar-headset-features-price?ref=disconnect.blog">even more damning</a>, writing that the headset couldn’t “overcome the inherent nature of cameras and display” and “may have inadvertently revealed that some of these core ideas are actually dead ends.” In other words, the Vision Pro wasn’t a first step toward an augmented reality future but a moment to accept that vision would never be properly realized.</p><p>The concept of the Vision Pro might have excited some developers in an Apple lab in Cupertino, but most people are never going to use computers in the way those engineers and their managers imagined. Before the 14-day return window closed, there were plenty of reports of people heading back to the Apple store or popping their headsets back in the post to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/14/24072792/apple-vision-pro-early-adopters-returns?ref=disconnect.blog">get their money back</a>. They bought into the hype, they tried the new thing, and they ultimately realized it wasn’t worth it. That’s now being reflected in the sales numbers.</p><p>Apple initially had a sales target of <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2023-05-18/apple-s-mixed-reality-headset-may-define-tim-cook-s-legacy?ref=disconnect.blog">3 million Vision Pro units</a> in its first year, but slowly revised that number down to 900,000. When the product was released, estimates pegged <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-vision-pro-sold-2000000?ref=disconnect.blog">initial sales</a> at around 200,000 units, though it’s not clear how many of those were returned. Even people who kept their devices have recently been sharing on social media that they rarely use them anymore. It was no surprise on Tuesday when Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo reported Apple had <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/23/24138487/apple-vision-pro-cut-shipment-forecast-kuo-rumor?ref=disconnect.blog">slashed Vision Pro production</a> even before its international launch, expecting to sell as little as 400,000 units this year. Kuo also suggested a cheaper version had been pushed beyond 2025, if the company makes one at all.</p><figure><a href="https://disconnect.blog/apples-vision-pro-lacks-any-real-vision/"><div><p>Apple’s Vision Pro lacks any real vision</p><p>The company’s headset exists to placate investors, not serve users’ needs</p><p><img src="https://disconnect.blog/content/images/size/w256h256/2024/01/disconnect_icon.png" alt=""><span>Disconnect</span><span>Paris Marx</span></p></div><p><img src="https://disconnect.blog/content/images/size/w1200/2024/02/7oApHeXd2jbbkr5dPCEzN5.jpg" alt=""></p></a></figure><p>For some companies, selling 400,000 units would be a major achievement. But for a company like Apple that sells well over 200 million iPhones every year, along with tens of millions of Macs and iPads, it’s nowhere near the success they need it to be to justify the resources that went into it. And it’s looking ever more likely it will never get there.</p><h2 id="the-power-of-tech-criticism">The power of tech criticism</h2><p>The Vision Pro is just one in a long line of tech failures that includes everything from Juicero to the metaverse to the crypto financial system to the self-driving cars that were <a href="https://disconnect.blog/self-driving-cars-still-arent-the/" rel="noreferrer">supposed to be ubiquitous</a> by now. There’s no doubt the tech industry has upended many parts of our lives by getting us to adopt their digital technologies en masse — sometimes by choice; sometimes by force. But the times the industry was wrong are often overlooked in the narrative of tech’s supposed inevitability.</p><p>When a major tech company throws a new product into the world, it’s all too common that people immediately assume it’s something we must accept or even try to justify why it should exist (and succeed) regardless of how good it is. We’ve seen <a href="https://disconnect.blog/ai-wont-save-the-world/" rel="noreferrer">a lot</a> of <a href="https://disconnect.blog/dont-listen-to-the-godfather-of-ai/" rel="noreferrer">that</a> over the past year with generative AI. We’re told it’s here so we just need to adjust to it, instead of admitting we do have the collective power to choose how it’s used — if it should be at all.</p><p>Some of the tech industry’s failures were because the products sucked. Juicero was an expensive plastic box that squeezed a bag of juice and Theranos’ finger-prick blood tests were a big fraud that eventually sent its founder <a href="https://disconnect.blog/roundup-elizabeth-holmes-is-behind/">to prison for 11 years</a>. But crypto’s failure was a mixture of bad product and public opposition, while the metaverse was even more a rejection of a future where we would all be wearing headsets on our faces and socializing in virtual environments instead of with real people in meatspace. Like with Google Glass back in 2014, it was the <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/san-francisco-woman-says-she-was-attacked-for-wearing-google-glass/?ref=disconnect.blog" rel="noreferrer">public revulsion</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/ClvI9fZaz6M?ref=disconnect.blog" rel="noreferrer">open criticism</a> that helped defeat those visions tech had for our collective future.</p><p>This was put on display recently with the Humane Ai Pin, a dumb aluminium square that you stick on the front of your shirt, use to projects menus on your palm, and is, of course, powered by AI. The product was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24126502/humane-ai-pin-review?ref=disconnect.blog">roundly</a> <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-humane-ai-pin-is-the-solution-to-none-of-technologys-problems-120002469.html?ref=disconnect.blog">slammed</a> by reviewers when they finally put it through some real tests earlier this month, but that was after months of reporting that gave the product <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/humane-ai-pin-700-dollar-smartphone-alternative-wearable/?ref=disconnect.blog">the benefit of the doubt</a> and echoed its marketing line that it might ultimately be <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/humanes-wearable-ai-pin-hints-at-a-phone-free-future/?ref=disconnect.blog">a replacement for the smartphone</a>. Oddly enough, the tech bro backlash to the criticism centered on YouTuber Marques Brownlee, or MKBHD.</p><p>Brownlee called the Pin the “worst product I’ve ever reviewed… for now.” He did a deep dive on how poorly the product worked and explained that viewers shouldn’t buy into a product simply because of the vision of what it hopes to be in the future. He’s absolutely right about that. Former AWS engineer Daniel Vassallo was not happy about it though, writing on Twitter that he found it “<a href="https://twitter.com/dvassallo/status/1779753281960722706?ref=disconnect.blog">almost unethical</a>” because reviewers have a duty to “do no harm” — which absolutely is not the case. Reviewers have a duty to be honest with their viewers or readers, though that’s often tempered by a desire to maintain a good relationship with major tech firms.</p><figure><a href="https://disconnect.blog/kara-swishers-reality-distortion-field/"><div><p>Kara Swisher’s Reality Distortion Field</p><p>In “Burn Book,” the longtime tech journalist tries to rewrite her story for the post-techlash era</p><p><img src="https://disconnect.blog/content/images/size/w256h256/2024/01/disconnect_icon.png" alt=""><span>Disconnect</span><span>Paris Marx</span></p></div><p><img src="https://disconnect.blog/content/images/size/w1200/2024/02/burnbook-1.jpg" alt=""></p></a></figure><p>It’s funny that Brownlee was singled out in this case because he’s the kind of reviewer who will only slam a product if everyone else is going to do it too. He doesn’t often go hard on tech products and tends to give companies the benefit of the doubt, even when they don’t deserve it.</p><p>On the Vision Pro, for instance, he weighed the pros and cons while <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Gy035z_KA&amp;ref=disconnect.blog">spinning a narrative</a> that the product was indeed the future and was going to take off just like other Apple products before it. Meanwhile, the guy literally drives a Cybertruck and spends part of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0cs8aIXgkc&amp;ref=disconnect.blog">his review</a> of the monstrosity explaining away the problems with Tesla’s build quality and criticizing those who point to videos of Cybertrucks <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/tesla-cybertruck-gets-stuck-in-sand-18707997.php?ref=disconnect.blog" rel="noreferrer">stuck on a beach</a>, struggling with <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/cybertruck-stuck-on-hill-crashes-into-tree?ref=disconnect.blog" rel="noreferrer">going off road</a>, and <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2024/03/04/tesla-cybertruck-crash-beverly-hills-hotel-wheel-rip-off-elon/?ref=disconnect.blog" rel="noreferrer">crashing into hotel signs</a> in Beverly Hills for conflating driver error with vehicle deficiencies. The warning against buying into future visions expressed in the Humane Ai Pin review was nowhere to be found; he was all in on whatever future Apple or Tesla was ready to sell him.</p><h2 id="no-tech-is-inevitable">No tech is inevitable</h2><p>When Brownlee dismisses concerns with the Cybertruck or praises the future of what the Vision Pro <em>could be</em>, he’s not doing it because he’s being paid off by Apple or Tesla (though I think he certainly wants to keep his access to those companies). He does honestly believe what he’s saying, but his views are those of a tech booster. He wants to believe the narrative of tech inevitability, and he’s made a good career of echoing it to his followers — which is valuable to the tech companies he often features on his channel.</p><p>That narrative of inevitability is used to convince us we don’t have the power to challenge Silicon Valley and just need to accept whatever it throws at us. It might flow out of tech companies’ PR departments, but it’s echoed by well-connected journalists, influential tech publications, and even powerful political figures who effectively tell the public that resistance is futile and we must bow before our silicon overlords. But that’s clearly not true.</p><p>The Vision Pro and the Ai Pin are just the latest in a long line of tech failures, and they won’t be the last. We need to recognize that we have the collective power to challenge the industry, and no tech company or access journalist should be able to convince us otherwise. The only way we can hope to build a better future is by seizing that power and using it to rein in an industry that has already caused immense harm and is poised to do far more as it <a href="https://disconnect.blog/the-digital-revolution-has-failed/" rel="noreferrer">erodes the benefits</a> of its products to squeeze out a bit more profit for greedy shareholders.</p>

    <h2>Intro</h2>
<p>Let's do some thinking, shall we?</p>
<p>When I used to run a scraping service, I managed to scrape at most a couple of million Google SERPs per week. But I never ever purchased proxies from proxy providers such as <a href="https://brightdata.com/">Brightdata</a>, <a href="https://packetstream.io/">Packetstream</a> or <a href="https://oxylabs.io/">Oxylabs</a>.</p>
<p>Why? </p>
<p>Because I could not fully trust the other customers with whom I shared the proxy bandwidth. What if I share proxy servers with criminals that do more malicious stuff than the somewhat innocent SERP scraping?</p>
<p>Full disclosure: Non-DoS scraping of public information is okay for me. Ad-fraud, social media spam, web attacks such as automated SQL injections or XSS is not.</p>
<p>Furthermore, those proxy services are quite <em>pricey</em>, and me being a stingy German, I didn't possibly see a reasonable way for this combination to work out.</p>

  <figcaption>It had to be said.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>So how did I manage to scrape millions of Google SERP's?</p>
<p>I used <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/">AWS Lambda</a>, put Headless Chrome into an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/run-serverless-code/">AWS Lambda function</a> and used <a href="https://github.com/berstend/puppeteer-extra">puppeteer-extra</a> and <a href="https://github.com/alixaxel/chrome-aws-lambda">chrome-aws-lambda</a> to create a function that automatically launches a browser for 300 seconds that I can solely use for scraping.</p>
<p>Actually, I could have probably achieved the same with plain <code>curl</code>, because Google really doesn't put too much effort into blocking bots from their own search engine (they mostly rate limit by IP). But I needed a full browser for other projects, so there was that.</p>
<p>Anyhow, AWS gives you access to 16 regions all around the world (are they offering even more regions in the meantime?) and after three AWS Lambda function invocations, your function obtains a new public IP address. And if you concurrently invoke 1000 Lambda functions, you will bottom out at around 250 public IP addresses. And then you have 16 regions, which gives you around <code>16 * 250 = 4000</code> public IP addresses at any time when using AWS Lambda. This was enough to be able to scrape millions of Google SERPs / week, even when sharing public datacenter IP addresses.</p>
<p>I tried the same with <a href="https://cloud.google.com/">Google Cloud Platform</a>, but funnily enough, Google blocks their own cloud infrastructure much more aggressively compared to traffic from AWS.</p>
<p>(This was all in 2019 and 2020, things possibly changed)</p>
<p><strong>But I digress.</strong></p>
<p>The above setup is not good. It will work for scraping Google / Bing / Amazon, because they <em>want</em> to be scraped to a certain extent.</p>
<p>But it will never work against well protected websites that employ protection from anti bot companies such as <a href="https://datadome.co/">DataDome</a>, <a href="https://www.akamai.com/">Akamai</a> or <a href="https://www.imperva.com/">Imperva</a> (there are more anti bot companies, don't be salty when I didn't name you, okay?).</p>
<p>Those companies employ ill-adjusted individuals that do nothing else than look for the most recent techniques to fingerprint browsers, find out if a browser <a href="https://github.com/abrahamjuliot/creepjs">lies about it's own configuration</a> or exhibits artifacts that don't pertain to a humanly controlled browser. When normal people are out drinking beers in the pub on Friday night, these individuals invent increasingly bizarre ways to fingerprint browsers and detect bots ;)</p>

<li>...</li>
</ol>
<p>I kid you not, there are millions of different ways to detect if a browser is being controlled by a bot or not. It's insanely complex and almost all bot architectures are to a degree vulnerable to detection.</p>
<p>Maybe I am just not a good enough bot developer myself, but I think it's harder to create a good bot than to detect a bot. The real problem for anti bot companies is to reduce the false positive rate, not detecting most bots.</p>
<p>The main reason that makes bots prone to detection is simple economics: In order to scrape millions of pages, bot programmers put their browsers into docker containers and orchestrate them with docker swarm. Others use Kubernetes to orchestrate scraping clusters. And of course they will use cloud providers such as Hetzner, AWS or Digitalocean to host their bots. Nobody uses their MacBook Pro to run 20 Chrome Docker images over night. </p>
<p>The above described architecture is highly non-humanlike. What sane human being is browsing Instagram from within a docker container on a Hetzner VPS?!</p>
<p>Let's propose a scraping architecture that is not that easily detectable.</p>
<h2>An undetectable and scalable scraping infrastructure</h2>
<p>First let's proclaim the two laws of successful scraping: </p>
<ol>
<li>The second most important rule about evading anti bot companies is: <strong>You shall not lie about your browser configuration</strong>.</li>
<li>And the most important rule is: <strong>You shall only lie about your browser configuration if nobody catches you</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Because I am not that good at reverse engineering those <a href="https://incolumitas.com/data/imperva.js">heavily obfuscated fingerprinting libraries</a> from anti bot companies, my suggestion is to just use real devices for scraping.</p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://incolumitas.com/images/shelf_closeup_790x.jpg" alt="phones man">
  <figcaption>Device Farm (Source: https://github.com/DeviceFarmer/stf)</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>If I would try to create a <em>undetectable</em> scraping service, I would probably buy 500 <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-phone-under-100/">cheap Android devices</a> (Starting at 58$ per device), maybe from 5 different manufacturers. We want diversity after all for fingerprinting reasons! You can also buy old (but more powerful) Android devices. If you buy 100 devices at once, you'll get a massive discount. </p>
<p>Then I would buy cheap data plans for the devices and I would control the devices with <a href="https://github.com/DeviceFarmer/stf">DeviceFarmer/stf</a> and rent some cheap storage space (With a mobile cellular antenna closeby) in five top major cities of the world such as London, Paris, Boston, Frankfurt and Los Angeles and put 100 phones in there each.</p>
<p>Then I install the lightweight Android Go on each device, throw out everything unnecessary that bloats my device and then plug it into a power source. Every 5 minutes I turn on/off airplane mode so my phone gets another IP address from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier-grade_NAT">4G carrier grade NAT</a>.</p>
<p>Mobile IP addresses (4G, 5G, LTE) are practically un-bannable, because they are shared by up to hundred thousands of legitimate users in major cities. Instagram will never dare to ban 200.000 people in LA just because of some pesky spammers use the same IP! When Carrier Grade NATs were designed, <a href="https://www.ofcom.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0020/37802/cgnat.pdf">the designers knew about this issue</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the event that an IPv4 address is blocked or blacklisted as a source of spam, the impact on a
CGN would be greater, potentially affecting an entire subscriber base. This would increase cost
and support load for the ISP, and, as we have seen earlier, damage its IP reputation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Do you think IPv6 comes to a rescue? Think again! Most anti bot companies give little to no IP reputation to IPv6 addresses, because the address space is so insanely vast.</p>
<p>One problem with the setup described above is that I will need to spoof those pesky <code>deviceorientation</code> and <code>devicemotion</code> <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/Detecting_device_orientation">JavaScript events</a> on a kernel level, because no real device is laying on the ground without rotation/movement all day long. Every website can access rotation and velocity data from Android data without asking for permission. So we have to spoof that.</p>
<p>But apart from that, I cannot see a way how bot detection systems are going to block this scraping infrastructure.</p>
<p>Of course the downsides are apparent: </p>
<ol>
<li>I have to buy 500 Android devices. I own already three of those things, I would go ballistic with 500 of them.</li>
<li>I need to rent storage space in major cities. That's expensive.</li>
<li>I need people in 5 cities to fix problems in the device farms.</li>
<li>I have to deal with hardware. I hate that. It causes problems non stop.</li>
</ol>
<p>So that would be a larger project, probably costing thousands of dollars in maintenance.</p>
<h3>Improvement: Emulate Android</h3>
<p>Instead of buying real Android devices, it would be better to emulate Android devices with Android emulators such as </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.android-x86.org/documentation/virtualbox.html">Android-x86 on VirtualBox</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.bluestacks.com/de/index.html">bluestacks</a></li>
<li>Or the <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator">Android Studio Emulator</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Obviously, here we play with the devil again because we want to cut costs!</p>
<p>How are those pesky anti bot companies going to find out that we are emulating Android devices?</p>
<ol>
<li>An idea is to use browser based red pills that reveal that the browser is running in an emulated environment</li>
<li>Maybe they will launch <a href="https://incolumitas.com/2021/01/10/browser-based-port-scanning/">browser based port scans</a> against well known ports that are only running on emulated Android devices (such as <code>adb</code> service)?</li>
<li>Maybe Google sets some device wide <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/6048248?hl=en">advertisement ID's</a> on each mobile device? If this ID is missing or always stays the same, it could be a sign of suspicion.</li>
<li>Every website can find out whether you are logged into a Gmail or YouTube account with <a href="https://browserleaks.com/social">Social Media Login Detection</a>. No logged in Google account on Android equals suspicion!</li>
<li>There are probably 1000 more techniques that can be used to detect emulated Android devices</li>
</ol>
<p>Most likely, the Android emulators are imperfect and this imperfection is exhibited over the massive JavaScript API that each mobile browser offers to every website.</p>
<p>I am absolutely in favour of the emulation approach. This would mean that we only have to own several powerful servers, plug <a href="https://proxidize.com/">4G dongles into them</a> and we are ready to go. It could look like this (The image is taken from <a href="https://proxidize.com/">proxidize.com</a>): </p>
<figure>

  <figcaption>A couple of 4G dongles that I use for my personal E-Mail checking and writing Whatsapp messages (Source: https://proxidize.com/gallery/)</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>What <a href="https://proxidize.com/">proxidize.com</a> is doing is offering 4G mobile proxies. I don't want proxies, because <a href="https://bot.incolumitas.com/proxy_detect.html">proxies are detectable by itself</a>. I want to directly use the 4G dongle from the Android emulator! No latency due to geographical discrepancy between Android emulator and proxy.</p>
<p>So in the end, the scraping infrastructure could look like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Install one powerful scraping server with 50 4G dongles connected to it in one geographical location</li>
<li>For each scraping server, run 50-100 emulated Android devices.</li>
<li>Put this scraping station in 5 major cities.</li>
<li>A simple command &amp; control server orchestrates the 5 scraping stations.</li>
<li>Profit.</li>
</ol>

<p>The odds of contracting Lyme disease from tick bites during warmer weather months <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/datasurveillance/surveillance-data.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Flyme%2Fstats%2Ftables.html">continue to rise</a>. That’s owing to a series of factors, including changes in climate conducive to maintenance of tick populations over a longer period of time and the expansion of range for the parasites south and west from historically high-risk areas in the Northeast and Upper Midwest, according to the <a href="https://capcvet.org/articles/2023-annual-pet-parasite-forecasts/">Companion Animal Parasite Council.</a> &nbsp;To give readers a refresher in ways to avoid contracting Lyme disease the Gazette spoke with <a href="https://physiciandirectory.brighamandwomens.org/details/1369/nancy-shadick-rheumatology-boston">Nancy Shadick</a>, a rheumatologist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and a clinical epidemiologist who has researched the malady since the 1990s. This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>In the last five to 10 years, have you seen Lyme disease rates increasing?</strong></p>



<p>Lyme disease is still the most common vector-borne illness. It continues to spread in endemic areas such as the upper Midwest and the Northeast, but it has also spread down into the mid-Atlantic region and upward into the upper Northeast. With climate change and warmer temperatures, one example is that Lyme disease is now spreading up into Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine.</p>



<p><strong>Is climate change the main reason we’re seeing an increase?</strong></p>



<p>There is also increased general awareness and reporting. The CDC is now reporting both confirmed and probable Lyme disease cases, for example.</p>



<p><strong>There are certain geographic areas of the country that are considered high-risk. What are other factors that might cause an area to be high-risk?</strong></p>



<p>Areas that are wooded or have dense foliage — suburban or rural — tend to have more Lyme disease cases. Ticks live in wooded areas and brush. So you won’t get it in an urban area, for example, where there’s little greenery. Golf courses can be risky. When golfers hit a golf ball into the brush, they leave the highly manicured golf course and go into the brush, which could be an area where there are a lot of ticks. The presence of whitetail deer is another indicator that there might be Lyme disease, or small mammals such as white-footed mice, which can be carriers.</p>



<p><strong>And are all ticks bad? Or is it specifically deer ticks?</strong></p>



<p>Lyme disease is transmitted by the deer tick, also known as the blacklegged tick. Other ticks, such as dog ticks, can transmit other illnesses, but not Lyme disease.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“If not caught early, Lyme disease can progress to facial paralysis, arthritis, meningitis, or inflammation of the heart called carditis that can cause rhythm abnormalities.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p><strong>GAZETTE:&nbsp;Who is at most risk of infection?</strong></p>



<p>In general there is a bimodal age distribution of Lyme disease with children aged 5 to 9 most highly affected. Additionally, there has been an increasing male predominance of the illness. The incidence rate ratios of males over females in most age groups were 39 to 89 percent higher for the time period of 1992 to 2016.</p>



<p><strong>And what about pets? Are they at risk of carrying Lyme disease, or getting it themselves?</strong></p>



<p>Yes, pets can bring ticks into the house. For example, if your dog is out running in the woods, comes inside and sits on the furniture or sleeps in the bed with you, it does increase your likelihood of getting a tick bite. And a dog can contract Lyme disease, although they have certain protections that we don’t have yet, like vaccination. Dogs can be vaccinated, and many dogs take a tick and flea treatment that prevents them from getting tick bites.</p>



<p><strong>If I’m someone who is outdoors a lot in the summer, what are things that I can do to protect myself?</strong></p>



<p>Be aware of your environment. When you hike, stay on the trail. You should tick-proof your clothing by wearing a repellent containing DEET. There are other repellents that contain more natural repellents — like lemon oil or eucalyptus — but those are not as effective at repelling ticks. If you can, wear light-colored clothing, so you can identify the tick more easily. Wear long pants and tuck them into your socks. And then the most important thing that you should do is every time you’re out in potential tick-laden areas, you should do a tick check. In general it takes 36 hours for a tick to infect you, so if you check for ticks that evening, you can feel pretty confident that you haven’t been bitten. Ticks like humid, warm areas to bite, so check all parts of your body, especially folds in your skin like your elbows, behind your knees, or on your neck.</p>

<p><strong>What are symptoms of Lyme disease?</strong></p>



<p>Early symptoms include the classic <em>erythema migrans</em> rash, which is a red, ring-like rash that spreads. This can develop within days or weeks, and sometimes a rash won’t occur at all. You can also experience a flu-like illness with a fever, headache, and achy joints. If not caught early, Lyme disease can progress to facial paralysis,&nbsp;arthritis, meningitis, or inflammation of the heart called carditis that can cause rhythm abnormalities. If you suspect Lyme disease, it’s important to seek treatment. The best way to recover quickly is to take antibiotics as soon as you can.</p>



<p><strong>In terms of research, are we making progress either in prevention or treatment of Lyme disease-related ailments?</strong></p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-valneva-initiate-phase-3-study-lyme-disease">Lyme disease vaccine from Pfizer and Valneva</a> is in a Phase 3 trial right now. We’re hopeful that the vaccine will be ready in 2025. The UMass Chan Medical School is also studying another potential therapy <a href="https://www.umassmed.edu/news/news-archives/2021/02/preventative-shot-for-lyme-disease-developed-at-umass-medical-school-enters-clinical-trial/">to prevent Lyme disease</a> that is in clinical trials. This prevention is not a vaccine but a monoclonal antibody that kills the Lyme bacteria in the tick’s gut.</p>



<p><strong>Practically speaking, are there any resources or sites that you would recommend for people to learn more about Lyme disease and the risk it poses in their area?</strong></p>



<p>There is a <a href="https://lyme.health.harvard.edu/">Harvard Health Lyme Wellness website</a> that offers a lot of educational information. The CDC also has an excellent website for the general public and has a tick-borne illness <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ticks/tickbornediseases/index.html">reference manual for clinicians</a>. Each state department of health typically has tick borne illness information and monthly reports on the illness.</p>	<!-- wp:harvard-gazette/supporting-content {"align":"right"} -->

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="article-body">
<p><span>In some parts of France, </span>World War I has never ended. These are the <em>Zones rouges</em>—an archipelago of former battlegrounds so pockmarked and polluted by war that, more than a century after the end of hostilities, they remain unfit to live or even farm on.</p>
<p>WWI was the first industrial war and a laboratory for all kinds of military innovations, including the first use of tanks and poison gas. Both the German and the Allied war machines belched out deadly explosives and lethal chemicals on a massive scale. It is estimated that around 60 million shells rained down near Verdun during the fierce battles over that city in 1916—of which 15 million didn’t explode upon impact.</p>
<p>Four years of war stripped a zone on either side of the largely immobile frontline of any sign of life. Roads and bridges, canals and railways were destroyed. Cities were pummeled into dust. Entire villages “died for France” and were wiped off the map for good.</p>

<p>Bombardments were so thorough that even grass and trees disappeared. When the war ended in November 1918, a large swathe of northern to eastern France was so cratered up and chewed out that it looked like a moonscape. In all, about 7 percent of French territory was destroyed during the war, in a zone stretching over 4,000 municipalities across 13 departments, from the Nord at the coast to the Bas-Rhin on the Swiss border.</p>
<p>By 1919, the French Ministry for the Liberated Territories had divided the afflicted areas into three zones, depending on the degree of destruction:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">
<em>Zones vertes</em> (“Green Zones”), with minimal damage;</li>
<li aria-level="1">
<em>Zones jaunes</em> (“Yellow Zones”), with heavy but limited damage; and</li>
<li aria-level="1">
<em>Zones rouges</em> (“Red Zones”), usually closest to the former front lines, which were completely destroyed.</li>
</ul>
<p>The primary task was to clear the affected areas of ammunition and corpses. This involved the efforts of German PoWs, foreign workers from as far afield as China, and Quaker volunteers, among others.</p>
<p>Massive amounts of unidentified human remains were gathered in places like the Douaumont Ossuary, the last resting place of 130,000 German and French soldiers who fell at Verdun. Soldier bones continue to turn up. As recently as April 2012, authorities were able to identify the remains of a French soldier named Albert Dadure.</p>

<p>The green and yellow zones were returned to civilian use relatively early. The red zones were different. They were, in the words of one official post-war report, “completely devastated. Damage to properties: 100%. Damage to agriculture: 100%. Impossible to clean. Human life impossible.” Red zones were cleared only superficially, and mostly just closed off.</p>
<p>In 1919, these red zones covered around 690 square miles (1,800 kilometers squared). Here, the ground remained saturated with unexploded ordnance. High concentrations of heavy metals and chemicals in the soil further increased the risk to life and limb. For reasons of safety and sanitation, these areas were strictly off-limits for housing, farming, and even forestry.</p>
<p>By 1927, the red zones had been reduced by 70 percent to around 190 square miles (490 kilometers squared), in part due to pressure from local farmers, who wanted to return their fields and pastures to productivity and profit.</p>
<p>Today, the red zone archipelago has shrunk to about 40 square miles (100 kilometers squared), about the size of Paris. Yet it’s unlikely that these islands will disappear soon. They are the most tenacious residue of a long-lasting environmental problem.</p>
<p>Each year, farmers in former red zones plough up an “iron harvest” of close to 900 tons of unexploded ordnance. Near Verdun, road signs point to dumping grounds where they can leave these shells for the authorities to collect.</p>
<p>France’s <em>Sécurité Civile</em>, which is charged with removing them, estimates that at current rates, it could take up to 700 years to completely clear all remaining WWI shells and grenades from France’s soil.</p>

<p>And then there are the gases, acids, and other chemicals polluting the soil—in some parts, the ground still contains so much arsenic that nothing will grow. In less affected areas, biologists still note the lack of floral and faunal diversity related to the pollution, which some estimate may take about 10,000 years to clear.</p>
<p>WWI was supposed to be the “War to End All War.” That went… less well than could have been hoped for. One of the lessons not learned from that conflict is that modern wars have long-lasting impacts on health and the environment. The issue has remained largely dormant, resurfacing only in the 1990s, when more than one in three U.S. veterans of the First Gulf War reported a range of symptoms ascribed to exposure to toxic substances.</p>
<p>Even in France itself, not much thought is given to the lingering effects of WWI, or to the remaining Zones rouges—perhaps because so much of the affected areas were left to the trees, becoming so-called forêts de guerre (war forests), notably in the Champagne region. Yet the invisible environmental legacy of the Great War has very real consequences.</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">In 2012, the consumption of locally sourced drinking water was prohibited in 544 municipalities, due to high levels of perchlorate, which was used to make WWI ammo. All of those municipalities are located close to former battlefield zones.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Experts warn that mushrooms, game meat, and even food cooked over wood collected in red zones or former red zones might be a source of toxins.</li>
<li aria-level="1">It has been established that the livers of wild boars roaming the forests around Verdun contain abnormally high levels of lead.</li>
<li aria-level="1">And the relatively elevated levels of lead in certain French wines may result from the wood of the barrels in which they matured, from oak harvested in former red zones.</li>

<p dir="auto">Official code base for the paper titled <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14083" rel="nofollow"><em>Beyond A*: Better Planning with Transformers via Search Dynamics Bootstrapping</em></a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">This repository contians code for accessing the generated datasets and trained models, re-producing the figures of the main paper, and the code used for running the presented experiments.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Overview</h2><a id="user-content-overview" aria-label="Permalink: Overview" href="#overview"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">All code is designed around storing and transforming datasets stored in a MongoDB instance.
The <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/searchformer/blob/main/notebook"><code>notebook</code></a> folder contains Jupyer notebooks with examples demonstrating how to access token dataset and prompting a trained Searchformer model.
This folder also contains notebooks that read data from MongoDB to generate all figures included in the main paper.</p>
<p dir="auto">The <code>searchformer</code> module contains all code used in the presented experiments.
Please refer to the documentation in the folder <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/searchformer/blob/main/doc"><code>doc</code></a> for using this module to train models, evaluate them, and generate training datasets.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Setup and installation</h2><a id="user-content-setup-and-installation" aria-label="Permalink: Setup and installation" href="#setup-and-installation"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">This code base uses <code>python=3.10</code>.
To run python code and the included Jupyer notebooks, a virtual environment can be created using the included <code>requirements.txt</code> file.
For example, this virtual environment can be created with</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ python3.10 -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
(venv) $ pip install -r requirements.txt "><pre><code>$ python3.10 -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
(venv) $ pip install -r requirements.txt 
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">For the code to run correctly, a MongoDB instance needs to be setup.
This code base is designed to work with <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community" rel="nofollow">MongoDB Community Edition</a> and connects by default directly to <code>mongodb://localhost:27017/mongo</code> without any user authentication setup.
For example, to explore the included token datasets and checkpoints, a MonogDB instance could be installed locally in a laptop and this code base can be used to access a MongoDB instance running on <code>localhost</code>.
To direct the <code>searchformer</code> module to connect to a different MongoDB instance, the default MongoDB URI can be overwritten by setting the environment variable</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="export MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/mongo"><pre><code>export MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/mongo
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">before running any python code.
The code segment used for connecting to MongoDB can be found in <code>searchformer.utils</code> in function <code>mongodb_client</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">To import the released datasets the command line tool <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/database-tools/mongorestore/" rel="nofollow"><code>mongorestore</code></a> is used.
Instructions for downloading and installing MongoDB Database Tools can be found <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/database-tools/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>As a convention, all commands are run from this repository's root directory and not from any sub-directory. The root directory is the directory that contains this README file.</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">For example, a correct setup of the python environment can be tested by running the following from the repositories root directory:</p>

<p>A federal appeals court today reversed a ruling that prevented New York from enforcing a law requiring Internet service providers to sell $15 broadband plans to low-income consumers. The <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ca2.55129/gov.uscourts.ca2.55129.232.0.pdf">ruling</a> is a loss for six trade groups that represent ISPs, although it isn't clear right now whether the law will be enforced.</p>
<p>New York's Affordable Broadband Act (ABA) was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/06/ny-cant-force-isps-to-offer-15-low-income-broadband-plans-judge-rules/">blocked</a> in June 2021 by a US District Court judge who ruled that the state law is rate regulation and preempted by federal law. Today, the US Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit reversed the ruling and vacated the permanent injunction that barred enforcement of the state law.</p>
<p>For consumers who qualify for means-tested government benefits, the state law requires ISPs to offer "broadband at no more than $15 per month for service of 25Mbps, or $20 per month for high-speed service of 200Mbps," the ruling noted. The law allows for price increases every few years and makes exemptions available to ISPs with fewer than 20,000 customers.</p>
<p>"First, the ABA is not field-preempted by the Communications Act of 1934 (as amended by the Telecommunications Act of 1996), because the Act does not establish a framework of rate regulation that is sufficiently comprehensive to imply that Congress intended to exclude the states from entering the field," a panel of appeals court judges stated in a 2-1 opinion.</p>
<p>Trade groups claimed the state law is preempted by former Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai's repeal of net neutrality rules. Pai's repeal placed ISPs under the more forgiving Title I regulatory framework instead of the common-carrier framework in Title II of the Communications Act.</p>
<p>2nd Circuit judges did not find this argument convincing:</p>
<blockquote><p>Second, the ABA is not conflict-preempted by the Federal Communications Commission's 2018 order classifying broadband as an information service. That order stripped the agency of its authority to regulate the rates charged for broadband Internet, and a federal agency cannot exclude states from regulating in an area where the agency itself lacks regulatory authority. Accordingly, we REVERSE the judgment of the district court and VACATE the permanent injunction.</p></blockquote>
<h2>                                            
                                                        </h2>
<h2>Be careful what you lobby for</h2>
<p>The judges' reasoning is similar to what a different appeals court said in 2019 when it <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/10/net-neutrality-still-dead-but-judges-rule-that-fcc-cant-preempt-state-laws/">rejected Pai's attempt</a> to preempt all state net neutrality laws. In that case, the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit said that "in any area where the Commission lacks the authority to regulate, it equally lacks the power to preempt state law." In a related case, ISPs were <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/04/isps-cant-find-any-judges-who-will-block-california-net-neutrality-law/">unable to block</a> a California net neutrality law.</p>
<p>Several of the trade groups that sued New York "vociferously lobbied the FCC to classify broadband Internet as a Title I service in order to prevent the FCC from having the authority to regulate them," today's 2nd Circuit ruling said. "At that time, Supreme Court precedent was already clear that when a federal agency lacks the power to regulate, it also lacks the power to preempt. The Plaintiffs now ask us to save them from the foreseeable legal consequences of their own strategic decisions. We cannot."</p>
<p>Judges noted that there are several options for ISPs to try to avoid regulation:</p>
<blockquote><p>If they believe a requirement to provide Internet to low-income families at a reduced price is unfair or misguided, they have several pathways available to them. They could take it up with the New York State Legislature. They could ask Congress to change the scope of the FCC's Title I authority under the Communications Act. They could ask the FCC to revisit its classification decision, as it has done several times before But they cannot ask this Court to distort well-established principles of administrative law and federalism to strike down a state law they do not like.</p></blockquote>
<p>Coincidentally, the 2nd Circuit issued its opinion one day after current FCC leadership <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/04/fcc-restores-net-neutrality-rules-that-ban-blocking-and-throttling-in-3-2-vote/">reclassified</a> broadband again in order to restore net neutrality rules. ISPs might now have a better case for preempting the New York law. The FCC itself won't necessarily try to preempt New York's law, but the agency's <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-401676A1.pdf">net neutrality order</a> does specifically reject rate regulation at the federal level.</p>

        <p>
  Hello,<br>
  welcome once again to the world of facts.
</p>

<hr>
<h3>Statistics<author>Klonan</author></h3>

<p>
  Do you love watching your production graphs grow as much as we do?
</p>

<h4>Accumulator graph</h4>

<p>
  It is a little bit tricky when you transition from Steam power to Solar panels and Accumulators, to know if you have enough capacity in the system to survive the cold dark nights. Generally you might just wait until nighttime and see if your factory blacksout, if so, build more solar and accumulators.
</p>

<p>
  It would be helpful and convenient to see the statistics of accumulator charge levels, so we added such information:
</p>

<p>
  <a href="https://cdn.factorio.com/assets/blog-sync/fff-408-accumulator-graph.png" target="_blank">
    <img src="https://cdn.factorio.com/assets/blog-sync/fff-408-accumulator-graph.png" alt="Accumulator graph">
  </a>
</p>

<p>
  The main reason it was more critical, was that on Fulgora the production from lightning at nighttime is much less predictable, so it is much more important to see the timeline of the accumulator charge.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="https://cdn.factorio.com/assets/blog-sync/fff-408-fulgora-graph.png" target="_blank">
    <img src="https://cdn.factorio.com/assets/blog-sync/fff-408-fulgora-graph.png" alt="Fulgora graph">
  </a>
</p>

<h4>Science graph</h4>

<p>
  You can track science pack consumption in the production GUI, but that does not account for things like productivity modules and the new research productivity technologies.
</p>

<p>
  So we added a new special item in the production statistics, that shows the total final 'Science' that is produced.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="https://cdn.factorio.com/assets/blog-sync/fff-408-science-graph.png" target="_blank">
    <img src="https://cdn.factorio.com/assets/blog-sync/fff-408-science-graph.png" alt="Science graph">
  </a>
</p>

<h4>Per surface production</h4>

<p>
  It was tolerable in the first days of playtesting with planets and platforms that all the production statistics were global. However when you want to get more and more precise with your gameplay and trying optimize each part, it becomes quite necessary.
</p>

<p>
  For instance on platforms, we need to know if we are producing enough fuel and ammo to keep the ride going:
</p>

<p>
  <a href="https://cdn.factorio.com/assets/blog-sync/fff-408-platform-graph.png" target="_blank">
    <img src="https://cdn.factorio.com/assets/blog-sync/fff-408-platform-graph.png" alt="Platform graph">
  </a>
</p>

<p>
  And its super helpful when checking if a specific planet producing enough when some items are crafted in many places.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="https://cdn.factorio.com/assets/blog-sync/fff-408-vulcanus-graph.png" target="_blank">
    <img src="https://cdn.factorio.com/assets/blog-sync/fff-408-vulcanus-graph.png" alt="Vulcanus graph">
  </a>
</p>

<p>
  We also added a checkbox to switch to a 'Global statistics' view, so all the possibilities are available for the player.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="https://cdn.factorio.com/assets/blog-sync/fff-408-global-graph.png" target="_blank">
    <img src="https://cdn.factorio.com/assets/blog-sync/fff-408-global-graph.png" alt="Global graph">
  </a>
</p>

<h4>Quality graph</h4>

<p>
  Going deeper still, we want to dissect our production by what quality the produced items are.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="https://cdn.factorio.com/assets/blog-sync/fff-408-quality-graph.png" target="_blank">
    <img src="https://cdn.factorio.com/assets/blog-sync/fff-408-quality-graph.png" alt="Quality graph">
  </a>
</p>

<p>
  So what do you think? Are there any other statistics improvements you can think about for 2.0?
</p>

<h3>Linux adventures<author>raiguard</author></h3>
<p>
  I have appeared in a few FFFs by now but I have never formally introduced myself. My name is raiguard. I have been playing Factorio since June 2017, making mods for the game since the 0.17 release in March 2019, and I finally joined Wube in March 2023.
  My primary roles at the company are expansion programming and Linux support, as well as being an advocate for the modding community.
  I have been daily-driving Linux for multiple years and have fallen ever deeper into the black hole of customization and minimalism.
</p>
<p>
  "Why don't most games support macOS and Linux?" is a sentiment I often see echoed across the internet.
  Supporting a new platform is a lot more than just changing some flags and hitting compile.
  Windows, macOS, Linux, and the Nintendo Switch all use different compilers, different implementations of the C++ standard library, and have different implementation quirks, bugs, and features.
  You need to set up CI for the new platform, expand your build system to support the new compiler(s) and architecture(s), and have at least one person on the team that cares enough about the platform to actively maintain it.
  If you are a video game, you will likely need to add support for another graphics backend (Vulkan or OpenGL) as well, since DirectX is Windows-exclusive.
</p>
<p>
  Many developers will take one look at the <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/desktop/worldwide">Windows market share</a> and decide that it is not worth the trouble to support other platforms.
  Also, with the meteoric rise of the Steam Deck and Proton, it is easier than ever for game developers to ignore Linux support because Valve does some black magic that lets their game run anyway.
</p>
<p>
  Factorio supports macOS and Linux so well because there has always been someone at Wube who actively uses these platforms and is willing to take on the burden of supporting it.
  Our native <a href="https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-371">Apple Silicon</a> support is a great example of this.
  Today, I will take you through some of the adventures I've had with maintaining Factorio's Linux support.
</p>

<h4>Wayland</h4>
<p>
  My first self-appointed task after joining the team was to add <a href="https://wayland.freedesktop.org/">Wayland</a> support to the game.
  Wayland is a new display protocol that has been in development to replace the antiquated and insecure <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System">X11</a> system.
  Modern Linux distributions are beginning to switch to Wayland as default, so supporting it in Factorio is paramount.
</p>
<p>
  We utilize the <a href="https://www.libsdl.org/">SDL</a> library which neatly handles most low-level system interactions and abstracts them into a common interface.
  SDL has support for Wayland, so all that I theoretically needed to do was build SDL with Wayland enabled and it would "just work."
  However, it's not quite a simple plug-and-play. Wayland provides "protocols" in the form of XML files that you then use the <code>wayland-scanner</code> binary to convert into C program and header files.
</p>
<p>
  Being relatively new to C++ at the time, my initial solution was convoluted and involved checking the generated Wayland protocols into our source tree, to be manually regenerated every time we updated SDL.
  A few months ago, armed with a years' worth of experience, I improved this workflow to automatically generate the files as a part of the build process, so they are always up-to-date with the protocol XML files that SDL ships with.
</p>
<p>
  Factorio has supported Wayland since 1.1.77, but it needs to be explicitly enabled by setting <code>SDL_VIDEODRIVER=wayland</code> in your environment.
  For Factorio 2.0 I added a dropdown to select your preference in the GUI:
</p>

<div>
  <p><img alt="X11" title="X11" src="https://cdn.factorio.com/assets/blog-sync/fff-408-x11.png">
    <img alt="Wayland" title="Wayland" src="https://cdn.factorio.com/assets/blog-sync/fff-408-wayland.png">
  </p>
</div>

<p>
  <i>
    X11 (left) vs. Wayland (right) with the desktop display scale set to 125%.
    <br>Notice how the game renders at the display's native resolution when running under Wayland.
  </i>
</p>

<h4>Client-side window decorations</h4>
<p>
  Once Wayland support was implemented, I received a <a href="https://forums.factorio.com/105512">bug report</a> that the window was missing a titlebar and close buttons (called "window decorations") when running on <a href="https://www.gnome.org/">GNOME</a>.
  Most desktop environments will allow windows to supply their own decorations if they wish but will provide a default implementation on the server side as an alternative.
  GNOME, in their infinite wisdom, have decided that all clients <i>must</i> provide their own decorations, and if a client does not, they will simply be missing.
  I disagree with this decision; Factorio does not need to provide decorations on any other platform, nay, on any other desktop environment, but GNOME can (ab)use its popularity to force programs to conform to its idiosyncrasies or be left behind.
</p>
<p>
  To fix this, I had to bring in another dependency, <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/libdecor/libdecor">libdecor</a>.
  It functions, and SDL even has support for it, but a video game shouldn't have to supply window decorations in the first place.
</p>

<p>
  <img src="https://cdn.factorio.com/assets/blog-sync/fff-408-decorations.png">
  <br>
  The game has decorations now, but the theme doesn't match. Thanks GNOME!
</p>

<h4>Window resizing seizures</h4>
<p>
  A video is worth more than a thousand words:
</p>

<p>
  <video controls="" muted="" playsinline="">
    <source src="https://cdn.factorio.com/assets/blog-sync/fff-408-seizure.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    Mp4 playback not supported on your device.
  </video>
  <b>PHOTOSENSITIVITY WARNING:</b> Rapid flashing images.
</p>

<p>
  I use the <a href="https://swaywm.org/">Sway</a> window manager, and a particularity of this window manager is that it will automatically resize floating windows to the size of their last submitted frame.
  This has unveiled an issue with our graphics stack: it takes the game three frames to properly respond to a window resize.
  The result is a rapid tug-of-war, with Sway sending a ton of resize events and Factorio responding with outdated framebuffer sizes, causing the chaos captured above.
</p>

<p>
  I spent two full days staring at our graphics code but could not come up with an explanation as to why this is happening, so this work is still ongoing.
  Since this issue only happens when running the game on Wayland under Sway, it's not a large priority, but it was too entertaining not to share.
</p>

<h4>Dynamically linked libraries</h4>
<p>
  In a C++ program there are three ways to load/include a library:
  </p><ul>
    <li>By including it in your source binary (static linking).</li>
    <li>Having the system load it when your program starts (dynamic linking).</li>
    <li>Your program loads it explicitly after startup ("dynamic loading" or what I call "runtime linking").</li>
  </ul><p>
  We have many libraries, such as SDL, FontStash, and Lua, that are statically linked, but Factorio 1.1 also has <i>many</i> dynamically linked libraries:

</pre>
<p>
  Among these libraries are X11 and PulseAudio, which are being deprecated in favor of Wayland and PipeWire respectively.
  This causes a compatibility nightmare because if any dynamic dependencies are missing, the game will not launch.
  This obviously will not do!
</p>
<p>
  The presence of these dependencies confused me because we utilize SDL for most of the low-level syscalls, audio, and video, and SDL relies entirely on runtime linking.
  An investigation revealed the source of most of these dependencies to be <a href="https://liballeg.org/">Allegro</a>, the low-level library that we utilized for most of Factorio's alpha phase but we have since replaced with SDL.
  The only remaining use of Allegro in 2.0 was as a secondary audio backend in case a user experienced issues with the SDL audio backend, but the SDL backend has been stable for a very long time, so the time was ripe for its removal.
  This eliminated 123,024 lines of code from the game and drastically reduced the number of dynamic dependencies:
</p>
<pre>rai@tantal ~/dev/wube/factorio (master)
$ ldd bin/FinalReleasex64Clang/factorio
        linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007fff96ff2000)
        libresolv.so.2 =&gt; /lib64/libresolv.so.2 (0x00007fd2df8a9000)
        libm.so.6 =&gt; /lib64/libm.so.6 (0x00007fd2df7c8000)

        /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007fd2df8d6000)
</pre>

<h4>Clipboard woes</h4>
<p>
  It turns out that Allegro was not the only thing requiring us to link against X11.
  Back in 2017, we received a <a href="https://forums.factorio.com/46802">bug report</a> that a user could not paste large blueprint strings into the game, and Oxyd fixed this by adding support for <a href="https://tronche.com/gui/x/icccm/sec-2.html#s-2.5">X11 incremental clipboard transfers</a> to our GUI backend's clipboard handler.
</p>
<p>
  I was hoping to utilize SDL's built-in clipboard functionality, but unfortunately SDL does not support incremental transfers.
  This means there are three options:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Continue linking against X11, requiring users to install X11 on their system to be able to run the game (I don't want to mess with static linking).</li>
  <li>Figure out how to do runtime linking and implement that.</li>
  <li>Upstream our incremental transfers code into SDL so we can leverage SDL's clipboard functions and other SDL-based games can benefit from our work.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  As you might guess, I chose the third option.
  The work to upstream our code is ongoing but should be done in time for Factorio 2.0's release.
</p>

<h4>Asynchronous saving</h4>
<p>
  Many of you might not be aware that Factorio has support for saving your game in the background, without freezing while it does so.
  This feature is tucked away in the hidden settings and only works on macOS and Linux.
  This is one great example of taking advantage of a platform's features to benefit the game, which would not be available to us if we simply went through Proton.
</p>
<p>
  Asynchronous saving works by using the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fork.2.html">fork syscall</a> to essentially duplicate the game.
  The primary instance - the one you interact with - continues playing, but the newly forked child runs the saving process then exits on completion.
  I have used it for many years and have never had issues, but the setting remains hidden because there are a few unsolved problems with it and it requires a significant amount of RAM to work.
</p>
<p>
  I would love to promote this feature away from its hidden status in 2.0.
  If you are playing on Linux or macOS, please enable asynchronous saving (ctrl+alt+click Settings -&gt; "The rest" -&gt; <code>non-blocking-saving</code>) and report any issues you find.
  I am particularly interested in reproducing a <a href="https://forums.factorio.com/108738">seemingly random freeze</a> that occurs at the end of the process.
  Thank you in advance!
</p>

<h4>Continuing development</h4>
<p>
  This has been but a glimpse of the work I have been doing to ensure Factorio on Linux is the best that it can be.
  There are still many open bug reports and other issues but I am generally happy with the state of things and can confidently say that Factorio has <i>great</i> Linux support.
