<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p>My favorite part about getting older is that sometimes I wake up at 3:30 AM for no reason and can’t fall back asleep. This happened this weekend and by 5:30 or so I had exhausted my usual phone games (Wordle, Quordle, Blossom, Immaculate, Strands, etc). Reading my book about the extinction of the dinosaurs and rewatching the 9th inning of a thrilling Texas baseball win only woke me up more.  </p><p><span>Then I saw an article from Axios about how </span><a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/04/04/foreign-visits-american-airports-travel-warnings" rel="">travel to the US</a><span> from other countries fell off a cliff in March. As a true nerd, what excited me about the article was that they linked to an official government data source that I wasn’t familiar with. </span></p><p><span>I went to the CBP’s </span><a href="https://awt.cbp.gov/" rel="">Average Wait Time</a><span> website and found a rich dataset that can be extremely useful for describing current trends. The system is kind of clunky in that you have to select individual agencies and terminals, and the online data appears to only go back for 3 years despite the data collection starting in 2008. </span></p><p>But the data was easily exportable and, with a little bit of elbow grease, you can break down US and non-US passengers being processed by CBP each and every day at the nation’s busiest international airports. That’s really useful for showing if, say, some sort of policy had been implemented that was making people from abroad question whether they should come to the U.S. </p><p>Having downloaded the data for 8 of the busiest airports in the country I wanted to show how entries are changing. Travel can be very seasonal so I wanted to compare this year to the same time last year. And I rolled it over 30 days to be able to show any recent changes while not getting lost in the noise of daily change. </p><p>The result is below:</p><p>The last 30 days in this group of major airports has seen a greater than 10 percent reduction in foreign travelers being processed. I sent out an early version of this graph on Bluesky and some attention was paid to it. This immediately made me nervous because there is always the risk of systemic underreporting any time you’re working with very recent data. </p><p>Working with the CBP data immediately made me think about similar concerns when that come to mind when working with crime data — especially early in the year. </p><p><span>I’ve </span><a href="https://jasher.substack.com/p/deep-in-the-heart-of-texas-crime" rel="">talked before</a><span> about how much I like the Texas Department of Public Safety Uniform Crime Report </span><a href="https://txucr.nibrs.com/" rel="">website</a><span>. It gives you a ton of options for downloading pretty much everything Texas is reporting to the FBI as soon as agencies report it to the state. </span></p><p>San Antonio Police Department is one agency that does a great job of posting the most recent completed month’s data early in the following month. The February 2025 data for SAPD, for example, was published very early in March 2025. So if I want to see how thefts this year compare to last year I can easily pull up the YTD NIBRS report and there it is! </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F01ae0d05-7a1b-4189-9a57-abfecfc1764c_1249x1230.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F01ae0d05-7a1b-4189-9a57-abfecfc1764c_1249x1230.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F01ae0d05-7a1b-4189-9a57-abfecfc1764c_1249x1230.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F01ae0d05-7a1b-4189-9a57-abfecfc1764c_1249x1230.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F01ae0d05-7a1b-4189-9a57-abfecfc1764c_1249x1230.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F01ae0d05-7a1b-4189-9a57-abfecfc1764c_1249x1230.png" width="1249" height="1230" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/01ae0d05-7a1b-4189-9a57-abfecfc1764c_1249x1230.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1230,&quot;width&quot;:1249,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:260855,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://jasher.substack.com/i/160655816?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F01ae0d05-7a1b-4189-9a57-abfecfc1764c_1249x1230.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F01ae0d05-7a1b-4189-9a57-abfecfc1764c_1249x1230.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F01ae0d05-7a1b-4189-9a57-abfecfc1764c_1249x1230.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F01ae0d05-7a1b-4189-9a57-abfecfc1764c_1249x1230.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F01ae0d05-7a1b-4189-9a57-abfecfc1764c_1249x1230.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Some back of the spreadsheet math points to an 18 percent decline in theft offenses in San Antonio through February 2025 compared to the first two months of 2024. </p><p>But you have to be careful when using this data. </p><p><span>Running an </span><a href="https://txucr.nibrs.com/AdvancedSearch/AdvancedSearch" rel="">Ad Hoc Query</a><span> on thefts in San Antonio this year clearly shows why. This report lets you break down offenses by type and day. There were 121 thefts reported per day in San Antonio between January 1 and February 18, 105 per day from February 19 through 24, and 88, 67, 75, and 18 on February 25, 26, 27, and 28 respectively.</span></p><p>Law enforcement agencies have over a year until they have to submit final 2025 data to the FBI, so these numbers will be adjusted (usually up). The January numbers are prone to adjustment as well though the amount of change tends to diminish substantially after a month or two. </p><p>Theft fell 5 percent in San Antonio in 2024 and the early data from January and February points to a decline so far in 2025. But uncertainty with the data suggests cautioned is warranted when guesstimating what that decline may end up being. </p><p>Carl Sagan preached that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. Claiming that theft in San Antonio is falling a lot isn’t exactly extraordinary, but the degree of decline shown in the topline figures screams for more evidence to substantiate it. The closer look helps to evaluate and contextualize the likelihood of a decline so far this year allowing for an appropriate level of analytic caution.</p><p>Which brings us back to analyzing air travelers coming to the US. </p><p>As I said, I’d never worked with this dataset until very recently, so it made me nervous that my first usage pointed to a huge, sudden, very recent decline. One easy way to figure out if the decline was a real change or a data reporting issue is to do the same process but for US travelers being processed by CBP. I assume that US travelers haven’t changed behavior, so if there’s a huge decline there then we’re probably looking at a data reporting issue. </p><p>Here is what we get doing this exercise with New York’s JFK airport. </p><p>And LAX:</p><p>And Miami:</p><p>And just for fun I did Orlando which shows a wild change: </p><p>All four airports show an identical trend over the last 30 days with a huge drop in non-US passengers going through CBP processing and an increase in US passengers which doesn’t stand out. This strongly suggests that what we’re seeing is not slow data entry — because I’d expect US and non-US passengers to show the same trend if that was the case. </p><p>Then, to be sure it isn’t a data reporting issue I went back the next day and downloaded the last week of CBP processing at JFK. The old data showed 260,250 entries between 3/29 and 4/3/2025 while the newly updated data showed 260,250 entries over that span. An exact match gives very strong confidence that we’re seeing a trend rather than a data issue here. </p><p>There are quirks in the data that need to be remembered when contextualizing the data. </p><p>Travelers heading to the US from Canadian airports tend to go through customs at the Canadian airport so the data we have now may actually be understating the decline. And some posters on Bluesky pointed out that Easter is much later this year which may mean fewer travelers to Orlando for Spring Break, but no such impact exists with Easter 2024 being earlier than Easter 2023, so I’m skeptical that it’s playing much of a role. </p><p>The evidence clearly shows that foreigners have stopped coming to the United States as much as they were at this point last year. This newsletter doesn’t delve into politics, and the reason for this change is both pretty obvious and not in need of further discussion here.</p><p>From a data perspective, however, it's an interesting case study in finding an important trend and working to ensure what you're seeing is real. This is an issue that deserves close attention as time goes on and the CBP’s dataset is a great way to follow it to see if things get better, worse, or stay the same as the year goes on.  </p><div data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://jasher.substack.com/p/how-fewer-foreign-passengers-flying?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;}" data-component-name="CaptionedButtonToDOM"><p>Thanks for reading Jeff-alytics!

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p>I’m new to Substack—this is my first post.</p><p>Hey, I’m Matt. I founded Vizzly as a first-time entrepreneur and exited in under three years, selling the company to WPP, the world’s largest advertising organization. A few months after starting the company, we were accepted into Y-Combinator, and I spent about four months engrossed in San Francisco’s tech hustle culture learning from people much smarter than I. I’m not anti-SF (far from it; I have some incredible memories there), but I didn’t buy into the all-or-nothing mindset of startups. </p><p>It’s worth noting that after Demo Day, we set out to raise more than we ended up with—essentially, a failed Seed round. At the time, I saw this as a negative, assuming fundraising was a form of validation (turns out it’s not, by the way).</p><p>A year later, I came to realize that this was the best thing to happen to both the company and myself. For starters, it forced us to become very revenue-centric.</p><p>Additionally, it opened the door to smaller acquisitions. Because our preference stack (more on this later) was tiny, even a relatively small deal would produce a life-changing outcome for the founding team.</p><p>Writing this, I could go in a million directions—and I probably will in future posts, diving into different aspects. For now, I’ll focus on the 'missing middle path.'</p><p>On my LinkedIn feed, it feels like there are two dominant narratives in B2B SaaS: the VC path—go big or go home, maybe take a secondary at Series A or B, but push hard no matter what—or the Bootstrapper route—build sustainable value with an asset you own on a shoestring budget, and reap the rewards of cash flow and dividends.</p><p>What’s rarely talked about is the third path: raise a small amount—say, less than $1M—while keeping 90%+ of your equity, avoiding board seats, and building for profitability and strong asset value. All without draining your personal finances or spending a decade bootstrapping through revenue.</p><p>The reason it’s not more popular is that it’s a founder-centric approach that doesn’t fit the venture capital model, making it a controversial stance. In fact, if you pitched this pathway to a VC, I’m sure they’d ghost you quicker than their last Hinge date.</p><p>In short: the top 3% of investments are expected to return the fund and more. So, if you're aiming for a $10M outcome, they won’t be interested. Success and returns often increase with more funding, which is why VCs push for constant fundraising. With a preference stack, they get paid back first, leaving you effectively in debt. This forces you to scale to justify the time and effort needed to generate a meaningful outcome.</p><p><span>For those wondering what a preference stack is, it’s basically the order in which different investors get paid when a startup is sold or liquidated. You might see a headline in </span><em>TechCrunch</em><span> saying a startup has sold for $40M. For all you know, they raised $30M, grinded for eight years, and the deal is 10% cash and 90% equity exchange—meaning the founders involved (assume there are two) are basically exchanging overinflated equity that will probably be subject to a four-year vest. </span></p><p><span>This is obviously a hypothetical and a great outcome based on the probability of a startup's success, but it’s still a pretty modest outcome if you think that’s 12 years of prime life one would have sacrificed (sorry, </span><em>invested</em><span>).</span></p><p>I have an incredible amount of admiration for folks on the venture journey – it’s high risk, high reward, as I do for folks who bootstrap and pursue a more unconventional route. The problem with bootstrapping is simple: not everyone can sustain it.</p><p>Many bootstrapped B2B SaaS startups were agencies beforehand, such as Mailchimp, Basecamp, Lemlist, etc. I probably don’t need to labor this point too much, but this pathway can also take a really long time to create and drive value.</p><p>Of course it’s subjective, but I think the middle path provides the optimal combination of return size, time to return, all with minimal financial risk to the founders involved. For most B2B SaaS businesses, you shouldn’t need more than $1M in capital to get to PMF, find a GTM motion that works (not that it needs to scale), and reach an ARR figure where the revenue multiple for valuation starts to look pretty tasty—enough to offer significant upside even after investors are paid out.</p><p>What no VC will tell you is that there’s a window of opportunity — somewhere between Pre-Seed and Series A — where founders can tap into significant upside. This is rarely discussed, and too many companies fail because they raise too much, only to end up with little to nothing in a liquidation event (as described above).</p><p>We stumbled into the middle path, and I’m grateful for it.</p><p>There are still drawbacks and important factors to consider—particularly how you choose to source your investment. While most VCs may not align with this philosophy, angel investors are generally more open to a 2-3x ROI.</p><p>As with everything, there are trade-offs. The key is understanding your values, defining what you want from the journey and the outcome, and knowing what you're willing—and, more importantly, unwilling—to sacrifice along the way. Once you have that clarity, you can make an informed decision about the financing route to pursue.</p><ul><li><p>A middle path exists; you don’t need a moonshot or bootstrapping.</p></li><li><p>There's a sweet spot between Pre-Seed and Series A.</p></li><li><p>Know your 'why' and avoid getting drawn into a journey you don’t need.</p></li></ul><p>In future posts—or during caffeine-induced stints of motivation—I’ll dive deeper into topics such as fundraising, M&amp;A, GTM, PMF and a few other needless acronyms.</p><p>Stay tuned ✌️</p></div></article></div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div></div>]]></description>

            <pubDate>Mon, 07 Apr 2025 06:51:19 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2025/04/07/writing-c-for-curl/">https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2025/04/07/writing-c-for-curl/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43608551">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It is a somewhat common question to me: how do we write C in <a href="https://curl.se/">curl</a> <em>to make it safe and secure for billions of installations</em>? Some precautions we take and decisions we make. There is no silver bullet, just guidelines. As I think you can see for yourself below they are also neither strange nor surprising.</p>



<p>The ‘c’ in curl does not and never did stand for the C programming language, it stands for <em>client</em>.</p>



<h2>Disclaimer</h2>



<p><strong>This text does in no way mean that we don’t occasionally merge security related bugs.</strong> We do. We are human. We do mistakes. Then we fix them.</p>



<h2>Testing</h2>



<p>We write as many tests as we can. We run all the static code analyzer tools we can on the code – frequently. We run fuzzers on the code non-stop.</p>



<h2>C is not memory-safe</h2>



<p>We are certainly not immune to memory related bugs, mistakes or vulnerabilities. We count about 40% of our security vulnerabilities to date to have been the direct result of us using C instead of a memory-safe language alternative. This is however a much lower number than the 60-70% that are commonly repeated, originating from a few big companies and projects. If this is because of a difference in counting or us actually having a lower amount of C problems, I cannot tell.</p>



<p>Over the last five years, we have received <strong>no</strong> reports identifying a <em>critical</em> vulnerability and only two of them were rated at severity <em>high</em>. The rest ( 60 something) have been at severity <em>low</em> or <em>medium</em>.</p>



<p>We currently have close to 180,000 lines of C89 production code (excluding blank lines). We stick to C89 for widest possible portability and because we believe in continuous non-stop iterating and polishing and never rewriting.</p>



<h2>Readability</h2>



<p>Code should be easy to read. It should be clear. No hiding code under clever constructs, fancy macros or overloading. Easy-to-read code is easy to review, easy to debug and easy to extend.</p>



<p>Smaller functions are easier to read and understand than longer ones, thus preferable.</p>



<p>Code should read as if it was written by a single human. There should be a consistent and uniform code style all over, as that helps us read code better. Wrong or inconsistent code style is a bug. We fix all bugs we find.</p>



<p>We have tooling that verify basic code style compliance.</p>



<h2>Narrow code and short names</h2>



<p>Code should be written narrow. It is hard on the eyes to read long lines, so we enforce a strict 80 column maximum line length. We use two-spaces indents to still allow us to do some amount of indent levels before the column limit becomes a problem. If the indent level becomes a problem, maybe it should be split up in several sub-functions instead?</p>



<p>Also related: (in particular local) identifiers and names should be short. Having long names make them hard to read, especially if there are multiple ones that are similar. Not to mention that they can get hard to fit within 80 columns after some amount of indents.</p>



<p>So many people will now joke and say something about wide screens being available and what not but the key here is readability. Wider code is harder to read. Period. The question could possibly be exactly where to draw the limit, and that’s a debate for every project to have.</p>



<h2>Warning-free</h2>



<p>While it should be natural to everyone already, we of course build all curl code entirely without any compiler warning in any of the 220+ CI jobs we perform. We build curl with all the most picky compiler options that exist with the set of compilers we use, and we silence every warning that appear. We treat every compiler warning as an error.</p>



<h2>Avoid “bad” functions</h2>



<p>There are some C functions that are just plain bad because of their lack of boundary controls or local state and we avoid them (gets, sprintf, strcat, strtok, localtime, etc).</p>



<p>There are some C functions that are complicated in other ways. They have too open ended functionality or do things that often end up problematic or just plain wrong; they easily lead us into doing mistakes. We avoid sscanf and strncpy for those reasons.</p>



<p>We have tooling that <em>bans</em> the use of these functions in our code. Trying to introduce  use of one of them in a pull request causes CI jobs to turn red and alert the author about their mistake.</p>



<h2>Buffer functions</h2>



<p>Years ago we found ourselves having done several mistakes in code that were dealing with different dynamic buffers. We had too many separate implementations working on dynamically growing memory areas. We unified this handling with a new set of internal help functions for growing buffers and now made sure we only use these. This drastically reduces the need for realloc(), which helps us avoid mistakes related to that function.</p>



<p>Each dynamic buffer also has its own maximum size set, which in its simplicity also helps catching mistakes. In the current libcurl code, we have 80 something different <em>dynamic buffers</em>.</p>



<h2>Parsing functions</h2>



<p>I mentioned how we don’t like sscanf. It is a powerful function for parsing, but it often ends up parsing more than what the user wants (for example more than one space even if only one should be accepted) and it has weak (non-existing) handling of integer overflows. Lastly, it steers users into copying parsed results around unnecessarily, leading to superfluous uses of local stack buffers or short-lived heap allocations.</p>



<p>Instead we introduced another set of helper functions for string parsing, and over time we switch all parser code in curl over to using this set. It makes it easier to write strict parsers that only match exactly what we want them to match, avoid extra copies/mallocs and it does strict integer overflow and boundary checks better.</p>



<h2>Monitor memory function use</h2>



<p>Memory problems often involve a dynamic memory allocation followed by a copy of data into the allocated memory area. Or perhaps, if the allocation and the copy are both done correctly there is no problem but if either of them are wrong things can go bad. Therefor we aim toward minimizing that pattern. We rather favor strdup and memory duplication that allocates and copies data in the same call – or uses of the helper functions that may do these things behind their APIs. We run a daily updated graph in the curl dashboard that shows <em>memory function call density</em> in curl. Ideally, this plot will keep falling over time.</p>

<figure data-wp-context="{&quot;imageId&quot;:&quot;67f3d35b50110&quot;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image"><img decoding="async" width="3066" height="1726" data-wp-class--hide="state.isContentHidden" data-wp-class--show="state.isContentVisible" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-async--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on-async--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-async-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-06-at-13-01-34-curl-Project-status-dashboard.png" alt=""><figcaption>Memory function call density in curl production code over time</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>It can perhaps also be added that we avoid superfluous memory allocations, in particular in hot paths. A large download does not need any more allocations than a small one.</p>



<h2>Double-check multiplications</h2>



<p>Integer overflows is another area for concern. Every arithmetic operation done needs to be done with a certainty that it does not overflow. This is unfortunately still mostly a manual labor, left for human reviews to detect.</p>



<h2>64-bit support guaranteed</h2>



<p>In early 2023 we dropped support for building curl on systems without a functional 64-bit integer type. This simplifies a lot of code and logic. Integer overflows are less likely to trigger and there is no risk that authors accidentally believe they do 64-bit arithmetic while it could end up being 32-bit in some rare builds like could happen in the past. Overflows and mistakes can still happen if using the wrong type of course.</p>



<h2>Maximum string length</h2>



<p>To help us avoid mistakes on strings, in particular with integer overflows, but also with other logic, we have a general check of all string inputs to the library: they do not accept strings longer than a set limit. We deem that any string set that is longer is either just a blatant mistake or some kind of attempt (attack?) to trigger something weird inside the library. We return error on such calls. This maximum limit is right now eight megabytes, but we might adjust this in the future as the world and curl develop.</p>



<h2>keep master golden</h2>



<p>At no point in time is it allowed to break master. We only merge code into master that we believe is clean, fine and runs perfect. This still fails at time, but then we do our best at addressing the situation as quickly as possible.</p>



<h2>Always check for and act on errors</h2>



<p>In curl we always check for errors and we bail out <em>without leaking any memory</em> if (when!) they happen. This includes all memory operations, I/O, file operations and more. All calls.</p>



<p>Some developers are used to modern operating systems basically not being able to return error for some of those, but curl runs in many environments with varying behaviors. Also, a system library cannot <em>exit</em> or <em>abort</em> on errors, it needs to let the application take that decision.</p>



<h2>APIs and ABIs</h2>



<p>Every function and interface that is publicly accessible must <strong>never</strong> be changed in a way that risks breaking the API or ABI. For this reason and to make it easy to spot the functions that need this extra precautions, we have a strict rule: public functions are prefixed with “curl_” and no other functions use that prefix.</p>



<h2>Everyone can do it</h2>



<p>Thanks to the process of human reviewers, plenty of automatic tools and an elaborate and extensive test suite, everyone can (attempt to) write curl code. Assuming you know C of course. The risk that something bad would go in undetected, is roughly equal no matter who the author of the code is. The responsibility is shared.</p>



<p>Go ahead. You can do it!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>At a time when the world is down to a single drug that can reliably cure gonorrhea, the U.S. government has shuttered the country’s premier sexually transmitted diseases laboratory, leaving experts aghast and fearful about what lies ahead.</p>



<p>The STD lab at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — a leading player in global efforts to monitor for drug resistance in the bacteria that cause these diseases — was among the targets of major staff slashing at the CDC this past week. All 28 full-time employees of the lab were fired.</p>



<p>STD clinicians and researchers were flummoxed, both because most of the other infectious diseases functions of the CDC were spared in this round of cuts, and because of the critical nature of the work the lab performed. Until the Trump administration announced the United States was withdrawing from the World Health Organization, the CDC lab was one of three international reference laboratories for STDs that worked with the WHO to conduct surveillance for infection rates and drug-resistance patterns and to recommend the best ways to treat these infections. The other two are in Australia and Sweden.</p>



<p>A CDC white paper on antibiotic resistance released during the first Trump administration listed drug-resistant gonorrhea as <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/antimicrobial-resistance/media/pdfs/2019-ar-threats-report-508.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of five urgent threats</a> facing the country. Antimicrobial resistance to that last drug that reliably works to cure gonorrhea, ceftriaxone, is rare but on the rise globally.</p>



<p>“The loss of this lab is a huge deal to the American people,” said David C. Harvey, executive director of the National Coalition of STD Directors, which represents state, city, and U.S. territorial STD prevention programs across the country. “Without that lab, we would have not been able to appropriately diagnose and monitor drug-resistant gonorrhea.”</p>





<p>There has been no explanation from the Department of Health and Human Services, or its secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., about why the STD lab was closed. When STAT asked the HHS press office about the closure, the response was swift — but wholly unrelated to the question posed.</p>



<p>“The critical work of the CDC will continue under Secretary Kennedy’s vision to streamline HHS to better serve the American people. The reorganization will strengthen the CDC with the transfer of the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR), responsible for national disaster and public health emergency response, to the agency, reinforcing its core mission to protect Americans from health threats,” Emily Hilliard, deputy press secretary, said via email.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A follow-up from STAT noting that the information provided was not about the STD lab drew no response.</p>



<p>Though STDs don’t garner as many headlines as Ebola, influenza, or Covid-19, they are among the most common diseases in the world — not just infectious diseases, but diseases period, said Jeffrey Klausner, a professor of medicine in infectious diseases, population, and public health at the USC Keck School of Medicine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Klausner was shocked by the CDC lab’s closure. “To me, this is like a blind man with a chainsaw has just gone through the system and arbitrarily cut things without any rationale,” he said in an interview.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In terms of the decision’s implications for efforts to monitor for drug-resistant STDs, Klausner put it bluntly: “We are blind. As of [Tuesday], we are blind.”</p>



<p>Ina Park, a professor at the UCSF School of Medicine, and a co-author of the CDC’s 2024 laboratory guidelines for the diagnosis of syphilis, was also appalled.</p>



<p>“It’s just horrific and it’s so foolish and shortsighted,” Park said. “This administration has sometimes brought people back when they’ve realized that a service is vital and this is one of the times where I’m hoping that they will step up and do this.”</p>



<p>Klausner knows Kennedy personally, and reached out to tell him cutting the CDC’s STD lab was a mistake. As of Saturday, Klausner said he had not heard back from Kennedy on this issue.</p>



<p>The STD lab served multiple functions — updating treatment guidelines, monitoring resistance patterns, and working to develop better tests for syphilis, <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/01/30/syphilis-rates-epidemic-united-states/">a resurgent infection</a> for which existing tests are outdated.</p>



<p>It was a resource for clinicians who are having trouble curing patients of STIs that are not responding to treatment. Park noted she recently consulted on a case involving a woman who had been suffering for nine months from trichomoniasis, a vaginal infection. It was not responding to the treatments the woman’s physician prescribed. Park urged the treating doctor to send a sample to the CDC for additional testing, and the resulting treatment recommendation cured the infection.</p>





<p>The lab also leads the national surveillance for resistance patterns among STDs, generating genetic sequences of important isolates that it shares with the scientific community. That information is used in the development of tests and new therapeutics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the fired employees, who asked not to be named for fear of reprisals, noted the lab holds the world’s largest repository of gonorrhea isolates — over 50,000, dating back to 1988 when the CDC began to collect them. Many of those isolates are in a freezer farm contracted by the CDC. What will happen to this invaluable scientific resource? It’s not clear.</p>



<p>“They’re irreplaceable. Even if you have new mutations now, you always need to track where they came from. The evolution, the pressures on what genes and all that. You need those older ones to really study that,” the individual said. “Are they just going to autoclave the whole thing and destroy it?”</p>



<p>The fired lab employee noted that the work that was being done at the CDC STD lab is not done elsewhere. “There’s no duplication. There is no lab like us at NIH” — the National Institutes of Health —&nbsp;“or at any university. The university [researchers], they rely on our specimens to do work. But if no one collects them, it’s just a real blow.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Julie Dombrowski, a professor of medicine at the University of Washington and director of the Seattle and King County public health department’s HIV, STD and hepatitis C program, stressed that no one should expect the private sector to step in to fill the gap the closure has created.</p>



<p>“There is no commercial interest and little money to be made in this arena,” Dombrowski said in an email.</p>



<p>“It means we will lose ground in the fight against syphilis, we will be blind to national-level trends in antibiotic resistance among gonorrhea, and we will lose world-class expertise that will be very difficult to rebuild,” she said.</p>



<p>The loss of the CDC lab comes at a particularly fraught time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since the dawn of the antibiotic era, gonorrhea has systematically laid waste to every antibiotic used against it. The last reliably effective drug, ceftriaxone, is showing signs it too will soon be vanquished — reports of pan-resistant and extremely drug resistant gonorrhea have emerged in other parts of the world. What’s happening elsewhere will happen here, said Edward Hook, a professor emeritus at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, and an infectious diseases specialist who focuses on STIs.</p>





<p>“We live in a global village and these are global processes,” Hook said. “You can go from one side of the world to another in less than a day, and as a result the antibiotic resistance and public health threats can spread very, very quickly.”</p>



<p>For the first time in years, two new drugs for gonorrhea are nearing the end of the developmental pipeline —&nbsp;a major accomplishment. But given gonorrhea’s relentless development of resistance, it’s only a matter of time before it will develop the mutations needed to get around the new drugs too, said Barbara Van Der Pol, a professor of medicine and public health in the Heersink School of Medicine at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Without the CDC lab, national efforts to monitor for resistance to the new drugs won’t exist, she said.</p>



<p>“So we’re going to have new drugs hit the market, but we’re not going to have a mechanism that has been vetted at the national level and is standardized that we can deploy quickly,” Van Der Pol said.</p>



<p>That lack of national standardization will create a situation where it’s hard to interpret what’s being seen, and when treatment guidelines ought to be changed, she said, likening the situation to the Wild West: “Everybody has a gun, but nobody knows when to use it.”</p>



<p>The loss of the lab also comes as clinicians are starting to adopt a new approach to trying to prevent sexually transmitted infections in people at high risk of acquiring them. As of last year, the CDC recommended that men who have sex with other men along with transgender women take a dose of the antibiotic doxycycline within 72 hours of having sex. The approach, known as doxy PEP — for post-exposure prophylaxis —&nbsp;has been shown to reduce syphilis and chlamydia infections by about 70% and gonorrhea infections by about 50%.</p>



<p>Although there is a lot of hope associated with this approach, there are also concerns it could drive antibiotic resistance. Implementing it in the absence of a laboratory tasked with monitoring drug resistance nationally strikes STD experts as imprudent.&nbsp; “We’ve lost one of our key tools to be able to monitor that resistance,” Klausner said.&nbsp;“This is a terrible time to be cutting off the ability to conduct surveillance,” Park said.</p>

<p>Most improvements to cities are hard — they take millions of dollars and years of planning.</p>
<p>But the change I have in mind is easy — it just needs a few of us to decide to care.</p>
<p>Many people don’t realize that in order to build a new building, the plan has to be approved by the city’s design review board. This board is a group of people who have veto power over every aspect of the new building’s design.</p>
<p>For example, when a new bank branch was opened in downtown, our city design board approved a particular beige stucco for the outside wall. By accident, the contractors installed a faux wood instead. After the contractors appealed the mistake, city staff required them to tear the wall out and reinstall the approved siding.</p>
<p>The design board works hard to ensure that our city’s built environment is cohesive, beautiful, and in line with an established set of guidelines.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, someone can put up a 48-foot advertisement wherever they want with zero oversight. These ads are placed in very visible locations and designed to be bright, colorful, and distracting. Their appearance and placement do substantial harm to the peacefulness of the urban environment.</p>
<p>If someone showed up to the design review board wanting to splash a 48-foot advertisement in the face of every person coming into the city, they would get laughed out of the room. The reason these billboards get put up at all is because they’re exempt from design review, even though they’re a much more visible part of our city than the typical building.</p>
<p>Our neighbors will benefit much more from having a calmer public space than having a massive billboard reminding them to drink the latest beer.</p>
<p>The only people who won’t absolutely love this change are a few landowners who make money by spraying logos all over everyone’s public space. Literally everyone else benefits.</p>
<p>Let’s ban billboards in the city.</p>

        <h2>So, what exactly is Moldable Development again?</h2>
        <p>Moldable Development is a way of programming through contextual tools built for each problem.</p>
        <p>The premise of Moldable Development is that there is no single perspective on a system that is correct. There are always many, and different parts of the system are best shown differently. These shapes summarize the system from specific perspectives. This then leads to a compressed communication and a new feedback loop.</p>
        <p>Glamorous Toolkit itself is an extensive case study of how contextual tools enhance programming abilities. It comes out of the box with thousands of extensions and examples that touch on the whole system.</p>
        <p>The goal? To make the inside of systems explainable. </p>
      </div>

          <p><img src="https://gtoolkit.com/assets/pictures/gt-extensions.png"></p><p>The need for moldability is pervasive. The treemap shows the classes of Glamorous Toolkit organized in packages.

<p>We need to talk about the data. Crap data. We’re destroying our environment to create and store trillions of blurred images, half-baked videos, rip-off AI ‘songs’, rip-off AI animations, videos and images, emails with mega attachments, never-to-be-watched-again presentations, never-to-be-read-again reports, files and drawings from cancelled projects, drafts of drafts of drafts, out of date, inaccurate and plain wrong information, and gigabytes and gigabytes of poorly written, meandering content.</p>



<p>We’re destroying our environment to store copies of copies of copies of stuff we have no intention of ever looking at again. We’re destroying our environment to take 1.9 trillion photos every year. That’s more photos taken in one single year in the 2020s than were taken in the entire 20th century. That more than 200 photos taken for every child, woman and man alive. Every year. 12 trillion photos and growing, stored in the Cloud, the vast majority of which will never be viewed again. Mind boggling and exactly how Big Tech wants it.</p>



<p>I have spent almost 30 years working with hundreds of the largest organizations in the world in some 40 countries, trying to help them to better manage their content and data. Here’s what I’ve learned. 90% plus of commercial or government data is crap, total absolute crap. Period. It should never have been created. It certainly should never have been stored. The rise of digital saw the explosion of data crap production. Content management systems were like giving staff diesel-fueled diggers, whereas before they only had data shovels. I remember around 2010 being in conversation with a Microsoft manager, who estimated that there were then about 14 million pages on Microsoft.com, and that four million of them had never been visited. Four million, I thought. That’s basically the population of the Republic of Ireland of pages that nobody has ever visited. Why were they created? All the time and effort and energy and waste that went into all these pages that nobody had ever read. We are destroying our environment to create and store crap. And nobody cares.</p>



<p>Everywhere I went it was nothing but the same old story. Data crap everywhere. Distributed publishing that allowed basically anyone to publish anything they wanted on the intranet. And nobody maintains anything. When Kyndryl, the world’s largest provider of IT infrastructure services, was spun off by its parent, IBM, they found they had data scattered over 100 disparate data warehouses. Multiple teams had multiple copies of the same data. After cleanup, they had deleted 90% of the data. There are 10 million stories like this.</p>



<p>Scottish Enterprise had 753 pages on its website, with 47 pages getting 80% of visits. A large organization I worked for had 100 million visits a year to its website, with 5% of pages getting 80% of visits. 100,000 of its pages had not been reviewed in 10 years. “A huge percentage of the data that gets processed is less than 24 hours old,” computer engineer, Jordan Tigani, explained. “By the time data gets to be a week old, it is probably 20 times less likely to be queried than from the most recent day. After a month, data mostly just sits there.” The Southampton University public website found that 0.2% of pages got 90% of visits. Only 4% of its pages were ever visited. So, 96% of the roughly four million pages were not visited. One organization I knew of had 1,500 terabytes of data, with less than 2% ever having been accessed after it was first stored. There are 20 million more stories like these.</p>



<p>Most organizations have no clue what content they have. It’s worse. Most organizations don’t even know where all their data is stored. It’s even worse. Most organizations don’t even know how many computers they have. At least 50% of data in a particular organization is sitting on some server somewhere and nobody in management knows if it even exists; nor do they care. The average organization has hundreds of unsanctioned third-party app subscriptions being paid for by some manager’s credit card, storing everything from project chats to draft reports to product prototypes.</p>



<p>The Cloud made the crap data problem infinitely worse. The Cloud is what happens when the cost of storing data is less than the cost of figuring out what to do with the crap. One study found that data stored by UK engineering and construction industry firms had risen from an average of three terabytes in 2018 to 26 terabytes in 2023. That’s a compound annual growth rate of 50%! That sort of crap data explosion happened—and is happening—everywhere. And nobody in management cares because it’s so ‘cheap’ to store data. And this is what AI is being trained on. And we wonder why AI gets stuff wrong so often? Crap data in. Crap data out. And nobody cares. Particularly at a senior management level, nobody cares. Senior management is full to overflowing with Big Tech groupies chanting about the latest tech miracle that’s going to magically transform and supercharge their careers. Having to deal with senior managers has always been the most unsavory part of my job, because when it comes to technology, these managers exist on a whole other level of stupid vanity and narcissistic pursuit of their own selfish agendas.</p>

			<p>On many Unix-based operating systems, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsync">rsync</a> is a command line tool for transferring and synchronizing files on a computer, either between storage attached directly to the computer or between another computer located elsewhere on a network. The <strong>rsync</strong> command line tool has long been included on macOS, but Apple has provided the last version of <strong>rsync</strong> 2.x (<a href="https://download.samba.org/pub/rsync/NEWS#2.6.9">rsync 2.6.9, released in November 2006</a>) and did not update <strong>rsync</strong> past that even though <strong>rsync</strong> 3.x was released. Why not? It has to do with the version of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License">GNU General Public License</a> (GPL) open source license that <strong>rsync</strong> 2.x and 3.x were released under, with <a href="https://rsync.samba.org/GPL2.html">rsync 2.x being released under the GPLv2 license</a> and <a href="https://rsync.samba.org/GPL.html">rsync 3.x being released under the GPLv3 license</a>. Without going in-depth into the background legal issues, the reason for not providing <strong>rsync</strong> 3.x is that Apple decided that while it could comply with the terms of GPLv2 license with regards to <strong>rsync</strong> 2.x, it could not comply with the terms of GPLv3 license with regards to <strong>rsync</strong> 3.x.</p>
<p>What this has meant for macOS is that it has been shipping with a version of <strong>rsync</strong> which was last updated in 2006. While Apple has been updating the <strong>rsync</strong> 2.6.9 command line tool it shipped with macOS as needed in response to security issues and other problems, the fact remains that Apple’s version of <strong>rsync</strong> up until macOS Sequoia was almost twenty years old and did not include any of the new features introduced in <strong>rsync</strong> versions which came after version 2.6.9.</p>
<p>Now with macOS Sequoia, Apple has replaced <strong>rsync</strong> 2.6.9 with <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/openrsync">openrsync</a>, which is an implementation of <strong>rsync</strong> which is not using any version of the GPL open source license. Instead, <strong>opensync</strong> is licensed under the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses">BSD family of licenses</a>, specifically the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISC_license">ISC license</a>. The ISC license is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permissive_software_license">permissive license</a>, which means it places minimal restrictions on on how the licensed software can be used, modified and distributed, which means Apple decided it is able to comply with the terms of the license for <strong>openrsync</strong> where it decided it could not comply with the terms of GPLv3 license with regards to <strong>rsync</strong> 3.x.</p>
<p>So I’ve spent a bunch of time talking about licenses. Why does this change matter? It matters in two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Apple can ship updated versions of <strong>openrsync</strong> going forward without having to be concerned as to whether or not Apple can comply with the GPL open source license for <strong>rsync</strong>.</li>
<li>The <strong>openrsync</strong> command line tool is compatible with <strong>rsync</strong>, but as noted in the documentation <a href="https://github.com/kristapsdz/openrsync">openrsync accepts only a subset of rsync’s command line arguments</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Item number 2 is important for Mac admins because it may mean that <strong>rsync</strong> functionality that worked on older versions of macOS may not be working now on macOS Sequoia because that functionality is not available as part of the <strong>openrsync</strong> command line tool included with macOS Sequoia. For more information about what functionality is supported in the <strong>openrsync</strong> command line tool on macOS Sequoia, please see the link below:</p>
<p><a href="https://manp.gs/mac/1/openrsync">https://manp.gs/mac/1/openrsync</a></p>
<p>As of macOS 15.4, the <strong>openrsync</strong> tool is linked to <strong>/usr/bin/rsync</strong> so you can run the the <strong>openrsync</strong> command line tool like you have been the <strong>rsync</strong> command line tool. For version information about the <strong>openrsync</strong> command line tool, run the command shown below:</p>

Google <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/04/are-new-google-e2ee-emails-really-end-to-end-encrypted-kinda-but-not-really/">announced</a> that end-to-end encryption would be coming to Gmail.
What a sweet day!
Finally Google does something good.
Is it a new protocol to exchange public keys?
Maybe some way to fetch public key from destination server?
Oh sweet summer child.
</p>

<p>
The way Big G did it, is in the most annoying way.
The sender encrypts the message with her own key, an email with link is sent to receiver and if he wants to read it, he needs to open something they call "minimal gmail".
Yes, you've got that right.
To read an email sent from Gmail, one needs to use Gmail, even he never had any Google account.
</p>

<p>
I'm not going into how much this is not E2E, as this has already been proven.
But what I annoyed me the most is how Google assumes that only Gmail is worthy to read email from Gmail.
</p>

<p>
Until recently, there were basically three subcategories of email:
</p><ul>
<li>Normal email
</li><li>Gmail
</li><li>Outlook
</li></ul>

<p>
While the underlying exchange protocol is standardized,the later two have enough big market share to add custom behavior.
And no one cared, because if you're using G or O, you have no one else to blame but yourself (or your employer).
All we care about is being able to send email <em>to</em> the big two, which can be pain in the ass (I've heard).
</p>

<p>
But this power move is different.
If I receive an "e2e" encrypted email from gmail, I will not be able to read it without going to a Google service.
This means browser, javascript, tracking and all that crap.

</p>

<blockquote>
"IT teams also have the option to require all external recipients (even if they are Gmail users) to use the restricted version of Gmail. This helps ensure that their organization’s data does not end up stored on third-party servers and devices. It also makes it easier for organizations to protect their data by having the ability to apply security policies and revoke access to emails, no matter how long ago they were sent. Essentially, the E2EE email becomes like a document in Google Drive, allowing the IT team to control its access."<br>
-- <a href="https://workspace.google.com/blog/identity-and-security/gmail-easy-end-to-end-encryption-all-businesses">Google's documentation</a>
</blockquote>


<p>
This makes Google the actual owner of the sent message.
I can not read it (I will not open gmail!), I can not search for the email, I can not do anything.
My Email becomes just a notification channel I pay for.
"The recipient can then use a guest Google Workspace account to securely view and reply to the email" my ass.
</p>

<p>
Ergo: such emails go directly into spam list.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>In terms of unexplainable quirks</strong> I have as a human being, the weirdest one is this: Gum freaks me out. I hate the idea of it, to the point where I dislike the word.</p><p>It really bothers me, like nails on a chalkboard. I’ve never understood why. And it’s to the point where I’ve kind of checked out of things I might like just because their name references the word. (Apologies to <em>Stereogum</em>, I’m sure your music publication is just great, the problem is your name.)</p><p>So I’ve never been a <a href="https://gumroad.com/">Gumroad</a> user outside of a couple of random purchases here and there. I just couldn’t get past the name. But nonetheless, I respected the role it played in creating what we call the creator economy.</p><p>And I’m also an advocate for the creator economy becoming less platform-driven. Someone recently made the point to me that the recent rise in low-code and AI-based tooling is likely going to separate out the platforms that solve tough problems—the Stripes of the world—from those that simply put a nice interface on a problem. And having access to tools that you operate yourself is a way to get there.</p><p>Which is why, when I saw that the company had announced it was open-sourcing its application the other day, I got past my weird linguistic quirk and saw something that could be a big deal. I think we need more creator economy things in the self-hostable category, and putting Gumroad in that category feels like it could be a huge kick in the arm for that space.</p><p>So I did what I always do: I posted about it. It saw a little bit of pickup, particularly on Mastodon. I noted a quirk of the company’s open-source license that doesn’t truly make it open-source according to commonly accepted definitions, but I otherwise just passively shared it.</p><p>But with a little retrospect and a little more digging, I’m feeling less excited about it. In fact, I’m slightly frustrated with myself that I shared it so passively. There are some real problems with Gumroad that make it a terrible foundation for a creator economy that puts the creator in control. And there’s also a big issue with its leadership that almost went unnoticed on the very same day that the news was announced.</p><p>So, now, rather than just sharing it, I’m writing about it.</p></div><div><figure><img src="https://proxy.tedium.co/CRFbdZkmkG855zMN1H6oTyq36KI=/1281x972/filters:quality(80)/uploads/Screenshot-From-2025-04-06-13-32-54.png" width="1281" height="972" loading="lazy" alt="Screenshot From 2025 04 06 13 32 54"><figcaption>Gumroad goes open source! But wait, about that …</figcaption></figure><h3>Why people are frustrated with Gumroad</h3><p>First, some existing users have pointed out some issues with the Gumroad service that have made it significantly less useful for the average user. Fellow traveler Evan Hildreth <a href="https://oddevan.com/2025/04/04/bumps-in-the-gumroad.html">pointed out two specific issues</a>: First, the platform changed its rules for when you could email end users, which was annoying but understandable, and more troublingly, the company seems to have replaced its customer support with LLMs almost entirely. As he wrote:</p><blockquote><p>Finally, I asked how to contact Gumroad support. It pointed me to the help site&nbsp;<em>that didn’t exist</em>&nbsp;and the contact form within. I eventually found an email on another page and sent a message there; the response was very obviously from the same chatbot.</p><p>Chatbots are fine as&nbsp;<em>one of many</em>&nbsp;options to access support information. But as the&nbsp;<em>only</em>&nbsp;option? When it’s been trained on a help site that references itself (and therefore references a site that doesn’t exist)?</p></blockquote><p>Additionally, the open-source licensing thing is kind of a fib—<a href="https://danb.me/blog/gumroad-is-not-open-source/">it’s more of a source-available license</a> that limits your ability to use the tool after you hit a certain threshold. It’s not unheard of for this kind of license to be used by companies looking to lean into self-hosting without losing their money train. I have suggested that it can provide a middle ground for folks getting started as long as they’re aware of its limitations.</p><p>FOSS die-hards may not agree, but this kind of threading-the-needle can be done well, and honestly, IMHO. A good example is the content-management framework <a href="https://directus.io/">Directus</a>, <a href="https://directus.io/bsl">which essentially makes it free to use</a> in most cases, unless you make more than $5 million in finances per year, at which point you need to start paying for it. Not purely open source, but it throws FOSS folks a bone by making it so that versions of the software that are more than three years old revert to the General Public License.</p><p>How does Gumroad do it? <a href="https://github.com/antiwork/gumroad/blob/main/LICENSE.md">Well</a> …</p><blockquote><p>You may use the software under this license only if (1) your company has less than 1 million USD (2024) total revenue in the prior tax year, and less than 10 million USD (2024) GMV (Gross Merchandise Value), or (2) you are a non-profit organization or government entity. Adjust the revenue threshold for inflation according to the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics’ consumer price index for all urban consumers, U.S. city average, for all items, not seasonally adjusted, 1982–1984=100 reference base. If you are a company and exceed either of the limits in (1), your license ends. You may contact the licensor to discuss an alternative license.</p></blockquote><p>So essentially, if you ever have a single good year, you’re stuck paying a custom license fee.</p><figure><img src="https://proxy.tedium.co/rHxSqatPcGK0hwrilTSx9e83T6U=/799x533/filters:quality(80)/uploads/4871933275_3a45618da0_c.jpg" width="799" height="533" loading="lazy" alt="4871933275 3a45618da0 c"><figcaption>I know, the image looks confusing and out of place in this story, but I promise you it is related. (<a href="https://flickr.com/photos/eschipul/4871933275/">eschipul/Flickr</a>)</figcaption></figure><h3>Announcing an open-source shift as a big story drops</h3><p>But if that’s all Gumroad was doing, I wouldn’t feel compelled to say anything. The reason I’m speaking up <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/doge-department-of-veterans-affairs-ai/">is because of this <em>Wired</em> story,</a> released on the very same day Gumroad announced its “open source” license, which may have had the effect of minimizing the story’s viral impact. So I guess maybe a guy with a blog and a distaste for Gumroad’s name can give it a second stab.</p><p>The story is about DOGE, but it points out something curious:</p><blockquote><p>On March 25, tech staffers and contractors at the VA noticed an unfamiliar name trying to push changes that could impact VA.gov code. It was Sahil Lavingia, a newcomer to the agency listed in the VA’s internal directory as an adviser to the chief of staff, Christopher Syrek.</p></blockquote><p>Who’s Sahil Lavingia, you might ask? Why, the founder and CEO of Gumroad! It’s not even the central point of the piece, but the fact is, if you’re supporting Gumroad—a tool that, notably, has survived as long as it did because of <a href="https://republic.com/gumroad-march-2021">a high-profile crowdfunding campaign</a>—you’re allowing its CEO the financial freedom to work in the Department of Veterans Affairs, at the behest of DOGE, for free.</p><p>When submitted a list of questions about his work for DOGE, Lavingia told <em>Wired</em>: “Sorry, I’m not going to answer these, besides to say I’m unpaid. And a fan of your work!”</p><p>And the reason he has all this free time? Simple: As the piece notes, he achieved financial stability with Gumroad by replacing nearly all of its employees with automation. (Hence why Evan Hildreth can’t get any damn support.) Which is now what he wants to do with the VA, as the piece explains.</p><p>There’s a lot more there—which I recommend checking out the full piece to get a grasp on, but suffice it to say: If you disagree with this, now may be a good time to stop using Gumroad. It’s not like you’re going to find a support person there anyway.</p><figure><img src="https://proxy.tedium.co/0vIQut_MdPMJhq9aLiSEWzIH8-I=/1000x750/filters:quality(80)/uploads/GumballMachine.jpg" width="1000" height="750" loading="lazy" alt="Gumball Machine"><figcaption>No reason you have to use someone else’s gumball machine. (<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/woman-in-green-jacket-standing-beside-stainless-steel-round-container-4nsrOXYL-90">Pete Alexopoulos/Unsplash</a>)</figcaption></figure><h3>Maybe it’s time to shake up the creator economy calculus?</h3><p>May I make a suggestion? If the tech firm you’re relying on to make money is using AI and low-code tools to offer their service to you anyway, what’s stopping you from just doing the same thing? You can make a Gumroad or a Patreon. It’s easier than ever—<a href="https://tedium.co/2025/03/20/snap-fasteners-tariffs-history/">I just featured a guy in the newsletter who did just that</a>.</p><p>To me, I think that there is a real opportunity to take away the reins from middlemen who extract value rather than add it by leaning into things we host ourselves. Creators, for too long, have given too much power away to the company that made our lives mildly more convenient. If they’re trying to optimize to the nubs, destroying quality of service in the process, why even bother letting them have a lane in the middle?</p><p>To be clear, not everyone’s a bad player—and I will stand up for services I think do it well. (I like Ko-Fi, and personally <a href="https://ko-fi.com/tedium/commissions?commissionAlias=caf0972c99&amp;openCommissionsMenu=True#buyShopCommissionModal">just launched something there</a> last week.)

Nobody’s asking you to be a vibe coder over here. But I think there’s a real opportunity to work around the current system’s deficiencies for creators, if they want to go down that road. If the makers of these platforms are optimizing everything to within an inch of its life, why couldn’t creators do that?</p><p>Plus, you could give it a name that doesn’t have the word “gum” in it.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><header></header><section><p>With the recent flurry of US federal firings, many people are <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/27/fired-federal-worker-trump-voter/">pointing and laughing</a> at the Trump-voting federal employees who are just now finding out that they’ve voted for themselves to be let go. How could you have this poor a mental model of <em>what your job even is</em>? Well. In my opinion, many software engineers are operating under a mental model that’s just as bad, and are often doing the equivalent of voting for the person promising to fire them.</p>
<p>I won’t quote the tweets, but I regularly see stories like “I convinced my idiot bosses to <em>finally</em> let me do only tech debt work, and would you believe they fired me after a few months?” Or “I’ve been busting my ass on this underfunded project and I still got a bad performance review”. Or “it’s so unfair that I haven’t been promoted - look at all this amazing accessibility/standards/open-source work I’ve been doing!” The basic structure goes like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>A bright-eyed engineer joins a tech company, excited to go and make the world a better place</li>
<li>They throw themselves into various pieces of work that don’t make money (improving FCP performance, better screenreader support, refactoring)</li>
<li>Their managers desperately try to redirect them to work that does make money, causing a long frustrating power struggle</li>
<li>Eventually the bright-eyed engineer gives up and unhappily focuses on Profitable Product X, or</li>
<li>The bright-eyed engineer leaves or is fired, and goes on Twitter to complain about their important work not being valued</li>
</ol>
<p>The complaint in this story is basically equivalent to “I can’t believe Trump is firing me from the IRS when I voted for the guy”. It represents a fundamental misunderstanding of what tech companies <em>are</em>.</p>
<h3>What are tech companies?</h3>
<p>So what is the right understanding? Let’s start as simple as possible. Tech companies are run by small groups of people with the goal of making money<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>. Successful tech companies make a lot of money, by definition. They hire software engineers in order to continue doing the things that make that money, or to do new things that make more money.</p>
<p>At successful tech companies, engineering work is valued in proportion to how much money it makes the company (directly or indirectly). Patrick McKenzie has an <a href="https://www.kalzumeus.com/2011/10/28/dont-call-yourself-a-programmer/">excellent post</a> on this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Profit Centers are the part of an organization that bring in the bacon: partners at law firms, sales at enterprise software companies, “masters of the universe” on Wall Street, etc etc.  Cost Centers are, well, everybody else.  You really want to be attached to Profit Centers because it will bring you higher wages, more respect, and greater opportunities for everything of value to you.  It isn’t hard: a bright high schooler, given a paragraph-long description of a business, can usually identify where the Profit Center is.  If you want to work there, work for that.  If you can’t, either a) work elsewhere or b) engineer your transfer after joining the company.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Companies value work more the closer it is to a profit center. I don’t think you necessarily have to work <em>in</em> profit centers (in most tech companies, that would mean abandoning your engineering title and role). But you need to demonstrate your value to the profit center in order for your own work to be valued. I’m not saying you need to do this to keep your job. Companies pay lots of people who don’t deliver value, sometimes for many years. What I’m saying is this:</p>
<p><strong>If your work isn’t clearly connected to company profit, your position is <em>unstable</em></strong></p>
<p>In other words, you’re probably depending on a kind-hearted manager (or CEO) who personally values your work. When they leave, you’re in trouble. Or you’re depending on a large company not really caring to check if a small team is bringing in profits. When they look, you’re in trouble. Or you’re depending on a cultural climate where your work has temporary cultural cachet (e.g. biofuels in the early 2000s). When that changes, you’re in trouble. The only way to have a stable position is to be connected to the way the company makes money.</p>
<h3>Connecting your work to profit</h3>
<p>In order to know if your work is connected to company profits, you have to know two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>What is your company’s business model? How do they make money?</li>
<li>How does your work support the business model?</li>
</ol>
<p>Publicly traded companies must publish their business model and finances every year, which means you can either just go read that or read what people are writing about it on business blogs, magazines, and so on. (If you’re working for a well-known company, you can probably just ask a LLM). If you’re working for a private company, that can be harder, but usually it’s not too hard to get the gist. For instance, the broad strokes of where Valve get their money from are pretty clear: it’s Steam, not their first-party games.</p>
<p>Being an engineer at a company will give you much more visibility into the business model. For instance, you can run analytics queries that identify the ten largest customers. Often you won’t have to run these queries directly - they’ll be shared among the product-and-business folks, in channels that most engineers have no interest in. It’s worth trying to learn about the business model. For instance, if I were working for Valve, I’d want a much clearer answer than “it’s Steam”: I’d want to know which kind of games were bringing in the most money, the distribution between new users and existing users, and so on.</p>
<p>Once you have an idea how your company makes money, you can gauge how your work supports it. If you build a product that many people are buying, this is easy: calculate how big a percentage of company profit your product is. What if you don’t build a product? Say you’re on the accessibility team, or the German localization team. In that case, you ought to figure out why your company is investing in these things. For example, working on accessibility might be valuable because:</p>
<ul>
<li>It allows us to sell to (e.g.) visually-impaired customers, growing the total addressable customer base by X%</li>
<li>It enables us to meet specific regulatory requirements that allow us to sell to large enterprise customers (e.g. governments)</li>
<li>It makes us look good, or at least avoids us looking bad</li>
<li>It’s just good work that is worth doing because it’s the right thing to do</li>
</ul>
<p>Some reasons are only important when times are good. If the company is doing great and has more money than it knows what to do with, the last two points are probably worth spending money on. (If the company is doing <em>really</em> great, like a lot of companies in 2019, “literally anything” is worth spending money on in order to accumulate engineers). When interest rates rise, those reasons vanish.</p>
<p>These reasons will apply to some companies more than others. For instance, if you work at Google, the first reason is important because growing a customer base worth ~270B by 2% unlocks ~5.5B of new revenue. If Google is paying your team less than 5B in total, your team is probably making enough money to justify its existence. But if you work at a smaller company with revenue measured in millions, that math goes the other way.</p>
<p>There’s an obvious consequence to this: if you want your work to be valued (i.e. you don’t want to be reshuffled or fired), and you want to work on personally-satisfying features like accessibility, or UI polishing, or anything else not directly connected to profit - <strong>you need to go and work for a very profitable company</strong>.</p>
<h3>Delivering marginal value</h3>
<p>When I <a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/difficulty-in-big-tech">wrote about</a> this idea - that very large tech companies deliver marginal features as a way of slightly growing their massive addressable customer base - some readers found the idea depressing. Maybe so! But at least it’s a theory for how it might be possible to work on these kinds of features and get paid for it. The alternative theory is something like:</p>
<ol>
<li>Accessibility, clean code, good performance, and so on are all Good Features</li>
<li>Good Companies care about Good Features</li>
<li>I just need to keep looking until I find a Good Company and not a Bad Company</li>
</ol>
<p>I don’t think that a smart engineer who thinks about this problem will come away believing this. But lots of smart engineers don’t like thinking about how their work connects to company profits, so their implicit beliefs often add up to something like this. These engineers will often go through the five-step process I mentioned in the introduction to this post. I hate to see technically strong, motivated, kind-hearted engineers run headlong into burnout for completely predictable reasons.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>It’s easy to fall into the trap of thinking that you get paid for work because it’s important</li>
<li>You get paid for work because it makes money. If your work doesn’t contribute to that, your position is inherently unstable</li>
<li>If you want a stable position, you should try and figure out how your work connects to company profits, and strengthen that connection if possible</li>
<li>All kinds of seemingly-unprofitable work makes money, particularly at large companies where small percentages are a lot</li>
<li>If you want to work on seemingly-unprofitable work, you’re probably better off working for large successful tech companies</li>
</ul>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                                        <p>CAMPO, Calif. (AP) — Hiking the Pacific Crest Trail is a challenge, especially for adventurers making the entire run from Southern California to Canada, and Eric Kipperman’s job is to greet them at the start and lay bare the difficulties ahead.</p><p>He has lately begun warning that the journey may be even tougher. Following cuts by the Trump administration, plans to clear downed trees and rebuild storm-battered stretches in 2025 have been scrapped.</p><p>“This year, we’re going to have less trail work done on the trails, so just know that going into your hike, safety is the most important thing,” Kipperman told a group of backpackers from Europe and the United States at the trailhead near Campo, California, an hour’s drive east of San Diego. </p><p>He cautioned there is “no trail” at all in parts of the 2,650-mile (4,265 kilometers) path through California, Oregon and Washington state.</p>
    
<p>The cutbacks are not just on the West Coast. Ahead of the busy summer hiking season, funding freezes and mass layoffs also are disrupting repairs on the East Coast’s Appalachian Trail after nearly 500 miles (800 kilometers) were damaged by <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-helene-fema-federal-aid-congress-rollins-e982f8d36a31ef0b1fb7e3e19e426c72">Hurricane Helene</a></span>, underscoring how President Donald Trump’s <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-elon-musk-federal-workers-layoffs-d295d4bb2cdd5023c27d9cb03754e81b">dramatic downsizing of the U.S. government</a></span> is touching even the nation’s remote backcountry where vacationers, wanderers and escapists alike retreat to leave modern life behind. </p>



<p>Wildfires and more intense storms due in part to climate change have been taking a toll on the legendary trails. The federal cuts threaten their very existence, according to the Pacific Crest Trail Association and the Appalachian Trail Conservancy, which oversee their preservation in partnership with the government and receive millions in federal dollars.</p>
    
    
    
<p>The U.S. Forest Service called the situation “dynamic and evolving” in an email to The Associated Press, but said they are committed to ensuring public safety and access to recreation areas that are vital to local economies.</p>
    
<p>The Trump administration has let go some 3,400 workers at the <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/fired-federal-workers-wildfires-season-trump-west-d915e8ea272b7265912d7eafdbf7420a">U.S. Forest Service</a></span>, and nearly <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-national-parks-open-workers-fired-burgum-279dac0653f3e1af839b14668bf3d2d7">1,500</a></span> at the <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-national-park-firings-doge-grand-teton-baedee0a748a6374eafb6f95aac5dadc">National Park Service</a></span>, including trail repair specialists. The associations said the cuts also led to the rescinding of job offers for seasonal crews with technical skills to rebuild boardwalks, bridges and campsites and train thousands of volunteers. </p><p>Courts have ordered federal agencies to rehire thousands of workers, but some say they are <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-fired-federal-workers-rehired-ac9afd4165c3110d7d7ee6c81eba0101">not coming back</a></span>.</p><p>“For hikers, they’re going to be crawling, navigating, working their way through downed trees across the trail that won’t get cut out,” said Justin Kooyman, director of the Pacific Crest Trail operations. “It’s going to make for a little more rough and tumble.”</p>
    
<h2>A backlog of projects</h2><p>While the trails are not in total disarray and many hikers may not see any damaged areas, maintenance is critical to their existence, the associations say. More than 20 miles (32 kilometers) of the Appalachian Trail remain closed following Helene and downed trees could fuel wildfires. </p><p>Last month, the Appalachian Trail turned 100 years old. The footpath stretches 2,193 miles (3,530 kilometers) between Georgia’s Springer Mountain and Maine’s Mount Katahdin. </p><p>Its founder, the late forest scientist Benton MacKaye, saw a need for a place to escape stress following the end of World War I and the 1918 flu epidemic. </p><p>The Appalachian Trail and Pacific Crest Trail officially became the country’s first National Scenic Trails under the 1968 National Trails System Act. Completing them has come to symbolize the strength of the human spirit, inspiring books and movies. Only a fraction are thru-hikers, a term for those who walk the trails from end to end. Many don’t succeed and several people have died trying. Most users hike for a day or two to enjoy the breathtaking beauty.</p><p>“I am so concerned with what seems to be a general lack of appreciation for what these protected outdoor spaces can bring to not just our physical well-being but to our souls,” said Sandi Marra, head of the Appalachian Trail Conservancy. “If we lose these things, we are really going to be lost as a species, and definitely as a country.”</p>
    
<p>The Pacific Crest Trail Association said it is operating with a third less federal grant money than anticipated. The Appalachian Trail Conservancy said at least $1.5 million is at risk from federal downsizing.</p><p>The National Park Service said its funding has continued for the Appalachian Trail as it works to “address challenges collaboratively and seek solutions” to support the footpath’s “enduring legacy.”</p><p>Both trails already had a backlog of projects. Wildfires have scorched nearly 250 miles (400 kilometers) of the Pacific Crest Trail in recent years. </p><p>The disruption exacerbates the deteriorating conditions and the spread of invasive plant species, which will ultimately increase costs, said Megan Wargo, head of the Pacific Crest Trail Association. </p>
    
<h2>Cutting back </h2><p>The Pacific Crest Trail crosses searing desert and traverses forests of giant sequoias, the world’s largest trees, before climbing by snow-covered peaks in the rugged Sierra Nevada. After snaking over 50 mountain passes, it ends in Washington’s remote Pasayten Wilderness at the Canadian border.</p><p>As the trail’s popularity grew through social media and the bestselling memoir “Wild” that inspired a Hollywood film, drawing less experienced backpackers, the association hired what they call “crest runners.”</p><p>Kipperman is one of two at the southern end. Their duties include greeting hikers at the Mexican border, checking their permits and providing safety tips before they set off. The crest runners normally work from March until August, covering the hottest, riskiest months for that section. </p><p>Last year, a crest runner also worked the northern end at the Canadian border. But this year they only will be at the southern end until mid-May unless more federal funds are unfrozen.</p><p>Kipperman, whose trail name is “Pure Stoke,” is infectiously cheery as he rattles off the dangers from rattlesnakes to dehydration and distributes bags for discarded toilet paper. He steers clear of discussing politics and instead talks about protecting water quality, burying human waste, packing out trash and building safe campfires.</p><p>“Remove the ego. Address the situation. See if going forward is really the right thing for you,” Kipperman said, warning hikers to beware that Mile 225 or so is washed out. </p><h2>Plowing ahead </h2><p>After hearing Kipperman’s spiel, backpacker Joshua Suran said he planned to try helping restore the trail where possible.</p><p>Marias Michel of Germany trudged over, concerned about the weight of his backpack draped with gear, water bottles and a pair of Crocs. After quitting his job, he said he needed to do the trail, calling it “a resetting, a big detox.”</p><p>He was aware of the federal cuts but said he couldn’t worry about that.</p><p>“I’m just going to be learning by doing because I don’t want to be too much up here,” Michel said, pointing to his head. “I want to test myself. No expectations. It’s an attempt until you make it.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
	   
<p><img alt="Apache" height="900" src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/content/hl-images/2022/10/19/apache-header-image.jpg" width="1600"></p>

<p>A maximum severity remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability has been discovered impacting all versions of Apache Parquet up to and including 1.15.0.</p>

<p>The problem stems from the deserialization of untrusted data that could allow attackers with specially crafted Parquet files to gain control of target systems, exfiltrate or modify data, disrupt services, or introduce dangerous payloads such as ransomware.</p>

<p>The vulnerability is tracked under <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-30065" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">CVE-2025-30065</a> and has a CVSS v4 score of&nbsp;10.0. The flaw was fixed with the release of Apache version 1.15.1.</p>

<p>It should be noted that to exploit this flaw, threat actors must convince someone to import a specially crafted Parquet file.</p>

<h2>Severe threat to "big data" environments</h2>

<p>Apache Parquet is an open-source, columnar storage format designed for efficient data processing. Unlike row-based formats (like CSV), Parquet stores data by columns, which makes it faster and more space-efficient for analytical workloads.</p>

<p>It is widely adopted across the data engineering and analytics ecosystem, including big data platforms like Hadoop, AWS, Amazon, Google, and Azure cloud services, data lakes, and ETL tools.</p>

<p>Some large companies that use Parquet include Netflix, Uber, Airbnb, and LinkedIn.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;security problem in Parquet was disclosed on April 1, 2025, following a responsible disclosure by its finder, Amazon researcher Keyi Li.</p>

<p>"Schema parsing in the parquet-avro module of Apache Parquet 1.15.0 and previous versions allows bad actors to execute arbitrary code," warned the short&nbsp;<a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/04/01/1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">bulletin published on Openwall</a>.</p>

<p>"Users are recommended to upgrade to version 1.15.1, which fixes the issue."</p>

<p>A separate bulletin by Endor Labs highlights the risk of CVE-2025-30065 exploitation more clearly, warning that the flaw can impact any data pipelines and analytics systems that import Parquet files, with the risk being significant for files sourced from external points.</p>

<p>Endor Labs believes the problem was introduced in Parquet version 1.8.0, though older releases might also be impacted. The firm suggests coordinated checks with developers and vendors to determine what Praquet versions are used in production software stacks.</p>

<p>"If an attacker tricks a vulnerable system into reading a specially crafted Parquet file, they could gain remote code execution (RCE) on that system," <a href="https://www.endorlabs.com/learn/critical-rce-vulnerability-in-apache-parquet-cve-2025-30065---advisory-and-analysis" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">warns Endor Labs</a>.</p>

<p>However, the security firm avoids over-inflating the risk by including the note,&nbsp;"Despite the frightening potential, it's important to note that the vulnerability can only be exploited if a malicious Parquet file is imported."</p>

<p>That being said, if upgrading to Apache Parquet 1.15.1 immediately is impossible, it is suggested to avoid untrusted Parquet files or carefully validate their safety before processing them. Also, monitoring and logging on systems that handle Parquet processing should be increased.</p>

<p>Although no active exploitation has been discovered yet, the risk is high due to the flaw's severity and the widespread use of Parquet files in big data applications.</p>

<p>Administrators of impacted systems are recommended to upgrade to Parquet version 1.15.1, which addresses CVE-2025-30065, as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Among motorcyclists, there is a <a href="https://www.rideapart.com/news/608732/why-tesla-autopilot-ignores-bikes/">persistent rumor</a> that Teslas are dangerous to ride around in traffic. Whether it’s their silent electric drivetrain, extreme acceleration, or self-driving technology supposedly failing to see motorcycles, every biker seems to know someone who’s had a close call with a Tesla.</p>



<p>Our new analysis of data from the NHTSA on self-driving crashes proves this rumor to be true. Since 2022, Teslas in self-driving mode have been involved in five fatal motorcycle crashes (or more).</p>



<p>It’s not just that self-driving cars in general are dangerous for motorcycles, either: this problem is unique to Tesla. Not a single other automobile manufacturer or ADAS self-driving technology provider reported a single motorcycle fatality in the same time frame.</p>



<p>So, why are Teslas involved in self-driving crashes that kill motorcyclists? Let’s interrogate the data and get to the bottom of it.</p>



<h2><strong>TL;DR: Self-Driving Teslas Rear-End Motorcyclists, Killing at Least 5</strong></h2>



<p>Brevity is the spirit of wit, and I am just not that witty. This is a long article, here is the gist of it:</p>



<ul>
<li>The NHTSA’s self-driving crash data reveals that Tesla’s self-driving technology is, by far, the most dangerous for motorcyclists, with five fatal crashes <em>that we know of</em>.</li>



<li>This issue is unique to Tesla. Other self-driving manufacturers have logged zero motorcycle fatalities in the same time frame.</li>



<li>The crashes are overwhelmingly Teslas rear-ending motorcyclists.</li>
</ul>



<h2><strong>Self-Driving Teslas Are Fatally Striking Motorcyclists From Behind</strong></h2>



<p>I learned to ride a motorcycle on a military base, and the sergeant was brutally honest.</p>



<p>He said: <strong>“If you’re going to die on the bike, it’s going to be your own fault.”</strong></p>



<p>Welcome to being a motorcyclist. Our margin of error is slim, and mistakes are easily fatal. It’s rough out here on two wheels. Helmet and jacket, <em>strongly encouraged.</em></p>



<p>Rider error, while tragic, is a fact of life. So the first item to rule out is whether the motorcyclists themselves are causing these accidents.</p>



<p><strong>The good news:</strong> we can largely rule out rider error in these crashes. The NHTSA reports the crash location on the self-driving vehicle, so we can tell whether the Tesla was t-boned or rear-ended.</p>



<p>That’s not the case for the self-driving Tesla motorcycle fatalities reported to the NHTSA.</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/ffdd/sgo-2021-01/SGO-2021-01_Incident_Reports_ADAS.csv">NHTSA data</a>:</p>



<ul>
<li>3 out of 5 cases show the Tesla sustained front-end impacts, or front and left-side impacts, or (grimly) front and bottom impacts.</li>



<li>2 out of 5 cases had crash direction marked as “unknown” in the manufacturer’s reporting to the government.</li>
</ul>



<p>Those two “unknown” cases are both in Florida. One of them, in Boca Raton, was a Tesla rear-ending a motorcycle stopping at a traffic light. The final Florida case has fewer details available.</p>



<p>That means that, in 100% of Tesla’s fatal self-driving motorcycle crashes where we know the direction of travel, the Tesla was behind the motorcyclist before impact. The self-driving Teslas are fatally striking the motorcyclists from behind.</p>



<h2>We’d Love to Tell You More, But Tesla’s Self-Driving Data Is Redacted</h2>



<p>It would be helpful to have the official crash narratives for context. The NHTSA requires that automobile manufacturers and self-driving technology providers offer that context in their governmental crash reporting.</p>



<p>Tesla is unique in that they request all of their narrative data be redacted, along with many other data points, citing “confidential business information” or “personally identifiable information” about the victim.</p>



<p><strong>Learn more about that here:</strong> <a href="https://fuelarc.com/tech/redacted-tesla-asked-for-redactions-on-every-self-driving-crash-reported-to-the-nhtsa-since-2021/">Tesla Asked for Redactions on Every Self-Driving Crash Reported to the NHTSA Since 2021</a></p>



<p>This limits journalists’ ability to see the full picture behind these crashes and what might be causing them.</p>



<p>Speaking of investigations… why did the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/doge-cuts-nearly-half-unit-overseeing-autonomous-vehicles-safety-washington-post-2025-02-21/">cut the NHTSA’s self-driving safety office staff by almost half</a>? Why cut back on the small office capable of investigating Tesla’s unredacted safety data? Seems like an odd place to start cutting costs.</p>



<p>Anyway, here is how we constructed our study.</p>



<h3><strong>A Note on Methodology</strong></h3>



<p>To be included in the NHTSA’s self-driving crash reporting, known as the “<a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/laws-regulations/standing-general-order-crash-reporting">Standing General Order,</a>” the car’s self-driving technology must have been active within 30 seconds of the crash.</p>



<p>We don’t have access to internal Tesla data, which could tell us whether self-driving was still active at the moment of impact. We can only infer from what we do have. </p>



<p>This is good and bad: bad in that it is not as granular as we would like, but good in that it is standardized. Every manufacturer is held to the same standard.</p>



<p>For the rest, we’ve tracked down each crash in local news reporting. Read those narratives below.</p>



<h2><strong>Filling in Tesla’s Self-Driving Crash Redactions with Press Coverage</strong></h2>



<p>It’s hard to hide the truth in the 21st century. We have city names and months for each fatal motorcycle crash involving a Tesla in self-driving mode. Most of the other significant data is redacted at Tesla Inc’s request, but I’ve done more with less. That’s enough to start connecting the dots with public news reports and police reports.</p>



<p>Below, I’ve linked publicly available reporting for each case to support our conclusions above. The details are distressing, so if you’d rather avoid reading about fatal car accidents, <a href="#engineering">skip ahead to my conclusions</a>.</p>



<h3>April 2024, Snohomish WA:</h3>



<p><strong>NHTSA Report ID 13781-7567.</strong></p>



<p>The self-driving subject vehicle is a 2022 Tesla Model S. The Tesla fatally struck a motorcyclist from behind in low-speed stop and go traffic on a highway near Seattle.</p>



<p>The driver reports that he was looking at his cellphone with his Tesla’s Full-Self Driving mode engaged. Allegedly, the driver heard a bang, his Tesla suddenly accelerated, and he struck the unmoving motorcyclist in front of him from behind, pinning the motorcyclist under the Tesla.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/31/tesla-in-crash-that-killed-motorcyclist-was-using-self-driving-system-authorities-say.html">https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/31/tesla-in-crash-that-killed-motorcyclist-was-using-self-driving-system-authorities-say.html</a></p>



<p>Interestingly, the Washington State Highway Patrol determined that Full-Self Driving was active not from a governmental collaboration with the NHTSA or similar, but by downloading the data directly from the Tesla’s computer after seeking a warrant.</p>



<p>The driver was arrested for vehicular homicide, due to being distracted by his cellphone. Documents here with witness statements in the police reports:</p>



<p><a href="https://www.opb.org/article/2025/01/15/tesla-may-face-less-accountability-for-crashes-under-trump">https://www.opb.org/article/2025/01/15/tesla-may-face-less-accountability-for-crashes-under-trump</a></p>



<p>Of further interest, the Tesla feature to brake after a crash has occurred (automatic emergency braking) can be disengaged by pressing the accelerator pedal. The Tesla’s onboard data reports that the accelerator pedal was pressed 95-100% continuously for 10 seconds after the collision. A witness reports that the Tesla’s front wheels were spinning while up in the air, which means that no brake was being applied, even after the impact where the motorcyclist was pinned beneath the vehicle.</p>



<p>This is a tragically easy mistake to make, for a driver dazed and confused in a crash situation. It’s amazing that no technical system enforces braking in a more difficult-to-override way when sensors detect a crash has occurred.</p>



<h3>August 2023, Green Cove Springs FL:</h3>



<p><strong>NHTSA Report ID 13781-6205.</strong></p>



<p>The self-driving subject vehicle is a 2023 Tesla Model Y. Details are extremely scant, just what is unredacted in the NHTSA reporting. I really wish we had access to the unredacted data!</p>



<p>This one, I do not include in our fatality totals. The injury severity was reported to the NHTSA as “unknown.” The airbags on the Tesla deployed during a crash involving a motorcycle, which is consistent with serious or fatal injuries to motorcycle riders, but we just can’t know for sure with the data redactions.</p>



<p>I couldn’t find any local news coverage for the crash in rural Florida in several hours of trying. If anybody knows more about this case, please let me know on the <a href="https://fuelarc.com/contact/">Contact</a> page!</p>



<p>I include this case to point out: there are countless Tesla self-driving crashes where the data is so heavily redacted that it is simply not possible to tell what is going on. That’s why I say there are “at least 5” self-driving Tesla accidents that have killed motorcyclists, I highly suspect that some of those “unknown” or redacted data points are motorcycle crashes.</p>



<h3>August 2022, Boca Raton FL:</h3>



<p><strong>NHTSA Report ID 13781-3713.</strong></p>



<p>The self-driving subject vehicle is a 2020 Tesla Model 3. The Tesla fatally struck a motorcyclist from behind at above 100MPH on a 45MPH speed limit road in suburban Boca Raton. The motorcyclist was properly stopping at a yellow light, according to police reports.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.palmbeachpost.com/story/news/crime/2025/02/12/boca-raton-attorney-richard-dorfman-who-killed-motorcyclist-ingrid-noon-tesla-gets-2-year-plea-deal/78411624007">https://www.palmbeachpost.com/story/news/crime/2025/02/12/boca-raton-attorney-richard-dorfman-who-killed-motorcyclist-ingrid-noon-tesla-gets-2-year-plea-deal/78411624007</a></p>



<p>The driver was arrested for vehicular homicide and DUI manslaughter charges just under a year after the fatal crash. He plead guilty, reducing a potential sentence of 30 years to just 2 years in prison. In his guilty plea, he specified that he was relying on Tesla’s self-driving technology while intoxicated.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/17/business/tesla-motorcycle-crashes-autopilot/index.html">https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/17/business/tesla-motorcycle-crashes-autopilot/index.html</a></p>



<p>You might wonder how a vehicle with self-driving technology was traveling more than double the speed limit into a yellow light with a motorcyclist braking in front of them. This <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/p6m2q9/advanced_autopilot_question_what_does_the/">Reddit thread explains the feature</a>. </p>



<p>Certain Tesla self-driving technologies are speed capped, but others are not. Simply pressing the accelerator will raise your speed in certain modes, and as we saw in the police filings from the Washington State case, pressing the accelerator also cancels emergency braking. </p>



<p>That’s how you would strike a motorcyclist at such extreme speed, simply press the accelerator and all other inputs are apparently overridden.</p>



<h3>July 2022, Bluffdale UT:</h3>



<p><strong>NHTSA Report ID 13781-3488.</strong></p>



<p>The self-driving subject vehicle is a 2020 Tesla Model 3. The Tesla fatally struck a motorcyclist from behind on a Utah highway. Final speed of the Tesla prior to crashing into the motorcyclist was reported to the NHTSA was 61MPH.</p>



<p><a href="https://kjzz.com/news/local/motorcyclist-dies-after-being-hit-by-tesla-reportedly-on-autopilot">https://kjzz.com/news/local/motorcyclist-dies-after-being-hit-by-tesla-reportedly-on-autopilot</a></p>



<p>The driver reports that they did not see the motorcyclist, which will sound immediately familiar to any of my readers who are motorcyclists. As is typical in fatal motorcycle crashes with no exacerbating human factors like alcohol or distraction, we could find no record that charges were filed.</p>



<p>This accident was probed by the NHTSA’s investigation teams.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/midwest/2022/08/08/679062.htm">https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/midwest/2022/08/08/679062.htm</a></p>



<h3>April 2022, reported to the NHTSA as an unknown city in Florida:</h3>



<p><strong>NHTSA Report ID 13781-3470.</strong></p>



<p>The self-driving subject vehicle is a 2020 Tesla Model Y.</p>



<p>I can find literally zero news reporting on this fatal accident involving a Tesla self-driving vehicle, so we need to rely on the NHTSA data to assemble the narrative. It’s starting to become apparent why this data is so heavily redacted, connecting the dots is difficult!</p>



<p>The Tesla was traveling straight on a highway when it was involved in a fatal crash with a motorcycle. No further details are available. This is the only motorcycle fatality reported to the NHTSA where we are not certain that they were rear-ended by the Tesla.</p>



<p>The address of the crash was redacted as “[MAY CONTAIN PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION]” which limits our ability to locate the narrative details.</p>



<h3>July 2022, Riverside CA:</h3>



<p><strong>NHTSA Report ID 13781-3332.</strong></p>



<p>The self-driving subject vehicle is a 2021 Tesla Model Y. The Tesla fatally struck a motorcyclist from behind in the HOV lane on a California freeway.</p>



<p><a href="https://techxplore.com/news/2022-08-agency-probes-tesla-motorcyclists.html">https://techxplore.com/news/2022-08-agency-probes-tesla-motorcyclists.html</a></p>



<p>This is an alarmingly common trend in our analysis. Not an edge-case, no difficult weather or lighting conditions, simply a self-driving Tesla killing a motorcyclist by rear-ending them at speed.</p>



<p>This accident was probed by the NHTSA’s investigation teams.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/midwest/2022/08/08/679062.htm">https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/midwest/2022/08/08/679062.htm</a></p>







<h2>Engineering Failures and Human Error Cascade to Cause Fatal Self-Driving Accidents</h2>



<p>Self-driving Teslas developed such a reputation for ramming into parked emergency vehicles from behind that the <a href="https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2023/RCLRPT-23V838-8276.PDF">NHTSA launched an investigation in 2022</a>. Confusingly, the NHTSA is <em>currently </em>investigating whether the subsequent recall was effective. What the agency uncovered through close analysis of the unredacted self-driving crash data went far beyond firetrucks and police cruisers.</p>



<p>As part of its review, the Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) at the NHTSA found that Teslas had a general tendency to experience “frontal plane crashes.” Essentially, driving straight into obstacles in their path. </p>



<p>The issue wasn’t limited to emergency vehicles. Teslas using self-driving software were crashing into all sorts of things: barriers, stopped cars, <em>and motorcycles</em>.</p>



<p>The NHTSA extensively reviewed Tesla’s self-driving crash data, which it has unredacted access to. The findings? A vast majority of these crashes occurred in situations where a visible hazard should have been detected and avoided well before impact.</p>



<h4>Self-Driving Teslas Have Plenty of Time to Avoid Frontal-Plane Crashes… They Just Don’t</h4>



<p>Here’s a telling table from <a href="https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2023/RCLRPT-23V838-8276.PDF">the NHTSA report</a>, showing that <strong>fully 93% of hazards</strong> in crashes would have been visible to a human in time to either avoid the accident entirely or at least take action to mitigate the severity of the accident:</p>



<figure><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="624" height="207" src="https://fuelarc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/frontal-plane-visible-hazard-table.png" alt="" srcset="https://fuelarc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/frontal-plane-visible-hazard-table.png 624w, https://fuelarc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/frontal-plane-visible-hazard-table-300x100.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px"></figure>



<p>The government’s report has this damning quote, couched in dense bureaucratic language:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“In certain circumstances when Autosteer is engaged, if a driver misuses the SAE Level 2 advanced driver-assistance feature such that they fail to maintain continuous and sustained responsibility for vehicle operation and are unprepared to intervene, fail to recognize when the feature is canceled or not engaged, and/or fail to recognize when the feature is operating in situations where its functionality may be limited, there may be an increased risk of a collision.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In the case of the motorcycle crashes, the pattern is clear: Tesla’s self-driving technology either fails to detect the motorcyclist or does not apply the brakes once the motorcycle is detected. The human driver, meanwhile, is responsible for stepping in and braking manually… a task they fail to complete, because they are not paying attention, a situation which the Tesla’s attention detection system has also failed to recognize. When both the technology and the human backup fail, the result is a fatal collision.</p>



<p>This is a natural <em>and enragingly obvious</em> outcropping of Level 2 self-driving technology. <em>Of course</em> drivers will get bored of watching their car drive itself for hours on end. Simply having a hand on the wheel is not a sufficient measure of the driver paying attention, and Tesla’s other technical measures apparently do not work reliably. Motorcyclists pay for that stupid design decision with their lives.</p>



<h2>Watch a Tesla Freak Out in FSD Mode Behind a Motorcyclist</h2>



<p>Sometimes, seeing the technology in action helps illustrate what’s going wrong. In this video, a Tesla running a recent version of its <em>unfortunately named </em>“Full Self-Driving” (FSD) software behaves erratically when following a motorcycle.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Did Tesla FSD v12.3.6 Forget How to Drive Behind a Motorcycle?! Very Weird..." width="800" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0G6dofV3Jh8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0G6dofV3Jh8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Watch the clip here.</a></p>



<p>The Tesla appears to struggle with maintaining a consistent follow distance. At times, it leaves an absurdly long gap between itself and the motorbike, which could be an indication that the system is compensating for weak sensor performance when detecting range on motorcycles.</p>



<p>The video creator even calls attention to the odd behavior, and the comment section is full of people reporting similar experiences… along with the usual Tesla defenders who downplay or dismiss the issue, or attack the video as a fraud. Whether those defenders are diehard fans, bots, or a mix of both is up for debate.</p>



<p>The bottom line? Tesla’s self-driving technology has serious issues with detecting and responding safely to motorcycles. When the system struggles, it leaves human drivers to pick up the slack when they have been lulled into inattention by a false sense of competency from the self-driving system. That’s a deadly combination, as evidenced by five (or more) fatal Tesla collisions with motorcyclists.</p>



<p>Of course, all of us are watching Tesla’s planned rollout of self-driving taxis <em>with no human driver</em>, <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1906727530607808546">slated for Austin in less than 60 days</a>. If you’re a motorcycle rider like me, you might avoid the city limits of Austin TX for a minute, just to see how things shake out.</p>
