<p dir="auto"><strong>Don't let your resume be a roadblock from getting your next job. Use Resume Matcher!</strong></p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/srbhr/Resume-Matcher/blob/main/Assets/img/Resume_Matcher_Gif.gif"><img src="https://github.com/srbhr/Resume-Matcher/raw/main/Assets/img/Resume_Matcher_Gif.gif" alt="Resume_Matcher_streamlit_demo" data-animated-image=""></a></p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How does it work?</h2>
</div>
<p dir="auto">The Resume Matcher takes your resume and job descriptions as input, parses them using Python, and mimics the functionalities of an ATS, providing you with insights and suggestions to make your resume ATS-friendly.</p>
<p dir="auto">The process is as follows:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Parsing</strong>: The system uses Python to parse both your resume and the provided job description, just like an ATS would.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Keyword Extraction</strong>: The tool uses advanced machine learning algorithms to extract the most relevant keywords from the job description. These keywords represent the skills, qualifications, and experiences the employer seeks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Key Terms Extraction</strong>: Beyond keyword extraction, the tool uses textacy to identify the main key terms or themes in the job description. This step helps in understanding the broader context of what the resume is about.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Vector Similarity Using Qdrant</strong>: The tool uses <a href="https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant">Qdrant</a>, a highly efficient vector similarity search tool, to measure how closely your resume matches the job description. The more similar they are, the higher the likelihood that your resume will pass the ATS screening.</p>
</li>

<p dir="auto"><strong>Note</strong>: For local versions, you do not need to run "streamlit_second.py" as it is specifically for deploying to Streamlit servers.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Additional Note</strong>: The Vector Similarity part is precomputed to optimize performance due to the resource-intensive nature of sentence encoders that require significant GPU and RAM resources. If you are interested in leveraging this feature in a Google Colab environment for free, refer to the upcoming blog (link to be provided) for further guidance.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Privacy activist group noyb (None Of Your Business) has filed a data protection complaint against Meta over the "Pay or Okay" subscription model, one it reckons is now being considered by many of Meta's rivals.</p>
<p>The <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://noyb.eu/en/noyb-files-gdpr-complaint-against-meta-over-pay-or-okay">complaint</a> was filed with the Austrian data protection authority. The gist is that the right to privacy is a fundamental right, and making a customer pay – up to €251.88 ($275) annually, according to noyb – for that right somewhat defeats the object.</p>
<p>Felix Mikolasch, data protection lawyer at noyb, said: "EU law requires that consent is the genuine free will of the user. Contrary to this law, Meta charges a 'privacy fee' of up to €250 per year if anyone dares to exercise their fundamental right to data protection."</p>

    

<p>At the end of October, Meta told web users of its platforms in the EU, EEA, and Switzerland that for €9.99 per month it would <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/10/31/meta_ad_free_europe/">stop slurping their personal data</a> for marketing purposes and serving ads to them. The price was higher for mobile users and will rise further in 2024 for additional accounts.</p>

        


        

<p>Meta wanted cash to stop pulling in users' data, which seems at odds with the spirit of regulatory rulings, prompting noyb to file a complaint.</p>
<p>The privacy activists disclosed some alarming statistics and warned that Meta's rivals are closely monitoring how the subscription plans pan out. It noted that TikTok was reportedly also trying out an ad-free subscription outside the United States.</p>

        

<p>Going further, the group extrapolated Google research, showing that the average person had 35 apps on their smartphone. It said: "If all of these apps followed Meta's lead and charged a similar fee, people would have to pay a 'fundamental rights fee' of €8,815.80 a year."</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/01/eu_data_meta_networking/">Europe bans Meta from using personal data to target ads</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/07/norway_meta_fine/">Norway court upholds miniscule fine against Meta for flouting privacy rules</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/08/02/meta_eu_gdpr_advertising/">Meta says it'll ask Euro peeps nicely before hitting them with personalized ads</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/11/eu_us_data_pipeline/">EU gives its blessing to reopen data pipelines to the US</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The point is well made. Just as video streaming service costs have increased over the years, we can well imagine others looking to swell their coffers in the name of privacy.</p>
<p>Noyb noted that Meta put its average revenue per user in Europe at around €62.88 per year, considerably less than the amount it expects those users to pay for the privilege of not having their personal data studied.</p>
<p><i>The Register</i> asked Meta for comment. We were given this statement from the company's earlier <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://about.fb.com/news/2023/10/facebook-and-instagram-to-offer-subscription-for-no-ads-in-europe/">blog</a> on the matter: "The option for people to purchase a subscription for no ads balances the requirements of European regulators while giving users choice and allowing Meta to continue serving all people in the EU, EEA and Switzerland.</p>
<p>"In its ruling, the CJEU expressly recognised that a subscription model, like the one we are announcing, is a valid form of consent for an ads funded service."</p>

        

<p>The Meta spokesperson also pointed out that its pricing was in line with those of ad-free services such as YouTube Premium and Spotify Premium. "The subscriptions model is well established, and has already been endorsed by the Court of Justice of the European Union."</p>
<p>For its part, noyb is not backing down. Lawyer and privacy activist Max Schrems said: "Fundamental rights are usually available to everyone. How many people would still exercise their right to vote if they had to pay €250 to do so? There were times when fundamental rights were reserved for the rich. It seems Meta wants to take us back for more than a hundred years."</p>
<p>Or one could just uninstall Facebook, delete one's account, and walk away from the whole mess. ®</p>

The open-source Roundcube webmail software project has "merged" with Nextcloud, the prominent open-source personal cloud software.
</p><p>
In boosting Nextcloud's webmail software capabilities, Roundcube is joining Nextcloud as what's been described as a merger. In 2024 Nextcloud is to invest into Roundcube to accelerate the development of this widely-used webmail open-source software. Today's press release says Roundcube will not replace Nextcloud Mail with at least no plans for merging the two in the short-term.
</p><p>
Today's press release says that there are no immediate changes for Roundcube and Nextcloud users besides looking forward to improved integration and accelerated development beginning in the short term.
</p><p><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=2023&amp;image=roundcube" alt="RoundCube"></p>
<p>More details on today's announcement via the <a href="https://nextcloud.com/blog/open-source-email-pioneer-roundcube-comes-aboard-nextcloud/">Nextcloud blog</a>.
</p><p>
Perhaps with this increased investment into Roundcube, some of the original plans laid out years ago with <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/RoundCube-Next-Drags-On">the crowdfunded Roundcube-Next</a> will finally be realized. RoundCube-Next raised more than $100k in funding a number of years ago only to <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/RoundCube-Next-2018">fail in delivering their revamped software</a>.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>We are thrilled to announce that <a href="https://roundcube.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roundcube</a> project has found a new home with Nextcloud. Becoming a new steward for a popular webmail client trusted in highly regulated industries and among security-savvy users alike, we set sail to foster the growth and improvement of the project. This brings about a new milestone for global IT decentralization. Read on to understand why.</p>



<h2>Redefining email security with Roundcube</h2>



<p>Just like any communication and productivity software, the email is being consumed by technology giants seeking to monopolize the daily tools companies and individuals use for work. Email communication is <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/04/20/why-does-email-still-exist-ai-improvements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as relevant as ever</a> and remains a tidbit for user acquisition. Without equally viable alternatives, businesses, governments, and individual users will slowly lose the grip on their own data.</p>

<h3>What is Roundcube?</h3>



<p>Roundcube is a multilingual IMAP client with an application-like UI that offers MIME support, address book, folders, message search and spell checking. It provides ample security and privacy protection, including PGP, XSS resistance and brute force protection.</p>
</div></div>

<p>As a self-hosted solution, Roundcube offers a standard of privacy and security in mail communication that is seeing an unfortunate decline at the modern workplace. Its capabilities find application in highly regulated industries like education and government. </p>



<p>The client is a choice of notable universities including Harvard, Cambridge, Tata Institute in Mumbai, University of Victoria and government administrations with examples like India and the European Commission. CPanel includes Roundcube, enabling hosting via numerous service providers like HostGator, OVH, Telekom Italy and GoDaddy. It is the default mail system of the popular Synology NAS devices.</p>



<p>A partnership between privacy-centered projects like Nextcloud and Roundcube draws a complete picture of a decentralized collaboration ecosystem empowered by synergy of shared vision.</p>



<h2>What this partnership means to the community</h2>



<p>Before choice becomes an illusion, developers of independent solutions need to consolidate their efforts to establish a counter-force. Behind the new partnership stands our shared community-powered mission to respond to challenges brought by technological centralization, both for the public and private sector but also for private users.</p>

<p>Together we can bring a new perspective to the digital Europe as a whole. And the collaboration grows the Nextcloud-led Coalition for a Level Playing Field, our <a href="https://antitrust.nextcloud.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">anti-trust campaign</a> which filed complaints about the anti-competitive behavior of Big Tech to the European Union and the German government.</p>



<h2>Next steps for Roundcube and Nextcloud</h2>



<p>The plan for the upcoming year includes the adaptation and advancement of Rouncube to create a complete offering that will fit a wide range of users. That involves continuous investment to accelerate and oversee the development process while serving the common vision the two projects have.</p>

<p>What sets this collaboration apart is that both projects focus on user empowerment. Using Nextcloud or Roundcube, users can anticipate increased autonomy and control over their digital experiences. Both projects will continue to focus on self-hosting and privacy, as well as great user experiences.</p>



<p>Our short-term plan is to boost development, hiring some new team members for Roundcube. We also hope to support and grow the contributing community, inviting new talent to boost the development and health of the project.</p>



<p>As a product, Roundcube has an established path to success on its own. With opportunities remaining to be explored, a direct merger between Roundcube and Nextcloud is not planned. Neither will Roundcube replace Nextcloud Mail or the other way around. The products both have strengths and weaknesses and as open source products they already do share some underlying libraries and tools, but remain independent offerings for overlapping but different use scenarios. Nextcloud Mail will evolve as it is, focused on being used naturally within Nextcloud. Roundcube will continue to serve its active and new users as a stand-alone secure mail client.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I‘ve been following the development of Nextcloud and Frank‘s tireless efforts for free software for years. It was the first name to come to my mind when I started thinking about the future of Roundcube.”</p>
<cite>Frank Karlitschek and Thomas Brüderli, founders of Nextcloud and Roundcube respectively, discuss the past, the present, and the future of this partnership. <a href="https://nextcloud.com/blog/roundcubes-future-at-nextcloud-an-interview-with-the-founders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Read full interview</a></cite></blockquote>



<h2>Join the discussion</h2>



<p>Roundcube community members, including users and contributors, are welcome to to join the conversation. As a new playground, we offer a separate Roundcube section on the Nextcloud forum where you can raise issues, start discussions, and get in touch with Nextcloud.</p>

He noted that this CPU slows down when writing from the first <code>0x10</code> bytes of each page:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="shell"><span><span>offset milliseconds

In which also pointed to <code>rep movsb</code>:</p><blockquote><p>I've found this using a memcpy benchmark at <a href="https://github.com/ska-sa/katgpucbf/blob/69752be58fb8ab0668ada806e0fd809e782cc58b/scratch/memcpy_loop.cpp">https://github.com/ska-sa/katgpucbf/blob/69752be58fb8ab0668ada806e0fd809e782cc58b/scratch/memcpy_loop.cpp</a> (compiled with the adjacent Makefile).

Python outperforms C/Rust due to an AMD CPU bug. (I can finally get some sleep now.)</p><p>However, our users continue to struggle with this problem. Unfortunately, features like <code>FSRM</code> will be implemented in <code>ucode</code>, leaving us no choice but to wait for AMD's response. An alternative solution could be not using <code>FSRM</code> or providing a flag to disable it. Rust developers might consider switching to <code>jemallocator</code> for improved performance - a beneficial move even without the presence of AMD CPU bugs.</p><p>I spent nearly three days addressing this issue, which began with complaints from <a href="https://github.com/apache/incubator-opendal">opendal</a> users and eventually led me to the CPU's ucode.</p><p>This journey taught me a lot about <code>strace</code>, <code>perf</code> and <code>eBPF</code>. It was my first time using <code>eBPF</code> for diagnostics.

<p>Work can be full of stressors from tough assignments to career setbacks, but one of the most challenging situations is when you must work with someone you don’t like, don’t get along with or are annoyed by.</p>


<p>Problems with colleagues seem to be on the rise. In fact, 84% of people reported they have worked with a toxic teammate and 87% have worked with a toxic boss, according to a poll by <a href="https://www.flexjobs.com/blog/post/toxic-managers-coworkers-make-toxic-workplace" target="_blank" title="https://www.flexjobs.com/blog/post/toxic-managers-coworkers-make-toxic-workplace" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.flexjobs.com/blog/post/toxic-managers-coworkers-make-toxic-workplace" aria-label="FlexJobs">FlexJobs</a>. And 74% of Americans believe civility and good manners have deteriorated, based on research by the <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/04/160422201040.htm" target="_blank" title="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/04/160422201040.htm" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/04/160422201040.htm" aria-label="University of Chicago">University of Chicago</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tracybrower/2023/08/27/powerful-strategies-to-improve-your-communication-skills" target="_self" title="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tracybrower/2023/08/27/powerful-strategies-to-improve-your-communication-skills" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/tracybrower/2023/08/27/powerful-strategies-to-improve-your-communication-skills" aria-label="Figuring out how to work well">Figuring out how to work well </a>with co-workers is important for your effectiveness at work, but it’s also critical to your health and wellbeing. When people demonstrate incivility at work—for example, sarcasm, demeaning interactions, interrupting or rudeness—their behavior can cause stress as well as sleeplessness at night, based on research published in <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41542-018-0030-8" target="_blank" title="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41542-018-0030-8" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41542-018-0030-8" aria-label="Occupational Health Science"><em data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41542-018-0030-8">Occupational Health Science</em></a>. And bad behavior can also result in wellbeing problems such as anxiety (51%), fatigue (44%) and even physical challenges (33%)—as well as declines in productivity and engagement—according to the FlexJobs poll.</p>


<p>But even if someone isn’t demonstrating bad behavior, they can still cause you challenges when you dislike their approach or feel devalued when you’re interacting with them.</p>

<p>Here’s how to bring your best, even when you’re working with a difficult teammate you can’t avoid.</p>

<h2>1 - Demonstrate Respect</h2>
<p>Perhaps most important it to start with respect. The colleague may be tough to handle, but when you demonstrate respect and integrity, you’ll reap strong benefits in terms of your own integrity and credibility. People generally notice interactions among others and when you take the high road, others will credit you with your ability to address challenges and behave professionally, even in the face of difficulty.</p>
<p>In addition to your own sense of integrity, another reason to start with respect is because you have an ability to influence your co-worker—perhaps more than you realize. In terms of human relationships, the primary way we learn is through watching, listening and experiencing other people. So how you choose to interact will set the tone for the relationship and potentially positively impact your co-worker as well.</p>

<p>You may also find it easier to demonstrate respect if you can find even one or two redeeming qualities for the person. Perhaps they are overly aggressive, but you can appreciate how they stand their ground. Or perhaps they interrupt you, but you can value their enthusiasm and passion in expressing themselves. It may be tough, but finding things to value will ultimately help your own peace of mind and potentially carry over to the relationship as well.</p>


<p>And of course, when you disagree, focus on the problem or the process, rather than the person. Keep things at the task level as much as possible—and this can help you get through difficulties.</p><figure role="presentation"><figcaption><fbs-accordion><p>When you're working with someone difficult, start with respect.</p></fbs-accordion><small>getty</small></figcaption></figure> 
<h2>2 - Maintain Perspective</h2>
<p>Another fundamental way to work successfully with a colleague you find difficult is to maintain perspective—on several fronts.</p>

<ul>
 <li><em>Timing</em>. Remind yourself you won’t have to work with the person forever. Given the high turnover in roles and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tracybrower/2023/10/29/when-should-you-quit-your-job-the-best-time-to-resign" target="_self" title="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tracybrower/2023/10/29/when-should-you-quit-your-job-the-best-time-to-resign" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/tracybrower/2023/10/29/when-should-you-quit-your-job-the-best-time-to-resign" aria-label="frequency of job changes">frequency of job changes</a>, you’re likely to move on to another job or see your co-worker move on within a reasonably short time—so remind yourself of this.</li>
 <li><em>Relationships</em>. Also remind yourself of all the great relationships you have with other teammates. This situation is likely unique and not typical of your ability to work successfully with the majority of people.</li>
 <li><em>Human Nature</em>. It’s natural to get along with some more easily than others, and there is certainly credence to what we think of as chemistry between people. There will be those you click with immediately and others with whom you struggle. Give yourself permission to have differences in the ways you relate.</li>
</ul>

<p>By maintaining your perspective, you can also sustain your own confidence. Avoid taking their behavior personally and remind yourself of your terrific value despite interactions with this person.</p>
<h2>3 - Seek Learning</h2>
<p>Another effective way to work with someone you find difficult is to seek to learn from the interactions. Each time you’re challenged, reflect on how you could have done better and explore how you might grow your own skills—in listening, empathy or tolerance.</p>
<p>Also reflect on why the person triggers you. Sometimes there is a similarity to your own areas for development—and what annoys you about them can help highlight ways you can grow. For example, their lack of follow through may drive you crazy, but you realize that you can work on your own responsiveness as well.</p>
<p>In addition, consider how you might learn from the way the other person is showing up. If they interrupt you or devalue you, use these behaviors to reinforce the importance of how you positively interact as an alternative. If they take credit for your work, remind yourself of how you want to consistently value other’s contributions. Sometimes, learning what not to do is as powerful as seeing what works better.</p>
<p>Also stay open and humble. If you’d decided you don’t like someone, it’s possible you’re jumping to conclusions about their behavior or making assumptions about their motives. Be sure to stay open to their viewpoints and try to bring a fresh start to every interaction.</p><figure role="presentation"><figcaption><fbs-accordion><p>The way you interact will have a strong influence on others.</p></fbs-accordion><small>getty</small></figcaption></figure> 
<h2>4 - Be Empathetic</h2>
<p>Another strategy to deal with someone you find difficult is to be intentional about expressing empathy—considering how they may be feeling (emotional empathy) or what they might be thinking (cognitive empathy).</p>
<p>Consider sitting down with them and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tracybrower/2023/08/20/the-power-of-being-proactive-5-ways-to-develop-this-surprising-skill" target="_self" title="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tracybrower/2023/08/20/the-power-of-being-proactive-5-ways-to-develop-this-surprising-skill" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/tracybrower/2023/08/20/the-power-of-being-proactive-5-ways-to-develop-this-surprising-skill" aria-label="talking through your work together">talking through your work together</a>, describing how their behavior is impacting you—and listening to their experiences. It’s possible their intention doesn’t match their impact, and that you can improve how you behave as well.</p>
<p>When you seek to understand, you’ll actually contribute to your own mental health as well as build the relationship. Remind yourself that you don’t know all the other person is going through. If you find them difficult, they may be going through especially challenging times outside of work and they’re trying to cope.</p>
<p>Also assume they have good intentions. Especially if they’re going through a lot of their own issues, their behavior toward you may not be as much about you as it is an unintentional expression of their own difficulties.</p>
<p>Of course, they must still be accountable for their behavior, but being patient, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tracybrower/2023/11/13/what-is-world-kindness-day-and-how-can-you-celebrate-at-work" target="_self" title="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tracybrower/2023/11/13/what-is-world-kindness-day-and-how-can-you-celebrate-at-work" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/tracybrower/2023/11/13/what-is-world-kindness-day-and-how-can-you-celebrate-at-work" aria-label="demonstrating kindness">demonstrating kindness</a> and giving them a greater level of understanding can be helpful.</p>
<h2>5 - Let Go</h2>
<p>It’s also wise to learn to let go. Work takes up a lot of your time and you want to accomplish great things, but you will also need to establish a healthy boundary so you can be your best and avoid stewing on the problems with the person.</p>
<p>Take a walk during the day or get together for coffee with a supportive colleague. Outside of work, make time for things that help you rejuvenate—from creative pursuits to exercise or volunteer efforts.</p>
<h2>Move Forward</h2>
<p>It’s rare that every single person you work with will be in perfect alignment with your values, approaches or preferences for interaction, but you can focus on learning and keeping relationships constructive.</p>
<p>Know that you don’t have all the answers and challenge yourself to be open to others, even when you don’t agree with them.</p>
<p>And don’t underestimate the value of time—to smooth the relationship as you get used to working together or to take you to the next project with different teammates.</p>

Everything he said on stage was compelling. This promised to be a very fast, very flashy, very capable car, and at the quarter million asking price, would embarrass pretty much every sports car on the market in acceleration and likely lap times at most tracks. If you had the money, why wouldn’t you put a deposit down and wait a couple years to pick up your new speed machine? </p><p>From Q1 2017 through Q1 2018, Tesla was losing $7,430 per minute. The company was just figuring out how to get Model 3 production up and running, and that cost a whole lot of money. Elon Musk admitted that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/03/musk-tesla-was-about-a-month-from-bankruptcy-during-model-3-ramp.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/03/musk-tesla-was-about-a-month-from-bankruptcy-during-model-3-ramp.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the company was “less than a month from bankruptcy”</a></span> at the time. If you’re a company in dire straits, and cash is key to your survival, you’ll do anything to get your hands on some, right? Would you make up some specs about some new products and pass a hat around the room to get some “deposits” for your wildly unrealistic promises? </p><p>The Tesla Semi event, at which the Roadster was launched, might have been the turning point for the company. Rather than selling off some of his ownership of the company, Musk sold promises at $250,000 a piece, and has yet to honor them. Tesla had a Kickstarter campaign, and it’s not delivering perks. That quarter billion just for the Founders Edition cars probably helped the company quite a bit, and there’s no telling how many $50,000 deposits the company got and still holds. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.npr.org/2023/08/10/1193331363/is-this-a-bank&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.npr.org/2023/08/10/1193331363/is-this-a-bank" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Much the same way Starbucks isn’t really a coffee company</a></span>, Tesla isn’t really a car company. </p><p>Tesla is a promise company. It makes promises to its customers, various governments, and other businesses. Those promises require up-front payment, and whether they come to fruition or not, the company keeps the money while continually blowing through deadlines. </p><p>It’s been six years since the Roadster was unveiled, and we haven’t seen so much as prototype out testing or putting in Nürburgring laps or whatever. If I’d handed over a deposit to Tesla, I’d be pretty perturbed about it. Hell, even the bizarre Cybertruck was introduced in 2019 and allegedly will reach some customers this month, and the Semi has been in use by Pepsi and others for a while now. Roadster buyers, when are you getting your car? </p></div></div>]]></description>

<i><b>BBC BASIC for SDL 2.0</b></i> (BBCSDL) is an entirely <b>free</b> and <a href="https://github.com/rtrussell/BBCSDL">Open Source</a>
cross-platform implementation of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_BASIC" target="_blank">BBC BASIC</a> for <b>Windows</b>,
<b>MacOS</b>, <b>Linux</b> (x86 CPU only), <b>Raspberry Pi OS</b> (RPi3 or later), <b>Android</b>, <b>iOS</b> or for
running in a <b>browser</b>.
It combines the simplicity of BASIC with the sophistication
of a structured language, allowing you to write utilities and games, use
sound and graphics, and perform calculations.
</span>
<p>
<span size="4">
The <b>Desktop</b> editions (Windows, MacOS, Linux, Raspberry Pi) include
a BASIC program editor with syntax colouring, live indentation, search &amp; replace
and many other features.  Built-in diagnostic aids such as run-time trace, listing of
variables, single-step execution and a profiler make debugging even the most complex programs
straightforward.
</span>
</p><p>
<span size="4">
The <b>Android</b> and <b>iOS</b> editions, for smartphones and tablets, have a simplified interface
optimised for touchscreen control.  It too provides a BASIC program editor with syntax
colouring, live indentation, search &amp; replace and other features; see <a href="https://www.bbcbasic.co.uk/bbcsdl/android.html">
here</a> for more details.  The Android edition will run nicely on a (64-bit) Chromebook, 
particularly if you enable window resizing.
</span>
</p><p>
<span size="4">
The <b>in-browser</b> edition also uses the simplified interface, it is compatible with desktop
versions of <b>Brave</b>, <b>Chrome</b>, <b>Edge</b>, <b>Firefox</b>, <b>Opera</b>, <b>Safari</b> &amp; <b>Vivaldi</b>;
the Android versions of <b>Chrome</b> and <b>Firefox</b>, and with <b>Safari</b> on iOS.  It will also run on a Chromebook.
</span>
</p><p>
<span size="4">
The Android edition will also run on the <b>Amazon Fire TV</b> or <b>Fire TV Stick</b> and some smart TVs.
Several of the supplied example programs can be operated using the navigation wheel and
buttons on the remote control, including most of the games.  Any sounds or music created
by a BASIC program will be played through the speaker(s) of the attached TV.
</span>
</p><p>
<span size="4">
You can 'compile' your BASIC program to a standalone application bundle which will run without
BBC BASIC having to be installed (<b>.exe</b> file in Windows, <b>.dmg</b> file in MacOS, <b>.zip</b>
file in Linux or Raspberry Pi OS and <b>.apk</b> file in Android via the <a href="https://www.bbcbasic.co.uk/bbc2apk/index.html">BBC2APK utility</a>).
You can distribute such application bundles freely without any royalty for BBC BASIC being due.
</span>
</p><p>
<span size="4">
<i><b>BBC BASIC for SDL 2.0</b></i> is largely compatible with <a href="https://www.bbcbasic.co.uk/bbcwin/bbcwin.html"><i>BBC
BASIC for Windows</i></a>; it shares with that dialect many <b>new and advanced features</b>
including data structures, PRIVATE variables, an EXIT statment, long strings, event interrupts, an
address-of operator, byte variables, a line continuation character,
indirect procedure and function calls and improved numeric accuracy. 
It also retains a high degree of compatibility with the BBC Microcomputer, including
emulation of the <b>SOUND</b> and <b>ENVELOPE</b> statements, and the <b>MODE 7</b> (teletext) screen mode.
</span>
</p><p>
<span size="4">
Up to <b>256 Megabytes</b> of memory (<b>16 Mbytes</b> in the in-browser edition) is provided for the user's
program, data and stack (subject to sufficient RAM being available).  Unlike some older
versions of BASIC, you won't suffer the frustration of running out of memory!
Line numbers are optional.
</span>
</p><p>
<span size="4">
BBC BASIC incorporates an assembler* which can be used
when the speed or other capabilities of the interpreter are inadequate.  The assembler
depends on the CPU in your device: x86 (32-bit or 64-bit) for Windows, MacOS or Linux;
ARM (32-bit or 64-bit) for Raspberry Pi.  In the case of Android the assembler is ARM or x86
as appropriate.  You can access Application Program Interface (API) functions
from BASIC and from assembler code, allowing an experienced programmer to produce
sophisticated applications.
</span>
</p><p>
<span size="4">
<i>BBC BASIC for Windows</i> programs that call Operating System API functions, or that rely on libraries
that do not have a direct equivalent in both dialects, will need to be adapted in order to be compatible with
BBCSDL.  Also, programs that use the *FONT command will require a small alteration.  But otherwise
programs can be expected to run with little or no modification.  Of course, programs that incorporate 
assembly language code will not run on an ARM-based Android device or Raspberry Pi without significant changes.
Details of the differences between BB4W and BBCSDL may be found <a href="https://www.bbcbasic.co.uk/bbcsdl/differences.html">here</a>.

The <b>Windows</b> edition is available either as an installer or a Zip archive which simply needs to be extracted to a suitable place.
The <b>MacOS</b>, <b>Android</b> and <b>iOS</b> editions are self-installing.  The <b>Linux</b> and <b>Raspberry Pi</b> editions
must first be unzipped, and then installed according to the instructions in the supplied text file.  The <b>in-browser</b> edition needs no installation.

<article id="post-406103" itemtype="https://schema.org/CreativeWork" itemscope="itemscope">
<div itemprop="text">


<p><strong>UPDATE: Scroll down for a statement from WētāFX:</strong></p>
<p>Reuters is reporting that Unity Software (U.N) will eliminate 265 jobs or 3.8% of its global workforce and end an agreement with a digital video effects company founded by the “Lord of the Rings” director as part of a “reset”. This comes as a harsh blow for employees, coming as it does right before Christmas.</p>
<p>It was just in Dec ’21 that Unity <a href="https://www.fxguide.com/fxfeatured/unity-weta-deal/">completed its acquisition of Weta Digital’s tools, pipeline, technology, and engineering talent</a>. This acquisition was said to be “designed to empower the growing number of game developers, artists, and potentially millions of consumer creators with highly sophisticated content creation tools.” As part of that deal Unity ‘welcomed’ Weta Digital’s world-class engineering talent of 275 engineers who are known internationally for their architecting, building, and maintaining of Weta Digital tools and core pipeline. At the same time, Weta Digital’s Academy Award-Winning VFX teams moved into a standalone entity known as Wētā FX under majority ownership by Sir Peter Jackson and helmed by CEO Prem Akkaraju. At that time they issued a statement saying: “under the terms of the agreement, Unity acquired Weta Digital’s tools, pipeline, technology, and engineering talent for <strong>US$1.625B</strong> in a combination of cash and stock.” Their press release continued stating,&nbsp; “Unity will not be relocating employees with this acquisition and remains supportive and committed to Wellington, New Zealand.”</p>
<p>This week’s announcement includes the termination of the professional services piece of an agreement Unity struck with Wētā FX&nbsp; in 2021 after the purchase of the technology and engineering division. As a result, 265 employees whose jobs are related to the agreement will be laid off, the company said. Employees have only about a week to wrap up before their positions are terminated finally.</p>
<p>John Riccitiello retired as President, Chief Executive Officer, Chairman, and a member of the Company’s Board of Directors, at the start of October. James M. Whitehurst was appointed Interim Chief Executive Officer, President, and a member of the Board. Roelof Botha, Lead Independent Director of the Unity Board, was appointed Chairman.</p>
<p>When the deal happened it was seen by some as a reaction to the massive investment of time and energy that Epic Games had made into the M&amp;E space and that in one move Unity would establish itself as a major player in the professional M&amp;E market. As recently as August at SIGGRAPH in LA, Unity had major marketing efforts behind promoting the tech and tools Unity had acquired. At the conference they launched their new ‘Unity Wētā Tools’ division, which was said to have been set up to “deliver the most widely used and trusted solutions for artists to collaborate and create 2D and 3D content, will showcase the latest advancements, designed to make high-end VFX production and premium content creation accessible to creators.” At that time, Allan Poore, SVP of Unity Wētā Tools stated that “Unity is investing significantly in research and development, supporting ongoing innovation, and driving the future of content creation.”</p>
<p>In the Weta transaction, Unity acquired:</p>
<ul>
<li>Weta’s world-class engineering talent of engineers.</li>
<li>Dozens of industry-leading tools such as Manuka, Gazebo, Barbershop, Lumberjack, Loki, Squid, Koru, and more, all integrated seamlessly into Weta’s production pipeline;</li>
<li>A foundational data platform for interoperable 3D art creation, making it easy for hundreds of artists to work seamlessly together; and</li>
<li>A library of thousands of incredible assets that the WetaFX team will continue to accumulate as they create VFX in the years ahead.</li>
<li><em>For a more compete list of the tools acquired see <a href="https://www.fxguide.com/fxfeatured/unity-weta-deal/">our fxguide story</a></em></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>UPDATE Statement from WētāFX</strong></p>
<p><i>On November 25, 2023, Unity and Wētā FX mutually agreed to terminate Unity’s service</i> <i>agreement with Wētā FX effective December 10, 2023.</i> <i>This decision comes as Unity refocus their efforts on their core business. The termination of the</i> <i>agreement will see the reduction of 265 Unity roles.</i> <i>Wētā FX will be extending offers to as many of the team as possible as it looks to expand its</i> <i>research, development and support functions.</i> <i>Unity will retain ownership of the technology it acquired from Wētā in December 2021 and will</i> <i>be evaluating the best way to enhance its offerings with it over time.</i> <i>The technology will also remain fully available to Wētā FX. Wētā FX will continue to build and</i> <i>extend the IP, and develop its own tools and techniques, to continue its evolution as a leader in</i> <i>visual effects.</i></p>
<p><strong>What does this mean for Wētā Tools?</strong><br>
<em>Unity will continue to own the technology it acquired and will evaluate the best way to enhance its offerings over time.</em><br>
<em>Wētā Tools will remain fully available to Wētā FX. Wētā FX will have the right to build and extend the IP, and develop its own tools and techniques to continue its evolution as a leading innovator and creator in the visual effects industry.</em></p>
<p><strong>How will it work in terms of integrating the teams back into Wētā?</strong><br>
<em>We are looking to extend offers to as many of the Wētā Digital crew as we can. Joe Letteri and Kimball Thurston will continue to lead Wētā’s technology vision and roadmap. The roadmap and planning we have asked the team to work on so far does not change with this decision. We will continue to evolve the studio to enable our artists to be more efficient, unlocking their creative potential, and preparing us to continue to provide the best visual and studio experience.</em></p>
<p><strong>Is Wētā FX hiring back everyone?</strong><br>
<em>Unity’s need to refocus its efforts on its core business, and change in its relationship with Wētā FX was not something we had planned for. We are endeavoring to hire back as many crew as we can, however, there may be a few roles that we may not be able to accommodate within our new structure. Both Unity and Wētā FX will be offering support to those affected.</em></p>
<p><strong>When was this decision made?</strong><br>
<em>Unity initially approached Wētā FX on 26 October, 2023. Unity and Wētā FX reached agreement on 25 November, 2023.</em></p>
<p><strong>Why was this decision made?</strong><br>
<em>Unity believes the Wētā Digital team are remarkable, but Unity needs to become leaner as it focuses its expertise on its core business. It also believes it makes more sense for Wētā FX to own full end-to-end production activities directly. Unity will be focusing its expertise and people on other matters, and Wētā FX will be getting support for its use of the Wētā Tools directly from its own crew – a shorter path which makes sense for both companies.</em></p>
<p><strong>What’s happening to the Wētā Digital name?</strong><br>
<em>The Wētā Digital name and trademark will be coming back to Wētā FX however there is no plan to change Wētā FX’s name.</em></p>
<p>STATEMENT ENDS.</p>

<p>It is worth noting that there is no indication or even hint that the actual Unity Wētā Tools’ division engineers and staff were at any fault whatsoever.

<p>In addition, Unity will shut down offices in 14 locations such as Berlin and Singapore, pending employee consultation in some countries, and significantly reduce its office footprint for the remaining offices, including in San Francisco and Bellevue, Washington.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Many years ago, I did a brief stint at Google. A lot has changed since then, but even that brief exposure to Google's internal tools left a lasting impression on me. In many ways, the dev tools inside Google are the most advanced in the world. Google has been a pioneer not only in scaling their own software systems but in figuring out how to build software effectively at scale. They've dealt with issues related to codebase volume, code discoverability, organizational knowledge sharing, and multi-service deployment at a level of sophistication that most other companies have not yet reached. (For reference, see <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Software-Engineering-Google-Lessons-Programming/dp/1492082791" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Software Engineering at Google</a>.)</p>
<figure><img src="https://sourcegraph.com/blog/exgoogler-campfire.jpg" alt="Ex-Googler's guide to dev tools" title="Ex-Googler's guide to dev tools"></figure>
<p>In other ways, however, Google's internal tools are awfully limited. In particular, nearly all of them are tightly coupled with Google's internal environment. Unfortunately, that means you can't take them with you when you leave.</p>
<p>The Google diaspora has seeded so many other organizations with amazing talented people who bring lessons learned from working inside one of the world's leading technology organizations. But adapting to programming outside of Google can be tough, especially when you've come to rely on tools you no longer have at your disposal.</p>
<p>Over the years, I've learned from my own experience and the experience of lots of others who have left Google. Many of Sourcegraph's early customers began with an Xoogler missing code search after leaving Google. I worked closely with these people to understand the gap they were trying to fill, so that we could build Sourcegraph to meet their needs. Over time, patterns emerged in terms of how ex-Googlers sought to introduce new dev tools into their organizations, inspired by their experience with dev tools at Google. Some were successful and others were not.</p>
<p>I thought it would be helpful to write a guide to dev tools outside of Google for the ex-Googler, written with an eye toward pragmatism and practicality. No doubt many ex-Googlers wish they could simply clone the Google internal environment to their new company, but you can't boil the ocean. Here is my take on where you should start and a general path I think ex-Googlers can take to find the tools that will make them—and their new teams—as productive as possible</p>

<p>If you recently left Google to join another company, you probably have this overall sense of frustration that you're not as productive as you used to be. You feel you need to change <em>something</em>, but what is it? As a first step, you should think about what you do day to day and identify where the pain is coming from.</p>
<p>Both inside Google and out, the software development lifecycle looks something like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>You think of a feature you want to build or a bug you need to fix.</li>
<li>You read a bunch of code, design docs, and ask colleagues questions. You're building an understanding of the problem and how the solution will roughly fit into the existing system.</li>
<li>You start writing code. You aim first for something <em>just</em> working. Maybe you go back and look up docs or read some more code several times while you're doing this.</li>
<li>You have it working, but you're not ready to ship. You've broken some tests, which you now fix, you add some more tests, you refactor the code to make it cleaner and easier for the next person to understand. You push it up to a branch. You wait for CI to run and maybe you implement a couple of additional fixes and small improvements.</li>
<li>You submit the patch for review. Your teammates leave some comments. You make the changes. Maybe there are a few rounds of back-and-forth before the reviewer(s) approve the change.</li>
<li>You merge the patch and it gets deployed.</li>
<li>Monitoring systems that are in place will determine if there are any production issues. If it's your patch that caused an outage, you're on the hook for fixing it.</li>

<p>At every stage in this process, there is typically a tool that anchors the developer experience. Tools shape your work cycle and have an immense impact on your productivity.</p>

<p>To improve your productivity, you need to find better tools. There's a useful GitHub repository that identifies nearly every single tool inside Google and its closest comparables outside of Google: <a href="https://github.com/jhuangtw/xg2xg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a><a href="https://github.com/jhuangtw/xg2xg">https://github.com/jhuangtw/xg2xg</a>. This list is comprehensive, but a bit overwhelming. So where do you start?</p>

<p>In your first month, don't try to change anything. Just listen and learn the ropes.</p>
<p>As a new member of the team, you likely don't have the influence or authority to change <em>all</em> the tools your team uses. Moreover, you also lack knowledge—knowledge of how and why your new team behaves the way it does and why it uses its current set of tools. Simply copy-pasting Google internal tools is not necessarily going to work for your new team. So learn what <em>is</em> working for your new team along with what isn't.</p>
<h2 id="low-hanging-fruit">Low-hanging fruit</h2>
<p>I believe that code search is usually a great tool to start with. Yes, I am the cofounder of a code search company, so of course I would say that, but here are my reasons—if these don't resonate with you, then I recommend skipping to the next section!</p>
<ul>
<li>It's one of the tools ex-Googlers usually miss the most from their everyday lives.</li>
<li>You can try different code search engines on your own and validate that one is good before sharing it with others. This means you don't need to obtain approval from gatekeepers or expend precious social capital convincing others to try a tool you haven't started using yourself.</li>
<li>It won't require forcing others to change existing habits, because your new team doesn't yet have a code search tool. If they do, then it's either bad and they don't use it much, or it's good and you already have good code search, so skip this section!</li>
</ul>
<p>If your new company has more than a few teams in the organization, you're likely dealing with more code that you can reasonably grok as an individual person. And even if you're working in a much smaller company, chances are you're pulling in a ton of open-source code through your dependencies. This is all code that you will need to dive into at some point, when building a new feature or tracing the source of some critical bug.</p>
<p>Given the scale of code that nearly every developer has to deal with these days, it's no wonder that the lack of code search can quickly slow your development velocity to a crawl.</p>
<p>When evaluating code search engines, there are a few things to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Query language: Regular expressions are table stakes. You want to ensure the code search query language is both expressive and easy to use. Literal searches should be intuitive, and more advanced pattern matching should be available.</li>
<li>Scale: Ensure the code search engine scales to the size of your codebase. If your codebase is more than a few gigabytes, a key thing to look for is whether the code search engine uses a trigram index <a href="https://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp4.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a><a href="https://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp4.html">https://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp4.html</a>, because this is how you get regular expression matching working at the scale of a large codebase.</li>
<li>Code browsing: As a user of Google Code Search, you know that search is only half the story. Once you click through to a result, you want to be able to click around to jump to definitions and find references as easily as if you had checked out the code and set up the dev environment in your IDE. * Without great code browsing, you'll be context-switching between your editor and code search engine frequently.</li>
<li>Permissions: If your company enforces codebase permissions, you should consider whether your code search engine respects those.</li>
<li>Overall cost: Consider both the price of the code search engine and the maintenance overhead of keeping the tool online.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the common code search engines we've seen in use:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://oracle.github.io/opengrok/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">OpenGrok</a>: a fairly old but persistent code search engine now maintained by Oracle</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/hound-search/hound" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Hound</a>: a code search engine created and open-sourced by engineers at Etsy</li>
<li><a href="https://livegrep.com/search/linux" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Livegrep</a>: a code search engine created by Nelson Elhage at Stripe</li>
<li>And of course, <a href="https://about.sourcegraph.com/get-started/self-hosted">Sourcegraph</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="get-good-monitoring">Get good monitoring</h2>
<p>Another good early area to target is monitoring. Every engineer at some point has to deal with a production issue. Production is a very different place than development—you can't just set a breakpoint or add a printf and see the effect in seconds. Making updates to production is expensive along multiple dimensions: compute resources, developer time, and worst of all, pain to your users and customers.</p>
<p>Deployment has changed a lot in the past 5-10 years. Microservices, Kubernetes, moving to the Cloud—these are big shifts in how companies deploy software. Many companies have adopted these new paradigms and technologies, but they have not yet updated their monitoring infrastructure to make debugging in these new production environments easy.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there have been some great new open-source tools and companies in recent years that have vastly improved the state of monitoring and observability in the world outside of Google.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://prometheus.io/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Prometheus</a> is a time-series metrics tracker and visualizer that's similar to Borgmon. It lets you instrument your application to track metrics like CPU utilization, error rate, and p90 latency that change over time.</li>
<li><a href="https://grafana.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Grafana</a> is a dashboarding tool similar to Viceroy. A common situation is to connect Grafana with Prometheus, so you can construct a single-page view of a bunch of key metrics that indicate overall application health.</li>
<li>Google pioneered distributed tracing, an essential tool for increasingly common multi-service architectures, with Dapper. One of the creators of Dapper, Ben Sigelman, went on to start <a href="https://lightstep.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Lightstep</a>. Distributed tracing is now a feature of many monitoring systems, including paid offerings like <a href="https://www.honeycomb.io/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Honeycomb</a> and <a href="https://sentry.io/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Sentry</a> and open-source projects like <a href="https://www.jaegertracing.io/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Jaeger</a>, built by Uber engineers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Monitoring is a bit trickier to introduce than code search, since it has to be integrated into the production environment. This often involves changing the deployment environment, which probably means persuading the team that controls the deployment environment. It may also entail adding instrumentation code, which involves submitting patches to the various teams that own the code being instrumented. However, it is still easy in the sense that introducing a new tool doesn't require anyone to change existing habits. People are free to use the new tool or not, which eliminates a strong source of objections when you're trying to get the tool first deployed.</p>
<h2 id="after-youre-in-good-standing-code-review">After you're in good standing: code review</h2>
<p>Introducing code search and monitoring doesn't require asking anyone on the team to change existing workflows. Changing the code review tool, however, does.</p>
<p>Chances are that if you'd been at Google for awhile, the way that code review is done outside of Google has struck you as a little weird. GitHub Pull Requests is the most common code review tool, but ex-Googlers usually have a few complaints about it:</p>
<ol>
<li>It is not straightforward and sometimes not possible to view changes made since the last round of reviews. The easy path only lets you review the entire outstanding diff.</li>
<li>There is no support for stacked CRs.</li>
<li>The entire diff across all files in the changeset is displayed as one giant page, and it's hard to keep track of what hunks you've reviewed.</li>
<li>GitHub PRs are very unopinionated about how reviews should be done. Without adding additional third-party integrations, the review process can seem loosey-goosey, and even with third-party integrations, it still may lack the ability to enforce finer grained review and sign-off policies.</li>
<li>There is limited fuzzy jump-to-def or find-references for certain languages, but it is nowhere near the level that Critique supports inside of Google.</li>
</ol>
<p>The closest thing to Critique you can get outside of Google is Gerrit. Gerrit began life as a fork of Rietveld, which itself was an open-source fork of Google's original code review tool, Mondrian. It should therefore feel very familiar, as it descends from a line of tools that were created to support the exact way that Google does code review.</p>
<p>Phabricator is another code review tool that ex-Googlers often prefer to GitHub Pull Requests. Phabricator began life as Facebook's internal code review tool and was subsequently open-sourced and released to the outside world. There's also a company behind it, <a href="https://phacility.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Phacility</a>, that offers hosted instances and support, in case you don't want to be on the hook for maintaining your own instance.</p>
<p>Another tool worth looking into is <a href="https://reviewable.io/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Reviewable</a>, created by ex-Googler Piotr Kaminski. Unlike Gerrit or Phabricator, it is cloud-only, but may offer the code review experience that's closest to what is done inside Google today.</p>
<p>When selling the benefits of Gerrit, Phabricator, or Reviewable to the rest of your team, it's important to identify the existing pains the team is feeling with their existing code review tool. Here are how some common pain points are addressed by switching from a GitHub-Pull-Request-like tool to a Gerrit-like tool:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gerrit facilitates a more structured review process, with explicit sign-offs, which can be good if you've grown the team and want to enforce stricter review policies across the organization.</li>
<li>Gerrit makes reviewing larger diffs easier, because you can go file by file, view changes since the last round of review, and stack CRs. This enables faster, more thorough reviews.</li>
</ul>
<p>Gerrit, Phabricator, and Reviewable let you closely approximate the general review flow that you had inside of Google, but one thing that neither provides is code intelligence. If you're missing code intelligence in your current code review tool or find the GitHub PR code intelligence lacking, try the <a href="https://docs.sourcegraph.com/integration/browser_extension">Sourcegraph browser extension</a>. This connects to a Sourcegraph instance to provide tooltips, jump-to-def, and cross references during code review. It works with GitHub PRs, GitLab MRs, Phabricator, and Bitbucket Server. Support for Gerrit is on the way.</p>
<h2 id="when-youre-ready-to-slay-the-dragon">When you're ready to slay the dragon</h2>
<p>The most intractable part of the software development life cycle is often CI and the build system. This is because understanding the build often involves understanding every piece of the overall codebase in a fairly nuanced way. Speeding up the build is something that various people try to do over time, and so the build code accrues a growing set of hacks and optimizations until the point is reached where the number of people who actually understand enough about what is going on to make a change with zero negative consequences is very small.</p>
<p>In short, the build system is often a big giant hairball, and one that you should be wary of trying to disentangle before you pick off the lower hanging developer productivity fruit. It may be tempting to tackle this earlier, because Blaze was worlds better than what you're using now and Google has even helpfully open-sourced a derivative of Blaze called Bazel. But Bazel is not Blaze—for one, it lacks a massive distributed build cluster that comes free alongside it—and the world outside of Google is not Google.</p>
<p>Bazel is not a silver bullet. When Bazel was first released, many open-source projects in the Go community switched to using it in favor of the standard Go build tool. However, within a year, many of these switched back due to complexity of use, unfamiliarity in the rest of the Go community, and the fact that builds seemed to actually be slower with Bazel. Since then, there have been major improvements to Bazel's support for Go, but you need to rigorously evaluate what improvements you'll see if you switch over to it.</p>
<p>In order to do this rigorous evaluation, you'll want to have plenty of other great dev tools already in place. In particular, you'll want to have great code search, so you can actually dive into the build scripts in various parts of the codebase and understand their ins and outs. You'll also want to have a great code review tool in place, because changing the build system is going to be a complex change that requires approval from many different engineering teams.</p>
<p>Once you're ready to slay the dragon, you should understand there are a number of build tools in addition to Bazel that are designed to enable scalable builds in large codebases. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://buck.build/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Buck</a>, from Facebook</li>
<li><a href="https://gradle.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Gradle</a>, popular in the Java world</li>
<li><a href="https://www.pantsbuild.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Pants</a>, created by an ex-Googler originally for Twitter and Foursquare</li>
<li><a href="https://please.build/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Please</a>, a newish build tool created by ex-Googlers, heavily inspired by Blaze</li>
</ul>
<p>There's also <a href="https://yourbase.io/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">YourBase</a>, which is not a build tool, but a CI service started by ex-Googler Yves Junqueira to bring super-fast and scalable builds to the world outside of Google, independent of what underlying build tool is used.</p>
<h2 id="operating-like-a-xoogler">Operating like a Xoogler</h2>
<p>Google prioritizes developer experience and developer tools in a way unlike most other companies. Googlers and ex-Googlers have the benefit of firsthand experience of using first-class dev tools that add a huge amount of leverage to their natural talents and abilities.</p>
<p>One of your competitive advantages after leaving Google will be to apply these experiences to bring great new dev tools into your new organization to boost your own productivity and the productivity of your teammates. By using these tools to spread effective best practices for developing software at scale, you can bring one of Google's key competitive advantages—the effectiveness of its engineering organization—to your new company.</p>
<p>Building software at scale is hard. As everyone who has read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>The Mythical Man Month</em></a> knows, you can't get better software just by hiring more engineers. You need better tools. Just as software is a multiplier for the productivity of end users, dev tools are a multiplier for the productivity of the people who build the software. So if you truly believe in your new company's mission, make it one of your priorities to use your special knowledge as an ex-Googler and bring them the best developer tools available.</p>

                                    <p>Massachusetts this week<b> </b>became the fifth state in the nation to make prison and jail calls free. </p><p>Gov. Maura Healey signed the bill into law on Wednesday that will go into effect Dec. 1 of this year. The move is a victory for advocates and legislators who have sought to lessen the burden on prisoners communicating for years — and through many legislative sessions.</p><p>“Ensuring that individuals in state and county prisons can keep in contact with their loved ones is key to enhancing rehabilitation, reducing recidivism, and improving community safety,” Healey said in a written statement. “I’m proud to sign this important legislation and grateful to the Legislature and advocates for their partnership."</p><p>State Sen. Cindy Creem and state Rep. Chynah Tyler were the <a href="https://malegislature.gov/Bills/193/S1494" target="_blank" data-external="" data-cms-ai="0">lead sponsors</a> of the <a href="https://malegislature.gov/Bills/193/HD822" target="_blank" data-external="" data-cms-ai="0">legislation</a>. </p><p>In July, the Legislature <a href="https://www.wgbh.org/news/politics/2023-07-31/state-lawmakers-pass-56-billion-state-budget-a-month-late" data-cms-ai="0">passed</a> a state budget that included a requirement for corrections officials to make phone calls free for incarcerated people, but Healey pushed back to give more time to implement the program. This week’s legislation also makes video and emails free. </p><p>“After many years of struggle led by directly affected people, we are delighted to see this pass,” said Senior Attorney Bonnie Tenneriello at Prisoners’ Legal Services, one of the organizations advocating for the law. “PLS will do everything in our power to ensure that this legislation is implemented in a way that brings maximum access to vital communication between incarcerated people and their families.” </p><div data-align-center="">

<p>Counties will be refunded for their calls’ costs through a fund facilitated by the Executive Office of Administration and Finance, according to Tenneriello. Telecommunication contracts with companies like Securus will continue until they expire, and will be renegotiated. </p><p>“It's been an uphill battle to say the least, but one worth fighting for,” said William “7even” Ragland, chairman of the African American Coalition Committee, a coalition of men incarcerated at MCI-Norfolk focused on reforming the criminal legal system.</p><p>The Department of Correction currently charges 12 cents per minute, and most county sheriffs charge 14 cents per minute — forcing cash-strapped prisoners, or their families, to spend $2.40 and $2.80 for a 20-minute call in addition to extra fees for putting money into an account.</p><p>On Nov. 1, the most recent <a href="https://www.mass.gov/info-details/cross-tracking-state-county-correctional-populations" target="_blank" data-external="" data-cms-ai="0">data available</a>, there were 12,350&nbsp;individuals in state and county jails and prisons. </p><p>Advocates have long complained that fees and high costs exacerbate racial inequities for Black and<b> </b>Latino<b> </b>families that earn proportionately less than white families. While fewer than one in four people in Massachusetts is Black or Latino, this group comprises more than half of those incarcerated by state prisons and county jails. </p><p>“Given our low prison wages, our families are often left with the bill, deciding whether to put money on their loved ones’ phone accounts or pay their rent, put gas in their cars or put food on their tables,” Ragland said. “This is all while prisons, jails and their telecom vendors rake in profits.” </p><p>In the lead-up to the statewide policy change, some sheriffs have taken smaller steps. In 2021, 14 Massachusetts sheriffs agreed to provide a minimum of 10 free minutes of phone calls per week to each prisoner. </p><p>But the Massachusetts Sheriffs’ Association has <a href="https://www.wgbh.org/news/local/2022-05-24/sheriffs-dont-think-20-million-will-cover-their-revenue-loss-of-making-jail-calls-free" data-cms-ai="0">pushed back</a> on different iterations of no-cost call bills in the past, saying that their revenue losses wouldn’t be entirely covered by the state. </p><p>Hampden County Sheriff Nick Cocchi, president of the Massachusetts Sheriffs’ Association, told GBH News in a statement that the state’s sheriffs agree that it’s a priority to keep prisoners connected to their outside support systems while maintaining the facilities’ security. </p><p>“The Sheriffs have worked side by side with the Healey Administration and legislative leadership on this landmark legislation, and have been preparing operationally for a seamless transition on December 1st,” Cocchi wrote. </p><p>Family members have long testified that the high cost of calls have made it hard for their incarcerated loved ones to communicate on everything from helping kids with homework, to organizing what comes next when they’re released. </p><p>“My family and I have been advocating for this financial burden to be lifted from our lives for a little over six years now, it feels like a boulder has been lifted off my chest,” said Nia Reid-Patterson, who has a family member in prison, and is part of the Keeping Families Connected / No Cost Calls Coalition, groups and families seeking to make the calls free. “Like many other families, making the choice between paying for calls to keep our families connected and groceries has been nothing short of cruelty from predatory prison phone companies profiting from our already vulnerable families.” </p><p>When the law goes into effect next month, Massachusetts will join Connecticut, California, Minnesota and Colorado in eliminating prisoner phone call fees. </p>

I gowned up in cleanroom garb and passed into the High Bay 1 airlock in Building 179 where nearly all of NASA’s historic interplanetary spacecraft have been built since the Moon-bound Ranger series in the 1960s. After years of work by thousands of engineers, technicians, and scientists, there were only two weeks remaining before the Spirit Mars Rover would be transported to Cape Canaveral in Florida for launch ahead of its sibling, Opportunity.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>I was into my unofficial second shift having already logged 12 hours that Wednesday. Long workdays are a nominal scenario for the assembly and test phase. Every system of a spacecraft is thoroughly tested and confirmed to be in perfect working order before it is buttoned up for the last time on Earth. Spirit and Opportunity, part of a now-historic twin mission, were among the most complex spacecraft ever built at that time and represented nearly a billion dollars invested by NASA. No pressure.&nbsp;</p><p>The rovers, between them, had 62 brushed-type motors to drive and steer the wheels, control the robotic arm, aim the cameras, point the antenna to Earth, and the various robotic origami unfolding and deployments following landing. The rover had undergone extensive testing to simulate the harsh conditions it would face on Mars as a field geologist. Especially critical are events involving pyrotechnics, as the explosive shockwaves can damage brittle carbon components inside these motors. That night, while my colleagues focused on testing the rover itself, I was tasked with verifying the integrity of the motors in the Rock Abrasion Tool (RAT) attached to the end of Spirit’s robotic arm.</p>

  <p>Disassembling and inspecting motor components after each round of environmental testing is not practical. However, we can check their internal condition by examining their electrical performance. To do this, using a device called a break-out-box, we disconnect the motor from the spacecraft and hook it up to an external power supply and strip chart recorder. A functioning motor will show a smooth, exponential decrease in electrical current during spin-up, while any problems show up as blips in the signal.</p><p>It was a test I had performed numerous times. My various roles on the project had given me the experience to decipher the maze of diagrams mapping the 10,000 pin-to-pin connections that made everything on the spacecraft work, and my responsibility in writing the instructions on how to connect and control all the motors on the rovers made me the obvious choice for this test campaign.</p><p>Inside the cleanroom, John, the electrical chief in charge there, helped me find the equipment I needed. Then Mary, our cabling expert, did the careful work of unplugging connectors and inserting test equipment on the interface I asked for. We ran our pre-test confirmation routine. The connection interface was operational, the power supply settings and strip chart setup were correct, and a quick test pulse to a reference motor validated the configuration. With everything in order, the reference motor was removed and we jumpered-in Spirit's RAT-Revolve motor, responsible for rotating the grinder and brush on a Mars rock. The testing steps were confirmed one last time, and we had a green light for pulsing the waiting motor with energy.</p><p>To get the clearest signal and reveal the smallest of imperfections from the motor, the standard procedure is to give it as much power as it wants. This makes it vitally important to send the inrush of electrons to the right place. A wrong connection could do blue-smoke-releasing catastrophic damage. Our pre-test routine was an important precaution to verify that this potentially-dangerous configuration was correct.</p><p>The pulse was sent to the motor. As always, the result was immediate, but this time, alarmingly unfamiliar. The strip chart did not look like anything we had seen before. It did not even look like a broken motor. It was decidedly — something else. My mind raced for explanations and in what seemed like an instant, arrived at the most likely explanation. My eyes followed the wires from our breakout box on the test cart to the spacecraft, and the reason for the unfamiliar signal landed like a dagger through my heart. All that power we just released did not go into the RAT-Revolve motor. Due to a mistake I had made with the break-out-box, it went the other direction on the connector interface, sending a surge of electricity straight into the spacecraft, instead of the motor.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Ooooohhhh ssshhhhiiiiitttt.</em></p>

  <p>The possible consequences rolled over me in nauseating waves. I may have just created a $500M piece of scrap. With only two weeks until the spacecraft was delivered for launch operations, THERE WAS NO TIME to recover from a big problem. I was instantly aware that there may be only one rover launched to Mars on this synodic cycle. And my hands were holding the still-warm rover murder weapon.</p><p>I had learned from countless experiences in this and other projects that bad news doesn’t get better with age so I immediately keyed the mic on my headset and told Leo, the test conductor running the other testing in parallel, what had just happened. His response twisted the knife in my chest. ‘Yeah, we seem to have lost all spacecraft telemetry just a bit ago.’ NOT a good sign.</p><p>Everyone in my vicinity was listening in on the voice loop on their headsets, and off-mic, John unleashed a string of profanities about me that could serve as an advanced tutorial for even the most seasoned sailors. The team immediately ran the spacecraft’s emergency shutdown procedure and we were instructed to leave the cleanroom for what would probably be a damage assessment briefing.</p><p>I had turned 28 less than a month prior, looked and felt much younger, and was a few years into my first big job after college. This first significant step in my dream career as an interplanetary spacecraft engineer, which I had aspired to since junior high, was perhaps also going to be my last. Others in the system test area moved away from me as dark reality descended. Matt, the Assembly Test and Launch Operations manager, firmly instructed me to write down everything I could remember about what had just transpired. I’m not sure when the tears started, but they were probably flowing as I recorded those details alone in a conference room.</p><p>With my notes in hand, Leo and my colleagues meticulously examined the evening’s events. There were two obvious things that had happened. One, a large pulse of electricity had gone somewhere other than intended, and two, telemetry had stopped coming from the spacecraft. Ominously, but perhaps with a ray of hope, there was not an obvious link between these two things. As the team reasoned through the problem, it seemed the surge of electricity likely ended up in the H-Bridge motor driver circuit, essentially a smart traffic controller for electricity. What I did was NOT GOOD, but luckily because of something called back-EMF[1], this was one part of the rover actually designed to handle extra energy.</p><p>We decided that the errant pulse had somehow glitched the system enough to interrupt the data flow without permanently disabling it. With the spacecraft already powered off, we would do what you do with your own consumer electronics: we would turn it back on to see if the power cycle had cleared the problem.</p><p>It was close to midnight and notifications about the incident had made it up the chain of management to Pete, the Project Manager. Replanning across the entire project of a thousand people was at stake. The team, now with a lot of extra attention and oversight, re-grouped and ran the standard spacecraft power-on procedure. When booting up the spacecraft, it takes a bit for the electronics to come online, then for the software to boot up and start producing telemetry. There is a circuit that produces a pulse every clock cycle (8 times a second), turning a red light on the ground support instrument rack into a robot heartbeat indicator. The spacecraft power supply went through its familiar progression of voltage steps and currents, but after too much time, the heartbeat remained dark, and the telemetry never came.&nbsp;</p><p>I don’t really remember what happened next. Probably something about meetings in the morning to figure out what the hell do we do now?! What I do remember is the feeling of emotional devastation that followed me home where I recounted the story to my wife. I was convinced I would lose my job in the morning and space exploration history would attach my name to a particular chapter of infamy.</p><p>Back at JPL in the morning, in a meeting with a fresh shift and hold outs from the prior night of disaster, we once again worked through the detailed sequence of reconstructed events looking for clues or possible recovery, which felt more and more fleeting until one crucial piece of the puzzle was recognized.</p><p>The Fluke 87III digital multimeter is a ubiquitous tool in the labs of JPL. When I entered the cleanroom the previous night, I needed one and asked John, the sailor linguist, where I could get one for my test. All were in use, so he pointed near the spacecraft to one apparently monitoring bus voltage but not involved in any testing. I carefully removed the leads and proceeded on to my date with destiny in testing the RAT motors. The monitoring multimeter I disconnected was actually completing the circuit that powered the spacecraft's ground test telemetry. I inadvertently disabled the connection the instant I removed the leads.</p><p>We immediately realized that the next thing to do was to restore the multimeter to this duty and power up the spacecraft.</p><p>We did just that. It worked. There was a collective gasp as the telemetry flickered back to life — Spirit was not dead after all!</p><p>The team resumed testing, having lost only a few hours, and I exhaled the most monumental sigh of relief in my lifetime, reassured that I might not have actually doomed the mission to a single-rover endeavor.</p><p>The rest of that morning was a blur. Weeks of analyses followed on the RAT-Revolve motor H-bridge channel leading to detailed discussions of possible thin-film demetallization. Ultimately the project gained the confidence to disposition the hardware: Use As Is.</p><p>The long days continued. I moved to Cape Canaveral to begin the final preparations before launching the rovers to Mars, and more thrilling stress-filled moments punctuated the days and weeks. Then Spirit was on Mars, and after a year of latent stress, it turned out the RAT-Revolve motor worked just fine, and the whole experience became a life lesson.</p>

  <h2>The Lesson</h2><p>As I've recounted this tale over time, it has not only enriched my understanding but also inspired others to explore and share their own brushes with failure. The act of sharing transforms these experiences into valuable lessons, both for the storytellers and their audience. Later in my career, at my asteroid mining startup Planetary Resources, we recognized the power of these narratives in our hiring process and team culture. We deliberately asked job candidates to share a failure story of theirs, inviting them to acknowledge and learn from their past challenges, while recognizing that failure is a natural process of learning. The core lesson I've drawn from my rover ordeal is best expressed in these words:</p>

  <p>In the depths of the crisis, when the tears were flowing and everyone else in the system test center was moving away, one person walked toward me. Ernie, a wise and kind man who had come out of retirement to help with the round-the-clock spacecraft shift work approached me and put his hand around my shoulder, and in a gentle grandfatherly voice quietly reassured me. He then uttered the clear words that I will never forget: ‘Remember this feeling the next time you have to sign-off that something is OK.’</p><p>I went on to become Flight Director for Spirit and Opportunity as they explored the surface of Mars, earning NASA’s Exceptional Achievement Medal for my efforts, so obviously I didn’t get fired for this incident. But that wasn’t clear until a few days later in one of the more pivotal meetings of my life. In the tense period following the mishap, with definitive analysis still pending, passionate and polarized debates ensued about the tests' hazards, and many argued for stopping them altogether. The debate concluded, and the criticality of these tests — making sure our motors would function flawlessly on Mars — was still paramount. The tests needed to continue. And I still remember the shock when Project Manager Pete delivered the decision and the follow-on news: ‘These tests will continue. And Chris will continue to lead them as we have paid for his education. He’s the last person on Earth who would make this mistake again.’&nbsp;</p><p>I found myself returning to the 'scene of the crime' for many more tests, after I had carefully revised the procedures to eliminate the chance of repeating the same mistake. Each time I conducted this test again, Pete’s vote of confidence combined with Ernie’s words of wisdom brought with it a moment of nausea, a stark reminder of the past incident, but also the readiness and confidence to continue. The trust management showed in me, despite the initial error, marked a key moment in my career, highlighting growth and the ability to overcome challenges.</p><p>Now, whenever I'm called upon to give my approval or endorsement for something significant, I'm instantly transported back to that moment — the room, the lighting, the chair I was in, the table, the pit in my stomach, the intense mix of fear, anxiety and regret for an oversight that nearly led to catastrophe. Ernie's wisdom that day, combined with his compassionate approach during my moment of vulnerability, left an indelible mark on me. Now, when faced with critical decisions, I not only recall that experience but also strive to assist others in navigating their own challenging moments. And like Pete did for me, my aim is to aid in transforming these experiences into catalysts for growth and resilience, reinforcing the notion that our responses to adversity can define our path forward.</p><p>These stories of near misses, learning curves, and eventual triumphs are not just mine, but are shared by many who build things. In space exploration, failure is not an option — it comes pre-installed. Every misstep is a stepping stone towards greater success, and together, our collective wisdom can pave the way for future innovations, achievements and breakthroughs in developing and growing our presence in and benefit from space.</p><p>&nbsp;I’d love to learn from fellow space entrepreneurs, engineers, scientists, technicians, and others who would share their own 'Failure Stories.'

We have already begun working through clean up tasks, such as clearing ghosts, and expect to be done by December 22. If you see any bridge artifacts left past that point, please let us know.</p>
<p>If you are one of those who have relied on the bridge in the past, you may be asking: what now? You do have options.</p>
<p>People who need a bridge for their community can <a href="https://matrix.org/ecosystem/bridges/irc/">run their own</a>: the matrix-appservice-irc software is still maintained. Only its Libera Chat instance, which was configured to persist connections across restarts, is being shut down. Please be mindful of the network, and read <a href="https://libera.chat/guides/faq#are-bridges-allowed">Libera Chat’s recommendations</a> and <a href="https://libera.chat/guides/matrix">their Matrix FAQ</a> when doing so.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>We at the Matrix.org Foundation have been working behind the scenes for months with the team at Element who operated the bridge and our peers at Libera Chat. Our hope had been to address the issues that were raised about the bridge to the satisfaction of Libera and to quickly bring it back online, but ultimately the Foundation is only a facilitator in the process and does not have the resources to maintain and operate the bridge itself.</p>
<p>We know that many communities and individuals were relying on the bridge, and we regret the impact this situation has on them.</p>
<p>To date, development, maintenance, and operation of the Libera Chat bridge had been donated to the community by teams at Element. We are grateful for their work and ongoing support, and understand that limited staffing has impacted their ability to consistently prioritize work on this bridge.</p>
<p>Over the course of the last couple of years of operating the bridge, issues had been raised and work undertaken to address those issues to the extent possible with available resources.</p>
<p>Transparently, the complexity of the work meant that we didn’t get the desired results as quickly as any involved party would’ve liked. Given that, the teams came to mutual agreement to turn the bridge off until key improvements were made and verified.</p>
<p>It’s possible that the necessary work will be undertaken at some point, and Element has made it clear that they would like to make this happen. But with so many people wondering about the status and trying to make plans, we owe it to the impacted communities to provide more certainty than we’ve offered to date.</p>
<p>Long term, the Foundation’s hope is to have the resources to service its core programs as well as provide additional community services like bridge maintenance and operations. However, as an open source foundation that is still early in its journey, we must be realistic about our capacity and make hard choices about where we put our scarce resources.</p>
<p>We thank all of the involved parties for their commitment to doing right by the community and are sorry that we don’t have better news to offer at this time.</p>

Independent of his work with Buffett, Munger is a successful businessman and philanthropist in his own right. An avid reader and life-long, multidisciplinary learner, he is admired for his witty life lessons and often-too-blunt pieces of advice. Born in 1924, he is 96 years young. </p><p><h2><b>When handing out misfortune, life has no obligation to be fair.</b></h2></p><div><p>In 1953, Charlie was 29 years old when he and his wife divorced. He had been married since he was 21. Charlie lost everything in the divorce, his wife keeping the family home in South Pasadena. Munger moved into “dreadful” conditions at the University Club…</p><p><b>Shortly after the divorce, Charlie learned that his son, Teddy, had leukemia</b>. In those days, there was no health insurance, you just paid everything out of pocket and <b>the death rate was near 100% since there was nothing doctors could do</b>. Rick Guerin, Charlie’s friend, said Munger would go into the hospital, hold his young son, and then walk the streets of Pasadena crying.</p><p>One year after the diagnosis, in 1955, Teddy Munger died. <b>Charlie was 31 years old, divorced, broke, and burying his 9 year old son.</b></p></div><p><h2><b>If you are misfortunate, a victim mentality is incredibly useful if you wish to remain miserable…</b></h2></p><div><p>Whenever you think that some situation or some person is ruining your life, [think that] it’s actually you who are ruining your life. It’s such a simple idea. <b>Feeling like a victim is a perfectly disastrous way to go through life</b>. </p><p>If you just take the attitude that, however bad it is in anyway, <b>it’s always your fault and you just fix it as best you can</b> – the so-called ‘iron prescription’ – <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5U0TE4oqj24&amp;utm_source=www.butwhatfor.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=charlie-munger-feeling-like-a-victim-is-perfectly-disastrous" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">I think that really works</a>.</p></div><p><h2><b>… as self-pity itself is guaranteed to never improve your position.</b></h2></p><div><p>Well you can say that’s waggery, but I suggest that every time you find you’re drifting into self-pity, I don’t care what the cause, your child could be dying of cancer, <b>self-pity is not going to improve the situation…</b></p><p>It’s a ridiculous way to behave, and <b><a href="https://www.butwhatfor.com/p/suppose-wanted-kill-lot-ofpilots" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">when you avoid it you get a great advantage over everybody else</a></b>, almost everybody else, because self-pity is a standard condition and yet you can train yourself out of it.</p></div><p><h2><b>Alternatively, you can accept personal responsibility to better your situation…</b></h2></p><div><p><b>Another thing of course is life will have terrible blows, horrible blows, unfair blows, doesn’t matter</b>.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>In a series of <a href="https://ia800907.us.archive.org/5/items/BaudrillardJean.TheGulfWarDidNotTakePlace.IndianapolisIndianaUniversityPress1991.0004/Baudrillard%2C%20Jean.%20The%20Gulf%20War%20Did%20Not%20Take%20Place.%20Indianapolis-Indiana%20University%20Press%2C%201991._0004.pdf">three essays published in 1991</a>, the philosopher Jean Baudrillard argued that the Gulf War, which ended up with more than a hundred thousand dead Iraqis, had not really taken place. In his inimitable fashion, his argument was filled with internal contradictions, annoying trolling (Baudrillard had initially written that the Gulf War would never actually happen, which, of course, it did), and some pockets of real clarity. His ultimate argument was that what had taken place wasn’t so much a war but a one-sided aerial slaughter that was scrubbed clean through intensive media control. What people in the West saw were so-called live feeds of missiles and aerial assaults fuelled by new forms of technology, whether the Patriot missile or the stealth bomber. The war was communicated to us almost like an advertisement for a new car—here are all the new features, and here are the salesmen in the form of generals or foreign-policy experts paraded on cable news. We did not see slain enemy combatants, destroyed civilian homes.</p><p>If the Gulf War was a slaughter sold to the American public as a clean military-technology show, the <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tag/gaza">war in Gaza</a> has been a production line of horrifying images. The footage of dead and wounded children, particularly on social media, has traumatized the world and made it clear that nothing—not even the Israeli military tightly controlling media access—can stop ordinary citizens around the world from seeing what happens when a shell hits a hospital or a school or an apartment building where families live. My guess is that this war’s lasting legacy may not be some geopolitical break after years of conflict but the images of the innocents we’ve seen, including children, killed in almost every imaginable way.</p><p>There should be no moral squishiness about any of this. If children are being slaughtered, if a father is carrying his dead daughter through a bombed-out street, or if there is footage of dead children in southern Israel, which, for now, seems to have been shown mostly in a selective way through screenings by the Israel Defense Forces, the world, at large, should see that.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Here in the United States, we have our own procession of dead children, but they’re almost all unseen. The victims of mass shootings in schools leave behind a spectral trail. We do not see their deaths; we do not see the agony of a parent holding their child’s lifeless body. Instead, we see the surrounding context—surveillance footage of the shooter stalking through the hallways of a school, the smiling school photos of the murdered child, the brave parents speaking in shaky voices at a press conference, the faces of law-enforcement officers providing nighttime updates on the death toll. These scenes have become so familiar that they feel like studio sets for a television show we watch over and over again. In the first act, we see the aerial shots of the school. Then we are on the grounds with the shooter. And here is the local chief of police, his face overly lit from a crowd of news cameras, each with its own little spotlight, grimly updating the nation.</p><p>This show does not trade in clean advertisements in the Baudrillardian sense, but its recurrence and its familiarity draw more attention to the bodies we don’t see. We are left to imagine the scene inside a classroom. Every time I hear about a shooting at a school, I picture my own children looking up with surprise as the gunman walks through the door. But our imaginations tend to stop short, in part because the vast majority of us have <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/would-showing-graphic-images-of-mass-shootings-spur-action-to-stop-them">never seen actual carnage</a>. If the parents are willing, and believe that their child’s death can spark the outrage needed to produce an outcome that would stop or reduce these mass shootings, should we see these dead children in the same way that we have seen the dead children of Gaza? One does not have to agree upon what the solution might be—gun control or early psychiatric interventions or whatever else—to understand the calculation here. It is similar to the decision Mamie Till made when she insisted upon an open-casket funeral for her son, Emmett, saying, “I wanted the world to see what they did to my baby.”</p><p>Earlier this month, the Washington <em>Post</em> published a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/interactive/2023/ar-15-force-mass-shootings/?itid=hp-top-table-main_p001_f001">lengthy multimedia story</a> titled “Terror on Repeat: A rare look at the devastation caused by AR-15 shootings,” which includes photos from mass shootings that the vast majority of the public has never seen before. We see the bullet-ridden walls of the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, a prayer book with a bullet hole found in the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, a shattered glass wall at Sandy Hook Elementary, and the blood-streaked floors of a classroom at Robb Elementary in Uvalde, Texas.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2023/11/16/about-ar-15-graphic-content/">note</a> that accompanies the story, Sally Buzbee, the newspaper’s executive editor, writes that “the goal was to balance two crucial objectives: to advance the public’s understanding of mass killers’ increasing use of this readily available weapon, which was originally designed for war, while being sensitive to victims’ families and communities directly affected by AR-15 shootings.”</p><p>But these images have also been edited, vetted, and responsibly published through an institutional process that included, in Buzbee’s words, grappling “with our own standard practices when it comes to publishing graphic content” and “training by the Dart Center for Journalism and Trauma,” which conferred “best practices for viewing disturbing photos and discussing how publishing them could affect readers.” What this means is that the <em>Post’s</em> story tightens the focus on all the areas surrounding the images of dead children—the bloody floor of a classroom in Uvalde—but for the most part still does not show the bodies themselves.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>There are two notable exceptions. From the mass shooting at a music festival in Las Vegas, we see dozens of dead people lying on the ground. In a hallway at Robb Elementary, a photo shows two lines of white body bags. The latter image is stunning, and there is an argument to be made that the body bags are enough to convey the horror and to fully portray the destruction of these mass shootings. The anonymity the bags confer and the blankness of white allow the viewer to imagine what’s inside without any intervening politics or prejudices or narratives. The brightly painted hallway—lime green and light blue—could be at any elementary school in America. The white bags could contain anyone’s children. The anonymity is universal, and the mind is drawn immediately to the other white body bags we have seen since October 7th.</p><p>And yet I do not know if these images are enough. This is not through any fault of the <em>Post</em>, which should be credited for its exhaustive, original reporting. But because it is an institution that must be careful and must reflect the recommendations of other institutions, such as the Dart Center, the decision about publishing traumatic imagery will always be processed through existing standards and consensus. Part of that calculus involves assessing the images’ journalistic value, which, in this case, was to show the “devastation caused by AR-15 shootings.” The specificity of that framing might give it more political power, but it also feels slightly—and I do mean slightly—disingenuous. Are we really seeing all these images of carnage as a way to talk about the AR-15? Perhaps, but I imagine the <em>Post</em> also understands that the horror of the images extends well beyond the debate over one specific weapon of war.</p><p>In an excellent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/13/opinion/gaza-war-children-photo.html">column</a> in the New York <em>Times</em> about a photograph of six dead children in Gaza, Lydia Polgreen writes, “The news media no longer needs to disseminate an image for it to be seen. Social media bludgeons us with a flood of brutal images.” Polgreen points to a discomforting probability: when the world ultimately sees the images of dead children in a school shooting in the United States, it will likely come via social media and be taken by someone who was inside the school, or, perhaps more ghoulishly, the shooters themselves. The dam—which currently is held in place by the standards of news organizations and by law-enforcement organizations who, for understandable reasons, have tightly guarded these crime-scene photos—will inevitably break. At some point, we will see these children, and journalists will then be faced with the question of whether they should offer up a more sanitized version of what the rest of the world has already seen.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>In her editor’s note, Buzbee mentions that the <em>Post</em> talked to families of the victims, some of whom were willing to grant permission to publish photographs of their dead relatives. But the paper ultimately decided that “the potential harm to victims’ families outweighed any potential journalistic value of showing recognizable bodies.” This is a perfectly acceptable decision, but one that prompts a broader question about whether it will be these institutional processes—and institutions—that ultimately arbitrate what is and isn’t made visible. There is also the question of why the <em>Post</em> would set aside the consent of victims’ families to protect them from the potential harm of what they had agreed to do.</p><p>The arguments against facilitating such a voluntary exposure are certainly compelling. A family who agreed to have the image of their murdered child published would be opening themselves up to the public in an excruciating manner. They might also retraumatize the families of other victims. There also is a legitimate concern about privacy that a dead child can no longer demand. But I also think that it’s worth thinking pragmatically, if such a word can be used in this context. Images of dead children have great emotional and political power because most people in the world rightfully agree that their deaths are intolerable. The taboo on showing the aftermath of this violence does not exist as merely some marker of civilized society—of good taste. It comes from those who, for whatever reason, are squeamish about putting names and faces to the escalating body count, who want to keep everything abstract. This isn’t limited just to gun manufacturers or to their lobbies or to politicians defending the Second Amendment but extends to just regular parents who would rather not fixate on something that’s probably not going to happen at their kid’s school.</p><p>The past six weeks have made it clear that the world will respond to images of slaughtered children, and it’s worth asking why it’s taken this long for people to see what that looks like. There is no question that images of dead children carry an immense amount of weight, which, in turn, must be handled responsibly. But that does not mean that any attempt to get the public to see them is automatically manipulative or propagandistic. It is far more manipulative to edit out the dead children or to hide them under a veil of solemnity and manners.&nbsp;♦</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>There’s no good evidence that <i>kamilos</i> — supposedly meaning ‘rope’ — was ever even a real word in ancient Greek.</p>

<p>The myth we’re looking at is to do with the following passage in the Bible.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>εὐκοπώτερόν ἐστιν <b>κάμηλον διὰ τῆς τρυμαλιᾶς τῆς ῥαφίδος διελθεῖν</b> ἢ πλούσιον εἰς τὴν βασιλείαν τοῦ θεοῦ εἰσελθεῖν.</p>
  <p>It is easier for <b>a camel to go through the eye of a needle</b> than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.</p>
  <p><i>Mark</i> <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+10.23-25&amp;version=THGNT,NRSVUE">10.25</a> (~ <i>Matthew</i> <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+19.21-24&amp;version=THGNT,NRSVUE">19.24</a>, <i>Luke</i> <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+18.22-25&amp;version=THGNT,NRSVUE">18.25</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to the myth, ‘camel’ is a misreading: originally, it was a ‘rope’ going through a needle. Still impossible, but not surreal like ‘camel’. Supposedly, the text originally had <i>kamilos</i>, but <i>kamēlos</i> ‘camel’ and <i>kamilos</i> ‘rope’ sounded the same in imperial-era Greek, so they got mixed up.</p>

<p>The ‘rope’ theory is one of a couple of tactics for softening Jesus’ condemnation of wealth-hoarding. There’s another one about an imaginary gate in Jerusalem called ‘the eye of the needle’: that one was made up in the 11th century. But some religious groups have a strong motivation for reading this passage as being about something other than a literal camel going through a literal needle’s eye. So fake explanations tend to stick around.</p>

<p>This review is a resource for anyone who’s in doubt about what the evidence for the ‘rope’ interpretation looks like. The executive summary is this: the word supposedly meaning ‘rope’ was made up in the 5th century or shortly beforehand, and it was made up specifically to weaken Jesus’ condemnation of wealth. It’s older than the ‘eye of the needle’ gate, but it’s just as bogus.</p>

<h2>A review of κάμιλος</h2>

<p>I’ll carry on spelling <i>kamēlos</i> (‘camel’) and <i>kamilos</i> (supposedly ‘rope’) differently, for clarity. Ancient and mediaeval sources often spell them both <i>kamēlos</i>.</p>

<p>The earliest authentic appearance of <i>kamilos</i> is in Cyril of Alexandria (1st half of 5th century). In nearly all cases where it appears in ancient and mediaeval sources, it’s only mentioned because someone is giving it as a textual variant for ‘camel’ in the gospels. In other contexts it appears only twice, and even those are still as annotations to the word ‘camel’, and they repeat Cyril’s exact phrasing.</p>

<p>So <b>there’s no independent evidence</b> to corroborate Cyril’s claim that <i>kamilos</i> was even a real word, let alone that it was the original text in the gospels. There’s just one possible exception: one <i>possible</i> candidate for an independent use of the word — a 5th century inscription from southern Anatolia — but the interpretation of the inscription is very doubtful.</p>

<hr>

<h3>1. Sources that cite <i>kamilos</i> as a textual variant in the gospels</h3>

<p>As I said, nearly all uses of <i>kamilos</i> ‘rope’ belong to this category. These are no use at all as corroboration. They don’t show that the word could ever be used in <i>any other</i> context.</p>

<p>Cyril’s definitions (sources <b>a</b>, <b>b</b>) are echoed in most post-Cyril sources.</p>

<p>I stop at the 11th century. (Zahn goes on further, to include a 12th century citation of Cyril in Bar Hebraeus: Zahn <a href="https://archive.org/details/dasevangeliumdes0000zahn_g1d0/page/602/mode/2up">1922: 602 n. 71</a>.)</p>

<p>I’ll just quote the first two, sources <b>a</b> and <b>b</b>, from Cyril. They’re both fragments preserved in <i>catena</i> commentaries. First, Cyril on <i>Matthew</i> 19.24:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>κάμηλον</b> δὲ ἐνταῦθά φησιν οὐ τὸ ζῷον τὸ ἀχθοφόρον, ἀλλὰ τὸ παχὺ σχοινίον, ἐν ᾧ δεσμεύουσι τὰς ἀγκύρας οἱ ναῦται. οὐκ ἀνήνυτον παντελῶς τοῦτο δείκνυσιν ὄν, τῷ δὲ ἄγαν δυσχερὴ λοιπὸν ἤδη πως ἐγγὺς καὶ ἀγχίθυρον τοῦ ἀδυνάτου τὸ χρῆμα τιθείς.</p>
  <p>‘camel’: he doesn’t mean the pack animal here, but the thick rope, with which sailors bind anchors. He shows that the situation isn’t absolutely permanent, but makes the matter extremely difficult for him in future, and for the present, close to and neighbouring on impossibility.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><b>Note.</b> Reuss’ text fills in a chunk that’s missing in the <i>Patrologia</i> text, based on a manuscript at Mt Athos, Great Lavra cod. B 113 (11th cent.), <a href="https://www.loc.gov/resource/amedmonastery.0027105127A-ma/?sp=102">fol. 97r</a>. Reuss silently alters δυσχερή to δυσχερεῖ: I restore the manuscript reading here.</p>

<p>And Cyril on <i>Luke</i> 18.25. This one is very bald-faced, selecting the contrived word for the express purpose of allowing rich people to go to heaven.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>κάμηλον</b>· οὐ τὸ ζῶον, ἀλλὰ τὸ ἐν τοῖς πλοίοις παχὺ σχοινίον. ἔξεστι γὰρ αὐτοῖς, εἰ μὴ εἰσάπαν ἕλοιντο τὸ τῶν ὅλων ὄντων ἀπολισθεῖν, ἑτέρως εὐδοκιμεῖν, ποιῆσαι φίλους ἐκ τοῦ ἀδίκου μαμωνᾶ, ἵνα ὅταν ἐπιλίπωσε, δέξωνται αὐτοὺς εἰς τὰς αἰωνίους σκηνάς.</p>
  <p>‘camel’: not the animal, but the thick rope used on ships. For it is possible for them to arrive at blessedness in a different way, even if they don’t choose to lose all their property completely, if they use their unjust Mamon to make friends, and the friends invite them into the eternal tabernacles.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you’re thinking of investigating all the sources listed here, take notice of Cyril’s phrasing: τὸ παχὺ σχοινίον (‘the thick rope’), and the bit about binding anchors. You’ll see these pop up routinely in later sources, including the sources in category 3, below. That shows that they aren’t independent.</p>

<p>The only post-Cyril source worth noticing is source <b>e</b>, the spurious Origen fragment. If authentic, it would put <i>kamilos</i> back to the 3rd century. But as Theodor Zahn points out, Origen’s authentic discussions of the gospel passages are entirely unaware of the ‘rope’ interpretation (Zahn <a href="https://archive.org/details/dasevangeliumdes0000zahn_g1d0/page/600/mode/2up">1922: 601 n. 71</a>).</p>

<hr>

<h3>2. Manuscripts of the New Testament with <i>kamilos</i></h3>

<p>A handful of the thousands of manuscripts of the New Testament — none earlier than the 9th century — give the variant reading <i>kamilos</i> in one or more of the three gospel passages. Like the sources in category 1, these have no corroborative value, because they do not show the word being used in any other context.</p>

<p>Many of the <i>kamilos</i> manuscripts belong to ‘family 13’, a group of 10th–15th century manuscripts with affinities to minuscule 13, that is, <a href="https://manuscripts.csntm.org/manuscript/View/GA_13">Paris.gr. 50</a> (11th cent.). Even in ‘family 13’, <i>kamilos</i> only appears in <i>Mark</i> 10.25 and <i>Luke</i> 18.25; in <i>Matthew</i> 19.24, it’s always <i>kamēlos</i>.</p>

<p><b>Note.</b> On ‘family 13’ see Metzger and Ehrman 2005: 87. On the Armenian and Georgian translations that have affinities to ‘family 13’, and which translate using a word meaning ‘rope’, see Metzger and Ehrman 2005: 117–119; McCollum <a href="https://hmmlorientalia.wordpress.com/2015/07/23/a-camel-or-a-rope-in-the-eye-of-a-needle-the-old-georgian-witness/">2015</a>; Pirtea 2021: 331. McCollum shows that ‘camel’ is standard in the Greek, Syriac, and Athonite Georgian versions, while ‘rope’ is standard in the Armenian and pre-Athonite Georgian evidence. (He doesn’t notice that the pseudo-Origen, here source <b>e</b>, is spurious — but it’s no discredit to miss something so obscure.)</p>

<p>Here are the manuscripts that are <i>not</i> in ‘family 13’ but which have the <i>kamilos</i> variant.</p>

<ul>
  <li><i>Mark</i> 10.25: minuscules 28 and 579 (Paris.gr. 379, 11th cent.; Paris.gr. 59, 13th cent.).</li>

</ul>

<p>All older manuscripts — including the ancient ones, like the Sinaiticus and Vaticanus manuscripts — invariably use <i>kamēlos</i>.</p>

<hr>

<h3>3. Sources that cite <i>kamilos</i> as an annotation to ‘camel’</h3>

<p>There are two sources in this category:</p>

<ol start="8" type="a">
  <li><span>Scholion on Aristophanes, <i>Wasps</i> <a href="https://archive.org/details/ScholiaGraecaInAristophanem/page/158/mode/2up">1035</a></span></li>
  <li><span><i>Souda</i> <a href="https://archive.org/details/adler-a.-suidae-lexicon-3-./Adler%20A.%2C%20Suidae%20Lexicon%203%20%28%CE%9A-%CE%9F.%20%CE%A9%29/page/n19/mode/1up">κ.282 κάμηλος</a> (<i><a href="http://www.cs.uky.edu/~raphael/sol/sol-entries/kappa/282">Suda on line</a></i>)</span></li>
</ol>

<p>These are both mediaeval. The Aristophanes scholia may go back to the early Byzantine period; the <i>Souda</i> encyclopaedia is 10th century.</p>

<p>I’ll quote the first one in full. The background is that in 422 BCE, the comic playwright Aristophanes made a joke about camels, describing a contemporary politician as having the smell of a seal, the testicles of a bogeyman, and the arsehole of a camel. About a millennium later, an anonymous scholar explains the joke as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>πρωκτὸν δὲ καμήλου·</b> θερμόπρωκτος γὰρ ἡ κάμηλος καὶ λάγνος. κάμιλος δὲ τὸ παχὺ σχοινίον διὰ τοῦ ι.</p>
  <p>‘(and he had) a camel’s arsehole’: the joke is that camels are hot-arsed and lewd. And a <i>kamilos</i> is the thick rope, with an i.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Neither <b>h</b> nor <b>i</b> uses <i>kamilos</i> in a sentence. They only cite it lexicographically — as a footnote to talking about camels. In both sources, the commentator explains what the word means. That is, the word is rare enough that a scholarly reader cannot be expected to know it. And both definitions use Cyril’s exact phrase τὸ παχὺ σχοινίον (‘the thick rope’).</p>

<p>So these sources have no corroborative value either. <i>Kamilos</i> doesn’t get used in its own right, it’s purely an appendage to ‘camel’, and even more importantly, neither source is independent of Cyril.</p>

<hr>

<h3>4. Sources that use <i>kamilos</i> independently</h3>

<p>Finally we get to the one category of evidence that could in principle corroborate that <i>kamilos</i> is a real word. However, there’s only one source that <i>might potentially</i> fall into this category, and it’s really shaky:</p>

<ol start="10" type="a">
  <li><span><i>Inscriptions de Cilicie</i> <a href="https://epigraphy.packhum.org/text/285663?&amp;bookid=692&amp;location=1661">108</a>, col. ii line 5 (Dagron and Feissel 1987: 170–185)</span></li>
</ol>

<p>This is a 5th or 6th century CE inscription found near Anazarbos (Anavarza) and held at the Adana Archaeology Museum. The inscription is a list of tariffs for various freight goods. Here’s the start of column ii, with my translation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    [ . . . κ'] β<br>
    [     ]ι̣ο̣υ̣ γο' κ' α<br>
    κρόκου γο' κ' δ<br>
    γάρου γο' κ' α<br>
    μασσίνων καμηλ( ) κ' αγ'</p>
  <p>
    [ . . . ] 2 <i>keratia</i><br>
    [     ] — per load — 1 <i>keration</i><br>
    saffron — per load — 4 <i>keratia</i><br>
    garum — per load — 1 <i>keration</i><br>
    <i>massinoi</i> — per camel load — 1⅓ <i>keratia</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The fifth line is the relevant one. For discussion, see Dagron and Feissel (1987: 176–177). They supplement the text as μασσίνων καμήλ(ων), which they interpret as ‘thick ropes’.</p>

<p>The meaning of both <i>massin-</i> and <i>kamēl-</i> is questionable. Dagron and Feissel think <i>massinos</i> is an adjective relating to ropes, partly because of Cyril’s interpretation of <i>kamilos</i> (source <b>a</b> above); partly because of the Syrian author John Malalas (6th century), who refers to someone being tied up with a σχοῖνος μάσσινος or ‘<i>massinos</i> rope’; and the <i>Life of Symeon Stylites the Younger</i> (7th century?), which has the 6th century Syrian saint winding a μάσ(σ)ινον σχοινίον (‘<i>mas</i>(<i>s</i>)<i>inos</i> rope’) around his body. So in this inscription they regard <i>massinōn</i> as an adjective, modifying <i>kamēl</i>(<i>ōn</i>) ‘ropes’.</p>

<p><b>Note.</b> Malalas, <i>Chronographia</i> 7.12, p. 142,35 ed. Thurn (= <a href="https://archive.org/details/corpusscriptoru04berlgoog/page/186/mode/2up">p. 186,19–20</a> ed. Dindorf); <i>Life of Symeon Stylites the Younger</i> 26 ed. van den Ven. For the latter I rely on Dagron and Feissel’s report.</p>

<p>They <i>might</i> be right. However, first, the context doesn’t favour ‘rope’: lines 3 to 11 of the inscription appear to be foodstuffs — saffron, garum, possibly gourds, possibly fenugreek, garlic, wine, and so on.</p>

<p>Second, every other line gives the freight good in the genitive case, and an indication of quantity. So line 3 gives the tariff for a γόμος <i>of</i> saffron, line 4 for a γόμος <i>of</i> garum, and so on. In lines 16–17, the price is given per unit: the tariff <i>per</i> slave, <i>per</i> bovine. Why, then, is μασσίνων genitive plural? Where’s the indication of quantity? The most intuitive answer is that that’s what καμηλ(&nbsp;) is doing there. The correct supplement is μασσίνων καμηλ(ικός), ‘a camel load of <i>massinoi</i>’. The camel was the most commonly used beast of burden in Anatolia until the 20th century (Potts 2004; İnal 2020: 71), and Dagron and Feissel themselves point out that γόμος καμηλικός is standard phrasing in the famous Palmyra tariff inscription, alongside γόμος καρρικός ‘wagon load’ and γόμος ὀνικός ‘ass load’, and with a conversion rate of 1 wagon load = 4 camel loads. As for <i>massinoi</i>, its meaning is doubtful. Even if it really is an adjective, it’s completely normal for Greek to use an adjective as a substantive.</p>

<p>The argument for κάμηλος ‘rope’ in the Anarbazos inscription isn’t intuitive, it neglects the format of the tariff list, and it relies on Cyril’s testimony — so it begs the question of whether <i>kamilos</i> is even a real word.</p>

<p>Can we be certain that this <i>isn’t</i> an instance of <i>kamilos</i> ‘rope’? Not 100% certain, no — but this inscription certainly can’t take the weight of being the <i>sole independent use</i> of the word.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>The word <i>kamilos</i> ‘rope’ —</p>

<ul>
  <li>first appears in the 400s CE, more than three centuries after the gospels</li>
  <li>is vanishingly rare even after that date</li>
  <li>is never, ever used in a sentence by any ancient or mediaeval writer</li>
  <li>appears only in lexicographical contexts</li>
  <li>is always cited as an annotation either to camels, or to <i>Matthew</i> 19.24</li>
  <li>is always defined, because no reader can be expected to know its meaning</li>
  <li>is usually defined using Cyril of Alexandria’s phrasing</li>
</ul>

<p>The fact that <i>kamilos</i> normally appears in the context of camels or the gospel passages makes it look very much like that is its primary context.</p>

<p>That is: <i>kamilos</i> was coined specifically to contrive a variant interpretaion of the gospels.</p>

<p>And, by the way, that’s exactly what the Liddell &amp; Scott <i>Lexicon</i> suggested all along.</p>

<blockquote>
  Perh(aps) coined as an emendation of the phrase εὐκοπώτερόν ἐστι κάμηλον διὰ τρυπήματος ῥαφίδος διελθεῖν ... Ev.Matt. 19.24
  
</blockquote>

<p>(The Greek quotation is the ‘eye of a needle’ line in <i>Matthew</i>.)</p>

<p>The upshot is that <i>kamilos</i> is just like the ‘eye of the needle’ gate: it’s a fabrication, contrived specifically to make wealthy people happy about hoarding their wealth.</p>

<p>The only potential corroboration for its existence is source <b>j</b>, the Anarbazos inscription. There it’s part of a collocation where, <i>at best</i>, both words are unclear. I’ve argued above that καμηλ(&nbsp;) is a quantity, a καμηλ(ικός) or ‘camel load’, not a rope. Even if you disagree, still, the most the inscription can show is that <i>kamilos</i> existed as a hyper-rare word in 5th century Anatolia. Does it show anything about the 1st century? Absolutely not. The inscription is an obscure speculative possibility, not a corroboration for anything.</p>


<h2>What is it about camels, anyway?</h2>

<p>A rope through the eye of a needle would have been a <i>striking</i> choice of image. A camel is ... surreal.</p>

<p>As Zahn and many others have pointed out, it isn’t unique. It’s not a <i>common</i> expression, and the Christian gospels are its earliest appearance, but there are parallels in Rabbinic sources and in the Quran. The Rabbinic sources involve elephants, not camels, but still.</p>

<p>These parallels are late, like Cyril’s made-up word, so they’re not exactly overwhelming evidence. But they have one thing going for them that <i>kamilos</i> doesn’t: they use the expression <i>in the same way as</i> the gospels, not <i>as an annotation to</i> the gospels.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How will you know the thoughts of your heart? By their being revealed to you in a dream. Rava said: Know that this is the case, for one is neither shown a golden palm tree <b>nor an elephant going through the eye of a needle</b> in a dream. In other words, dreams only contain images that enter a person’s mind.</p>
  <p>Berakhot <a href="https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.55b.21?ven=William_Davidson_Edition_-_English&amp;lang=bi">55b.21</a></p>
  <p>Rav Sheshet said mockingly to him, employing a similar style: Perhaps you are from Pumbedita, <b>where people pass an elephant through the eye of a needle</b>, i.e., they engage in specious reasoning.</p>
  <p>Bava Metzia <a href="https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Metzia.38b.16?ven=William_Davidson_Edition_-_English&amp;lang=bi">38b.16</a></p>
  <p>Surely those who receive our revelations with denial and arrogance, the gates of heaven will not be opened for them, nor will they enter Paradise <b>until a camel passes through the eye of a needle</b>.</p>
  <p>Quran <a href="https://quran.com/7?startingVerse=40">7.40</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of these, the Rabbinic texts look like decent candidates for independent testimony. The Quran, less so: its version of the aphorism is almost identical to that in the gospels. The word used in Quran 7.40 is جمل <i>jamal</i> (‘camel’). Arabic dictionaries do record an alternate reading, with the word <i>jummal</i>, ‘rope’.</p>

<p>But don’t get excited. The only locus for <i>jummal</i> in the Arabic corpus is ... this exact verse in Sura 7.</p>

<blockquote>
  Some lexicographers wondered if <i>jummal</i> is a genuine Arabic word, and indeed it is used principally in speculation around Q 7:40. It is possible that Christian exegetical speculation surrounding the Greek word <i>kamēlos</i> influenced Muslim exegetical speculation surrounding the Arabic word <i>jamal</i> and led lexicographers to develop <i>jummal</i>, an equivalent of <i>kamilos</i>, as an alternative reading of <i>jamal</i>. What seems to confirm [this] ... is that, like Christian commentators, Muslim commentators report that the rope (<i>jummal</i>) in question is the sort used for seafaring.
  <p>Reynolds 2020: 49–50</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cyril strikes again. Everything to do with ropes in this context — Greek <i>*kamilos</i>, Aramaic <i>*gml</i>, and Arabic <i>*jummal</i> — goes back to Cyril inventing a fake word to keep rich people happy.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://stability.ai/news/stability-ai-sdxl-turbo">https://stability.ai/news/stability-ai-sdxl-turbo</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38450390">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1701191961235_4127">
  <p>Today, we are releasing SDXL Turbo, a new text-to-image mode. SDXL Turbo is based on a novel distillation technique called Adversarial Diffusion Distillation (ADD), which enables the model to synthesize image outputs in a single step and generate real-time text-to-image outputs while maintaining high sampling fidelity. For researchers and enthusiasts interested in technical details, our research paper is available <a href="https://stability.ai/research/adversarial-diffusion-distillation"><span>here</span></a>. It's important to note that SDXL Turbo is not yet intended for commercial use.</p><p><strong>Advantages of Adversarial Diffusion Distillation</strong></p><p>Featuring new advancements in diffusion model technologies, SDXL Turbo iterates on the foundation of SDXL 1.0 and implements a new distillation technique for text-to-image models: Adversarial Diffusion Distillation. By incorporating ADD, SDXL Turbo gains many advantages shared with GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks), such as single-step image outputs, while avoiding artifacts or blurriness often observed in other distillation methods. The SDXL Turbo research paper detailing this model’s new distillation technique is available <a href="https://stability.ai/research/adversarial-diffusion-distillation" target="_blank"><span>here</span></a>.</p><p><strong>Performance Benefits Compared to Other Diffusion Models</strong></p><p>To make the selection for SDXL Turbo, we compared multiple different model variants&nbsp;(StyleGAN-T++, OpenMUSE, IF-XL, SDXL, and LCM-XL) by generating outputs with the same prompt. Human evaluators were then shown two outputs at random and tasked to pick the output that most closely followed the direction of the prompt. Next, an additional test was completed with the same method for image quality. In these blind tests, SDXL Turbo was able to beat a 4-step configuration of LCM-XL with a single step, as well as beating a 50-step configuration of SDXL with only 4 steps. With these results, we can see SDXL Turbo outperforming a state-of-the-art multi-step model with substantially lower computational requirements without sacrificing image quality.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1701191961235_6047">
  <p>Additionally, SDXL Turbo provides major improvements to inference speed. On an A100, SDXL Turbo generates a 512x512 image in 207ms (prompt encoding + a single denoising step + decoding, fp16), where 67ms are accounted for by a single UNet forward evaluation.</p><p><strong>Explore SDXL Turbo with Clipdrop</strong></p><p>To test the capabilities of this new model, visit Stability AI's image editing platform, <a href="http://clipdrop.co/stable-diffusion-turbo" target="_blank"><span>Clipdrop,</span></a> for a beta demonstration of SDXL Turbo's real-time image generation.

After all, </span><em>most</em><span> </span><em>startups</em><span> are doomed, </span><a href="https://www.bls.gov/bdm/us_age_naics_00_table5.txt" rel="">just by the numbers</a><span>.</span></p><p>I’m trying to say something more provocative. Almost all startups formed from post-ChatGPT hype and who specifically label themselves as “AI startups” are doomed.</p><p>Now, I am a VC who has been investing in AI for a long time—and, in fact, originally left the hedge fund world because I saw so much happening in AI. So, I’m definitely not an AI skeptic.</p><p>That being said, I fundamentally think most of what’s getting funded in the current hype cycle is valueless from an investor’s perspective.</p><p>Let’s tackle the easiest case.</p><p><span>I’ve met numerous startups who essentially glue together a few generative AI APIs, do some prompt engineering, and slap a front-end user interface on it. Some of these products are </span><em>quite</em><span> impressive in terms of polish and what they can do.</span></p><p><span>These companies are also all doomed to either be perfectly ok businesses (but not </span><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/growth.html" rel="">startups, by Paul Graham’s classic definition</a><span>) or die.</span></p><p><span>Obviously, if you built it over a weekend, someone else can do the same. Now, let’s say you’re a coding genius. A veritable 10X programmer prodigy! It might take everyone else in the world </span><em>several</em><span> weekends… but it’s going to get built.</span></p><p>If you basically give your project’s product away for free and are just having fun, no big deal.</p><p>However, if you start charging for it and customers start relying on it a lot, others can come in and just slightly undercut you. Maybe yours is still nicer. Being nicer does often drive product adoption and choice of one over another.</p><p>But if it’s actually important (i.e., commands a high willingness to pay and is used frequently), this is where the curse of economics and competition come into play. People are going to copy you and compete away your profits.</p><p>No defensibility and no differentiation = no profits. That’s basic economics.</p><p>Ok, so that was Econ 101 and also Startup 101. It’s not particularly unique to this area. Every hype cycle is essentially characterized by people forgetting that these rules exist, and then rediscovering them to their chagrin at the end of the cycle.</p><p><span>However, note that I’ve mainly been talking about these startups that just glue together APIs like those from ChatGPT together into UIs. </span><em>Those</em><span> obviously have very little differentiation and defensibility. Even if your UI is nicer, someone else can just come along and copy it.</span></p><p>My point is broader than just those trivial examples, though.</p><p>Let’s now apply this same logic to the underlying technology itself for LLMs like ChatGPT, Bard, LlaMA, and the like.</p><p><span>If I told you I had a fantastic technology that </span><em>everyone</em><span> will want to use, and to create it, what I had to do was:</span></p><ol><li><p>Gather all the text on the internet</p></li><li><p>Train it all using tons of GPUs and millions of dollars</p></li><li><p>Built it on well-known technologies, most of which are open-source</p></li></ol><p><span>Is that defensible? Point 1 and 2 might have some level of technical or logistical difficulty for small startups, but neither of those are particular insurmountable for other large companies—especially when combined with the fact of Point 3. All of these things are built on the same underlying architecture in transformers and LLMs. </span><strong>These LLMs have no real moat. Any large internet company can replicate them.</strong></p><p><span>And, indeed, </span><a href="https://www.semianalysis.com/p/google-we-have-no-moat-and-neither" rel="">even Alphabet/Google internally have said this</a><span>.</span></p><p>The same applies for all image and video generative AIs. Just replace Point 1 with either images or video instead (side note: video may be an exception if Alphabet can choke off easy access to YouTube).</p><p>Ok, so we’ve established that it’s not super useful to just build an API in front of other people’s technologies (our trivial case). We’ve now also talked about why the less trivial case of LLMs is fundamentally indefensible.</p><p><span>What if I flex Point 3 above, and come up with the </span><em>best version of an LLM</em><span>? Or something like it in terms of some other field of AI?</span></p><p><span>Well, in theory, that’s interesting. Except, of course, for the fact of how fast the technological frontier of </span><em>the entire industry</em><span> is moving.</span></p><p><span>What if I told you in the 1990s that I had </span><em>the best</em><span> CPU? Mine is, like, 3 times the speed of Intel!</span></p><p><span>Given the expense and incredible difficulty of developing a CPU, that is indeed quite technically impressive! Of course, then the question is, can you repeat that feat year after year? Because your problem is, given how fast semiconductor technologies are moving at the time (Moore’s Law), you have an advantage for a year or two (maybe). Intel—and everyone else—will equal your performance. If you have some special sauce that lets you </span><em>continuously</em><span> stay ahead, that’s one thing, but more likely than not, you simply stumbled on a particular set of optimizations that everyone else will adopt quickly.</span></p><p>The same issue exists in AI today. The frontier is moving too fast, and the frontier of the entire AI academic and industry research community almost certainly has more firepower than your single company.</p><p>By the way, when we’re talking about firepower, this challenge applies even at the most massive scales. For example, China—by all quiet, anecdotal accounts—is not keeping up with the global (concentrated in the US) research community in the speed of AI development. Basically, everyone who branches off proprietary models falls behind quickly and ends up adopting the global state-of-the-art anyway. AI is just even worse than semiconductors because all of it tends to be open source, which just makes it even harder to hold any sort of long-standing advantage in algorithmic prowess.</p><p>As such, you don’t get any lasting value unless you’re able to make that year or two advantage actually count in building a lasting moat—which, if you think about it, is actually extremely hard.</p><p>Ok, so we’ve gone through this process of elimination. What’s actually left?</p><p><span>Well, you can either have something that’s so compute intensive that only you could possibly do the training or inference economically. That is unlikely, in my opinion, </span><a href="https://weightythoughts.com/p/compute-is-overrated-as-ais-bottleneck" rel="">given how AI has progressed in bringing down the quantity of data and compute required to achieve a certain result</a><span>. However, note that my opinion is somewhat unpopular. You can decide for yourself whether this point is true (which I talk about in the linked article above). However, least from an investor’s perspective, even if it </span><em>is</em><span> a true advantage, I’m uncertain whether I’m thrilled about a startup strategy to accumulate more GPUs/ASICs/FPGAs than Google, Facebook, Baidu, what have you…</span></p><p><span>Secondly, you can be operating in a place where you </span><em>can’t</em><span> simply harvest the data off the internet. For example, healthcare data that is siloed in hospitals, or not even collected at all today. Or, protein folding or pharmacokinetic reaction data that has to be painstakingly collected through real-world experiments. Or a ton of other things… all of which share the characteristic that it doesn’t exist in the pure digital world and can’t simply be scraped off the internet.</span></p><p><em>That</em><span> is where I see the value of most of AI startups being generated. Places where you can’t simply decide to go collect the data without prohibitive cost, time, and simply physical world messiness. These startups can simply ride the wave of AI improvements—it doesn’t matter, the algorithms are all commoditized anyway—but are the only ones who own and hold that proprietary, next-to-impossible to get real-world data.</span></p><p><span>Note, I mentioned </span><strong>startups</strong><span>. Many forget that just because value is created on a societal level, that doesn’t necessarily mean that the value is captured by a company at all. The Internet boom in the 1990s created tons of networking infrastructure, but the companies realized massively negative ROI from their investments. It was great for bringing communities online though, but that’s a societal benefit, not a company ROI.</span></p><p><span>In a more recent case, did you know that Azure actually runs </span><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/web3" rel="">tons of private blockchains</a><span>? It’s hard to actually break out on their financial results for various reasons, but many large companies run this stuff on Azure, making Microsoft one of the big winners in blockchain. (Yes, there’s a separate question of whether a private blockchain is really any different from, say, a database. But that’s irrelevant to my point here.)</span></p><p><span>The same thing is likely to happen with OpenAI, </span><a href="https://openai.com/blog/openai-and-microsoft-extend-partnership" rel="">where OpenAI mostly looks like an R&amp;D lab for Microsoft</a><span>. Microsoft provides the computing resources in Azure, and in return, OpenAI develops the tools that Azure will then provide as hosted services. Azure can then make a bunch of money from ChatGPT and other stuff that can be pay-as-you-go API calls. This, of course, also looks the same with Bard and Google Cloud Compute, etc. as we go.</span></p><p><span>This principle runs through most of the AI sector today. There’s going to be a </span><em>lot</em><span> of value generated that just accrues to society, and isn’t captured by any private player. Which is wonderful, by the way—this is how technology becomes one of the few “free lunches” we have in society and macroeconomics.</span></p><p>There’s also going to be a lot of value generated that is simply captured by existing industry incumbents, using their market power and scale. That’s not a free lunch for society, but is also just how capitalism works and often still generates “surplus” (Econ speak for “good stuff”) for society.</p><p><span>Finally, there’s a fairly </span><em>narrow</em><span> slice that will be both value generated, and accrue to new, young companies, that ideally then can come along and replace the incumbents (which is how healthy market turnover happens).</span></p><p><strong>Those</strong><span> are the companies that will generate outsized returns and become tomorrow’s well-known tech names—and, of course, are what VCs are theoretically looking for. In reality, most investors are being a bit more indiscriminate in slinging money at AI startups (and even big, public companies that claim to have an “AI strategy”) right now. And, as such, are mostly flushing money down the drain.</span></p><p>AI is going to change the world. But most AI startups are doomed.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>The program, which is chaired by the Crown Prince and his energy minister, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, aims to boost oil consumption across Asia and Africa, with the ultimate goal of protecting Saudi oil revenues from efforts to phase out fossil fuels.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia publicly claims to support the Paris climate change agreement, which aims to limit global temperature increases to 1.5C or 2C – requiring an almost total transformation of the way in which the world produces and consumes energy. The Crown Prince, also known as MBS, has said that the Kingdom needs to go “further and faster” in tackling climate change.</p>
<p>But an undercover investigation by the Centre for Climate Reporting (CCR) reveals how, in private, the Kingdom is seeking to ensure that emerging economies across Africa and Asia become vastly more dependent on oil, not less.</p>
<p>The Oil Demand Sustainability Program (OSP) is a vast government program with dozens of projects aimed at embedding a high-carbon, fossil fuel-dependent development model in countries across Africa and Asia. This includes meticulously researched plans to drive a major increase in gasoline and diesel-fuelled vehicles and boost jet fuel sales via increased air travel.</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;“There’s a fundamental policy aim, which is to burn and exploit all Saudi’s oil reserves until the last drop”</p></blockquote>
<p>It brings together the most powerful arms of the Saudi state, including the $700 billion Saudi Public Investment Fund; the world’s largest oil company, Saudi Aramco; petrochemicals giant, Sabic; and the Kingdom’s most important ministries – all under the auspices of the Crown Prince’s supreme committee of hydrocarbon affairs.</p>
<p>When asked by an undercover reporter whether the aim of the program is to artificially stimulate oil demand to counter global efforts to reduce oil consumption and tackle climate change, a Saudi official responded: “Yes… it is one of the main objectives that we are trying to accomplish.”</p>
<p>Following a six-month investigation, the Centre for Climate Reporting can – for the first time – reveal MBS’ secret plans to keep the world hooked on oil, even as the devastating impacts of global warming are beginning to bite.</p>
<p>The investigation, based on secret recordings, documents provided by Saudi officials to undercover reporters, and an analysis of regulatory filings, reveals:</p>
<ul>
<li>A sophisticated strategy to deploy fleets of petrol and diesel-fuelled vehicles across Asia and Africa so that Saudi Arabia can “capture the increasing gasoline/diesel demand.”</li>
<li>Plans to collaborate with an undisclosed global auto manufacturer to develop and produce a cheap car that can be sold in emerging markets to give “an oil uplift for the kingdom.”</li>
<li>Plans to fast-track commercial supersonic air travel, explicitly because it consumes three times more jet fuel than normal aircraft.</li>
<li>A plan to lobby against government subsidies for electric vehicles in countries around the world.</li>
<li>Plans to encourage the use of toxic heavy fuel oil to generate power in Africa and South Asia.</li>
</ul>
<p>Responding to the investigation, Mohamed Adow, director of Power Shift Africa, a non-governmental organisation based in Nairobi focused on climate change, told CCR: “The Saudi government is like a drug dealer trying to get Africa hooked on its harmful product. The rest of the world is cleaning up its act and weaning itself off dirty and polluting fossil fuels and Saudi Arabia is getting desperate for more customers and is turning its sights on Africa.”</p>
<p>“It’s like the tobacco companies that knew the addictive and lethal nature of cigarettes yet continued to get millions of teenagers hooked on them,” Adow said, “it’s repulsive”.</p>
<p>Akinbode Oluwafemi, executive director of Corporate Accountability and Public Participation Africa (CAPPA), a civil society organisation headquartered in Lagos, told CCR that Africa needs “infrastructure that will reduce carbon emissions and not exacerbate the climate crisis.”</p>
<p>“This Saudi model is a Greek gift that will further sink Africa into climate catastrophe,” Oluwafemi said.</p>
<p>The Saudi Arabia energy ministry did not respond to a request for comment.</p>

																	<h2>Climate leader</h2>
								
								<div>
									<p>Speaking at the<a href="https://saudigazette.com.sa/article/604892"> launch of the Saudi Green Initiative</a> in March 2021, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, also known as MBS, said the Kingdom would become a leader on climate change. He pledged to reduce Saudi emissions to net zero by 2060 and to play a leading role internationally to tackle climate change.</p>
<p>“The Kingdom, the region and the world needs to go much further and faster in combating climate change,” MBS said, “Young people, both in the kingdom and the world, are demanding a cleaner, greener and more inclusive future, and we owe it to them to deliver on this.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“OSP’s goal is to support the deployment of&nbsp; internal combustion engine fleets across developing countries”</p></blockquote>
<p>Since then, the Kingdom has gone to great lengths to promote these commitments, with<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNPQPo8-jNk"> glossy promotional videos</a> claiming the country is “leading the charge in tackling energy and climate challenges.”</p>
<p>Joanna Depledge, a Research Fellow at the University of Cambridge who has authored academic papers on Saudi climate obstruction, told CCR that, despite a recent shift in tone, little has changed in the way Saudi Arabia approaches the climate change: “There’s everything you can possibly do except for reducing oil and gas production and consumption. Every single trick in the book.”</p>
<p>“It’s all part of the delay,” Depledge said, “I think basically there’s a fundamental policy aim, which is to burn and exploit all Saudi’s oil reserves until the last drop. That’s what they plan to do but that involves, obviously, a delaying of the climate change agenda and that’s what they’re doing. And all this can help to delay it.”</p>
<p>At the same time as developing the Saudi Green Initiative, MBS has overseen the development of a program designed to reverse global progress on phasing out oil, something scientists say is crucial if the world is to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.</p>

																	<h2>Sustainable development</h2>
								
								<div>
									<p>Only a small amount of information about the Oil Demand Sustainability Program (OSP) is publicly available. On its website and social media channels, the Saudi energy ministry largely characterises the OSP as a sustainable development initiative aimed at providing energy access to emerging economies.</p>
<p>Regulatory filings seen by CCR suggest that this characterisation is part of a deliberate strategy to avoid public communications that might suggest the program’s primary aim is to boost Saudi oil sales. Filings on the Saudi stock exchange show that a May announcement of a deal between OSP and another state entity, the Saudi Industrial Export Company, was corrected because it accidentally referred to boosting oil demand, rather than fostering energy access.</p>
<p>In the first version of the announcement, the objective of the partnership was described as being “sustaining the demand of oil.” A day later a correction was issued, with this wording removed and replaced with “increase energy access.”</p>

											</div>

					
				
											<div>
									<p>CCR also found significant differences in the way the program is presented to English and Arabic speaking audiences, including its name. The English version of the Saudi energy ministry website states that the initiative is called the “Oil Sustainability Program” and says its mission is to ensure that “hydrocarbons remain part of the global energy mix in the most efficient and sustainable way.”</p>
<p>On the Arabic version of the website, the word sustainable appears to have a completely different meaning. The initiative is called برنامج استدامة الطلب على البترول which translates to “Oil Demand Sustainability Program.” It says its purpose is to “sustain and develop the demand for hydrocarbons” and ensure “that the transition in the energy mix takes place in an effective manner, sustainable for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.”</p>

																	<h2>Cape Town</h2>
								
								<div>
									<p>In May 2023, Mohammed Al Tayyar, head of the OSP, took to the stage at the annual conference of the African Refiners &amp; Distributors Association, a members-only event in the suburbs of Cape Town. He came with a message for the assembled politicians and oil executives: “come and work with us.”</p>
<p>According to documents and audio recordings obtained by CCR, Al Tayyar travelled to South Africa to pitch OSP as a sustainable development solution to Africa’s infrastructure problems, explaining how Saudi Arabia could help increase access to energy and facilitate investment in roads, airports, and the cars and planes to make use of them.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We are actually conducting some studies to understand the psychological behaviour of these countries”</p></blockquote>
<p>Al Tayyar said that his team had developed forty-six projects, or “opportunities,” and hundreds of pages of business development strategy. The plan, he said, is to engage with stakeholders, ranging from governments and companies to international investment funds, to make them a reality.</p>
<p>Following the Cape Town conference, undercover journalists for the Centre for Climate Reporting contacted the OSP officials who had travelled to South Africa to set up a meeting. The aim was to find out more about a program which, on the surface, appears to be about helping countries in Africa and Asia to grow their economies, but which appeared to be oriented around solutions that benefit the Saudi economy.</p>
								</div>
							</div>

					
				
											<div>
																	<h2>The pitch</h2>
								
								<div>
									<p>Posing as international investors interested in funding some of the projects identified by Al Tayyar, CCR reporters attended a remote video conference with Saudi officials in Riyadh, who pitched the program’s key projects as potential areas for collaboration. During this private pitch, Saudi officials presented a different image of the OSP, based on slides not shown by Al Tayyar in Cape Town, which revealed an overriding objective to boost sales of Saudi oil.</p>
<p>The OSP officials detailed a vastly ambitious scheme, with plans to channel investment into ports, airports and roads across Asia and Africa, while ensuring that the ships, aeroplanes, cars and buses that use this infrastructure are powered by Saudi oil rather than cleaner forms of energy.</p>
<p>One of the officials, Nawaf Al-Fallaj, told the undercover reporters that the program’s forty-six projects had been selected from an initial batch of eighty, based partly on the scale to which they could boost oil demand, something he described as their “incremental demand potential”. He added that Saudi Arabia plans to deploy its sovereign wealth funds and diplomatic influence to make these projects a reality.</p>
<p>A slide deck shared on the call states that the strategy underpinning the program is to “unlock demand in emerging markets.” Undercover reporters asked the officials on the call if the aim is to artificially stimulate demand in emerging markets in order to offset a decline in oil demand due to efforts to tackle climate change. “Yes”, Al-Fallaj replied, “it’s one of the main objectives that we are trying to accomplish.”</p>

											<div>
																	<h2>Increasing demand</h2>
								
								<div>
									<p>At the heart of the program is a plan to make sure that people around the world continue to drive diesel and petrol fuelled vehicles rather than switching to electric.</p>
<p>Saleh Aldayel, one of the OSP officials on the call, told undercover reporters that the plan is to facilitate investment in highways across Africa and Asia and to then fill these roads with vehicles that depend on oil. “In [the] case of roads, we aim to accelerate and enhance the impact and adoption of internal combustion engine technology,” Aldayel said</p>
<p>OSP officials were explicit about why Saudi Arabia wants to increase the number of oil-fuelled vehicles on the road, a slide deck shared by Aldayel states: “OSP’s goal is to support the deployment of ICE [internal combustion engine] fleets across developing countries to capture the increasing gasoline/diesel demand.”</p>
<p>This includes the development of ride hailing companies and local and regional bus companies. “OSP’s goal is to support the deployment of bus transportation across developing countries to capture the increasing diesel demand,” the presentation states.</p>
<p>Crucially, OSP officials said that they are in discussions with an undisclosed global auto manufacturer to develop cheap mass market cars that run on petrol or diesel and can be sold at scale in emerging markets. This would, Aldayel’s presentation says, “have an oil uplift for the kingdom.”</p>
<p>Aldayel explained there is “an opportunity for increasing availability and adoption of low-cost cars, especially in emerging markets.” This could, he said, either be through a joint venture with a car manufacturer or via micro-financing.</p>
								</div>
							</div>

					
				
											

					
				
											<div>
									<p>When undercover reporters asked for more information about the program, such as the scale of investment OSP would be undertaking and how much more oil Saudi Arabia wants to sell, they were told they would need to sign a non-disclosure agreement. But the Saudi officials did outline the detailed work that is going into the project, including psychological studies in emerging economies and mapping existing infrastructure in order to best target markets with cheap oil-fuelled vehicles.</p>
<p>“We are actually conducting some studies to understand the psychological behaviour, the infrastructure readiness of these countries, what type of cars are possible to be deployed there and even the financial capabilities of certain countries,” Aldayel said.</p>
<p>“So, it’s different from country to country. You can deploy two-wheelers in some countries, in other countries or other regions, you cannot go with the two-wheelers you have to have 4×4 cars, the smaller ones, the ones that are cheaper with not the advanced features that is more appealing for more developed countries,” he continued, “and we build a model that suits that country.”</p>

											<div>
																	<h2>Unfair</h2>
								
								<div>
									<p>OSP officials also made it clear that Saudi Arabia sees the spread of electric vehicles (EVs) as a threat. They complained that EVs are being favoured with subsidies and other “regulatory advantages” and suggested that they might not even be better for the climate than internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEV).</p>
<p>“You know the situation that EVs are being favoured in terms of subsidies and regulatory advantage, irrespective of the actual economic and environmental competitiveness,” Aldayel said, “what we are working on is to support, to increase internal combustion engine adoptions… promoted through fair policies by working with regulators and industry leaders.”</p>
<p>The presentation shared by OSP officials claims that “global emissions regulations can be met by improved internal combustion engine vehicles and fair regulations.” It says this can partly be achieved through Saudi diplomacy, or “Kingdom relations,” and work with industry and regulators to promote internal combustion engine vehicles “through science and fair policies.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“Obviously aviation is a key market for them”</p></blockquote>
<p>The presentation shared by officials on the call describes a program of “regulatory advocacy” to “shape local and international viewpoints for policymakers,” “promote fair policies,” and “ensure the Kingdom’s view is represented in relevant global forums.”</p>
<p>A 2021<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/21/climate/saudi-arabia-aramco-oil-solar-climate.html"> New York Times investigation</a> found that Saudi Aramco has funded huge amounts of scientific research into contentious energy issues in recent years, including studies aimed at keeping petrol and diesel vehicles competitive or casting doubt on electric vehicles.</p>
<p>Al-Tayyar, the head of OSP, told his Cape Town audience that the mining that is required for EVs will also create emissions, adding “so, we need to be very careful in pushing hard on one mode versus the other. Our view on which we base all of our efforts is having a more inclusive approach, we will need all of the above to help increase connectivity and mobility globally and Africa is a prime example for that ability to do so.”</p>
								</div>
							</div>

					
				
											<div>
																	<h2>Supersonic flight</h2>
								
								<div>
									<p>Saudi Arabia is also a major retailer of jet fuel and OSP officials outlined plans aimed at increasing sales around the world. This includes a plan to help fast-track the commercialisation of supersonic air travel, something that hasn’t been seen the demise of Concord.</p>
<p>The presentation makes clear that the incentive for doing so is that “supersonic aviation consumes more energy”, detailing that it uses three times the energy of subsonic commercial aircraft.</p>
<p>In October 2023, Saudi Arabia’s $500 billion NEOM project<a href="https://www.neom.com/en-us/newsroom/neom-announces-investment-fund"> announced</a> that it had made an investment in<a href="https://boomsupersonic.com/faq"> Boom Technology</a>, a<a href="https://www.axios.com/local/raleigh/2023/11/13/boom-supersonic-nears-first-test"> $700 million start-up</a> that aims to make commercial supersonic air travel a reality by 2030.</p>
<p>OSP also plans to facilitate investment into low-cost airlines in emerging economies across Asia and Africa. The presentation states that OSP could “facilitate investment in existing low-cost carriers with potential for expansion to fund growth through the acquisition of new aircraft and routes.”</p>
<p>To help manage the climate impacts of these plans, OSP officials said that Saudi Arabia is investing in an optimised jet fuel with at least 10% less greenhouse gas emissions compared to conventional jet fuel.</p>
<p>Joanna Depledge told CCR that Saudi obstruction has led to very little action on tackling emissions from aviation: “It’s really quite extraordinary what they’ve got away with,” she said, “they’ve just said no, even to any debate.”</p>
<p>“Because obviously, aviation is a key market for them,” Depledge said.</p>

											<div>
																	<h2>Floating power plants</h2>
								
								<div>
									<p>In addition to transport, Saudi Arabia is also hoping to increase the use of fossil fuels for generating electricity in developing countries. The presentation portrays this as a sustainable development initiative, but the proposed solutions depend upon countries importing Saudi diesel and highly polluting heavy fuel oil.</p>
<p>This includes a plan to create “oil-powered mini-grids” in landlocked countries across Africa and South Asia. Nawaf Al-Fallaj told undercover reporters the plan is “comprised of mini-grid and off-grid power generation and includes the use of diesel and HFO [heavy fuel oil] and hybrid systems also.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“Africa has the largest potential for green energy, why can’t the Saudis fund the development of those types of infrastructure”</p></blockquote>
<p>OSP officials also outlined a plan to use “floating power plants” off the coast of Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Power ships<a href="https://www.karadenizholding.com/uploads/2020-6/15934405989512020-karpowership-brochure-englishpdf.pdf"> use heavy fuel oil or liquefied natural gas</a> – usually whichever is cheapest at the time – to generate electricity. They have<a href="https://www.france24.com/en/20180823-lebanon-heavy-price-fuel-burning-barges-solve-energy-crisis"> proven controversial</a> in the past, with countries locked into high cost contracts and burning highly polluting heavy fuel oil in close proximity to towns and cities.</p>
<p>The officials added that, as part of the OSP strategy, Saudi Arabia would be accelerating upgrades to its heavy fuel oil refining capacity.</p>

																	<h2>Leapfrogging</h2>
								
								<div>
									<p>When asked by an undercover reporter if the Saudi strategy is to ensure that developing countries don’t “leapfrog” fossil fuel-based development in favour of cleaner options like renewable energy and electrified transport, a Saudi official smiled and said “actually, we don’t believe it’s possible that they can skip this phase.”</p>
<p>Mohamed Adow of Power Shift Africa told CCR: “I will strongly disagree with anyone who says that Africa can’t leapfrog. Africa has all the essential ingredients to allow it to move away from fossil fuels.”</p>
<p>“But we need investment from rich countries that claim to be climate leaders,” Adow said, “otherwise we can expect more dodgy deals like this one, which endangers not just Africans but the global effort to ensure a safe and prosperous climate for all.”</p>
<p>Akinbode Oluwafemi of CAPPA told CCR: “As an African, I feel insulted that the Saudis think Africa is not ripe for a green economy and just transition. What Africa needs is sustainable climate financing that will allow the continent to make the transition to a climate resilient economy.”</p>
<p>“Africa has the largest potential for green energy, why can’t the Saudis fund the development of those types of infrastructure,” Oluwafemi said.</p>

																	<h2>Putting it into action</h2>
								
								<div>
									<p>Earlier this month, Saudi energy minister, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman,<a href="https://www.spa.gov.sa/en/N1994212"> signed memoranda of understanding</a> with Rwanda, Nigeria, Chad, Ethiopia and Senegal during a diplomatic conference in Riyadh.</p>
<p>The agreements were part of an<a href="https://www.moenergy.gov.sa/en/MediaCenter/ClimateWeek/Pages/OSP-Announces-Empowering-Africa-with-Several-Saudi-Ministries.aspx"> OSP initiative</a> called “Empowering Africa,” which is framed as a sustainable development program that will fund electric cooking stoves and introduce “connectivity solutions, e-education platforms, and e-health services to rural areas in Africa.”</p>
<p>But the memoranda of understanding struck by Abdulaziz bin Salman this month as part of the initiative appear to largely focus upon oil and gas supply. This includes a deal between the<a href="https://www.spa.gov.sa/en/N1994212"> OSP and Rwanda</a> to “develop demand for hydrocarbon resources” and an agreement with Ethiopia to “<a href="https://www.ena.et/web/eng/w/eng_3559421">cooperate on oil supply</a>”. An<a href="https://twitter.com/senlokpobiri/status/1722677232131293579?s=20"> agreement with Nigeria</a> also focuses on cooperation in the oil and gas sector.</p>
<p>Significantly, the Saudi energy minister is reported to have framed the initiative as an alternative to the<a href="https://www.unep.org/about-un-environment/funding-and-partnerships/green-climate-fund"> Green Climate Fund</a>, which was set up as part of the UN climate process to support developing countries to transition to cleaner forms of energy and transport. According to Saudi newspaper, Arab News, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said at the event: “we have asked many of our colleagues in Africa if they have received any of the climate fund. I have yet to hear any who have.”</p>
<p>“Economies of Africa need to grow,” he added, “the people of Africa need to prosper, if these two things happen the world economy will grow and there will be a rippling effect.”</p>
<p>According to Adow: “A just transition is what Africa requires and Africans need to be proactive and ensure that the narrative of a just transition is not appropriated by polluters. We don’t want Africa’s poverty and Africa’s low emissions used to now undermine Africa’s future development.”</p>
<p>“I think the dominant narrative is that Africa lacks the resources,” Adow said, “and so you can then justify any infrastructure development including dirty development on that basis. ​​But what that misses is – if you look at the history of the world and the fossil heavy development that powered the advanced economies – that is what caused the climate crisis in the first place. And so, as the most vulnerable geography but also the one that is incredibly blessed with renewables, Africa can avoid the pitfalls of the past and realise the new opportunities of the twenty-first century.”</p>

A lot of people are starting to ask the obvious question: How much will it cost in practice, and what does this mean for the future of data infrastructure?</p><p>The first thing to know is that the new S3 Express storage class costs 8x more than S3 Standard per GiB stored which makes it unsuitable as the “primary” store for big data systems like Kafka and traditional data lakes.</p><p>However, individual API operations are 50% cheaper. 50% cheaper is great, but it’s not 10-20x cheaper. That means any workloads that were previously impractical due to S3 API operation costs are still impractical with the new Express storage class. Unlike S3 Standard, however, the new Express class also charges per GiB for every API operation (writes + reads) beyond 512 KiB. Another way to think about this is that every API operation comes with 512 KiB of bandwidth “free” and you pay for every byte beyond that.</p><p>We did some simple cost modeling, and this is what the cost profile looks like for PUT requests:</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/64baaecd9c5c9b1b6c38aa0e/65662d4cd70380bc272850aa_4VB-0B8xqVF-KV7SQJVva1SbY9yF_MTdx21MRZ8qkLhtD-IeeZ7KHJAk2taIf-Q0llwn3nV2JVz9Wu-c5tHiI9aVofHS90vAnYEg0mKTmqmNzzzFdgssX5LTG5i27yf-MfE9Y2qauY3GerhQey89JsRveUhiuplKpAfsLtlAshyz5c4926NieNl31ldsPw.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>Here’s what it looks like for GET requests:</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/64baaecd9c5c9b1b6c38aa0e/65662d4c9218cb461083df45_IsQ0xVYKFe6iiyW_Rl-Kkl6tibNJvatMT_l0fuoGae0Ux15JisBIX0Jfe4iLG6OJcee8DxPxA0_jI9p83pb75UUYftuzy0Hd1pqruQo0a4QoLZBCzIpOoRpGTKbaUklY8Z5PZifSEf0Ue5hAF3an-8uDx0QCJXid2cSYlvimQVpV3vUnX_vkfwwlbTyLeQ.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>However, remember that the new Express storage class is <em>single zone</em>.

In other words, for high volume use cases, the new S3 Express storage class does not expose many new opportunities for dramatic improvements in cost or performance compared to traditional doubly or triply replicated storage systems.</p><p>However, the new storage class does open up an exciting new opportunity for all modern data infrastructure: the ability to tune an individual workload for low latency and higher cost or higher latency and lower cost <em>with the exact same architecture and code</em>.&nbsp;This will be a huge leap forward for modern data infrastructure as there is no longer any reason to design any large-scale modern data system around the availability of local disks, or block storage (like EBS).</p><p>All modern data systems, even those that need to serve low latency operational workloads, can now be built completely around object storage with data tiering only performed <em>between object storage tiers</em>. In the worst case scenario, it will still be cheaper, more durable, and significantly less error prone than manually replicating data at the application layer. In the best case scenario, you’ll be able to cut costs by an order of magnitude for high volume use cases without touching a line of code.</p><p>Of course the AWS S3 Express storage costs are still 8x higher than S3 standard, but that’s a non issue for any modern data storage system. Data can be trivially landed into low latency S3 Express buckets, and then compacted out to S3 Standard buckets asynchronously. Most modern data systems already have a form of compaction anyways, so this “storage tiering” is effectively free.</p><p>At WarpStream, we’re betting on the future of data streaming being completely object storage based.

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Training Procedure</h2>
<p dir="auto">We used the <a href="https://github.com/epfLLM/Megatron-LLM">Megatron-LLM</a> distributed training library, a derivative of Nvidia's Megatron LM project, to optimize training efficiency.
Hardware consists of 16 nodes of 8x NVIDIA A100 (80GB) SXM GPUs connected by NVLink and NVSwitch with a single Nvidia ConnectX-6 DX network card and equipped with 2 x AMD EPYC 7543 32-Core Processors and 512 GB of RAM.
The nodes are connected via RDMA over Converged Ethernet.</p>
<p dir="auto">Our three-way parallelism scheme uses the following:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Data Parallelism (DP -- different GPUs process different subsets of the batches) of 2,</li>
<li>Pipeline Parallelism (PP -- different GPUs process different layers) of 8,</li>
<li>Tensor Parallelism (TP -- different GPUs process different subtensors for matrix multiplication) of 8.</li>
</ul>

<p dir="auto">Meditron-70B is being made available for further testing and assessment as an AI assistant to enhance clinical decision-making and democratize access to an LLM for healthcare use. Potential use cases may include but are not limited to:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Medical exam question answering</li>
<li>Supporting differential diagnosis</li>
<li>Disease information (symptoms, cause, treatment) query</li>
<li>General health information query</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">It is possible to use this model to generate text, which is useful for experimentation and understanding its capabilities. It should not be used directly for production or work that may impact people.</p>
