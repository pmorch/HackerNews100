<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It was a late evening.</p>
<p>My colleague has just checked in the code that they’ve been writing all week. We were working on a graphics editor canvas, and they implemented the ability to resize shapes like rectangles and ovals by dragging small handles at their edges.</p>
<p>The code worked.</p>
<p>But it was repetitive. Each shape (such as a rectangle or an oval) had a different set of handles, and dragging each handle in different directions affected the shape’s position and size in a different way. If the user held Shift, we’d also need to preserve proportions while resizing. There was a bunch of math.</p>
<p>The code looked something like this:</p>
<div data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre tabindex="0" data-language="jsx" data-theme="default"><code data-language="jsx" data-theme="default"><span data-line=""><span>let </span><span>Rectangle</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>{</span></span>

<p>That repetitive math was really bothering me.</p>
<p>It wasn’t <em>clean</em>.</p>
<p>Most of the repetition was between similar directions. For example, <code>Oval.resizeLeft()</code> had similarities with <code>Header.resizeLeft()</code>. This was because they both dealt with dragging the handle on the left side.</p>
<p>The other similarity was between the methods for the same shape. For example, <code>Oval.resizeLeft()</code> had similarities with the other <code>Oval</code> methods. This was because they all dealt with ovals. There was also some duplication between <code>Rectangle</code>, <code>Header</code>, and <code>TextBlock</code> because text blocks <em>were</em> rectangles.</p>
<p>I had an idea.</p>
<p>We could <em>remove all duplication</em> by grouping the code like this instead:</p>
<div data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre tabindex="0" data-language="jsx" data-theme="default"><code data-language="jsx" data-theme="default"><span data-line=""><span>let </span><span>Directions</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>{</span></span>

<span data-line=""><span>  </span><span>},</span></span>

<p>The code is half the total size, and the duplication is gone completely! So <em>clean</em>. If we want to change the behavior for a particular direction or a shape, we could do it in a single place instead of updating methods all over the place.</p>
<p>It was already late at night (I got carried away). I checked in my refactoring to master and went to bed, proud of how I untangled my colleague’s messy code.</p>
<h2>The Next Morning</h2>
<p>… did not go as expected.</p>
<p>My boss invited me for a one-on-one chat where they politely asked me to revert my change. I was aghast. The old code was a mess, and mine was <em>clean</em>!</p>
<p>I begrudgingly complied, but it took me years to see they were right.</p>
<h2>It’s a Phase</h2>
<p>Obsessing with “clean code” and removing duplication is a phase many of us go through. When we don’t feel confident in our code, it is tempting to attach our sense of self-worth and professional pride to something that can be measured. A set of strict lint rules, a naming schema, a file structure, a lack of duplication.</p>
<p>You can’t automate removing duplication, but it <em>does</em> get easier with practice. You can usually tell whether there’s less or more of it after every change. As a result, removing duplication feels like improving some objective metric about the code. Worse, it messes with people’s sense of identity: <em>“I’m the kind of person who writes clean code”</em>. It’s as powerful as any sort of self-deception.</p>
<p>Once we learn how to create <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sandimetz.com/blog/2016/1/20/the-wrong-abstraction">abstractions</a>, it is tempting to get high on that ability, and pull abstractions out of thin air whenever we see repetitive code. After a few years of coding, we see repetition <em>everywhere</em> — and abstracting is our new superpower. If someone tells us that abstraction is a <em>virtue</em>, we’ll eat it. And we’ll start judging other people for not worshipping “cleanliness”.</p>
<p>I see now that my “refactoring” was a disaster in two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Firstly, I didn’t talk to the person who wrote it. I rewrote the code and checked it in without their input. Even if it <em>was</em> an improvement (which I don’t believe anymore), this is a terrible way to go about it. A healthy engineering team is constantly <em>building trust</em>. Rewriting your teammate’s code without a discussion is a huge blow to your ability to effectively collaborate on a codebase together.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Secondly, nothing is free. My code traded the ability to change requirements for reduced duplication, and it was not a good trade. For example, we later needed many special cases and behaviors for different handles on different shapes. My abstraction would have to become several times more convoluted to afford that, whereas with the original “messy” version such changes stayed easy as cake.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Am I saying that you should write “dirty” code? No. I suggest to think deeply about what you mean when you say “clean” or “dirty”. Do you get a feeling of revolt? Righteousness? Beauty? Elegance? How sure are you that you can name the concrete engineering outcomes corresponding to those qualities? How exactly do they affect the way the code is written and <a href="https://overreacted.io/optimized-for-change/">modified</a>?</p>
<p>I sure didn’t think deeply about any of those things. I thought a lot about how the code <em>looked</em> — but not about how it <em>evolved</em> with a team of squishy humans.</p>
<p>Coding is a journey. Think how far you came from your first line of code to where you are now. I reckon it was a joy to see for the first time how extracting a function or refactoring a class can make convoluted code simple. If you find pride in your craft, it is tempting to pursue cleanliness in code. Do it for a while.</p>
<p>But don’t stop there. Don’t be a clean code zealot. Clean code is not a goal. It’s an attempt to make some sense out of the immense complexity of systems we’re dealing with. It’s a defense mechanism when you’re not yet sure how a change would affect the codebase but you need guidance in a sea of unknowns.</p>
<p>Let clean code guide you. <strong>Then let it go.</strong></p></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>METHODOLOGY</h2>
                        </header>

<p>Across Europe, welfare systems are increasingly deploying predictive risk assessments. The scores they produce can have life-changing implications for some of the continent’s most vulnerable populations. Over the past two years, Lighthouse Reports and its media partners have used freedom-of-information laws to obtain and take apart these systems from the inside out. <a href="https://www.lighthousereports.com/investigation/suspicion-machines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Our reporting</a> has travelled across the Netherlands, Spain, Denmark, and Serbia and found evidence of discrimination, privacy invasions and fundamental design flaws — and told the stories of those most affected.</p>
<p>Lighthouse Reports partnered with Le Monde to investigate an algorithm deployed by France’s <em>Caisse Nationale des Allocations Familiales</em> (CNAF), the agency responsible for the French social security system. The algorithm, deployed for more than 10 years, attempts to predict which benefit recipients are committing fraud. All of the more than 13 million households, — representing nearly half the population — who receive some type of benefit are assigned a risk score. Using French freedom-of-information laws, Le Monde obtained the source code for three risk-scoring models deployed by the CNAF between 2010 and 2023.</p>
<p>This far-reaching access enabled <em>Le Monde</em> and Lighthouse to take apart the model and test which types of people were more likely to be flagged for investigation. In December of 2023, we co-published a <a href="https://www.lighthousereports.com/investigation/frances-digital-inquisition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">four-part</a> series based on the results of our analysis, interviews with insiders, and testimony of benefit recipients flagged for investigation.</p>
<p>In this methodology, Lighthouse and <em>Le Monde</em> explain how we analysed the CNAF’s algorithm to demonstrate that it systematically targets people in the most precarious situations while making it nearly impossible for the better off to be investigated.</p>
<p>France is an early member of a club of European nations that have deployed risk scoring in their welfare system. In 2010, officials deployed an algorithm that scores and ranks the country’s millions of benefit recipients by their alleged fraud risk. Until now, benefit recipients have had little insight into the risk score assigned to them — but hundreds of thousands have experienced the consequences.</p>
<p>Those flagged as high risk are subject to special investigations where fraud controllers are empowered to visit people’s homes unannounced, <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2021/02/20/l-entretien-avec-l-agent-de-la-caf-a-ete-une-humiliation-les-beneficiaires-du-rsa-dans-l-enfer-des-controles_6070648_3224.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">count toothbrushes</a> to guess how many people live there, question their neighbours and scour bank records. Of the more than 100,000 people flagged annually for such investigations, nearly seven in ten are selected because of a high risk score. For vulnerable recipients who struggle to navigate the complex rules of the French social security system, the risk of their benefits being reclaimed or terminated is high — even if they unintentionally committed mistakes.</p>
<p>Use of the social security system in France is widespread and benefits like family subsidies are used by people across the socioeconomic spectrum. We set out to investigate whether there are patterns in which profiles received the highest scores. Our analysis found that the model systematically assigns higher scores to vulnerable people, including single parents, people who struggle to pay bills, and people who receive disability benefits. This includes characteristics that are explicitly protected under French anti-discrimination law and arguably, are what led them to need benefits in the first place.</p>

<h2>Materials &amp; Preparation</h2>
<p>Over the past two years, digital rights groups <em>La Quadrature du Net and Changer de Cap</em> have tirelessly <a href="https://www.laquadrature.net/2022/12/23/notation-des-allocataires-febrile-la-caf-senferme-dans-lopacite/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">campaigned</a> for greater transparency for algorithms deployed in the public sector. In late 2022, they successfully argued in front of France’s Commission for Access to Administrative Documents (CADA) that the CNAF should have to release the source code for previous versions of its risk assessment algorithm. Their own analysis of many of the same materials we received can be found <a href="https://www.laquadrature.net/2023/11/27/notation-des-allocataires-lindecence-des-pratiques-de-la-caf-desormais-indeniable/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>In June of 2023, Le Monde requested the source code and documentation for the CNAF’s fraud detection model. The CNAF disclosed redacted source code for the current model, which has been deployed nationally since 2020. While most of the variable names in the code were redacted (ie. renamed to “variable_1”, ”variable_2”), ten variables were still visible. It is unclear whether this was intentional.</p>
<p>The agency sent full source code for the models used between 2010 – 2014 and 2014 – 2020 with variable names left unredacted. In addition to disclosing source code, the CNAF also disclosed aggregate statistics from 2020 to today concerning investigations started by their current model.</p>


</section>
<section id="section-2">
<h2>The Models </h2>
<p>The three risk-scoring models disclosed by CNAF are constructed using logistic regression, a relatively simple machine learning algorithm. Similar to other supervised machine learning algorithms, logistic regression combs through datasets in order to learn which characteristics are most predictive of a target (e.g. mistake or note mistake).</p>
<p>The CNAF trains its models on households who were randomly investigated as part of the <em>Paiement à bon droit Fraudes</em> (PBDF), an annual survey. Unlike other models we have investigated, this means that the CNAF’s model is presumably trained on a large, representative training dataset.</p>
<p>In a training manual obtained by <em>Le Monde</em> for the current model, the CNAF writes that its investigations are labelled according to the amount of money the CNAF has overpaid the beneficiary. According to the manual, it decides to train its model to detect monthly overpayments of €600 euros or more that have occurred over a period of at least six months. It justifies this choice of label because it is “neither too rare nor too frequent” and “covers 98% of fraudulent payments.”</p>
<p>All of the three models are written in SAS, a programming language designed for statistical analysis. In order to calculate the risk score, the code first loads a number of variables. Each of the possible values a variable can take on, such as <em>has_children or no_children</em>, is then assigned a coefficient (ie. weight) between -0.81 and +0.89. The coefficients are added to create a raw score between -12.89 and 9.83. Finally, the raw score is run through a squasher function that outputs a probabilistic risk score between 0 and 1, where 1 is the highest risk of fraud. A raw score of 0 corresponds to a risk score of 0.5.</p>
<p>In order to ‘squash’ the raw score, logistic regression models use a sigmoid function. This means that the relationship between the raw score and the risk score is not linear. Rather, the risk score rises steeply towards one at the centre and then levels off as it approaches one.</p>
<figure id="attachment_1782" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1782"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.lighthousereports.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Sigmoid-Screenshot-980x400.png" alt="" width="980" height="400" srcset="https://www.lighthousereports.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Sigmoid-Screenshot-980x400.png 980w, https://www.lighthousereports.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Sigmoid-Screenshot-300x123.png 300w, https://www.lighthousereports.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Sigmoid-Screenshot-768x314.png 768w, https://www.lighthousereports.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Sigmoid-Screenshot-1536x628.png 1536w, https://www.lighthousereports.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Sigmoid-Screenshot-1500x613.png 1500w, https://www.lighthousereports.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Sigmoid-Screenshot.png 1630w" sizes="(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1782">Sigmoid function where the x-axis is the raw score and the y-axis is the risk score.</figcaption></figure>
<p>This non-linear relationship makes it difficult to quantify the impact of different variables on the raw score. The effect of a variable on a <em>raw score</em> is always the same whereas the effect of a variable on the risk score changes depending on how high or low the risk score is. A variable will have the most effect on the risk score when the raw score is close to zero.</p>
<p>For the purposes of our analysis, we use the raw score whenever we compare the effect of different traits. We use the risk score whenever we want to illustrate how different traits move an individual closer to or further away from the high-risk threshold that flags someone for investigation.</p>
</section>
<section id="section-3">
<h2>Analysis &amp; Results</h2>
<p>Nearly half of France’s population is scored each year by the model. In principle, this means that a wide variety of people are at risk of being flagged for an investigation. We wanted to test which profiles receive high scores in practice and why. For the purposes of our analysis, we focused on the model deployed between 2014 and 2020 because it was the most recent unredacted version — although we also tested the 2010 to 2014 model.</p>
<p>Our analysis looked at all of the 33 variables used by the 2014 to 2020 model, but we were especially interested in testing variables related to a beneficiary’s demographic features and their financial resources. We were further interested in variables relating to characteristics covered by French anti-discrimination law, which prohibits direct or indirect discrimination on the basis of family status, age, disability and “economic vulnerability.”</p>
</section>
<section id="section-4">
<h2>Performance</h2>
<p>In response to a request for information, the CNAF released aggregated outcome data on the effectiveness of its model. The data covers the more than 700,000 investigations that have been started by the model since 2019.</p>
<p>Of the households flagged by the model, 35 percent had to repay part of their benefit to the CNAF. This amounts to an average of €821 euros repaid per investigation for a total of approximately €604 million euros since 2019. Seventeen percent of investigations started by the model conclude that the CNAF actually owes money to the beneficiary.</p>
<p>We could not compare the model’s performance against randomly-started investigations from the same timespan. However, a document disclosed by CNAF states that approximately 15 percent of random investigations in the 2016 and 2017 <em>Paiement à bon droit Fraudes</em> survey concluded that a beneficiary owed money to the CNAF.</p>
</section>
<section id="section-5">
<h2>Variables</h2>
<p>In order to calculate risk scores, the CNAF’s model uses 33 variables that in total can take on over 100 values. These variables range from the age of a beneficiary’s children to the types of benefits they receive to the number of addresses they have lived at. More than half of the variables relate to the demographics of a beneficiary and their financial resources. The rest relate to their interactions with the CNAF and changes to their address.</p>
<p>When we examined the individual impact of the values these variables can take on, we found stark differences. Generally speaking, variables that capture precarity increase risk scores. You can see Appendix II for the full single variable results.</p>
<p>– For variables related to financial resources, having a high income dramatically reduces a beneficiary’s risk score. Meanwhile, having a low disposable income and receiving benefits for low-income households increase a beneficiary’s risk score.</p>
<p>– For variables related to a beneficiary’s characteristics, being young and receiving disability benefits increase a beneficiary’s risk score.</p>
<p>– For variables related to a beneficiary’s family and relationships, having children, especially if they are older than 18, increases a beneficiary’s risk score. Being divorced and declaring a change to your family situation (e.g. a child moving out, a new partner) dramatically increases a beneficiary’s risk score.</p>


</section>
<section id="section-6">
<h2>Profiles</h2>
<p>After establishing which variables had the most substantial impact on scores, we created profiles — combinations of variables — to see which types of people were especially at risk of being flagged.<br>
We constructed profiles of benefit recipients based on some of the most impactful characteristics from the single variable findings.</p>
<p>For each profile, we kept our variables of interest constant. For example, for our struggling parent profile we set the <em>has children</em> variable to True and their <em>income per household member</em> to the value <em>€577 to €942 euros</em>. See Appendix I to see which variables we kept constant for each profile. We then varied all other variables to calculate the minimum, maximum and average raw score per profile. Finally, each of these was fed through the sigmoid function and converted to a risk score. For a more detailed explanation of how we calculated the average risk score, see Appendix III.</p>
<p>While CNAF’s model is deployed nationally, investigations are carried out by regional CNAF offices. This means that the risk score distribution — and hence high risk cutoff — presumably is different per region. Statistics provided by the CNAF however show that 89 percent of the beneficiaries flagged by the model have a risk of score of 0.6 or higher. We therefore used 0.6 as an approximate high risk cutoff.</p>

<p>We found large disparities in which profiles were more likely to pass the high risk threshold that would leave them flagged for an investigation. A family with stable income has an average risk score of just 0.33. Nearly all other variables would have to be set to values that increase their risk score for them to pass the high risk threshold. Meanwhile, a person who works and receives disability has an average risk score of 0.66, which is already past the high risk threshold.</p>
</section>
<section id="section-7">
<h2>Threshold Effect</h2>
<p>The majority of the variables related to a beneficiary’s behaviour capture their interactions with the social security system over the last 18 months. The values for these variables — as well as other variables — are divided by hard cutoffs. We do not know how these cutoffs were determined, but the result is that small changes in behaviour can impact the risk score in erratic ways.</p>
<p>The variable <em>Months since last email sent to CNAF</em>, for example, can take on three values. If it has been less than two months since the beneficiary has sent an email to the CNAF in the last 18 months, their risk score moves down. If the last email they sent was between 3 and 4 months ago, their score moves up. The minute it has been 5 months, instead of 4 months, since they last sent an email their score again decreases.</p>

<p>We found that the seemingly arbitrary cut-offs used by CNAF’s risk-scoring model could push beneficiaries who would otherwise not be flagged over the high-risk threshold.</p>
<p>A beneficiary with a risk score of 0.52 will not be flagged investigation. But if it has been between 3 and 4 months since they last sent an email to the CNAF, they will suddenly be at risk of being flagged.</p>


</section>
<section id="section-8">
<h2>Limitations </h2>
<p>Obtaining access to runnable code / risk-scoring models is difficult. The materials we acquired enable us to test the model and gain far-reaching insight into how it would score different types of people. Nonetheless, we were not able to access key materials that would have allowed us to carry out deeper analysis.</p>
<p>An important limitation of our approach is that we do not know the relationship between the different variables that we analysed. For example, having a child between 12 and 18 (which increases risk scores) is likely correlated to being above 34 (which decreases risk scores). In practice, this means that certain types of people may receive lower or higher scores than the profiles we constructed suggest.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the limited data we could find on which demographic groups are investigated in general by the CNAF align with our results concerning which groups are more likely to be flagged. An analysis of investigations in 2015 published by the CNAF showed that single parent families were subject to more than double the number of investigations compared to their share in the beneficiary population. The CNAF did not respond to our request for more current statistics.</p>

<p>Another limitation is that we were not able to obtain granular outcome data (ie. whether someone who was flagged by the model had to repay money to the CNAF). In an ideal world, we would have had outcome data broken down by protected categories both inside and outside of the input variables. This would enable us to test whether the model flags women or people of an ethnic background at disproportionate rates. In addition, this would enable us to test whether the different demographic groups flagged by the model actually make more mistakes and compare false positive rates between groups.</p>
</section>
<section id="section-9">
<h2>The CNAF’s Response</h2>
<p>The CNAF did not respond to a detailed list of questions from Lighthouse Reports and <em>Le Monde</em> requesting, among other things, clarification on specific variables and more comprehensive statistics on the beneficiary population. Instead, the CNAF responded with a general statement and agreed to an on-the-record interview.</p>
<p>In its statement, the CNAF claimed that the goal of its risk-scoring model is not to “establish a risk score, but rather to classify files according to their degree of complexity.” It also pointed out that some investigations started by the model conclude that the CNAF actually owes the beneficiary money.</p>
<p>The agency defended the variables it uses in its model, arguing that they are statistically substantiated and are used “without discriminatory intent.” It did not provide evidence to back up its claim that the variables are statistically substantiated. In an interview with <em>Le Monde</em>, CNAF director Nicolas Grivel confirmed that the agency has never audited any of its models for bias or discrimination.</p>
<p>The CNAF wrote that it had been reflecting on its use of algorithms and the “heightened expectations when it comes to the transparent use of data.” It continued that it had convened a multi-disciplinary team of sociologists, data scientists and public policy specialists to examine its use of risk-scoring. The CNAF ended by stating that conclusions of the team are expected in 2024 and will be published as a “contribution to public debate on these important issues.”</p>

		<h3>The Omnichord will be re-produced to commemorate the 70th anniversary of our company.</h3>
		<div id="title2">　<p> In the 1980s, the electronic musical instrument 'Omnichord' gained tremendous popularity among gadget-loving music lovers for its quirky look and tone. We have been receiving requests to resurrect the Omnichord for a long time. And this year, 2023, to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the founding of Suzuki Musical Instruments Manufacturing, we will reproduce the Omnichord! It is scheduled to be released around the fall of 2023. We will update the information on this page from time to time. *The photo is the old model OM-27.</p><p> <span><a href="#title"><strong>LATEST NEWS 2023.10.17▼</strong></a></span><br> <img src="https://csj-concierge.com/suzukimusic/uploads/seo/OM-27-1024x7041.jpg"><br>*A photo above is older model, OM-27.</p></div>		</div>
				<div>
		<h3>What is Omnichord</h3><p>
		It was developed as an electronic musical instrument with an automatic accompaniment function (auto bass chord) equipped with a harp sensor. Anyone can easily play chords, including those who are new to musical instruments and those who are less adept with traditional &nbsp;instruments. It is played using multiple chord buttons lined up in the centre and a touch sensitive strum plate on the right. Whilst pressing the chord buttons, tap the plate with your finger or slide up and down to play 4 octave sounds to effectively accompany a song. Not only is it easy to play, but its unique appearance and tone makes it a hidden favorite both in Japan and overseas for artists who want to try something different and for non-musicians who want to play music!		</p></div>
				<div>
		<h3>History of the Omnichord</h3><p>
		Originally development started with a request from an overseas sales company to make an electronic musical instrument like an auto-harp. It started with the electronic musical instrument 'PC-27' and the first Omnichord 'OM-27' was born with improvements to the interface and functions. Since then, as technology has advanced, we have created numerous models through trial and error in adding more chords, timbres, and designs.		</p></div>

		<h3>About the form and size</h3>
		<p><span>NEWS 2023.4.25</span> <img src="https://csj-concierge.com/suzukimusic/uploads/seo/the_new_modelEN.jpg"><br><strong>The form and size have been decided!</strong></p><p>&nbsp;The shape of the new Omnichord is based on the still very popular previous models of the OM-27, OM-36 and OM-84, with the curved shape on the left side of the body. In addition, the overall dimensions are one size smaller than the OM-27, making it a compact size that is easier to carry around. Regarding the OM-27, OM-36 and OM-84, which became the basis for the shape of the new Omnichord, we will introduce a little more information&nbsp; along with the history of Omnichord.</p><p><strong>[New model] Size: 460×250 mm</strong><br><strong>[OM-27] Size: 520 x 280 mm</strong></p><p><strong>OM-27 released in 1981</strong><br>In these days the Omnichord is an electronic musical instrument used by a wide variety of different users, including artists and electronic musical instrument enthusiasts, both in Japan and overseas, but when they first went on sale in Japan, there was the concept of "Let's ignore the fixed and difficult music theory and think more casually”. We aimed to create an electronic musical instrument, using our experience as an educational musical instrument manufacturer that could be used at home, at school, on trains, planes and ideal for adults and children alike. Although it is no longer available for sale, instructional textbooks were also made for those who play Omnichord for the first time.</p><p><img src="https://csj-concierge.com/suzukimusic/uploads/seo/OM-text.jpg"></p><p><strong>About the form</strong><br>The Omnichord is characterized by its streamlined body. According to 'Omnichord Communication Paper No. 1' published in Japan in 1982, this shape seems to express the thinking of a more futuristic musical instrument, with the shape as a motif, symbolizing the form of an overflowing happy tear. The body colour of the OM-27 was brown, red, and ivory. *The image is the colour lineup of the OM-27.</p><p>[OM-27 specifications] Size: 520 x 280 mm Weight: 1.7 kg Body color: Brown, Red, Ivory <br>[OM-36/84 specifications] Size: 520 x 280 mm Weight: 1.4 kg Body color: OM-36 (beige),</p><p>OM-84 (grey, ivory)<br><img src="https://csj-concierge.com/suzukimusic/uploads/seo/OM-27-color.jpg"></p><p><strong>About specifications</strong><br>The Omnichord is the world's first electronic musical instrument with auto-accompaniment, equipped with an auto-harp sensor. Various functions were added to the successor models as technology progressed, but the style of playing by touching the chord buttons and metal strum plates lined up in the centre and being lightweight and easy to carry anywhere was already established from around this time. With the idea that "There's no dream of a fully automatic electronic instrument! Let's just sing the melody!" As a keyword, the OM-27 had a total of 27 chords of Eb, Bb, F, C, G, D, A, E, B Major, Minor, Seventh and the tone is one harp pattern. With the OM-36/84, major seventh and augment had been added, expanding the total to 84 chords. In addition, the OM-84 had two patterns of harp sounds, and a memory function that had enabled the player to record chords. This function was groundbreaking at the time, allowing you to play more freely. *The image is OM-84.</p><p>※1 From “Omnichord Communication Paper No.1” published in 1982.<br><img src="https://csj-concierge.com/suzukimusic/uploads/seo/OM-84small.jpg"></p></div>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p><a href="https://www.lanternbioworks.com/" rel="">Lantern Bioworks</a><span> says they have </span><a href="https://www.luminaprobiotic.com/" rel="">a cure for tooth decay</a><span>. Their product is a genetically modified bacterium which infects your mouth, outcompetes all the tooth-decay-causing bacteria, and doesn’t cause tooth decay itself. If it works, it could make cavities a thing of the past (you should still brush for backup and cosmetic reasons).</span></p><p>I talked to Lantern founder Aaron Silverbook to get an idea of how this works, both in a biological and an economic sense. Aaron was very knowledgeable and forthcoming, although he uses the phrase “YOLO” somewhat more often than most biotech founders. This post isn’t a verbatim interview transcript, just a writeup of what I learned based on his answers. </p><p><em>[Conflict of interest notice: Lantern is mostly rationalists and includes some friends. My wife consulted for them early on. They offered my wife and me free samples (based on her work, not as compensation for writing this post); she accepted, and I’m still debating. Consider this an attempt to spotlight interesting work that people I like are doing, not a hard-hitting investigation.]</em></p><p><strong>1: What is BCS3-L1?</strong></p><p><span>BCS3-L1 (brand name “Lumina”) is a genetically-modified strain of the tooth decay bacterium </span><em>streptococcus mutans.</em></p><p><em>S. mutans</em><span> lives on your teeth and metabolizes any spare sugar that comes its way into the waste product lactic acid. If too much </span><em>s. mutans</em><span> gets together in one place, all the lactic acid dissolves the tooth’s enamel coating, causing cavities.</span></p><p>BCS3-LI has four main genetic modifications:</p><ol><li><p>It produces a weak antibiotic, mutacin-1140, which kills competing oral bacteria.</p></li><li><p>It’s immune to mutacin-1140, so it doesn’t kill itself.</p></li><li><p>It metabolizes sugar through a different chemical pathway that ends in alcohol instead of lactic acid.</p></li><li><p>It lacks a peptide that its species usually uses to arrange gene transfers with other bacteria.</p></li></ol><p>The antibiotic helps it win the Darwinian competition in your mouth to become King Of The Oral Bacteria. The alcohol metabolism means it won’t produce lactic acid (and so won’t cause tooth decay). The peptide knockout prevents it from transferring genes back and forth with other bacteria that might either inactivate it or leak its advantage.</p><p><strong>1.1: Where did this come from? Who invented it?</strong></p><p><span>Professor Jeffrey Hillman of the University of Florida. In 1985, he was surveying the microorganisms on his graduate students’ teeth (as you do). One grad student had an unusual strain of </span><em>S. mutans</em><span> with a natural version of mutations 1 and 2 (it produced mutacin-1140, and was resistant to it). Hillman realized the potential, and spent the next few decades adding mutations 3 and 4 and testing the results. </span></p><p><strong>1.2: So how did it end up with a tiny startup in 2023?</strong></p><p><span>Professor Hillman started a company “Oragenics” and applied for FDA approval. The FDA demanded a study of 100 subjects, all of whom had to be “age 18-30, with removable dentures, living alone and far from school zones”. Hillman wasn’t sure there even </span><em>were </em><span>100 young people with dentures, but the FDA wouldn’t budge from requiring this impossible trial. Hillman gave up and switched to other projects (including </span><a href="https://www.oragenics.com/" rel="">an intranasal COVID vaccine</a><span>!)</span></p><p><span>Aaron heard this story and figured that brash, move-fast-and-break-things Silicon Valley biotech might be able to find an alternative route to commercialization. The strain was off-patent, so he first tried to synthesize it himself from the clues in Hillman’s published papers. When that didn’t work, he </span><a href="https://www.oragenics.com/news-media/press-releases/detail/163/oragenics-enters-into-agreement-with-lantern-bioworks-for" rel="">made a deal</a><span> with Oragenics for 10% of profits in exchange for samples and the full </span><a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/18ZDSe92LgLmS0sUbosvNxByii_1kjnEj" rel="">recipe</a><span>.</span></p><p><strong>2: How do you use it?</strong></p><p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m2SEWL_rrlQLEi1OiD9K5XbO_7RQ8iMX/edit" rel="">To apply</a><span>, you brush your teeth with a special pumice-based product that removes your existing tooth bacteria, then swab it on with a q-tip.</span></p><p>One dose is sufficient; once you use it, it’s in your mouth approximately forever.</p><p><strong>2.1: As users kiss their loved ones, who kiss others in turn, will this spread exponentially and take over the world?</strong></p><p>There was originally some concern about this, but no. </p><p>Remember, the original bacterium was found in the wild, in a random grad student’s mouth forty years ago. There must be thousands of people walking around with various naturally-occurring BCS3-L1-like things. So probably this isn’t a risk for some kind of weird pandemic.</p><p>Existing mouth bacteria have fortified their position and have a strong home field advantage. This is why you need to brush your teeth with the special product to apply Lumina.</p><p><span>Lantern’s safety documents note that couples who kiss constantly do end up with similar oral microbiomes. So maybe </span><em>enough </em><span>kissing - especially kissing just after a dental cleaning when your existing bacteria are at their weakest - could spread the strain accidentally, very slowly. This rate of spread would be comparable to the rate of spread of every other mouth bacterium.</span></p><p><strong>2.2: When a user kisses their newborn baby, will it spread to the baby?</strong></p><p>Okay, this one is true. </p><p>Babies have no existing mouth bacteria, and get theirs from their parents’ kisses. Not necessarily their first kiss as a newborn (newborns have no teeth, and BCS3-L1 needs teeth to live), but their first kiss after teeth grow in. If you get this, you’re probably getting it for your whole future family line.</p><p><strong>2.3: If you wanted to get rid of it, could you?</strong></p><p>Some kind of extreme course of oral antibiotics that nukes everything growing in your mouth would probably eradicate BCS3-L1, but this hasn’t been tested and would have side effects.</p><p><strong>3: Is it dangerous to have bacteria secreting an antibiotic in your mouth? Does this mean you’re on a weak antibiotic all the time?</strong></p><p>There are already bacteria secreting antibiotics in your mouth. Microbes are in constant war with other microbes, and antibiotics are one of their favorite weapons - remember, penicillin comes from a fungus.</p><p>Because bacteria secrete just enough antibiotic to clear their local area, these are tiny quantities, much less than you’d get from taking a medical-grade antibiotic pill. Lantern says the levels of mutacin-1140 dilute to irrelevance “tens of microns” away from the secreting bacteria. In any case, it’s a weak antibiotic that doesn’t survive the digestive tract (Hillman originally hoped to market the antibiotic too, but found it didn’t get absorbed and broke down too quickly). </p><p>Neither the grad student with the original strain nor any of Hillman’s test subjects had any noticeable health issues.</p><p><span>See also Lantern’s </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mDJCTO2QySmQOZQcajYReDCA1MFpKs-EZ5E0VNu50Fo/edit" rel="">Safety Review FAQ</a><span>.</span></p><p><strong>3.1: Is it bad to disrupt your normal mouth microbiome?</strong></p><p><span>When talking about BCS3-L1 “taking over” the mouth, this just means it takes over the </span><em>streptococcus mutans</em><span> niche. There are still other bacteria and fungi in the mouth. </span></p><p>The mutacin antibiotic might still disrupt these other bacteria (probably not fungi). But strains like BCS3-L1 already exist in the wild (eg the original grad student), and lots of bacteria and fungi secrete antibiotics, so it doesn’t seem like having mutacin-secreting organisms in your mouth makes you some extreme oral microbiome outlier. </p><p>If you eat a normal Western diet, your mouth microbiome is already pretty far from the design specs, and it’s unclear if using Lumina makes things worse.</p><p><strong>3.2: Will the other bacteria develop resistance to the antibiotic?</strong></p><p>Mutation 4 prevents BCS3-L1 from “leaking” its own resistance. Although in theory other bacteria could develop resistance, mutacin-1140 is a hard antibiotic to develop resistance to, and the other bacteria would have to do it in the short period before BCS3-L1 kills them off and establishes its own home field advantage. In practice, Professor Hillman found that BCS3-L1 remained dominant over many years and nothing developed resistance to it.</p><p>Even if a mutacin-resistant strain does develop in one person’s mouth, it will have a hard time getting to anyone else’s mouth, so widespread immunity is unlikely.</p><p><strong>4: Is it dangerous to have bacteria secreting alcohol in your mouth? Will you get drunk?</strong></p><p>Most people already have some alcohol-secreting bacteria in their bodies. </p><p><span>(there’s a condition called </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auto-brewery_syndrome" rel="">auto-brewery syndrome</a><span> where those bacteria get out of control and produce enough alcohol to make someone drunk. It’s vanishingly rare in real life, but more common </span><a href="https://www.tampaflduilawyer.com/defenses/involuntary-intoxication/auto-brewery-syndrome/" rel="">in the legal system</a><span>: “You gotta believe me, Officer, it was just auto-brewery syndrome!”)</span></p><p><span>The average person has enough of these bacteria in their gut to have a natural blood alcohol level - even after zero drinks - of about 0.1 mg/dl. Under</span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mDJCTO2QySmQOZQcajYReDCA1MFpKs-EZ5E0VNu50Fo/edit" rel=""> pessimistic assumptions</a><span>, BCS3-L1 will add another 0.2 mg/dl, bringing the total to 0.3. This is still a pretty normal number that some people have naturally (it would bring the average customer from the ~50th to the ~80th percentile of natural blood alcohol). It’s also far from the usual threshold for feeling tipsy (30 mg/dl) or too drunk to drive (80 mg/dl). </span></p><p>Under more realistic assumptions, the amount of alcohol produced by BCS3-L1 probably isn’t significant even by the very low standards of natural blood alcohol concentrations.</p><p><strong>4.1: Are there some unusual scenarios where this amount of alcohol might matter?</strong></p><p>I don’t think Lantern has studied Breathalyzers. Since the alcohol is directly in your mouth, it might have disproportionate effect on a Breathalyzer compared to alcohol in your blood. I think it’s probably still too low to matter, but this is a wild guess.</p><p><span>There is conjecture that “non-alcoholic steatohepatitis”, a liver disease in which non-alcoholics get the same kind of liver damage that alcoholics usually get, might be associated with endogenous blood alcohol in the high normal range. If I’m understanding </span><a href="https://sci-hub.st/https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25956735/" rel="">this paper</a><span> right, it’s probably because the gut produces levels of alcohol consistent with auto-brewery syndrome, the liver goes into overdrive and metabolizes it away (prevents auto-brewery syndrome from developing), but the liver is damaged in the process the same as if it had to go into overdrive to metabolize normal binge drinking. Since BCS3-L1 produces much less alcohol than auto-brewery, I think it wouldn’t cause non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, even though it might produce final blood alcohol levels similar to those associated with the condition.</span></p><p><span>I was originally worried that Lumina might activate Antabuse, an anti-alcoholism drug that prevents drinking by causing a very unpleasant (sometimes dangerous) reaction to ethanol. There are some past cases of Antabuse being activated by really trivial quantities, like the alcohol in a chicken marsala dish or a mouth wash. But no, I think BCS3-L1 is less than this too. Chicken marsala </span><a href="https://www.southernearlychildhood.org/can-kids-eat-chicken-marsala/" rel="">can contain</a><span> several grams of alcohol per serving, but BCS3-L1 probably only produces a few milligrams per day. If you swallow 1/10 of your mouthwash, that’s about 200 mg of alcohol - again, BCS3-L1 is probably only a few milligrams a day. Antabuse usually activates around a BAC of 5 mg/dl; BCS3-L1 only gives you a BAC of about 0.3 mg/dl.</span></p><p>Again, this really is a tiny amount of alcohol.</p><p>There might be other edge cases like these. Lantern offers a $100 bounty to anyone who can come up with one they haven’t thought of yet (and sometimes extra if you’re willing to help them research them).</p><p><strong>4.2: Has anyone tested this in real life?</strong></p><p>As mentioned before, the mutacin-releasing strain (with mutations 1 and 2) exists in the wild and was extensively tested by Professor Hillman.</p><p>The full strain with all four mutations has undergone some testing by Dr. Hillman, but nobody had officially infected themselves with it until two months ago, when Aaron finally synthesized it and tried it on himself. He says he’s usually “a lightweight” as far as alcohol goes, and hasn’t felt any different over the past two months.</p><p>When first infected, BCS3-L1 makes up almost 100% of the microbiome (because you deliberately removed all your other bacteria, then infected yourself with it). Over time, other bacteria creep back in; over an even longer period (years?), BCS3-L1 reclaims lost territory and reaches a steady state. But the point is that Aaron probably has already passed his period of highest BCS3-L1 activity, and felt nothing.</p><figure data-component-name="Image3Dynamic"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9200a48f-2549-40ba-9b4a-73c3e19fe93a_569x393.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9200a48f-2549-40ba-9b4a-73c3e19fe93a_569x393.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9200a48f-2549-40ba-9b4a-73c3e19fe93a_569x393.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9200a48f-2549-40ba-9b4a-73c3e19fe93a_569x393.png 1456w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_2912,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9200a48f-2549-40ba-9b4a-73c3e19fe93a_569x393.png 2912w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_4368,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9200a48f-2549-40ba-9b4a-73c3e19fe93a_569x393.png 4368w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9200a48f-2549-40ba-9b4a-73c3e19fe93a_569x393.png" sizes="100vw" alt="Graph showing bacteria levels starting high, then going down, then going back up." srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9200a48f-2549-40ba-9b4a-73c3e19fe93a_569x393.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9200a48f-2549-40ba-9b4a-73c3e19fe93a_569x393.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9200a48f-2549-40ba-9b4a-73c3e19fe93a_569x393.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9200a48f-2549-40ba-9b4a-73c3e19fe93a_569x393.png 1456w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_2912,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9200a48f-2549-40ba-9b4a-73c3e19fe93a_569x393.png 2912w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_4368,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9200a48f-2549-40ba-9b4a-73c3e19fe93a_569x393.png 4368w" width="1456"></picture></div></figure><p>My wife infected herself about a month ago, and I haven’t noticed her having worse judgment or becoming more impulsive.

The FDA has already set unreachable standards for any drug approval study, so Aaron wants to try a different route.</p><p><span>The FDA has lower standards for probiotics than for drugs. And technically, a bacterium which you take in order to change your natural microbiome is a probiotic. The genetic modifications are no disqualification; a few genetically-modified probiotics have already been approved. Some are almost as creative as Lumina: </span><a href="https://zbiotics.com/" rel="">Zbiotics</a><span> is a genetically engineered </span><em>Bacillus</em><span> species which sits in your stomach and (supposedly; I have not investigated this claim) prevents hangovers by metabolizing alcohol byproducts for you.</span></p><p>Aaron thinks the FDA will most likely see things his way.

I’m not sure.</span></p><p><span>Do the six months of animal studies involve testing whether the animals get drunk or not? I can’t imagine there is any regulation that animal testers have to do this. But if not, how do they address the most plausible objection to the product? I trust Aaron and am glad he’s found a way to make this happen, but this is a surprising way for the system to work.</span></p></div><p>The FDA does have the option of reviewing their studies and asking additional questions, which might include questions about the drunkenness or other concerns.</p><p><strong>5.2: Can’t people transfer the bacterium among themselves without paying Lantern?</strong></p><p>Yes. The recipient would either have to wait until just after a high-powered teeth-cleaning session at the dentist’s, or research how to give themselves a dentist-quality teeth-cleaning. Then they would find someone who had already bought the bacterium, swab their teeth with a q-tip, and apply it to their own teeth.</p><p><span>(this would risk transferring other salivary pathogens; to avoid this, you could use the more involved process described </span><a href="https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/defying-cavity-lantern-bioworks-faq/comment/44992945" rel="">here</a><span>)</span></p><p>Aaron thinks of this as a mostly altruistic project, and although he wouldn’t mind getting rich, he doesn’t begrudge anyone who is desperate enough to read up on dentistry and swab their friends’ teeth.

<p>Google is dealing with its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/11/android-14-patches-ransomware-storage-bug-but-some-users-will-lose-data/">second "lost data" fiasco</a> in the past few months. This time, it's Google Drive, which has been <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/11/google-drive-is-investigating-sync-issues-as-users-complain-of-lost-files/">mysteriously losing files</a> for some people. Google acknowledged the issue on November 27, and a week later, it posted what it called a fix.</p>
<p>It doesn't feel like Google is describing this issue correctly; the company still calls it a "syncing issue" with the Drive desktop app versions 84.0.0.0 through 84.0.4.0. Syncing problems would only mean files don't make it to or from the cloud, and that doesn't explain why people are completely losing files. In the <a href="https://support.google.com/drive/thread/245055606/google-drive-files-suddenly-disappeared-the-drive-literally-went-back-to-condition-in-may-2023?hl=en&amp;sjid=9779374175483664470-NA">most popular</a> issue thread on the Google Drive Community forums, <a href="https://support.google.com/drive/thread/245055606?hl=en&amp;msgid=246232590">several</a> <a href="https://support.google.com/drive/thread/245055606?hl=en&amp;msgid=246259260">users</a> <a href="https://support.google.com/drive/thread/245055606?hl=en&amp;msgid=246980076">describe</a> <a href="https://support.google.com/drive/thread/245055606?hl=en&amp;msgid=246762363">spreadsheets</a> and documents going missing, which all would have been created and saved in the web interface, not the desktop app, and it's hard to see how the desktop app could affect that. Many users peg "May 2023" as the time documents stopped saving. <a href="https://support.google.com/drive/thread/245055606?hl=en&amp;msgid=246116775">Some say</a> they've never used the desktop app.</p>
<p>Drive has multiple ways of syncing files, which complicates any explanation or diagnosis of what's going on. The most suspect mode in the whole fiasco is the default "file streaming," mode which is actually cloud-first. Files get <em>removed</em> from your computer and stored in the cloud, saving space and leaving only a web link in their place. Perhaps a "syncing" issue could remove files from your computer before uploading (that still doesn't explain the claims of missing web documents, though).</p>
<p>Google still hasn't explained what exactly happened or how it's been fixed, but just reading through these instructions makes the issue sound rather complicated. This isn't just a simple case of fixing this "syncing" issue by shipping a new version and having everyone's files reappear.</p>
<p><a href="https://support.google.com/drive/answer/14286582">Google's recovery instructions</a> outline a few ways to attempt to "recover your files." One is via a new secret UI in the Google Drive desktop app version 85.0.13.0 or higher. If you hold shift while clicking on the Drive system tray/menu bar icon, you'll get a special debug UI with an option to "Recover from backups." Google says, "Once recovery is complete, you'll see a new folder on your desktop with the unsynced files named Google Drive Recovery." Google doesn't explain what this does or how it works.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>Option No. 2 is surprising: use of the command line to recover files. The new Drive binary comes with flags for '--recover_from_account_backups' and '--recover_from_app_data_path', which tells us a bit about what is going on. When Google first acknowledged the issue, it warned users not to delete or move Drive's app data folder. These flags from the recovery process make it sound like Google hopes your missing files will be in the Drive cache somewhere. Google also suggests trying Windows Backup or macOS Time Machine to find your files.</p>
<p>Google locked the issue thread on the Drive Community Forums at 170 replies before it was clear the problem was solved. It's also marking <a href="https://support.google.com/drive/answer/14286582?sjid=2808826510676647677-NC#recoverui">any additional threads</a> as "duplicates" and locking them. Taking away the space to diagnose the issue and communicate fixes adds to the sense that Google is more interested in PR damage control than helping users. It also doesn't allow people to reply to the "solution" post, so it's hard to evaluate the fix's efficacy since Google shut down the easiest avenues for user feedback and support.</p>
<p>Of the few replies before Google locked the thread, most suggested that Google's fix did not work. <a href="https://support.google.com/drive/thread/245055606?hl=en&amp;msgid=247228495">One user</a> calls the fix "complete BS," adding, "The “solution” doesn’t work for most people." <a href="https://support.google.com/drive/thread/245055606?hl=en&amp;msgid=247231608">Another says,</a> "Google Drive DELETED my files so they are not available for recovery. This "fix" is not a fix!" There are <a href="https://support.google.com/drive/thread/245055606?hl=en&amp;msgid=246651550">lots</a> <a href="https://support.google.com/drive/thread/245055606?hl=en&amp;msgid=246762363">of other</a> <a href="https://support.google.com/drive/thread/245055606?hl=en&amp;msgid=247203919">reports</a> of the fix not working, and not many that say they got their files back. The idea that Drive would have months-old copies of files in the app data folder is hard to believe.</p>
<p>Drive isn't just a consumer product, it's also aimed a businesses looking for terabytes of file storage, with paid tiers that can be priced into the stratosphere. Drive is a product that will live and die by how much users trust it. Bugs will happen, but I would have expected Google's response to align with normal IT downtime procedures: a status page with constant updates and a full postmortem explaining what went wrong and how Google fixed it. Instead, we got days of silence, locked forum posts, and vague explanations.</p>

Here are the regions I use:</p><figure></figure><p id="6a38">Then I had to classify each region according to its population-relevant traits: climate, geography, water access, etc. Then I assigned population densities to each region based on its terrain mixes, with densities drawn from modern scholarly estimates of Medieval population densities. So for example, Belgium and the Netherlands had very high population densities over 100 people per square mile, whereas Mongolia or Scotland had very low, under 4 and sometimes under 1 person per square mile. So, for example, “Minhiriath” (yellowish central west coast) is coded as having about 2/3 of its land potentially arable land, 0% mountains, 14% forest, 5% swamp, 0% steppe, 10% coastal, 5% riparian, and 0% tundra. “Iron Hills” (upper right reddish) on the other hand is 12% arable, 68% mountain, 12% steppe, and 8% riparian. And so on, for every region, making my best guesses.</p><p id="fa6a">Now, an aside, here’s a map of Europe’s borders superimposed on Middle Earth:</p></div><div><p id="c68c">The takeaway here is that <em>my regions are smaller than most European countries</em>. Take a relatively well-defined region like “Minhiriath,” center left. It’s a pretty big chunk of land on Tolkien’s map. And yet, it’s basically the size of Belgium and the Netherlands together, or a small share of England’s Medieval holdings in France. All of Rohan is perhaps the size of Hungary. Gondor is smaller than France, and I split Gondor into several regions. Middle Earth’s polities are pretty modestly sized!</p><p id="a482">We can use the sizes and terrains described above to yield implied population densities. Again, these are <em>not </em>the densities that <em>actually </em>prevail in Middle Earth; they are the densities that <em>would </em>prevail <em>if Middle Earth behaved like Medieval Europe</em>.</p><p id="55cd">Here’s a simpler map of regions with labels:</p><figure></figure><p id="28a5">So, what population densities do we get under these assumptions?</p><p id="8ad7">Here’s a graph:</p></div><div><p id="6fea">The most densely settled part of Middle Earth in this model is Lossarnach around Pelargir, at about 71 per square mile. That’s higher than most actual Medieval countries — but again, Lossarnach is a <em>lot smaller </em>than most countries, so the existence of a small high-density region is plausible. Belfalas, Anorien, Central Gondor, and Ithilien are all rather high. So is Erebor and its environs, as well as Eregion. The surprise contenders here are the Anduin Vale, the Enedwaith, and the western reaches of Eriador towards Lindon. That the Shire is fairly dense is no surprise, nor is Arthedain or Nurn. But Minhiriath also seems fairly dense. In this model, Rhun is slightly more densely settled than Rohan!</p><p id="bb54">Here it is as a map of population densities:</p></div><div><p id="8918">So how many people could live in Middle Earth?</p><p id="d0d6"><strong>It’s reasonable to assume that <em>if Middle Earth were populated in a similar pattern with regards to subsistence resources as Medieval Europe</em>, that Middle Earth could have approximately 26 million people. This is a sharp contrast to prior fan estimates of about 3 million people in northwestern Middle Earth!</strong></p><p id="9926">You can see there’s a pretty significant population center around eastern Gondor in the south, the Anduin Vale, Eregion, and western Arnor. This all fits LOTR lore: Eregion had a large population of humans, Elves, and dwarves at various times, Arnor was once heavily settled, Gondor has always been a major population hub… the only real issue is the Anduin Value. On that I think maybe we just have to assume Tolkien under-described an actually-once-thriving society, or they just faced too-constant of orc rais or something. Meanwhile, the east is clearly less densely settled, giving rise to the more steppe-like culture of Rhun, Khand, the Wainriders, the Balcoth, etc.</p><p id="0a50">But then we have to ask: what do you mean by <em>people? </em>Middle Earth has elves, dwarves, men, hobbits, orcs… who counts for population purposes?</p><p id="c466">My operating assumption here is basically that though hobbits are small, their voracious appetites mean they need similar land-per-Hobbit as humans need. Plus, though they may have high caloric needs, they also live underground, so can use a larger percentage of available land. Likewise, though Elves are immortal and thus can subsist on I suppose little or nothing so could theoretically reach extremely high densities, in practice Elves also have slow reproduction, are leaving for Valinor, and appear to have a preference for uncrowded living, so again, similar density as we would guess from humans seems reasonable.</p><p id="01a3">Dwarves are the only real problem. What do dwarves eat? Can a dwarven city subsist on its own? I’m not sure. In theory dwarves muck about with this kind of calculation because they can turn low-population mountain regions into population centers. But since dwarf populations are quite localized in just Erebor and the Blue Mountains in TA 3019 (the period of the Lord of the Rings), I’m not too worried about this.</p><p id="0929">Orcs… well, we’ll come back to orcs.</p></div></div><div><h2 id="0111">Army Sizes</h2><p id="1972">How big are the armies of Middle Earth? This should help guide us towards how many people <em>actually do</em> live in Middle Earth.</p><p id="4e90">Again, Tolkien is frustratingly vague. But in TA 3019, we can make some guesswork. Minas Tirith, Osgiliath, Rammas Echor, and Cair Andros together are defended by, we are led to believe, fewer than 5,000 full-time professional soldiers and guardsmen. At the muster of Gondor’s fiefs, fewer than 5,000 additional soldiers show up. However, this muster is not a complete muster: we know for example the fiefs of Lebennin, Dol Amroth, and Lossarnach did not send their full musters because they were fending off the corsairs of Umbar. Likewise the fiefdoms in central Gondor, as Aragorn is able to gather men as he goes alongside his undead armies.</p><p id="410f">On the whole, my guess is Gondor’s total muster is around 25–40,000 men. That includes local guardsmen, militia, professional soldiers, household guards, naval marines (Gondor had a navy!), etc. Of those, fewer than 15,000 are actually deployable in an expeditionary force, and that’s before the Siege of Gondor really takes off, dinting their numbers.</p><p id="e812">Rohan we know fielded 18,000 riders a century or two before TA 3019, plus additional infantry raised as militia. Theoden rides to aid Minas Tirith with just 6,000, but that’s because he’s in a hurry not because he only has 6,000. It’s reasonable to suppose Rohan can field maybe 25,000 men at total fighting strength, but nowhere near that much <em>on campaign</em>. As I’ll note below, the true figures for Rohan may be a bit lower.</p><p id="a7bd">At the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, there are at least 3 times as may Haradrim riders as riders of Rohan, so 18–20,000, presumably plus additional infantry. Saruman’s army has perhaps 10–15,000 orcs, plus some thousands of Dunlanders.</p><p id="8c8e">Stepping back to TA 2941 at the Battle of Five Armies, we know that Thranduil goes into the field with about 2,000 Elven warriors, and the Iron Hills dwarves show up with under 700 Dwarves. There are a few hundred men of Lake Town in the mix as well. These armies are said to be outnumbered several times by the goblins, suggesting at least 9,000 goblins, perhaps as many as 15,000. Of course, it’s plausible that neither the Dwarves, Elves, or Lake Towners were deploying their whole strength, as none of them anticipated fighting a major set piece battle against an evil army.</p><p id="fdd2">What can we conclude about population from these figures?</p><p id="21d8">Wigmore arrives at somewhat similar guesses about army size as I do. Take Rohan: he suggests 15,000 riders and 20,000 infantry. This is a lot more than I suggest, but the difference is mostly on the infantry side where we both admit there’s a lot of squish. Then he does some multiplication. He assumes that Riders are somewhat equivalent to knights and that the infantry are equivalent to Anglo-Saxon freemen, so this isn’t a census of the male population. He suggests perhaps there are 7 more men per rider, and 3 more men per infantrymen. So, formally, the prime-age male population is:</p><p id="8523">(Riders X 8 ) + (Infantry X 4) = Prime Age Males</p><p id="34b4">That yields 200,000 men. Then he assumes prime-age men are 1/3 of the population (+1/3 prime age women, +1/3 children), yielding 600,000 people in total. In total, that’s a ratio of 16 civilians per soldier.</p><p id="f4dc">How plausible is this?</p><p id="574c">One way to check it would be to look at major battles and wars of the Middle Ages, check army sizes, then compare to populations, to see what typical conversion ratios are. I didn’t do a full census, but just checked a few famous battles:</p><figure></figure><p id="9056">There is nowhere with a ratio as low as 17, and the only close cases are Vikings and Georgia defending itself on its home turf. On average, battlefield armies clock in at about 1 soldier per 60–120 civilians in the supporting population. So if we assume that Rohan as a deployable army of 10,000–20,000 men, and that there will be 60–120 civilians per soldier, that yields a Rohan population of… 600,000 to 2.4 million. For comparison, my geographically based estimate was 819,000. Here’s how these look in a graph:</p><figure></figure><p id="a3bd">So Wigmore’s estimates are at the very low end, and are consistent with Rohan only actually being able to field 10,000 men at the most, and with relatively intense mobilization at that. The geographic data supports the idea of a field army of between 6,800 and 13,000, which to be honest seems about right!</p><p id="08f7">What if we turn to Gondor? Wigmore puts Gondor’s population at perhaps 1 million. The geographic approach puts it at 4 million (excluding Ithilian which I’m assuming is depopulated). And what do we get if we assume an army of between 15,000 and 35,000 with 60–120 civilians per soldier? About 900,000–4.2 million.</p><figure></figure><p id="4f03">Again, Wigmore’s figure is <em>just </em>in the realm of plausibility. The geographic data here implies something on the high end of historic army ratios.</p><p id="49eb">Next we can turn to Thranduil’s realm. We know Thranduil fields at least 2,000 elves in his army; Wigmore suggests 3,000 is a plausible number. He supposes that 1/4 Elven adult males is a warrior, and there are 1.5 times as many women and children as there are adult males (fewer kids due to lower Elven reproduction rate vs. lifespan). That yields 30,000 elves in Mirkwood. But, much of Mirkwood is depopulated! Using Fonstad’s map of Thranduil’s realm, we can guess that Thranduil’s people occupied about 1/6 of northern Mirkwood, so their implied geographic estimate is about 52,000.</p><p id="fbd2">Turning to army sizes, the matter does become complicated. Elderly elves can still fight. The child share of Elven population is extremely small. To be frank, I think we should treat Elves like Vikings or Georgians: they mobilize at a rate of 20–40 civilians per warrior rather than 60–120. Here’s what we get:</p><figure></figure><p id="5d22">Wigmore here seems much too low; even the geographic estimate is too low compared to army ratios. On the other hand, the elves who remain in Middle Earth may be <em>uniquely martial</em>. So, what ratio would we need to have to produce Wigmore’s estimate or the geographic estimate? Well, the ratio of Soldiers to Geographic Estimate is 17, while the ratio of Soldiers to Wigmore Estimate is 10. Were 1/10th of Elves combatants in Thranduil’s realm? Maybe so!</p><p id="1d6f">But if you’re following along here, you can see there may be an argument for an appreciably higher population. In all three areas where we have estimates, Wigmore’s figures seem to be at the very low end. Meanwhile, in the one area we have considerable population, the Shire, Wigmore countenances populations of perhaps 150,000 Hobbits: in TA 1975 the perhaps 20,000 Hobbits of the Shire contribute likely under 200 archers to the host of Earnur against the Witch King, even though the evil is literally at their gates: that’s a ratio of 100:1! But in the Battle of Baywater, there are under 500 Hobbits, perhaps under 400, of perhaps 150,000 Hobbits: a ratio of 300:1 literally in their own backyard!</p><p id="c059">Is it a coincidence that Shire populations are so inflated relative to Hobbit military capabilities? No, for two reasons: first, Hobbits are peacable folk. But more importantly: we <em>actually have detailed descriptions of civilian life in the Shire</em>. One imagines that if Tolkien gave us stories of farmers in Minhiriath, we’d all suppose Minhiriath to be densely populated! In Wigmore’s telling, Hobbits make up perhaps 5% of the total population of northwestern Middle Earth (1 in 20!). In my geographic estimates, they make up just 1.4% (1 in 71). Given that Sauron has apparently <em>not heard of the Shire</em>, Hobbits making up 1–2% of Middle Earth’s population makes quite a lot more sense than 5%.</p></div><div><div><h2 id="2c4b">Toward a Resolution</h2><p id="4186">One key factor my geographic approach does not account for is history. As noted, it suggested 313,000 people in North Mirkwood. That’s because the model had no method for identifying the effect of hordes of demon spiders. Likewise, the model estimates some residents of Dagorlad, Fangorn, the Dead Marshes, and other obviously depopulated areas. More generally, it doesn’t account for the real problem of general structural pressures for depopulation: marauding orcs, plagues, bandits and highwaymen making life miserable in the absence of a functional state, etc.</p><p id="6d5d">So I add one more variable: a depopulation variable. Basically, I take my geographic estimate and then weight it downwards by some depopulation factor. Here are the factors I use:</p></div><div><p id="0885">It’s a bit arbitrary, I know. But in general I have applied depopulation rates which try to push populations closer to army- or Wigmore-estimated numbers, to figure out some kind of consensus figure that incorporates all the available information. In other cases, like for Minhiriath for example, I use depopulation rates based on limited descriptions of the landscape in Tolkien’s work.</p><p id="8473">So, here’s what population densities <em>now </em>look like:</p></div><div><p id="3bda">This yields a total population of northwest Middle Earth of about 7.6 million humans, elves, dwarves, and hobbits. As you can see, much of Middle Earth is extremely sparsely settled. The major population centers become Gondor, Rohan, the Shire, Lothlorien, and Eregor/Dale.</p><p id="6d0b"><em>Updated info from Update 1 here:</em></p><p id="1d54">I initially said there was also a significant population in Minhiriath. I have revised that. When Boromir crosses through Enedwaith, it is utterly depopulated. Tolkien describes it as populated only be wild-men in the western woods of Eryn Vorn. The region once was home to a vast metropolitan shipyard and Vinyalonde/Lond Daer, but that is long since abandoned by TA 3019. The relevant error on my part was categorization: I treated Minhiriath as arable land. But Tolkien is clear Minhiriath is actually <em>forestland</em> that has been logged beyond all recognition for millennia, and then scorched and burnt repeatedly by Sauron. While it once had a bustling population with known urban hubs at Tharbad and Lond Daer, by TA 3019 there has been an epic collapse in Minhiriath’s population. A good analog for this is the collapse of Maya population in the late classic period, when, even before the arrival of Europeans, Maya overpopulation caused a resource crisis which led to a population collapse, which led to the collapse of urban centers, which led to the jungle taking over former farmlands, which led to there never being a population recovery for the Maya. Minhiriath’s case isn’t identical, but it has obvious resonances, so I have pushed its population way down, as also to a lesser extent in Enedwaith.</p><p id="233b"><em>End update</em></p><p id="e923">By the way, for fun, we can instead use Wigmore’s estimates, and then extrapolate from the <em>relative densities</em> he estimates vs. my estimates above to impute similar relative densities for areas Wigmore doesn’t describe, to guesstimate what densities would need to be to give ~3 million residents of Middle Earth. Here it is:</p><figure></figure><p id="d6bc">Now <em>that </em>is a map of some wide-open-spaces! That definitely captures the LOTR movies vibe of totally empty countrysides!</p><p id="b9cc">But I think it’s wrong. Is Rohan really the most densely settled part of Middle Earth? Its biggest urban center, Edoras, as I’ll describe below, is peanuts compared to Minas Tirith (or, likely even moreso, Pelargir). Its landscape is described as far less village-covered than the Shire. I think this map assumes far too much that <em>because a region doesn’t appear in the main story, it is therefore depopulated</em>. Wigmore’s implied population map is basically just a map of population centers observed by the books — it would be foolish to assume that’s actually the entire population of Middle Earth!</p><p id="4971"><strong>The best estimate of human, Elven, Dwarven, and Hobbit populations in Middle Earth is about 7.6 million. </strong><a rel="noopener" href="https://medium.com/@lymanstone/how-many-hobbits-middle-earth-population-by-people-group-60c5c9d0c5b1"><strong>In the next post, I’ll break this down for the four populations.</strong></a></p></div></div><div><h2 id="bdf3">Notes on Minas Tirith, Bree, Edoras, and Lake Town</h2><p id="2465">We only have detailed descriptions of three cities in Middle Earth: Minas Tirith, Lake Town, Edoras, and Bree. I want to take a moment to estimate their population. To do this, I will use their exact dimensions as described in Karen Wynn Fonstad’s fabulous <em>Atlas of Middle Earth</em>, and multiply that by plausible estimates of urban density.</p><p id="9b08">But what is a plausible estimate of urban density?</p><p id="4d79">For that, I use several well-studied medieval population centers: London, Paris, Constantinople, Antioch, etc. Here are some general figures for built up area and population:</p><figure></figure><p id="65ae">So you can see, there’s a LOT of fluctuation, but we are talking pretty routinely about tens of thousands of people per square mile.</p><p id="36b4"><strong>Lake Town</strong></p><p id="4a05">Here’s Fonstad’s map:</p><figure></figure><p id="002a">That yields a total area of Lake Town of about 81,000 square feet. If we assume Bruges-like density since that’s a similar kind of settlement, that gives us…. just 250 people in Lake Town, which we know is wrong, since Lake Town sends at least a few hundred <em>fighting age males</em> to the Battle of Five Armies, and that’s after a dragon attack killing many and with many left behind to rebuild.</p><p id="abe5">If we instead assume that 200 fighters make up Lake Towns “army,” our army ratios give us 12000 to 24000 people in Lake Town, which is <em>way too high. </em>If instead we assume Lake Town sent <em>almost a full census</em> of its fighting-age males to the Battle of Five Armies as a show of force, that gives us about 1500 people in Lake Town, for a density of 413,000 people per square mile.</p><p id="fcd7">On the whole, these numbers don’t work out. Lake Town doesn’t work out rationally, unless you assume there are considerable shoreside settlements (and maybe there are some!). But I think 1500 people in Lake Town and an appreciably bigger overall settlement are reasonable guesses. Wigmore puts it something like 500–700, but that makes hash of the one reported army size.</p><h2 id="9b18">Bree and Breeland</h2><p id="2195">When the Hobbits arrive in Bree, how many people are there in that town?</p><p id="db48">Well, here’s Fonstad’s representation of Bree and Breeland (which includes the towns of Archet, Comb, and Staddle):</p><figure></figure><p id="8567">Tolkien says there are at least 100 “stone houses of the big folk.” At a reasonable family size per house of 6, that gives you 600 humans in stone houses. Assuming a similar Hobbit population, that gives you 1200 people. But then you have to consider there may have been additional houses which weren’t stone! It’s unclear if Tolkien meant to say only 100 houses <em>in total</em>. If we take Fonstad’s map as gospel, the built-up area of Bree (about 1/2 the area instead the hedge, dike, and hill) is about 0.6 square miles. Using the population density of Florence, another inland settlement in a hilly area that in the medieval period was not built out to its walls, that would give us about 4500 people in Bree. If we then use Fonstad’s relative areas of Bree, Archet, Coomb, and Staddle, and assume 20% lower density in the outlying settlements, we get 1400 more people in Breeland, for about 6,000 peope in Breeland total.</p><p id="a846">But maybe we’ve overestimated Bree’s density. If we cut density in half, we end up at 3,000 people in all Breeland, of which 2250 in Bree proper. I think estimating Breeland at 3,000–6,000 is reasonable. It’s the largest settlement in the region, and if we take all of my designated Arthedain region to have about 190,000 people in the whole area, a largest settlement of 6,000 is plausible. Medieval Europe was <em>much </em>more urbanized than Arthedain, and had about 10% of the population in “urban” areas over 5,000 people. If we assume Bree to be the only such center, at 6,000, that makes 5% of the population in “urban” centers. At 3,000, it’s 2.5%. Neither of these seems crazy to me, though I’m biased towards maybe 3,000–4,000 people in Breeland.</p><h2 id="a674">Minas Tirith</h2><p id="05c0">In Minas Tirith we finally come to one of the real urban centers of Middle Earth. Here’s Fonstad’s map:</p><figure></figure><p id="2f32">These measurements put the total square footage of Minas Tirith at just around 1 square mile.</p><p id="2aec">What density should we apply to this?</p><p id="06fd">Well, I think we have a near perfect match. Here’s a map of Antioch:</p><figure></figure><p id="19f4">A fortress, garrison city between a river and a mountain. Also, Wigmore notes that Tolkien seems to have explicitly modeled a lot of Gondor on the Byzantines: it’s possible part of the inspiration for Minas Tirith actually came from Antioch! Certainly the Siege of Gondor proceeds with remarkable similarity to the crusader siege of Antioch in many regards.</p><p id="5080">So I take Antioch’s 1095 density of about 40,000 people per built-up mile to apply to Minas Tirith, yielding a population ultimately of around 42,000 people in Minas Tirith. This yields the idea that Minas Tirith can durably maintain 300–800 professional soldiers from its own resources, which is nice since the conventional figures in the fandom for the Minas Tirith Citadel Guards is around 250–1000. So a city of 40,000 Gondorians seems about right from what we know of Minas Tirith’s local military capacity.</p><p id="1229">Now, this does put about 20% of Anorien’s population in one big city, an area of concern. But I think we can justify this on historic grounds: Gondor’s population really <em>had </em>concentrated in a few defensible areas by TA 3019! Minas Tirith was the consolidated descendants of refugees of Minas Ithil Osgiliath, Ithilien, and northern Anorien. High threat from violence does tend to generate population concentration in defensible areas.</p><p id="a10b">So I think 42,000 people in Minas Tirith is a credible estimate. Of course, by the Siege of Gondor, most residents had been evacuated southwards to safer places, so the city as we see it in <em>Return of the King</em> is not at full population.</p><h2 id="84be">Edoras</h2><p id="3d09">Finally, we come to Edoras. Here’s Fonstad’s map:</p><figure></figure><p id="e881">This gives us a city of about 0.3 square miles. Again, I think Antioch is a good comparison for a steep hilly fortress town which also serves as a military site and administrative capitol. This gives us about 12,000 people in Edoras. That puts about 2% of Rohan’s population in an urban settlement (assuming there are no others over 5,000?), which is a bit low, but if we assume that the Rohirrim prefer to live with lots of pastureland and that many are pastoralists, it makes sense.</p><p id="f282">So, final verdicts:</p><p id="7d32"><strong>Lake Town-</strong> Maybe 1000–1500 people, but the settlement has gotta be a bit bigger than Tolkien lets on</p><p id="3c07"><strong>Breeland- </strong>3,000–4,000 men and hobbits combined</p><p id="0ff8"><strong>Minas Tirith-</strong> 42,000 inside the walls, and more out in the Pelennor</p><p id="7af4"><strong>Edoras-</strong> 12,000 inside the walls, and plausible tons of farmsteads within a few hours ride</p></div></div></article></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>Reaching 95%-ile isn't very impressive because it's not that hard to do. I think this is one of my most ridiculable ideas. It doesn't help that, when stated nakedly, that sounds elitist. But I think it's just the opposite: most people can become (relatively) good at most things.</p> <p>Note that when I say 95%-ile, I mean 95%-ile among people who participate, not all people (for many activities, just doing it at all makes you 99%-ile or above across all people). I'm also not referring to 95%-ile among people who practice regularly. The "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_weird_trick_advertisements">one weird trick</a>" is that, for a lot of activities, being something like 10%-ile among people who practice can make you something like 90%-ile or 99%-ile among people who participate.</p> <p>This post is going to refer to specifics since <a href="https://twitter.com/danluu/status/926493613097439232">the discussions I've seen about this are all in the abstract</a>, which turns them into Rorschach tests. For example, Scott Adams has a widely cited post claiming that it's better to be a generalist than a specialist because, to become "extraordinary", you have to either be "the best" at one thing or 75%-ile at two things. If that were strictly true, it would surely be better to be a generalist, but that's of course exaggeration and it's possible to get a lot of value out of a specialized skill without being "the best"; since the precise claim, as written, is obviously silly and the rest of the post is vague handwaving, discussions will inevitably devolve into people stating their prior beliefs and basically ignoring the content of the post.</p> <p>Personally, in every activity I've participated in where it's possible to get a rough percentile ranking, people who are 95%-ile constantly make mistakes that seem like they should be easy to observe and correct. "Real world" activities typically can't be reduced to a percentile rating, but achieving what appears to be a similar level of proficiency seems similarly easy.</p> <p>We'll start by looking at Overwatch (a video game) in detail because it's an activity I'm familiar with where it's easy to get ranking information and observe what's happening, and then we'll look at some "real world" examples where we can observe the same phenomena, although we won't be able to get ranking information for real world examples<sup id="fnref:S"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:S">1</a></sup>.</p> <h3 id="overwatch">Overwatch</h3> <p>At 90%-ile and 95%-ile ranks in Overwatch, the vast majority of players will pretty much constantly make basic game losing mistakes. These are simple mistakes like standing next to the objective instead of on top of the objective while the match timer runs out, turning a probable victory into a certain defeat. See the attached footnote if you want enough detail about specific mistakes that you can decide for yourself if a mistake is "basic" or not<sup id="fnref:O"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:O">2</a></sup>.</p> <p>Some reasons we might expect this to happen are:</p> <ol> <li>People don't want to win or don't care about winning</li> <li>People understand their mistakes but haven't put in enough time to fix them</li> <li>People are untalented</li> <li>People don't understand how to spot their mistakes and fix them</li> </ol> <p>In Overwatch, you may see a lot of (1), people who don’t seem to care about winning, at lower ranks, but by the time you get to 30%-ile, it's common to see people indicate their desire to win in various ways, such as yelling at players who are perceived as uncaring about victory or unskilled, complaining about people who they perceive to make mistakes that prevented their team from winning, etc.<sup id="fnref:A"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:A">3</a></sup>. Other than the occasional troll, it's not unreasonable to think that people are generally trying to win when they're severely angered by losing.</p> <p>(2), not having put in time enough to fix their mistakes will, at some point, apply to all players who are improving, but if you look at the median time played at 50%-ile, people who are stably ranked there have put in hundreds of hours (and the median time played at higher ranks is higher). Given how simple the mistakes we're discussing are, not having put in enough time cannot be the case for most players.</p> <p>A common complaint among low-ranked Overwatch players in Overwatch forums is that they're just not talented and can never get better. Most people probably don't have the talent to play in a professional league regardless of their practice regimen, but when you can get to 95%-ile by fixing mistakes like "not realizing that you should stand on the objective", you don't really need a lot of talent to get to 95%-ile.</p> <p>While (4), people not understanding how to spot and fix their mistakes, isn't the only other possible explanation<sup id="fnref:D"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:D">4</a></sup>, I believe it's the most likely explanation for most players. Most players who express frustration that they're stuck at a rank up to maybe 95%-ile or 99%-ile don't seem to realize that they could drastically improve by observing their own gameplay or having someone else look at their gameplay.</p> <p>One thing that's curious about this is that Overwatch makes it easy to spot basic mistakes (compared to most other activities). After you're killed, the game shows you how you died from the viewpoint of the player who killed you, allowing you to see what led to your death. Overwatch also records the entire game and lets you watch a replay of the game, allowing you to figure out what happened and why the game was won or lost. In many other games, you'd have to set up recording software to be able to view a replay.</p> <p>If you read Overwatch forums, you'll see a regular stream of posts that are basically "I'm SOOOOOO FRUSTRATED! I've played this game for 1200 hours and I'm still ranked 10%-ile, [some Overwatch specific stuff that will vary from player to player]". Another user will inevitably respond with something like "we can't tell what's wrong from your text, please post a video of your gameplay". In the cases where the original poster responds with a recording of their play, people will post helpful feedback that will immediately make the player much better if they take it seriously. If you follow these people who ask for help, you'll often see them ask for feedback at a much higher rank (e.g., moving from 10%-ile to 40%-ile) shortly afterwards. It's nice to see that the advice works, but it's unfortunate that so many players don't realize that watching their own recordings or posting recordings for feedback could have saved 1198 hours of frustration.</p> <p>It appears to be common for Overwatch players (well into 95%-ile and above) to:</p> <ul> <li>Want to improve</li> <li>Not get feedback</li> <li>Improve slowly when getting feedback would make improving quickly easy</li> </ul> <p>Overwatch provides the tools to make it relatively easy to get feedback, but people who very strongly express a desire to improve don't avail themselves of these tools.</p> <h3 id="real-life">Real life</h3> <p>My experience is that other games are similar and I think that "real life" activities aren't so different, although there are some complications.</p> <p>One complication is that real life activities tend not to have a single, one-dimensional, objective to optimize for. Another is that what makes someone good at a real life activity tends to be poorly understood (by comparison to games and sports) even in relation to a specific, well defined, goal.</p> <p>Games with rating systems are easy to optimize for: your meta-goal can be to get a high rating, which can typically be achieved by increasing your win rate by fixing the kinds of mistakes described above, like not realizing that you should step onto the objective. For any particular mistake, you can even make a reasonable guess at the impact on your win rate and therefore the impact on your rating.</p> <p>In real life, if you want to be (for example) "a good speaker", that might mean that you want to give informative talks that help people learn or that you want to give entertaining talks that people enjoy or that you want to give keynotes at prestigious conferences or that you want to be asked to give talks for $50k an appearance. Those are all different objectives, with different strategies for achieving them and for some particular mistake (e.g., spending 8 minutes on introducing yourself during a 20 minute talk), it's unclear what that means with respect to your goal.</p> <p>Another thing that makes games, at least mainstream ones, easy to optimize for is that they tend to have a lot of aficionados who have obsessively tried to figure out what's effective. This means that if you want to improve, unless you're trying to be among the top in the world, you can simply figure out what resources have worked for other people, pick one up, read/watch it, and then practice. For example, if you want to be 99%-ile in a trick-taking card game like bridge or spades (among all players, not subgroups like "ACBL players with masterpoints" or "people who regularly attend North American Bridge Championships"), you can do this by:</p> <ul> <li>learning the basics of the game</li> <li>reading <a href="https://amzn.to/2sUtmsk">a beginner book on cardplay</a></li> <li>practicing applying the material</li> </ul> <p>If you want to become a good speaker and you have a specific definition of “a good speaker” in mind, there still isn't an obvious path forward. Great speakers will give directly contradictory advice (e.g., avoid focusing on presentation skills vs. practice presentation skills). Relatively few people obsessively try to improve and figure out what works, which results in a lack of rigorous curricula for improving. However, this also means that it's easy to improve in percentile terms since <a href="https://twitter.com/danluu/status/1442945072144678914">relatively few people are trying to improve at all</a>.</p> <p>Despite all of the caveats above, my belief is that it's easier to become relatively good at real life activities relative to games or sports because there's so little delibrate practice put into most real life activities. Just for example, if you're a local table tennis hotshot who can beat every rando at a local bar, when you challenge someone to a game and they say "sure, what's your rating?" you know you're in shellacking by someone who can probably beat you while playing with a shoe brush. You're probably 99%-ile, but someone with no talent who's put in the time to practice the basics is going to have a serve that you can't return as well as be able to kill any shot a local bar expert is able to consitently hit. In most real life activities, there's almost no one who puts in a level of delibrate practice equivalent to someone who goes down to their local table tennis club and practices two hours a week, let alone someone like a top pro, who might seriously train for four hours a day.</p> <p>To give a couple of concrete examples, I helped <a href="http://blog.leahhanson.us/speaking.html">Leah</a> prepare for talks from 2013 to 2017. The first couple practice talks she gave were about the same as you'd expect if you walked into a random talk at a large tech conference. For the first couple years she was speaking, she did something like 30 or so practice runs for each public talk, of which I watched and gave feedback on half. Her first public talk was (IMO) well above average for a talk at a large, well regarded, tech conference and her talks got better from there until she stopped speaking in 2017.</p> <p>As we discussed above, this is more subjective than game ratings and there's no way to really determine a percentile, but if you look at how most people prepare for talks, it's not too surprising that Leah was above average. At one of the first conferences she spoke at, the night before the conference, we talked to another speaker who mentioned that they hadn't finished their talk yet and only had fifteen minutes of material (for a forty minute talk). They were trying to figure out how to fill the rest of the time. That kind of preparation isn't unusual and the vast majority of talks prepared like that aren't great.</p> <p>Most people consider doing 30 practice runs for a talk to be absurd, a totally obsessive amount of practice, but I think Gary Bernhardt has it right when he says that, if you're giving a 30-minute talk to a 300 person audience, that's 150 person-hours watching your talk, so it's not obviously unreasonable to spend 15 hours practicing (and 30 practice runs will probably be less than 15 hours since you can cut a number of the runs short and/or repeatedly practice problem sections). One thing to note that this level of practice, considered obessive when giving a talk, still pales in comparison to the amount of time a middling table tennis club player will spend practicing.</p> <p>If you've studied pedagogy, you might say that the help I gave to Leah was incredibly lame. It's known that having laypeople try to figure out how to improve among themselves is among the worst possible ways to learn something, good instruction is more effective and having a skilled coach or teacher give one-on-one instruction is more effective still<sup id="fnref:C"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:C">5</a></sup>. That's 100% true, my help was incredibly lame. However, most people aren't going to practice a talk more than a couple times and many won't even practice a single time (I don't have great data proving this, this is from informally polling speakers at conferences I've attended). This makes Leah's 30 practice runs an extraordinary amount of practice compared to most speakers, which resulted in a relatively good outcome even though we were using one of the worst possible techniques for improvement.</p> <p>My writing is another example. I'm not going to compare myself to anyone else, but my writing improved dramatically the first couple of years I wrote this blog just because I spent a little bit of effort on getting and taking feedback.</p> <p>Leah read one or two drafts of almost every post and gave me feedback. On the first posts, since neither one of us knew anything about writing, we had a hard time identifying what was wrong. If I had some awkward prose or confusing narrative structure, we'd be able to point at it and say "that looks wrong" without being able to describe what was wrong or suggest a fix. It was like, in the era before spellcheck, when you misspelled a word and could tell that something was wrong, but every permutation you came up with was just as wrong.</p> <p>My fix for that was to hire a professional editor whose writing I respected with the instructions "I don't care about spelling and grammar fixes, there are fundamental problems with my writing that I don't understand, please explain to me what they are"<sup id="fnref:F"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:F">6</a></sup>. I think this was more effective than my helping Leah with talks because we got someone who's basically a professional coach involved. An example of something my editor helped us with was giving us a vocabulary we could use to discuss structural problems, the way <a href="https://amzn.to/2GPPmYE">design patterns</a> gave people a vocabulary to talk about OO design.</p> <h3 id="back-to-this-blog-s-regularly-scheduled-topic-programming">Back to this blog's regularly scheduled topic: programming</h3> <p>Programming is similar to the real life examples above in that it's impossible to assign a rating or calculate percentiles or anything like that, but it is still possible to make significant improvements relative to your former self without too much effort by getting feedback on what you're doing.</p> <p>For example, <a href="https://twitter.com/danluu/status/926492239081197569">here's one thing Michael Malis did</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>One incredibly useful exercise I’ve found is to watch myself program. Throughout the week, I have a program running in the background that records my screen. At the end of the week, I’ll watch a few segments from the previous week. Usually I will watch the times that felt like it took a lot longer to complete some task than it should have. While watching them, I’ll pay attention to specifically where the time went and figure out what I could have done better. When I first did this, I was really surprised at where all of my time was going.</p> <p>For example, previously when writing code, I would write all my code for a new feature up front and then test all of the code collectively. When testing code this way, I would have to isolate which function the bug was in and then debug that individual function. After watching a recording of myself writing code, I realized I was spending about a quarter of the total time implementing the feature tracking down which functions the bugs were in! This was completely non-obvious to me and I wouldn’t have found it out without recording myself. Now that I’m aware that I spent so much time isolating which function a bugs are in, I now test each function as I write it to make sure they work. This allows me to write code a lot faster as it dramatically reduces the amount of time it takes to debug my code.</p> </blockquote> <p>In the past, I've spent time figuring out where time is going when I code and basically saw the same thing as in Overwatch, except instead of constantly making game-losing mistakes, I was constantly doing pointlessly time-losing things. Just getting rid of some of those bad habits has probably been at least a 2x productivity increase for me, pretty easy to measure since fixing these is basically just clawing back wasted time. For example, I noticed how I'd get distracted for N minutes if I read something on the internet when I needed to wait for two minutes, so I made sure to keep a queue of useful work to fill dead time (and if I was working on something very latency sensitive where I didn't want to task switch, I'd do nothing until I was done waiting).</p> <p>One thing to note here is that it's important to actually track what you're doing and not just guess at what you're doing. When I've recorded what people do and compare it to what they think they're doing, these are often quite different. It would generally be considered absurd to operate a complex software system without metrics or tracing, but it's normal to operate yourself without metrics or tracing, even though you're much more complex and harder to understand than the software you work on.</p> <p><a href="https://danluu.com/hn-comments/#what-makes-engineers-productive-https-news-ycombinator-com-item-id-5496914">Jonathan Tang has noted that choosing the right problem dominates execution speed</a>. I don't disagree with that, <a href="https://danluu.com/productivity-velocity/">but doubling execution speed is still decent win that's independent of selecting the right problem to work on</a> and I don't think that discussing how to choose the right problem can be effectively described in the abstract and the context necessary to give examples would be much longer than the already too long Overwatch examples in this post, maybe I'll write another post that's just about that.</p> <p>Anyway, this is sort of an odd post for me to write since I think that culturally, we care a bit too much about productivity in the U.S., especially in places I've lived recently (NYC &amp; SF). But at a personal level, higher productivity doing work or chores doesn't have to be converted into more work or chores, it can also be converted into more vacation time or more time doing whatever you value.</p> <p>And for games like Overwatch, I don't think improving is a moral imperative; there's nothing wrong with having fun at 50%-ile or 10%-ile or any rank. But in every game I've played with a rating and/or league/tournament system, a lot of people get really upset and unhappy when they lose even when they haven't put much effort into improving. If that's the case, why not put a little bit of effort into improving and spend a little bit less time being upset?</p> <h3 id="some-meta-techniques-for-improving">Some meta-techniques for improving</h3> <ul> <li>Get feedback and practice <ul> <li>Ideally from an expert coach but, if not, this can be from a layperson or even yourself (if you have some way of recording/tracing what you're doing)</li> </ul></li> <li>Guided exercises or exercises with solutions <ul> <li>This is very easy to find in books for "old" games, like chess or Bridge.</li> <li>For particular areas, you can often find series of books that have these, e.g., in math, books in the Springer Undergraduate Mathematics Series (SUMS) tend to have problems with solutions</li> </ul></li> </ul> <p>Of course, these aren't novel ideas, e.g., Kotov's series of books from the 70s, Think like a Grandmaster, Play Like a Grandmaster, Train Like a Grandmaster covered these same ideas because these are some of the most obvious ways to improve.</p> <h3 id="appendix-other-most-ridiculable-ideas">Appendix: other most ridiculable ideas</h3> <p>Here are the ideas I've posted about that were the most widely ridiculed at the time of the post:</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://danluu.com/startup-tradeoffs/">It's not uncommon for programmers at trendy tech companies to make $350k/yr or more</a> (2015, stated number was $250k/yr at the time)</li> <li><a href="https://danluu.com/monorepo/">Monorepos can be reasonable</a> (2015)</li> <li><a href="https://danluu.com/cpu-bugs/">We should expect to see a lot more CPU bugs</a> (2016)</li> <li><a href="https://danluu.com/tech-discrimination/">Markets are not incompatible with discrimination</a> (2014)</li> <li><a href="https://danluu.com/input-lag/">Computers are getting slower in some ways</a> (2017)</li> <li><a href="https://danluu.com/empirical-pl/">Empirical evidence on the benefit of types is almost non-existent</a> (2014)</li> <li>It's reasonable to write technical posts on a subject that avoid domain-specific terminology</li> </ul> <p>My posts on compensation have the dubious distinction of being the posts most frequently called out both for being so obvious that they're pointless as well as for being laughably wrong. I suspect they're also the posts that have had the largest aggregate impact on people -- I've had a double digit number of people tell me one of the compensation posts changed their life and they now make $x00,000/yr more than they used to because they know it's possible to get a much higher paying job and I doubt that I even hear from 10% of the people who make a big change as a result of learning that it's possible to make a lot more money.</p> <p>When I wrote my first post on compensation, in 2015, I got ridiculed more for writing something obviously wrong than for writing something obvious, but the last few years things have flipped around. I still get the occasional bit of ridicule for being wrong when some corner of Twitter or a web forum that's well outside the HN/reddit bubble runs across my post, but the ratio of “obviously wrong” to “obvious” has probably gone from 20:1 to 1:5.</p> <p>Opinions on monorepos have also seen a similar change since 2015. Outside of some folks at big companies, monorepos used to be considered obviously stupid among people who keep up with trends, but this has really changed. Not as much as opinions on compensation, but enough that I'm now a little surprised when I meet a hardline anti-monorepo-er.</p> <p>Although it's taken longer for opinions to come around on CPU bugs, that's probably the post that now gets the least ridicule from the list above.</p> <p>That markets don't eliminate all discrimination is the one where opinions have come around the least. Hardline "all markets are efficient" folks aren't really convinced by academic work like <a href="https://amzn.to/2Or7Z9k">Becker's The Economics of Discrimination</a> or summaries like <a href="https://danluu.com/tech-discrimination/">the evidence laid out in the post</a>.</p> <p>The posts on computers having higher latency and the lack of empirical evidence of the benefit of types are the posts I've seen pointed to the most often to defend a ridiculable opinion. I didn't know when I started doing the work for either post and they both happen to have turned up evidence that's the opposite of the most common loud claims (there's very good evidence that advanced type systems improve safety in practice and of course computers are faster in every way, people who think they're slower are just indulging in nostalgia). I don't know if this has changed many opinion. However, I haven't gotten much direct ridicule for either post even though both posts directly state a position I see commonly ridiculed online. I suspect that's partially because both posts are empirical, so there's not much to dispute (though the post on discrimnation is also empirical, but it still gets its share of ridicule).</p> <p>The last idea in the list is more meta: no one directly tells me that I should use more obscure terminology. Instead, I get comments that I must not know much about X because I'm not using terms of art. Using terms of art is a common way to establish credibility or authority, but that's something I don't really believe in. Arguing from authority doesn't tell you anything; adding needless terminology just makes things more difficult for readers who aren't in the field and are reading because they're interested in the topic but don't want to actually get into the field.</p> <p>This is a pretty fundamental disagreement that I have with a lot of people. Just for example, I recently got into a discussion with an authority who insisted that it wasn't possible for me to reasonably disagree with them (I suggested we agree to disagree) because they're an authority on the topic and I'm not. It happens that I worked on the formal verification of a system very similar to the system we were discussing, but I didn't mention that because I don't believe that my status as an authority on the topic matters. If someone has such a weak argument that they have to fall back on an infallible authority, that's usually a sign that they don't have a well-reasoned defense of their position. This goes double when they point to themselves as the infallible authority.</p> <p>I have about 20 other posts on stupid sounding ideas queued up in my head, but I mostly try to avoid writing things that are controversial, so I don't know that I'll write many of those up. If I were to write one post a month (much more frequently than my recent rate) and limit myself to 10% posts on ridiculable ideas, it would take 16 years to write up all of the ridiculable ideas I currently have.</p>  <ul> <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1a-lhjmfPw">Skyline</a>: 99%-ile isn't that good</li> <li><a href="https://twitter.com/JamesClear/status/1292574538912456707">James Clear</a>: 90%-ile isn't that good</li> <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120428193015/http://jinfiesto.posterous.com/how-to-seem-good-at-everything-stop-doing-stu">Josh Infiesto</a>: 80%-ile isn't that good</li> <li><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/10/03/personal-best">Atul Gawande</a>: coaching / feedback is powerful and underrated</li> </ul> <p><small>Thanks to Leah Hanson, Hillel Wayne, Robert Schuessler, Michael Malis, Kevin Burke, Jeremie Jost, Pierre-Yves Baccou, Veit Heller, Jeff Fowler, Malte Skarupe, David Turner, Akiva Leffert, Lifan Zeng, John Hergenroder, Wesley Aptekar-Cassels, Chris Lample, Julia Evans, Anja Boskovic, Vaibhav Sagar, Sean Talts, Emil Sit, Ben Kuhn, Valentin Hartmann, Sean Barrett, Kevin Shannon, Enzo Ferey, Yuri Vishnevsky, and an anonymous commenter for comments/corrections/discussion.</small></p>   </div></div>]]></description>

This person called the company "the biggest and slowest" of all the major tech companies — the exact opposite of how OpenAI employees see their startup.</p><h2>Pressure to sign</h2><p>Given the absence of interest in joining Microsoft, many OpenAI employees "felt pressured" to sign the open letter, the employee admitted. The letter itself was drafted by a group of longtime staffers who have the most clout and money at stake with years of industry standing and equity built up, as well as higher pay. They began calling other staffers late on Sunday night, urging them to sign, the employee explained.</p><p>"We all left these big corporations to move fast and build exciting things," the employee said. "The bureaucracy of something as big as Microsoft is soul crushing."</p><p>While OpenAI staffers would have followed through with their threat and joined Microsoft, they probably would have left at the first opportunity for other AI startups such as Anthropic, Hugging Face, and Cohere, the employee added.</p><h2>Looking down on legacy tech</h2><p>Another former OpenAI employee agreed, saying people working at the San Francisco-based startup "look down on what they consider legacy companies" and "see themselves as innovators who are radically changing the world."</p><p>OpenAI products like ChatGPT and DALL-E kicked off the current <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/chatgpt-impact-big-surprise-openai-meta-yann-lecun-ai-chatbot-2023-12" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""><u>AI craze in tech</u></a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ai-companies-that-have-raised-at-least-50-million-this-year-2023-11" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""><u>investing</u></a>. The startup's avowed goal is artificial general intelligence, or AGI, which it defines as technology that can "outperform humans at most economically valuable work." It's a lofty goal well outside the norm for Microsoft, and some people at OpenAI think the enterprise software giant would not have been capable of continuing the mission.</p><p>"Even though we have a partnership with Microsoft, internally, we have no respect for their talent bar," the current OpenAI employee told BI. "It rubbed people the wrong way to entertain being managed by them."</p><p>OpenAI declined to comment, while Microsoft did not respond to a request for comment.</p><h2>Money, the great motivator</h2><p>Beyond the culture clash between the two companies, there was another important factor at play for OpenAI employees: money. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/openai-unique-compensation-package-among-tech-companies-ppu-2023-6" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""><u>Lots of it</u></a> was set to disappear before their eyes if OpenAI were to suddenly collapse under a mass exodus of staff.</p><p>"Sam Altman is not the best CEO, but millions and millions of dollars and equity are at stake," the current OpenAI employee said.</p><p>Not only are OpenAI employees paid very well in cash, with base salaries typically starting at $300,000, a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/openai-unique-compensation-package-among-tech-companies-ppu-2023-6" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""><u>typical equity package</u></a> is worth $2 million over four years, and much more for some workers.</p><h2>A laughable idea</h2><p>Microsoft agreed to hire all OpenAI employees at their same level of compensation, but this was only a verbal agreement in the heat of the moment.</p><p>Another OpenAI employee openly laughed at the idea that Microsoft would have paid departing staffers for the equity they would have lost by following Altman.</p><p>A scheduled tender offer, which was about to let employees sell their existing vested equity to outside investors, would have been canceled. All that equity would have been worth "nothing," this employee said.</p><p>The former OpenAI employee estimated that, of the hundreds of people who signed the letter saying they would leave, "probably 70% of the folks on that list were like, 'Hey, can we, you know, have this tender go through?'"</p><p>Thanks to the success of their big bluff, Altman is back and the tender offer is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/30/openai-tender-offer-on-track-despite-leadership-fracas-sources.html#:~:text=The%20tender%20offer%20will%20value,to%20discuss%20private%20communications%20freely." data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow"><u>going on as planned</u></a>, valuing OpenAI at more than $80 billion. It was even extended through January 5, according to CNBC, giving employees more time to become millionaires — if they aren't already.</p><h2>Furious Microsoft employees</h2><p>Some Microsoft employees, meanwhile, were furious that the company promised to match salaries for hundreds of OpenAI employees. The offer came after Microsoft had laid off more than 10,000 employees, frozen salaries, and cut bonuses and stock awards this year.</p><p>"How many loyal employees who stayed at Microsoft while working 12+ hours daily and living in constant fear of being laid off all year?" one Microsoft employee told BI.

  <p>Today, we are releasing StableLM Zephyr 3B: a new chat model representing the latest iteration in our series of lightweight LLMs, preference tuned for instruction following and Q&amp;A-type tasks. This model is an extension of the pre-existing StableLM 3B-4e1t model and is inspired by the <a href="https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta" target="_blank"><span>Zephyr 7B model from HuggingFace</span></a>. With StableLM Zephyr's 3 billion parameters, this model efficiently caters to a wide range of text generation needs, from simple queries to complex instructional contexts on edge devices.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Training Insights</strong></p><p>The development of StableLM Zephyr 3B focused on creating a model that performs well in text generation and aligns human preferences. Inspired by Zephyr 7B, we adapted its training pipeline, with the first step being supervised fine-tuning on multiple instruction datasets, including UltraChat, MetaMathQA, Evol Wizard Dataset, &amp; Capybara Dataset. In the second step, we aligned the model with the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) algorithm utilizing the UltraFeedback dataset. This dataset is from the OpenBMB research group and comprises 64,000 prompts and corresponding model responses. Recently released models, such as <a href="https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta" target="_blank"><span>Zephyr-7B</span></a>, <a href="https://huggingface.co/Intel/neural-chat-7b-v3-1" target="_blank"><span>Neural-Chat-7B</span></a>, and <a href="https://huggingface.co/allenai/tulu-2-dpo-70b" target="_blank"><span>Tulu-2-DPO-70B</span></a>, successfully used Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). However, Stable Zephyr is one of the first models of this type yet with the efficient size of 3B parameters.</p><p><strong>Model Performance</strong></p><p>Benchmarked on platforms such as <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05685" target="_blank"><span>MT Bench</span></a> and <a href="https://tatsu-lab.github.io/alpaca_eval/" target="_blank"><span>AlpacaEval</span></a>, StableLM Zephyr 3B demonstrates superior capabilities in generating contextually relevant, coherent, and linguistically accurate text.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>More details on our testing, datasets, and safety can be found in our <a href="https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stablelm-zephyr-3b" target="_blank"><span>model card</span></a>. In summary, our performance tests have shown that StableLM Zephyr 3B is capable of surpassing models of larger size tailored for similar use cases, showcasing the power and efficiency inherent in this new model.</p><p><strong>Enabling Diverse Applications</strong></p><p>StableLM Zephyr 3B is a lightweight yet accurate model equipped to handle multiple linguistic tasks efficiently and accurately. The model has been strengthened to assist in instructional and Q&amp;A-type tasks. It's versatile enough for various complex applications, from crafting creative content like copywriting and summarization to aiding in developing instructional design and content personalization. Additionally, it offers a powerful and insightful analysis based on the input data. All this is accomplished while retaining its efficient 3 billion parameter size, 60% smaller than  7b models, enabling use on devices lacking the computational power of dedicated high-end systems.</p><p><strong>Commercial Applications</strong></p><p>If you want to use this model for your commercial products or purposes, please contact us <a href="https://stability.ai/contact"><span>here</span></a> to learn more. </p><p>You can also stay updated on our progress by signing up for our <a href="https://stability.ai/home#newsletter"><span>newsletter</span></a>, following us on <a href="https://twitter.com/stabilityai" target="_blank"><span>Twitter</span></a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/stability.ai/" target="_blank"><span>Instagram</span></a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/stability-ai" target="_blank"><span>LinkedIn</span></a>, and joining our <a href="https://discord.gg/stablediffusion" target="_blank"><span>Discord Community</span></a><span>.</span></p>

<p>One of my ongoing fixations with the web is how improvements in technology inform web design. In an earlier post this year I <a href="https://daniel.do/article/its-the-future-stop-using-jpegs/#some-background">wrote about my theory</a> that the increasing pixel density of displays galvanized the shift from photography to vector illustrations in the early to mid 2010s.</p>
<p>In recent years there has been a design trend that runs counter to this. Illustrations still rule in web design, but instead of clean, flat shapes there has been an emergence of texture, usually as part of a design’s lighting or shading and <em>usually</em> a “noisy” or grainy texture.</p>

<p>I’m not hip enough to know if this style has been assigned a pithy label, but I do enjoy it. At the same time, I find it frustrating — because as far as I can tell (the lack of examples I have seen in the wild supports this theory) there isn’t an easy way to replicate these illustrations with SVGs. They can probably be exported as such from illustration programs but it’s likely these applied textures are raster or if they are vector, quite large in size.</p>
<p>SVGs are an interesting subject to me, because the specification for them is dense and there are usually multiple ways to accomplish an effect. Most SVGs are simply exported directly from a graphics program and have a lot of inefficiencies etc… which has led to the emergence of tools like <a href="https://github.com/svg/svgo">SVGO</a>.</p>
<p>I’m not an expert on the subject (I feel like the older I get, the less I feel like I can claim that about anything) but in recent years have taken to hand tuning and occasionally writing my own SVGs from scratch so I am not a complete novice either.</p>
<p>I decided to give creating an SVG using this illustration style a shot. My goal was to use the regular SVG specification to write a simple illustration that had this noisy, textured shadow effect. An additional goal was for this illustration to be moderately flexible, something that could easily be turned into a component in Svelte or React and changed for different shapes and colors. For more direct inspiration, I looked to the designer Josh Warren who has experimented a lot with using this style and simple geometry to nice effect:</p>

<h2 id="basic-shape-and-gradient"><a href="#basic-shape-and-gradient" aria-label="basic shape and gradient permalink"></a>Basic shape and gradient</h2>
<p>Drawing a circle or square in an SVG is really easy. There are primitives for them.</p>
<div>
<div data-language="html"><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>svg</span> <span>viewbox</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>0 0 100 100<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>
	<span><span><span>&lt;</span>circle</span> <span>cx</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>50<span>"</span></span> <span>cy</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>50<span>"</span></span> <span>r</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>50<span>"</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span>
<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>svg</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<svg viewBox="0 0 100 100">
	<circle cx="50" cy="50" r="50"></circle>
</svg>
</div>
<p>The tricky part is everything else. If you want to apply a gradient, you can specify that as the <code>fill</code> - but what if you want a gradient that changes with the base color you specify? So you don’t have to define a custom gradient with specific colors if you want to reuse the component. Then you’ve entered <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/mask">mask</a> territory. The way masks work in SVGs is that you use the “colors” black and white to how you want a mask to work. It’s a little confusing, but I’ve tried to keep the code example simple.</p>
<p>(As an aside, I have to give huge kudos to MDN’s excellent documentation, this project could not have been done without it!)</p>
<p>This can actually be optimized a little more. We know we’re going to use the same circle shape multiple times, so we can define it once in <code>&lt;defs&gt;</code>, assign it an id and simply reference it with the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/use"><code>use</code></a> element. This makes the code a little more DRY:</p>

 <span><span><span>&lt;</span>use</span> <span>href</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>#shape<span>"</span></span> <span>mask</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>url(#gradient)<span>"</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span>
<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>svg</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
  <svg viewBox="0 0 100 100">
    <defs>
      <circle id="shape" cx="50" cy="50" r="50"></circle>
      <mask id="gradient">
        <linearGradient id="fade">
          <stop offset="0%" stop-color="black" stop-opacity="0.5"></stop>
          <stop offset="75%" stop-color="white" stop-opacity="1"></stop>
        </linearGradient>
        <use href="#shape" fill="url('#fade')"></use>
      </mask>
    </defs>
    <use href="#shape" mask="url(#gradient)"></use>
  </svg>
</div>
<p>So we’ve got the shape and a gradient going, but how do we add a texture to that gradient? The answer is with a filter. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial/Filter_effects">MDN’s documentation on SVG Filters</a> goes into better detail on the nuts and bolts of how filters work. I also found this <a href="https://tympanus.net/codrops/2019/02/19/svg-filter-effects-creating-texture-with-feturbulence/">excellent article</a> that goes into great detail about creating textures for SVGs.</p>
<p>To create noise, I used the <code>&lt;feTurbulence&gt;</code> filter which is explicitly for generating artificial textures but required quite a bit of fiddling to get to my liking. Then, I had to use other filter effects to eliminate color variance and blend naturally with the fill color selected, and finally apply the filter to the circle.</p>

<p>Adding a nice fill color and making the gradient a little more subtle and there we go!</p>
<p>With some additional playing around I was able to create <a href="https://danielimmke.github.io/noisy-shapes">an illustration</a> I was quite happy with. It’s not perfect, and notably renders differently in Safari than other browsers but it achieves what I set out to accomplish.</p>
<p>You can also check out the code in the <a href="https://github.com/danielimmke/noisy-shapes">repository</a>.</p>
<p>This method could certainly be improved with additional experimenting. It’s still a far cry from the complexity of some of the illustrations I linked, but I think it could potentially be refined to be usable in more situations.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>A few days ago was the 30th anniversary of the first time I wrote an HTML document.&nbsp; Back in 1993, I took a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet">Usenet</a> posting of the “Incomplete Mystery Science Theater 3000 Episode Guide” and marked it up.&nbsp; You can see <a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/cwru/mst3keg/mst3kf.html">the archived copy</a> here on meyerweb.&nbsp; At some point, the markup got updated for reasons I don’t remember, but I can guarantee you the original had uppercase tag names and I didn’t close any paragraphs.&nbsp; That’s because I was using <code>&lt;P&gt;</code> as a shorthand for <code>&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;</code>, which was the style at the time.</p>

<p>Its last-updated date of December 3, 1993, is also the date I created it.&nbsp; I was on lobby duty with the <a href="https://films.cwru.edu/">CWRU Film Society</a>, and had lugged a laptop (I think it was an Apple PowerBook of some variety, something like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerBook_180">a 180</a>, borrowed from my workplace) and a printout of <a href="https://www.w3.org/MarkUp/draft-ietf-iiir-html-01.txt"> the HTML specification</a> (or maybe it was “<a href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Tags.html">Tags in HTML</a>”?) along with me.</p>

<p>I spent most of that evening in the lobby of <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Strosacker_Auditorium,_Case_Western_Reserve_University,_Cleveland,_OH_(28593864547).jpg">Strosacker Auditorium</a>, typing tags and doing find-and-replace operations in Microsoft Word, and then saving as text to a file that ended in <code>.html</code>, which was the style at the time.&nbsp; By the end of the night, I had more or less what you see in the archived copy.</p>

<p>The only visual change between then and now is that a year or two later, when I put the file up in my home directory, I added the toolbars at the top and bottom of the page&nbsp; —  toolbars I’d designed and made a layout standard as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_Western_Reserve_University">CWRU</a>’s webmaster.&nbsp; Which itself only happened because I learned HTML.</p>

<p>A couple of years ago, I was fortunate enough to be able to relate some of this story to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Hodgson">Joel Hodgson</a> himself.&nbsp; The story delighted him, which delighted me, because delighting someone who has been a longtime hero really is one of life’s great joys.&nbsp; And the fact that I got to have that conversation, to feel that joy, is inextricably rooted in my sitting in that lobby with that laptop and that printout and that Usenet post, adding tags and saving as text and hitting reload in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_(web_browser)">Mosaic</a> to instantly see the web page take shape, thirty years ago this week.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://tailscale.com/blog/choose-your-ip/">https://tailscale.com/blog/choose-your-ip/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38559192">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>Tailscale assigns every one of your nodes a private IPv4 address. We do this from the <a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1015/100.x-addresses/">CGNAT range</a>,
which is typically used by ISPs that have run out of public IPv4 addresses. Starting today, you have control over what
IP address from that range is assigned to your nodes. This gives you the ability to decide what subset of the CGNAT
range your tailnet uses to avoid conflicts with other applications.</p>
<h2 id="globally-unique-to-locally-unique">Globally unique to locally unique</h2>
<p>In the early days of Tailscale we decided to allocate every node a unique IP address within the Tailscale universe. This
was particularly handy for <a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1084/sharing/">node sharing</a>, when you let someone from another tailnet access a node in
your tailnet, they got to see it as the same CGNAT address. It also met our needs when we were an early-stage startup;
the CGNAT <code>100.64.0.0/10</code> range has some four million IP addresses, plenty for an experimental project that may or may
not be interesting to users. It turns out people like to use Tailscale and we are running out of IPs.</p>
<p>We had a few options — we could add other private IP address ranges to the CGNAT space we allocate, but this would have
at best been a stopgap. Or, we could have required all users to use IPv6 addresses, as we already also allocate nodes
and addresses from the much larger pool of IPv6 ULA addresses. We all know how well IPv6 adoption has gone —  this would
have broken legacy software our customers use that does not support IPv6. Rather, we decided to no longer allocate
globally unique CGNAT addresses, and allow the reuse of CGNAT addresses in different tailnets.</p>
<p>It also gives us the flexibility to allow enterprises to limit the range of CGNAT IP addresses that get allocated to
their tailnets, for compatibility with other systems that allocate from parts of the CGNAT range.</p>
<h2 id="jump-into-your-own-pool">Jump into your own pool</h2>
<p>Along with flexible addressing, we are launching a beta feature to let you define the <a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1304/ip-pool/">IP pool</a> that
your nodes are assigned from the CGNAT range. This is done as part of your tailnet policy:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="json"><span><span>    <span>{</span>
</span></span><span><span>        <span>"acls"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>"..."</span><span>],</span>
</span></span><span><span>        <span>"nodeAttrs"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span>
</span></span><span><span>            <span>{</span>
</span></span><span><span>                <span>"target"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>"autogroup:admin"</span><span>],</span>
</span></span><span><span>                <span>"ipPool"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>"100.81.0.0/16"</span><span>],</span>
</span></span><span><span>            <span>},</span>
</span></span><span><span>            <span>{</span>
</span></span><span><span>                <span>"target"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>"group:dev"</span><span>],</span>
</span></span><span><span>                <span>"ipPool"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>"100.85.0.0/16"</span><span>],</span>
</span></span><span><span>            <span>},</span>
</span></span><span><span>        <span>],</span>
</span></span><span><span>    <span>}</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>With this <a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1018/acls/#node-attributes">node attribute</a> set, all new nodes managed by admins in your tailnet will be
assigned an IP from the range: <code>100.81.0.0/16</code>, whereas nodes managed by members of <code>group:dev</code> will be assigned an IP
from a subset from the range: <code>100.85.0.0/16</code>.</p>
<h2 id="change-ip-of-existing-nodes">Change IP of existing nodes</h2>
<p>Before these changes, IPv4 addresses were immutable. With locally unique IPv4, however, you can change the address for any node in your tailnet in a couple clicks, even nodes that have been shared to you!</p>

</video>
<h2 id="natural-solutions">NATural solutions</h2>
<p>Address reuse causes no issue in the common case of a perfectly private tailnet, but if not implemented carefully, it
could wreak havoc with node sharing. If I try to share my node <code>100.65.1.1</code> with you, and you already have a node
numbered <code>100.65.1.1</code>, where do your packets go?</p>
<p>To address this (no pun intended), we assign shared nodes a new IP address from the tailnet it is shared into. Each
Tailscale node collects a new IP address for each share. Assigning multiple addresses to an interface causes a lot of UX
pain with some software, so instead nodes in the shared-to tailnet 1-1 NAT packets destined for the shared node, right
before they flow into the WireGuard tunnel.</p>
<p>This means the tailnet of the shared node never has to be aware of the IP addresses assigned to it in other tailnets,
which greatly simplifies accounting.</p>
<p>Now, each tailnet can have up to four million nodes with IPv4 addresses. If you are the sort of enterprise that needs
more than that, let’s chat.</p>
<p>One thing you can rely on with IPv4: whatever the problem, Network Address Translation is part of the solution.</p>

</h2>
<p dir="auto">Open source tools and guidelines for sending webhooks easily, securely, and reliably</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Introduction</h2>
<p dir="auto">Webhooks are becoming increasingly popular and are used by many of the world's top companies for sending events to users of their APIs. However, the ecosystem is fragmented, with each webhook provider using different implementations and varying quality. Even high quality implementations vary, making them inherently incompatible. This fragmentation is a pain for the providers and consumers, stifling innovation.</p>
<p dir="auto">For consumers, this means handling webhooks differently for every provider, relearning how to verify webhooks, and encountering gotchas with bespoke implementations. For providers, this means reinventing the wheel, redesigning for issues that have already been solved (security, forward compatibility, etc.).</p>
<p dir="auto">We propose a simple solution: standardize webhooks across the industry. This design document outlines our proposal, a set of strict webhook guidelines based on the existing industry best practices. We call it "Standard Webhooks".</p>
<p dir="auto">We believe "Standard Webhooks" can do for webhooks what JWT did for API authentication. Adopting a common protocol that is consistent and supported by different implementations will solve the above issues, and will enable new tools and innovations in webhook ecosystem.</p>
<p dir="auto">To achieve this, we have created an open source and community-driven set of tools and guidelines for sending webhooks.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">What are Webhooks?</h2>
<p dir="auto">Webhooks are a common name for HTTP callbacks, and are a way for services to notify each other of events. Webhooks are part of a service's API, though you can think of them as a sort of a "reverse API". When a client wants to make a request to a service they make an API call, and when the service wants to notify the client of an event the service triggers a webhook ("a user has paid", "task has finished", etc.).</p>
<p dir="auto">Webhooks are server-to-server, in the sense that both the customer and the service in the above description, should be operating HTTP servers, one to receive the API calls and one to receive the webhooks.It's important to note that while webhooks usually co-exist with a traditional API, this is not a requirement, and some services send webhooks without offering a traditional API.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Read the specification</h2>
<p dir="auto">The latest draft specification can be found at <a href="https://github.com/standard-webhooks/standard-webhooks/blob/main/spec/standard-webhooks.md">spec/standard-webhooks.md</a> which tracks the latest commit to the master branch in this repository.
The human-readable markdown file is the source of truth for the specification.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Reference implementations</h2>
<p dir="auto">There are reference implementations for the signature verification theme for a variety of languages, including:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><a href="https://github.com/standard-webhooks/standard-webhooks/tree/main/libraries/python">Python</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/standard-webhooks/standard-webhooks/tree/main/libraries/javascript">JavaScript/TypeScript</a></li>

<li><a href="https://github.com/standard-webhooks/standard-webhooks/tree/main/libraries/csharp">C#</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Technical steering committee</h2>
<p dir="auto">The Standard Webhooks initiative, the specification, and development of tooling is driven by the community and guided by the technical steering committee.</p>

</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Example ecosystem benefits of Standard Webhooks</h2>
<p dir="auto">We believe "Standard Webhooks" can do to webhooks what JWT did to API authentication. Having a common protocol that is consistent will enable a variety of implementations to interoperate, reducing the development burden on webhook consumers and enabling new uses. Some of these benefits include:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>API Gateway signature verification: signature verification is a common challenge for webhook consumers. Standard Webhooks makes it possible for verification to be implemented directly in the API gateway, easily solving verification for consumers.</li>
<li>Having a set of libraries for signing and verification make webhook verification easier for scenarios where API gateways can't be used.</li>
<li>Workflow automation tools (such as Zapier, Make, Workato, and tray.io) can implement the signature verification themselves to ensure a secure integration and save the need for integration builders to reinvent the wheel every time.</li>
<li>Standard Webhooks will enable building tools to automatically generate SDK for webhook consumers that in addition to verifying the signature can also validate the schemas (using JSON Schema, OpenAPI or AsyncAPI definitions).</li>
<li>Many more...</li>
</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Related efforts</h2>
<p dir="auto">There are a few complementary or partially overlapping efforts to standardize asynchronous event communication. This specification is compatible with the rest of them, and can either reuse existing efforts or benefit further from collaboration with them. The most notable of such efforts are:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><a href="https://www.openapis.org/" rel="nofollow">OpenAPI</a></li>

<!--*The Future of Data Evolution.* or *Mastering convergent evolution*.-->
<p>Hey there 👋, this is the start of a book about <em>Data Engineering Design Patterns</em>.</p>
<h2 id="about-this-book"><a href="#about-this-book">About This Book</a></h2>
<p>This book is different from usual books. It does <strong>not come finished</strong>. I will steadily release new chapters of the book, carefully listen to all your feedback, and integrate them to create a (hopefully) great book at the end of the day. Keep an eye on the <a href="https://www.dedp.online/appendix/changelog.html">changelog</a> for the latest updates, or sign up for the below <a href="https://list.ssp.sh/subscription/form">newsletter</a>.</p>

<p>I love writing. I love editing text. After writing for about 8+ years on my personal blog, and even doing it professionally for a year, I love the challenge that my former boss, Swyx confronted me, to put my 20+ years of experience in data engineering into a book. And, as I love long formats, a book might just be the best format to bring it all together in one.</p>
<p>Over my 20+ year career, I've witnessed an endless cycle of emerging terms and technologies.  This pattern led me to ponder: are we merely repackaging old ideas in new terminology?</p>
<p>That's when I found the term the intriguing concept: <strong>convergent evolution</strong>. This term, new to me at first, resonated deeply with my experiences in the data field, where often new terms are introduced every wee. Over time, I learned that what seemed new was simply a repurposed concept from a decade ago, now labeled with a new name. </p>
<p>Occasionally, these were existing technologies, subtly enhanced. Yet, true innovation seemed rare. This is where the idea of convergent evolution becomes pivotal. </p>
<p>Convergent evolution is when the outcome of two distinct evolutions is the same. The most famous one is <em>flying</em>. Both a bird and a bee can fly but in different ways. The bird has developed feathers, and a bee has an exoskeleton, which was learned and developed to fly in a different evolution.</p>
<p>This pattern of convergent evolution in data engineering captivated me, inspiring this book. My goal is to dissect these evolutionary paths, uncovering their unique strengths and weaknesses. By doing so, I aim to identify universal design patterns applicable across the spectrum of data engineering. Join me as we explore the essence of convergent evolution, its relevance in our field, and how it can guide us through the Data Engineering Lifecycle, enriching our understanding and practice.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, in the tech sector, just like many other sectors, there are scammers around. When you are dealing with electronics this is typically in the form of chips that have had their markings changed, usually to make them appear as if they are a more expensive chip. This has happened to me, so I’ll talk a bit about it.</p>



<p>As part of my work <a href="https://linuxjedi.co.uk/tag/atom/">restoring the Acorn Atom</a>, I replaced the 6502 CPU with a much lower power CMOS variant made by Rockwell, the R65C02. But something was bugging me. In my tests, I didn’t notice any power drop between that and the original CPU.</p>



<p>You see, the original 6502 used an NMOS process which is typically much more power hungry than CMOS. On top of this, the R65C02 was made using a smaller fabrication size. These things combined means that in-theory it should draw an order of magnitude less power. The R65C02 has an extended instruction set, so it is usually easy to identify.</p>



<p>This is the chip I bought.</p>

<p>What initially bugged me is that the printing was far too bright compared to pretty much any chip I’ve worked with. Something just seemed “off” about the printing too, but I couldn’t put my finger on it.</p>



<h2>Testing</h2>



<p>As with all things tech I’m not sure about, I start testing them. First of all I tried the acetone test. You see, the printing used on genuine ICs is designed to withstand the harsh cleaning chemicals used during manufacturing. Whereas chips that have had their markings changed typically use a cheaper painting process, which can often be removed with acetone. Straight away some of the printing starting coming off on the acetone soaked cotton bud I used. It looked pretty smeared and faded after a few seconds.</p>

<p>Next up was a logical test. My <a href="https://store.backbit.io/product/chip-tester/">BackBit Chip Tester Pro v2</a> can not only test the function of a 6502 CPU, but also tell you which variant it is (even detecting an Atari Sally variant). I bunged it in and hit the test button.</p>

<p>That explains a few things, this is really a standard NMOS 6502, not a 65C02.</p>



<h2>Other Signs</h2>



<p>There is one other sign I found out later which proves that this is not a genuine chip, the date code. You can see that it says 0032, this means the 32nd week of the year 2000. The problem with that is in 1999 the semiconductor division of Rockwell split out into a company called Conexant. When this happened, any chips manufactured suddenly switched to the Conexant branding, which is a completely different logo.</p>



<p>In addition, I believe, based on web searches, that the wafer ID for an R65C02 is 11450, not 11473 as marked here.</p>



<p>This was annoying because the seller is based in the UK and claims you should buy from them because you take your chances buying from China.</p>



<h2>Another Chip</h2>



<p>Once I figured out my chip was fake, and before I realised the date code issue, I bought another one from a different seller.</p>

<p>The printing looked a bit better on this one at least, but 30th week of 2015? I very much doubt it. I can’t find evidence of any being manufactured after the early 2000s. Let’s whack it on the tester…</p>

<p>That’s more like it, this is at least a R65C02 CPU. My best guess is the speed grade is the issue. The ‘3’ on the end means that it is rated to run at 3MHz, it is likely really just a 2 or 1MHz chip that has been marked up to give it a higher value. This is good enough for me as the Atom will only run it at 1MHz.</p>



<h2>Physical Comparison</h2>



<p>Here are the two chips claiming to be 65C02s together with an original 6502. Normally I would expect there to be printing on the bottom as well as the top.</p>

<p>On the bottom of the middle chip is what appears to be logographic characters. I do not know what these represent, or even if I have them the right way around. <strong>Update</strong>: see the end of this post for the translation the community figured out.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>This is quite a wide spread problem, and it is difficult to find genuine old parts when even UK sellers are selling parts that are not as they are marked.</p>



<p>If, like me, you are not pushing them to their designed limits, that may be OK. But sometimes it really isn’t, and sometimes the chip is nothing like what is shown on the markings, leading to potential physical damage to the machine it is used in.</p>



<p>As a side note, I have designed a prototype board that allows use of a brand new 65C02 IC made by Western Design Center in retro machines. The Western Design Center chips have a slightly different pinout to the others, so need a slight conversion. PCBs for this are coming soon.</p>



<h2>Update 2023-12-07</h2>



<p>This <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38557246">post got added to Hacker News</a> and was in the top 10 for a while. Thank you to whoever did that. In the comments the Chinese handwriting was discussed and it seems that a translation has been found.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>As a native speaker I think its “贤”, just rotated right by 90 degree.</p>
<cite>libreliu on Hacker News</cite></blockquote>



<p>It appears when translated this means “virtuous, worthy, good; able”, which I guess (and other people guess too) means that the chip functions, not that it is a genuine / virtuous chip.</p>



<p>Also thanks to those who commented with minor corrections on Hacker News.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Swedish Tesla employees have gone on strike, and unions in neighboring Denmark and Norway have joined boycotts of Elon Musk's electric automaker.</p>
<p>Danish union 3F and Norway's Fellesforbundet, the largest private-sector unions in their respective nations, both announced plans this week to get in Tesla's way.</p>
<p>3F, which covers multiple industries in Denmark, has limited its sympathy strike to its Transportation arm, which union chair Jan Villadsen explained will mean transportation workers at docks, including drivers, won't unload or transport Tesla vehicles bound for Sweden.</p>

    

<p>"Even though Elon Musk is one of the richest people in the world and owns Tesla, he can't just make his own rules," Villadsen <a href="https://www.facebook.com/jan.g.villadsen/posts/669001345216182" rel="nofollow">declared</a> on Tuesday when announcing 3F's action. "We have some agreements on the labor market in the Nordics, and you have to comply with them if you want to do business here."</p>

        


        

<p>Fellesforbundet leader Jørn Eggum echoed Villadsen's sentiments in a Wednesday <a href="https://www.fellesforbundet.no/aktuelt/nyheter/2023/varsler-tesla-boikott/" rel="nofollow">announcement</a> that his union will also launch a boycott aimed at stopping the transportation of Teslas into Sweden.</p>
<p>"In the Nordic countries, there is broad agreement about the importance of a well-organized working life," Eggum noted. "The right to demand a collective agreement is a natural part of [that], and we cannot accept that Tesla stands outside this."</p>

        

<p>3F and Fellesforbundet's sympathy strikes will begin on December 19 and December 20, respectively, if a collective agreement between Tesla and employees represented by Swedish automotive worker union IF Metall isn't in place.</p>
<p>IF Metall workers in Sweden – where Tesla doesn't manufacture vehicles but has a number of repair and service shops – have been <a href="https://www.ifmetall.se/aktuellt/tesla/" rel="nofollow">on strike</a> since October after what they described as years of Tesla refusing to bargain with the union. IF Metall-represented employees claim Tesla hasn't guaranteed them good wages, a pension or insurance.</p>

</ul>
<p>Tesla has long refused to bargain with unions, with CEO Elon Musk recently <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/30/musk_murders_x/">opining</a> that he disagrees with the entire concept of organized labor, as you can see below.</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sctgA2qa-rA" data-media="x-videoplayer">Youtube Video</a>
</p>
<p>"I just don't like anything which creates a lords and peasants sort of thing," the world's richest man told the <em>New York Times</em> DealBook Summit. "I think the unions naturally try to create negativity in a company." He added "If Tesla gets unionized it will be because we deserved it, and because we failed in some way."</p>

        

<p>Unions across Sweden have <a href="https://www.ifmetall.se/aktuellt/tesla/darfor-tvingas-if-metall-att-strejka/sympatiatgarder-fran-andra-fackforbund/" rel="nofollow">banded together</a> to cripple Tesla. Swedish port workers have pledged to block imports, electricians have refused to work on damaged Tesla chargers or at the vehicle builder's facilities, painters and builders have declined to work for Elon's products and properties.</p>
<p>Postal workers even decided not to deliver mail to the electric automaker, including license plates – an action that Musk called "<a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1727564977869844865?s=20" rel="nofollow">insane</a>". The local court has since <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/27/tesla_sweden_strike_lawsuit/">put a stop</a> to that action.</p>
<p>It's unknown whether Tesla plans to take further action to stop the strikes, or whether it'll cut its losses and bargain with employees – we asked, but didn't hear back. ®</p>

<p>One of the less obvious features of the <a href="https://electrek.co/guides/tesla-cybertruck/">Tesla Cybertruck</a> is its vehicle voltage architecture. The Cybertruck is the first EV from the automaker to use a 48-Volt (48V) electrical system implementation throughout the entire vehicle, as compared to the 12V systems that are used in pretty much every other vehicle on the planet. Today, Tesla shared its 48V implementation documentation with other major automakers — including competitors like Ford.</p>







<p>Ford’s own CEO Jim Farley confirmed the news on X, formerly Twitter, last night.</p>

<p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk also chimed in.</p>

<p>The consequences of Tesla’s actions won’t be immediately obvious in any other carmaker’s products, as they will likely take a long time to manifest into any real changes for the industry — if they do at all. But let’s take a step back.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-does-48v-architecture-matter">Why does 48V architecture matter?</h2>



<p>48V architecture is a huge deal not because it enables any particular feature or capability for any one car, but because it will lead to a step change in how automakers wire, accessorize, and electrically engineer their vehicles. </p>



<p>The first mass-produced vehicles generally used 6V architecture to power things like headlamps, and the industry broadly began to adopt 12V electrics in the 1950s. By the late 1960s, almost every car on sale in the US used 12V electrics — power windows, interior lighting, cigarette lighters, brake lights, ignition spark, batteries, and more all unified around this common voltage standard. This change was a big deal, because it meant that the <em>suppliers</em> who built a lot of these electrically-driven components could easily adapt their products to work with any car. Parts became yet more standardized (plus, more affordable and reliable), and eventually 12V became the universal standard for vehicle electrics.</p>



<p>The problems with 12V architecture, though, have been looming (pun intended) for years. Because of the low voltage of this architecture, delivering sufficient power to all vehicle systems that need electricity became more and more complex. And as cars integrated more and more electrical components over the years, this led to ruinously complicated vehicle wiring layouts. (I want to be clear: I am <em>vastly</em> oversimplifying the nature of the challenges of 12V architecture, and it should be obvious by now I’m not an electrical engineer. I probably shouldn’t be allowed to be too close to a wall outlet, frankly.)</p>



<p>Switching to 48V architecture alleviates a huge number of challenges automakers are facing with 12V. The biggest one, though, is complexity: You need <em>far</em> less complex wiring harnesses to power all your vehicle systems, because each wire can supply far more power and voltage in a 48V system. 48V architecture also potentially improves overall electrical efficiency for reasons that I am not sufficiently qualified to explain beyond a kindergarten level, meaning your car’s accessory systems may require less power overall to operate (quite important for an EV).</p>



<h2 id="h-12v-roadblocks-remain-despite-tesla-s-action">12V roadblocks remain despite Tesla’s action</h2>



<p>The challenge in adopting 48V architecture primarily lays in the vehicle supplier ecosystem, but that conclusion requires a bit of context setting.</p>



<p>If you cannot convert <em>all</em> of a vehicle’s systems to 48V architecture, the benefits of using such an architecture start to diminish pretty quickly in the form of introducing new complexities (i.e., a hybrid 48V / 12V vehicle architecture). As such, most automakers have clung to 12V because they know it and it <em>works</em>.</p>



<p>If an automaker decides to move to a 48V architecture, whatever car it builds must use 48V-ready accessories. But, suppliers aren’t incentivized to build such accessories without sufficient demand. While carmakers like Ford certainly have the power and scale to commission 48V parts independently, the per-unit cost of those components is likely to be substantially higher than their 12V equivalents — especially if they’re being produced in comparatively low volumes. And, many carmakers would be forced to make such a transition slowly over their entire vehicle lineup (it’s worth noting that ICE vehicles can use and would benefit greatly from 48V systems, too). And so, most carmakers stick with 12V. It’s a chicken-and-egg kind of issue.</p>







<p>To be frank, Tesla isn’t sharing its 48V architecture from the Cybertruck for purely altruistic reasons. Once you understand the conundrum around vehicle suppliers in the 12V world and making a transition to 48V, things start to come into greater focus. Tesla knows that transitioning to 48V is going to be <em>incredibly</em> difficult for legacy OEMs, and while there is potentially upside for Tesla in such a change (more on that in a moment), this is something of a PR move.</p>



<p>By publishing its 48V architecture, Tesla is saying “OK, we’ll show you how we did this thing — a thing you say is really complicated and difficult and would take years to replicate. You can just copy us.” But Tesla knows full well that even a powerful and well-resourced company like Ford can’t spin up a 48V accessory supply chain overnight, and that such a change would incur very substantial non-recurring engineering work (NRE, as it’s known in some industries).</p>



<p>For Tesla, though, there are theoretical benefits in the event the wider industry switches to 48V vehicle systems. The biggest one is the supply chain. The more components in the global vehicle supply chain that are designed for 48V vehicle systems, the lower the cost of those components will become over time — through volume, competitive engineering, and increased reliability. The second is a bit more nebulous, but arguably just as important: Engineers and other skilled workers in the industry will coalesce their work and knowledge around 48V systems, reducing the amount of redundant work happening and increasing the number of workers in the hiring pool who can understand and innovate on Tesla’s systems (and who can bring their knowledge to Tesla, barring any intellectual property infringement, of course).</p>



<h2 id="h-electrek-s-take">Electrek’s Take</h2>




	<p>It’s hard to see a downside to this move for anyone — for Tesla, the industry, or for the engineers designing the vehicle systems themselves. And it’s plain that the supplier ecosystem needs a kick in the pants to accelerate the transition to 48V, and that the benefits of such a transition are very substantial.</p>



<p>But it’s much harder to say how much of an impact Tesla’s decision to share its 48V design will actually have. Clearly, automakers are already incentivized to move to 48V, but doing so is challenging for a reason — it’s not just laziness. There are legitimate (if frustratingly financial and logistical) reasons that the 48V transition is moving along slowly.</p>



<p>It’s very possible that providing publicity around this relatively esoteric technical issue will be the greatest factor in instigating more aggressive work to implement 48V vehicle systems, as opposed to any technical know-how gleaned from Tesla’s documentation. </p>



<p>It should also be noted that Tesla has two distinct advantages in transitioning to 48V that legacy automakers do not. The first is being unusually vertically integrated in its approach to building vehicles — Tesla designs almost all of its own vehicle systems, even if they may be procured from third parties who actually manufacture them. The second is that Tesla doesn’t have many legacy vehicle designs to support or consider in deciding to transition electrical architectures. Put another way, Tesla’s focus on independent engineering and low legacy debt are huge reasons it can introduce a 48V vehicle while other auto OEMs continue to stick to 12V and likely will for years from now, even in their EVs. And simply telling other carmakers how it built a 48V system won’t change those realities overnight.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, Meta <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2023/12/meta-ai-updates/">released</a> a free standalone AI image-generator website, "<a href="https://imagine.meta.com/">Imagine with Meta AI</a>," based on its Emu image-synthesis model. Meta used 1.1 billion publicly visible Facebook and Instagram images to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/metas-new-ai-chatbot-trained-public-facebook-instagram-posts-2023-09-28/">train the AI model</a>, which can render a novel image from a written prompt. Previously, Meta's version of this technology—using the same data—was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/10/facebooks-new-ai-stickers-can-generate-mickey-mouse-holding-a-machine-gun/">only available</a> in messaging and social networking apps such as Instagram.</p>

<p>If you're on Facebook or Instagram, it's quite possible a picture of you (or that you took) helped train Emu. In a way, the <a href="https://bryanalexander.org/digital-literacy/you-are-the-product-one-interesting-source-for-the-meme/">old saying</a>, "If you're not paying for it, you are the product" has taken on a whole new meaning. Although, as of 2016, Instagram users uploaded over <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-instagram-users/instagrams-user-base-grows-to-more-than-500-million-idUSKCN0Z71LN/">95 million photos a day</a>, so the dataset Meta used to train its AI model was a small subset of its overall photo library.</p>
<p>Since Meta says it only uses publicly available photos for training, setting your photos private on Instagram or Facebook should prevent their inclusion in the company's future AI model training (unless it changes that policy, of course).</p>

<p>Similar to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/07/stable-diffusion-xl-puts-ai-generated-visual-worlds-at-your-gpus-command/">Stable Diffusion</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/from-toy-to-tool-dall-e-3-is-a-wake-up-call-for-visual-artists-and-the-rest-of-us/">DALL-E 3</a>, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/06/stunning-midjourney-update-wows-ai-artists-with-camera-like-feature/">Midjourney</a>, Imagine with Meta AI generates new images based on what the AI model "knows" about visual concepts learned from the training data. Creating images using the new website requires a Meta account, which can be imported from an existing Facebook or Instagram account. Each generation creates four 1280×1280 pixel images that can be saved in JPEG format. Images include a small "Imagined with AI" watermark logo in the lower left-hand corner.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>"We’ve enjoyed hearing from people about how they’re using imagine, Meta AI’s text-to-image generation feature, to make fun and creative content in chats," Meta says in its news release. "Today, we’re expanding access to imagine outside of chats, making it available in the US to start at imagine.meta.com. This standalone experience for creative hobbyists lets you create images with technology from Emu, our image foundation model."</p>

<p>We put Meta's new AI image generator through a battery of low-stakes informal tests using our "Barbarian with a CRT" and "Cat with a beer" image-synthesis protocol and found aesthetically novel results, as you can see above. (As an aside, when generating images of people with Emu, we noticed many looked like typical Instagram fashion posts.)</p>
<p>We also tried our hand at adversarial testing. The generator appears to filter out most violence, curse words, sexual topics, and the names of celebrities and historical figures (no Abraham Lincoln, sadly), but it allows commercial characters like Elmo (yes, even "<a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/10/facebooks-new-ai-stickers-can-generate-mickey-mouse-holding-a-machine-gun/">with a knife</a>") and Mickey Mouse (though not with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/10/facebooks-new-ai-stickers-can-generate-mickey-mouse-holding-a-machine-gun/">a machine gun</a>).</p>
<p>Meta's model generally creates photorealistic images well, but not as well as Midjourney. It can handle complex prompts better than Stable Diffusion XL, but perhaps not as well as DALL-E 3. It doesn't seem to do text rendering well at all, and it handles different media outputs like watercolors, embroidery, and pen-and-ink with mixed results. Its images of people seem to include diversity in ethnic backgrounds. Overall, it seems about average these days in terms of AI image synthesis.</p>

With it, we have the ability to converse with conversational AIs, generate realistic imagery, and accurately summarize large corpora of documents, all from simple prompts. With over 100 million downloads of Llama models to date, a lot of this innovation is being fueled by open models.</p><p>Collaboration on safety will build trust in the developers driving this new wave of innovation, and requires additional research and contributions on responsible AI. The people building AI systems can’t address the challenges of AI in a vacuum, which is why we want to level the playing field and create a center of mass for open trust and safety.</p><p>Today, we are announcing the launch of Purple Llama — an umbrella project that, over time, will bring together tools and evaluations to help the community build responsibly with open generative AI models. The initial release will include tools and evaluations for cybersecurity and input/output safeguards, with more tools to come in the near future.</p><p>Components within the Purple Llama project will be licensed permissively, enabling both research and commercial usage.

With this initial release, we aim to provide tools that will help address some risks outlined in the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/07/21/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-secures-voluntary-commitments-from-leading-artificial-intelligence-companies-to-manage-the-risks-posed-by-ai/" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie">White House commitments on developing responsible AI</a>, including:</p><ul><li>Metrics for quantifying LLM cybersecurity risks.</li><li>Tools to evaluate the frequency of insecure code suggestions.</li><li>Tools to evaluate LLMs to make it harder to generate malicious code or aid in carrying out cyberattacks.</li></ul><p>We believe these tools will reduce the frequency of LLMs suggesting insecure AI-generated code and reduce their helpfulness to cyber adversaries. Our initial results show that there are meaningful cybersecurity risks for LLMs, both with recommending insecure code and for complying with malicious requests.

This model has been trained on a mix of publicly-available datasets to enable detection of common types of potentially risky or violating content that may be relevant to a number of developer use cases.

		    <h3><strong>Investors smell the money, billions are flowing, even in the US, which could become major lithium producer.</strong></h3>
<h4>By&nbsp;<a href="https://wolfstreet.com/author/wolf-richter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wolf Richter</a>&nbsp;for&nbsp;<a href="https://wolfstreet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WOLF STREET</a>.</h4>
<p>Who needs fundamentals when you have rampant speculation? And then you can make up a story that fits the speculative narrative, and everyone will jump in, and you’re off to the races. That’s what commodities are all about from time to time. They’re so much fun.</p>
<p>The spot price of battery-grade lithium carbonate, trading in Shanghai and serving as a benchmark, dropped today to CNY 133,500 per tonne, down 77% from the peak a year ago, and below where it had been in 2017.</p>
<p>It had spiked by 1,410% from CNY 39,500 per tonne in August 2020 to CNY 600,000 in November 2022, multiplying by 15 in about 27 months, <em>WHOOSH</em>. The narrative to support the speculative craze was, you guessed it, lithium shortage. But high prices brought lots of new production online. The best cure for high prices is high prices. And soon the new and improved narrative was that there was a lithium glut. And today roughly completes the first full year of a most spectacular collapse in prices.</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://wolfstreet.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/US-lithium-carbonate-2023-11-23.png" alt="" width="784" height="581" srcset="https://wolfstreet.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/US-lithium-carbonate-2023-11-23.png 784w, https://wolfstreet.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/US-lithium-carbonate-2023-11-23-560x415.png 560w, https://wolfstreet.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/US-lithium-carbonate-2023-11-23-768x569.png 768w, https://wolfstreet.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/US-lithium-carbonate-2023-11-23-260x193.png 260w, https://wolfstreet.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/US-lithium-carbonate-2023-11-23-160x119.png 160w" sizes="(max-width: 784px) 100vw, 784px"></p>
<p>We already had a lithium bubble followed by an implosion a few years ago: The prior lithium bubble peaked in 2017, at CNY 175,000, and imploded over the next three years, with the price dropping 77% to CNY 39,500 by August 2020.</p>
<p>Inevitably, when you have so much fun, something even more fun happens: A startup company, Stardust Power, announced on November 21 that it would go public – and you also guessed this – via merger with a SPAC. With the money it expects to raise in the SPAC merger, it will build its first lithium refinery. It already picked out a “shovel-ready” location near Tulsa, OK, to build the lithium refinery and then to supply the EV battery industry.</p>
<p>This Stardust Power announcement comes after the stocks of EV SPACs and a bunch of other companies that had gone public via merger with a SPAC have totally collapsed and entered my pantheon of <a href="https://wolfstreet.com/category/all/imploded-stocks/">Imploded Stocks</a>. So good luck.</p>
<p>Obviously, there is a lot of demand for battery-grade lithium to go into the batteries for the global EV production boom, and thankfully, lithium is abundant around the world and in the US.</p>
<p>In September, we were treated to this headline: “Lithium deposit found in US may be among world’s largest, study finds.” The area is in Nevada. But in the US, permitting issues, local opposition, legal challenges, and costs don’t exactly make starting up lithium production a cakewalk.</p>
<p>Then there is the long-running Lithium Nevada’s $2.3 billion project, which, after overcoming a host of issues, including legal challenges from tribes, is now on schedule to begin production in late 2026 at what could be one of the largest lithium mines in the world.</p>
<p>The big kahuna of the oil-and-gas industry, Exxon Mobil, announced earlier in November that it plans to produce lithium from briny water pumped up from about 10,000 feet in the Smackover Formation in Arkansas. Production is expected to start by 2027 and will eventually supply lithium for well over 1 million EVs per year, according to Reuters. It cited analysts at TD Cowen that estimated this would require Exxon Mobil to invest $2 billion. So that’s going to be good for the economy.</p>
<p>Lithium production at the Salton Sea in California has been kicked around for years. The area has been dubbed Lithium Valley due to its lithium-rich geothermal activity. Three companies are now working on projects using a new technology of extraction that is still largely unproven at scale. Two of the three – BHE Renewables and EnergySource Minerals – own and operate geothermal powerplants in the area, and that’s a pretty good fit. So we’ll see.</p>
<p>All kinds of lithium production projects are being worked on in the US and around the world. Currently, Australia, Chile, and China dominate lithium production. Australia alone accounts for nearly half the global production. The three combined account for about 90% of global production. Everyone is now trying to get in on it. Investors have smelled the money, and the billions are flowing.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    	  
<p>Today, Plogue is launching chipsynth C64, an AAX/AU/VST3/CLAP plug-in recreation of the Commodore 64/128 and its legendary 1982 SID chip (and successors). No one else could create an emulation this obsessive. After just a few minutes with it, it feels like encountering an entirely new instrument that fell straight out of a past decade. It’s likely to enchant both nostalgic C64 fans and those discovering chip music for the first time. </p>



<p>Launch trailer:</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>To celebrate, there’s also a C64 demo running on the real PAL machine (not in software) created by 4mat. (Capture details in the description.)</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="chipsynth C64 launch demo (PAL C64C capture)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L3giAyHME1s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>And here’s what went into the recreation: endless measurements of the chips, gigs and gigs of measurement data used in research (the plug-in itself is all modeled and just 30MB), and mind-boggling attention to voltages and variations:</p>

</p></figure>



<p>If you want to play around with this as “just another” software synth, you absolutely can. The tool has a friendly interface, tons of support for MIDI (including MTS-ESP and Scala tuning support), and a bunch of fantastic-sounding presets. It really does hold up <em>as a synthesizer</em>, not just an esoteric instrument because you want to make “chiptune.” And the presets reflect that; they’re musically voiced and playable and I can easily imagine these popping up in various genres. You even get presets designed by chip musicians like Goto80, Fade Runner, Ne7, Xenos Soundworks, and 4-Mat. </p>

<p>That’s true to the history of the MOS Technology SID, the chip developed by engineer Bob Yannes (who went on to found Ensoniq). By building a complete, high-quality instrument into an integrated chip, complete with features like envelope generators, precision control, ring modulation, and programmable filters, the SID easily deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as other digital synths of the 80s.</p>

<p>But when we talk about minute variations, well, it’s easiest just to show you the menu. We’re not just talking about the 6581 and the later 8580 (from the 64-II and metal C128), or even that, plus a few revisions. We’re talking about every single variation you can think of. From just the chip menu:</p>



<p>That includes this main menu with different chips and revisions – already more exhaustive than what you’ll find on most wiki pages on the SID:</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdm.link/app/uploads/2023/12/CleanShot-2023-12-06-at-18.10.05@2x.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="342" height="1024" src="https://cdm.link/app/uploads/2023/12/CleanShot-2023-12-06-at-18.10.05@2x-342x1024.png" alt="" srcset="https://cdm.link/app/uploads/2023/12/CleanShot-2023-12-06-at-18.10.05@2x-342x1024.png 342w, https://cdm.link/app/uploads/2023/12/CleanShot-2023-12-06-at-18.10.05@2x-513x1536.png 513w, https://cdm.link/app/uploads/2023/12/CleanShot-2023-12-06-at-18.10.05@2x-100x300.png 100w, https://cdm.link/app/uploads/2023/12/CleanShot-2023-12-06-at-18.10.05@2x.png 670w" sizes="(max-width: 342px) 100vw, 342px"></a></figure>



<p>Plus, from the underside of the chips, aliases and details showing where the chips were fabbed and even on which day. David tells CDM that they have a few duplicate chips from the same fab and day “and they <em>don’t</em> sound the same.”</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdm.link/app/uploads/2023/12/CleanShot-2023-12-06-at-17.06.41@2x.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="389" height="1024" src="https://cdm.link/app/uploads/2023/12/CleanShot-2023-12-06-at-17.06.41@2x-389x1024.png" alt="" srcset="https://cdm.link/app/uploads/2023/12/CleanShot-2023-12-06-at-17.06.41@2x-389x1024.png 389w, https://cdm.link/app/uploads/2023/12/CleanShot-2023-12-06-at-17.06.41@2x-584x1536.png 584w, https://cdm.link/app/uploads/2023/12/CleanShot-2023-12-06-at-17.06.41@2x-114x300.png 114w, https://cdm.link/app/uploads/2023/12/CleanShot-2023-12-06-at-17.06.41@2x.png 755w" sizes="(max-width: 389px) 100vw, 389px"></a></figure>



<p>And then there are banks of new waveforms to use in place of the originals, for even more sonic variation:</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdm.link/app/uploads/2023/12/CleanShot-2023-12-06-at-17.07.05@2x.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="432" height="1024" src="https://cdm.link/app/uploads/2023/12/CleanShot-2023-12-06-at-17.07.05@2x-432x1024.png" alt="" srcset="https://cdm.link/app/uploads/2023/12/CleanShot-2023-12-06-at-17.07.05@2x-432x1024.png 432w, https://cdm.link/app/uploads/2023/12/CleanShot-2023-12-06-at-17.07.05@2x-127x300.png 127w, https://cdm.link/app/uploads/2023/12/CleanShot-2023-12-06-at-17.07.05@2x.png 742w" sizes="(max-width: 432px) 100vw, 432px"></a></figure>



<p>Anything you can do to hack a C64 chip with code or circuits, essentially, you can do here easily with a GUI. It’s a rabbit hole to end rabbit holes.</p>



<p>Features:</p>

Bradford DeLong (2022). This is a narrative economic history of the 20th century. It heavily focuses on the interaction between policy and economic thought.</p><p>"Lost Continents" by L. Sprague de Camp (1954). This book looks at Atlantis and other lost continents as rhetorical devices in ancient history and philosophy, 20th century pseudoscience/pseudohistory, and science fiction.

Tress is just such a fun adventure and Yumi left me an emotional wreck by the end.</p><p>"There Is No Antimemetics Division" - I had a brief period where I wanted to read some stories about clandestine operations around odd anomalies, SCP-adjacent if you will. This, alongside "Agents of Dreamland", is rather short and great for getting through in a couple sittings. It's all about taking on an entity that you actively can't remember the existence of.</p><p>Non-Fiction:</p><p>"Letters to a Young Poet" - This is a collection of ten letters sent from the poet Rainer Maria Rilke to a younger aspiring poet in the early 1900s. As a creative that sometimes struggles with the whole "what am I doing this for?", I found this a highly inspiring and comforting read.</p><p>"On Writing" - I'm sure most of you know the book, or at the least know Stephen King. The info in here on writing (at least in the style of King) is fantastic, but I think the memoir portions are the killer part of this book. The man certainly has a storied past, for better or worse.

Still my favorite series of all time. This took up a pretty big chunk of the year, so most other books were rather light urban fantasy novels.<p>But one other mini-series stood out (potentially going to be a trilogy, but both #1 &amp; #2 can stand alone).</p><p>Teixcalaan #1 &amp; #2, "A Memory Called Empire" and "A Desolation Called Peace" by Arkady Martine for being very different feeling sci-fi books that are not your typical western-centric fare. Highlights are the language, and that the story feels both very small and contained, and also all-encompassing, at the same time.

The universe is incredibly deep, the characters are incredibly rich, but I do wish Erikson would let us get a little bit comfier in the shoes of each character for longer stretches of time. I sailed through House of Chains so quickly because I didn't have perspective whiplash, but I find it difficult to keep all of the characters in my head during some sections -- battles in particular are a real challenge for me in the Malazan series.<p>Highly recommend the series, but a warning: if you find yourself bouncing off book one, don't bother with the rest of the series. I find that the later books are slightly better written and slightly better structured, but the core writing style issues are still there (notably, perspective whiplash and a magic system that is so complex that it sometimes feels like deux ex machina).

A bit of a pop-sci read on the subject that's very approachable. Most chapters are &lt;10 pages. Dettmer manages to distill information very effectively though, he paints a fascinating picture of the complicated machinations of the human immune system.

And, of course, well written.<p>4,000 Weeks: Time Management for Mortals by Oliver Burke - deconstructs the hustle/productivity mindset and rejects it in favor of an existential view of accepting your finitude and prioritizing accordingly. I wouldn’t say the book changed my mind but reassured some of my feelings and put some words to why trying to pursue too many goals or experiences typically fails or is unfulfilling. Sort of ironically takes its main point a little too far by the end in my opinion but I recommend it anyway, it’s pretty short.</p><p>Cadillac Desert by Marc Reisner - still in progress but clearly a great book so far. I recommend it to anyone living in western US/MX.

If you want real cutting-edge Schizophrenia research it's best left to those on the front line in hospitals and Ivory Towers. Not armchair yahoos like Sapolsky who get a laugh off the backs of people suffering. He's done a great disservice to those who are afflicted with Schizophrenia. Much better than his rambling lecture is a TED talk given by Bethany Yeiser. Let's put a human face on Schizophrenia, shouldn't we?</span></p></div></td></tr>

If so, I particularly enjoyed 戦国小町苦労端 (Sengoku Komachi Kurou Tan, Story of the Hardships of a Beauty in the Warring States Period), the story of a girl who likes history and agriculture being sent back in time and meeting Oda Nobunaga, who assigns her the task of making a failing village produce enough crops. I find its portrayal of Nobunaga interesting, making him about as likeable as you could expect a 16th century warlord to be.</span></p></div></td></tr>

Also really enjoy how each part of the series (Hyperion, then Fall of Hyperion, then the Endymion books) re-invent the style and the story.</p><p>- The Annotated American Gods (Gaiman, Klinger): 1000’s of footnotes is a great way to revisit the story :)

This sounds like a good way to do it.

On the one hand - it can feel like a lazy rewriting of history to suit later stories, but I think it actually works super well because you pretty much have to re-evaluate the entire story multiple times.

Great retelling of the history of one of the great medieval South Indian kingdoms. Not his best, but his writing is still top notch.</p><p>Sea of Tranquility- speculative fiction from Emily St. John Mandel (of Station Eleven fame). It's a series of interconnected stories spanning centuries from the near past to the near future. Beautifully written. Read when I was down with COVID earlier this year and it invaded my dreams (in a good way). Short and easy read.</p><p>Giovanni's Room- story of an American expat in Paris caught between his love for a man and his duty to his girlfriend. This is the first James Baldwin book I have read but will definitely check out more of his work in 2024.</p><p>Theory of Bastards- speculative fiction by Audrey Schulmann. Literary sci-fi similar to Station Eleven. It's about a woman researching primate behavior set in the near future where the earth is ravaged by the effects of climate change. Very well researched, beautifully written and nothing like I have ever read before. This won the 2019 Philip K Dick Award.</p><p>Invisible Cities- literary fiction by Italo Calvino. It's less than 200 pages but a very dense and tough read. It's a conversation between Marco Polo and Kublai Khan where MP is describing cities in KK's vast empire. It's a strange, strange book that I think I will return to often. If you liked the world building in Piranesi and want more, this is the book for you. Calvino describes 55 cities in under 200 pages, with each one feeling very different. Again, first Calvino book I have read and will definitely check out more of his works in 2024.</p><p>Non-fiction:</p><p>Thinking in Systems: A Primer- by Donella Meadows. Read this based on HN's recommendation. Thank you!</p><p>On Intelligence- by Jeff Hawkins. This was on my shelf for years and am glad I got to read it this year. The creator of the Palm Pilot presents his theory of intelligence and how the brain works. It's compelling. I hope to read his follow up book in 2024. Would love HN's recommendations of similar books.</p><p>A Primate's Memoir- by Robert M. Sapolsky. Enjoyable read of the author's research on Savannah baboons and his adventures in Africa. His love for primates and humans alike come through clearly.</p><p>Build: An Unorthodox Guide to Making Things Worth Making- by Tony Fadell. A great business book by the co-founder of Nest. Draws on his experience both as a startup founder and leading innovative teams at large tech companies (Apple, in his case). Just as any business book, this could have been shorter and less repetitive but thankfully, there is enough good material here to be a book rather than a blog post.

Super funny, super sharp, super bitchy, reading her 2nd book now</p><p>Walking Through Clear Water in a Pool Painted Black by Cookie Mueller, if you like Nan Golden or John Waters you know who Cookie is, a really fun and crazy ride, made me wish I was best friends with Cookie.</p><p>Black Friend by Ziwe Fumudoh, if you like Ziwe, then obvi. An interesting mini memoir, has some of the bite of her talk show but pulls back the mask and makes you realize how damn brilliant she is, really interesting refection of the experience of a 2nd generation Nigerian</p><p>I Was Better Last Night by Harvey Firestein, a fun look back at the alt theater scene in NYC, still listening on audible, he has the best voice ever, something that is a must listen</p><p>Feeding the Soul (Because it’s my business) by Tabitha Brown, if you fell in love with Tab’s vegan soul during the pandemic like me this audio book was like a warm hug from a super nice auntie. I don’t share a lot of the same beliefs as her, but it was interesting look at one person’s faith and how it made them the person they are</p><p>The Fuck Up by Arthur Nersesian, if you ever dreamed of living in the East Village in the 1980s this book was great, paints a lively picture of NYC at that time</p><p>The New Animals by Pip Adams, a kiwi fashion scene slice of life, like if Virgina Wolf had written Bret Easton Ellis' Glamorama. Some interesting musings on social media and it's place in the fashion world</p><p>Glamorama by Bret Easton Ellis, re-read after 20 years, really appreciated the non stop references, if you want to live in the late 90s fashion world for a bit it’s a great book</p><p>I Am Not Ashamed by Barbara Payton, old hollywood starlet who ended her life broke and addicted, an interesting look at the dark side of the old studio system and the seedier parts of Los Angeles. Picked up at Mast Books in the East Village (along with a few others on this list), highly recommend the book store, great selection of artsy fartsy stuff</p><p>The Shards by Bret Easton Ellis, didn’t finish it, mostly because it’s massive and I never could bring myself to pack it, intend to finish to next year, but if you like his other books, especially less than 0, it’s worth reading.

Was not expecting this book to hit so hard. I cried more times reading this than anything else this year. If you grew up gay in the 1900s, it's a really powerful reminder of how vital accurate and compassionate representation is. Made me realize how much things have changed for the better, really made me appreciate being alive today.</p><p>The Art Thief by Michael Finkel, really romantic crime non fiction about a prolific art thief, his girfriend, his family, extremely cinematic, would be shocked if it's not made into a movie very soon</p><p>Paris by Paris Hilton, a really dark look at the troubled teen industry, made me really respect Paris Hilton as a cultural engineer (she was mostly in on the joke) and abuse survivor. Also, a really dark look at revenge porn, consent, and technology in the aughts</p><p>Mean Baby by Selma Blair, really enjoyed the parts about her childhood, a very specific look at the Jewish Detroit suburbs at the last quarter of the 20th century</p><p>Unprotected by Billy Porter, if you watched Pose, and wanted to know more about the actor that brought Pray Tell to life . A memoir about demanding your place in the world</p><p>Spinning Plates by Sophie Ellis Bextor, read at the start of the year, but love that with Saltburn coming out “Murder on the Dancefloor” is everywhere again. Loved the early parts of the book and the britt pop teenage stories, the obvious music career throughout, and then interesting look at motherhood. She’s so charming, smart and talented, I’ve always wondered why she wasn’t as big as the other pop stars of her era but her podcast Spinning Plates is also great, and most recent album Hana is a charming love letter to japan.</p><p>Pageboy by Elliot Page, really made me want to go Nova Scotia, feels like a long late night conversation on a porch chain smoking cigarettes in college while a party is going on inside but the conversation is more compelling</p><p>When We Cease To Understand The World by Benjamín Labatut, suggested to me in last years version of this, really beautiful and thoughtful, lots of very specific truths in a fictional history</p><p>I’m Glad My Mom Died by Jenette McCurdy, a look back at being a child star,  written as if it’s all happening in the present, interesting reflections on Mormonism and Nickelodeon</p><p>Atomic Habits, nothing earth shattering but a pleasant, picked up a few things from it i started doing day to day that increased my quality of life</p><p>Friends, Lovers, and The Big Terrible Thing by Matthew Perry, a really dark look at what addiction combined with fame does to a person, didn't enjoy reading it, but when Matthew Perry died I was glad I had.</p><p>The Woman in Me (Le Femme en Moi), currently enjoying this as an audio book in French, if you're learning another language and love pop culture, the vocab is simple, being able to slow down the speed on audible is really nice.

<ul>
<li>A US senator has asked the Department of Justice to let Apple and Google disclose how governments surveil users through push notifications.</li>
<li>Apple says the federal government stopped it from being transparent about the practice.</li>
<li>Google has also acknowledged the senator’s plea and said it is committed to keeping users informed about government requests for push notification data.</li>
</ul>
</div><p>Government agencies have been spying on smartphone users through push notifications sent out by apps, a US senator <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24191267-wyden_smartphone_push_notification_surveillance_letter_to_doj_-_signed" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote in a letter</a> to the Department of Justice on December 6.</p><p>Oregon Senator Ron Wyden has asked the Department of Justice to lift any existing restrictions around discussions of push notification surveillance.</p><p>“I write to urge the Department of Justice (DOJ) to permit Apple and Google to inform their customers and the general public about demands for smartphone app notification records,” Wyden writes in the letter.</p><p>He explains that push notifications pass through a kind of digital post office run by the phone’s operating system providers. “Because Apple and Google deliver push notification data, they can be secretly compelled by governments to hand over this information,” the letter says. This could tell governments how users interact with certain apps, give them access to a notification’s complete text, and disclose some unencrypted content.</p><p>Wyden moved the DOJ to allow Apple and Google to be transparent about the demands they receive from governments regarding push notification surveillance.</p><p>Meanwhile, the two companies welcomed Wyden’s letter and acknowledged that push notification surveillance has been happening for a while. Apple even said it was not allowed to disclose government requests for push notification data but will start informing users about it now.</p><p>“In this case, the federal government prohibited us from sharing any information,” Apple said in a statement published by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/cybersecurity/governments-spying-apple-google-users-through-push-notifications-us-senator-2023-12-06/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Reuters</em></a>. “Now that this method has become public, we are updating our transparency reporting to detail these kinds of requests.”</p><p>Google also acknowledged the issue and said it shared Wyden’s “commitment to keeping users informed about these requests.” Google’s transparency report already documents governmental requests for users’ push notification data.</p></div></div>]]></description>

      <p><em>This post takes inspiration from <a href="https://anthonyhobday.com/sideprojects/saferules">Visual design rules you can safely follow every time</a> by Anthony Hobday.</em></p>

<p>Here, we’re talking about performance rules you can safely follow every time. As with any rules, you are free to break them. You may need a good reason to do so.</p>

<p>We are covering some best practices for HTTP, Ruby, and the database layers so that most applications with decent traffic can improve their response time.
Some of these practices can be obvious to experienced developers. Your applications are on good Rails if you already know and use them all.</p>

<p>Serve all resources from a CDN. It will reduce latency for your visitors and the number of requests to your server. What’s more, CDNs provide more bandwidth than your servers.</p>

<p>CDNs aren’t expensive, and their rates are very progressive. They are also simple to set:</p>

<pre><code>config.action_controller.asset_host = "cdn.application.example"
</code></pre>

<p>We can’t think of any good reason to do without them except for an application running solely on a private network.</p>

<h3>Enable HTTP compression</h3>

<p>Compression saves bandwidth at a modest CPU cost.
Most web servers, like  <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_deflate.html">Apache</a> and <a href="https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_gzip_module.html">Nginx</a>, enable compression by default.
To be sure, verify the presence of <code>Content-Encoding: gzip</code> in the response headers.</p>

<h3>Enable HTTP cache</h3>

<p>A cached resource means one less request for the client and server and, therefore, a faster loading time.<br>
It goes without saying that caching should be enabled for all resources passing through the CDN.</p>

<p>The Cache-Control header gives instructions to browsers and CDNs.
Check that you have a header in the response that looks like this <code>Cache-Control "max-age=86400, public"</code>.
Max age is the duration in seconds, so 24 hours in this case.
It’s up to you to decide whether you need a more aggressive cache.</p>

<p>For private resources, turn off the cache with the <code>Cache-Control: private</code> header.</p>

<h3>Enable keep-alive connections</h3>

<p>Keep-alive connections are reusable.
They prevent having to re-establish a connection, as well as SSL negotiation.
They reduce latency time for all pages made up of several resources.</p>

<p>Web servers often activate them by default.
You can verify the presence of the following header <code>Keep-Alive timeout=5, max=100</code>.
In this example, the connection is closed after 5 seconds of inactivity and can be reused 100 times.</p>

<h2>Ruby</h2>

<h3>Run in the background as much as possible</h3>

<p>Any heavy or latency-intensive task should be run in the background as far as possible.
Sending e-mails is a case in point.<br>
It’s a relatively long task compared with the duration of an HTTP request.
Moreover, its duration is unpredictable since it requires a network connection.
On the other hand, there’s no obligation to send the e-mail during the HTTP request.
So, using the <code>deliver_later</code> method from Rails controllers is a good habit.</p>

<p>As well as reducing response time, it frees up a web process or thread to handle the subsequent request.
So the application can handle a larger volume.
It will also be less vulnerable to a denial-of-service attack.</p>

<h3>Know count, size, and length to save on SQL queries</h3>

<p>It’s important to know the differences between these three methods to ensure you’re triggering the fewest or most optimized SQL queries possible.</p>

<p>The <code>count</code> method always triggers a <code>SELECT count(*) FROM table</code> query.
The <code>length</code> method ensures that the relationship has been loaded to count in memory.
The <code>size</code> method adapts to the loading of the relationship.
Either it triggers a query if it hasn’t been loaded, or it counts in memory if it has already been loaded.
Here’s a summary table:</p>

<table><thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th>Records loaded</th>
<th>Record not loaded</th>
</tr>
</thead><tbody>
<tr>
<td>count</td>
<td>SELECT count(*) FROM table</td>
<td>SELECT count(*) FROM table</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>size</td>
<td>Count in memory</td>
<td>SELECT count(*) FROM table</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>length</td>
<td>Count in memory</td>
<td>SELECT * FROM table</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>When counting and enumerating, it’s important to call <code>size</code> after the relationship has been loaded.
In all cases, the aim is to trigger a single request.</p>

<pre><code># Bad 2 queries instead of 1
users = User.all
users.size # SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "users"
users.each { } # SELECT "users".* FROM "users"

# Good
users = User.all
users.length # SELECT "users".* FROM "users"
users.each { } # No queries

# Good
users = User.all
users.each { } # SELECT "users".* FROM "users"
users.size # No queries

# Good
users = User.all.load # SELECT "users".* FROM "users"
users.size # No queries
users.each { } # No queries

# Bad 2 queries instead of 1
users = User.all
users.each { } # SELECT "users".* FROM "users"
users.count # SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "users"
</code></pre>

<h3>Know exists, any/empty, and present/blank to save on SQL queries</h3>

<p>As with <code>count</code>, <code>size</code>, and <code>length</code>, it’s important to know the subtleties of these methods to trigger the fewest and most efficient queries possible.</p>

<p>The <code>exists?</code> method always triggers a query. It is optimized because it stops as soon as it finds a line.
The <code>present?</code> and <code>blank?</code> methods make sure that the query has been executed before checking for their presence or absence in memory.
Finally, the <code>any?</code> and <code>empty?</code> methods adapt if the relationship has already been loaded.
Here’s a summary table:</p>

<table><thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th>Loaded</th>
<th>Not loaded</th>
</tr>
</thead><tbody>
<tr>
<td>exists?</td>
<td>SELECT 1 FROM table LIMIT 1</td>
<td>SELECT 1 FROM table LIMIT 1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>any?/empty?</td>
<td>In memory</td>
<td>SELECT 1 FROM table LIMIT 1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>present?/blank?</td>
<td>In memory</td>
<td>SELECT * FROM table</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>In this way, we can deduce good and bad uses when we condition a display according to the presence of recordings.</p>

<pre><code># Bad 2 queries instead of 1
users = Users.all
if users.exists? # SELECT 1 FROM users LIMIT 1
  users.each { } # SELECT * FROM users
end

# Good
users = Users.all
if users.present? # SELECT * FROM users
  users.each { } # No queries
end

# Bad 2 queries instead of 1
users = Users.all
if users.any? # SELECT 1 FROM users LIMIT 1
  users.each { } # SELECT * FROM users
end

# Good
users = Users.all.load # SELECT * FROM users
if users.any? # No queries
  users.each { } # No queries
end
</code></pre>

<h3>Use pluck instead of loading ActiveRecord instances when possible</h3>

<p>Pluck allows you to retrieve the raw result of an SQL query and thus avoid creating ActiveRecord instances.
Since there are fewer things to do, it’s inevitably faster and less memory-hungry.
On the other hand, you no longer benefit from the full functionality of an ActiveRecord model.
So it’s a good idea to use it when you don’t need your model’s methods.
We’re thinking in particular of a CSV or text export of several thousand lines.</p>

<pre><code># Slow
CSV.generate do |csv|
  User.all.each { |user| csv &lt;&lt; [user.id, user.name, user.email] }
end

# Fast
CSV.generate do |csv|
  User.pluck(:id, :name, :email).each { |row| csv &lt;&lt; row }
end
</code></pre>

<p>When you need to retrieve a large number of records, try to find a solution with <code>pluck</code>.</p>

<h3>Use symbols or frozen string literals</h3>

<p>By default, Ruby creates a new instance for any string literal, but not for symbols.</p>

<pre><code>"Ruby".object_id #=&gt; 60
"Ruby".object_id #=&gt; 80
"Ruby".object_id #=&gt; 100

:ruby.object_id # =&gt; 710748
:ruby.object_id # =&gt; 710748
:ruby.object_id # =&gt; 710748
</code></pre>

<p>The same chain has been created three times, which is wasteful when the symbol has been reused.
So symbols are more efficient.
A comment at the beginning of each file tells Ruby to freeze and reuse literal strings.</p>

<pre><code># frozen_string_literal: true
"Ruby".object_id #=&gt; 60
"Ruby".object_id #=&gt; 60
"Ruby".object_id #=&gt; 60

:ruby.object_id # =&gt; 710748
:ruby.object_id # =&gt; 710748
:ruby.object_id # =&gt; 710748
</code></pre>

<p>However, the string can no longer be modified, as it has been frozen.
Passing a frozen string to a method you don’t control may result in a FrozenError exception.
You’ll need to duplicate it explicitly.</p>

<pre><code># frozen_string_literal: true
"Ruby".concat(" on Rails") # FrozenError: can't modify frozen String
"Ruby".dup.concat(" on Rails") # =&gt; "Ruby on Rails"
</code></pre>

<h3>Store function results in local variables if needed more than once</h3>

<p>Even if this sounds obvious, it’s not uncommon to read about this kind of code.</p>

<pre><code># Bad
if object.expensive_compute
  puts object.expensive_compute
end

# Good
if result = object.expensive_compute
  puts result
end
</code></pre>

<p>Even with relatively quick methods, it’s a shame to repeat them.</p>

<pre><code># Bad
puts array.first.method1
puts array.first.method2
puts array.first.method3

# Good
object = array.first
puts object.method1
puts object.method2
puts object.method3
</code></pre>

<p>This doesn’t make the code more complicated, and sometimes simplifies it a little.</p>

<h3>Reuse HTTP connections</h3>

<p>For the reasons explained in the <em>Enable keep-alive connections</em> section,
it’s more efficient to reuse the same HTTP connection to execute multiple requests.
Each time, you save the time needed to establish the connection, as well as the SSL negotiation.
This is a significant saving.</p>

<pre><code># Slow, create 5 connections
Net::HTTP.get(url)
Net::HTTP.get(url)
Net::HTTP.get(url)
Net::HTTP.get(url)
Net::HTTP.get(url)

# Fast, by re-using the same connection 5 times
Net::HTTP.start(url.host) do |http|
  http.get(url.path)
  http.get(url.path)
  http.get(url.path)
  http.get(url.path)
  http.get(url.path)
end

# Fast, but without a block
http = Net::HTTP.new(url.host, url.port)
http.start
http.get(url.path)
http.get(url.path)
http.get(url.path)
http.get(url.path)
http.get(url.path)
http.finish
</code></pre>

<p>The easiest way is to make all requests in a block passed to <code>Net::HTTP.start</code>, as you won’t forget to close the connection.
If you can’t group all your requests in one block, you can always start and end them manually.</p>

<h2>Database</h2>

<h3>Tune your Database settings</h3>

<p>By default, most databases are not optimally configured for your use and your server’s capabilities.
If you manage your own database, it’s crucial to do so.<br>
If your database is managed by a third party, it’s just as important to check that this has been done properly.</p>

<p>Fortunately, there are tools available to help you do just that.
For PostgreSQL, we recommend <a href="https://pgtune.leopard.in.ua/">PGTune</a>.
For MySQL, there is MySQLTunner, but we have yet to gain experience with it.</p>

<p>By giving the amount of RAM and number of CPUs, PGTune gives you the best settings for your server. It’s effortless to do.<br>
Then, you only have to copy the settings to the config file.</p>

<p>We like to store those settings into a dedicated file such as <code>/etc/postgresql/16/main/conf.d/pgtune.conf</code>.
If we have to change it in the future, we just need to replace the whole file.
It’s easier for the maintenance.</p>

<p>For SQLite, there are good default since Rails 7.1.
Otherwise you can set those parameters yourself:</p>

<pre><code>PRAGMA journal_mode = WAL;
PRAGMA synchronous = NORMAL;
PRAGMA journal_size_limit = 67108864; -- 64 megabytes
PRAGMA mmap_size = 134217728; -- 128 megabytes
PRAGMA cache_size = 2000;
PRAGMA busy_timeout = 5000;

</code></pre>

<h3>SQL will always be faster than your code</h3>

<p>If a task can be performed by the database or your code, let the database take care of it.
It’s faster because all the work is done where the data is.
This means less bandwidth consumption and less latency.
Moreover, your code is unlikely to be better than the database.</p>

<pre><code>  Invoice.pluck(:amount).sum # Slower
  Invoice.sum(:amount) # Faster
</code></pre>

<h3>Index all foreign keys</h3>

<p>The odds for a foreign key to appear in a where clause are very high.
If it’s not the case, probably that the foreign key is useless.
So it’s a no brainer decision to create an index when adding a foreign key.</p>

<p>The disadvantage of indexes is that they slow down table writes.
But very often, the number of reads far exceeds the number of writes.
On the other hand, if your index is never used, it should be deleted.
This information is available in PostgreSQL’s internal tables.
It’s a bit confusing to get into.
Fortunately, tools such as <a href="https://github.com/ankane/pghero">PgHero</a> make it very easy.</p>

<p>So, by default, add an index to each foreign key, then delete the few that are never used.</p>

<h3>Exclude nulls from indexes</h3>

<p>A database index is a B-tree structure.
It is very efficient when data has a high cardinality.
However, when a column allows nulls, it often becomes the most redundant value.
The index is less efficient and takes up more space.
Unless null is an infrequently repeated value, there are only disadvantages to indexing them.<br>
Exclude them when creating the index with a where clause.</p>

<pre><code>add_index :table, :column, where: "(column IS NOT NULL)"
</code></pre>

<p>Or in pure SQL :</p>

<pre><code>CREATE INDEX name ON table (column) WHERE column IS NOT NULL;
</code></pre>

<h3>Do not index column with a low cardinality such as boolean</h3>

<p>The reason is the same as in the previous paragraph.
B-tree indexes work best when cardinality is high.
So a Boolean is the worst column you can index.
So don’t index booleans.</p>

<p>As with other types, if you have very repetitive values that are not significant from a business point of view, it’s probably a good idea to exclude them from the index.
We’re thinking in particular of default values:</p>

<pre><code>add_column :accounts, :balance, default: 0, null: false
add_index :accouns, :balance, where: "(balance != 0)"
</code></pre>

<p>Or in pure SQL:</p>

<pre><code>ALTER TABLE accounts ADD COLUMN balance decimal DEFAULT 0 NOT NULL;
CREATE INDEX index_accounts_balance ON accounts (balance) WHERE balance != 0;
</code></pre>
