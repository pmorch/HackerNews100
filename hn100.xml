    <p>TL;DR: 2026 is going to be The Year of The Linux Desktop for me. I haven't booted into Windows in over 3 months on my tower and I'm starting to realize that it's not worth wasting the space for. I plan to unify my three SSDs and turn them all into btrfs drives on Fedora.</p>
<p>I've been merely tolerating Windows 11 for a while but recently it's gotten to the point where it's just absolutely intolerable. Somehow Linux on the desktop has gotten so much better by not even doing anything differently. Microsoft has managed to actively sabotage the desktop experience through years of active disregard and spite against their users. They've managed to take some of their most revolutionary technological innovations (the NT kernel's hybrid design allowing it to restart drivers, NTFS, ReFS, WSL, Hyper-V, etc.) then just shat all over them with start menus made with React Native, control-alt-delete menus that are actually just webviews, and forcing Copilot down everyone's throats to the point that I've accidentally gotten stuck in Copilot in a handheld gaming PC and had to hard reboot the device to get out of it. It's as if the internal teams at Microsoft have had decades of lead time in shooting each other in the head with predictable results.</p>
<p>To be honest, I've had enough. I'm going to go with Fedora on my tower and <a href="https://bazzite.gg/">Bazzite</a> (or SteamOS) on my handhelds.</p>
<p>I think that Linux on the desktop is ready for the masses now, not because it's advanced in a huge leap/bound. It's ready for the masses to use because Windows has gotten so much actively worse that continuing to use it is an active detriment to user experience and stability. Not to mention with the price of ram lately, you need every gigabyte you can get and desktop Linux lets you waste less of it on superfluous bullshit that very few people actually want.</p>

<p>At the very least, when something goes wrong on Linux you have log messages that can let you know what went wrong so you can search for it.</p>

          <p>Tesla published its final production and delivery numbers this morning, and they make for brutal reading. Sales were down almost 16 percent during the final three months of last year, meaning the company sold 77,343 fewer electric vehicles than it did during <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/01/tesla-sales-fell-for-the-first-time-in-over-a-decade/">the same period in 2024</a>.</p>
<p>For the entire year, the decline looks slightly better with a drop of 8.6 percent year over year. That means Tesla sold 1,636,129 cars in 2025, 153,097 fewer than it managed in 2024. Which in turn is more than it managed to shift in 2023.</p>
<h2>Sales issues</h2>
<p>Contributing factors to the poor sales are legion. The brand still relies on the Models 3 and Y to an overwhelming extent, and other than a mild cosmetic refresh, neither feels fresh or modern compared with competitors from Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>And Elon Musk’s much-hyped Cybertruck—which was supposed to cost less than $40,000 and go into production in 2021, lest anyone forget—has been a disaster, eclipsing the Edsel. Its failure has taken down another company initiative, Tesla’s “in-house battery cell.” It was initially designed specifically for the Cybertruck, although the CEO later claimed it would be used for static storage as well as EVs. But apparently, it has become the victim of a lack of demand. <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/12/29/tesla-4680-battery-supply-chain-collapses-partner-writes-down-dea/">Last week</a>, Electrek reported that Tesla’s South Korean battery material supplier L&amp;F wrote down its $2.9 billion contract with Tesla to just $7,386. A drop of more than 99 percent.</p>
<p>Musk has not dialed back his embrace of the far right, cratering sales in markets like California and Europe, where EV buyers often use their consciences to guide their wallets.</p>

      <article role="main">
        <p>Lots of the CVE world seems to focus on “security bugs” but I’ve found that it
is not all that well known exactly how the Linux kernel security process works.
I gave a
<a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/webinars/demystifying-the-linux-kernel-security-process">talk about this back in 2023</a>
and at other conferences since then, attempting to explain how it works, but I
also thought it would be good to explain this all in writing as it is required
to know this when trying to understand how the Linux kernel CNA issues CVEs.</p>
<p>This is a post in the series about the Linux kernel CVE release process:</p>
<ul>

how the Linux kernel releases are numbered.</li>

how to keep track of Linux kernel commits as they move from the main release
branch into the different stable releases in an automated way.</li>

</ul>

 - Linux CVE assignment tools
 - Other Linux CVE helper tools
 - Linux and the CRA
 - Staying secure and up to date
--->
<h2 id="tldr">tl;dr</h2>
<p>Summary up front for those not wanting to read a wall of text:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Linux kernel <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/security-bugs.html">security team</a>
work to fix reported issues as quickly as possible and get the fixes merged
to public trees, and do not do any announcements anywhere.</li>
<li>The Linux kernel security team and the
<a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/cve.html">CVE team</a>
are different groups of people, all of whom do this work on their own
recognition, not associated with any company.</li>
<li>Only send plain text emails to the kernel security team.</li>
<li>Do not email the kernel security team and expect to get a CVE assigned.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="reactive-not-proactive-security-work">Reactive, not proactive, security work</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/security-bugs.html">Linux kernel security team</a>
is group of Linux kernel developers who are responsible for triaging potential
security bugs that are reported to them, and get them fixed as soon as
possible.  They do this work as “reactive” for security issues, independent of
the great “proactive” kernel security work that the <a href="https://kspp.github.io/">Kernel Self-protection
project</a> has been
<a href="https://docs.kernel.org/security/self-protection.html">doing for the past 10+ years.</a></p>

<p>As can be seen in the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/security-bugs.html">in-kernel documentation</a>
to contact the security team, just email the address in that document the
potential issue that you have found, without using HTML or any binary
attachments, and the developers there will take the report and usually ask
questions and work to resolve the issue if it turns out to actually be a real
security issue.  Many issues reported are not, and so the reporter is told to
send their bug report to the respective mailing list and work on it with the
developers there, in public.</p>
<p>When reporting a bug, just send a simple, plain text email to the security
alias.  Do not send an email that contains a binary attachment as opening
unsolicited binary files is not anything anyone should be doing.  Also do not
use markdown formatting, just plain text.  Also, no encryption is needed, as it
will not work due to the email alias handling (i.e. one address to many
individuals.)  If you are forced to use encryption to report security problems,
please reconsider this policy as it feels counterproductive (UK government,
this means you…)</p>
<p>The members of the security team contain a handful of core kernel developers
that have experience dealing with security bugs, and represent different major
subsystems of the kernel.  They do this work as individuals, and specifically
can NOT tell their employer, or anyone else, anything that is discussed on the
security alias before it is resolved.  This arrangement has allowed the kernel
security team to remain independent and continue to operate across the
different governments that the members operate in, and it looks to become the
normal way project security teams work with the advent of the European Union’s
new CRA law coming into affect which places requirements on response time of
companies that receive notice of potential security issues in their projects.</p>
<h2 id="how-the-fix-happens">How the fix happens</h2>
<p>The way the security team works is when a bug is reported, if the members do
not have experience in that specific subsystem, they drag the maintainers of
that subsystem into the email chain, and work to get the bug resolved.  If a
subsystem has a continued number of bugs reported over time, the maintainer can
be “asked” if they wish to join the alias to help remove the additional “hop”
of bug triage happening.  This is what has caused the alias members to
naturally grow over time to end up representing the major portions of the
kernel with the most issues.</p>
<p>Ideally the bug reporter also provides a working fix for the issue, allowing
them to get the proper credit for the fix but of course that does not always
happen.  If no fix is provided, the developers involve work to resolve the bug
as soon as they can, and when they agree it is resolved, get it merged into the
main kernel branch and the stable kernel releases as soon as possible.</p>
<h2 id="no-embargoes">No embargoes</h2>
<p>As the documentation states, no embargoes longer than 7 days are allowed, once
a working fix is made, as there’s no real reason to hold off on getting a fix
merged at that time.  Only very few changes ever have any embargo at all, as
it’s more bother than it is worth.</p>
<p>Once the bug is fixed in the kernel trees, the developer’s work is finished,
and it is up to the reporter if they wish to “announce” a bugfix or not.  The
kernel security team on their own do not do any reporting or external
communication at all.  Only later, if the fix is warranted to justify a CVE
being assigned, is the commit announced as a security fix, but that work is
done by the kernel CVE team, NOT the kernel security team.</p>
<p>More about how the kernel CVE team works in a later post in this series…</p>
<h2 id="a-bug-is-a-bug-is-a-bug">A bug is a bug is a bug</h2>
<p>This “do not announce anything” policy has been present in the kernel security
team since the very beginning, and as you can imagine, has caused much
“disagreement” by those outside of the kernel community.  This came up soon
after the kernel security team was established in a
<a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/alpine.LFD.1.10.0807151620450.2867@woody.linux-foundation.org/">2008 email thread with Linus</a>:</p>

  Umm. What part of "they are just normal bugs" did you have issues with?
  I expressly told you that security bugs should not be marked as such,
  because bugs are bugs.

  &gt; in other words, it's all the more reason to have the commit say it's
  &gt; fixing a security issue.

  No.

  &gt; &gt; I'm just saying that why mark things, when the marking have no meaning?
  &gt; &gt; People who believe in them are just _wrong_.
  &gt;
  &gt; what is wrong in particular?

  You have two cases:

  - people think the marking is somehow trustworthy.

    People are WRONG, and are misled by the partial markings, thinking that
    unmarked bugfixes are "less important". They aren't.

  - People don't think it matters

    People are right, and the marking is pointless.
    In either case it's just stupid to mark them. I don't want to do it,
    because I don't want to perpetuate the myth of "security fixes" as a
    separate thing from "plain regular bug fixes".

    They're all fixes. They're all important. As are new features, for that
    matter.

  &gt; when you know that you're about to commit a patch that fixes a security
  &gt; bug, why is it wrong to say so in the commit?

  It's pointless and wrong because it makes people think that other bugs
  aren't potential security fixes.

  What was unclear about that?

reading.</p>
<h2 id="no-one-knows-how-you-use-open-source">No one knows how you use open source</h2>
<p>The primary reason why the kernel does not do any security announcements is
that almost any bugfix at the level of an operating system kernel can be a
“security issue” given the issues involved (memory leaks, denial of service,
information leaks, etc.)  Also, given that Linux is open source, the developers
involved in fixing problems do NOT know how Linux is being used.  A simple
bugfix for a minor thing for one user could be a major system vulnerability fix
for a different user, all depending on how Linux is being used.
<a href="https://blog.isosceles.com/author/ben/">Ben Hawkes</a>
said it best in a wonderful essay about
<a href="https://blog.isosceles.com/what-is-a-good-linux-kernel-bug/">“What is a good Linux kernel bug”</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It’s hard to capture the fact that a bug can be
super serious in one type of deployment, somewhat
important in another, or no big deal at all – and that
the bug can be all of this at the same time.
Vulnerability remediation is hard.”
– Ben Hawkes</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Always remember, kernel developers:</p>
<ul>
<li>do not know your use case.</li>
<li>do not know what code you use.</li>
<li>do not want to know any of this.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, overall, the kernel security bug policy can be boiled down to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fix known bugs as soon as possible.</li>
<li>Get releases out to users as quickly as possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>For those that are always worried “what if a bugfix causes problems”, they
should remember that a fix for a known bug is better than the potential of a
fix causing a future problem as future problems, when found, will be fixed
then.  You never want to have “known bugfixes” not resolved on your system at
any time.  So much so that recent laws will soon be preventing you that being
allowed for many countries.</p>
<h2 id="hardware-security-issues">Hardware security issues</h2>
<p>As history has shown us with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectre_(security_vulnerability)">Spectre</a>
and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meltdown_(security_vulnerability)">Meltdown</a>,
this “no embargo” policy does not always work well when working with problems
that cross operating systems and hardware platforms, possibly requiring
firmware or microcode updates.  Because of this, the kernel developers have
been forced to come up with a
<a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/embargoed-hardware-issues.html">“Hardware Security policy”</a>
to handle these types of issues.</p>
<p>This different workflow involves the creation of a special encrypted and
restricted email list containing just the needed kernel and hardware developers
that are required to get the problem solved.  With this process, embargoes are
grumpily tolerated for now.  Many different hardware bugs have been resolved in
Linux over the years through this process, but as a participant in some of
these efforts, it is clunky, awkward, and often times extremely slow.  The
kernel developers involved really do not like this process, and hopefully this
will be phased out over time as many hardware issues have been resolved in the
past year without having to get this special process involved at all.</p>
<p>Also, due to the CRA timelines, long embargo times will probably not even be
possible for hardware companies to handle.  How that is going to interact with
microcode and firmware updates in the next few years is going to be an
“interesting” thing to watch evolve.</p>
<h2 id="how-this-all-started">How this all started</h2>
<p>Way back in 2005, there was not any “official” way to contact anyone about
kernel security bugs.  It was just an ad-hock group of people that developers
“knew” they could email problems to.  That obviously did not really scale, and
was not helpful for anyone who did not know how the kernel developers worked.
This came to a head in 2005 with
<a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/41E2B181.3060009@rueb.com/">this email from Steve Bergman</a>:</p>

Subject: Proper procedure for reporting possible security vulnerabilities?
Date: Mon, 10 Jan 2005 10:46:57 -0600

There seems to be some confusion in certain quarters as to the proper
procedure for reporting possible kernel security issues.

REPORTING-BUGS says send bug reports to the maintainer of that area of
the kernel. However, what about areas for which a maintainer is not
listed? (e.g. VM) It seems that some take that to mean send it
directly to Linus and if you don't hear something back quickly, release
an exploit to the wild.

So what is the preferred procedure and is it documented somewhere?
Should it be made more prominent?

Thanks for any information,
Steve Bergman

a central email alias that could handle reported security issues was decided on

</code></pre><h2 id="no-security-announcements">No security announcements</h2>
<p>As stated earlier, the kernel security team does not do any sort of
announcements at all, or any public statements anywhere.  They are also not
responsible for assigning CVE ids to any kernel bugfixes, that is a different
team’s responsibility that happens after kernel bugfixes are in public kernel
releases, and almost never before.</p>
<p>Because they do not do any announcements, there is also no “early announcement”
list, despite many companies constantly asking to “join the security
pre-announcement security list” requests we get.</p>
<p>The primary reason there is no pre-announcement list is overall they should
always be considered public and contain leaks.  Otherwise, why would your
government allow them to exist?  Unless the list is for a project that is not
really used by anyone…</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        
        

        <img src="https://www.madebywindmill.com/tempi/blog/hbfs-bpm/assets/robots.jpg" alt="Robots illustration">

        <p><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=harder+better+faster+stronger+bpm">Google "harder better faster stronger bpm"</a> and Google’s “AI Overview” will tell you:</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>Daft Punk’s “Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger” generally sits around 123 BPM (Beats Per Minute), though some analyses find it slightly higher (like 123.48 BPM) or list different BPMs in remixes/workouts, with exact figures varying slightly by source and version.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Spotify’s metadata database, <a href="https://songbpm.com/@daft-punk/harder-better-faster-stronger">SongBPM</a>, and most other online BPM databases list it at exactly 123.</p>

        <p>But I think our helmet-clad robot friends might have been making a little joke that we’ve apparently all missed. The BPM of Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger is actually 123.45.</p>

        <p>How do I know this? It so happens that for over 10 years I’ve written an app called <a href="https://www.madebywindmill.com/tempi/">Tempi</a> that shows the music BPM in real time, so I know a little bit about the science and algorithms behind music tempo detection.</p>

        <p>Most tempo detection software works basically the same way:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>A specialized algorithm called the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) collects overlapping energy levels at different frequency bands.</li>
            <li>Those levels are refined into well-defined peaks that represent rhythmic events in the track.</li>
            <li>Another algorithm (autocorrelation) looks for patterns, or more accurately <em>periodicity</em>, in those peaks.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>But these patterns are tricky because there’s all kinds of noise, performance inaccuracies, and rhythmic harmonics throwing things off. All that is to say, a) it’s complicated and b) it’s not perfectly accurate.</p>

        <p>When I make changes to my own system of course I need some way to know if it’s getting better or worse, so I have a test library of hundreds of song snippets that I score it against. One of these songs is Daft Punk’s HBFS, and early on I noticed something strange about that track.</p>
        
        <p>Almost all electronic music is synced to a sequencer and so obviously is going to have a very steady tempo. But while the vast majority of electronic music tracks I test have an “integral” tempo – meaning their tempo is exactly some round number like 95, and not a fraction like 95.2 – my software always finds the BPM of HBFS to be somewhere between 123 and 124, but not exactly either. For years I’ve chalked this up to inconsistencies with my system and didn’t think much of it. But lately I’ve made improvements to the system so that it’s much more accurate and it now tells me the BPM of HBFS is 123.4.</p>

        <p>And that got me thinking, “Hmm. Did these guys pick that tempo because they have a sense of humor? And if so, how far would they take it?”</p>

        <p>To get to the bottom of this I needed to establish what the BPM of HBFS really is.</p>
        
        <h3>And that’s actually pretty easy to do…</h3>

        <p>Here’s a Venn diagram showing the overlap between human and computer capabilities in the digital realm:</p>

        <img src="https://www.madebywindmill.com/tempi/blog/hbfs-bpm/assets/venn.png" alt="Venn diagram showing overlap between human and computer capabilities">

        <p>Computers can do almost all “computer-y” things (i.e. things that can be entirely done on a computer) MUCH better, faster, (and stronger?) than humans. But for the time being there remain a few things that humans can do very easily which computers find difficult. Along with counting traffic lights and crosswalks, one of those things is finding the exact BPM of a song. Not an estimate like most software does, but the <em>exact</em> value with extreme precision across the entire song. Anyone with a basic sense of rhythm and an audio app can do this.</p>

        <p>Here’s how:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Open the song in an audio app like Logic, Audition, Ableton, Reaper, ProTools, etc.</li>
            <li>Zoom in on the waveform a little bit so you can see the shape of the beats.</li>
            <li>Find the first obvious beat – meaning it has a well-defined waveform peak – and the last obvious beat. Let’s call these “bookend” beats.</li>
            <li>Measure the exact duration in seconds between the bookend beats.</li>
            <li>Play the song and <em>count</em> all the beats starting at the first bookend beat and ending at the last bookend beat. (If you have an old school calculator, an easy way to do this is type “1+1=” and then just keep tapping “=” to add 1 on each beat.)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Then to get the <em>exact</em> tempo of the track, averaged throughout the entire thing, use this formula:</p>

        <pre><code>bpm = 60 * (number_of_beats - 1) / duration</code></pre>

        <p>Computers have a rough time of this because they don’t really know how to “keep a beat”, and the algorithms that <em>can</em> find the beat do a lot better when they already know the estimated BPM, which is obviously a chicken/egg problem.</p>

        <p>For the first bookend beat in HBFS I used the first beat after the “whooshing” intro, at around 5.58s. The last bookend beat I used the last “work” at about the 3:41.85 mark. (“Never” and “Over” aren’t good candidates because you can’t see their waveform peaks.)</p>

        <p><img src="https://www.madebywindmill.com/tempi/blog/hbfs-bpm/assets/hbfs-first-beat.jpg" alt="Waveform showing the first bookend beat">
            <img src="https://www.madebywindmill.com/tempi/blog/hbfs-bpm/assets/hbfs-final-beat.jpg" alt="Waveform showing the final bookend beat">
        </p>

        <p>That gives exactly 446 beats or 445 intervals.</p>

        <p>I tried this with two different copies of HBFS. The Discovery CD rip I have of the song has a duration between the bookend beats of 216.276, so:</p>

        <pre><code>bpm = 60 * 445 / 216.276 = 123.4499403556</code></pre>

        <p>The “YouTube official audio” track I tested has a duration of 216.282, so:</p>

        <pre><code>bpm = 60 * 445 / 216.282 = 123.4533651445</code></pre>

        <p>The original Discovery CD version has obviously undergone less processing over time than the YouTube version so I tend to think it’s more representative, and it’s <em>very</em> close to 123.45 – only a 0.00005964 difference! But even the more modern YouTube version closely rounds to 123.45.</p>

        <p>So hopefully I’ve put this fact to rest:</p>
        
        <p><b>The BPM of Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger is 123.45.</b></p>
        
        <h2>But…was it intentional?</h2>
        
        <p>The year is 1999 or 2000. Would the gear Daft Punk uses even <em>support</em> fractional BPMs? And if so out to how many decimal places?</p>

        <p>From their 2001 interview with Remix Magazine (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080503064751/http://remixmag.com/mag/remix_robopop/">archive.org</a>) we know that Bangalter says:</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>Our sequencing is done either on an E-mu SP-1200, an Akai MPC, or a PC with Logic Audio software. We do not work on things in just one way.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>And from later interviews we know the Akai MPC was specifically an MPC-3000. (Oh, and that’s <em>Emagic</em>’s Logic, <em>not</em> Apple’s. Apple didn’t acquire Emagic until 2002.)</p>

        <p>Did the E-mu support fractional BPMs? Yes, but only to 1 decimal place:</p>

        <img src="https://www.madebywindmill.com/tempi/blog/hbfs-bpm/assets/e-mu-display.jpg" alt="E-mu SP-1200 display showing tempo">

        <p>The Akai MPC-3000? Yep, also to 1 decimal place:</p>

        <img src="https://www.madebywindmill.com/tempi/blog/hbfs-bpm/assets/akai-display.jpg" alt="Akai MPC-3000 display showing tempo">

        <p>What about Emagic’s Logic?</p>

        <img src="https://www.madebywindmill.com/tempi/blog/hbfs-bpm/assets/logic-tempo.jpg" alt="Emagic Logic tempo display showing 4 decimal places">

        <p>Oooh, look at that. Logic supported BPMs to <em>*4*</em> decimal places.</p>

        <p>But while we know those three sequencers were used on the Discovery album, I’m not sure anyone else knows which one was specifically used on HBFS. I’ve searched and searched and it seems this detail has just never been revealed.</p>

        <p>And to confuse matters more, in a <a href="https://entertainment.time.com/2013/05/21/robocall-a-conversation-with-daft-punk/">2013 interview with Time Magazine</a>, Bangalter says:</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>So we’ve never actually made music with computers! [laughs] Neither Homework nor Discovery nor even Human After All were made with computers.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Was he contradicting himself from 12 years before? Or did he forget? Or maybe it’s a terminology thing?</p>

        <p>That the CD version is <em>so</em> close to exactly 123.45 makes me think this was intentional. And if it was? Well played, robots. You managed to leave a little Easter egg hiding in plain sight for 25 years.</p>

<h3><span id="Why_In_General">Why In General</span></h3>
<p><span id="Advantages">POSSE is considered a robust and preferable syndication model</span> for the following reasons:
</p>
<ul><li><b>Reduce 3rd party dependence.</b> By posting directly to your own site, you're not dependent on 3rd Party services to do so -- if you can access your site, you can publish your content. On the contrary with PESOS, <a href="https://twitter.com/colinjohnston/status/772533151960707072">when the 3rd party site is down</a>, you are unable to add content.</li>
<li><b>Ownership.</b> By posting <i>first</i> on your own site, you create a direct ownership chain that can be traced back to you without any intervening 3rd party services (silos) TOS's getting in the way (which is a vulnerability of <a href="https://indieweb.org/PESOS" title="PESOS">PESOS</a>).</li>
<li><b>Own canonical URLs to your content.</b> Canonical URLs to your content are on your domain.</li>
<li><b>Copies can cite the original.</b> By posting content first to your own site (and thus creating a permalink for it), copies that you post on 3rd Party services can link or cite the original on your site (see <a href="https://indieweb.org/syndication_formats" title="syndication formats">syndication_formats</a> and <a href="https://indieweb.org/Twitter#POSSE_Notes_to_Twitter" title="Twitter">POSSE Notes to Twitter</a>)</li>
<li><b>Better search.</b> Searching public content on your own domain (with any web search engine of your choice) works better than depending on <a href="https://indieweb.org/silos" title="silos">silos</a> exclusively to search your posts (e.g. Twitter for a while only showed recent tweets in search results. <a href="https://indieweb.org/Facebook" title="Facebook">Facebook</a> still has very poor search results).</li>
<li><a href="https://indieweb.org/backfeed" title="backfeed">backfeed</a> can be used to pull in (reverse syndicate) responses from other services</li>
<li>allows taking advantage of other services' social layers and aggregation features while storing the canonical copy of your content on your own site</li>
<li>...</li></ul>
<h3><span id="Why_Link_To_Your_Original">Why Link To Your Original</span></h3>
<p>Common <a>POSSE</a> practice is to link from POSSE copies to your original, using a <a href="https://indieweb.org/permashortlink" title="permashortlink">permashortlink</a>. Here are a few reasons why:
</p>
<ul><li><b>Discovery of your original content.</b> <a href="https://indieweb.org/discovery" title="discovery">discovery</a> of your original content from the copies on 3rd party services is enabled by the permashortlinks to your originals posted on said services</li>
<li><b>Subvert spammers who copy your posts.</b> When spammers (e.g. @sin3rss) mindlessly copy from your POSSE copies and repost, they also copy the link back to the original, and thus provide more distribution for people to find and view your original post. "<a href="http://tantek.com/2011/009/t3/value-searching-finding-past-tweets-self-hosting">2011-01-09 internet aikido</a>" of a sort.</li>
<li><b>Better ranking for your original posts.</b> If/when your POSSE copies are themselves copied by others and (re)posted elsewhere (e.g. manual retweets, RSS bots etc.), when the copies link to your original posts, search engines figure that out by following those links back to the original and ranking it higher.</li></ul>

<h3><span id="How_to_implement">How to implement</span></h3>
<p>This section is for web developers implementing POSSE.
</p>
<h4><span id="In_General">In General</span></h4>
<p>In general, when your content posting software posts something, it should also post a copy to the <a href="https://indieweb.org/silo" title="silo">silo</a> destinations of your choice, with an <a href="https://indieweb.org/original_post_link" title="original post link">original post link</a> (e.g. <a href="https://indieweb.org/permashortlink" title="permashortlink">permashortlink</a> or <a href="https://indieweb.org/permashortcitation" title="permashortcitation">permashortcitation</a>) back to your original.
</p><p>The details of how to do so vary per destination. See the silo-specific sections below.
</p><p>Once you have posted the copy to the silo, you should:
</p>
<ul><li>link to the syndicated copy from the original in a <b><a href="https://indieweb.org/posts-elsewhere" title="posts-elsewhere">posts-elsewhere</a></b> section on your post.</li></ul>
<h4><span id="User_Interface">User Interface</span></h4>
<p>The best user interface (UI) is automatic, dependable, and invisible. If you can implement POSSEing in a way that always does exactly what you want, predictably, then no explicit UI is needed.
</p>
<h5><span id="Preview">Preview</span></h5>
<p>One way to provide more predictability and inspire confidence is to show what will be POSSEd (within the limitations of the destination) as a preview before publishing

<p><a href="https://indieweb.org/Twitter" title="Twitter">Twitter</a> is perhaps the most popular POSSE destination and a good place to start.
</p><p>If you can start posting notes (tweets) to your own site and POSSEing to Twitter, <em>instead of</em> posting directly to Twitter, you have taken a big step towards owning your data.
</p><p>Details:
</p>

<p>See <a href="https://indieweb.org/Twitter#POSSE_to_Twitter" title="Twitter">POSSE to Twitter</a> for details on how to POSSE both notes and articles (blog posts) to Twitter.
</p>
<h4><span id="Facebook">Facebook</span></h4>

<p>There are two options for POSSEing to Facebook currently:
</p>
<ul><li>Manually crosspost</li>
<li>Semi-automatically with the <a href="https://snarfed.org/2021-02-18_bridgy-browser-extension-for-facebook">Bridgy browser extension for Facebook</a></li></ul>
<h4><span id="Medium">Medium</span></h4>


<h4><span id="WordPress">WordPress</span></h4>

<ul><li>How does veganstraightedge.com do it? (all his articles are manually POSSEd to WordPress.com)</li>
<li><span><img src="https://www.boffosocko.com/logo.jpg" alt=""> <a href="https://indieweb.org/User:Boffosocko.com" title="User:Boffosocko.com">Chris Aldrich</a></span> uses a WordPress plugin <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-crosspost/">WordPress Crosspost</a> to POSSE from a self-hosted WordPress install to WordPress.com.</li></ul>
<h4><span id="Plain_Text_Notes">Plain Text Notes</span></h4>
<p>Some destinations (e.g. <a href="https://indieweb.org/SMS" title="SMS">SMS</a> or <a href="https://indieweb.org/push_notification" title="push notification">push notifications</a>) may require a pure plain text representation.
</p>
<ul><li><a href="https://indieweb.org/h-entry_to_text" title="h-entry to text">h-entry_to_text</a> is a method of generating a plain text representation from an arbitrary <a href="https://indieweb.org/h-entry" title="h-entry">h-entry</a></li></ul>
<h4><span id="Software">Software</span></h4>
<p>Software and libraries to implement POSSE:
</p>
<ul><li>PHP
<ul><li>The POSSE namespace in <a href="https://github.com/barnabywalters/php-helpers">php-helpers</a> (might be moved to a separate package) contains various truncation, preparation and syndication functions including HTML =&gt; plaintext µblog syntax converter</li></ul></li>
<li>Python
<ul><li><a href="https://bolt80.com/silorider/">SiloRider</a> is a command-line tool, implemented in Python, that lets you implement POSSE to various services (Twitter and Mastodon as of 2018-08-01).</li>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.com/chaica/feed2toot">Feed2Toot</a> is another command-line python tool that parses any number of RSS feeds and posts their content on ActivityPub based services (tested with: Mastodon, Pleroma). Contains some neat bells and whistles like advanced post filtering, numerous options for feed parsing and toot formatting.</li></ul></li>
<li>Docker

<h4><span id="Services">Services</span></h4>
<ul><li><a href="https://indieweb.org/Bridgy" title="Bridgy">Bridgy</a> <a href="https://www.brid.gy/about#publish">Publish</a> is POSSE-as-a-service. It supports <a href="https://indieweb.org/Twitter" title="Twitter">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://indieweb.org/Flickr" title="Flickr">Flickr</a>, <a href="https://indieweb.org/GitHub" title="GitHub">GitHub</a> and <a href="https://indieweb.org/Mastodon" title="Mastodon">Mastodon</a>. You can use it interactively or programmatically via <a href="https://indieweb.org/webmention" title="webmention">webmention</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://muggedtweets.com/">Mugged Tweets</a> - will POSSE a note to a mug (may require first POSSEing to Twitter)</li>
<li><a href="https://ifttt.com/">IFTTT</a> allows automatically reposting content with an RSS or Atom feed to a number of silos incuding Twitter, Tumblr, and Facebook</li>
<li><a href="https://indieweb.org/EchoFeed" title="EchoFeed">EchoFeed</a></li></ul>
<h4><span id="Publishing_Flows">Publishing Flows</span></h4>
<p>There's at least two ways to implement a POSSE content posting flow:
</p>
<h5><span id="Client_to_site_to_silo">Client to site to silo</span></h5>
<ul><li>The user writes a piece of content using a publishing client
<ul><li>Optional: client provides UI for selecting which 3rd party services to push to if it knows about them, with optional customizations for per service</li></ul></li>
<li>Having finished the content, the user publishes content to their server (optionally: with metadata of which 3rd party services and any customizations thereof)
<ul><li>Optional: client can generate a permalink knowing the state of the server, and publish to that permalink</li></ul></li>
<li>The server publishes the content, generates a permalink and summary (and/or customized content suited to 3rd party services) if necessary</li>
<li>The server posts copies with permalinks to 3rd party services</li></ul>
<p>Advantages:
</p>
<ul><li>User only has to interact with one site over the internet, their own</li>
<li>Syndication can be done fully automatically by the server</li></ul>
<p>Disadvantages:
</p>
<ul><li>any?</li></ul>
<h5><span id="Client_to_site_and_silo">Client to site and silo</span></h5>
<ul><li>The user writes a piece of content using a publishing client</li>
<li>Having finished the content, the user publishes it to their server</li>
<li>The client queries the server for the URL of the content it just pushed</li>
<li>The publishing client presents the user with an interface for selecting:
<ul><li>Which 3rd party services to publish to</li>
<li>The exact content published to the services, pre-filled with a summary based on the produced content</li></ul></li>
<li>The user selects the services and submits the form</li>
<li>The publishing client posts the content summaries out to the 3rd party services</li></ul>
<p>Advantages:
</p>
<ul><li>More user control over timing and editing of copies of content to 3rd party services</li></ul>
<p>Disadvantages:
</p>
<ul><li>Syndication requires a manual step each time</li>
<li>Dependent on client connectivity directly to 3rd party services (problematic in flakey mobile situations, or when client is publishing using domain-censored internet access).</li></ul>

I primarily syndicate to Twitter using a very lo-fi solution of adding silo (Facebook, Twiiter, Google+) provided share links to each post that I can manually click to prefill content, edit and post. I've avoided API integration because of the extensive experience I've had using Facebook API and dealing with it's random changes. "Integration" has high costs sometimes so I keep it as simple as possible.

<h3><span id="POSE">POSE</span></h3>
<p>Main article: <a href="https://indieweb.org/POSE" title="POSE">POSE</a></p>
<p><a href="https://indieweb.org/POSE" title="POSE">POSE</a>, Publish Once Syndicate Everywhere, was a broader predecessor of POSSE that also included publishing once on one particular <a href="https://indieweb.org/silo" title="silo">silo</a>, and then syndicating out to other silos.
</p>
<h3><span id="PESOS">PESOS</span></h3>

<p>A similar but opposite approach is <a href="https://indieweb.org/PESOS" title="PESOS">PESOS</a> where content is posted first to 3rd party services and then copied/syndicated into a personal site. 
</p><p>If exact copies of content are posted on both a personal site and 3rd party services, there's no way to tell (short of comparing possibly non-existent sub-second accurate published dates) whether a site is using POSSE or PESOS. Sites can provably support POSSE by including perma(short)links in syndicated copies that link/reference back to published originals.
</p>
<h3><span id="PESETAS">PESETAS</span></h3>

<p><a href="https://indieweb.org/PESETAS" title="PESETAS">PESETAS</a> is like PESOS but copying/syndicating everything to a particular silo (without any involvement of a personal site).
</p><p>For example, most silos support cross-posting to <a href="https://indieweb.org/Twitter" title="Twitter">Twitter</a>, thus you could connect everything to your Twitter account and always (auto-)cross-post there to keep a copy. 
</p><p>E.g. <a href="https://indieweb.org/Tumblr" title="Tumblr">Tumblr</a> has a UI for cross-posting to <a href="https://indieweb.org/Twitter" title="Twitter">Twitter</a>. See <a href="http://webapps.stackexchange.com/questions/15315/customize-the-message-tumblr-sends-to-twitter">Webapps StackExchange post</a> for documentation and screenshots of UI.
</p><p>Tumblr is a better PESETAS destination however, since it is well established, allows for a wider variety of content, and allows more text, and links to URLs directly instead of linkwrapping them like Twitter does.
</p>
<h2><span id="Brainstorming">Brainstorming</span></h2>
<h3><span id="CRUD">CRUD</span></h3>
<p>All of the above, and to date (2013-222), POSSE has solely described syndicating the <b>C</b>reation of content on your site (publishing) to other sites. This model has been quite successful and perhaps may be sufficient.
</p><p>However, it is worth exploring the potential utility of a full CRUD protocol for POSSE.
</p>
<h3><span id="Create">Create</span></h3>
<p>Create is the POSSE default. You create content on your site, you POSSE your creates to other sites. All of this is described above, and in silo-specific details on <a href="https://indieweb.org/silo" title="silo">silo</a> pages.
</p>
<h3><span id="Read">Read</span></h3>
<p>Read as a verb is interesting when applied to POSSE.
</p><p>At a minimum, it's useful to implement storing links to syndicated copies of your content to provide for the future possibility of reading from downstream POSSE copies.
</p><p>See: 
</p>
<ul><li><a href="https://indieweb.org/u-syndication" title="u-syndication">u-syndication</a> for how to markup links to syndicated copies of your content</li>
<li><a href="https://indieweb.org/syndication-link-use-cases" title="syndication-link-use-cases">syndication-link-use-cases</a> for why to do so</li></ul>
<p>Actual direct uses of Reading from downstream POSSE copies:
</p>
<ul><li>reverse-syndication / <a href="https://indieweb.org/backfeed" title="backfeed">backfeed</a> of activity around the POSSE copy onto your original:
<ul><li><a href="https://indieweb.org/comments" title="comments">comments</a>/replies</li>
<li><a href="https://indieweb.org/favorites" title="favorites">favorites</a>/likes</li>
<li><a href="https://indieweb.org/reposts" title="reposts">reposts</a> (retweets)</li></ul></li></ul>
<p>In addition, keeping a <a href="https://indieweb.org/u-syndication" title="u-syndication">u-syndication</a> link to the POSSE copy enables deleting it to perform an Update or a Delete action, as described in the following sections.
</p>
<h3><span id="Update">Update</span></h3>
<p>If a POSSE destination allows updates/edits, then when you edit your post, you could propagate that update to the downstream POSSE copy as well.
</p>
<ul><li>E.g. <a href="https://indieweb.org/Facebook" title="Facebook">Facebook</a> allows editing the text of a post (including any links in the text), person tags, but not the image of a photo post</li></ul>
<p>If the destination disallows updates/edits, like <a href="https://indieweb.org/Twitter" title="Twitter">Twitter</a>, it is still possible to virtually POSSE updates by deleting the POSSE tweet and reposting, i.e.:
</p><p>Consider only POSSEing updates to Twitter:
</p>
<ul><li>if no one has replied to it yet (otherwise you'd break a threaded conversation on Twitter)</li>
<li>if your changes would be shown in the truncated copy on Twitter (i.e. if your changes are past the 140 (more like 120) character horizon, no point in churning the Twitter copy).</li>
<li>within a very short time window, maybe like 2-5 minutes, because otherwise the update will be seen as a duplicate to people who are reading you on Twitter.</li></ul>
<p>All of these concerns are regarding the experience that you provide to your friends reading your tweets on Twitter, which of course should be the whole (design) reason you're bothering to POSSE to Twitter in the first place.
</p><p>For details, see silo-specific POSSE sections:
</p>
<ul><li><a href="https://indieweb.org/Facebook" title="Facebook">Facebook</a>: <a href="https://indieweb.org/POSSE_to_Facebook" title="POSSE to Facebook">POSSE to Facebook</a> (<a href="https://indieweb.org/to-do" title="to-do">to-do</a>: needs details re: edit text ok, but no photo editing, photo posts need delete/repost to simulate POSSE update)</li>
<li><a href="https://indieweb.org/Flickr" title="Flickr">Flickr</a>: (UI supports manually updating the image of a photo post, but is that available in the API? and if so, file a <a href="https://indieweb.org/Bridgy" title="Bridgy">Bridgy</a> Publish feature request GitHub issue to support POSSE Update to Flickr (including the image of a photo post)</li>
<li><a href="https://indieweb.org/Twitter#POSSE_to_Twitter" title="Twitter">Twitter: POSSE to Twitter</a> (<a href="https://indieweb.org/to-do" title="to-do">to-do</a>: copy the above delete/repost strategy to there)</li>
<li>...</li></ul>
<h3><span id="Delete">Delete</span></h3>
<p>Deletes seem fairly straightforward to POSSE, especially to services which themselves propagate deletes to clients.
</p><p>E.g. one can delete a note on Twitter at any point.
</p><p>Similar to updates, consider:
</p>
<ul><li>if there are already replies to a POSSE copy (or activity like favorites/retweets), consider keeping it to keep conversation threading (and others' favorites/retweets).</li></ul>
<p>However, if you really feel like deleting the content from your site and POSSE copies (e.g. on Twitter), go ahead and do so. 
</p><p>Perhaps this is an opportunity for the UI for the deletion of a post to check to see if there's been any activity (replies, favorites, retweets) on the POSSE copy before performing the delete. One possible implementation could involve the UI informing the user of this activity (or lack of it) and reconfirming the delete request on a per-service basis.

<h2><span id="FAQ">FAQ</span></h2>
<h3><span id="Worry_about_search_engines_and_duplicates">Worry about search engines and duplicates</span></h3>
<p>Q: Do we need to worry about search engines penalizing apparently duplicate posts?
</p><p>A: That's why the POSSE copies SHOULD always link back to the originals. So that search engines can infer that the copies are just copies. Ideally POSSE copies on silos should use <a href="https://indieweb.org/rel-canonical" title="rel-canonical">rel-canonical</a> to link back to the originals, but even without explicit rel-canonical, the explicit link back to the original is a strong hint that it is an original.
</p><p>This is also an advantage of POSSE over PESOS. With PESOS - there's no way to tell what's the original and what's the copy - so they do look like duplicates.
</p>
<h3><span id="POSSE-post-discovery_and_backlinks">POSSE-post-discovery and backlinks</span></h3>
<p>Q: Brid.gy can use <a href="https://indieweb.org/posse-post-discovery" title="posse-post-discovery">posse-post-discovery</a> to find the relationship between a syndicated post and the original when there is not explicit link. Does this mean I should stop adding <a href="https://indieweb.org/backlink" title="backlink">backlinks</a> to syndicated copies?
</p><p>A: POSSEing without a <a href="https://indieweb.org/backlink" title="backlink">backlink</a> is considered a last resort, and has some costs associated with it. See <a href="https://indieweb.org/posse-post-discovery#Tradeoffs" title="posse-post-discovery">posse-post-discovery#Tradeoffs</a> for more details.

Or rather, everywhere you want to reach your readers. Facebook Instant Article? Sure, hook up the RSS feed. Apple News? Send the feed over there, too. AMP? Sure, generate an AMP page. No need to stop there—tap the new Medium API and half a dozen others as well.</p><p>Reading is a fragmented experience. Some people will love reading on the Web, some via RSS in their favorite reader, some in Facebook Instant Articles, some via AMP pages on Twitter, some via Lynx in their terminal running on a restored TRS-80 (seriously, it can be done. See below). The beauty of the POSSE approach is that you can reach them all from a single, canonical source.</p><p>[…]</p><p>For the Web's sake, let's hope Google sticks with AMP long enough to convince publishers that the real future is speeding up their own pages and embracing a POSSE-style approach.</p></blockquote></li>

<p dir="auto">Most simply, jank is a <a href="https://clojure.org/" rel="nofollow">Clojure</a> dialect on LLVM with C++ interop.
Less simply, jank is a general-purpose programming language which embraces the interactive,
functional, value-oriented nature of Clojure and the desire for the native
runtime and performance of C++. jank aims to be strongly compatible with
Clojure. While Clojure's default host is the JVM and its interop is with Java,
jank's host is LLVM and its interop is with C++.</p>

<p dir="auto">TinyTinyTPU is an educational implementation of Google's TPU architecture, scaled down to a 2×2 systolic array. It demonstrates:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Systolic Array Architecture</strong>: Data flows horizontally (activations) and vertically (partial sums)</li>
<li><strong>Diagonal Wavefront Weight Loading</strong>: Staggered weight capture for proper systolic timing</li>
<li><strong>Full MLP Pipeline</strong>: Weight FIFO → MMU → Accumulator → Activation → Normalization → Quantization</li>
<li><strong>Multi-Layer Inference</strong>: Supports sequential layer processing with double-buffered activations</li>
</ul>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-body-3754572994329279659" itemprop="articleBody">
<p>It all started with cold calling.</p>

<p>In our new "AI/ML Product Management" class, the "pre-case" submissions (short assignments meant to prepare students for class discussion) were looking suspiciously good. Not "strong student" good. More like "this reads like a McKinsey memo that went through three rounds of editing," good.</p>

<p>So we started cold calling students randomly during class.</p>

<p>The result was... illuminating. Many students who had submitted thoughtful, well-structured work could not explain basic choices in their own submission after two follow-up questions. Some could not participate at all. This gap was too consistent to blame on nerves or bad luck. <strong>If you cannot defend your own work live, then the written artifact is not measuring what you think it is measuring.</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://brianjabarian.org/">Brian Jabarian</a> has been doing <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5395709">interesting work on this problem</a>, and his results both inspired us and gave us the confidence to try something that would have sounded absurd two years ago: running the final exam with a Voice AI agent.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Why oral exams? And why now?</h2>

<p>The core problem is simple: students have immediate access to LLMs that can handle most exam questions we traditionally use for assessment. The old equilibrium, where take-home work could reliably measure understanding, is dead. Gone. Kaput.</p>

<p>Oral exams are a natural response. They force real-time reasoning, application to novel prompts, and defense of actual decisions. The problem? Oral exams are a logistical nightmare. You cannot run them for a large class without turning the final exam period into a month-long hostage situation.</p>

<p>Unless you cheat.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Enter the Voice Agent</h2>

<p>We used <a href="https://elevenlabs.io/conversational-ai">ElevenLabs Conversational AI</a> to build the examiner. The platform bundles the messy parts (speech-to-text, text-to-speech, turn-taking, interruption handling, …) into something usable. And here is the thing that surprised me: a basic version for a low-stakes setting (e.g., an assignment) can be up and running in literally minutes. Minutes. Just write a prompt describing what the agent should ask the student, and you are done.</p>

<p>Two features mattered a lot for our setup:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Dynamic variables:</strong> pass the student's name, project details, and other per-student context into the conversation as parameters</li>
<li><strong>Workflows:</strong> build a structured flow with sub-agents instead of a single "chatty" agent trying to do everything</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>What the exam looked like</h2>

<p>We ran a two-part oral exam.</p>

<p><strong>Part 1: "Talk me through your project."</strong> The agent asks about the student's capstone project: goals, data, modeling choices, evaluation, failure modes. This is where the "LLM did my homework" strategy dies. You can paste an assignment into ChatGPT. It is much harder to improvise consistent answers about specific decisions when someone is drilling into details.</p>

<p><strong>Part 2: "Now do a case."</strong> The agent picks one of the cases we discussed in class and asks questions spanning the topics we covered: basically testing whether students absorbed the material or just showed up.</p>

<p>To handle this structure, we split the exam into sub-agents in a workflow:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Authentication agent:</strong> Asks for the student's ID and refuses to proceed without a valid one. (In a more productized version, we would integrate with NYU SSO instead of checking against a list.)</li>
<li><strong>Project discussion agent:</strong> Gets project context injected via parameters. The prompt includes details of each project so the agent can ask informed questions. The next step is obvious: connect retrieval over the student's submitted slides and reports so the agent can quote and probe precisely.</li>
<li><strong>Case discussion agent:</strong> Selects a case and runs structured questioning. Again, RAG would help with richer case details.</li>
</ol>

<p>This "many small agents" approach is not just aesthetic. It prevents the system from drifting into unbounded conversation, and it makes debugging possible.</p>

<hr>

<h2>By the Numbers</h2>

<ul>
<li>36 students examined over 9 days</li>
<li>25 minutes average (range: 9–64)</li>
<li>65 messages per conversation on average</li>
<li>0.42 USD per student (15 USD total)</li>
<li>89% of LLM grades within 1 point</li>
<li>Shortest exam (9 min) → highest score (19/20)</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>The economics</h2>

<p>Let's talk money.</p>

<p>Total cost for 36 students: <strong>15 USD</strong>.</p>

<p>That's 8 USD for Claude (the chair and heaviest grader), 2 USD for Gemini, 0.30 USD for OpenAI, and roughly 5 USD for ElevenLabs voice minutes. Forty-two cents per student.</p>

<p>The alternative? 36 students × 25-minute exam × 2 graders = 30 hours of human time. At TA rates (~25/hour), that's 750. At faculty rates, it's "we don't do oral exams because they don't scale."</p>

<p>For 15 dollars, we got: real-time oral examination, a three-model grading council with deliberation, structured feedback with verbatim quotes, a complete audit trail, and—as you'll see—a diagnosis of our own teaching gaps.</p>

<p>The unit economics in terms of cost work. We will see next that the real benefit is in the value that is delivered, not in the 50x cost savings.</p>

<hr>

<h2>What broke (and how we fixed it)</h2>

<p>The first version had problems. Here is what we learned.</p>

<h3>1) The voice was intimidating</h3>

<p>A few students complained that the agent sounded severe. We had cloned Foster Provost's voice because, frankly, his clone was much more accurate than the clones of our own voices. But the students found it... intense. Here is an email from a student:</p>

<blockquote>I had prepared thoroughly and felt confident in my understanding of the material, but the intensity of the interviewer's voice during the exam unexpectedly heightened my anxiety and affected my performance. The experience was more triggering than I anticipated, which made it difficult to fully demonstrate my knowledge. Throughout the course, I have actively participated and engaged with the material, and I had hoped to better demonstrate my knowledge in this interview.</blockquote>

<p>And here is another:</p>

<blockquote>Just got done with my oral exam. [...] I honestly didn't feel comfortable with it at all. The voice you picked was so condescending that it actually dropped my confidence. [...] I don't know why but the agent was shouting at me.</blockquote>

<p><strong>Fix:</strong> We are split on that. We love FakeFoster. But next time we will A/B test, and we will try to test other voices. At the end of the day, we want to optimize for comprehension, not charisma. <a href="https://elevenlabs.io/docs/agents-platform/guides/elevenlabs-docs-agent">ElevenLabs has guidance on voice and personality tuning: they treat this as a product design problem</a>, and probably a good idea.</p>

<h3>2) The agent stacked questions</h3>

<p>This was the biggest real issue. The agent would ask something like: "Explain your metric choice, and also tell me what baselines you tried, and why you did not use X, and what you would do next."</p>

<p>That is not one question. That is four questions wearing a trench coat. The cognitive load for an oral exam is already high. Stacking questions makes it brutal.</p>

<p><strong>Fix:</strong> Hard rule in the prompt: <em>one question at a time</em>. If you want multi-part probing, chain it across turns. For grading the exam, we included an "interference protocol": students received full credit if they had questions stacked like that and answered only some of them.</p>

<h3>3) Clarifications became moving targets</h3>

<p>Student: "Can you repeat the question?"<br>
Agent: <em>paraphrases the question in a subtly different way</em></p>

<p>Now the student is solving a different problem than the one they were asked. Very frustrating.</p>

<p><strong>Fix:</strong> Explicit instruction in the prompt: <em>repeat verbatim when asked to repeat</em>. No paraphrasing. Same words.</p>

<h3>4) The agent did not let students think</h3>

<p>Humans rush to fill silence. Agents do too. Students would pause to think, and the agent would jump in with follow-up probes or worse: interpret the silence as confusion and move on.</p>

<p><strong>Fix:</strong> Tell the agent to allow think-time without probing aggressively. It made the exam feel less like an interrogation. We also increased the time-out before the agent asks "Are you there?" from 5 to 10 seconds.</p>

<h3>5) Lack of randomization</h3>

<p>We asked the agent to "randomly select" a case study. It did not.</p>

<p>From December 12–18, when Zillow was in the case list, the agent picked Zillow <strong>88% of the time</strong>. After we removed Zillow from the prompt on December 18, the agent immediately latched onto Predictive Policing—picking it for <strong>16 out of 21 exams</strong> on December 19 alone.</p>

<p>LLMs are not random. They have implicit preferences and ordering biases. Asking an LLM to "pick randomly" is like asking a human to "think of a number between 1 and 10"—you're going to get a lot of 7s.</p>

<p><strong>Fix:</strong> Pass an explicit random number as a parameter and map it to cases deterministically. Do the randomization in code, not in the prompt.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Grading: the council deliberation actually worked</h2>

<p>OK, so here is where things got interesting.</p>

<p>We graded using a "<a href="https://github.com/karpathy/llm-council" target="_blank">council of LLMs</a>" approach, an idea we borrowed from Andrej Karpathy. Three models (Claude, Gemini, ChatGPT) assessed each transcript independently. Then they saw each other's assessments and revised. Finally, the chair (Claude) synthesized the final grade with evidence.</p>

<p><strong>Round 1 was a mess</strong>. When the models graded independently, agreement was poor: 0% of grades matched exactly, and only 23% were within 2 points. The average maximum disagreement was nearly 4 points on a 20-point scale.</p>

<p>And here's the kicker: Gemini was a softie: It averaged 17/20. Claude averaged 13.4/20. That's a 3.6-point gap—the difference between a B+ and a B-.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Claude and OpenAI were already aligned: 70% of their grades were within 1 point of each other in Round 1.</p>

<table>
<tbody><tr>
<th>Model</th>
<th>Round 1 Mean</th>
<th>Round 2 Mean</th>
<th>Change</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Claude</td>
<td>13.4/20</td>
<td>13.9/20</td>
<td>+0.5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>OpenAI</td>
<td>14.0/20</td>
<td>14.0/20</td>
<td>+0.0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Gemini</td>
<td>17.0/20</td>
<td>15.0/20</td>
<td>-2.0</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>Then came consultation. After each model saw the others' assessments and evidence, agreement improved dramatically:</p>

<table>
<tbody><tr>
<th>Metric</th>
<th>Round 1</th>
<th>Round 2</th>
<th>Improvement</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Perfect agreement</td>
<td>0%</td>
<td>21%</td>
<td>+21 pp</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Within 1 point</td>
<td>0%</td>
<td>62%</td>
<td>+62 pp</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Within 2 points</td>
<td>23%</td>
<td>85%</td>
<td>+62 pp</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mean max difference</td>
<td>3.93 pts</td>
<td>1.41 pts</td>
<td>-2.52 pts</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>Gemini lowered its grades by an average of 2 points after seeing Claude's and OpenAI's more rigorous assessments. It couldn't justify giving 17s when Claude was pointing to specific gaps in the experimentation discussion.</p>

<p><img alt="Grade convergence chart" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEg5fX5d3GQ2cOHfJpbT5os_5WBQSnb5iLSULS76cNn0LGOFq3RxpjyAu4sGJ2DEFMpo8_mWe9Vum1yzpLbfI82qK-m2yXDFQApP_X01G_fO0xFz-utUW3dHelb8XsqEHP3sgHNjxKAEKnZoCJDZkpJVneeF_ej0T8sq_HGm9YtWeE42I_hWkpfDDB1jbd8" width="624"></p>

<p>But here's what's interesting: the disagreement wasn't random. Problem Framing and Metrics had <strong>100% agreement</strong> within 1 point. Experimentation? Only <strong>57%</strong>.</p>

<p>Why? When students give clear, specific answers, graders agree. When students give vague hand-wavy answers, graders (human or AI) disagree on how much partial credit to give. The low agreement on experimentation reflects genuine ambiguity in student responses, not grader noise.</p>

<p><strong>The grading was stricter than my own default.</strong> That's not a bug. Students will be evaluated outside the university, and the world is not known for grade inflation.</p>

<p><strong>The feedback was better than any human would produce.</strong> The system generated structured "strengths / weaknesses / actions" summaries with verbatim quotes from the transcript. Sample feedback from the highest scorer:</p>

<blockquote>"Your understanding of metric trade-offs and Goodhart's Law risks was exceptional—the hot tub example perfectly illustrated how optimizing for one metric can corrupt another."</blockquote>

<p>Sample from a B- student:</p>

<blockquote>"Practice articulating complete A/B testing designs: state a hypothesis, define randomization unit, specify guardrail metrics, and establish decision criteria for shipping or rolling back."</blockquote>

<p>Specific. Actionable. Tied to evidence. No human grader has the time to generate that for every student.</p>

<hr>

<h2>It diagnosed our teaching gaps</h2>

<p>Ha! This one stung.</p>

<p><img alt="Topic performance chart" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEh-ISSQRlDyrhz1aF2SKnjX-NTTBv5nbkq4TyhFkKOc1FcZ80wHMrZ9YU7X62-9j-SfTpHT2VQDxuiE1bkKaOVIJ8zSRvLTi0hSAkvdC6h2-E-YA-MokZMoeVat-CGW1XD6lkhof8BpYY2bCymGz_A5x0lSvPBvlpX5DiTtqSzaZafdAJ8rkv_lv-Tu2sg" width="624"></p>

<p>When we analyzed performance by topic, one bar stuck out like a sore thumb: <strong>Experimentation</strong>. Mean score: 1.94 out of 4. Compare that to Problem Framing at 3.39.</p>

<p>The breakdown was brutal:</p>

<ul>
<li>3 students (8%) scored <strong>0</strong>—couldn't discuss it at all</li>
<li>7 students (19%) scored <strong>1</strong>—superficial understanding</li>
<li>15 students (42%) scored <strong>2</strong>—basic understanding</li>
<li>0 students scored <strong>4</strong>—no one demonstrated mastery</li>
</ul>

<p>We had rushed through A/B testing methodology in class. The external grader made it impossible to ignore.</p>

<p>The grading output became a mirror reflecting our own weaknesses as instructors. Ooof.</p>

<h3>Duration ≠ Quality</h3>

<p>One finding I found strangely fascinating: exam duration had <strong>zero correlation</strong> with score (r = -0.03). The shortest exam—9 minutes—got the highest score (19/20). The longest—64 minutes—scored 12/20.</p>

<p>Taking longer doesn't mean you know more. If anything, it signals struggling to articulate. Confidence is efficient.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Anti-cheating (or: trust but verify)</h2>

<p>We asked students to <strong>record themselves</strong> while taking the exam (webcam + audio). This discourages blatantly outsourcing the conversation, having multiple people in the room, or having an LLM in voice mode whispering answers. It also gives us a backup record in case something goes really badly.</p>

<p>And here is an underrated benefit of this whole setup: <strong>the exam is powered by guidelines, not by secret questions</strong>. We can publish exactly how the exam works—the structure, the skills being tested, the types of questions. No surprises. The LLM will pick the specific questions live, and the student will have to handle them.</p>

<p>This reduces anxiety and pushes students toward actual preparation instead of guessing what the instructor "wants." And it eliminates the leaked-exam problem entirely. Practice all you want—it will only make you better prepared.</p>

<hr>

<h2>What the students said</h2>

<p>We surveyed students before releasing grades to capture their experience. Some of the results:</p>

<ul>
<li>Only 13% preferred the AI oral format. 57% wanted traditional written exams. 83% found it more stressful.</li>
<li>But here's the thing: 70% agreed it tested their actual understanding: the highest-rated item. They accepted the assessment but not the delivery.</li>
<li>At the same time, they almost universally liked the flexibility of taking the exam at their own place and time. Yes, many of them would have also preferred a take-home exam instead of the oral exam, but this format is dead now.</li>
<li>83% of students found the oral exam framework more stressful than a written exam.</li>
<li>The fix is clear: one question at a time, slower pacing, calmer tone. The concept works. The execution needs iteration.</li>
</ul>

<p><img alt="Student survey results" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEioSGC7USjzXprYZmvEnHsw7YX4xupGXSpKcWxwW1q61PXBHOZyxWr6pO8yEZrjZ0oJQyu6YlidYODZIvg0gQcMkJWPtwwJxCHMJfTejXod4mmo1lDGeol3Wsk-OfhVpmYIOXNB48R-kfahm5MQw9upxYYTdJR7aZS2jIHBPb9Zea9Cbl9KQyOO9jvUKaA" width="624"></p>

<hr>

<h2>Try it yourself</h2>

<p>If you want to experiment with this approach, here are some resources:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://gist.github.com/ipeirotis/0d9d5747e6270cf6d65a6bf9d162e421">Prompt for the voice agent</a></li>
<li><a href="https://gist.github.com/ipeirotis/99418caa6afae72fb7eec63855632c68">Prompt for the grading council</a></li>
<li><a href="https://elevenlabs.io/app/talk-to?agent_id=agent_8101k9d1pq41f3rs8d9g9143dvvr&amp;vars=eyJzdHVkZW50IjoiS29uc3RhbnRpbm9zIFJpemFrb3MiLCAibmV0aWQiOiJrcjg4OCIsICJwcm9qZWN0aWQiOiJCIn0=">Link to try the voice agent</a> <em>(use Konstantinos as the name and kr888 as the net id to authenticate; the project was a "LinkedIn Recruiter, a</em><i>n agent that scans profiles and automatically sends personalized DMs to candidates on behalf of a recruiter. It engages in the first 3 turns of chat to answer basic questions (salary, location) before handing off to a human."</i><em>)</em></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>What I would change next time</h2>

<ol>
<li><strong>Slower pacing and a calmer voice:</strong> We love you FakeFoster, but GenZ is not ready for you. Perhaps we will deploy FakePanos next time. Too bad ElevenLabs hasn't perfected thick accents yet to deliver a real Panos experience.</li>
<li><strong>RAG over student artifacts</strong> (slides, reports, notebooks). ElevenLabs supports this directly. If the agent can quote the student's own submission, the exam becomes much harder to game and much more diagnostically useful.</li>
<li><strong>Better case randomization</strong> with explicit seeding and tracking. Randomness that "feels random" is not enough. Pass explicit parameters.</li>
<li><strong>Audit triggers in grading.</strong> If the LLM committee disagrees beyond a threshold, flag for human review. The point of a committee is not to pretend the result is always certain; it is to surface uncertainty.</li>
<li><strong>Accessibility defaults.</strong> Offer practice runs, allow extra time, and provide alternatives when voice interaction creates unnecessary barriers.</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<h2>The bigger point</h2>

<p>Take-home exams are dead. Reverting to pen-and-paper exams in the classroom feels like a regression.</p><p>We need assessments that evolve towards formats that reward understanding, decision-making, and real-time reasoning. Oral exams used to be standard until they could not scale. Now, AI is making them scalable again.</p>

<p>And here is the delicious part: you can give the whole setup to the students and let them prepare for the exam by practicing it multiple times. Unlike traditional exams, where leaked questions are a disaster, here the questions are generated fresh each time. The more you practice, the better you get. That is... actually how learning is supposed to work.</p>

<p>Fight fire with fire.</p>

<hr>

<p><em>Thanks to Brian Jabarian for the inspiration and for giving us confidence that these interviews will work, Foster Provost for lending his voice to create the FakeFoster agent (sorry, students found you intimidating!), and Andrej Karpathy for the council-of-LLMs idea.</em></p>

                <p>Published by Martin Kleppmann on 07 Mar 2011.</p>
                

                <p>Every educated person really ought to have a basic understanding of accounting. Just like
maths, science, programming, music, literature, history, etc., it’s one of those things
which helps you make sense of the world. Although dealing with money is not much fun, it’s
an unavoidable part of life, so you might as well take a few minutes to understand it.</p>

<p>Sadly, in my opinion, most accountants do a terrible job of explaining their work in an
accessible way; it’s a field full of jargon, acronyms and weird historical legacies. Even
“Bookkeeping for Dummies” makes my head spin. Surely this stuff can’t be that difficult?</p>

<p>(We computing people are probably guilty of the same offence of bad explanations and jargon.
The problem is, once you have become intimately familiar with a field, it’s very hard to
imagine how you thought about things before you understood it.)</p>

<p>Eventually I figured it out: basic accounting is just graph theory. The traditional ways
of representing financial information hide that structure astonishingly well, but once I
had figured out that it was just a graph, it suddenly all made sense.</p>

<p>I’m a computer scientist, and I think of stuff in graphs all the time. If only someone had
explained it like that in the first place! It would have saved me so much confusion. So I
want to try to fix that. If you like graphs, then by the time you reach the end of this
article, you should know everything you need in order to understand the financial statements
for a small company/startup (and even calculate them yourself, in a spreadsheet or
programming language of your choice).</p>

<p>It’s really not that hard. Let’s go!</p>

<p><strong>Accounts = Nodes, Transactions = Edges</strong></p>

<p>Say you go to the bagel shop and buy a Super Club bagel for $5 on the company credit card.
You also visit some random Silicon Valley startup and buy one of their surplus Aeron chairs, second
hand, for $500 (by writing a cheque from the company account). Those are two transactions.
Each transaction is an edge in our graph, and the edge is labelled with the amount.</p>

<p>An edge always goes from one node to another. What are those nodes? Well, you can define
them as you like (although there are some conventions). For now, let’s say:</p>

<p><a href="https://martin.kleppmann.com/2011/03/accounting1.dot.png">
  <img src="https://martin.kleppmann.com/2011/03/accounting1.dot.png" width="550" alt="Graph representation of accounts">
</a></p>

<p>Let’s add some more details. You pay the $5 credit card bill from the company account. And where
did the money in the company account come from in the first place? Ah, I see, you
put in $5,000 of your savings to start the company. Ok, now the graph looks like this:</p>

<p><a href="https://martin.kleppmann.com/2011/03/accounting2.dot.png">
  <img src="https://martin.kleppmann.com/2011/03/accounting2.dot.png" width="550" alt="Graph representation of accounts">
</a></p>

<p>Hopefully pretty self-explanatory so far. Money flows in the direction of the arrows.</p>

<p>Hungry once again, you go to the taqueria and buy a Super Burrito for $8 on the credit card.
Now we could create another node for the taqueria, but this is starting to get messy – we
don’t really care how much money we spent on bagels vs. how much on burritos. Let’s just
lump them together as “food”. Also, “Random startup” is a bit unhelpful – I’ve already
forgotten what those $500 were for. Let’s call it “furniture” instead.</p>

<p><a href="https://martin.kleppmann.com/2011/03/accounting3.dot.png">
  <img src="https://martin.kleppmann.com/2011/03/accounting3.dot.png" width="550" alt="Graph representation of accounts">
</a></p>

<p>See, that’s perfectly fine. We can have nodes which represent actual bank accounts or cards,
others which represent people or companies, and others again which represent abstract
categories like “food” or “furniture”. Just throw it all into the same graph.</p>

<p>Note also that you can have several edges between the same pair of nodes. You can keep track
of the individual edges, or you can simply add them up. (Using the credit card, you spent
a total of $13 on food.)</p>

<p><strong>Accounts have balances</strong></p>

<p>Every node in this graph is an <em>account</em> in accountant-speak (whether or not it is held by a bank),
and every account has a <em>balance</em>. The balance is a single number for each account, and it is
determined completely by the transactions in and out of the account:</p>

<ol>
  <li>At the beginning of time, the value at each node is zero.</li>
  <li>At each node, for each incoming edge, add the edge’s label to the node’s value; for each
outgoing edge, subtract the edge’s label from the value.</li>
</ol>

<p>After you’ve processed all the edges, the value at each node is that account’s balance. Our
graph now looks like this:</p>

<p><a href="https://martin.kleppmann.com/2011/03/accounting4.dot.png">
  <img src="https://martin.kleppmann.com/2011/03/accounting4.dot.png" width="550" alt="Graph representation of accounts">
</a></p>

<p>Note that the account balances have two nice properties:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Because every transaction appears twice – once positive and once negative – the sum of
all account balances is always zero.</li>
  <li>If you partition the set of nodes into any two disjoint sets, and add up all of the balances
in each set, then the sum for the one set is always the negative sum of the other set
(because, after all, they have to add up to zero).</li>
</ol>

<p>These properties are useful for sanity-checking your numbers; if they are violated,
<em>“ur doin it wrong”</em>. (This is what accountants mean when they talk about “balancing the books”.)</p>

<p><strong>Doing business</strong></p>

<p>Strengthened by a bagel and a burrito, you go out and talk to some potential customers. And hey,
they love your product! It has a price tag of $5,000, and you sell it to two big enterprise
customers. One pays you right away (good stuff!); the other gives you $2,500 up front, but insists
that before they pay the rest, you need to implement that additional feature you foolishly
promised.</p>

<p>So you received $5,000 + $2,500 in cash from your customers, wired straight the company bank
account. Let’s add that to the graph:</p>

<p><a href="https://martin.kleppmann.com/2011/03/accounting5.dot.png">
  <img src="https://martin.kleppmann.com/2011/03/accounting5.dot.png" width="550" alt="Graph representation of accounts">
</a></p>

<p>But that’s not quite right. The price was $5,000 for each customer, and now it looks like you
charged two different prices. How do we represent our arrangement with customer 2?</p>

<p>The solution is to deconstruct the deal into two separate transactions: the sale (in which
the buyer agrees to buy, but no actual money changes hands) and the payment (when the cash
actually hits your bank account). We can draw it like this:</p>

<p><a href="https://martin.kleppmann.com/2011/03/accounting6.dot.png">
  <img src="https://martin.kleppmann.com/2011/03/accounting6.dot.png" width="550" alt="Graph representation of accounts">
</a></p>

<p>See what I’ve done here? I’ve just made up a new node, generically called it “sales”, and
added the actual $5,000 sales as a transaction from this “sales” account to the customer
accounts. Adding this extra node hasn’t changed your bank balance.</p>

<p>This makes sense when you think about the intuitive meaning of the balances.
The balance of each customer’s account is the amount they owe you: customer 1
has fully paid up (their incoming and outgoing transactions add up to the same), so their balance
is zero; customer 2 has contractually agreed to give you $5,000, but has so far only given you
half of that, so their balance is $2,500.</p>

<p>And the balance on the sales account is the value of stuff you’ve sold. Or rather, the negative
value. That looks a bit weird… but I’ll come back to that later. (BTW, if you wanted to
separately track sales for different customers or different products, no problem — just
add whatever nodes make sense for you. Just make sure that every transaction appears only
once as an edge, otherwise you’re making stuff up!)</p>

<p><strong>Finishing off the example</strong></p>

<p>To round it off, let me add some more events to the story (= some more edges to the graph).</p>

<p>Not only have you made some sales, but now you also receive a $20,000 investment from
Y Combinator — congratulations! You and your co-founder can now afford to pay yourselves
a salary. You take $8,000 out of the company account.</p>

<p>Then you get set up with a company accountant, and they talk lots of jargon at you. For
some strange reason they are obsessed with correctly accounting for your office chair;
they want it to depreciate over four years, i.e. its value is gradually reduced to zero over
the course of that time. Fair enough, you say (even though you couldn’t care less what your
chair will be worth in four years’ time — surely by that time you’ll be the next Google
or Facebook, and you’ll have other things to worry about than chairs).</p>

<p>The resulting graph now looks like this:</p>

<p><a href="https://martin.kleppmann.com/2011/03/accounting7.dot.png">
  <img src="https://martin.kleppmann.com/2011/03/accounting7.dot.png" width="550" alt="Graph representation of accounts">
</a></p>

<p>Note how I have represented the transactions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I have lumped together your founder investment with that of Y Combinator, under the
heading of “capital”. Put simply, this is money you got into the company by selling your
company’s shares, rather than by selling a product or service to a customer. As usual,
you can split founders and YC into separate accounts if you feel like it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I’ve represented payroll (salaries) as just money straight out of the bank account. In
reality it’s a bit more complicated due to taxes, healthcare, benefits, etc. but the
principles stay the same. It’s just more nodes and edges in the graph.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I made depreciation for one year (one quarter of $500 = $125) go <em>away</em> from the
“furniture” account. Intuitively, this means that the balance of the “furniture” account
is the value that your furniture still has now. Each year, you add another $125 edge
from “furniture” to “depreciation”, until after four years, the balance of “furniture”
drops to zero (assuming you haven’t bought any more chairs in the meantime, in your quest
for world domination).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The profit and loss statement</strong></p>

<p>At this point, if you’re getting weary, I don’t blame you. But the good news: we’ve finished
building our graph! Now I will show you how this graph representation maps to two standard
financial statements most commonly used in managing a company: the profit and loss statement
(“P&amp;L”), and the balance sheet. This is useful, because as a startup founder you’ll sooner
or later have to discuss these documents with your investors/advisors, and so you might as
well learn what the hell they mean.</p>

<p>In order to produce these statements, I need to get out the crayons. Here is the same graph
as before, with the nodes coloured in:</p>

<p><a href="https://martin.kleppmann.com/2011/03/accounting8.dot.png">
  <img src="https://martin.kleppmann.com/2011/03/accounting8.dot.png" width="550" alt="Graph representation of accounts">
</a></p>

<p>Explaining the colours (putting the accounting terminology in brackets, since you’re likely to
encounter these words):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Green for <strong>stuff that you have</strong> (<em>“assets”</em>), e.g. money in the bank, or things which you
bought and you could sell again, such as furniture. Also green for people/companies who
<strong>owe you money</strong> (<em>“debtors”</em>, such as Customer 2), and people/companies to whom <strong>you owe
money</strong> (<em>“liabilities”/”creditors”</em>, such as your upcoming credit card bill for that burrito).</li>
  <li>Blue for <strong>sales of your product/service</strong> (<em>“revenue”</em>) and <strong>money you spent</strong> that you’re not going
to get back (<em>“expenses”/”overheads”</em>). The office chair is green, because you could sell it
again if you wanted to, but the bagel is blue, because once you’ve bought (and eaten) the
bagel, that’s it – no going back.</li>
  <li>Pink for <strong>money from investors</strong> (or yourself) that you got by selling shares (<em>“capital”</em>).
(If you get a bank loan, that’s green, not pink, because you owe the bank to pay it back.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Every one of your nodes should fall into exactly one of these categories. If not, something
has gone wrong, or you have discovered some bit of the accounting world that I don’t yet know
about.</p>

<p>With these colours set, the profit and loss statement is simply <strong>a list of all the blue nodes</strong>,
and the profit or loss of the company is the sum of all of the blue nodes’ balances. The way we’ve
calculated things, a negative value is a profit, and a positive value is a loss. That’s confusing,
so you typically flip the sign when reporting the number (so that a profit is positive).</p>

<p>Written in the standard way, our P&amp;L looks like this:</p>

<table>
  <tbody><tr>
    <th rowspan="2">Revenue</th>
    <td>Sales</td>
    <td>$10,000</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Total revenue</th>
    <th>$10,000</th>
  </tr>
  <tr></tr>
  <tr>
    <th rowspan="4">Expenses</th>
    <td>Payroll</td>
    <td>$8,000</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Depreciation</td>
    <td>$125</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Food</td>
    <td>$13</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Total expenses</th>
    <th>$8,138</th>
  </tr>
  <tr></tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Total</th>
    <th>Profit/Loss</th>
    <th>$1,862</th>
    <td>(= total revenue - total expenses)</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>The meaning is fairly intuitive. You sold $10,000 worth of stuff, and spent only $8,138 in the
process, so you made $1,862 profit.</p>

<p>The profit and loss statement is calculated over a period of time (usually a month, a quarter or a
year), and it’s often interesting to compare two different periods. To calculate it for a period,
filter your transactions to only include those which occurred within that period, and add up the
account balances for just those transactions.</p>

<p>One thing to watch out for: profit doesn’t say anything about your bank account. The bank account
is a green node, but we’re only looking at blue nodes here. In this example, you ended up with
$23,995 in the bank, even though investors put in $25,000: you made a profit, yet still have less
money in the bank than you did before, because Customer 2 hasn’t yet fully paid. That’s why it’s
possible for a company to be profitable but still run out of money!</p>

<p><strong>The Balance Sheet</strong></p>

<p>The balance sheet is a bit less intuitive than the P&amp;L, but it’s quite a powerful document. It
summarises what the company currently has and doesn’t have, and why.</p>

<p>Remember what I said earlier about partitioning the nodes into two disjoint sets, and their
summed balances adding to zero? That’s exactly what happens on the balance sheet. We take all of
the nodes in the graph; on the one side we consider all of the green nodes, and on the other side
all the blue and pink nodes. The sum of all of the blue and pink nodes’ balances is minus the sum
of all of the green nodes’ balances.</p>

<p>Now, by convention, accountants flip the sign on all of the blue and pink nodes’ balances, which
means that the two sums end up being equal. And that’s why it’s called a balance sheet.</p>

<p>In our example, it looks like this:</p>

<table>
  <tbody><tr>
    <th rowspan="4">Assets</th>
    <td>Bank account</td>
    <td>$23,995</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Debtors</td>
    <td>$2,500</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Furniture</td>
    <td>$375</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Total assets</th>
    <th>$26,870</th>
  </tr>
  <tr></tr>
  <tr>
    <th rowspan="2">Liabilities</th>
    <td>Credit card</td>
    <td>$8</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Total liabilities</th>
    <th>$8</th>
  </tr>
  <tr></tr>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="2">Total assets less total liabilities</th>
    <th>$26,862</th>
  </tr>
  <tr></tr>
  <tr>
    <th rowspan="3">Equity</th>
    <td>Profit/Loss</td>
    <td>$1,862</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Capital</td>
    <td>$25,000</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Total equity</th>
    <th>$26,862</th>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>The top block (assets and liabilities) corresponds to the green nodes in the graph, whilst
the bottom block contains the pink node (capital) and the sum of all of the blue nodes. We already
showed all of the detail for the blue nodes on the Profit and Loss statement above; on the balance
sheet we can sum them all up to a single number.</p>

<p>Some more sign-flipping has occurred here: I’ve written liabilities, equity and P&amp;L with their
signs flipped (which usually, but not always, has the effect of making the numbers positive).
That doesn’t change anything fundamental about the graph structure, it just puts things into the
conventional schema.</p>

<p>So how can you interpret the balance sheet? There are various things you can read from it. You can
see how much money is in the bank, and how much of that money has already been promised to other
people (liabilities). You can see how much of the money in the bank came from investors, vs. how
much came from sales. And it shows how much money is due to come in soon, from sales that have
closed but haven’t yet been fully paid.</p>

<p>The total of the balance sheet is a lower bound on the value of your company. It’s a very
pessimistic figure — it assumes that your team, your technology, your brand etc. are all worth
precisely nothing; if your company raises money from investors, your valuation will be much higher
than the balance sheet figure, since that valuation includes the value of team, technology, brand
etc in the form of a wild guess. In established companies you can find “intangible assets” on the
balance sheet, but since they are very hard to value, I suspect it’s not worth bothering with
unless you know what you are doing.</p>

<p>That’s the end of our whirlwind tour through the world of accounting. If you’re a real accountant

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2><img alt="Black smartphone with clock app on screen and 'Punkt' branding on back" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0906/3147/1490/files/punkt_mc03_smartphone_main_image_ec4174e6-52bc-4a63-b97c-59fe5974d345.webp?v=1767194285"></h2>
<p><em><b>Made in Europe</b>, the MC03 has an updated and more sustainable design and evolved features, with security and privacy at its heart.</em></p>
<p><strong>2 January 2026, Lugano, Switzerland / CES, Las Vegas.</strong> <strong> <a href="https://www.punkt.ch/"> Punkt.</a> </strong>, the Swiss-based pioneer of beautifully designed, minimalist smartphones that give users privacy without friction, will be present at CES with its latest model, the <a href="https://www.punkt.ch/products/mc03-premium-secure-smartphone">MC03</a>. This unique device, powered by AphyOS and housed within a German-built precision handset, follows through on Punkt.’s well known commitment to intentional tech use and data ownership.</p>
<p>Like its forerunner, the MC02, the new model is a subscription-based smartphone that offers users the tools and apps that are most important to them in an environment where they control access to their data and usage.</p>
<p>Using the Punkt. MC03, users can put privacy first with two defined repositories for depositing data. The first is named <b>Vault</b>, a protected enclave containing only trusted, Punkt.-approved apps and offering maximum privacy by default with a calm, design-focused user interface. The second, termed <b>Wild Web</b>, provides the freedom to install any app, but with strict, visible safeguards that allow easy privacy controls and can prevent data triangulation and unauthorized data flows.</p>
<p><i>“Privacy is being sought by people more than ever before, particularly as we enter the age of AI,”</i> said <b>Petter Neby, Founder and CEO at Punkt</b>. <i>“They are stressed and overwhelmed by the determination of Big Tech to track and monetise their every online movement. Punkt. offers them a solution – a modern, premium device without the need to compromise on their privacy.”</i></p>
<p>The MC03 features a new look and feel to its operating system allowing users to stay laser-focused on getting the best experience. AphyOS cuts out tracking and profiling technology, bloatware, hidden apps and unwieldy background services. It eliminates spying and runs hardened code to block attacks, assisted by a bank-grade Secure Element.</p>
<p>With the MC03, Punkt. is building a secure smartphone ecosystem where privacy is not an add-on, but the default. Supported by trusted partners such as <a href="https://threema.com/en"><b>Threema</b></a> and, new for MC03, <a href="https://proton.me/"><b>Proton</b></a>, these services feature in the device’s Vault space.</p>
<p>Trusted services including <b>Proton Mail, Proton Calendar, Proton Drive, Proton VPN</b> and <b>Proton Pass</b> are available in an environment designed to minimize data exposure and tracking.</p>
<p>Punkt. and Proton are ideal partners, both leading within the <b>Swiss Tech movement</b> (<i>with Swiss Tech you pay to retain your data, with Big Tech you pay with your data</i>), operating independently and built around the principle that users, not platforms, control their own data.</p>
<p><b><i>Andy Yen, Founder and CEO of Proton</i></b> said, <i>“People deserve choice. Choice over the phone they use, the software they rely on and who they share their data with. By working with likeminded companies like Punkt., we can give users more ways to regain control of their privacy.”</i></p>
<h3>Among other features of the MC03:</h3>
<p><b>The App Hub</b></p>
<p>Two app stores are available:</p>

<div><p>Gobii AI | Senior Software Engineer | REMOTE (US) | gobii.ai</p><p>Gobii is the easiest way to deploy browser-use agents in the cloud or on-premises. We're building an open-core AI workforce platform—browser-native agents and automation tools. We have paying customers.</p><p>The entire team contributes to browser-use. We also have contributors to Apache NiFi, LiteLLM, and RA.Aid (open-source coding agent I created). Open source is core to how we build and how we think. We're backed by Open Core Ventures.</p><p>HQ is San Francisco, but much of the team is in the DC area. East Coast timezone preferred, DC area even better—but we're fully remote.</p><p>What we're building: The orchestration layer for browser-use and AI agents. Systems that navigate, reason, and execute on the real web.</p><p>Who we're looking for: You've built agentic systems that shipped to production. You have opinions about tool use, context management, and why most "agents" are just glorified prompt chains. You strongly prefer working in the open—a significant part of this role is contributing to OSS repos. We strongly prefer candidates with existing open source contributions.</p><p>Why now: We have strong traction and are expanding the team. You'd be early—with real influence over product, architecture, and how we work. High autonomy, high trust, small team of people who know what they're doing.</p><p>Comp: Cash + healthcare + modest 401k match + options. In line with SF-based VC-backed startups at pre-seed stage.</p><p>Stack: TypeScript, Python, browser automation, LLM orchestration.</p><p>Email: careers@gobii.ai (subject: "HN")</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46467697"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_46467697" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46467697&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46466074"></a></center></td><td><br>

We work fully on-site in Bilbao because the complexity of our problems (high-performance computing + biological nuances) requires high-bandwidth, in-person collaboration.</p><p>We are hiring for two core roles:</p><p>1. Senior Go Engineer: You will build distributed systems for high-load genomic data processing. This is not CRUD. We need someone who understands memory management, concurrency, and algorithmic efficiency at scale.</p><p>2. Bioinformatics Developer (Antibody Discovery): You will work on the scientific core, developing blocks for NGS data analysis and antibody structure prediction. You should be fluent in both code and biology.</p><p>The Offer:</p><p>Comp: Top-tier EU salaries (~€90k - €120k).</p><p>Tax Advantage: Bizkaia has independent tax autonomy. You qualify for the "Special Impatriate Regime" (30% salary tax exemption + expense deductions).</p><p>The Reality: Your effective tax rate drops to ~15-20%, yielding a significantly higher net income than London or Berlin.</p><p>Stock: We grant ESOP and treat equity as a life-changing wealth vehicle, not a "nice to have."</p><p>Relocation: Comprehensive "Soft Landing" package (Visa, temporary housing, school search).</p><p>Location: Bilbao is a hidden gem—ocean, mountains, and high quality of life with a low cost of living.</p><p>Process: No HR screening.

<div><p>MixRank (YC S11) | Software Engineers | 100% REMOTE (Global) | Full-Time MixRank processes petabytes of data every month from web crawling. We have hundreds of customers using our data products including Google, Amazon, Facebook, Intel, and Adobe, across industries including Finance, Recruiting, Sales, Marketing, and Security.
We’re a fully-remote company with a global footprint in over 20 countries. We're growing, profitable, employee-owned, no dependence on outside funding. Applicants from all geographies and backgrounds are welcome.</p><p>We are looking for passionate individuals for whom programming is not just a job but it’s something they love to do. We're obsessed with computers, programming, big data, databases, compilers, hardware, math, data science, and the internet. Does this sound like you? Please apply to join our team.</p><p>Our code base is very friendly to new contributors. You'll have a fully-functional development environment within hours (fully automated) and be pushing commits on your first day. Deployments to production happen multiple times per day and finish in less than 2 minutes. Effectively all of our codebase is written in Python, Rust, SQL, Javascript/TypeScript, and Nix. The core technologies you'll need familiarity with to be productive are Python, PostgreSQL, Linux, and Git.</p><p>We operate at a larger scale than typical startups. We operate two datacenters with high performance servers we've built that are capable of dealing with the volumes of data we process. We've implemented our own distributed file system. We do full-scale web crawls. We download and perform static analysis on the entire universe of Android APKs and iOS IPAs that are published. Unlike a typical startup where you'll spend half of your time in meetings, and the other half fixing bugs from Jira tickets— at MixRank you'll get to challenge yourself with difficult technical problems that will help you to grow as an individual.</p><p>We're hiring continuously for the positions below— they aren't singular positions that will close once filled. Our philosophy on hiring is that the candidate is more important than the position. For each new member of the team, we design a custom role and responsibilities that are specialized to their interests. Other companies will come up with a long list of specific requirements for a position with the expectation that you'll exactly replace someone from the team, or that you'll be the perfect tetris piece that satisfies the job requirements decided by a committee. MixRank is more pragmatic: we'll first get excited about having a unique individual on the team, then we'll figure out the best way to accommodate their specific talents.</p><p>-- Junior Software Engineer - Remote (Global), Full-Time</p><p>We're looking for remote junior engineers that have 0-3 years of professional experience in software, and 5+ years of curiosity exploring computers, programming, and technical hobby projects.

I worked at companies of all kinds, from seed-stage startups to literal FAANG. I always end up working in close interaction with product people, stakeholders, and (if lucky enough) prospective users. I'm used to working cross-functionally and cross-team, improving communication, coordinating work of several teams to build and operate the thing which the business needs. I prefer building the right thing without haste, but know how to prioritize shipping the most impactful changes sooner. I value autonomy and high impact. I built things from a nebulous idea to a final implementation and production launch. I evolved large existing systems, including frontend, backend, and databases. I'm glad to communicate with people, to mentor fellow engineers when appropriate, to coordinate work, but I'm not trying to become a full-time people manager. My north star is people like John Carmack or Rob Pike.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46473323"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_46473323" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46473323&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46466073"></a></center></td><td><br>

I am transitioning out of my role of CTO and am exploring opportunities. I have 15 years of web experience building CMS and CRM for small and large companies.</p><p>As a co-founder (as well as my prior years), I wore many hats and spent countless hours as a result I can architect and design large codebases, hire and retain talent, lead and manage teams and set company-wide goals. I built and managed an engineering team located all around the globe and built a platform empowering small and medium businesses to run their operations; the company is entering a new phase of growth and it is the right time for me to find opportunities that aligns with my personal goals.</p><p>I am looking for a role at an established company. The bigger the problem, the more exciting. A perfect role for my profile may be one that blends my experience of building a successful B2B2C startup (building teams, product and software) and my experience of building B2B tools at a large company (Twitter).</p><p>If you need someone that can be an immediate value-add, bringing a ton of firepower, solving big problems and rallying teams to move mountains: hit me up!</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46472554"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_46472554" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46472554&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46466073"></a></center></td><td><br>

That said, I'm willing to consider a position with a great fit for my skill set and career goals.</p><p>Here's my pitch: I have experience in a multitude of industries and positions. From improving legacy infra and processes in an established telco company to scaling a fast-moving startup from 200K to 2M users. In my free time, I love writing Code That Is Poetry but day-to-day I am not an idealist engineer who doesn't compromise. Well-engineered code is clean and correct but correct above all else.</p><p>Oh, also, I'm great at writing documentation. I consider myself introverted but apparently my communication skills are above average for Software Engineers. I also pride myself on my humility and modesty.</p><p>I'm currently a backend engineer developing features and improving infra for an online game with millions of daily active users. I'd love to explore other technical positions in the games industry short of joining a AAA studio because (a) I don't want to crunch and (b) my skill set does not lay that way; other tech-creative industries would also appeal to me! Another particular interest is in B2C businesses where the 'C' is software developers.

Hi, I'm Harry Altman! I was the maintainer of Truffle Debugger (<a href="https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/tree/develop/package" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/tree/develop/package</a>...), a Solidity smart contract debugger, for 5 years. I eventually ended up writing my own decoding and encoding libraries to support it, as well as a bunch of other things.</p><p>I'm good at this sort of nitpicky work, spotting and thinking about edge cases. I like getting things exactly right, even though that obviously isn't always possible due to various constraints. I've been kind of wondering if I should get into embedded development; I find it appealing when things are low-level or similarly constrained. I've beaten Microcorruption. :) (The original levels, I haven't played the new ones.)</p><p>I'm also quite interested in unusual or obscure data formats, and working on Truffle Debugger and its associated libraries certainly involved a bunch of having to figure undocumented formats and interfaces. :) I put down above what languages I've worked substantially in but I'd say I'm a generalist and will figure out whatever you give me (I knew approximately no Javascript, Typescript, or Solidity when I started working at Consensys).</p><p>I'm a mathematician by background and in my spare time, so after the Truffle Debugger project was shut down I took some time off to focus on my mathematical projects. But now I'm looking for work again!

My experience has been quite broad in that time but my recent focuses in my spare time have been Python/Flask, and C/C++ (for a homebrew project on an old console that I enjoy contributing to) but my initial experience was with Java; the first thing I wrote was a CraftBukkit plugin that ended up getting over a million downloads.</p><p>I'd consider myself very good at quickly familiarising myself with unfamiliar frameworks/languages, so even if it's something I'm not experienced in, I would be more than willing to do a take-home, or something similar (which I enjoy, esp. if it's something new to me).</p><p>Looking for and would be grateful for any opportunities, including non-SWE, e.g. I.T., or even something non-technical if your company is hiring for other roles.</p><p>I do not use LLMs for any work or projects of mine, or prose I've written (personal preference, not a moral viewpoint).</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46470808"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_46470808" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46470808&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46466073"></a></center></td><td><br>

Seattle-based full-stack engineer open to remote, hybrid, or in-office roles. Willing to relocate and actively interested in doing so.</p><p>My experience spans production full-stack web applications (Postgres, Express, React, Node), cloud infrastructure on AWS and GCP, browser automation using Selenium, and Windows desktop tooling with Tkinter and PyInstaller.</p><p>I’m currently operating as a consultant, working across technical implementation and customer-facing responsibilities, and I’m comfortable partnering closely with sales and non-technical stakeholders. Clients range from startups that nobody’s heard of to aerospace manufacturers that everybody’s heard of.  I’m happy to sign NDA’s and bill against PO’s, but I would prefer a full-time W2 role.

My most recent W2 position was as a Patent Examiner in AI (Art Unit 2121) at the USPTO.</p><p>A defining part of my background is teaching computer science at Central Washington University.

12+ years of experience building iOS and macOS apps of all kinds.
Dropped business school in 2014 when I got hired into a growing startup and moved to SF. Eventually cofounded and built an early crypto app and raised a small seed. Hired 3 people but legal issues sunk us after a year or two. Joined an international crypto exchange and rebuilt their iOS app from the ground up in Swift, hired a team around it (8 people) and managed it all as the iOS Tech Lead for 4+ years until mid-2023.

I do dev/devops/security, usually for startups or scale-ups or other small orgs with limited resources, and I've been doing that for 15+ years. So, if you:</p><p>* Have a slow web application that’s often down?</p><p>* Want to improve security and don’t know where to start?</p><p>* Have a legacy system that needs to be replaced?</p><p>* Are considering an acquisition but not sure about the technical side?</p><p>I can help with that.

Background:</p><p>Deep knowledge of OpenAI, Anthropic + LLM APIs. Able to run models on GPUs and Apple Silicon unified memory. I have trained + deployed agentic coding, tool calling and multi-turn agent models in two prior roles.</p><p>Building autonomous agent infrastructure. Currently run a small R&amp;D shop (Distributed, Systems &amp; Co.) doing distributed AGI and AI safety research. I am developing graphsub (graph substrate), a graph-native service mesh for agents, eval harnesses, self-modifying DSLs.</p><p>Before that: 4 years at Goldman Sachs deep in SecDB/Slang (the reactive dependency-graph system). I worked on collateralized mortgage obligations, on the interest rate products trading desk (as an engineer in the technology division), automated parts of the downstream IR-swap lifecycle and on CDS lifecycle management for novations and other lifecycle events. Had a hand in managing and working on our internal TriOptima notional compression cycles. I got promoted from tech into structuring. Series 7.</p><p>Recent work: 15-service LLM stack (zero downtime across 98 deploys), fine-tuned Llama-3.1-8B (23% hallucination reduction), Rust daemons and TUIs. 3k+ GitHub contributions last year.</p><p>OSS: agents.erl (BEAM-native cognition), <a href="https://github.com/arthurcolle/openai-mcp" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/arthurcolle/openai-mcp</a>, fortitude (a framework for bootstrapping agents), <a href="https://github.com/arthurcolle/dspy.ex" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/arthurcolle/dspy.ex</a></p><p>Looking for: AI labs, defense tech, or startups building agentic systems / foundation model infra / AI safety tooling. IC or research roles.</p><p>I can run SFT and RL experiments, train models, and I'd love to be able to train agentic models and ideally with large GPU clusters.

Hi, I'm Vincent, an engineer with 10+ years of experience working in all parts of the engineering stack. Most recently I've worked on the front end side of things and am specialized in using React professionally, but I'm quick to pick up new technologies as necessary. (personally I prefer Svelte when working on my own projects) Go and Typescript are my two favorite languages. I've consistently been told by my managers that I work fast or was one of the best engineers they had on their team.</p><p>Personally I'm looking for a job that I feel like actually has some kind of positive benefit on the world, or something that seems particularly challenging or interesting. This can range anywhere from a note-taking application to managing retirement funds to writing a Typescript to Go compiler to writing a new database. I'm not interested in one of the 5 million AI hype cycle jobs (partly because I dislike LLMs), and I actively hate the blockchain, ads, and tracking users. I do not, and will never, compromise on privacy issues.</p><p>A list of things you should know about me and how I'm going to do my best work for you:</p><p>* I want to be able to work on something a bit more interesting than another simple REST application.</p><p>* I want my hours to be flexible, meaning when I start/end or being able to take some time in the middle of the day for groceries or a doctors appointment.</p><p>* I want to be able to come up with ideas I think would be useful/interesting and be given some time to work on them. I know that there are things I'm going to have to do for the business that aren't going to be these things, but I need some amount of time to do this or I'm going to struggle as a worker.</p><p>* I'm going to have strong opinions about all sorts of things, and I expect to be able to have a conversation about them and not just be dismissed.</p><p>* I'm going to want to improve things, and if I continuously get told "no", it's going to kill my morale.</p><p>I've previously lived in Japan a couple decades ago and studied the language intensively for 2 years at that time in one of the schools dedicated to helping foreigners go to university or get jobs there. (specifically at: 東京平田日本語学院. I almost passed JLPT N2 then, but I'm nowhere close to that level currently) I've recently been picking back up on studying Japanese again to maybe fulfill a long-held dream of going back to Japan longer than a vacation. So on the off chance you're someone in Japan hiring for a position you think I'd be a fit for (and you're not a black company), please reach out.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46466580"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_46466580" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46466580&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46466073"></a></center></td><td><br>

Hello ^_^</p><p>I'm open to a new job. My main goal is learning, so I'm particularly interested in roles that would let me learn more about technologies and topics I am interested in.</p><p>I have a Master's in Mathematics, with a specialization in Discrete Maths and Theoretical Computer Science. I really enjoy Logic and Number Theory, so I'd be very keen to work on things like formal verification or cryptography. You can find my master's thesis on my website. I'm also interested in compilers and applications of graph theory to computer networks and operating systems.</p><p>I have ample professional experience with Go, and have dabbled a fair amount with Rust, a somewhat smaller amount with Elixir, Clojure and ClojureScript in my spare time. I'd be very interested in continuing my exploration of Clojure and ClojureScript, or building more with Elixir or Rust.</p><p>I use the FreeBSD operating system as my daily driver, and would be thrilled to use it professionally as well. I also have ample experience with Linux, having used Ubuntu and Debian as daily drivers, and Debian in a professional context for years.</p><p>In terms of what I can offer, I'm honest, I'm kind, I'm motivated, rigorous and curious. I'm a good writer, and I enjoy writing documentation, and technical texts.  I have over five years of experience as a professional developer, I have written a LOT of Go code, and I'm comfortable debugging complex systems.</p><p>I can collaborate on large projects, having worked full time at a large tech company for several years and made a few open-source contributions.</p><p>I can work well with clients - I spent over a year working as a salesperson in a very busy Paris H&amp;M. While there, my then manager gave me what is, over 7 years later, still my favorite professional feedback: "you get along with everyone".</p><p>you can find my personal site at

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p><span>Feature</span> In the early 1990s, internetworking wonks realized the world was not many years away from running out of Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) addresses, the numbers needed to identify any device connected to the public internet. Noting booming interest in the internet, the internet community went looking for ways to avoid an IP address shortage that many feared would harm technology adoption and therefore the global economy.</p>
<p>A possible fix arrived in December 1995 in the form of <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1883">RFC 1883</a>, the first definition of IPv6, the planned successor to IPv4.</p>
<p>The most important change from IPv4 to IPv6 was moving from 32-bit to 128-bit addresses, a decision that increased the available pool of IP addresses from around 4.3 billion to over 340 undecillion – a 39-digit number. IPv6 was therefore thought to have future-proofed the internet, because nobody could imagine humanity would ever need more than a handful of undecillion IP addresses, never mind the entire range available under IPv6.</p>

    

<p>As billions of devices and people came online, first using PCs and then wielding smartphones, conventional wisdom assumed that network operators would move to IPv6 rather than persist with IPv4.</p>

        


        

<p>Yet according to data from <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/ipv6/statistics.html#tab=ipv6-adoption">Google</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://stats.labs.apnic.net/ipv6/XA">the Asia Pacific Network Information Center (APNIC)</a>, and <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/adoption-and-usage">Cloudflare</a>, less than half of all netizens use IPv6 today.</p>
<p>To understand why, know that IPv6 also suggested other, rather modest, changes to the way networks operate.</p>

        

<p>"IPv6 was an extremely conservative protocol that changed as little as possible," APNIC chief scientist Geoff Huston told <em>The Register</em>. "It was a classic case of mis-design by committee."</p>
<p>And that notional committee made one more critical choice: IPv6 was not backward-compatible with IPv4, meaning users had to choose one or the other – or decide to run both in parallel.</p>
<p>For many, the decision of which protocol to use was easy because IPv6 didn't add features that represented major improvements.</p>

        

<p>"One big surprise to me was how few features went into IPv6 in the end, aside from the massive expansion of address space," said Bruce Davie, a veteran computer scientist recently honored with a <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.sigcomm.org/awards/sigcomm-award-recipients">lifetime achievement award</a> by the Association for Computing Machinery's Special Interest Group on Data Communications, which lauded him for "fundamental contributions in networking systems through design, standardization, and commercialization of network protocols and systems."</p>
<p>Davie said many of the security, plug-and-play, and quality of service features that didn't make it into IPv6 were eventually implemented in IPv4, further reducing the incentive to adopt the new protocol. "Given the small amount of new functionality in v6, it's not so surprising that deployment has been a 30 year struggle," he said.</p>
<p>Another innovation that meant IPv6 made less sense was network address translation (NAT), which allows many devices to share a single public IPv4 address. NAT meant IPv4 network operators could connect thousands of devices with a single IP address, meaning their existing IP addresses became more useful.</p>
<p>"These solutions were relatively easy to deploy, aligned with existing expertise, and avoided large-scale infrastructure changes," said Alvaro Vives, manager of the learning and development team at RIPE NCC, the regional internet registry for 76 nations across Europe, the Middle East, and Central Asia.</p>
<p>Because NAT stalled IPv6 adoption, vendors didn't rally behind the new protocol.</p>
<p>"Migration costs, complexity, and training requirements remain high, while short-term ROI is low," Gartner distinguished VP analyst Andrew Lerner told <em>The Register</em>. "Performance parity across applications and devices is inconsistent, and some organizations even disable IPv6 for better performance. Lack of dual-stack support in legacy infrastructure is another barrier," he added.</p>
<h3>A misunderstood protocol</h3>
<p>While IPv6 didn't take off as expected, it's not fair to say it failed.</p>
<p>"IPv6 wasn't about turning IPv4 off, but about ensuring the internet could continue to grow without breaking," said John Curran, president and CEO of the American Registry for Internet Numbers (ARIN).</p>
<p>"In fact, IPv4's continued viability is largely because IPv6 absorbed that growth pressure elsewhere – particularly in mobile, broadband, and cloud environments," he added. "In that sense, IPv6 succeeded where it was needed most, and must be regarded as a success."</p>
<p>RIPE NCC's Alvaro Vives agrees. "What IPv6 got right was its long-term design," he told <em>The Register</em>. "It provides a vast address space that allows networks to be planned more simply and consistently. This has enabled innovation, from large mobile networks to the Internet of Things and advanced routing techniques such as Segment Routing over IPv6."</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/12/02/ham_radio_ipv6_ietf_draft/">Unofficial IETF draft calls for grant of five nonillion IPv6 addresses to ham radio operators</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/20/ietf_dnsop_3901bis_ipv4_ipv6/">IETF Draft suggests making IPv6 standard on DNS resolvers - partly to destroy IPv4</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/04/23/apnic_half_ipv6_capable/">Asia reaches 50 percent IPv6 capability and leads the world in user numbers</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Gartner's Lerner thinks the time has come for organizations to develop detailed IPv6 migration plans.</p>
<p>"Validate application compatibility, and ensure new infrastructure supports IPv6," he advised. "Pilot deployments and lab testing with DNS64/NAT64 are recommended. Over time, IPv6 adoption will accelerate as private IPv4 space depletes and cloud providers introduce pricing models that favor IPv6."</p>
<p>APNIC's Huston, however, thinks that IPv6 has become less relevant to the wider internet.</p>
<p>"I would argue that we actually found a far better outcome along the way," he told <em>The Register</em>. "NATS forced us to think about network architectures in an entirely different way."</p>
<p>That new way is encapsulated in a new technology called Quick UDP Internet Connections (QUIC), that doesn't require client devices to always have access to a public IP address.</p>
<p>"We are proving to ourselves that clients don't need permanent assignment of IP address, which makes the client side of network far cheaper, more flexible, and scalable," he said.</p>
<p>Huston thinks IPv6 has also become less relevant to servers.</p>
<p>"These days the Domain Name Service (DNS) is the service selector, not the IP address," Huston told <em>The Register</em>. "The entire security framework of today's Internet is name based and the world of authentication and channel encryption is based on service names, not IP addresses."</p>
<p>"So folk use IPv6 these days based on cost: If the cost of obtaining more IPv4 addresses to fuel bigger NATs is too high, then they deploy IPv6. Not because it's better, but if they are confident that they can work around IPv6's weaknesses then in a largely name based world there is no real issue in using one addressing protocol or another as the transport underlay."</p>
<p>But there are plenty of organizations that still see a need for IPv6. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/12/06/apnic_huawei_ipv6/">Huawei sought 2.56 decillion IPv6 addresses</a> and Starlink appears to have acquired<a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/29/nded/">150 sextillion</a>, which is helping to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/06/27/ipv6_adoption_statistics/">push more countries</a> past 50 percent IPv6 adoption. ®</p>

<!-- %h3 About -->
<p>The USA is demanding from all 43 countries in the "Visa Waiver Programme" (VWP), which enables visa-free travel, to conclude an "Enhanced Border Security Partnership" (EBSP). This is intended to grant US authorities direct access to police databases in these - mostly European - countries containing fingerprints, facial images and other personal data. Anyone who refuses this forced "border partnership" faces exclusion from the visa-free travel programme.</p>

<p>The US demand is unprecedented: even EU member states do not grant each other such extensive direct database access – normally the exchange takes place via the "hit/no-hit principle" with a subsequent request for further data. This is how it works, for example, in the Prüm Treaty among all Schengen states, which has so far covered fingerprints and DNA data and is now also being extended to facial images.</p>

<p>The EBSP could practically affect anyone who falls under the jurisdiction of border authorities: from passport controls to deportation proceedings. Under the US autocrat Donald Trump, this is a particular problem, as his militia-like immigration authority ICE is already using data from various sources to brutally persecute migrants – direct access to police data from VWP partners could massively strengthen this surveillance apparatus. Germany alone might give access to facial images of 5.5 million people and fingerprints of a similar dimension.</p>

<p>The USA has already tightened the Visa Waiver Programme several times, for instance in 2006 through the introduction of biometric passports and in 2008 through the ESTA pre-registration requirement. In addition, there were bilateral agreements for the exchange of fingerprints and DNA profiles – however, these may only be transmitted in individual cases involving serious crime.</p>

<p>Existing treaties such as the EU-US Police Framework Agreement are not applicable to the "Enhanced Border Security Partnership", as it applies exclusively to law enforcement purposes. It is also questionable how the planned data transfer is supposed to be compatible with the strict data protection rules of the GDPR. The EU Commission therefore wants to negotiate a framework agreement on the EBSP that would apply to all member states. Time is running short: the US government has set VWP states a deadline of 31 December 2026. Some already agreed on a bilateral level.</p>

    <hr>

    <p>
      A few days ago, I found that a grown man had been texting my twelve-year-old 
      son on his "kid-safe" Gabb phone. The man got my son's number through a 
      children's book chat on an app called GroupMe. Thankfully my wife and I 
      discovered the situation and intervened before anything bad happened; but 
      still it was sickening to discover that on Christmas morning, while our 
      family was unwrapping presents next to the tree, some creep had been texting 
      my son: "What did you get? Send pictures."
    </p>

    <p>
      How could we have let this happen? How could we be such careless parents?
    </p>

    <p>
      But wait . . . hadn't we done what we were supposed to do? We bought the 
      "kid-safe" phone. And we confirmed GroupMe was on the 
      <a href="https://gabb.com/app-guide/">Gabb "approved apps" list</a>, which, 
      as I understand it, offers "no social media or high-risk options." We 
      did the safe things, right?
    </p>

    <p>
      Maybe not. Turns out Gabb's own blog appears to include GroupMe on a list of 
      <a href="https://gabb.com/blog/dangerous-chat-features/">seven apps with 
        dangerous chat features</a>, describing it as an app that "opens the 
        door to potential dangers." We were apparently supposed to find that 
        warning ourselves, somewhere among Gabb's 572 blog posts:
    </p>

<pre><code>$ curl -s \
  https://gabb.com/post-sitemap.xml \
  | grep -oE 'https://gabb\.com/blog/[^&lt;]+' \
  | sort -u \
  | wc -l \
  | xargs -I{} echo "{} blog posts as of $(date '+%B %d, %Y')"

572 blog posts as of January 02, 2026</code></pre>

    <p>
      But if GroupMe "opens the door" to danger, why did Gabb put it on their "approved 
      apps" list? When I revisited the site, I noticed a small message beneath 
      GroupMe mentioning Communication with Strangers. I hovered over it with 
      my mouse pointer, and a tooltip appeared: "Allows contact and communication with 
      people the child may not know."
    </p>

    <p>
      So it allows communication with strangers, but it's not "high-risk?" The 
      approved list isn't looking so safe. The approved list is apparently a 
      catalog of risks I'm supposed to decipher by filtering through 838 apps 
      and hovering my mouse pointer around to see tooltips:
    </p>

<pre><code>$ for cat in \
  existing_apps \
  unapproved_apps \
  unmet_criteria_apps \
  music_apps; do
  count=$(curl -s "https://gabb.com/app-guide/" \
    | grep -o "${cat} = \[.*\]" \
    | head -1 \
    | sed "s/${cat} = \[//" \
    | sed "s/\]//" \
    | tr ',' '\n' \
    | sed "s/'//g" \
    | sed 's/^ *//' \
    | sort -u \
    | wc -l \
    | tr -d ' ')
  echo "$count $cat"
done &amp;&amp; echo "...as of $(date '+%B %d, %Y')"

586 existing_apps
60 unapproved_apps
170 unmet_criteria_apps
22 music_apps
...as of January 02, 2026</code></pre>

    <p>
      Whatever the reason for this complexity, I don't feel in control.
    </p>

    <p>
      And Gabb isn't alone in making me feel like this. It seems like many companies 
      selling tech to families operate in the same way: market safety, deliver 
      complexity, and leave parents to figure it out.
    </p>


    <p>
      Take the Nintendo Switch my son unwrapped between those creepy texts. To 
      set it up, I had to:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Connect the console to the internet</li>
      <li>Download the Nintendo Switch Parental Controls app to my phone</li>
      <li>Create a Nintendo Account for myself</li>
      <li>Link my credit card and be charged $0.50 to verify parental consent</li>
      <li>Set up parental controls from the app on my phone</li>
      <li>Sync the parental controls app to the Nintendo Switch</li>
      <li>Set up a security PIN on the Nintendo Switch</li>
      <li>Create a Nintendo Account for my son</li>
      <li>Sync my son's Nintendo Account to the Nintendo Switch</li>
      <li>Discover that half the controls live in the phone app and the other 
        half live on Nintendo's website, because of course they do</li>
      <li>Log into Nintendo's website to finish the job . . . </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      Only to discover that there's no clear option to block internet access, 
      no clear way to disable downloads from the Nintendo eShop, and no easy 
      way to make this thing function like an old-school Game Boy and just let a 
      kid have fun with a game cartridge. But that's just nostalgia talking. 
      Nobody wants that anymore. Apparently.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because next comes Minecraft. Ah, Minecraft. The game every middle-schooler 
      on earth apparently needs to survive. To let my son play with his friends:
    </p>

    <ol start="12">
      <li>Create a Microsoft account for myself</li>
      <li>Create an email address for my son</li>
      <li>Create a Microsoft account for my son</li>
      <li>Set up a gamertag for my son on account.xbox.com</li>
      <li>Configure parental controls in Microsoft Family Safety</li>
      <li>Configure more parental controls on xbox.com</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      Now, I did my best to configure these settings. I really did. But xbox.com alone
      includes twenty-nine confusingly overlapping settings related to chat, 
      friends, and communication. Twenty-nine.
    </p>

    <p>
      And when I finally—<em>finally</em>—tried to test online play, Minecraft 
      told me I would need to loosen the parental controls (it did not say 
      which) <em>and</em> create a Nintendo Switch Online account for my son.
    </p>

    <p>
      Nintendo Switch Online (not really another account, mind you, but a 
      <em>membership</em>) involves a recurring fee. It also unlocks access to 
      the Nintendo eShop, which I cannot disable. I can set his eShop spending limit 
      to zero, sure. But I can't block free downloads. So to let my son play 
      online Minecraft with his friends, I have to open him up to an unrelated store full of content 
      I can't possibly evaluate. That's the deal. Take it or leave it.
    </p>

    <p>
      I assume some marketing person at Nintendo, probably sitting in a 
      conference room in Kyoto, surrounded by whiteboards covered in arrows and 
      cartoon stick figures, has this entire process mapped out as a "customer 
      journey." And by Step 17, the journey is supposed to be over. You're 
      supposed to be so beaten down, so utterly depleted of will, that you just 
      cave. You sign up for Nintendo Online. You disable a bunch of parental 
      controls you don't really understand. You let your kid play his damn game. 
      You become the ideal customer.
    </p>

    <p>
      But I didn't cave. Instead, somewhere on the threshold of Customer Journey Step 18, 
      I found myself gripping the Switch with both hands and imagining, quite 
      vividly, what it would feel like to lift the Switch up, and bring it down
      over my knee. I could almost hear the crack. Could almost see that OLED
      display splintering into a thousand pieces. The little Joy-Cons skittering
      across the floor. My son's face. My wife's face. The stunned silence.
    </p>

    <p>
      I did not break the Switch.
    </p>

    <p>
      What I did was announce, in a voice louder than 
      necessary, that <em>nobody</em> was to ask me about anything 
      Minecraft-related on the Nintendo Switch for a minimum of two weeks. My 
      son could play Zelda: Breath of the Wild instead, which, thank you, 
      developers, thank you from the bottom of my heart, doesn't appear to 
      involve any mandatory online anything whatsoever.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here's what I want: an off switch. A single setting that says "this 
      child cannot go online, communicate with strangers, spend money, or 
      download anything without my explicit permission." Instead I get a 
      maze, complex enough that when something goes wrong, I'm at fault for a
      tooltip I didn't hover over, a blog post I didn't read, a submenu I didn't 
      find. Maybe that's by design. Maybe it's neglect. I don't know.
    </p>

    <p>
      What I know is this. My son just wants to play video games and talk to his
      friends. I just want to keep him safe. Somewhere between those 
      two things, I'm supposed to become an expert in the convoluted parental

<p>FracturedJson is a family of utilities that format <a href="https://json.org/" rel="nofollow">JSON data</a> in a way that's easy for humans to read, but fairly compact.  Arrays and objects are written on single lines, as long as they're neither too long nor too complex.  When several such lines are similar in structure, they're written with fields aligned like a table.  Long arrays are written with multiple items per line across multiple lines.</p>
<p>There are lots of settings available to control the output, but usually you can ignore most of them.  FracturedJson produces nice-looking output from any set of JSON data automatically.</p>
<p>You can try it out with the <a href="https://j-brooke.github.io/FracturedJson/" rel="nofollow">browser formatter page</a>.  It's also available as a <a href="https://github.com/j-brooke/FracturedJson/wiki/.NET-Library">.NET library</a>, a <a href="https://github.com/j-brooke/FracturedJsonJs">JavaScript/Typescript package</a>, and a <a href="https://github.com/j-brooke/FracturedJsonVSC">Visual Studio Code extension</a>.  See here for <a href="https://github.com/j-brooke/FracturedJson/wiki/Python">Python options</a>.</p>
<p>Here's a sample of output using default settings.  See the <a href="https://github.com/j-brooke/FracturedJson/wiki/Options">Options page</a> for examples of what you different settings do.</p>

<p>Optionally, comments can be preserved.  Comments aren't allowed by the official JSON standard, but they're ubiquitous, so it's nice to have the option.  FracturedJson tries to keep the comments together with whatever elements they seem to relate to.</p>

<p><h2>Motivation</h2><a id="user-content-motivation" aria-label="Permalink: Motivation" href="#motivation"></a></p>
<p>Most JSON libraries give you a choice between two formatting options.  Minified JSON is very efficient, but difficult for a person to read.</p>

<p><h2>How It Works</h2><a id="user-content-how-it-works" aria-label="Permalink: How It Works" href="#how-it-works"></a></p>
<p>FracturedJson uses four types of formatting: <strong>inlined</strong>, <strong>compact multiline array</strong>, <strong>table</strong> and <strong>expanded</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/j-brooke/FracturedJson/refs/heads/main/src-assets/fj-layout-types.png" alt="Layout Types"></p>
<p><h3>Inlined</h3><a id="user-content-inlined" aria-label="Permalink: Inlined" href="#inlined"></a></p>
<p>When possible, sections of the document are written inlined, as long as that doesn't make them too long or too complex (as determined by the settings).  "Complexity" refers to how deeply nested an array or object's contents are.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="{ &quot;UnitType&quot;: &quot;Archer&quot;, &quot;Position&quot;: [41, 7] }"><pre>{ <span>"UnitType"</span>: <span><span>"</span>Archer<span>"</span></span>, <span>"Position"</span>: [<span>41</span>, <span>7</span>] }</pre></div>
<p>Use the setting <a href="https://github.com/j-brooke/FracturedJson/wiki/Options#maxinlinecomplexity">MaxInlineComplexity</a> to control how much nesting is allowed on one line.</p>
<p><h3>Compact Multiline Array</h3><a id="user-content-compact-multiline-array" aria-label="Permalink: Compact Multiline Array" href="#compact-multiline-array"></a></p>
<p>The next option, for arrays, is to write them with multiple items per line, across multiple lines.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="[
    [19,  2], [ 3,  8], [14,  0], [ 9,  9], [ 9,  9], [ 0,  3], [10,  1],
    [ 9,  1], [ 9,  2], [ 6, 13], [18,  5], [ 4, 11], [12,  2]
]"><pre>[
    [<span>19</span>,  <span>2</span>], [ <span>3</span>,  <span>8</span>], [<span>14</span>,  <span>0</span>], [ <span>9</span>,  <span>9</span>], [ <span>9</span>,  <span>9</span>], [ <span>0</span>,  <span>3</span>], [<span>10</span>,  <span>1</span>],
    [ <span>9</span>,  <span>1</span>], [ <span>9</span>,  <span>2</span>], [ <span>6</span>, <span>13</span>], [<span>18</span>,  <span>5</span>], [ <span>4</span>, <span>11</span>], [<span>12</span>,  <span>2</span>]
]</pre></div>
<p>Use the setting <a href="https://github.com/j-brooke/FracturedJson/wiki/Options#maxcompactarraycomplexity">MaxCompactArrayComplexity</a> to control how deeply nested items can be when arranged this way, or use <code>-1</code> to disable this feature.</p>
<p><h3>Table</h3><a id="user-content-table" aria-label="Permalink: Table" href="#table"></a></p>
<p>If an array or object contains inlineable items of the same type, they can be formatted in a tabular format.  With enough room, all fields at any depth are lined up (and reordered if necessary).</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="{
    &quot;Rect&quot; : { &quot;position&quot;: {&quot;x&quot;: -44, &quot;y&quot;:  3.4         }, &quot;color&quot;: [0, 255, 255] },
    &quot;Point&quot;: { &quot;position&quot;: {          &quot;y&quot;: 22   , &quot;z&quot;: 3}                         },
    &quot;Oval&quot; : { &quot;position&quot;: {&quot;x&quot;: 140, &quot;y&quot;:  0.04        }, &quot;color&quot;: &quot;#7f3e96&quot;     },
    &quot;Plane&quot;: { &quot;position&quot;: null,                           &quot;color&quot;: [0, 64, 64]   }
}"><pre>{
    <span>"Rect"</span> : { <span>"position"</span>: {<span>"x"</span>: <span>-44</span>, <span>"y"</span>:  <span>3.4</span>         }, <span>"color"</span>: [<span>0</span>, <span>255</span>, <span>255</span>] },
    <span>"Point"</span>: { <span>"position"</span>: {          <span>"y"</span>: <span>22</span>   , <span>"z"</span>: <span>3</span>}                         },
    <span>"Oval"</span> : { <span>"position"</span>: {<span>"x"</span>: <span>140</span>, <span>"y"</span>:  <span>0.04</span>        }, <span>"color"</span>: <span><span>"</span>#7f3e96<span>"</span></span>     },
    <span>"Plane"</span>: { <span>"position"</span>: <span>null</span>,                           <span>"color"</span>: [<span>0</span>, <span>64</span>, <span>64</span>]   }
}</pre></div>
<p>If the table wouldn't fit with all of the elements and subelements aligned, the inner-most containers are collapsed while keeping the outer ones still aligned.</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="{
    &quot;Rect&quot; : { &quot;position&quot;: {&quot;x&quot;: -44, &quot;y&quot;: 3.4},  &quot;color&quot;: [0, 255, 255] },
    &quot;Point&quot;: { &quot;position&quot;: {&quot;y&quot;: 22, &quot;z&quot;: 3}                             },
    &quot;Oval&quot; : { &quot;position&quot;: {&quot;x&quot;: 140, &quot;y&quot;: 0.04}, &quot;color&quot;: &quot;#7f3e96&quot;     },
    &quot;Plane&quot;: { &quot;position&quot;: null,                  &quot;color&quot;: [0, 64, 64]   }
}"><pre>{
    <span>"Rect"</span> : { <span>"position"</span>: {<span>"x"</span>: <span>-44</span>, <span>"y"</span>: <span>3.4</span>},  <span>"color"</span>: [<span>0</span>, <span>255</span>, <span>255</span>] },
    <span>"Point"</span>: { <span>"position"</span>: {<span>"y"</span>: <span>22</span>, <span>"z"</span>: <span>3</span>}                             },

    <span>"Plane"</span>: { <span>"position"</span>: <span>null</span>,                  <span>"color"</span>: [<span>0</span>, <span>64</span>, <span>64</span>]   }
}</pre></div>
<p>Use the setting <a href="https://github.com/j-brooke/FracturedJson/wiki/Options#maxtablerowcomplexity">MaxTableRowComplexity</a> to control how how deeply nested rows can be, or use <code>-1</code> to disable this feature.  Use <a href="https://github.com/j-brooke/FracturedJson/wiki/Options#tablecommaplacement">TableCommaPlacement</a> to adjust where commas are placed.</p>
<p><h3>Expanded</h3><a id="user-content-expanded" aria-label="Permalink: Expanded" href="#expanded"></a></p>
<p>If none of those options work for an element, it will be written across multiple lines, with child items indented and starting on its own line.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="[
    {
        &quot;type&quot; : &quot;turret&quot;,
        &quot;hp&quot;   : 400,

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody text">
    <p>
In
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/commandline/comments/1oteeaj/whats_the_most_useful_commandline_trick_you/no5xkx4/">a
recent discussion on Reddit</a>
I shared a number of tips
about the common utility
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/less.1"><code>less(1)</code></a>
that others found helpful
so I figured I'd aggregate some of those tips here.
</p>

<h3 id="multiple-files">Operating on multiple files</h3>

<p>
While most folks invoke
<code>less</code>
at the tail of a pipeline like
</p><figure><pre><label>$ </label> <var>command</var> | less
</pre>
<figcaption>Invoking <code>less</code> in a pipeline</figcaption></figure><p>

you can directly provide one or more files to open

</p><figure><pre><label>$ </label> less <var>README.txt file.c *.md</var>
</pre>
<figcaption>Invoking <code>less</code> directly</figcaption></figure>

<h3 id="adding-files">Adding files after starting</h3>

<p>
When reading a document,
sometimes you want to view another file,
adding it to the file list.
Perhaps while reading some C source code
you want to also look over the corresponding header-file.
You can add that header-file to the argument list with
<code>:e file.h</code>
</p>

<h3 id="navigating-multiple">Navigating multiple files</h3>

<p>
You can navigate between multiple files using
<code>:n</code>
to go to the next file in the argument-list, and
<code>:p</code>
for the previous file.
You can also use
<code>:x</code>
to rewind to the first file in the argument-list
similar to how
<code>:rewind</code>
behaves in
<code>vi</code>/<code>vim</code>.
</p>

<h3 id="removing-files">Removing files after starting</h3>

<p>
While I rarely feel the need to,
if you have finished with a file
and want to keep your argument list clean,
you can use
<code>:d</code>
to delete the current file from the argument-list.
</p>

<h2 id="navigating-within">Navigating</h2>

<h3 id="jump-to-line">Jumping to a particular line-number</h3>

<p>
Use
<code><var>«count»</var>G</code>
to jump to a particular line-number.
So using
<code><var>3141</var>G</code>
will jump to line <var>3141</var>.
It helps to display
<a href="#option-N">line numbers</a>.
</p>

<h3 id="jump-to-percent">Jumping to a particular percentage-offset</h3>

<p>
Similarly, using
<code><var>«count»</var>%</code>
jumps to that percentage-offset of the file.
So if you want to go to ¾
of the way through the file, you can type
<code>75%</code>
to jump right there.
</p>

<h3 id="searching">Searching</h3>

<p>
While many folks know you can search forward with
<code>/<var>«pattern»</var></code>
and some people know you can use
<code>?<var>«pattern»</var></code>
to search backwards,
or use
<code>n</code>/<code>N</code>
to search again for the next/previous match,
<code>less</code>
provides modifiers you can specify
before the pattern to modify its behavior:
</p>

<dl id="search-modifier">
<dt><code>!</code></dt>
 <dd>
  Find the next line that
  <strong>doesn't</strong>
  match the pattern
 </dd>
 <dt><code>*</code></dt>
 <dd>
 search across multiple files,
 starting from the current location
 in the current file
 </dd>
 <dt><code>@</code></dt>
 <dd>
 rewind to the first file
 and search from there
 </dd>
 <dt><code>@*</code></dt>
 <dd>
 rewind to the first file
 and search from there
 across multiple files
 </dd>
</dl>
<p>
Thus you would use
<code>/@*<var>«pattern»</var></code>
to search for "pattern"
starting with the first file.
</p>

<h2 id="filtering">Filtering lines</h2>

<p>
Using
<code>&amp;</code>
lets you specify a pattern
and filter the displayed lines
to only those matching the pattern,
much like an internal
<code>grep</code>
command.
If you modify it with
<code>!</code>,
so it will display only those lines that do
<em>not match</em>
the pattern, like
<code>&amp;!<var>«pattern»</var></code>.
I find this particularly helpful for browsing log-files.
</p>

<h2 id="bookmarking">Bookmarking</h2>
<p>
You can bookmark points in a file with
<code>m</code>
followed by a letter,
then jump back to that bookmark with
<code>'</code>
followed by the same letter.
These apply globally across all open files,
so if you
<code>ma</code>
in the third file,
then navigate away to other files,
using
<code>'a</code>
will take you back to the marked location
in that third file.
I use marks most when reading man-pages,
dropping one mark at the
<tt>OPTIONS</tt>
section such as
<code>mo</code>,
and another at the
<tt>EXAMPLES</tt>
section,
such as
<code>me</code>,
then bounce back and forth between them with
<code>'o</code>
and
<code>'e</code>.
While you can use any of
the 26 lowercase or uppercase letters
(for a total of 52 marks),
I rarely use more than two or three
either in alphabetical order
("a", "b", "c"),
or assigning mnemonics like in the
<code>man</code>-page example above.
</p>

<h3 id="bracket-matching">Bracket matching</h3>

<p>
If the first line on the screen contains a
<code>(</code>,
<code>[</code>,
or
<code>{</code>,
typing that character
will jump to the matching/closing character,
putting it on the bottom line of the screen.
Similarly, if a closing
<code>)</code>,
<code>]</code>,
or
<code>}</code>,
character appears on the last line,
typing that closing character
will jump to the matching/opening character,
putting it at the top of the screen.
I find it a little disorienting
if they fall <code>less</code> than a screen-height apart
because what feels like a forward motion
to find the next matching close-bracket
might actually result in shifting the screen
<em>down</em>
rather than
<em>up</em>
which feels backwards.
</p>

<p>
While I don't use it much,
you can also specify match-pairs using
<code><kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>ctrl+f</kbd></code>
or
<code><kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>ctrl+b</kbd></code>
followed by the opening/closing pair of characters
such as
<code><kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>ctrl+f&lt;&gt;</kbd></code>
to define a "&lt;"…"&gt;" pair
and jump between them
in a manner similar to the
<code>(</code>/<code>)</code>,
<code>[</code>/<code>]</code>,
and
<code>{</code>/<code>)</code>
motions.
</p>

<h2 id="toggling-options">Toggling options without restarting</h2>

<p>
While the
<code>man</code>-page
documents many flags you can pass
on the command-line,
you can also toggle boolean options from inside
<code>less</code>.
I find this particularly helpful
when I've fed the output of a long-running process to
<code>less</code>
and don't want to re-run it
because it will take a long time.
Instead of quitting,
you can type a literal
<code>-</code>
followed by the option you want to change.
I most commonly want to toggle word-wrap for long lines,
so instead of quitting and adding
<code>-S</code>
at the end of my pipeline,
I can type
<code>-S</code>
directly in
<code>less</code>.
Options I commonly toggle:
</p>
<dl id="options">
<dt id="option-S"><code>-S</code></dt>
 <dd>word-wrap (mnemonic "splitting long lines")</dd>
 <dt id="option-G"><code>-G</code></dt>
 <dd>search-highlighting</dd>
 <dt id="option-I">
<code>-i</code>/<code>-I</code>
</dt>
 <dd>smart-case/case-sensitivity for searches</dd>
 <dt id="option-R"><code>-R</code></dt>
 <dd>ANSI-color escaping</dd>
 <dt id="option-N">
<code>-N</code>/<code>-n</code>
</dt>
 <dd>show/hide line-numbers</dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="external-commands">Running external commands</h2>

<p>
The
<code>!</code>
lets you invoke an external command.
I don't do this often,
but occasionally I want some simple reference
like the current date
(<code>!date</code>)
or to do some simple math
(<code>!bc</code>).
</p>

<h2 id="env-vars">Default options with <code>$LESS</code>
</h2>

<p>
You might find yourself regularly setting
a common group of
<a href="#options">options</a>
so you can put those in your environment
(usually in your shell startup file like
<code>~/.bashrc</code>)
like
<code>LESS="-RNe"</code>
if you want to
<a href="#option-R">show ANSI colors</a>,
<a href="#option-N">show line-numbers</a>,
and exit automatically when you reach the end of the file.
</p>

<h2 id="other-misc">Other misc</h2>

<p>
<code>less</code>
has a few other corners that I've never really used,
but figured I'd document here:
</p>

<h3 id="tags">Tags</h3>

<p>
While I've used tags in
<code>vi</code>/<code>vim</code>
to easily jump between definitions.
However, even though
<code>less</code>
provides support for tags generated by
<code>ctags</code>.
I've never found cause to use them.
</p>

<h3 id="external-editor">Editing the current document</h3>

<p>
The
<code>v</code>
command will open your
<code>$VISUAL</code>
editor on the current document.
</p>

<h3 id="log-output">"Log" output</h3>

<p>
<code>less</code>
lets you redirect the output
it has gathered from
<abbr title="standard input">stdin</abbr>
to a file using the
<code>o</code>
command
(or the
<code>O</code>
command to overwrite an existing file).
This might come in handy because
<code>less</code>
won't let you
<a href="#external-editor">edit stdin
in an external editor</a>
but you can write it directly to a file.

    <p>January 2026 will mark 10 years since I started storing my personal finances in plain
text files using Beancount. Since January 2016, I've taken out about 30-45 minutes every
single month to download my monthly bank statements and import them into my Beancount
ledger.</p>
<p>There's a lot to talk about here, but let's start with some fun numbers!</p>
<h2 id="the-10-year-old-beancount-ledger">The 10 year old Beancount ledger</h2>
<p>10 years of financial transactions is a lot of data! All in all, my ledger contains over
45,000 lines of Beancount entries spread across 16 plain text files. All of it is stored
in a <code>finances</code> directory (version controlled) on my laptop. Here's a snapshot:</p>
<pre data-lang="sh"><code data-lang="sh"><span>❯ find . -name </span><span>"*.beancount" </span><span>| </span><span>xargs wc -l
</span><span>    4037 ./includes/2020.beancount
</span><span>    3887 ./includes/2018.beancount
</span><span>      27 ./includes/cash.beancount
</span><span>    4398 ./includes/2021.beancount
</span><span>    5531 ./includes/2019.beancount
</span><span>    5267 ./includes/2022.beancount
</span><span>    3287 ./includes/2017.beancount
</span><span>    5506 ./includes/2024.beancount
</span><span>    5606 ./includes/2023.beancount
</span><span>    1454 ./includes/2016.beancount
</span><span>    1089 ./includes/open/04-expenses.beancount
</span><span>      66 ./includes/open/03-income.beancount
</span><span>      11 ./includes/open/05-liabilities.beancount
</span><span>      37 ./includes/open/02-assets.beancount
</span><span>       1 ./includes/open/01-equity.beancount
</span><span>    4807 ./main.beancount
</span><span>   45011 total
</span></code></pre>
<p>Running <code>bean-query</code> on <code>main.beancount</code> tells me I have about 10,000 transactions in
total, that in turn contain about 20,000 postings (in double-entry bookkeeping, one
transaction may have multiple postings).</p>
<pre data-lang="sh"><code data-lang="sh"><span>❯ uv run bean-query main.beancount
</span><span>Input file: </span><span>"Goel"
</span><span>Ready with 12466 directives (19743 postings in 9895 transactions)</span><span>.
</span><span>beanquery</span><span>&gt;
</span></code></pre>
<p>There are 1086 accounts in total.</p>
<pre data-lang="sh"><code data-lang="sh"><span>beanquery</span><span>&gt;</span><span> select count(</span><span>*</span><span>) from (select distinct(account))</span><span>;
</span><span>coun
</span><span>----
</span><span>1086
</span></code></pre>
<p>... which does not mean that there are 1086 <strong>bank</strong> accounts. Accounts in Beancount are
virtual, and you can create as many as you like. Imagine one account for categorizing
supermarket spending, one for tracking your income, one for your Netflix subscription,
and so on.</p>
<p>Next, there are about 500 documents in the repository.</p>
<pre data-lang="sh"><code data-lang="sh"><span>❯ find documents/ -name </span><span>"*.pdf" </span><span>| </span><span>wc -l
</span><span>     507
</span></code></pre>
<p>Beancount lets you attach documents (e.g. receipts or invoices) to transactions, that
makes bookkeeping very efficient. I love the fact that whenever I need to do my tax
returns, I can just take a look at my Beancount ledger and find all the invoices right
there next to the relevant transaction.</p>
<p>Lastly, in terms of postings, I started out with 715 in the year 2016, and the year 2023
was the busiest so far in terms of just the total postings count.</p>
<pre data-lang="sh"><code data-lang="sh"><span>beanquery</span><span>&gt;</span><span> select year(date), count(</span><span>*</span><span>) where year(date) </span><span>&lt; </span><span>2025 </span><span>group by year(date)</span><span>;
</span><span>year  coun
</span><span>----  ----
</span><span>2016   715
</span><span>2017  1422
</span><span>2018  1605
</span><span>2019  2437
</span><span>2020  1582
</span><span>2021  2022
</span><span>2022  2435
</span><span>2023  2651
</span><span>2024  2602
</span></code></pre>
<h2 id="the-monthly-ritual">The Monthly Ritual</h2>
<p>I wrote earlier that every month I take about 30-45 minutes to import my financial
transactions into Beancount. What does that workflow look like? I wrote another, much
more detailed <a href="https://sgoel.dev/posts/how-you-can-track-your-personal-finances-using-python/">blog post</a> about it a few years ago, but here's a gist.</p>
<p>It starts with me logging in to my bank account(s) to download my monthly statement(s)
in CSV (CSV because it's much more predictable to parse compared to PDF). I then run
these CSV files through what's called an "importer", that converts this CSV data into
data structures that Beancount understands. I then append all those extracted entries
into my current <code>.beancount</code> file (which is the main file containing <strong>all</strong> my
financial transactions in plain text). I then go through each entry one by one and make
sure it's balanced (in double-entry bookkeeping, all the postings in a transaction must
sum to zero, and not all postings/transactions that an importer outputs are balanced).
Some of that balancing is manual and some of it is automated (e.g. the importer code can
look at the transaction's description and decide which account it should go into, and
balance automatically). This last part (balancing) is where most of those 30-45 minutes
go.</p>
<p>Whenever a new year starts, I move all the transactions from the past year into a
<code>&lt;year&gt;.beancount</code> file and add an <code>include &lt;year.beancount&gt;</code> in the active
<code>main.beancount</code>file, mostly to avoid the main file from becoming too long. Not that it
would be an issue for Beancount, but just for the sake of readability.</p>
<p>With such a workflow, all my financial transactions from the beginning of time are
contained in a few plain text files in one directory on my laptop.</p>
<h2 id="building-beancount-importers-for-german-banks">Building Beancount Importers for German Banks</h2>
<p>Beancount only provides the foundations for working with money, but it has no knowledge
of what your bank statements look like. This is where the concept of an importer comes
in. An importer is a (Python) class that takes in a bank statement of sorts (e.g. a CSV
export of your transactions) and converts them into something that Beancount can work
with.</p>
<p>I live in Germany and my bank accounts are with German banks, so I had to write a few
importers for a few different banks, specifically <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/siddhantgoel/beancount-dkb">beancount-dkb</a>, <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/siddhantgoel/beancount-ing">beancount-ing</a>,
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/siddhantgoel/beancount-n26">beancount-n26</a>, and <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/siddhantgoel/beancount-commerzbank">beancount-commerzbank</a>. I closed out my Commerzbank account a
while ago, so I don't maintain that integration anymore, but the first three
libraries are actively maintained (and used)!</p>

<p>My start with Beancount was a bit bumpy. The documentation is very comprehensive but
as a newcomer, I found it tricky to get a grasp on the overall workflow. It took me some
trial and error to figure things out and have that "aha" moment.</p>
<p>I figured that if I found it tricky, maybe it's tricky for others as well. So I wrote
a short book to help newcomers get up and running with Beancount easily. If you're
interested, here's a link: <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://personalfinancespython.com/">https://personalfinancespython.com</a>.</p>
<p>The feedback on the book has been super positive. It got mentioned on Beancount's
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://beancount.github.io/docs/external_contributions.html">external contributions</a> page, and the <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://personalfinancespython.com/#testimonials">reader reviews</a> have all been very encouraging!</p>
<h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts</h2>
<p>Having all my finances in a bunch of plain text files tracked in a git repository feels
invaluable to me. And hitting the 10 years mark on that almost feels like a milestone.</p>
<p>Perhaps the nicest bit about all this is that this data is sitting on <strong>my own
machine</strong>, not in some data center somewhere else. All of it is in plain text files that
I can open up in my editor, and analyze using the tools that the Beancount ecosystem
gives me. All of it will outlive any app or service, and that, I feel, is why plaintext
accounting is so powerful.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Two people. Eighteen accounts spanning checking, savings, credit cards, investments. Three currencies. Twenty minutes of work every week.</p><p>One net worth number I actually trust.</p><p><img src="https://lalitm.com/img/one-number-i-trust/01-payoff-net-worth.png" alt="Net Worth Chart growing over 2+ years" title="One net worth number to trust"></p><p><em>The payoff: A single, trustworthy net worth number growing over time.</em></p><p>No app did exactly what I needed, so I built my own personal finance system using <strong>plain-text accounting</strong> principles and a powerful Python library called <strong>Beancount</strong>. This post shows you how I handle imports, investments, multi-currency, and a two-person view.</p><h2 id="how-i-got-here">How I got here</h2><p>It all started during the 2021 tax season. I had blocked out an entire weekend and was juggling statements, trying to compute capital gains, stressing about getting the numbers mixed up. “This is chaos”, I thought. “There must be a way to simplify this with automation”. Being a software engineer, I did what felt natural and hacked together a bunch of scripts on top of a database.</p><p>Though it worked and I kept using it day-to-day, by the next tax season the cracks became obvious. The code was hard to debug, random transactions went missing, and worst of all, the balances the scripts computed didn’t match the balances on my statements. I tried to fix it but the more I tried, the more I felt lost about what the system was really doing. Eventually I just gave up.</p><p>Why did I fail so spectacularly? My entire approach was flawed from the start! I’d ignored centuries of accounting wisdom and repeated fundamental mistakes humanity solved long ago. So I learned from my mistakes and did the research. And over time I incrementally discovered <strong>double-entry bookkeeping</strong>, <strong>plain-text accounting</strong> and <strong>Beancount</strong>.</p><p>Fast forward to today, and I have a flexible, powerful, and private system, fully customized to how my brain works. Most transactions import automatically from PDF statements (counterintuitively, it’s often more reliable than CSV!). Tax time is a simple matter of checking always-fresh reports and copying numbers over. The weekly ritual is simple: download statements, categorize transactions in a web UI, run a bunch of scripts to regenerate, commit (I walk through this in more detail later).</p><p>However, I want to be realistic: building a system like this takes time and effort.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> You will need to learn some basic accounting concepts, be comfortable with Python, and consistently spend time every week keeping things up-to-date. If your finances are simple or you just want day-to-day budgeting, this is almost certainly overkill. Apps like YNAB or even the humble spreadsheet work great.</p><p>But if you want uncompromising control over how you look at your finances, read on.</p><h2 id="chapter-1-the-concepts">Chapter 1: The Concepts</h2><h4 id="double-entry-bookkeeping">Double-entry bookkeeping</h4><p>Suppose on a Saturday, I transfer money from my checking account to a savings account. The money leaves on the same day but doesn’t show up on the other side until Monday. So where was it for those two days?</p><p>In a “normal”<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> personal finance system, the answer would be that it was just gone. That is, for those two days, there would be a drop in the total money in two accounts. But this is weird because in reality my “net worth” did not change, yet there’s no good way to represent this.</p><p>Or suppose I pay $90 for a dinner for me and two friends. They pay me back a week later. Again, in this case the money is “gone” for that week. And even worse, the full $90 would be categorized as a “restaurant expense” while each $30 my friends paid would be “income”. But this is wrong. My expense is just $30 and the money they give me should be matched against the $60 they owe me.</p><p>Both of these are fundamental problems with how so-called “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-entry_bookkeeping">single-entry bookkeeping</a>” works: each account’s transactions and balance are tracked individually but without the context of the “whole”. In the case of the transfer, because we’re looking at each account in isolation, we lose the fact that even though the money has left one account, it’s really still part of the “pool of money” that belongs to us. Similarly, when our friends pay us back, we’re not tracking the fact that our friends owe us money when the original transaction happened and their payment later neutralizes the debt.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-entry_bookkeeping">Double-entry bookkeeping</a> is the solution to both these problems. Businesses have been using it for hundreds of years<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> to run their accounts, and it has powerful yet elegant ways to solve these problems and many others too.</p><p>Let’s consider again the transfer. In double-entry bookkeeping, we would represent the initial move of money as:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="fallback"><span><span>Bank-Checking              -1000
</span></span><span><span>Transfer-In-Flight         +1000
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>And when it arrives:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="fallback"><span><span>Transfer-In-Flight         -1000
</span></span><span><span>Savings-Account            +1000
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In both cases, we see the “golden rules” of double-entry bookkeeping:</p><ol><li><em>Every transaction has at least two sides and the sum of all the sides is zero</em>. -1000 + 1000 = 0. That is, transactions always “balance”.</li><li><em>Every side of a transaction is an account</em>, whether it exists in the real world or not.</li></ol><p>It should be clear that “Bank-Checking” and “Savings-Account” are labels for your checking and savings accounts, respectively. But what is “Transfer-In-Flight”?</p><p>Well, it’s also an account! It’s not an account you’ll find on your bank’s website, but within the double-entry system, it’s <em>just as real</em>. Concretely, accounts in double-entry are just labels for a “bucket of money”. So there’s no “category to put this transaction under”, no “expense tracking”, no special “transfer tag”. Everything is an account.</p><p>In this specific case, <code>Bank-Checking</code>, <code>Savings-Account</code>, and <code>Transfer-In-Flight</code> are all a specific type of account: they are <strong>Asset</strong> accounts. Assets are stuff you own; these can be real accounts (bank account, savings, stocks, bonds) or conceptual accounts (money in transit between accounts).</p><p>Now let’s consider the dinner example. There are 4 sides to the transaction:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="fallback"><span><span>Credit-Card                  -90
</span></span><span><span>Restaurant-Expense           +30
</span></span><span><span>Owes-Me:Alice                +30
</span></span><span><span>Owes-Me:Bob                  +30
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Again, -90 + 30 + 30 + 30 = 0. It balances. All of <code>Credit-Card</code>, <code>Restaurant-Expense</code>, <code>Owes-Me:Alice</code>, and <code>Owes-Me:Bob</code> are just accounts.</p><p><code>Credit-Card</code> is a different type of account though: it’s a <strong>Liability</strong>. Liabilities are the opposite of assets: instead of stuff you own, they’re stuff you <strong>owe</strong> to someone else. So for example, loans, credit cards, and mortgages are all liabilities.</p><p>Why <strong>negative</strong> 90? The rule is always: negative means money flowed <em>from</em> this account and positive means it flowed <em>into</em> this account. The credit card company fronted you $90, so that money flowed from your credit card to fund the purchase.</p><p><code>Restaurant-Expense</code> is yet another type of account, an <strong>Expense</strong> account. Expense accounts are money “leaving your world”. So any time you spend some money and you no longer have access to it, that’s an expense.</p><p>Finally, <code>Owes-Me:Alice</code> and <code>Owes-Me:Bob</code> are also <strong>Assets</strong>. Alice and Bob have promised to pay you back, and that promise has value, $30 each. It’s not cash in your pocket, but it’s money you have a claim on. In double-entry, anything with economic value you control is an asset, whether it’s a bank balance or an IOU.</p><p>Later, when Alice pays you back:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="fallback"><span><span>Bank-Checking               +30
</span></span><span><span>Owes-Me:Alice               -30
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This is just money moving from the “virtual” <code>Owes-Me:Alice</code> to the “real” <code>Bank-Checking</code> account. Both of these are still assets; it’s just the <em>type</em> of asset that’s changing. So no money has “entered the system” at this point. You’re just settling the debt Alice owed you.</p><p>Let’s take one last example: a paycheck.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="fallback"><span><span>Bank-Checking              +3000
</span></span><span><span>Salary                     -3000
</span></span></code></pre></div><p><code>Bank-Checking</code> is an <strong>Asset</strong> as we’ve learned. But <code>Salary</code> is a new account type, an <strong>Income</strong> account. Just like <strong>Assets</strong> and <strong>Liabilities</strong> are opposites, so are <strong>Income</strong> and <strong>Expenses</strong>. Where <strong>Expenses</strong> are money leaving your world, <strong>Income</strong> is money entering it.</p><p>Money flowed from Salary (source, negative) to Bank-Checking (destination, positive). The sign feels backwards: “I <em>received</em> money, so why is Income <em>negative</em>?” Because the sign shows direction of flow: income is where the money <em>came from</em>, and your bank is where it <em>went to</em>.</p><p>This is the one part of double-entry that takes repetition.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> Don’t try to make it intuitive; just trust the invariant: <strong>if your transaction sums to zero, you’ve got the signs right.</strong> After a dozen transactions, the pattern becomes automatic.</p><p>These four types of accounts cover 99% of what you’ll do:</p><ul><li><strong>Assets</strong>: stuff you own (bank accounts, cash, investments, money owed to you)</li><li><strong>Liabilities</strong>: stuff you owe (credit cards, loans)</li><li><strong>Income</strong>: money entering your world (salary, interest, dividends)</li><li><strong>Expenses</strong>: money leaving your world (groceries, rent, restaurants)</li></ul><p>There’s a fifth type, <strong>Equity</strong>, which is a catch-all “this money doesn’t fit elsewhere” bucket.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> Suppose you start tracking an account that already has $1000 in it; that money came from <strong>somewhere</strong> but you don’t have a record of that. It can’t be income because you already had it, and the other types don’t fit. That’s a good sign it belongs in equity. The good news is that you rarely interact with Equity directly. Generally, the software handles it for you, but there are some exceptions that we’ll cover in Chapter 2.</p><p>There’s so much more that could be said about double-entry bookkeeping. For further reading, I particularly like the <a href="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method.html">double entry explainer</a> in the Beancount docs. It goes through some more examples and expands into a bunch of related topics.</p><p>But we now have the foundation which ensures that every transaction balances, every dollar is accounted for, and nothing slips through the cracks. But we still need a way to actually record and store these transactions.</p><h4 id="plain-text-accounting">Plain text accounting</h4><p>One of the things I learned from writing my own finance system is that auditability is king. You need the ability to eyeball a transaction, ask yourself “does this look right,” and fix it if it doesn’t. And nothing beats being able to see and edit any transaction you’ve ever made in a text editor.</p><p>That’s one of the main things that drew me to the philosophy of <a href="https://plaintextaccounting.org/">Plain Text Accounting</a>. This is a set of principles on using plain text files as the “immutable source of truth” of your finances and then building scripts and tools on top of them to process, analyze, and visualize them.</p><p>There are many other advantages to this I’ve come to appreciate over the years:</p><p><strong>Everything is version controlled.</strong> You can store these transaction files in a git repo, which has powerful effects. You can look at diffs to see what changed on any day. You can <code>git blame</code> any transaction to see when and why it was added. You can <code>git tag</code> important states of the repo (e.g. when taxes were filed, when a new job was started, when a big refactoring happened). You can <code>git checkout</code> any previous state to see e.g. “how did my repo look last year”.</p><p><strong>It’s private</strong> so you never have to trust any third party with all your financial details. Everything can be stored in locations that you fully control.</p><p><strong>There’s no lock-in.</strong> Because everything is just a plain text file, it’s trivially easy to change how you want things to be represented: you don’t have to deal with apps with broken or messy CSV exports making it difficult to take your data elsewhere.</p><p><strong>It’s scriptable</strong>. If you want to refactor something, compute a new breakdown or even rewrite your system entirely, all you need is to write a script. Whether you write it yourself or prompt an LLM to do it for you, the text-based format makes automation trivial.</p><p>Plain text gives you the abstract idea of “storing transactions in text” but there’s still a bunch of questions. What’s the transaction syntax? How do you parse your files? How do you validate that everything balances, compute totals, and let you query the results? That’s where <strong>Beancount</strong> comes in.</p><h4 id="introducing-beancount">Introducing Beancount!</h4><p>Over the years, people have written many plain-text accounting tools which answer all the questions above. The main ones you’ll find which have gained a lot of popularity are <strong>Ledger</strong>, <strong>hledger</strong>, and <strong>Beancount</strong>. I’ve used each of them at some point in my plain text journey and all are solid choices. But I ended up on Beancount for a few reasons.</p><p><strong>It’s a Python library</strong>, not just a command-line tool. I can write importers that parse my bank’s PDF statements, generate transactions programmatically, and build custom reports, all in a language I already know.</p><p><strong>Strictness by default</strong>. Accounts must be declared before use, so typos get caught immediately. Transactions must balance and there are immediate error messages if they don’t. The tool catches mistakes early rather than letting them propagate.</p><p><strong>Plugin and tool ecosystem</strong>. Beancount has a very rich set of libraries and tools which build on top of and integrate with it. Along with the core project, you get access to any and all of these projects you want to use. We’ll discuss this much more later.</p><p><strong><a href="https://github.com/beancount/fava">Fava</a></strong>. The web UI which sits on top of the Beancount engine. It’s so good that people convert from other formats (using tools like <a href="https://github.com/beancount/ledger2beancount">ledger2beancount</a> or <a href="https://github.com/shivanshu7/gnucash2beancount">gnucash2beancount</a>) just to use it. Where Beancount gives you the reliable engine, Fava gives you the pretty yet powerful frontend:</p><ul><li><strong>Reports</strong>: balance sheet, income statement, transaction journal</li><li><strong>Query editor</strong>: SQL-like queries, exportable to CSV</li><li><strong>Charts</strong>: spending breakdowns, net worth over time, holdings by currency</li><li><strong>Error highlighting</strong>: problems highlighted immediately</li><li><strong>Extensibility</strong>: plugins like <a href="https://github.com/andreasgerstmayr/fava-dashboards">fava-dashboards</a> and <a href="https://github.com/andreasgerstmayr/fava-portfolio-returns">fava-portfolio-returns</a></li></ul><p>With this, we now understand enough of the basic concepts for us to get started trying out Beancount!</p><h2 id="chapter-2-getting-started">Chapter 2: Getting Started</h2><p>The best way to learn plain-text accounting is to roll up your sleeves and try it out. So let’s pause the theory for a moment and get a real ledger running on your machine.</p><p>I’ve built a companion repository, <a href="https://github.com/LalitMaganti/beancount-blog-examples">LalitMaganti/beancount-blog-examples</a>, which contains a cut-down version of the system I use day-to-day. The repo is organized into folders that match the chapters of this post (<code>chapter-2/</code>, <code>chapter-3/</code>, etc.), each building on the previous. It also includes a <code>demo/</code> folder with 2+ years of synthetic history if you want to see the end result immediately.</p><p><strong>To get started, clone the repository:</strong></p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>git clone https://github.com/LalitMaganti/beancount-blog-examples.git
</span></span><span><span>cd beancount-blog-examples

</span></span><span><span>./scripts/quickstart.sh demo
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span># Or start Chapter 2 to follow the guide</span>
</span></span><span><span>./scripts/quickstart.sh chapter-2
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This will set up a Python environment, install dependencies, and open Fava at http://localhost:5000. Here’s what you should see.</p><p><img src="https://lalitm.com/img/one-number-i-trust/02-first-look-trial-balance.png" alt="Fava Trial Balance showing Assets, Income, and Expenses" title="First look at Fava"></p><p><em>Fava's Trial Balance view shows assets, income, and expenses in one place.</em></p><p><img src="https://lalitm.com/img/one-number-i-trust/03-sunburst-expenses.png" alt="Sunburst chart breaking down expenses" title="Visualizing expenses"></p><p><em>Sunburst charts make it easy to spot your biggest expense categories instantly.</em></p><p>Click around the different tabs. You’ll find that Fava gives you the following:</p><ul><li><strong>Balance sheet</strong>: the state of your accounts at the current point in time. Basically think of it as an aggregate view of all your finances. You can answer questions like “what’s my net worth now?”, “how much money do I owe across my credit cards?” or “how much have I gained from investments?”</li><li><strong>Income statement</strong>: the sum of all the money flows into/out of your accounts. Think of it as a sum of all the income and expenses across time. You can answer questions like “how much did I earn from my job?”, “how much did I spend on Amazon?” or “did I spend more or less than last year?”</li><li><strong>Transaction history</strong>: a flat list of all transactions you have in your journal. A way to see and search any transaction you’ve made across any accounts in your system.</li></ul><p><img src="https://lalitm.com/img/one-number-i-trust/04-query-console.png" alt="Fava Query Console running a SQL query" title="SQL for your finances"></p><p><em>The Query Console lets you run SQL-like queries against your financial data.</em></p><p>There’s much more to Fava’s features (queries, multi-currency, plugins) as we’ll see later on in the post.</p><p>You can also explore the text journal itself using a text editor. For example, here’s a grocery run and a payslip in the Beancount transaction format:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="fallback"><span><span>; chapter-2/src/transactions.beancount

It might seem alien at first but trust me when I say soon it’ll feel like the most natural thing in the world!</p><p><img src="https://lalitm.com/img/one-number-i-trust/05-ide-experience.png" alt="VS Code with Beancount extension showing syntax highlighting" title="The IDE Experience"></p><p><em>With a VS Code extension, you get syntax highlighting and auto-completion for your accounts.</em></p><p>Now that you have a working system, I want to share the hard-won insights that aren’t in the official docs. This post isn’t going to be a full Beancount tutorial. The <a href="https://beancount.github.io/docs/getting_started_with_beancount.html">official docs</a> are excellent for that (Fava even has a <a href="https://fava.pythonanywhere.com/example-beancount-file/income_statement/">demo</a> that you can try without downloading anything!).</p><p>Instead, I want to focus on the <em>architecture</em>: the decisions I wish I’d made correctly from day one. I’m writing this as if I’m speaking to my past self.</p><h4 id="start-with-one-account">Start with one account</h4><p>You don’t need to track everything on day one. Pick one account. Your main checking account is a good start. Get comfortable with the flow. Import statements, categorize transactions, check that balances match. Once that feels solid, add another account. Then another.</p><p>I started with my HSBC current account. Now, I have my whole financial life inside the system and I trust it wholeheartedly. But this happened one account at a time. If I tried to do everything in one go, I would certainly have been overwhelmed and given up on the whole thing.</p><h4 id="opening-balances">Opening balances</h4><p>Once you’ve picked your first account, you face an immediate problem: you may have opened that account years ago and there might already be thousands of transactions over that time. Trying to import them all in one go is another sure path to being overwhelmed and giving up.</p><p>Instead, a better idea is to pick a “starting date” at which you say “I will import everything from this day onwards”. But that poses its own problem: you already had money in that account, how do you tell Beancount it exists?</p><p>Well, Beancount has a <code>pad</code> directive that creates the balancing entry automatically:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="fallback"><span><span>; chapter-2/src/balance.beancount
</span></span><span><span>2024-01-01 open Equity:Opening-Balances
</span></span><span><span>2024-01-01 pad Assets:Lalit:UK:HSBC:Current:GBP Equity:Opening-Balances
</span></span><span><span>2024-01-02 balance Assets:Lalit:UK:HSBC:Current:GBP  1500.00 GBP
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The <code>pad</code> directive tells Beancount: “whatever amount is needed to make the balance assertion true, take it from <code>Equity:Opening-Balances</code> and put it in this account”. This is one of the rare cases you actually have to think about equity accounts (though not much beyond blindly using <code>Equity:Opening-Balances</code>!).</p><h3 id="structure-that-scales">Structure That Scales</h3><p>Adding a first account is easy and the second is straightforward, but adding a third, fourth, fifth… and you can easily find that things start becoming jumbled and messy. Just like code, putting a little bit of thought into the organization upfront goes a long way. This part covers the architectural decisions you’ll thank yourself later for.</p><h4 id="naming-asset-and-liability-accounts">Naming Asset and Liability accounts</h4><p>The structure of asset and liability account names is very important, much more than I initially gave them credit for. It’s a good idea to keep as much information in them as possible. Here’s what I’ve settled on:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="fallback"><span><span>; chapter-2/src/accounts.beancount
</span></span><span><span>2024-01-01 open Assets:Lalit:UK:HSBC:Current:GBP          GBP
</span></span><span><span>2024-01-01 open Assets:Lalit:UK:Barclays:Current:GBP      GBP
</span></span><span><span>2024-01-01 open Liabilities:Lalit:UK:AMEX:GBP             GBP
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The pattern is:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="fallback"><span><span>Type:Person:Region:Institution:Account:Currency
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Why this structure? Because it’s a lot easier to <em>remove detail</em> than add it in later! I initially started by not having the country, the currency or my name in the account. But over time, I wanted to understand:</p><ul><li>How much money I have in the UK vs the US?</li><li>How much cash (i.e. not investments) is in a certain currency?</li><li>How much of our household wealth was in my wife’s accounts vs my own (discussed in more detail in Chapter 6)?</li></ul><p>Having this information in the account name is great because Beancount’s SQL syntax makes it very easy to filter on account names. Want “all UK assets”? Filter on <code>:UK:</code>. Want “all HSBC accounts”? Filter on <code>:HSBC:</code>. Want “all GBP cash”? Filter on <code>:GBP</code>.</p><h4 id="powering-up-with-plugins">Powering up with Plugins</h4><p>Once you have a structure, you want to ensure it stays clean. This is where Beancount’s <strong>Plugins</strong> come in.</p><p>Plugins are Python scripts that run when your ledger loads. They can validate data, modify entries, or even generate new transactions automatically. You load them in your journal file like this:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="fallback"><span><span>plugin "beancount.plugins.check_commodity"
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Remember the transfer-in-flight pattern from Chapter 1? Here’s how it looks in Beancount:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="fallback"><span><span>; chapter-2/src/transactions.beancount
</span></span><span><span>; Money leaves on Saturday
</span></span><span><span>2024-03-16 * "Transfer to Barclays"
</span></span><span><span>  Assets:Lalit:UK:HSBC:Current:GBP      -1000.00 GBP
</span></span><span><span>  Assets:Lalit:Transfers:Internal        1000.00 GBP
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>; Money arrives on Monday
</span></span><span><span>2024-03-18 * "Transfer from HSBC"
</span></span><span><span>  Assets:Lalit:Transfers:Internal       -1000.00 GBP
</span></span><span><span>  Assets:Lalit:UK:Barclays:Current:GBP   1000.00 GBP
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Once both transactions are recorded, the transit account balance returns to zero, confirming the transfer is complete. If you record one leg of a transfer but forget the other, the transit account will simply show a non-zero balance.</p><p>Understanding where a non-zero balance in transfers is coming from is handled by my absolute favorite plugin, <strong><a href="https://github.com/redstreet/beancount_reds_plugins">beancount_reds_plugins.zerosum</a></strong>. It’s responsible for matching both sides of a transaction and moving it to a separate account, meaning my <code>Transfers:Internal</code> account only contains the actual “pending” transactions. Making this account empty is a surprisingly satisfying little “minigame” during my weekly imports (though it never lasts for long!).</p><p>There are also a couple more plugins that make handling closed accounts better:</p><ul><li><strong><a href="https://github.com/beancount/beancount/blob/master/beancount/plugins/close_tree.py">beancount.plugins.close_tree</a></strong> - When you close an account, automatically closes all child accounts too. Useful as you move your banking between institutions.</li><li><strong><a href="https://github.com/daniel-wells/beancount_checkclosed">beancount_checkclosed.check_closed</a></strong> - Validates that closed accounts have zero balance and no transactions after the close date.</li></ul><h4 id="the-boundary-of-your-system">The boundary of your system</h4><p>As you add accounts one by one, you’ll inevitably see money flowing to places you haven’t set up yet. Say you transfer £500 to a Natwest savings account you haven’t added to the system. Where does it go?</p><p>Specifically, use a named placeholder account in <code>Equity:Transfers</code>:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="fallback"><span><span>; chapter-2/src/transactions.beancount
</span></span><span><span>2024-03-15 * "Transfer to savings (not yet tracked)"
</span></span><span><span>  Assets:Lalit:UK:HSBC:Current:GBP     -500.00 GBP
</span></span><span><span>  Equity:Transfers:Natwest-Savings      500.00 GBP
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This essentially says: “£500 went to Natwest Savings, which I’m not tracking yet”. Putting it in an equity account means it doesn’t pollute your balance sheet with incomplete information <em>or</em> your income statement with false expenses.</p><p>Note also the best practice of using a <em>named</em> equity account per untracked destination, not a generic bucket; this was a mistake I made when I did this initially. You’ll thank yourself when you import your Natwest savings account later, you can just do a search-replace to rename the accounts <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>.</p><h4 id="organizing-your-repo">Organizing your repo</h4><p>As you add these patterns (transit accounts, multiple institutions, liability accounts) your single <code>journal.beancount</code> file will start to become unwieldy. Just like good software architecture, you want to organize upfront to be easy to maintain as the system continues to grow.</p><p>This is what the structure looks like with the concepts we have right now (it’ll get more complicated as we go deeper!):</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="fallback"><span><span>chapter-2/
</span></span><span><span>├── journal.beancount            # Main entry point, includes everything
</span></span><span><span>├── src/

</span></span><span><span>│   ├── transactions.beancount   # Primary transaction ledger
</span></span><span><span>│   └── balance.beancount        # Balance assertions
</span></span></code></pre></div><ul><li><code>src/</code> is what you write and edit (your “code”)</li><li><code>journal.beancount</code> is the entry point that includes everything</li><li>Later, <code>data/</code> will hold inputs from the outside world (raw statements: PDFs, OFX, CSVs)</li></ul><p>This organization is a small change but can make a big difference in your subconscious feeling about the state of your finances!</p><h4 id="exit-ramp">Exit ramp</h4><p>At this point, you have a solid foundation for tracking multiple accounts. If you stop here, you have a robust, auditable system for manual bookkeeping. You could continue adding transactions by hand indefinitely, and you’d still be miles ahead of any spreadsheet in terms of correctness and visibility.</p><p>But manual entry is a chore, and as your financial life grows, it becomes a bottleneck. In the next chapter, we’ll see how to automate the tedious part: getting transactions from your bank statements into your ledger without losing the control that plain-text accounting gives you.</p><h2 id="chapter-3-automated-import">Chapter 3: Automated Import</h2><h4 id="automation-is-king-but-harder-than-it-looks">Automation is king, but harder than it looks</h4><p>Inputting transactions by hand works for some people, but I don’t have the patience for it. Ever since I was young, I’ve always wanted to automate everything: it’s the reason why I became a software engineer in the first place!</p><p>But full automation is a dead end. Most banks don’t offer APIs, and scraping breaks constantly. 2FA flows change <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>, websites get redesigned, sessions expire. I tried this route, and it wasn’t worth it. Even in the US where aggregators like Plaid exist, coverage is patchy.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> In the UK, it’s impossible.</p><h4 id="the-hierarchy-of-data-sources">The hierarchy of data sources</h4><p>So what actually works? Well ideally your financial institution gives you something you can write a script against. But what that might be is non-obvious and counter-intuitive. Here’s the hierarchy I’ve landed on over time:</p><ul><li><strong>OFX is the gold standard.</strong> If your bank offers it, use it. The format is standardized, transactions have unique IDs, and deduplication is straightforward. Life is easy if you have good OFX.</li><li><strong>CSV is the deceptive runner-up.</strong> It seems like the logical choice. Structured data, right? But in practice, bank CSVs are often afterthoughts. I’ve seen column formats change without notice, “CSVs” that are actually weird custom formats spread over multiple lines, and rows coalesced in ways that lose critical information (like cost basis).</li></ul><p>So what do you do when OFX isn’t available and CSV isn’t trustworthy? You turn to an unlikely hero.</p><h4 id="why-pdfs-beat-csvs">Why PDFs beat CSVs</h4><p>It sounds backwards, but PDFs are often the most reliable data source available.</p><p>Banks have a strong incentive to get PDFs right. Customers actually read them. They’re legal documents that get printed and filed. If a bank messes up a PDF statement, they hear about it immediately. If they break a CSV export, it might go months without anyone noticing.</p><p>The key insight is that bank statement PDFs are almost always columnar. Of course, this relies on the PDF having a proper text layer; if your bank sends you scanned images, you’re out of luck (though I’ve yet to encounter one that does). When you convert them to text while preserving the layout, you get something that looks like this:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="fallback"><span><span>Date      Details                      Paid out     Paid in     Balance
</span></span><span><span>15 Jan 24 TESCO STORES 1234            42.50                    1,457.50
</span></span><span><span>16 Jan 24 TFL TRAVEL                    6.80                    1,450.70

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The columns are aligned by spaces, which means you can parse them as fixed-width data. The approach works in three steps:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Convert PDF to text</strong>: Run <code>pdftotext -layout statement.pdf statement.txt</code>. The <code>-layout</code> flag preserves the original column alignment.</p></li><li><p><strong>Find the table boundaries</strong>: Bank statements have predictable markers. HSBC uses “BALANCE BROUGHT FORWARD” at the start and “BALANCE CARRIED FORWARD” at the end. You extract just the transaction rows between these markers.</p></li><li><p><strong>Parse with fixed-width columns</strong>: Pandas’ <code>read_fwf</code> function is designed exactly for this. You put this logic inside the <code>extract()</code> method of your <code>beangulp</code> importer class, where it converts the text into a DataFrame:</p></li></ol><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="python"><span><span><span># Inside your Importer class</span>
</span></span><span><span>df <span>=</span> pd<span>.</span>read_fwf(

</span></span><span><span>    names<span>=</span>[<span>'Date'</span>, <span>'Details'</span>, <span>'Paid out'</span>, <span>'Paid in'</span>, <span>'Balance'</span>]
</span></span><span><span>)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The column positions come from inspecting the header row. In practice, I detect them dynamically by finding keywords like “Paid out” and “Paid in” in the header and using their character positions.</p><p>Once you have a DataFrame, generating Beancount transactions is straightforward. You write a small class that iterates through this DataFrame and maps each row to a Beancount <code>Transaction</code> object, filling in the date, amount, and payee. See my <a href="https://github.com/LalitMaganti/beancount-lalitm/blob/main/src/beancount_tools/importers/hsbc.py">HSBC importer</a> for a working example.</p><p>For 95% of my banks, this approach works great. However, there is one bank where the text spacing becomes very strange and so I need to use something else. That’s when I turn to <a href="https://tabula.technology/">Tabula</a>, a Java CLI that extracts data tables from PDFs, even very complex ones.</p><p>The main reason I don’t use it all the time is that it’s much slower. But it also succeeds in the cases where <code>pdftotext</code> fails. I run it to get a structured JSON output, from which I create transactions (see my <a href="https://github.com/LalitMaganti/beancount-lalitm/blob/main/src/beancount_tools/importers/hsbc_us_cc.py">HSBC US credit card importer</a>).</p><p>I’m sure some readers will have worries about the fragility of what I’ve described here. I can tell you from experience that in three years, neither my UK nor my US HSBC PDF importer has ever broken. Neither has my Schwab one, and my Aviva one has only needed a single change. So I can personally vouch that this approach works and works <strong>well</strong>.</p><h4 id="from-raw-data-to-transactions">From raw data to transactions</h4><p>OK, so now you have statements. What do you do then? There are two pieces to the puzzle: parsing statements into transactions, and categorizing those transactions.</p><p>For parsing, Beancount has an official importer framework called <a href="https://beancount.github.io/docs/beangulp.html">beangulp</a>. You write a Python class that knows how to read a particular file format (the <a href="https://github.com/LalitMaganti/beancount-blog-examples/blob/main/chapter-3/importers/hsbc.py">skeleton importer</a> in <code>chapter-3/</code> already uses this API). Beangulp handles the mechanics: identifying which importer handles which file, extracting transactions, and deduplicating against existing entries.</p><p>But beangulp just extracts transactions without making any judgment on which account the transaction should be booked against. It doesn’t know that Tesco is groceries or that British Airways is an airline. I go to a new restaurant. How does the system know that <em>is</em> a restaurant?</p><p>This leads to a very important conclusion: we <strong>cannot</strong> fully automate importing transactions for bank accounts and credit cards. However, that doesn’t mean we have to enter things manually either. There’s a middle ground.</p><p>Enter <a href="https://github.com/jbms/beancount-import">beancount-import</a><sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> (Note: this is a standalone tool, distinct from Fava’s built-in import features). It’s a web UI that uses your beangulp importers and adds a categorization layer on top. You run it, it opens in your browser, and it presents pending transactions one by one for review. Think of it as a staging area where you approve or tweak before anything hits your ledger.</p><p>For each transaction, it shows the raw data from your statement alongside a suggested categorization. You can accept the suggestion, override it with a different account, or skip it entirely. Once you decide, it moves to the next one. The interface is simple, mostly keyboard-driven and optimized for speed.</p><p><img src="https://lalitm.com/img/one-number-i-trust/06-import-ui.png" alt="Beancount Import Web UI" title="Visual Categorization"></p><p><em>The import UI allows you to manually categorize transactions, like this Tesco grocery run, while the system learns your preferences.</em></p><p>The categorization uses machine learning (old-school decision trees, running locally, no LLMs, no cloud). It learns from your previous choices: the first time you see “Tesco”, you pick “Expenses:Groceries”, and the second time it auto-suggests and you just hit Enter. After a few weeks, the system should know 90% of the types of transactions you make and it’s easy to correct the ones which it doesn’t.</p><p>Once you’re proficient, a month’s worth of transactions takes 5-10 minutes. Most are repeats and you’re just hitting Enter. You only pause on genuinely new merchants. This is the core of my weekly ritual, and why I’ve found categorization has not become a chore, even after doing it for years.</p><h4 id="exit-ramp-1">Exit ramp</h4><p>With automated imports and semi-automated categorization, the “hard work” of bookkeeping is mostly solved. For many, this is the endgame: a perfect record of where every penny went, updated in minutes each week.</p><p>But your net worth isn’t just cash in a bank account. It’s also the stocks, bonds, and funds that grow (or shrink) over time. Tracking these requires a few more tools to handle cost basis, dividends, and market prices. We’ll tackle those in Chapter 4.</p><h2 id="chapter-4-investments">Chapter 4: Investments</h2><p>Now for investments. It’s where things get more interesting, and I think there’s less material out there covering the nitty-gritty. Here are some lessons I’ve learned over the years.</p><h4 id="the-unified-mental-model">The Unified Mental Model</h4><p>The most important thing to realize is that Beancount treats <strong>everything</strong> as a commodity.</p><p>A share of Apple (<code>AAPL</code>) is a commodity. A US Dollar (<code>USD</code>) is a commodity. A British Pound (<code>GBP</code>) is a commodity. While Beancount <em>can</em> infer these on the fly, you’ll typically declare them explicitly in your journal (e.g., <code>2024-01-01 commodity AAPL</code>).<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup></p><p>This explicit declaration is a small but critical architectural win: it prevents a simple typo from creating a phantom currency, and it provides the metadata that advanced reporting plugins (like those used to calculate your portfolio performance) rely on to work correctly.</p><p>This means you don’t “buy stocks with money”. You simply exchange one commodity for another. The syntax for buying shares is identical to the syntax for exchanging currency.</p><h4 id="the-account-structure">The Account Structure</h4><p>Just like with bank accounts, I break investments down by institution and security.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="fallback"><span><span>; chapter-4/src/accounts.beancount

If you track all your dividends in a single <code>Income:Dividends</code> account, it’s easy to know “how much dividends did I earn total?”. But if you want to know “what was my AAPL dividend yield this year?”, you’re out of luck. Track at the leaf (<code>Income:IB:AAPL:Dividends</code>), and you can answer both questions.</p><h4 id="the-notation">The Notation</h4><p>With our accounts defined, we can now record the actual movement of assets. We use <code>{}</code> to denote cost (what we paid per unit) and <code>@</code> to denote price (what the unit is worth now).</p><p><strong>Example 1: Buying Stock</strong>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The <code>{185.00 USD}</code> is the <strong>cost basis</strong> and the <code>@ 185.00 USD</code> is the <strong>price</strong>.

No categorization needed: a buy is a buy, a dividend is a dividend. You don’t have new merchants to worry about.</p><p>This means you can skip beancount-import’s web UI and run your beangulp importers directly with output going straight to the ledger.

To solve this, I wrote the <a href="https://github.com/LalitMaganti/beancount-lalitm/blob/main/src/beancount_tools/plugins/ancillary_accounts.py">ancillary_accounts</a> plugin. Instead of manual account creation, you just add metadata to the main holding account:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="fallback"><span><span>2023-02-01 open Assets:Lalit:US:IB:Brokerage:BAC    BAC

For most people, this is a complete solution.</p><p>However, as you collect more data, you’ll find you want to look at it in different ways. Maybe you want a simplified view for daily use and a detailed one for tax season. Or maybe you’re not the only person in your household. In the final chapters, we’ll see how to scale this system to handle multiple views and multiple people.</p><h2 id="chapter-5-multiple-views">Chapter 5: Multiple Views</h2><p>Day-to-day, I want a simple view of my finances. Take-home pay as a single number, investments without tax calculations cluttering the screen. But at tax time, I need detail. Every payslip line item and capital gains calculated the way HMRC wants them. Recording the same transaction twice would be maintenance hell. So instead, I extract multiple views from a single journal.</p><p>I think of these as “lenses” on the data. Some lenses <strong>aggregate</strong>: rolling up transactions into balances, summaries, or dashboards. Others <strong>transform</strong>: collapsing detail you don’t need day-to-day, or expanding it when you do. Both read from the same source files; nothing is duplicated.</p><h4 id="aggregated-views">Aggregated views</h4><p>Fava is great for interactive exploration, but I also want textual snapshots I can version control. I have a script that generates daily summaries showing account balances, and a CI workflow that commits them automatically. In my setup this runs on a self-hosted Gitea instance on hardware I control, so the raw ledger never leaves machines I own. If you prefer, you can keep everything local-only or push to an encrypted remote; GitHub Actions works the same way if you’re comfortable with that trade-off. This gives me:</p><ul><li>A record of how balances changed day to day</li><li>An immutable snapshot at tax time of what the system showed</li><li>Git as audit trail: “What was my net worth on March 15th 2023?” is answerable with <code>git checkout</code></li></ul><p>The key script is <a href="https://github.com/LalitMaganti/beancount-blog-examples/blob/main/chapter-5/scripts/archive.py">archive.py</a>.

This allows me to have “Schrödinger’s Capital Gains”: they exist for the taxman, but not for my daily budget, all controlled by which view I load.</p><p>I don’t calculate the tax owed since that’s too complicated with allowances, rates, and bands; the system just tracks the gains. At tax time, I sum up the CGT-GBP balance and do the actual calculation on the tax form.</p><h4 id="exit-ramp-3">Exit ramp</h4><p>By separating your “source of truth” from your “lenses,” you get a system that grows with you. You can add new plugins or virtual currencies to solve specific problems (like taxes) without ever touching the raw transactions you’ve already imported.</p><p>In the final chapter, we’ll see the ultimate application of this: combining two people’s financial lives into one unified view.</p><h2 id="chapter-6-two-people-one-number">Chapter 6: Two People, One Number</h2><p>I got married at the start of the year, which brought a fundamental change to how I manage my finances. While many couples use joint accounts, we prefer to keep our individual accounts and perform occasional “normalization” transfers.

We accept that we lose the ability to split shared expenses by person, but the gain in simplicity is worth it.</p><h4 id="the-magic-solving-the-transfer-paradox">The “Magic”: Solving the Transfer Paradox</h4><p>Finally, we use the <code>rename_accounts</code> plugin in the <code>total/</code> folder to resolve the transfer paradox.</p><p>In my ledger, a transfer looks like a simple expense:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="fallback"><span><span>; chapter-6/lalit/src/transactions.beancount
</span></span><span><span>2024-01-20 * "Transfer to Wife"
</span></span><span><span>  Expenses:Lalit:Transfers:Wife       500.00 GBP
</span></span><span><span>  Assets:Lalit:UK:HSBC:Current:GBP
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In her ledger, it looks like income:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="fallback"><span><span>; chapter-6/wife/src/transactions.beancount
</span></span><span><span>2024-01-20 * "Transfer from Lalit"
</span></span><span><span>  Assets:Wife:UK:HSBC:Current:GBP     500.00 GBP
</span></span><span><span>  Income:Wife:Transfers:Lalit
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The “Translation Logic” in the combined view renames these into a shared transit account:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="fallback"><span><span>; chapter-6/total/journal-net.beancount
</span></span><span><span>plugin "beancount_reds_plugins.rename_accounts.rename_accounts" "{
</span></span><span><span>  'Expenses:Lalit:Transfers:Wife': 'Assets:Household:Transfers:Internal',
</span></span><span><span>  'Income:Wife:Transfers:Lalit': 'Assets:Household:Transfers:Internal',
</span></span><span><span>}"
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Now, when Fava loads the combined view, it sees £500 leave my account and enter <code>Assets:Household:Transfers:Internal</code>, and then £500 leave that same account and enter her bank account. The transit account nets to zero, and our household net worth remains unchanged.</p><h4 id="the-result">The Result</h4><p>This setup gives us the best of both worlds. I can maintain my own financial autonomy and see my personal “runway,” while we can simultaneously monitor our combined progress toward shared goals.</p><p><img src="https://lalitm.com/img/one-number-i-trust/12-household-balance-sheet.png" alt="Combined Household Balance Sheet" title="Two people, one number"></p><p><em>The final result: a unified household view that tracks legal ownership without sacrificing the "One Number" net worth total.</em></p><p>That’s the full system (see <a href="https://github.com/LalitMaganti/beancount-blog-examples/tree/main/chapter-6">chapter-6</a> for the complete multi-person structure). But how do I actually use it week to week?</p><h2 id="the-weekly-ritual">The weekly ritual</h2><p>Now here’s how I keep it current: the “20 minutes a week” I mentioned at the start:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Getting statements</strong>: During the week, banks email me saying a statement is available. Some attach PDFs directly; others require a login. Either way, I snooze the emails (I use inbox zero) until the weekend. For my wife’s accounts, I nudge her once a month and she drops stuff in a shared Drive folder.</p></li><li><p><strong>Running imports</strong>: On the weekend, I work through my snoozed emails. Note that I’m not updating every single account every week. I only download statements for the 3-4 accounts that saw activity; long-term investments often just get a monthly or quarterly check-in. I move each file to the correct <code>data/</code> subfolder for that institution (e.g., <code>data/hsbc-uk-current/</code>). My importer pipeline automatically runs <code>pdftotext</code> to extract text so the parsers can read it.</p></li><li><p><strong>Categorizing</strong>: I launch beancount-import, which opens a web UI in my browser:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>python -m beancount_import.webserver --journal lalit/journal-net.beancount
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>As I mentioned before, most transactions auto-categorize and I’m just hitting Enter: I buy groceries from the same place, pay my hosting costs to the same provider etc. New merchants do need some manual work, but it’s a matter of typing a few characters and again pressing Enter.</p></li><li><p><strong>Formatting and checking</strong>: I run <code>bean-format</code> (a Beancount utility that normalizes indentation and aligns amounts) to keep my transactions file tidy. This makes git diffs cleaner. Then I open Fava for a quick sanity check:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>fava lalit/journal-net.beancount
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Are transfer accounts zeroed out? Do expenses look legit? How are investments doing? If it all checks out, commit and push.</p></li></ul><p>That’s it. I try to stick to doing this <em>every week</em>, but sometimes I’m on holiday or just have other commitments. In that case, it’s 40 minutes every two weeks. The system is forgiving; I’m never behind for too long.</p><p>I also have some automation helping me out: during the week, I have a CI workflow that runs daily, regenerates summaries, and commits them. Whenever I want, I can check the repo and see what the numbers look like. I particularly like this because I can easily see the before/after numbers in a single file, so I can spot check “does this make sense”. And of course at any time, I can also open Fava if I want to go a bit deeper.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>That 2021 tax disaster feels like a lifetime ago. What started as “there must be a better way” became a system I actually trust. One number, always current, completely under my control.</p><p>The specifics will evolve as life changes and tools improve, but three principles have held for years now. I expect them to hold for decades:</p><p><strong>Double-entry everywhere.</strong> Every transaction balances. Money never appears from nowhere or vanishes into nothing. When something doesn’t add up, you know immediately.</p><p><strong>Plain text as the source of truth.</strong> Your financial history lives in files you can read, diff, grep, and version control. No vendor lock-in, no opaque databases, no trusting a third party with your data.</p><p><strong>Track at the leaf.</strong> Record transactions at the most granular level that makes sense. You can always aggregate up (<code>Income:Dividends</code> from <code>Income:IB:AAPL:Dividends</code>), but you can never disaggregate down. Capture the detail; collapse it later with views.</p><p>Finance systems are deeply personal. This post isn’t meant to say this is <em>the</em> system everyone should use, just what’s worked for me over several years.</p><p>Each chapter here could be its own post, so if you want me to go deeper on imports, investments, or the multi-person setup, let me know!</p></section><p><em>If you enjoyed this post, you can <a href="https://lalitm.com/page/about/#subscribe">subscribe</a> to my weekly roundup of recent posts, or follow via <a href="https://lalitm.com/index.xml">RSS</a>.</em></p></div>]]></description>

<p><span>BACKGROUND</span></p><p>Danish women vaccinated with the 4-valent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine (HPV types: 6/11/16/18) at age 14 in 2008 reached screening age in 2017, allowing assessment of long-term effects on prevalence, persistence and incidence of HPV infections.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><span>AIM</span></p><p>To examine the HPV status of cervical samples over time among women vaccinated as girls.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><span>METHODS</span></p><p>Between February 2017 and February 2024, residual material from cytology-analysed samples collected through the ‘Trial23’ study, part of the national screening programme, was tested for HPV16/18 and non-vaccine high-risk (HR) HPV types. Prevalence in first, second and third samples, and persistence and incidence between samples were calculated.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><span>RESULTS</span></p><p>Over 7 years, 8,659 women provided at least one sample, 5,835 at least two and 2,461 at least three. In 7,800 vaccinated women, HPV16/18 prevalence was 0.4% (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.2–0.5), 0.3% (95% CI: 0.1–0.4) and 0.2% (95% CI: 0.0–0.4) in three consecutive samples. Prevalence of non-vaccine HR HPV was 32% (95% CI: 31–33), 28% (95% CI: 27–29) and 31% (95% CI: 29–33). Persistence of HPV16/18 and non-vaccine HPV among vaccinated women was 40% and 53%. In adjusted analyses comparing vaccinated vs unvaccinated women, incidence was significantly lower for HPV16/18 (adjusted relative risk (aRR) &lt; 0.10) while incidence of non-vaccine HR HPV types was higher (aRR: 1.66; 95% CI: 1.12–2.45). No significant difference was observed for persistence.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><span>CONCLUSION</span></p><p>Our study provides real-world evidence of stable protection against HPV16/18 infections in women vaccinated as girls. Less intensive screening seems reasonable until women vaccinated with the 9-valent vaccine reach screening age, when screening should be reconsidered.</p>
