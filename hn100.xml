<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<article>
   
  <div><p>I am responsible for approving SSL certificates for my company. I‚Äôve developed a
process over the past couple of years that works well. My stakeholders
understand their roles and responsibilities and put up a minimal amount of fuss
as I review and approve each cert. What started out as a quarterly or
semi-monthly task has become a monthly-to-weekly task depending on when our
certs are expiring.</p>
<p>I appreciate the amount of trust put into certificates and understand that they
are a critical component of digital security. But this üí© is getting out of
hand.  When certificates underpin nearly all digital security, including VPNs,
WiFi, Email, Websites, APIs, and more, increasing the administrative burden of
managing them will have diminishing returns.</p>
<p>And, I think it‚Äôs going to push organizations away from traditional
Certificate Authorities (CAs) in the long run.</p>
<h2 id="validation-mechanisms">Validation Mechanisms</h2>
<p>Our certificate issuer used to allow a number of handy validation methods.</p>
<p>In 2021, <a href="https://knowledge.digicert.com/alerts/domain-validation-policy-changes-in-2021">they announced</a> that file-based domain validation would be
disallowed for wildcard certificates. When used for non-wildcard certs,
file-based domain validation would be required for every individual SAN/FQDN.
This was a minor annoyance, because at the time we had some automation that
would allow us to renew certs with minimal fuss.</p>
<p>File-based domain validation <em>was</em> less secure; one dangling DNS record or
webserver mis-configuration is all it takes to hijack a certificate. (I
recommend any organization leveraging PaaS platforms like AWS or GCP might want
to consider a thorough DNS inventory and cleanup if they haven‚Äôt recently; you
may be surprised by what you find.)</p>
<p>The remaining domain control validation (DCV) methods for my organization have
been reduced to two options: DNS TXT recrods and email-based validation. One of
these is completely useless: we don‚Äôt set up email addresses for every possible
subdomain, so email-based validation may as well not exist when we need to
update a certificate for <code>test.lab.corp.example.com</code> because there is no
<code><a href="https://www.chrislockard.net/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="8ef9ebece3effdfaebfccefaebfdfaa0e2efeca0ede1fcfea0ebf6efe3fee2eba0ede1e3">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></code>. But, it‚Äôs not just validation methods.
There are new defenses requiring more stringent validation.</p>
<p>DNS validation is a decent and secure option in an organization where DNS
management access is tightly controlled. I don‚Äôt generally have a problem with
it as it‚Äôs a straightforward and small time sink to implement.</p>
<h2 id="defending-against-hijacking-and-spoofing">Defending against Hijacking and Spoofing</h2>
<p>A recent change aims to thwart BGP hijacking and DNS spoofing attacks. Starting
next month, DigiCert (and presumably other CAs) will require <a href="https://www.digicert.com/blog/mpic-for-digital-certificates">Multi-Perspective
Issuance Corroboration (MPIC)</a> checks.</p>
<p>On the face of it, this seems like a good idea. MPIC requires CAs to perform DCV
from two or more global vantage points (RIR regions). This should dramatically
reduce the risk of mis-issuance via BGP attacks. But I wonder how many
organizations segment access to their apps based on geography that this will
impact. I <em>also</em> wonder how many organizations have had certificates mis-issued
due to BGP hijacking.</p>
<div>
  <p><span>‚ÑπÔ∏è</span></p><div>
    <p><strong>A Note on Timing</strong></p><p>A particular annoyance I‚Äôve encountered is the notification messages for these
potentially breaking changes. In several cases, I‚Äôve received notification of an
upcoming major change (like MPIC) just a few weeks before it will take place.</p>
<p>Communicating these major changes with such short timeframes is <em>extremely</em>
damaging to the trust and relationship I‚Äôve built with my stakeholders. I feel a
combination of guilt and frustration when I have to Slack a group of people I
<em>know</em> are swamped and sheepishly say ‚Äú<em>Hey, there‚Äôs a potentially huge breaking
change happening soon. Y‚Äôknow, for security. Please help me make sure we aren‚Äôt
going to break anything when this goes live.</em>‚Äù</p>

  </div>
</div>


<p>Yes, this will improve the warm fuzzy security feeling we all want at night, but
how much <em>actual</em> risk is this requirement mitigating? The email notifications
telling me I have weeks to implement this change make vague assertions of the
risks, almost like they are trying to justify a thought exercise. Or an
<a href="https://www.princeton.edu/~pmittal/publications/bgp-tls-hotpets17">academic theoretical</a> (which itself acknowledges ‚Äúno study has yet
to measure the effectiveness of these attacks on real-world certificate
authorities‚Äù)</p>
<p>Although certainly not exhaustive, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BGP_hijacking">Wikipedia page on BGP
hijacking</a> lists one example of a BGP hijack resulting in a mis-issued
certificate, and that was for a South Korean cryptocurrency company in 2021.
Total loss (according to Wikipedia): $1.9m USD.</p>
<p>Huh. I <em>wonder</em> if industry is going to lose more than $1.9m implementing MPIC?
ü§î</p>
<p>But the absolute worst change is coming, incrementally, over the next three
years.</p>
<h2 id="validation-lifetimes">Validation Lifetimes</h2>
<p>The most obnoxious change is the ongoing shortening of the certificate
validation window. Sure, letting certificates stay valid for 825 days was a bit
much. Okay. I get that. 10 year validation periods? Totes extreme.</p>
<p>Today, certificates are valid for 397 days or around 13 months. This is actually
a decent compromise between security and operational overhead, because it
ensures rotation without being too burdensome to schedules and AOP. The most
significant issue is when many certificates are grouped together on a single
expiration date, but that can be managed easily enough with some planning.</p>
<p>But by March 15, 2029, the maximum lifetime for an SSL certificate will be just
<strong><a href="https://www.digicert.com/blog/tls-certificate-lifetimes-will-officially-reduce-to-47-days">47 days</a></strong>.</p>
<p>47 days. <em>47 days!</em></p>
<p>Maybe AI will have made my job redundant by then and this will all be ChatGPT‚Äôs
problem. But I doubt it.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm sure in the Ivory Tower or the companies with extremely well-funded and
over-staffed security teams, this is no big deal. ‚ÄúBut of course we should do
this, it‚Äôs just a little more work for a team of 50 engineers with dedicated
developers!‚Äù Should I be grateful they didn‚Äôt decide on 47 hours instead?</p>
<p>I am grateful for a multi-year ramp-up to this change. But for the rest of us
treading water and trying to make significant incremental change, this does
nothing but dictate our roadmap for the next three years.</p>
<h2 id="money-changes-hands">Money Changes Hands</h2>
<p>So, with all of these challenges facing us, what is our organization to do? I‚Äôm
sure CAs like DigiCert are expecting to make more money off of us as we struggle
to implement these changes. Indeed, there are CA consulting services that will
offer to ‚Äúbring PKI and DNS together to validate domain ownership and issue
certificates without manual DNS record updates‚Äù.</p>
<p>For a fee, of course. By reaching out to the sales team, of course.</p>
<p>What I‚Äôm not sure the CAs are considering is that we will instead move as much
of our certificate business off of them as possible.</p>
<p>Any platforms that offer or include certificate management bundled with the
actual services we pay for will win our business by default. Even if there‚Äôs
incremental cost for so doing, we will gladly pay the platform to manage
certificates on our behalf since that frees up several expensive engineers from
that responsibility.</p>
<h2 id="so-what">So What?</h2>
<p>These validation tweaks and shrinking lifetimes are interconnected and they
amplify each other‚Äôs obnoxiousness. Each one, academically, makes sense for
improving security. However, I can‚Äôt help but wonder if the CA/Browser Forum is
aware of the cumulative impact of these changes on under-resourced organizations
or overworked IT departments. Maybe they are and they don‚Äôt care. But the CA
vendors should care, because I think they will lose business over incremental
changes like these.</p>
<p>My organization will almost certainly move much of our certificate business to
individual platforms or to free CAs like <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">letsencrypt</a> with
automation either taken care of for us or easily implemented.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_Certificate_Management_Environment">ACME</a> might be a solution to some of these challenges, but it‚Äôs not
problem-free. <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/docs/client-options/">Which client</a> do we use? Which resource-starved team
will manage the client and the infrastructure it needs? It will need time to
undergo code review and/or supplier review if it‚Äôs sold by a company. There will
be a requirement for secrets management. There will be a need for monitoring and
alerting. It‚Äôs not as painless as the certificate approval workflow I have
now.</p>
<p>Are these changes making the Internet more secure? Maybe. Probably. But it‚Äôs not
obvious to me that the trade-off is worth it if the work needed to manage
certificates prevents project work from getting done.</p>
<p>What is obvious to me is that my stakeholders and I are hurrying to offload
certificate management to our vendors and platforms and not to our CA.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><header> <time datetime="2024-05-28">2024/05/28</time></header><div><p>I recently started working at a Python shop. The reasons behind this choice of employment are very much unrelated to the technology stack. Python is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphemism">not my favorite programming language</a>. In fact, allow me to drop the euphemism and express my pure, unadulterated thoughts about it: I never liked Python, I see it as a huge red flag and I think the world would be a better place if we all decided to finally move on from it.</p><p>With that out of the way, let‚Äôs talk about how I‚Äôve recently started to come around to Python and actually kind of like it in some aspects?</p></div><h2 id="i-used-to-love-ruby">I (used to) love Ruby</h2><p>Ruby was my first love as a programmer. It is a playful, concise, elegant, expressive language that is built out of a handful of simple concepts with a good serving of syntax sugar on top.</p><ul><li>There‚Äôs no distinction between objects and primitives; everything is <em>actually</em> an object, <a href="https://ruby-doc.org/3.3.1/NilClass.html">even <code>nil</code></a>!</li><li>You can <a href="https://yehudakatz.com/2009/10/04/emulating-smalltalks-conditionals-in-ruby">reimplement <code>if</code></a> using blocks and two additional methods on <code>NilClass</code> and <code>FalseClass</code> if you want!</li><li>Method calls are just <a href="https://ruby-doc.org/3.3.1/BasicObject.html#method-i-__send__">syntax sugar for <code>send</code>ing messages to objects</a>!</li><li>You can define new methods on an object at call time <a href="https://ruby-doc.org/3.3.1/BasicObject.html#method-i-method_missing">using <code>method_missing</code></a>!</li></ul><div><p>Ruby was clearly <em>designed</em> taking inspiration from such language designer‚Äôs languages as Smalltalk and Lisp, and as a budding Schemer with an interest in programming language design, that inspired me a lot.</p><p>Now, Python and Ruby were the two most popular ‚Äúscripting‚Äù languages at the time. Ruby exploded thanks to Rails, and Python saw a lot of success as a language for data science and a better choice than Perl for command line tools and scripts.</p><p>The two languages were often compared and contrasted, and of course I, as a fan of Ruby, had a lot of opinions about Python.</p></div><h2 id="python-as-a-worse-ruby-and-an-even-worse-scheme">Python as a worse Ruby (and an even worse Scheme)</h2><div><p>I kind of lied earlier when I said that Ruby was my first love as a programmer. The first time I started to really <em>grok</em> programming was when I learned a little bit of Scheme. I learned recursion before<code>for</code> loops, and I learned immutability before mutability.</p><p>As I said in the beginning of this post, I didn‚Äôt like Python. My dislike for it was best exemplified by its choice to make <code>if</code> a <em>statement</em> rather than an expression. If you want to assign a variable conditionally in Python you have to <em>declare</em> it first, and then <em>mutate</em> it from inside the <code>if</code> statement, and this just didn‚Äôt sit right with me.</p><p>(Yes, you can also use the <code>&lt;then-expression&gt; if &lt;condition&gt; else &lt;else-expression&gt;</code> inline conditional, but that looks weird to me even now.)</p><p><code>lambda</code>s, my bread and butter as a Rubyist and Schemer, are replaced by horrible twisted versions of themselves that don‚Äôt allow statements. Even <code>print</code> was a statement before Python 3.0, so you couldn‚Äôt use it inside of a <code>lambda</code>. The horror!</p><p>In summary, Python to me just felt <em>unpleasant</em> to use. It‚Äôs a language that prides itself on having only one way to do things, and that way was usually not the one I wanted to use.</p></div><h2 id="type-systems-for-the-untypable">Type systems for the untypable</h2><div><p>At some point I found myself writing frontend code. JavaScript is not my favorite language, but TypeScript tried <em>very hard</em> to get me to love it.</p><p>I consider TypeScript to be the gold standard when it comes to type systems on top of dynamic languages. It is powerful enough to model almost all Real World JS, and while this approach introduces a lot of complexity, it also brought the language a lot of success.</p><p>TypeScript does a <em>bit</em> more work than your classic ML (as in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ML_(programming_language)">Meta Language</a>) type system. TypeScript can:</p></div><ul><li><a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/narrowing.html">Narrow</a> a variable‚Äôs type based on the return type of a function you call on it!</li><li>Manipulate types by <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/keyof-types.html">destructuring</a> and <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/mapped-types.html">constructing</a> them!</li><li><a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/conditional-types.html">Make choices</a> while constructing a type based on subtyping rules!</li></ul><div><p>The last two features in particular unlock some incredible type-level programming potential. TypeScript is one of the few type systems in which you can <a href="https://github.com/cassiozen/TDungeon">play a text adventure</a> and <a href="https://github.com/codemix/ts-sql">query a database</a>!</p><p>On top of being the most complex (and fun) type system of most languages out there, let alone those topping the TIOBE Index, TypeScript certainly makes JavaScript‚Äôs flaws a lot more bearable. It almost made me <em>enjoy</em> writing frontend code for a living.</p></div><h2 id="i-changed">I changed</h2><div><p>One thing I learned while writing TypeScript was that bad language features can be excused by some static analysis. <em>Maybe</em> not having <code>match</code> is ok when you have type narrowing based on control flow and unions. <em>Maybe</em> not having <code>if</code> expressions is ok when you can statically check that a variable was initialized after an <code>if</code> statement. <em>Maybe</em> <a href="https://www.hanselman.com/blog/stringly-typed-vs-strongly-typed">stringly typed</a> variables are ok when you can statically enumerate the magic strings and ensure they are constructed correctly.</p><p>I also started writing quite a bit of Rust, which is a great language to show your functional programmer friends when you want to tell them that mutability is <em>actually fine</em>.</p></div><h2 id="python-changed">Python changed</h2><div><p>Python is not the same language it used to be. Now it supports type hints! And <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#match-statements"><code>match</code> statements</a> with destructuring! Even <code>print</code> got turned into a normal function!</p><p>The type hints are easily my favorite feature. Not only do they provide type information to a good ecosystem of type checkers, but they can also be used by libraries to <a href="https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/">validate schemas</a> and <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/">simplify defining web APIs</a>.</p><p>I think they‚Äôre a great case study for integrating types in an existing ecosystem.</p></div><ul><li>They are built into the language, so unlike TypeScript where you need to insert a separate build step, there is no cost of adoption.</li><li>They are orthogonal to type checking and inspectable from within the language, so libraries like Pydantic can leverage them to bring benefits even to users who don‚Äôt run a type checker. Everybody wins!</li><li>The aforementioned libraries can serve as a gateway drug into the magical world of types ‚ú®</li></ul><p>And here are some features of Python that I like which are unrelated to types:</p><ul><li>Keyword arguments. You can call any function using the argument names as keywords without any ceremony in the function definition. I wish every language had this feature!</li><li>It has namespaces, which are pretty good.</li><li>The lambdas are bad, but comprehensions and generator functions are neat. They remind me of F#‚Äôs sequence expressions.</li><li>Having preferably only one way to do things is a good feature when you‚Äôre working with many people on a project.</li></ul><h2 id="ruby-didnt-change">Ruby didn‚Äôt change</h2><div><p>So where does that leave Ruby, my former favorite language? Well, Ruby didn‚Äôt change as much in the last 10 years. A bunch of performance work to benefit big applications like Rails, a couple of interesting features that didn‚Äôt seem to catch on, and a handful of new syntax additions that don‚Äôt amount to much. Nothing quite as game-changing as type hints. Matz doesn‚Äôt seem to care for them.</p><p>I still use Ruby for some scripts because I know it like the back of my hand, but‚Ä¶ it just doesn‚Äôt feel the same. I get just a bit more irked by its quirks. I miss features from other languages. I long for keyword arguments, type hints, namespaces, I long for‚Ä¶ Python!?</p><p>Maybe this is a sign that I‚Äôve changed too much for Ruby. We had a lot of fun together, but it‚Äôs time to leave it behind. Goodbye Ruby, and thanks for all the chunky bacon.</p><p>And to Python I say: good job! You can have one of my midnight chicken nuggets. You deserve it.</p></div></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/dangerous-advice/">https://www.seangoedecke.com/dangerous-advice/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45022874">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><header></header><section><p>I‚Äôm a big fan of ‚Äúsharp tools‚Äù. These are tools that are powerful enough to be hugely helpful or harmful, depending on how they‚Äôre used. Most forms of direct production access are in this category: like ssh or kubectl, or a read-write prod SQL console. It‚Äôs also possible to give ‚Äúdangerous advice‚Äù. Dangerous advice is dangerous because (like sharp tools) it takes competence and judgment to use well. Giving the wrong person dangerous advice is like giving the wrong person production SQL access - they might go off and do something enormously destructive with it.</p>
<p>I give a lot of dangerous advice on this blog. For instance, I advise readers to:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/what-is-important">Make your own decisions about what to work on</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/breaking-rules">Deliberately break written company rules sometimes</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/taking-a-position">Take strong positions even when you‚Äôre uncertain</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/programmer-archetypes">Identify as a bit of a ‚Äògrifter‚Äô</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/how-to-ship">Deliberately avoid all non-shipping activities</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I worry about some readers making the wrong decisions about what to work on, or breaking the rules in the wrong way, and so on. I don‚Äôt like the idea that I‚Äôve contributed to harming someone‚Äôs career. But I think dangerous advice is important to write down <em>somewhere</em>. </p>
<h3>Most career advice is fake</h3>
<p>The main reason why is that <strong>strong engineers crave dangerous advice</strong>, for the same reason they crave sharp tools. Most career advice is fake: written to avoid liability, or to impress people. If you‚Äôre serious about getting things done, you‚Äôll end up doing some of these things because they‚Äôre obviously helpful.</p>
<p>It can be deeply alienating to <em>know</em> things don‚Äôt work the way they officially should, but to have nobody to talk about it with. When I was a more junior engineer, I really appreciated the few peers I had who were willing to get real with me (off the record).</p>
<h3>Managers can‚Äôt tell it to you</h3>
<p>Another reason why is that <strong>managers will almost never give you dangerous advice</strong>, even if it‚Äôs what you need to hear. If a manager tells you to ignore company policy, and you do it wrong - for instance, if you post in Slack that you‚Äôre doing it and your manager said it was OK - then that‚Äôs bad for them. In fact, it‚Äôs much worse for them than it is for you. Tech company leadership often views engineers as useful idiots. Managers are expected to be professionals.</p>
<p>However, lots of managers wish they could give you advice like this. They certainly appreciate it when you follow it. I‚Äôve never been a manager, but it must be incredibly frustrating to manage strong engineers who would be much more effective if they approached work a little more tactically (and a little less according to the written job description).</p>
<p>Dangerous advice requires courage to follow. It‚Äôs very high-risk, high-reward, and is thus disproportionately useful to strong engineers (and harmful to weaker ones). If you don‚Äôt feel comfortable following it, you definitely shouldn‚Äôt. But if you‚Äôre already operating like this sometimes and wondering whether you‚Äôre making some horrible long-term mistake, I don‚Äôt think so. Or if you are, I‚Äôm making it too!</p></section><p>If you liked this post, consider <a href="https://buttondown.com/seangoedecke" target="_blank">subscribing</a> to email updates about my new posts, or <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/submitlink?u=https://www.seangoedecke.com/dangerous-advice/&amp;t=Dangerous%20advice%20for%20software%20engineers" target="_blank">sharing it on Hacker News</a>.</p><p>April 5, 2025<!-- -->&nbsp;‚îÇ Tags: <a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/tags/good%20engineers/">good engineers</a>, <a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/tags/tech%20companies/">tech companies</a></p><hr></article></div>]]></description>

<p>One of my pet peeves is when command-line tools look for user configuration
files in <code>~/Library/Application Support</code> when running on macOS. In addition to
offering poor ergonomics for users, I believe this behavior is <em>incorrect</em>
according to the documentation which is cited to justify it. Instead,
command-line tools should implement the <a href="https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/latest/">XDG Base Directory Specification</a>
and look for configuration files in <code>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME</code>, which defaults to
<code>~/.config</code>.</p>
<p>Usually, when a program looks for configuration files in <code>~/Library/Application Support</code>, it‚Äôs not because of an intentional design decision. Instead, the
author delegated that decision to a library, and several popular libraries for
determining platform-specific configuration directories use
<code>~/Library/Application Support</code> as the default configuration directory on
macOS, including <a href="https://pypi.org/project/platformdirs/">Python‚Äôs <code>platformdirs</code> package</a> (<a href="https://pypistats.org/packages/platformdirs">242
million downloads / month</a>), <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/env-paths">JavaScript‚Äôs
<code>env-paths</code></a> (95 million downloads / month), <a href="https://lib.rs/crates/dirs">Rust‚Äôs <code>dirs</code>
crate</a> (4.8 million downloads / month), and <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/adrg/xdg">Go‚Äôs <code>adrg/xdg</code>
package</a> (used in 913 packages). While <code>~/Library/Application Support</code>
may be the correct configuration directory for <em>GUI apps</em> which manage their
configuration files for the user automatically, the vast majority of
applications using these libraries are command-line utilities whose
configuration belongs in <code>~/.config</code>.</p>
<p>The main reason I dislike programs looking for dotfiles in
<code>~/Library/Application Support</code> is that it‚Äôs <em>unexpected.</em> As <a href="https://github.com/nushell/nushell/issues/893#issuecomment-1736736555">Ashlin Eldridge
explained on GitHub</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a new user, it‚Äôs extremely surprising to me to that a modern tool like
<code>nu</code> would put config files under Application Support on macOS. It‚Äôs even
more surprising to see that some people are
<a href="https://github.com/nushell/nushell/discussions/5279">actively</a>
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33425312">against</a> adopting the XDG
standard.</p>
<p>The origins of XDG no longer matter at this point. No one really cares what
the X, D, and G stand for. The fact is that
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.jp/index.php/XDG_Base_Directory">hundreds</a> of tools
support it (including Git, Emacs, Neovim, Tmux) and users have come to expect
support for it. It‚Äôs the closest thing we have to a standard that allows
users to control the placement of their config files (which facilitates
users‚Äô ability to source control their files) and it also includes support
for files that shouldn‚Äôt be source controlled such as cache and data files.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If a user explains that they found a program‚Äôs behavior surprising, many
engineers will respond by telling the user that their expectations were wrong.
However, I find that the reason users form an incorrect mental model of a
program‚Äôs behavior is usually because the program‚Äôs design violated an
established convention from some broader context. In accordance with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment">the
Principle of Least Astonishment</a>, I prefer to change the program to
behave how users expect rather than futilely attempt to change what users
expect.</p>
<p>Users expect macOS CLI tools to look for configuration files in <code>~/.config</code> is
because <strong>that‚Äôs what almost every other program does.</strong> Your program should
probably not disagree with Bash and Vim and Git about where configuration files
are supposed to go!</p>
<p>These conventions help us explore unfamiliar systems by letting us apply
knowledge about one part of the system to other parts of the system.
Consistency is predictability. When every tool works the same except for a
small handful, users get justifiably annoyed at the exceptions for wasting
their time.</p>
<h2 id="what-do-dotfile-managers-do"><a href="#what-do-dotfile-managers-do" aria-label="Link to section what-do-dotfile-managers-do">#</a>What do dotfile managers do?</h2>
<p>Many engineers use (or maintain) some sort of dotfile manager to handle
tracking these configuration files. If configuration files are really supposed
to go in <code>~/Library/Application Support</code>, we would expect dotfile managers to
put configuration files there by default when running on macOS. After all, the
whole point of a dotfile manager is to simplify managing configuration files
across multiple machines and platforms. Let‚Äôs take a quick survey to see how
some popular dotfile managers behave on macOS:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.chezmoi.io/">chezmoi</a> (14.3k stars) makes no effort to link
configuration to <code>~/Library/Application Support</code>, despite including
<a href="https://www.chezmoi.io/user-guide/machines/macos/">documentation for using chezmoi on macOS
specifically</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot">dotbot</a> (7.3k stars) ignores
<code>~/Library/Application Support</code>. Despite including macOS-specific
configuration files in the examples, the README shows a configuration for VS
Code that will be completely ignored on macOS.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/yadm-dev/yadm">yadm</a> (5.5k stars) makes no effort to
support <code>~/Library/Application Support</code>. The example configurations include
macOS-specific portions but also do not reference <code>~/Library/Application Support</code>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm">rcm</a> (3.2k stars) makes no effort to
support <code>~/Library/Application Support</code>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/">GNU Stow</a> makes (unsurprisingly) no
effort to support <code>~/Library/Application Support</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of these tools are <em>able</em> to link configuration files to
<code>~/Library/Application Support</code> if you ask them to explicitly (although macOS
will regularly replace your symlinks with copies of the destination files), but
the fact that they don‚Äôt bother to do so by default is revealing. Users only
want this behavior for specific misbehaving programs.</p>
<h2 id="an-appeal-to-logic"><a href="#an-appeal-to-logic" aria-label="Link to section an-appeal-to-logic">#</a>An appeal to logic</h2>
<p>Perhaps ‚Äúconsistency‚Äù isn‚Äôt a good enough reason for you to place your
program‚Äôs configuration files in <code>~/.config</code> like everybody else. Maybe you
think that programs should follow the platform guidelines, even if they don‚Äôt
match developer expectations. <a href="https://github.com/dirs-dev/directories-rs/issues/47#issuecomment-478337412">@soc on GitHub</a> phrases it like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a general advice for macOS devs: If you are developing on their platform,
do what the platform owners tell you. They are the lords, you are the
share-croppers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Elsewhere, <a href="https://github.com/nushell/nushell/issues/12103#issuecomment-1982144513">Reilly Wood rebukes</a> a user asking if there would ‚Äúbe any
downside to just not using <code>Application Support</code> ever‚Äù by saying that ‚Äú[Nushell
would] no longer be following the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/FileManagement/Conceptual/FileSystemProgrammingGuide/FileSystemOverview/FileSystemOverview.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010672-CH2-SW6">macOS Standard Directories
guidelines</a>.‚Äù</p>
<p>We‚Äôll read through those guidelines in a minute, but it‚Äôs not entirely clear to
me that they‚Äôre relevant in the first place. The <a href="https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/latest/">XDG Base Directory
Specification</a> mentions Unix a few times but lists no carveouts for macOS
or any other operating system. If <code>~/.config</code> is accepted as the standard
location for configuration files on Unix-like operating systems, then surely it
would be the standard location on macOS as well, given that macOS is a Unix by
way of BSD.</p>
<p>But suppose we accept that the XDG specification only applies to <em>some</em> Unix
operating systems, despite making no mention of this. The <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/FileManagement/Conceptual/FileSystemProgrammingGuide/FileSystemOverview/FileSystemOverview.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010672-CH2-SW6">macOS Standard
Directories</a> documentation starts by stating that
‚Äú[w]hether provided by the system or created by your app, every file has its
place in macOS‚Äù, and honestly we could stop reading right there, because <strong>a
command-line tool is not the system or an app.</strong></p>
<p>While this might seem like a pedantic nitpick, in reality it‚Äôs <em>critical</em> to
correctly interpreting this documentation! I suspect that many of the
developers who cite these guidelines do not know very much about macOS and
think that ‚Äúapp‚Äù is just what macOS calls executables, but that‚Äôs not true. A
couple screens down, the same page says that <code>/bin</code> ‚Äú[c]ontains essential
command-line binaries‚Äù, so we can be sure the authors aren‚Äôt conflating apps
and command-line tools. Apps on macOS are installed in <code>/Applications</code> and are
subject to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/preparing-your-app-for-distribution">a number of additional requirements</a>, from a bundle ID
(a unique reverse-DNS identifier for an app, like <code>com.apple.Preview</code> for
<code>Preview.app</code>) to application icons, launch screens, code signing,
notarization, app sandboxing, and runtime hardening. Needless to say, none of
the developers shipping command-line utilities are following any of <em>these</em>
guidelines.</p>
<p>Moving on, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/FileManagement/Conceptual/FileSystemProgrammingGuide/MacOSXDirectories/MacOSXDirectories.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010672-CH10-SW1">the documentation for <code>~/Library/Application Support</code></a> says that it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Contains all app-specific data and support files. These are the files that
your app creates and manages on behalf of the user and can include files that
contain user data.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, command-line tools do not have <em>any</em> app-specific data because they are
not apps. Further, dotfiles are usually written by hand and not managed <em>on
behalf of</em> the user.</p>
<p>The next paragraph makes it very clear that <code>~/Library/Application Support</code> is
for apps only:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By convention, all of these items should be put in a subdirectory whose name
matches the bundle identifier of the app. For example, if your app is named
<code>MyApp</code> and has the bundle identifier <code>com.example.MyApp</code>, you would put your
app‚Äôs user-specific data files and resources in the <code>~/Library/Application Support/com.example.MyApp/</code> directory. Your app is responsible for creating
this directory as needed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Command-line tools do not have a bundle identifier, including many command-line
tools shipped with macOS by Apple (such as <code>ls</code> or <code>vim</code>). And even though
<a href="https://git.lix.systems/lix-project/lix/issues/515">Apple feels very comfortable shipping command-line tools that behave in a
subtly different manner from their equivalents on other modern Unix-descendent
operating systems,</a> the macOS variants of <code>bash</code>, <code>zsh</code>, <code>git</code>, and
<code>vim</code> all look for their configuration files in the same place: <code>~/.config</code>.
Unless your tool is installed in <code>/Applications</code>, there‚Äôs no reason for its
configuration to live in <code>~/Library/Application Support</code>.</p>
<h2 id="when-should-you-use-library-application-support"><a href="#when-should-you-use-library-application-support" aria-label="Link to section when-should-you-use-library-application-support">#</a>When <em>should</em> you use <code>~/Library/Application Support</code></h2>
<p>With the guidelines and conventions listed above in mind, your application
should store its configuration files in <code>~/Library/Application Support</code> instead
of <code>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME</code> if both of the following conditions apply:</p>
<ol>
<li>It is a GUI application installed in <code>/Applications</code> or <code>~/Applications</code>.</li>
<li>It manages its configuration files automatically on behalf of the user,
rather than expecting the user to write their configuration in a text file
themself.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="tl-dr"><a href="#tl-dr" aria-label="Link to section tl-dr">#</a>TL;DR</h2>
<p>Users do not expect command-line tools to look for configuration files in
<code>~/Library/Application Support</code> on macOS. Dotfile managers do not place
configuration files in <code>~/Library/Application Support</code> on macOS. The most
commonly-cited justifications for placing configuration files in
<code>~/Library/Application Support</code> are not meant to apply to command-line tools at
all. Even command-line tools like <code>bash</code> and <code>git</code> shipped by Apple look for
their configuration files in <code>~/.config</code>.</p>
<p>Please, please, <em>please</em> just use the <a href="https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/latest/">XDG Base Directory Specification</a>.</p>

<p>This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-4De-zNTT4">minute-long clip of a Will Smith concert</a> is blowing up online for all the wrong reasons, with people accusing him of using AI to generate fake crowds filled with fake fans carrying fake signs. The story‚Äôs blown up a bit, with coverage in <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/will-smith-ai-crowd-tour-video-1235415353/">Rolling Stone</a>, <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/will-smith-accused-of-creating-ai-fans-in-new-tour-video-3887232">NME</a>, <a href="https://www.the-independent.com/arts-entertainment/music/news/will-smith-tour-video-ai-crowd-fans-signs-b2813526.html">The Independent</a>, and <a href="https://consequence.net/2025/08/will-smith-ai-crowds-video/">Consequence of Sound</a>.</p>

<p>And it definitely looks terrible! The faces have all the characteristics of AI slop, with familiar artifacts like uncanny features, smeared faces, multiple fingers/limbs, and nonsensical signage. ‚ÄúFrom West Philly to West SwigÃ¥ÃïÃôgÃ∑ÃîÕúÃ§y‚Äù?</p>



<figure><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/will_smith_slop-1024x576.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/will_smith_slop-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/will_smith_slop-300x169.jpg 300w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/will_smith_slop-768x432.jpg 768w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/will_smith_slop-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/will_smith_slop-2048x1152.jpg 2048w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/will_smith_slop-800x450.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>It gets worse the more you look at it.</figcaption></figure>



<p>But here‚Äôs where things get complicated.</p>



<p><strong>The crowds are real. </strong>Every person you see in the video above started out as real footage of real fans, pulled from video of multiple Will Smith concerts during his recent European tour.</p>







<p>The main Will Smith performance footage in the clip is from the Positiv Festival, held last month at the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DMx76OzMdxO/">Th√©√¢tre Antique d‚ÄôOrange</a> in Orange, France. (Here‚Äôs a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZLQ-fARByI">phone recording</a> from the audience of the first half of the performance.) It‚Äôs intercut with various shots of audiences from Gurtenfestival and Pal√©o in Switzerland, the Ronquieres Festival in Belgium, among others.</p>



<p>From this <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DMfgAkXRSyF/">slideshow of photos</a> from the Pal√©o festival in Nyon, Switzerland, you can see professionally-shot photos of the same audience from the video. </p>



<p>The signs, previously distorted, can now be read, like this one which actually reads ‚ÄúFrom West Philly to West Swizzy.‚Äù (Short for Switzerland, if you‚Äôre wondering.)</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="662" src="https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/will_smith_fan_signs_1-1024x662.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/will_smith_fan_signs_1-1024x662.jpg 1024w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/will_smith_fan_signs_1-300x194.jpg 300w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/will_smith_fan_signs_1-768x496.jpg 768w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/will_smith_fan_signs_1-800x517.jpg 800w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/will_smith_fan_signs_1.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="678" src="https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/will_smith_fan_signs_2-1024x678.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/will_smith_fan_signs_2-1024x678.jpg 1024w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/will_smith_fan_signs_2-300x199.jpg 300w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/will_smith_fan_signs_2-768x509.jpg 768w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/will_smith_fan_signs_2-1536x1017.jpg 1536w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/will_smith_fan_signs_2-2048x1357.jpg 2048w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/will_smith_fan_signs_2-800x530.jpg 800w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>One of the most egregious examples is the couple holding the sign thanking Will Smith for helping them survive cancer which ‚Äî <em>if it was AI-generated slop</em> ‚Äî would be pretty disgusting: a gross attempt to drum up sympathy with fake people.</p>



<p>In an <a href="https://www.the-independent.com/arts-entertainment/music/news/will-smith-tour-video-ai-crowd-fans-signs-b2813526.html">article</a> posted by <em>The Independent</em> today, music editor Roisin O‚ÄôConnor points to the couple as clear evidence of AI generation: </p>



<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúAnother shot shows a man‚Äôs knuckle appear to blur along with his sign, which reads ‚ÄòYou Can Make It‚Äô helped me survive cancer. THX Will.‚Äô Meanwhile, the woman in front of him is seemingly holding his hand, but the headband of the woman behind her is somehow over her wrist.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>



<p><strong>But the couple is real</strong>. There‚Äôs two good photos of them on Will Smith‚Äôs Instagram in a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DMVPEtPscFM/?img_index=5">slideshow</a> of photos and videos from Gurtenfestival in Bern last month.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="636" src="https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/will_smith_couple-1024x636.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/will_smith_couple-1024x636.jpg 1024w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/will_smith_couple-300x186.jpg 300w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/will_smith_couple-768x477.jpg 768w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/will_smith_couple-1536x953.jpg 1536w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/will_smith_couple-2048x1271.jpg 2048w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/will_smith_couple-800x497.jpg 800w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>You can see them in this video from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DMT6bldoD2G/">Will Smith‚Äôs Instagram post</a>, which I clipped below.</p>

</p></figure>



<h2>Two Levels of AI Enhancement</h2>



<p>So if these fans aren‚Äôt AI-generated fakes, what‚Äôs going on here?</p>



<p>The video features real performances and real audiences, but I believe they were manipulated on two levels:</p>



<ol>
<li>Will Smith‚Äôs team generated several short AI image-to-video clips from professionally-shot audience photos</li>



<li>YouTube post-processed the resulting Shorts montage, making everything look so much worse</li>
</ol>



<p>Let‚Äôs start with YouTube.</p>



<h2>YouTube‚Äôs Shorts ‚ÄúExperiment‚Äù</h2>



<p>Will Smith‚Äôs team also uploaded this same video to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DNQsphpxgrg/">Instagram</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/reel/739450732135683">Facebook</a>, where it looks <em>considerably</em> better than the copy on YouTube, without the smeary sheen of uncanny detail.</p>



<p>I put them side-by-side below. Try going full-screen and pause at any point to see the difference. The Instagram footage is noticeably better throughout, though some of the audience clips still have issues.</p>

<p>For the last <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2025/08/youtube-shorts-ai-upscaling/683946/">two months</a>, it turns out that YouTube was quietly experimenting with post-processing YouTube Shorts videos: unblurring and denoising videos with often-unpleasant results.</p>



<p>I first heard about this ten days ago, when guitarist Rhett Shull <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86nhP8tvbLY">posted a great video</a> about the issue, which now has over 700k views.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Five days ago, YouTube finally confirmed it was happening. YouTube‚Äôs Creator Liaison Rene Ritchie <a href="https://twitter.com/YouTubeInsider/status/1958199532363317467">posted on X</a> about the experiment.</p>



<figure><a href="https://twitter.com/YouTubeInsider/status/1958199532363317467"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="721" src="https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-15-1024x721.png" alt="" srcset="https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-15-1024x721.png 1024w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-15-300x211.png 300w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-15-768x541.png 768w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-15-800x563.png 800w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-15.png 1298w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<blockquote>
<div><p>In a <a href="https://twitter.com/YouTubeInsider/status/1958241868736815311">followup reply</a>, Ritchie clarified the difference, as he saw it:</p><p>GenAI typically refers to technologies like transformers and large language models, which are relatively new. Upscaling typically refers to taking one resolution (like SD/480p) and making it look good at a higher resolution (like HD/1080p). This isn‚Äôt using GenAI or doing any upscaling. It‚Äôs using the kind of machine learning you experience with computational photography on smartphones, for example, and it‚Äôs not changing the resolution.</p></div>
</blockquote>



<p>On Friday, Alex Reisner wrote about ‚Äú<a href="https://archive.is/JjXn9#selection-581.0-586.0">YouTube‚Äôs Sneaky AI ‚ÄòExperiment‚Äô</a>‚Äù in <em>The Atlantic</em>, and got another official statement from Google:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>When I asked Google, YouTube‚Äôs parent company, about what‚Äôs happening to these videos, the spokesperson Allison Toh wrote, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre running an experiment on select YouTube Shorts that uses image enhancement technology to sharpen content. These enhancements are not done with generative AI.‚Äù But this is a tricky statement: ‚ÄúGenerative AI‚Äù has no strict technical definition, and ‚Äúimage enhancement technology‚Äù could be anything. I asked for more detail about which technologies are being employed, and to what end. Toh said YouTube is ‚Äúusing traditional machine learning to unblur, denoise, and improve clarity in videos,‚Äù she told me.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>I agree with Reisner that it‚Äôs likely that a diffusion model is at work here and Google is trying to split hairs over the definition of ‚Äúgenerative AI‚Äù because of how divisive it is. </p>



<h2>Will Smith‚Äôs Generated Videos</h2>



<p>That explains why the entire YouTube Shorts video has that smeary look to it that isn‚Äôt present throughout the copy posted on Instagram, but <em>both</em> versions have those terrible audience shots with AI artifacts and garbled signage.</p>



<p>After looking at it, I believe that Will Smith‚Äôs team was using a generative video model, but not to create entirely new audience footage, like most people suspect.</p>



<p>Instead, they started with photos shot by their official tour photographers, and used those photos in <a href="https://academy.runwayml.com/gen4/gen4-image-to-video">Runway</a>, <a href="https://developers.googleblog.com/en/veo-3-fast-image-to-video-capabilities-now-available-gemini-api/">Veo 3</a>, or a similar image-to-video model to create a short animated clip suitable for a concert montage.</p>



<p>Let‚Äôs go back to the crowd photo from Pal√©o in Switzerland:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="768" height="1024" src="https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-16-768x1024.png" alt="" srcset="https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-16-768x1024.png 768w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-16-225x300.png 225w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-16-1152x1536.png 1152w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-16-800x1067.png 800w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-16.png 1440w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"></figure>



<p>I believe this is the <strong><em>exact</em></strong> photo that the crowd shot in the video was generated with. Here it is as a two-frame animation, with the first frame from the AI video overlaid on the original photo.</p>



<figure><video autoplay="" loop="" muted="" src="https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/will_smith_comparison_animation.mp4"></video></figure>



<p>Here‚Äôs another example. The photo below was taken at Ronquieres Festival in Belgium, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DNBJHKmx75j/?img_index=14">posted to Will Smith‚Äôs</a> Instagram three weeks ago.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="819" height="1024" src="https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-17-819x1024.png" alt="" srcset="https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-17-819x1024.png 819w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-17-240x300.png 240w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-17-768x960.png 768w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-17-800x1000.png 800w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-17.png 1080w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 819px) 100vw, 819px"></figure>



<p>And here‚Äôs the AI-generated clip that it was turned into.</p>



<figure><video autoplay="" loop="" controls="" src="https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fresh_prince.mp4"></video></figure>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Virtually all of the commenters on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-4De-zNTT4">YouTube</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=%22will+smith%22+ai&amp;type=posts&amp;sort=top&amp;t=week">Reddit</a>, and X believe this was fake footage of fake fans, generated by Will Smith‚Äôs team to prop up a lackluster tour. </p>



<p>Like the faces in the video, the truth is blurry. </p>



<p>The crowds were real, but the videos were manipulated: first by Will Smith‚Äôs team, and then without asking, by YouTube.</p>



<p>We can debate the ethics of using an image-to-video model to animate photos in this way, but I think it‚Äôs meaningfully different than what most people were accusing Will Smith of doing here: using generative AI video to fake a sold-out crowd of passionate fans.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-dtm-region="articulo_cuerpo"><p>Four of the main retail groups in the United States ‚Äî including the country‚Äôs and the world‚Äôs largest, Walmart ‚Äî have highlighted in their respective second-quarter earnings presentations the complexities their businesses face due to <a href="https://english.elpais.com/economy-and-business/2025-07-14/trump-sows-confusion-and-some-indifference-with-his-tariff-swings.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/economy-and-business/2025-07-14/trump-sows-confusion-and-some-indifference-with-his-tariff-swings.html">tariffs imposed by the Trump administration</a>. These tariffs have been the main topic of discussion for Walmart, Home Depot, Target, and Lowe‚Äôs ‚Äî listed retailers that are already feeling, to a greater or lesser extent, the effects of this trade policy.</p><p>As for results, the impacts have been cushioned by the companies‚Äô swift reaction, which involved applying various price increases, as well as activating efforts to achieve greater cost efficiencies. As Walmart‚Äôs president and CEO Doug McMillon acknowledged: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve continued to see our costs increase each week, which we expect will continue into the third and fourth quarters.‚Äù Target‚Äôs CEO, Brian Cornell, echoed this sentiment: ‚ÄúThe straight cost impact of tariffs will be with us as long as the tariffs are with us.‚Äù</p><p>All eyes were on Walmart. The global retail giant had already warned, in its first-quarter earnings release, that it could not absorb all the cost pressures resulting from tariffs, given the company‚Äôs ‚Äî and the industry‚Äôs ‚Äî thin margins. Even U.S. President Donald Trump pressured the company to absorb those expenses against its margins.</p><p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôre doing what we said we would do,‚Äù Doug McMillon explained last week. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre keeping our prices as low as we can, for as long as we can,‚Äù he added, reflecting the constant pressure on costs that continue to rise. ‚ÄúAs we replenish inventory at post-tariff price levels, we‚Äôve continued to see our costs increase each week, which we expect will continue into the third and fourth quarters.‚Äù </p><h3>Protecting margins</h3><p>According to its financial disclosures, Walmart has acted surgically on its pricing to protect its margins. The group increased its revenues in the first half of the year by 3.7%, compared with a 3.6% increase in procurement costs, allowing it to hold steady and even gain a tenth of a point in gross margin. The same pattern is seen in the second quarter alone: sales grew by 4.75%, while costs rose by 4.7%.</p><p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôre focused on the customer, kind of the fundamentals of the business, whether it‚Äôs pricing or inventory management,‚Äù McMillan explained. On the latter point, tariffs are also making themselves felt. In Walmart‚Äôs case, inventory value rose in the first half of the year by $2.1 billion, up 3.7% from a year earlier, ‚Äúdue to <a href="https://english.elpais.com/economy-and-business/2025-07-15/trumps-tariffs-are-starting-to-hit-consumers-wallets-inflation-climbs-to-27-in-june.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/economy-and-business/2025-07-15/trumps-tariffs-are-starting-to-hit-consumers-wallets-inflation-climbs-to-27-in-june.html">higher import costs.</a>‚Äù</p><p>The retail giant clarified that most of its purchases are made in the U.S., while one-third come from abroad ‚Äî mainly China, Mexico, Vietnam, India, and Canada. In the case of China, it is facing the looming threat of a 145% tariff, up from the current 30%.</p><p>Diversification of import sources is now a key concern for U.S. retailers. ‚ÄúOur teams have done an incredible job partnering with our vendors to diversify product sourcing,‚Äù Home Depot‚Äôs executive vice president, Billy Bastek, said last week. ‚ÄúWe will continue to work with our vendors to ensure that we have the right products at the right value in stock.‚Äù He specified that 50% of its merchandise is not subject to tariffs since it is sourced within the U.S.</p><p>Home Depot ‚Äî the world‚Äôs largest home improvement retailer ‚Äî acknowledges that there will be ‚Äúmodest price movements for some categories‚Äù because current tariffs ‚Äúare significantly higher than last quarter,‚Äù according to Bastek. He also announced a reduction in promotional activity for part of its offerings.</p><p>Like Walmart, Home Depot has fine-tuned its pricing strategy, especially in the second quarter. During that period, its revenues grew 4.86%, while procurement expenses increased 4.84% ‚Äî enough to support its margin.</p><h3>Exposure to foreign markets</h3><p>Two other major U.S. retailers are more exposed to <a href="https://english.elpais.com/economy-and-business/2025-06-08/luxury-isnt-what-it-used-to-be-whats-happening-to-the-worlds-most-exclusive-brands.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/economy-and-business/2025-06-08/luxury-isnt-what-it-used-to-be-whats-happening-to-the-worlds-most-exclusive-brands.html">high levels of imports</a>. Lowe‚Äôs ‚Äî which also specializing in home improvement products ‚Äî sources 60% of its merchandise outside the U.S., with 20% coming from China. ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt that way seven years ago,‚Äù said Lowe‚Äôs chairman and CEO, Marvin R. Ellison, last week. ‚ÄúWe have done, in my estimation, an excellent job of working cross functionally relative to looking for diversification.‚Äù</p><p>Like the rest of the sector, Lowe‚Äôs is also applying price increases with a category-specific approach. ‚ÄúSpecific to pricing, we said [...] we would be pricing competitive [...] That‚Äôs what we‚Äôre continuing to do,‚Äù said Ellison. ‚ÄúPrices in retail will always be dynamic. Your prices will fluctuate up and down through various categories based on competitive responses, internal algorithms.‚Äù The company‚Äôs sales rose 1.6%, while procurement costs increased by 1% ‚Äî another case of protecting margins.</p><p>Target, meanwhile, acknowledged that, ‚Äúas one of the largest importers in the country, the prospect of higher tariffs meant we were facing some major financial and operational hurdles,‚Äù said Cornell, who will step down as CEO next year. The company‚Äôs trajectory is further complicated by ‚Äúmultiple changes in tariff policy that have been announced and implemented as the year has progressed,‚Äù he added.</p><p>For this reason, the supermarket chain has adopted various mitigation strategies, including ‚Äúdiversifying‚Äù production and sourcing countries. ‚ÄúWe have many levers to use in mitigating the impact of tariffs, and price is the very last resort,‚Äù said Target executive vice president, Rick Gomez, last week.</p><p>The company ‚Äî one of the benchmarks in traditional retail ‚Äî has posted declining sales for three consecutive years, a trend that continued into the first half of this year. Sales fell 1.9% in that period, though the decline eased to 0.9% in the second quarter. Its inventory rose 2%, ‚Äúreflecting higher product costs than a year ago, driven by tariffs and other pressures.‚Äù</p><p>Of the four companies analyzed, Target was the only one whose gross margin worsened in the second quarter. It declined by one percentage point, after merchandise costs increased 0.5% while sales fell 0.9%. The company expects to complete its recovery in 2026.</p><p><i>Sign up for </i><a href="https://plus.elpais.com/newsletters/lnp/1/333/?lang=en" rel="" title="https://plus.elpais.com/newsletters/lnp/1/333/?lang=en"><i>our weekly newsletter</i></a><i> to get more English-language news coverage from EL PA√çS USA Edition</i></p></div></div>]]></description>

            <pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 01:02:59 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://scottstuff.net/posts/2025/05/19/ntp-limits/">https://scottstuff.net/posts/2025/05/19/ntp-limits/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45021078">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>Lately I‚Äôve been trying to find (and understand) the limits of time
syncing between Linux systems. How accurate can you get? What does it
take to get that? And what things can easily add measurable amounts of
time error?</p>
<p>After most of a month (!), I‚Äôm starting to understand things. This is
kind of a follow-on to <a href="https://scottstuff.net/posts/2025/04/10/improving-ntp-accuracy/">a
previous post</a>, where I walked through my setup and goals, plus <a href="https://scottstuff.net/posts/2025/05/15/time-syncing-101/">another
post</a> where I discussed time syncing in general. I‚Äôm trying to get
the clocks on a bunch of Linux systems on my network synced as closely
as possible so I can trust the timestamps on <a href="https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/observability-primer/#distributed-traces">distributed
tracing</a> records that occur on different systems. My local network
round-trip times are in the <a href="https://scottstuff.net/posts/2024/12/18/networks-still-awe-me-sometimes/">20‚Äì30
microsecond (ŒºS) range</a> and I‚Äôd like clocks to be less than 1 RTT
apart from each other. Ideally, they‚Äôd be within 1 ŒºS, but 10 ŒºS is
fine.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs easy to fire up <a href="https://chrony-project.org/">Chrony</a>
against a local GPS<span><label for="sn-0"></label><span>Technically, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_navigation">GNSS</a>,
which covers multiple satellite-backed navigation systems, not just the
US GPS system, but I‚Äôm going to keep saying ‚ÄúGPS‚Äù for short.</span></span>-backed time source and see it claim to be within X
nanoseconds of GPS, but it‚Äôs tricky to figure out if Chrony is right or
not. Especially once it‚Äôs claiming to be more accurate than the
network‚Äôs round-trip time<span><label for="sn-1"></label><span>20 ŒºS or so.</span></span>, the amount of time needed for a single CPU cache
miss<span><label for="sn-2"></label><span>50-ish nanoseconds.</span></span>, or even the amount of time that light would take to span
the gap between the server and the time source.<span><label for="sn-3"></label><span>About 5 ns per meter.</span></span></p>
<p>I‚Äôve spent <em>way</em> too much time over the past month digging
into time, and specifically the limits of what you can accomplish with
Linux, Chrony, and GPS. I‚Äôll walk through all of that here eventually,
but let me spoil the conclusion and give some limits:</p>
<ul>
<li>GPSes don‚Äôt return perfect time. I routinely see up to 200 ns
differences between the 3 GPSes on my desk when viewing their output on
an oscilloscope. The time gap between the 3 sources varies every second,
and it‚Äôs rare to see all three within 20 ns of each other. Even the best
GPS timing modules that I‚Äôve seen list ~5 ns of jitter on their
datasheets. I‚Äôd be surprised if you could get 3-5 GPS receivers to agree
within 50 ns or so without careful management of consistent antenna
cable length, etc.</li>
<li>Even small amounts of network complexity can easily add 200-300 ns
of systemic error to your measurements.</li>
<li>Different NICs and their drivers vary widely on how good they are
for sub-microsecond timing. From what I‚Äôve seen, <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/211608/intel-ethernet-network-adapter-e810xxvda4t/specifications.html">Intel
E810 NIC</a>s are <em>great</em>, Intel X710s are very good, Mellanox
ConnectX-5 are okay, Mellanox ConnectX-3 and <a href="https://scottstuff.net/posts/2025/05/07/connectx-4-and-linuxptp/">ConnectX-4</a>
are borderline, and everything from Realtek is questionable.</li>
<li>A lot of Linux systems are <em>terrible</em> at low-latency work.
There are a lot of causes for this, but one of the biggest is random
‚Äústalls‚Äù due to the system‚Äôs <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Management_BIOS">SMBIOS</a>
running to handle power management or other activities, and ‚Äúpausing‚Äù
the observable computer for hundreds of microseconds or longer. In
general, there‚Äôs no good way to know if a given system
(<em>especially</em> cheap systems) will be good or bad for timing
without testing them. I have two cheap mini PC systems that have
inexplicably bad time syncing behavior,<span><label for="sn-4"></label><span>1300-2000 ns.</span></span> and two others with inexplicably <em>good</em> time
syncing<span><label for="sn-5"></label><span>20-50 ns</span></span>. Dedicated server hardware is generally more
consistent.</li>
</ul>
<p>All in all, I‚Äôm able to sync clocks to within 500 ns or so on the
bulk of the systems on my network. That‚Äôs good enough for my purposes,
but it‚Äôs not as good as I‚Äôd expected to see.</p>
<p>Now, it‚Äôs <em>certainly</em> possible to do better than this in
specific cases. For examples, see <a href="https://chrony-project.org/examples.html">Chrony‚Äôs examples
page</a>, where they get &lt;100 ns of error over the network for a
specific test case. <em>In general</em>, though it‚Äôs going to be hard to
do much better than 200 ns consistently across a real network without a
lot of careful engineering.</p>
<p>I‚Äôll explain my conclusions in a bit, but first some background and
context.</p>
<h2 id="my-setup">My Setup</h2>
<p>For the sake of testing time, I‚Äôm using 8 different (but identical)
servers as time clients and 5 different GPS-backed time sources, all
local.</p>

7050QX-32S</a> switches. These are 32-port 40 GbE switches with hardware
support for PTP. They‚Äôre older, but very solid.</p>
<p>Linux systems with multiple network connections (the 8 test servers
and my desktop) are connected to each with a /30 link per interface and
then run <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Shortest_Path_First">OSPF</a>
with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal-cost_multi-path_routing">ECMP</a>
to provide redundancy. Devices with a single network interface
(Raspberry Pis and LeoNTP devices in this example) are connected to
layer 2 switches which are then connected to the core switches via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-chassis_link_aggregation_group">MLAG</a>
links. This means that there are multiple possible paths between any two
devices through the network, as both ECMP and LAG use a mix of source
and destination addresses to decide which link to use. So the path
between <code>d1</code> and <code>ntp1</code> may be almost completely
different from the path between <code>d2</code> and <code>ntp1</code>,
even though <code>d1</code> and <code>d2</code> are sitting less than an
inch from each other and share all of the same physical network links.
Even more entertaining, the path <em>back</em> from <code>ntp1</code> to
<code>d1</code> and <code>d2</code> may or may not be the same as the
forward path. This only matters when nanosecond-level timings are
involved, as we‚Äôll see in a bit.</p>
<h2 id="sources-of-error">Sources of Error</h2>
<p>So ‚Äî finally ‚Äî I have multiple NTP servers, presumably synced to GPS
satellites as accurately as possible, and multiple servers, all synced
to the NTP servers over a relatively low-latency network. How accurately
are my servers syncing to GPS time? And where is that going wrong?</p>
<h3 id="chronys-claims">Chrony‚Äôs claims</h3>
<p>So, if you‚Äôre trying to see how accurate Chrony‚Äôs time syncing is,
the easiest place to start is with Chrony‚Äôs own metrics. In this case,
Chrony claims that it‚Äôs had a median offset of 25‚Äì110 ns over the past
day:</p>

<p>Chrony‚Äôs median offset over the past day.</p>

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Now, this isn‚Äôt the best metric for a number of reasons, but it‚Äôs a
start. It says that Chrony thinks that it‚Äôs synced to within 110 ns of
<em>something</em>, but it doesn‚Äôt really tell us anything about what
it‚Äôs synced to or how accurate it actually is. So, let‚Äôs dig in a bit
deeper.</p>
<h3 id="gps-error-and-drift">GPS error and drift</h3>
<p>First, the GPS receivers in my NTP time servers aren‚Äôt perfectly
accurate. Even top-tier GPS receivers will still have ~5 ns of timing
noise, and lower-tier ones will be 20‚Äì60 ns (or possibly higher).<span><label for="sn-8"></label><span>Datasheet links: the <a href="https://content.u-blox.com/sites/default/files/ZED-F9T-10B_DataSheet_UBX-20033635.pdf">ublox
ZED-F9T</a> in my desktop claims 5 ns of accuracy and 4 ns of jitter.
The <a href="https://content.u-blox.com/sites/default/files/documents/NEO-LEA-M8T-FW3_DataSheet_UBX-15025193.pdf">ublox
NEO-M8T</a> in NTP5 (not graphed here) claims 20-500ns of accuracy,
depending on the antenna. And <a href="https://www.leontp.com/firmware/LeoNTP-InstructionManual-Latest.pdf">LeoNTP</a>
claims 30ns of RMS accuracy and 60ns of 99-th percentile accuracy.</span></span></p>
<p>Fortunately, this is relatively easy to measure, at least when the
devices are within a few feet of each other. You can connect an
oscilloscope to their PPS outputs and directly view the differences
between them. Here‚Äôs the result for <code>ntp2</code>,
<code>ntp4</code>, and my desktop:</p>
<figure>
<a href="https://scottstuff.net/posts/2025/05/19/ntp-limits/scope.gif">

<p>Oscilloscope output. The Raspberry Pi/<a href="https://store.timebeat.app/products/open-timecard-mini-essential">Timebeat
Timecard Mini Essential</a> is on top in yellow, then the LeoNTP in
purple, and an Intel E810 on the bottom in blue. Animated; each update
covers 1 second of real time.</p>
</small>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Notice that (a) they don‚Äôt all agree and (b) they move around
relative to each other. In this sample, there‚Äôs about a 200ns difference
between NTP4 (top, yellow) and my desktop (bottom, blue). Some of this
is due to cable length differences (my antenna and PPS leads aren‚Äôt all
identical-length, so there‚Äôs probably ~20ns in difference there alone),
but that doesn‚Äôt explain all of it.</p>
<p>Even ignoring the NTP4, there‚Äôs ~25ns in variance between
<code>ntp2</code> (purple, middle) and my desktop (blue, bottom). Notice
that they move relative to each other over time in a bit of a
pattern.</p>
<p>In general, offsets can <em>mostly</em> be compensated for, either in
Chrony or directly on the GPS device, but jitter is trickier.</p>
<p>Depending on how you look at things, I‚Äôm seeing a <em>minimum</em> of
25 ns of error at this level, and potentially up to 200ns.</p>
<p>When you give Chrony multiple time sources that are all equivalently
good, then it‚Äôll generally average its time across the whole set of
sources. So adding one time source with 200 ns of offset to 2 other
mostly-identical time sources should only add ~67 ns of error at most,
and possibly no error at all, if Chrony decides that the 200 ns source
is too far off to be used.</p>
<h3 id="network-error">Network error</h3>
<p>Chrony tries to compensate for network delays when it syncs to NTP
sources over the network, but it has to make some assumptions that
aren‚Äôt always true. It assumes that network delays are symmetrical (that
is, if it takes 30 ŒºS for network traffic to get from the client to the
server and back, then it takes 15 ŒºS each way). This isn‚Äôt generally
true, but for a lot of networks it‚Äôs close enough.</p>
<p>Apparently it‚Äôs not particularly true for my network.</p>
<p>One of the things that I‚Äôm monitoring with Chrony and Prometheus is
the current offset for each time source on each Chrony client. I have
data for my 8 test servers (<code>d1</code> through <code>d8</code>)
tracking the relative offsets for <code>ntp1</code> and
<code>ntp2</code>. I was expecting to see that either <code>ntp1</code>
or <code>ntp2</code> was consistently ahead of the other one, given
cable lengths, network delays, antenna differences, and so forth.</p>
<p>Instead, half of the servers see <code>ntp1</code> as running faster,
while half show <code>ntp2</code> as running faster:</p>

<p>The servers can‚Äôt agree on whether <code>ntp1</code> runs faster than
<code>ntp2</code> or not ‚Äî 4 of the 8 see <code>ntp1</code> as faster,
while 4 see <code>ntp2</code> as faster, with the servers in two bands
around +100ns and -300ns. This has been consistent for weeks.<span><label for="sn-9"></label><span>To be clear, since half of the <code>d*</code> servers
are in one enclosure and half are in another: the timing differences are
basically random, and don‚Äôt follow which chassis they‚Äôre in or which
network cables they use. Of the 4 physical servers in each enclosure, 2
think <code>ntp1</code> is faster and 2 think <code>ntp2</code> is
faster, but <em>which</em> two aren‚Äôt even consistent between
enclosures.</span></span></p>
<p>Presumably this is caused by asymmetric traffic paths in my network.
If you look back to the network diagram above, you‚Äôll see that the test
servers each have a link to each core switch, and that the L2 switches
that the NTP servers use are each connected to both core switches. Any
time you have redundant links like this, <em>something</em> has to
decide which path any given packet is going to take over the network. In
general network people <em>really</em> dislike just picking paths at
random, largely because that‚Äôd mean that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out-of-order_delivery">packets could
arrive out of order</a>, and a lot of TCP stacks hate out-of-order
traffic. So, generally, traffic is assigned to a path using a hash of
source and destination addresses.<span><label for="sn-10"></label><span>The exact implementation varies widely and is
frequently configurable on higher-end devices. For L2 links most devices
just hash the source and destination MACs, while for L3 links the hash
<em>usually</em> includes the source and destination IPs and may include
the TCP/UDP port numbers or other easy-to-locate data.</span></span></p>
<p>Presumably one of the possible paths between servers and time sources
on the network is faster than the others, and paths that hash onto the
faster path consistently skew the results in one direction or the other.
A less complex (and less redundant!) network would have less of this
sort of error, but asymmetric round trip times show up
<em>everywhere</em> in networking when you‚Äôre counting nanoseconds. At
some level, this isn‚Äôt avoidable.</p>
<p>So, on my network, this seems to cause a minimum of 200ns of
potential error, as various paths take different amounts of time, and
Chrony isn‚Äôt able to compensate automatically.<span><label for="sn-11"></label><span>Chrony has a per-source setting for adjusting latency
asymmetry, so I could probably hand-adjust all 16 (<code>d*</code> -&gt;
<code>ntp*</code>) config lines to minimize the error if I
<em>really</em> cared about ~200 ns of error, but it‚Äôs unlikely that
it‚Äôd buy me much useful accuracy.</span></span></p>
<h3 id="cross-server-synchronization">Cross-server synchronization</h3>
<p>As an experiment, I told all 8 of my test servers to use each other
as time sources. I added them using Chrony‚Äôs <code>noselect</code> flag,
so they wouldn‚Äôt try to use each other as authoritative; they‚Äôd just
monitor the relative offsets between servers and record them over
time.<span><label for="sn-12"></label><span>I‚Äôm actually measuring time <em>really</em>
aggressively between <code>d*</code> servers. I‚Äôm polling every 250 ms
and averaging across 5 samples to try to minimize noise. Flags from
<code>chrony.conf</code>:
<code>server xxx noselect xleave presend 9 minpoll -2 maxpoll -2 filter 5 extfield F323</code></span></span></p>
<p>Here‚Äôs the median<span><label for="sn-13"></label><span>Note that the median isn‚Äôt really the best way to look
for offsets <em>in general</em>, but since Chrony maintains its own view
of time and slowly adjusts it time relative to its sources, so a few
wildly inaccurate responses won‚Äôt really change Chrony‚Äôs time much, if
at all.</span></span> offset between servers, in nanoseconds, over 4 hours:</p>

<p>Notice that they‚Äôre all within 207ns of each other, but the timings
aren‚Äôt particularly consistent. For instance, looking at the timings
between <code>d2</code> and <code>d3</code> show that they‚Äôre 29 ns
apart when you query one direction and 23 ns apart when you query in the
other direction, but they‚Äôre both off in the <em>same</em> direction. If
network error wasn‚Äôt a factor, then I‚Äôd expect to see one number be
positive and the other be negative; that‚Äôs not always the case here.</p>
<p>In general, this aligns nicely with the 200-300ns of error seen in
the previous section, but it shows that there‚Äôs a serious limit to how
accurately Chrony can measure nanoseconds on this hardware.</p>
<h3 id="observed-offsets-across-all-sources">Observed offsets across all
sources</h3>
<p>Earlier, I discussed the difference between <code>ntp1</code> and
<code>ntp2</code>, and how each server had a different view of the
difference between them. On average, <code>ntp1</code> seems to run
50‚Äì150 ns ahead of <code>ntp2</code>.</p>
<p>Remember that my big goal here is less <em>accurate</em> time and
more <em>consistent</em> time. This 50‚Äì150 ns of inconsistency isn‚Äôt a
big deal, but when I started adding additional time sources, I
discovered that some of them were even further away from
<code>ntp1</code> and <code>ntp2</code>, and I wanted to minimize the
total time spread. I‚Äôd really like it if adding additional NTP sources
to the mix didn‚Äôt make things even less consistent.</p>
<p>There are a lot of things to like about the LeoNTP time servers, but
configurability <em>isn‚Äôt</em> one of them. There‚Äôs no way that I can
see to add an offset between GPS time and the NTP time that they export.
On the other hand, the 3 Chrony-based time servers (my desktop,
<code>ntp4</code>, and <code>ntp5</code>) <em>can</em> be adjusted to
control the offset between GPS time and NTP time. And, in fact, you
<em>can‚Äôt</em> really run with a 0-second offset because GPS time is
based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Atomic_Time">TAI</a>
and NTP time is usually <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time">UTC</a>,<span><label for="sn-14"></label><span>Strictly speaking, it‚Äôs usually a weird mutant that
<em>mostly</em> ignores leap seconds, look up ‚Äú<a href="https://developers.google.com/time/smear">leap smear</a>‚Äù for the
ugly mess.</span></span> and the two are currently 37 seconds apart.<span><label for="sn-15"></label><span>Leap seconds make life hard.</span></span></p>
<p>Originally, I discovered that time from my desktop was around 1 ŒºS
when compared with <code>ntp1</code> and <code>ntp2</code> by
<code>d*</code> servers, and time from the Raspberry Pi-based
<code>ntp4</code> was almost 38 ŒºS off! To mitigate this, I graphed the
average offset between each time source across all 8 servers and then
adjusted offsets on my desktop and <code>ntp4</code> to be as close as
possible to the median of <code>ntp1</code> and <code>ntp2</code>. To do
this, I changed my desktop‚Äôs TAI offset from <code>-37</code> to
<code>-36.999999160</code> and the offset of <code>ntp4</code> to
<code>-37.000033910</code>.</p>
<p>Now, all 4 sources are basically in unison:</p>

<p>Why were times so far off? For my desktop, it‚Äôs probably a mix of
multipath weirdness and delay in the network stack. 840 ns isn‚Äôt a huge
amount of time, although it‚Äôs bigger than what I‚Äôve seen elsewhere.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm less sure what‚Äôs going on with <code>ntp4</code>. It was
originally seeing over 50 ŒºS of error, but reducing the Ethernet
coalescing limits on <code>eth0</code><span><label for="sn-16"></label><span><code>ethtool -C eth0 tx-usecs 0 rx-usecs 0</code></span></span> helped quite a bit. I‚Äôm going to have to keep poking at

<p>I can compare the jitter of 4 of my GPS time sources across all 8

at the difference between the 1st and 99th percentile of each source‚Äôs
offset from Chrony‚Äôs best estimate of the current time. I‚Äôm calculating
the percentiles over 15 minute windows, subtracting the 1st percentile

<p>So, my desktop (with a fast NIC and a very good GNSS module) has the
least jitter. The two LeoNTP boxes are next, with a bit more, and the
Raspberry Pi has 2x the jitter of my desktop. Since Chrony averages out
offsets across sources and over time, jitter isn‚Äôt <em>necessarily</em>
a big deal as long as it‚Äôs under control.</p>
<p>Which brings up <code>ntp5</code>, which I‚Äôd excluded from the
previous graph. Here‚Äôs why:</p>
<figure>
<a href="https://scottstuff.net/posts/2025/05/19/ntp-limits/jitter2.png">

</figure>
<p>I still haven‚Äôt figured out why this loses accuracy every 2 hours,
but there are other weird things about <code>ntp5</code>, so I‚Äôm not all
that worried about it overall.</p>
<h2 id="things-that-hurt-syncing">Things that hurt syncing</h2>
<p>Along the way, I‚Äôve found a bunch of things that hurt time syncing. A
short list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Network cards without hardware timestamps. Realtek, for
instance.</li>
<li>Tunnels. I had 3 servers who were sending traffic to the network
with <code>ntp1</code> and <code>ntp2</code> over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Extensible_LAN">VxLAN</a>
originally, and their time accuracy was terrible. I suspect that the
NICs‚Äô hardware timestamp wasn‚Äôt propagated correctly through the tunnel
decapsulation. Plus, it made network times even less symmetrical.</li>
<li>NIC packet coelescing. On Raspberry Pi CM5s especially, I had to
disable NIC coelescing via <code>ethtool -c</code> or I had terrible
accuracy.</li>
<li>Software in general. I get the best results on NTP servers where the
GPS‚Äôs PPS signal goes directly into the NIC‚Äôs hardware, completely
bypassing as much software as possible.</li>
<li>Running <code>ptp4l</code> and <code>Chrony</code> on the same
ConnectX-4 NIC, or potentially ConnectX-3 or -5 NICs. Intel seems
perfectly happy under the same situation.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>So, in all, I‚Äôm seeing time syncing somewhere in the 200‚Äì500 ns range
across my network. The GPS time sources themselves are sometimes as far
as 150 ns apart, even after compensating for systemic differences, and
the network itself adds another 200‚Äì300 ns of noise.</p>
<p>In an ideal world, it‚Äôd be cool to see ~10 ns accuracy, but it‚Äôs not
really possible at any level with this hardware. My time sources aren‚Äôt
that good, my network adds more systemic error than that, and when I try
to measure the difference between test servers I see a couple hundred
nanoseconds of noise. So 10 ns isn‚Äôt going to happen.</p>
<p>On the other hand, though, I‚Äôm almost certainly accurate to within 1
ŒºS across the set of 8 test servers most of the time, and I‚Äôm
<em>absolutely</em> more accurate than my original goal of 10 ŒºS.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>MacOS has shipped with a collection of ‚Äúutility‚Äù apps since the prehistoric era of classic Mac OS. A good rule of thumb what makes an app a ‚Äúutility‚Äù is that it‚Äôs a tool for doing something <em>about</em> your computer. Ever since Mac OS X 10.0, most of these apps have been neatly filed away in <em>/Applications/Utilities/</em>. Others‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâsome because they‚Äôre obscure (e.g. Ticket Viewer), some because they‚Äôre effectively deprecated (e.g. DVD Player, whose copyright date in MacOS 15 Sequoia is 2019), and some because they present themselves, when launched, not as apps but as system-level features (e.g. About This Mac)‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâare tucked away in <em>/System/Library/CoreServices/</em> or <em>/System/Library/CoreServices/Applications/</em>.</p>

<p><a href="https://mastodon.social/@BasicAppleGuy/115089810537348465">Basic Apple Guy posted a screenshot to Mastodon</a> comparing the current MacOS 15 icons for four of these utilities (Disk Utility, Expansion Slot Utility, Wireless Diagnostics, and AppleScript Utility) to their new icons in MacOS 26 Tahoe, beta 7 (click to enlarge for detail):</p>

  <img src="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/08/tahoe-utility-icons-via-basic-apple-guy.jpeg" alt="Screenshots of the MacOS 15 and MacOS 26 (beta 7) icons for Disk Utility, Expansion Slot Utility, Wireless Diagnostics, and AppleScript Utility." width="500"></a></p>

<p>I don‚Äôt think the old icons for these apps from MacOS 15 were particularly good‚Äâ‚Äî‚ÄâApple has mostly lost its ‚Äúicons look cool‚Äù game. But the new ones in MacOS 26 Tahoe are objectively terrible. The only one of this bunch that‚Äôs maybe sort of OK is Wireless Diagnostics. They all look like placeholder icons made by a developer who would be the first to admit that they‚Äôre not an artist. Disk Utility, which is an important app, doesn‚Äôt even look like it involves a disk. That icon just says ‚ÄúFix something Apple related.‚Äù On an Apple computer, that could mean anything.</p>

<p>These new icons all use the same ‚Äúwrench‚Äù motif, which is a lazy, limiting concept to start with. Tahoe, at the system level, enforces a squircle shape on all application icons. Apps that haven‚Äôt been updated with Tahoe-compliant everything-fits-in-a-squircle icons are put in ‚Äú<a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/08/08/macos-tahoe-fix-gray-box-icons/">squircle jail</a>‚Äù‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâtheir non-Tahoe-compliant icons are shrunk and placed atop a drab gray Tahoe squircle background, to force them into squircle compliance. But these Apple utility apps have an entire sub-motif‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâinside their base squircle shape is a large wrench fitted against a bolt. Only inside the bolt‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâwhich is inside the wrench‚Äôs forks, which wrench is inside the squircle‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâgoes the part of the icon that identifies app itself. So maybe like 10 percent of the area of the icon is the area where the app can show something that identifies its purpose.</p>

<p>So the entire concept for these icons sucks. But the conceptual execution sucks too. The wrench is incredibly stupid-looking. Whoever drew it has obviously never used a crescent wrench because the forks on the wrench head are <em>way</em> too thin. They‚Äôd break off under any significant torque. Just look at a photo of real-life wrench, or‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâjust look at the wrenches in the older MacOS icons.</p>

<p>Individually the icons mostly suck too:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Disk Utility‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâa very important app‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâhas an icon that‚Äôs just an Apple logo (inside the bolt that‚Äôs inside the wrench that‚Äôs inside the squircle). Not a hard drive, not an external drive, not an SD card. Just an Apple logo. If I just showed you this icon without telling you which app it represented, how in the world would you guess what it is? Even if you know the ‚ÄúApple utility app icon‚Äù motif of the big dumb wrench and bolt, the best you could guess is ‚Äúa utility app for something Apple-related‚Äù which, for an Apple computer, could be anything.</p></li>
<li><p>Expansion Slot Utility‚Äâ‚Äî‚ÄâThis app only runs on Mac Pros because Mac Pros are the only Macs with expansion slots. So the old icon naturally shows a Mac Pro. The new icon shows ... three rectangular empty sockets?</p></li>
<li><p>AppleScript Utility‚Äâ‚Äî‚ÄâA fine concept for this icon (within the confines of the terrible wrench-and-bolt utility icon concept). Everyone who knows AppleScript knows the scroll that represents AppleScript scripts. So just put the iconic AppleScript scroll in the bolt in the wrench in the squircle. But here, the placement of the scroll is botched‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâit‚Äôs rotated a few degrees counterclockwise. It makes the scroll look like it‚Äôs falling over. Here‚Äôs how the scroll is canonically oriented, via the glyphs in SF Symbols:</p>

<p><img src="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/08/applescript-icons-sf-symbols.png" alt="The ‚Äúapplescript‚Äù and ‚Äúapplescript.fill‚Äù icon glyphs from the SF Symbols font."></p>

<p>and via the default icon for a script application (with a line added showing the center):</p>

<p><img src="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/08/macos-15-script-application-icon.png" alt="The default application for an AppleScript ‚Äúscript application‚Äù, with a vertical orange line showing the center." width="440"></p>

<p>But here‚Äôs a close-up of the Tahoe AppleScript Utility icon, with a center line added:</p>

<p><img src="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/08/tahoe-applescript-utility-icon-drunk.png" alt="Close-up of the MacOS 26 Tahoe icon for AppleScript Utility, with a center line added to show that the script ‚Äúscroll‚Äù is tilted incorrectly."></p>

<p>It‚Äôs wrong. From Apple, of all companies.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>These are the not the work of carpenters <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/445621-when-you-re-a-carpenter-making-a-beautiful-chest-of-drawers">who care about the backs of the cabinets</a> they‚Äôre building. These icons are so bad, they look like the work of untrained ‚ÄúHow hard can it be?‚Äù dilettante carpenters who only last a few days on the job before sawing off one of their own fingers. The whole collection looks like the work from someone with no artistic ability <em>nor</em> an eye for detail. From <em>Apple</em>, of all companies.</p>

<p>Is it a big deal in the grand scheme of things that the icons for these seldom-used utility apps have gone to shit? No. But consider the proverbial canary in a coal mine. The problem isn‚Äôt that one little bird has died. The problem is that the bird might be dead because the whole mine is filling with deadly carbon monoxide or highly flammable methane gas. The icons in <em>/Applications/Utilities/</em> in MacOS 26 Tahoe represent a folder full of dead canaries. </p>

<p dir="auto">For robust WiFi sensing, we recommend using a USB adapter based on the <strong>Realtek RTL8812AU</strong> chipset. This adapter supports both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands, monitor mode, and packet injection. It is widely used for WiFi security research and is compatible with Linux distributions such as Ubuntu, Kali, and Parrot.</p>

<p dir="auto">
  I built <strong>WiFi-3D-Fusion</strong> because I couldn‚Äôt stand the silence.<br>
  The world is full of invisible signals, oceans of information passing through us every second yet most people never even notice. Researchers publish papers, companies whisper promises, but almost nobody shows the truth.
</p>
<p dir="auto">
  I wanted to tear the veil.
</p>
<p dir="auto">
  This project is not just software. It‚Äôs proof that what we call ‚Äúair‚Äù is alive with data that the invisible can be sculpted into form, movement, presence.<br>
  It‚Äôs not about spying. It‚Äôs not about control.<br>
  It‚Äôs about showing that technology can reveal without violating, sense without watching, protect without chains.
</p>
<p dir="auto">
  Why? Because there are places where cameras fail, dark rooms, burning buildings, collapsed tunnels, deep underground. And in those places, a system like this could mean the difference between life and death.
</p>
<p dir="auto">
  I experiment because I refuse to accept ‚Äúimpossible.‚Äù<br>
  I build because the world needs to see what it denies exists.<br>
  WiFi-3D-Fusion is not a product, it‚Äôs a signal flare in the dark.

<div><p>Battery efficiency comes from a million little optimizations in the technology stack, most of which comes down to using the CPU as little as possible. As such the instruction set architecture and process node aren't usually that important when it comes to your battery life.</p><p>If you fully load the CPU and calculate how much energy a AI340 needs to perform a fixed workload and compare that to a M1 you'll probably find similar results, but that only matters for your battery life if you're doing things like blender renders, big compiles or gaming.</p><p>Take for example this battery life gaming benchmark for an M1 Air: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYSMfRKsmOU" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYSMfRKsmOU</a>. 2.5 hours is about what you'd expect from an x86 laptop, possibly even worse than the fw13 you're comparing here. But turn down the settings so that the M1 CPU and GPU are mostly idle, and bam you get 10+ hours.</p><p>Another example would be a ~5 year old mobile qualcomm chip. It's a worse process node than an AMD AI340, much much slower and significantly worse performance per watt, and yet it barely gets hot and sips power.</p><p>All that to say: M1 is pretty fast, but the reason the battery life is better has to do with everything other than the CPU cores. That's what AMD and Intel are missing.</p><p>&gt; If I open too many tabs in Chrome I can feel the bottom of the laptop getting hot, open a YouTube video and the fans will often spin up.</p><p>It's a fairly common issue on Linux to be missing hardware acceleration, especially for video decoding. I've had to enable gpu video decoding on my fw16 and haven't noticed the fans on youtube.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="45023243"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="1"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td><center><a id="up_45023243" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=45023243&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D45019483"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div><p>Macbooks are more like "phone/tablet hardware evolved into desktop" mindset (low power, high performance). x86 hardware is the other way around (high power, we'll see about performance).</p><p>That being said, my M2 beats the ... out of my twice as expensive work laptop when compiling an arduino project.

Recently released handheld Lenovo Go S has both SteamOS (which is Arch btw) and Windows11 versions, allowing to directly compare efficiency of a AMD's Z1E chip under load with limited TDP.

<div><p>They're big, expensive chips with a focus on power efficiency. AMD and Intel's chips that are on the big and expensive side tend toward being optimized for higher power ranges, so they don't compete well on efficiency, while their more power efficient chips tend toward being optimized for size/cost.</p><p>If you're willing to spend a bunch of die area (which directly translates into cost) you can get good numbers on the other two legs of the Power-Performance-Area triangle. The issue is that the market position of Apple's competitors is such that it doesn't make as much sense for them to make such big and expensive chips (particularly CPU cores) in a mobile-friendly power envelope.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="45022981"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="1"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td><center><a id="up_45022981" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=45022981&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D45019483"></a></center></td><td><br>
<div><p>Per core, Apple‚Äôs Performance cores are no bigger than AMD‚Äôs Zen cores. So it‚Äôs a myth that they‚Äôre only fast and efficient because they are big.</p><p>What makes Apple silicon chips big is they bolt on a fast GPU on it. If you include the die of a discrete GPU with an x86 chip, it‚Äôd be the same or bigger than M series.</p><p>You can look at Intel‚Äôs Lunar Lake as an example where it‚Äôs physically bigger than an M4 but slower in CPU, GPU, NPU and has way worse efficiency.</p><p>Another comparison is AMD Strix Halo. Despite being ~1.5x bigger than the M4 Pro, it has worse efficiency, ST performance, and GPU performance.

<div><p>A lot of insightful comments already, but there are two other tricks I think Apple is using: (1) the laptops can get really hot before the fans turn on audibly and (2) the fans are engineered to be super quiet. So even if they run on low RPM, you won't hear them. This makes the M-series seem even more efficient than they are.</p><p>Also, especially the MacBook Pros have really large batteries, on average larger than the competition.

<div><p>I tend to think its putting the memory on the package. Putting the memory on the package has given the M1 over 400GB/s which is a good 4x that on a usual dual channel x64 CPU and the latency is half that of going out to a DRAM slot. That is drastic and I remember when the northbrige was first folded into the CPU by AMD with the Athlon and it had a similarly big improvements in performance. It also reduces power consumption a lot.</p><p>The cost is flexibility and I think for now they don't want to move to fixed RAM configurations. The X3D approach from AMD gets a good bunch of the benefits by just putting lots of cache on board.</p><p>Apple got a lot of performance out of not a lot of watts.</p><p>One other possibility on power saving is the way Apple ramps the clockspeed. Its quite slow to increase from its 1Ghz idle to 3.2Ghz, about 100ms and it doesn't even start for 40ms. With tiny little bursts of activity like web browsing and such this slow transition likely saves a lot of power at a cost of absolute responsiveness.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="45022834"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="1"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td><center><a id="up_45022834" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=45022834&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D45019483"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div><p>I recently upgraded from an M1 mac book pro 15", which I was pretty happy with, to the M4 max pro 16". I've been extremely impressed with the new laptop. The key metric I use to judge performance is build speed for our main project. It's a thing I do a few dozen times per day. The M1 took about four minutes to run our integration tests. I should add that those tests run in parallel and make heavy use of docker. There are close to 300 integration tests and a few unit tests. Each of those hit the database, Redis, and Elasticsearch. The M4 Pro dropped that to 40 seconds. Each individual test might take a few seconds. It seems to be benefiting a lot from both the faster CPU with lots of cores and the increased amount of memory and memory bandwidth. Whatever it is, I'm seriously impressed with this machine. It costs a lot new but on a three year lease, it boils down to about 100 euros per month. Totally worth it for me. And I'm kind of kicking myself for not upgrading earlier.</p><p>Before the M1, I was stuck using an intel core i5 running arch linux. My intel mac managed to die months before the M1 came out. Let's just say that the M1 really made me appreciate how stupidly slow that intel hardware is. I was losing lots of time doing builds. The laptop would be unusable during those builds.</p><p>Life is too short for crappy hardware. From a software point of view, I could live with Linux but not with Windows. But the hardware is a show stopper currently. I need something that runs cool and yet does not compromise on performance. And all the rest (non-crappy trackpad, amazingly good screen, cool to the touch, good battery life, etc.). And manages to look good too. I'm not aware of any windows/linux laptop that does not heavily compromise on at least a few of those things. I'm pretty sure I can get a fast laptop. But it'd be hot and loud and have the unusable synaptics trackpad. And a mediocre screen. Etc. In short, I'd be missing my mac.</p><p>Apple is showing some confidence by just designing a laptop that isn't even close to being cheap. This thing was well over 4K euros. Worth every penny.

Had the exact same experience with a well-reviewed Acer laptop a while back, ended up getting rid of it a few months in because of constant annoyances, replaced with a MacBook Air that lasted for many years. A few years back, I got one of the popular Asus NUCs that came without networking drivers installed.

The same SKU came with a variety of networking hardware from different manufacturers, without any indication of which combination I had, so trial and error it was.

<div><p>ARM instructions are fixed size, while x86 are variable.

This also saves power - even on ARM, decoders take power.</p><p>People have been trying to figure out the "secret sauce" since the M chips have been introduced. In my opinion, it's a combination of:</p><p>1) The apple engineers did a superb job creating a well balanced architecture</p><p>2) Being close to their memory subsystem with lots of bandwidth and deep buffers so they can use it is great. For example, my old M2 Pro macbook has more than twice the memory bandwidth than the current best desktop CPU, the zen5 9950x.

<div><p>In my opinion AMD is on a good way having at least comparable performance to MacBooks copying Apples architectural decisions. Unfortunately their jump on the latest AI Hype Train did not suit them well for efficiency. Ryzen 7840U was significantly more efficient than Ryzen AI 7 350 [1]</p><p>However, with AMD Strix Halo aka AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 395 (PRO) there are Notebooks like the ZBook Ultra G1a and Tablets like the Asus ROG Flow Z13, that come close to the MacBook power / performance ratio[2] due to the fact, that they used high bandwidth soldered on memory, which allows for GPUs with shared VRAM similar to Apple's strategy.</p><p>Framework did not manage to put this thing in notebook yet, but shipped a Desktop variant. They also pointed out, that there was no way to use LPCAMM2 or any other modular RAM tech with that machine, because it would have slowed it down / increased latencies to an unusable state.</p><p>So I'm pretty sure the main reason for Apple's success is the deeply integrated architecture and I'm hopeful that AMD's next generation STRIX Halo APUs might provide this with higher efficiency and hopefully Framework adapts these chips in their notebooks. Maybe they just did in the 16?! Let's wait for this announcement: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZRG7Og61mw" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZRG7Og61mw</a></p><p>Regarding the deeply thought through integration there is a story I often tell: 
Apple used to make iPods. These had support for audio playback control with their headphone remotes (e.g. EarPods), which are still available today. These had a proprietary ultra sonic chirp protocol[3] to identify Apple devices and supported volume control and complex playback control actions. You could even navigate through menus via voiceover with longpress and then using the volume buttons to navigate. Until today with their USB-C-to-AudioJack Adapters these still work on nearly every apple device published after 2013 and the wireless earbuds also support parts of this. Android has tried to copy this tiny little engineering wonder, but until today they did not manage to get it working[4]. They instead focus on their proprietary "longpress" should work in our favour and start "hey google" thing, which is ridiculously hard to intercept / override in officially published Android apps... what a shame ;)</p><p>1: <a href="https://youtu.be/51W0eq7-xrY?t=773" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/51W0eq7-xrY?t=773</a></p><p>2: <a href="https://youtu.be/oyrAur5yYrA" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/oyrAur5yYrA</a></p><p>3: <a href="https://tinymicros.com/wiki/Apple_iPod_Remote_Protocol" rel="nofollow">https://tinymicros.com/wiki/Apple_iPod_Remote_Protocol</a></p><p>4: <a href="https://github.com/androidx/media/issues/2637" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/androidx/media/issues/2637</a></p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="45023014"><td></td></tr><tr id="45019517"><td></td></tr><tr id="45020077"><td></td></tr><tr id="45020915"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_45020915" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=45020915&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D45019483"></a></center></td><td><br>
<div><p>M1‚Äôs efficiency/thermals performance comes from having hardware-accelerated core system libraries.</p><p>Imagine that you made an FPGA do x86 work, and then you wanted to optimize libopenssl, or libgl, or libc. Would you restrict yourself to only modifying the source code of the libraries but not the FPGA, or would you modify the processor to take advantage of new capabilities?</p><p>For made-up example, when the iPhone 27 comes out, it won‚Äôt support <i>booting</i> on iOS 26 or earlier, because the drivers necessary to light it up aren‚Äôt yet published; and, similarly, it can have 3% less battery weight because they optimized the display controller to DMA more efficiently through changes to its M6 processor and the XNU/Darwin 26 DisplayController dylib.</p><p>Neither Linux, Windows, nor Intel have shown any capability to plan and execute such a strategy outside of video codecs and network I/O cards. GPU hardware acceleration is tightly controlled and defended by AMD and Nvidia who want nothing to do with any shared strategy, and neither Microsoft nor Linux generally have shown any interest whatsoever in hardware-accelerating the core system to date ‚Äî though one could theorize that the Xbox is exempt from that, especially given the Proton chip.</p><p>I imagine Valve will eventually do this, most likely working with AMD to get custom silicon that implements custom hardware accelerations inside the Linux kernel that are both open source for anyone to use, and utterly useless since their correct operation hinges on custom silicon. I <i>suspect</i> Microsoft, Nintendo, and Sony already do this with their gaming consoles, but I can‚Äôt offer any certainty on this paragraph of speculation.</p><p>x86 isn‚Äôt able to keep up because x86 isn‚Äôt updated annually across software and hardware alike. M1 is what x86 could have been if it was versioned and updated <i>without</i> backwards compatibility as often as Arm was. it would be like saying ‚ÄúIntel‚Äôs 2026 processors all ship with AVX-1024 and hardware-accelerated DMA, and the OS kernel (and apps that want the full performance gains) must be compiled for its new ABI to boot on it‚Äù. The wreckage across the x86 ecosystem would be immense, and Microsoft would boycott them outright to try and protect itself from having to work harder to keep up ‚Äî just like Adobe did with Apple M1, at least until their userbase starting canceling subscriptions en masse.</p><p>That‚Äôs why there are so many Arm Linux architectures: for Arm, this is just a fact of everyday life, and that‚Äôs what gave the M1 such a leg up in x86: not having to support anything <i>older</i> than your release date means you can focus on the sort of boring incremental optimizations that wouldn‚Äôt be permissible in a ‚Äúmust run assembly code written twenty years ago‚Äù environment assumed by Lin/Win today.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="45021889"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="1"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td><center><a id="up_45021889" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=45021889&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D45019483"></a></center></td><td><br>

Systemically excluded from access to capital and distribution, Black folks leverage creativity to make social media platforms their ‚Äúown‚Äù without ever having true ownership. </span><strong>Decentralization, through technology like the AT Protocol, offers a new path forward.</strong></p><p><span>Consider a non-technological example of decentralized, interoperable standards (where two or more differently designed systems can work together): the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hex_key" rel="">Allen wrench</a><span>. Probably every piece of furniture I‚Äôve put together comes with and is compatible with one. Manufacturers and customers all benefit from being aligned on using the same standard tool ‚Äî not squares, not triangles, but hexagons. We live in a social media environment where every company ships a product with the equivalent of their own distinct key shape and we just accept it.</span></p><p><a href="https://docs.bsky.app/docs/advanced-guides/atproto" rel="">AT Protocol</a><span> could be that kind of standard for social media. The technology, developed by Bluesky, makes new kinds of global, self-governed communities possible that weren‚Äôt before. One of the best examples of the power of this technology is Blacksky, which began as a custom feed and has always been a collective effort between myself, close collaborators, and the broader Black userbase. It began as an experiment in designing an algorithm that centered Black voices, prioritizing community safety and self-governance. </span><strong>We‚Äôve since scaled from 0 to two million users with $0 spent out of pocket and 100% organic growth. </strong><span>Decentralization has made that possible.</span></p><p>Most of the billions of people using social media today interact with closed source, proprietary, centralized social media applications. Users exchange autonomy and ownership over their digital selves in exchange for a ‚Äúfree‚Äù service that offers convenience and participation in large network effects or interesting social innovations.</p><p><span>Projects built on the AT Protocol aspire to be different. Mike Masnick‚Äôs foundational essay </span><a href="https://knightcolumbia.org/content/protocols-not-platforms-a-technological-approach-to-free-speech" rel="">‚ÄúProtocols, Not Platforms‚Äù</a><span> is still the best writing on this topic and is what inspired the creation of AT Protocol.

The feeds also have built-in moderation against toxic content, including anti-Black harassment and misogynoir. But </span><strong>Blacksky Algorithms‚Äô work also functions as memory work ‚Äî preserving the shared narratives and collective decision-making of the largest Black community on the decentralized web</strong><span>.</span></p><p>We‚Äôre also offering these tools to other autonomous communities. While there are many interpretations of the word ‚Äúcommunity,‚Äù we specifically refer to mutual accountability and/or dependency between the one and the many.</p><p>Behind the scenes, our infrastructure and operations team work hand-in-hand to provide our users with a sense of safety and give them confidence that we can continue running, independent of Bluesky. We have a ten-person volunteer moderation team recruited directly from our community. All of them have done community moderation on other platforms previously. For us, experience in this is important, as moderation can be traumatizing work and lead to burnout.</p><p><span>Unlike platform moderation, which is often largely legal and reputational protection for corporations, and is responsible for things like </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_pornography" rel="">CSAM</a><span> and illegal content takedowns, </span><strong>our community mods are stewards for the wellbeing of our community</strong><span>. They ensure that users of our tools have what they need in order to navigate the ATmosphere (the whole AT Protocol ecosystem) free from the kinds of anti-Blackness that runs rampant on other apps.</span></p><p><span>This also means our moderators must have a shared understanding of anti-Blackness, white supremacy, internalized racism, how online misogynoir can lead to violence in the real world, etc. Our processes are adaptive to current events (US presidential elections, </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/09/us/daniel-penny-subway-death-trial" rel="">Daniel Penny trial</a><span>, etc.) and constantly evolving. We codify our rules in an internal SOP document after we reach consensus.</span></p><p>Our moderation tech stack currently consists of a few things:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/03-12-2024-stackable-moderation" rel="">Ozone</a><span>: We self-host an instance of this open source software, where our mods can label and tag posts, and take down accounts on our PDS (where user data is stored), and email accounts</span></p></li><li><p>rsky-labeler: An automated labeler service that scans every post, username, and profile that‚Äôs created or updated to identify anti-Black slurs and alert our team for manual review</p></li><li><p>Alerting system: A queue-based email alert (normal report, post showing in Blacksky feed, etc.)</p></li><li><p>‚ÄúBan From TV‚Äù: A feature that prevents known abusers from being able to view the Blacksky feeds at all</p></li><li><p>The ‚ÄúGreen List‚Äù: AT Protocol allows us to create and share block lists, which users can subscribe to and automatically block bad actors on the list, like those harassing Black users</p></li><li><p><a href="http://github.com/blacksky-algorithms/SAFEskies" rel="">SAFEskies</a><span> app: Our way of allowing moderators to reorder and remove posts from the feed(s) without seeking admin approval, giving them more agency and control over the Blacksky algorithm.</span></p></li><li><p><a href="https://docs.blackskyweb.xyz/docs" rel="">Documentation</a><span>: A site with user-friendly descriptions of Blacksky‚Äôs infrastructure</span></p></li></ul><p><span>In the early days of Bluesky, Black users felt they were being pushed off. Blacksky became a platform for Black users to feel heard and seen. To create Blacksky, we wrote our own implementation of AT Protocol (called </span><a href="https://github.com/blacksky-algorithms/rsky" rel="">‚Äúrsky‚Äù</a><span> and pronounced ‚Äúrisky‚Äù). An underlying premise of Blacksky‚Äôs rsky is to not only ‚Äúseize the means of production,‚Äù as well as the distribution, but to also act as a ‚Äúdual power‚Äù structure.</span></p><p><strong>Blacksky‚Äôs rsky guarantees our community a seat at the table, and ensures that we can leave and easily make our own table if we need to</strong><span>. That‚Äôs the true promise of decentralized social media.</span></p><p>Clearly I think that decentralization is great, not only for the problems it prevents, but also the new possibilities it creates. But if everyone‚Äôs running their own servers, apps, and moderation teams, how do we do global social media? That‚Äôs where our vibrant open source developer community comes in.</p><p><span>Blacksky runs our own global relay at </span><a href="https://atproto.africa/" rel="">https://atproto.africa</a><span>, which we built from scratch. Every day, our relay stores its own copy of the hundreds of gigabytes of data of all known AT Protocol accounts ‚Äî 36 million and counting. We also developed what we call our ‚Äúmoderation relay,‚Äù which lets us know about all of the moderation decisions ever made by all mod teams globally.</span></p><p>This helps us combine efforts with other community moderators, keeping our feeds free of things like transphobia or unwanted sexual content, in addition to anti-Blackness.</p><p>We do this because it ensures the independence of Blacksky, and it builds in some redundancy that makes the whole AT Protocol ecosystem more resilient overall and less reliant on the company running Bluesky. Otherwise, the whole ATmosphere could end up becoming too similar to a centralized app with an API, like a client app connected to Instagram.</p><p><span>Because of our relay, you can create a post on Bluesky, using a Bluesky hosted account, and it will be able to show up in the Blacksky feed, on the Blacksky Community app. For network governance purposes, it‚Äôs important to the future of the ecosystem that other independent organizations create and maintain global services like this. Other orgs and initiatives in this spirit are </span><a href="https://whtwnd.nat.vg/futur.blue/3ls7sbvpsqc2w" rel="">Zeppelin.social</a><span>, </span><a href="https://freeourfeeds.com/" rel="">Free Our Feeds</a><span>, and </span><a href="https://www.microcosm.blue/" rel="">Microcosm</a><span>.</span></p><p><strong>Over the last two years, Blacksky has organically grown into a thriving community.</strong><span> Powering that is a passionate community of moderators, developers, financial contributors, and other volunteers who have made Blacksky into the experience that it is today.</span></p><p>You can help make a better, more equitable internet, not just for Black folks (though we think that‚Äôs a good enough cause) but also for other autonomous communities being developed using AT Protocol and our custom-built, open source tools and resources.</p><p><span>By becoming a regular contributor to our </span><a href="https://opencollective.com/blacksky" rel="">Open Collective</a><span>, you can receive updates on our progress and directly support our work.</span></p><p><em>‚ÄìRudy Fraser, Founder, Blacksky Algorithms</em></p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://opencollective.com/blacksky&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Support Blacksky&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:&quot;button-wrapper&quot;}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://opencollective.com/blacksky" rel=""><span>Support Blacksky</span></a></p><p>Thanks Rudy! </p><p><span>If you missed </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DND409xJTL2/" rel="">this fun video</a><span> from our Operations Fellow, Miriam Tinberg, it‚Äôs worth checking out.</span></p><p>Trying to get to the pool before the end of summer,</p><p>‚ÄìJosh</p></div></article></div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div></div>]]></description>

  <div>
    
            <div><p>Earlier this month I covered <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/reverse-engineering-raspberry-pi-zero-2w">Jonathan Clark's effort to reverse-engineer the Pi Zero 2 W</a>, and just yesterday, I discovered <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/tubetime.bsky.social/post/3lx6erpo5lc2u">TubeTime reverse-engineered the Compute Module 5</a>.</p>



<p>Both are graciously sharing their schematics and process on GitHub:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jonny12375/rp3a0">jonny12375/rp3a0</a> for the Zero 2 W / RP3A0</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/schlae/cm5-reveng">schlae/cm5-reveng</a> for the CM5 / RP2712</li>
</ul>

<p>Raspberry Pi shares limited board schematics, but sometimes‚Äîespecially when digging into some esoteric edge case for a carrier board, or in Jonathan's case, desoldering all the chips and building a Pi Zero 2W into a Pico form factor PCB‚Äîyou need more.</p>

</p>

<p>Well, in both cases, I realized <em>after</em> the fact I was sitting on some highly detailed Lumafield scans, which I had planned on making a video going through at some point for a project I'm working on this year. But that data would've helped in both projects (at least mildly). It's not as good as hand-sanding a PCB and getting high resolution scans, but it is especially helpful in getting a 'look inside' 3D representation of the complete board.</p>

<p>So, along with a video on my 2nd YouTube channel today, I'm releasing <em>all</em> the Lumafield scans of the modern Raspberry Pi lineup (excluding the larger keyboard form factor Pis, like the Pi 400 and Pi 500... maybe I can get to those too, someday).</p>

<p>Here's the video:</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p id="speakable-summary">Google is tightening security measures around Android app distribution, the company announced on Monday. Starting next year, Google will begin to verify the identities of developers distributing their apps on Android devices, not just those who distribute via the Play Store. The changes will affect all <a href="https://www.android.com/certified/partners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">certified Android devices</a> once live, though the global rollout will be more gradual.</p>

<p>The tech giant stresses that this does not mean developers can‚Äôt distribute outside of the Play Store through other app stores or via sideloading ‚Äî Android will remain open in that regard. However, developers who appreciated the anonymity of alternative distribution methods will no longer have that option. Google says this will help to cut down on bad actors who hide their identity to distribute malware, commit financial fraud, or steal users‚Äô personal data. </p>







<p>According to its own survey, Google says that more than 50 times more malware came through internet-sideloaded sources compared with Google Play, where it has required developer verification since 2023.</p>

<p>Initially, Google will allow interested developers to sign up for early access starting in October 2025 to test the system and provide feedback. In March 2026, verification will go live for all developers. By September 2026, any app installed on an Android device in Brazil, Indonesia, Singapore, and Thailand will have to meet the new requirements. Starting in 2027, the requirements will begin rolling out globally.</p>

<p>Developers will have to provide their legal name, address, email, and phone number, which could push independent developers to register as a business for their own privacy‚Äôs sake. Apple implemented a similar change for the EU App Store earlier this year to comply with the&nbsp;<a href="https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/digital-services-act_en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Digital Services Act</a>&nbsp;(DSA), a regulation that now requires app developers to provide their ‚Äútrader status‚Äù to submit new apps or app updates for distribution.</p>

<p>Google notes that student and hobbyist developers will be able to use a separate type of Android Developer Console account when this system rolls out, as their needs differ from commercial developers.</p>

<p>The changes could have a significant impact on the Android app ecosystem and app distribution, as Google works to cut down on the security issues and malware that have typically plagued its platform. </p>

<p>To combat malware and financial scams, Google announced today that only apps from developers that have undergone verification can be installed on certified Android devices starting in 2026.</p>



<p>This requirement applies to ‚Äúcertified Android devices‚Äù that have Play Protect and are preloaded with Google apps. The Play Store implemented similar requirements <a href="https://9to5google.com/2023/11/09/google-play-more-app-testing/">in 2023</a>, but Google is now mandating this for all install methods, including third-party app stores and sideloading where you download an APK file from a third-party source.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Think of it like an ID check at the airport, which confirms a traveler‚Äôs identity but is separate from the security screening of their bags; we will be confirming who the developer is, not reviewing the content of their app or where it came from.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Google wants to combat ‚Äúconvincing fake apps‚Äù and make it harder for repeat ‚Äúmalicious actors to quickly distribute another harmful app after we take the first one down.‚Äù A recent analysis by the company found that there are ‚Äúover 50 times more malware from internet-sideloaded sources than on apps available through Google Play.‚Äù</p>



<p>Google is explicit today about how ‚Äúdevelopers will have the same freedom to distribute their apps directly to users through sideloading or to use any app store they prefer.‚Äù</p>	
	



<p>This new requirement sees Google create a new Android Developer Console for those that only distribute outside of Google Play. Students and hobbyists will get a separate workflow that differs from commercial developers.&nbsp;</p>




	<p>Those that distribute via Google Play ‚Äúlikely already met these verification requirements through the existing Play Console process,‚Äù with a <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2023/07/boosting-trust-and-transparency-in-google-play.html">D-U-N-S</a> number for organizations needed.</p>



<p>The first Android app developers will get access to verification this October, with the process opening to all in March 2026.</p>



<p>The requirement will go into effect in September 2026 for users in Brazil, Indonesia, Singapore, and Thailand. Google notes how these countries have been ‚Äúspecifically impacted by these forms of fraudulent app scams.‚Äù Verification will then apply globally from 2027 onwards.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>At this point, any app installed on a certified Android device in these regions must be registered by a verified developer.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Google notes ‚Äúsupportive initial feedback‚Äù from government authorities and other parties:</p>



<hr>



<ul>
<li>‚Ä¶with Indonesia‚Äôs Ministry of Communications and Digital Affairs praising it for providing a ‚Äúbalanced approach‚Äù that protects users while keeping Android open.</li>



<li>‚Ä¶Thailand‚Äôs Ministry of Digital Economy and Society sees it as a ‚Äúpositive and proactive measure‚Äù that aligns with their national digital safety policies.</li>



<li>In Brazil, the Brazilian Federation of Banks (FEBRABAN) sees it as a ‚Äúsignificant advancement in protecting users and encouraging accountability.‚Äù</li>
</ul>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://blog.rubygems.org/2025/08/25/rubygems-security-response.html">https://blog.rubygems.org/2025/08/25/rubygems-security-response.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45016794">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      
        <p>Recently, Socket.dev published <a href="https://socket.dev/blog/60-malicious-ruby-gems-used-in-targeted-credential-theft-campaign">research</a> highlighting malicious gems
designed to steal social media credentials. We wanted to use this as an
opportunity to share more about how RubyGems.org security operates, how
we proactively handled this incident (and others), and the work our team
is doing each day to keep the ecosystem safe.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-detect-malicious-gems">How We Detect Malicious Gems</h2>

<p><strong>RubyGems.org security uses a proactive and multi-layered approach:</strong></p>

<p><strong>1. Automated detection:</strong> Every gem upload is analyzed using both
static and dynamic code analysis, including behavioral checks and
metadata review. Much of this capability comes from Mend.io‚Äôs
supply chain security tooling (originally built by our own Maciej
Mensfeld, a maintainer on the RubyGems team).</p>

<p><strong>2. Risk scoring:</strong> Each package is given a score. Higher-risk gems
are escalated for manual review by a member of our security team.</p>

<p><strong>3. Retroactive scanning:</strong> As detection techniques improve, older
packages are automatically rescanned, which allows us to catch
threats that may have slipped through in the past. (This is how we
found the threat actor that Socket.dev later investigated.)</p>

<p><strong>4. External sources:</strong> We sometimes receive alerts from vulnerability
databases, industry partners, and cross-registry collaborations,
which help us identify patterns across ecosystems.</p>

<p>Through steps 1 - 3, our team detects the majority (roughly 70-80%) of
malicious packages before they are ever reported to us or the public.</p>

<h2 id="what-happens-when-we-flag-a-gem">What Happens When We Flag a Gem</h2>

<p><strong>Once a gem is flagged, we:</strong></p>

<p><strong>1. Verify:</strong> A RubyGems security engineer reviews the code to confirm
malicious intent (about 95% of flagged packages prove to be
legitimate).</p>

<p><strong>2. Double-check:</strong> When there‚Äôs any doubt, we seek a second opinion
within the team.</p>

<p><strong>3. Remove:</strong> Confirmed malicious gems are removed via a standardized
process in our admin panel.</p>

<p><strong>4. Document:</strong> Every action is logged with reasoning for
traceability.</p>

<p><strong>5. Protect further:</strong> In some cases, we preemptively block suspicious
gem names (for example, ones mimicking company internals) to
prevent possible abuse.</p>

<h2 id="this-incident">This Incident</h2>

<p><strong>This is the timeline of the actions our team took concerning the
incident reported by Socket.dev:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>July 20, 2025 ‚Äì</strong> Our systems flagged suspicious gems, and the
team confirmed malicious credential-stealing behavior. We would
like to specifically credit RubyGems maintainer Maciej Mensfeld
for this.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>July 23‚Äì28 ‚Äì</strong> We removed nearly all of the affected packages
and terminated the associated accounts. We would like to
acknowledge again Maciej Mensfeld for his security work here, as
well as Josef ≈†im√°nek, who provided a second opinion and helped
with package removal.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>August 7 ‚Äì</strong> Socket.dev published their report and notified us of
16 additional gems from related accounts, which we also removed.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In total, we removed all malicious packages from this threat actor,
including two not covered in the original report.</p>

<p>Socket.dev has also <a href="https://socket.dev/blog/follow-up-on-malicious-ruby-gems-campaign">published an updated accounting</a> of this incident
after talking directly with our team and clarifying key details about
our response.</p>

<p><strong>It‚Äôs also important to note:</strong> this campaign involved a small number
of gems. Widely used and trusted packages were not affected.</p>



<p>We welcome and encourage researchers and community members to work with
us by reporting issues through these channels:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Email:</strong> You can also reach us at
<a href="mailto:security@rubygems.org">security@rubygems.org</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Slack:</strong> Join the <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/bundler/shared_invite/zt-1rrsuuv3m-OmXKWQf8K6iSla4~F1DBjQ">Bundler
Slack</a>
to connect with the RubyGems.org team and community of committers
and developers.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Once we receive reports, we acknowledge them, review them quickly, and
follow up with the person who made the report. We are grateful for every
contribution that helps keep RubyGems and the Ruby ecosystem secure.</p>

<h2 id="the-reality-of-supply-chain-security">The Reality of Supply Chain Security</h2>

<p>RubyGems.org is smaller than ecosystems like
<a href="https://github.com/npm">npm</a> but malicious activity is
still a serious threat. On average, we remove about one malicious or
spam package per week, though that number can spike higher.</p>

<p>This work is resource-intensive. Most of our efforts are currently
supported by sponsors, including <a href="http://mend.io/">Mend.io</a>
and <a href="https://alpha-omega.dev/">Alpha-Omega</a>, but a
significant portion of time comes from contributions by volunteer
maintainers. Many of these maintainers have personally dedicated over a
decade to this critical work, driven by their passion and commitment to
keeping the Ruby ecosystem secure.</p>

<p><strong>If your company depends on RubyGems.org, consider supporting its
maintenance and security directly through our <a href="https://rubycentral.org/news/rubygems-org-funding-model-a-new-path-for-community-led-growth/">RubyGems Supporter
Program</a>.</strong>
Community funding enables us to continue to invest in the people,
infrastructure, and security work that keep RubyGems safe and keep
RubyGems.org a community-led service.</p>

<h2 id="in-closing">In Closing</h2>

<p><strong>This recent incident shows our security systems working as intended:</strong>
threats were detected, removed, and contained before they could cause
widespread harm.</p>

<p>Security in open source will always be a shared effort. We want to thank
Socket.dev for their research, as well as the broader community for
continuing to report issues.</p>

<p>You are welcome to reach out to us through the above channels if you
have any additional questions.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto"><p>Liquid cooling is a familiar concept to PC enthusiasts, and has a long history in enterprise compute as well. Recently, liquid cooling has taken an increasing role in datacenters, amid increasing power draw and correspondingly high heat output from the latest chips. Machine learning in particular has an insatiable appetite for power and cooling. Google notes that water has a thermal conductivity about 4000 times that of air, making it an attractive solution to deal with the cooling demands associated with the current AI boom. Their talk at Hot Chips 2025 focuses on datacenter-level cooling for their TPUs, which are machine learning accelerators.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!nH5V!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F175b8f8a-00fb-48e0-a742-dd90e1a5937a_1574x840.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!nH5V!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F175b8f8a-00fb-48e0-a742-dd90e1a5937a_1574x840.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!nH5V!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F175b8f8a-00fb-48e0-a742-dd90e1a5937a_1574x840.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!nH5V!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F175b8f8a-00fb-48e0-a742-dd90e1a5937a_1574x840.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!nH5V!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F175b8f8a-00fb-48e0-a742-dd90e1a5937a_1574x840.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!nH5V!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F175b8f8a-00fb-48e0-a742-dd90e1a5937a_1574x840.png" width="1456" height="777" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/175b8f8a-00fb-48e0-a742-dd90e1a5937a_1574x840.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:777,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1567453,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://chipsandcheese.com/i/171824794?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F175b8f8a-00fb-48e0-a742-dd90e1a5937a_1574x840.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!nH5V!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F175b8f8a-00fb-48e0-a742-dd90e1a5937a_1574x840.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!nH5V!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F175b8f8a-00fb-48e0-a742-dd90e1a5937a_1574x840.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!nH5V!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F175b8f8a-00fb-48e0-a742-dd90e1a5937a_1574x840.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!nH5V!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F175b8f8a-00fb-48e0-a742-dd90e1a5937a_1574x840.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Google‚Äôs foray into liquid cooled TPUs took form in 2018 after some experimentation and iteration. The company has continued to develop and advance their cooling designs since. Their current liquid cooling solution is designed for datacenter scale, with liquid cooling loops spanning racks rather than being contained within servers. Racks of six CDUs, or Coolant Distribution Units, perform a role analogous to the radiator+pump combo in an enthusiast water cooling loop. The CDUs use flexible hoses and quick disconnect couplings to ease maintenance and reduce tolerance requirements. A CDU rack can provide adequate cooling capacity with five CDUs active, allowing maintenance on one unit without downtime.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!La3-!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe40da4f9-3950-472f-95f5-fa2f2f85fa39_1543x877.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!La3-!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe40da4f9-3950-472f-95f5-fa2f2f85fa39_1543x877.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!La3-!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe40da4f9-3950-472f-95f5-fa2f2f85fa39_1543x877.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!La3-!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe40da4f9-3950-472f-95f5-fa2f2f85fa39_1543x877.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!La3-!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe40da4f9-3950-472f-95f5-fa2f2f85fa39_1543x877.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!La3-!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe40da4f9-3950-472f-95f5-fa2f2f85fa39_1543x877.png" width="1456" height="828" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e40da4f9-3950-472f-95f5-fa2f2f85fa39_1543x877.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:828,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1064929,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://chipsandcheese.com/i/171824794?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe40da4f9-3950-472f-95f5-fa2f2f85fa39_1543x877.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!La3-!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe40da4f9-3950-472f-95f5-fa2f2f85fa39_1543x877.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!La3-!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe40da4f9-3950-472f-95f5-fa2f2f85fa39_1543x877.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!La3-!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe40da4f9-3950-472f-95f5-fa2f2f85fa39_1543x877.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!La3-!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe40da4f9-3950-472f-95f5-fa2f2f85fa39_1543x877.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>CDUs exchange heat between coolant liquid and the facility-level water supply.

To further optimize cooling, Google employs another techniques with parallels in the enthusiast world. TPUv4 switches to a bare-die setup compared to TPUv3‚Äôs lidded one. That mirrors delidding in the enthusiast world, where PC builders with especially strong stomachs remove heatspreaders (lids) to gain the higher heat transfer efficiency that bare die cooling can provide. For Google‚Äôs part, TPUv4 needs such an approach because it has 1.6x higher power draw compared to TPUv3.</p><p>Beyond moving heat off chips, liquid cooling helps reduce cooling-related power requirements. Google found the power consumption of liquid cooling pumps was less than 5% of fan power associated with an air cooling solution. Because Google uses water-to-water heat transfer to get heat off the coolant, the bulk of cooling power comes from pumps. Enthusiast setups don‚Äôt realize this potential advantage because they use liquid to move heat from chips to a more optimal location for air cooling. Usually, that‚Äôs a radiator with a fan mounted at a case intake. In theory, a PC builder could try exchanging heat to a toilet tank, allowing for highly efficient cooling with each flush. But fan and pump power in a water cooled PC is quite low in absolute terms, especially compared to the high RPM fans typically found in a server. Thus there‚Äôs little reason for an enthusiast to tackle cooling-related power.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-5OK!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f95e9b7-e5f8-4547-90ba-bb142202262f_2180x1306.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-5OK!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f95e9b7-e5f8-4547-90ba-bb142202262f_2180x1306.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-5OK!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f95e9b7-e5f8-4547-90ba-bb142202262f_2180x1306.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-5OK!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f95e9b7-e5f8-4547-90ba-bb142202262f_2180x1306.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-5OK!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f95e9b7-e5f8-4547-90ba-bb142202262f_2180x1306.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-5OK!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f95e9b7-e5f8-4547-90ba-bb142202262f_2180x1306.png" width="1456" height="872" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0f95e9b7-e5f8-4547-90ba-bb142202262f_2180x1306.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:872,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1216356,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://chipsandcheese.com/i/171824794?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f95e9b7-e5f8-4547-90ba-bb142202262f_2180x1306.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-5OK!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f95e9b7-e5f8-4547-90ba-bb142202262f_2180x1306.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-5OK!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f95e9b7-e5f8-4547-90ba-bb142202262f_2180x1306.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-5OK!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f95e9b7-e5f8-4547-90ba-bb142202262f_2180x1306.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-5OK!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f95e9b7-e5f8-4547-90ba-bb142202262f_2180x1306.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Finally, maintenance is a concern.

PC builders with an open loop have to power down their machine before draining the loop and replacing components. Google‚Äôs extra CDU, mentioned earlier, allows maintenance with zero downtime. But Google takes measures beyond that, because a small problem with one machine can translate to a maintenance nightmare at scale.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!zY4p!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faab3b4a5-1dc9-4eea-b316-c43952bd7879_2311x1150.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!zY4p!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faab3b4a5-1dc9-4eea-b316-c43952bd7879_2311x1150.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!zY4p!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faab3b4a5-1dc9-4eea-b316-c43952bd7879_2311x1150.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!zY4p!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faab3b4a5-1dc9-4eea-b316-c43952bd7879_2311x1150.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!zY4p!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faab3b4a5-1dc9-4eea-b316-c43952bd7879_2311x1150.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!zY4p!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faab3b4a5-1dc9-4eea-b316-c43952bd7879_2311x1150.png" width="1456" height="725" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/aab3b4a5-1dc9-4eea-b316-c43952bd7879_2311x1150.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:725,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:572413,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://chipsandcheese.com/i/171824794?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faab3b4a5-1dc9-4eea-b316-c43952bd7879_2311x1150.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!zY4p!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faab3b4a5-1dc9-4eea-b316-c43952bd7879_2311x1150.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!zY4p!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faab3b4a5-1dc9-4eea-b316-c43952bd7879_2311x1150.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!zY4p!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faab3b4a5-1dc9-4eea-b316-c43952bd7879_2311x1150.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!zY4p!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faab3b4a5-1dc9-4eea-b316-c43952bd7879_2311x1150.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Google extensively validates components with leak testing, uses alerting systems to discover problems like leaks, and takes preventative measures like scheduled maintenance and filtration.

Both worlds are driven to liquid cooling by its incredibly efficiency when moving heat. Both must contend with similar problems. But datacenter approahces diverge from there, and driven by scale and reliability requirements. Plenty of water cooling hardware is already visible on the first day of Hot Chips 2025. Nvidia has a GB300 server on display, with external water cooling connections clearly visible.

									<h2>Temporary Suspension of Acceptance of Mail to the United States Due to Changes in U.S. Customs and Regulations</h2>
									<!-- „Çø„Ç§„Éà„É´ end -->

				<!-- Êó•‰ªò start -->
				<p>August 25, 2025</p>

				<!-- ÂÜÖÂÆπ start -->
				<p>On July 30, 2025, the U.S. government issued an executive order titled ‚ÄúTermination of De Minimis Treatment for All Countries‚Äù regarding mail to the United States.</p>

				<p>Under this executive order, starting August 29, 2025, mail containing goods imported for personal use (taxable mail) will no longer be eligible for duty-free treatment, and tariffs will be imposed. On August 15, 2025, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) announced new guidelines regarding the elimination of de minimis rules, which require that transport operators pay customs deposits to CBP and prepare customs declarations. The procedures that transport operators and postal operators in each country must follow to comply with these guidelines are not clear, however, making implementation difficult.</p>

				<p>Therefore, starting August 27 (Wed.), in line with other national postal operators, we will temporarily suspend the acceptance of postal items (small packets, parcels, and EMS (goods)) to the United States that contain the following items:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Individual gifts with a content value exceeding 100 US dollars</li>
					<li>Goods intended for sale for consumption</li>
				</ul>

				<p>In addition, we will continue to accept letters, postcards, printed matter, EMS (documents), and postal items (small packets, parcels, and EMS (goods)) containing gifts between individuals with a value of less than US$100.</p>

				<p>As an alternative to the above suspension of acceptance, our international courier service, UGX (U-Global Express), can handle shipments in compliance with U.S. customs regulations:</p>

				<p><a href="https://www.post.japanpost.jp/int/UGX/index_en.html">UGX (U-Global Express)</a></p>

				<p>We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your understanding.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><hr><p>Over the past couple of years I‚Äôve been experimenting with MiniPCs, and the more I do, the more I‚Äôm convinced this is
the future I want to invest in.</p><h2 id="the-many-advantages-of-minipcs">The Many Advantages Of MiniPCs
<a href="#the-many-advantages-of-minipcs">#</a></h2><p>Before I ramble on about how great something I like is, first let me assure you that I know they‚Äôre not perfect either,
and might not be what some people want.
Nevertheless, here are my own reasons and explanations for how I came to be swayed in this direction, why I think it‚Äôs a
good idea, and why I would recommend this to others.</p><h3 id="cheap-and-replaceable">Cheap and Replaceable
<a href="#cheap-and-replaceable">#</a></h3><p>MiniPCs are all-in-one, factory built, shipped as-is products.
The converged supply chain and economy of scale usually leads to MiniPCs being cheap, or at least with very high bang
per buck all things considered.</p><p>However, because of these same reasons, they are usually not repairable, and theoretically produce more E-waste.
I don‚Äôt worry about this too much: they are fully solid state machines, running on low power and low-ish temperatures,
thus making their rate of degradation much slower than some beefy machine churning 24/7.</p><h3 id="small-and-compact">Small and Compact
<a href="#small-and-compact">#</a></h3><p>It‚Äôs called mini because it is.
These adorable devices don‚Äôt take up space, and in a pinch, are portable as well!
If you need lots of computers around the house, this is the way to go.</p><p>Need a living room HTPC to browse the internet and such on a big screen at social gatherings?
Get a MiniPC and chuck it behind the TV.
No one will even notice it.</p><p>Have a small desk nook where you do some light work?
Connect the monitor, mouse, and keyboard to a MiniPC.
It looks like a dock, but it‚Äôs actually the entire computer!</p><h3 id="power-efficiency">Power Efficiency
<a href="#power-efficiency">#</a></h3><p>Most MiniPCs are based on low-voltage hardware.
The power draw can vary in peak usage based on how beefy it is, but they are the kings of idle power consumption.
You can expect average power draws of 20-50W in usage and 6-12W in idle.</p><p>Put that in perspective with high-end machines with hardware concerned with performance and not power draw, that can
easily idle at 100W.</p><p>Things that need to run 24/7 but aren‚Äôt actually in use 24/7 are great beneficiaries of running on MiniPCs.
And in the long run, your electricity bill will be lowered using several MiniPCs versus a big bad box.
If the actual price doesn‚Äôt seem that much to you, at least take solace in knowing you‚Äôre going greener and consume

If that‚Äôs not important either, then you‚Äôre hard to please, aren‚Äôt you?</p><p>How about we allow ourselves to ponder a little on the not so distant future?
The current hardware is generally still <code>x86_64</code>, but in future we‚Äôll have ARM, or dare I dream, RISC-V?
We‚Äôll get less power consumption for the same level of compute or more compute for the same level of power consumption.
Ok, Apple already has this with the M4s, and that‚Äôs exactly my point, look how well it works!
And there‚Äôs also a handful ARM based boards out there, it‚Äôs just a matter of time till they reach general availability.</p><h3 id="versatile-through-specializations">Versatile Through Specializations
<a href="#versatile-through-specializations">#</a></h3><p>You cannot use a MiniPC do to everything, but everything you need to do can be done by a MiniPC.
By mixing and matching different types of MiniPCs, you can cover all your computing needs!</p><ul><li><p><strong>General Compute</strong>:
The first one you think of, run-of-the-mill MiniPCs are usually just this, laptop-grade hardware in custom PCBs in a
different form factor.</p></li><li><p><strong>Networking</strong>:
You can find MiniPCs with 4-6 ethernet ports too, making them an ideal platform to run custom firewalls, routers, or
simply a personal VPN connected 24/7 to your network.
They are more powerful and smaller than your average routers.</p></li><li><p><strong>Network Storage</strong>:
You can get MiniPCs with 4-6 internal M.2 slots that are great for building a NAS with.
That is, of course, if you don‚Äôt need mass storage <em>(‚â§20TB)</em>, and you don‚Äôt mind the higher cost per GB of flash
storage.</p></li><li><p><strong>Personal Cloud</strong>:
Take a beefy general compute MiniPC, install Linux on it, and make it a convenient container hoster.
Storage? What for? We can keep that on the NAS. We just do compute here.
If you‚Äôre demanding and want resiliency too, why not get multiple computers and build a mini cluster?</p></li><li><p><strong>Dammit Apple</strong>:
If you‚Äôre like me and want your main station to be Linux, but also have apps and other use-cases that require macOS,
good news, Apple makes MiniPCs too, and quite powerful ones at that.</p></li></ul><h3 id="monoliths-are-hard-to-build">Monoliths Are Hard To Build
<a href="#monoliths-are-hard-to-build">#</a></h3><p>Let‚Äôs imagine you want to build a homelab with the first four use-cases mentioned above.
You will need a motherboard with good I/O, an extra decent network card, a case with many drive bays for storage, lots
of RAM for ZFS, and the services you run, along with a CPU with enough PCI lanes and cores to keep up with all that.</p><p>Usually for this, consumer components don‚Äôt offer <em>exactly</em> what you need.
You might find yourself scouring the web for weird deals on Amazon or second hand markets.
Suppose you find everything, but they don‚Äôt ship at the same time.
Suppose you made a mistake, and you need to return something but because you had to wait to find out about the
incompatibility, you‚Äôre out of the return grace period.</p><p>Okay, maybe that‚Äôs a little too contrived of an example, but the point I‚Äôm making is generally good hardware for a
single desktop to handle everything is hard to come by, and also not very lenient towards you having an easy time.</p><p>And I‚Äôm fairly certain you will get the same utility for a lower or equal price, with much less manual work needed, if
you shop for a few MiniPCs instead.</p><h3 id="no-need-for-virtualization">No Need For Virtualization
<a href="#no-need-for-virtualization">#</a></h3><p>Virtualization is amazing and useful, but also annoying.
That is not to say MiniPCs can‚Äôt do it, in fact they make a good Proxmox host.
But if you use MiniPCs you don‚Äôt <em>need</em> to use VMs in the first place.</p><p>For the NAS + Personal Services example, let us imagine we were on a monolith PC with TrueNAS on bare metal, and we
would like a VM for the media PC connected to a nearby TV, and one container to run Jellyfin.
We want them both hardware-accelerated, and we have two GPUs, great so‚Ä¶ <em>WHOOPS!</em>
We can‚Äôt pass both of them because TrueNAS insists on keeping one for the host, and it‚Äôs really a pain to circumvent.</p><p>If instead we had a MiniPC being just a NAS, one being just a service host, and one being just an operating system for
the TV, we wouldn‚Äôt need to even make any of these considerations.
Everything is already compartmentalized.</p><p>In a sense, <em>you</em> become the virtualization host.
Do you need another VM? Buy a MiniPC and add it to the network.</p><h3 id="avoiding-single-points-of-failure">Avoiding Single Points of Failure

Well actually, the PSU just died couple days ago, I‚Äôm waiting for a replacement.</p><p>‚Äî That‚Äôs unfortunate, but what‚Äôs the connection?</p><p>‚Äî Oh yeah, my bad, those are smart home bullshit. The switch doesn‚Äôt actually go anywhere it sends messages to my
HomeAssistant, which then is supposed to tell the bulbs to turn on.</p><p>‚Äî Home what? Oh‚Ä¶, cool I guess? So why ain‚Äôt it working?</p><p>‚Äî That used to run on the PC, so while that‚Äôs down I can‚Äôt use it.</p><p>‚Äî So you mean to tell me you‚Äôve been using your torch to take a shit this last week because your light bulbs don‚Äôt work
without the PC you watch Netflix on?</p><p>‚Äî Yep‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ <em>yep</em>. I guess in hindsight I would‚Äôve done it differently.</p><p>There‚Äôs a reason why people recommend getting a separate Raspberry Pi for that!

<a href="#less-stressful-fun-to-tinker">#</a></h3><p>This one is simply a personal observation on how I‚Äôve had a mentality shift working with MiniPCs.
Because of the decentralized, isolated nature of their hardware within my home network, I am generally much braver when
tinkering with it.</p><p>Taking the container service compute out of my NAS and into a separate MiniPC allowed me to confidently do whatever to
it, because it‚Äôs separate.
I couldn‚Äôt accidentally screw up my NAS by working on the homelab server.
Even if that was technically true in a virtualized environment inside the NAS, this is about subjective feeling.
This placebo of bravery and confidence is very fun and rewarding.</p><p>Same thing with having the M4 Mini on my second desk.
In the rare event that I do something that temporarily incapacitates my main PC, I am at least relieved I have a backup
computer ready to use if I have important tasks and responsibilities.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion
<a href="#conclusion">#</a></h2><p>MiniPCs are a <em>great idea</em> if you‚Äôre just looking into starting a homelab.
They scale with you, around you, and aren‚Äôt a big upfront investment.</p><p>It‚Äôs indeed a far cry from the initial fantasies I had when first getting into homelabs and self-hosting, namely big
beautiful racks <em>(of server hardware!)</em> I‚Äôd hide locked in a ventilated closet.
I, for one, am extremely satisfied with the modest but very useful setup I ended up having.</p><p>There are many resources and communities online you can look up if you want to learn more.

<h2>Building the Mouse Logitech Won't Make</h2>
<p>2025.08.24 ¬∑ 5 min read</p>

<p>My absolute favorite mouse is the MX Ergo from Logitech. It's a trackball mouse with a good number of buttons and a comfortable, ergonomic tilt. It clicked with me as soon as I tried it, and I've been using one since they came out back in 2017.</p>
<p>However, it's not without its issues. There are 3 main areas where the sheen of perfection wears off:</p>
<ol>
<li>It uses a micro-USB port to charge.</li>
<li>The switches are a little loud and clicky.</li>
<li>The software is bloated.</li>
</ol>
<p>After 8 years waiting for an updated model from Logitech, I decided to stop waiting and see if I could tackle these issues myself.</p>
<p><em>After first publishing this article a helpful commenter let me know Logitech released the MX Ergo S in late 2024, with quieter switches, USB-C, and a $20 price increase. Let's just pretend I wrote this article a year ago! Still, at least this project let me avoid some e-waste.</em></p>
<h2>The Fixes</h2>
<div>
<p>General Disclaimer</p>
<p>These mods could mess up your mouse and will definitely void your warranty. Rechargable batteries can cause fires if handled improperly!</p>
</div>
<h3>Adding USB-C Charging</h3>
<p>I went in apprehensive - how much of a hassle would it be to swap a port? The easiest solution would be to get a short adapter plug and leave it in the mouse, but that felt like it would be a constant reminder of my lack of ambition.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I soon found this incredible <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Converting-the-Logitech-MXERGO-Trackball-Mouse-to-/">guide</a> on how to seamlessly replace the existing port. The port sits on a small PCB under the mainboard. The author of the guide reverse-engineered that PCB, then modified it to accommodate a USB-C port. He made the <a href="https://www.pcbway.com/project/shareproject/Logitech_MX_Ergo_USB_C_PCB_replacement_89459dce.html">designs</a> available through PCBWay, and while you can export the design files and send them anywhere you'd like, I opted to stay with PCBWay to manufacture the boards for my project (I ended up ordering 10 so I had spares).</p>
<p><img alt="PCB Mid-Assembly" src="https://samwilkinson.io/assets/pcb-mid-assembly.jpeg"></p>
<p>Balking at the $50+ charge for turnkey assembly, I opted to take the financially responsible route and pay $200+ for a hot-air rework station to solder it myself. I transferred as many components from the Logitech board as I could. That meant I only needed to source the new port, some resistors, a replacement ribbon cable connector, and a switch.</p>
<p>Getting spare PCBs and components saved me a lot of hassle, as it gave me the opportunity to practice soldering some of the trickier components (the USB-C port turned out to be especially finicky). After some initial trial and error I was able to successfully assemble the new board! </p>
<p><img alt="Fitting the assembled PCB into the mouse" src="https://samwilkinson.io/assets/assembled-pcb.jpeg"></p>
<p>Some quick modifications to the case with a rotary tool provided enough clearance for the larger port. After reassembling the mouse, I was left with a pretty seamless result!</p>
<p><img alt="Finished Mouse with New Port" src="https://samwilkinson.io/assets/mouse-new-port.jpeg"></p>
<p>Overall I spent $45 for the PCBs and around $10 for the required components, making this a reasonably pricey mod. You could probably find an intro discount from a PCB manufacturer to lower the prices a bit! If you're interested in trying this out for yourself, I'd recommend reading through Solderking's <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Converting-the-Logitech-MXERGO-Trackball-Mouse-to-/">guide</a>.</p>
<h3>Silent Switches</h3>
<p>The one mouse that nearly pulled me away from the MX Ergo was the MX Master 3S, also from Logitech. It uses some fantastic silent switches for the left and right clicks, which I found I much preferred over regular mouse switches. </p>
<p>I wanted to replicate that experience as much as I could for the MX Ergo. I started by disassembling the mouse and measuring each switch used so I could find alternatives I might prefer.</p>
<p>The left and right clicks use standard microswitches, and I struck gold with the first alternatives I tried! The <a href="https://lethal.gg/products/huano-silent-2-pcs?_pos=11&amp;_sid=74aa60c1a&amp;_ss=r">Huano Silent</a> switches are exactly what I was looking for. They are almost completely silent, with a soft but satisfying tactile bump when pressed. </p>
<p><img alt="Huano Switch Close-up" src="https://samwilkinson.io/assets/huano-close-up.jpeg"></p>
<p>The scroll-wheel clicks use <code>6x6x4.3mm</code> through-hole switches, while the other buttons use <code>5.25x5.25x1.5mm</code> surface-mount switches. I wasn't as sure about how to find options that might suit me better, as these are essentially commodity products. I ended up ordering a few different options, and settled on the Omron <code>B3F-1002</code> for the scroll-wheel clicks and the Alps Alpine <code>SKQGABE010</code> (see below, left is the new switch and right is the old) for the other buttons.</p>
<p><img alt="SMD Switch Old and New" src="https://samwilkinson.io/assets/old-new-smd.jpeg"></p>
<p>After desoldering and removing the old switches, soldering in their replacements, and reassembling the mouse I could finally try out new switches in actual use. The Huano Silent switches were a huge improvement for me and only cost $2.99! If I were to make one mod this would be it (I ended up ordering a bunch more of them just so I have spares for future mice). While I did notice the change from the other switches, the difference was more minimal and I would probably skip them next time.</p>
<p>If you're interested in trying this for yourself, I'd recommend following a guide like <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Logitech+G603+Switch+Replacement/165937#s349713">this one from iFixit</a> on how to desolder and replace a mouse switch. While the mouse is different the soldering technique is the same!</p>
<h3>Software Upgrade</h3>
<p>I really dislike Logitech's peripheral configuration software (Logi Options+). I find it to be bloated, buggy, and <a href="https://512pixels.net/2024/04/ai-overlay-tmp-home-folder-mac-os/">occasionally malware-like</a>. In 2024 I started using <a href="https://plentycom.jp/en/steermouse/">SteerMouse</a>, and I haven't looked back. It's super lightweight, it can do everything I need it to, and most importantly it just works. I mainly use it to configure the thumb and side buttons to move me between desktop spaces. While it does cost $20, it adds a lot of customization and it works with many other peripherals.</p>
<p><img alt="Steermouse Demo" src="https://samwilkinson.io/assets/steermouse.png"></p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Overall I'm really happy with how this project turned out. I highly recommend swapping in the Huano Silent switches, while the other switch changes are probably overkill. The USB-C port swap isn't super necessary, but it was a fun project and a great introduction to surface-mount soldering. Moving to SteerMouse is easy and boring but it's a much better experience!</p>
<p>More generally, I think there's a lot of fun to be had tweaking the objects we use every day to our liking. Aside from a great mouse, this project has given me a bunch of ideas for things to try next.</p>

<p><strong>FORT GARLAND ‚Äî</strong> In the sandy hills scattered with pi√±on pine and spiky yucca, hundreds of people have relied on a water supply that is so much a part of the local culture that Costilla County residents describe it as a way of life.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Drilling for water is a pricey gamble on the high desert where many live off the grid at 7,500 to 10,000 feet of elevation. A well could cost $25,000 with no guarantee that water will spring, even after digging hundreds of feet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Instead, many people in the poorest county in the state have opted for cisterns, reservoirs buried underground and covered with a plastic lid or cement slab. To fill them, residents drive 20 minutes or so to town, often weekly, with tanks in their pickup trucks or on their trailers to buy water at 10 cents a gallon, or they have it delivered for an extra fee.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is time-consuming, tedious and steeped in routine. And in Fort Garland, the system was abruptly cut off this month ‚Äî without warning or notice.</p>

<p>The fight over the water has pitted residents of Fort Garland who have plumbing and pay for metered water against those living outside the city limits with cisterns. The board of the Fort Garland Water and Sanitation District ‚Äî which cut off water sales to rural residents Aug. 1 in a 3-2 vote that wasn‚Äôt even on its meeting agenda ‚Äî has devolved into shouting matches and dysfunction. Board members have referred to disgruntled residents as an ‚Äúangry mob,‚Äù and one city resident shushed the water district administrator as she explained the deficiencies of the town water system.&nbsp;</p>


<p>People who relied on Fort Garland water to fill their cisterns have been left dry. In the heat of summer, some have gotten water from neighbors who have wells, though well-sharing is illegal. Some are driving two hours to Pueblo to buy water. Many have been getting water in the town of Blanca, where officials offered ‚Äî only as an emergency solution until the end of August ‚Äî to let people fill up water tanks from a hose connected to a fire hydrant.</p>

<p>The water crisis has forced older residents to contemplate selling their dream homes, where they had planned to retire. Others are wondering whether to scrap plans to build on their property, leaving home for showers and limiting their toilet flushes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Underneath it all is a deep concern about whether this is a preview of the water wars ahead as the West deals with <a href="https://coloradosun.com/2025/08/21/colorado-river-forced-water-cuts-state-official-plan/">unprecedented drought</a> and its residents compete for a resource that is finite yet essential to life.</p>

But since the Fort Garland Water &amp; Sanitation District ended bulk water sales to people living outside town limits, the couple has been scrambling to fill their cistern with water. (Mike Sweeney, Special to The Colorado Sun)</figcaption></figure>

<h2 id="h-water-was-never-guaranteed">Water was never guaranteed</h2>

<p>Most of those affected live in the Sangre de Cristo Ranches, a 44,000-acre residential area that once was the <a href="https://www.9news.com/article/news/local/multimillionaire-sells-historic-ranch-to-billionaire/73-343274758#:~:text=FORT%20GARLAND%20(AP)%20%2D%20Multimillionaire,fund%20manager%20Louis%20Moore%20Bacon.&amp;text=The%20Forbes%20family%20had%20held,of%20Denver%2C%20for%20four%20decades.">Forbes Trinchera Ranch</a>. The dwellings range from multistory homes with sweeping decks facing Blanca Peak, the standout of the mountain range, to modest one-room houses and campers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some residents have wells. But hundreds of people in the county of about 3,700 rely on cisterns to drink, cook and bathe.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The situation is most dire for those who are older or have physical disabilities. Many were paying a private business, Wood &amp; Water, to deliver water purchased from the Fort Garland filling station to their cisterns. The local couple who operated the water and firewood service in the San Luis Valley <a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100090129622788">closed within days</a> of the Fort Garland water board vote.</p>

<p>Amanda Ellis and Paul Branson live off a dirt road, no neighbors within sight. They run an apothecary and a wildfire mitigation business, grow vegetables and herbs, use solar power, and have a cistern buried under the sandy earth near their driveway. The water in the cistern is piped to their faucets.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Losing their water source has caused daily stress and deep-seated worry.</p>

<p>When water isn‚Äôt available, finding it becomes all-consuming. ‚ÄúHauling water is your water for everything ‚Äî lifestyle, dishes, consumption, the whole bit,‚Äù said Branson, who for years worked in emergency management. ‚ÄúSo not having that immediate option is of great concern. It‚Äôs stressful.‚Äù&nbsp;</p>

<p>It‚Äôs unnerving, to the point that Branson has wondered whether cutting off water to rural residents is a step in the San Luis Valley‚Äôs hazardous mitigation plan for drought. ‚ÄúIt seems like locking down on water availability is possibly a theme here, which begs the question, why?‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúHere are some things we‚Äôll do should its ugly head start to rise and impact people, right?‚Äù</p>

<p>Ellis bought the house five years ago after traveling the country in a van as a freelance journalist. ‚ÄúI was always drawn to the mountains when I was traveling around the country and, to be honest, it was affordable,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt was off grid. It had a structure. It was away from people. The view is incredible. There‚Äôs climbing, hiking. It was somewhere I could afford and have land in Colorado.‚Äù</p>

<p>Having water was never a ‚Äúguarantee,‚Äù she knows, but the way county residents were cut off with no warning, no time to prepare, was unethical, she said. Many residents had no idea how tenuous the water supply actually was.&nbsp;</p>

<p>‚ÄúRealtors are selling homes with (cistern) permits saying that there‚Äôs the availability to get water hauled in,‚Äù Ellis said. ‚ÄúIt was never guaranteed. Apparently, they are not and never have been obligated to sell water outside of city limits. They‚Äôve just done that for a very long time.‚Äù</p>

<h2 id="h-water-pump-broke-water-restrictions-stirred-up-anger">Water pump broke, water restrictions stirred up anger</h2>

<p>The trouble began when the pump broke in Fort Garland‚Äôs water system.&nbsp;</p>


<p>Salina Pacheco, who is the manager of the town water district and training to become a water system operator, knew it was coming. She had been talking to the five-member water board about it for two years and had helped secure a $105,000 grant from the Colorado Department of Local Affairs to upgrade the water system, which was suffering from ‚Äúextreme water hammer‚Äù because water traveling through the pipes in opposite directions was colliding.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The pump failed in June, before the system‚Äôs planned overhaul. Townspeople were asked to use the ‚Äúbare minimum‚Äù of water ‚Äî flush the toilets, but don‚Äôt water the lawn.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Frustrations grew, culminating in about 10 people showing up at the Aug. 1 water board meeting to demand action. They wanted the town to stop selling what‚Äôs called ‚Äúbulk water‚Äù to residents of unincorporated Costilla County.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As the meeting intensified, with people ‚Äúhollering‚Äù and cutting off each other‚Äôs sentences, board members called for a vote, even though the issue was not on their agenda, Pacheco recalled. One man held up a hand in her face as she tried to explain why she didn‚Äôt think selling water to rural residents was impacting the town‚Äôs water system.&nbsp;</p>

<p>‚ÄúThese men were brought in because I had put them on a water restriction schedule,‚Äù Pacheco said in an interview. ‚ÄúThey are upset they can‚Äôt water their lawns while people can‚Äôt have water to actually live.‚Äù&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fort Garland uses 120 acre-feet of water per year ‚Äî that‚Äôs 120 acres covered by 1 foot of water. Sales to people in cisterns account for about 1 acre feet per year, Pacheco said. Revenue for the water sales to rural residents totaled $43,000 per year, about 15% of total revenue.</p>

<p>Still, board president John Sanchez and two other members voted to shut down bulk water sales. Customers found out on Facebook after rural residents went to buy water and were turned away.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sanchez did not return a request for comment. Pacheco alleged he is trying to get the board to fire her.</p>


<p>Pacheco said she has brought in attorneys to train board members on meeting rules, including how to listen to public comment and not fight back or take immediate votes on issues raised by the audience. Some of the board members ‚Äúhave been trying to move past the craziness,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve told all of the board members, ‚ÄòI need you to understand your positions.‚Äô‚Äù&nbsp;</p>

<p>As for the board president, she said: ‚ÄúSomebody needs to shut him down.‚Äù&nbsp;</p>

<p>‚ÄúHopefully we can come together as a community,‚Äù Pacheco said. ‚ÄúThis could bring us together instead of creating them and us.‚Äù&nbsp;</p>

<p>Water board member Anthony Neville was among the three to vote to shut off water sales. He told The Sun he did it because he understood why townspeople were angry about the water restrictions and that they ‚Äúpay religiously‚Äù for their metered water. The water district‚Äôs bylaws do not say that it must sell water to people outside of Fort Garland.&nbsp;</p>

<p>‚ÄúNow that we don‚Äôt want to sell water, they think we are obligated to sell water,‚Äù Neville said. ‚ÄúNo, we are not.‚Äù&nbsp;</p>

<p>But Neville said he would vote in the future to restore water sales to rural people.&nbsp;</p>


<p>The water pump is fixed now. He‚Äôs hoping Sangre de Cristo Ranches residents will sign a petition that could result in another board vote and that the rest of the board ‚Äúwould have a heart.‚Äù&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-when-water-seems-scarce-long-time-residents-blame-the-newcomers">When water seems scarce, long-time residents blame the newcomers</h2>

<p>John and Debi Marks bought property in the ranches two years ago with plans to build a retirement home and live off the grid among the pines. For now, the couple in their 50s are living in a camper, parked near the markers that stake out the outline of their future home. The plan is to power with solar and grow food in a small greenhouse.&nbsp;</p>

<p>They opted for a cistern instead of a well, bought the $500 permit and had it buried on their property. They were among the customers of Wood &amp; Water until it went out of business.</p>

<p>The Marks‚Äô plans for their next chapter were going smoothly ‚Äî maybe minus the rattlesnakes seeking shade under their camper. Then their water source evaporated.</p>

<p>Since then, they‚Äôve been on a disciplined mission to fill their 1,750-gallon cistern to the top and conserve water as strictly as possible. They‚Äôve made the most of the town of Blanca‚Äôs offer of emergency water on Tuesdays and Thursdays 8 a.m. to noon. The Marks are squeezing in two trips each morning to fill the 275-gallon tank in the back of their pickup.&nbsp;</p>

<p>They figure a full cistern is enough to last them six months in the camper.&nbsp;</p>

<p>‚ÄúWe wanted to be as independent as possible, and so we searched all over the state for property that would fit our needs, and this fit the bill,‚Äù Debi Marks said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>They love it in the valley, surrounded by mountains on all sides, but they have felt resentment from some of the longtime residents, the accusation that they showed up ‚Äúunprepared‚Äù to live out here. When a necessity for life like water seems scarce, people turn on each other.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI think a lot of what we‚Äôre dealing with are small-town politics,‚Äù John Marks said. ‚ÄúWe all have a common need that is a valuable, sacred resource that we‚Äôre clamoring for, and we just want to be part of a community, to kind of help make things better for us all. So work with us. Please don‚Äôt work against us.‚Äù</p>

(Mike Sweeney, Special to The Colorado Sun)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Elaine, who did not want her full name used because she is a 79-year-old widow who lives alone on a rural dirt road, moved with her late husband to Costilla County full time about 20 years ago. Her in-laws had purchased the property in the 1970s, site unseen, from an ad in Forbes magazine, the owner of which also owned Forbes ranch. When presented with the option of drilling a well or buying water tanks and a cistern, they opted for a cistern.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThat was part of the deal with Forbes, that there would always be water available to those who bought property in the ranches, and so there was no need for us to drill a well,‚Äù she said, sitting on her deck last week under a huge blue sky.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At first, the Forbes Ranch offered water service. Residents just had to call the ranch headquarters when their tanks were low, and a water delivery would arrive, for a fee. When the ranch sold, that arrangement ended, and Elaine and her husband started making regular trips to Fort Garland to fill their water tanks. After he died two years ago, after 60 years of marriage, a friend began helping her with the task.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now, for the first time since moving to her dream home where she looks at the mountains and watches the swarms of hummingbirds on her deck, she is thinking of moving away, perhaps closer to her children and grandchildren. She has started calling well drillers and was quoted from $18,000 to $25,000 with no guarantees. The wait list is about a year.&nbsp;</p>


<p>Knowing that when the water in her tank runs out, she may not get more, has made Elaine vigilant about usage. Like many of her neighbors, she started taking showers at the community center instead of her home.&nbsp;</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou count the times you flush the toilet,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI know that it takes 13 gallons to wash a load of clothes. I know that it takes 6 gallons to do my dishwasher.&nbsp;</p>

<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôve lived a long life, and we worked hard to have this, and it‚Äôs not right at my age that I have to do all that. It‚Äôs fine if they want to say, ‚ÄòOK, we‚Äôre not going to do water anymore,‚Äô but with no notice, no reason? To me, it‚Äôs inhumane. It‚Äôs not morally right either. Where‚Äôs your compassion? They forgot about the people.‚Äù</p>

<h2 id="h-solution-pitched-to-county-commissioners">Solution pitched to county commissioners</h2>

<p>Residents recently brought their concerns to a meeting of the Costilla County commissioners. The most compelling public comment came from a new resident who brought a detailed project pitch for creating a county water station that would serve all the residents who‚Äôve been buying water in Fort Garland, Blanca and the Wildhorse Mesa community. Commissioners responded quickly, with a plan to discuss the off-grid water situation during an emergency work session next week and to take it up at their meeting in early September.</p>

<p>The pitch was to open a metered bulk water filling station on county property modeled after <a href="https://www.canoncity.org/494/Bulk-Water-Station">one in Ca√±on City</a> and using the pre-paid account model similar to the one used by <a href="https://www.suitutil.com/bulk-water-fill-station/">Southern Ute Utilities</a> in southwestern Colorado. The project would cost from $120,000 to $240,000 to build, about $15,000 per year in operating costs and $25,000 per year in water costs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The county is likely to qualify for grants to cover much of the cost, and could net from $95,000 to $120,000 a year, according to the proposal from Sangre de Cristo Ranches resident Wesley Barnett, a former oil field worker from Texas who has dealt with water issues in the oil patch.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The downside, though, is that it would take about a year to put it together, he said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs still a gap,‚Äù Barnett said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A more immediate solution is a potential plan to have a private company bring a water tanker to county-owned property in Fort Garland.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Until there is a solution, rural residents are meticulously tracking their gallons.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Marks stopped flowing water through their camper, instead hauling in 6 gallons at a time, so they can better track what they use. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just that difficult,‚Äù John Marks said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre hand-washing, filling bowls of water. We‚Äôre not sure about the future, so we‚Äôre just trying to be conservative.‚Äù</p>
