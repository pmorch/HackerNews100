    </div><p>For most countries around the world, sourcing energy entirely from wind, solar, geothermal, and hydropower by 2050 would reduce their energy needs and costs, improve air quality, and help slow climate change, according to a <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.4c10686" target="_blank">study</a> in <i>Environmental Science &amp; Technology</i>.</p>

                                        
                                              
                                        
                                                                                                                                    <p>These benefits, the authors say, could be realized at a fraction of the cost of implementing technologies that remove carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) from the air and capture it from stationary emitters like industrial smokestacks.</p>
<p>"If you spend $1 on <a href="https://techxplore.com/tags/carbon+capture/" rel="tag">carbon capture</a> instead of on wind, water, and solar, you are increasing CO<sub>2</sub>, <a href="https://techxplore.com/tags/air+pollution/" rel="tag">air pollution</a>, <a href="https://techxplore.com/tags/energy+requirements/" rel="tag">energy requirements</a>, energy costs, pipelines, and total social costs," said lead study author Mark Jacobson, a professor of civil and environmental engineering in the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability and Stanford School of Engineering.</p>
<p>This holds true even if zero-emission energy systems power the technology deployed to extract carbon dioxide, Jacobson added.</p>
<p>"It's always an opportunity cost to use clean, <a href="https://techxplore.com/tags/renewable+energy/" rel="tag">renewable energy</a> for <a href="https://techxplore.com/tags/direct+air+capture/" rel="tag">direct air capture</a> instead of replacing a fossil-fuel CO<sub>2</sub> source, just like it's an opportunity cost to use it for AI or bitcoin mining. You're preventing renewables from replacing fossil fuel sources because you're creating more demand for those renewables," he said.</p>

                                                                                                        <!-- TechX - News - In-article -->
    
                                                                                                                                            <h2>Comparing two extremes</h2>
<p>Jacobson and co-authors compared the annual energy costs, emissions, public health impacts, and <a href="https://news.stanford.edu/stories/2021/06/professors-explain-social-cost-carbon" target="_blank">social costs</a> associated with implementing either of two extremes across all sectors in 149 countries over the next 25 years.</p>
<p>One extreme would see a complete switch to using heat and electricity generated by wind, solar, geothermal, and hydropower for all energy needs, as well as some advances in <a href="https://techxplore.com/tags/energy+efficiency/" rel="tag">energy efficiency</a>; cuts to energy demand through improved public transit, increased cycling, and telecommuting; and commercialization of hydrogen fuel cells for long-distance air travel and shipping.</p>
<p>For this case, the researchers assume hydrogen would be produced using water and electricity from renewable sources, not with <a href="https://techxplore.com/tags/fossil+fuels/" rel="tag">fossil fuels</a>, which is the way most hydrogen is made today.</p>
<p>The other extreme would see countries maintain their current reliance on fossil fuels with some renewables, nuclear, and biomass—while improving energy efficiency by the same amount as in the all-renewable case.</p>
<p>In this second extreme, all 149 countries would also add equipment to capture carbon dioxide from industrial flues and use technology known as synthetic direct air carbon capture to pull CO<sub>2</sub> from ambient air.</p>
<p>Comparing these two "unrealistically extreme cases," the authors write, distills the climate, health, and social costs associated with investing money in carbon capture and direct air capture that might otherwise go toward electrification and wind, water, and <a href="https://techxplore.com/tags/solar+power/" rel="tag">solar power</a>. Neither case considers the potential costs or benefits of efforts to enhance carbon sequestration in natural carbon sinks like wetlands, forests, soil, and oceans.</p>

                                                                                                                                            <h2>Benefits of eliminating combustion</h2>
<p>Jacobson and co-authors found that if the 149 studied countries successfully eliminated fossil fuels and biomass combustion through renewables and efficiency gains by 2050, they could reduce their end-use energy needs by more than 54%.</p>
<p>Annual <a href="https://techxplore.com/tags/energy+costs/" rel="tag">energy costs</a>, the authors concluded, would decline by nearly 60%. Hundreds of millions of illnesses and 5 million deaths per year related to air pollution from energy—whether from woodburning cookstoves and kerosene lamps or from gas-fired power stations—would be avoided.</p>
<p>"When you add wind turbines to replace a coal plant, you're eliminating not only the CO<sub>2</sub> but also the pollution from the coal," said Jacobson, who is also a senior fellow at the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment.</p>
<p>Widespread electrification reduces energy demand in part because electric heat pumps and vehicles are more efficient than gas heaters and appliances, conventional air conditioners, and internal combustion engines, Jacobson said. Other energy savings come from eliminating energy needed to extract, transport, and refine oil, gas, coal, and uranium.</p>
<p>"You can have the most efficient way of removing CO<sub>2</sub> from the air, but that does not change the efficiency of combustion. You're keeping that inefficient energy infrastructure the same," said Jacobson.</p>
<p>"It's much cheaper and more efficient just to replace the fossil source with electricity or heat provided by a renewable source."</p>

<p>They add, "The only way to eliminate all air-pollutant and climate-warming gases and particles from energy is to eliminate combustion."</p>

<p>In cars, pollution doesn’t come from exhaust alone. It also comes from wear and tear on roads, tires, and brakes. According to new research, tiny bits of dust cast off by brake pads may inflict more harm than car exhaust.</p>
<p>For the <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25688676/">study</a>, published in <em>Particle and Fibre Toxicology</em>, researchers grew human lung cells in a lab and exposed them to dust from car brakes and from diesel tailpipes, finding that brake dust caused greater injury to the cells.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, newer brake pads proved more harmful than older ones, which were made with asbestos. Asbestos, which is known to cause cancer, was used to stop brakes from overheating. While newer pads are made without asbestos, they contain high levels of copper, which can aggravate <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25688676/">asthma</a> when inhaled. Researchers found they could minimize the harm from newer pads by treating brake dust with a chemical that neutralizes copper.</p>
<p><a href="https://dtsc.ca.gov/scp/limiting-copper-in-brake-pads/">California</a> and <a href="https://ecology.wa.gov/waste-toxics/reducing-toxic-chemicals/washingtons-toxics-in-products-laws/better-brakes-law">Washington</a> have both passed laws to limit the use of copper in brake pads, but brake dust remains largely <a href="https://theconversation.com/car-brake-dust-can-be-more-harmful-than-diesel-exhaust-new-study-249736#:~:text=We%20grew%20cells%20in%20the,such%20as%20cancer%20and%20asthma.">unregulated</a> as a pollutant. The new study, authors write, highlights “the need for targeted legislation to protect public health.” </p>
<p>Researchers <a href="https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-reaction-to-study-of-impact-of-emissions-from-brake-pads-on-lung-cells-compared-to-diesel-emissions/">note</a> that the shift to electric vehicles could curb pollution from brake pads. Most electric cars use <a href="https://www.polestar.com/ie/news/eli5-what-is-regenerative-braking/">regenerative braking</a>, in which the car motor turns into a generator, drawing energy from the spinning wheels as they slow to a halt. This limits the need for conventional brake pads.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Starting on February 26th, 2025, Amazon is removing a feature from its website allowing you to download purchased books to a computer and then copy them manually to a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24326185/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-signature-edition-2024-e-reader-review">Kindle</a> over USB. It’s a feature that a lot of Kindle users are probably not aware of, given books can be more easily sent to devices over Wi-Fi, but it’s especially useful for backing up purchases or converting them to other formats compatible with non-Kindle e-readers.</p><p>There are a few reasons why some Kindle users might miss this feature. It’s useful if you don’t have access to a Wi-Fi network, and although it’s a tedious process since purchased books can only be downloaded one at a time, there’s some peace of mind in knowing you have offline copies of all your books.</p><p>It doesn’t happen frequently, but as <em><a href="https://goodereader.com/blog/kindle/amazon-is-not-to-be-trusted-anymore-with-their-kindle-e-reader">Good e-Reader</a></em> points out, Amazon has occasionally removed books from its online store and remotely deleted them from Kindles or edited titles and re-uploaded new copies to its e-readers. In 2009, the company removed copies of <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2009/07/how-amazon-s-remote-deletion-of-e-books-from-the-kindle-paves-the-way-for-book-banning-s-digital-future.html">George Orwell’s <em>Nineteen Eighty-Four</em> and <em>Animal Farm</em></a>, explaining the books had been mistakenly published. More recently, <a href="https://goodereader.com/blog/kindle/ronald-dahl-ebooks-being-updated-automatically-with-censored-versions">many of Roald Dahl’s books</a>, including <em>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</em>, were replaced with updated copies featuring modified language on various ebook platforms. It’s a reminder that you don’t actually own much of the digital content you consume, and without the ability to back up copies of ebooks, you could lose them entirely if they’re banned and removed.</p><p>The feature is also the easiest way to convert books purchased from Amazon to other formats like EPUB that can be used on alternative devices such as a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/604987/kobo-price-increase">Kobo</a>. Books downloaded through Amazon’s website are delivered in the older AZW3 format which allows DRM to be easily removed using various software tools.</p><div><p><a href="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/amazon_kindle1.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0,0,100,100" data-pswp-height="1004" data-pswp-width="1506" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><img alt="A screenshot of Amazon’s website showing a warning that a feature for downloading ebooks is being removed." data-chromatic="ignore" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" sizes="(max-width: 639px) 100vw, (max-width: 1023px) 50vw, 700px" srcset="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/amazon_kindle1.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=256 256w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/amazon_kindle1.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=376 376w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/amazon_kindle1.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=384 384w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/amazon_kindle1.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=415 415w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/amazon_kindle1.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=480 480w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/amazon_kindle1.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=540 540w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/amazon_kindle1.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=640 640w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/amazon_kindle1.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=750 750w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/amazon_kindle1.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=828 828w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/amazon_kindle1.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=1080 1080w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/amazon_kindle1.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=1200 1200w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/amazon_kindle1.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=1440 1440w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/amazon_kindle1.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=1920 1920w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/amazon_kindle1.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=2048 2048w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/amazon_kindle1.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=2400 2400w" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/amazon_kindle1.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=2400"></a></p></div><p>Older Kindle models also store books in the AZW3 format, and they can be extracted by connecting the device to a computer with a USB cable. But <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24303322/amazon-kindle-colorsoft-e-reader-review">modern Kindles</a> use the newer KFX format (<a href="https://goodereader.com/blog/e-book-news/amazon-has-developed-a-new-e-book-format-called-kfx">first rolled out in 2015</a>) which introduced improved font rendering, better layout capabilities, and DRM that’s nearly impossible to circumvent.</p><p>The download feature is a carryover from the days when Kindles didn’t come with Wi-Fi, allowing users who also weren’t able to take advantage of Amazon’s cellular Whispernet service to get purchased books onto their e-readers. It’s still accessible through Amazon’s website by accessing your “Content Library” while logged into your account. For purchased books you select the “More actions” menu, choose “Download &amp; transfer via USB,” select a Kindle device you have registered, and a copy of the book will be downloaded to your computer.</p><p>But the pop-up that appears when selecting the download option now includes an additional warning. “Starting February 26, 2025, the ‘Download &amp; Transfer via USB’ option will no longer be available. You can still send Kindle books to your Wi-Fi enabled devices by selecting the ‘Deliver or Remove from Device’ option.“</p><p>Amazon confirmed the removal of the book download feature in a statement to <em>The Verge</em>. “Customers can continue reading books previously downloaded on their Kindle device, and access new content through the Kindle app, Kindle for web, as well as directly through Kindle devices with WiFi capability,” said Amazon spokesperson Jackie Burke.</p><p>Once this feature goes away, you’ll still be able to manually copy ebook files and other documents to Kindles over USB using <a href="https://www.amazon.com/sendtokindle?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon’s apps</a> or third-party solutions like <a href="https://calibre-ebook.com/">Calibre</a>. You just won’t be able to download copies of your purchased books to a computer.</p><p><strong><em>Update, February 14th: </em></strong><em>Added comment from an Amazon spokesperson.</em></p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>For years, Maciej "Groobo" Maselewski&nbsp;stood as the undisputed champion of <em>Diablo</em> speedrunning. His <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW8XorD9RwI">3-minute, 12-second Sorcerer run</a> looked all but unbeatable thanks to a combination of powerful (and allowable) glitch exploits along with what seemed like some unbelievable luck in the game's randomly generated dungeon.</p>
<p>But when a team of other speedrunners started trying and failing to replicate that luck using outside software and analysis tools, the story behind Groobo's run began to fall apart. As the inconsistencies in the run <a href="https://diablo.tas.bot/">started to mount</a>, that team would conduct an automated search through billions of legitimate <em>Diablo</em> dungeons to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that Groobo's game couldn't have taken place in any of them.</p>
<p>"We just had a lot of curiosity and resentment that drove us to dig even deeper," team member Staphen told Ars Technica of their investigation. "Betrayal might be another way to describe it," team member AJenbo added. "To find out that this had been done illegitimately... and the person had both gotten and taken a lot of praise for their achievement."</p>
<h2>If we have unearned luck</h2>
<p>If you have any familiarity with <em>Diablo</em> or speedrunning, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW8XorD9RwI">watching Groobo's run</a> feels like watching someone win the lottery. First, there's the dungeon itself, which features a sequence of stairways that appear just steps from each other, forming a quick and enemy-free path down to the dungeon's deeper levels. Then there's Groobo's lucky find of <a href="https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Naj%27s_Puzzler_(Diablo_I)">Naj's Puzzler</a> on level 9, a unique item that enables the teleporting necessary for many of the run's late-game maneuvers.</p>

<p>"It seemed very unusual that we would have so many levels with the upstairs and the downstairs right next to each other," Allan "DwangoAC" Cecil told Ars Technica. "We wanted to find some way of replicating this."</p>
<p>When Cecil and a team of tool-assisted speedrunners (TAS) started that search process in earnest last February, they said they used Groobo's run as a baseline to try to improve from. While Groobo ostensibly had to rely on his own human luck in prepping his run, the TAS runners could use techniques and tools from outside the game to replicate Groobo's run (or something very similar) every time.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>To find an RNG seed that could do just that, the TAS team <a href="https://github.com/Matthew-petroff/diablo-mapgen">created a custom-built map generation tool</a> by reverse-engineering a disassembled <em>Diablo</em> executable. That tool can take any of the game's billions of possible random seeds and quickly determine the map layout, item distribution, and quest placement available in the generated save file. A scanner built on top of that tool can then quickly look through those generated dungeons for ones that might be optimal for speedrunning.</p>
<p>"We were working on finding the best seed for our TAS, and we were trying to identify the seed from Groobo's run, both to validate that our scanner works and to potentially straight-up use it for the run," Stephan said of the effort. "We naturally had a lot of trouble finding [that seed] because it doesn't exist."</p>
<h2>A thorough search</h2>
<p>In their effort to find Groobo's storied run (or at least one that resembled it), the TAS team conducted a distributed search across the game's roughly 2.2 billion valid <a href="https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/354373/what-exactly-is-a-seed-in-a-random-number-generator">RNG seeds</a>. Each of these seeds represents a different specific second on the system clock when a <em>Diablo</em> save file is created, ranging from between January 1, 1970, and December 31, 2038 (the only valid dates accepted by the game).</p>
<p>After comparing each of those billions of those RNG dungeons to a re-creation of the dungeon seen in Groobo's run, the team couldn't find a single example containing the crucial level 9 Naj's Puzzler drop. After that, the team started searching through "impossible" seeds, which could only be created by <a href="https://ultimatestuff.tripod.com/ultimatediablo/cheats.htm">using save modification tools</a> to force a creation date after the year 2038.</p>
<p>The team eventually found dungeons matching Naj's Puzzler drop in Groobo's video, using seeds associated with the years 2056 and 2074.</p>

<p>The early presumption that Groobo's run was legitimate ended up costing the team weeks of work. "It was baffling when we couldn't find [the early Naj's Puzzler] in any of the searches we did," Cecil said. "We were always worried that the scanner might have bugs in it," Staphen added.</p>

"Normally you would only need to identify a single level to replicate a run since all the other levels are generated from the same seed," AJenbo told Ars. But the levels seen in Groobo's run came from multiple different seeds, which would require splicing footage from multiple different saves.</p>
<p>"At that point we also wanted to figure out how manipulated the run was," AJenbo said. "Was it a legit run except for [dungeon level] 9? Was it three good runs combined? In the end we only found two levels that had come from the same run so at least 13 (probably 15) runs were spliced into one video, which is a lot for a game with just 16 levels."</p>

<h2>The evidence piles up</h2>
<p>After Groobo's dungeon generation problems came to light, other inconsistencies in his run started to become apparent. Some of these are relatively easy to spot with the naked eye once you know what you're looking for.</p>
<p>For instance, the "1996–2001" copyright date seen on the title screen in Groobo's video is inconsistent with the v1.00 shown on the initial menu screen, suggesting Groobo's run was spliced together from runs on multiple different versions of the game. Items acquired early in the run also disappear from the inventory later on with no apparent explanation.</p>

<p>Even months after the investigation first started, new inconsistencies are still coming to light. Groobo's final fight against Diablo, for instance, required just 19 fireballs to take him out. While that's technically possible with perfect luck for the level 12 Sorcerer seen in the footage, the TAS team found that the specific damage dealt and boss behavior only matched when they attempted the same attacks using a level 26 Sorcerer.</p>
<p>After the TAS team compiled their many findings <a href="https://diablo.tas.bot/">into a lengthy document</a>, Groobo defended his submission in a discussion with Cecil (screenshots of which were viewed by Ars Technica). "My run is a segmented/spliced run," Groobo said. "It always has been and it was never passed off as anything else, nor was it part of any competition or leaderboards. The Speed Demos Archive [SDA] page states that outright." Indeed, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091121211238/https://speeddemosarchive.com/Diablo.html">an archived version of Groobo's record-setting Speed Demos Archive submission</a> does say directly that it's made up of "27 segments appended to one file."</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>But simply splitting a run into segments doesn't explain away all of the problems the TAS team found. Getting Naj's Puzzler on dungeon level 9, for instance, still requires outside modification of a save file, which is specifically prohibited by <a href="https://kb.speeddemosarchive.com/Rules">longstanding Speed Demos Archive rules</a> that "manually editing/adding/removing game files is generally not allowed." Groobo's apparent splicing of multiple game versions and differently seeded save files also seems to go against SDA rules, which say that "there obviously needs to be continuity between segments in terms of inventory, experience points or whatever is applicable for the individual game."</p>
<p>After being presented with the TAS team's evidence, SDA <a href="https://speeddemosarchive.com/">wrote</a> that "it has been determined that Groobo's run very likely does not stem from only legitimate techniques, and as such, has itself been banished barring new developments." But Groobo's record is <a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/110580-fastest-completion-of-an-rpg-videogame">still listed as the "Fastest completion of an RPG videogame"</a> by Guinness World Records, which has not offered a substantive response to the team's findings (Guinness has not responded to a request for comment from Ars Technica).</p>

<p>This might seem like a pretty petty issue to spend weeks of time and attention debunking. But at a recent presentation attended by Ars, Cecil said he was motivated to pursue it because "it did harm. Groobo's alleged cheating in 2009 completely stopped interest in speedrunning this category [of <em>Diablo</em>]. No one tried, no one could."</p>
<p>Because of Groobo's previously unknown modifications to make an impossible-to-beat run, "this big running community just stopped trying to run this game in that category," Cecil said. "For more than a decade, this had a chilling impact on that community." With Groobo's run out of the way, though, new runners are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXG1vW6VEKA">setting new records on confirmed legitimate RNG seeds</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9mn5CpQCFw">with the aid of TAS tools</a>.</p>
<p>In the end, Cecil said he hopes the evidence regarding Groobo's run will make people look more carefully at other record submissions. "Groobo had created a number of well-respected ... speedruns," he said. "[People thought] there wasn't any good reason to doubt him. In other words, there was bias in familiarity. This was a familiar character. Why would they cheat?"</p>

As noted in the June 2024 Berkeley Earth temperature update, although the parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change have “set a goal to limit global warming to no more than 1.5 °C above the pre-industrial, it must be noted that this goal refers to the long-term average temperature.

When will we know that the world has passed this threshold in the long term? Does one year warmer than 1.5 °C signal that the Paris Agreement target has been crossed?</p><p>How to best reconcile information about temporary excursions above 1.5 °C and long-term threshold exceedance, typically defined on the basis of a centred 20-year running mean of global surface temperature, is an open problem; the latter, by definition, requires information about the future. One proposal is to combine historical observations of the past decade with climate model predictions for the next decade to estimate the current long-term mean global surface temperature<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 7" title="Betts, R.

The utility of approaches that merge observations and simulations depends on the accuracy of the initial state and external forcings being prescribed in the models. If there are possible exogenous changes in drivers that are not included in the model simulations, there is a danger of biased estimates of time-of-exceedance. At present, predictions differ slightly as a result of choice of historical observations and future forcings scenario, but estimates typically indicate that threshold crossing will occur sometime in the late 2020s or early 2030s.

<p dir="auto">Kreuzberg provides both async and sync APIs for text extraction, including batch processing. The library exports the following main functions:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">Single Item Processing:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>extract_file()</code>: Async function to extract text from a file (accepts string path or <code>pathlib.Path</code>)</li>
<li><code>extract_bytes()</code>: Async function to extract text from bytes (accepts a byte string)</li>
<li><code>extract_file_sync()</code>: Synchronous version of <code>extract_file()</code></li>
<li><code>extract_bytes_sync()</code>: Synchronous version of <code>extract_bytes()</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Batch Processing:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>batch_extract_file()</code>: Async function to extract text from multiple files concurrently</li>
<li><code>batch_extract_bytes()</code>: Async function to extract text from multiple byte contents concurrently</li>
<li><code>batch_extract_file_sync()</code>: Synchronous version of <code>batch_extract_file()</code></li>
<li><code>batch_extract_bytes_sync()</code>: Synchronous version of <code>batch_extract_bytes()</code></li>

<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">OCR Configuration</h4><a id="user-content-ocr-configuration" aria-label="Permalink: OCR Configuration" href="#ocr-configuration"></a></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><code>force_ocr</code>(default: <code>False</code>): Forces OCR processing even for searchable PDFs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><code>language</code> (default: <code>eng</code>): Specifies the language model for Tesseract OCR. This affects text recognition accuracy for documents in different languages. Examples:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>eng</code> for English</li>
<li><code>deu</code> for German</li>
<li><code>eng+deu</code> for English and German</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Notes: - the order of languages effect processing time, the first language is the primary language and the second language is the secondary language etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><code>psm</code> (Page Segmentation Mode, default: <code>PSM.AUTO</code>): Controls how Tesseract analyzes page layout. In most cases you do not need to change this to a different value.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>Here’s <a href="https://sauropods.win/@mike/111935967471427403">a Mastodon thread from a year ago</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Just a quick check on how ChatGPT’s getting on …</p>
<p><strong>Me</strong>: Who reassigned the species <em>Brachiosaurus brancai</em> to its own genus, and when?</p>
<p><strong>ChatGPT:</strong> The species <em>Brachiosaurus brancai</em> was reassigned to its own genus, <em>Giraffatitan</em>, by the paleontologist Michael Janensch in 1914.</p>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> Dude, that is so wrong I can’t even.</p>
<p><strong>ChatGPT</strong>: I apologize for the mistake in my previous response. The reassignment of <em>Brachiosaurus brancai</em> to <em>Giraffatitan brancai</em> was not done by Michael Janensch. The correct attribution goes to the paleontologist Ernst Stromer, who reclassified it in 1914.</p>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> That answer is even worse. Stromer had nothing to do with the genus name <em>or</em> species name.</p>
<p><strong>ChatGPT:</strong> I apologize for the confusion in my previous responses. The reassignment of <em>Brachiosaurus brancai</em> to <em>Giraffatitan brancai</em> was actually done by the paleontologist Werner Janensch, not Michael Janensch, in 1914.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>sigh</em></p>
<p>Regular readers will know that the actual sequence of events was:</p>
<ul>
<li>Riggs (1903) named the genus <em>Brachiosaurus</em> and its type species <em>Brachiosaurus altithorax</em>.</li>
<li>Janensch (1914) named a second species of this genus, “<em>Brachiosaurus”</em> <em>brancai</em>.</li>
<li>Paul (1988) considered the two species separate at the subgeneric level (a taxonomic level that is rarely if ever used in vertebrate palaeontology) and named the subgenus <em>Brachiosaurus</em> (<em>Giraffatitan</em>) <em>brancai</em>.</li>
<li>Olshevsky (1991) used the genus-and-species combination <em>Giraffatitan brancai</em> without comment in a self-published booklet, a combinaton which was not followed by any formal publication known to me, until …</li>
<li>Taylor (2009) demonstrated that numerous characters separate the two species and that <em>Giraffatitan</em> is a separate genus with type species <em>G</em>. <em>brancai</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, ChatGPT got <em>every single part of that</em> wrong. It left Riggs, Paul, Olshevsky and me out completely. It credited Werner Janensch for reassigning a species to a genus whose name was coined 19 years after he died. It pulled poor Ernst Stromer in for some reason. It invented “the paleontologist Michael Janensch”, who is presumably the unholy offspring of Werner Janensch and me. And in all three answers, it insisted that the reassignment was done in 1914, 74 years before the name <em>Giraffatitan</em> was coined.</p>
<p>But the worst part of this is not the errors. It’s not the blithe confidence with which the false facts are recited. It’s not even the bland “I apologize for the mistake in my previous response” to be followed by more utter nonsense. It’s that <em>these incorrect answers look so plausible</em>. For a lay-person — someone who, foolishly, has not been reading this blog for the last eighteen years — the answers given here look superficially reasonable. A kid doing a homework report on <em>Brachiosaurus</em> could take these answers and weave them into the submission without even having an inkling that they’re completely wrong. And the teacher who has to mark the essay will also likely swallow them.</p>
<p>Because LLMs get catastrophically wrong answers on topics I know well, I do not trust them <em>at all</em> on topics I don’t already know. And if you do trust them, I urge you to spend five minutes asking your favourite one about something you know in detail.</p>
<p>Why do I <a href="https://svpow.com/2023/01/15/these-new-artificial-intelligence-programs-dont-know-what-theyre-talking-about/">keep</a> <a href="https://svpow.com/2024/10/14/more-artificial-intelligence-idiocy/">banging on</a> <a href="https://svpow.com/2024/05/23/another-day-another-catastrophic-ai-failure/">about this</a>? Because we’ve reached an especially toxic phase in the history of AI. A lot of companies have ploughed billions of dollars into the dream of being able to replace human workers with machines, and they are desperate to make us believe it’s going to work — if only so they can cash out their investments while the stocks are still high. We’re in the “pump” phase of an industry-wide pump-and-dump. It would be wise for all to beware getting suckered in.</p>
<p>(<strong>Disclaimer</strong>: LLMs are useful for some classes of queries. I use them a lot to remind me of programming-language idioms, asking questions like “In Go, if I have an object satisfying the <strong>error</strong> interface, how can I determine which specific kind of error structure it is?”. They’re good for this because you can quickly determine whether the answer is correct or not, thanks to the merciless compiler. LLMs are not useless; they’re just way overhyped and misapplied.)</p>

<p><a href="https://wololo.net/tag/acid_snake">Acid_Snake</a> and the <a href="https://wololo.net/tag/ark-4/">ARK</a> Development team have released a significant update to the ARK custom Firmware for the Sony PSP. Custom Firmware now allows the Playstation Portable to connect to WPA2 encrypted Wifi networks. This is thanks to the recently released <em>wpa2psp</em> plugin, created by developer <strong>Moment</strong> and published on the PSP Homebrew discord.</p>
<h2>Playstation Portable gets WPA2 Wifi access</h2>
<p>The PSP has been out of official support from Sony for years, but lots of enthusiasts keep maintaining this great handheld through homebrew and custom Firmware updates. As technology evolves around us, older devices such as the PlayStation Portable can lose some of their features.</p>
<p>For example, as WPA2 has become the defacto encryption standard for home wifi networks (WPA3’s adoption rate remains low), older devices such as the PSP, that do not support these new* encryption standards become technically unable to access the internet.</p>
<p>Wifi access was a very strong feature of the PSP when it was released, and, although it’s probably less important nowadays, losing that feature because newer networks aren’t compatible is a bummer.</p>
<p>WPA2 support has been a request by many enthusiasts for years on PSP discussion channels, and it seems that the wpa2psp plugin by developer Moment now brings this to life. According to Acid_Snake, the developer was kind enough to provide the source code of the plugin, which allowed the ARK team to embed it into the ARK Custom Firmware for PSP.</p>

<h2>WPA2PSP&nbsp; limitations</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/psphacks/comments/1iimnft/wpa2_now_works_on_psp_thanks_to_a_new_plugin/">This reddit thread</a> by Nebula_NL covers a lot of details on how to install and use the plugin. But the bottom line is: install the latest release of the ARK CFW on your PSP, and take it from there. (Note that you can also manually install the plugin if you’re using another CFW than ARK)</p>
<p>This is of course the first iteration of this plugin, and it comes with limitations, specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>2.4 GHz Only
<ul>
<li>WPA2 support works with 2.4 GHz WiFi.</li>
<li>If your router uses a single SSID for both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz, you may need to separate them and connect your PSP to the 2.4 GHz network.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>WPA2 AES Only
<ul>
<li>Requires WPA2 with AES (AES-CCMP) encryption.</li>
<li>TKIP is not supported and will not work.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>WEP/WPA Compatibility
<ul>
<li>While WPA2 is active, WEP and WPA encryption will not work.</li>
<li>To use WEP or WPA again, disable WPA2, and they will function normally.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>WPA2/WPA3 Mixed Mode
<ul>
<li>If your router is set to WPA2/WPA3 mixed mode, your PSP may struggle to obtain an IP address.</li>
<li>Try manually setting the IP address instead of using DHCP in [AUTO] mode.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Download and install ARK-4 + enable WPA2 Support for the PSP</h2>
<ol>
<li>Download the <a href="https://github.com/PSP-Archive/ARK-4/releases">latest release from the ARK4 Github releases page</a>. (alternatively, <a href="https://github.com/PSP-Archive/ARK-4/releases/tag/rev160">this specific release</a> introduced the wpa2psp plugin)</li>
<li>Copy the <code>UPDATE</code> folder from the ARK4 archive to <code>/PSP/GAME/</code>.</li>
<li>Run ARK4 Updater on your PSP from the GAME menu.</li>
<li>Go to Extras &gt; Custom Firmware Settings and enable WPA2.</li>
<li>Reboot VSH/PSP and connect to your WPA2 Wifi network.</li>
<li>Done!</li>
</ol>
<p><em>* WPA2 was certified in 2004… It’s “new” from the PSP’s perspective which launched the same year and didn’t “need” to support it at the time. WPA3 launched in 2018 but its adoption is taking time</em></p>

<p><a href="https://ghuntley.com/stdlib/" title="">This bit by Geoffrey Huntley</a> is super interesting to me and, despite calling out that LLM-driven development agents like Cursor have something like a 40% success rate at actually building anything that passes acceptance criteria, makes me think that more of the future of our field belongs to people who figure out how to use this weird bags of model weights than any of us are comfortable with. </p>

<p>I’ve been dinking around with Cursor for a week now (if you haven’t, I think it’s something close to malpractice not to at least take it — or something like it — for a spin) and am just now from this post learning that Cursor has this <a href="https://docs.cursor.com/context/rules-for-ai" title="">rules feature</a>. </p>

<p>The important thing for me is not how Cursor rules work, but rather how Huntley uses them. He turns them back on themselves, writing rules to tell Cursor how to organize the rules, and then teach Cursor how to write (under human supervision) its own rules.</p>

<p>Cursor kept trying to get Huntley to use Bazel as a build system. So he had cursor write a rule for itself: “no bazel”. And there was no more Bazel. If I’d known I could do this, I probably wouldn’t have bounced from the Elixir project I had Cursor doing, where trying to get it to write simple unit tests got it all tangled up trying to make <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/mox/Mox.html" title="">Mox</a> work. </p>

<p>But I’m burying the lead. </p>

<p>Security people have been for several years now somewhat in love with a tool called <a href="https://github.com/semgrep/semgrep" title="">Semgrep</a>. Semgrep is a semantics-aware code search tool; using symbolic variable placeholders and otherwise ordinary code, you can write rules to match pretty much arbitary expressions and control flow. </p>

<p>If you’re an appsec person, where you obviously go with this is: you build a library of Semgrep searches for well-known vulnerability patterns (or, if you’re like us at Fly.io, you work out how to get Semgrep to catch the Rust concurrency footgun of RWLocks inside if-lets).</p>

<p>The reality for most teams though is “ain’t nobody got time for that”. </p>

<p>But I just checked and, unsurprisingly, 4o <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/67aa94a7-ea3c-8012-845c-6c9491b33fe4" title="">seems to do reasonably well</a> at generating Semgrep rules? Like: I have no idea if this rule is actually any good. But it looks like a Semgrep rule?</p>

<p>What interests me is this: it seems obvious that we’re going to do more and more “closed-loop” LLM agent code generation stuff. By “closed loop”, I mean that the thingy that generates code is going to get to run the code and watch what happens when it’s interacted with. You’re just a small bit of glue code and a lot of system prompting away from building something like that right now: <a href="https://x.com/chris_mccord/status/1882839014845374683" title="">Chris McCord is building</a> a thingy that generates whole Elixir/Phoenix apps and runs them as Fly Machines. When you deploy these kinds of things, the LLM gets to see the errors when the code is run, and it can just go fix them. It also gets to see errors and exceptions in the logs when you hit a page on the app, and it can just go fix them.</p>

<p>With a bit more system prompting, you can get an LLM to try to generalize out from exceptions it fixes and generate unit test coverage for them. </p>

<p>With a little bit more system prompting, you can probably get an LLM to (1) generate a Semgrep rule for the generalized bug it caught, (2) test the Semgrep rule with a positive/negative control, (3) save the rule, (4) test the whole codebase with Semgrep for that rule, and (5) fix anything it finds that way. </p>

<p>That is a lot more interesting to me than tediously (and probably badly) trying to predict everything that will go wrong in my codebase a priori and Semgrepping for them. Which is to say: Semgrep — which I have always liked — is maybe a lot more interesting now? And tools like it?</p>

				<h2>Bill Fixes Loopholes in Flawed U.S. Law Used to Demand Apple Build Backdoors for iCloud Accounts, Putting Americans’ Security at Risk</h2>
			
			<p><strong><em>Washington, D.C.</em></strong> – U.S. Senator Ron Wyden, D-Ore., today released a discussion draft of the Global Trust in American Online Services Act to secure Americans’ communications against abusive foreign demands to weaken the security of communications services and software used by Americans.</p>
<p>The bill reforms the CLOUD Act, which permits foreign governments to make surveillance demands directly of U.S. companies rather than going through the U.S. legal system.</p>
<p><strong>“Foreign governments shouldn’t get a cheat code to undermine the security of American technology,”</strong> Wyden said.<strong> “My bill would fix the loopholes in the CLOUD Act, and modernize the law so American allies can request the information they need to investigate serious crimes without sacrificing the security of Americans’ communications services.” </strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/02/07/apple-encryption-backdoor-uk/">According to news reports</a>, the United Kingdom issued a secret order to Apple last month, directing the company to weaken the encryption protecting its iCloud backup service. The U.K. was apparently able to secretly issue the order to Apple, rather than seeking assistance from the Department of Justice (DOJ) because of the CLOUD Act. Wyden and Representative Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., <a href="https://www.wyden.senate.gov/news/press-releases/wyden-and-biggs-urge-new-intel-chief-gabbard-to-protect-americans-communications-from-foreign-surveillance">urged Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard</a> to demand the U.K. withdraw its order in a letter on Thursday.</p>
<p>The CLOUD Act, enacted in 2018, enables foreign countries to obtain data directly from U.S. firms, bypassing the U.S. legal system once they enter into an agreement with the Justice Department. However, the CLOUD Act failed to require foreign countries to adopt the same due process requirements long guaranteed under U.S. law, enabling foreign governments to demand that U.S. technology companies weaken the security of products used by Americans and putting global trust in U.S. firms at risk.</p>
<p>The Global Trust in American Online Services Act addresses serious flaws in the CLOUD Act, to ensure that U.S. technology companies can continue to maintain the trust of their international customers, and that the U.S. can compete globally as a safe place for data. The legislation would:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Prevent foreign governments from using the CLOUD Act to require U.S. providers to adopt specific designs for products, reduce the security of a product, or deliver malware to a customer.</li>
<li>Allow U.S. providers to challenge foreign CLOUD Act orders in U.S. federal court.</li>
<li>Require Congressional approval of CLOUD Act agreements rather than the current disapproval mechanism, and enable oversight by requiring that each agreement sunset after five years rather than lasting indefinitely.</li>
</ul>
<p>The draft bill is available <a href="https://www.wyden.senate.gov/download/the-global-trust-in-american-online-services-actpdf">here</a>. A one-page summary of the bill is available <a href="https://www.wyden.senate.gov/download/the-global-trust-in-american-online-services-act-one-pager-2-12-2025pdf">here</a>.</p>

<p>I woke up this morning about an hour ahead of my alarm, the sky already light, birds calling.&nbsp; After a few minutes, a brief patter of rain swept across the roof and moved on.</p>

<p>I just lay there, not really thinking.&nbsp; Feeling.&nbsp; Remembering.</p>

<p>Almost sixteen years to the minute before I awoke, my second daughter was born.&nbsp; Almost ten years to the same minute before, she’d turned six years old, already semi-unconscious, and died not quite twelve hours later.</p>

<p>So she won’t be taking her first solo car drive today.&nbsp; She won’t be celebrating with dinner at her favorite restaurant in the whole world.&nbsp; She won’t kiss her niece good night or affectionately rag on her siblings.</p>

<p>Or maybe she wouldn’t have done any of those things anyway, after a decade of growth and changes and paths taken.&nbsp; What would she really be like, at sixteen?</p>

<p>We will never know.&nbsp; We can’t even guess.&nbsp; All of that, everything she might have been, is lost.</p>

<p>This afternoon, we’ll visit Rebecca’s grave, and then go to hear her name read in remembrance at one of her very happiest places, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anshe_Chesed_Fairmount_Temple">Anshe Chesed Fairmount Temple</a>, for the last time.&nbsp; At the end of the month, the temple will close as part of a merger.&nbsp; Another loss.</p>

<p>A decade ago, I said that I felt the weight of all the years she would never have, and that they might crush me.&nbsp; Over time, I have come to realize all the things she never saw or did adds to that weight.&nbsp; Even though it seems like it should be the same weight.&nbsp; Somehow, it isn’t.</p>

<p>I was talking about all of this with a therapist a few days ago, about the time and the losses and their accumulated weight.&nbsp; I said, “I don’t know how to be okay when I failed my child in the most fundamental way possible.”</p>

<p>“You didn’t fail her,” they said gently.</p>

<p>“I know that,” I replied. “But I don’t feel it.”</p>

<p>A decade, it turns out, does not change that.&nbsp; I’m not sure now that any stretch of time ever could.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The boxes came from Tokyo: first by tanker, then overland via container truck from a Pacific port, across the Continental Divide, and finally backed into a driveway at the end of a cul-de-sac in a south Denver suburban enclave. This was a neighborhood with Razor scooters dumped in trimmed front lawns. Where family walks with leashed dogs happened down the middle of intentionally curved streets named after long demolished natural landmarks like "Timbercrest" and "Forest Trails." Where the HOA (because of course there was an HOA) banned the installation of driveway basketball hoops.</p><p>Receiving industrial freight deliveries, freshly cleared through international customs, probably wasn't explicitly prohibited in the homeowner's handbook. But then, why would it need to be? Nobody would think to bring that kind of commercial chaos into the burgeoning middle-class peace of Castle Pines North in 1998.</p><p>If neighbors peeking behind curtains at the idling 18-wheeler thought to call in a complaint, the husband and wife receiving the delivery didn't notice. They were too busy unloading boxes—more than 800 of them.&nbsp;</p><p>Balancing four at a time on a handcart, it took 200 trips through the open garage door and down the unfinished basement steps. The boxes, holding smaller rectangular packages inscribed with Japanese lettering, were piled to the ceiling. There was enough room left for a skinny aisle leading back up the stairs, and two plastic tables ladened with tape and flat-rate USPS packaging.&nbsp;</p><p>5,800 miles away, a man in middle management at the global toy conglomerate Hasbro must have been very pleased. The delivery represented a small yet unexpected boon.&nbsp;</p><p>Those boxes were dead inventory, wasting space in a nondescript warehouse. They should have been headed for a landfill and a tax write-off. Instead, a Mr. Toshio Takiguchi brokered the export at a ¥1,300 per-unit cost. Not a tidy profit, but no longer a loss on the annual P&amp;L. The remains of a failed business decision disappeared across the ocean. It was a certain Mr. Fox's problem now.</p><p>That problem cost $43,000, a sum that represented the entire life savings of Mr. Fox and his wife, who at that point had been surviving on public-school salaries. Friends and family never really said it out loud, but they were certainly thinking it: <em>This was insane. What about the three kids and that mortgage?&nbsp;</em></p><p>The couple, though, never had a doubt.&nbsp;</p><p>"He always used to tell me, 'If I had 10,000 of these, I could sell them in a year,'" Mrs. Fox&nbsp;recalled, 27 years later.</p><p>That's the unabashed confidence you'd expect from any good entrepreneur, especially with the benefit of hindsight. But ask yourself this: Would you, watching this couple unload box after box into their bank-financed home, have bet on this man and his family's future if you knew exactly what he needed to sell?</p><p>Tucked inside those boxes, in nested columns of 12, were 120,000 plastic cups. They were turned upside down, each with a hole drilled through the middle of the base, rendering them useless in terms of a cup's normal, and really only, task.</p><p>The couple's future hinged on accomplishing what the world's second largest toy company could not: convincing thousands of kids that stacking these plastic cups in pre-determined patterns was … <em>fun</em>. More critically, the couple needed to convince the parents of those kids to actually buy these cups, despite not even being able to drink from them.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr. Takiguchi could breathe a sigh of relief. Mr. and Mrs. Fox had to get to work.</p><hr><div><figure><img src="https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/02/divider.png?w=710" alt="Three speed stacking cups in a row"></figure><div><blockquote><p><strong><em>The first thing you need to know about Bob Fox is that he used to be a clown</em></strong> ... <em><strong>The second thing you need to know about my dad is that he was a really, really good clown.&nbsp;</strong></em></p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote></div></div><hr><p>Every few months, in different corners of the internet, someone asks a version of the same question: <em>Why did we all stack plastic cups in elementary school PE class?</em></p><p>You'll see it multiple times in the Reddit community<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Zillennials/comments/qmx0jx/anyone_else_remember_cup_speed_stacking/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> r/Zillenials,</a> or infrequently posted as a random musing on <a href="https://x.com/lincolnwjohnson/status/1129999148567019520" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a> and Facebook.

It has appeared on pretty much every morning and late show, been a trend piece in both the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/01/sports/sport-stacking-speed-cups.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>New York Times</em></a> and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124044351073445491" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Wall Street Journal</em></a>, and was once labeled by Glenn Beck as "<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/story/glenn-beck-why-health-care-reform-is-like-cup-stacking" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">what’s really wrong with America</a>."</p><p>It has been a minor plot line in <em>Fred Claus</em>, Matt LeBlanc's <em>Episodes</em>, and <em>Weeds</em>; it's been the major plot line in a 2022 Thai-language film released on Netflix titled <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt18357588/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Fast &amp; Feel Love</em></a> (100 percent on Rotten Tomatoes). The infamous "Oh my gosh!" scream in Skrillex's "Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites" was sampled from a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j54yGxuk0yo&amp;t=1s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">viral sport stacking video</a> from 2008.</p><p>At its peak, between 2002 and 2011, roughly 5,000 American schools included it as part of their annual curriculum, according to Mr. and Mrs. Fox. That means somewhere between five and eight percent of U.S. adults between the ages of 22 and 35 share the same core memory—and in the ensuing years have asked themselves, their friends, or social media the same question: <em>Why did credentialed educational professionals make us do this ludicrous activity in gym class?</em></p><p>I am, perhaps, the person best suited on the planet to answer this question.&nbsp;Because the answer … is my dad.</p><p>The first thing you need to know about Bob Fox is that he used to be a clown. Not in the figurative, funnyman personality sense. In the literal red-nose, black-eyeliner, juggling-tennis-balls-at-children’s-birthday-parties sense.</p><p>The second thing you need to know about my dad is that he was a <em>really, really good clown</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>He'd scoff at the mental image you probably have of him right now: oversized shoes, cartoonish honks, and bumbling choreography. My dad's act was entirely silent, required immense skill, and was predicated on audience participation. He was equally good at riding a unicycle and convincing the most curmudgeonly dad in the room to leave their back corner and join him onstage to try—and always fail—at blowing up a balloon animal. Kids went bananas. Adults always laughed.&nbsp;</p><p>The San Francisco 49ers hired him to be the walk-around entertainment for their post–Super Bowl ring ceremony in 1995. We used to shut the shades so neighbors didn't think he robbed a bank as he counted the cash he earned during Denver's largest busking festival.</p><p>This was a man who took the unserious very, very seriously.&nbsp;</p><p>As a high school theater teacher, he'd spend 60–80 hours a week building out increasingly elaborate sets for the annual musical. He built a life-sized plant puppet that could actually eat cast members for <em>Little Shop of Horrors</em>, and cut a full-sized muscle car in half so it would fit on stage during <em>Grease</em>; another car was hoisted onto the school's roof to promote the show. Before her bevy of Oscar nominations, Amy Adams was one of his choreographers and students.</p><p>He quit because his wife, Jill, needed him home more to help raise their three children. So he became an elementary school classroom and PE teacher instead, where he would end up teaching hundreds of kids how to ride unicycles and produce an annual show on the blacktop basketball court called KidZircus.</p><p>The first thing you need to know about Jill Fox is that before working as a communications administrator at a school district, she used to be a journalist at a small newspaper, where she was assigned to write a profile about a local clown on "sabbatical" from his full-time job.&nbsp;</p><p>The second thing you need to know about Jill Fox is that despite the word "sabbatical" doing a generous amount of euphemistic work in her final published piece, she married that unemployed clown.</p><p>This was a woman who was very, very good at seeing—and supporting—the potential in the crazy.</p><hr><div><figure><img src="https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/02/divider.png?w=710" alt="Three speed stacking cups in a row"></figure><div><blockquote><p><strong><em>They had to figure out how to tap into the supply chain of global toy conglomerates. Fortunately, they had a guy: Uncle Johnny.</em></strong></p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote></div></div><hr><p>It took them 10 months to sell the 10,000 sets of 12 cups.&nbsp;</p><p>Kids in south Denver, it turns out, went absolutely nuts over this new phenomenon called "cup stacking." That's mostly because my dad figured out the one thing Hasbro did not: The level of interest in the activity hinged almost exclusively on the enthusiasm and skill level of a real-life teacher. Without that, it was just inanimate plastic ephemera sitting on a shelf.</p><p>The basic rules take about 15 minutes to learn. Like a track meet, the sport is built on completing different "distances" as fast as you can. The shortest, and simplest, is called the 3-3-3. Envision each one of those 3's as a nested column of cups. You start on one side and "upstack" the first 3 into a pyramid, then move to the middle, and then the last 3. Then you return to where you started, and "downstack" them back into columns in the same order. The 3-6-3 has the same principle, but with a pyramid of six cups in the middle. The "Cycle," is the sport's primetime event, starting with the 3-6-3, morphing into a 6-6, and ending with a 1-10-1.</p><p>If you skimmed over that clunky paragraph, you've proved my dad's foundational epiphany: You really need to see it to buy in. In fact, scrap reading this for a few seconds (that's all it will take) and watch this video instead.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Fastest Cup Stacker Sets New World Record | Cup Stacking" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VyyscuIq56I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Place a set of these cups in the corner of a room or on a toy shelf with paper instructions, and you might earn five minutes of an 8-year-old's frenzied attention. Put that same 8-year-old on the gym floor in front of a professionally trained clown with a passion for juggling, and they will be utterly hooked.</p><figure><img alt="Three speed stacking cups in a row" src="https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/02/divider.png?w=710" srcset="https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/02/divider.png?w=425&amp;quality=75 425w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/02/divider.png?w=850&amp;quality=75 850w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/02/divider.png?w=585&amp;quality=75 585w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/02/divider.png?w=1170&amp;quality=75 1170w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/02/divider.png?w=710&amp;quality=75 710w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/02/divider.png?w=1420&amp;quality=75 1420w" sizes="(max-width: 30rem) 425px, (min-width: 30rem) and (max-width: 40rem) 585px, (min-width: 40rem) 710px" loading="lazy"></figure><p>A brief digression on nomenclature: The sport was known as "cup stacking" until 2005, when my parents had the savvy to officially change the name to "sport stacking." Why? 1) Because it sounds way cooler, and if enough people call it a sport then it must damn well be one. 2) The phrase "cup stacking" out of context evokes toddlers playing with blocks, a vibe they wanted to avoid. Confusingly, you might have also seen it referenced as "speed stacking," after the company they eventually founded, Speed Stacks. They strategically eschewed this label to avoid the fate of Roller Blades, Frisbee, and Kleenex, all formerly good standing trademarks, until you lot ruined everything. </p><p>Except for this early-stage reference, I'll be calling it sport stacking hereafter so as to avoid a grumpy phone call from my dad (he'll probably still call about my use of "damn," though). If you have a problem with that, consider the last time you went berserk over a nine-darter or screamed at the Swedish curling team during the Olympics. As my dad likes to say, there used to be a man trying to convince the world that tossing balls made from dried cow skin into retrofitted peach baskets was fun—and you all bought in.</p><figure><img alt="Three speed stacking cups in a row" src="https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/02/divider.png?w=710" srcset="https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/02/divider.png?w=425&amp;quality=75 425w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/02/divider.png?w=850&amp;quality=75 850w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/02/divider.png?w=585&amp;quality=75 585w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/02/divider.png?w=1170&amp;quality=75 1170w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/02/divider.png?w=710&amp;quality=75 710w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/02/divider.png?w=1420&amp;quality=75 1420w" sizes="(max-width: 30rem) 425px, (min-width: 30rem) and (max-width: 40rem) 585px, (min-width: 40rem) 710px" loading="lazy"></figure><p>It is important to note that my dad did not actually invent sport stacking. Credit goes to a group of bored kids at a Boys and Girls Club in Oceanside, Calif., in the early 1980s. They'd been given a stack of paper cups, and told to figure out a game that didn't involve messy liquid. Under the guidance of a program director named Wayne Godinet, both the rules and equipment evolved. He is responsible for the sport's first major innovation: He drilled a hole through the base of hard plastic cups to reduce air friction and prevent sticking. The California group's high-water mark came on Nov. 2, 1990, when they appeared on <em>The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson</em>. Among the millions watching that night, from his bed in a south Denver suburb: a clown and future PE teacher who thought it looked a bit like upside-down juggling.</p><p>Hasbro must have been watching, too. Perhaps chasing the Hoola Hoop and Pogs high of the '80s, the company scooped up a license to sell "Kup Stax," popping sets in a rectangular plastic sleeve on toy store shelves around the world. Instead of becoming a fad, the product moved to the clearance rack. Someone in middle management was probably scolded. Manufacturing ceased.&nbsp;</p><p>In 1995, my dad attended a physical education development workshop to give new teachers a dozen ideas on how to keep kids occupied, exercised, and docile. The classics were all there: four-wheeled square scooters designed to give 80 percent of users elbow burn, dodgeballs primed to pop kids like me in the face, that large circus tent you toss above your head until it temporarily inflates so you can sit under it for a few seconds. So were the cups.&nbsp;</p><p>He brought them home and taught his kids. I was 4, my brother 6, our sister 9. We not only fell in love with them, we got good—<em>fast</em>. We weren't outliers. Among an elementary school of 500 students, 250 signed up for an afterschool program to keep stacking. My mom drove to every Toys "R" Us and Walmart within a 50-mile radius. She bought every set of Kup Stax she could find. They were always discounted, tucked in a back corner.</p><p>The local supply ran dry as my parents hosted workshops. Demand started to skyrocket from other PE teachers. My parents needed to go upstream. They had to figure out how to tap into the supply chain of global toy conglomerates. Fortunately, they had a guy: <em>Uncle Johnny</em>.</p><p>Now 64 with a Colonel Sanders goatee and passion for intricate leather carving, my dad's brother has been at certain points in his life: a professor at the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Clown College; a street mime in San Diego; a director of&nbsp;a Las Vegas magic show, performed entirely on ice; and a consultant for Japan's oldest and largest circus. If you need to find a man in middle management at Hasbro's Tokyo corporate office, you call Uncle Johnny.</p><p>The deal was struck. The shipment arrived. And the cups, rather magically, disappeared from our basement.</p><p>By 1998, Bob Fox was a dealer with no product and an increasingly addicted customer base. There was only one logical next step: Transition from distribution to fabrication.</p><p>He did make a final good-faith effort to partner with the sport's originator, Wayne Godinet, offering to purchase $20,000 worth of product. It was almost a third of the profit earned from reselling the Japanese shipment. Godinet sent back two sample sets with a bill for the cost of goods and shipping.</p><p>In a similar vein, Nike was founded in 1964 only after a running shoe company called Onitsuka lost interest in partnering with a recent Oregon track grad named Phil Knight. While his shoe empire was born between the grooves of a waffle iron, Bob and Jill's cup empire was sketched on the back of a Fresh Fish Co. paper placemat.</p><p>Speed Stacks LLC was incorporated in December 1998. My parents quit their full-time public school jobs in June 2000.&nbsp;</p><p>This was to be an official test of a core tenet of the American Dream: With enough passion and even more prodigious work ethic, you can turn a ludicrous idea into a successful business. To get started, they just needed four things.</p><p>First: a mold to mass produce the cups. It required $20,000 and overcoming the absolute befuddlement of executives at a Denver plastics manufacturer who did not understand the <em>explicit request</em> to include three small holes at the base. As each cup came off the line, our family would inspect the shape; minor defects in its roundness caused sticking. Nearly every cup in the first run had to be tossed out for deformities.</p><p>Second: a nylon and mesh cup-carrying bag. Those were sewn in the back basement of a Vietnamese immigrant–owned textile company. We bagged each set of 12 by hand, my parents staying up until 2:00 in the morning to fulfill orders after working full school days. Bob wasn't satisfied unless the logo of every cup perfectly faced forward.</p><p>Third: to hit the road. Speed Stack's first tagline was "See it! Believe it! Teach it!" My parents meant it: They knew that success was linearly related to the number of PE teachers who witnessed the sport in person. Our family of five put almost 100,000 miles on our 1997 maroon Suburban in a little over four years.</p><p>Fourth: kids who could stack the cups. <em>Outrageously fast</em>. For some reason, all three of the Fox progeny developed both the interest and intrinsic skill to do just that.</p><hr><div><figure><img src="https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/02/divider.png?w=710" alt="Three speed stacking cups in a row"></figure><div><blockquote><p><strong><em>At a booth in hotel conference halls and city convention centers, we'd stack for hours, drawing crowds spread three and four rows deep, often to the annoyance of the dodgeball or shuttlecock purveyors next door.&nbsp;</em></strong></p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote></div></div><hr><p>Legendary ring announcer Michael Buffer’s voice was always our music cue. <em>"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the main event!"</em>&nbsp;</p><p>It would blast over portable speakers on either side of a gym floor. Emmy, my older sister, would lead us out from a hidden corner, followed by my brother, Brennan, then me: a 7-year-old with Coke-bottle glasses, immensely satisfied by the fact that hundreds of eyes were watching my every move.</p><p>We stopped when we reached separate tables spread evenly across our makeshift stage, usually under the basketball hoop. We stood still to let the tempo build.&nbsp;</p><p><em>"Let’s get ready to rumble!"</em></p><p>The synths would drop, and we would commence stacking plastic cups. Faster and with more skill than the students and teachers in Amarillo or Ft. Lauderdale or Butzbach, Germany, or Copenhagen, Denmark, could ever think possible.&nbsp;</p><p>Our family performed hundreds of school assemblies in almost every corner of the country (and some overseas). The 30-minute spectacle was choreographed specifically to blow the minds of kids between the ages of 7 and 14 as quickly as possible. This wasn't a talk from your fire chief about safety, or puppets teaching you the value of sharing. We humiliated principals and popular teachers by making them race us. There was a fabricated jacket with holes cut in the back that we fitted onto a volunteer, then stuck our arms through the sleeves to make it appear like they were magically adept (performed to the <em>Rocky</em> soundtrack). The finale was a choreographed stacking routine, set to "Dueling Banjos" from <em>Deliverance</em>.</p><p>But a school-by-school roadshow wasn't a scalable business model. So we went to the nexus of physical education sweatsuitdom: state and national teacher conventions. At a booth in hotel conference halls and city convention centers, we'd stack for hours, drawing crowds spread three and four rows deep, often to the annoyance of the dodgeball or shuttlecock purveyors next door.&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt="The author stacking cups as a child." src="https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/02/Kit-1996.jpeg?w=320" srcset="https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/02/Kit-1996.jpeg?w=425&amp;quality=75 425w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/02/Kit-1996.jpeg?w=850&amp;quality=75 850w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/02/Kit-1996.jpeg?w=585&amp;quality=75 585w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/02/Kit-1996.jpeg?w=1170&amp;quality=75 1170w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/02/Kit-1996.jpeg?w=710&amp;quality=75 710w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/02/Kit-1996.jpeg?w=1420&amp;quality=75 1420w" sizes="(max-width: 30rem) 425px, (min-width: 30rem) and (max-width: 40rem) 585px, (min-width: 40rem) 710px" loading="lazy"><figcaption><span>The author stacking cups as a child</span><span></span><span>Kit Fox/Defector</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's most likely that you learned how to sport stack because your teacher, with a lanyard badge bouncing over her multi-colored windbreaker on her way to get a free muffin from the guys who sell tug-o-war ropes, stopped in her tracks in the back corner of Exhibit Hall B at an exurban Renaissance hotel. She would watch as our hands manipulated dishware so fast it blurred.</p><p>If my dad was adept at putting on a good show, my mom was equally adept at corralling the press. Her journalism and PR–honed chops put sport stacking in front of millions, from the D-block of local newscasts to 30 Rock Plaza during the <em>Today Show</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>That's how I found myself chatting with a shirtless Simon Cowell in the makeup room before we both appeared on Ellen DeGeneres's show, taught Tiki Barber the basics of the 3-3-3, and tried to convince a baffled Michael Caine in the green room of <em>LIVE with Regis and Kelly</em> that yes, indeed, kids really do stack plastic cups for fun.</p><p>All press, to my parents, was good. My dad was absolutely thrilled when Glenn Beck spent four minutes of his daily Fox News monologue staring directly into the camera, railing against the dangers of stacking cups.</p><p>"We can't fix our country by keeping our children weak," Beck sputtered, roughly two minutes in. "They need to have spines. They need to get hit in the face a few times with a ball, you know what I mean? They have to learn how to live with and thrive on past failures."</p><p>Brands soon took advantage of sport stacking's essential power: No matter the context, it attracts near-instant attention. In 2005, I appeared in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/clip/UgkxwybLaGciSxQJgS1FKh-3PeJwa9xtXtN8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nationwide Comcast commercial</a> for high speed internet. FritoLay shut down part of Times Square to feature our stacking talents as it launched Stax, a competitor to Pringles. A beverage company in England flew a dozen of us to London to help launch an abomination of a drink called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eelE8tHEScM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Freekee Soda</a>. Main ingredient? Carbonated milk. (Did I pretend to enjoy drinking that carbonated milk so as to not piss off any of the execs helping to pay for my college education? Obviously. But it is a cursed flavor.)</p><p>Perhaps the only media my parents turned down was an appearance on the infamous reality show <em>Wife Swap</em>. The producers, naturally, presumed the scions of a ludicrous gym activity would have some weird baggage to mine for the masses.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, despite the cups, we were pretty normal.</p><hr><div><figure><img src="https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/02/divider.png?w=710" alt="Three speed stacking cups in a row"></figure><div><blockquote><p><strong><em>To stack as fast as you possibly can in a World Championship is to strike a balance between fluidity and chaos.</em></strong></p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote></div></div><hr><p>It was the Germans who made everything more serious.</p><p>They arrived at the 2004 World Sport Stacking Championships in matching flag-inspired sweatsuits. Multiple coaches would analyze everything from hand-tag efficiency during the four-person relay event to the mental routines of stackers before their individual competition.</p><p>Sport stacking, I believe, grew into a minor phenomenon for three reasons: 1) It's visually arresting, 2) it's easy to learn, and 3) competing against the clock is incredibly addicting.</p><p>Media buzz and schoolteachers kindled the first two. But my dad's magnum opus—the reason the sport didn't wither in the way of skip ball and snake boards—was that he (with the help of the 20 employees at the burgeoning HQ) built the infrastructure and equipment to spur global competition.&nbsp;</p><p>The sport's growth coincided with two of my dad's innovations: the StackMat, a patented self-timing device that allowed kids to practice on their own for hours, aiming to trim hundredths of a second off their best times; and the World Sport Stacking Association, a governing body to codify the rules and serve as the keeper of world, national, and local records.</p><p>In 1997, 250 kids were hand-timed with stop watches at the first Colorado State Championship.&nbsp;By 2007, ESPN aired an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xm8EKnl4ZDQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hourlong David Lloyd–hosted special</a> of the World Championships, featuring more than 1,000 competitors from seven countries (re-aired in 2020 during their pandemic "The Ocho" promotion).&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt="Stackers compete at the World Speed Stacking Championships" src="https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/02/Stack-of-Champions.jpeg?w=640" srcset="https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/02/Stack-of-Champions.jpeg?w=425&amp;quality=75 425w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/02/Stack-of-Champions.jpeg?w=850&amp;quality=75 850w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/02/Stack-of-Champions.jpeg?w=585&amp;quality=75 585w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/02/Stack-of-Champions.jpeg?w=1170&amp;quality=75 1170w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/02/Stack-of-Champions.jpeg?w=710&amp;quality=75 710w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/02/Stack-of-Champions.jpeg?w=1420&amp;quality=75 1420w" sizes="(max-width: 30rem) 425px, (min-width: 30rem) and (max-width: 40rem) 585px, (min-width: 40rem) 710px" loading="lazy"><figcaption><span>Stackers compete at the World Speed Stacking Championships</span><span></span><span>Kit Fox/Defector</span></figcaption></figure><p>Like everything in his life, my dad choreographed a spectacle. He ordered a three-story banner to hang behind garbage can–sized cups that served as center stage. The competition floor was arranged with dozens of tables, all marked with laser-lined tape to demarcate relay boundaries.</p><p>During the final "Stack of Champions," the top competitors (and relay teams) from each event competed under the scrutiny of spotlights, three officials, an instant replay camera, and hundreds of spectators. In individual events, you're allotted two warmups and three tries. Relays are conducted head-to-head in teams of four.</p><p>For a few years, I was among those finalists.&nbsp;</p><p>To stack as fast as you possibly can in a World Championship is to strike a balance between fluidity and chaos. Push too hard and the cups tumble. Pull back and you'll lose by thousandths of a second.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="World Sport Stacking Championships 2007" width="710" height="533" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Yxokrklbcdw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>A relay race in the Stack of Champions, in which I (the third stacker on the left team) stumble at the start, allowing my brother (the last stacker on the right team) to beat us by two-hundredths of a second.</figcaption></figure></div><p>For those moments, you exist at the outer physical boundary of human biology. When performing at your peak, the cups feel less like they're being stacked and more like they're being sprayed.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2001, the world record for sport stacking's marquee event, the Cycle, was 7.43 seconds. It was held by my sister. At the time, most people assumed a sub-seven-second time was physically impossible. The pattern requires more than 40 separate moves. At those speeds, hands make micro-adjustments faster than the brain can register. Her time stood for nearly four years.</p><p>In 2025, the world record for the cycle is 4.739 seconds.&nbsp;</p><p>Please understand: I know this whole endeavor is silly, that it's worthy of your slight mockery and general patina of confusion. But also understand that my dad created a culture in which German coaches passed strategic tips to Australian competitors. Where Japanese teenagers became pen pals with suburban Texans. Where nerves collapsed faster than the cups. Where kids and adults shrieked with joy over millisecond improvements. Where tension and drama and friendship mingled with the clattering cacophony of sliding and tapping plastic (there really is no sound like the one at these competitions).&nbsp;</p><p>Sport stacking had broad exposure in both mainstream and weird places. But it had a deep impact in a much smaller community. It changed lives.</p><hr><div><figure><img src="https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/02/divider.png?w=710" alt="Three speed stacking cups in a row"></figure><div><blockquote><p><strong><em>You've probably heard Rachael’s voice. Her effusive reaction on a stacking YouTube video meant for her small group of friends is behind the iconic "YES, OH MY GOSH!" scream, sampled in one of EDM's most mainstream hits, "Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites," by Skrillex.</em></strong></p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote></div></div><hr><p>Milo Ferguson discovered sport stacking in first-grade PE class.&nbsp;</p><p>"My teacher was the final boss of butch lesbians. That's the only way I know how to describe her," Ferguson, now a 23-year-old co-founder of an independent animation studio, said. Their teacher loved competition and was beloved by her students, exactly the archetype to stop at a conference booth and believe in a quirky new cup-centric educational trend.</p><p>Rachael Nedrow, now a 29-year-old product manager at Amazon, first saw the sport while scrolling YouTube when she was 11. She pulled paper cups from the kitchen drawer to try and mimic the movement.</p><p>Both became obsessed, quickly. Though for different reasons.</p><p>"I was never the fastest kid. I was always kind of chubby. I was much more the creative person than an athletic one," Ferguson said. "Sport stacking was about hand-eye coordination more than strength. It was intricate. Delicate." For the first time, they were excited to attend PE class.</p><p>Nedrow, an accomplished tennis player, was intrigued by the self-improvement and rigid strictures of the clock. She bought an official set of Speed Stacks and started logging her progress on her own YouTube channel.</p><p>"My first competition was at a local church," Nedrow said. "I did terribly, but I still won."</p><p>Despite differing motivations, Ferguson and Nedrow's paths to competitive sport stacking mirror each other. Friends weren't interested, so they went looking for a community online and at competitions.&nbsp;</p><p>For the thousand kids that congregated on the arena floor at each World Championships, like Ferguson and Nedrow, the sentiment was common. They had found <em>their</em> people. They fit in, sometimes for the first time in their life.&nbsp;</p><p>There were future college athletes and kids with autism. There were rugby fans from New Zealand (riffing off their national team, they called themselves the "All Stacks") and South Koreans who had never been to the United States.&nbsp;</p><p>Roll your eyes, but my dad loved to say that the sport only helped build "positive pyramids." Spend a few hours watching kids pat each other on the back after a fumbled cup, or earn a hug for achieving a new personal best, and you'd buy into the platitude too.</p><p>Compared to other top-level stackers, Nedrow and Ferguson's experiences only differ in one way.&nbsp;</p><p>You've probably heard Rachael's voice. Her effusive reaction on a stacking YouTube video meant for her small group of friends is behind the iconic "YES, OH MY GOSH!" scream, sampled in one of EDM's most mainstream hits, "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSeNSzJ2-Jw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites</a>," by Skrillex. Between Spotify and YouTube, it has more than 500 million streams.</p><p>And you probably know Ferguson's dad, Craig, the comedian and host of <em>The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson</em> from 2005 to 2014.</p><p>Nedrow's collision with virality gave her backstage passes to several Skrillex concerts and the greatest fodder for "Two Truths and a Lie" of all time. But sport stacking also gave her something else she wasn’t expecting: a wide group of online friends.</p><p>"I don't think I would have taken stacking so far if it wasn't for the online community," Nedrow said. "When you are doing anything kind of competitive, it seems like it's much better when you are doing it with people. I really loved the aspect of kids commenting on my videos, saying they started stacking because of me. What greater pleasure can you get than inspiring other people to do what you love the most?"</p><p>Sport stacking gave Ferguson inclusion and validation. But perhaps more important than what it gave them is what it gave their parents. While Craig and his ex-wife Sascha had been separated for a few years by the time their kid started competing, both fully committed to supporting this weird, wholesome obsession. Sascha helped Milo learn how to breathe and center themselves before starting to stack. And she supplied an ever-growing collection of stacking equipment, stored in a dedicated room in their Southern California home.</p><p>To see what sport stacking gave Craig, you need to watch his show <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Wjk0PkpWco" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">from April 20, 2009</a>. He spends four minutes—more than half of the entire monologue—bragging about Milo. Beneath the scripted jokes and of-the-era references (Octomom is mentioned twice), you see a guy just genuinely proud of his kid. He's like any neighbor, going off a bit too effusively about the weekend's peewee football game or math test.&nbsp;</p><p>Except this was done for millions. And it was about ... cups.&nbsp;</p><hr><div><figure><img src="https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/02/divider.png?w=710" alt="Three speed stacking cups in a row"></figure><div><blockquote><p><strong><em>"I wanted to give kids, no matter their athletic ability, the opportunity for success.

It brought kids around the world together."</em></strong></p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote></div></div><hr><p>Sport stacking gave different things to a lot of people.</p><p>For a few, it genuinely improved their life. College funds were paid through YouTube viewership revenue and small brand endorsements. Children with autism and special needs learned, practiced, competed, and socialized with others for the first time.&nbsp;</p><p>For me and my siblings, it gave us a stable home, trips to a dozen countries, and some excellent college essay material. My sister, Emmy, went on to play basketball for four years at the University of Minnesota, was drafted into the WNBA by the Minnesota Lynx, and then played professionally overseas with Sheryl Swoopes. My brother Brennan played D-III college football and turned into a mechanical engineer at a global cosmetics company. I turned into a fairly unathletic writer.</p><figure><img alt="The Fox family" src="https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/02/unnamed-4.jpg?w=240" srcset="https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/02/unnamed-4.jpg?w=425&amp;quality=75 425w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/02/unnamed-4.jpg?w=850&amp;quality=75 850w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/02/unnamed-4.jpg?w=585&amp;quality=75 585w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/02/unnamed-4.jpg?w=1170&amp;quality=75 1170w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/02/unnamed-4.jpg?w=710&amp;quality=75 710w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/02/unnamed-4.jpg?w=1420&amp;quality=75 1420w" sizes="(max-width: 30rem) 425px, (min-width: 30rem) and (max-width: 40rem) 585px, (min-width: 40rem) 710px" loading="lazy"><figcaption><span>The Fox family</span><span></span><span>Kit Fox/Defector</span></figcaption></figure><p>For my parents, it gave them an early retirement. A sometimes-operational 1957 VW Bug and an obsession with growing ever-larger pumpkins occupied my dad, while training to run another marathon at age 70 became a focus for my mom. They left their active roles at Speed Stacks in 2015, leaving control to some of its earliest employees. Programs are still active in thousands of schools around the world.</p><p>"I was motivated to spread sport stacking for the same reason I taught my students how to juggle or unicycle," my dad recalled, nearly 10 years into retirement. "I wanted to give kids, no matter their athletic ability, the opportunity for success. It gave them something new and different. And it created a community. It brought kids around the world together. And believe it or not, that all happened because of a couple million plastic cups."</p><p>For some of you reading this, sport stacking gave you an identical memory.&nbsp;A cross-legged seat on a linoleum gym floor. The hush from the principal. The music crescendoing into <em>Jock Jams</em>' most iconic synth riff. The sound of cups, stacking at lightning speed. You knew, in that moment, that you weren't in for another monotonous few hours at school. Your day was about to rock.&nbsp;</p><p>For that, you can thank my dad.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></description>

          <p>We’re building a public cloud, on hardware we own. We raised money to do that, and to place some bets; one of them: GPU-enabling our customers. A progress report: GPUs aren’t going anywhere, but: GPUs aren’t going anywhere.</p>
<p>A couple years back, <a href="https://fly.io/gpu">we put a bunch of chips down</a> on the bet that people shipping apps to users on the Internet would want GPUs, so they could do AI/ML inference tasks. To make that happen, we created <a href="https://fly.io/docs/gpus/getting-started-gpus/">Fly GPU Machines</a>.</p>

<p>A Fly Machine is a <a href="https://fly.io/blog/docker-without-docker/">Docker/OCI container</a> running inside a hardware-virtualized virtual machine somewhere on our global fleet of bare-metal worker servers. A GPU Machine is a Fly Machine with a hardware-mapped Nvidia GPU. It’s a Fly Machine that can do fast CUDA.</p>

<p>Like everybody else in our industry, we were right about the importance of AI/ML. If anything, we underestimated its importance. But the product we came up with probably doesn’t fit the moment. It’s a bet that doesn’t feel like it’s paying off.</p>

<p><strong>If you’re using Fly GPU Machines, don’t freak out; we’re not getting rid of them.</strong> But if you’re waiting for us to do something bigger with them, a v2 of the product, you’ll probably be waiting awhile.</p>
<h3 id="what-it-took"><a href="#what-it-took" aria-label="Anchor"></a><span>What It Took</span></h3>
<p>GPU Machines were not a small project for us. Fly Machines run on an idiosyncratically small hypervisor (normally Firecracker, but for GPU Machines <a href="https://github.com/cloud-hypervisor/cloud-hypervisor">Intel’s Cloud Hypervisor</a>, a very similar Rust codebase that supports PCI passthrough). The Nvidia ecosystem is not geared to supporting micro-VM hypervisors.</p>

<p>GPUs <a href="https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2020/09/attacking-qualcomm-adreno-gpu.html">terrified our security team</a>. A GPU is just about the worst case hardware peripheral: intense multi-directional direct memory transfers</p>
<p>(not even bidirectional: in common configurations, GPUs talk to each other)</p>
<p>with arbitrary, end-user controlled computation, all operating outside our normal security boundary.</p>

<p>We did a couple expensive things to mitigate the risk. We shipped GPUs on dedicated server hardware, so that GPU- and non-GPU workloads weren’t mixed. Because of that, the only reason for a Fly Machine to be scheduled on a GPU machine was that it needed a PCI BDF for an Nvidia GPU, and there’s a limited number of those available on any box. Those GPU servers were drastically less utilized and thus less cost-effective than our ordinary servers.</p>

<p>We funded two very large security assessments, from <a href="https://www.atredis.com/">Atredis</a> and <a href="https://tetrelsec.com/">Tetrel</a>, to evaluate our GPU deployment. Matt Braun is writing up those assessments now. They were not cheap, and they took time.</p>

<p>Security wasn’t directly the biggest cost we had to deal with, but it was an indirect cause for a subtle reason.</p>

<p>We could have shipped GPUs very quickly by doing what Nvidia recommended: standing up a standard K8s cluster to schedule GPU jobs on. Had we taken that path, and let our GPU users share a single Linux kernel, we’d have been on Nvidia’s driver happy-path.</p>

<p>Alternatively, we could have used a conventional hypervisor. Nvidia suggested VMware (heh). But they could have gotten things working had we used QEMU. We like QEMU fine, and could have talked ourselves into a security story for it, but the whole point of Fly Machines is that they take milliseconds to start. We could not have offered our desired Developer Experience on the Nvidia happy-path.</p>

<p>Instead, we burned months trying (and ultimately failing) to get Nvidia’s host drivers working to map <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/virtual-solutions/">virtualized GPUs</a> into Intel Cloud Hypervisor. At one point, we hex-edited the closed-source drivers to trick them into thinking our hypervisor was QEMU.</p>

<p>I’m not sure any of this really mattered in the end. There’s a segment of the market we weren’t ever really able to explore because Nvidia’s driver support kept us from thin-slicing GPUs. We’d have been able to put together a really cheap offering for developers if we hadn’t run up against that, and developers love “cheap”, but I can’t prove that those customers are real.</p>

<p>On the other hand, we’re committed to delivering the Fly Machine DX for GPU workloads. Beyond the PCI/IOMMU drama, just getting an entire hardware GPU working in a Fly Machine was a lift. We needed Fly Machines that would come up with the right Nvidia drivers; our stack was built assuming that the customer’s OCI container almost entirely defined the root filesystem for a Machine. We had to engineer around that in our <code>flyd</code> orchestrator. And almost everything people want to do with GPUs involves efficiently grabbing huge files full of model weights. Also annoying!</p>

<p>And, of course, we bought GPUs. A lot of GPUs. Expensive GPUs.</p>
<h3 id="why-it-isnt-working"><a href="#why-it-isnt-working" aria-label="Anchor"></a><span>Why It Isn’t Working</span></h3>
<p>The biggest problem: developers don’t want GPUs. They don’t even want AI/ML models. They want LLMs. <em>System engineers</em> may have smart, fussy opinions on how to get their models loaded with CUDA, and what the best GPU is. But <em>software developers</em> don’t care about any of that. When a software developer shipping an app comes looking for a way for their app to deliver prompts to an LLM, you can’t just give them a GPU.</p>

<p>For those developers, who probably make up most of the market, it doesn’t seem plausible for an insurgent public cloud to compete with OpenAI and Anthropic. Their APIs are fast enough, and developers thinking about performance in terms of “tokens per second” aren’t counting milliseconds.</p>
<p>(you should all feel sympathy for us)</p>
<p>This makes us sad because we really like the point in the solution space we found. Developers shipping apps on Amazon will outsource to other public clouds to get cost-effective access to GPUs. But then they’ll faceplant trying to handle data and model weights, backhauling gigabytes (at significant expense) from S3. We have app servers, GPUs, and object storage all under the same top-of-rack switch. But inference latency just doesn’t seem to matter yet, so the market doesn’t care.</p>

<p>Past that, and just considering the system engineers who do care about GPUs rather than LLMs: the hardware product/market fit here is really rough.</p>

<p>People doing serious AI work want galactically huge amounts of GPU compute. A whole enterprise A100 is a compromise position for them; they want an SXM cluster of H100s.</p>
<p>Near as we can tell, MIG gives you a UUID to talk to the host driver, not a PCI device.</p>
<p>We think there’s probably a market for users doing lightweight ML work getting tiny GPUs. <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/technologies/multi-instance-gpu/">This is what Nvidia MIG does</a>, slicing a big GPU into arbitrarily small virtual GPUs. But for fully-virtualized workloads, it’s not baked; we can’t use it. And I’m not sure how many of those customers there are, or whether we’d get the density of customers per server that we need.</p>

<p><a href="https://fly.io/blog/cutting-prices-for-l40s-gpus-in-half">That leaves the L40S customers</a>. There are a bunch of these! We dropped L40S prices last year, not because we were sour on GPUs but because they’re the one part we have in our inventory people seem to get a lot of use out of. We’re happy with them. But they’re just another kind of compute that some apps need; they’re not a driver of our core business. They’re not the GPU bet paying off.</p>

<p>Really, all of this is just a long way of saying that for most software developers, “AI-enabling” their app is best done with API calls to things like Claude and GPT, Replicate and RunPod.</p>
<h3 id="what-did-we-learn"><a href="#what-did-we-learn" aria-label="Anchor"></a><span>What Did We Learn?</span></h3>
<p>A very useful way to look at a startup is that it’s a race to learn stuff. So, what’s our report card?</p>

<p>First off, when we embarked down this path in 2022, we were (like many other companies) operating in a sort of phlogiston era of AI/ML. The industry attention to AI had not yet collapsed around a small number of foundational LLM models. We expected there to be a diversity of <em>mainstream</em> models, the world <a href="https://github.com/elixir-nx/bumblebee" title="">Elixir Bumblebee</a> looks forward to, where people pull different AI workloads off the shelf the same way they do Ruby gems.</p>

<p>But <a href="https://www.cursor.com/" title="">Cursor happened</a>, and, as they say, how are you going to keep ‘em down on the farm once they’ve seen Karl Hungus? It seems much clearer where things are heading.</p>

<p>GPUs were a test of a Fly.io company credo: as we think about core features, we design for 10,000 developers, not for 5-6. It took a minute, but the credo wins here: GPU workloads for the 10,001st developer are a niche thing.</p>

<p>Another way to look at a startup is as a series of bets. We put a lot of chips down here. But the buy-in for this tournament gave us a lot of chips to play with. Never making a big bet of any sort isn’t a winning strategy. I’d rather we’d flopped the nut straight, but I think going in on this hand was the right call.</p>

<p>A really important thing to keep in mind here, and something I think a lot of startup thinkers sleep on, is the extent to which this bet involved acquiring assets. Obviously, some of our <a href="https://fly.io/blog/the-exit-interview-jp/" title="">costs here aren’t recoverable</a>. But the hardware parts that aren’t generating revenue will ultimately get liquidated; like with <a href="https://fly.io/blog/32-bit-real-estate/" title="">our portfolio of IPv4 addresses</a>, I’m even more comfortable making bets backed by tradable assets with durable value.</p>

<p>In the end, I don’t think GPU Fly Machines were going to be a hit for us no matter what we did. Because of that, one thing I’m very happy about is that we didn’t compromise the rest of the product for them. Security concerns slowed us down to where we probably learned what we needed to learn a couple months later than we could have otherwise, but we’re scaling back our GPU ambitions without having sacrificed <a href="https://fly.io/blog/sandboxing-and-workload-isolation/" title="">any of our isolation story</a>, and, ironically, GPUs <em>other people run</em> are making that story a lot more important. The same thing goes for our Fly Machine developer experience.</p>

<p>We started this company building a Javascript runtime for edge computing. We learned that our customers didn’t want a new Javascript runtime; they just wanted their native code to work. <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22616857" title="">We shipped containers</a>, and no convincing was needed. We were wrong about Javascript edge functions, and I think we were wrong about GPUs. That’s usually how we figure out the right answers:  by being wrong about a lot of stuff.</p>

	<p>
		In 2007, on my first trip to New York City, I grabbed a brand-new DSLR camera and photographed all the fonts I was supposed to love. I admired American Typewriter in all of the I &lt;3 NYC logos, watched Akzidenz Grotesk and Helvetica fighting over the subway signs, and even caught an occasional appearance of the flawlessly-named Gotham, still a year before it skyrocketed in popularity via Barack Obama’s first campaign. 
	</p>
	<p>
		But there was one font I didn’t even notice, even though it was everywhere around me.
	</p>
	<p>		
		Last year in New York, I walked over 100 miles and took thousands of photos of one and one font only.
	</p>
	<p>		
		The font’s name is Gorton.
	</p>
	
	<hr>
	
	<h3>
		1
	</h3>
	<p>		
		It’s hard to believe today that there was a time before I knew of Gorton and all its quirks and mysteries. The first time I realized the font even existed was some time in 2017, when I was researching for <a target="_blank" href="https://shifthappens.site/">my book about the history of typing</a>. 
	</p>
	<p>		
		Many keyboards, especially older ones, sported a particular distinctive font on their keycaps. It was unusually square in proportions, and a weird mélange of “mechanical” and “childish.”
	</p>
	
	
	
	<figure>
		<img src="https://aresluna.org/images/the-hardest-working-font-in-manhattan/keyboards/dsc03621.avif">
	</figure>
	

	<p>		 
		The more I looked at it, the more I realized how bizarre and amateurish it was. The G always felt like it was about to roll away on its side. There was a goofy wavy hook sticking out of Q. P and R were often too wide. &amp; and @ symbols would be laughed away in a type crit, and the endings of C felt like grabbing something next to it – a beginning of a ligature that never came.
	</p>
	<figure>
		<img src="https://aresluna.org/images/the-hardest-working-font-in-manhattan/keyboards/dsc00642.avif">
	</figure>
	<p>		
		The strangeness extended to the digits. There was a top-flatted 3 resembling a Cyrillic letter, 7 sloping down in a unique way, a very geometric 4, an unusual – perhaps even naïve – symmetry between 6 and 9, and a conflation of O with 0 that would be a fireable offense elsewhere.
	</p>
	<p>			
		Looking at just a few keyboards, it was also obvious that it wasn’t just one rigid font. There were always variations, sometimes even on one keyboard. 0 came square, dotted, or slashed. The usually very narrow letter I sometimes sported serifs. The R and the 6 moved their middles higher or lower. There also seemed to be a narrower version of the font, deployed when a keycap needed a word and not just a letter. (Lowercase letters existed too, but not very often.) 
	</p>
	

	
	

	<p>		
		My first thought was: What a mess. Is this how “<a target="_blank" href="https://fonts.ilovetypography.com/category/grotesque">grotesque</a>” fonts got their name?
	</p>
	<p>		
		Then, the second thought: I kind of like it.
	</p>

	
	<figcaption>The most distinctive letterforms of Gorton<span> (Press a key!)</span></figcaption>
	
	
	<p>		
		But what font was it? What The Font website posited TT Rounds, Identifont suggested it could be Divulge, my early guess was DIN Rounded or something related to road signage. Whatever it was, a flat R clearly separated it from Helvetica, and the shapes were not as round as even the un-rounded Gotham’s.
	</p>
	<p>		
		A few places for keyboard nerds referred to the font as “Gorton,” but that phrase yielded zero results anywhere I typically looked for fonts I could download and install.
	</p>
	<p>				
		I originally thought this had to do with how keys were made. Only in newer keyboards are the letters printed on top of the keys, or charred from their surface by a laser. In older ones – those from the early 1960s laboratory computers, or the 1980s microcomputers –&nbsp;the way every key was constructed was by first molding the letter from plastic of one color, and then grabbing a different plastic and molding the key around the letter. A Gorton letter was as physical as the key itself. It made the keys virtually indestructible – the legend could not wear off any more than its key – and I imagined required some specialized keyboard-making machinery that came with the “keyboard font” already there.

	<p>			
		But then, I started seeing Gorton in other places.
	</p>
	<p>					
		Hours of looking at close-ups of keys made me sensitive to the peculiar shapes of some of its letters. No other font had a Q, a 9, or a C that looked like this.
	</p>
	<p>					
		One day, I saw what felt like Gorton it on a ferry traversing the waters Bay Area. A few weeks later, I spotted it on a sign in a national park. Then on an intercom. On a street lighting access cover. In an elevator. At my dentist’s office. In an alley. 
	</p>
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>						
		These had one thing in common. All of the letters were carved into the respective base material – metal, plastic, wood. The removed shapes were often filled in with a different color, but sometimes left alone.
	</p>
	<p>					
		At one point someone explained to me Gorton must have been a routing font, meant to be carved out by a milling machine rather than painted on top or impressed with an inked press.
	</p>
	<p>							
		Some searches quickly led me to George Gorton Machine Co., a Wisconsin-based company which produced various engraving machines. The original model 1 led to model 1A and then 3U and then, half a decade later, P1-2. They were all pantograph engravers: They allowed you to install one or more letter templates and then trace their shape by hand. A matching rotating cutter would mimic your movements, and the specially configured arms would enlarge or reduce the output to the size you wanted.
		</p>

	<figcaption>Edited from a video <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7am-ysvGD3s">Saving The Machine the World Forgot</a> with kind permission from Inheritance Machining</figcaption>
	
	
	
	<p>					
		The first font in <a target="_blank" href="https://archive.org/details/gorton-master-copy-type-for-all-pantograph-machines">the 1952’s company catalogue</a> was called Gorton Normal and I felt I already knew it by heart.
	</p>
	
	

	
	<p>							
		This immediately explained both the metaphorical and literal rough edges of Gorton.
	</p>
	<p>					
		A lot of typography has roots in calligraphy – someone holding a brush in their hand and making natural but delicate movements that result in nuanced curves filled with thoughtful interchanges between thin and thick. Most of the fonts you ever saw follow those rules; even the most “mechanical” fonts have surprising humanistic touches if you inspect them close enough.
	</p>
	<p>			
		But not Gorton. Every stroke of Gorton is exactly the same thickness (typographers would call such fonts “monoline”). Every one of its endings is exactly the same rounded point. The italic is merely an oblique, slanted without any extra consideration, and while the condensed version has some changes compared to the regular width, those changes feel almost perfunctory.
	</p>
	<p>	
		Monoline fonts are not respected highly, because every type designer will tell you: This is not how you design a font. 
	</p>
	
	<hr>
	
	<h3>

	</h3>
	
	<p>		
		It seemed at this point that perhaps P1-2 and its predecessors were a somewhat popular machining product during the 20th century’s middle decades. But casual research through materials preserved by some of George Gorton Machine Company’s fans – including <a target="_blank" href="http://gorton-machine.org/">the grandson of the founder</a> – revealed something even more interesting. Gorton the font was a lot older than I expected. 
	</p>
	<p>		
		I found a 1935 catalog showing the very same font. Then one from 1925. And then, there was one all the way from 1902, showing the shapes I was starting to be mildly obsessed with.
	</p>
	<p>			
		To put it in perspective: the font I first assumed was a peer to 1950s Helvetica was already of retirement age the day Helvetica was born. Gorton was older than Gill Sans, Futura, or Johnston’s London Underground font. It was contemporaneous to what today we recognize as the first modern sans serif font, Akzidenz-Grotesk, released but three years before the end of the century.
	</p>

	
	<figcaption>This 1902 catalogue is so old it still has <a target="_blank" hef="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_code_(communications)">telegraph codes</a></figcaption>
	
	<p>
		Imagine how stripped down and exotic Gorton must have felt right next to George Gorton Machine’s then-current logo!
	</p>
	
	<figure>
		<img src="https://aresluna.org/images/the-hardest-working-font-in-manhattan/old-logo/old-logo.avif">
	</figure>

	<p>							
		<em>Now</em> I was interested. 
	</p>
	<p>					
		I started researching Gorton more. Unfortunately, as I already suspected, no one ever wrote “I used Gorton to typeset this,” because Gorton was a tenuous name at best. It was the first font, and perhaps originally the <em>only</em> font that came with the engraver, so it suffered a nameless fate, familiar later to many bespoke bitmap fonts adoring the screens of early computers.
	</p>
	<p>					
		The difference from these fonts, however, was that Gorton was meant to travel. And so, since searching for it by name was impossible, for months and years I just kept looking around for the now-familiar shapes.
	</p>
	<p>			
		And I found… a lot. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Gorton wasn’t just on computer keyboards, intercom placards, and sidewalk messages visited by many shoes. Gorton was there on typewriter keyboards, too. And on office signs and airline name tags. On boats, desk placards, rulers, and various home devices from fridges to tape dispensers.
	</p>
	<p>					
		It was also asked to help in situations other fonts rarely did. I spotted Gorton on overengineered buttons that were put to heavy industrial and military use. I saw it carved into surfaces of traffic control devices, elevators and escalators, locomotives and subway trains, submarines and jet fighters. Gorton made its way to peace- and wartime nuclear facilities, it was there on the elevator at the Kennedy Space Center with labels marked EARTH and SPACE… and it went <em>to actual space,</em> and then the Moon, as key legends on Apollo’s onboard computer.
	</p>
	
	
	
		

	
	<p>							
		But why? Why would anyone choose this kind of an ugly font where so many nicer fonts have already been around for ages?
	</p>
	<p>					
		Some of it might be the power of the default. Popular engraving equipment comes with a built-in font that’s so standard it reuses the router’s name? Of course you will see it, the same way you saw a lot of Arial in the 1990s, or Calibri today.
	</p>
	<figure>

	</figure>
	<figcaption>An example of a typical range of reducations. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gorton-machine.org/links/prayer.html">More range was available when needed</a></figcaption>

	<p>
		Gorton was also convenient. If your previous engraving work required you do to the routing equivalent of handwriting or lettering – every letter done by hand – then a modern font you could simply <em>copy,</em> and one designed with “a minimum of sharp corners for rapid tracing with a smooth stroke,” must have felt like a breath of fresh air.
	</p>
	
	<p>							
		But why engraving to begin with? Because the affordable and casual printing options we enjoy today – the office laser printers and home inkjets, the FedEx Kinko’s, the various cheap labelers – weren’t there. Even things that today feel obsolete, like dot matrix printers, Letraset, and popular letter stencils, were yet to be invented. Often, your only realistic option was the complicated and time-consuming lettering by hand.
	</p>
	<p>			
		On top of that, Gorton’s longevity must have felt attractive. Ink smudges. Paint fades away. Paper can catch fire (quickly) or germs (slowly). Carve something into plastic, on the other hand, and it can survive decades. Substitute plastic for metal, and you just turned decades into centuries. The text is not added atop heavy-duty material. The text <em>is</em> the material.

	<p>					
		I felt good about all my findings: What a strange story of a strange routing font! 
	</p>
	<p>
		But it turns out I was just getting started. Because soon, I noticed Gorton as ink on paper, and as paint on metal.
	</p>
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>We’re used to the flexibility of fonts today. Fonts as bits inside a computer can become a website, paint on paper, CNC routing, a wall projection, and many other things. But those freedoms weren’t as easy back when fonts were made out of metal. Life’s not as much fun outside of the glamor of a TTF file, and a routing font couldn’t immediately become a regular font – so seeing Gorton being additive and not subtractive was an unexpected discovery.
	</p>

	<figcaption>A Leroy lettering set in action, from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/made.by.edgar/">Made by Edgar</a></figcaption>
	<p>							
		It turns out that there developed a small cottage industry of things that extended Gorton past its engraving origins.
	</p>

	<p>							
		A company called Keuffel &amp; Esser Co. grabbed Gorton’s machines, and used them to create lettering sets called Leroy. This was Gorton abstracted away – still a pantograph, but cheap, small, completely manual, and a vastly simplified one: no possibility to make things bigger and smaller, and no carving –&nbsp;instead, you’d mount a special pen and draw letters by tracing them.
	</p>
	<p>							
		Another company, Wood-Regan Instrument Co., made a similar set called (semi-eponymously) Wrico. But then, they simplified the process even more. Instead of a pantograph, they offered for sale a set of simple lettering guides used to guide your pen directly on paper.
	</p>
	<p>							
		Some of the traditional draftspeople pooh-poohed these inventions – one handbook wrote “[Those are] of value chiefly to those who are not skilled in lettering. A professional show-card writer could work better and faster without it. A Leroy or Wrico lettering set permits work that is neat, rapid, and nearly foolproof, if not inspired.”
	</p>
	
	
	

	
	<p>			
		But the products ended up being popular and influential. Their output appeared in many technical documents, but spread even a bit further than that. Eventually, there were stencils made by Unitech, Lutz, Tacro, Teledyne Post, Tamaya, Tech Graphic, Ridgway’s, Faber Castell, Zephyr, Charvoz, Rotring, Pickett, and probably many more.
	</p>
	
		
	
	

	<p>			
		Then, both EC Comics and All-Star Comics <a target="_blank" href="https://kleinletters.com/Blog/wizards-of-leroy-and-wrico-lettering/">used Leroy in the 1940s and 1950s</a>, most notably in the first comic book that introduced Wonder Woman. This was Gorton spreading further than just technical documents, and inspiring more people.
	</p>
	
	
	

	<p>			
		Elsewhere silkscreening – a pretty cool technique of applying paint on surfaces through a wet mesh of fabric – took Gorton and Leroy in a different direction, by allowing paint on metal.
	</p>
	
	


	<p>			
		There was more. The popular plastic letters attached to fell boards, popularized by restaurants decades ago, and more recently revisited by Instagram mom influencers, also clearly derive from Gorton and Leroy.
	</p>
	
	
	

	
	<p>
		I also counted at least three different systems of “Gorton movable type” – some where you could assemble physical letters, and some where you could impress them into soft materials using steel types – and I imagine there were probably more.
	</p>
	
	
	

	
	<p>			
		Letraset, a cheap technique of applying a font by rubbing a letter from a provided sheet onto paper, popular throughout the 1960s, introduced first- or second-hand Leroy too – and so did a few competitors.
	</p>

		In the regulatory space, the U.S. military canonized Gorton in 1968 as a standard called MIL-SPEC-33558 for aircraft and other equipment dials, cancelled it in 1998… then brought it back again in 2007. NATO and STANAG followed. ANSI, American standardization body, made a more rounded Leroy an official font for technical lettering via <a target="_blank" href="https://archive.org/details/ansi-y14.2m-1971-line-conventions-and-lettering">ANSI Y14.2M</a>, and so did institutions like the US National Park Service.
	</p>

	

	<p>				
		Gorton went on and on and on. The early <a target="_blank" href="https://hackaday.com/2021/03/30/hershey-fonts-not-chocolate-the-origin-of-vector-lettering/">Hershey vector fonts</a>, developed on very early computers and still popular in CAD applications today, were also derived from Gorton/Leroy shapes, simplified so that the already-simple curves weren’t even necessary –&nbsp;any letter could now be drawn by a series of straight lines.
	</p>
	
	
	
	<p>					
		And even in the first universe Gorton inhabited things weren’t standing still. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
		As the engraving industry learned what’s popular and what is not, the offerings started getting more and more sophisticated. A promotional booklet called “The Whereabouts of 230 Engraving Machines” listed Gorton customers ranging from biscuit makers to fire engine constructors. <a target="_blank" href="http://gorton-machine.org/forms/form_933/index.html">Other</a> <a target="_blank" href="http://gorton-machine.org/forms/form_1370a/index.html">catalogs</a> <a target="_blank" href="http://gorton-machine.org/forms/form_2070/index.html">proudly listed</a> applications like book covers, billiard balls, organ keys, and toothbrushes, as well as “tools making more tools” – using Gorton engravers to create legends for other machines.
	</p>
	<p>		
		After you bought your pantograph engraver, you could buy attachments for sometimes surprising use cases:
	</p>
	
	
	
	
	<p>
		The original machine-shop pantographs were supplanted by smaller portable units (called Pantoetchers) on one side, and by increasingly complex <em>electronic</em> devices on the other. First generation of those were still huge room-size endeavors with Nixie tubes and complex interfaces labeled… in Gorton itself. 
	</p>

	
	
	
	<p>
		But the technology matured quickly and soon more and more early manual “tracer-guided” pantographs that forced the operator to put letters side by side and then trace them by hand, were superseded by <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_control">computerized ones</a>, with both the composition and the routing completely automated. They came from George Gorton Machine Co., and from competitors like New Hermes or H.P. Preis.
	</p>
	<p>				
		You no longer had to buy the chromium-plated brass alphabets weighing up to 13 pounds, choosing the right size from 3/8´´ to 3´´ ahead of time (pantographs allowed for reductions and enlargements, but only gave you a few steps within a specific range.) 
	</p>
	
	
	
	
	<p>
		Now, fonts came as digits or formulas built into computer memory, or – for a moment in time –&nbsp;as separate cartridges you’d insert in eager slots. (And yes, before you ask:&nbsp;there were <a target="_blank" href="https://archive.org/details/gorton-master-copy-type-for-all-pantograph-machines/page/n5/mode/2up">other routing monoline fonts</a>, too. But I really don’t care about any of them.)
	</p>
	
	<p>					
		It was the same story as in word processing right next door, where old-fashioned Gutenberg-era typesetting was being replaced by increasingly smaller and cheaper computers equipped with first-laughable-then-capable software.
	</p>
	<p>					
		And automation came for the Leroy branch of the tree as well. A few companies grabbed Leroy lettering templates and abstracted them away once more. They created curious small typewriter/plotter hybrids where typing letters on a keyboard would make the pen draw them on paper for you. (I own one of them, a Max Cadliner. It might be one of the strangest typewriters I’ve seen – a weird combination of a machine pretending to be another machine pretending to be a human hand.)

		If this was a Gorton typewriter, there were also Gorton <em>computers</em>, even more sophisticated 1980s machines whose text could be programmed in advance rather than typed one line at a time, and mixed with graphics.

	<p>			
		I don’t think the – by now 80 years and counting – fractal explosion of Gorton made its original creators rich.
	</p>
	<p>			
		Copy protection in the world of typography is complicated. The font’s name can be trademarked and other companies legally prevented from using it, and you can’t just grab matrices or font files and copy them without appropriate licenses. But take any text output using a font and then redraw it – and you are within your right to do so, and even to sell the final result. At least in America, or in some other countries until somewhat recently, the shapes of the letters themselves are not legally protected.
	</p>
	<p>			
		This is why Keuffel &amp; Esser, Wood-Regan Instrument, and Letraset could potentially grab Gorton and claim it their own, as long as they didn’t name it Gorton. 
	</p>
	<p>							
		But of course, Gorton was barely named “Gorton” to begin with. In the early days of George Gorton pantographs, as the default pantograph font, it came without a name. (The font sets for purchase were called “standard copies.”) Then, as other fonts were added, it was retroactively named Gorton Normal – the name of the company and the most generic word possible.
	</p>
	<p>					
		Leroy lettering sets started with one font, so similarly to Gorton the font started to be known as “Leroy,” then “Series C,” then “Gothic.” New Hermes called it simply “Block,” Letraset went with “Engineering Standard,” and Rotring – another producer of little computerized plotters&nbsp;– with “Universal.” I’ve also seen “A style,” “Plain Gothic,” and, mysteriously, “Standpoint.” 
	</p>
	<p>							
		I don’t think this was meant to be disrespectful. “Standard,“ “Universal,” “A style” might not have had the connotations of “generic” we associate with them today, but rather meaning “the only one you need,” “approved of by millions,” or “the ultimate.”
	</p>
	<p>							
		But there <em>was</em> one name that felt somewhat inconsiderate. It appeared in one product in the 1980s, a few decades after the birth of another font whose name became recognizable and distinguished. In that product, Gorton was referred to as “Linetica.”

	<p>						
		Each of these reappearances made small changes to the shapes of some letters. Leroy’s ampersand was a departure from Gorton’s. Others softened the middle of the digit 3, and Wrico got rid of its distinctive shape altogether. Sometimes the tail of the Q got straightened, the other times K cleaned up. Punctuation –&nbsp;commas, quotes, question marks –&nbsp;was almost always redone. But even without hunting down the proof confirming the purchase of a Gorton’s pantograph or a Leroy template set as a starting point, the lineage of its lines was obvious. (The remixes riffed off of Gorton Condensed or the normal, squareish edition… and at times both. The extended version – not that popular to begin with – was often skipped.)
	</p>

	
	<figcaption>Classic Gorton vs. Gorton Modified</figcaption>
		

	<p>						
		The only “official” update to Gorton I know of, and one actually graced with a name, was Gorton Modified. It was made some time in the 1970s by one of the main keyboard keycap manufacturers, Comptec (later Signature Plastics). It was almost a fusion of Gorton and Futura, with more rounded letterforms. Gone was the quirkiness of 3, 7, Q, C, and the strange, tired ampersand. This is the version people might recognize from some of the 1980s computers, or mechanical keyboards today. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
		It is also that last Gorton that mattered.

	<p>					
		By the time I learned about this, seven years in, I’ve become truly obsessed with Gorton and made it public by <a target="_blank" href="https://newsletter.shifthappens.site/archive/a-tale-of-three-skeuomorphs/">writing about it in my newsletter</a>. 
	</p>
	<p>							
		My every walk in Chicago or San Francisco was counting down “time to Gorton” – sometimes mere minutes before I saw a placard or an intercom with the familiar font.
	</p>
	<p>							
		This might be embarrassing to admit, but I have never been so happy seeing a font in the wild, particularly as there was almost always some new surprise – a numero, a line going through the Z, a new use, or a new imperfection. And, for a font that didn’t exist, I saw it surprisingly often.
	</p>
	
	
	
	
	

	
	<p>									
		I even spotted Gorton a few times in Spain, or the U.K., and didn’t make too much of it, not thinking about the likelihood of machines from George Gorton’s company in a small town of Racine, Wisconsin making it all the way to different continents. In hindsight I should have.
	</p>

	
	<figcaption>Gorton on old British cars, with a particularly delightful Rolls Royce logo made by a simple duplication of the classic Gorton letter R</figcaption>


	<p>						
		It was only on a trip to Australia where something started connecting. Here, once more, I saw Gorton on the streets, put to work in all sorts of unglamorous situations:
	</p>
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>							
		Some letterforms in the above photos felt slightly odd, and so did Gorton on the heavy machinery in an abandoned shipyard on an island near Sydney:
	</p>

	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>							
		And a visit to a naval museum cemented it all:
	</p>
	
	
	
	
	
	
	

	
	
		
	
	<p>
		It was Gorton, although with some consistent quirks: 2, 5, 6, and 9 were shorter, the centers of M and W didn’t stretch all the way across, and the distinctive shape of S was slightly different here.
	</p>
	<p>							
		What on literal earth! 
	</p>
	<p>							
		Fortunately, this time around, a type designer familiar with my now-public obsession with Gorton clued me in. Gorton didn’t actually originate from Racine, Wisconsin in the late 19th century. It started a bit earlier, and quite a bit further away, at a photographic lens maker in the U.K. called Taylor, Taylor &amp; Hobson. 
	</p>
	<p>							
		In 1894, TT&amp;H needed some way to put markings on their lenses. This being late 19th century, their options were limited to manual engraving, which must have felt tricky given the small font sizes necessary. So the company did what makers sometimes do – instead of searching for a solution that might not have even existed, they made new types of machines to carve out letters, and then designed a font to be used with them.
	</p>

	
	<figure>
		<img src="https://aresluna.org/images/the-hardest-working-font-in-manhattan/lenses/img02330.avif">
	</figure>
	
	
	<p>
		I don’t know how this first proto-Gorton was designed – unfortunately, Taylor, Taylor &amp; Hobson’s history seems sparse and despite personal travels to U.K. archives, I haven’t found anything interesting – but I know simple technical writing standards existed already, and likely influenced the appearance of the newfangled routing font.

	<figcaption>From a 1895 “Free-hand lettering” book by Frank T. Daniels</figcaption>

	<p>					
		This was perhaps the first modern pantograph engraver, and perhaps even the arrival of a concept of an engraving font – the first time technical writing was able to be replicated consistently via the aid of the machine.
	</p>

	
	

	<p>			
		No wonder that other companies came knocking. Only a few years later, still deep within the 19th century, Taylor, Taylor &amp; Hobson <a target="_blank" href="http://gorton-machine.org/archives/TTH_license_1898/index.html">licensed their stuff to a fledgling American company</a> named after its founder. Gorton Model 1 was the first U.S. version of the engraver, and the TT&amp;H font must have been slightly adjusted on arrival. 
	</p>

	</figure>
	<figcaption>A Taylor-Hobson pantograph in use in 1942</figcaption>
	
	<p>			
		This adds to the accomplishments of Gorton – the font was actually <em>older</em> than even Akzidenz-Grotesk, and has been used on World War II equipment and later on on British rifles and motorcycles (and 3,775 finger posts in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.yorkshiredales.org.uk/behind-the-signs-the-man-and-the-machine/">one of the UK’s national parks</a>), but it complicates the story of the name even more. Turns out, the font without a name has even less of a name than I suspected.
	</p>
	<p>			
		If the Taylor, Taylor &amp; Hobson (or, Taylor-Hobson, as their engravers were known) “branch” of Gorton were more used, should it usurp the at least somewhat popular Gorton name? Or should it just because it was first and the letterform changes were small? Does it matter? Where does one font end and another begin? (Unsurprisingly, TT&amp;H didn’t properly name the font either, eventually calling it “A style” for regular and “C style” for condensed variants. Google searches for “taylor hobson font” are a lot more sparse than those for Gorton.)

		In the end, I’m sticking with Gorton for the whole branch since that feels the most well-known name, but I feel ill-equipped to make that call for everyone. You might choose to call it Gorton, Leroy, TT&amp;H, Taylor-Hobson, or one of the many other names. (Just, ideally, not Linetica.)

	<p>					
		And so, throughout the 20th century, Gorton has lived two parallel lives –&nbsp;one originating in the U.K. and later expanding to its colonies and the rest of Europe, and another one in America. 
	</p>
	<p>							
		I am still tracing various appearences of Gorton and perhaps you, dear reader, will help me with that. (<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_illusion">Chances are</a>, you will see Gorton later today!) I’m curious about whether Gorton made it to Eastern Europe, Africa, or Asia. I’m interested in seeing if it appeared in Germany where the objectively better-designed DIN fonts became much more popular in Gorton’s niche.
	</p>

	
			
	

			
	

	
	<p>
		The history of this strange font spans over a century and I’ve seen it in so many countries by now, used in so many situations. But it’s impossible for me to say Gorton is the most hard-working font in the world.
	</p>
	<p>							
		To this title, there are many contenders. Garamond has a head start of 300+ years and has been released in more versions than letters in any alphabet. Helvetica is so famous and used so much that even its ugly copy, Arial, became a household name. Whatever font MS Office or a popular operating system appoint to be “the default” – from Times New Roman through Calibri to Roboto – immediately enjoys the world premiere that any Hollywood movie would be envious of. There is even a 5×7 pixel font originally started by Hitachi that you can see everywhere on cheap electronic displays in cash registers and intercoms.
	</p>
	<p>							
		But there is one place in the world where Gorton pulls triple duty, and I feel confident in saying at least this: Gorton is the hardest working font in Manhattan.
	</p>
	<p>						
		In 2007, on my first trip to New York City, I grabbed my brand-new DSLR camera and photographed all the fonts I was supposed to love: American Typewriter, Helvetica, Gotham. But, in hindsight, I missed the most obvious one.
	</p>
	<p>							
		Gorton is everywhere in Manhattan. It’s there in the elevators, in the subway, on ambulances, in various plaques outside and inside buildings. And god knows it’s there on so, so many intercoms.
	</p>

	
	
	
	

	<p>					
		I wouldn’t be surprised if there weren’t a single block without any Gorton in a whole of Manhattan.
	</p>

	
	<figcaption>A complete inventory of Gorton outside, near my hotel, between 5th and 7th avenues and 25th and 35th streets. I didn’t have access to the interiors of most buildings.</figcaption>

	<p>	
		The omnipresence of Gorton makes it easy to collect all the type crimes layered on top of the font’s already dubious typographical origins. Walking through Manhattan, you can spot the abominable lowercase that should better be forgotten:
	</p>
	
	

	

	
	<p>							
		You can see all sorts of kerning mistakes:
	</p>


	
	
	
	
	<p>									
		You will notice the many, many routing imperfections – an unfinished stroke, a shaky hand, or services of a pantograph that never felt the loving touch of regular maintenance:
	</p>

	
		
	
	
	<p>
		There are all the strange decisions to haphazardly mix various styles of Gorton, or even to mix Gorton with other fonts:
	</p>
	
	
	
		
	
	<p>											
		You can even spot reappearing strange characters like a weirdly deep 3, or a flattened 4:
	</p>

	
	
		
  <p>
    I wish I understood how they came to be, but I have a hunch. The nature of pantographic reproduction is that Gorton carved into metal is not that far away from the original Gorton font template you started with! So in addition to the George Gorton and Taylor Hobson originals, and the other named and above-the-table copies, they might have been bigger or smaller Gorton <em>bootlegs</em>. I have one myself, carved into acrylic, of unknown provenance and even more nameless than I thought possible for an already name-free font.
  </p>
    
	<p>
		But New York Gorton holds pleasant surprises, too. Despite the simplicity of Gorton itself, the combinations of font sizes, cutter sizes, materials, reproductions, and applications can still yield some striking effects:

		This was what made me walk 100 miles. Over and over again, Gorton found ways to make itself interesting. Without hyperbole, I consider the above photos simply beautiful.
	
	

	<p>
		In a city that never sleeps, Gorton wasn’t allowed to sleep, either. Even in the richest and most glamorous neighborhoods of Manhattan, the font would be there, doing the devil’s work without complaining. Gorton made Gotham feel bougie; American Typewriter touristy.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		And once in a while, I’d find Gorton that would wink at me with a story –&nbsp;followed by that aching in the heart as I realized I’d never know what the story was.

		You’re not supposed to fall in love with an ugly font. No one collects specimens of Arial. No one gets into eBay fights for artifacts set in Papyrus. No one walks a hundred miles in a hot New York summer, sweating beyond imagination, getting shouted at by security guys, to capture photos of Comic Sans.
	</p>
	<p>							
		So why do I love Gorton so much? 
	</p>
	<p>							
		The Occam’s Razor seems sharp on this one. Perhaps I like it because I’m a boy and Gorton is often attached to heavy machinery. 
	</p>

		Or perhaps I have a strange affection to quirky hard-working fonts created by people who did not come from the world of type: the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Subway_(typeface)">Toronto Subway font</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ltmuseum.co.uk/collections/stories/people/edward-johnston-man-behind-londons-lettering">London Underground font</a>, or <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Modern">Computer Modern</a>. 	(This essay is typeset in a strangely-spaced version of Century put together for <a target="_blank" href="https://archive.org/details/ibm-selectric-composer-type-style-portfolio/page/18/mode/2up">Selectric Composer typewriters</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.kutilek.de/selectric/">recreated for on-screen use</a>. If that didn’t bother you before, it will bother you through the rest of this article.)
	</p>
	<p>				
		But there must be more to it. Perhaps it’s all about the strange contrasts Gorton represents. The font is so ubiquitous, but also profoundly unrecognizable, sporting no designer and no name. Gorton is a decidedly toy-like, amateurish font deployed to for some of the most challenging type jobs: nuclear reactors, power plants, spacecraft. More than most other fonts, Gorton feels it’s been made by machines for machines –&nbsp;but in its use, it’s also the font that allows you to see so many human mistakes and imperfections.
	</p>
	<p>				
		Gorton also feels mistake-friendly. The strange limitations of Gorton mean that some of the transgressions of other fonts don’t apply here. The monoline nature of the font means that messing with the size of Gorton is okay: Shrinking the font for small caps or superscript, for example, gives you still-valid letterforms, almost by accident. 
	</p>

	
	
	<p>
		Stretching or slanting Gorton is not as much a typographical crime as it would be with other fonts because you don’t stretch the tip of the router itself.
	</p>
	
	

	
	<p>							
		There are genuinely moments where I felt Gorton gave people freedoms to maul it decades before variable fonts allowed us similar flexibiity.
		And on top of that, the simplicity of the letterforms themselves feels compatible with the typical naïveté of Gorton’s typesetting.

	<p>
    Sure, there are really bad renditions that are inexcusable. 

		But most of the time, the imperfections and bad decisions are what makes Gorton come alive. They don’t feel like a profound misunderstandings of typography, typesetting, or Gorton itself. They don’t feel like abuses or aberrations. No, they feel exactly how Gorton was supposed to be used – haphazardly, without much care, to solve a problem and walk away. (Later routing fonts copied Helvetica, but seeing Helvetica in this context with all the same mistakes grates so much more.)
	</p>

	<p>			
		The transgressions are not really transgressions. They all feel honest. The font and its siblings just show up to work without pretense, without ego, without even sporting a nametag. Gorton isn’t meant to be admired, celebrated, treasured. It’s meant to do some hard work and never take credit for it. Gorton feels like it was always a font, and never a typeface. (Depending on how rigid you are with your definitions, some versions of Gorton – especially those without instructions on how letters are positioned against each other – might not even <a target="_blank" href="https://mastodon.design/@fhardwig@mastodon.social/113515144112560218">classify as a font</a>!)
	</p>
		
	<p>					
		And I think I love Gorton because over the years I grew a little tired of the ultra flat displays rendering miniature pixels with immaculate precision. 	
		With Gorton, carving into metal or plastic means good-looking fixes are impossible:
	</p>
	
	
	

	<p>
		And unsurprising given its roots, Gorton has dimensionality that most fonts cannot ever enjoy: A routing tip picked in the 1980s and a sun coming in from just the right angle forty years later can create a moment that thousands of letterpress cards can only dream of.
	</p>
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>
		Perhaps above everything else, Gorton is all about <em>texture</em>. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Every kind of engraving has it, of course. But these are not precise submillimeter letters at the bottom of your MacBook Pro or Apple Watch. This is the utilitarian, often harried, sometimes downright <em>careless</em> Gorton, carved into steel of a  
		mid-century intercom and filled in with <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/llzdLgMurvw?si=8S7px9gg8iH4iav2&amp;t=101">special paste or wax</a>, or put on an office placard made out of a special two-layer material made especially so engraving it reveals the second color underneath, without the need for infill. 
	</p>

	
	
	
	
	
	<p>			
		(This is also true when it comes to the original reason I learned of Gorton. Letters on keycaps show the same artifacts – you just have to look very, very closely.)

	<p>
		That’s the last, and perhaps the best thing to fall in love with. 
	</p>
		
	<p>
		You won’t be able to fully appreciate it here, of course, but maybe this will give an approximation of how beautiful Gorton’s non-beauty can be:

		This has been a strange thing to write. Gorton has been around for over 135 years and used in so many countries for so many reasons, and yet I found no single article about it. 
	</p>
	<p>					
		I feel the burden of being an amateur historian, wanting to know and share so much more, but only being able to provide little. I don’t know the full extent of Gorton’s use. I don’t know who designed it. My chronology is rickety and pieced together from a few breadcrumbs. I dream of seeing the original drawings or drafts once laid on the tables of Taylor, Taylor &amp; Hobson offices, or some notes, or some correspondence. I fear they might no longer exist.
	</p>


	<p>					
		Also, if part of the allure of Gorton is shying away from the limelight and not being admired, am I doing it a disservice by writing about it?
	</p>
	<p>					
		But mostly, I can’t shake the feeling that we all missed a window. That this essay can’t be just a celebration, but also needs to be the beginnings of a eulogy.
	</p>

		Walking around New York, you get a sense that even Gorton carved into metal can disappear. Some of the signs are rusted or destroyed beyond repair. Others get replaced by more modern, charmless equivalents.
	</p>
	<p>							
		Gorton itself is obsolete. All <a target="_blank" href="https://spkeyboards.com/">the keyboards that use Gorton Modified</a> you can still buy new today are tipping a hat to nostalgia. The omnipresence of Gorton in New York City is already time shifted from its decades of glory, a simple confirmation of what Robert Moses knew so well: that once built, cities don’t change all that much. But few of the new placards use Gorton, and none of the new intercoms do. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Taylor, Taylor &amp; Hobson went through multiple splits and mergers and survives as a subsidiary of Ametek, chiefly working on measuring devices. George Gorton Machine Co. from Racine has been bought by Kearny &amp; Trecker, which became Cross &amp; Trecker, was acquired by Giddings &amp; Lewis, and then acquired <em>again</em> by ThyssenKrupp, but not before the Gorton branch was spun off as Lars, and in a sequence of events now resembling a telenovella, eventually bought by Famco in 1987. I do not believe any corporate grandchildren of TT&amp;H and George Gorton’s company are today selling Gorton in any capacity.
	</p>
	<p>							
		It will take decades, perhaps even centuries, but one day the last of this font will be gone. The modern recreations (<a target="_blank" href="https://aresluna.org/the-hardest-working-font-in-manhattan/recreations">I eventually found quite a few</a>) won’t help. They are perhaps all missing a point, anyway.
	</p>

	<p>
		But there’s a somewhat silver lining. Yes, when Gorton is carved into fresh metal, there might be nothing more pretty than seeing its depths glistening in the sun.
	</p>
	
	
	

	
	<p>
		But fresh, shining metal is at this point rare. Fortunately, the Gorton I love most is the weathered Gorton.
	</p>
	
	
	
	
	<p>							
		Manhattan’s tired Gorton is the best variant of Gorton: infill cracked by hot summers followed by frigid winters, the surface scratched by keys or worn out by many finger presses, the routing snafus meeting decades of wear and tear. Gorton’s no stranger to water, snow, rust, or dirt.
	</p>
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>		
		This is, perhaps, how you become gortonpilled. You learn to recognize the 7 with a crooked hook, the Q with a swung dash, the strange top-heavy 3, the simple R. You start noticing the endings of each character being consistently circular, rather than occasionally flat. A routing mistake, suspicious kerning, or the absence of lowercase are not a wrongdoing – they’re a <em>confirmation</em>.
	</p>
	
		
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>							
		You find yourself enchanted with how this simple font went so very far. And then you touch the letters, just to be sure. If you can <em>feel</em> them, chances are this is Gorton.
