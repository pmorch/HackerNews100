                                    <p>Prefixes are treacherous little beasts. Just when you think you've come to an understanding, prefixes such as <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/in-"><em>in</em>-</a> will come along and carry meanings such as “not,” “in, within,” “into,” “toward,” or “put into or onto.” And to make things worse, some of the beginnings of words which appear to be prefixes aren’t prefixes at all, even if they seem to function in the same manner. </p>

<p>Why are we bringing this up? Well, we didn’t want to tell you in this way, but we didn’t want you to hear it from someone else, either. There’s a new sense of <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/nonplussed"><em>nonplussed</em></a> that people have been using, and…well, we’d just like to give you fair warning in case our descriptivist nature causes us to take action. This new sense appears to stem from a mistaken belief that the first three letters of <em>nonplus</em> are there to indicate that someone is something other than “plussed” (although what being plussed would entail here remains a mystery). </p>

We'll never know.</p>

<p>It’s somewhat questionable whether the <em>non</em> in <em>nonplus</em> is actually a prefix at all; the word came into English in the 16th century, and was taken from the Latin <em>non plus</em>, which means “no more.” When it first appeared in our language it was used as a noun, with the meaning of “<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/quandary">quandary</a>.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This was then, and is now, the answere to that friuolous obiection, and this is the Nonplus that the Libeller vaunteth of.<br>—Thomas Cooper, <em>An Admonition to the People of England</em>, 1589</p>
  
  <p>I am brought to a nonplus, O Lorde what shall I saie?<br>—Edward Hutchins, <em>Davids Sling Against Great Goliath</em>, 1593</p>
  
  <p>So that now we are much beholding to M. Deacon, and M. Walker, that haue put all fooles and mad men to a perpetuall non plus, whose tongues would otherwise continually bee tampring.<br>—John Darrel, <em>The Replie of Iohn Darrel</em>, 1602</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By the early 17th century <em>nonplus</em> was being used as a verb, with the meaning of “to cause to be at a loss as to what to say, think, or do.” Then, as now, the word is often encountered in its participial form (<em>nonplussed</em>), with a meaning that is nearly synonymous with “<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/perplexed">perplexed</a>.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here may the Non-plust wooer fetch a wile 
  <br>To breake all Remora's, plots to beguile 
  <br>All Fortune's crosses: and if language faile, 
  <br>Here may he learne to court, triumph, bewaile 
  <br>I'th eloquentest straines.<br>—Achilles Tatius, <em>The Loves of Clitophon and Leucippe</em>, 1638</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For the next three hundred and some years <em>nonplus</em> remained on the straight and narrow, avoiding the temptations of demon rum and semantic drift, and as a result of this managed to keep its meaning remarkably unchanged. And then in the early 20th century some people began to use <em>nonplus</em> to mean “unruffled, unconcerned,” and ever since then the word just hasn’t been the same.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I came just in time to see two policemen pushing the car to one side so that the firewagon could get near the plug.
  <br>Of course anyone knows that under very embarrassing circumstances one is to appear non-plussed, as they say, and smoke a cigarette.<br>—<em>The Pittston Gazette</em> (Pittston, PA), 15 Aug. 1930</p>
  
  <p>The onlooker at the right appears nonplussed at the game the posters offer, but then—she’s only a mannequin.<br>—<em>The Mason City Globe-Gazette</em> (Mason City, IA), 16 Apr. 1948</p>
  
  <p>Twelve-year-old E. B. “Buzzie” Barker Jr. remained nonplussed yesterday despite the attention and congratulations that he was receiving for having won the Peninsula’s Soap Box Derby Sunday.
  <br>”I think we are more excited than he is,” his mother, Mrs. Barton Barker, commented. “He is just about as unconcerned about the whole thing,” she said, but didn’t finish.<br>—<em>Daily Press</em> (Newport News, VA), 28 Jun. 1955</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The “unruffled” sense of <em>nonplussed</em> increased as the 20th century went on, although when it was noticed this sense has been categorically rejected as a mistake. Mistake it may well be, but the fact remains that this sense of the word is in widespread use today, and may be found often enough in well regarded and highly edited, publications.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While senior officials in the Israeli Foreign Ministry fume over the diplomatic mess caused by the implications of the Dubai assassinations, those who know Mr Dagan say he is nonplussed by the row.<br>—<em>The Times</em> (London, UK), 18 Feb. 2010</p>
  
  <p>There is also the stumbling conversation of the other blind novitiates,but we are all really dependent on the voice of our guide, Romeo Edmead, a vigorous, charming man, completely nonplussed by the tumult we find around us.<br>—Edward Rothstein, <em>The New York Times</em>, 19 Aug. 2011</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If there is a lesson here, it is that you should never trust prefixes (or anything that looks like one). It may leave you <em>nonplussed</em>.</p>

                        The "thorium transition", which physicists have been looking for for decades, has now been excited for the first time with lasers. This paves the way for revolutionary high precision technologies, including nuclear clocks.
                    </p><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>Physicists have been hoping for this moment for a long time: for many years, scientists all around the world have been searching for a very specific state of thorium atomic nuclei that promises revolutionary technological applications. It could be used, for example, to build an nuclear clock that could measure time more precisely than the best atomic clocks available today. It could also be used to answer completely new fundamental questions in physics - for example, the question of whether the constants of nature are actually constant or whether they change in space and time.</p><p>Now this hope has come true: the long-sought thorium transition has been found, its energy is now known exactly. For the first time, it has been possible to use a laser to transfer an atomic nucleus into a state of higher energy and then precisely track its return to its original state. This makes it possible to combine two areas of physics that previously had little to do with each other: classical quantum physics and nuclear physics. A crucial prerequisite for this success was the development of special thorium-containing crystals. A research team led by Prof. Thorsten Schumm from TU Wien (Vienna) has now published this success together with a team from the National Metrology Institute Braunschweig (PTB) in the journal "Physical Review Letters".</p><h3>Switching quantum states</h3><p>Manipulating atoms or molecules with lasers is commonplace today: if the wavelength of the laser is chosen exactly right, atoms or molecules can be switched from one state to another. In this way, the energies of atoms or molecules can be measured very precisely. Many precision measurement techniques are based on this, such as today's atomic clocks, but also chemical analysis methods. Lasers are also often used in quantum computers to store information in atoms or molecules.</p><p>For a long time, however, it seemed impossible to apply these techniques to atomic nuclei. "Atomic nuclei can also switch between different quantum states. However, it usually takes much more energy to change an atomic nucleus from one state to another – at least a thousand times the energy of electrons in an atom or a molecule," says Thorsten Schumm. "This is why normally atomic nuclei cannot be manipulated with lasers. The energy of the photons is simply not enough."</p><p>This is unfortunate, because atomic nuclei are actually the perfect quantum objects for precision measurements: They are much smaller than atoms and molecules and are therefore much less susceptible to external disturbances, such as electromagnetic fields. In principle, they would therefore allow measurements with unprecedented accuracy.</p><h3>The needle in the haystack</h3><p>Since the 1970s, there has been speculation that there might be a special atomic nucleus which, unlike other nuclei, could perhaps be manipulated with a laser, namely thorium-229. This nucleus has two very closely adjacent energy states – so closely adjacent that a laser should in principle be sufficient to change the state of the atomic nucleus.</p><p>For a long time, however, there was only indirect evidence of the existence of this transition. "The problem is that you have to know the energy of the transition extremely precisely in order to be able to induce the transition with a laser beam," says Thorsten Schumm. "Knowing the energy of this transition to within one electron volt is of little use, if you have to hit the right energy with a precision of one millionth of an electron volt in order to detect the transition.” It is like looking for a needle in a haystack – or trying to find a small treasure chest buried on a kilometer-long island.</p><h3>The thorium crystal trick</h3><p>Some research groups have tried to study thorium nuclei by holding them individually in place in electromagnetic traps. However, Thorsten Schumm and his team chose a completely different technique. "We developed crystals in which large numbers of thorium atoms are incorporated," explains Fabian Schaden, who developed the crystals in Vienna and measured them together with the PTB team. "Although this is technically quite complex, it has the advantage that we can not only study individual thorium nuclei in this way but can hit approximately ten to the power of seventeen thorium nuclei simultaneously with the laser – about a million times more than there are stars in our galaxy." The large number of thorium nuclei amplifies the effect, shortens the required measurement time and increases the probability of actually finding the energy transition.</p><p>On November 21, 2023, the team was finally successful: the correct energy of the thorium transition was hit exactly, the thorium nuclei delivered a clear signal for the first time. The laser beam had actually switched their state. After careful examination and evaluation of the data, the result has now been published.</p><p>"For us, this is a dream coming true," says Thorsten Schumm. Since 2009, Schumm had focused his research entirely on the search for the thorium transition. His group as well as competing teams from all over the world have repeatedly achieved important partial successes in recent years. "Of course we are delighted that we are now the ones who can present the crucial breakthrough: The first targeted laser excitation of an atomic nucleus," says Schumm.</p><h3>The dream of the atomic nucleus clock</h3><p>This marks the start of a new exciting era of research: now that the team knows how to excite the thorium state, this technology can be used for precision measurements. "From the very beginning, building an atomic clock was an important long-term goal," says Thorsten Schumm. "Similar to how a pendulum clock uses the swinging of the pendulum as a timer, the oscillation of the light that excites the thorium transition could be used as a timer for a new type of clock that would be significantly more accurate than the best atomic clocks available today."</p><p>But it is not just time that could be measured much more precisely in this way than before. For example, the Earth's gravitational field could be analyzed so precisely that it could provide indications of mineral resources or earthquakes. The measurement method could also be used to get to the bottom of fundamental mysteries of physics: Are the constants of nature really constant? Or can tiny changes perhaps be measured over time? "Our measuring method is just the beginning," says Thorsten Schumm. "We cannot yet predict what results we will achieve with it. It will certainly be very exciting."</p><h3>Original publication</h3><p>Laser excitation of the Th-229 nucleus, Physical Review Letters:<br><a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/accepted/2c07aYbeC981d47c171619f5604116053962ac79a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://journals.aps.org/prl/accepted/2c07aYbeC981d47c171619f5604116053962ac79a<span>, opens an external URL in a new window</span></a></p><p>Full paper (preprint): <a href="https://www.tuwien.at/fileadmin/Assets/tu-wien/News/2024/Thorium_Preprint.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.tuwien.at/fileadmin/Assets/tu-wien/News/2024/Thorium_Preprint.pdf<span>, opens an external URL in a new window</span></a></p><h3>Picture download</h3><p><a href="https://www.tuwien.at/tu-wien/aktuelles/news/news/bilderdownload" target="_blank">Download pictures provided by TU Wien and PTB<span>, opens an external URL in a new window</span></a></p><h3>Further reading</h3><p><strong><a href="https://www.tuwien.at/en/tu-wien/news/news-articles/news/die-lange-suche-nach-dem-thorium-uebergang" target="_blank">Historical Background: The Long Search for the Thorium Transition<span>, opens an external URL in a new window</span></a></strong></p><p><strong><a href="https://www.tuwien.at/en/tu-wien/news/news-articles/news/von-atomkern-uhren-und-den-grundkonstanten-der-natur" target="_blank">Applications: Nuclear Clocks and the Fundamental Constants of Nature<span>, opens an external URL in a new window</span></a></strong></p><p><strong><a href="https://www.tuwien.at/en/tu-wien/news/news-articles/news/high-tech-edelsteine-fuer-die-forschung" target="_blank">The Crystal Trick:&nbsp;High-tech Gemstones for Nuclear Science<span>, opens an external URL in a new window</span></a></strong></p><p><a href="https://www.tuwien.at/fileadmin/Assets/tu-wien/News/2024/Thorium_Info_Package.pdf" title="thorium" target="_blank">Download full info package (PDF)<span>, opens a file in a new window</span></a></p><h3>Contact</h3><p>Prof. Thorsten Schumm<br> Institute of Atomic and Subatomic Physics<br> TU Wien<br> +43 1 58801 141896<br><span>thorsten.schumm<span>@</span>tuwien.ac.at</span></p><p>Text: Florian Aigner</p></div></div>]]></description>

Looked back on with the blessing of hindsight, there exists a discrete before and after the moment, but for those who lived it, the moment may have had a very long "during" period. Those who live in the "during" find themselves impatient, looking to be on the other side of the event, anxiously waiting for "now" to be "history". They want to live to see the thing complete. They want it to be done.</p><p>For when "now" becomes history, there is a sense of peace of mind, a complete loop, a chord that resolves into something.</p><blockquote>
<p>History cannot be told while it is happening, therefore, not only because the people involved are too busy or too confused to puzzle it out, but because what is happening can’t be made sense of until its implications have been resolved.</p>

I can only discuss the landscape as I see it, the work completed by those who came <em>before me</em>, and the work being done now <em>by me</em>.  </p><blockquote>Someday, libraries will be fully mechanized. Then, without leaving one’s office, it will be possible to pick up the phone, dial in a code, and have the actual paper one is looking for almost instantly at hand. Something of the sort has got to happen, or our libraries will become buried in the mass of books and articles now being printed, and searching in the old way will become hopeless.</blockquote><p><em>-- Pieces of the Action (1970)</em></p><p>The "during" is hard work, and very lonely work. There are no promises of success, and indeed, the path is one where you can't see more than three feet ahead of you and you exist on the cliff's edge of extinction by any silly mishap. The work  of "during" is exhausting, and it constantly holds you taut and alert, afraid of the shadows that lurk beyond the campfire's edge.</p><figure><img src="https://www.bramadams.dev/content/images/2024/04/Horace-Vernet-Cliff-of-Fecamp.jpeg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1200" height="818" srcset="https://www.bramadams.dev/content/images/size/w600/2024/04/Horace-Vernet-Cliff-of-Fecamp.jpeg 600w, https://www.bramadams.dev/content/images/size/w1000/2024/04/Horace-Vernet-Cliff-of-Fecamp.jpeg 1000w, https://www.bramadams.dev/content/images/2024/04/Horace-Vernet-Cliff-of-Fecamp.jpeg 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Fortunately, the work of the edge isn't without some form of solace.

This history is not only a guide for Personal Library Science, but a key player in it's very fiber of being.

Even when they were doing timesharing, they talked in terms of virtual card readers and virtual card punches. Everything was still 80-column records. With DEC, it was the timesharing mentality that they never escaped. And I suppose with Microsoft it's an open question whether they'll be able to move beyond the desktop-PC mentality.<br>

This claim began to come true years later with the release of the GPT Store (<a href="https://www.bramadams.dev/issue-42/"><em>discussed in issue #42</em></a>). Suddenly, individual people – not at the organization level – found themselves being able to create their own solutions to their unique, idiosyncratic problems.</p><blockquote>Idiosyncratic technology creates a natural world.</blockquote><p>By writing detailed instruction sets and using tactics like <a href="https://www.elastic.co/what-is/semantic-search?ref=bramadams.dev">semantic search</a> and <a href="https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/function-calling?ref=bramadams.dev#:~:text=Function%20calling%20is%20a%20powerful,with%20external%20APIs%20and%20services.">function calling</a>, LLMs <strong>leverage</strong> the effort of the individual into emergent and complex processes. </p><p>This <strong>leverage</strong> is the same leverage that made personal computing so ubiquitous, so quickly. The leverage created a new asset class, data. It gave us (you and me) superpowers of communication, and those of us who could communicate with the programs themselves (programmers) found themselves solving problems that gave them access to near limitless wealth.</p><blockquote>It’s cheaper to reuse existing software components than to write code from scratch, which also makes it possible for entrepreneurs to start software companies with fewer up-front costs. The entire software industry owes its financial success to leveraging this arbitrage.</blockquote><p><em>-- Working in Public: The Making and Maintenance of Open Source Software</em></p><h3 id="personal-library-science-is-leverage-for-ones-library">Personal Library Science Is Leverage For One's Library</h3><p>Personal Library Science is the <strong>leverage of LLM technology, applied to a personal library.</strong> </p><p>A <em>personal</em> <em>library</em> differs from a <em>impersonal</em> <em>library</em> in the fact that a personal library is an <strong>interpretation</strong> of a source material. These interpretations include: photographs from different photographers at the same event, or favorite scenes from a movie, or favorite passages from books, parts of songs that bring you to tears, etc. Importantly, these interpretations create unique sets that go on to create unique problems which require unique, idiosyncratic solutions. Sound familiar?</p><blockquote>While a painting or a prose description can never be other than a narrowly selective interpretation, a photograph can be treated as a narrowly selective transparency. But despite the presumption of veracity that gives all photographs authority, interest, seductiveness, the work that photographers do is no generic exception to the usually shady commerce between art and truth. Even when photographers are most concerned with mirroring reality, they are still haunted by tacit imperatives of taste and conscience. The immensely gifted members of the Farm Security Administration photographic project of the late 1930s (among them Walker Evans, Dorothea Lange, Ben Shahn, Russell Lee) would take dozens of frontal pictures of one of their sharecropper subjects until satisfied that they had gotten just the right look on film—the precise expression on the subject’s face that supported their own notions about poverty, light, dignity, texture, exploitation, and geometry. In deciding how a picture should look, in preferring one exposure to another, photographers are always imposing standards on their subjects. Although there is a sense in which the camera does indeed capture reality, not just interpret it, photographs are as much an interpretation of the world as paintings and drawings are. Those occasions when the taking of photographs is relatively undiscriminating, promiscuous, or self-effacing do not lessen the didacticism of the whole enterprise. This very passivity—and ubiquity—of the photographic record is photography’s “message,” its aggression.</blockquote><p><em>-- On Photography</em></p><figure><img src="https://www.bramadams.dev/content/images/2024/04/Poor-Jo-by-Earl-of-Carlisle.jpeg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="848" height="1200" srcset="https://www.bramadams.dev/content/images/size/w600/2024/04/Poor-Jo-by-Earl-of-Carlisle.jpeg 600w, https://www.bramadams.dev/content/images/2024/04/Poor-Jo-by-Earl-of-Carlisle.jpeg 848w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>In <a href="https://www.bramadams.dev/issue-54/">issue #54</a>, I wrote: </p><blockquote>...personal library science is focused on&nbsp;<strong>your relationship with your information</strong>. How do we&nbsp;<strong>store</strong>&nbsp;information so that it useful at a later date? How do we&nbsp;<strong>transform</strong>&nbsp;our information into new valuable assets in different creative domains? How do we do all of this while being flexible enough for the idiosyncrasies, proclivities, likes and dislikes of&nbsp;<strong>eight billion distinct individuals</strong>? How do we <strong>chronicle</strong> the information diet of a single person as they learn new things, interact with the world at different phases in their life? How do we make sure we can <strong>pass down</strong> our best knowledge to generations below?</blockquote><p>Many of these questions were asked and solved by the existence of personal computing. The existence of software has had a foundational impact on the types of solutions we can create to solve these large, incalculable problems. By solving them over and over in slightly different ways that make sense to an individual the problem eventually dissolves. </p><p>In fact, I'd argue that the history of personal computing teaches us that <strong><em>all top down solutions are less complete – and therefore less useful – than bottom up emergent solutions</em></strong>.</p><p>The issue is that we are now deluged with data, our interpreter antenna is going haywire trying to calculate, to store, to relate, to understand.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.affuture.org/post/9-context/">https://www.affuture.org/post/9-context/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40192204">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>California legislators, under the influence of Effective Altruism activists, are trying to sneak through a disastrous bill for open-source AI and the technology industry generally.</p>
<p>SB 1047 creates an unaccountable Frontier Model Division that will be staffed by EAs with police powers, and which can throw model developers in jail for the thoughtcrime of doing AI research. It’s being fast-tracked through the state Senate. Since many cloud and AI companies are headquartered in California, this will have worldwide impact.</p>
<p>We need your help to stop this now. It only takes a few minutes, and three steps, but you need to do them soon, ideally this week. Non-California residents are very welcome to comment, and indeed many of the supporters are not from California.</p>
<p>1. Submit a position letter to the bill author, which ensures that your position shows up on all future bill analyses that state Senators read. Go to <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB1047">https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB1047</a>, click on “Comments to the Author”, register an account and submit an opposition letter.</p>
<p>Use your own words for the letter, and feel free to borrow liberally from or cite friend of AFTF Context Fund’s analysis of the bill (<a href="https://www.context.fund/policy/sb_1047_analysis.html">https://www.context.fund/policy/sb_1047_analysis.html</a>). One of key arguments being advanced is that this is “pro-little guy”, so if you’re involved in the open source movement, are a startup founder, or an investor, heavily cite your experience and how the bill affects you personally.</p>
<p>If it’s still before May 5th, also submit comments to the Senate Appropriations Committee: <a href="https://sapro.senate.ca.gov/position-letters">https://sapro.senate.ca.gov/position-letters</a>. Unfortunately, you have to submit to both the committee and the author to make sure the position letter is fully considered at the hearing.</p>
<p>2. Also add your public comment to the Context Fund analysis document (<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rk8uRTs0tiQ8O4k6ZVkwnOQX5n2PSdFhh0sXeXoDNM4/edit">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rk8uRTs0tiQ8O4k6ZVkwnOQX5n2PSdFhh0sXeXoDNM4/edit</a>).</p>
<p>3. Tell your friends about this and introduce it to the media, publications you are connected to, and your own social media followings, especially those serving the ML, tech and startup audiences.</p>
<p>Most builders and investors who would be affected by this bill are not aware of it, but the special interests are. We need to change that quickly.</p>
<p>Thank you for your help!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto"><p>Until recently, the dominance of ultra-processed food and alcohol companies has seemed unassailable. With corporate food engineers cranking out more and more hyper-palatable products, the negative health impacts seemed to only be moving in one direction.&nbsp; The tide might be about to turn.</p><p><span>Morgan Stanley recently did a survey of people taking GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic or Mounjaro.&nbsp; CNBC and Quartz got private looks at the survey results.&nbsp; </span><a href="https://qz.com/ozempic-drugs-alcohol-tobacco-use-1851430022" rel="">Quartz wrote</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p>The investment bank also surveyed about 300 GLP-1 users about their consumption habits while taking the medication. Analysts at the bank have previously cautioned that the growing use of GLP-1s will put some longterm pressure on fast food sales, as users have reported spending less money at restaurants…</p><p>While 40% of survey respondents said they smoked cigarettes at least weekly before starting a GLP-1 treatment, that number fell to 24% after they started the treatment. Meanwhile, weekly e-cigarette usage dropped from 30% of respondents to 16% after they started taking a GLP-1.</p><p>Morgan Stanley found similar results when it asked respondents about their use of alcohol. About 56-62% of alcohol consumers on GLP-1s reported drinking less alcohol since starting the medications, with about 14-18% cutting their alcohol consumption entirely.</p></blockquote><p><span>And here’s how </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/20/weight-loss-drug-patients-spend-less-on-restaurants-takeout-survey.html" rel="">CNBC reported it</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p>The findings add to the mounting concerns that soaring demand for GLP-1s could take a bite out of the bottom lines of some of the biggest restaurant companies and makers of packaged snacks like Doritos, Oreos and Hershey’s Kisses. GLP-1s include Novo Nordisk’s blockbuster weight loss injection Wegovy and diabetes counterpart Ozempic, along with Eli Lilly’s popular weight loss treatment Zepbound and diabetes injection Mounjaro.&nbsp;</p><p>The rising demand for these four drugs isn’t expected to ease anytime soon. In the new survey, Morgan Stanley analysts said they expect the market for GLP-1s to be worth $105 billion by 2030. They also estimate that 31.5 million people, or around 9% of the U.S. population, will take GLP-1s by 2035.&nbsp;</p><p>“There is growing evidence that the drugs have a meaningful impact on consumer behavior and spending on groceries and restaurants,” Morgan Stanley analysts said in the survey. “All of these dynamics suggest GLP-1 drugs’ impact across consumer sectors is set to increase as drug uptake grows and the drugs reshape behavior among a demographic group that represents a disproportionate share of calorie consumption.”</p></blockquote><p><span>It’s pretty amazing that a reporter can write with a straight face that people eating less Doritos and Oreos is a ‘mounting concern’!&nbsp; Will CNBC soon report ‘mounting concerns’ that Purdue Pharma’s sales of OxyContin could decline?  This survey is not exactly ‘science’ but it aligns with </span><a href="https://curingaddiction.substack.com/p/27-reddit-users-describe-how-ozempic" rel="">patient reports</a><span> and </span><a href="https://curingaddiction.substack.com/p/news-roundup-will-glp-1-drugs-revolutionize" rel="">recent studies</a><span> showing a broad reduction in cravings for food and substances among patients taking GLP-1s.</span></p><p>If GLP-1s prove effective for addiction, Alzheimer’s disease, depression, and anxiety–areas being studied and showing promise– the percentage of the population taking using them could far exceed 9%.&nbsp;&nbsp;While replacing a dependence on corporate processed food brands with a dependence on big pharma might sound like a mixed blessing, the broad health, longevity, and mortality benefits for those eligible appear to overwhelmingly justify the trade-off.  As more GLP-1 competitors come to market and prices fall, the benefit to the public will easily outweigh the costs.  </p><p><span>There are also opportunities for regulators, particularly in the US, to impose price controls on GLP-1s that ensure equitable access across class and race.  States that are </span><a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/02/16/ozempic-weight-loss-drugs-medicaid-coverage-glp-1" rel="">restricting medicaid access</a><span> to GLP-1s for weight loss are exacerbating the already vast health outcome inequalities in the United States. A policy of cost-restriction and access guarantees would bring massive public health benefits.</span></p><p>We are doing in-depth research on GLP-1 studies of addiction and mental health and will be publishing more articles soon on the science and medical uses.&nbsp; We hope you will share and subscribe (it’s free).</p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://curingaddiction.substack.com/p/growing-concerns-that-ozempic-will?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://curingaddiction.substack.com/p/growing-concerns-that-ozempic-will?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p><p>For more of our writing and research on GLP-1 and addiction, please subscribe (it’s free!) and see these recent articles:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://curingaddiction.substack.com/p/ozempic-is-showing-us-that-a-cure" rel="">Ozempic is Showing Us That a Cure for Addiction is Possible</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://curingaddiction.substack.com/p/news-roundup-will-glp-1-drugs-revolutionize" rel="">News Roundup: Will GLP-1s Revolutionize Addiction Treatment?</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://curingaddiction.substack.com/p/27-reddit-users-describe-how-ozempic" rel="">27 patients describe how Ozempic and Mounjaro reduced their urge to drink alcohol</a></p></li></ul><p>If you are interested in getting involved with our group, we are always looking for PhD, MD, and other experts in the field of addiction to join the effort.

  <p id="DZi9yh">Cars, you might have noticed, have <a href="https://www.vox.com/videos/2023/7/25/23807518/cars-suvs-americans-big-automobiles-travel">grown enormous</a>.</p>
<p id="Ogo4DO">Low-slung station wagons are <a href="https://theweek.com/politics/1000830/bring-back-station-wagons">all but extinct</a> on American roads, and even sedans have become an endangered species. (Ford, producer of the iconic Model T a century ago, <a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/448349/ford-explains-killing-off-sedan/">no longer sells any sedans</a> in its home market.) Bulky SUVs and pickup trucks — which have themselves steadily<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2019/12/27/suvs-gm-ford-toyota-chevrolet/4408728002/"> added pounds and inches</a> — now comprise more than <a href="https://jalopnik.com/trucks-and-suvs-are-now-over-80-percent-of-new-car-sale-1848427797">four out of every five new cars sold</a> in the US, up from just over half in 2013, even as national household size <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/183648/average-size-of-households-in-the-us/">steadily declines</a>.</p>

<p id="fF4PSD">The expanding size of automobiles — <a href="https://slate.com/business/2023/12/cars-trucks-suv-sales-electric-safety-risk.html">a phenomenon I call car bloat</a> — has deepened a slew of national problems. Take road safety: <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2022-11-03/why-us-traffic-safety-fell-so-far-behind-other-countries">Unlike peer nations</a>, the US has endured a steep rise in traffic deaths, with fatalities among pedestrians and cyclists, who are at <a href="https://apnews.com/article/pedestrian-cyclist-deaths-safe-cars-afcf8e6fd1b1cbfbd1a5360a29f08308#:~:text=%E2%80%9CMany%20studies%20have%20shown%20that,organs%2C%20rather%20than%20the%20legs.">elevated risk</a> in a crash with a huge car, recently hitting <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-says-traffic-deaths-fell-slightly-first-nine-months-2022-2023-01-09/">40-year highs</a>. Vehicle occupants face danger as well. A <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15389588.2019.1632442">2019 study</a> concluded that compared to a smaller vehicle, an SUV or a pickup colliding with a smaller car was 28 percent and 159 percent, respectively, more likely to kill that car’s driver.</p>
<p id="UmXKlY">Car bloat also threatens the planet. Because heavier vehicles require more energy to move, they tend to gulp rather than sip the gasoline or electricity that powers them, increasing greenhouse gas emissions. Extra weight also accelerates the erosion of <a href="https://slate.com/business/2023/06/electric-vehicles-auto-haulers-weight-capacity-roads.html">roadways</a> and <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2023/11/car-tires-6ppd-pollution-epa.html">tires</a>, straining highway maintenance budgets and releasing microplastics that damage ecosystems.</p>

<p id="el1OJ7">What lies behind this shift? Some Americans prefer bigger cars, especially when gas prices are low, for their ample storage space, ability to see over other vehicles on the road, and perceived safety benefits (more on that later). But shifting consumer demands tell only part of the story.</p>
<p id="4Klv9c">For half a century, a litany of federal policies has favored large SUVs and trucks, pushing automakers and American buyers toward larger models. Instead of counteracting car bloat through regulation, policymakers have subtly encouraged it. That has been a boon for car companies, but a disaster for everyone else.</p>
<p id="zdEawh">Here are some of the most egregious examples.</p>
<h3 id="ZsvvYC">Why we let bigger cars pollute more</h3>
<p id="FFBhtm">After the 1970s OPEC oil embargo triggered a spike in gas prices, the federal government adopted an array of policies intended to reduce energy demand.</p>
<p id="Cvt5Af">One of Congress’s most consequential moves was creating the <a href="https://www.transportation.gov/mission/sustainability/corporate-average-fuel-economy-cafe-standards#:~:text=First%20enacted%20by%20Congress%20in,of%20cars%20and%20light%20trucks.">Corporate Average Fuel Economy</a> (CAFE) standards, which require that the average fuel economy (miles per gallon, or MPG) of a carmaker’s vehicles remain below a set threshold.</p>
<p id="OI4H7Q"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/High-Mighty-Dangerous-Rise-Suv/dp/B000A176P6" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/High-Mighty-Dangerous-Rise-Suv/dp/B000A176P6?ascsubtag=___vx__p_23903188__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:99,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;ascsubtag&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;ascsubtag&quot;:&quot;___vx__p_23903188__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}">Pressed by auto lobbyists</a>, Congress made a fateful decision when it established CAFE. Instead of setting a single fuel economy standard that applies to all cars, CAFE has two of them: one for passenger cars, such as sedans and station wagons, and a separate, more lenient standard for “light trucks,” including pickups and SUVs. In 1982, for instance, the <a href="https://afdc.energy.gov/data/10562">CAFE standard</a> for passenger cars was 24 mpg and only 17.5 mpg for light trucks. </p>
<p id="W24lfu">That dual structure didn’t initially seem like a big deal, because in the 1970s SUVs and trucks together accounted for <a href="https://www.autoweek.com/news/a2108816/definition-truck-cafe-loophole-critics-say/">less than a quarter </a>of new cars sold. But as gas prices fell in the 1980s, the “light truck loophole” encouraged automakers to shift away from sedans and churn out more pickups and SUVs (which were also more profitable). </p>
<p id="f8gRdx">Car ads of the 1980s and 1990s frequently featured owners of SUVs and trucks <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=349512193261157">taking family trips</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9fYfKlPltI">going out with friends</a>, activities that could also be done in a sedan or station wagon. The messaging seemed to resonate: By 2002, light trucks comprised <a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/vehicles/fact-714-february-13-2012-light-truck-sales-rise">more than half of new car sales</a>.</p>
<p id="14FtbS">In the early 2000s, the federal government made these distortions even worse.</p>
<p id="wxXTXh">During the George W. Bush administration, CAFE was <a href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/fact-sheets/2011/04/20/driving-to-545-mpg-the-history-of-fuel-economy">revised</a> to further loosen rules for the biggest cars by tying a car model’s efficiency standard to its physical footprint (which is basically the shadow cast by the vehicle when the sun is directly above it). President Obama then incorporated <a href="https://www.greencarcongress.com/2009/05/obama-announces-new-national-fuel-policy-two-harmonized-standards-with-fleet-average-of-355-mpg-250-.html">similar footprint rules </a>into new greenhouse gas emissions standards that are overseen by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).</p>
<p id="HCO78I">Dan Becker, who led the Sierra Club’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate" data-source="encore">global warming</a> program from 1989 to 2007, told me that he and others <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna30327904">warned</a> federal lawmakers that adopting footprint-based standards was a mistake. “People like me were saying, ‘give carmakers another loophole and they’ll use it,’” he said. “But we lost.” </p>
<p id="yKEYkZ">Those concerns proved justified. The average vehicle footprint expanded 6 percent between 2008 and 2023, a “historic high,” according to an <a href="https://www.epa.gov/automotive-trends/download-automotive-trends-report">EPA report</a>, which also found that some carmakers, such as General Motors, actually had lower average fuel economy and higher average carbon emissions in 2022 than in 2017. To its credit, the EPA recently announced <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/20/climate/biden-phase-out-gas-cars.html">revisions</a> to its vehicle GHG rules that would narrow (but not close) the gaps between standards for large and small cars.</p>
<p id="UWQqBt">But the shift toward <a href="https://www.vox.com/electric-vehicles" data-source="encore">electric vehicles</a> may further entrench car bloat. The EPA’s rules assume that all EVs, regardless of their design, generate no emissions — a questionable assumption, because EVs create emissions indirectly through the production and transmission of power that flows into their <a href="https://www.vox.com/batteries" data-source="encore">batteries</a>. A huge or inefficient battery requires more electricity, which can lead to significant pollution (especially in regions where <a href="https://www.vox.com/fossil-fuels" data-source="encore">fossil fuels</a> dominate the energy mix). </p>
<p id="VLqKd6">The EPA’s policy of treating all EVs equally makes a monstrously wasteful vehicle <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90790197/yes-to-electric-cars-but-not-the-hummer-ev">like the Hummer EV</a> seem cleaner than it is, encouraging carmakers to manufacture more of them. </p>
<p id="hbwZCy">To counteract EV bloat, Peter Huether, a senior research associate at the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, would like to see the EPA revise its GHG rules to consider emissions from power generation and transmission: “If these standards look at upstream emissions, it could have a downstream effect on shape and size of EVs.” </p>
<h3 id="tpqxH3">Blocking smaller cars from abroad</h3>
<p id="LtlL12">What does a 60-year-old trade dispute have to do with car bloat? More than you might imagine.</p>
<p id="tKiFnM">In the early 1960s, Europe <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1964/01/10/archives/the-chicken-war-a-battle-guide.html">raised the ire</a> of American officials by slapping a 50 percent tariff on chicken exported from the United States. In retaliation, the US enacted a 25 percent tax on pickup trucks imported from abroad. The dispute is long forgotten, but the “Chicken Tax” lives on.</p>
<p id="LW144y">Although the tariff was initially aimed at Germany’s immense auto industry (<a href="https://rodrik.typepad.com/dani_rodriks_weblog/2009/05/the-chickens-have-come-home-to-roost.html">Volkswagen in particular</a>), it also applies to pickups imported from newer automaking powers such as Japan and South Korea, where carmakers are often adept at building vehicles much smaller than those available to Americans. </p>
<p id="SeqRZ5">Toyota’s <a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/cars/toyota-hilux-double-cab-2020.html#aeng_toyota-hilux-double-cab-2020-24l-d-4d-6mt-150-hp">Hilux Double Cab pickup</a>, for instance, weighs several hundred pounds less than a 2024 <a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/ford/f-150">Ford F-150 Tremor or Lariat</a> and is about half a foot shorter. But Americans who might want it are out of luck. Toyota does not sell the Hilux in the US (but does in countries like <a href="https://www.toyotabharat.com/showroom/hilux/">India</a> and <a href="https://www.toyota.co.uk/new-cars/hilux">Britain</a>); the 25 percent tariff would make it prohibitively expensive.</p>
<p id="GJgd8v">“The Chicken Tax has prevented competitive Asian or European truck makers from entering the US market,” said Jason Torchinsky, a co-founder of the Autopian, a media outlet focused on the auto industry. “American manufacturers have really never had to compete.” John Krafcik, who previously led Hyundai, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2015/06/19/415671756/how-a-tax-on-chicken-changed-the-playing-field-for-u-s-automakers">has called</a> the Chicken Tax “one of the most important determinants of how the [auto] industry looks today and how it operates today in the US.” </p>
<p id="VXeqPf">The tariff has been condemned by everyone from the Libertarian <a href="https://www.cato.org/blog/hidden-costs-tariffs#:~:text=In%20retaliation%2C%20President%20Lyndon%20B,tax%20on%20light%20trucks%20remains.">Cato Institute</a>, the center-right <a href="https://www.aei.org/carpe-diem/the-anti-consumer-25-chicken-tax-on-imported-trucks-has-insulated-the-big-3-from-foreign-competition-for-50-years/">American Enterprise Institute</a>, and the left-leaning <a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/does-chicken-tax-encourage-people-purchase-larger-trucks">Tax Policy Center</a>. “Tariffs in general hurt consumers, and the Chicken Tax is no exception,” wrote Robert McClelland of the Tax Policy Center.</p>
<p id="xcYkLf">There are other protectionist rules blocking smaller vehicles from abroad: Carmakers from China, an emerging automaking behemoth, face a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-lawmakers-want-biden-hike-tariffs-chinese-made-vehicles-2023-11-08/">25 percent tariff</a> enacted by Donald Trump. As a result, Americans <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/2024/3/4/24087919/biden-tariff-chinese-ev-byd-battery-detroit">cannot buy small Chinese EV sedans</a> like the BYD Seagull that cost around $10,000, <a href="https://www.livenowfox.com/news/average-price-for-new-car-used-falling-us-2024">barely a fifth</a> the price of an average American car. </p>

<p id="Pk5DuO">And those hoping to import a kei truck, a miniature pickup common in Japan, must navigate a labyrinth of <a href="https://keitruckconnect.com/how-to-import-a-kei-truck-into-the-usa/#:~:text=If%20you're%20looking%20to,year%20exemption%20rule%20for%20importation.">federal</a> and <a href="https://www.11alive.com/article/travel/miniature-japanese-imports-owners-hire-laywer-legislature-fails/85-f707d2b4-d82a-4c35-8535-f5130b2ae7a2">state</a> rules. (Even Afghanistan seems ahead of the US in minitruck offerings, as the Wichita Eagle’s Dion Lefler noted in a <a href="https://www.kansas.com/opinion/opn-columns-blogs/dion-lefler/article274837471.html">tongue-in-cheek 2023 </a>column: “In the land of the free, why can’t we have mini-pickup trucks like the Taliban?”)</p>
<p id="LEZdYh">These policies have established a regulatory moat protecting US automakers whose profits <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/21/business/suv-sales-best-sellers.html">disproportionately come from pricey, hulking SUVs and trucks</a>. </p>
<h3 id="suXAIE">The Hummer Tax Loophole</h3>
<p id="7ciqVw"><a href="https://www.taxnotes.com/research/federal/legislative-documents/public-laws-and-legislative-history/deficit-reduction-act-of-1984-p.l-98-369-div-a/dsyf">In 1984</a>, Congress stopped allowing small business owners to take a tax deduction for the purchase price of cars used for work. But the bill included a giant loophole: To protect those who need a heavy-duty vehicle (think farmers or construction workers), Congress made an exception, known as Section 179, for cars that weigh over 6,000 pounds when fully loaded with passengers and cargo. Today such behemoths are eligible for a <a href="https://www.irs.gov/publications/p946#:~:text=Section%20179%20deduction%20dollar%20limits.,-For%20tax%20years&amp;text=deduction%20is%20%241%2C220%2C000.-,This%20limit%20is%20reduced%20by%20the%20amount%20by%20which%20the,beginning%20in%202024%20is%20%2430%2C500.">tax deduction of up to $30,500</a>, while business owners who opt for a smaller car can claim nothing at all.</p>
<p id="a4drJE">Few car models were heavy enough to qualify for the tax break 40 years ago, but that is no longer the case: A<a href="https://www.hummer1.com/specs"> Hummer 1, for instance,</a> weighs about 10,300 pounds (leading Section 179 to be dubbed the “<a href="https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/5476-section-179.html">Hummer Tax Loophole</a>”). Other huge cars, such as a <a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/chevrolet/suburban-2024/specs">Chevrolet Suburban</a> or an <a href="https://www.ford.com/trucks/super-duty/models/f250-xlt/">F-250 Ford Super Duty truck</a> can qualify, too. </p>
<p id="gWou5F">“Few folks at EPA know about Section 179,” said Becker, the former Sierra Club executive. “But every auto dealer does.” Some car dealerships even offer <a href="https://www.kengrodyfordsandiego.com/ford-section-179-tax-deduction-san-diego-ca-dtw/">handy Section 179 guides</a> on their websites. The tax advantage of buying a behemoth may be powerful enough to tilt the vehicle purchase decisions of individuals like <a href="https://corofy.com/can-real-estate-agents-take-section-179-deductions-for-specialized-equipment-vehicles/#:~:text=Section%20179%20deduction.-,This%20deduction%20allows%20real%20estate%20agents%20to%20deduct%20the%20full,to%20succeed%20in%20their%20industry.">real estate agents</a>, who use their vehicles for both professional and personal use. And as cars electrify, the added tonnage from batteries will allow more models to qualify for favorable tax treatment.</p>
<p id="6JYKqq">If Section 179 sounds crazy, consider another federal loophole that has endured for decades. <a href="https://www.epa.gov/fueleconomy/gas-guzzler-tax">In 1978</a>, Congress established the “Gas Guzzler Tax,” requiring automakers to pay <a href="https://www.kbb.com/car-advice/gas-guzzler-tax/">between $1,000 and $7,700</a> for every car produced that gets less than 22.5 miles per gallon. But the tax only applies to passenger vehicles like sedans and station wagons. SUVs and pickups, which often have much worse gas mileage, are exempt. That omission makes no sense from a policy perspective, but it is good news for carmakers producing inefficient behemoths.</p>
<h3 id="A1jVfR">Freezing the gas tax</h3>
<p id="avZwl2">Every time a car owner fills her gas tank, a portion of the bill goes into the federal <a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/what-highway-trust-fund-and-how-it-financed">Highway Trust Fund</a>, a central source of funding for roads and <a href="https://www.vox.com/transportation" data-source="encore">mass transit</a>. That tax rate is set at $0.184 per gallon, a level that has <a href="https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/gastax.cfm#:~:text=The%20Omnibus%20Budget%20Reconciliation%20Act,to%20the%20Highway%20Trust%20Fund.">been frozen since 1993</a>, when Bill Clinton was less than a year into his presidency. Congressional proposals to increase the gas tax to close a <a href="https://enotrans.org/article/running-on-empty-the-highway-trust-fund/">yawning highway budget gap</a>, or at least tie it to inflation, have <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/transportation/2021/06/11/infrastructure-bill-gas-tax-faq/">gone nowhere</a>. </p>
<p id="97MZwn">Over the last 31 years, consumer prices have risen <a href="https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/">113 percent</a>, making the real value of the gas tax less than half what it was in 1993. That decline has reduced the cost of powering a huge SUV or truck with abysmal gas mileage, like the 6,270-lb 2024 Cadillac Escalade that gets around <a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/cadillac/escalade-escalade-esv">16 mpg</a>.</p>
<p id="dckPbz">A <a href="https://taxfoundation.org/data/all/federal/oecd-gas-tax/">2018 OECD study</a> found that the US had the lowest average gas tax (including both federal and state taxes) among rich nations, which averaged $2.24 per gallon — four times the typical US rate. “Why are European cars so small?” said McClelland, of the Tax Policy Center. “One reason has got to be the much higher gasoline tax.” </p>
<h3 id="zd7OaT">Federal policy ignores crash risk for anyone outside a car</h3>
<p id="Wk5ERo">A vehicle’s design affects not just the safety of its occupants, but also people walking, biking, or inside other cars. Although seemingly obvious, this basic truth has eluded federal regulators for decades.</p>
<p id="O9UiWt">Car safety rules are laid out in the encyclopedic Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS), which touches on everything from power windows to seat belts. But the FMVSS revolves around protecting a vehicle’s occupants; nothing within its <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Federal-Standards-Regulations-Amendments-Interpretations/dp/1379016444" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Federal-Standards-Regulations-Amendments-Interpretations/dp/1379016444?ascsubtag=___vx__p_23903188__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:99,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;ascsubtag&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;ascsubtag&quot;:&quot;___vx__p_23903188__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}">562 pages</a> limits a car’s physical design to protect someone who might come into contact with it in a collision. That omission invites <a href="https://slate.com/business/2022/11/suv-size-truck-bloat-pedestrian-deaths.html">an arms race of vehicle size</a> — precisely what the US is experiencing.</p>
<p id="CNPeic">Nor does the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) consider pedestrians, cyclists, or other car occupants when calculating its safety ratings from crash tests. Unlike safety ratings in Europe and elsewhere, the American crash ratings program also <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-18/fix-the-crash-test-dummies">ignores</a> the danger that vehicle designs pose to those walking and biking.</p>
<p id="knrFhp">NHTSA’s myopic focus on car occupants is a boon for the heaviest and tallest cars, which pose disproportionate risk to those outside of them. Weightier vehicles exert more force in a crash, and they require additional time to come to a halt when a driver slams on the brakes. A <a href="https://www.iihs.org/news/detail/vehicles-with-higher-more-vertical-front-ends-pose-greater-risk-to-pedestrians">2023 study</a> by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) found that vehicles with tall, flat front ends (common on big pickups and SUVs) are significantly more likely to kill pedestrians in crashes. <a href="https://www.iihs.org/news/detail/suvs-other-large-vehicles-often-hit-pedestrians-while-turning#:~:text=%E2%80%9CIt's%20possible%20that%20the%20size,Senior%20Transportation%20Engineer%20Wen%20Hu.">An earlier IIHS study</a> found that large cars also make it harder to see pedestrians at intersections.</p>

<p id="OnQvlU">With pedestrian and cyclist deaths <a href="https://www.vox.com/23784549/pedestrian-deaths-traffic-safety-fatalities-governors-association">now soaring</a>, NHTSA last year took its first, tentative step toward protecting so-called vulnerable road users by proposing that <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/press-releases/nhtsa-proposes-new-crashworthiness-pedestrian-protection-testing-program">its vehicle safety ratings be revised</a> to include an evaluation of automatic pedestrian braking technology, which can force a vehicle to halt before striking someone on foot. But even if adopted, it would not affect NCAP’s 5-star safety rating, the hallmark of the program.  </p>
<p id="pWciBT">And NHTSA’s focus on automatic pedestrian braking, an imperfect tech fix, ignores car bloat, a root cause of America’s traffic safety crisis. Earlier this year, a <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/377261425_Unreliable_Pedestrian_Detection_and_Driver_Alerting_in_Intelligent_Vehicles">paper</a> co-authored by former NHTSA executive Missy Cummings gave an ominous <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/377261425_Unreliable_Pedestrian_Detection_and_Driver_Alerting_in_Intelligent_Vehicles">assessment</a> of automatic braking systems, concluding that they did not work consistently. By contrast, the potential safety benefits of constraining vehicles’ <a href="https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/808569">weight</a> and <a href="https://www.iihs.org/news/detail/vehicles-with-higher-more-vertical-front-ends-pose-greater-risk-to-pedestrians#:~:text=Vehicles%20with%20hoods%20more%20than,of%2030%20inches%20or%20less.">height</a> have been well established.</p>
<h3 id="IfGpBy">Why can’t we fix things?</h3>
<p id="AmGQZ4">All of these policies have distorted the US car market, leading the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/car-ownership-statistics/#:~:text=Sources-,National%20Car%20Ownership%20Statistics%20at%20a%20Glance,in%20the%20U.S.%20in%202022.">278 million vehicles</a> plying American roads to become ever bigger, more dangerous, and more destructive. So why have they remained on the books after the growing societal costs of car bloat became impossible to miss?</p>
<p id="rOzXDp">To find an answer, consider who benefits from oversized vehicles. American carmakers like Ford and GM (which are headquartered in Michigan, a crucial swing state) rely on juicy margins from big SUVs and pickups, which are more expensive and <a href="https://www.ttnews.com/articles/plunging-pickup-truck-sales">profitable</a> than smaller models. They enjoy protection from foreign competition through tariffs like the Chicken Tax, as well as favorable policies like CAFE’s light-truck loophole. </p>
<p id="wTy7jU">The regulatory status quo suits domestic automakers just fine — and they act as a roadblock to even modest attempts to change it. In 2022, for example, the largest auto industry association <a href="https://x.com/DavidZipper/status/1532427288792518657?s=20">lobbied</a> District of Columbia council members against a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-26/a-new-way-to-curb-the-rise-of-oversized-pickups-and-suvs">proposal</a> to charge owners of the most egregiously oversized cars $500 per year, seven times more than a light sedan (the District adopted the policy anyway).</p>

<p id="6UhWi8">As American sales of big SUVs and trucks have surged, their owners are likely to resist policy moves they see as penalizing them. Many are likely to be unaware of the federal loopholes and policy oversights that have distorted their vehicle choices.</p>
<p id="92QZ6I">The negative externalities of supersized cars — in emissions, crash deaths, and the erosion of tires and pavement — are what economists call a market failure, since their costs are borne by society writ large, not the people who buy big pickups and SUVs. Left unaddressed, those societal costs will grow as more people replace their modest-sized cars with big SUVs or trucks. After all, everyone else seems to be doing it — why not do the same, if only for self-preservation?</p>
<p id="vNu1jQ">Regulation can end such a cycle toward enormity. Countries including <a href="https://www.rfi.fr/en/france/20201015-government-u-turn-as-france-slaps-weight-tax-on-heavy-cars-suvs-climate-pollution">France</a> and <a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/news/norway-became-an-ev-paradise-now-it-s-imposing-a-weight-tax-and-bringing-back-the-vat-200685.html#:~:text=EV%20owners%20will%20also%20have,powered%20cars%20(including%20hybrids)">Norway</a> have enacted weight-based taxes to counteract car bloat’s collective costs and avoid giving huge vehicles implicit subsidies. But American policymakers have done the exact opposite, and they rarely even acknowledge the problem. Asked explicitly about ways that the Department of Transportation could address car bloat, Secretary Pete Buttigieg <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90841997/this-is-a-preventable-crisis-pete-buttigieg-on-spending-800-million-to-eliminate-traffic-deaths">ducked</a>, calling merely for “further research.”</p>
<p id="Adhh7h">With the feds refusing to lead, it has fallen on state and local leaders to try and address car bloat themselves. <a href="https://www.cpr.org/2023/09/29/colorado-pedestrian-safety-suv-truck-owners/">Colorado</a> and <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/california/article/california-charge-owning-trucks-suvs-17771795.php">California</a>, for instance, have proposed weight-based vehicle registration fees, following the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-26/a-new-way-to-curb-the-rise-of-oversized-pickups-and-suvs">District of Columbia</a>’s lead. But such moves are an imperfect solution to a national problem (vehicles can, after all, be driven across state lines). A true policy fix will require action from Congress, NHTSA, and the EPA.  </p>
<p id="bgFcNL">It need not begin with new regulations or taxes. Federal leaders could do a world of good if they simply unwind the ill-advised policies already on the books.</p>

<h2>Workplace surveillance is coming for you (<a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/08/21/great-taylors-ghost/#solidarity-or-bust">permalink</a>)</h2>
<p>If you want to do something terrible with technology, you can't just roll it out on people with money and social capital. They'll complain and your idea will tank. Successful shitty tech rollouts start with people you can abuse with impunity (prisoners, kids, migrants, etc) and then work their way up the privilege gradient. I call it the Shitty Technology Adoption Curve.</p>
<p>The point of the Shitty Technology Adoption Curve is to normalize technological oppression, one group at a time. 20 years ago, if you were eating your dinner under the unblinking eye of a video-camera, it was because you were in a supermax prison. Now, thanks to "luxury surveillance," you can get the same experience in your middle-class home with your Google, Apple or Amazon "smart" camera. Those cameras climbed the curve, going from prisons to schools to workplaces to homes.</p>
<p>The pandemic was a great accelerant for late-stage capitalism, converting our homes to rent-free annexes of our employers' facilities, and turning "work from home" into "live at work." Bossware, a fringe technological category, experienced a massive boom, rocketing up the privilege gradient.</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/02/24/gwb-rumsfeld-monsters/#bossware">https://pluralistic.net/2021/02/24/gwb-rumsfeld-monsters/#bossware</a></p>
<p>For most of its history, bossware was used to police the most marginalized, oppressed workers, like the mostly Black, mostly female workforce at Arise, a company that charges workers for their own training and then fines them if they quit.</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/22/paperback-writer/#toothless">https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/22/paperback-writer/#toothless</a></p>
<p>But when lockdown turned high-status white collar workers into home-workers, their bosses rolled out incredibly invasive spyware, including tools that watched them through their cameras, listened to their microphones, logged their keystrokes, scoured their hard-drives and read their text messages.</p>
<p>This was the second coming of Taylorism, AKA "scientific management," an early 20th Century pseudoscience practiced by high-priced, unaccountable consultants who would fan out on factory floors in literal science cosplay, including lab-coats and clipboards, and loom over workers, watching their every movement, often going so far as to film them.</p>
<p>Then the consultants would go back to their workplace, soup the negatives, and produce completely arbitrary workplace rules about how workers must stand, hold their limbs and heads, and move – it was a kind of corporate anti-yoga whose asanas were designed to make workers <em>look</em> productive to their bosses, who often had no idea how to perform or evaluate their jobs.</p>
<p>The pandemic's new Taylorists do not confine themselves to the factory floor. Thanks to digital tools, they can come right into your home, and they can take high-frequency measurements of unimportant things in great detail, and then produce scores that your boss can use to decide whether and how much to pay you.</p>
<p>Bossware is the subject of an <em>excellent</em> <em>New York Times</em> feature by Jodi Kantor, Arya Sundaram, Aliza Aufrichtig and Rumsey Taylor, which documents the ways that "Worker Productivity Scores" undermine the workers' ability to perform their jobs, while also allowing their bosses to steal their wages:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/08/14/business/worker-productivity-tracking.html">https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/08/14/business/worker-productivity-tracking.html</a></p>
<p>Their case-studies are a trip up the Shitty Tech Adoption Curve, and includes $200/hour finance exec Carol Kraemer, who discovered that her boss was tracking her time in 10-minute increments and docking her pay for stretches where she took her fingers off her keyboard – to think, say, or make notes with pen and paper.</p>
<p>Kraemer discovered that the only way to avoid wage-theft was to do "mindless busywork" that produced the clicks that her bossware demanded, even if it got in the way of her work. This is yet more proof that "you treasure what you measure," or, more formally, "any measurement becomes a target" (AKA Goodhart's Law).</p>
<p>The decline of worker productivity in pursuit of metrics is an inescapable failure mode of bossware. In 2020, I reported on a reader's experience working in an engineering shop where her boss evaluated her performance based on the number of trouble-tickets she closed, turning her into "a ticket-closing machine."</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/08/absolutely-remarkable-thing/#goodhartism">https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/08/absolutely-remarkable-thing/#goodhartism</a></p>
<p>Being an engineer, this worker applied herself to the problem in a methodical fashion, and realized that she could juke her stats by closing tickets prematurely by marking them "did not respond" – and also that she could close and re-open the same tickets over and over, racking up points.</p>
<p>She closed by saying, "Your execs should fucking well know this: how would THEY like to be evaluated based on, like, how many emails they send in a day? Do they believe that would be good for the business? Or would they object that they are tasked with the holistic success of the org, and that their roles are too complex to reduce to a set of metrics without context?"</p>
<p>The irony, of course, is that bossware is now coming for execs, and, what's more, they lack the engineering skills to optimize their work so they can get a high score <em>and</em> do the job, so they have to settle for just getting the score – and hang the job itself.</p>
<p>In the <em>NYT</em> story, the authors profile a wide range of people who are deliberately doing a worse job in order to get higher scores, including a group of hospice chaplains who are given points based on their work with dying patients and their families, scored in a way that is utterly disconnected from providing compassionate care.</p>
<p>Activities are scored based on their priority to management, without regard to the comfort they provide: 0.25 points for a phone call with a grieving relation; one point for a visit with a dying patient, 1.75 points for presiding over a funeral.</p>
<p>Chaplains' ability to accumulate points was undermined by patients – who would take longer than anticipated to draw their final breaths, or break down in tears, or cancel appointments as they made their peace with their impending deaths. To maintain their wages, chaplains resorted to "spirtual care drive-bys" – like sticking their head in a room where a patient was unconscious, exchanging a brief word with a nurse, and marking it down as a "patient visit."</p>
<p>Healthcare offers a fascinating window into the Shitty Technology Adoption Curve, as doctors' and nurses' work has been transformed by the electronic health record and its relationship to billing – so that now these high-paid, high-demand, high-skill professionals have to organize their work around data-entry on a system designed without their input and without regard to their priorities.</p>
<p>The <em>Times</em> reporters dig into the social workers, therapists and addiction counselors at Unitedhealth, a private-equity-backed healthcare monopoly. They get marked as "idle" if they stop typing to talk with their patients. If those conversations go on too long, they are marked as "derelict" and risk employment sanctions.</p>
<p>Social workers with masters' degrees are compensated based on the number of keystrokes they generate on the job. For Unitedhealth admin workers who work from home, glitches in the system can imperil their jobs, for example, if the system hangs when you log out for the day, it can mark you as "idle" all night, killing your average score. Workers facing these problems are advised by their managers to jiggle their mouses periodically to keep the division's score from falling.</p>
<p>One of the most interesting part of the <em>Times</em> feature is the work it does profiling the pseudoscientists who created and marketed this junk software. There's Federico Mazzoli, co-creator of Worksmart, who explained the benefits of his product: "Once you see those metrics, those insights, something changes: You realize how much you waste doing nothing, or just multitasking and not accomplishing stuff."</p>
<p>Mazzoli seems to have either not used his product, or, if he did, did so under conditions where <em>he</em> was in charge of it – using it the way an athlete might use a stopwatch to time their own sprints, and not the way a boss might: to decide whether to dock your pay or fire you.</p>
<p>This inability to understand the difference between <em>using</em> a technology and having the same technology <em>used against you</em> is endemic to the industry. Take Crossover, which bills itself as "the Fitbit of productivity," but whose customers rhapsodize about the product giving them "powers of near X-ray vision." The point of a Fitbit is to help <em>you</em> improve something that matters to you – but Crossover's customers want to use it to <em>punish other people</em> for failing to follow orders. It's the difference between a Fitbit and a prisoner-tracking cuff – which make crossover "the ankle-braclet of productivity."</p>
<p>Ironically, the <em>Times</em> reports that Crossover's own employees so resented the company's intrusive monitoring of them (as they created and sold intrusive monitoring tools) that Crossover hemorrhaged employees and struggled to hire replacements. Eventually, Crossover had to turn off its most intrusive features so that it could keep the employees needed to make and sell its bossware product.</p>
<p>One major focus of "productivity trackers" is measuring bathroom breaks and punishing workers for pissing. Piss-tracking tools are another shitty technology that has been racing up the privilege gradient, making the leap to white-collar workers after being imposed on blue-collar workers, like the Amazon warehouse workers and drivers who have to piss in bottles to satisfy their bossware:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/03/19/the-shakedown/#weird-flex">https://pluralistic.net/2021/03/19/the-shakedown/#weird-flex</a></p>
<p>The next step on the gradient was students – children have slightly more privilege than nonunion blue-collar workers, it seems – with 1,000+ US schoools handing public money to E-hallpass, a company that tracks children's urination:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/dy73n7/ehallpass-1000-thousand-schools-monitor-bathroom">https://www.vice.com/en/article/dy73n7/ehallpass-1000-thousand-schools-monitor-bathroom</a></p>
<p>As the metaphor of corporate personhood has become more and more concrete (for example, through the Supreme Court's <em>Citizen's United</em> decision, which ruled that limits on corporate political spending violated their corporate persons' free speech rights) many have pondered the question, "What sort of person is a corporation?"</p>
<p>The 2003 documentary "The Corporation" investigated this, declaring the if corporations are people, they are psychopaths – remorseless and totally lacking in empathy. Science fiction writers have claimed that corporations are "slow AIs" (Charlie Stross), or Skynet (Ted Chiang) or immortal colony organisms that use humans as gut flora (me):</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/10/12/no-criminals-no-crimes/#get-out-of-jail-free-card">https://pluralistic.net/2021/10/12/no-criminals-no-crimes/#get-out-of-jail-free-card</a></p>
<p>But the rise and rise of bossware implies another personality archetype for the corporation: the abusive alcoholic dad, whose own life is spinning out of control and who finds comfort by seeking to control the lives of others in humiliating ways that ultimately leads to his own destruction.</p>
<p>Because bossware doesn't just radically reduce productivity by shifting the point of work from getting the job done to getting the boxes ticked – it also exposes the businesses who use it to existential risks. Take Office 365, the cloud-based word processing/spreadsheet/email system from convicted monopolist Microsoft.</p>
<p>Office 365 went from being an online version of Microsoft Office to being a bossware delivery-system. The Office 365 sales-pitch focuses on fine-grained employee tracking and comparison, so bosses can rank their workers' performance against each other. But beyond this automated gladiatorial keystroke combat, Offce 365's analytics will tell you how your company performs against <em>other companies.</em></p>
<p>That's right – Microsoft will spy on your competitors and sell you access to their metrics. It's wild, but purchasing managers who hear this pitch seem completely oblivious to the implication of this: that Microsoft will also spy on <em>you</em> and deliver your metrics to your competitors.</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/11/25/the-peoples-amazon/#clippys-revenge">https://pluralistic.net/2020/11/25/the-peoples-amazon/#clippys-revenge</a></p>
<p>Even wilder is the further implication: that Microsoft might use the data its product gathers on your business – every keystroke made by every worker in the entire company! – to <em>compete</em> with <em>you</em>.</p>
<p>A century ago, "scientific management experts" tricked bosses out of fat consulting fees by promising to turn managers' preference for "a smartly turned out workforce" into a scientific best-practice. This is pure empiricism-washing, where an irrational bias is encoded in mathematics and declared to be scientific truth.</p>
<p>Bossware companies target employers' insecurity about their workers' power to actually undermine the employers' businesses, transforming productive workers into efficient metric-satisfiers, while raiding the company for valuable market-intelligence.</p>
<p>The bossware problem is a <em>boss</em> problem, in other words. It follows that fixing the bossware problem is the <em>workers'</em> job, and indeed, the <em>Times</em> feature notes that Amazon has been dismantling its bossware surveillance in a bid to reduce its workers' support for unionization, which promises to ban bossware from Amazon workplaces.</p>
<p>Bosses deride unions as reducing "freedom" – but just the <em>threat</em> of unions delivers more freedom to workers than any right-to-work law ever could. Bossware-infected jobsites are Stalinist dystopias, where workers are punished for <em>looking in the wrong direction</em> or failing to hit the keys fast enough, irrespective of whether they're getting the job done.</p>
<p>Back in 2019, I wrote about this in "Affordances," a short story for Slate Future Tense, which set out to explore how the Shitty Technology Adoption Curve may start with the most downtrodden and immiserated among us – but how, left unchecked, it will come for each and every one of us:</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>Williams-Sonoma could be paying a hefty fine for claiming a small chunk of its products were "Made in USA" when they weren't.</p><p>In a federal court filing on Monday, the Federal Trade Commission asked a judge to sign an order that would fine the luxury home goods company $3.18 million for violating a <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2020/07/ftc-approves-final-order-settling-charges-williams-sonoma-inc-made-overly-broad-misleading-made-usa" data-cms-ai="0">2020 order</a> regarding the same false label claims. Williams-Sonoma settled those charges and was required to pay $1 million to the FTC, and the following year, it submitted a report describing how it had complied with every provision in the order.</p><p>However, the FTC's new claims state the company has violated the order with multiple deceptive U.S.-origin claims in the years since — including on three products in July 2021, when it filed the compliance order.</p><p>One such claim, which the FTC says Williams-Sonoma made between April 2022 and August 2023, involved certain PBTeen mattress pads that were advertised as "crafted in America from domestic and imported materials." The federal body said in numerous instances, those products were actually "wholly imported" from China.</p><p>The FTC said this finding led them to discover six other products on the retailer's websites that were advertised as American-made despite either containing foreign components or being processed internationally. It states Williams-Sonoma couldn't demonstrate the validity of its own claims, and the retailer admitted to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/williams-sonoma-is-fined-by-us-ftc-over-made-usa-claims-2024-04-23/" data-cms-ai="0">Reuters</a> that the allegations made in the complaint were true.</p><p>Williams-Sonoma ranked No. 1,469 on Forbes' largest companies in the world list last year. With brands under its own moniker, Pottery Barn, West Elm and more, the company raked in nearly $8.7 billion in sales last year.</p><p>It's interesting to question, however, if U.S.-made labels have at all contributed to the company's success.</p><p>One survey last year found two-thirds of its 1,000 respondents said they regularly sought out "Made in America" products, and 50% said they'd be willing to pay more for them. Another survey from the <a href="https://reshoringinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/made-in-usa-survey.pdf" data-cms-ai="0">Reshoring Institute</a>in 2020 found over 69% of respondents preferred American-made products, and more than 80% were willing to pay 10% to 20% more for them.</p></div><p>Copyright 2024 Scripps Media, Inc.

          <p>The Cessna 185 Skywagon is a high wing, single engine aircraft: basically a Cessna 180 with six seats, a strengthened fuselage and a slightly more powerful engine. It’s a popular aircraft in remote areas where access to modern airstrips may be minimal.</p>

CC BY-SA 3.0 via Wikimedia Commons</figcaption></figure>
<p>The Skywagon can be fitted with floats or skis: this particular one, registered in Finland as OH-CVT, was equipped with floats. It also had a cargo pack and a Robertson STOL (short take-off and landing) kit, which reduces the stall speed.</p>
<p>The aircraft was owned by Polar Lento Ltd. Originally, the aircraft and the pilot were operating under Polar Lento’s certificate. However, on the 30th of April 2003, the Finnish Flight Safety authority cancelled the certificate, as the maintenance manager of the company was not approved. Polar Lento Ltd applied for the aircraft to be added to the certificate of Ivalon Lentopalvelu Ltd. The authority added the aircraft to Ivalon Lentopalvelu’s operations on the 2nd of May 2003. The contract between the two companies stipulated that Polar Lento Ltd would cover all fixed and variable expenses of the aircraft while operated by Ivalon Lentopalvelu.</p>
<p>The pilot held his commercial licence and had 2,176 hours on floatplanes, most of which were on Cessna 180-types.</p>
<p>On the 24th of June, the day before the accident, the pilot flew the Skywagon from Lake Kilpisjärvi to Lake Ounasjärvi, Enontekiö , the Finnish part of Lapland. His fuel load had been close to the maximum when he departed Lake Kilpisjärvi. The floatplane landed at Hetta fishing harbour and docked there overnight.</p>
<p>The morning of the 25th, the pilot did his preflight checks and pumped the water out of the floats with a hand pump. When the passengers arrived, he weighed the baggage. He loaded some of it into the netted cargo pack under the fuselage and the rest in the cargo area behind the seats.</p>
<p>It is common for flight operations in the wilderness to have the take-off weight close to the maximum. After the luggage and the passengers were loaded, the aircraft weighed 1,460 kilograms (3,220 pounds); the maximum take-off weight was 1,520 kilograms (3,351 pounds). The centre of gravity was within limits, though close to the forward limit.</p>
<p>They taxied from the pier to the take-off position. During the taxi, the pilot checked the engine. He then took off along the lake, heading due east into a light headwind of three knots. The waves on the lake were about 10 cm high (just under four inches).</p>
<p>When looking at the length of an aircraft’s take-off, we usually split it into two parts: the ground roll or ground run, where the aircraft is moving along the ground, and the distance from when the aircraft leaves the ground (rotation) until it reaches 15 metres (50 feet). Acceleration is based on the propeller thrust, which has to overcome the surface friction of the wheels and the aerodynamic drag of the aircraft.</p>
<p>On water, however, the hydrodynamic drag of the water causes the most resistance to acceleration. Take-off is effectively broken down into three phases. The aircraft starts its take-off run until the resistance reaches its peak (at about 27 knots). Then there is a short second-stage take-off phase where the floats are placed so that the aircraft is “on the step”: the floats have lifted partway and are hydroplaning across the surface of the water. The aircraft is no longer fully supported by the water but retains just enough surface friction to manoeuvre. Each successive wave is struck with increasing severity, so the pilot has to use elevator pressure in order to skim across the waves as the aircraft continues to accelerate. An error at this stage risks capsizing the aircraft; but soon, especially with a good head run, the aircraft will lift off the water (rotation), transitioning to the final stage of take-off.</p>
<p>At this stage, when the aircraft “unsticks” itself from the water, the pitch angle needs to be reduced — that is, the nose pitched slightly down — in order to give the aircraft a chance to gain speed. When the friction between the floats and the water disappears, the pitch up is briefly unbalanced; for how long depends on the float type. In addition, as the aircraft climbs, the ground effect reduces. The downwash behind the wing increases, the horizontal stabiliser angle of attack changes and the downward load on the stabiliser increases. As a result, the aircraft pitches up unless the pilot controls the flight path using the elevator. If this pitch up is not controlled, the aircraft is at risk of exceeding the stall angle of attack. The aircraft accelerates more easily when it is close to the water because the aircraft-induced drag is less in the ground effect. Thus, it is even more important for the floatplane pilot to control the pitch of the aircraft and gain airspeed before climbing away.</p>
<p>The Cessna 185’s take-off run on Lake Ounasjärvi that morning was approximately 500 metres (1,640 feet) of which the last 300 metres (980 feet) was on the step. The pilot noticed that the wind was coming slightly from the left (easterly).</p>
<p>The pilot had set the trim so that the aircraft would lift off from the step and begin to climb away. The rudder trim was set almost as far right as it could go. The pilot described the take-off as quick and easy. “I let it lift off by itself. It was well-trimmed and it lifted off normally by itself.”</p>
<p>The aircraft suddenly yawed and rolled to the right. They were about 15 metres above the water, ready to transition to the next phase of flight. The pilot immediately applied full opposite aileron and left rudder in an attempt to straighten out the aircraft. He pressed his right foot on top of his left foot in an attempt to gain full left rudder.</p>
<p>It didn’t help.</p>
<p>The aircraft yawed more than 90° to the right; that is, it turned at a right angle to its direction of travel. The right wing tip hit the water first, throwing the aircraft into a cartwheel. The nose and right wing hit the water, followed by the empennage as the cartwheeling continued. The left door and windshield were torn off of the fuselage.</p>
<p>When the tail impacted the water, the aircraft capsized and came to a halt, floating upside down in the lake, buoyed up by its floats. The water at the crash site was approximately 30 metres (100 feet) deep.</p>
<p>The cabin roof was at a depth of two metres (6.5 feet) and the cabin filled with water immediately. 170 litres of aircraft fuel and 10 litres of engine oil spilt into the lake. The water temperature was 8-10°C (46-50°F).</p>
<p>The pilot unbuckled his seat and tried to undo the seat belt of the passenger in the right-hand seat next to him. He couldn’t find the buckle. The passenger didn’t move and showed no signs of life. Running out of air, the pilot had to dive to get to the surface.</p>
<p>The passenger in the middle row, a 14-year-old boy, unbuckled his seat belt. He saw the surface through the left door opening and dived through it and swam to the surface.</p>
<p>A number of people witnessed the crash. Boats raced to the capsized aircraft, arriving within three minutes of the accident. One bystander dived into the water twice to try to reach the passenger trapped in the right-hand seat. It had been five minutes since the aircraft had capsized. The diver touched the passenger’s lifeless hand but was unable to free him from the aircraft.</p>
<p>The Enontekiö fire brigade arrived on the scene about twenty minutes later. One of the fire brigade with scuba diving gear attempted to recover the passenger but was unable to free him. The aircraft was towed towards the Hetta shore but became stuck in the bottom of the lake about 60 metres (200 feet) from the shore.</p>
<p>Two hours later, another, more experienced diver arrived on the scene. He was able to release the seat belt, which had tangled around the right ankle of the now-drowned passenger who was trapped in the front. Although the front seats were equipped with shoulder harnesses, neither the pilot nor the passenger had worn them. The diver carried the body to shore where a doctor pronounced him dead. The cause of death was later confirmed as by drowning. The passenger’s face was badly bruised, probably from hitting his face on the instrument panel. Although wearing a life jacket would not have saved the passenger, as the seat belt was not released in time, wearing the shoulder harness would have meant that he would have been conscious and able to escape once the aircraft had capsized. However, at that time, in Finland, there was no obligation to do so, although some countries do require this.</p>
<p>The surviving passenger said that the pilot did not give any safety briefing before they took off. The pilot said that he had given the briefing, including how to use the life jackets, seat belts and doors.</p>
<p>The pilot suffered a cut to his face and bruises around his body. The surviving passenger also had some bruising but no serious injuries. In both cases, most of the injuries were on the left side. The aircraft was beyond repair.</p>

<p>No one in the plane was wearing a life jacket. Although this wasn’t a factor in the accident, the Finnish report points out that passengers on a boat naturally wear life jackets and it seems illogical that sea- and floatplane operators do not usually wear them. One reason for this is that the certification of airworthiness inspection standard <em>requires</em> that the life jackets be stored in their original plastic bags. Aircraft life jackets are not very rugged because they are intended to be used only once, in an emergency. Floating and automatically operating life jackets aren’t practical, specifically because of cases like this where the occupants have to dive out of the capsized aircraft in order to escape the cabin. However, there are approved life jackets which could be used to deal with these circumstances.</p>
<p>The life jackets are required to be easily accessible; but, in most instances, there would not be enough time to put the life jackets on in an emergency unless the aircraft is planning a forced landing from cruise altitude. The investigators of the accident put forward that, if the intent is to have life jackets practically available in all phases of flight, the occupants of the aircraft should be wearing them throughout.</p>
<p>In interviews after the accident, the pilot said that the aircraft lifted off easily and quickly. When it suddenly rolled and yawed to the right, he tried to stop the movement by using full opposite aileron and rudder. He said that the aircraft was gaining altitude and speed at the time. He said that he tried to stop the roll and the yaw and continue the take-off. He never considered aborting the take-off or lowering the nose. The aircraft continued to roll and yaw and the nose dropped. The pilot remembered that he held the yoke with two hands but could not remember whether he pushed or pulled.</p>
<p>The investigation focused on the control systems. The impact damage to the aircraft made this difficult: the left wing was attached to the fuselage only by the aileron cables and one of the flap cables. The right wing was still attached, with the flap set to 20° down, which matched the setting of the flap control lever in the cockpit. The elevator control cables were intact and, although they were loose as a result of the bent empennage, investigators were able to confirm that movement of the yoke still transferred to the elevator. The elevator trim system position indicator showed neutral and the tailplane was in the neutral position. Both the left and right rudder pedals were intact. The rudder trim was ⅓ turn (one-third turn) from the extreme right position.</p>
<p>There was no reason why the control systems would not be working normally during the flight.</p>
<p>The pilot didn’t know the speed at which the Cessna 185 lifted off that day, although he said that it was normally around 55 knots. He didn’t have any observations about the speed during the take-off run or the initial climb. He never lowered the nose to gain airspeed as the aircraft lifted off, nor did he consider any other manoeuvres to increase his airspeed. He simply let the aircraft lift off and climb by itself.</p>
<p>The pilot had flown since 1988 in north-east Lapland, mostly for the reindeer industry or tourist flights. His home bases were Lake Ounasjärvi and Lake Kilpisjärvi; most of his flights had been short hops to the lakes around the area. He had had no previous accidents nor incidents in 2,940 hours of flight, with 8,125 take offs.</p>
<p>However, the investigation discovered that despite his experience, he had never practised stall recovery on the Cessna 185. The pilot had no knowledge of the aircraft’s stall behaviour at all. His opinion was that the Cessna 185 simply didn’t stall.</p>
<p>A further issue was that his Cessna 185 had been extensively modified. The addition of floats, cargo pack, short take-off and landing kit and a three-blade propeller had never had their combined effect documented.</p>
<p>The stall speed, at least, should normally have been documented as a part of the airworthiness check. A test flight was logged from four years previous by another pilot. The checklist showed that, at that time, with floats installed, the clean stall warning was triggered at 64 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS) and the aircraft stalled at 56 KIAS. The landing configuration stall warning was triggered at 58 KIAS and the aircraft stalled at 48 KIAS.</p>
<p>However, the aircraft had undergone further modifications and maintenance since then.</p>
<p>Earlier that year, a hangar roof had collapsed onto the aircraft at Enontekiö airport during a storm. The collapse dented the upper wing surfaces, ailerons and flaps. The aircraft was flown (carefully, one assumes!) to Rovaniemi airport for repairs.</p>
<p>The maintenance team discovered an incorrect right wing geometric twist, which was unrelated to the hangar roof collapse but probably happened during repairs done previously in the USA. As a result, the aircraft had a tendency to roll and had been uncomfortable to fly because of a lack of aileron trim. This might explain why the pilot had the aircraft trimmed full right rudder on take-off: to correct for this roll. When they repaired the damage to the right wing, they also corrected the geometric twist, removing the aircraft’s tendency to roll. They did not notify the Flight Safety Authority for the correction as they considered it to have been a minor repair.</p>
<p>The repair and maintenance were finished on the 20th of June, five days before the accident. The accident pilot ran up the engines and flew a test flight. He confirmed that, after the adjustment of the geometric twist, the aircraft no longer had the tendency to roll.</p>
<p>Then he filled out the test flight documents . . . except for the section on level flight where data was missing. The documents included blank fields for the pilot to fill out for the speed at which the aircraft stalled.</p>
<ul>
<li>Stall speed clean ___ KIAS (knots indicated airspeed)  </li>
<li>Stall speed landing configuration ___ KIAS  </li>
<li>Stall warning ___ KIAS  </li>
</ul>
<p>The pilot had put dashes in the blank fields, instead of noting the speed where the aircraft begins to stall when clean and the speed at which the stall begins when the aircraft is configured for landing. The last blank field, which should have stated the speed at which the stall warning sounds, had been filled in with the word OK.</p>
<p>The maintenance company received the document and gave the aircraft a certificate of release to service.</p>
<p>No one had <em>any idea</em> what the stall speed of the aircraft was. With the changes to the right wing geometric twist, the angle of incidence of the wings had been changed, which would have affected the stall speed. It seemed that the pilot had no knowledge of the aircraft’s stall behaviour at all. His opinion was that the Cessna 185 simply doesn’t stall. The investigators believed that he may have been afraid of stalling and so never tested the aircraft.</p>
<p>The Skywagon was a write-off but the investigation needed to understand the aerodynamics of the accident flight, taking into account the modifications. So, they re-created the aircraft. They equipped a Cessna A185E to match the accident aircraft, adding a Robertson STOL, floats (although not exactly alike), a cargo pack under the fuselage and a three-blade propeller. The aircraft’s weight was approximately 50 kilograms below the maximum take-off weight.</p>
<p>The first simulation of the accident scenario was done at 3,000 feet. The test pilot set idle power and then maintained altitude in order to allow the airspeed to reduce. Then when the airspeed had dropped to 48 knots, the test pilot applied maximum power. The nose pitched up by 10° which increased the angle of attack by 10°. The increased angle of attack caused the right wing to stall violently and the aircraft rolled and yawed to the right. The aircraft was travelling at 55 knots at the time.</p>
<p>The test pilot recovered the aircraft using the normal procedure, losing only 150-200 feet. The stall warning horn sounded throughout. The simulation was then repeated with the same result. Further flights, however, did not always result in the violent right wing stall. In five of the fourteen attempts, the aircraft rolled 50-70 degrees to the right in two seconds. Nothing significant happened on the other nine attempts, even when the speed was reduced to 40 knots.</p>
<p>Further test flights were done to check the stall warning and air speed indicators of the aircraft. The stall warning horn did not sound during take-off.</p>
<p>The investigation shifted their focus to aerofoil aerodynamics. They covered the test aircraft with hundreds of 90 mm wool threads. These threads made the airflow around the aircraft visible. The thread movements were filmed in flight with five video cameras: two cameras attached to each wing strut and one on top of the fin.</p>
<p>This allowed the study to document the airflow direction and turbulence from the movement of the threads. There was also a sixth camera attached to the cabin roof filming the instrument panel and horizon as well as recording the cabin sounds.</p>

<p>The wool threads showed that, on those occasions where the aircraft rolled to the right, the airflow separated first from the right wing tip and immediately after this, from the right wing root. The separation line progressed rapidly from the trailing edge to the leading edge and led to the sudden roll. The sudden aircraft roll was immediately stopped and the aircraft recovered when the pilot moved the yoke forward, reducing the angle of attack.</p>
<p>The investigators discovered that it was possible to suddenly stall the aircraft at a speed of 50-55 knots in the take-off configuration. The aircraft regularly suffered a sudden right wing tip stall, which caused the right roll and pitch down. They concluded that the cause of the right wing tip stall was the aileron angle, which caused a sharp edge to form on the upper surface. The short take-off and landing kit incorporates a link between the flaps and the ailerons. The ailerons turn downwards in the take-off configuration. Cessna aircraft have a hinge line on the upper surface. As a result, turning the aileron down causes a sharp angle on the upper surface. The air is unable to flow around such a sharp edge and stays attached. The result is a sudden right wing tip flow separation.</p>

<p>Despite this detailed study, they were never able to make sense of why this only happened a third of the time.  By rights, the aircraft should have stalled every time. In any event, the pilot had been lucky up until the day of the accident.</p>
<p>The commission named three direct causal factors of the accident.</p>
<p>The first factor was the pilot’s take-off procedure, which allowed the aircraft to climb after getting airborne, rather than controlling the pitch in order to increase the airspeed. As a direct result of this, the angle of attack increased and the right wing stalled.</p>
<p>The second factor was the tip-stalling tendency of the STOL kit. The flow separation of a standard Cessna aircraft begins from the wing root area. The sharp edge on the upper surface induced flow separation which caused the right wing tip to stall.</p>
<p>The third factor was the pilot’s response. There was no evidence that he pushed the yoke forward to unstall the wing, which in the flight tests consistently dealt with the issue. Instead, he applied full left aileron and rudder. If he had pushed the yoke forward, the aircraft may still have crashed but it was unlikely to have cartwheeled across the water and injured the passengers in such a way. Instead, his full opposite aileron turned the right aileron downwards, which made the right wing tip stall worse.</p>
<p>The indirect causal factor was the pilot’s lack of experience with stalling the aircraft. He told the investigation that he had never stalled the aircraft, which meant that he was unable to recognise the stall during the take-off. He was quite convinced that the aircraft would not stall and believed it was such an abnormal flight condition that he saw no need in practising it.</p>
<p>With the changes to the right wing geometric twist, the angle of incidence of the wings had changed, which affected the stall speed. The maintenance organisation should not have given the aircraft a certificate of release without verification of the slow flight and stall characteristics. Of course, even if another test pilot had completed the flight test, the pilot should still have practised stalls in the aircraft, knowing that the slow flight and stall characteristics of his aircraft had changed.</p>
<p>But, even though he knew both wings had been taken off the aircraft and maintenance done which would affect the stalling characteristics of the aircraft, he did not see the point in any stall manoeuvres as a part of the test flight or for general practice.</p>
<p>One last indirect causal factor was not wearing the shoulder harnesses in the front seat.</p>
<p>The Finnish Safety Investigation Authority has published the <a href="https://turvallisuustutkinta.fi/en/index/tutkintaselostukset/ilmailuonnettomuuksientutkinta/tutkintaselostuksetvuosittain/ilmailu2003/b22003llento-onnettomuusenontekiolla25.6.html#">full accident report in English</a>.</p>
<p>The conclusion of the accident report:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  <strong>Probable cause</strong></p>
<p>  The pilot let the aircraft continue to climb after getting airborne without reducing the pitch angle to gain airspeed. The aileron and flap connection of the R/STOL kit of the aircraft combined with the aileron type caused right wing to tip stall in the take-off configuration.</p>
<p>  The pilot did not recognise the stall and did not act in the required sense to recover.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Two recommendations were made by the investigation commission.</p>
<p>The first was that pilots be informed about the stall behaviour of the Robertson short take-off and landing kit on the Cessna 185 aircraft, both by listing the issue in the aircraft flight manual supplement and through education through the aviation authority.</p>
<p>The second was that the Finnish Flight Safety Authority revise existing regulations so that all persons on board must wear a life jacket during water operations, rather than insist that they be kept in plastic bags.</p>
