<p>Verizon Wireless gave a female victim's address and phone logs to an alleged stalker who pretended to be a police officer, according to an affidavit filed by an FBI special agent. The man, Robert Michael Glauner, was later arrested near the victim's home and found to be carrying a knife at the time, according to the affidavit submitted in court yesterday.</p>
<p>Glauner allegedly traveled from New Mexico to Raleigh, North Carolina, after finding out where she lived and, before arriving, sent a threatening message that said, "if I can't have you no one can." He also allegedly threatened to send nude photos of the victim to her family members.</p>
<p>Glauner was charged yesterday with stalking and fraud "in connection with obtaining confidential phone records" in US District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina. We aren't posting or linking directly to the court record because it seems to contain the victim's home address. The incident was previously <a href="https://www.404media.co/verizon-gave-phone-data-to-stalker-edrs-search-warrant-pose-as-cop/">reported by 404 Media</a>.</p>
<p>Glauner and the victim met in August or September 2023 on xhamster.com, a porn website with dating features, and "had an online romantic relationship," the affidavit said. The victim ended the relationship, but Glauner "continued to contact or try to contact" her, the document said.</p>
<p>Glauner tricked Verizon into providing sensitive information by sending an email and fake search warrant to vsat.cct@one.verizon.com, the email address for the Verizon Security Assistance Team (VSAT), which handles legal requests. Verizon didn't realize the request was fraudulent even though it came from a Proton Mail address rather than from a police department or other governmental agency, according to the affidavit filed yesterday by FBI Special Agent Michael Neylon.</p>                                            
                                                        
<h2>Fake cop, forged judge’s signature</h2>
<p>An email to Verizon from "steven1966c@proton.me" on September 26, 2023, said, "Here is the pdf file for search warrant. We are in need if the [<em>sic</em>] this cell phone data as soon as possible to locate and apprehend this suspect. We also need the full name of this Verizon subscriber and the new phone number that has been assigned to her. Thank you."</p>
<p>The email's attached document contained a fake affidavit written by "Detective Steven Cooper" of the Cary, North Carolina Police Department. The Cary Police Department confirmed that no officer named Steven Cooper is employed by their agency, Neylon wrote.</p>
<p>VSAT received a phone call the same day from a man identifying himself as Cooper, who stated that he needed information on a suspect in a homicide case. "The caller stated that the person involved changed her phone number," Neylon wrote.</p>
<p>The fake affidavit asked for the new phone number as well as "call records both outgoing and incoming" and "locations and text messages incoming and outgoing." The affidavit for a search warrant was supposedly approved by Superior Court Judge Gale Adams.</p>
<p>Adams is a real judge and she later confirmed to authorities "that the signature displayed on the document was not hers," Neylon wrote. Neylon's affidavit also said the "search warrant" was "not in the proper format and does not have form AOC-CR-119, as required for State of North Carolina search warrants."</p>
<h2>Verizon provides address and phone logs</h2>
<p>But after reviewing the email and document sent by "Cooper," Verizon provided an address and phone logs. "On October 5, 2023, Verizon Wireless provided Victim 1's phone records, including address and phone logs, to Glauner," according to Neylon's affidavit.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.verizon.com/support/residential/account/manage-account/security/security-assist-team">Verizon's website</a> says that the Verizon Security Assistance Team ensures that "court orders, search warrants, subpoenas and other legal demands served upon Verizon are processed confidentially and in compliance with all applicable law."</p>
<p>"Verizon Security Assistance Team will only accept valid legal demands (subpoena, court order or search warrant) for records," the VSAT webpage says.</p>
<p>We contacted Verizon about the incident today and will update this article if we get a response. A Verizon spokesperson told 404 Media that the company is cooperating with law enforcement on this matter.</p>

<p>Large language models (LLMs) exhibit amazing performance on a wide
variety of tasks such as text modeling and code generation. However,
they are also very large. For example Llama 2 70B has 70 billion
parameters that require 140GB of memory to store in half precision. This
presents many challenges, such as needing multiple GPUs just to serve a
single LLM. To address these issues, researchers have developed
compression methods that reduce the size of models without destroying
performance.</p>
<p>One class of methods, post-training quantization, compresses trained
model weights into lower precision formats to reduce memory
requirements. For example, quantizing a model from 16 bit to 2 bit
precision would reduce the size of the model by 8x, meaning that even
Llama 2 70B would fit on a single 24GB GPU. In this work, we introduce
<strong>QuIP#</strong>, which combines lattice codebooks with
incoherence processing to create state-of-the-art 2 bit quantized
models. These two methods allow QuIP# to significantly close the gap
between 2 bit quantized LLMs and unquantized 16 bit models.</p>

<h3 id="method-overview">Method Overview</h3>
<p>QuIP# relies on two main components: <em>incoherence processing</em>
and <em>lattice codebooks</em>. Incoherence processing in the context of
model quantization was introduced in QuIP. While QuIP used a Kronecker
product to perform incoherence processing, we introduce a Hadamard
transform-based incoherence approach that is more amenable to fast GPU
acceleration.</p>
<p>Incoherence-processed weights are approximately Gaussian-distributed,
which means that they are suitable for quantizing with symmetric and
“round” codebooks. We introduce a new lattice codebook based on the
<span>\(E_8\)</span> lattice, which achieves the
optimal 8 dimension unit ball packing density. Our codebooks are
specifically designed to be hardware-friendly by exploiting symmetries
in these lattices.</p>
<h3 id="quantization-background">Quantization Background</h3>
<p>In QuIP#, we follow existing state-of-the-art post training
quantization methods and round weights to minimize the per-layer
“adaptive rounding” proxy objective</p>
<p><span>\[
\ell(\hat W)
  = E_x \left[ \| (\hat W - W)x \|^2 \right]
  = \operatorname{tr}\left(
    (\hat W - W) H (\hat W - W)^T
   \right).
\]</span></p>
<p>Here, <span>\(W \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times
n}\)</span> is the original weight matrix in a given layer, <span>\(\hat W = \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}\)</span> are the
quantized weights, <span>\(x \in
\mathbb{R}^n\)</span> is an input vector drawn uniformly at random from
a calibration set, and <span>\(H\)</span> is the
second moment matrix of these vectors, interpreted as a proxy Hessian.
This intra-layer formulation makes quantization tracatable for large
language models. The original QuIP paper forumlated a class of adaptive
rounding methods that used linear feedback to minimize <span>\(\ell\)</span>. Within this class, the LDLQ
rounding algorithm was shown to be optimal; we use LDLQ in QuIP# as
well.</p>
<h3 id="incoherence-processing">Incoherence Processing</h3>
<p>The main insight of QuIP is that incoherent weight and hessian
matrices result in improved quantization performance. Informally, this
means that weights that are even in magnitude with important rounding
directions (the Hessians) that are not too large in any one coordinate
are significantly easier to quantize without catastrophic error. In some
sense, incoherence processing can be viewed as a form of outlier
suppression across weight and activation spaces.</p>
<p><strong>Definition.</strong> <em>We say a symmetric Hessian matrix
<span>\(H \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}\)</span> is
<span>\(\mu\)</span>-incoherent if it has an
eigendecomposition <span>\(H = Q \Lambda
Q^T\)</span> such that for all <span>\(i\)</span>
and <span>\(j\)</span>, <span>\(|Q_{ij}| = |e_i^T Q e_j| \leq \mu /
\sqrt{n}\)</span>. By extension, we say a weight matrix <span>\(W \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}\)</span> is <span>\(\mu\)</span>-incoherent if for all <span>\(i\)</span> and <span>\(j\)</span>, <span>\(|W_{ij}| =
|e_i^T W e_j| \leq \mu \|W\|_F / \sqrt{mn}\)</span>.</em></p>
<p>Incoherence is an important property for quantizing models. In QuIP,
the incoherence condition on <span>\(H\)</span> is
required to show that LDLQ achieves a superior proxy loss to nearest and
stochastic rounding through a spectral bound on <span>\(H\)</span>. Therefore, it is important to be able
to incoherence-process weight and hessian matrices efficiently so that
incoherence-processed models can be tractably deployed.</p>
<p>One way to do this is by conjugating <span>\(W\)</span> and <span>\(H\)</span> by random orthogonal matrices. Let
<span>\(U \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times m}\)</span>, and
<span>\(V \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}\)</span> be
two random orthogonal matrices. If we assign <span>\(\tilde H \gets V H V^T\)</span> and <span>\(\tilde W \gets U W V^T\)</span>, <span>\(\tilde H\)</span> and <span>\(\tilde W\)</span> become incoherence processed
with high probability (see QuIP for proof). One can verify that this
transformation preserves the proxy objective as <span>\[\operatorname{tr}(\tilde W \tilde H \tilde W^T) =
\operatorname{tr}((U W V^T) (V H V^T) (V W^T U^T)) =
\operatorname{tr}(WHW^T).\]</span></p>
<h4 id="randomized-hadamard-transformation-rht">Randomized Hadamard
Transformation (RHT)</h4>
<p>To construct <span>\(U\)</span> and <span>\(V\)</span> from above, we use the RHT, which is
amenable to fast GPU implementation. In fact, one of the CUDA sample
kernels is the RHT. The RHT performs the multiplication <span>\(x \in \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{H}Sx\)</span>,
where <span>\(\mathbb{H}\)</span> is a <span>\(n \times n\)</span> Hadamard matrix (scaled by a
normalization factor) and <span>\(S\)</span> is a
<span>\(n\)</span> dimensional random sign vector.
The RHT concentrates the entries of <span>\(x\)</span> and thus results in incoherent matrices
through an <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/user/dwoodruf/www/teaching/15859-fall20/lecture_2.1.pdf">application
of the Azuma-Hoeffding inequality</a>. Note that the Hadamard transform
can be computed more efficiently than a matrix multiplication via the
fast Walsh-Hadamard transform, which we employ directly for powers of 2.
To handle non power-of-two values of <span>\(n\)</span>, we perform the following
algorithm:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Let <span>\(p\)</span> be the remaining
dimension and reshape <span>\(Sx\)</span> into a
<span>\(n/p \times p\)</span> matrix.</li>
<li>Perform the fast Walsh-Hadamard transform on <span>\(Sx\)</span> associated with dimension <span>\(n/p\)</span>.</li>
<li>Let <span>\(\mathbb{H}'\)</span> be a <span>\(p \times p\)</span> scaled Hadamard matrix. Apply
this Hadamard transform to <span>\(Sx\)</span> on
the right, and reshape back.</li>
</ol>
<p>The only consequence of performing RHT is needing to store two sign
vectors per layer: <span>\(S_U\)</span> and <span>\(S_V\)</span>. Since large language models have
large weight and Hessian matrices, this only increases the number of
bits per weight in practice by less than 0.01, or a negligible
amount.</p>
<h3 id="lattice-codebooks">Lattice Codebooks</h3>
<p>Incoherence processed weights are approximately Gaussian-distributed,
meaning that they are symmetric and “round.” To take advantage of this
“roundness,” we can use <span>\(n\)</span>
dimensional codebooks that quantize <span>\(n\)</span> weights at once. Specifically, to
quantize <span>\(x \in \mathbb{R}^n\)</span> to a
<span>\(n\)</span> dimensional codebook <span>\(C \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}\)</span>, we round
<span>\(x\)</span> to its nearest distance-wise
entry in <span>\(C\)</span>. This requires <span>\(\log_2m\)</span> bits to represent which index in
<span>\(C\)</span> to store, and results in <span>\(k = \frac{\log_2m}{n}\)</span> bits per
weight.</p>
<p>Increasing <span>\(n\)</span> results in a
“rounder” codebook that reduces quantization error. However, note that
the number of bits per weight is determined by <em>both</em> the number
of entries in <span>\(C\)</span> (m) as well as the
dimension of <span>\(C\)</span> (n). To maintain a
set number of bits per weight, a linear increase in <span>\(n\)</span> requires an exponential increase in
<span>\(m\)</span>. For example, a naively designed
16-dimensional codebook requires <span>\(2^{32}\)</span> entries to achieve 2 bits per
weight, but performing lookups into a size <span>\(2^{32}\)</span> codebook is intractable. Thus, it
is important to design codebooks that both have relatively large <span>\(n\)</span> while being compressible so the actual
lookup happens with less than <span>\(2^{nk}\)</span> entries.</p>
<p>Geometric lattices are suitable bases for such codebooks as most
lattices have inherent symmetries and certain lattices achieve optimal
bin packing densities. For example, our E8P codebook based on the <span>\(E_8\)</span> lattice has <span>\(2^{16}\)</span> entries but only requires looking
up into a size <span>\(2^8\)</span> codebook due to
symmetries inherent to the <span>\(E_8\)</span>
lattice itself – more on this later. In QuIP#, we present the E8P
codebook based on the 8-dimensional <span>\(E_8\)</span> lattice. This lattice achieves the 8
dimensional kissing number, or the maximum number of unit balls touching
a central unit ball in 8 dimensions. Interestingly, Maryna Viazovska
recently won the Fields Medal in 2022 “for the proof that the <span>\(E_8\)</span> lattice provides the densest packing
of identical spheres in 8 dimensions.”</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<h4 id="e8p-codebook">E8P Codebook</h4>
<p>Our E8P codebook is a version of the <span>\(E_8\)</span> lattice intersected with a ball,
padded (hence the P in E8P) to reach <span>\(2^{16}\)</span> entries. This results in <span>\(k = 16/8 = 2\)</span> bits per weight. The <span>\(E_8\)</span> lattice is composed of 8 dimensional
all-integer or all-half integer vectors whose sum is an even number. In
set-builder notation, <span>\[E_8 = \left\{x \mid x
\in \left(\mathbb{Z}^8 \cup \left(\mathbb{Z}+\frac{1}{2}\right)^8\right)
\land \sum_i x_i \equiv 0 \pmod 2\right\}.\]</span> Note that <span>\(E_8 + \frac{1}{4}\)</span> has the same packing
density of <span>\(E_8\)</span> and is equivalent to
<span>\(D_8 + \frac{1}{2} \pm \frac{1}{4}\)</span>,
where <span>\(D_8\)</span> is the set of 8
dimensional all-integer vectors with even sum. Denote <span>\(D_8 + \frac{1}{2}\)</span> as <span>\(\hat{D_8}\)</span>; all elements in <span>\(\hat{D_8}\)</span> also have even sum parity.</p>
<p>Now, note that if we flip an even number of signs of an element in
<span>\(\hat{D_8}\)</span>, we get another element
in <span>\(\hat{D_8}\)</span>, whereas flipping an
odd number of signs results in something not in <span>\(\hat{D_8}\)</span>. This is due to <span>\(\hat{D_8}\)</span> being a half integer grid;
flipping a single half integer results in changing the sum parity. Since
<span>\(\hat{D_8}\)</span> has 8 dimensions, there
are <span>\(2^8/2 = 128\)</span> possible “even sign
flip” patterns to stay within <span>\(\hat{D_8}\)</span>. Conversely, there are also 128
“odd sign flip” patterns.</p>
<p>If we start from some “source codebook” <span>\(S\)</span> that is a subset of <span>\(|\hat{D_8}|\)</span>, where <span>\(|\cdot|\)</span> denotes the elementwise absolute
value, we can use 128 odd or even sign flips to generate a subset of
<span>\(\hat{D_8}\)</span>. Each entry in <span>\(S\)</span> is either an odd or even number of
flips away from an entry in <span>\(\hat{D_8}\)</span>, but not both. Thus, given an
entry <span>\(s \in S\)</span> and 7 out of the 8
sign flips, we can infer the last one from the parity of the 7 sign
flips and <span>\(s\)</span>. This lets us use the
following bit pattern to store a 16-bit codeword in <span>\(E_8 + \frac{1}{4}\)</span>: 8 bits for the entry
index in <span>\(S\)</span>, 7 bits for the sign
flips of the right 7 dimensions of the entry in <span>\(S\)</span>, and 1 bit to add or subtract <span>\(\frac{1}{4}\)</span>.</p>
<p>For example, if we had the codeword <code>0001010110010111</code>,
the first 8 bits <code>00010101</code> = 21 would indicate that we start
with the 21st entry in <span>\(S\)</span>. In this
example, let this be the vector</p>
<p><span>\[\left\{\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2},
\frac{1}{2}, \frac{3}{2}, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2},
\frac{1}{2}\right\},\]</span></p>
<p>which is not in <span>\(\hat{D_8}\)</span>. Thus,
<span>\(s\)</span> requires an odd number of sign
flips to get into <span>\(\hat{D_8}\)</span>. Then,
the next 7 bits <code>1001011</code> would indicate that we need to
negate the 1st, 2nd, 4th, and 7th from right bits. Since we need an odd
number of sign flips, the 8th from right bit is also a sign flip. The
sign-decoded vector is then</p>
<p><span>\[\left\{-\frac{1}{2}, -\frac{1}{2},
\frac{1}{2}, \frac{3}{2}, -\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}, -\frac{1}{2},
-\frac{1}{2}\right\},\]</span></p>
<p>which we can verify is in <span>\(E_8\)</span>.
Finally, the last bit <code>1</code> indicates that we need to add <span>\(\frac{1}{4}\)</span>, so the final decoded vector
is</p>
<p><span>\[\left\{-\frac{1}{4}, -\frac{3}{4},
\frac{3}{4}, \frac{7}{4}, -\frac{1}{4}, \frac{3}{4}, -\frac{1}{4},
-\frac{1}{4}\right\},\]</span></p>
<p>which is in <span>\(E_8 + \frac{1}{4}\)</span> as
desired.</p>
<p>Putting this all together, this lets us decode a size <span>\(2^{16}\)</span> codebook by looking up into only a
size <span>\(2^8\)</span> codebook (namely <span>\(S\)</span>) and performing some operations. On
hardware, this means that we can store the smaller <span>\(2^8\)</span> codebook in local caches, avoiding
performance killing memory accesses that the larger <span>\(2^{16}\)</span> codebook would require. The
question remains then of how to choose <span>\(S\)</span>. In our implementation, we set <span>\(S\)</span> to be the 227 elements of <span>\(|\hat{D_8}|\)</span> with norm <span>\(\le \sqrt{10}\)</span> plus 29 elements from <span>\(|\hat{D_8}|\)</span> that have norm <span>\(\sqrt{12}\)</span>. The exact elements chosen can
be found in our code.</p>
<h4 id="codebook-errors">Codebook Errors</h4>
<p>To show the optimality of our lattice codebooks, we plotted the
minimum achievable elementwise MSE of quantizing a <span>\(n\)</span>-dimensional multivariate Gaussian to
various <span>\(k\)</span> bit codebooks. To create
each codebook, we intersected a ball with the base lattice and increased
the radius of the ball to get more bits. The half integer codebooks are
formed from the <span>\(n\)</span>-dimensional half
integer grids.</p>

The E_8 lattice achieves the densest unit-sphere packing in 8 dimensions and our derivative codebooks have the lowest MSE.">

</figure>
<p>The <span>\(E_8\)</span>-based codebooks achieves
lower MSEs than all other codebooks, including those based on the <span>\(D_4\)</span> lattice that achieves the 4
dimensional kissing number. This figure also shows the importance of
having a large number of columns <span>\(n\)</span>.
Increasing the number of columns decreases the error for the half
integer grid, as the resulting codebook is more “round.” Since the E8P
codebook is actually the union of two shifted codebooks, each of which
is a ball intersected with <span>\(\hat{D_8}\)</span>, it is not perfectly round.
This is reflected in the MSE plot, where it sits slightly above the
<span>\(E_8\)</span> line. However, there does not
exist a <span>\(E_8\)</span> codebook with exactly 2
bits, so E8P is still practically superior.</p>
<h3 id="results">Results</h3>
<p>Here, we present quantization results using QuIP# on Llama 1 and 2
models. All models were quantized using the Hadamard transform for
incoherence processing and a weight scale factor of roughly 0.9 times
the optimal scale for a multivariate Gaussian to compensate for
inter-layer interactions. Furthermore, all Llama 2 models were evaluated
using a context lenth of 4096 and all Llama 1 models were evaluated with
context length 2048; these numbers match the context length the models
were trained with. These and other models can be found in our <a href="https://huggingface.co/relaxml">Hugging Face repository</a>.</p>
<p>The table below contains results for all Llama 1 and 2 models when
quantized to 2 bits using the E8P codebook. QuIP# achieves excellent
performance across all model sizes on both language modeling and zero
shot tasks. Furthermore, on the zero-shot tasks (ArcC, ArcE, BoolQ,
PiQA, WinoGrande), QuIP# models achieve near-native performance with
minimal degradation. Additional results are available <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18woLrIBdVGUr9CuFDbK9pl_6QzEBl09hfnoe4Qkg7Hg/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>

				<p id="speakable-summary">Was it too good to be true? <a href="https://beeper.com/">Beeper</a>, the startup that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/05/beeper-reversed-engineered-imessage-to-bring-blue-bubble-texts-to-android-users/">reverse-engineered iMessage</a> to bring blue bubble texts to Android users, is experiencing an outage, the company <a href="https://twitter.com/onbeeper/status/1733223640270082501">reported via a post on X on Friday</a>. And Apple is to blame, it seems. Users, including those of us at TechCrunch with access to the app, began seeing error messages when trying to send texts via the newly released Beeper Mini and messages are not going through.</p>
<p>The error message reads: “failed to lookup on server: lookup request timed out” spelled out in red letters.</p>

<p>In a response to a question on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/beeper/comments/18duom1/comment/kcjk6df/">Reddit</a> as to whether or not the app was broken, a Beeper team member had earlier replied, “Report a problem from the app, give us a chance to look into it.”</p>
<p>However, Beeper CEO&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericmigi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-mrf-link="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericmigi/">Eric Migicovsky</a> responded to TechCrunch’s inquiry about Beeper Mini’s status by pointing us to <a href="https://twitter.com/onbeeper/status/1733223640270082501">the X post acknowledging the outage</a>, and providing more detail. Asked if possibly Apple found a way to cut off Beeper Mini’s ability to function, he replied, “Yes, all data indicates that.”</p>
<div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Investigating reports that sending/receiving is not working in Beeper Mini 🔎</p>
<p>— Beeper (@onbeeper) <a href="https://twitter.com/onbeeper/status/1733223640270082501?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 8, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
</div>
<p>We don’t know what this means for the future of Beeper Mini’s efforts, unless Beeper’s engineers are able to work around the problem somehow.</p>
<p>Migicovsky, who previously founded the smartwatch Pebble, has argued that Beeper Mini wasn’t just beneficial for Android users who wanted to finally join their iMessage friends’ group chats, but that it increased security for iPhone users, too.</p>
<p>In an interview ahead of Beeper Mini’s launch, the founder explained that green bubble texts were unencrypted.</p>
<p>“That means that anytime you text your Android friends, anyone can read the message. Apple can read the message. Your phone carrier can read the message. Google… literally, it’s just like a postcard. Anyone can read it. So Beeper Mini actually increases the security of iPhones,” he had told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Apple, on the other hand, sees iMessage as one of the key tools for locking in users to its ecosystem, which is why it won’t launch an iMessage app for Android. While there was some hope that EU regulations would force it to make iMessage more interoperable, news this week indicates that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/06/imessage-will-reportedly-get-a-reprieve-from-eus-interoperability-regulation/">iMessage will get a reprieve from those rules</a> because the service is not popular enough with business users. That means Apple has no reason not to try to shut down Beeper Mini, if it could.</p>
<p>Migicovsky is none too pleased with that turn of events.</p>
<p>“I would be very interested to hear why they think that making security worse for iPhone users makes sense,” he said.</p>
<p>“If it’s Apple, then I think the biggest question is — if Apple truly cares about the privacy and security of their own iPhone users, why would they try to kill a service that enables iPhones to send encrypted chats to Android users? With their announcement of RCS support, it’s clear that Apple knows they have a gaping hole here. Beeper Mini is here today and works great. Why force iPhone users back to sending unencrypted SMS when they chat with friends on Android?,” he asked.</p>
<p>Founded in 2020, Beeper’s team had originally been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/pebble-founder-launches-beeper-a-universal-chat-app-that-works-with-imessage-and-others/">working on a multi-platform messaging aggregator</a>, which was renamed Beeper Cloud this week as<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/05/beeper-reversed-engineered-imessage-to-bring-blue-bubble-texts-to-android-users/"> Beeper Mini went to launch</a>. The latter uses new <a href="https://blog.beeper.com/p/how-beeper-mini-works">technology</a> that allows Android users to text iMessage users as if they were also texting from an iPhone for just $1.99 per month. That means blue bubbles in the group chat, not green ones. Because the startup was no longer using a middleman — like a Mac server relaying messages, as other iMessage-to-Android apps employ — it would essentially appear to Apple’s servers that Beeper Mini’s messages were coming from a device that runs iMessage natively. It’s unclear, then, how Apple was able to cut off Beeper Mini’s access.</p>
<p>What this means for Beeper Mini’s future is uncertain.</p>
<p>“We’ll evaluate options,” Migicovsky said.</p>

Spinning out of a research program from our team and academic collaborators, with roots in <a href="https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/blog/2023-06-08-hyena-safari">signal processing-inspired sequence models</a>, we are excited to introduce the <strong>StripedHyena </strong>models. This release includes <a href="https://huggingface.co/togethercomputer/StripedHyena-Hessian-7B"><strong>StripedHyena-Hessian-7B</strong> <strong>(SH 7B)</strong></a>, a base model, and <a href="https://huggingface.co/togethercomputer/StripedHyena-Nous-7B"><strong>StripedHyena-Nous-7B (SH-N 7B)</strong></a>, a chat model. StripedHyena builds on the many lessons learned in the past year on designing efficient sequence modeling architectures: <a href="https://www.together.ai/blog/hungry-hungry-hippos-towards-language-modeling-with-state-space-models">H3</a>, <a href="https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/blog/2023-03-07-hyena">Hyena</a>, <a href="https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/blog/2023-06-29-hyena-dna">HyenaDNA</a>, and <a href="https://www.together.ai/blog/monarch-mixer">Monarch Mixer</a>.</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/650c3b59079d92475f37b68f/657376483aa570d149ef2a34_ezgif-1-cf1baf1671.gif" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><ul role="list"><li>StripedHyena is the first alternative model competitive with the best open-source Transformers in short and long-context evaluations. The same base model achieves comparable performance with<strong> </strong>Llama-2, Yi and Mistral 7B on OpenLLM leaderboard tasks, outperforming on long-context summarization.</li><li>StripedHyena is faster and more memory efficient for long sequence training, fine-tuning, and generation. Beside attention, one core computational primitive for efficient inference is a state-space model (SSM) layer, building on pioneering work such as <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.00396">S4</a> (Gu el al.), enabling conversion of convolutional layers into recurrences. Using our latest research on fast kernels for gated convolutions (<a href="https://www.together.ai/blog/flashfftconv">FlashFFTConv</a>) and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18780">on efficient Hyena inference</a>, StripedHyena is &gt;30%, &gt;50%, and &gt;100% faster in end-to-end training on sequences of length 32k, 64k and 128k respectively, compared to an optimized Transformer baseline using FlashAttention v2 and custom kernels. StripedHyena caches for autoregressive generation are &gt;50% smaller than an equivalently-sized Transformer using grouped-query attention.&nbsp;</li><li>StripedHyena is designed using our latest research on <strong>scaling laws of efficient architectures.</strong> In particular, StripedHyena is a hybrid of attention and gated convolutions arranged in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10866">Hyena operators</a>. Via a compute-optimal scaling protocol, we identify several ways to improve on baseline scaling laws for Transformers (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15556">Chinchilla</a>) at the architecture level, such as hybridization. With these techniques, we are able to obtain higher quality models than Transformers at each training compute budget, with additional benefits at inference time.</li><li>StripedHyena is optimized using a set of new <strong>model grafting</strong> techniques, enabling us to change the model architecture during training. StripedHyena was obtained by grafting architectural components of Transformers and Hyena, and trained on a mix of the RedPajama dataset, augmented with longer-context data.</li></ul><p>‍</p><p>We look forward to further pushing the boundaries of model architectures for fast training and inference, allowing us to improve on existing scaling laws and to obtain higher quality base models at each compute budget. </p><p>‍</p><h2><strong>A single architecture for short and longer context tasks</strong>‍</h2><p>For the past year, the Together AI team and our collaborators at Hazy Research have been working on the design of new sequence models for language and other domains. We’ve been especially excited by architectures that replace attention as the primary operator responsible for mixing sequences of embeddings, and replacing them with alternatives that are computationally cheaper. We’ve developed several models (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14052">H3</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10866">Hyena</a>) that replace attention with implicit gated convolutions and gated SSMs, and trained some of the first alternative architectures rivaling Transformers on language.</p><p>‍</p><h3><strong>Evaluation</strong></h3><p>We evaluate StripedHyena on a suite of benchmarks to establish performance on short-context tasks, as well as to probe its ability to process long prompts.&nbsp;</p><p>First, we test perplexity scaling on a subset of books from Project Gutenberg. We compute the perplexity on the last 2048 tokens of each sample, and repeat the experiment by including increasingly longer prefixes in the prompt of StripedHyena. We observe different behaviors depending on the structure of the sample; perplexity either saturates at 32k (the input length seen during the last stages of training), or keeps decreasing past 32k, suggesting that the model is able to incorporate some information from the longer prompt.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/650c3b59079d92475f37b68f/65732f121802735f813cafb9_PastedGraphic-5.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Context length scaling on books sampled from the Gutenberg collection.

We found hybrids composed of multi-head attention, gated MLPs and gated convolutions to outperform strong Transformer architectures such as Llama across compute budget, and identified optimal ways to mix these components, in both ordering and quantity.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/650c3b59079d92475f37b68f/65734be22ed8d1eca69a9876_graph23.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>[Left] Perplexity scaling of different architectures, as a function of compute budget.

We follow a compute-optimal protocol and identify the optimal model sizes for each FLOP group (each indicated via a different color) for base and hybrid architectures. To minimize the impact of hyperparameters on different architectures, we derive hyperparameter scaling laws from a subset of optimized experiments. <strong>Hybridizing improves on both scaling and robustness to training performed outside the compute-optimal frontier.</strong></figcaption></figure><p>With our academic partners, we have been developing theory and synthetic tasks to understand how and why this occurs. We have identified a variety of regimes where layers specialize to particular sub-tasks of sequence modeling, providing valuable signals for further architecture optimization. This continues our general line of work on <strong>mechanistic design</strong>, which involves small-scale, synthetic tasks carefully constructed to stress-test architecture capabilities.</p><h3><strong>Multi-head gated convolutions</strong></h3><p>‍</p><p>Another way to improve over Transformer rates is to introduce additional computation in the form of multiple heads in gated convolutions. This design, inspired by linear attention, has been validated in architectures such as <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14052">H3</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18780">MultiHyena</a>, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18780">is provably more efficient at encoding associative recall circuits.</a>&nbsp;</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/650c3b59079d92475f37b68f/6573717223a903c3f413a3bd_white%20lines.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>We validate a variety of architectural improvements via compute-optimal scaling.</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>These are two of many architectural design techniques that can result in improved scaling over Transformers. With StripedHyena, we focus in particular on the synergy between attention and gated convolutions.</p><p>‍</p><h2><strong>A shift in the computational footprint of language models: Cheaper fine-tuning, faster inference</strong></h2><p>‍</p><p>Optimizing models built on a different architecture requires rethinking computational trade-offs of training, fine-tuning, and inference. For these new architectures, a different set of computational bottlenecks emerges, and we’re proud to have developed the key technologies enabling these models as well, such as <a href="https://www.together.ai/blog/flashfftconv">FlashFFTConv</a> and its <a href="https://www.together.ai/blog/h3">predecessors</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><p>For training and fine-tuning workloads on long sequences, SH 7B is always faster than optimized Transformers (&gt;10%, &gt;20% and &gt;50% end-to-end faster than FlashAttention v2 processing sequences of lengths 32k, 64k and 128k, at batch size 1), with the speedup growing larger on longer sequences and with larger batches. StripedHyena models are optimal candidates for fine-tuning on long-context tasks – for tasks at length 128k, SH 7B can finetune on more than twice as many tokens as a Transformer given the same budget.</p><p>‍</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/650c3b59079d92475f37b68f/65732f3e6bb6da558f966bb8_PastedGraphic-4.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption><strong> </strong>End-to-end batch size 1 latency of an optimized Transformer 7B (FlashAttention v2 and custom kernels) compared to SH 7B.</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>These improvements are driven by the different asymptotic scaling and computational profile of layers in the hybrid architecture. We look forward to even faster models with refined mixing ratios and layers.</p><p>‍</p><h2><strong>Reducing memory for inference</strong></h2><p>‍</p><p>One additional advantage of SH 7B is a &gt;50% reduced memory footprint during autoregressive generation, compared to a Transformer (both with grouped-query attention). In Transformers, the key and value entries of each layer are cached during the <em>prefilling</em> phase to avoid recomputation and speed up incremental decoding. Gated-convolution layers introduce significantly more degrees of freedom during inference, as there are several ways to represent and optimize computation. We explore these trade-offs in our recent research on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18780">distillation and representation of convolutions in Hyena</a>. These new techniques have been used in SH 7B to further reduce the memory footprint by identifying and pruning redundant states.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/650c3b59079d92475f37b68f/65732f59425c945fc9fbfe71_PastedGraphic-6.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Memory footprint of inference cache for GQA Transformer and StripedHyena, including key-value cache and convolution states (FIR and IIR).&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><h2><strong>From signal processing to language models</strong></h2><p>‍</p><p>The flexibility of StripedHyena is a direct consequence of the existence of multiple equivalent representations and parametrization of linear systems: convolutional, modal, canonical. Each form is better suited to a specific training and inference workload.</p><p>‍</p><p>Borrowing terminology from classical signal processing, SH convolutional filters can be broadly treated as&nbsp; either finite (FIR) or infinite (IIR). FIR caching for a convolution is analogous to standard key-value caching (kv caching) in attention – particularly the sliding window kind – and grows in memory footprint (until a maximum value).</p><p>‍</p><p>IIR filters on the other hand can be applied by caching a constant-size state, then updated during decoding via a recurrent step. The IIR representation can itself be customized. Fixed-size states, in contrast to kv caches, open up several key optimizations at the inference stack level, streamlining techniques such as continuous batching and speculative decoding.</p><p>‍</p><h2><strong>What’s ahead&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Our primary objective with the StripedHyena models is to push the frontier of architecture design beyond Transformers. StripedHyena only scratches the surface of what is possible with careful architecture design via mechanistic design and scaling laws, and with ideas such hybridization, implicit convolutions and state caching. We hope these models can inspire the open source community to explore new exciting builds with diverse architectures.</p><p>‍</p><p>In future versions we will explore:&nbsp;</p><ul role="list"><li>Larger models with longer context.&nbsp;</li><li>Multi-modal support.&nbsp;</li><li>Further performance optimizations.&nbsp;</li><li>Integration of StripedHyena into retrieval pipelines for full utilization of longer context.</li></ul><p>‍</p><h2><strong>Acknowledgments</strong></h2><p>This work would not have been possible without our collaborators at <a href="https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/">HazyResearch</a>, <a href="https://hessian.ai/">Hessian.AI</a>, <a href="https://nousresearch.com/">Nous Research</a>, <a href="https://mila.quebec/en/">MILA</a>, <a href="https://huggingface.co/">HuggingFace</a>, <a href="https://www.dfki.de/en/web">DFKI</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>We are grateful to Hessian.AI Innovation Lab (funded by the Hessian Ministry for Digital Strategy and Innovation) and the hessian.AISC Service Center (funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)) for the collaboration and joint use of their AI supercomputer forty-two.

The last participant is Wix’s General Manager for Israel, Batsheve Moshe, using a kind of Hebrew rebus handle.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Just days after the Oct. 7 surprise attack on Israel from Hamas, Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, a spokesperson for Israel Defense Forces, beamed into a Zoom meeting to brief pro-Israel activists from Silicon Valley. The participants included major venture capitalists and technology executives, such as Jordan Blashek, the President of America’s Frontier Fund, a national security investment firm backed by former Google CEO Eric Schmidt.&nbsp;</p><div><p><span>"There is still fighting ongoing in sporadic clashes and attacks by Hamas terrorists in southern Israel," Conricus said. Since he was speaking to the group on an unencrypted, open line, Conricus cautioned that he could not divulge too many secrets. But, he added, the war would soon escalate with an Israeli military response and the participants on the call could lend a hand.</span></p><p><span>The IDF spokesman encouraged those on the call to assist with “maintaining pressure on legislators” in Congress and to work to influence those “in universities or media, or think tanks, or in elite circles.”</span></p></div><p>Members of the hasbara-oriented tech world WhatsApp group have eagerly taken up the call to shape public opinion as part of a bid to win what’s been described as the “second battlefield” and “the information war.”</p><p><span>It’s not hard to see why. On Oct. 7, Hamas murdered an estimated 1,200 Israelis and foreign workers, and abducted </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/israel-hostages-hamas-explained.html" rel="">roughly</a><span> 240 people as hostages. The killing spree was the worst mass slaughter of Jews since the Holocaust and a tragedy that immediately upended Israeli society.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The massacre also prompted Israel to embark on an invasion of Gaza that has killed </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/how-many-palestinians-have-died-gaza-war-how-will-counting-continue-2023-12-06/" rel="">more than 16,000 Palestinians</a><span>, most of whom are women and children and displaced more than 1 million Gaza residents from their homes. Critics of the invasion argue that Israel is both failing to minimize the invasion’s impact on Palestinian civilians and to recognize that it will only achieve security when Palestinians have hope for a state of their own. But Israel maintains that it must stop at nothing to eradicate Hamas, which embeds itself in civilian infrastructure.</span></p><div><p><span>That’s where the efforts of J-Ventures’ hasbara WhatsApp group come in.&nbsp;The group, which also includes attorneys and individuals affiliated with the influential American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), has tirelessly worked to fire employees and punish activists for expressing pro-Palestinian views. It has also engaged in a </span><a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/4315364-arizona-state-cancels-pro-palestinian-event-featuring-tlaib/" rel="">successful</a><span> push to cancel events held by prominent Palestinian voices, including an Arizona State University talk featuring Rep. Rashida Tlaib, a Michigan Democrat who is the only Palestinian-American in Congress. The group has also circulated a </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231208003427/https://engage.gophousemajority.com/tell-tlaib-to-resign/" rel="">push-poll</a><span> suggesting Rep. Tlaib should resign from office and provided an automated means of thanking Rep. Dan Goldman (D-NY) for voting to censure her.</span></p><p><span>In some cases, officials from the IDF and other parts of the Israeli government have joined the effort. David, the Israeli foreign ministry official and an investor in J-Ventures, has shared official talking points in the WhatsApp group.</span></p><p><span>One presentation that David shared made the case that Hamas intentionally stations its military operations near civilian sites as part of its strategy of deploying “human shields.” United Nations officials have </span><a href="https://www.unrwa.org/newsroom/press-releases/unrwa-condemns-placement-rockets-second-time-one-its-schools" rel="">discovered</a><span> Hamas rockets hidden in a vacant school in the past, and indeed, the militant group's vast, underground tunnel network endangers civilians throughout the Gaza Strip. Yet the recent IDF document uses broad categories to identify Hamas military sites and Israeli targets, including a “Hamas bank” located next to a Palestinian kindergarten.</span></p></div><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ecff7e5-40c5-4bed-ae1c-92d6d2bfe38a_1600x894.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ecff7e5-40c5-4bed-ae1c-92d6d2bfe38a_1600x894.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ecff7e5-40c5-4bed-ae1c-92d6d2bfe38a_1600x894.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ecff7e5-40c5-4bed-ae1c-92d6d2bfe38a_1600x894.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ecff7e5-40c5-4bed-ae1c-92d6d2bfe38a_1600x894.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_2400,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ecff7e5-40c5-4bed-ae1c-92d6d2bfe38a_1600x894.png" width="1200" height="670.8791208791209" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/7ecff7e5-40c5-4bed-ae1c-92d6d2bfe38a_1600x894.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:false,&quot;imageSize&quot;:&quot;large&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:814,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:1200,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ecff7e5-40c5-4bed-ae1c-92d6d2bfe38a_1600x894.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ecff7e5-40c5-4bed-ae1c-92d6d2bfe38a_1600x894.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ecff7e5-40c5-4bed-ae1c-92d6d2bfe38a_1600x894.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ecff7e5-40c5-4bed-ae1c-92d6d2bfe38a_1600x894.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>An IDF presentation shared by Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs official and J-Ventures investor Andy David and dated Oct. 11.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Israeli officials have invested heavily in shaping the narrative about its war on social media, viewing online discourse as a vital area for maintaining public support. Last month, a spokeswoman for the IDF and the Israel office director of Bessemer Venture Partners, the venture capital firm where Jeff Epstein is an operating partner, jointly led a Zoom workshop for “high-tech leaders” on tactics for scoring “victories” in the public discourse on Twitter/X. J-Ventures has also raised funds for automated technology to mass report tweets and for facial recognition technology for the IDF to identify hostages. Meanwhile, other Israeli officials have led similar webinar sessions on strategy to shape coverage in campus newspapers and major media outlets.&nbsp;</p><p>J-Ventures has joined the broader U.S. Jewish community in supporting more conventional charity efforts in Israel. One J-Ventures impact report notes that the group raised money for laptops for Israeli children evacuated because of the conflict and supplied mental health services for those traumatized by the Oct. 7 attack. The chats discuss the urgent need to send medical supplies and funds to Israeli hospitals.</p><p>Ruby Chen, the father of Itay Chen, a 19-year-old Israeli-American IDF soldier who went missing on Oct. 7 and is believed to be a hostage of Hamas, is also a member of WhatsApp chat. The group has coordinated closely with Chen to promote his television appearances.</p><p>But J-Ventures has also veered into an unusual kind of philanthropy: shipments of military supplies. The group has attempted to provide tactical gear to Israel’s equivalent of the U.S. Navy SEALs, known as Shayetet-13, and donated to a foundation dedicated to supporting the IDF’s undercover “Duvdevan” unit, which is known for infiltrating Palestinian populations. Many of the shipments intended for the IDF were held up at U.S. airports over customs issues.&nbsp;</p><div><p><span>The online space has been a focal point of pro-Israel activism, far beyond J-Ventures. Less than two weeks into the conflict, the Israeli Foreign Affairs Ministry </span><a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/israel-social-media-opinion-hamas-war/" rel="">released</a><span> 75 different online ads and spent millions of dollars purchasing space on platforms such as YouTube and Twitter/X. The ministry, which operates several highly active social media accounts, has also reached out directly to American allies, helping guide pro-Israel activism on social platforms. </span></p><p><span>"You guys are our frontline soldiers,” said Tamar Schwarzbard, head of Digital Diplomacy at the Israeli Foreign Ministry, on an October Zoom call posted online by Hasbara Fellowships, a nonprofit group that works closely with the Israeli government to train pro-Israel activists in the U.S. and Canada. She noted that the government needed help reframing the Gaza war and the public messaging over the conflict with Hamas.</span></p></div><p>“Let’s say you see some kind of newspaper article on your campus news site showing support or solidarity with the Palestinians and not speaking out against what's going on in the Gaza envelope and in Israel,” she said. “So you want to make sure, try to tag, let's say, the president of the university on the post you're putting out condemning that article.”</p><div><p><span>“Hamas does really good PR,” continued Schwarzbard. “We need to change the narrative.” She implored the group to use focused language. “We need people to see this isn't just a run-of-the-mill resistance, freedom fighter group. This is something equivalent of ISIS.”</span></p><p><span>Schwarzbard instructed participants on the call to use certain hashtags when discussing the conflict, such as #HamasIsISIS, #IStandwithIsrael, and #IsraelUnderAttack. The strategy would boost engagement and bring a large audience to the pro-Israel cause, she explained.</span></p><p><span>She also focused on the expected public relations challenges posed by the war. Israel would soon lose international support as its military response in Gaza kills more Palestinian civilians, noted Schwarzbad, who stressed the need to refocus attention on Israeli civilian deaths. “Try to use names and ages whenever you can,” she said. Don’t refer to statistics of the dead, use stories. “Say something like, 'Noah, age 26, was celebrating with her friends at a music festival on the holiest day of the week, Shabbat. Imagine if your daughter was at Coachella.’” </span></p><p><span>As with the efforts to punish employees and activists, senior figures in both Silicon Valley and the Israeli tech corridor work closely with the Israeli government to disseminate pro-Israel narratives on social media. On Nov. 22, </span><a href="https://www.bvp.com/team/adam-fisher" rel="">Adam Fisher</a><span>, the head of the Israel office of Bessemer Venture Partners, gave a presentation on how U.S. “high-tech leaders, investors, and entrepreneurs,” such as himself, could help the Israel Defense Forces win the “information war” on social media.

For this category of people, the goal is not to "convince them of anything," but to "show them that it's much more complicated than it seems." Seeding doubt, he said, would make certain audiences think twice before attending a protest. "So it's really about creating some kind of confusion,” Fisher continued, “but really, just to make it clear to them that it's really a lot more complicated."</p><div><p><span>A second category, Fisher explained, is the "uncomfortable sympathizer," a group that "wants to support Israel -- they're typically more liberal," but opposes the current government led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. These types can be won over, Fisher said, by pointing out "that we are a multi-ethnic, diverse, democratic liberal society with rotten apples." </span></p><p><span>The final group consists of those who are "reflexively pro-Israel, kind of ‘Israel, right or wrong.’" Members of this group "are not actually very knowledgeable," so they needed to be equipped with the right facts to make them "more effective in advocating for Israel,” Fisher said.</span></p><p><span>Fisher repeatedly noted the need to offer accurate and nuanced information to rebut critics of Israel's actions. Yet at times, he offered his own misinformation, such as his claim that "anti-Israel" human rights organizations like Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch "didn't condemn the October 7th massacre." </span></p><p><span>In fact, Amnesty had condemned Hamas’ attack a few days after it occurred, detailing a </span><a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2023/10/israel-palestinian-armed-groups-must-be-held-accountable-for-deliberate-civilian-killings-abductions-and-indiscriminate-attacks/" rel="">long list of atrocities</a><span> committed by the Palestinian militia and allied groups. “Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups flagrantly violated international law and displayed a chilling disregard for human life,” </span><a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2023/10/israel-palestinian-armed-groups-must-be-held-accountable-for-deliberate-civilian-killings-abductions-and-indiscriminate-attacks/" rel="">Amnesty stated</a><span> in its Oct. 12 report. Similarly, Human Rights Watch (HRW) published a </span><a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/10/10/hamas-led-attack-southern-israel-kills-hundreds" rel="">dispatch</a><span> on Oct. 10 that condemned the Hamas attack on Israel, noting that deliberately "killing civilians is a war crime, as is hostage taking."</span></p></div><div><p><span>The efforts to discredit HRW stem directly from its outspoken criticism of Israel’s record in the occupied territories and its military conduct. An HRW </span><a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/11/22/israel/gaza-hostilities-take-horrific-toll-children" rel="">report</a><span> released the same day as Fisher’s remarks cited the World Health Organization’s </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/child-killed-average-every-10-minutes-gaza-says-who-chief-2023-11-10/" rel="">conclusion</a><span> that the IDF had killed roughly one child in Gaza every 10 minutes since the outbreak of violence in October.</span></p><p><span>Other efforts to defend Israel coming from Silicon Valley involve technological attempts to censor critics and promote a pro-Israel message to shape opinions about the war.&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><p><span>Gadi Hutt, senior director of business development at Amazon-owned subsidiary Annapurna Labs, has helped the J-Ventures team pressure the Amazon online marketplace to remove t-shirts and other merchandise that feature the slogan, “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free” – a campaign that was ultimately successful, he announced to the WhatsApp group.</span></p><p><span>Hutt also informed the WhatsApp group that he was leading “a group of technologists to implement multiple projects aiding the war effort.” One of the J-Ventures documents lists Hutt as the point person for </span><a href="https://canarymission.org/" rel="">Canary Mission</a><span>, a controversial group that </span><a href="https://theintercept.com/2018/11/22/israel-boycott-canary-mission-blacklist/" rel="">blacklists</a><span> pro-Palestinian figures on college campuses, to help the group train "AI models to classify antisemitic posts from Twitter.”</span></p><p><span>Earlier this week, members of the J-Ventures group chat also internally circulated a </span><a href="https://actionnetwork.org/letters/netflix-removfe-the-antisemitic-blood-libel-film-farha" rel="">petition</a><span> for Netflix to remove the </span><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11555492/awards/" rel="">award-winning</a><span> Jordanian film ‘Farha,’ claiming that its portrayal of the actions of IDF soldiers during the 1948 displacement of Palestinians constituted “blood libel,” while another said the film was based “antisemitism and lies.” </span></p><p><span>Last year, the Israeli government </span><a href="https://theintercept.com/2022/12/03/farha-netflix-nakba-palestine-israel/" rel="">revoked</a><span> funding for a theater in Jaffa for screening the film, while government figures called for other repercussions to Netflix for streaming it. </span></p><p><span>In the WhatsApp group, demand faced some pushback. One member noted that despite the controversy over a scene in the film in which Israeli soldiers execute a Palestinian family, Israeli historians have documented that “such actions have indeed happened.” The critique was rejected by other members of the group, who said the film constituted “incitement” against Jews.</span></p></div><div><p><span>J-Ventures documents and affiliated WhatsApp discussions also show support for a variety of automated attempts to remove pro-Palestinian content on social media. In one instance, J-Ventures donated $19,531 to </span><a href="https://www.digitaldome.io/" rel="">DigitalDome.io</a><span>, an initiative that promotes itself as an online version of Israel’s Iron Dome missile defense system, promising that “offensive and malicious content is intercepted here.” Hermoni and Rami Lipman, an investor in Israel, are listed as the points of contact for the contribution.</span></p><p><span>An Oct. 25 posting in the J-Ventures WhatsApp channel asserted that DigitalDome’s “recent achievements” included the </span><a href="https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-769852" rel="">censorship</a><span> of Hamas’ channels on the Telegram communications platform using Android phones, allegedly as a result of Telegram being forced to comply with Google Play’s guidelines. DigitalDome likewise </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C0ZTn_5op62/" rel="">touts</a><span> various efforts to remove pro-Palestinian content from Instagram and Twitter/X. In one case, the site </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C0YjCW2ojo7/?img_index=2" rel="">claims</a><span> it had successfully reported an account to a European Union legal body for posting videos with Hamas fighters.</span></p></div><p><span>The little-known DigitalDome.io website is labeled by J-Ventures as part of its hasbara</span><em>,</em><span> or pro-Israel public relations efforts, and is run in </span><a href="https://english.alarabiya.net/News/middle-east/2023/11/10/Exclusive-Inside-Israel-s-war-room-cracking-down-on-fake-news" rel="">partnership</a><span> with the Israeli fact-checking website </span><a href="https://fakereporter.net/?lang=en" rel="">FakeReporter</a><span>, which was founded by </span><a href="https://www.middleeastinitiatives.org/who-we-are" rel="">Achiya Schatz</a><span>, a veteran of the IDF’s undercover commando unit, </span><a href="https://www.idf.il/en/mini-sites/idf-brigades/commando/duvdevan/duvdevan-unit/" rel="">Duvdevan</a><span>. Schatz has had a curious career trajectory, however; prior to founding FakeReporter, he served as communications director for the left-wing Israeli group </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/11/14/1212836719/ex-idf-soldier-calls-for-international-intervention-to-stop-settler-violence" rel="">Breaking the Silence</a><span>. Breaking the Silence documents the stories of IDF veterans who feel guilty about what they see as immoral practices in which they were complicit during their military service, and now advocate for peaceful resolution of the Israel-Palestine conflict.&nbsp;</span></p><p>​When reached for comment, Schatz stated that he started FakeReporter out of a genuine concern about the impact of misinformation on the public discourse. The nonprofit group is "devoted to fact-based conversation, anti-hate speech, anti-violence … because I believe that the democratic space has shrunk to a place that conversation almost doesn't even matter anymore," he said.</p><p>Schatz vehemently denied the suggestion that his group is part of the hasbara ecosystem or otherwise aims to help Israel shape its public image.&nbsp; “Maybe people … think I'm doing it for different [reasons], or even to fight pro-Palestinian activists,” he said. “I do not.”</p><p><span>In the WhatsApp group, J-Ventures also promoted </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/dannykg_israel-hamas-hamasisis-activity-7119952867225985024-nzuV/" rel="">IronTruthBot</a><span>, a bot that automates the process of removing “inflammatory, false, and defamatory posts against Israel from all platforms.” The project was described as being developed by a group of volunteers, receiving 700 reports a day and succeeding in removing “hundreds of inappropriate posts.”</span></p><div><p><span>Over the last two months, dozens of individuals have been fired for expressing opinions related to the war in Gaza and Israel. Most have been dismissed for expressing pro-Palestinian views, including a </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/oct/10/philadelphia-sports-reporter-loses-job-pro-palestinian-comments" rel="">writer for PhillyVoice</a><span>, the </span><a href="https://news.artnet.com/news/artforum-editor-fired-over-pro-palestine-open-letter-2385950" rel="">editor of ArtForum</a><span>, an apprentice at German publishing giant </span><a href="https://theintercept.com/2023/10/26/axel-springer-fires-employee-israel/" rel="">Axel Springer</a><span>, and Michael Eisen, the editor-in-chief of eLife, a prominent science journal. Eisen’s offense was a </span><a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2023/11/michael-eisen-tweet-elife-firing-science-editor-palestinians-israel-gaza/" rel="">tweet sharing</a><span> a satirical article from The Onion seen as sympathetic to the plight of Palestinians in Gaza. </span></p><p><span>The WhatsApp chats provide a rare look at the organizing efforts behind the broad push to fire critics of Israel and suppress public events featuring critics of the Israeli government. The scope is surprisingly broad, ranging from investigating the funding sources of student organizations such as </span><a href="https://ncusar.org/modelarableague/" rel="">Model Arab League</a><span>, to monitoring an </span><a href="https://bit.ly/pali-toolkit" rel="">organizing toolkit</a><span> of a Palestine Solidarity Working Group – “They are verrrry well organized”, one member exclaimed – to working directly with high-level tech executives to fire pro-Palestinian employees.&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><p><span>Sometimes it is unclear whether the group’s members actually have elite IDF and Israeli government connections, or are merely engaging in idle bluster. Saar Gillai, chair of Liquid Instruments and board member to several other tech companies, said he had passed the Palestinian solidarity organizing document "to 'friends' in places s tarting [sic] with 8....," an apparent reference to Israeli military intelligence Unit 8200. </span><a href="https://www.idf.il/en/mini-sites/directorates/military-intelligence-directorate/military-intelligence-directorate/" rel="">Unit 8200</a><span> is both a massive communications interception operation -- Israel’s rough equivalent to the U.S. National Security Agency -- and an elite intelligence analysis and cybersecurity unit that has become a springboard for Israel’s </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/20/from-the-8200-to-silicon-valley/" rel="">booming tech startup sector</a><span>. Gillai served in the IDF’s Military Intelligence Directorate, the parent organization of Unit 8200, from 1985 to 1992, according to his </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gillai/" rel="">LinkedIn page</a><span>.</span></p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/batsheva-moshe/" rel="">Batsheva Moshe</a><span>, the Wix executive who organized the firing of Ms. Carey, moderated the Zoom call with Fisher and Major Weiss, and promoted the event within the WhatsApp group run by Mr. Hermoni, the managing partner of </span><a href="https://www.j-ventures.com/" rel="">J-Ventures</a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p></div><p>Ms. Moshe did not respond to a request for comment.</p><div><p><span>The organized firing of Carey was one many attempts by tech executives and other participants in the WhatsApp logs to penalize pro-Palestinian speech. J-Ventures similarly mobilized efforts among its team to place pressure on several university campuses against student-led events. On Oct. 16, a WhatsApp member Daniel A. Bock, an Arizona-based technology lawyer, forwarded a message calling attention to Rep. Tlaib’s scheduled appearance at Arizona State University for an event with Arizona Palestine Network, a pro-Palestine advocacy group. "Let’s call ASU and get this thing cancelled [sic]. Can we do this in one day?” Bock wrote, alongside contact information for ASU officials and the Scottsdale, Ariz. mayor's office.</span></p><p><span>Several members chimed in with approval for the effort. One participant even suggested that they appeal to the university’s “woke” aversion to exposing students to uncomfortable ideas. &nbsp; The participant drafted a sample letter claiming that Tlaib’s appearance threatened ASU’s “commitment to a safe and inclusive environment.” The following day, ASU officially canceled the Tlaib event, citing “procedural issues.” The WhatsApp group shared the news and celebrated the decision. </span></p><p><span>The WhatsApp group mustered similar efforts against pro-Palestinian activists and writers. Lior Netzer, a business consultant based in Massachusetts, and a member of the J-Ventures WhatsApp group, requested help pressuring the University of Vermont to cancel a lecture with Mohammed El-Kurd, a Palestinian writer for The Nation magazine. Netzer shared a sample script that alleged that El-Kurd had engaged in anti-Semitic speech in the past.</span></p><p><span>The effort also </span><a href="https://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/story/news/2023/10/25/uvm-cancels-palestinian-speaker-mohammed-el-kurd-middle-east-war/71304336007/" rel="">appeared</a><span> to be successful. Shortly after the letter-writing campaign, UVM canceled the talk, citing safety concerns. </span></p><p><span>The pro-Israel organizing efforts to silence pro-Palestinian speech raises concerns with some observers of the conflict.</span></p><p><span>“You can disagree with critics of Israel, you can oppose what they're saying,” noted the Quincy Institute’s Clifton. “But this is an effort to constrain the debate in an underhanded manner.”</span></p></div><div><p><span>The Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, a civil libertarian group that has long defended controversial speech on campus, likewise expressed its disapproval.</span></p><p><span>“FIRE is deeply concerned by cancellations of speaking events and retaliation against individuals for their speech about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,” Aaron Terr, FIRE’s director of public advocacy, said in a statement. “This censorship raises First Amendment issues when perpetrated by government actors like state colleges.”</span></p><p><span>“In times like these, with political tensions running high, it’s especially important that colleges and other institutions whose very purpose is to foster free expression facilitate dialogue instead of shutting it down,” Terr added.</span></p><p><span>The WhatsApp group maintained a special focus on elite universities and white-collar professional positions. Group members not only circulated multiple petitions to fire professors and blacklist students from working at major law firms for allegedly engaging in extremist rhetoric, but a J-Ventures spreadsheet lists specific task force teams to "get professors removed who teach falcehoods [sic] to their students." The list includes academics at Cornell University, the University of California, Davis, and NYU’s Abu Dhabi campus, among others.</span></p></div><p><span>Many of the messages in the group focused on ways in which to shape student life at Stanford University, including support for pro-Israel activists. The attempted interventions into campus life at times hinged on the absurd.

In the midst of its pro-Israel advocacy, the firm’s leadership reminded the WhatsApp group of their high-profile ties. The investment fund touted the fact that two of its portfolio companies were the only two start-ups to be included in the </span><a href="https://apecceosummit2023.com/program/" rel="">APEC CEO Summit</a><span> in San Francisco with President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping. The CEO of one of these two start-ups, Adam Tartakovsky of Epic Cleantec, was also widely described as the primary lobbying connection between J-Ventures and California Governor Gavin Newsom.</span></p><p>The influence extended beyond the business and tech world and into politics. The J-Ventures team includes advocates with the most powerful pro-Israel lobbying organization, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, better known as AIPAC. Officials in the J-Ventures group include investor David Wagonfeld, whose biography states he is “leading AIPAC Silicon Valley;” Tartakovsky, listed as “AIPAC Political Chair;” Adam Milstein, a real estate executive and major AIPAC donor; and AIPAC-affiliated activists Drs. Kathy Fields and Garry Rayant. Kenneth Baer, a former White House advisor to President Barack Obama and communications counsel to the Anti-Defamation League, is also an active member of the group. </p><p>Members of the group who are involved with AIPAC helped advise other group members on how to approach Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) about a meeting. Although the lawmaker was initially scheduled to address the group over Zoom, J-Ventures repeatedly rescheduled, and ultimately canceled the event after members of the WhatsApp group objected to Khanna’s ties to Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), whom Saar Gillai, chair of Liquid Instruments, called "the ultimate anti Israel Jew." Despite the group meeting never taking place, as confirmed by Rep. Khanna, Hermoni shared a photo with the group on Nov. 6 of the two having lunch outside of an Italian restaurant in Los Altos, Calif.</p><div><p><span>J-Ventures also had to cancel a planned Oct. 30 meeting with former Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, the </span><a href="https://www.axios.com/2021/06/14/israels-pm-tech-millionare-naftali-bennett" rel="">founder</a><span> of a multimillion-dollar tech startup. The in-person meeting with Bennett had been scheduled long before the Oct. 7 terror attacks, after which Bennett was no longer available. </span></p><p><span>Reached for comment, Rep. Khanna confirmed that he met with Hermoni, but that the scheduled J-Ventures Zoom call was canceled. The congressman noted that he enjoys broad support from the tech community. “Some have commented on my strong stance against anti-Semitism and Islamophobia and appreciated that,” he said. “I’ve tried to bring people in my district together and foster civil dialogue.”</span></p></div><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffda2cc7b-407f-4b7e-b732-250fd9024872_1600x900.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffda2cc7b-407f-4b7e-b732-250fd9024872_1600x900.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffda2cc7b-407f-4b7e-b732-250fd9024872_1600x900.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffda2cc7b-407f-4b7e-b732-250fd9024872_1600x900.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffda2cc7b-407f-4b7e-b732-250fd9024872_1600x900.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_2400,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffda2cc7b-407f-4b7e-b732-250fd9024872_1600x900.png" width="1200" height="675" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/fda2cc7b-407f-4b7e-b732-250fd9024872_1600x900.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:false,&quot;imageSize&quot;:&quot;large&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:819,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:1200,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffda2cc7b-407f-4b7e-b732-250fd9024872_1600x900.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffda2cc7b-407f-4b7e-b732-250fd9024872_1600x900.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffda2cc7b-407f-4b7e-b732-250fd9024872_1600x900.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffda2cc7b-407f-4b7e-b732-250fd9024872_1600x900.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>A photo of U.S. Congressman Ro Khanna (D-CA) and J-Ventures managing partner Oded Hermoni sitting outside of The American Italian Delicatessen at 139 Main Street in Los Altos, Calif. Mr. Hermoni shared the picture with the J-Ventures WhatsApp group on November 6, 2023.</figcaption></figure></div><p>The extensive donor network of J-Ventures also helped bankroll high-priced advocacy efforts. The group raised money for 84 billboards in Toronto, Canada, a digital billboard in Las Vegas, and, “in key locations such as Times Square in New York and all over London,” according to their planning documents. One of the biggest coups by the J-Ventures team was a successful effort to secure funding to air a special television advertisement on the Tonight Show, MSNBC, Fox News, and CNN calling for the release of the hostages taken by Hamas.</p><p>Other fundraising efforts from J-Ventures included an emergency fund to provide direct support for IDF units, including the naval commando unit Shayetet-13. The leaked planning document also uncovers attempts to supply the mostly female Caracal Battalion with grenade pouches and to donate M16 rifle scope mounts, “FN MAG” machine gun carrier vests, and drones to unnamed IDF units. According to the planning document, customs enforcement barriers have stranded many of the packages destined for the IDF in Montana and Colorado.</p><p>We reached out to Hermoni with a detailed request for comment about J-Ventures and the WhatsApp group’s goals, including the military materiel shipments; the extent of Andy David’s involvement in the initiative; and what he sees as the group’s biggest accomplishments to date.&nbsp;</p><p>Hermoni did not reply directly. Instead, the morning after being reached for comment, Hermoni warned the WhatsApp group against cooperating with our inquiries. “Two journalists … are trying to have an anti semi[tic] portrait of our activity to support israel and reaching out to members,” he wrote. “Please ignore them and do not cooperate.” he advised.

An automated form letter provided by the group denounces the BBC for, among other things, employing a journalist who "writes of casualties in Gaza" and blames "Western media for being complicit in Israel's attack." Another BICOM campaign encourages residents of the UK to write to Ofcom, the media regulator, to complain of anti-Israel bias in British media. </span></p><p><span>The J-Ventures group pooled efforts to guide reporters from ABC News and other major stations. In its list of action items, the group noted that “NPR is looking for personal stories of how the ‘Mideast crisis’ is affecting people in the US” and called for assistance with locating college students to respond.</span></p></div><p>And at times, the boundaries between journalism and advocacy have significantly blurred since Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack. One notable group is HonestReporting, a nonprofit that describes itself as a journalism watchdog devoted to "truth, integrity and fairness, and to combat ideological prejudice in journalism and the media, as it impacts Israel." The website for the organization touts its "objectivity" and educational resources designed to filter out what it sees as anti-Israel media bias.</p><p><span>HonestReporting </span><a href="https://honestreporting.com/photographers-without-borders-ap-reuters-pictures-of-hamas-atrocities-raise-ethical-questions/" rel="">produced a report</a><span> in November alleging that Palestinian photojournalists who captured pictures of Hamas fighters during the Oct. 7 attack had coordinated with the terror group, making the journalists legitimate targets for the IDF. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu’s office agreed, </span><a href="https://twitter.com/IsraeliPM/status/1722548245430141186" rel="">writing on X</a><span>, “These journalists were accomplices in crimes against humanity; their actions were contrary to professional ethics.” And Danny Danon, an Israeli cabinet minister, </span><a href="https://twitter.com/dannydanon/status/1722700128224473143" rel="">promised on X</a><span> to “hunt them down together with the terrorists.”</span></p><p><span>HonestReporting drew some blood. CNN and AP cut ties with Gaza-based freelance photographer </span><a href="https://themessenger.com/news/cnn-fires-journalist-gaza-hassan-eslaiah" rel="">Hasan Eslaiah</a><span> after HonestReporting released its report, and later, posted a photo of Eslaiah </span><a href="https://twitter.com/HonestReporting/status/1722374178991444219?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1722374178991444219%7Ctwgr%5E01070129b5472f1da3c67e9817def45fe87837f0%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fthemessenger.com%2Fnews%2Fgaza-journalist-who-worked-for-cnn-and-ap-reportedly-seen-getting-kiss-from-hamas-leader" rel="">getting a kiss</a><span> from Yahya Sinwar, the head of Hamas in Gaza.</span></p><p><span>But the advocacy group’s “just asking questions”-style report mostly backfired. </span><a href="https://www.reutersagency.com/en/media-center/reuters-statement-on-baseless-report-november-11-2023/" rel="">Reuters</a><span>, </span><a href="https://blog.ap.org/ap-statement-on-gaza-freelancers" rel="">AP</a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.nytco.com/press/statement-on-yousef-masoud/" rel="">the New York Times</a><span>, and </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/09/media/news-outlets-deny-prior-knowledge-of-hamas-attack/index.html" rel="">CNN</a><span> denied any prior knowledge of Eslaiah or other freelancers coordinating with Hamas. Some of the outlets went further, condemning HonestReporting’s work for jeopardizing the safety of freelance journalists working in a war zone. The New York Times, for example, </span><a href="https://www.nytco.com/press/statement-on-yousef-masoud/" rel="">said in a statement</a><span>, “We are gravely concerned that unsupported accusations and threats to freelancers endangers them and undermines work that serves the public interest.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>HonestReporting ended up on the defensive. Rather than apologize though, the lead author of the report, Gil Hoffman, a former Jerusalem Post reporter who is now executive director of HonestReporting, deflected criticism by asserting that his organization had “raised questions” without providing definitive answers. Hoffman </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231203150156/https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-advocacy-group-accepts-news-outlets-had-no-prior-warning-hamas-attack-2023-11-10/" rel="">told Reuters</a><span> that he accepted the news organizations’ denials and was “so relieved” to hear them. He also condemned Israeli government officials for what he saw as taking liberties with the report.&nbsp;</span></p><p>When speaking to an audience of fellow hasbara warriors though, Hoffman was more celebratory, touting the report as an unadulterated success. In a Nov. 15 talk he gave to the Hasbara Fellowships as part of its leadership briefing series, Hoffman explained that his exposé “attracted attention all around the world” and made “the world remember October 7, which they had forgotten.” The release of the HonestReporting report suggesting that Palestinian journalists are actually Hamas operatives, Hoffman continued, shifted attention away from the IDF war in Gaza and cast doubt on the reliability of reports from inside Gaza. “You can’t trust the journalists that come out of Gaza,” Hoffman argued. “They could have saved lives and instead took pictures that highlighted the achievements of Hamas.”</p><p><span>Speaking to the Hasbara Fellowships audience, Hoffman also characterized himself as a foot soldier in a wider war on behalf of Israel, rather than a media watchdog primarily concerned with combating bias, as its </span><a href="https://honestreporting.com/about/" rel="">website suggests</a><span>. “There are three battles going on right now for Israel’s existence,” he said. Those battles, he explained, take place on the military battlefield, on college campuses, and the one in which HonestReporting engages, “the media battlefield.” </span></p><p>Victory on the “media battlefield,” Hoffman concluded, “eases pressure on IDF to go quicker, to wrap up” and “goes a long way to deciding how much time Israel has to complete an operation.”</p></div></div>]]></description>

Hi,

I encountered a kernel panic with the 3.1.0 kernel on a Dell Latitude
E6410 while inputting simultaneously from the integrated keyboard with
a cat and from the external keyboard myself. I was trying to type my
password with the external keyboard (pw dialog already visible), but I
noticed that the computer didn't seem responsive to my typing. Then
suddenly the cat shifted his position and there was a kernel panic
involving input handling. I'm now using i8042.nokbd kernel parameter
as a workaround, something I've found useful also earlier.

I wonder if anyone else is experiencing similar problems? This didn't
seem to happen with 3.0, which was the first kernel version I used on
this E6410. Although it has to be noted that the internal keyboard
input was not yet as heavy either at that time. Please test if you can
reproduce the problem.

Photos of the panic at <a href="http://people.debian.org/~timo/kernelpaniccat/">http://people.debian.org/~timo/kernelpaniccat/</a>.
The first one was taken about ten seconds after the panic and shows
the original cat positioning. The two other ones show alternative
possible positions together with more of the panic text. There is also
one photo showing the pre-crash setup, which I happened to take
without anticipating a panic. The similar but black input weight was
not in use.

The kernel was tainted because the Intel "mei" module from staging was
loaded. The kernel used was the final 3.1 from the ubuntu mainline ppa
archives for amd64.

Thank you,

Timo Jyrinki

Your cat wanted to find out what the magic in "magic SysRq key" means

Yes, it was a catastrophe.

Truth is, cats are great panic generators and as fuzzy beings themselves,
they're also great fuzzers.  Only, normally they restrict themselves to
fuzzing clothes, computer fans, their owner's food, spreadsheets, the nose
of anyone alergic to catty fuzzy feelings in a 100m radius, word
processors, and IRS forms.

However, it is the first time I've seen documented proof that a cat
sucessfully fuzzed an input device into a panic.  Must be a lolcat's revenge
to the lack of mouses since touchpads took over.  And Linux has no
cat-proofing for the keyboard and touchpads[1], which will leave us
wide-open to surprise fuzzer attacks from the lolcats!  Maybe we should
issue a CVE about it?

;-)

[1] Windows _has_ third-party cat-proofing for keyboards, by detecting
clustered pressing of nearby keys.  I don't think it can yet figure out a
catpaw press on the touchpad, however.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
	<p><span><span>T</span></span>he Food and Drug Administration on Friday approved the world’s first medicine based on CRISPR gene-editing technology, a groundbreaking treatment for <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/12/04/sickle-cell-crispr-exa-cel-casgevy-history/">sickle cell disease</a> that delivers a potential cure for people born with the chronic and life-shortening blood disorder.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/11/16/crispr-vertex-sickle-cell-beta-thalassemia-casgevy-approval/">new medicine</a>, called Casgevy, is made by Vertex Pharmaceuticals and CRISPR Therapeutics. Its authorization is a <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/11/19/crispr-casgevy-jennifer-doudna-feng-zhang-emmanuelle-charpentier-george-church/">scientific triumph</a> for the technology that can efficiently and precisely repair DNA mutations — ushering in a new era of genetic medicines for inherited diseases.</p>
<p>In a clinical trial, Casgevy was shown to eliminate recurrent episodes of debilitating pain caused by sickle cell, which afflicts approximately 100,000 people in the U.S., a vast majority of whom are Black. The therapy, whose scientific name is exa-cel, is described as a potential cure because the genetic fix enabled by CRISPR is designed to last a lifetime, although confirmation will require years of follow-up.</p>
<p>The FDA decision comes three weeks after <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/11/16/u-k-approves-worlds-first-crispr-based-medicine/">regulators in the U.K.</a> were the first to clear the drug. Approval in the European Union is expected next year. The FDA is also expected to rule on exa-cel as a treatment for beta thalassemia, another inherited blood disorder, by March 30.</p>
<p>The FDA on Friday also approved another sickle cell treatment, a gene therapy from Bluebird Bio called Lyfgenia. Patients will now have the option of two cutting-edge therapies that provide potentially curative benefits.</p>
<p>“We are celebrating,” said Lewis Hsu, chief medical officer at the Sickle Cell Disease Association of America and director of the pediatric sickle cell program at the University of Illinois at Chicago. “This decision has been a long time coming, pretty much since the first description of sickle cell as a genetic disease some 70 years ago.”</p>
<p>Scientists Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna published their first CRISPR paper just over a decade ago. In 2020, the research <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/10/07/two-crispr-scientists-win-nobel-prize-in-chemistry/">won the pair a Nobel Prize</a>. Reflecting on the approval of Casgevy, Charpentier told STAT via email that she was “excited and pleased” for what it means for patients and their families.</p>
<p>“This milestone certainly underscores the importance of fundamental research in the field of microbiology,” added Charpentier, who is also a scientific co-founder of CRISPR Therapeutics. “I am truly amazed at the speed at which CRISPR research and applications have developed to get us to this historic moment.”</p>
<p><iframe title="New CRISPR-based sickle cell treatment, explained" width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2sAGtqm3o1g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The biotechnology era began in the 1980s with the invention of protein-based drugs made from genetically modified animal cells. Four decades later, the arrival of the first CRISPR therapy establishes a new industry benchmark that could deliver cures for an array of inherited diseases.</p>
<p>“Casgevy’s approval by the FDA is momentous: It is the first CRISPR-based gene-editing therapy to be approved in the U.S.,” Vertex CEO Reshma Kewalramani said. “As importantly, Casgevy is a first-in-class treatment that offers the potential of a one-time transformative therapy for eligible patients with sickle cell disease. I want to convey my deepest gratitude to the patients and investigators whose trust in this program paved the way for this landmark approval.”</p>
<p>But for all its virtues, whether or not Casgevy, as well as Lyfgenia, becomes a widely used treatment for people living with sickle cell — undoing decades of <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/05/12/deluge-genome-editing-therapies-sickle-cell-disease/">scientific neglect</a> and <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2017/09/18/sickle-cell-pain-treatment/">medical racism</a> — remains an open question.</p>
		
		
<p>Vertex set the price of Casgevy at $2.2 million compared to $3.1 million for Bluebird’s Lyfgenia. Bluebird’s gene therapy for thalassemia, approved last year, has a list price of $2.8 million.</p>
<p>The therapies are also not easy to receive. Patients must spend weeks, even months, in the hospital before and after the therapy is administered. And some of the preparatory steps can cause serious side effects, including severe infections, nausea, painful mouth sores, and <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/12/06/sickle-cell-infertility-crispr-vertex-casgevy-bluebird/">infertility</a>.</p>
<p>“I think there will be immediate uptake in some portion of the patients who have more severe disease — frequent pain episodes that cause hospitalization and require opioids for the treatment of pain,” David Williams, chief of the division of hematology-oncology at Boston Children’s Hospital and an expert in treating sickle cell disease, said ahead of the anticipated approval of Casgevy. “But there could be bumps in the road,” he added, if Vertex and CRISPR Therapeutics run into trouble making the complicated treatment, or if its high price tag <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/03/07/crispr-sickle-cell-access/">erects barriers</a> to reimbursement and access.</p>
		
		
<p>“I’m skeptical that this will open the floodgates, as some people are predicting,” said Akshay Sharma, a physician who treats children with sickle cell at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital. Casgevy has the potential to be a “transformative therapy,” Sharma added, but “I would expect physicians and patients to be nervous and hesitant” until its long-term efficacy and safety are better defined.</p>
<p>Sickle cell disease is caused by a mutation in the gene responsible for the production of oxygen-carrying hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells. The mutation causes red blood cells to become misshapen. Under a microscope, they look like crescents or sickles, which gives the disease its name. When sickled red cells clump together, they clog blood vessels, robbing tissues of oxygen and causing bouts, or “crises,” of extreme pain, hospitalizations, organ damage, stroke, and early death.</p>
<p>Physicians who treat people with sickle cell today prescribe a number of medicines that can reduce the frequency of pain crises, increase hemoglobin levels, or ameliorate symptoms, but none targets the underlying genetic cause of the disease. Stem cell transplants can be curative, but the procedure requires patients to have a donor with matched immune cells, which occurs infrequently.</p>

<p>This is what makes Casgevy different. It edits a patient’s own blood stem cells to produce high levels of fetal hemoglobin — the healthy, oxygen-carrying form of the protein that is produced during fetal development but normally shuts down soon after birth. Researchers had previously identified a certain genetic mutation that causes fetal hemoglobin to persist into adulthood. When this happens to people with sickle cell, their disease is mild and outcomes are greatly improved.</p>
<p>Casgevy uses the CRISPR-Cas9 enzyme to mimic this protective genetic mutation. It makes a cut at a specific spot in a gene called BCL11A. The edit, in turn, disables a DNA brake on the production of fetal hemoglobin.</p>
<p>Bluebird’s gene therapy works through another route, delivering, with the help of a virus, a copy of a gene into patients’ cells that enables them to produce healthy hemoglobin. In a clinical trial, 28 out of 32 patients lived free of pain crises during the study period after receiving Lyfgenia.</p>
<p>The clinical trial conducted by Vertex and CRISPR Therapeutics that supported Casgevy’s approval enrolled 30 people with sickle cell, aged 12 to 35, who were, on average, experiencing four severe pain episodes per year and just under three hospitalizations per year.</p>

<p>Within three months of receiving a single Casgevy infusion, all of the study participants began producing protective levels of fetal hemoglobin. All but one of the participants achieved the main goal of the study — freedom from severe pain episodes for at least one year following treatment. Twenty-eight participants remained free of pain episodes for an average of 22 months. The first person treated with Casgevy in the clinical trial, <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/03/07/crispr-sickle-cell-access/">a woman named Victoria Gray</a>, has now gone more than four years without a severe pain episode.</p>
<p>The FDA recently <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/10/31/fda-advisory-panel-vertex-crispr-exa-cel-sickle-cell/">held a</a> meeting with outside experts about Casgevy, which focused on “off-target” editing — that is, <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/10/27/fda-has-some-safety-concerns-about-crispr-based-sickle-cell-treatment-documents-show/">any potential inadvertent changes</a> the medicine may make in patients’ cells — underscoring how scientists and regulators are adapting to this new class of genetic medicines. On Friday, the FDA said the treatment’s label will include a caution about the “potential” risk of off-target edits.</p>
<p>“Genome editing is something special and it may redefine the paradigm of medicine over the next 30-40 years,” said CRISPR Therapeutics CEO Samarth Kulkarni. “Exa-cel’s approval represents the start of it. “We can fundamentally alter the genes that cause disease to create a functional, lifelong solution with a single administration. That’s a new paradigm, and it’s only powered by genome editing.”</p>
<p>CRISPR Therapeutics was founded in 2013 soon after Charpentier and Doudna published their seminal CRISPR paper. Work on what is now <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/12/04/sickle-cell-crispr-exa-cel-casgevy-history/">Casgevy started in earnest two years later,</a> with Vertex on board as a partner and investor. The first clinical trial involving patients with sickle cell began in 2019.</p>
<p>Casgevy is often described as a one-time treatment, but that convenience underrepresents the arduous and lengthy steps required before it’s administered. Patients first have their blood stem cells removed through a process called apheresis; the cells are then shipped off to a company-run manufacturing lab where they are edited. While cells are prepared, patients must undergo a preparatory treatment with a chemotherapy drug to remove any native stem cells that might remain in their bone marrow.</p>
<p>This “conditioning” step is crucial because it provides space in the bone marrow for the functional, CRISPR-edited cells to engraft and grow. But the chemotherapy drug used, called busulfan, wipes out germ-fighting immune cells and can cause serious side effects, including infertility — a particularly troublesome risk factor for people who wish to have children.</p>
<p>The actual injection of Casgevy is quick, but patients must remain in the hospital for weeks until their immune system recovers and the risk of serious infection abates.</p>
		
		
<p>Vertex estimates about 25,000 people in the U.S. and Europe might be good candidates for Casgevy — consisting mostly of people with more severe disease who are willing to undergo the arduous procedure and accept the risks.</p>
<p>“The initial patients will be motivated because they’ve been following, they’re interested, and they believe the benefits outweigh the risks and the current challenges,” said David Altshuler, Vertex’s chief scientific officer. “But I think the other thing that will happen is a sort of community aspect, where patients will be watching other patients in their care centers and in their community. Over time, that will build confidence and trust.”</p>
<p>Both regulators in the U.K. and the FDA approved Casgevy for people as young as 12.</p>
<p>“We’ve heard consistently from physicians that they are interested in treating patients who are younger,” said Stuart Arbuckle, Vertex’s chief operating officer. “The disease has taken hold less, and so these patients have fewer complications and more of a lifetime of benefit to gain. And they tend to be able to schedule this procedure into their life a bit easier than a working adult. They also tend to do really well versus older people.”</p>
<p>Sharma, the sickle cell expert at St. Jude’s, intends to take a more cautious approach.</p>
<p>“As long as we don’t have evidence of long-term safety, I would be hesitant to expose young children to this therapy, which is still so novel,” he said. “I think the ideal patient is an adult who has severe disease not controlled by currently available treatments.”</p>
<p>Hsu, the University of Illinois physician, has already started speaking to his patients about undergoing treatment with Casgevy. Patients with more severe sickle cell disease “who have seen how bad it can be, especially as they grow older” are likely to be the first to seek out treatment, he said.</p>
<p>He’s also counseled some adolescent patients who expressed initial interest in Casgevy but have since decided to wait because the medicines they take today to control their disease are working. “These are younger people whose organs are in good enough shape that they could go through this, and their disease severity is high enough that they would be eligible.”</p>
<p>Vertex, which is running point on Casgevy’s commercial launch, has said previously that it expects a slow uptake, given the complexity of treatment and the need to sort out reimbursement and access.</p>
<p>Lyfgenia’s approval came with a black box warning about the possibility that patients who receive the therapy might later develop blood cancer and should be monitored for that risk. Two patients in trials of the drug died of blood cancers, and studies <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2109167" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2109167" data-sk="tooltip_parent">concluded</a>&nbsp;that the cancers were caused by the chemotherapy conditioning regimen for the treatment, not Lyfgenia itself.</p>

Scientists studying their vocalizations have already picked out key elements of their communication, namely clicks, sequences of which are called codas. Now, researchers led by Gašper Beuš from the University of California, Berkeley report the discovery that the acoustic properties of these clicks—for example, pitch—are “on many levels analogous to human vowels and diphthongs,” which is when one vowel sound morphs into another such as in the word “coin.” The researchers even identify two unique “coda vowels” that are “actively exchanged” in conversation between whales, which they term the a-vowel and i-vowel.&nbsp;</p></span></p><p><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>The researchers explain in their paper, <a href="https://osf.io/preprints/osf/285cs" target="_blank">published as a preprint online this week</a>, that the first clue that so-called spectral properties could be meaningful for whale speech was provided by AI. Beuš <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608021001052" target="_blank">previously developed a deep learning model</a> for human language called fiwGAN which “was trained to imitate sperm whale codas and embed information into these vocalizations.” Not only did the AI predict elements of whale vocalizations already thought to be meaningful, such as clicks, but it also singled out acoustic properties.&nbsp;</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>To follow up on the AI’s tip, the researchers analyzed a dataset of 3948 sperm whale codas recorded with hydrophones placed directly on whales between 2014 and 2018. They only analyzed one channel from the hydrophones to control for underwater effects and whale movement, and removed click timing from their visualization to better isolate patterns in the acoustic properties themselves.&nbsp;</p></span></p><p><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>These visualizations vindicated the AI’s prediction: The whales reliably exchanged codas with one or two formants—frequency peaks in the sound wave—below the 10kHz range. The researchers termed these codas “vowels,” with single-formant codas being a-vowels and two-formant codas being i-vowels. “This is by analogy to human vowels which differ in their formant frequencies,” the authors wrote. They also identified upward and downward frequency “trajectories” in these codas, which they considered analogous to diphthongs in human language.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Considering that these coda vowel patterns were very distinct and not intermixed, plus the existence of diphthongs, the researchers argue that whales are controlling the frequency of their vocalizations.&nbsp;</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>“Under our proposed view, whale clicks are equivalent to the pulses of vocal folds in human speech production,” the authors wrote. “In other words, we treat clicks as the source and the sperm whales’ resonant body (the nasal complex, including the spermaceti organ) as the filter that modulates resonant frequencies.”</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>The analogies to human speech are readily apparent. The authors note, for example, that vocal tone in Mandarin can change the meaning of otherwise identical syllables.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>“If our findings are correct, it means that the communication of sperm whales is much more complex and can carry more information than previously thought,” the researchers concluded.</p></span></p></div><div><p><h3>ORIGINAL REPORTING ON EVERYTHING THAT MATTERS IN YOUR INBOX.</h3></p><p>By signing up, you agree to the<!-- --> <a href="https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/privacy-policy/en_us/page/terms-of-use.html">Terms of Use</a> <!-- -->and<!-- --> <a href="https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/privacy-policy/en_us/page/privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a> <!-- -->&amp; to receive electronic communications from Vice Media Group, which may include marketing promotions, advertisements and sponsored content.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>This holiday season, we’re excited to introduce the newest addition to the iA family: iAノートブック, the Notebook for Writers.</p>
<p>Watermark lines guide your pen. As your words come into focus, the lines fade into the background. The iA&nbsp;Notebook has been a labor of love, spanning several years of trials and fails and deeply engaging our designer team.

<figcaption>Get a sneak peek of the iA Notebook this holiday season.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>If iA&nbsp;Writer Was a Notebook</h2>
<p>It all began with a simple question: What if iA&nbsp;Writer took the form of a physical notebook? Ten years in the making, we doubled our efforts in times of exponentially growing artificial text.</p>
<p>In the iA&nbsp;Notebook, every element is crafted to minimize distractions and enhance the joy of writing, mirroring the philosophy of iA&nbsp;Writer. Our goal was to extend the immersive focus experience enjoyed on our app to the offline realm.</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://ia.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/DSCF1299-scaled-1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683">
<figcaption>iAノートブック, made with love in Japan</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Functionality was a key consideration in our design process. We carefully selected the paper thickness and color; the binding method was chosen to ensure the books lay flat, for an unbothered writing experience. The concept of transparency also influenced the design: you will find it in the subtle watermarking on the band and the transparent wrapping paper.</p>
<h2>Fading Watermark Guidelines</h2>
<p>We wanted guidelines in the notebook, serving as a temporary scaffold to support your writing without causing distraction. The design had to reflect the core spirit of iA&nbsp;Writer: simple, clean, uncluttered. The use of ink had to be exclusively reserved for the owner’s handwritten text. After exploring different approaches, the decision to adopt delicate watermark guidelines became clear, even though its implementation demands high technical expertise and attention to detail.</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://ia.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/iA-Notebook-backlight-empty.jpg" alt="">
<figcaption><b>“It’s impossible”</b> Watermark lines. They are noticeable when holding the paper against the light. After ten iterations, the Swiss paper makers and bookbinders stopped answering our emails.</figcaption>
</figure>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://ia.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/iA-Notebook-backlight-written.jpg" alt="">
<figcaption><b>“We have to try harder”</b> Making waterlines work required a lot of testing and optimization. We went through over 100 prototypes and 20 test prints with our binder in Japan.</figcaption>
</figure>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://ia.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/full-page-blank-scaled-1.jpg" alt="">
<figcaption><b>Before:</b> When the light comes from above they are barely just noticeable. Ideal for guiding the pen.</figcaption>
</figure>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://ia.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/full-page-written-scaled-1.jpg">
<figcaption><b>After:</b> As your words come into focus, the lines fade into the background.</figcaption>
</figure>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://ia.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/iA-Notebook-lines-online.jpg">
<figcaption><b>The lines are here:</b> On an empty page the lines are visible. This needed just the right amount of ink and the right line thickness, and the right paper. Design takes time.</figcaption>
</figure>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://ia.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/iA-Notebook-no-lines.jpg">
<figcaption><b>The lines fade:</b> The stronger contrast between ink and paper make the lines fade. It’s noticeable but less striking on a photograph, since the camera doesn’t act exactly like the human eye.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>These watermark guidelines are subtle and unobtrusive, offering direction without overpowering the page. The high contrast between the discreet guidelines and the ink from your pen creates an optical illusion: the lines seem to vanish gradually as you write.</p>
<p>Once your thoughts have taken shape on the page, the lines fade into the background, allowing your text to take center stage. It’s an optical illusion, based on the way our eyes work. We focus on the highest contrast. Since the ink is stronger than the watermark lines, the watermarks appear to be invisible.</p>

<h2>Japanese Craftsmanship Extraordinaire</h2>
<p>Bringing this small project to life required a printing company with dedication, attention to detail, and a deep commitment to their craft. In the cultural context of Japanese companies, patience and continual improvement until reaching a high standard are highly valued.</p>
<p>Our bookbinding partner, located in Tokyo not far from our office, was chosen for the excellence of their past work and their genuine interest in product design. What sets them apart is not just their role as a supplier but as a true partner, actively contributing ideas to enhance the collaborative process.</p>



<h2>Want? Well…</h2>
<p>Following numerous prototypes and years of continuous collaboration, we take great pride in the final result we can share with you today. A first batch as a Christmas gift for friends and family is underway.</p>
<p>As a little gesture for Christmas this year, we’ve set aside three prototypes to be gifted to lucky raffle participants. Sign-ups are open until December 25th, and the winners will be revealed on January 15th. Oh, and we have three additional surprises coming in this year’s <a href="https://ia.net/topics/ia-winterfest" title="iA Winterfest">iA&nbsp;Winterfest</a> so head over there to join the raffle and get hints of what else is waiting under the tree.</p>
<p>If you’d like one, send us a signal. We need to simplify the production and figure out the logistics. The price depends a bit on how much interest we get. Simply sign up to our iA&nbsp;Notebook newsletter or join the raffle to show your interest. We’ll send out a preorder, early next year.</p> </div></div>]]></description>

                    Abstract
                </h3>
                <p>
                    3D reconstruction methods such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) excel at rendering photorealistic novel views of complex scenes. However, recovering a high-quality NeRF typically requires tens to hundreds of input images, resulting in a time-consuming capture process. We present ReconFusion to reconstruct real-world scenes using only a few photos. Our approach leverages a diffusion prior for novel view synthesis, trained on synthetic and multiview datasets, which regularizes a NeRF-based 3D reconstruction pipeline at novel camera poses beyond those captured by the set of input images. Our method synthesizes realistic geometry and texture in underconstrained regions while preserving the appearance of observed regions. We perform an extensive evaluation across various real-world datasets, including forward-facing and 360-degree scenes, demonstrating significant performance improvements over previous few-view NeRF reconstruction approaches.

                    (a) We optimize a NeRF to minimize a reconstruction loss \(\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{recon}\) between renderings and a few input images, as well as a sample loss \(\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{sample}\) between a rendering from a random pose and an image predicted by a diffusion model for that pose. (b) To generate the sample image, we use a PixelNeRF-style model to fuse information from the input images and to render a predicted feature map corresponding to the sample view camera pose. (c) This feature map is concatenated with the noisy latent (computed from the current NeRF rendering at that pose) and is provided to a diffusion model, which additionally uses CLIP embeddings of the input images via cross-attention. The resulting decoded output sample is used to enforce an image-space loss on the corresponding NeRF rendering (\(\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{sample}\)).

                    ReconFusion recovers consistent 3D reconstructions (top) from a diffusion model that produces image samples independently for each viewpoint (bottom). These samples are not multiview consistent, but can produce high-quality 3D reconstructions when used as a prior in optimization.

<h3>from the <i>do-not-pass-go,-do-not-collect-$200</i> dept</h3>

<p>Last year agricultural equipment giant John Deere found itself <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2022/01/28/biden-praises-right-to-repair-as-john-deere-hit-with-two-fresh-repair-lawsuits/">on the receiving end of an antitrust lawsuit</a> for its efforts to monopolize tractor repair. The lawsuits noted that the company consistently purchased competing repair centers in order to consolidate the sector and force customers into using the company’s own repair facilities, driving up costs and logistical hurdles dramatically for farmers.</p>
<p>The lawsuits also noted how the company routinely makes repair difficult and costly through the act of software locks, obnoxious DRM, and “<a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/09/21/despite-some-progress-ifixit-says-apples-dedication-to-right-to-repair-still-sucks/">parts pairing</a>” — which involves only allowing the installation of company-certified replacement parts — or mandatory collections of company-blessed components. </p>
<p>One of the lawsuits by a collection of 18 farms and farmers was <a href="https://www.404media.co/a-massive-repair-lawsuit-against-john-deere-clears-a-major-hurdle/">allowed to move forward last week</a> after a judge <a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/24178008/deere-doc.pdf">ruled against</a> the company’s motion to dismiss:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“In a forceful, 89-page memorandum, U.S. District Court Judge Iain Johnson wrote that the founder of John Deere “was an innovative farmer and blacksmith who—with his own hands—fundamentally changed the agricultural industry.” Deere the man “would be deeply disappointed in his namesake corporation” if the plaintiffs can ultimately prove their antitrust allegations against Deere the company, which are voluminous and well-documented.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>John Deere has spent years promising farmers that they’d reverse course on their efforts to monopolize repair, <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2022/06/01/john-deere-still-sucks-on-right-to-repair-despite-years-of-promises/">only to ignore their own promises</a>. The company has also been striking <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/03/24/american-farm-bureau-continues-to-sell-out-farmers-on-meaningful-right-to-repair-reform/">meaningless “memorandums of understanding”</a> with key trade groups, pinky swearing to stop their bad behavior if the groups agree to not support state or federal right to repair legislation. </p>
<p>The market isn’t going to fix this problem by itself. It’s clearly going to require a combination of antitrust reform, regulatory action, new state/federal legislation, and meaningful class action penalties before John Deere executives finally get the message. And unfortunately for them, right to repair reform continues to see stunning levels of bipartisan public support. </p>

You are not alone. This happens to a mind-blowing amount of companies and projects. Even if they know that there is this thing called QA and that we should do it, all efforts typically result in the big QA sprint right before the release. Stressful times that only make the software barely work. All of this chaos repeats in the next release cycle of course. No improvements.</p><h2 id="what-uni-teaches-you">What uni Teaches You</h2><p>The thing is, if you study computer science you don't learn how to ensure quality standards in software. Most of the time is spent on algorithmic, how a computer works, the history of some languages and concepts, etc. In addition, at least in my studies, there was a semester about project management approaches and scrum. All of which is great, but QA is missing completely. Neglecting QA is a shame because 90%+ of all students work in a company context after they finish their degrees. It will be necessary to deliver software without bugs in time.</p><h2 id="how-companies-deliver-barely-on-time">How companies deliver barely on time</h2><p>I have seen it countless times. QA standards and measures are the ones to be cut out of the project because of budget reasons first. It's oftentimes planned during the end of the project, but if development takes longer (which it often does) or scope creep comes in (which always happens), there is not enough time for QA anymore. We end up with an absolute minimum of unstructured testing and ship a digital house of cards with brittle walls.</p><p><img alt="Maximizing" loading="lazy" width="800" height="442" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://www.florianbellmann.com/static/images/blog/never-taught-qa/release-cycles.png"></p><p>In some companies or teams, there are certain QA standards in place. Commonly it's a senior member of a team who is enforcing them for the rest of the group. Most likely they learned the hard way that without QA everything will just become so much harder along the way. Unfortunately even having standards in place is not enough. It happens time and again that teams simply write tests to satisfy project management metrics.</p><h2 id="how-to-get-out-of-the-hamster-wheel">How to get out of the hamster wheel</h2><p>It took me years to build the experience and confidence to speak up about missing QA measures in projects. Arguing with managers, living through crunch-time around releases, dealing with failing production systems and looking for missing monitoring. It's not fun. The situations are similar for other improvements of the code base or project which are not directly visible to managers like Refactorings for example. But for QA it was always particularly difficult because if we didn't implement any measures, we also never learned how to do it properly.</p><p><img alt="Maximizing" loading="lazy" width="300" height="150" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://www.florianbellmann.com/static/images/blog/never-taught-qa/testfail.gif"></p><blockquote><p>When your unit test passes but integration test doesn't.</p></blockquote><p>Only speaking up and raising the discussion again and again will help to find the first steps out of the hamster wheel.</p><h3 id="speak-about-money">Speak about money</h3><p>At some point, I realized that I wasn't using the right arguments either. Explaining that the software will be 'more stable' or 'make maintenance much easier' is not palpable for someone who doesn't work in the codebase themselves. We need to speak about money. As developers, we need to speak about the cost of not doing QA. This is the language of business and managers in general. By now, I always try to frame QA measures with examples like: 'If we don't do it now, development efforts (and therefore also costs) will be up 15% in 4 months.' or 'We need to implement unit tests for all features or our release stabilization phases will take longer and longer each time. Directly related to all the features that we build, because we need to test all side effects manually each time. This will result in us making less progress each release.'</p><p>In my experience, this switch helps to bring the point home. In the end, your efforts on this will make everyone's life better. Not everyone knows it yet though.</p><h3 id="minimal-effective-dose">Minimal effective dose</h3><p>To be realistic, it's important to not over-engineer QA measures with a big upfront investment. We shouldn't block progress of the project as a whole and neither will we get the necessary buy-in from all stakeholders with this approach. I suggest always to look for the most vital parts of the application. Normally, there is a certain use case, feature or something that the whole application is built around. Some core-functionality which must work correctly in order for the software to be of value to a customer. Test that. Come up with measures and ways to ensure this is always working as expected.</p><p>I like the term 'minimal effective dose' (MED). The smallest dose that will produce the desired outcome. In QA this can be a manual testing plan, automated tests in the pipeline or something different. It's the right place to start. If the core features are ensured, you can gradually expand stability. I.e. for all new features, you add a unit test. Additionally, think about sources of information that you can't control. Like external APIs or user inputs. Find ways to validate them as well as these are more obvious places in which your software can crash because of misuse. Iterate and increment. Also on QA.</p><h3 id="things-i-look-out-for">Things I look out for</h3><p>For each new project that I start or join I look out for a QA concept. However small it might be, the team should have thought about it.</p><ul><li>What are we shipping?</li><li>What do we need to ensure is working?</li><li>How do we do that?</li><li>Out of which measures do we deliberately opt-out and why?</li></ul><p>Having a written document about this plus perhaps a testing plan is a great foundation on which software can progress. It shows that we as a team thought about how we proceed. Again, thinking in terms of MED. Additionally, I suggest to review the chosen approaches regularly. I.e. once a quarter.</p><p>When writing new code, I am not using TDD, but I strongly recommend writing tests <strong>as you write the software</strong>. It's the right moment in time, to write the test. If you write the tests as you implement the feature you have the benefit that your code has to be structured in a way that is actually testable. Writing tests for existing software often reveals that a given code is way too interdependent or that single responsibility principles have been violated. Through the tests you, describe that you understood the desired behavior and made sure everything works as expected too. It's even a form of code documentation if you will.</p><h2 id="project-benefits">Project benefits</h2><p><img alt="Maximizing" loading="lazy" width="800" height="442" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://www.florianbellmann.com/static/images/blog/never-taught-qa/qa-progress.png"></p><p>When you speak up, people around you will realize that you care for the project. Raising discussions around quality and suggesting possible solutions even extends your reach as a developer. It can benefit you personally as well as the project. Quality of life for developers and managers will increase. It certainly will be noticed.</p><p>Only with QA measures can a project grow at a healthy pace.</p><h2 id="changing-projects-for-the-better">Changing projects for the better</h2><p>Are you already using QA measures in your project or is everything super brittle? Do you want to expand your developer skills and be someone to be known for writing quality software?</p><p>Start small. Think about the MED in your project. Take ownership and be the voice in your team to change things for the better. Not everyone needs to be a QA ambassador, but you can teach the people around you the approaches necessary by leading by example. Spark the discussion.</p><p>Just do it.</p><p>Cheers,<br>Flo</p></div></div>]]></description>

<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Slice</h3>
<p dir="auto">Line slicing is supported using the <code>START:STOP</code> syntax similar to Python
slicing. This allows you to skip lines at the beginning and/or end of the
<code>STDIN</code> input you would like <code>jc</code> to convert.</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>START</code> and <code>STOP</code> can be positive or negative integers or blank and allow
you to specify how many lines to skip and how many lines to process.
Positive and blank slices are the most memory efficient. Any negative
integers in the slice will use more memory.</p>
<p dir="auto">For example, to skip the first and last line of the following text, you
could express the slice in a couple ways:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ cat table.txt
      ### We want to skip this header ###
          col1       col2
          foo        1
          bar        2
      ### We want to skip this footer ###
$ cat table.txt | jc 1:-1 --asciitable
[{&quot;col1&quot;:&quot;foo&quot;,&quot;col2&quot;:&quot;1&quot;},{&quot;col1&quot;:&quot;bar&quot;,&quot;col2&quot;:&quot;2&quot;}]
$ cat table.txt | jc 1:4 --asciitable
[{&quot;col1&quot;:&quot;foo&quot;,&quot;col2&quot;:&quot;1&quot;},{&quot;col1&quot;:&quot;bar&quot;,&quot;col2&quot;:&quot;2&quot;}]"><pre>$ cat table.txt
      <span><span>#</span>## We want to skip this header ###</span>
          col1       col2
          foo        1
          bar        2
      <span><span>#</span>## We want to skip this footer ###</span>
$ cat table.txt <span>|</span> jc 1:-1 --asciitable
[{<span><span>"</span>col1<span>"</span></span>:<span><span>"</span>foo<span>"</span></span>,<span><span>"</span>col2<span>"</span></span>:<span><span>"</span>1<span>"</span></span>},{<span><span>"</span>col1<span>"</span></span>:<span><span>"</span>bar<span>"</span></span>,<span><span>"</span>col2<span>"</span></span>:<span><span>"</span>2<span>"</span></span>}]
$ cat table.txt <span>|</span> jc 1:4 --asciitable
[{<span><span>"</span>col1<span>"</span></span>:<span><span>"</span>foo<span>"</span></span>,<span><span>"</span>col2<span>"</span></span>:<span><span>"</span>1<span>"</span></span>},{<span><span>"</span>col1<span>"</span></span>:<span><span>"</span>bar<span>"</span></span>,<span><span>"</span>col2<span>"</span></span>:<span><span>"</span>2<span>"</span></span>}]</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">In this example <code>1:-1</code> and <code>1:4</code> line slices provide the same output.</p>
<p dir="auto">When using positive integers the index location of <code>STOP</code> is non-inclusive.
Positive slices count from the first line of the input toward the end
starting at <code>0</code> as the first line. Negative slices count from the last line
toward the beginning starting at <code>-1</code> as the last line. This is also the way
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/509211/understanding-slicing" rel="nofollow">Python's slicing</a>

<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Exit Codes</h3>
<p dir="auto">Any fatal errors within <code>jc</code> will generate an exit code of <code>100</code>, otherwise the
exit code will be <code>0</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">When using the "magic" syntax (e.g. <code>jc ifconfig eth0</code>),
<code>jc</code> will store the exit code of the program being parsed and add it to the <code>jc</code>
exit code. This way it is easier to determine if an error was from the parsed
program or <code>jc</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Consider the following examples using <code>ifconfig</code>:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><code>ifconfig</code> exit code</th>
<th><code>jc</code> exit code</th>
<th>Combined exit code</th>
<th>Interpretation</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><code>0</code></td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>1</code></td>
<td><code>100</code></td>
<td><code>101</code></td>
<td>Error in  both <code>ifconfig</code> and <code>jc</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p dir="auto">When using the "magic" syntax you can also retrieve the exit code of the called
program by using the <code>--meta-out</code> or <code>-M</code> option. This will append a <code>_jc_meta</code>
object to the output that will include the magic command information, including
the exit code.</p>
<p dir="auto">Here is an example with <code>ping</code>:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ jc --meta-out -p ping -c2 192.168.1.252

<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Setting Custom Colors via Environment Variable</h3>
<p dir="auto">You can specify custom colors via the <code>JC_COLORS</code> environment variable. The
<code>JC_COLORS</code> environment variable takes four comma separated string values in
the following format:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="JC_COLORS=<keyname_color>,<keyword_color>,<number_color>,<string_color>"><pre>JC_COLORS=<span>&lt;</span>keyname_color<span>&gt;</span>,<span>&lt;</span>keyword_color<span>&gt;</span>,<span>&lt;</span>number_color<span>&gt;</span>,<span>&lt;</span>string_color<span>&gt;</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Where colors are: <code>black</code>, <code>red</code>, <code>green</code>, <code>yellow</code>, <code>blue</code>, <code>magenta</code>, <code>cyan</code>,
<code>gray</code>, <code>brightblack</code>, <code>brightred</code>, <code>brightgreen</code>, <code>brightyellow</code>, <code>brightblue</code>,
<code>brightmagenta</code>, <code>brightcyan</code>, <code>white</code>, or  <code>default</code></p>
<p dir="auto">For example, to set to the default colors:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="JC_COLORS=blue,brightblack,magenta,green"><pre>JC_COLORS=blue,brightblack,magenta,green</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">or</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="JC_COLORS=default,default,default,default"><pre>JC_COLORS=default,default,default,default</pre></div>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Disable Colors via Environment Variable</h3>
<p dir="auto">You can set the <a href="http://no-color.org/" rel="nofollow"><code>NO_COLOR</code></a> environment variable to any
value to disable color output in <code>jc</code>. Note that using the <code>-C</code> option to force
color output will override both the <code>NO_COLOR</code> environment variable and the <code>-m</code>
option.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Streaming Parsers</h3>
<p dir="auto">Most parsers load all of the data from <code>STDIN</code>, parse it, then output the entire
JSON document serially. There are some streaming parsers (e.g. <code>ls-s</code> and
<code>ping-s</code>) that immediately start processing and outputting the data line-by-line
as <a href="https://jsonlines.org/" rel="nofollow">JSON Lines</a> (aka <a href="http://ndjson.org/" rel="nofollow">NDJSON</a>) while
it is being received from <code>STDIN</code>. This can significantly reduce the amount of
memory required to parse large amounts of command output (e.g. <code>ls -lR /</code>) and
can sometimes process the data more quickly. Streaming parsers have slightly
different behavior than standard parsers as outlined below.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Note: Streaming parsers cannot be used with the "magic" syntax</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Ignoring Errors</h4>
<p dir="auto">You may want to ignore parsing errors when using streaming parsers since these
may be used in long-lived processing pipelines and errors can break the pipe. To
ignore parsing errors, use the <code>-qq</code> cli option or the <code>ignore_exceptions=True</code>
argument with the <code>parse()</code> function. This will add a <code>_jc_meta</code> object to the
JSON output with a <code>success</code> attribute. If <code>success</code> is <code>true</code>, then there were
no issues parsing the line. If <code>success</code> is <code>false</code>, then a parsing issue was
found and <code>error</code> and <code>line</code> fields will be added to include a short error
description and the contents of the unparsable line, respectively:</p>
<p dir="auto">Successfully parsed line with <code>-qq</code> option:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="{
  &quot;command_data&quot;: &quot;data&quot;,
  &quot;_jc_meta&quot;: {
    &quot;success&quot;: true
  }
}"><pre>{
  <span>"command_data"</span>: <span><span>"</span>data<span>"</span></span>,
  <span>"_jc_meta"</span>: {
    <span>"success"</span>: <span>true</span>
  }
}</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Unsuccessfully parsed line with <code>-qq</code> option:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="{
  &quot;_jc_meta&quot;: {
    &quot;success&quot;: false,
    &quot;error&quot;: &quot;error message&quot;,
    &quot;line&quot;: &quot;original line data&quot;
  }
}"><pre>{
  <span>"_jc_meta"</span>: {
    <span>"success"</span>: <span>false</span>,
    <span>"error"</span>: <span><span>"</span>error message<span>"</span></span>,
    <span>"line"</span>: <span><span>"</span>original line data<span>"</span></span>
  }
}</pre></div>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Unbuffering Output</h4>
<p dir="auto">Most operating systems will buffer output that is being piped from process to
process. The buffer is usually around 4KB. When viewing the output in the
terminal the OS buffer is not engaged so output is immediately displayed on the
screen. When piping multiple processes together, though, it may seem as if the
output is hanging when the input data is very slow (e.g. <code>ping</code>):</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ ping 1.1.1.1 | jc --ping-s | jq
<slow output>"><pre><code>$ ping 1.1.1.1 | jc --ping-s | jq
&lt;slow output&gt;
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">This is because the OS engages the 4KB buffer between <code>jc</code> and <code>jq</code> in this
example. To display the data on the terminal in realtime, you can disable the
buffer with the <code>-u</code> (unbuffer) cli option:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ ping 1.1.1.1 | jc --ping-s -u | jq
{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;reply&quot;,&quot;pattern&quot;:null,&quot;timestamp&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:&quot;64&quot;,&quot;respons...}
{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;reply&quot;,&quot;pattern&quot;:null,&quot;timestamp&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:&quot;64&quot;,&quot;respons...}
..."><pre><code>$ ping 1.1.1.1 | jc --ping-s -u | jq
{"type":"reply","pattern":null,"timestamp":null,"bytes":"64","respons...}
{"type":"reply","pattern":null,"timestamp":null,"bytes":"64","respons...}
...
</code></pre></div>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Note: Unbuffered output can be slower for large data streams.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Using Streaming Parsers as Python Modules</h4>
<p dir="auto">Streaming parsers accept any iterable object and return an iterable object
allowing lazy processing of the data. The input data should iterate on lines
of string data. Examples of good input data are <code>sys.stdin</code> or
<code>str.splitlines()</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">To use the returned iterable object in your code, simply loop through it or
use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#next" rel="nofollow">next()</a>
builtin function:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="import jc

result = jc.parse('ls_s', ls_command_output.splitlines())
for item in result:
    print(item[&quot;filename&quot;])"><pre><span>import</span> <span>jc</span>

<span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>jc</span>.<span>parse</span>(<span>'ls_s'</span>, <span>ls_command_output</span>.<span>splitlines</span>())
<span>for</span> <span>item</span> <span>in</span> <span>result</span>:
    <span>print</span>(<span>item</span>[<span>"filename"</span>])</pre></div>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Parser Plugins</h3>
<p dir="auto">Parser plugins may be placed in a <code>jc/jcparsers</code> folder in your local
<strong>"App data directory"</strong>:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Linux/unix: <code>$HOME/.local/share/jc/jcparsers</code></li>
<li>macOS: <code>$HOME/Library/Application Support/jc/jcparsers</code></li>
<li>Windows: <code>$LOCALAPPDATA\jc\jc\jcparsers</code></li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Parser plugins are standard python module files. Use the
<a href="https://github.com/kellyjonbrazil/jc/blob/master/jc/parsers/foo.py"><code>jc/parsers/foo.py</code></a>
or <a href="https://github.com/kellyjonbrazil/jc/blob/master/jc/parsers/foo_s.py"><code>jc/parsers/foo_s.py (streaming)</code></a>
parser as a template and simply place a <code>.py</code> file in the <code>jcparsers</code> subfolder.
Any dependencies can be placed in the <code>jc</code> folder above <code>jcparsers</code> and can
be imported in the parser code.</p>
<p dir="auto">Parser plugin filenames must be valid python module names and therefore must
start with a letter and consist entirely of alphanumerics and underscores.
Local plugins may override default parsers.</p>

</blockquote>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Caveats</h3>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Locale</h4>
<p dir="auto">For best results set the locale environment variables to <code>C</code> or
<code>en_US.UTF-8</code> by modifying the <code>LC_ALL</code> variable:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ LC_ALL=C date | jc --date"><pre><code>$ LC_ALL=C date | jc --date
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">You can also set the locale variables individually:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ export LANG=C
$ export LC_NUMERIC=C"><pre><code>$ export LANG=C
$ export LC_NUMERIC=C
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">On some older systems UTF-8 output will be downgraded to ASCII with <code>\\u</code>
escape sequences if the <code>C</code> locale does not support UTF-8 encoding.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Timezones</h4>
<p dir="auto">Some parsers have calculated epoch timestamp fields added to the output. Unless
a timestamp field name has a <code>_utc</code> suffix it is considered naive. (i.e. based
on the local timezone of the system the <code>jc</code> parser was run on).</p>
<p dir="auto">If a UTC timezone can be detected in the text of the command output, the
timestamp will be timezone aware and have a <code>_utc</code> suffix on the key name.
(e.g. <code>epoch_utc</code>) No other timezones are supported for aware timestamps.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Use In Other Shells</h2>
<p dir="auto"><code>jc</code> can be used in most any shell. Some modern shells have JSON deserialization
and filtering capabilities built-in which makes using <code>jc</code> even more convenient.</p>
<p dir="auto">For example, the following is possible in <a href="https://ngs-lang.org/" rel="nofollow">NGS</a>
(Next Generation Shell):</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="myvar = ``jc dig www.google.com``[0].answer[0].data"><pre>myvar = <span><span>`</span><span>`</span></span>jc dig www.google.com<span><span>`</span><span>`</span></span>[0].answer[0].data</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">This runs <code>jc</code>, parses the output JSON, and assigs the resulting data structure
to a variable in a single line of code.</p>
<p dir="auto">For more examples of how to use <code>jc</code> in other shells, see this
<a href="https://github.com/kellyjonbrazil/jc/wiki/Using-jc-With-Different-Shells">wiki page</a>.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Compatibility</h2>
<p dir="auto">Some parsers like <code>dig</code>, <code>xml</code>, <code>csv</code>, etc. will work on any platform. Other
parsers that convert platform-specific output will generate a warning message if
they are run on an unsupported platform. To see all parser information,
including compatibility, run <code>jc -ap</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">You may still use a parser on an unsupported platform - for example, you may
want to parse a file with linux <code>lsof</code> output on a macOS or Windows laptop. In
that case you can suppress the warning message with the <code>-q</code> cli option or the
<code>quiet=True</code> function parameter in <code>parse()</code>:</p>
<p dir="auto">macOS:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="cat lsof.out | jc -q --lsof"><pre>cat lsof.out <span>|</span> jc -q --lsof</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">or Windows:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="type lsof.out | jc -q --lsof"><pre><span>type</span> lsof.out <span>|</span> jc -q --lsof</pre></div>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.nongnu.org/txr/txr-lisp.html">https://www.nongnu.org/txr/txr-lisp.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38569129">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page">


<p><a href="https://www.nongnu.org/txr/index.html">TXR</a> Lisp is an innovative,
original dialect from the Lisp language
family. It is not an implementation of Common Lisp, Scheme or any
existing dialect.</p>

<p>
One goals of TXR Lisp is to <span>remove
verbosity from Lisp programming</span>,
where doing so does not conflict with the Lisp ideology ("Lispiness").
This means that the primary means of making programs succinct are
semantic devices, rather than syntactic sugars. However,&nbsp; sugars
are also employed, when they are not disruptive to the surrounding
syntax.</p>

<p>Another goal of TXR Lisp is to serve as a platform for
experimentation an advancement within the context of a Lisp paradigm,
and bring together the right mix of advanced features as well as
innovative new solutions to old problems, <span>integrating these into an ergonomic whole</span>
which can be applied to real, practical tasks, right now.<br>
</p>

<h3>Imperative to be Functional</h3>

<p>TXR Lisp supports functional programming, but isn't a functional
language. The TXR project consciously rejects the purely functional
ideology. TXR Lisp supports programming with higher order functions by
providing</p>

<ul>

  <li>first-class functions (lexical closures);</li>
  <li>an expressive syntax for explicit partial evaluation;</li>
  <li>a significant standard library of userful functional combinators;<br>
  </li>
  <li>non-function objects which can be treated as functions; and</li>
  <li><span>delimited continuations</span>,
for reifying program state as a function.</li>
</ul>

<p>TXR Lisp supports imperative programming directly. It has mutable
variables, and mutable data structures such as lists, vectors, strings
and structures. It has control constructs such as loops, exception
handling and non-local exits.<br>
</p>

<h3>Strictly Eager, with a Lazy Streak</h3>

<p>TXR
Lisp is strictly evaluated. Function argument expressions are
evaluated in left to right order, before the function call takes place.
Special operators and macros evaluate forms in a predictable order.
Sequencing operations with visible effects such as I/O is easy, just
like in any mainstream imperative language. TXR Lisp, however, has
support for lazy evaluation via several features:</p>

<ul>

  <li>lazy lists based on lazy cons cell objects, deeply integrated
into the Lisp data model;<br>
  </li>
  <li>lazy instantiations OOP structures; allowing "one step" creation
of infinite, lazy structures made up of objects,&nbsp; and mutually
referencing object clusters.<br>
  </li>
  <li>explicit <code>delay</code> and <code>force</code> operators;
and<br>
  </li>
  <li>a self-referential binding operator <code>mlet</code>, which is
an advancement over Scheme's <code>letrec</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>TXR Lisp's construct for explicit laziness in the middle of a strict
language provide most of the benefits of lazy evaluation, without the
drawbacks such as poor performance, confusing semantics and clumsy
coordination of side effects which plague lazily-evaluated functional
languages.</p>

<h3>Generic Brand<br>
</h3>

<p>Unlike in mainstream Lisp dialects, TXR Lisp allows traditional list
operations like <code>car</code>, <code>cdr</code>, and <code>mapcar</code>
to be applied to vectors and character strings, which is very
expressive and useful.</p>

<h3>Lisp-1,-2 Under one Roof</h3>

<p>A classic dilemma in the design of a Lisp dialect is whether to make
it Lisp-1 or Lisp-2. That is to say, should function and variable
bindings be in one namespace or in separate namespaces? TXR Lisp
innovates in this area with a new solution which integrates both
styles. The underlying infracstructure is Lisp-2: the global and
lexical environments have function and variable namespaces. However,
Lisp-1 style evaluation of arguments (with the two namespaces
apparently folded into one) occurs in forms which are written using
square brackets instead of parentheses. This feature is deeply
integrated into the language; it cannot be implemented in Lisp-2
dialects to the same level without working at the implemenation level,
or else transforming entire top-level forms with a code walker, or else
making it an incomplete hack. Even the macro expander is aware of the
feature: when a reference to a lexical function occurs as a Lisp-1
style argument, that function shadows a symbol macro in an outer scope,
which would not be shadowed in a Lisp-2 form due to the symbol macro
being considered in a variable namespace.<br>
</p>

<p>Programming with functional arguments ("higher order functions") in
TXR Lisp is free of distracting noise like <code>funcall</code> and <code>#'</code>.
The <code>funcall</code> function exists and is named <code>call</code>,
and the function operator is called <code>fun</code>; but these are
hardly ever seen. The Common Lisp <code>#'</code> (hash quote)
notation is absent. The <code>lambda</code> operator in&nbsp; TXR
Lisp&nbsp; works directly; it isn't a macro which&nbsp; expands
to&nbsp; <code>(fun (lambda ...))</code>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet, TXR Lisp
retains the advantages of Lisp-2, such as its natural view of macro
programming and referential hygiene.</p>

<p>Incidentally, the square bracket forms in TXR Lisp provide a purer
vision of Lisp-1 than Lisp-1 dialects themselves. Proponents of Lisp-1
dialects like to say that every position of a form is
evaluated in the same way, which is more consistent than Lisp-2 which
treats the operator specially. Unfortunately, that is a lie, because
any worthwhile Lisp-1 dialect has macros. The leftmost position of a
form in any worthwhile Lisp-1 dialect must be considered in the macro
namespace. By contrast, TXR Lisp's square
bracket forms cannot be macro forms. In the form <code>[a b c]</code>,&nbsp;
the&nbsp; symbol <code>a</code> must resolve to a function, or an
object which can be used as a function. It cannot be a macro (other
than a symbol macro which simply replaces <code>a</code> with another
form). So the Lisp-1 advocacy soundbite is, ironically, true in TXR
Lisp: the arguments of a square bracketed form are all evaluated the
same way, period. </p>

<h3>Ask the Boss for Arrays</h3>

<p>Programmers who encounter one of the major Lisp dialects for the
first time usually complain about the clumsy support for working with
arrays. TXR Lisp takes heed of these complains. TXR's square bracket
forms provide array indexing and range referencing.</p>

<p>Indexing works naturally because sequences (lists, vectors and
arrays) as well as hashes are considered functions which map indexes to
elements. For instance, the form <code>(mapcar "abc" #(2 0 1))</code>
produces the vector <code>#(#\c #\a #\b)</code> because the character
string <code>"abc"</code> is a function which maps the indices 0, 1
and 2 to the character objects <code>#\a</code>, <code>#\b</code> and
<code>#\c</code>. (Also note that a vector is being processed with <code>mapcar</code>,
which is why the type which emerges is a vector).&nbsp; Therefore, the
square brackets Lisp-1 notation provides array indexing. The form <code>["abc"
1]</code>&nbsp; means "call the <code>"abc"</code> string as a
function, passing it the argument 1". The effect is that the character <code>#\b</code>
is retrieved.&nbsp; This works for lists and vectors in the same way.
For hash tables, a hash lookup is performed. If <code>h</code> is a
hash table,&nbsp; and <code>k</code> is a key, then <code>[h k]</code>
performs a lookup. Also, <code>[h k v]</code> performs a lookup such
that <code>v</code> is substituted if <code>k</code> is not found.</p>

<p>Range indexing is supported using the dotdot range notation. For
instance <code>[a 2..5]</code> denotes the slice of a starting from
element <code>[a 2]</code> up to and including <code>[a 4]</code>,
excluding <code>[a 5]</code>.&nbsp; If the symbol <code>t</code> is
used as the upper endpoint, it denotes the element one beyond the last;
in other words, the slice extends to the end. The colon symbol : can
also be used on either end to denote "from the start" or "to the end".
All of the following forms denote a slice of a <code>a</code> which
includes all of <code>a</code>:&nbsp; <code>[a :..:]</code>, <code>[a
0..:]</code>, <code>[a 0..t]</code>, <code>[a :..t]</code>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Negative indices are supported, so that -1 denotes the last element.
The expression <code>[a 0..-1]</code> calculates a slice of a which
excludes the last element.&nbsp; The dotdot notation is a syntactic
sugar, which denotes the construction of a range object: <code>a..b</code>
is converted by TXR Lisp's parser to <code>(rcons a b)</code>, a call
to the <code>rcons</code> function which constructs a range object.</p>

<p>Both element and range indexing forms support assignment as well as
deletion (if the array-like object is stored in an assignable place),
which makes for flexible and succinct array editing. For instance, if
variable <code>a</code> holds the string <code>"car"</code>, then <code>(set
[a 1..2] "ape")</code> changes <code>a</code>&nbsp; to <code>"caper"</code>.
The following example shows how we can exchange the ranges of two
arrays in a single <code>swap</code> operation:</p>

<pre><span>(</span><span>let</span> <span>((</span><span>a</span> <span>"archibald"</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>b</span> <span>"spooner"</span><span>))</span><br>  <span>(</span><span>swap</span> <span>[</span><span>a</span> <span>2</span><span>..</span><span>4</span><span>]</span> <span>[</span><span>b</span> <span>0</span><span>..</span><span>2</span><span>])</span><br>  <span>(</span><span>list</span> <span>a</span> <span>b</span><span>))</span><span></span><span>-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>"arspibald"</span> <span>"chooner"</span><span>)</span></pre>


<p>Note that although the exchanged ranges happen to be of equal length
in the example, that isn't a constraint.</p>

<h3>Strings Attached</h3>

<p>Direct interpolation of values into strings is a considerable
convenience in programming languages. Their use leads to succinct,
expressive code for string construction. Mainstream Lisp dialects are
missing the boat in this regard. TXR Lisp has better designed string
interpolation than most scripting languages.</p>

<p>Interpolated string literals are called "quasiliterals" in TXR Lisp,
and are delimited by backquotes rather than double quotes. TXR Lisp
avoids the mistaken design of featuring just one kind of string
literal, which supports interpolation. There is a need for strings
which are true literals.</p>

<p>In a backquoted string, the <code>@</code> character denotes the
insertion of the value of an expression. It is followed by an
expression directly, or an expression surrounded in curly braces.&nbsp;
The curly brace notation solves certain ambiguity problems which arise,
and also allows for the expression of modifiers for expressing field
width, left or right alignment and a separator string for merging list
elements. Example:<br>
</p>

<pre><span>(</span><span>defvarl</span> <span>str</span> <span>"abc"</span><span>)</span><br><span>(</span><span>defvarl</span> <span>words</span> <span>'</span><span>#"how now brown cow"</span><span>)</span><br><span>(</span><span>prinl</span> <span>`</span><span>@str</span><span>-</span><span>@str</span><span>`</span><span>)</span><br><span>(</span><span>prinl</span> <span>`</span><span>@{</span><span>str</span><span> </span><span>10</span><span>}</span><span>-</span><span>@{</span><span>str</span><span> </span><span>-10</span><span>}</span><span>`</span><span>)</span><br><span>(</span><span>prinl</span> <span>`Words: </span><span>@{</span><span>words</span><span> </span><span>", "</span><span> </span><span>-40</span><span>}</span><span>`</span><span>)</span>
</pre>

<p>Output:</p>
<pre>"abc-abc"<br>"abc       -       abc"<br>"Words:                     how, now, brown, cow"<br></pre>
<p>Both quasiliterals and regular string literals can be prefixed by <code>#</code> which denotes a word list. In the above example, <code>#"how now brown cow"&nbsp;&nbsp;</code> denotes the list structure <code>("how" "now" "brown" "cow").</code> This is prefixed with a quote to express the quoted list <span></span><code>'("how" "now" "brown" "cow")</code>.
The ommission of the quote is necessary because word lists can be
embedded in unevaluated structure. However, quasiliterals are
structures intended for evaluation and so the expression <code>#`how now brown cow`</code> <span>evaluates</span> to the list <code>("how" "now" "brown" "cow")</code> without the need for a quote. Quasiliteral syntax produces <span>code</span>
which, when evaluated, constructs the implied character string or list
of strings, whereas an ordinary literal denotes a string or list of
strings as program syntax.
</p>

<h3>Objectively Simple</h3>
<p>
TXR Lisp doesn't have an object system similar to Common Lisp's CLOS.  Rather,
TXR Lisp's structures make up a simple object system featuring single dispatch
and multiple inheritance.
</p>

<p>
The term "class" is avoided in TXR Lisp; rather it has
structures (structs) which have object-oriented features.
Struct types must be explicitly defined using the
<code>defstruct</code> macro, or else the underlying API that it uses.
Structs have both instance slots and static slots.  Under inheritance,
a static slot can be overriden with an instance slot or vice versa.
Methods are represented as function values stored in static slots,
and therefore methods "belong" to structs. Dispatch of a method named <code>m</code>
on an object instance <code>o</code> takes place by dispatching the function
stored in the slot named <code>m</code> of <code>o</code>. The function
receives the object as its leftmost argument, followed by the remaining
method arguments.  New static slots can be added to an existing type. Also, a
type which has an inherited static slot can break that relationship and get its
own non-inherited instance of the static slot. This is the basis for method
definitions and redefinitions outside of <code>defstruct</code>.
</p>

<p>
TXR Lisp features a dot notation for referring to struct slots, including
method slots. For instance <code>sim.start-time.(set 42)</code> means
to retrieve the slot <code>start-time</code> of the <code>sim</code>
structure, and then invoke the <code>set</code> method on that
<code>start-time</code>. This notation is a syntactic sugar for the Lisp
syntax <code>(qref sim start-time (set 42))</code>. The <code>qref</code>
symbol has a macro binding; that macro compiles the abstract syntax into
the slot references and function calls that it denotes.
</p>

<p>
Suppose we have a list of objects, and we'd like to call <code>set</code>
on their respective <code>start-time</code> members to reset their
times to zero:
</p>
<pre>(mapdo .start-time.(set 42) obj-list)</pre>
<p>
Here, the dot notation begins with a leading dot. This variant of the notation
doesn't correspond to <code>qref</code> but to <code>uref</code> (unbound reference):
<code>(uref start-time (set 42))</code>. This <code>uref</code> form compiles
into a higher order function which takes an object as an argument. That function
references the object's <code>start-time</code> slot and calls the <code>set</code>
method on it.
</p>

<p>
Objects have methods called on construction,
as well as finalizers. When the garbage collector detects an unreachable object
whose finalizers have not yet been called, the finalizers are called at that
time. An object's finalizers are also called if an exception occurs during its
construction, and may also be called explicitly before the object's lifetime
ends via the <code>call-finalizers</code> function.  The
<code>with-objects</code> macro instantiates objects in a lexical scope, and
calls their finalizers when their scope ends, enabling some aspects of the
"RAII" idiom from the C++ language to be used in TXR Lisp.

<p>During our previous Launch Week we <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37020610">announced</a> the development of a <a href="https://github.com/supabase/postgres_lsp">Postgres Language Server</a>. The response was more enthusiastic than we imagined and we received some excellent ideas.</p>
<p>This is an update on the Parser, which is the fundamental primitive of a Language Server. We’ve been through several iterations of the parser and we want to detail our explorations.</p>
<!-- -->
<details><summary>Want to learn some more acronyms?</summary><p>There will be a few acronyms in this post. We don’t want this post to be “inside baseball” so here are a few concepts that you need to know:</p><ul>
<li><em><strong>LSP / Language Server Protocol:</strong></em> Something that helps code editors understand code better. It provides functionality like linting and error detection.</li>
<li><strong>Postgres Language Server:</strong> a server that will help with Postgres programing - writing SQL, type inference, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Parser</strong>: A parser converts written code into a form that tools can work with. For example, it identifies variables in code. and then the tools can easily access those variables. We’ll describe this more below.</li>
</ul></details>
<h2 id="background-why-build-a-language-server">Background: Why build a Language Server?</h2>
<p>Postgres is gaining popularity, and yet the tooling around it still needs a lot of work. Writing SQL in editors like VSCode is a pain. One of the unique features of Supabase is the ability to access your Postgres database from a browser or mobile app through our <a href="https://supabase.com/docs/guides/api">Data APIs</a>. This means that developers are writing more <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/plpgsql.html">PL/pgSQL</a>.</p>
<p>While code editors have great support for most programming languages, SQL support is underwhelming. We want to make Postgres as simple as Python.</p>
<h2 id="language-servers-core-the-role-of-the-parser">Language Server's Core: The Role of the Parser</h2>
<p>On the highest level, a language server is a thing which</p>
<ol>
<li>accepts input source code from the client</li>
<li>turns it into a semantic model of the code</li>
<li>and provides language-specific smarts back to the client.</li>
</ol>
<figure></figure>
<p>The parser is the core of every language server. It takes the raw string, turns it into a stream of tokens, and builds a syntax tree. This syntax tree can then be used to extract structural information.</p>
<p>Usually, the parser builds a concrete <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parse_tree">syntax tree</a> (CST) before turning it into an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree">abstract syntax tree</a> (AST). A CST preserves all syntax elements present in the source code with the goal of being able to re-create the exact original source, while an AST contains only the meaning of the source. For example, take a simple expression <code>2 * (7 + 3)</code>:</p>
<!-- -->
<div><p><code><br><div><p><span>_<!-- -->15</span></p><p><span>           CST                    AST</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->15</span></p><p><span>          -----                  -----</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->15</span></p><p><span>          expr                     *</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->15</span></p><p><span>       /   |    \                /   \</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->15</span></p><p><span>  term     *   term             2     +</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->15</span></p><p><span>   |             |                   / \</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->15</span></p><p><span>factor         factor               7   3      </span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->15</span></p><p><span>   |         /   |    \</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->15</span></p><p><span>   2        (   expr   )   </span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->15</span></p><p><span>              /  |  \</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->15</span></p><p><span>          term   +  term</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->15</span></p><p><span>            |        |</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->15</span></p><p><span>          factor   factor</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->15</span></p><p><span>            |        |</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->15</span></p><p><span>            7        3</span></p></div><br></code></p></div>
<h2 id="implementing-a-parser-for-postgres">Implementing a Parser for Postgres</h2>
<p>Implementing a parser for Postgres is challenging because of the ever-evolving and complex syntax of Postgres. Even <code>select</code> statements are very complex to parse. Then there are common table expressions, sub-queries and the like. This is one of the reasons why existing Postgres tooling is scarce, badly maintained, and often does not work well.</p>
<p>We decided to not create a custom parser. Instead, we leverage <a href="https://github.com/pganalyze/libpg_query">libpg_query</a> to parse SQL code reliably. The pganalyze team has a published a great blog post on <a href="https://pganalyze.com/blog/parse-postgresql-queries-in-ruby">why this approach is preferable</a>.</p>
<p>However, libpg<em>query is designed to parse _executable</em> SQL — not to provide language intelligence. Using it for a language server means adapting it to our specific use case. Let’s explore how we adapted it:</p>
<h3 id="tokenization">Tokenization</h3>
<p>Before any syntax tree can be built, the input string needs to be converted into a stream of tokens. libpg_query exposes a <code>scan</code> API that returns all non-whitespace tokens of the source, even for invalid SQL. For example, a simple statement <code>select '1';</code> returns</p>
<div><p><code><br><div><p><span>_<!-- -->18</span></p><p><span>ScanToken {</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->18</span></p><p><span>        start: 0,</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->18</span></p><p><span>        end: 6,</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->18</span></p><p><span>        token: Select,</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->18</span></p><p><span>        keyword_kind: ReservedKeyword,</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->18</span></p><p><span>},</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->18</span></p><p><span>ScanToken {</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->18</span></p><p><span>		    start: 7,</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->18</span></p><p><span>		    end: 10,</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->18</span></p><p><span>        token: Sconst,</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->18</span></p><p><span>        keyword_kind: NoKeyword,</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->18</span></p><p><span>},</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->18</span></p><p><span>ScanToken {</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->18</span></p><p><span>        start: 10,</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->18</span></p><p><span>        end: 11,</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->18</span></p><p><span>        token: Ascii59,</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->18</span></p><p><span>        keyword_kind: NoKeyword,</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->18</span></p><p><span>}</span></p></div><br></code></p></div>
<p>Every <code>ScanToken</code> token contains its variant, a range, and a keyword kind. To simplify the implementation of the parser, we extract the text for each token using the range for now. We arrive at the following <code>Token</code> struct.</p>

<h3 id="conversion-to-a-syntax-tree">Conversion to a Syntax Tree</h3>
<p>To transform the stream of tokens into a syntax tree, we face the first challenges with <code>libpg_query</code>. In a language server, it's important to handle incomplete or improperly formatted input gracefully. When an error occurs you don’t want the parser to “stop”. You want it to check for <em>all</em> errors in your code:</p>
<div><p><code><br><div><p><span>_<!-- -->10</span></p><p><span>create table posts (</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->10</span></p><p><span>  id serial primary key # &lt;- ERR: missing comma, Parser should continue</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->10</span></p><p><span>  content text</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->10</span></p><p><span>);</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->10</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->10</span></p><p><span>create table comments (</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->10</span></p><p><span>  id serial primary key,</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->10</span></p><p><span>  post_id int references posts # &lt;- ERR: missing comma, second error returned</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->10</span></p><p><span>  comment text</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->10</span></p><p><span>);</span></p></div><br></code></p></div>
<p>Unfortunately, the <code>parse</code> api from <code>libpg_query</code> only parses the entire input — if any SQL statement contains a syntax error, an error is returned for the entire input.</p>
<p>To overcome this, we implemented a resilient <code>source</code> parser. This parser breaks the input into individual SQL statements and parses them one by one, allowing us to handle syntax errors within each statement independently. It is implemented as a top-down <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LL_parser">LL parser</a>. Specifically, the parser iterates the token stream left-to-right, and checks if the cursor currently is at the start of a new statement. Once a statement is entered, it walks the tokens until <code>;</code> or another statement start is encountered while skipping sub-statements.</p>
<p>Luckily, Postgres statements always start with distinct keywords. An update statement is identifiable with <code>update</code>, a delete statement with <code>delete from</code>. There are a few statements that need more than the first few tokens to be distinguishable, but we only care about whether there is a statement, and not what statement there is exactly, so ambiguity is very much acceptable.</p>
<p>For the implementation, we only need to provide the distinct keywords each statement starts with and compare it to the current tokens using a lookahead mechanism.</p>

<h3 id="reverse-engineering-the-cst">Reverse-Engineering the CST</h3>
<p>The second limitation we encountered: <code>libpg_query</code> only exposes an API for the AST, not for the CST. To provide language intelligence on the source code, both are required. Since we do not want to implement our own parser, we need to work with what we have to build the CST: the AST and a stream of tokens. The goal is to reverse-engineer the AST into the CST. This involves re-using the AST nodes as CST nodes, and figuring out what token belongs beneath what node. The exemplary statement <code>select '1';</code> should be be parsed into</p>
<div><p><code><br><div><p><span>_<!-- -->10</span></p><p><span>SelectStmt@0..11</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->10</span></p><p><span>    Select@0..6 "select"</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->10</span></p><p><span>    Whitespace@6..7 " "</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->10</span></p><p><span>    ResTarget@7..10</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->10</span></p><p><span>      AConst@7..10</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->10</span></p><p><span>        Sconst@7..10 "'1'"</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->10</span></p><p><span>    Ascii59@10..11 ";"</span></p></div><br></code></p></div>
<p>To do that, we need to know the range of every node that is within the AST.</p>
<p>We made <em>numerous</em> iterations over the past few months to figure out how to accomplish this with minimal manual implementations. Before diving into details, lets take a closer look at the <code>parse</code> API of <code>libpg_query</code>. For the exemplary statement above, it returns (simplified for readability):</p>
<div><p><code><br><div><p><span>_<!-- -->23</span></p><p><span>SelectStmt {</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->23</span></p><p><span>    target_list: [</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->23</span></p><p><span>	    ResTarget {</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->23</span></p><p><span>	        val: Some(</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->23</span></p><p><span>	            Node {</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->23</span></p><p><span>	                node: Some(</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->23</span></p><p><span>	                  AConst {</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->23</span></p><p><span>	                      location: 7,</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->23</span></p><p><span>	                      val: Some(</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->23</span></p><p><span>	                          Sval(</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->23</span></p><p><span>	                              String {</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->23</span></p><p><span>	                                  sval: "1",</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->23</span></p><p><span>	                              },</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->23</span></p><p><span>	                          ),</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->23</span></p><p><span>	                      ),</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->23</span></p><p><span>	                  },</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->23</span></p><p><span>	                ),</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->23</span></p><p><span>	            },</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->23</span></p><p><span>	        ),</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->23</span></p><p><span>	        location: 7,</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->23</span></p><p><span>	    },</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->23</span></p><p><span>    ],</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->23</span></p><p><span>}</span></p></div><br></code></p></div>
<p>There are a few limitations:</p>
<ol>
<li>Some nodes do have a <code>location</code> property that indicates where the node starts in the source, but not all.</li>
<li>There is no information on the range of a node within the source.</li>
<li>Some locations are not what you would expect. For example the location of the expression node is the location of the operator, not the start of the left expression.</li>
</ol>
<p>To summarise: <em>we need a range for each node, and we only have a start position, but not always, and sometimes it is wrong.</em></p>
<p>Our first very iterations were naive. We explored what information we could extract from <code>scan</code> and <code>parse</code>, and if anything can help in reverse-engineering the CST.</p>
<p>It turns out, the most reliable way of determining the range of a node is by knowing all <strong>properties</strong> of that node, and its position in the tree.</p>
<p>A property is any text for which a Token can potentially be found in the source code. For example, a <code>SelectStmt</code> node has the <code>select</code> keyword as a property, and if there is a <code>from_clause</code>, a <code>from</code> keyword. For the exemplary statement above, the properties are</p>
<div><p><code><br><div><p><span>_<!-- -->10</span></p><p><span>SelectStmt: [Select],</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->10</span></p><p><span>RangeVar: [],</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->10</span></p><p><span>AConst: ['1']</span></p></div><br></code></p></div>
<p>Note that we do not have an extra <code>String</code> node, and instead add its properties to the parent <code>AConst</code> node. This reason is that a <code>String</code> node does not bring any value to the CST, since we already know that <code>‘1'</code> is a string from the kind of the respective <code>Token</code>. The same is true for all nodes that just contain type information such as <code>Integer</code>, <code>Boolean</code> and <code>Float</code>.</p>
<p>The position of any node is the same in AST and CST, and thereby can be reflected from it.</p>
<h3 id="implementation">Implementation</h3>
<p>Before the actual parsing begins, the AST returned by <code>parse</code> is converted into an uniform tree structure where each node holds the kind of the node, a list of properties, the depth and, if available, the location.</p>
<p>For example, for <code>select '1';</code>:</p>
<div><p><code><br><div><p><span>_<!-- -->39</span></p><p><span>edges: (0, 1), (1, 2),</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->39</span></p><p><span>nodes: {</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->39</span></p><p><span>    0: Node {</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->39</span></p><p><span>        kind: SelectStmt,</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->39</span></p><p><span>        depth: 1,</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->39</span></p><p><span>        properties: [</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->39</span></p><p><span>            TokenProperty {</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->39</span></p><p><span>                value: None,</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->39</span></p><p><span>                kind: Some(</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->39</span></p><p><span>                    Select,</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->39</span></p><p><span>                ),</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->39</span></p><p><span>            },</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->39</span></p><p><span>        ],</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->39</span></p><p><span>        location: None,</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->39</span></p><p><span>    },</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->39</span></p><p><span>    1: Node {</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->39</span></p><p><span>        kind: ResTarget,</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->39</span></p><p><span>        depth: 2,</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->39</span></p><p><span>        properties: [],</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->39</span></p><p><span>        location: Some(</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->39</span></p><p><span>            7,</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->39</span></p><p><span>        ),</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->39</span></p><p><span>    },</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->39</span></p><p><span>    2: Node {</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->39</span></p><p><span>        kind: AConst,</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->39</span></p><p><span>        depth: 3,</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->39</span></p><p><span>        properties: [</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->39</span></p><p><span>            TokenProperty {</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->39</span></p><p><span>                value: Some(</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->39</span></p><p><span>                    "1",</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->39</span></p><p><span>                ),</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->39</span></p><p><span>                kind: None,</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->39</span></p><p><span>            },</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->39</span></p><p><span>        ],</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->39</span></p><p><span>        location: Some(</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->39</span></p><p><span>            7,</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->39</span></p><p><span>        ),</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->39</span></p><p><span>    },</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->39</span></p><p><span>},</span></p></div><br></code></p></div>
<p>To implement such a conversion we need a way to</p>
<ul>
<li>get an <code>Option&lt;usize&gt;</code> with the location for every node type, if any</li>
<li>compile a list of all properties that a node contains</li>
<li>walk down the AST until the leaves are reached</li>
</ul>
<p>Due to the strict type system of Rust, a manual implementation would be a significant and repetitive effort. With languages such as JavaScript, getting the location of a node would be as simple as <code>node?.location</code>. In Rust, a large match statement covering all possible nodes is required to do the same. Luckily, <code>libpg_query</code> exports a protobuf definition containing all AST nodes and their fields. For example, an <code>AExpr</code> node is defined as</p>
<div><p><code><br><div><p><span>_<!-- -->10</span></p><p><span>message A_Expr</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->10</span></p><p><span>{</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->10</span></p><p><span>  A_Expr_Kind kind = 1 [json_name="kind"];</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->10</span></p><p><span>  repeated Node name = 2 [json_name="name"];</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->10</span></p><p><span>  Node lexpr = 3 [json_name="lexpr"];</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->10</span></p><p><span>  Node rexpr = 4 [json_name="rexpr"];</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->10</span></p><p><span>  int32 location = 5 [json_name="location"];</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->10</span></p><p><span>}</span></p></div><br></code></p></div>
<p>We introspect that definition to generate code at build time using <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/procedural-macros.html">procedural macros</a>.</p>
<p>Leveraging the powerful repetition feature of the <code>[quote](https://github.com/dtolnay/quote)</code> crate, the <code>match</code> statement of a <code>get_location</code> function can be implemented with just a few lines of code.</p>
<div><p><code><br><div><p><span>_<!-- -->20</span></p><p><span>pub fn get_location_mod(_item: proc_macro2::TokenStream) -&gt; proc_macro2::TokenStream {</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->20</span></p><p><span>		// Parse the proto file using a custom parser</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->20</span></p><p><span>		let parser = ProtoParser::new("libpg_query/protobuf/pg_query.proto");</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->20</span></p><p><span>    let proto_file = parser.parse();</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->20</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->20</span></p><p><span>		// get all node identifiers for the left side of the match arm</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->20</span></p><p><span>		let node_identifiers = node_identifiers(&amp;proto_file.nodes);</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->20</span></p><p><span>		// get a TokenStream for each node that returns the location</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->20</span></p><p><span>		// if it is part of the node properties</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->20</span></p><p><span>    let location_idents = location_idents(&amp;proto_file.nodes);</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->20</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->20</span></p><p><span>    quote! {</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->20</span></p><p><span>        /// Returns the location of a node</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->20</span></p><p><span>        pub fn get_location(node: &amp;NodeEnum) -&gt; Option&lt;usize&gt; {</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->20</span></p><p><span>            match node {</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->20</span></p><p><span>                #(NodeEnum::#node_identifiers(n) =&gt; #location_idents),*</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->20</span></p><p><span>						}</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->20</span></p><p><span>        }</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->20</span></p><p><span>    }</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->20</span></p><p><span>}</span></p></div><br></code></p></div>
<p>The <code>location_idents</code> function iterates all nodes, searches for a <code>location</code> property in the protobuf definition for each node, and returns a <code>TokenStream</code> with either <code>Some(n.location)</code> or <code>None</code> for each.</p>
<div><p><code><br><div><p><span>_<!-- -->18</span></p><p><span>fn location_idents(nodes: &amp;[Node]) -&gt; Vec&lt;TokenStream&gt; {</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->18</span></p><p><span>    nodes</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->18</span></p><p><span>        .iter()</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->18</span></p><p><span>        .map(|node| {</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->18</span></p><p><span>            if node</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->18</span></p><p><span>                .fields</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->18</span></p><p><span>                .iter()</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->18</span></p><p><span>								// has location property?</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->18</span></p><p><span>                .find(|n| n.name == "location" &amp;&amp; n.field_type == FieldType::Int32)</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->18</span></p><p><span>                .is_some()</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->18</span></p><p><span>            {</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->18</span></p><p><span>                quote! { Some(n.location) }</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->18</span></p><p><span>            } else {</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->18</span></p><p><span>                quote! { None }</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->18</span></p><p><span>            }</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->18</span></p><p><span>        })</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->18</span></p><p><span>        .collect()</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->18</span></p><p><span>}</span></p></div><br></code></p></div>
<p>Similarly, we can generate code to recursively walk down the <code>FieldType == Node</code> and <code>FieldType == Vec&lt;Node&gt;</code> properties of the AST nodes. No manual work required.</p>
<p>Even the function that returns all properties for a node can be generated, at least partly. All AST fields of <code>FieldType == String</code> can always be added to the list of properties. In the example above, the <code>sval: “1”</code> of the <code>String</code> node makes up the properties of its parent, the <code>AConst</code> node. What is remaining are mostly just the keywords that need to be defined for every node. A <code>SelectStmt</code> node has the <code>select</code> keyword as a property, and if there is a <code>from_clause</code>, a <code>from</code> keyword.</p>
<div><p><code><br><div><p><span>_<!-- -->11</span></p><p><span>fn custom_handlers(node: &amp;Node) -&gt; TokenStream {</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->11</span></p><p><span>    match node.name.as_str() {</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->11</span></p><p><span>			"SelectStmt" =&gt; quote! {</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->11</span></p><p><span>			    tokens.push(TokenProperty::from(Token::Select));</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->11</span></p><p><span>			    if n.from_clause.len() &gt; 0 {</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->11</span></p><p><span>			        tokens.push(TokenProperty::from(Token::From));</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->11</span></p><p><span>			    }</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->11</span></p><p><span>					...</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->11</span></p><p><span>			},</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->11</span></p><p><span>		...</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->11</span></p><p><span>}</span></p></div><br></code></p></div>

<h3 id="parsing-a-statement">Parsing a Statement</h3>
<p>After the tree has been generated, the parser goes through the tokens and finds the node in whose properties the current token can be found. But not every node is a possible successor. Lets look how the parser builds the CST for the statement <code>select '1' from contact</code> at a high level.</p>
<p>We start with the full tree, and all tokens:</p>
<!-- -->
<div><p><code><br><div><p><span>_<!-- -->10</span></p><p><span>Remaining Tokens: ["select", "'1'", "from", "contact"]</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->10</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->10</span></p><p><span>Parse Tree:</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->10</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->10</span></p><p><span>  SelectStmt (0, [Select, From])</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->10</span></p><p><span>         /         \</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->10</span></p><p><span>1 (ResTarget, [])    2 (RangeVar, ['contact'])</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->10</span></p><p><span>        |             </span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->10</span></p><p><span> 3 (AConst, ['1'])</span></p></div><br></code></p></div>
<p>Starting with the root node, the parser first searches the current node for the token. In this case, with success. <code>Select</code> is removed from <code>SelectStmt</code> .</p>
<p>In the next iteration, we search for <code>'1'</code>. Since its not in the current node, a breadth-first search is used to find the property within children nodes. We arrive at <code>AConst</code> , open all nodes we encountered along the way, and advance.</p>
<!-- -->
<div><p><code><br><div><p><span>_<!-- -->17</span></p><p><span>Remaining Tokens: ["from", "contact"]</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->17</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->17</span></p><p><span>Parse Tree:</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->17</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->17</span></p><p><span>  SelectStmt (0, [From])</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->17</span></p><p><span>         /         \</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->17</span></p><p><span>1 (ResTarget, [])    2 (RangeVar, ['contact'])</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->17</span></p><p><span>        |             </span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->17</span></p><p><span> 3 (AConst, []) </span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->17</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->17</span></p><p><span>CST:</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->17</span></p><p><span>SelectStmt</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->17</span></p><p><span>    Select@0..6 "select"</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->17</span></p><p><span>    Whitespace@6..7 " "</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->17</span></p><p><span>    ResTarget@7..10</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->17</span></p><p><span>      AConst@7..10</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->17</span></p><p><span>        Sconst@7..10 "'1'"</span></p></div><br></code></p></div>
<p>Since we arrived at a leaf node with no properties left, the next token can not be part of this node or any child. It can be closed immediately after advancing the token. We remove it from the tree and set the current node to its parent. The same now applies to <code>ResTarget</code>, so we arrive back at <code>SelectStmt</code>:</p>
<!-- -->
<div><p><code><br><div><p><span>_<!-- -->15</span></p><p><span>Remaining Tokens: ["from", "contact"]</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->15</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->15</span></p><p><span>Parse Tree:</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->15</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->15</span></p><p><span>  SelectStmt (0, [From])</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->15</span></p><p><span>                   \</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->15</span></p><p><span>                     2 (RangeVar, ['contact'])</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->15</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->15</span></p><p><span>CST:</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->15</span></p><p><span>SelectStmt</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->15</span></p><p><span>    Select@0..6 "select"</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->15</span></p><p><span>    Whitespace@6..7 " "</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->15</span></p><p><span>    ResTarget@7..10</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->15</span></p><p><span>      AConst@7..10</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->15</span></p><p><span>        Sconst@7..10 "'1'"</span></p></div><br></code></p></div>
<p>The <code>from</code> token can once again be found within the current node and we just advance the parser. Since <code>SelectStmt</code> is not a leaf node, we stay where we are.</p>
<!-- -->
<div><p><code><br><div><p><span>_<!-- -->17</span></p><p><span>Remaining Tokens: ["contact"]</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->17</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->17</span></p><p><span>Parse Tree:</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->17</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->17</span></p><p><span>  SelectStmt (0, [])</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->17</span></p><p><span>                   \</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->17</span></p><p><span>                     2 (RangeVar, ['contact'])</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->17</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->17</span></p><p><span>CST:</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->17</span></p><p><span>SelectStmt</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->17</span></p><p><span>    Select@0..6 "select"</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->17</span></p><p><span>    Whitespace@6..7 " "</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->17</span></p><p><span>    ResTarget@7..10</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->17</span></p><p><span>      AConst@7..10</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->17</span></p><p><span>        Sconst@7..10 "'1'"</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->17</span></p><p><span>    Whitespace@10..11 " "</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->17</span></p><p><span>    From@11..15 "from"</span></p></div><br></code></p></div>
<p>From here, it repeats itself: <code>contact</code> is found within <code>RangeVar</code> using a breadth-first search. It becomes a leaf node that is closed after applying the token. Since no tokens are left, we finish parsing by closing <code>SelectStmt</code>, resulting in:</p>
<!-- -->
<div><p><code><br><div><p><span>_<!-- -->11</span></p><p><span>SelectStmt@0..23</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->11</span></p><p><span>    Select@0..6 "select"</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->11</span></p><p><span>    Whitespace@6..7 " "</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->11</span></p><p><span>    ResTarget@7..10</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->11</span></p><p><span>      AConst@7..10</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->11</span></p><p><span>        Sconst@7..10 "'1'"</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->11</span></p><p><span>    Whitespace@10..11 " "</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->11</span></p><p><span>    From@11..15 "from"</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->11</span></p><p><span>    Whitespace@15..16 " "</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->11</span></p><p><span>    RangeVar@16..23</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->11</span></p><p><span>      Ident@16..23 "contact"</span></p></div><br></code></p></div>
<p>Keep in mind, this illustration shows you only an overview of the process.If you are interested in the details, take a look at the source code <a href="https://github.com/supabase/postgres_lsp/blob/2bb50e7b0733bd4cf630aba453d5132d03dfc113/crates/parser/src/parse/libpg_query_node.rs">here</a>.</p>
<p>You may have noticed that neither <code>location</code> nor <code>depth</code> were mentioned. Both are only used to improve performance and safeguard. Among other things, branches with nodes behind the current position of the parser are skipped. Further, the parser panics when a node is opened and either its position or its depth does not match the current state of the parser. This means that the returned CST is guaranteed to be correct.</p>
<h3 id="limitations">Limitations</h3>
<p>If the SQL is invalid and <code>parse</code> returns an error, the returned CST is just a flat list of tokens. Consequently, the statement parser is not resilient. This is not great, but we have intentionally implemented it so that custom and resilient implementations can be added statement by statement later.</p>
<p>Ultimately, we want the <code>libpg_query</code>-based parser to just serve as a fallback. For now however, our goal is to provide a usable language server as fast as possible. And even if some intelligence features will only work on valid statements, we believe it is still better than what we have today: no intelligence at all.</p>
<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2>
<p>There are some minor improvements remaining for the parser. But the largest part are the manual implementations missing in <code>get_node_properties</code> . Its a time-consuming effort, and <strong><em>we would love to get help from the community</em></strong> here. Check out <a href="https://github.com/supabase/postgres_lsp/issues/51">this issue</a> if you like to support.</p>
<p>After that, we will move on to the semantic data model and the language server itself. Other parser features such as support for <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/plpgsql.html">PL/pgSQL</a> function body parsing will be added later. We want to get this project into a usable state as fast as possible.</p></div></article></div>]]></description>

<p>This is a niche, unique and professionally made app which is a one time purchase - I believe the reviewer hasn’t even read the documentation.</p>
<p>In light of this I searched for similar things and the store brings up apps with descriptions like “I made this for my son, do not take it seriously ($4.07 AUD)” and others that look like they’ve been thrown together as a school project or something.</p>
<p>I also note this exact same app is already available on the Apple App Store for the same price.</p>
<p>Do I need to have a back and forth with the reviewer, or perhaps Ron can look into this?<br>
Happy to have a discussion and send further details like a link to the app and documentation privately.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

              <p>Crazy, you should be able to price at the strategy you want,  the market will decide if it’s too high.</p>

            <p>Exactly, I’ve tried to resubmit with a lowered price and get “The binary in ‘Certification Failed’ cannot be registered. Please modify or delete the binary.”, so presumably would need to bump the version number and wait another 5 days or so just to get it through which makes no sense.  I’ve opened a support ticket with all the information they need including a link to the App Store where it’s live and listed for the exact same price, let’s see what happens.  What a headache.</p>

The only way the previous one was approved is if I set the price to $9.99.  The tor scam app is still up for around $300, even though Ron reported it over 5 days ago.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>We are happy to announce that the <a href="https://lists.archlinux.org/hyperkitty/list/arch-dev-public@lists.archlinux.org/thread/WYXDTJ3TR2DWRQCDZK44BQDH67IDVGTS/">migration of the bugtracker to GitLab</a> is done! 🥳 </p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who has helped during the migration!</p>
<p>This means the issue tracker and merge requests on the GitLab package repos are now enabled.</p>
<p>The old bugtracker will subsequently be closed down. For archiving reasons there will be a static copy so that links (for example the randomly picked <a href="https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/56716">Task #56716</a>) are still stable, migrated bugs have a closing comment pointing to the new URL on GitLab.</p>
<p>Packaging bugs are now opened on the repo hosting the corresponding packaging sources, the "Add a new Bug" button on the package page on archlinux.org will automatically direct you to the correct place to open the issue. The workflow afterwards is mostly the same, first our <a href="https://gitlab.archlinux.org/groups/archlinux/teams/bug-wranglers/-/group_members">Bug Wranglers</a> will have a look at the issues and triage them, and then they will be handed over to the respective <a href="https://gitlab.archlinux.org/archlinux/teams/package-maintainer-team">Package Maintainers</a> to fix. A list of all issues can be found <a href="https://gitlab.archlinux.org/groups/archlinux/packaging/-/issues">here</a>.</p>
<p>If you do not have an account for GitLab already (which authenticates against our <a href="https://accounts.archlinux.org/">SSO service</a>), please write us a mail with your desired username to accountsupport@archlinux.org as advised in the banner.</p></div></div>]]></description>

[this is an English translation of the <a href="https://zaufanatrzeciastrona.pl/post/o-trzech-takich-co-zhakowali-prawdziwy-pociag-a-nawet-30-pociagow/">original article in Polish</a>, we occasionally <a href="https://badcyber.com/several-polish-banks-hacked-information-stolen-by-unknown-attackers">publish</a> the best cyber <a href="https://badcyber.com/errors-threats-and-extortion-history-of-a-bank-hack-part-one">stories</a> from Poland in English]
</p>
<p>A train manufactured by a Polish company suddenly broke down during maintenance. The experts were helpless – the train was fine, it just wouldn’t run. In a desperate last gasp, the Dragon Sector team was called in to help, and its members found wonders the train engineers had never dreamed of.</p>
<p>In this story, we will take you on an unusual journey. A journey full of unexpected discoveries and events, a journey under pressure of time and money, as well as unusual technologies. A journey in which the train plays the most important role – although unfortunately it doesn’t move, even though it should. Fasten your seatbelts – or at least sit comfortably, because there are sharp turns ahead.</p>
<h3>Winning the tender, losing the service</h3>
<p>The story probably begins a little earlier, but we will enter the scene in spring 2022, when the maintenance for the first of eleven Impuls 45WE trains (made by Polish company Newag) operated by the Lower Silesian Railways ends. The maintenance is carried out by an independent train maintenance company called Serwis Pojazdów Szynowych, hereafter referred to as SPS, SPS won the tender to carry out the mandatory maintenance of the trains after a distance of 1,000,000 kilometres. The train manufacturer, Newag, also competed in the tender to carry out the maintenance, but the manufacturer’s bid was about 750k USD higher and the tender was eventually won by SPS, which offered to carry out the maintenance of 11 trains for around 5.5 mln USD.</p>
<p>Maintenance a train is a complicated affair – it has to be taken apart, the parts sent to the various manufacturers, checked, sent back, the train put back together again and tested. The SPS carries out the maintenance procedures according to the relevant maintenance manual (some 20,000 pages) provided by the manufacturer, but the train does not start after being put together. The computer says everything is fine, the train is ready to run – but it does not run. The inverters are not supplying voltage to the motors and no one has any idea why this is happening. Maintenance technicians search, check, verify, consult the manuals – they find no answer.</p>
<h3>Mysterious breakdowns</h3>
<p>The Lower Silesian Railway has eleven Impulses and, according to the schedule, another one is about to be sent for maintenance, while the first – instead of returning to work – is still sitting in the workshop. The second train is undergoing an identical maintenance, with identical results. Before the maintenance it was operating, after the maintenance it no longer wants to run. The work on getting the first train up and running, like the train itself, has not progressed one millimetre, while the manufacturer refuses to help. Two immobile trains are already sitting in the workshop. The third misses its inspection due to battery failure, so a fourth train (“from the future”) is sent to the maintenance instead. The maintenance company wants to take advantage of its presence to tow one of those that won’t run. When the fourth (running) train is connected to one of the stationary ones, the running one also comes to a standstill (the reason for this has not yet been established). In addition, at another workshop in another Polish town, Szczecin, another Impulse breaks down in very similar circumstances – it does not start up after servicing.</p>
<h3>Poland’s top hackers</h3>
<p>At a certain point, the problem becomes serious enough to be noticed by the media – the six longest trains of the Lower Silesian Railway out of service mean that timetables have to be reduced, replacement trains have to be sent to the tracks, and passengers travel in overcrowded,&nbsp; shorter trainsets. Newag explains that the trains were blocked by a “safety system” – but in the 20,000 pages of instructions, it is in vain to find even a mention of it. A day of train downtime in the workshop costs over 1000 USD in contractual penalties, and there are several trains stuck, so the tension level in the SPS is rising. Since neither the mechanics nor the electricians have a solution, someone types “Polish hackers” into Google and comes across an article about the Dragon Sector group’s successes in the CTF arena at the top of the results list. SPS makes contact with DS, whose representatives at first can’t believe the proposal they hear. Train hacking? Well, why not. The parties sign a contract. Dragon Sector members Michał “Redford” Kowalczyk and Sergiusz “q3k” Bazański, known for <a href="https://badcyber.com/two-guys-one-laptop/">hacking Toshiba laptops,</a> take on the project, and Kuba “PanKleszcz” Stępniewicz, who has experience in industrial automation, joins in. The team set off briskly to work, with Kuba taking a trip to the workshop. On site, they get a train that doesn’t move, two spare computers and the computer manufacturer’s SDK files. They start the work by tapping into the CAN bus, but it’s difficult to read the traffic without documentation of the protocols. They take a long time trying to dump the embedded software from the on-board computer. They have no documentation of the computer and the SDK only allows uploading new software, with no option to dump existing software. As they experiment with the older version of the software they found, uploading it to the first spare computer causes it to stop responding – they are left with only one working spare computer. Eventually, they find a debugging interface and download the device’s memory byte by byte.</p>
<p>The computer is based on the TriCore architecture, like many similar solutions in the automotive industry. Unfortunately, there is a lack of good disassemblers, so the researchers are improving Ghidra a bit and can finally look into the code. Admittedly, strings are missing, but the work is slowly moving forward. A month and a half goes by when the SPS passes on the bad news.</p>
<h3>As the deadline chases and trains break down</h3>
<p>The Lower Silesian Railway, unable to wait for its trains, decides to cooperate with Newag on the repair of broken trainsets and their maintenance, including trains which, according to the original tender, were yet to be sent for maintenance at SPS. The rupture of the contract with SPS is expected to take place in a week’s time. As is well known, nothing affects the intensity of the work as much as a very close deadline by which the result has to be shown, so the researchers set to work with redoubled energy. In the course of their work so far, they have downloaded the memory contents of a number of computers, both trains that are working and those that should only be working. Comparing these images is an ordeal, as almost every train has a different set of functions and a different version of software, but slowly they are starting to get a feel for something. They identify values in the computers’ memory that are set in one train and zeroed out in another. They can run tests at their desks – the computer, even when taken out of the train, lets it run for a while (before realising it’s missing the rest of the train) to show whether it’s ready to run the inverters.</p>
<p>There is less than a day left until the deadline for completion when they find the configuration of flags that gives the train a chance to run. Unfortunately, during the experiments, the last working on-board computer burns out. Yes, it burns – a capacitor burns (a rather random occurrence). After another brainstorm and many attempts to put the two damaged computers into one, they manage to repair the burnt one and at 2am, the night before doomsday, the researchers configure a computer to start the train. One of the researchers boards a train (of a different operator) to arrive with the presumably working computer at the workshop just before the representatives of the Lower Silesian Railway, who have announced a visit for 9:30 a.m. Unfortunately, the train on which the researcher travels to the maintenance company is late. Eventually, in the morning, the researcher with the computer arrives at the site, connects the pray-it-works-computer to the broken-down train, but the train does not start. Another brainstorm identifies one flag that was forgotten and at 8:42 the train manages to start. The Lower Silesian Railway delegation, seeing at 9:30 that the trains have a chance of getting back to life after all, does not break the contract with SPS.</p>

<h3>Why the train broke down</h3>
<p>Figuring out how to get the train to run wasn’t even half the battle – you still had to figure out why it broke down, and this is where the thrill ride begins.</p>
<p>Months of analysis and reverse engineering uncovered some extremely interesting conditions written into the software code of various trains supplied by Newag. After hundreds of hours spent on code dumped from dozens of trainsets, it was possible to identify some very interesting mechanisms causing sudden train sickness.</p>

<p>The numerical values 53.13845 and 17.99011 found in the computer code seemed familiar at first glance. It soon became apparent that these were GPS coordinates pointing to the vicinity of Bydgoszcz Główny Railway Station, specifically the PESA (another Polish train producer and maintenance center) site located next to it. Soon the coordinates of other maintenance centers that could carry out train repairs and maintenance in Poland were also found. Below we show the pseudo-code of the algorithm (the names of the variables or functions are given by the researchers for clarity – we do not know what the original names were):</p>
<pre><code>check1 = 53.13845 &lt; lat &amp;&amp; lat &lt; 53.13882 &amp;&amp; 17.99011 &lt; long &amp;&amp; long &lt; 17.99837; 
check2 = 53.14453 &lt; lat &amp;&amp; lat &lt; 53.14828 &amp;&amp; 18.00428 &lt; long &amp;&amp; long &lt; 18.00555; 
check3 = 52.17048 &lt; lat &amp;&amp; lat &lt; 52.17736 &amp;&amp; 21.53480 &lt; long &amp;&amp; long &lt; 21.54437; 
check4 = 49.60336 &lt; lat &amp;&amp; lat &lt; 49.60686 &amp;&amp; 20.70073 &lt; long &amp;&amp; long &lt; 20.70840 
        &amp;&amp; (this-&gt;lock_function_test &amp; 1); 
check5 = 53.10244 &lt; lat &amp;&amp; lat &lt; 53.10406 &amp;&amp; 18.07817 &lt; long &amp;&amp; long &lt; 18.08243; 
check6 = 50.12608 &lt; lat &amp;&amp; lat &lt; 50.12830 &amp;&amp; 19.38411 &lt; long &amp;&amp; long &lt; 19.38872; 
check7 = 52.77292 &lt; lat &amp;&amp; lat &lt; 52.77551 &amp;&amp; 18.22117 &lt; long &amp;&amp; long &lt; 18.22724;</code></pre>
<p>Coordinate pairs define the workshop areas. A condition has been written in the computer code to disable the ability to run a train if it spends at least 10 days in one of these workshops. One of the workshops belongs to Newag itself – but a different logical condition was defined for its coordinates, presumably for testing purposes.</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" width="946" height="476" src="https://badcyber.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image.png" data-src="https://badcyber.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image.png" alt="" data-srcset="https://badcyber.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image.png 946w, https://badcyber.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image-300x151.png 300w, https://badcyber.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image-768x386.png 768w" data-sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" srcset="https://badcyber.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image.png 946w, https://badcyber.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image-300x151.png 300w, https://badcyber.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image-768x386.png 768w"></figure>
<p>Other surprises were soon discovered. Among them was the blocking of a train when one of its components is replaced (verified by its serial number). An option to undo the lockout was also discovered – this did not require setting flags at computer memory level, just the right sequence of button clicks in the cab and on the on-board computer screen. When news of the successful launch of the Impulse hit the media, the trains received a software update that removed this ‘fix’ option. On another train, a code was found instructing it to ‘break down’ after a million kilometres.</p>
<h3>Checking the date is hard</h3>
<p>A rather funny situation was encountered on another train that refused to work on November 21, 2022, even though it was not in maintenance at the time. The computer reported that the compressor had failed, although the mechanics said that everything was fine with the compressor. Unfortunately, the train still did not raise the pantographs. Analysis of the computer code detected a condition forcing the failure, which sounded like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>if the day is greater than or equal to 21 and</li>
<li>if the month is greater than or equal to 11 and</li>
<li>if the year is greater than or equal to 2021</li>
</ul>
<p>then report a compressor failure. The situation was funny because the train had been scheduled for servicing in November 2021 (the year before the breakdown), but the condition did not work then by coincidence. The train went into maintenance a while earlier, and was not put back into service until January 2022 – and the sophisticated logic condition described above no longer met this date. Presumably, it was the software developer’s lack of skill in constructing IFs that made it necessary to wait until November 21, 2022 for the scheduled failure.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Hardware surprise</h3>
<p>Surprises lurked not only in the software of the computers. In one train set, researchers discovered a device signed as a “UDP&lt;-&gt;CAN converter”, presumably enabling remote communication with the train. Removing it did not make anything stop working. Analysis showed that the on-board computer was sending lock status information to this device, and that the device itself was connected to a GSM modem.</p>
<h3>Not only in Wrocław</h3>
<p>Information that the SPS maintenance center succeeded in repairing Newag’s ‘broken’ trainsets quickly found its way to other companies as well. It turned out to be quite a common problem. In Wrocław they analysed 13 Impulses, but there were also broken ones running in Kolej Mazowieckie (one), two in Opole, four in Krakow, one in Zielona Góra, four in Szczecin and one in Warsaw. Fortunately, each was able to be repaired using a tool developed by our researchers that removes software locks from the on-board computer. In total, the researchers analysed the software of 29 trains and in all but five they found surprises beyond the official operating instructions.</p>
<h3>What’s next</h3>
<p>We leave it to the readers and customers of this company to assess the solutions used by the manufacturer. Interestingly, although there is litigation in the case, it is hard to find an institution in Poland that has done anything beyond kindly expressing interest in the matter. We are not aware of any action taken either by the Office of Consumer and Competition Protection or by the Railway Transport Office, which would seem to be competent to eliminate from the market practices that are damaging to local government organisations that are incurring considerable losses and to passengers who are forced to travel in crowds or use substitute transport for months. The only institution that has taken action that we are aware of is CERT Polska, notified of the discovery by the researchers. From the comment we received, it appears that CERT Polska has notified the “relevant authorities” and the case is being handled by law enforcement agencies.</p>
<p>We congratulate the best Polish hackers on their interesting discovery and professional execution of the assignment. Remember, nothing motivates you like a deadline tomorrow morning.</p>

          <h3>Abstract</h3>
              <!-- <br><br> -->
          <p> Creating high-fidelity 3D head avatars has always been a research hotspot, but there remains a great challenge under lightweight sparse view setups.
            In this paper, we propose Gaussian Head Avatar represented by controllable 3D Gaussians for high-fidelity head avatar modeling.
            We optimize the neutral 3D Gaussians and a fully learned MLP-based deformation field to capture complex expressions. 
            The two parts benefit each other, thereby our method can model fine-grained dynamic details while ensuring expression accuracy. 
            Furthermore, we devise a well-designed geometry-guided initialization strategy based on implicit SDF and Deep Marching Tetrahedra for the stability and convergence of the training procedure.
            Experiments show our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art sparse-view methods, achieving ultra high-fidelity rendering quality at 2K resolution even under exaggerated expressions.
            </p>
