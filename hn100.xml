</blockquote>
<p><span>Google is adding code to Chrome that will send tamper-proof information about your operating system and other software, and share it with websites. Google says this will reduce ad fraud. In practice, it reduces your control over your own computer, and is likely to mean that some websites will block access for everyone who's not using an "approved" operating system and browser. It also raises the barrier to entry for new browsers, something Google employees acknowledged in an unofficial explainer for the new feature, </span><a href="https://github.com/RupertBenWiser/Web-Environment-Integrity/blob/main/explainer.md"><span>Web Environment Integrity (WEI)</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>If you’re scratching your head at this point, we don’t blame you. This is pretty abstract! We’ll unpack it a little below - and then we’ll explain why this is a </span><i><span>bad idea</span></i><span> that Google </span><i><span>should not pursue</span></i><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>But first…</span></p>
<h2><span>Some background</span></h2>
<p><span>When your web browser connects to a web server, it automatically sends a description of your device and browser, something like, "This session is coming from a Google Pixel 4, using Chrome version 116.0.5845.61." The server on the other end of that connection can request even more detailed information, like a list of which fonts are installed on your device, how big its screen is, and more.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This can be good. The web server that receives this information can tailor its offerings to you. That server can make sure it only sends you file formats your device understands, at a resolution that makes sense for your screen, laid out in a way that works well for you.</span></p>
<p><span>But there are also downsides to this. Many sites use "</span><a href="https://coveryourtracks.eff.org/"><span>browser fingerprinting</span></a><span>" - a kind of tracking that relies on your browser's unique combination of characteristics - to nonconsensually identify users who reject cookies and other forms of surveillance. Some sites make inferences about you from your browser and device in order to determine whether they can charge you more, or serve you </span><a href="https://qz.com/1733345/the-fight-against-discriminatory-financial-ads-on-facebook"><span>bad or deceptive offers</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thankfully, the information your browser sends to websites about itself and your device is strictly voluntary. Your browser </span><i><span>can</span></i><span> send accurate information about you, but it doesn't have to. There are lots of plug-ins, privacy tools and esoteric preferences that you can use to send information of your choosing to sites that you don't trust.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>These tools don't just let you refuse to describe your computer to nosy servers across the internet. After all, a service that has so little regard for you that it would use your configuration data to inflict harms on you might very well refuse to serve you at all, as a means of coercing you into giving up the details of your device and software.</span></p>
<p><span>Instead, privacy and anti-tracking tools send </span><a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Firefox/Privacy"><span>plausible, </span><i><span>wrong</span></i><span> information about your device</span></a><span>. That way, services can't discriminate against you for choosing your own integrity over their business models.</span></p>
<p><span>That's where </span><i><span>remote attestation</span></i><span> comes in.</span></p>
<h2><span>Secure computing and remote attestation</span></h2>
<p><span>Most modern computers, tablets and phones ship from the factory with some kind of "secure computing" capability.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Secure computing is designed to be a system for monitoring your computer that you can't modify, or reconfigure. Originally, secure computing relied on a second processor - a "Technical Protection Module" or TPM - to monitor the parts of your computer you directly interact with. These days, many devices use a "secure enclave" - a hardened subsystem that is carefully designed to ensure that it can only be changed with the manufacturer’s permission..</span></p>
<p><span>These security systems have lots of uses. When you start your device, they can watch the boot-up process and check each phase of it to ensure that you're running the manufacturer's unaltered code, and not a version that's been poisoned by malicious software. That's great if you </span><i><span>want</span></i><span> to run the manufacturer's code, but the same process can be used to stop you from </span><i><span>intentionally</span></i><span> running different code, say, a free/open source operating system, or a version of the manufacturer's software that has been altered to disable undesirable features (like surveillance) and/or enable desirable ones (like the ability to install software from outside the manufacturer's app store).</span></p>
<p><span>Beyond controlling the code that runs on your device, these security systems can also provide information about your hardware and software to other people over the internet. Secure enclaves and TPMs ship with cryptographic "signing keys." They can gather information about your computer - its operating system version, extensions, software, and low-level code like bootloaders - and cryptographically sign all that information in an "</span><b>attestation</b><span>."</span></p>
<p><span>These attestations change the balance of power when it comes to networked communications. When a remote server wants to know what kind of device you're running and how it's configured, that server no longer has to take your word for it. It can require an attestation.</span></p>
<p><span>Assuming you haven't figured out how to bypass the security built into your device's secure enclave or TPM, that attestation is a highly reliable indicator of how your gadget is set up.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What's more, altering your device's TPM or secure enclave is a legally fraught business. Laws like </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/12/dc-circuit-evades-important-questions-disappointing-ruling-section-1201-dmca"><span>Section 1201 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act</span></a><span> as well as patents and copyrights create serious civil and criminal jeopardy for technologists who investigate these technologies. That danger gets substantially worse when the technologist publishes findings about how to disable or bypass these secure features. And if a technologist dares to distribute tools to effect that bypass, they need to reckon with serious criminal and civil legal risks, including multi-year prison sentences.</span></p>
<h2><span>WEI? No way!</span></h2>
<p><span>This is where the Google proposal comes in. WEI is a technical proposal to let servers request remote attestations from devices, with those requests being relayed to the device's secure enclave or TPM, which will respond with a cryptographically signed, highly reliable description of your device. You can choose not to send this to the remote server, but you lose the ability to send an </span><i><span>altered</span></i><span> or </span><i><span>randomized</span></i><span> description of your device and its software if you think that's best for you.</span></p>
<p><span>In their proposal, </span><a href="https://github.com/RupertBenWiser/Web-Environment-Integrity/blob/main/explainer.md"><span>the Google engineers claim several benefits of such a scheme</span></a><span>. But, despite their valiant attempts to cast these benefits as accruing to device owners, these are really designed to benefit the owners of commercial services; the benefit to users comes from the assumption that commercial operators will use the additional profits from remote attestation to make their services better for their users.</span></p>
<p><span>For example, the authors say that remote attestations will allow site operators to distinguish between real internet users who are manually operating a browser, and bots who are autopiloting their way through the service. This is said to be a way of reducing ad-fraud, which will increase revenues to publishers, who may plow those additional profits into producing better content.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>They also claim that attestation can foil “machine-in-the-middle” attacks, where a user is presented with a fake website into which they enter their login information, including one-time passwords generated by a two-factor authentication (2FA) system, which the attacker automatically enters into the </span><i><span>real</span></i><span> service’s login screen.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>They claim that gamers could use remote attestation to make sure the other gamers they’re playing against are running unmodified versions of the game, and not running cheats that give them an advantage over their competitors.</span></p>
<p><span>They claim that giving website operators the power to detect and block browser automation tools will let them block fraud, such as posting&nbsp; fake reviews or mass-creating bot accounts.</span></p>
<p><span>There’s arguably some truth to all of these claims. That’s not unusual: in matters of security, there’s often ways in which indiscriminate invasions of privacy and compromises of individual autonomy would blunt some real problems.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Putting handcuffs on every shopper who enters a store would doubtless reduce shoplifting, and stores with less shoplifting might lower their prices, benefitting all of their customers. But ultimately, shoplifting is the </span><i><span>store’s</span></i><span> problem, not the shoppers’, and it’s not fair for the store to make everyone else bear the cost of resolving its difficulties.</span></p>
<h2><span>WEI helps websites block disfavored browsers</span></h2>
<p><span>One </span><a href="https://github.com/RupertBenWiser/Web-Environment-Integrity/blob/7998217b3d7334a71c26c52aeeadc1c6b1ba1dc4/explainer.md#how-will-we-prevent-this-signal-from-being-used-to-exclude-vendors"><span>section of Google’s document</span></a><span> acknowledges that websites will use WEI to lock out browsers and operating systems that they dislike, or that fail to implement WEI to the website’s satisfaction. Google tentatively suggests (“we are evaluating”) a workaround: even once Chrome implements the new technology, it would refuse to send WEI information from a “small percentage” of computers that would otherwise send it. In theory, any website that refuses visits from non-WEI browsers would wind up also blocking this “small percentage” of Chrome users, who would complain so vociferously that the website would have to roll back their decision and allow everyone in, WEI or not.</span></p>
<p><span>The problem is, there are lots of websites that would </span><i><span>really, really</span></i><span> like the power to dictate what browser and operating system people can use. Think “</span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/4/16805216/google-chrome-only-sites-internet-explorer-6-web-standards"><span>this website works best in Internet Explorer 6.0 on Windows XP</span></a><span>.” Many websites will consider that “small percentage” of users an acceptable price to pay, or simply instruct users to reset their browser data until a roll of the dice enables WEI for that site.</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>Also, Google has a conflict of interest in choosing the “small percentage.” Setting it very small would benefit Google’s ad fraud department by authenticating more ad clicks, allowing Google to sell those ads at a higher price. Setting it high makes it harder for websites to implement exclusionary behavior, but doesn’t directly benefit Google at all. It only makes it easier to build competing browsers. So even if Google chooses to implement this workaround, their incentives are to configure it as too small to protect the open web.</span></p>
<h2><span>You are the boss of your computer</span></h2>
<p><span>Your computer belongs to </span><i><span>you</span></i><span>. You are the boss of it. It should do what you tell it to.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We live in a </span><i><span>wildly</span></i><span> imperfect world. Laws that prevent you from reverse-engineering and reconfiguring your computer are bad enough, but when you combine that with a monopolized internet of</span> <span>“</span><a href="https://twitter.com/tveastman/status/1069674780826071040"><span>five giant websites filled with screenshots of text from the other four</span></a><span>,” things can get really bad.</span></p>
<p><span>A handful of companies have established chokepoints between buyers and sellers, performers and audiences, workers and employers, as well as families and communities. When those companies refuse to deal with you, your digital life grinds to a halt.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The web is the last major open platform left on the internet - the last platform where anyone can make a browser or a website and participate, without having to ask permission or meet someone else’s specifications.</span></p>
<p><span>You are the boss of your computer. If a website sets up a virtual checkpoint that says, “only approved technology beyond this point,” you should have the right to tell it, “I’m no piece of string, I’m a frayed knot.” That is, you should be able to tell a site what it wants to hear, even if the site would refuse to serve you if it knew the truth about you.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To their credit, the proposers of WEI state that they would like for WEI to be used solely for benign purposes. They explicitly decry the use of WEI to block browsers, or to exclude users for wanting to keep their private info private.</span></p>
<p><span>But computer scientists don't get to decide how a technology gets used. Adding attestation to the web carries the completely foreseeable risk that companies </span><i><span>will</span></i><span> use it to attack users' right to configure their devices to suit their needs, even when that conflicts with tech companies' commercial priorities.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>WEI shouldn't be made. If it's made, it shouldn't be used.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span>So what?</span></h2>
<p><span>So what should we do about WEI and other remote attestation technologies?</span></p>
<p><span>Let's start with what we </span><i><span>shouldn't</span></i><span> do. We shouldn't ban remote attestation. </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/04/remembering-case-established-code-speech"><span>Code is speech</span></a><span> and everyone should be free to study, understand, and produce remote attestation tools.</span></p>
<p><span>These tools might have a place within distributed systems - for example, voting machine vendors might use remote attestation to verify the configuration of their devices in the field. Or at-risk human rights workers might send remote attestations to trusted technologists to help determine whether their devices have been compromised by state-sponsored malware.</span></p>
<p><span>But these tools should not be added to the web. Remote attestations have no place on open platforms. You are the boss of your computer, and you should have the final say over what it tells other people about your computer and its software.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Companies' problems are not as important as their users' autonomy</span></p>
<p><span>We sympathize with businesses whose revenues might be impacted by ad-fraud, game companies that struggle with cheaters, and services that struggle with bots. But addressing these problems can’t come before&nbsp; the right of technology users to choose how their computers work, or what those computers tell others about them, because the right to control one’s own devices is a building block of all civil rights in the digital world..&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>An open web delivers more benefit than harm. Letting giant, monopolistic corporations overrule our choices about which technology we want to use, and how we want to use it, is a recipe for solving those </span><i><span>companies'</span></i><span> problems, but not their users'.</span></p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">FAQ</h2>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Why Candle?</h3>
<p dir="auto">Candle stems from the need to reduce binary size in order to <em>enable serverless</em>
possible by making the whole engine smaller than PyTorch very large library volume.
This enables creating runtimes on a cluster much faster.</p>
<p dir="auto">And simply <em>removing Python</em> from production workloads.
Python can really add overhead in more complex workflows and the <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/blog/the-python-gil-past-present-and-future/" rel="nofollow">GIL</a> is a notorious source of headaches.</p>
<p dir="auto">Rust is cool, and a lot of the HF ecosystem already has Rust crates <a href="https://github.com/huggingface/safetensors">safetensors</a> and <a href="https://github.com/huggingface/tokenizers">tokenizers</a>.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Other ML frameworks</h3>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://github.com/coreylowman/dfdx">dfdx</a> is a formidable crate, with shapes being included
in types preventing a lot of headaches by getting compiler to complain about shape mismatch right off the bat
However we found that some features still require nightly and writing code can be a bit dauting for non rust experts.</p>
<p dir="auto">We're leveraging and contributing to other core crates for the runtime so hopefully both crates can benefit from each
other</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://github.com/burn-rs/burn">burn</a> is a general crate that can leverage multiple backends so you can choose the best
engine for your workload</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://github.com/LaurentMazare/tch-rs.git">tch-rs</a> Bindings to the torch library in Rust. Extremely versatile, but they
do bring in the entire torch library into the runtime. The main contributor of <code>tch-rs</code> is also involved in the development
of <code>candle</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Missing symbols when compiling with the mkl feature.</h3>
<p dir="auto">If you get some missing symbols when compiling binaries/tests using the mkl
features, e.g.:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="  = note: /usr/bin/ld: (....o): in function `blas::sgemm':
          .../blas-0.22.0/src/lib.rs:1944: undefined reference to `sgemm_' collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status

  = note: some `extern` functions couldn't be found; some native libraries may need to be installed or have their path specified
  = note: use the `-l` flag to specify native libraries to link
  = note: use the `cargo:rustc-link-lib` directive to specify the native libraries to link with Cargo (see https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/build-scripts.html#cargorustc-link-libkindname)"><pre><code>  = note: /usr/bin/ld: (....o): in function `blas::sgemm':
          .../blas-0.22.0/src/lib.rs:1944: undefined reference to `sgemm_' collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status

  = note: some `extern` functions couldn't be found; some native libraries may need to be installed or have their path specified

  = note: use the `cargo:rustc-link-lib` directive to specify the native libraries to link with Cargo (see https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/build-scripts.html#cargorustc-link-libkindname)
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">This is likely due to some missing linker flag that enable the mkl library. You
can try adding the following at the top of your binary:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="extern crate intel_mkl_src;"><pre><code>extern crate intel_mkl_src;
</code></pre></div>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How to know where an error comes from.</h3>
<p dir="auto">You can set <code>RUST_BACKTRACE=1</code> to be provided with backtraces when a candle
error is generated.</p>

<p>Computing as we know it today was built in no small part by individuals who have written open source software—often for little to no personal financial gain—as well as by developers who use those tools. Few tools like that are as legendary and impactful as the <a href="https://www.vim.org/download.php">Vim</a> open source code editor, the first version of which was written and released by Dutch engineer Bram Moolenaar in 1991.</p>
<p>According to a note published by his family to Google Groups this week, Moolenaar passed away on August 3 at the age of 62. The post did not share his cause of death, stating only that he had been suffering from a medical condition for a few weeks. They <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/vim_announce/c/tWahca9zkt4?utm_source=thenewstack&amp;utm_medium=website&amp;utm_content=inline-mention&amp;utm_campaign=platform&amp;pli=1">wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is with a heavy heart that we have to inform you that Bram Moolenaar passed away on 3 August 2023.<br>
Bram was suffering from a medical condition that progressed quickly over the last few weeks.</p>
<p>Bram dedicated a large part of his life to VIM and he was very proud of the VIM community that you are all part of.</p></blockquote>
<p>The note goes on to say that they are arranging a Dutch-language funeral service in the Netherlands for Moolenaar, but that a date has not yet been set.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>Moolenaar's text editor is legendary among software developers; it has repeatedly been named in surveys as one of the most widely used text editors or IDEs, and it is the default editor for some Linux distros. It was built initially as a clone for vi, a beloved Unix text editor. Moolenaar built Vim partly on another vi clone called Stevie, which is no longer supported.
</p><p>With the license of Vim, Moolenaar was an early pioneer of the charityware model; he invited users who appreciated the work to donate to support children in Uganda in lieu of sending a direct donation to himself. According to <a href="https://thenextweb.com/news/dev-world-mourns-loss-of-vim-creator-bram-moolenaar">The Next Web</a>, donations to the charity amounted to about 30,000 euros annually—"enough to help about 50 children finish their education, from primary school to university."</p>
<p>Moolenaar continued to update Vim until just a few weeks ago. He has worked on many other notable projects in his career. His most recent gig was working for Google to improve the <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en_in/retail/solutions/merchant-center/?ref=news.itsfoss.com">Merchant Center</a>.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Image Credit: Getty Images</p></div><p><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Amazon hired at least two union-busting consulting firms specifically to prevent its drivers from joining the International Brotherhood of Teamsters over the course of 2022, according to six reports filed to the Department of Labor and obtained by Motherboard. This is notable because Amazon <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/pkaa4m/amazon-drivers-are-actually-just-drivers-delivering-for-amazon-amazon-says"><span>claims that the drivers who deliver its packages are not its employees</span></a>.&nbsp;</p></span><span></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Motherboard reviewed five reports filed to the Department of Labor, which showed that Amazon spent more than $14.2 million total on anti-union consulting in 2022. Of that, $160,595 went to <a href="https://olmsapps.dol.gov/query/orgReport.do?rptId=860914&amp;rptForm=LM20Form" target="_blank"><span>Optimal Employee Relations</span></a> and <a href="https://olmsapps.dol.gov/query/orgReport.do?rptId=861774&amp;rptForm=LM20Form" target="_blank"><span>Action Resources</span></a>, who, on their own reports, specifically referred to “drivers” as the target group of their persuasion. Amazon and the contractors it hired <a href="https://www.laborlab.us/lm20scorecard#:~:text=Under%20current%20Federal%20law%2C%20anti,or%20arrangement%20with%20an%20employer." target="_blank"><span>are required to file these reports</span></a> with the government each year.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Amazon’s <a href="https://olmsapps.dol.gov/query/orgReport.do?rptId=865472&amp;rptForm=LM10Form" target="_blank"><span>filing</span></a> references nine contractors hired throughout 2022. Both Optimal Employee Relations and Action Resources say that one of the people “through whom activities were performed” was Fernando Rivera, who filed a <a href="https://olmsapps.dol.gov/query/orgReport.do?rptId=869923&amp;rptForm=LM20Form" target="_blank"><span>report of their own</span></a>. Rivera’s report again identifies “drivers” as the target group. It also cites “teamsters” as the union in question.&nbsp;</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>A third contractor referenced in Amazon’s filing, <a href="https://olmsapps.dol.gov/query/orgReport.do?rptId=854741&amp;rptForm=LM" target="_blank"><span>Government Resources Consultants of America</span></a>, said that it had been hired to persuade “various employees across the U.S. as may be requested from time to time,” and did not specify a union. However, the filing refers to another consulting group, known as D&amp;G Consulting, whose <a href="https://olmsapps.dol.gov/query/orgReport.do?rptId=867525&amp;rptForm=LM20Form" target="_blank"><span>report filed in May</span></a> names “Amazon DSP Drivers” as the target group, and “Teamsters” as the union.&nbsp;</p></span><span></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>These filings are particularly notable because they show, specifically, that Amazon is trying to squash unions among the delivery drivers <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/pkaa4m/amazon-drivers-are-actually-just-drivers-delivering-for-amazon-amazon-says"><span>that it repeatedly stresses</span></a> are employees of third-party companies, not Amazon itself. The Teamsters <a href="https://teamster.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/5323ULPChargeAgainstAmazon.pdf" target="_blank"><span>have argued</span></a> that Amazon is in fact a joint employer of the drivers, and is using its contractor status as a way to evade responsibility.&nbsp;</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>“Amazon has a level of responsibility that they’re trying to escape here,” said Randy Korgan, the director of the Teamsters’ Amazon Division, whose goal is to organize the company. “If the subcontractor is its own entity, and the subcontractor employs these drivers, then what is their interest in making sure that there are anti-union consultants meeting with drivers for a company that they don’t have any control over?”&nbsp;</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>“It clearly identifies the amount of control that Amazon is exerting over these subcontractors, number one,” he continued. “Number two, it shows that they have a vested interest because [the drivers] are employees of some sort. When you look at these filings, how can you say they’re not your drivers?”</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>“They just proved they’re an employer,” said Seth Goldstein, a lawyer at Julien, Mirer, Singla and Goldstein, who has represented Amazon warehouse workers unionizing with the Amazon Labor Union. “Why would they be involved in this, if they’re fearing that the [National Labor Relations] Board would rule that they’re a joint employer?”&nbsp;</p></span><span></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>The reports do not reference specific Amazon locations. However, this past April, a group of drivers at an Amazon Delivery Service Partner (DSP) in Palmdale, California became the first in the company’s vast network of contractors to unionize when they <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/g5ygaw/a-group-of-amazon-drivers-just-joined-one-of-the-biggest-unions-in-the-us"><span>joined the Teamsters</span></a>, who comprise one of the biggest unions in the industry. The <a href="https://teamster.org/2023/04/amazon-drivers-ratify-teamster-contract/" target="_blank"><span>contract ratification</span></a> marked the first time the Teamsters had successfully organized an Amazon-related facility, and the DSP owner voluntarily recognized the union almost immediately.&nbsp;</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>The problem was, however, that Amazon did not. Because Amazon contracts third-party companies to deliver packages out of its warehouses, it said that the drivers legally only counted as employees of the DSP, called Battle-Tested Strategies (BTS), and were subcontractors to Amazon. For that reason, Amazon <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/v7bdwy/amazon-delivery-drivers-unionized-now-they-have-to-prove-they-work-for-amazon"><span>declined to bargain with the Teamsters</span></a>.&nbsp;</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>None of the filings reviewed by Motherboard specifically mention Palmdale, Battle-Tested Strategies, or the delivery station, DAX8.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Amazon spokesperson Eileen Hards told Motherboard that the filings were “unrelated to Battle-Tested Strategies in Palmdale,” and that BTS had been terminated “because of the company’s track record of failing to perform.” She referenced six breaches of contract, five of which were in January. These included grounding policy violations—which refers to how and when a vehicle is taken off the road due to some safety hazard—and a vehicle safety inspection violation. Motherboard has previously reported on <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/v7bdwy/amazon-delivery-drivers-unionized-now-they-have-to-prove-they-work-for-amazon#:~:text=Jonathon%20Ervin%2C%20the,on%20a%20repair.%E2%80%9D"><span>Amazon's van maintenance system</span></a>.&nbsp;</p></span><span></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>When the unionization was first announced on April 24, Amazon said that it had terminated BTS’s contract, not because the workers were unionizing, but because of “poor performance.”</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Hards <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/g5ygaw/a-group-of-amazon-drivers-just-joined-one-of-the-biggest-unions-in-the-us"><span>told Motherboard in a statement</span></a> at the time, “This group does not work for Amazon. This particular third party company had a track record of failing to perform and had been notified of its termination for poor performance well before today’s announcement. This situation is more about an outside company trying to distract from their history of failing to meet their obligations.”&nbsp;</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>The filings specifically referencing drivers say that consulting activity occurred between May and September of 2022. The timeline of the Palmdale unionization process is not clear, but Heath Lopez, one of the unionized drivers, previously told Motherboard that workers had started a petition in 2021 for better working conditions, which had served as a precursor to official organizing.&nbsp;</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>“Almost immediately upon the workers exercising their right to protected concerted activities, Amazon had anti-union consultants on the ground,” Korgan said. “This is Amazon's M.O. A little bit of concerted activity goes on, Amazon sends anti-union consultants that are trying to talk to drivers and discourage workers.”&nbsp;</p></span><span></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Jesse Moreno, another unionized driver, said that after the union went public, he started seeing new faces around the warehouse.&nbsp;</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>“Once we unionized, there was this influx of people we’d never seen,” Moreno said. “Probably around 10 people.”&nbsp;</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>He continued that one day after the unionization was announced, an unfamiliar man called a meeting with the drivers, and said that the Teamsters were spreading a false narrative, and that Amazon’s contract with BTS had been terminated and would expire in 60 days. During those 60 days, Amazon started grounding more vehicles, he said.&nbsp;</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>“We were being grounded two, three-plus vehicles a day, which was affecting our routes,” Moreno said. “If we don't have vehicles to drive, then we don't have vehicles to deliver these packages, so we don't have our routes and they'll essentially have to send us home. So people were getting cut because of this.”&nbsp;</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>“The maintenance that they had on these vehicles is just terrible. Our dashboards would look like a Christmas tree, which they didn't care about before,” Moreno continued. “But once we unionized, if any light was on there—they were grounding our vehicles for just about anything. The fire extinguisher not being on the door, the seatbelt not retracting properly.”</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>When asked whether Amazon can interfere with the drivers’ efforts if it says it does not employ them, Goldstein said, “They can interfere—if they’re an employer. They’re screwed. You can’t do that. That’s hilarious.” </p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>This is not the first time Amazon has called anti-union consultants to influence an organizing effort at one of its facilities. Last October, when warehouse workers at the company’s ALB1 Albany warehouse tried to join the Amazon Labor Union, Motherboard reported on <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3p5pb/amazons-dollar3200-per-day-union-busters-say-this-is-the-best-spot-for-steak-and-caviar-in-albany"><span>anti-union consultants</span></a> sent in to hold captive audience meetings and distribute fliers. When the votes were counted, <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/7k8dv4/alb1-workers-will-not-join-the-amazon-labor-union"><span>ALB1 lost its union election</span></a> almost by a factor of 2-to-1. Those consultants were paid at least $3,200 per day.</p></span></p><div><p><h3>ORIGINAL REPORTING ON EVERYTHING THAT MATTERS IN YOUR INBOX.</h3></p><p>By signing up, you agree to the<!-- --> <a href="https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/privacy-policy/en_us/page/terms-of-use.html">Terms of Use</a> <!-- -->and<!-- --> <a href="https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/privacy-policy/en_us/page/privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a> <!-- -->&amp; to receive electronic communications from Vice Media Group, which may include marketing promotions, advertisements and sponsored content.</p></div></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.adriancooney.ie/blog/web-scraping-via-javascript-heap-snapshots">https://www.adriancooney.ie/blog/web-scraping-via-javascript-heap-snapshots</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37047746">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In recent years, the web has gotten very hostile to the lowly web scraper. It's a result of the natural progression of web technologies away from statically rendered pages to dynamic apps built with frameworks like React and CSS-in-JS. Developers no longer need to label their data with class-names or ids - it's only a courtesy to screen readers now.</p>
<p>There's also been a concerted effort by large companies to protect their public data. Facebook, for example, employs a <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/04/how-we-combat-scraping/" node="[object Object]">team of over 100 people</a> to make sure it is as difficult as possible for any data to escape the black hole. Granted, some of these large companies do offer APIs for their data but rarely is this unrestricted. You're usually at the whim of their app review process or granted access only to a partial view of the data. Data that would be otherwise public if you were to do a Google search and click through to their website manually.</p>
<div><p><span><span></span><img alt="How HTML looks nowadays" srcset="https://www.adriancooney.ie/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fnpzloj4jufpj%2F6fDxT3Yshk7RQNidx1tDA8%2F07eecdbd9539d44a60e8f1da6b00ef5d%2FScreenshot_2022-04-26_at_23.25.09.png&amp;w=1080&amp;q=75 1x, https://www.adriancooney.ie/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fnpzloj4jufpj%2F6fDxT3Yshk7RQNidx1tDA8%2F07eecdbd9539d44a60e8f1da6b00ef5d%2FScreenshot_2022-04-26_at_23.25.09.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://www.adriancooney.ie/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fnpzloj4jufpj%2F6fDxT3Yshk7RQNidx1tDA8%2F07eecdbd9539d44a60e8f1da6b00ef5d%2FScreenshot_2022-04-26_at_23.25.09.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" loading="lazy" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p><p>How HTML looks nowadays</p></div>
<p>This can be frustrating if you're like me - somebody who wanted to build a small, local, non-profit app that uses data hosted on a closed platform. The data is public but completely inaccessible to machines because of aggressive anti-web-scraping measures. That gave me two options - input the data manually or play the web-scraping game. Of course, I chose the latter.</p>
<h3><code>puppeteer-heap-snapshot</code> is born.</h3>
<p>After a couple of attempts at extracting the data using the usual CSS selector method of web-scraping - that is, fetching the raw HTML or booting up a browser via something like <a href="https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer" node="[object Object]">Puppeteer</a> and trying to pick the data embedded in the HTML structure - I was close to admitting defeat. It wasn't until I had an epiphany: the data is <em>inside</em> the web page.</p>
<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/L_o_O7v1ews?controls=0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
<p>I plucked out a unique string from the data visible on the web page and took a heap snapshot of the browser's Javascript runtime via Chrome's Dev Tools. A heap snapshot is a raw dump of everything in the web app's memory (or heap). Using the Dev Tools' search function and my unique string, I managed to find a nice, well-structured object containing my string and, adjacently, all the data that my app needed. It was from this point that I focused my energy on automating this process to find and extract the data from the heap snapshot. <code>puppeteer-heap-snapshot</code> is born.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/adriancooney/puppeteer-heap-snapshot" node="[object Object]"><code>puppeteer-heap-snapshot</code></a> is a Node.js module that, given a <a href="https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer" node="[object Object]">Puppeteer</a> browser page, can capture and parse a heap snapshot and deserialize objects that contain a set of properties. It comes with a nifty CLI tool too so we can quickly prototype scrapers from our terminal.</p>
<p>For example, let's fetch the metadata from the above video:</p>
<pre><p><code><span>$ puppeteer-heap-snapshot query \
</span><span>  --url https</span><span>:</span><span>//www.youtube.com/watch\?v\=L_o_O7v1ews \</span><span>

<p>In that command, <code>puppeteer-heap-snapshot</code> booted up an instance of Chrome, navigated to the video on Youtube and took a heap snapshot of the page (58Mb in total, they can get large!). It then parsed that heap snapshot, found the object with the properties <code>channelId</code>, <code>viewCount</code>, <code>keywords</code>, and deserialized it back to us. These properties were chosen manually by working backward from the visible data on the web page to the data structure containing said data (I'll dive into that process in another blog post). We use the <code>--no-headless</code> argument to boot a windowed Chrome instance (i.e. not headless) because Google can detect and thwart headless Chrome - but that's a story for another time.</p>
<p>We can see the response is JSON! A clean, well-formed data structure extracted magically from the webpage. On top of that, the definition of the scraper is just 3 strings: <code>channelId</code>, <code>viewCount</code> and <code>keywords</code>! We no longer have to maintain a complex web scraper tightly coupled to the semantics of an ever-changing webpage. Instead, we can target objects that do not change often like API response objects or well-defined entities.</p>
<h3>Future proof web-scraping?</h3>
<p>You can imagine the grin on my face when I managed to circumvent the aforementioned closed-platform aggressive anti-web-scraping measures using this method. I experimented with other platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter and they're all susceptible to the technique after tweaking a few parameters. I've been using <code>puppeteer-heap-snapshot</code> in production for quite some time now and it's working surprisingly well.</p>
<div><p><span><span></span><img alt="Me not fixing a broken web scraper and having more fun" srcset="https://www.adriancooney.ie/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fnpzloj4jufpj%2F1rxzUBV0ImX5FUOWhqYvFQ%2F07221f3d6d437958df4c9d5c037fd05b%2Fantonino-visalli-RNiBLy7aHck-unsplash__2_.jpg&amp;w=640&amp;q=75 1x, https://www.adriancooney.ie/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fnpzloj4jufpj%2F1rxzUBV0ImX5FUOWhqYvFQ%2F07221f3d6d437958df4c9d5c037fd05b%2Fantonino-visalli-RNiBLy7aHck-unsplash__2_.jpg&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://www.adriancooney.ie/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fnpzloj4jufpj%2F1rxzUBV0ImX5FUOWhqYvFQ%2F07221f3d6d437958df4c9d5c037fd05b%2Fantonino-visalli-RNiBLy7aHck-unsplash__2_.jpg&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" loading="lazy" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p><p>Me not fixing a broken web scraper and having more fun</p></div>
<p>This method still comes with the same caveats that web-scraping always had - the public data could be here today, gone tomorrow and there is nothing you can do about it. The benefit of this technique though is the maintenance cost of the web scraper is greatly reduced and I'd even wager they will break <em>far less</em> than the current standard pattern.</p>
<p>It's costly for systems like web apps to change their underlying data structures because they're usually tightly coupled to the server meaning property names of objects are unlikely to change over time. On top of that, attempting to break the technique by obfuscating the data structure would be a large and costly undertaking because it would require obfuscating the entire stack - a mighty feat. Is this possibly a future-proof web-scraping technique? Maybe .. Web Assembly might be the final nail in the coffin.</p>
<h3>Get started heap snapshot scraping.</h3>
<p>Hop on over to <a href="https://github.com/adriancooney/puppeteer-heap-snapshot" node="[object Object]"><code>puppeteer-heap-snapshot</code>'s Github Page</a> to get started using it (now that it's <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/18/web-scraping-legal-court/" node="[object Object]">officially legal</a>!). It's still in an experimental/beta phase so proceed with caution when deploying. It's also incredibly slow - I didn't put any effort into optimizing the algorithms that query the (huge) heap snapshot data structures because I had more pressing features to build so please don't kill me for the CPU spikes (your orchestrator might kill your containers though, a lesson learned).</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Monitoring your logs is mostly a tarpit</h2>

	<p><small>August  6, 2023</small></p>
</div><div><p>One of the reactions to <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/linux/SystemdRestartHidesProblems">my entry on how systemd's auto-restarting
of units can hide problems</a>
was a suggestion that we should monitor our logs to detect things
like this. As it happens, one of my potentially unpopular views is
that monitoring your logs is generally a tarpit that isn't worth
it. Much of the time you'll spend a great deal of effort to get
very little of worth.</p>

<p>The fundamental problem with general log monitoring is that logs
are functionally unstructured. Anything can appear in them and in
a sufficiently complex environment, anything eventually will. This
unstructured randomness means that sorting general signal from
general noise is a large and often never-ending job, and if you
don't do it well, you wind up with a lot of noise (which makes it
almost impossible in practice to spot the signal).</p>

<p>One thing you can theoretically sensibly monitor your logs for is
specific, narrow signals of things of interest; for example, you
might monitor Linux kernel logs for <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/linux/MCEUseRasdaemon">machine check error messages</a>. The first problem with monitoring this
way is that there's no guarantee that the message you're monitoring
for won't change. Maybe someday the Linux kernel developers will
decide to put more information in their MCE messages and change the
format. One reason this happens is that almost no one considers log
messages to be an API, and so they feel free to change log messages
at whim.</p>

<p>(But in the mean time, maybe you'll derive enough value or reassurance
from looking for the current MCE messages in your kernel logs. It's a
tradeoff, which I'll get to.)</p>

<p>The second problem with monitoring for specific narrow signals of
interest in your logs is that you have to know what they look like.
It's easy to say that we'll monitor for the Prometheus host agent
crashing and systemd restarting it, but it's much harder to be sure
that we have properly identified the complete collection of log
messages that signal this happening. Remember, log messages are
unstructured, which means it's hard to get a complete inventory of
what to look for short of things like reading the (current) program
source code to see what it logs.</p>

<p>Finally, all of this potential effort only matters if identifiable
problems appear in your logs on a sufficiently regular basis and
it's useful to know about them. In other words, problems that happen,
that you care about, and probably that you can do something about.
If a problem was probably a one time occurrence or occurs infrequently,
the payoff from automated log monitoring for it can be potentially
quite low (you can see this as an aspect of <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/sysadmin/AlertsNeverComprehensive">how alerts and
monitoring can never be comprehensive</a>).</p>

<p>But monitoring your logs looks productive and certainly sounds good
and proper. You can write some positive matches to find known
problems, you can write some negative matches to discard noise, you
can 'look for anomalies' and then refine your filtering, and so on.
That's what makes it a tarpit; it's quite easy to thoroughly mire
yourself in progressively more complex log monitoring.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>  We successfully synthesized polycrystalline LK-99-like ceramic samples with a
solid-state-sintering method. Powder X-ray diffraction shows that the main
contents are $\mathrm{Pb_{10-x}Cu_x(PO_4)_6O}$ and $\mathrm{Cu_2S}$, consistent
with recent reports [<a data-arxiv-id="2307.12037" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12037">arXiv:2307.12037</a>; <a data-arxiv-id="2308.01192" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01192">arXiv:2308.01192</a>]. In some small flaky
fragments, we successfully observed ``half levitation'' atop a
$\mathrm{Nd_2Fe_{14}B}$ magnet. Using magnetization measurements on such small
pieces, as well as on a large piece which does not exhibit the half levitation,
we show that the samples ubiquitously contain weak yet definitive soft
ferromagnetic components. We argue that, together with the pronounced shape
anisotropy of the small fragments, the soft ferromagnetism is sufficient to
explain the observed half levitation in strong vertical magnetic fields. Our
measurements do not indicate the presence of the Meissner effect, nor zero
resistance, in our samples, leading us to believe that our samples do not
exhibit superconductivity.

            <span>Abstract:</span>  The report of synthesis of modified Lead apatite (LK-99) with evidence of
superconductivity at more than boiling water temperature has steered the whole
scientific community. There have been several failures to reproduce
superconductivity in LK-99 including partial successes. Here, we have continued
our efforts to synthesize phase pure LK-99 with improved precursors. The
process has been followed as suggested by Sukbae Lee et. al., [1,2]. The phase
purity of each precursor is evidenced by Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and
well fitted by Rietveld refinement. The PXRD confirms the synthesis of phase
pure polycrystalline LK-99 with apatite structure. The freshly synthesized
sample does not show any signature of superconductivity levitation on a magnet
(diamagnetism). The magnetization measurements on SQUID also show that LK-99 is
diamagnetic at 280 K, there is no sign of superconductivity in LK-99 at room
temperature. Moreover, we have also performed first principle calculations to
investigate the electronic band structure of the LK-99 near Fermi level. Our
study verifies that the Cu doped lead apatite (LK-99) has bands crossing at
Fermi level, indicating generation of strong correlation in the system.

<p>Malignant melanoma, a dangerous type of skin cancer, deploys an elegant molecular mechanism to evade natural immune responses and the therapies intended to boost them, according to new work led by scientists at the <a href="https://www.cancer.columbia.edu/cancer.columbia.edu">Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center</a> (HICCC). The findings, published in the current issue of Cancer Cell, explain how these tumors resist an important class of treatments, and suggests new strategies for attacking this and possibly other types of cancer as well.</p>
<p>Normally, the immune system eliminates abnormal cells, but cancers can elude it in various ways. For the past few years, <a href="https://www.cancer.columbia.edu/profile/benjamin-izar-md">Benjamin Izar, MD, PhD</a>, assistant professor of medicine at Columbia University <a href="https://www.vagelos.columbia.edu/">Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons</a> and a member of the HICCC, has been studying how malignant melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer, hides itself from immune cells. Initially, Izar’s team identified a signature pattern of gene expression changes associated with melanoma’s apparent cloaking device. “This signature was composed of a couple of hundred genes, so it was difficult to prioritize which of these may be the major functional driver,” says Izar.</p>
<p>More recent experiments singled out a cell surface protein called CD58; in laboratory experiments, tumor cells that suppressed their CD58 expression got much better at escaping immune surveillance. CD58 stimulates T cells, white blood cells especially important for anti-tumor responses. “The activity of T cells is regulated in a variety of ways, so they eliminate cancer or infected cells, but don’t go overboard causing damage to normal tissues,” says Izar. The findings hinted at how melanomas might be hiding from T cells, but didn’t provide the whole story. “This was the basis for asking ‘what are the mechanisms by which CD58 loss may drive cancer immune evasion?’” says Izar, who is the senior author on the new paper.</p>
<p>Izar’s team, including a network of collaborators at institutions across the US and Europe, developed several new techniques to find the answer. To validate their earlier laboratory results, the scientists analyzed samples from melanoma patients before and during treatment with immune-targeting therapies, confirming that real tumors decrease CD58 expression while evading immunity. Meanwhile, “Patricia Ho, an outstanding MD/PhD student in my lab, performed a cool [molecular and cellular] analysis to identify, in an unbiased fashion, the key regulator of CD58: [the protein] CMTM6,” says Izar. The investigators also developed a special mouse model carrying specific human genes and cell types to see exactly how CD58, CMTM6, and other proteins operate in tumors facing the immune system in real time.</p>
<p>The results show that CMTM6 acts as a stabilizer, inhibiting the degradation of both CD58, which stimulates T cell activity, and another cell surface protein called PD-L1, which inhibits it. In fact, these two opposing signaling proteins compete with each other for CMTM6, so by reducing the amount of the pro-T cell CD58, tumor cells free up more of the CMTM6 to stabilize the anti-T cell PD-L1. “This is a double whammy to T cell activity: loss of activation and increased inhibition,” says Izar.</p>
<p>The work helps explain how malignant melanomas readily acquire resistance to immune-targeting therapies and points to ways drug developers might reverse the signaling pattern to restore the tumor’s vulnerability, exchanging its cloaking device for a high-visibility jumpsuit.</p>
<p>“We found, to our knowledge, the first example of a regulatory protein … that balances this yin and yang of immuno-stimulatory and inhibitory signals on cancer cells,” says Izar, adding that “it’s extremely likely that this mechanism is important in other cancers as well.”</p>

<p><strong>Update: </strong>Hours after this post was published, my Goodreads profile was cleaned of the offending titles. However, the garbage books remain available for sale at Amazon with my name attached.</p>



<p>I did file a report with Amazon, complaining that these books were using my name and reputation without my consent. Amazon’s response: “Please provide us with any trademark registration numbers that relate to your claim.” When I replied that I did not have a trademark for my name, they closed the case and said the books would not be removed from sale.</p>



<hr>



<p>There’s not much that makes me angry these days about writing and publishing. I’ve seen it all. I know what to expect from Amazon and Goodreads. Meaning: I don’t expect much, and I assume I will be continually disappointed. Nor do I have the power to change how they operate. My energy-saving strategy: move on and focus on what you can control.</p>



<p>That’s going to become much harder to do if Amazon and Goodreads don’t start defending against the absolute garbage now being spread across their sites.</p>



<p>I know my work gets pirated and frankly I don’t care. (I’m not saying other authors shouldn’t care, but that’s not a battle worth my time today.)</p>



<p><strong>But here’s what does rankle me: </strong>garbage books getting uploaded to Amazon where my name is credited as the author. (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CDCNNX39?binding=paperback&amp;ref=dbs_dp_rwt_sb_pc_tpbk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Here’s but one example.</a>) Whoever’s doing this is obviously preying on writers who trust my name and think I’ve actually written these books. I have not. Most likely they’ve been generated by AI.</p>



<p>It might be possible to ignore this nonsense on some level since these books aren’t receiving customer reviews (so far), and mostly they sink to the bottom of search results (although not always). At the very least, if you look at my <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/Jane-Friedman/author/B004KHXQ0U?ref=ap_rdr&amp;store_ref=ap_rdr&amp;isDramIntegrated=true&amp;shoppingPortalEnabled=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">author profile on Amazon</a>, these junk books don’t appear. A reader who applies some critical thinking might think twice before accepting these books as mine.</p>



<p>Still, it’s not great. And it falls on me, the author—the one with a reputation at stake—to get these misleading books removed from Amazon. I’m not even sure it’s possible. I don’t own the copyright to these junk books. I don’t exactly “own” my name either—lots of other people who are also legit authors share my name, after all. So on what grounds can I successfully demand this stop, at least in Amazon’s eyes? I’m not sure.</p>



<p><strong>To add insult to injury, these sham books are getting added to <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/625709.Jane_Friedman" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">my official Goodreads profile</a>. </strong>A reasonable person might think I control what books are shown on my Goodreads profile, or that I approve them, or at the very least I could have them easily removed. Not so.</p>



<p>If you need to have your Goodreads profile corrected—as far as the books credited to you—you have to reach out to volunteer “librarians” on Goodreads, which requires joining a group, then posting in a comment thread that you want illegitimate books removed from your profile.</p>



<p>When I complained about this on Twitter/X, an author responded that she had to report 29 illegitimate books in just the last week alone. 29!</p>



<p>With the flood of AI content now published at Amazon, sometimes attributed to authors in a misleading or fraudulent manner, how can anyone reasonably expect working authors to spend every week for the rest of their lives policing this? And if authors <em>don’t</em> police it, they will certainly hear about it, from readers concerned about these garbage books, and from readers who credulously bought this crap and have complaints. Or authors might not hear any thing at all, and lose a potential reader forever.</p>



<p>We desperately need guardrails on this landslide of misattribution and misinformation. Amazon and Goodreads, I beg you to create a way to verify authorship, or for authors to easily block fraudulent books credited to them. Do it now, do it quickly.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, even if and when you get these insane books removed from your official profiles, they will still be floating around out there, with your name, on two major sites that gets millions of visitors, just waiting to be “discovered.” And there’s absolutely nothing you can do about it.</p>

On Monday, a group of more than 50 on-set employees filed a petition for an election to be represented by the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE) with the National Labor Relations Board. The workers are asking for the election to be held as early as August 21.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cll0zp3m3000h3b6xd2ypja31@published" data-word-count="76">This marks the first time visual-effects professionals have banded together to demand the same rights, wage protections, and professional watchdog oversight enjoyed by workers in almost every other segment of the entertainment industry. The supermajority of Marvel’s 52-member on-set production crew signed authorization cards to indicate they wish to be represented by the powerful labor union representing some 170,000 artisans, technicians, stagehands, and craftspeople across TV, film, and live theater in the United States and Canada.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cll0zp3of000i3b6x0ofvhhkt@published" data-word-count="64">“For almost half a century, workers in the visual-effects industry have been denied the same protections and benefits their coworkers and crewmates have relied upon since the beginning of the Hollywood film industry,” VFX organizer for IATSE Mark Patch said in a statement. “This is a historic first step for VFX workers coming together with a collective voice demanding respect for what we do.”</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cll0zp3q5000j3b6xgo8q7cb1@published" data-word-count="120">In an era when around 90 percent of all films in release feature varying degrees of VFX fine-tuning (and it’s not uncommon for a show like <em>Stranger Things</em> to showcase up to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/stranger-things-vfx-sound-artists-creating-vecna-1235199328/">4,400 visual-effects shots</a> across a single season), workers within the field have remained stubbornly, confoundingly unrepresented by any professional union or guild. While fellow <a href="https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/what-is-below-the-line-definition/">below-the-line</a> workers in such divisions as costumes and wardrobe; hair and makeup; lighting, props and paint; and script supervision have been historically championed by IATSE, underappreciated VFX professionals have been unable to claim benefits such as paid overtime and health care, and have been at the mercy of pronounced labor shortages and managers’ unrealistic deadlines — despite the workers’ increasing indispensability within popular culture.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cll0zp3s5000k3b6xlja3408c@published" data-word-count="52">“Turnaround times don’t apply to us, protected hours don’t apply to us, and pay equity doesn’t apply to us,” said VFX coordinator Bella Huffman. “Visual effects must become a sustainable and safe department for everyone who’s suffered far too long and for all newcomers who need to know they won’t be exploited.”</p>

  

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cll0zp3u0000l3b6xw4ostcgd@published" data-word-count="124">The petition for voluntary union recognition from Marvel and its parent company, Disney, arrives amid what the Los Angeles <em>Times</em> has taken to calling the “hot labor summer”: a cultural inflection point when both the Writers Guild and Screen Actors Guild are on strike against the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/sag-strike-movies-tv-shows-paused.html">halting productions</a> across Hollywood and throwing the upcoming movie-release corridor into chaos. Just as crucially, however, VFX’s newly strident demands for a seat at the collective-bargaining table also play out against a backdrop of increasing fan displeasure with (and <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania-movie-review-marvel.html">critical opprobrium</a> toward) the quality of computer-generated imagery in Marvel Studios movies and series, coming perhaps not coincidentally just months after the firing of Marvel’s president of postproduction and VFX, <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2023/04/victoria-alonso-firing-disney-marvel.html">Victoria Alonso</a>.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cll0zp3w0000m3b6x2ygyuj0m@published" data-word-count="42">Even with the group’s NLRB petition, a VFX workers strike is not out of the question; it is perhaps the most battle-tested and surefire route to union recognition. (Representatives at Disney and Marvel did not respond to requests for comment from Vulture.)</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cll0zp3y6000n3b6xff72l4i2@published" data-word-count="116">Leading off the collective-bargaining push with Marvel’s on-set VFX specialists — data wranglers, production managers, witness camera operators, and assistants employed on such MCU series as <a href="https://www.vulture.com/tv/loki/"><em>Loki</em></a> and <em>Daredevil: Born Again, </em>as opposed to the people supplying visual effects in postproduction — arrives as no accident. Thanks to the studio’s fire hose of movie and TV series output (it will oversee the release of five movies and four shows in 2023 alone), Marvel is regarded in VFX circles as the industry’s biggest “bully,” with the capacity to flood effects houses with more work than they know what to do with or ruin careers and standings of those who do not live up to Marvel’s sky-high expectations.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cll0zp406000o3b6xbsw691ku@published" data-word-count="188">Hence, as the thinking goes, securing union recognition for a relatively small yet high-profile group of Marvel’s so-called “production-side” professionals would stand as proof of concept for the overall viability of an industry-wide unionization push. Production-side unity would lead to solidarity at postproduction houses, which would then, in turn, unionize one by one, leading to an inevitable tipping point. The template for this sort of thing was set in the animation world last February when production workers for Adult Swim’s <em>Rick &amp; Morty</em> and Hulu’s <em>Solar Opposites </em><a href="https://www.cartoonbrew.com/artist-rights/production-workers-on-rick-and-morty-and-solar-opposites-file-to-unionize-213740.html">filed a petition</a> with the NLRB for a union election, sparking a new wave of unionization for workers throughout the animation industry by becoming the first to be represented by the IATSE-affiliated Animation Guild. Soon after, workers at the Los Angeles branch of the award-winning production house <a href="https://titmouse.net/">Titmouse</a> joined the guild to begin collective bargaining for their first union contract. And those efforts ultimately compelled a coalition of production workers on the shows <em>American Dad</em>, <em>Family Guy,</em> and <em>The Simpsons</em> <a href="https://deadline.com/2022/07/the-simpsons-family-guy-american-dad-workers-repped-by-animation-guild-1235058303/">to also unionize</a> under the Animation Guild, teeing up new collective-bargaining negotiations for increased benefits with 20th Television Animation last summer.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cll0zp41r000p3b6x2o37ogua@published" data-word-count="78">“We are witnessing an unprecedented wave of solidarity that’s breaking down old barriers in the industry and proving we’re all in this fight together,” said IATSE International president Matthew D. Loeb. “That doesn’t happen in a vacuum. Entertainment workers everywhere are sticking up for each other’s rights; that’s what our movement is all about. I congratulate these workers on taking this important step and using their collective voice. I urge Marvel Studios to voluntarily recognize their union immediately.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

                

                
                    
                        <p>I just added a big new section to learntla: <a href="https://learntla.com/topics/optimization.html" target="_blank">Optimizing TLA+ Model Checking</a>. I take a spec and then show 15 different optimizations, many of them getting a 10x runtime improvement. Patreon notes <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/notes-on-tla-87093195" target="_blank">here</a>. Besides that I've done very little writing the last couple weeks. I'm just in a slump: I sit down to write and the words all come out wrong. It happens sometimes and there's nothing to do about it but wait it out. </p>
<p>So instead of working I've been learning <a href="https://raku.org/" target="_blank">Raku</a>.<sup id="fnref:perl6"><a href="#fn:perl6">1</a></sup> It originally got on my radar after I ranted about <a href="https://buttondown.email/hillelwayne/archive/i-am-disappointed-by-dynamic-typing/" target="_blank">dynamic languages</a> and a couple of users told me I'd like Raku. I finally checked it out last week to see if it'd make a good "calculator language". I use a hodgepodge of Python, <a href="https://hillelwayne.com/post/j-notation/" target="_blank">J</a>, <a href="https://hillelwayne.com/post/frink/" target="_blank">Frink</a>, and Excel to do math and they all have their own big drawbacks, so it'd be nice if Raku could round them out.</p>
<p>After several days of experiments, I'm at a loss of <em>how</em> to describe Raku. The best I can come up with is that the language was designed by a bunch of really intelligent gremlins. Gremlins who spent a lot of time gathering feedback from other gremlins. </p>
<h3>Weird Operators</h3>
<p>Raku has no qualms about using Unicode operators. You check set membership with ∈. There's also ∉, ∋, and ∌. It's also fine with alphanumeric infix operators. String repetition op is <code>x</code>. Function composition is <code>o</code>.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>&gt; <span>"a"</span> <span>x</span> <span>3</span>
<span>aaa</span>
&gt; <span>my</span> <span>&amp;f</span> = <span>&amp;sqrt</span> <span>o</span> <span>&amp;abs</span>
{<span>noise</span>}
&gt; <span>f</span> -<span>3</span>
<span>1.7320508075688772</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p><code>X</code> gives you the cross product of a list, <code>Xf</code> applies <code>f</code> to each element of the cross product, <code>Zf</code> does the same with zip.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>&gt; <span>&lt;a b c&gt;</span> <span>X</span> <span>&lt;1 2 3&gt;</span>
((<span>a</span> <span>1</span>) (<span>a</span> <span>2</span>) (<span>a</span> <span>3</span>) (<span>b</span> <span>1</span>) (<span>b</span> <span>2</span>) (<span>b</span> <span>3</span>) (<span>c</span> <span>1</span>) (<span>c</span> <span>2</span>) (<span>c</span> <span>3</span>))

<p>If <code>f</code> is an infix operator, then <code>[f]</code> reduces a list and <code>[\f]</code> accumulates it: </p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>&gt; [+] <span>&lt;1 2 3 4 5&gt;</span>
<span>15</span>
&gt; [\+] <span>&lt;1 2 3 4 5&gt;</span>
(<span>1</span> <span>3</span> <span>6</span> <span>10</span> <span>15</span>)
</code></pre></div>

<p><code>~~</code> is the "anything goes" matcher.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>&gt; <span>"abc"</span> ~~ <span>"abc"</span> <span># do the strings match?</span>
<span>True</span>
&gt; <span>"abc"</span> ~~ <span>Str</span> <span># is abc a string?</span>
<span>True</span>
&gt; <span>"abc"</span> ~~ {.<span>chars</span> == <span>3</span>} <span># is abc length 3?</span>
<span>True</span>
&gt; <span>so</span> <span>"abc"</span> ~~<span> /^b/</span> <span>#does abc start with b?</span>
<span>False</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Finally, there's <code>...</code>.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>&gt; <span>0</span>,<span>1</span>,<span>2</span>..<span>.10</span>
(<span>0</span> <span>1</span> <span>2</span> <span>3</span> <span>4</span> <span>5</span> <span>6</span> <span>7</span> <span>8</span> <span>9</span> <span>10</span>)

&gt; <span>0</span>,<span>2</span>,<span>4</span>..<span>.10</span>
(<span>0</span> <span>2</span> <span>4</span> <span>6</span> <span>8</span> <span>10</span>)

&gt; <span>1</span>,<span>2</span>,<span>4</span>..<span>.10</span>
(<span>1</span> <span>2</span> <span>4</span> <span>8</span>)
</code></pre></div>

<h3>Defining operators</h3>
<p>So you know how some languages let you define infix operators? Raku lets you also define new circumfix and <em>postcircumfix</em> operators.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span># circumfix</span>
<span>sub</span> <span>circumfix:</span><span>&lt;[∀ zz&gt;</span>(<span>$inner</span>){<span>sum</span>(<span>$inner</span>)}
&gt; [∀ <span>1</span>,<span>3</span>,<span>5</span>..<span>.10</span> <span>zz</span>
<span>25</span>

<span># vector inner product!</span>
<span>sub</span> <span>postcircumfix:</span><span>&lt;| ⟩&gt;</span>(<span>@left</span>, <span>@inside</span>){[+] (<span>@left</span> <span>Z</span>* <span>@inside</span>)}
&gt; <span>&lt;1 2 3&gt;</span>|<span>&lt;4 5 6&gt;</span>⟩
<span>32</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>In addition to left- and right-associative infix operators, you can define operators to be chain associative (like how <code>x &lt; y &lt; z</code> is <code>x &lt; y &amp;&amp; y &lt; z</code>) and "list" associative (<code>a op b op c</code> is <code>op(a, b, c)</code>).</p>
<h3>Multiple dispatch</h3>
<p>So Raku has "multiple dispatch", meaning that you overload a function with multiple different type signatures and it will choose the appropriate one. </p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span># @ is for iterable types</span>

<span>multi</span> <span>f</span>(<span>$x</span>,<span>@arr</span>) {<span>@arr</span>.<span>map</span>(-&gt; <span>$elem</span> {<span>$elem</span> + <span>$x</span>})}
<span>multi</span> <span>f</span>(<span>@arr</span>, <span>$x</span>) {<span>@arr</span>.<span>map</span>(-&gt; <span>$elem</span> {<span>$elem</span> + <span>$x</span>})}
<span>multi</span> <span>f</span>(<span>@arr1</span>, <span>@arr2</span>) {<span>@arr1</span> <span>Z</span>+ <span>@arr2</span>}

&gt; <span>f</span>(<span>2</span>, <span>&lt;1 2 3&gt;</span>);
(<span>3</span> <span>4</span> <span>5</span>)

&gt; <span>f</span>(<span>&lt;1 2 3&gt;</span>, <span>&lt;3 4 5&gt;</span>)
(<span>4</span> <span>6</span> <span>8</span>)
</code></pre></div>

<p>This isn't weird, lots of languages have multiple dispatch. What <em>is</em> weird is that you can also dispatch based on a <em>runtime predicate of the value</em>.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>multi</span> <span>my_abs</span>(<span>Int</span> <span>$x</span> <span>where</span> {<span>$x</span> &gt; <span>0</span>}) {<span>$x</span>}
<span>multi</span> <span>my_abs</span>(<span>Int</span> <span>$x</span>) {-<span>$x</span>}

&gt; <span>map</span> <span>&amp;my_abs</span>, <span>&lt;-4 4&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Also the signature of a function is a first-class value, as are the parameters in the signature.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Things</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you define a <code>MAIN</code> function, any parameters you give it will be automatically turned into CLI flags.</li>
<li>Objects have way more preloaded methods than I've seen in any language, and I used to do Rails. The <a href="https://docs.raku.org/type/List" target="_blank">List object</a> has methods for getting all permutations, all k-combinations, and all sliding windows.</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.raku.org/type/Junction" target="_blank">Junctions</a> are this weird type-value-thing for doing multiple comparisons at once. <code>1|2</code> expands to <code>any(1, 2)</code>, so <code>1 &lt; 1|2</code>. <code>1&amp;2</code> expands to <code>all(1, 2)</code>, so <code>1 !&lt; 1&amp;2</code>.<ul>
<li>Oh yeah and you can negate any infix operator by prefixing it with <code>!</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Raku is the only language I've ever seen that has <code>$kebab-case</code> names <em>and</em> infix subtraction, I'm guessing because sigils disambiguate <code>x-y</code>.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/regexes" target="_blank">regex syntax</a> isn't backwards compatible with Perl 5. For <em>thirty years</em> languages followed the PCRE "standard" and Perl 6 just…  threw it all away.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>That's just a tiny slice of all the weird Raku features, since I've only been looking at calculator applications so far. I haven't even learned about the object system, packages, or <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/grammar_tutorial" target="_blank">grammars</a>! And even so, I <em>still</em> left out a ton of stuff. Like in a function body, <code>samewith</code> will call the same function with new arguments.</p>
<p>I think if I had to maintain a Raku legacy codebase my brain would explode. I have no idea how people would manage to write this language In The Large. At the same time, it seems incredible for programming In The Small. One-off scripts, computations, personal tooling, all the kinds of things I wanted to do with it in the first place.</p>
<p>I've also seen some really frustrating things:</p>
<ol>
<li>The documentation is really poor and the heavy reliance on symbols makes it hard to search for things. I've learned a lot of poorly-documented languages but Raku is much bigger and more complex than any of them and it can be real demotivating.</li>
<li>The REPL crashes on Windows if I type in any Unicode. The compiler is also pretty slow, with even small files taking half a second or more. Iterating on things is painful.</li>
<li>I hate the sigil thing. I spent half an hour debugging a problem because I wrote <code>$x</code> instead of <code>@x</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Overall? Maybe I'm just a gremlin at heart, but I think I like this language and want it to succeed. I assume I'll have a more balanced picture thoughts after I use it in anger. I just hope that over time the compile times and documentation improve.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article> <div id="readme"><h2>Doculite</h2>
<p>DocuLite lets you use SQLite like Firebase Firestore. It's written in Typescript and an adapter on top of sqlite3 and sqlite. It support listeners on documents, collections, and basic queries. Feedback &amp; Bugs to <a href="mailto:thedoculite@gmail.com">thedoculite@gmail.com</a>.
This is early work, so please treat it appropriately.</p>
<h2>Current features</h2>
<h2>1. Initialize a DB</h2>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>import { Database } from "doculite"
const db = new Database();
</code></pre>
<h2>2. Create Collections and Set Documents</h2>
<p>Collections are created on first insertion of a document. They are represented by a SQLite Table.</p>
<pre><code>// create ref to the doc. Doc ID optional.

const usersRef = db.collection("users").doc("123");
const refWithoutId = db.collection("users").doc();

// Any valid Javascript object that can be parsed to valid JSON can be inserted as a document.

await usersRef.set({ username: "John Doe", createdAt: "123", updatedAt: "123" });
await refWithoutId.set({ username: "Jane Doe" });

</code></pre>
<h2>3. Get a particular document</h2>
<pre><code>// define ref
const usersRef = db.collection("users").doc("123");
// get
const user = await usersRef.get();
// print
console.log(user); // prints { username: "John Doe" };

</code></pre>
<h2>4. Update Documents in Collections</h2>
<pre><code>// ref
const usersRef = db.collection("users").doc("123");

// Properties existing on both old and new object will be updated.
// Properties only existing on the new object will be added.

// If merge is false, properties only present on the old object will be deleted.
// Merge is true by default

await ref.set({ username: "DERP Doe", updatedAt: "345" }, { merge: true });
// document in DB is now { username: "DERP Doe", updatedAt: "345", createdAt: "123" }

await ref.set({ username: "DERP Doe", updatedAt: "345" }, { merge: false });
// document in DB is now { username: "DERP Doe", updatedAt: "345" }

</code></pre>
<h2>5. Delete Documents in Collection</h2>
<pre><code>const db = new Database();

const ref = db.collection("users").doc("deletable");

await ref.set({ username: "deletableUsername", updatedAt: 123123 });

await ref.delete();

const doc = await ref.get();

console.log(doc) // prints null

</code></pre>
<h2>6. Listen to real-time updates of documents.</h2>
<pre><code>
// ref to doc
const ref = db.collection("users").doc("123");

// snapshot listener returns unsubscribe function
const unsub = ref.onSnapshot((doc) =&gt; {
console.log("Omg the user doc is updating!", doc?.username);
});

await ref.set({ username: "SHEESH Doe", updatedAt: 2 });
// prints: `Omg the user doc is updating! SHEESH Doe`

// unsub
unsub();

</code></pre>
<h2>7. Query Documents in a collection by equality comparison</h2>
<pre><code>
const usersRef = db.collection("users");

await usersRef.doc().set({ username: "Doculite", updatedAt: 234 });

const query = usersRef.where("username", "Doculite");

const docs = await query.get();

const user = docs[0]

console.log(user.username) // prints `Doculite`

</code></pre>
<h2>Potential roadmap:</h2>
<ol>
<li>Better query-based system</li>
<li>Stability and speed updates</li>
<li>Delete collections</li>
<li>Subcollections</li>
<li>Listeners on queries / multiple documents</li>
<li>Queries with other comparison operators (&lt;, &gt;, &gt;=, &lt;=, contains, etc.)</li>
<li>Queries for multiple variables (without indexes, probably)</li>
<li>Queries with Full Text Search (without indexes, probably)</li>
</ol>

    </div>
<p>Rechargeable lithium-ion batteries power smartphones, electric vehicles and storage for solar and wind energy, among other technologies.

										  
											        </p>
										 
										 											  
<p>They descend from another technology, the lithium-metal battery, that hasn't been developed or adopted as broadly. There's a reason for that: While lithium-metal batteries have the potential to hold about double the energy that lithium-ion batteries can, they also present a far greater risk of catching fire or even exploding.
</p><p>Now, a study by members of the California NanoSystems Institute at UCLA reveals a fundamental discovery that could lead to safer lithium-metal batteries that outperform today's lithium-ion batteries. The research was published today in the journal <i>Nature</i>.
</p><p>Metallic lithium reacts so easily with chemicals that, under normal conditions, corrosion forms almost immediately while the metal is being laid down on a surface such as an electrode. But the UCLA investigators developed a technique that prevents that corrosion and showed that, in its absence, lithium atoms assemble into a surprising shape—the rhombic dodecahedron, a 12-sided figure similar to the dice used in role-playing games like Dungeons and Dragons.
</p><p>"There are thousands of papers on lithium metal, and most descriptions of the structure is qualitative, such as 'chunky' or 'column-like,'" said Yuzhang Li, the study's corresponding author, an assistant professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering at the UCLA Samueli School of Engineering and a member of CNSI.
</p><p>"It was surprising for us to discover that when we prevented surface corrosion, instead of these ill-defined shapes, we saw a singular polyhedron that matches theoretical predictions based on the metal's crystal structure. Ultimately, this study allows us to revise how we understand lithium-metal batteries."
</p><p>At tiny scales, a lithium-ion battery stores positively charged lithium atoms in a cage-like structure of carbon that coats an electrode. By contrast, a lithium-metal battery instead coats the electrode with metallic lithium. That packs 10 times more lithium into the same space compared to <a href="https://phys.org/tags/lithium-ion+batteries/" rel="tag">lithium-ion batteries</a>, which accounts for the increase in both performance and danger.
</p><p>The process for laying down the lithium coating is based on a 200-plus-year-old technique that employs electricity and solutions of salts called electrolytes. Often, the lithium forms microscopic branching filaments with protruding spikes. In a battery, if two of those spikes crisscross, it can cause a <a href="https://phys.org/tags/short+circuit/" rel="tag">short circuit</a> that could lead to an explosion.


											  													    </p>
											  
											  <p>The revelation of the true shape of lithium—that is, in the absence of corrosion—suggests that the explosion risk for lithium-metal batteries can be abated, because the atoms accumulate in an orderly form instead of one that can crisscross. The discovery could also have substantial implications for high-performance energy technology.
</p><p>"Scientists and engineers have produced over two decades' worth of research into synthesizing metals including gold, platinum and silver into shapes such as nanocubes, nanospheres and nanorods," Li said. "Now that we know the shape of lithium, the question is, Can we tune it so that it forms cubes, which can be packed in densely to increase both the safety and performance of batteries?"

    </div>

<p>Until now, the prevailing view had been that the choice of electrolytes in solution determines the shape that lithium forms on a surface—whether the structure resembles chunks or columns. The UCLA researchers had a different idea.
</p><p>"We wanted to see if we could deposit lithium so quickly that we outpace the reaction that causes the corrosion film," said UCLA doctoral student Xintong Yuan, the study's first author. "That way, we could potentially see how the lithium wants to grow in the absence of that film."
</p><p>The researchers developed a new technique for depositing lithium faster than corrosion forms. They ran current through a much smaller electrode in order to push electricity out faster—much like the way that partially blocking the nozzle of a garden hose causes water to shoot out more forcefully.
</p><p>A balance was required, however, because speeding up the process too much would lead to the same spiky structures that cause short circuits; the team addressed that issue by adjusting the shape of their tiny electrode.
</p><p>They laid down lithium on surfaces using four different electrolytes, comparing results between a standard technique and their new method. With corrosion, the lithium formed four distinct microscopic shapes. However, with their corrosion-free process, they found that the lithium formed miniscule dodecahedrons—no bigger than 2 millionths of a meter, or about the average length of a single bacterium—in all four cases.
</p><p>The researchers were able to see the shape of lithium thanks to an imaging technique called <a href="https://phys.org/tags/cryo-electron+microscopy/" rel="tag">cryo-electron microscopy</a>, or cryo-EM, which beams electrons through frozen samples in order to show details down to the atomic level while inhibiting damage to the samples.
</p><p>Cryo-EM has become ubiquitous in biosciences for determining the structures of proteins and viruses. Use for <a href="https://phys.org/tags/materials+science/" rel="tag">materials science</a> is growing, and the UCLA researchers had two key advantages.
</p><p>First, when Li was a graduate student, he demonstrated that cryo-EM can be used to analyze lithium, which falls to pieces when exposed to an electron beam at room temperature. Second, the team performed experiments at CNSI's Electron Imaging Center for Nanomachines, which is home to several cryo-EM instruments that have been customized to accommodate the types of samples used in materials research.
</p><p>"Cross-pollination between the biology and chemistry communities is producing new ideas," said Matthew Mecklenburg, a co-author of the study and managing director of the imaging center. "We're applying our extensive experience analyzing small molecules, proteins and viruses using cryo-EM methods in new ways to look at battery materials that are sensitive to the electron beam."
</p><p>Li said the new technique for depositing <a href="https://phys.org/tags/lithium/" rel="tag">lithium</a> still requires further work to optimize it.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
							
<p>Well, well, well... It looks like <a href="https://stackdiary.com/brave-selling-copyrighted-data-for-ai-training/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Brave</a> isn't the only company out there that is willing to bet all its chips on reusing other people's content for AI training. </p>



<p>Zoom Video Communications, Inc. <a href="https://explore.zoom.us/en/terms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently updated its Terms of Service</a> to encompass what some critics are calling a significant invasion of user privacy.</p>



<p>In a detailed perusal of the newly updated terms, two sections - <strong>10.2</strong> and <strong>10.4</strong> - stand out for their broad-ranging implications on how Zoom is permitted to utilize user data. These sections establish Zoom's rights to compile and utilize "Service Generated Data," which is any telemetry data, product usage data, diagnostic data, and similar content or data that Zoom collects in connection with users' use of their services or software.</p>



<p>Zoom's updated policy states that all rights to Service Generated Data are retained solely by Zoom. This extends to Zoom's rights to modify, distribute, process, share, maintain, and store such data "for any purpose, to the extent and in the manner permitted under applicable law."</p>



<p>What raises alarm is the explicit mention of the company's right to use this data for machine learning and artificial intelligence, including training and tuning of algorithms and models. This effectively allows Zoom to train its AI on customer content without providing an opt-out option, a decision that is likely to spark significant debate about user privacy and consent.</p>



<p>Additionally, under section 10.4 of the updated terms, Zoom has secured a "perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicensable, and transferable license" to redistribute, publish, access, use, store, transmit, review, disclose, preserve, extract, modify, reproduce, share, use, display, copy, distribute, translate, transcribe, create derivative works, and process Customer Content.</p>



<p>Zoom justifies these actions as necessary for providing services to customers, supporting the services, and improving its services, software, or other products. However, the implications of such terms are far-reaching, particularly as they appear to permit Zoom to use customer data for any purpose relating to the uses or acts described in section 10.3.</p>



<p>Privacy advocates and legal experts are expected to scrutinize these updated terms closely. Many argue that they push the boundaries of what is acceptable in terms of consent, data privacy, and individual rights. While Zoom's intentions may be focused on improving their platform and delivering better service, the breadth and depth of these changes may leave many users uncomfortable and seeking assurances about how their data is being used.</p>



<p>Zoom has yet to comment (added below) on the updates and potential concerns raised by these changes. As this unfolds, the debate around privacy in the digital age and the responsibility of companies in respecting user privacy continues to intensify.</p>

<h3>An update</h3>



<p>Biella Coleman picked this story up and <a href="https://twitter.com/BiellaColeman/status/1688332659108257792" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted it out</a>, which got this trending and invoked a response from Zoom. </p>



<p>Aparna Bawa, COO at Zoom, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37029700" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">left a comment on Hacker News</a>,</p>



<blockquote>
<p>To clarify, Zoom customers decide whether to enable generative AI features (recently launched on a free trial basis) and separately whether to share customer content with Zoom for product improvement purposes.</p>



<p>Also, Zoom participants receive an in-meeting notice or a Chat Compose pop-up when these features are enabled through our UI, and they will definitely know their data may be used for product improvement purposes.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>I myself also got an email from a spokesperson, who said that, <em>"Zoom customers decide whether to enable generative AI features, and separately whether to share customer content with Zoom for product improvement purposes."</em>.</p>



<p>While these are all lovely responses, and at least they're being involved in the discussion, they don't actually answer the <strong>10.4</strong> clause in the Terms of Service, which states,</p>



<blockquote>
<p>You agree to grant and hereby grant Zoom a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicensable, and transferable license and all other rights required or necessary to redistribute, publish, import, access, use, store, transmit, review, disclose, preserve, extract, modify, reproduce, share, use, display, copy, distribute, translate, transcribe, create derivative works, and process Customer Content and to perform all acts with respect to the Customer Content, including AI and ML training and testing.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Unless these are rectified and clarified, this means that Zoom can do exactly what they say they can do because you are agreeing to grant all the abovementioned permissions. I cannot stress enough that these aren't just "words at a wall" - in the <strong>10.2</strong> clause, you literally consent to Zoom using your data for AI/ML; you do not have a choice to opt-out because opting-out is not part of the terms.</p>



<p>Zoom has published a blog post on the matter; <a href="https://twitter.com/Zoom/status/1688550493717417985" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">you can see the tweet here</a>. </p>



<p>I'm linking to the tweet (and you can also read <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37034980" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this Hacker News comment</a>) because there should be discourse (unfortunately, for Zoom, it's not in their favor) around this rather than blank statements.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
					<p>Git is a widely used distributed version control system that allows software development teams to have multiple local copies of the project's source code that are independent of each other. Version control has come to be associated with Git—it is unquestionably the best version control program for new developers to start learning due to its popularity and wealth of resources related to its use. Read on for an overview of the basics.</p>

<h2>Git configuration: Linux</h2>

<p>Most Linux installations have Git, but to check, execute the following command in your terminal:</p>

<pre><code>$ git --version</code></pre>

<p>You should get output that is similar to the following:</p>

<pre>git version 2.40.1</pre>

<h2>Git configuration: Windows</h2>

<p>Git searches the <code>$HOME</code> directory for the <code>.gitconfig</code> file on Windows systems.</p>

<p>We need to tell Git to keep track of our login and email when we use it, as shown in the code snippet below. This makes it possible for other code contributors to identify the change's author and our contact information in case of problems.</p>

<pre><code>$ git config --global user.name "username"

$ git config --global user.email "useremail"</code></pre>

<p>Use the following command if you need assistance:</p>

<pre><code>$ git help config</code></pre>

<p>This command will open a browser containing configuration commands. Essentially, the <code>help</code> command gives a manual from the help page for the given command.</p>

<p>You can also use the same command in the following ways:</p>

<pre><code>$ git config --help</code></pre>

<p>Use the following command to view configurations:</p>

<pre><code>$ git config -l</code></pre>

<h2>Working with repositories</h2>

<p>A directory that Git will track is called a <strong>repository</strong>,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>or repo. The Git repository contains the whole of our project. Git will trace any change we make. We'll use the command below to create a test directory:</p>

<pre><code>$ mkdir test</code></pre>

<p>We can then use the following command to enter the test directory:</p>

<pre><code>$ cd test</code></pre>

<p>Running <code>git init</code> command inside the directory lets Git know that it is a Git repository:</p>

<pre><code>$ git init&nbsp;

Empty Git repository created and initialised in /home/uname/test/.git</code></pre>

<p>Now a Git repository exists in this directory. Showing the <code>.git</code> file that Git generated inside the directory will be helpful; use the command as follows:</p>

<pre><code>$ ls -a</code></pre>

<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>

<pre>.git</pre>

<p>The directory is now a Git repository. In fact, deleting the <code>.git</code> directory will uninitialize the repository (this can be very helpful when you're just starting out). Run the following command to make your directory a non-Git repository:</p>

<pre><code>$ rm.git -rf</code></pre>

<p>Use this only if you truly want to start over because it will remove Git from the directory completely.</p>

<p>Let's create two files in the test directory with the names <code>file1</code> and <code>file2</code>. This will show how Git tracks files:</p>

<pre><code>$ touch file1.txt
$ touch file2.txt</code></pre>

<h2>Staging files: git add&nbsp;</h2>

<p>The principles of the staging environment and the commit are essential to Git. You can add, change, or remove files as you work. However, anytime you reach an important stage or complete a portion of the work, you should move the files to a staging environment. Files that have been <strong>staged</strong> are ready to be committed to the repository you are working on. (We'll discuss commits in more detail in a later section.)</p>

<p>We can see what Git is tracking using the following command:</p>

<pre><code>$ git status

On branch main

No commits yet

Untracked files:

&nbsp;&nbsp;(use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to include in what will be committed)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;file1.txt
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; File2.txt</code></pre>

<p><code>git status</code> displays a list of newly added or modified files and directories in the Git repository. In our example,&nbsp;<code>file1.txt</code> and <code>file2.txt</code> have been modified.</p>

<p>We must stage the files in order to instruct Git to keep track of changes. Let's use the <code>add</code> command to stage <code>file1.txt</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$ git add file1.txt

$ git status
On branch master
No commits yet
Changes to be committed:
&nbsp; &nbsp;(use "git rm --cached &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; new file: file1.txt
Untracked files:
&nbsp; (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to include in what will be committed)
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; file2.txt</code></pre>

<p>Notice that <code>file1.txt</code> is listed under <strong>Changes to be committed</strong> by Git. This indicates that Git is keeping note of any modifications made to this file in order to commit those modifications to the repository. Let's add <code>file2.txt</code> now:</p>

<pre><code>$ git add file2.txt


$ git status
...
Changes to be committed:
&nbsp; (use "git rm --cached &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; new file: file1.txt
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; new file: file2.txt</code></pre>

<p>You can instruct Git to monitor a file or directory using the <code>add</code> command or to stop tracking a file or directory with the <code>unstaging</code> command.</p>

<p>The git <code>rm</code> command is used to remove individual files or a set of files using the filename, as shown below. The <code>git rm --cached</code> command maintains a file in the working directory while removing it from the Git index.&nbsp;</p>

<pre><code>$ git rm --cached file1.txt
rm file1.txt

$ git status
…
Untracked files: (
&nbsp; use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to include in what will be committed)
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; file1.txt
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>file1.txt</code> file is no longer being tracked.</p>

<h2>Keeping track of untracked files</h2>

<p>We frequently need a quick way to tell Git to add everything that is untracked to the staging area. We can do this by using <code>*</code> or <code>.</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$ git add --all</code></pre>

<pre><code>$ git add .</code></pre>

<pre><code>$ git add *</code></pre>

<p>Stage all changes (new, changed, and deleted) files by using <code>--all</code> rather than specific filenames.</p>

<h2>Commits</h2>

<p>Git uses <strong>commits</strong> to make changes to files and directories permanent. In a sense, every commit represents a new version of our repository. Even while a commit can be seen to be a more permanent change, Git makes it simple to undo those changes, which is the strength of version control with Git.</p>

<p>For Git users, this alters the fundamental development model. Git developers have the option to build up commits in their local repo before making a change and committing it to the main repository. It accomplishes this by tracking the history of commits. Git's main purpose is to allow users to make commits. Everything we wanted to stage has already been done, so we can now make those modifications.&nbsp;<code>git commit</code> is used to do this.</p>

<p>When using the <code>git commit</code> command, we recommend always including two arguments: <code>-a</code> and <code>-m</code>.</p>

<h3>Stage all modified files: git commit -a</h3>

<p>Add all untracked files to the staging area with the <code>-a</code> or <code>--all</code>&nbsp;option. Note that only previously added files and folders are added using this method. Use the <code>add</code> command first if a file or directory has to be added that hasn't already been.</p>

<h3>Commit messages: git commit -m</h3>

<p>A commit message should always be included when making a commit. The <code>-m</code> or <code>--message</code> option is used for this. This message should be brief and descriptive, with just enough information included in the commit statement to summarize your actions since the last commit.</p>

<pre><code>$ git commit -am "my first git commit"</code></pre>

<h3>View change history: git log</h3>

<p>To view the history of changes that have been committed to a Git repository, use the <code>git log</code> command:</p>

<pre><code>$ git log</code></pre>

<p>In order to make our output easier to read and only to show the first seven characters of the commit ID, we'll also use the option <code>--oneline</code> command:</p>

<pre><code>$ git log -oneline</code></pre>

<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>

<pre>cf0p490 (HEAD -&gt; main) my first git commit</pre>

<p>In this example, the commit ID's first seven characters are <code>cf0p490</code>. There will be a lot of commits; thus each one needs to have its own identification. We can move the <code>HEAD</code> pointer around as necessary.</p>

<h2>Publishing changes: git push</h2>

<p>Finally, the <code>git push</code> command is used to upload content from a local repository to a remote repository. <strong>Pushing</strong> refers to the process of transferring commits from your local repository to a remote repository.</p>

<pre><code>$ git push</code></pre>

<p>Or:</p>

<pre><code>$ git push origin branchname</code></pre>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div b-gj8cwnhyng=""><p>Where C# is the most dominant language in the .NET world, other languages are built on top of the Framework that deserves their respective place. F# is strong when it comes down to functional programming! In this blog post, we will leverage the power of F# and C# to showcase where both excel!</p>
<h2 id="why-does-it-work">Why does it work?</h2>
<p>Before I go into the details of the code, I want to explain why this works. Why can we use F# code in C# and vice versa? The answer is simple: the .NET Framework is a runtime that can execute code written in different languages. The runtime is responsible for compiling the code to an intermediate language (IL) that the runtime can execute. If your code is dependent on other libraries, you are not relying on the source code but the IL code of that library. I already had a whole blog post about that: <a href="https://steven-giesel.com/blogPost/aa23a1c9-8ab2-4b05-9bd2-52624af7b684">"<em>What is the difference between C#, .NET, IL and JIT?</em>"</a>. Have a read here if you are interested in more details.</p>
<p><img src="https://linkdotnetblog.azureedge.net/blog/20220612_CSharpDotNetJit/Dotnet.webp" alt=".NET"></p>
<h2 id="f">F#</h2>
<p>Here is a very brief introduction: F# is a functional-first programming language in the .NET ecosystem. It is designed to provide the expressive power of functional programming alongside the robustness of object-oriented paradigms. It enjoys all of the benefits of the .NET Framework itself: open-source, platform-independent, and strongly typed.</p>
<pre><code>let rec factorial n =
    if n = 0 then 1 else n * factorial (n - 1)

printfn "Factorial of 5 is %d" (factorial 5)
</code></pre>
<p>F# also has some distinct features C# does not offer, the most prominent: <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/discriminated-unions">Discriminated unions</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-use-case">The use case</h2>
<p>I want to showcase where F# excels - and oftentimes, that can be the domain layer of your application. Especially then when you have a lot of calculations (basically where functional programming excels in the first place). Let's create a small domain project that is written in F# and see how it could look like in C#. I will create a "small online" shop that can take orders and calculate a discount (a percentage or a fixed amount). Before we go into F#, have a look at the C# code:</p>
<pre><code>
public class Product 
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public decimal Price { get; set; }
}

public class OrderLine 
{
    public Product Product { get; set; }
    public int Quantity { get; set; }
}

public enum DiscountType { Percentage, FixedAmount }

public class Discount 
{
    public DiscountType Type { get; set; }
    public decimal Value { get; set; }
}

public record Order(List&lt;OrderLine&gt; OrderLines, Discount Discount)
{
    public decimal CalculateTotalPrice() 
    {
        decimal subtotal = OrderLines.Sum(ol =&gt; ol.Product.Price * ol.Quantity);
        decimal totalDiscount = 0M;

        if (Discount != null) {
            totalDiscount = Discount.Type == DiscountType.Percentage 
                                ? subtotal * Discount.Value / 100M 
                                : Discount.Value;
        }

        return subtotal - totalDiscount;
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now for the sake of simplicity, I left out a lot of validation and error handling. I hope you get the idea anyway. Now let's see how this would look like in F#:</p>
<pre><code>type Product = { Name: string; Price: decimal }
type OrderLine = { Product: Product; Quantity: int }

type Discount = 
    | Percentage of float
    | FixedAmount of decimal

type Order(orderLines: OrderLine list, discount: Discount option) =
    member this.CalculateTotalPrice() =
        let subtotal = List.sumBy (fun ol -&gt; ol.Product.Price * (decimal ol.Quantity)) orderLines
        let totalDiscount =
            discount
            |&gt; Option.map (fun d -&gt; 
                match d with
                | Percentage p -&gt; subtotal * (decimal p / 100M)
                | FixedAmount f -&gt; f)
            |&gt; Option.defaultValue 0M
        subtotal - totalDiscount
</code></pre>
<p>Wow - that is really slim. Let's go through the code step by step. First, we have the <code>Product</code> and <code>OrderLine</code> types. They are just simple records that hold the data. Then we have the <code>Discount</code> type. This is a discriminated union that can either be a <code>Percentage</code> or a <code>FixedAmount</code>. The <code>Order</code> type class takes a list of <code>OrderLine</code> and an optional <code>Discount</code>. The <code>CalculateTotalPrice</code> method is the same as in the C# example. The only difference is that we use the <code>Option</code> type to handle the <code>null</code> case. The <code>Option</code> type is a discriminated union that can either be <code>Some</code> or <code>None</code>. We can use pattern matching to handle both cases. In this case we use the <code>Option.map</code> function to map the <code>Discount</code> to a <code>decimal</code> value. If the <code>Discount</code> is <code>None</code> we use the <code>Option.defaultValue</code> function to return <code>0M</code>.</p>
<p>Now we can easily integrate that to a controller:</p>
<pre><code>[ApiController]
[Route("api/orders")]
public class OrderController : ControllerBase
{
    private static readonly List&lt;Order&gt; Orders = new();

    [HttpPost]
    public ActionResult&lt;Order&gt; CreateOrder([FromBody] List&lt;OrderLine&gt; orderLines, [FromBody] Discount discount)
    {
        var fsharpOrderLines = ListModule.OfSeq(orderLines);
        var order = new Order(fsharpOrderLines, discount);
        Orders.Add(order);
        return CreatedAtAction(nameof(GetOrderById), new { id = Orders.Count - 1 }, order);
    }

    [HttpGet("{id:int}")]
    public ActionResult&lt;Order&gt; GetOrderById(int id)
    {
        if (id &lt; 0 || id &gt;= Orders.Count)
        {
            return NotFound();
        }

        return Orders[id];
    }

    [HttpGet("{id:int}/total")]
    public ActionResult&lt;decimal&gt; GetOrderTotalPrice(int id)
    {
        if (id &lt; 0 || id &gt;= Orders.Count)
        {
            return NotFound();
        }

        return Orders[id].CalculateTotalPrice();
    }

    [HttpGet]
    public ActionResult&lt;IEnumerable&lt;Order&gt;&gt; GetAllOrders()
    {
        return Orders;
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>There might be a very special line here that needs some clarification:</p>
<pre><code>var fsharpOrderLines = ListModule.OfSeq(orderLines);
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>ListModule.OfSeq</code> function is a helper function that converts a <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code> to a <code>seq&lt;T&gt;</code>. The <code>seq&lt;T&gt;</code> type is a sequence of elements. It is a lazy collection that is only evaluated when needed. This is a very powerful concept that is used a lot in F#. You can read more about it <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/sequences">here</a>. In this case we need to convert the <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code> to a <code>seq&lt;T&gt;</code> because the <code>Order</code> type expects a <code>seq&lt;T&gt;</code> as input.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I hope this blog post gave you a good overview of how you can use F# and C# together. It can be a very powerful tool, and F# has some unique strengths that can make your life easier!</p>

                    <p>It has been one and a half years since <a target="_blank" href="https://aeroxplorer.com/articles/ukrainian-civil-airspace-closed.php">the Russian invasion of Ukraine</a>. Since the onset of the war, many sanctions have been placed on Russia, including on the country's aviation industry. Many parts in (western made) Russian passenger aircraft that would normally be easily replaced are rapidly wearing out with no replacement parts in sight due to the import of spare aircraft parts from Boeing and Airbus being banned since March 2022.&nbsp;</p><p>Due to the aforementioned sanctions, Russian flag carrier Aeroflot is experiencing problems replacing worn-out brakes on "foreign" (non-Russian-made) aircraft.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.aeroxplorer.com/large/TEB-PMqbC8cGnKGcbaCJVqhy.jpg"><figcaption>Photo: A T | AeroXplorer</figcaption></figure><p><br>Due to Aeroflot's inability to replace worn-out brakes on its fleet, the airline has requested that its pilots turn off the brakes on affected aircraft. Currently, nine Aeroflot planes are flying with turned brakes: five Boeing 777-300ERs, one Airbus A330-300, one Airbus A320, and two Airbus A321s.&nbsp;</p><p>An aircraft can land without brakes, as during landing most of the work of stopping a commercial aircraft is done through the use of thrust reversers. However, landing without the aid of brakes will significantly increase the amount of runway an aircraft uses on landing. Brakes are also necessary for aborting takeoffs, through the use of Auto Brakes, which automatically activate should pilots decide to abort a takeoff for whatever reason.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite the airline requesting pilots turn off brakes on affected aircraft, mechanics and technicians in Aeroflot's flight operations department are actively warning pilots of the increased risk of runway overruns. When pilots land an affected Aeroflot aircraft (without brakes), "...The aircraft will tend to turn to the side...especially when landing on a wet runway with a side [side] wind..."&nbsp;</p><p>According to The Moscow Times, Russian Airlines are allowed to refuse the repair of aircraft brakes for up to 10 days, after which they must either be replaced or turned off, with a notification of the Federal Agency for Air Transport (FATA) required.&nbsp;</p><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.aeroxplorer.com/large/TEB-OkB9TGwo6uOx0i6j4tjr.jpg"><figcaption>Photo: AeroXplorer | Lukasz S.</figcaption></figure><br>&nbsp;<h2>Russian aviation is becoming progressively more dangerous.&nbsp;</h2><p>As of August 2022, there does not appear to be any end in sight to the seemingly endless Russia-Ukraine conflict and subsequent sanctions. Due to the scarce supply of aircraft parts, many Russian airlines, including Aeroflot, are cannibalizing their own aircraft for parts. Demand within the Russian passenger aviation industry is growing, and most of Russia's civilian aircraft fleet is comprised of foreign aircraft.&nbsp;</p><p>While Russia is attempting to increase its domestic aircraft production with aerospace companies by the likes of Irkut (Yakovlev), and Tupolev, this will happen gradually. So for now, the Russian aviation industry will remain in a dangerous position in which the risk of crashes will remain at a drastically high level, primarily due to sanctions.&nbsp;</p><h2>Aeroflot - One Of The Oldest Airlines In The World.&nbsp;</h2><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.aeroxplorer.com/large/XhqQl3aaA8ovFX8mfO2Z.jpg"><figcaption>Photo: AeroXplorer | Cody Newton</figcaption></figure><p>Founded in 1923, 100-year-old Aeroflot has a fleet of 172 aircraft, most all composed of Airbus and Boeing. Currently, just two aircraft in the airline's fleet are Russian-made - two Sukhoi SuperJet SSJ-100-95s. Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the airline has made an additional 389 aircraft orders with Russian plane-makers Sukhoi, Tupolev, and Irkut (Yakovlev) to make up for canceled aircraft orders with Airbus and Boeing.</p><p>Prior to 2022, the airline had over 200 routes, connecting cities within Russia and abroad. The airline also had numerous other routes in the form of codeshares through its SKYTEAM alliance membership, which was also suspended following the resumption of the Russia-Ukraine war.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="prompt-inj-attack" src="https://chainforge.ai/docs/prompt_injection_attack.png"></p>
<p>ChainForge is an open-source visual programming environment for prompt engineering, LLM evaluation and experimentation. With ChainForge, you can evaluate the robustness of prompts and text generation models with little to no coding required. Features include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Query multiple LLMs at once</strong> to test prompt ideas and variations quickly and effectively. Or query the same LLM at different settings.</li>
<li><strong>Compare response quality across prompt permutations, across models, and across model settings</strong> to choose the best prompt and model for your use case. </li>
<li><strong>Setup evaluation metrics</strong> with code or LLM-based scorers and automatically plot results across prompts, prompt parameters, models, or model settings.</li>
<li><strong>Hold multiple conversations at once across template parameters and chat models.</strong> Template chat messages and inspect and evaluate outputs at each turn of a chat conversation.</li>
</ul>
<p>ChainForge is in active development and is provided as an <a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/313422ed-cbd1-4b25-b51f-11e872cfb1f1">open beta test</a>.</p>

<p>David Zipper, who researches and writes about mobility and transportation, recently <a href="https://mastodon.social/@davidzipper/110843841107933007">did a big thread on Mastodon</a> (and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/davidzipper.bsky.social/post/3k4a4elm25e2p">Bluesky</a>) about car bloat: the way in which cars and trucks have gotten much bigger and heavier in the US over the past few decades and how it's bad for society. The whole thread is worth a read...here are a couple of Zipper's points:</p>

<blockquote><p>Tall vehicles have bigger blind spots and are more likely to strike a person's torso or head. Heavier vehicles exert more force crashing into a person, bicycle, or smaller car. They also have longer braking distances.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Heavier cars exert more pressure on tires, eroding them faster. Tire particles are absorbed into water, where they damage ecosystems. They also float through the air, harming human health when ingested.</p></blockquote>

<p>For further reading, Zipper links to a number of pieces he's written in recent months: <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90854942/the-blatant-greenwashing-of-suvs">The Blatant Greenwashing of SUVs</a>, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/07/electric-vehicles-tires-wearing-out-particulates/674750/">EVs Are Sending Toxic Tire Particles Into the Water, Soil, and Air</a>, <a href="https://slate.com/business/2023/06/electric-vehicles-auto-haulers-weight-capacity-roads.html">Carry That Weight</a>, and <a href="https://slate.com/business/2022/11/suv-size-truck-bloat-pedestrian-deaths.html">The Car Safety Feature That Kills the Other Guy</a>. Zipper's solution to these problems is government action: for example, <a href="https://slate.com/business/2023/01/electric-cars-hummer-ev-tax-fees-weight-joe-biden.html">taxing vehicles by weight</a>, testing vehicles for pedestrian and cyclist safety, or requiring drivers have commercial driver's licenses for larger vehicles.</p>

soft- and hardware.</p><p><img src="https://xnacly.me/linux/linux_kernel.webp" alt="kernel_hardware"></p><p>The <code>+-/Gnu</code> in the heading is a reference to the Linux kernel using GNU code and extensions, and therefore some people
think the Linux kernel should be named with the post-fix <code>/Gnu</code> or <code>+Gnu</code>.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p><p>Most people use Linux as a synopsis for everything included in a distribution, such as kernel, drivers, desktop
environment, window manager, shell, etc. even though Linux is just the name of the kernel. Everyone knows what you’re
talking about by just calling everything Linux.</p><blockquote><p><strong>View the current kernel version and build by running</strong></p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>1</span><span>$: uname -a

</span></span></code></pre></div></blockquote><h3 id="distribution">Distribution <a href="#distribution">###</a></h3><p>As hinted above a distribution is a package of software. Most Linux distribution contain the Kernel, some sort of
desktop environment, a window manager, multiple Apps such as a word processor and a Webbrowser.</p><p>Some Distros are known for their gigantic package repositories like <a href="https://www.debian.org/index.en.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Debian</a> and
<a href="https://arch/linux.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arch</a>, other are famous for their security like e.g.
<a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies//linux-platforms/enterprise-linux" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RedHat</a> or the discontinued
<a href="https://www.centos.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CentOS</a>. There are some distros which shine by being different or minimal, such as
<a href="https://nixos.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NixOS</a> (unconventional package managing), <a href="https://artix/linux.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Artix</a> (different init system)
or <a href="https://voidlinux.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Void Linux</a> (all the before + support for musl libc implementation)</p><p>No one really knows how many distros there
<a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b5//linux_Distribution_Timeline_21_10_2021.svg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are</a>, because everyone
can make one and switching between them is very easy.</p><h4 id="package-manager">Package manager <a href="#package-manager">####</a></h4><p>A package manager is a tool which installes, removes and updates software for you. No more going to a random website and
downloading an <code>*.exe</code> file only to have your hdd bricked after disabling the antivirus and running the totally
legitimate vbux generator. Package managers are accessed using the terminal, but some desktop environments include
graphical user interfaces for managing packages.</p><p>A package manager such as pacman is relatively secure due to package signing and other measures which were put in place
to save users from malicious software.</p><p>Almost all distributions contain a package manager, the most famous are: <code>apt</code>, <code>pacman</code> and <code>dnf</code>.</p><p>package manager cli examples:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span> 1</span><span><span># install a tool named neovim</span>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In this tutorial we will use <a href="https://manjaro.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Manjaro</a>, therefore you can focus on the package manager included in
the distribution: <code>pacman</code>.</p><h4 id="desktop-environment-de-vs-window-manager-wm">Desktop environment (DE) vs window manager (WM) <a href="#desktop-environment-de-vs-window-manager-wm">####</a></h4><p>A desktop environment such as <a href="https://www.gnome.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GNOME</a> bundles a file manager, terminal, window manager, settings
and more into the GNOME package. Everything in it is tightly integrated and applications in the bundle often look
similar and depend on the same libraries. A <code>de</code> handles almost everything the user interacts with inside the GUI, such
as volume management, connecting to networks, mounting drives, theming and other.</p><h3 id="which-distro-to-choose">Which distro to choose? <a href="#which-distro-to-choose">###</a></h3><p>I love pacman and getting new software updates fast, therefore i personally use Arch Linux, which can sometimes require
knowledge or some time to maintain. The distro we intend to use is based on arch Linux, but has a lot of preconfigured
software, making it interesting for beginners and advanced users.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Is Manjaro better than other distros?</strong></p><p>Manjaro is not superior or inferior to any other Linux distribution, they all do the same. Manjaro has its own package
manager, themes, tools and custom Kernels.</p></blockquote><p>The above was taken from the manjaro download page and i agree wholeheartedly with the first part. Roll a die and pick a
random distro, it won’t really matter.</p><h4 id="rolling-release-vs-stable-release-continuous-delivery">Rolling release vs Stable release (Continuous delivery) <a href="#rolling-release-vs-stable-release-continuous-delivery">####</a></h4><p>To always have the newest and shiniest software at hand, one could decide to pick a distro with a rolling release
circle<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, which can at best (or worst) have several updates available a day. Like everything else RR
distros have up- and downsides, you can read further about them <a href="https://itsfoss.com/rolling-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a></p><p>Releasing on a specified time frame is defined as a continuous delivery or stable releases. Distros following this
pattern have the convincing argument of stability and tested packages in their repos.</p><p>I personally never had stability issues on arch Linux and ppas annoy the shit out of me, therefore i use Arch :).</p><p>Relevant:</p><p><img src="https://xnacly.me/linux/arch.webp" alt="arch_meme"></p><h2 id="reasons-for-manjaro-linux">Reasons for Manjaro Linux <a href="#reasons-for-manjaro-linux">##</a></h2><p>As said before, in this tutorial we will be using Manjaro due to it:</p><ul><li>being based on arch<ul><li>having rolling release updates</li><li>having pacman and yay installed</li></ul></li><li>containing a fully configured system (yes bloat, idc its a beginners tutorial)</li><li>(ofc) being Linux</li></ul><h2 id="installing-a-distro">Installing a Distro <a href="#installing-a-distro">##</a></h2><blockquote><p>This section will explain how to install manjaro linux in a virtual machine in depth</p></blockquote><p>Before installing on real hardware i would recommend you to spin up a virtual machine and install Manjaro there. I will

					                    <!--?xml encoding="UTF-8" ?--><p>It’s important to us at Zoom to empower our customers with innovative and secure communication solutions. We’ve updated our <a href="https://explore.zoom.us/en/terms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">terms of service</a> (in section 10.4) to further confirm that we will not use audio, video, or chat customer content to train our artificial intelligence models without your consent.</p>



<p>As part of our commitment to transparency and user control, we are providing clarity on our approach to two essential aspects of our services: Zoom’s AI features and customer content sharing for product improvement purposes. Our goal is to enable Zoom account owners and administrators to have control over these features and decisions, and we’re here to shed light on how we do that and how that affects certain customer groups.</p>



<h2><strong>Recent<em> </em>terms<em> </em>of service changes&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>We strive to provide transparency about data ownership in our terms of service. These terms of service work together with our privacy statement and in-product privacy notices, which in turn aim to ensure that usage of customer content is based on your consent.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We changed our terms of service in March 2023 to be more transparent about how we use and who owns the various forms of content across our platform.&nbsp;</p>



<ol><li>In Section 10.1 (coupled with 10.6), our intention was to make clear that customers create and own their own video, audio, and chat content. We have permission to use this customer content to provide value-added services based on this content, but our customers continue to own and control their content. For example, a customer may have a webinar that they ask us to livestream on YouTube. Even if we use the customer video and audio content to livestream, they own the underlying content.</li><li>Section 10.2 covers that there is certain information about how our customers in the aggregate use our product — telemetry, diagnostic data, etc. This is commonly known as service generated data. We wanted to be transparent that we consider this to be our data so that we can use service generated data to make the user experience better for everyone on our platform. For example, it is helpful to know generally what time of day in a particular region we have heavy usage so we can better balance loads in our data centers and provide better video quality for all of our users.</li><li>In Section 10.4, our intention was to make sure that if we provided value-added services (such as a meeting recording), we would have the ability to do so without questions of usage rights. The meeting recording is still owned by the customer, and we have a license to that content in order to deliver the service of recording. An example of a machine learning service for which we need license and usage rights is our automated scanning of webinar invites / reminders to make sure that we aren’t unwittingly being used to spam or defraud participants. The customer owns the underlying webinar invite, and we are licensed to provide the service on top of that content.<strong>&nbsp; For AI, we do not use audio, video, or chat content for training our models without customer consent</strong>. </li></ol><h2>What this means for healthcare and education customers</h2>



<p>We will not use customer content, including education records or protected health information, to train our artificial intelligence models without your consent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We routinely enter into student data protection agreements with our education customers and legally required business associate agreements (BAA) with our healthcare customers. Our practices and handling of education records, pupil data, and protected healthcare data are controlled by these separate terms and applicable laws.</p>



<h2 id="h-generative-ai-features"><strong>Generative AI features</strong></h2>



<p>We recently introduced two powerful generative AI features – Zoom IQ Meeting Summary and Zoom IQ Team Chat Compose – on a <strong>free trial</strong> basis to enhance your Zoom experience. These features offer automated meeting summaries and AI-powered chat composition. <strong>Zoom account owners and administrators control whether to enable these AI features for their accounts.</strong></p>



<p>When you choose to enable Zoom IQ Meeting Summary or Zoom IQ Team Chat Compose, you will also be presented with a transparent consent process for training our AI models using your customer content. Your content is used solely to improve the performance and accuracy of these AI services. And even if you chose to share your data, it will not be used for training of any third-party models.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Account owners or administrators provide consent&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Here is an example of our UI through which a customer admin opts in to one of our new generative AI features.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We remain committed to transparency, and our aim is to provide you with the tools you need to make informed decisions about your Zoom account. We value your privacy and are continuously working to enhance our services while respecting your rights and preferences.</p>



<p>Thank you for being part of the Zoom community. Together, we’ll continue to create meaningful and seamless collaboration experiences through Zoom.</p>

The Linux kernel, on the other hand, began development in 1993 and was initially considered a “kludge” until the Hurd was completed. It is now matured and widely used.</p><p id="7e47">Like the Loch Ness Monster, many believe that GNU/Hurd is vaporware and does not exist. It <strong>does</strong> exist and continues to evolve, albeit at a slow pace. Just recently, the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/news/2023-06-11-debian_gnu_hurd_2023.html" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Debian GNU/Hurd 2023</a> has been released. You can use the GNU/Hurd right now.</p><h2 id="39db">GNU/Hurd? GNU Hurd? or Debian GNU/Hurd?</h2><p id="9e3e">There has been a well-known <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU/Linux_naming_controversy" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">ideological controversy</a> over the names GNU and Linux. Anywise, it would be helpful to sort out the word.</p><p id="0bce">GNU is the name of a Unix-compatible operating system (an acronym of “GNU is Not Unix”), and the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">GNU Project</a> is a project to create GNU. Hence, a flavor of GNU that adopted Linux as its kernel is GNU/Linux. There was also GNU/kFreeBSD, which adopted the FreeBSD kernel, although it has recently been <a href="https://blog.aurel32.net/goodbye-kfreebsd.html" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">discontinued</a>.</p><p id="d754">To simplify it further,</p><ul><li id="e957">Linux = kernel (the core of the operating system).</li><li id="2df7">GNU = so-called user land (the part of the operating system that is not the kernel and that deals with users, such as the GNU Core Utilities, the GNU tool chain such as GCC, etc.).</li></ul><p id="af1f">Unlike the Linux kernel, the Hurd is not a “kernel.” In a way,</p><ul><li id="798a">“Hurd” = GNU Mach (microkernel) + GNU Hurd (system servers) + <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/microkernel/mach/mig/gnu_mig.html" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">GNU MIG</a> (Mach Interface Generator)</li></ul><p id="a9b7">are roughly equivalent to a “kernel.” The GNU Hurd is a herd of servers that implements many functions, including user authentication, binary execution, the file system, networking, and even /dev/null as a server separate from the kernel. There are currently <a href="https://www.debian.org/ports/hurd/hurd-doc-server" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">24 servers</a> consisting of the Hurd.</p><figure><figcaption>Linux corresponds to the left, Hurd to the middle, from Wikipedia.</figcaption></figure><p id="1714">So, although slightly imprecise, GNU Hurd (without the slash) is the name of the group of user-mode servers, and GNU/Hurd is the name of the Unix-compatible operating system that uses the “Hurd” as its “kernel.” Therefore, a kind of GNU that adopted the Hurd is an operating system called GNU/Hurd.</p><p id="cfbe">There are already several distributions based on GNU/Hurd. The best known is <a href="https://www.debian.org/ports/hurd/index.en.html" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Debian GNU/Hurd</a>. I am using this one because I am a Debian developer and familiar with Debian. The <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/en/download/latest/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">GNU Guix system on the GNU Hurd</a> is another interesting one.</p><h2 id="6f7d">Running Debian GNU/Hurd in the cloud</h2><p id="e39d">The GNU Hurd’s hardware support is poor, so trying to run it on modern physical machines is suicide. In the cloud, however, “virtual” devices are standardized. There is no need to support various devices as in the real world.</p><p id="43d4">However, <a href="https://wiki.libvirt.org/Virtio.html" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">virtio</a> still needs to be supported by the current GNU/Hurd. So we have to get creative. Having a cloud provider based on <a href="https://www.openstack.org/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">OpenStack</a> would be nice, since we have to tweak the image parameters directly using command line tools. I use <a href="https://fuga.cloud/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Fuga Cloud</a>.</p><p id="212c">First, download and deploy the image.</p><pre><span id="a5ed">$ wget http://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/ports/12.0/hurd-i386/debian-hurd.img.tar.xz<br>$ tar xJf debian-hurd.img.tar.xz</span></pre><p id="e359">This is a 5GB pre-installed image, consisting of 4GB of user space and 1GB of swap space. This should be enough for now, since GNU/Hurd is a tiny OS compared to Linux.</p><p id="7cdf">The next thing you need is an OpenStack command-line tool. For Debian or Ubuntu, for example, there is a <a href="https://packages.debian.org/bookworm/python3-openstackclient" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">python3-openstackclient</a> package. I have no experience with it, but it seems to be available for Windows as well. Then you have to do some setup. Fuga Cloud’s OpenStack CLI tutorials (<a href="https://docs.fuga.cloud/how-to-use-the-openstack-cli-tools-on-linux" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">for Linux</a>, f<a href="https://docs.fuga.cloud/how-to-use-the-openstack-cli-tools-on-windows" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">or Windows</a>) are useful even if you don’t use them.</p><p id="dd47">Now you need to upload the image to the cloud. You need to set the properties: “hw_disk_bus” to “ide” and “hw_vif_model” to “e1000” (or “rtl8139”) as these are only supported devices on GNU/Hurd. Also, uploading may take some time. A progress bar ( — progress) would be nice.</p><pre><span id="57c1">$ openstack image create --property hw_disk_bus=ide --property hw_cdrom_bus=ide --property hw_vif_model=e1000 --disk-format raw --container-format bare "Debian GNU/Hurd 2023" --file debian-hurd.img --progress</span></pre><p id="7af4">After that, you can use the OpenStack web interface to create an instance based on the custom image you just uploaded. I am using one of Fuga Cloud’s cheapest plans (“t2.small”: 1 CPU, 1.23 GB RAM, 20 GiB SSD), but it seems to be enough.</p><p id="dd52">After booting (via GRUB), open the console for now from OpenStack and log in as “root” (the password is empty, so simply hit Enter). After that, you can immediately create your own user account.</p><pre><span id="a26e"># adduser yourloginname</span></pre><figure><figcaption>A gnu will welcome you.</figcaption></figure><p id="c8dd">This image is prepared to configure the network with DHCP, so you should already be able to log in with SSH (using your user account’s login password) once the instance is booted. Then, you put your SSH public key in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys, and you can SSH login as usual.</p><p id="496e">Everything else can be handled similarly to Debian GNU/Linux, because it is Debian after all. If you are using it as a server that is open to the outside world, don’t forget to set the root password.</p><h2 id="c90b">Why GNU/Hurd?</h2><p id="f7bf">GNU/Hurd has a number of interesting features. The most famous of these is probably the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/hurd/translator.html" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">translator</a>. The translator allows users to create local implementations of the programs that handle access to specific directories and files. It is like a supercharged version of mount. It implements symbolic links, sockets, etc. The translator provides extreme flexibility.</p><p id="f34d">It is possible to run multiple instances of the Hurd on a single instance of GNU Mach, the microkernel. It’s called <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/hurd/neighborhurd.html" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">neighborhurd</a>. Each neighborhurd is essentially isolated, so it’s like a supercharged Docker. There is also <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/hurd/subhurd.html" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">subhurd</a>, which uses some of the resources provided by another Hurd.</p><p id="f0df">Personally, one reason for using GNU/Hurd is that the Linux kernel has become too huge. Look at this:</p><figure><figcaption>Source Lines of Code Comparison. Measured by David A Wheeler’s <a href="https://dwheeler.com/sloccount/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">SLOCCount</a>.</figcaption></figure><p id="1f5c">I don’t think that anyone is able to grasp the full picture of Linux anymore. It was also said that the Hurd would never be finished because it was too complex and too large. That is no longer the case. <strong>GNU/Hurd is a relatively small OS!</strong> Maybe the development of the microkernel and the Hurd required the development of Linux and the development of virtualization after all.</p><p id="83ac">Also, there are a variety of interesting budding operating systems, but they are largely experimental and often not practically usable; the GNU/Hurd is Unix(POSIX)-compatible, so most things work (roughly 65% of the Debian archive can be built for the Hurd).</p><h2 id="fdfe">Challenges</h2><p id="852e">One big problem would be systemd. systemd has not yet (or forever) been ported to the Hurd. systemd is very popular in the Linux world these days, and there are many packages that depend on systemd. <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/shepherd/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">GNU shepherd</a> is promising, but not yet complete.</p><p id="0922">As mentioned above, hardware support for GNU/Hurd is poor, but it is hard to rewrite device drivers from scratch now. <a href="https://rumpkernel.github.io/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Rump Kernels</a> is an interesting solution and is being actively implemented (<a href="https://archive.fosdem.org/2022/schedule/event/dzammit/attachments/slides/4850/export/events/attachments/dzammit/slides/4850/rump_hurd_talk.pdf" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">a nice recent FOSDEM presentation PDF</a>).</p><p id="2ee0">And, of course, there are a whole lot of <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/open_issues.html" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">open issues</a>.</p><h2 id="153c">Conclusion</h2><p id="e992"><strong>Try GNU/Hurd</strong>! I enjoy it a lot. It’s an old world and a new world. I am pretty sure you will like it too.</p><h2 id="b9a0"><strong>Further Resources</strong></h2><ul><li id="9dd8"><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">The Official site of GNU Hurd</a></li><li id="e032"><a href="https://www.debian.org/ports/hurd/index.en.html" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">The Official site of Debian GNU/Hurd</a></li><li id="0938"><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/mailing_lists.html" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Mailing Lists and its archives</a></li><li id="c81e"><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/irc.html" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">IRC</a> (Looks like this is still the official communication channel in 2023…)</li></ul><h2 id="11ea">The Source Code of the Hurd</h2><p id="6f7e">They are all managed by Git.</p><ul><li id="fdb1"><a href="https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/hurd/gnumach.git" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">GNU Mach</a></li><li id="a567"><a href="https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/hurd/hurd.git/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">GNU Hurd</a></li><li id="24c9"><a href="https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/hurd/mig.git/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">GNU MIG</a></li></ul></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><h2>TL;DR</h2><p>WarpStream is a Kafka protocol compatible data streaming platform built directly on top of S3. It's delivered as a single, stateless Go binary so there are no local disks to manage, no brokers to rebalance, and no ZooKeeper to operate. WarpStream is 5-10x cheaper than Kafka in the cloud because data streams directly to and from S3 instead of using inter-zone networking, which can be over 80% of the infrastructure cost of a Kafka deployment at scale.</p><p>If you just want to get your hands dirty, you can try <a href="https://docs.warpstream.com/warpstream/tutorials/demo" target="_blank">our demo</a> in under 30s.</p><p>Otherwise, read on!</p><h2>Kafka is Dead, Long Live Kafka</h2><p>Chances are you probably had a strong reaction to the title of this post. In our experience, Kafka is one of the most polarizing technologies in the data space. Some people hate it, some people swear by it, but almost every technology company uses it.</p><p>Kafka was first open sourced in 2011, and quickly became the default infrastructure for building streaming architectures. Jay Kreps' now well-known <a href="https://engineering.linkedin.com/distributed-systems/log-what-every-software-engineer-should-know-about-real-time-datas-unifying" target="_blank">The Log</a> blog post is still one of my favorite blog posts ever because it walks through why the distributed log abstraction that Kafka provides is so powerful.</p><p>But it’s not 2011 anymore. A lot has changed about how we build modern software, primarily a major shift towards cloud environments, and yet Kafka has remained more or the less the same. Many organizations have managed to “lift and shift” Kafka into their cloud environments, but let’s be honest, nobody is really happy with the result. Kafka is expensive, finicky, and difficult to run for most organizations who use it.</p><p>Kafka <em>itself</em> is not the problem. It’s a great piece of software that was well suited for the environment it was created for: LinkedIn’s data centers in 2011. However, it is an unusually poor fit for modern workloads for two reasons:</p><ol role="list"><li>Cloud economics – by design, Kafka’s replication strategy will rack up massive inter AZ bandwidth costs.</li><li>Operational overhead – running your own Kafka cluster literally requires a dedicated team and sophisticated custom tooling.</li></ol><p>We're going to pick on Kafka for the rest of this post, but keep in mind that everything we're saying about Kafka applies equally to any similar system that stores data on locals disks (however briefly), regardless of which programming language its implemented in.</p><h2>Kafka-nomics</h2><p>The diagram below depicts a typical 3 availability zone Kafka cluster:&nbsp;</p><figure><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/64baaecd9c5c9b1b6c38aa0e/64c00427b989db231aac3e45_kafka_arch.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Every GiB of data that is produced must be written cross zone 2/3rds of the time<sup>1</sup>, and subsequently replicated by the partition leader to the followers in the other two zones for durability and availability reasons. Every time a GiB of data is transferred across zones, it costs $0.02<sup>2</sup>, $0.01 for egress in the source zone and $0.01 for ingress in the destination zone.</p><p>$0.01*⅔ + $0.02 *2 == $0.053 for every GiB of data that you stream through your Kafka cluster <em>in the best case scenario<sup>3</sup></em>. The cost of storing a GiB of data in S3 <em>for a month</em> is only $0.021<sup>4</sup>, so for the same price as copying data from a producer to a consumer via Kafka, you could store that data in S3 <em>for over two months</em>. In practice, for any Kafka cluster with substantial throughput, the hardware costs are negligible since 70-90% of the cost of the workload is just inter-zone bandwidth fees. <a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/understanding-and-optimizing-your-kafka-costs-part-1-infrastructure/#networking" target="_blank">Confluent has a good write up about this problem as well</a>.</p><p>It’s important to stress that this inter-AZ bandwidth problem is fundamental to how Kafka works. Kafka was designed to run in LinkedIn’s data centers, where the network engineers didn’t charge their application developers for moving data around. But today, most Kafka users are running it on a public cloud, an environment with completely different constraints and cost models. Unfortunately, unless your organization can commit to 10s or 100s of millions of dollars per year in cloud spend, there is no escaping the physics of this problem.</p><p>It’s not just a question of throughput either, even a low throughput Kafka cluster with long retention can have large storage requirements. In this case, Kafka’s approach of triply replicating the data on expensive local SSDs costs roughly 10-20x more<sup>5</sup> per GiB than using object storage like S3 assuming the <em>best case scenario of 100% disk utilization.</em></p><h2>Accidental SRE</h2><p>Most developers first encounter Kafka because they have a real problem they want to solve. However, before they can begin solving their problems, they must first learn about:</p><ol role="list"><li>Kafka (brokers, coordinators, watermarks, etc)</li><li>ZooKeeper (or KRaft)</li><li>Leader elections</li><li>Partitions (how many partitions do I need? Unclear, but better get it right because you can never change it!)</li><li>Consumer groups</li><li>Rebalancing</li><li>Broker tuning</li><li>Client tuning</li><li>etc</li></ol><p>Kafka’s “data plane” (brokers) and consensus-based “control plane” (controllers, ZooKeeper, etc) all run directly on local SSDs that must be managed with expertise and care. In practice, self-hosted Kafka clusters require a dedicated team of experts and significant amounts of custom tooling before even basic operations like node replacements and scaling clusters can be performed safely and reliably. For example, the Apache Kafka built in partition reassignment tool cannot even generate plans for decommissioning brokers when you (inevitably) experience a hardware failure:</p><blockquote>The partition reassignment tool does not have the ability to automatically generate a reassignment plan for decommissioning brokers yet. As such, the admin has to come up with a reassignment plan to move the replica for all partitions hosted on the broker to be decommissioned, to the rest of the brokers. This can be relatively tedious as the reassignment needs to ensure that all the replicas are not moved from the decommissioned broker to only one other broker.</blockquote><p>In many cases, offloading cluster management to a hosted provider like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/msk/" target="_blank">AWS MSK</a> doesn’t even solve the operational burden problem. For example, the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/msk/latest/developerguide/bestpractices.html#bestpractices-balance-cluster" target="_blank">MSK documentation on how to rebalance a cluster</a> (a very routine operation) just links to the <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#basic_ops_cluster_expansion" target="_blank">Apache Kafka documentation</a> which involves hand-editing JSON to specify which partitions should be migrated to which brokers and includes helpful commentary like:</p><blockquote>The partition reassignment tool does not have the capability to automatically study the data distribution in a Kafka cluster and move partitions around to attain an even load distribution. As such, the admin has to figure out which topics or partitions should be moved around.</blockquote><p>There are open source solutions like <a href="https://github.com/linkedin/cruise-control" target="_blank">Cruise Control</a> that can help ease this burden, but that is yet another set of concepts that need to learned, services that need to deployed and monitored, and sharp edges that need to be encountered. Cruise Control itself is a JVM&nbsp;application that depends on both Apache Kafka and ZooKeeper. Hardly a lightweight solution.</p><p>Unfortunately, in many cases developers set out to solve a business problem, and end up becoming Kafka SREs instead.</p><h2>S3 Is All You Need</h2><p>The high costs of using Kafka (both in dollars and engineering hours) means that today businesses can only afford to use it for their most high value use-cases like fraud detection and CDC. The cost of entry is simply too high for anything else.</p><p>When we were at Datadog, we built <a href="https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/engineering/introducing-husky/" target="_blank">Husky, a columnar database purpose-built for observability data that ran directly on top of S3.</a> When we were done, we had a (mostly) stateless and auto scaling data lake that was extremely cost effective, never ran out of disk space, and was trivial to operate. Almost overnight our Kafka clusters suddenly looked <em>ancient</em> by comparison.</p><p>Kafka bandwidth volumes at Datadog were measured in double-digit GiB/s and broker storage was measured in PiB’s of NVMEs<sup>6</sup>. Maintaining this level of infrastructure using open source Kafka, custom tooling, and bare VMs was no small feat. Luckily the responsible engineering teams at Datadog were extremely capable and made it work, but even after many years of investment, the automation simply couldn’t compete with the millions of engineering hours that have gone into making systems like S3 extremely robust, scalable, cost effective, <em>and elastic</em>.</p><p>In general, large storage workloads running in cloud environments stand no chance of competing with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc3J4McebHE" target="_blank">economics, reliability, scalability, and elasticity of object storage</a>. This is why “big data” technologies like Snowflake and Databricks don’t even try. Instead, they <em>lean into</em> cloud economics by designing their systems from the ground up around commodity object storage.</p><p>Companies like Uber, Datadog, and many others have made Kafka work for them despite all of its flaws. But there are <em>so many </em>interesting problems that will never get solved if the existing Kafka implementation remains the barrier to entry. That’s why we care about this space, and that’s why we set out to build something that would make data streaming infrastructure as accessible as S3.</p><p>If we could build a Kafka-like system directly on top of S3, that would solve two of the major problems with Kafka in one fell swoop; costs would be massively reduced, and most traditional Kafka operational headaches would disappear overnight. No major cloud provider charges for networking costs between VMs and object storage, and AWS employs literally <em>hundreds</em> of engineers whose only job is to make sure that S3 runs reliably and scales infinitely, so you don’t have to.</p><p>Of course, that’s easier said than done, and there is a good reason no one has done it yet: figuring out how to build low latency streaming infrastructure on-top of a high latency storage medium like S3, while still providing the full semantics of the Kafka protocol, without introducing <em>any</em> local disks, is a very tricky problem!</p><p>So we asked ourselves: “What would Kafka look like if it was redesigned from the ground up <em>today</em> to run in modern cloud environments, directly on top of object storage, with no local disks to manage, but still had to support the existing Kafka protocol?”</p><p>WarpStream is our answer to that question.</p><h2>Introducing WarpStream</h2><p>WarpStream is a Kafka protocol compatible data streaming platform that runs directly on top of any commodity object store (AWS&nbsp;S3, GCP&nbsp;GCS, Azure Blob Storage, etc). It incurs zero inter-AZ bandwidth costs, has no local disks to manage, and can run completely within your VPC.</p><p>That’s a lot to digest, so let’s unpack it by comparing WarpStream’s architecture to Kafka’s:</p><figure><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/64baaecd9c5c9b1b6c38aa0e/64cea23a28ed31049a11cfbf_with1%20(1).png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Instead of Kafka brokers, WarpStream has “Agents”. Agents are stateless Go binaries (no JVM!) that speak the Kafka protocol, but unlike a traditional Kafka broker, any WarpStream Agent can act as the “leader” for any topic, commit offsets for any consumer group, or act as the coordinator for the cluster. No Agent is special, so auto-scaling them based on CPU-usage or network bandwidth is trivial.</p><p>How did we accomplish this if Apache Kafka requires running Apache ZooKeeper (or KRaft) and a bunch of stateful brokers with local SSDs and replication?</p><ol role="list"><li>We separated storage and compute (by offloading data to S3)</li><li>We separated data from metadata (by offloading metadata to a custom metadata store)</li></ol><p>Offloading all storage to object storage like S3 allows users to trivially scale the number of WarpStream Agents in response to changes in load with <em>zero data rebalancing</em>. It also enables faster recovery from failures because any request can be retried on another Agent immediately. It also mostly eliminates hotspots, where some Kafka brokers would have dramatically higher load than others due to uneven amounts of data in each partition. That means you can say goodbye to manually rebalancing partitions, and don't need to learn about complex solutions like Cruise Control.</p><p>The other pillar of WarpStream's design is separating data from metadata, just like a modern data lake does. We store the metadata for every WarpStream “Virtual Cluster” in a custom metadata database that was written from the ground up to solve this exact problem in the most performant and cost effective way possible. In fact, we’re so confident in the efficiency of our metadata store, we’ll host WarpStream Virtual Clusters for you <a href="https://warpstream.com/pricing"><em>for free</em></a>.</p><p>You can read more about <a href="https://docs.warpstream.com/warpstream/background-information/warpstreams-architecture" target="_blank">WarpStream’s architecture in our documentation</a>, but to summarize: WarpStream offloads all of the hard problems of data replication, durability, and availability to an object storage bucket so you never have to think about it, but all of your data <em>stays inside your cloud account</em>. The only data that ever leaves your cloud account with WarpStream is the workload <em>metadata</em> that is required for consensus, like the order of the batches in your partitions.</p><p>Modern practitioners who want to introduce large scale data streaming pipelines into their infrastructure today don’t have many good choices. They either have to spend a lot of money <em>and</em> create an entire dedicated team of engineers whose only job is to operate Kafka, or they have to pay a vendor for a hosted solution and spend <em>even more money</em>, making many of their streaming use-cases economically infeasible.</p><p>We think WarpStream can provide a better option that leverages the cloud as a strength instead of a weakness, and unlocks a whole new set of possibilities in the data streaming world.</p><p>You don’t just have to take our word for it though, we brought receipts! The image below shows the interzone networking costs of our entire cloud account (measured using the excellent <a href="https://www.vantage.sh/" target="_blank">vantage.sh</a>), including the continuous streaming workload we run in our test environment. This workload continuously produces 140MiB/s of data and consumes it with three dedicated consumers for a total of 560MiB/s in continuous data transfer.</p><figure><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/64baaecd9c5c9b1b6c38aa0e/64c035b364da3c257915926f_Screenshot%202023-07-25%20at%203.49.10%20PM.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>You can see that we average &lt; $15/day in interzone networking fees, whereas the exact same workload run using a Kafka cluster would cost 0.14GiB * $0.053/GiB * 60 * 60 * 24 == <strong>$641</strong> <strong>per day</strong> <strong>in interzone networking fees alone.</strong></p><p>We didn’t just replace these interzone networking costs with hardware or S3 API costs either. This same workload costs &lt; $40/day in S3 API operation costs:</p><figure><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/64baaecd9c5c9b1b6c38aa0e/64c035bcfda4aa35de9d76ef_Screenshot%202023-07-25%20at%203.50.11%20PM.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>It also only requires 27 vCPUs worth of Agent hardware / VMs.</p><p>In terms of total cost of ownership, WarpStream will reduce the cost of most Kafka workloads by 5-10x. For example, here is a comparison of the cost of running a sustained 1GiB/s Kafka workload vs the equivalent using WarpStream:</p><figure><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/64baaecd9c5c9b1b6c38aa0e/64d060d06b645b27d6a23140_Screenshot%202023-08-06%20at%2010.10.56%20PM.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Footnote 7 for self hosted Kafka hardware costs, footnote 8 for self hosted Kafka network costs.<strong> Note that this table assumes the best case scenario that the Kafka cluster is properly configured to use the follower fetch functionality to reduce interzone networking costs for consumers. If it’s not, the Kafka costs would be much higher.&nbsp;It also omits the cost of engineering salaries for the self hosted Kafka setup.</strong></figcaption></figure><p>The table above demonstrates clearly that for high volume Kafka workloads, the hardware costs are negligible because the cost of the workload is dominated by inter-zone networking fees. WarpStream eliminates those networking fees entirely.</p><p>Of course, it's not all sunshine and rainbows. Engineering is about trade-offs, and we’ve made a significant one with WarpStream: latency. The current implementation has a P99 of ~400ms for Produce requests because we never acknowledge data until it has been durably persisted in S3 and committed to our cloud control plane. In addition, our current P99 latency of data end-to-end from producer-to-consumer is around 1s:</p><figure><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/64baaecd9c5c9b1b6c38aa0e/64bff6c3e52acac923301fa7_CaSz12FWNfCOGHT2snOa6q1erJeqvhESfRx_X6ZHt-Fe81JVVgRlXk9wvSamfMnzG5Epjwl5VARA176g8k-kmAGiTancoQOoBT1iDZJgjKXceXv-XFKsnEn2ncDGM4rjeCja_JriSlDDn7LQ9B8vh5o.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>If your workload can tolerate a P99 of ~1s of producer-to-consumer latency, then WarpStream can reduce your total data streaming costs by 5-10x per GiB, with <em>almost</em> zero operational overhead. We don’t have a proprietary interface either; it’s just Kafka, so there is no vendor lock in. Finally, WarpStream runs in any environment with an object store implementation, so we can meet you where you’re at with S3 in AWS, GCS in GCP, and Azure Blob Storage in Azure.</p><p>If you’ve made it this far, you may have noticed that WarpStream mainly addresses two of the major problems with Kafka: cloud economics and operational overhead. We think that there is a third major problem with Kafka: developer UX. In our view, partitions are way too low level of an abstraction to program against for writing any non-trivial stream processing application, and we think that WarpStream’s architecture puts us in a unique position to help developers write stream processing applications in a novel way that’s much closer to how they’re used to writing traditional applications.</p><p>We’ll talk about that more in a future blog post, but the first thing we wanted to do is meet developers where they are and offer them an improved version of a tool they’re already familiar with.</p><p>WarpStream is currently in developer preview. That means you can <a href="https://console.warpstream.com/signup" target="_blank">sign up</a> in a completely self-serve manner, and <a href="https://docs.warpstream.com/warpstream/" target="_blank">follow our documentation</a> to start playing around with it.

<p><strong>NAIROBI, Kenya, Aug 7 – Police raided a warehouse belonging to WorldCoin cryptocurrency in Nairobi and carted away documents over the weekend.</strong>



</p><p>The officers went to the offices along Mombasa Road armed with a search warrant and left with machines they believe stores data gathered by the firm.



</p><p>The team took the data to the Directorate of Criminal Investigations headquarters for analysis.



</p><p>Data Commissioner Immaculate Kassait defended her office and said Tools for Humanity, the parent company of Worldcoin, failed to disclose its true intentions during registration.



</p><p>The government has suspended Worldcoin’s operations in Kenya, citing security concerns paving the way for investigations into the activities of the company.



</p><p>However, privacy experts worry that sensitive data gathered from scanning a person’s iris might get into the wrong hands.



</p><p>The Kenyan Capital Markets Authority (CMA) stated it was concerned about the ongoing registration and notified Kenyans that Worldcoin was not regulated in Kenya.



</p><p>Under Kenyan law, individuals have a right to not have any personal information unnecessarily required or unnecessarily revealed.



</p><p>Worldcoin, founded by US tech entrepreneur Sam Altman, offers free crypto tokens to people who agree to have their eyeballs scanned.</p>



<p>&nbsp;On Thursday, Worldcoin said it is planning to implement crowd-control measures and collaborate with the government before resuming work.



</p><p>Worldcoin, founded by US tech entrepreneur Sam Altman, offers free crypto tokens to people who agree to have their eyeballs scanned.



</p><p>It claims to be creating a new global “identity and financial network”.



</p><p>Altman, who founded Open AI, which built chat bot ChatGPT, says he hopes the initiative will help confirm if someone is a human or a robot. He also says this could lead to everyone being paid a universal basic income but it is not clear how.



</p><p>Worldcoin says it chose Kenya as the first African country to launch the platform because of the already booming tech space, and the more than four million Kenyans who are already trading in crypto.



</p><p>It has also launched in various countries including Indonesia, France Japan, Germany, Spain and the UK. Data watchdogs in some countries have already said they are examining Worldcoin.



</p><p>Interior Cabinet Secretary Kithure Kindiki suspended the firm’s activities in Kenya to pave the way for a probe into the legality of its operations.



</p><p>He Thursday appeared before Parliament to among other issues state the precautionary steps taken by the government on the already mined data.



</p><p>“The aforesaid entity is not registered as a legal entity in Kenya.”</p>
