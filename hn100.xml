<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TJR5IA4CTVBITP7DYVJBKCW3UY" data-el="text" dir="null">SAN FRANCISCO — The tech industry has long prided itself on its many immigrant founders, executives and software programmers. Now, fears are growing among foreign tech workers that their lives and careers may be upended by the Trump administration’s more stringent immigration policies.</p><p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BOVRXTX4JJAEZDYFMQVWLCWY3Y" data-el="text" dir="null">Tech companies are telling employees on visas not to leave the United States out of concern they might not be allowed back in. Law firms are warning that denial rates for high-skilled visas could<b> </b>rise, as they did during President Donald Trump’s first term. And the administration’s efforts to end automatic citizenship for those born<b> </b>in the U.S. is making immigrant tech workers fear that their future children could be stateless.</p></div><p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2JIXTLYKNFEJFBLLH6J7KOHP6A" data-el="text" dir="null">In recent weeks, the government has also <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/03/09/columbia-arrest-mahmoud-khalil/" target="_blank">revoked visas and green cards</a> of people it accuses of sympathizing with Hamas and Hezbollah, adding to the uncertainty for people who until now thought following immigration rules and being employed in high-tech industries meant they could confidently build lives in America.</p><p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WZXUSQONGZEWFLIMTGJEBETJEA" data-el="text" dir="null">“What we’re seeing right now is just a lot of worry and panic,” said Malcolm Goeschl, principal attorney for Goeschl Law, a San Francisco-based firm focused on business immigration that serves clients in the tech industry. “It seems like [the administration is] just getting more and more momentum, and we don’t know what’s around the corner.”</p><p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NHJRXMMRIJGNJN5B5NGAUEQGPQ" data-el="text" dir="null">The uncertainty and fear are rattling Silicon Valley’s immigrant tech community, long viewed as one of the key pillars of success in producing innovative technology and boosting U.S. competitiveness. A 2018 study from the National Foundation for American Policy, a think tank focused on trade and immigration, found that more than half of U.S. start-ups valued at more than $1 billion had an immigrant founder or co-founder. The CEOs of Microsoft, Google, Uber and chip giant Nvidia are all immigrants. Experts say cutting the visas for immigrant tech workers could damage the industry’s ability to compete with China in the global race to develop sophisticated technology such as artificial intelligence.</p><p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5SHWZAUX7RBSXKX4Q3RC5AF77U" data-el="text" dir="null">“That’s just the beauty of our tech ecosystem — that you can hire the best and brightest from anywhere,” said Divyansh Kaushik, a vice president at think tank Beacon Global Strategies who advises tech companies on geopolitical risks.</p><p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ITUHI6OVYRE27MA4UHPYSINULM" data-el="text" dir="null">Silicon Valley tech giants employ thousands of workers on H1B visas, the visa category at the center of the debate. About 65,000 visas are approved each year via a lottery system, with people coming from India having the highest number of approvals, followed by China and Canada, according to data from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Among Big Tech companies, Amazon had the highest number of H1B visas approved, followed by Google, Meta, Microsoft and Apple. Tesla, whose CEO Elon Musk has been leading Trump’s efforts to cut the federal government, had 1,767 approved H1Bs in the fiscal year ending in September 2024.</p><p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="Y2UD3HDX35AYHMQJE4I3NWPRGI" data-el="text" dir="null">Spokespeople for Meta, Google, Microsoft and Amazon declined to comment. Apple did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5JEHXPJQIJCB5N6LOT5CTKAIFY" data-el="text" dir="null">The H1B visa can be used by a wide range of workers with specialized skill sets. Many Americans associate the visa with IT outsourcing firms that use it to bring workers from India and China at a cheaper cost than paying U.S. workers.</p><p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7S5O722KOJFNPI7EEPB34IZIRI" data-el="text" dir="null">IT outsourcing companies such as Infosys and Cognizant account for a large portion of H1B applications, but Big Tech companies are among the top 10 biggest employers of H1B holders as well. In Silicon Valley, the visa is generally seen as a key tool for filling the relentless demand for top engineering talent, with H1B workers sometimes considered less likely to switch jobs because transferring the visa from one employer to another requires approval from the government.</p><p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WJ5TBRHPLBFARCML3JX7Z4SEMI" data-el="text" dir="null">H1B visas have opened up a rift inside Trump’s coalition, between tech leaders whose companies employ immigrants and others who want to slow immigration to the U.S. That rift erupted in December when the two sides argued on X over whether Trump <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/12/27/h-1b-visas-elon-musk-trump-immigration/" target="_blank">should boost or suppress</a> skilled immigration.</p><p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WGYW7THFT5GGNAFWRWZWXUQ7QU" data-el="text" dir="null">“The number of people who are super talented engineers AND super motivated in the USA is far too low,” Musk wrote on X on Christmas. “If you want your TEAM to win the championship, you need to recruit top talent wherever they may be.” Some Republicans, including former presidential hopeful Nikki Haley, pushed back, saying the country should invest in U.S. education to train more American-born tech workers.</p><p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="A5PZLKSZIVEVJEDVUX23RYZZHU" data-el="text" dir="null">Trump hasn’t said he will end the H1B program or other skilled visas. Though he said he wanted to end the program during his first term, the president has recently spoken positively about H1Bs.</p><p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IERRP6O5RBG5RBNLWNVXWVGYOU" data-el="text" dir="null">Several of the White House’s top advisers on tech are immigrants, including AI and crypto czar David Sacks, who moved from South Africa as a child, and White House AI policy adviser Sriram Krishnan, a former Twitter executive who immigrated from India after completing his undergraduate degree. Musk immigrated also, from South Africa, via Canada, in his 20s.</p><p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LJ3Y5FYK4FGZHGPOC5XMTDHZIU" data-el="text" dir="null">Still, the unpredictability is already leading major immigration law firms to warn about the risk of sudden changes to visa rules, the potential for processing times to slow, and increased scrutiny of applicants’ political views and social media activity.</p><p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7UI5O6LE5ZFJJHX5LBZMTIQQ3Q" data-el="text" dir="null">“In the past Trump administration, the statistics show that it was less nice to skilled immigration despite everything they said,” said Deedy Das, an investor at venture capital firm Menlo Ventures. He said he’s concerned that legitimate criticisms of the H1B program — such as the fact that some IT consulting firms have been accused of visa fraud — could lead to the government scrapping the entire program.</p><p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FLWP6ZBIK5DZFFVDZ2IMA3IUBI" data-el="text" dir="null">A spokesperson for the White House did not provide a comment.</p><p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VMXV7NYBWZG5PE66ZYEW2OQYPA" data-el="text" dir="null">Concerns about Trump’s impact on immigrant tech workers were growing even before he took office.</p><p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7NA4FIO6XNBGNJHBFDF462W5LE" data-el="text" dir="null">Late last year, law firms working for Google and Amazon warned the companies’ employees with visas to think twice before traveling abroad, out of concern they might not be allowed back into the U.S., according to documents obtained by The Washington Post. Denial rates for skilled visas spiked to 15 percent during the first Trump administration, and law firms warn that the same will probably happen now.</p><p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GUCYREGTMVDMXMGDEWFTF476BM" data-el="text" dir="null">Immigration attorneys are ramping up one-on-ones with workers, hosting company town halls, and providing written FAQs for companies to disseminate to their workers. In some cases, attorneys are giving blanket advice such as telling workers to carry their immigration documents, keep their address and job information up to date with authorities, stay connected with their attorneys and HR representatives, and be careful about social media posts.</p><p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7FFTOXPFPBAXBICB4EGHGZJOSE" data-el="text" dir="null">“Everything will be under a heightened level of scrutiny, and people should be prepared for that,” said Audrea Golding, a Silicon Valley-based partner at the law firm Fragomen, Del Rey, Bernsen &amp; Loewy who represents small and medium-size companies in tech, pharmaceuticals and biotech.</p><p data-qa="article-body"><h3 data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="I3RZ6UQBXJCNBKNHNZYUW6RGAY" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="I3RZ6UQBXJCNBKNHNZYUW6RGAY"><b>Difficult path to the ‘American Dream’</b></h3></p><p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UOT6IT56GJBKVPG2LZOOM5XMOQ" data-el="text" dir="null">Every year, thousands of students travel to the U.S. to study computer science and other tech subjects at prestigious universities. The best among them compete for entry-level jobs at tech companies willing to apply for H1Bs once their student-work visas expire. Once they secure an H1B, they can begin the path to a green card. But for people from some countries, especially India, there is such a backlog of green card applicants that many wait years or even decades before getting permanent status.</p><p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="D57Y7ZCJMZF2JMQH3HR3V4Y72A" data-el="text" dir="null">In October, the CEO of fast-rising AI company Perplexity, Aravind Srinivas, <a href="https://x.com/AravSrinivas/status/1851700699756925059?lang=en" target="_blank">posted on X</a> that he has been waiting for a green card for three years, despite founding and building a company recently valued at $9 billion that employs hundreds of people.</p><p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IY6T2OUSGFFXFCJ27TRWIAK7NQ" data-el="text" dir="null">“People mostly have no idea when they talk about immigration,” Srinivas posted on X. He declined to be interviewed for this article.</p><p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DCZHT75U7ZD4XDGYFWH2SZCR6M" data-el="text" dir="null">Two H1B workers for a tech company that has a Silicon Valley hub, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of being targeted by the government, said they were surprised to see so many sudden changes. They both canceled recent travel plans to India for fear of not being able to return. One worker’s daughter was born a U.S. citizen, but he worries that a future second child may not get citizenship in either the U.S. or India.</p><p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ND3LWF3Q2VCC3POYJ2JUZWHTY4" data-el="text" dir="null">“There’s an assumption that everybody who is not a U.S. citizen might be here illegally,” one of the workers said through an attorney.</p><p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ONHNFJNPTVBJZLVYYOYXIS32JI" data-el="text" dir="null">“When we’re walking around, we always carry our documents,” the other said through her attorney.</p><p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3L63LVL6DZGFJF4IZCQRKXJMHE" data-el="text" dir="null">Changes, such as limiting the waiving of in-person interviews for visas, happened too fast for some to properly plan. Others worry about more unexpected changes to visa processes.</p><p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MM6CLPONQ5HITNCKQK6QNCR47Y" data-el="text" dir="null">“I got an email where a gentleman had gone back to his home country because his father died, and he said, ‘I am terrified of returning to the U.S.,’” said Angela Moore, a lawyer at Duane Morris’s San Francisco office who advises tech companies.</p><p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YXYJFO7QNZBRRDKIEQDSYZJXSA" data-el="text" dir="null">The uncertainty is already negatively affecting some American tech companies.</p><p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7TPCCBW7U5BWVL3DUMEKYIZYOI" data-el="text" dir="null">“It definitely impacts their performance,” one HR representative at a tech firm in Silicon Valley, who spoke through an attorney, said about workers. “The threat is looming that some action will be taken against them.”</p><p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ASPXNSNCUNDHDPM4K7QKA5JTBU" data-el="text" dir="null">The HR rep’s company has paid for expedited processing of some<b> </b>H1B extensions to counteract delays related to changes in visa processing. It’s a cost that “adds up,” the HR person said.</p><p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GJXUDR2XPNE33LW4IP2TMLHHSM" data-el="text" dir="null">News about current and coming changes, inaccurate posts on social media, and vast amounts of easily accessible misinformation are making matters worse, Goeschl said.</p><p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3CPPRF3DWRBVDBBN363P3SDSCA" data-el="text" dir="null">“It’s causing a fair amount of panic.

creates the boundaries between each user, enables sharing machines between users,
and exposes the advertised routes of your nodes.</p>

<li>Automatically start/stop the server or connect to an existing one automatically.</li>
<li>(Optional) Use an isolated metadata (except AoE I) and profile directories to avoid potential issues with the official

<ul dir="auto">
<li>Redirect the game's API requests to the LAN server.</li>
<li>Redirect the game CDN so it does not detect the official game status.</li>

</li>
<li>(Optional) Install a self-signed certificate to allow the game to connect to the LAN server.</li>
<li>Automatically find and start the game.</li>

<li><strong>Download</strong> the proper <em>full</em> asset from the latest
stable release from <a href="https://github.com/luskaner/ageLANServer/releases">https://github.com/luskaner/ageLANServer/releases</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Uncompress</strong> it somewhere.</li>
<li><em>Windows Optional</em>: Unblock the <code>.exe</code> files as explained <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/5357-unblock-file-windows-10-a.html" rel="nofollow">here</a></li>
<li>If not using the Steam or Xbox launcher, <strong>edit the <code> launcher/resources/config.&lt;game&gt;.toml</code> file</strong> with a text editor (like Notepad)
and modify
the <code>Client.Executable</code> section to point to the game launcher path.
<strong>You will need to use a custom launcher (plus what my
other <a href="https://github.com/luskaner/ageLANServerLauncherCompanion">repo</a> provides) for 100% offline play</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Execute <code>launcher/launcher-&lt;game&gt;</code></strong>: you will be asked for
admin elevation and
confirmation of other dialogs as
needed, you
will also need to allow the connections via the Microsoft Defender Firewall or any other.</li>
<li><strong>Repeat the above steps for every PC</strong> you want to play in LAN with by running the <em>launcher</em>, the first PC to
launch
it will host the "server" and the rest will auto-discover and connect to it.</li>
<li>In the game, when hosting a new lobby, just make sure to set the server to <strong>Use Local Lan Server</strong> (AoE II),
select <strong>LAN</strong> before creating the Lobby (AoE III) or select the "LAN" menu option (AoE I). In AoE I/II, setting it
to
public
visibility is recommended.</li>
<li>If the lobby is Public, they can join directly in the browser or you can <strong>Invite friends</strong> by searching them by name
and sending an invite as needed. You can share the link to join the lobby automatically (only works if already
in-game).</li>

Wayfair’s looked nice, the reviews were good, and best of all, they didn’t charge for shipping. </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd083831f-54d3-4319-b30f-b0ad03e10240_2962x1422.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd083831f-54d3-4319-b30f-b0ad03e10240_2962x1422.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd083831f-54d3-4319-b30f-b0ad03e10240_2962x1422.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd083831f-54d3-4319-b30f-b0ad03e10240_2962x1422.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd083831f-54d3-4319-b30f-b0ad03e10240_2962x1422.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd083831f-54d3-4319-b30f-b0ad03e10240_2962x1422.png" width="1456" height="699" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d083831f-54d3-4319-b30f-b0ad03e10240_2962x1422.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:699,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:2046860,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://annehelen.substack.com/i/160284873?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd083831f-54d3-4319-b30f-b0ad03e10240_2962x1422.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd083831f-54d3-4319-b30f-b0ad03e10240_2962x1422.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd083831f-54d3-4319-b30f-b0ad03e10240_2962x1422.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd083831f-54d3-4319-b30f-b0ad03e10240_2962x1422.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd083831f-54d3-4319-b30f-b0ad03e10240_2962x1422.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>The bed parts would arrive, unassembled, in a few big boxes.

The FAQ explains that the assembly will be performed by an “assembly pro” from “one of our trusted partners, Wayfair Home Services or Angi.” Assemblers are “background-checked and highly rated by customers.” All you have to do is add-on assembly when you buy the bed, then schedule it using the app. </p><p>So Jane paid $84.99 and scheduled assembly for the day after delivery. The boxes were dropped by FedEx at the wrong apartment door, a common occurrence with FedEx in this area, and Jane’s elderly neighbor had to push them down the hallway to her door. The next day, the Angi assembler arrived and began assembly. After several hours, the assembler told Jane she couldn’t finish: Wayfair had sent the wrong part. </p><p>Jane sent a photo of the bed to Wayfair, who promised to send a replacement part. But then the photo made its way to the Wayfair parts department, where someone looked closer: it wasn’t the wrong part. The assembler had just assembled the bed incorrectly. </p><p>Jane got in touch with Angi and asked for a new assembler to come  reassemble the bedframe. She kindly requested that they send a different person than they’d sent before. A few hours later, Jane received notification that her assembly had been scheduled. With the same assembler. Who then failed to show up for the appointment. </p><p>She was at wit’s end. She cancelled the assembly. She’ll eventually have the $84.99 refunded, but only after she fills out an online form and waits several weeks for a check to arrive in the mail. </p><p>Jane was telling a friend about the whole fiasco, and they volunteered to come reassembly. He quickly discovered that the entire frame had been assembled incorrectly, beginning with step one. The Angi assembler was probably good at all sorts of other things in her life. But she was not good at assembling. </p><p><span>Jane’s bedframe saga reminded me of a conversation I was having with a </span><em>different</em><span> friend last weekend, about the Apple Store’s inability to get her iPhone to ring with an incoming call. After a two hour phone call and a visit to the store, the phone remained broken. She started trying different Google queries —&nbsp;and fixed it herself. </span></p><p>After that conversation, I checked our island NextDoor to see that several FedEx packages had either been delivered to bushes or the wrong house —&nbsp;a frequent occurrence. Soon thereafter, my prescription was refilled incorrectly. At Fred Meyer, our local Kroger-owned grocery store, a bagger in his 70s put all my frozen items in a normal bag, and my chips in the cold storage bag I’d brought from home. </p><p><span>Small stuff, all of it. None of it super inconveniencing. But a series of inconveniences add up. Maybe you’ve experienced something similar over the last few years, contributing to a vague conviction that </span><em>people are bad at their jobs</em><span>. </span></p><p><em>People are bad at their jobs</em><span> is a sibling, of course, to </span><em>no one wants to work anymore</em><span>: the refrain of peak pandemic years. But both are deflections from what actually makes people “bad” at their jobs —&nbsp;or disincentivizes people to work. The truth is: </span><em>the jobs are bad</em><span>. </span></p><p><span>What makes a job bad? Take a look at Angi, which, like food delivery apps, Thumbtack, Taskrabbit, Instacart, and hundreds of other “gig economy” employers, promises consumers cheap ease: just a few clicks, and some part of your life will be easier. In reality, the business model that creates both the cheapness and the ease makes the end product significantly worse: the only way the company can make a profit is by taking a significant cut off the top of the service and by exclusively hiring part-time “independent contractors” (and thus circumventing labor laws; economist David Weil calls this phenomenon “</span><a href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/books/9780674975446" rel="">the fissured workplace</a><span>.”) </span></p><p><span>As a result, the majority of people who sign-up to do the work are making very little money. At Angi, </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wayfair/comments/yf5mr3/do_not_use_wayfair_professional_assembly/" rel="">assemblers report making around $25 for a single assembly</a><span>. A bed is scheduled to take two hours. Add in transportation, gas, and/or parking costs, and you’re making less than minimum wage ($16.66 in Washington State). So who’s doing this work? Someone who’s desperate for some control over their schedule. Someone who’s desperate, generally. Not someone who can market their skills themselves — like a local handyperson, working for themselves, who’d charge their hourly rate (mine charges $50 an hour) or a local furniture assembly specialist (the one I called charges $150 minimum for assembly; more for a larger project). </span></p><p>If you wanted to reverse engineer a job to ensure that the people doing it would do it badly, you’d build something like Angi. It doesn’t provide training. It doesn’t provide tools. It doesn’t provide benefits, or job security, or anything close to a living wage. If you get better at assembling, or if you’re so good you amass a client base, you can bet you’re not doing those jobs through Angi anymore. </p><p><span>Or take the example of FedEx —&nbsp;delivering to the wrong door and throwing packages in the bushes. We’ll start with FedEx’s primary competitor: UPS. UPS is </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/08/11/1193448000/ups-union-negotiated-a-historic-contract-now-workers-have-the-final-say" rel="">unionized</a><span> and directly employs its hundreds of thousands of U.S. workers. The average pay for a UPS driver is $95,000 a year, plus over $50,000 in healthcare and pension contributions. Part-time workers receive the same benefits. Working for UPS is a </span><em>good job</em><span> —&nbsp;and that’s part of why UPS workers are </span><em>good at their jobs</em><span>. </span></p><p>Delivering for FedEx, by contrast, is a bad job. It subcontracts its routes to smaller entities that then hire their own drivers; a scrape of job listings for drivers shows an average pay of $22 an hour. Most subcontractors pay their drivers using a “fixed daily rate,” which means they’re paid the same no matter how long the work takes. If they’re done early, they go home early; if they take longer, they’re not paid overtime. For a route like the one here on the island, they’re not receiving any extra pay for the time spent waiting in the ferry line on both sides. </p><p>It’s a bad job, which is part of the reason we have new drivers all the time — drivers who don’t know the island, or where to leave packages, but are desperate to finish the route as soon as possible. Again, the parameters of the job itself make it far more likely for whoever’s doing it to be “bad” at it. </p><p><span>Then there’s the botched prescription refill. I use the Walgreens Pharmacy out of convenience —&nbsp;but Walgreens, like every other chain pharmacy in the US, has been significantly understaffed for years. Chain pharmacies are now forced to negotiate with Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs), who serve as middlemen between insurance companies and the pharmacies themselves, ostensibly saving insurees millions by negotiating lower prices from the pharmacies themselves. In practice, PMBs save </span><em>the insurance company</em><span> millions —&nbsp;but not necessarily the insuree, who, even if they do save a few dollars on a prescription, is paying for “low cost” drugs by spending endless hours on hold or in line to get their prescription filled. </span></p><p><span>At the same time, the non-pharmacy parts of the drugstores themselves are </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/18/why-walgreens-cvs-retail-pharmacies-are-struggling.html" rel="">pulling in less money</a><span>, placing even more pressure on the pharmacy as a profit center. Thousands of chain pharmacies have closed since the pandemic, effectively funneling more customers into fewer outposts. (Or, as happened with me, the PMB that represented my insurance company offered my previous pharmacy at Fred Meyer a “take it or leave it” deal; when Fred Meyer declined, I could no longer have my prescriptions filled there. Hence: Walgreens, along with thousands of other local residents who can no longer fill their prescriptions at Fred Meyer). </span></p><p>More customers + more pressure to create profit + stagnant wages = fewer employees working more hours for less pay, which also leads to burnout —&nbsp;and people being bad at their jobs. And as for working in an environment that effectively forces you to be bad at something you’re good at —&nbsp;that leads people to leave the industry altogether. Cue: even more understaffing, even more pressure on the people who remain, and a much higher likelihood of a prescription renewal getting screwed up. </p><p>Okay, but what about the Fred Meyer bagger? Working at Fred Meyer is actually a pretty okay job: you start at minimum wage (again, $16 an hour here in Washington) and then get bumped up when you become part of the union. A full-time gig offers full medical benefits, paid vacation and sick leave, even Sunday overtime ($1 more an hour). </p><p><span>The vast majority of baggers I encounter are actually quite good at their job, but I also encounter fewer and fewer baggers, because Fred Meyer has decided that the best way to lower costs is to only have one checkout with an actual checker open and funnel all other customers to self check-out. This particular bagger was bad at this job because he probably shouldn’t be working this job, but it’s one of the few jobs available to someone who has to work into their 70s. (The bagger couldn’t get hired at Costco, which is right across the street and </span><a href="https://www.hbs.edu/bigs/costco-and-other-retailers-prove-a-good-jobs-strategy-works" rel="">a very good job</a><span>). </span></p><p>As for my friend’s iPhone —&nbsp;well, working at the Apple Store is also a good job. Even if you start at the bottom of the pay scale, they promote from within, offer full health benefits for full-time employees, 401k matching, and stock discounts. The Genius Bar appointment system is unrivaled. I recently messed up my computer and since I live two hours from the nearest Genius Bar, they sent me an overnight box (via FedEx, that time they got the delivery right) to ship it to them, did the repair, and shipped it back (also via FedEx, but this package didn’t get here overnight because the weekend delivery person couldn’t find my front door. Yes, she was new.) </p><p><span>Sometimes the product is just weird —&nbsp;or, as we used to say about certain cars, a </span><em>lemon</em><span>. But we’ve had enough experiences with people in bad jobs that it sure feels like everyone, no matter the industry, is doing bad work. We blame it on lack of ambition, lack of pride, laziness, rudeness, </span><em>whatever</em><span>, because it’s always easier to blame the individual who made our life difficult, instead of the systems that don’t just foster but incentivize bad work. </span></p><p>As a society, we have decided that we want more for less: more convenience, more purchases, more technology, but none of it at prices that render it out of reach. For years, we allowed immediate gratification to blind ourselves to the reality that making something cheaper and more accessible almost always makes it worse. It didn’t matter if the shirt fell apart or the couch collapsed — you could always buy a new one and survive on the glow of its novelty until it had to be replaced as well. </p><p>The exploitation (of workers, of natural resources) that made that abundant cheapness possible was largely invisible and thus ignorable. Some people paid the time tax and figured out new homes for their discarded items, but most people pile it into Goodwill or the dumpster, telling themselves a story about how it’d find a second life, or telling themselves nothing at all. </p><p><span>A badly made pair of sandals is annoying but survivable. But people being bad at their jobs </span><em>in your everyday life</em><span> is far more difficult to ignore. It adds unanticipated rupture. It blows up your carefully planned day. It exacts a stiff time tax —&nbsp;and while you have money (in part because everything is so cheap!) your time has become far more precious. You’re just standing there in line at Walgreens, stewing about </span><em>how there has to be a better way</em><span>, absolutely indignant that they can’t manage to figure out </span><em>one prescription</em><span> that refills </span><em>every three months</em><span> seriously </span><em>how hard can it be</em><span>. Our hunt for the frictionless deal turns a purchase into a quagmire that takes weeks to fully undo, restore, and solve. </span></p><p>Even if you don’t personally hold these values, the vast majority of us are members of societies that do. But resistance is very possible. If everyone’s good at their job, shop there. If you need help with something, find a local company or self-employed person to pay directly —&nbsp;and tip them. If something feels like a massive deal, someone or some part of the earth is paying steeply for it, and chances are high you will pay more for it (in replacement costs, in labor, in time) later. And if you’re forced to use a company with bad services and bad products, the fault is very rarely the worker themselves, but the organization that makes it so difficult for them to be good at their job. </p><p>I’m not saying we should all spend more money on everything. Or that we should collectively lower our standards and accept shoddy work. I keenly understand that part of the reason we rely on these exploitative services is because we, ourselves, are subject to the demands of the same economy: one that tells us our time is always better spent working or recovering from work, instead of helping others with their bedframe assembly or, say, shopping in person. </p><p>But I do think it’s worth wondering: what would happen, how might the paradigm shift, if we continue normalizing paying far more for far less?  ●</p><p><em><strong>Just want to be clear here that companies and consumers are all part of this —&nbsp;but if you’ve found yourself in the position of buying something like the Wayfair bedframe, I don’t think you’ve done anything wrong. I have ALSO bought a Wayfair bedframe!! (Although my assembly saga was far less fraught than Jane’s). I’m not trying to make anyone feel like shit; instead, I’m trying to have us think about our reactions to “bad” products and “bad” service.</strong></em><strong> </strong></p><p><em>So, for today’s discussion: What have you paid less money for —&nbsp;product-wise, service-wise —&nbsp;but ended up paying more in other ways? What are your strategies for normalizing (receiving) less for (paying) more, particularly in the US, which valorizes (receiving) more for (paying) less? </em></p><p><strong>The comments are, as always, a subscriber-only space; don’t be butts and let’s keep it one of the good places on the internet.</strong></p></div></div>]]></description>

been watching the tariff announcement at the Caledonian Bar in Manhattan. </p><p>They
stock 130 Scottish whiskies, and they’ll now face a 10% tariff when it comes to
importing them. </p><p>A
typical glass would set you back about $20. But that may have to
increase. </p><p>Jeff
Winslow - who works at the bar - explains that they may have to pivot more
towards US spirits, like bourbon and rye, which won’t face a similar increase
in price. </p><p>That’s
exactly the sort of change in behaviour distillers in Scotland will be worried
about. </p><p>After the tariffs were announced, Scotland's Deputy First Minister Kate Forbes said: “We do not believe unilateral measures by the US are the answer and we are concerned about the negative impact of trade barriers on the Scottish economy. We urge the US and all parties to come together and work towards mutually beneficial resolutions." </p></article></div></li><li><div><article data-testid="content-post" id="asset:78bd27a6-8502-4745-ba5a-de8016e218e3"><header><span><h3 type="normal"><span role="text"><span>Switzerland will quickly decide its response - president</span><span><span data-testid="timestamp"><span data-testid="accessible-timestamp">published at 23:24 British Summer Time</span></span></span></span></h3></span></header><figure><p><span><img alt="Karin Selter in profile looking to side before row of flags" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/640/cpsprodpb/vivo/live/images/2025/4/2/40c4415f-3e4c-45e8-b006-a1451abf1337.jpg.webp" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/vivo/live/images/2025/4/2/40c4415f-3e4c-45e8-b006-a1451abf1337.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/vivo/live/images/2025/4/2/40c4415f-3e4c-45e8-b006-a1451abf1337.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/vivo/live/images/2025/4/2/40c4415f-3e4c-45e8-b006-a1451abf1337.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/vivo/live/images/2025/4/2/40c4415f-3e4c-45e8-b006-a1451abf1337.jpg.webp 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/vivo/live/images/2025/4/2/40c4415f-3e4c-45e8-b006-a1451abf1337.jpg.webp 800w" width="1022" height="575"></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>Getty Images</span></p></figure><p>We've just heard from Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter, who writes on X that the country "will quickly determine" its next steps in response to the tariffs.</p><p>"The country's long-term economic interests are paramount," she wrote.

President Trump’s trade policy during his first term. The tariffs he imposed on
China allowed production in those countries to expand, and for them to grow
their market share in America. </p><p>Now, President Trump says, it’s payback time. Being
disadvantaged in this way could cost those companies dearly. They may try to
recoup sales for their textiles and other products in other countries. And the

will President Trump gain the extra revenues he hopes for. If they change their
buying habits, that penalises those trading partners but he doesn’t get that
tariff cash.

        Our mission is to enable developers with services that 
        help them rapidly prototype on the web.  We want to make it
        easier than ever for developers to share their projects with the world.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our services allow users to publish content without needing to install anything.
        We accomplish this with the SSH tools (<code>rsync</code>, <code>sftp</code>,
        <code>sshfs</code>) you already have installed on your system.
      </p>

      <p>
        Use our platform entirely using SSH and our TUI.

<p><em>Earlier today, CEO Matt Mullenweg shared with Automattic employees the following message.</em></p>



<hr>



<p>I have had to make difficult decisions to protect&nbsp;Automattic’s long-term future. This post will outline why the changes are happening and the next steps in our organizational restructuring. I wish to be transparent and acknowledge immediately that this will be difficult news to hear. We will do everything to ensure that all Automatticians, those staying and those leaving, are supported.</p>



<h2 id="why-we-re-making-changes">Why We’re Making Changes<a href="https://updateomattic.wordpress.com/2025/04/02/restructuring-announcement/#why-we-re-making-changes"></a></h2>



<p>We have reached an important crossroads. While our&nbsp;revenue&nbsp;continues to grow, Automattic operates in a highly competitive market, and technology is evolving at unprecedented levels. To support our customers and products, we must improve our productivity, profitability, and capacity to invest.</p>



<p>As difficult as this decision has been, we are restructuring the company to:</p>



<ul>
<li>Become more agile and responsive.</li>



<li>Break down silos that have created inefficiencies.</li>



<li>Focus on product quality, doing fewer things better.</li>



<li>Ensure a viable financial model for long-term success.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="what-this-means">What This Means<a href="https://updateomattic.wordpress.com/2025/04/02/restructuring-announcement/#what-this-means"></a></h2>



<p>This restructuring will result in an approximately 16% workforce reduction. HR will email those impacted to inform them they will leave Automattic with financial and support benefits.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="supporting-those-affected">Supporting Those Affected<a href="https://updateomattic.wordpress.com/2025/04/02/restructuring-announcement/#supporting-those-affected"></a></h2>



<p>This process is complex with Automatticians in 90 countries, but we’re committed to communicating clearly and compassionately. Colleagues who will be leaving will receive:</p>



<ul>
<li>A comprehensive package covering severance pay and benefits.</li>



<li>Retention of company laptops.</li>



<li>Job placement resources.</li>
</ul>



<p>They also have our enduring gratitude for their time with the company.</p>



<h2 id="looking-forward">Looking Forward<a href="https://updateomattic.wordpress.com/2025/04/02/restructuring-announcement/#looking-forward"></a></h2>



<p>Automattic has multiple products with world-touching potential in WordPress and beyond. I’m confident we will come out of this situation in a better position, poised to create a vibrant, profitable, well-designed company that will continue our mission to democratize the internet. I would ask that you take a moment to thank and appreciate the efforts of your teammates who have left the company, reflect on how you will move forward as an individual and Automattician, and join me in the vital work we have in front of us. I recognize this is a difficult time. In the coming weeks, we’ll share more about our path forward and how we’ll work together to strengthen our company.</p>



<p>We understand that you may wish to access support and discuss this with those close to you. I’d like to remind you that Automattic partners with Workplace Options, which provides emotional and practical well-being support if you seek advice from an external provider.</p>



<ul>
<li>[links to resources for employees, redacted]</li>
</ul>



<p>As always, your HR Wranglers are here to talk with you and support you.</p>

It can be our friends, church, or even our favorite news station. Throughout history this method has been so successful we've literally evolved to do it. It's why we laugh when others laugh, run when others start running, want things because others want them -- tribalism is built-in.</p><p id="block-1c5192c9496b8052bd2cc906761bfb5e">But when you acquire opinions in bulk like this, suddenly you don’t have a reasoned view, you have an ideology. Your opinions on sex can predict your opinions on taxation [17]. And it removes the ability to discourse because suddenly learning is replaced with cheering, discovery replaced with winning/losing. </p><p id="block-1c5192c9496b8025869edd21efe65b8a">Despite this inherent weakness, overcoming tribalism to improve our reasoning is still doable, <em>if </em>we desire.

In fact, they are very commonly built on the opposite.</p><p id="block-1c5192c9496b809e865bf17b120274f3">Whether a boss' reprimands are deserved or not, employees bond over a common enemy. Entire groups form on the basis of beliefs, false or otherwise. We have a word for this: “religion".</p><p id="block-1c5192c9496b80cabbbcefa2957fe487">Despite organized religion dropping in attendance, religious patterns of behavior are still everywhere, just adapted to a secular world.</p><p id="block-1c5192c9496b80498df3fb58f5e586d4">Health, exercise, politics, work, self-improvement -- these are all things I've seen friends employ their religious muscle into, across all spectrums and political aisles.

If you believe happiness is found from community (as I do), and your community, or even identity, is formed around a false belief, then not wanting to pop this bubble, no matter its validity, is understandable even if I can’t quite condone this myself[7].</p><p id="block-1c5192c9496b802bba60c4e801187a25">The Matrix portrayed it best -- when faced with the choice of calming delusion vs harsh reality, most people will choose the former.</p><p id="block-1c5192c9496b8046870cf4b1c6724558">Or better illustrated:</p><p><img alt="image" loading="lazy" width="480" height="360" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://images.spr.so/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/j42No7y-dcokJuNgXeA0ig/0e3bb63f-9e13-4c67-b11d-078ffaa177eb/image/w=640,quality=90,fit=scale-down 1x, https://images.spr.so/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/j42No7y-dcokJuNgXeA0ig/0e3bb63f-9e13-4c67-b11d-078ffaa177eb/image/w=1080,quality=90,fit=scale-down 2x" src="https://images.spr.so/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/j42No7y-dcokJuNgXeA0ig/0e3bb63f-9e13-4c67-b11d-078ffaa177eb/image/w=1080,quality=90,fit=scale-down"></p><p id="block-1c5192c9496b808da9d9db8151eff411">And this is fundamentally why I don't discuss politics with friends.</p><p id="block-1c5192c9496b80689d6ac709d21ec219">It's not that I don't want or am scared of opposing views (in fact the opposite is true[8]), but rather because of how common others’ desire to "remain in the bubble" is.</p><p id="block-1c5192c9496b8049a416edf8397bc548">If someone is self-aware enough to consciously acknowledge their choice to remain in the bubble, that’s totally fair.

My issue is when this view is falsely passed off as an intellectually-driven one.</p><p id="block-1c5192c9496b80ca8336d4a8d1890ebb">Because if a desire to seek truth isn't there, the conversation becomes the worst kind of debate, a pointless rhetorical one filled with fallacies and truthiness.

[1] I only consider myself moderately into politics, and slightly more into reasoning, if more from a practical sense than a formal one</p><p id="block-1c5192c9496b8016a345d7b83cf78813">[2] While it's usually people with significant life experience through business or intense study, I've been pleasantly surprised by friends who've seemed to develop this ability without either of those things</p><p id="block-1c5192c9496b801dbe23dfea741f66b2">[3] A reader might fairly ask what my tribe is. I'm not sure. A friend and I theorized one reason I might be more tribalism-allergic than others is due to a lack of tribe. Being quite culturally American while ethnically Indian, there isn't really a place in the world I can go where I fit in. In India I'm seen as American, in America I'm seen as Indian -- and it's perhaps this lack of tribe that's contributed to this viewpoint.</p><p id="block-1c5192c9496b8024abb4e67e0a6ee3d5">[4] One theory I have for this is reduced practice in critical thinking. As we get older, unless your job requires it in particular or you regularly switch industries, many roles are just pattern-based rinse and repeat. The other explanation is the community/identity that I cover later</p><p id="block-1c5192c9496b807c8f93d115de04df6a">[5] Note, there are other reasons people stick with tribalism, such as playing status games -- but this seems derivative of the community/identity angle</p><p id="block-1c5192c9496b8035b38cc17592fa1008">[6] Interestingly, I've noticed people who demonstrate this sort of political tribalism also tend to be big sports fans -- which could make sense if you view it as a form of regularly practiced tribalism.</p><p id="block-1c5192c9496b8057b2fdcf76e964610e">[7] Worth noting, however, that knowingly choosing a false belief essentially makes ignorance a value, something I understand but personally can’t accept</p><p id="block-1c5192c9496b80f8925dded118a0397a">[8] Few things give me greater joy than a discovery-ridden conversation with smart friends, and this is only enhanced if I learn something I previously believed to be true is actually wrong. Seriously, come prove some core belief I have as wrong and you will quite literally make my week.</p><p id="block-1c5192c9496b80ec83e8e821b833ba4c">[9] Fully understanding I can be the one in the wrong -- however, when this is the case, the person explaining is usually able to:</p><ol type="1"><li id="block-1c5192c9496b8064b74ad1d82b895eb4">understand my argument</li><li id="block-1c5192c9496b80d6a4a6d175df7d8d2c">convey their disagreement in good faith without circular reasoning or rhetorical tricks</li></ol><p id="block-1c5192c9496b802baa15faf4f594f6ba">[10] In general, I find writing is a much more intellectually honest medium than verbal discussion. Unless both debaters are skilled and intentionally trying for honest debate; the lack of record, tonality, and audience quickly devolve a conversation into the he-said-she-said, gaslighting, fallacy-ridden spectacle we see in presidential debates. But writing offers a reprieve: an idea can be articulated fully, without interruption, can be referenced and re-read. Indeed, writing seems to be the bane of gaslighters and ideologues and the bastion of the intellectually curious.</p><p id="block-1c5192c9496b80bf8221ee0690c5e130">[11] I do think some small percentage people genuinely want to be truth-seeking but just lack the ability to detect their own bias. It’s these I hope this essay inspires to put the effort into learning, but spotting these among the tribalists I find hard.</p><p id="block-1c5192c9496b80888069d90f2dcb96b8">[12] At 23 I quit my job, fed up with the bay, and bought a one-way ticket to Australia. After meeting my wife there and moving back, I did it yet again by explicitly taking a job in San Diego.</p><p id="block-1c5192c9496b8037b613e9b5c8bc5d4a">[13] Not a reference to the book, which I haven’t read — this is just a phrase I use</p><p id="block-1c5192c9496b800f9ad5d3ca2d9c219f">[14] I encourage everyone to learn poker to a level where they're assigning probabilities to see this system in direct action. Tribalists will often deal in absolutes: "he's 100% gonna fail", "she's doing it because she's evil", "housing always goes up". But you'll notice they rarely put their money where their mouth is.</p><p id="block-1c5192c9496b80ebb0c5d7a148dc032a">[15] Many people will make the post-modernist argument "there is no objective truth". I strongly disagree. If you're reading this post, that means you're using technology built on objective truth. You're only alive because your ancestors sought out objective truth to find food and survive. Yes, there are many instances where the only accounts of an incident are heavily biased, but that does not mean objective truth doesn't exist. Some actions were taken, with some combination of intentions at the time -- even if we can't realistically discover them, acknowledging their existence, and pursuing them with probabilistic guesses, is much more honest than just throwing our hands up and saying "everyone is correct" or just picking the one we like best.</p><p id="block-1c5192c9496b80859a22f23fd9c95c89">[16] This is based on my favorite method for fixing mistakes in sports, over-correcting. if I'm hitting too far left, I try and make the "opposite" mistake by hitting too far right. Then it's just a matter of honing in, or "oscillating" until I'm dialed in. In my experience the same works for reasoning.</p><p id="block-1c5192c9496b805fabb9e6d6857f3991">[17] Another favorite line from Paul Graham’s “Two Kinds of Moderate”</p></article></div>]]></description>

What I love about this exchange is that it takes place across the supposed</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Two_Cultures" rel=""> “two cultures”</a><span> of science and the humanities, jumping in a remarkably freewheeling way between literature, philosophy, and the fields of AI and machine learning, which were at the time barely even born. </span></p><p><span>The participants were </span><strong>Jorge Luis Borges,</strong><span> the great Argentine writer, and </span><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_A._Simon" rel="">Herbert A. Simon</a></strong><span>, an economist, psychologist, and pioneer of artificial intelligence.

Simon had requested the meeting because of his admiration for Borges’s writing—his first and only “audience with a celebrity,” as he put it later . He was visiting Buenos Aires to lecture on systems theory, but what he really wanted was to speak with the author of “The Library of Babel.”</p><p>“I have been seized by an unaccountable wish to meet you,” Simon wrote in a letter to Borges. “I am a social scientist who tries to understand human behavior by building mathematical models (or, more recently, computer simulations).”</p><p>Once the conversation began, Borges quickly guided Simon away from casual pleasantries about translation and into deeper philosophical waters. Borges, in his gently ironic manner, asked:</p><blockquote><p><strong>BORGES:</strong><span> “Now I would like you to tell me a bit about the so-called behaviorism. What is its underlying principle? Is it free will or predestination?”</span></p></blockquote><p>It is, and was, a hugely open-ended question. But Simon was at this time immersed in the study of early computer simulations, and he took this to be a question about whether the human mind is fundamentally comparable to a computer. </p><p>This was his response: </p><blockquote><p><strong>SIMON</strong><span>: Well, I always end up talking about computers. I’m in love with computers. We could put it this way. Faced with a certain problem, a computer will also behave in a certain way. And we may wonder whether it acted out of free will. We can say it employed free will in the sense that had it been programmed differently, it would have chosen to do otherwise, it would have behaved in a different way.</span></p><p><strong>BORGES</strong><span>: What do you mean by behaved? Because we are talking about a purely mechanical process here. I mean, in the case of computers, of course.</span></p><p><strong>SIMON</strong><span>: Yes, it’s a mechanical process. But I believe, like many others in my professional field, that human beings also display a mechanical type of behavior, much like computers.</span></p><p><strong>BORGES</strong><span>: Do you mean to say that we act by force of habit?</span></p><p><strong>SIMON</strong><span>: Rather accordingly to programs that we have stored in our brain. And we have free will in the sense that our resulting behavior will depend on who we are and the situation we are in. People respond differently when confronting the same situation.</span></p><p><strong>BORGES</strong><span>: So, in your opinion, when faced with a dilemma, say, a situation in which there is a choice to be made between two possible behaviors, we can choose one of them?</span></p><p><strong>SIMON</strong><span>: Your mental programming does the choosing. Yes, you choose. </span></p></blockquote><p>It seems to me that Simon is here arguing for what philosophers call “compatibilism” — the idea that determinism can coexist with meaningful human choice and responsibility. </p><p>When Borges pressed him on whether an all-knowing being could predict our every action, though, Simon didn't shy away from the implications:</p><blockquote><p><strong>BORGES</strong><span>: Would this imply that if any all-powerful being, any god, knew everything about my past, my childhood, even about the time before I was born, my ancestors … would this imply that he would be able to predict my behavior in any one situation?</span></p><p><strong>SIMON</strong><span>: According to my scientific beliefs, I would say so. With such knowledge, we can predict an individual’s behavior.</span></p><p><strong>BORGES</strong><span>: So, what I’m saying right now is …</span></p><p><strong>SIMON</strong><span>: … it’s a result of your past …</span></p><p><strong>BORGES</strong><span>: … it’s inevitable.</span></p><p><strong>SIMON</strong><span>: It is inevitable, yes. However, you still retain your identity, your individuality. You embody your own past.</span></p><p><strong>BORGES</strong><span>: I understand. Well, I like to think I do. Now, does this account for all of our actions? That is, if my right hand is resting on my left hand, is it because it has to be this way? I believe people do quite a lot of things without any thinking.</span></p><p><strong>SIMON</strong><span>: That’s the doing of our subconscious mind. You’re right, yes, otherwise, we would hardly be able to tie our shoelaces. Most things happen in this way. But that’s because we are heavily programmed.</span></p><p><strong>BORGES</strong><span>: Would you say then things are to be also inevitable in this sense?</span></p><p><strong>SIMON</strong><span>: They might be different, but always depending on programming. Any determinant could affect your programming and lead you to act differently. And if we introduce chance into the picture, scientists will always ultimately rule it out. At some point they may have to admit their inability to explain a particular phenomenon, but they will keep on working on the assumption that actions are determined by certain causes. And therefore, when we study a person who is in the process of solving a problem, we start from the assumption that every little thing has a cause. We are not always able to identify those causes.</span></p><p><strong>BORGES</strong><span>: Well, of course. In order to study a person’s behavior, professionals have to go back to that individual’s history. Even to the historic past, to the origin of humanity, the cosmos.</span></p><p><strong>SIMON</strong><span>: No, it’s not like that. Because the past influences a person’s present behavior to the extent that this past is already in the person. So, we can always find a starting point.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>What I love about this is that here we have two significant thinkers, in two very different fields, who are both reflecting on not just on the meaning and importance of history (“it’s a result of your past”) but also about how and whether they have, themselves, been able to </span><em>act within </em><span>history. </span></p><p><span>If you compiled an enormous dataset of everything Borges read, and combined it with an exquisitely sensitive record of every sensory experience he ever had, could you create a Borges LLM? It’s a question that I think a lot of my peers in the humanities would not take much interest in, today (the two cultures, again). But I love that Borges </span><em>himself </em><span>was thinking about it. </span></p><p><span>Lately I have been spending a good amount of time thinking about whether, and in what ways, there can be value in seeking to simulate historical figures (or even entire historical moments — like the </span><a href="https://resobscura.substack.com/p/how-well-can-ai-imitate-a-17th-century" rel="">collective medical opinion of 1820s London</a><span>, say) by combining a large amount of historical primary sources with an advanced language model. </span></p><p>I think this will absolutely be a powerful tool. I’m just not sure when and how. What I do know is that the people who figure that out will be a team that combines humanities and STEM. It is encouraging to see Simon and Borges embodying that kind of thinking way back in 1970. </p><p><em>I have been writing Res Obscura for 13 years now, and it has always been unpaywalled and free of any advertisements.

It was during Covid, and my wife was in her second trimester of pregnancy with our older daughter, Yara. My mom had been diagnosed with an aggressive form of cancer and was in a lot of pain. She was incredibly brave throughout, and, as a lifelong diarist and writer, she kept writing in her journal up to the end. </p><p>This is one of the last passages in her last journal. It’s about her hoping to hold on long enough to see Yara (who she ended up missing, alas):</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3440ad46-f712-4e53-b96d-33fd1a1dc3e0_2328x2190.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3440ad46-f712-4e53-b96d-33fd1a1dc3e0_2328x2190.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3440ad46-f712-4e53-b96d-33fd1a1dc3e0_2328x2190.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3440ad46-f712-4e53-b96d-33fd1a1dc3e0_2328x2190.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3440ad46-f712-4e53-b96d-33fd1a1dc3e0_2328x2190.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3440ad46-f712-4e53-b96d-33fd1a1dc3e0_2328x2190.png" width="1456" height="1370" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3440ad46-f712-4e53-b96d-33fd1a1dc3e0_2328x2190.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1370,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:5880339,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://resobscura.substack.com/i/157599263?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3440ad46-f712-4e53-b96d-33fd1a1dc3e0_2328x2190.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3440ad46-f712-4e53-b96d-33fd1a1dc3e0_2328x2190.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3440ad46-f712-4e53-b96d-33fd1a1dc3e0_2328x2190.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3440ad46-f712-4e53-b96d-33fd1a1dc3e0_2328x2190.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3440ad46-f712-4e53-b96d-33fd1a1dc3e0_2328x2190.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>The second to last entry in  my mother’s journal.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>Imagine if anyone could punch in a phone number from the largest U.S. cell carrier and instantly retrieve a list of its recent incoming calls—complete with timestamps—without compromising the device, guessing a password, or alerting the user.</p><p>Now imagine that number belongs to a journalist, a police officer, a politician, or someone fleeing an abuser.</p><p>This capability wasn’t a hypothetical.</p><p><img src="https://evanconnelly.github.io/post/hacking-call-records/cover.jpg" alt="Cover Image"></p><p>I recently identified a security vulnerability in the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/verizon-call-filter/id777875529">Verizon Call Filter iOS app</a> which made it possible for an attacker to leak call history logs of Verizon Wireless customers.</p><p>Call logs can be quite valuable, especially for nation states, as recently noted in coverage of the Salt Typhoon breach of telecom networks: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/25/us/politics/trump-vance-hack.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/25/us/politics/trump-vance-hack.html</a></p><p>Given that this data is of such value, you’d expect that both how it’s accessed, and who is given access would be closely guarded. However, as I found, this may not be the case.</p><h2 id="high-level-overview">High level overview:</h2><p>In order to display your recent history of received calls in the Verizon Call Filter app, a network request is made to a server. That request contains various details such as your phone number and the requested time period for call records. The server then responds with a list of calls and timestamps for each.</p><p>So surely the server validated that the phone number being requested was tied to the signed in user? Right? Right?? Well…no. It was possible to modify the phone number being sent, and then receive data back for Verizon numbers not associated with the signed in user.</p><p>In short, anyone could lookup data for anyone.</p><p>This is of course a privacy concern for all. But for some this could also represent a safety concern.</p><p>Consider scenarios involving survivors of domestic abuse, law enforcement officers, or public figures—individuals who rely on the confidentiality of their communication patterns. Having their incoming call logs exposed is not just invasive; it’s dangerous.</p><p>Call metadata might seem harmless, but in the wrong hands, it becomes a powerful surveillance tool. With unrestricted access to another user’s call history, an attacker could reconstruct daily routines, identify frequent contacts, and infer personal relationships.</p><p>Timestamps can be cross-referenced with social media or public sightings to map physical movements. Repeated numbers expose private or burner lines, compromising whistleblowers, journalists, or abuse survivors.</p><p>This wasn’t just a data leak. It was a real-time surveillance mechanism waiting to be abused.</p><h2 id="technical-details">Technical details:</h2><p>The Verizon Call Filter app uses the endpoint <code>https://clr-aqx.cequintvzwecid.com/clr/callLogRetrieval</code> to lookup call history for the authenticated user and display it in the app.&nbsp;</p><p>This endpoint&nbsp;requires a JWT (JSON Web Token) in the Authorization header using the Bearer scheme and uses an <code>X-Ceq-MDN</code> header to specify a cell phone number to retrieve call history logs for.</p><p>A JWT has three parts: header, payload, and signature.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p><strong>On Monday 7th of April 2025 at 7am UTC, we will migrate the Matrix.org homeserver's authentication system over to MAS (Matrix Authentication Service) in order to benefit from Next-generation authentication.</strong></p>
<p>The migration will involve up to one hour of downtime.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3861">MSC3861</a> (Next-generation auth for Matrix, based on OAuth 2.0/OIDC) and its dependent MSCs have progressed sufficiently that the Foundation is confident in MAS and the new next-generation auth APIs.Specifically, all the MSCs are now in or have passed Final Comment Period (FCP) with disposition to merge! 🎉</p>
<p>We expect the MSCs to finish FCP and get merged into the next spec release.The full list of core Next-gen Auth MSCs is:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3861">MSC3861: Next-generation auth for Matrix, based on OAuth 2.0/OIDC</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2964">MSC2964: Usage of OAuth 2.0 authorization code grant and refresh token grant</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2965">MSC2965: OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Metadata</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2966">MSC2966: Usage of OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration in Matrix</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2967">MSC2967: API scopes</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4254">MSC4254: Usage of RFC7009 Token Revocation for Matrix client logout</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This is incredibly exciting, reflecting 4 years of work on next-generation auth, and brings with it a new account management interface, additional security, and a better registration experience.</p>
<h3 id="the-account-management-interface"><a href="#the-account-management-interface" aria-label="Anchor link for: the-account-management-interface">🔗</a>The account management interface</h3>
<p>You will be able to manage you account on a <strong>dedicated interface at account.matrix.org</strong> (accessible through your client or browser), where you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>See and delete your devices.</li>
<li>Update your contact information, like your email address.</li>
<li>Change your password and deactivate your account.</li>
</ul>

</p>
<h3 id="improved-security"><a href="#improved-security" aria-label="Anchor link for: improved-security">🔗</a>Improved security</h3>
<p>MAS comes with a significant refactoring of how authentication works on Matrix. Without breaking compatibility with the former authentication API, it brings several benefits</p>
<ul>
<li>Now, only your server will be able to see your account credentials! No more typing your password in every client you’d like to log in to.</li>
<li>Restricted access to sensitive operations, like deactivating your account.</li>
<li>Clearer view of which clients are using your account.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="improved-registration-experience"><a href="#improved-registration-experience" aria-label="Anchor link for: improved-registration-experience">🔗</a>Improved registration experience</h3>
<p>Regardless of the client you use, the new registration and login experience makes it clear where your account lives, and it supports next-generation clients like Element X.</p>

</p>
<h2 id="impact"><a href="#impact" aria-label="Anchor link for: impact">🔗</a>Impact</h2>
<p>Your current sessions will remain active after the migration has taken effect. In other words, you will not be logged out of your clients.</p>
<p>We’re providing backwards compatibility for existing Matrix clients - this does not remove the stable Matrix 1.0 APIs. You can read more about the impact on clients in our previously published blog article - <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2025/01/06/authentication-changes/">Authentication changes on Matrix.org</a>.</p>
<h2 id="this-is-only-the-beginning"><a href="#this-is-only-the-beginning" aria-label="Anchor link for: this-is-only-the-beginning">🔗</a>This is only the beginning!</h2>
<p>Matrix Authentication Service is Matrix's next-generation authentication stack. Together with the next-generation authentication APIs, it is the base of a new exciting era for authentication in Matrix!</p>
<p>This has been one of the most ambitious projects within the Matrix project, the result of a multi-year investment by Element, funded in turn by Element’s customers, including BWI.</p>
<p>It will enable new forms of authentication flows, like QR-code login (coming soon to matrix.org with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4108">MSC4108</a>), and new categories of applications building on Matrix, thanks to fine-grained control over client access to the account.</p>
<p>You can find all the technical details in Quentin's Matrix Conference talk, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOW8keNafdE">Harder Better Faster Stronger Authentication with OpenID Connec</a>t.</p>

U.S. government agencies like the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/national-science-foundation">National Science Foundation</a>, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/department-of-energy">Department of Energy</a>, and <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/nasa">NASA</a> are critical sources of research data, technical specifications, and standards documentation in pretty much every area where <em><em><a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/">IEEE Spectrum</a></em></em>’s audience works—AI &amp; computer science, biomedical devices, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/power-and-energy">power and energy</a>, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/topic/semiconductors/">semiconductors</a>, telecommunications…the list goes on.</p><p>Access to that governmental data directly affects the reproducibility of experiments, the validation of models, and the integrity of the scholarly record. </p><p>So what happens if an entire dataset vanishes? Among other things, it can invalidate years of research built upon that foundation. </p><p>Until recently, wholesale deletion of data has been rare. In the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/united-states">United States</a>, presidential transitions typically involve some changes to government websites to reflect new policy priorities. And after 9/11, the George W. Bush administration removed “<a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/story?id=7496067&amp;page=1#:~:text=Unclassified%20military%20after%2Daction%20reports%2C%20an%20FAA%20database,amid%20fears%20that%20terrorists%20might%20find%20information" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">millions of bytes</a>” of information from government sites for security reasons as well as hundreds of <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/department-of-defense">Department of Defense</a> documents and “tens of thousands” of <a href="https://www.ferc.gov/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Federal Energy Regulation Commission</a> files. </p><p>The <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/obama">Obama</a> and Biden administrations likewise made changes to government websites but didn’t engage in large-scale removal of Web pages or datasets. Obama, in fact, expanded public access to government data in 2009 by launching <a href="http://data.gov/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Data.gov</a>, whose stated mission is in part “to unleash the power of government open data to inform decisions by the public and policymakers.”</p><p> During President Donald J.

<h2>Chubby Commutes to Hawaii:<br>
  A Technical Discussion </h2>

<hr>
<h2>From Dream to Plan</h2>
<p>As a consulting exploration geologist, my work life tends to consist of periods 
  of intense work punctuated by periods of intense unemployment. True to form, 
  I completed my last work assignment on July 8th and I found myself with a month 
  and a half of enforced leisure before my next gig. Since the coming job was 
  located on the Big Island of Hawaii, an old fantasy of mine started to materialize 
  as an actual plan. In early July, while looking at my West Wight Potter 19 "Chubby" 
  sitting jauntily at her berth at the Berkeley Marina, tugging at her dock lines 
  and proudly showing off her new bottom paint, it dawned on me that I could use 
  her to commute to my next job. On July 9th I started serious preparations for 
  the trip.</p>
<p>Just as I was getting heavily into the outfitting, my client on the Big Island 
  called and asked me to show up on July 16th at a coordinating meeting for the 
  project startup. I flew over to Hilo a day early and went straight to Radio 
  Bay, the small boat harbor located in the far eastern corner of Hilo Bay, tucked 
  in behind the big commercial docks. I chatted with the very friendly and accommodating 
  Harbor Master's staff and got all the information needed for proper check-in 
  and for renting a space at the harbor. I also got a chance to see the particular 
  style of anchoring and stern tie that is used at the 10' high cement sea wall. 
  The daily fee for keeping Chubby at Radio Bay is $8.50. There is a 30 day limit 
  that can be extended if there is room. When I arrived four weeks later in Chubby, 
  there were two boats tied up, leaving room for perhaps 15 more, so space was 
  not an issue. There is a locked restroom with shower at the dock for the exclusive 
  use of cruisers, and a market and laundromat one block away. The friendly atmosphere 
  and secure tie-up for my destination port gave me the final push to commit to 
  the voyage.</p>
<p>Upon return home to Oakland I found myself with four days to make the final 
  preparations for the trip. I had committed myself to a July 21 departure which 
  was the latest possible date that would assure my arrival in Hilo prior to start 
  of work. Also that date had a mild afternoon ebb to aid my escape. With such 
  a short period of time to prepare the boat, things got pretty hectic. But when 
  it came time to push back from the dock, Chubby was pretty well prepared and 
  upon arriving in Hilo, I was still of the same opinion.</p>
<h2>To Reality</h2>
<p>The following is a discussion of the technical aspects of preparing Chubby 
  and sailing her from Berkeley, California to Hilo, Hawaii. The actual distance 
  sailed was 2142 nautical miles and the voyage took 24 days, almost to the minute, 
  to complete. The voyage in general went very smoothly with no major mishaps. 
  I arrived in Hilo feeling fit, rested and happy. For those who enjoy reading 
  about ordeals at sea, I am sorry to disappoint. Nothing that was supplied by 
  International Marine, the Potter manufacturer, broke during the voyage. Chubby 
  generally behaved quite well in the open ocean and the trade winds even though 
  she is designed to be a trailer sailer and coastal pocket cruiser. I want to 
  stress that I do not want this article or my generally pleasant experience in 
  sailing Chubby to Hawaii to be construed as an endorsement for using the Potter 
  19 as a blue water cruiser. It was designed to be a safe and competent trailerable 
  coastal pocket cruiser and it fulfills its stated goals admirably.</p>
<h2>Safety</h2>
<p>Of the modifications I made to the otherwise stock Potter 19, most were aimed 
  at increasing the margin of safety for this already safe and stable design. 
  In order to increase the rate of drainage of the cockpit in case Chubby was 
  pooped, I added two additional 1-1/4" diameter cockpit drains located just 
  above the cockpit floor at the base of the transom. I also raised the overall 
  freeboard of the cabin by installing a hinged and latched lower companionway 
  door. Weather stripping for the door made a water-tight seal. This increased 
  the cabin freeboard by about 8" and raised it above the height of the transom. 
  Theoretically this would allow the clearing of water from the cockpit while 
  preventing significant volumes of water from spilling into the cabin. </p>
<p>I installed two types of jack lines. I ran a conventional nylon webbing jackline 
  around the perimeter of boat and anchored them through the fore and aft pairs 
  of deck cleats. The jackline was used as an anchor for my tether and harness. 
  The perimeter arrangement allowed me to clip into the jackline in the cockpit 
  and then go to the foredeck for headsail changes in my usual manner which was 
  to swing outboard of the shrouds. If I got bucked off the foredeck, I would 
  theoretically slide along the jackline to the stern and would be able to climb 
  aboard the boat using the swim ladder. A critical extra bit of safety equipment 
  for this jackline system was the tiller pilot trip line. It appeared to me that 
  if Chubby was gurgling along at 5 kts and I was being towed at the end of my 
  tether, it might be very difficult to pull myself up to the swim ladder against 
  the flow, even if the distance was only the 5 or 6 foot length of the tether. 
  I therefore rigged a small block attached to the tiller just above the tiller 
  pilot armature. I then ran a 3/16" line from the armature, through the 
  block and over the transom. The line trailed astern to a distance of about 8 
  feet. A light tug on the line would release the tiller pilot and allow Chubby 
  to round up and stop, giving me time to grab the swim ladder and get on board. 
  The system remains untested. Incidentally, I wore the harness and tether at 
  all times while in the cockpit and on the foredeck. This was one of two of my 
  wife Naomi's conditions for allowing me to take the voyage. The other condition 
  was to carry an EPIRB.</p>
<p>I ran two additional jacklines which were specifically for securing cargo. 
  These jacklines were made of 1/8" 7X19 stainless cable. One was run around 
  the inside perimeter of the cabin sole and was secured to the storage compartment 
  walls with through-bolted U-bolts using backing plates. The heaviest cargo loads 
  including the generator, water bottles and inflatable kayak were secured to 
  the cabin sole by means of the interior jackline using heavy-duty nylon webbing 
  and cam locks. The webbing which passed over the top of the keel served as a 
  backup to the factory installed keel hold-down fittings which keep the keel 
  in place in the event of capsize. The hatches for the storage compartments were 
  also secured to the interior jackline to prevent scattering of the cabinet contents 
  in the event of a knockdown or roll. </p>
<p>All the canned goods were stored in plastic tubs in the storage compartments. 
  They were secured to the bottom of the hull by wedging empty water bottles and 
  extra life jackets in the space between the tubs and the top of the storage 
  bins. The resulting stowage and tie-down system assured that even if Chubby 
  turned turtle, all the objects of significant weight stowed inside the cabin 
  could not be dislodged from their proper location. </p>
<p>A similar cable jackline was installed around the perimeter of the cockpit 
  sole. This was used to secure the tanks for the outboard and generator fuel. 
  All the fuel was stored in the cockpit so that any spillage could be drained 
  and would not fill the cabin with fumes. </p>
<p>Chubby's flotation capacity was enhanced to compensate for the added load. 
  This was done as mentioned above by stuffing the void spaces in the storage 
  bins with empty one-gallon water bottles. I also carried inflatable flotation 
  bags with several hundred pounds of buoyancy and a large capacity air pump so 
  that they could be filled in a matter of minutes.</p>
<p>For extreme emergency situations I carried an EPIRB with built-in GPS and a 
  complete suite of handheld flares and a flare gun. I also carried two handheld 
  VHF radios in addition to the fixed 25-watt unit. Rounding out the safety equipment 
  was an offshore type first aid kit.</p>
<h2>Navigation</h2>
<p>My primary navigation tool was a Garmin 12XL handheld GPS. I had an identical 
  unit in reserve, stored in a waterproof container. Also, I carried a Garmin 
  76 which served in lieu of a printed light list. All three units were programmed 
  prior to departure with the Jimmy Cornell route discussed later on and a few 
  critical waypoints for the departure from the Golden Gate and for the approach 
  to Hilo Bay. I kept a paper chart of the entire voyage on which was plotted 
  each noon position. I made a portable nav station for the paper maps by sandwiching 
  them between two pieces of 20"X24" Plexiglas.</p>
<p>I also took a sextant, and during the initial calm periods that plagued the 
  first half of the voyage, I learned and practiced celestial navigation. By the 
  time I got to the trade winds, I was able to get a decent position using sun 
  sights. In the trade winds the sights were much more difficult because of Chubby's 
  sharp motion caused by the short, steep following seas. However, even then I 
  was able to get sufficient accuracy of +/- 2 to 3 miles, which was plenty good 
  enough to hit the Big Island from 1000 miles out.</p>
<h2>Electrical</h2>
<p>Chubby's electrical system was powered by two group 24 12V batteries which 
  were original equipment when I bought the boat. The batteries were used primarily 
  to power the tiller pilot. The batteries were charged for about 1 hour daily 
  using a Honda EU 1000 gasoline generator coupled with a 3-stage battery charger. 
  The generator burned 1-1/2 gallons of gas in 24 days. I had started with a total 
  4 gallons of gas reserved for the generator. Other than the tiller pilot, there 
  were no significant electrical loads placed on the batteries. There was no backup 
  power source for charging the batteries.</p>
<h2>Electronics</h2>
<p>Electronics consisted of a 25-watt VHF radio with a cabin mounted antenna. 
  Two contacts were made with passing ships using the VHF, one on day 10 and one 
  on day 21. In each case I was able to have a fax sent to Naomi with my position, 
  condition, and my ETA in Hilo. I also carried a short wave receiver with SSB 
  capability but did not have much luck receiving any meaningful broadcasts. Wind 
  speed was measured using a handheld wind meter.</p>
<h2>Provisioning</h2>
<p>I took 40 days worth of food and water. Generally I relied on canned goods 
  to supply the bulk of my meals. Each can was protected in double Ziplock bags 
  to prevent rusting. Pinhole leaks in cans caused by rust and corrosion can be 
  lethal to the unsuspecting mariner. I used a small camp stove to heat the canned 
  meals. The stove I used was suspended from the cabin ceiling by 4 light cables. 
  Pots were locked onto the stove using the suspension cables and a sliding sleeve. 
  In a addition to the normal stews and chillis, I brought a lot of ready-to-eat 
  stuff like peanut butter, crackers, roasted almonds and energy bars. This was 
  kept readily within reach so I would have a rich source of calories during periods 
  of high wind and waves that might prevent me from cooking. That particular scenario 
  never developed during the trip. Even in 16-18 kt trade winds, I was easily 
  able to prepare hot meals.</p>
<p>I also brought considerable fresh food including apples, peaches, bananas, 
  bread, cheese, and olives. The bread and cheese lasted two weeks, the apples 
  lasted 20 days and the olives stayed good for the duration.</p>
<p>I started the voyage with 26 gallons of water and arrived in Hilo with 12 gallons 
  remaining. That works out to a consumption rate of a little over 2 quarts of 
  water per day. In actuality, I drank desalinated water during two days of calm 
  so my per-day consumption of bottled water was closer to 3 quarts per day. I 
  carried a PUR Survivor 35 reverse osmosis, hand-pumped water maker. I was able 
  to make a gallon of drinking water in 45 minutes. I drank the heinous stuff 
  when becalmed because I felt uncomfortable consuming my bottled water when we 
  were not making any progress. The bottled water was purchased in square shaped 
  1-gallon plastic bottles. This shape has the advantage of packing tightly and 
  not rolling with the motion of the boat. Also, the carrying handles on each 
  bottle facilitate tying the bottles down to the cabin sole. It is possible to 
  pack 15 one-gallon bottles into the space between the cabin sole and the cockpit 
  sole just aft of the companionway. </p>
<p>The total weight of consumables was probably around 320 pounds. Of that, 216 
  pounds was water and the remainder canned and dry foods. With 40 days of food 
  and water, Chubby was far from overloaded. She felt lively and easily achieved 
  hull speed in any wind over 12 kts even the first day when carrying her full 
  load.</p>
<h2>Spare Parts, Miscellaneous Equipment and Tools</h2>
<p>I carried the following spare parts, tools and other odds and ends:<br>
  1. Prop for the motor.<br>
  2. Wire rope along with a swaging tool, thimbles and collars to replace the 
  shrouds and stays if needed.<br>
  3. Rudder and tiller. The spare rudder was the original folding rudder that 
  came with the boat which stores easily in the quarter berth when disassembled.<br>
  4. Spare boom.<br>
  5. Spare gooseneck (I've broken two in the last 3 years).<br>
  6. Duplicates of each headsail and main.<br>
  7. Storm trysail and storm jib.<br>
  8. Spare Raytheon ST 2000 tiller pilot<br>
  9. Tool bag with hacksaw, bolt cutter, hand drill, rivet gun, grommet kit and 
  assorted hand tools and fastners. <br>
  10. 4' X 6' piece of hypolon for use as a collision mat.<br>
  11. Spare pins for all rigging attachments.<br>
  12. Two spare handheld GPS units.<br>
  13. Two spare handheld VHF radios.<br>
  14. Inflatable kayak<br>
  15. Two 150' nylon warps for streaming during heavy weather.<br>
  16. Two anchors with chains and rodes.</p>
<h2>Routing and Weather</h2>
<p>Starting a week before the planned departure, I checked the weather maps two 
  or three times a day. Fortunately, the Pacific Cup race was being run during 
  the week prior to my departure and the race website gave very valuable information 
  about the routes and relative wind strengths. The early starters in the race 
  were running at or near record paces which indicated that the normal wind patterns 
  were well-established. </p>
<p>It appeared to my novice weather eye that the East Pacific High was poorly 
  formed in June and early July, but further into July the classic summer wind 
  pattern emerged and the early starting Pacific Cup racers made good use of it. 
  Based on the return of the normal winds, I chose the standard route as described 
  in Jimmy Cornell's World Cruising Routes and programmed that route into my GPS.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, two days before my departure, the West Coast weather pattern 
  deteriorated with the westward migration of a low pressure system which is normally 
  parked over the Nevada desert during the summer months. This low herniated westward 
  and established itself just off the coast stretching from Santa Barbara to San 
  Francisco. It brought with it light and variable southwesterlies. In other words, 
  for the first three days of the voyage after leaving the Golden Gate, I had 
  light winds on the nose or no wind at all. The NOAA weather reports promised 
  that the low pressure would dissipate by the July 24, three days after my departure. 
  In the meantime I found myself either beating toward Hilo or mired in glassy 
  flat calms. My strategy at this point was to tack WNW and look for the normal 
  northwesterlies farther off the coast. This was a departure from my original 
  plan of taking a southerly course for the first three days in lieu of a shakedown 
  cruise. </p>
<p>The planned shakedown which was to take place a week before my departure to 
  Hawaii, had to be scrapped because of various work commitments. I was left with 
  only a week to prepare and provision the boat but no time to do an offshore 
  shakedown. Taking the southerly line would have allowed me to return to any 
  number of Southern California ports on a beam reach in the event that I did 
  not like the way Chubby or her skipper were behaving after three to five days 
  at sea. After three days of foul wind or no wind, I was well to the north of 
  the Jimmy Cornell route. But finally the northeawesterlies started to fill in 
  and I was able to ease the sheets and make some southing. During day 5 Chubby 
  ran off 139 nm bearing SSW which put us within 15 miles of the original planned 
  route. At that point I committed mentally to Hilo as my final destination even 
  though I still had 2 days of sailing before I passed my original point of no 
  return. Beyond the point of no return, which I defined for myself as 30 N, 130 
  W, I would have had to cross the main hurricane corridor out of Mexico in order 
  to reach Turtle Bay or Cabo San Lucas and I did not consider that a feasible 
  option. Five days later, my assumption proved to be very correct as the benign 
  remnants of Hurricane Elida crossed my outbound path precisely at that location. 
  Had I diverted southeastward at day 5, I might have run into 30 or 40 kt winds 
  from the death throes of Elida, which on July 24 was a very proud category 5 
  hurricane with 140 kt winds about 1000 miles to the southeast.</p>
<p>My first hint of a possible hurricane came on day 8 when I found myself becalmed 
  for 12 hours in an area where the pilot charts shows a 2% probability of calms. 
  This was followed by a rapidly dropping barometer from 1016 to 1011 in one night 
  and a cross swell coming out of the SE. This swell combining with the normal 
  swell from the north produced a very uncomfortable, confused sea. On day 10 
  I hailed the tanker Selendang Ratna out of Manzanillo, Mexico bound for Korea. 
  The officer of the watch asked me if I had been hit by the hurricane. My reply 
  was "What hurricane?" He gave me the last plotted position of Elida, 
  her course and speed. The officer complained about getting hammered by high 
  seas and winds a couple of days earlier. After hearing that and plotting the 
  last position of Elida, I stopped complaining to myself about the calms I was 
  encountering. The officer of the watch was able to send a fax for me to Naomi, 
  in which I gave my ETA in Hilo as 15 days hence. That turned out to be a pretty 
  good guess because ultimately I arrived in Hilo from that position in 14 days. 
</p>
<p>As far as heavy weather is concerned, Chubby was never challenged. Aside from 
  the 25 kts. which Chubby beat through to exit the Gate, no winds over 20 kts 
  were encountered during the entire voyage. The trade winds averaged 12-16 knots 
  (Force 4) just as advertised on the Pilot Chart for August. Seas averaged 4-8 
  feet with abundant whitecaps. The trade wind swell tended to be relatively steep 
  with a short wave length. The wave pattern almost always consisted of two wave 
  trains, a dominant one coming from the NE and a smaller one caused by the local 
  squall winds that came out of the east. This crossing pattern produced a relatively 
  sharp and chaotic motion for Chubby. The steep quartering sea tended to tip 
  Chubby back to windward just as the crest of each wave passed. This tipping 
  resulted in a stiff bounding of the flat rear quarter. This was probably the 
  most uncomfortable of Chubby's open ocean hull characteristics. On the other 
  hand, once Chubby left the Golden Gate, she never took any significant spray 
  into the cockpit in the remaining 2100 miles of sailing. My clothes, the cabin, 
  its contents, and I arrived completely dry in Hilo which was a welcome departure 
  from the soggy mess that I imagined the voyage might be. Clearly my imagination 
  was traumatized by three wet, cold years of sailing in the Slot.</p>
<p>The final weather insult came at a distance of 12 miles outside Hilo Bay. At 
  that point just before dawn, the trade winds quit and a land breeze sprung up 
  at 12 kts on the nose coming right up the rhumbline. That, combined with a strong 
  current setting Chubby north along the Hamakua Coast, meant that after 2135 
  miles of sailing and with the safe harbor in sight, we were starting to lose 
  ground. By then I had contacted Naomi by cell phone and found out that, instead 
  of being at home, she was waiting for me in Hilo. Armed with the happy news, 
  I did not hesitate to mix up a batch of two stroke gas using the gas reserved 
  for the generator. I topped off the outboard tank and started bashing into the 
  chop at full throttle. The wind waves from the land breeze were coming out directly 
  opposed to the incoming trade wind swell, thereby creating a nasty standing 
  chop. Powering in against the chop, wind and foul current, I could only make 
  3.5 knots until we got inside the breakwater. Within three hours though, I was 
  standing on the dock holding Naomi in my arms, or more correctly she was holding 
  me up, while my wobbly sea legs tried to get accustomed to the concrete.</p>
<h2>Performance, Sails and Self Steering</h2>
<p>When there was any kind of steady wind at 8 kts or higher, anywhere beyond 
  60 degrees off the bow, Chubby would easily do over 100 miles a day. Her two 
  best days were 139 and 122 nm and she ran off a total of 13 days of over 100 
  nm out of the 24-day voyage. Dead calms made up 94 hours or nearly four days 
  of the voyage. All speeds and distances run were enhanced by the constant 0.5 
  kt current that runs right down the rhumbline to Hilo. Two boats out of San 
  Francisco Bay, a Columbia 8.7m Alchemy and an Islander 28 Kiss, had preceded 
  Chubby to Radio Bay by a few days. Their passage times were 19 and 20 days respectively. 
  Chubby, with her 16' water line, had nothing to be ashamed about for her 24 
  day passage. </p>
<p>I ran two basic sail configurations for the downwind portions of the voyage. 
  Initially in the lighter trade winds, especially in the absence of squalls, 
  I ran a pair of jibs or genoas, wing and wing, hanked onto the forestay and 
  poled out. With the pair of winged-out genoas Chubby would make 2-3 kts in barely 
  perceptible zephyrs. This configuration salvaged a few miles out of otherwise 
  abysmal light-air days. Rigging the two headsails was accomplished by using 
  a short pendant at the tack of one headsail to create an offset between the 
  pairs of hanks. The two heads were joined with about 8" of ¼" 
  line. The jib halyard was shackled to this line which served to evenly luff 
  tension in both headsails. I ran a preventer on both whisker poles when running 
  the genoas because if one went aback, it would break the whisker pole fitting 
  mounted on the mast. The smaller jibs did not require the preventers when winged 
  out. The advantage of the winged-out jib configuration is that it tended to 
  track straighter going dead down wind and therefore it put a minimum stress 
  on the tiller pilot.</p>
<p>I used the more conventional dead-down setup of poled-out jib and prevented 
  mainsail in the latter part of the trade wind segment. Due to squall activity 
  and the accompanying wind shifts, I found it more convenient with this setup 
  to go from dead run with the whisker pole to a broad reach without having to 
  remove one of the head sails. The winds accompanying the squalls would generally 
  clock about 20 degrees from northeasterly to easterly. These shifts most often 
  happened at night and four or five sail adjustments were not uncommon in any 
  given night.</p>
<p>One great advantage of the Potter 19 is that most sail adjustments and reefing 
  can be made without leaving the cabin. On a typical squall-induced wind shift, 
  I would literally standup in my bed, remove the whisker pole, sheet in the jib 
  on broad reach, reef the main, lean out and adjust the autopilot and go back 
  to sleep without ever taking off the wool socks I wore while sleeping. All of 
  the above could be accomplished in about 2 minutes. If I were lazy in the middle 
  of the night or was involved in a particularly vivid dream when the squalls 
  came up, I would simply drop and furl the main, and continue to make 4 kts on 
  the jib alone and get back to sleep in a minute or so.</p>
<p>The trick in using the tiller pilot is to reef down the main and balance it 
  with the appropriate jib. This would minimize the demands on the tiller pilot 
  and hence on electrical consumption. This cost a little raw boat speed but resulted 
  in a straighter course and fewer roundups which somewhat compensated. With a 
  quartering sea, Chubby would tend to round-up occasionally, typically once or 
  twice an hour. In only one case was the autopilot unable to recover the roundup 
  on its own. Normally in a roundup, the poled-out jib would go aback and force 
  the bow back down wind, thereby aiding the tiller pilot to recover. The Raytheon 
  ST 2000 tiller pilot performed flawlessly throughout the 24 day voyage, just 
  as it had during the entire previous year of sailing on San Francisco Bay. </p>
<p>I used a custom made mainsail from Pineapple Sails in Oakland. The sail was 
  cut flatter than the stock sail in order to better accommodate the relatively 
  stiff winds of San Francisco. Also, the sail had three reef points, two that 
  were identical to the stock main, and one very deep reef that reduces the main 
  to near storm-trysail size. I used the third reef occasionally during the trip 
  with winds above 18 kts because it seemed to balance the #2 jib better than 
  the much larger second reef. </p>
<p>Because of the anomalous wind patterns during the first half of the voyage, 
  Chubby found herself hard on the wind on many occasions. This brought out one 
  of Chubby's weaknesses in that she would not tack through less than about 110 
  degrees. This characteristic was discussed by Bill Combs in a very interesting 
  and entertaining account of his trip from Florida to the Bahamas. I am conjecturing 
  that this is due to the slab shape of the keel. The slab shape probably loses 
  lift and stalls out at a greater angle of attack than a typical faired fixed 
  keel. This accounts for the generous leeway that the Potter 19 experiences and 
  is probably inherent in any retractable keel boat design.</p>
<p>Another observation that I shared with Bill Combs was how comfortable the boat 
  was when loaded with water and food, all stowed and tied down on the cabin sole. 
  This enhanced ballast made Chubby very stiff and relatively smooth riding, particularly 
  in the 25-kt breeze on the nose we encountered while beating out to the Golden 
  Gate.</p>
<p>Though I never had occasion to practice any heavy weather tactics, I did notice 
  one characteristic of Chubby that might indicate her capability of running off 
  before a gale while trailing warps. Occasionally during sail changes, Chubby 
  would find herself under bare poles for a few moments. With the autopilot set 
  for running dead down wind, Chubby seemed to run a very straight course with 
  the following sea square on the stern. She'd make 1-1/2 to 2 kts in 16 to 18 
  kts of wind in this configuration. I am conjecturing based on this experience 
  that she might do passably well in a gale sailing directly down wind while trailing 
  warps and running the tiller pilot. This remains to be tested. Chubby also heaves-to 
  very easily and I did this several times during the voyage either to make repairs 
  or take in a reef in a fresh breeze.</p>
<h2>Sleep</h2>
<p>I slept primarily at night. I seemed to naturally wake up about once every 
  hour at which time I'd check the wind direction, boat speed, course, and scan 
  the horizon for traffic. I slept athwartship between the two cabin seats. The 
  center portion of the cabin between the two seats was filled in with the inflatable 
  kayak and extra life jackets arranged to make a passable bed. I avoided using 
  the V-berths because it is awkward and slow getting out of the V-berth in the 
  event that I had to get out into the cockpit in a hurry. The advantage of the 
  sleeping in the aft part of the cabin as I did, is that I could instantly access 
  all the control lines just by standing up in my bed. Also, I could check the 
  wind vane by simply sliding back the hatch cover and looking straight up from 
  where I lay. I arrived feeling reasonably well rested and never felt that I 
  was suffering from sleep deprivation. </p>
<p>In the shipping lanes and in the final hours of the voyage as I neared Hilo, 
  I used a kitchen timer to wake myself up at 30 minute intervals so I could give 
  a quick horizon scan.</p>

<h2>Clothing</h2>
<p>During the first 10 days of the trip, temperatures were cool, generally in 
  the the 50's and 60's (F). For this segment I wore heavy fleece pants and shirt 
  and my foulies. This combination was very warm. At night I would add wool socks 
  and sea boots if I had to exit the cabin to make sail adjustments, particularly 
  on the foredeck. For sleeping during the cool weather, I would cover myself 
  with light sleeping bag. The need to be able to exit the cabin quickly at night 
  to tend to the sails precluded the option of actually crawling into a zipped 
  sleeping bag. South of latitude 30 N, I was generally in shorts and long-sleeved 
  shirt during the day and would sleep in the fleece at night. I always wore a 
  broad brimmed hat during the day and used sun block so I never suffered any 
  sunburn. </p>
<h2>Loose Ends</h2>
<p>As I explained to my neighbors who were expecting twins after years of discussion 
  and deliberation, leaving on a voyage is like deciding to have a baby. If you 
  wait until you are 100% ready, it will never happen. Therefore, there are always 
  a few loose ends remaining when one pushes away from the dock. Half way through 
  my voyage, and of course unbeknownst to me, my neighbors gave birth to twins. 
  And true to my assertion, none of us were completely ready to embark on our 
  respective adventures. In my case the loose ends can be listed as follows:</p>
<p>1. I did not check the condition of the two batteries that provided power for 
  the tiller pilot. I was still using the same batteries supplied originally by 
  International Marine but after 3-1/2 years, they were near the end of their 
  usable life. By the time I got to Hilo, they were reluctant to take a full charge. 
  If the voyage had lasted another few days, I might have been doing a lot of 
  hand steering.<br>
  2. I did not have time to contact my doctor to secure a supply of antibiotics. 
  This left me vulnerable to uncontrolled infections and tooth aches. Luckily, 
  nothing of that sort occurred.<br>
  3. I had no backup power source other than the Honda generator. If the generator 
  got swamped with salt water during a knockdown or malfunctioned for mechanical 
  reasons, I would have been condemned to endless hours at the tiller.<br>
  4. I had no radar detector. <br>
  5. I did not invest the time to experiment with my SSB receiver and therefore 
  never got any weather reports during the voyage.<br>
  6. I could have checked with a professional weather router before my departure. 
  He might have dissuaded me from sailing into the series of calms that plagued 
  my first 12 days at sea. Also, I did not look into the possible impact that 
  the incipient El Nino might have on the normal trade wind patterns. Ignorance 
  is bliss.<br>
  7. I could not get insurance coverage for the voyage or for the boat in Hawaii.</p>
<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
<p>I would like to express my deep appreciation to Jerry Barrilleaux for all the 
  patience, time and sage advice he gave to me on the phone helping me to configure 
  my Potter 19 prior to placing the order. Jerry made his final adjustments to 
  my boat just three months before my departure to Hilo. I met up with him in 
  Ayala Cove and he noticed that my mainsheet was rigged incorrectly. He quickly 
  remedied the problem, thus fixing a problem I was unaware of for the past three 
  years. </p>
<p>A big thanks to Bruce Chase, the shop manager at <a href="http://www.wwpotter.com/">International 
  Marine</a>. Bruce was very generous in his support of my project though he had 
  no idea what it was all about until after I left. He was able to supply me with 
  several key items including two genoas on very short notice.</p>
<p>A special thanks to Joseph Oster of <a href="http://www.wingo.com/">Wingo.com</a>, 
  Naomi's website designer and blue water sailor, who very generously created 
  a link on his website to provide updates about my voyage. He gave much appreciated 
  moral support and information to Naomi and friends regarding the progress of 
  my voyage. He also notified the Potter Yachters and Latitude 38 regarding the 
  voyage, all on his own initiative. </p>
<p>Many thanks to Pamela Johnson, my sailing buddy for many a voyage on and outside 
  the Bay, for her skilled hand in helping to prep the boat and for photographing 
  my departure from the Golden Gate. </p>
<p>Thanks to Dr. Judy Blumhorst for her generous technical assistance through 
  her <a href="http://www.blumhorst.com/">website</a> and for her spirit of innovation 
  in bringing out the full potential of the Potter 19. She also gave much needed 
  moral support to Naomi through her e-mails to Joseph Oster concerning the rugged 
  construction and unsinkable characteristics of the Potter 19.</p>
<p>And most importantly, thanks to Naomi for her reluctant yet full support for 
  my voyage, for all her help in the last minute purchase and packing of food, 
  and for her audacious surprise of being at Radio Bay to catch my dock lines. 
  What a gal.<br>

<p>As seen previously, the Joy-Cons will be bigger than on the original Switch and will feature larger shoulder buttons on the inside edges. The system itself has a larger, "more sturdy" stand that can be adjusted to sit at multiple angles. A second USB-C outlet on the top of the system will allow for easier charging and connections.</p>
<p>Third-party publishers announced a number of ports for the Switch 2, including <em>Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition, Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</em>, <em>Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition, Hades II, Street Fighter VI, Split Fiction, EA Sports FC, Madden NFL, Hogwarts Legacy </em>(with new Mouse Controls)<em>, Yakuza 0 Director's Cut, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4, and Hitman: World of Assassination</em>.</p>

<p>Nintendo Switch Online memberships will carry over to Switch 2. And Switch 2 owners who subscribe to the Expansion Pack will get access to a library of Nintendo GameCube games, including <em>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</em>,&nbsp;<em>Soulcalibur II, and F-Zero GX </em>at launch, with more to be added in the future. These games will feature "sharper graphics and higher resolution" than the original releases, Nintendo said. A replica wireless GameCube controller will also be available for purchase by Nintendo Switch Online members.</p>
<p>Nintendo also showed a small preview of a new, open-world <i>Kirby Air Riders </i>game. The follow-up to GameCube's <em>Kirby's Air Ride</em> showed the pink puffball grabbing a jetpack-propelled star across verdant, grassy fields.</p>

<p>The presentation concluded with a new 3D <em>Donkey Kong</em> game called <em>Donkey Kong Bonanza</em>, planned for July 17<em>.</em> The trailer showed a redesigned, cuter version of the big ape climbing cliffs, digging through highly destructible ground, and bashing enemies into one another with massive punches, alongside classic 2D and mine cart sections.</p>
<p>Nintendo will send out invitations for "priority" purchasing of the Switch 2, direct from the company, starting on May 8. Those who have purchased a Switch Online membership as of April 2, have had it for a minimum of 12 months, have opted to share gameplay data, and have logged at least 50 hours get priority. There will be a 72-hour window in which to use priority purchasing invitations.</p>

         }"><p data-block-key="0u55q">As Google DeepMind prepared for <a href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/gemini-robotics-brings-ai-into-the-physical-world/">its recent announcement</a> of a new family of Gemini 2.0 models designed specifically for robots, its head of robotics, Carolina Parada, gathered her team for another check of the tech’s capabilities.</p><p data-block-key="752j6">They asked a bi-arm ALOHA robot — a duo of limber metal appendages with multiple joints and pincer-like hands used widely in research — to perform tasks it hadn’t done before, using objects it hadn’t seen. “We did random things like put my shoe on the table and ask it to put some pens inside,” Carolina says. “The robot took a moment to understand the task, then did it.”</p><p data-block-key="a5acc">For the next request, they found a toy basketball hoop and ball and asked the robot to do a “slam dunk.” Carolina watched, proud and delighted, as it did just that.</p></div>

           &quot;section_header&quot;: &quot;How we built the new family of Gemini Robotics models&quot;
         }"><p data-block-key="0u55q">“We’d trained models to help robots with specific tasks and to understand natural language before, but this was a step change,” Carolina says. “The robot had never seen anything related to basketball, or this specific toy. Yet it understood something complex — ‘slam dunk the ball’ — and performed the action smoothly. <i>On its first try.</i>”</p><p data-block-key="e1ol8">This all-rounder robot was powered by a <a href="https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini-robotics/">Gemini Robotics</a> model that is part of a new family of multimodal models for robotics. The models build upon <a href="https://blog.google/technology/google-deepmind/google-gemini-ai-update-december-2024/">Gemini 2.0</a> through fine-tuning with robot-specific data, adding physical action to Gemini’s multimodal outputs like text, video and audio. "This milestone lays the foundation for the next generation of robotics that can be helpful across a range of applications," said Google CEO Sundar Pichai when <a href="https://x.com/sundarpichai/status/1899838913054744679">announcing the new models on X</a>.</p><p data-block-key="46l5k">The Gemini Robotics models are highly dextrous, interactive and general, meaning they can drive robots to react to new objects, environments and instructions without further training. Helpful, given the team’s ambitions.</p><p data-block-key="ev3sg">“Our mission is to build embodied AI to power robots that help you with everyday tasks in the real world,” says Carolina, whose fascination with robotics began with childhood sci-fi cartoons, fueled by dreams of automated chores. “Eventually, robots will be just another surface on which we interact with AI, like our phones or computers — agents in the physical world.”</p></div>

         }"><p data-block-key="0u55q">Like people, robots need two main functions to perform tasks effectively and safely: the ability to understand and make decisions, and the ability to take action. Gemini Robotics-ER, an "embodied reasoning” model built on Gemini 2.0 Flash, focuses on the former, recognizing elements in front of it, defining their size and location, and predicting the trajectory and grip required to move them. It then can generate code to execute the action. We’re now making this model available to trusted testers and partners.</p><p data-block-key="e4isc">Google DeepMind is also introducing Gemini Robotics, its most advanced vision-language-action model, which allows robots to reason about a scene, interact with the user and take action. Crucially, it makes significant advances in an area that has proved tricky for roboticists: dexterity. “What comes naturally to humans is difficult for robots,” Carolina explains. “Dexterity requires both spatial reasoning, and complex physical manipulation. Across testing, Gemini Robotics has set a new state-of-the-art for dexterity, solving complex multi-step tasks with smooth motions and great completion times.”</p></div>

    </div><p>One of the first verified predictions of general relativity is the gravitational deflection of starlight. The effect was <a href="https://briankoberlein.com/post/einstein-and-eddington/" target="_blank">first observed in 1919</a> during a total solar eclipse. Since stars appear as points of light, the effect is seen as an apparent shift in the position of stars near the eclipse. But the effect happens more generally.</p>


										    
																					<p>If a distant galaxy is obscured by a closer one, some of the distant light is gravitationally lensed around the closer galaxy, giving us a warped and distorted view of the faraway stars. This effect can also magnify the distant galaxy, making its light appear brighter, and we have used this effect to observe some of the most distant stars in the universe.</p>
<p>But perhaps the most beautiful effect of gravitational lensing is what's known as an Einstein Ring. This is where the <a href="https://phys.org/tags/distant+galaxy/" rel="tag">distant galaxy</a> is so perfectly centered behind the closer galaxy that its light is distorted into a circle of light. Einstein was aware of the effect but said in 1936 that "there is no hope of observing this phenomenon directly." But as brilliant as Einstein was, he couldn't imagine the power of modern telescopes.</p>
<p>We have now found dozens of Einstein rings, and one of the more beautiful examples was recently found by JWST, as seen in the image above. The close galaxy in the foreground is an <a href="https://phys.org/tags/elliptical+galaxy/" rel="tag">elliptical galaxy</a> that's part of a large cluster known as SMACS J0028.2-7537. The more colorful galaxy warped around it is a <a href="https://phys.org/tags/spiral+galaxy/" rel="tag">spiral galaxy</a> similar to the Milky Way. It is billions of years more distant, but perfectly aligned to create the almost perfect ring.</p>
<p>Of course, this image is only possible because of our vantage point. Astronomers in other galaxies wouldn't catch such a wondrous image. Yet another astronomical example of how beauty is not only in the eye of the beholder, but also where that beholder is.</p>

<p>“We’ve shown that taking five grams of creatine supplement per day does not make any difference to the amount of lean muscle mass people put on while resistance training,” said senior author <a href="https://www.unsw.edu.au/staff/mandy-hagstrom" target="_self" data-click_category="TextComponentRichText" data-click_id="text_Dr Mandy Hagstrom" data-click_title="RichText" data-click_name="Dr Mandy Hagstrom">Dr Mandy Hagstrom</a>, from UNSW’s <a href="https://www.unsw.edu.au/medicine-health/our-schools/health-sciences" target="_self" data-click_category="TextComponentRichText" data-click_id="text_School of Health Sciences" data-click_title="RichText" data-click_name="School of Health Sciences">School of Health Sciences</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The benefits of creatine may have been overestimated in the past, due to methodological problems with previous studies,” she added.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Creatine is a naturally occurring compound which supplies energy to muscles. It is produced by the liver, pancreas and kidneys, and found in protein-rich foods. Previous research shows creatine supplements help build muscles, enhance athletic performance, and may even have cognitive benefits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, previous trials have started supplementation and exercise programs on the same day, making it difficult to separate the effect of each on muscle gains, Dr Hagstrom said. They’ve also overlooked the potential for creatine to cause water retention, though more research was needed to confirm this.</p>
<p>So, in this trial, those in the supplement group started on creatine one week before the exercise program began, taking five grams per day, which is at the upper end of the recommended maintenance dose of three to five grams.</p>
<p>“We had what we call a wash-in phase, where half of the participants started taking the supplement, without changing anything else in their daily life, to give their body a chance to stabilise in terms of its response to the supplement,” Dr Hagstrom said.&nbsp;</p>

    <h2>The effect of creatine with and without resistance training</h2>
<p>During that first week people taking creatine gained more lean body mass, particularly women, gaining an average of 0.5 kilograms more than the control group. However, the extra gains they made varied greatly, and soon dropped back to match those of the control group.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The people taking the creatine supplement saw changes before they even started exercising, which leads us to believe that it wasn’t actual real muscle growth, but potentially fluid retention,” Dr Hagstrom said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Then once they started exercising, they saw no additional benefit from creatine which suggests that five grams per day is not enough if you’re taking it for the purposes of building muscle.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>By comparison, previous trials with no wash-in period found those on creatine gained one kilogram more muscle, than those not taking the supplement, during trials spanning four to 12 weeks.</p>
<p>“In theory then you would have expected our creatine group to put on three kilograms of muscle over the 12-week program, but they didn’t,” said first author <a href="https://www.unsw.edu.au/staff/imtiaz-desai">Dr Imtiaz Desai</a>, from UNSW’s School of Health Sciences and <a href="https://neura.edu.au/" target="_blank" data-click_category="TextComponentRichText" data-click_id="text_Neuroscience Research Australia (NeuRA)" data-click_title="RichText" data-click_name="Neuroscience Research Australia (NeuRA)">Neuroscience Research Australia (NeuRA)</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<div>
    <p>The participants, aged 18 to 50, were all relatively healthy people doing less than the recommended minimum of 150 minutes of moderate intensity exercise per week.</p>
<div><p>They were put through the same training program and had their measurements taken at multiple stages using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, a non-invasive imaging technique that measures bone mineral density (BMD) and body composition. They were also required to keep a food log three days prior to each assessment, which showed no significant differences in their diets.&nbsp;</p><p>
&nbsp;
Those on creatine did bypass a loading phase, which includes taking 20 to 25 grams daily for up to one week. While it is common to start with a loading phase, it can cause gastrointestinal issues and is not necessary to reach saturation levels – the maximum that the body can store at any one time.&nbsp;</p></div>

    <h2><strong>More research needed on creatine doses</strong></h2>
<p>The trial suggests people need to take more creatine than is commonly thought to get the desired benefit of additional muscle gains, the experts say.</p>
<div><p>Just how much more will need to be the subject of further research, but 10 grams could be the dose to test first, given it's already shown to be safe and promising for both brain and bone health, Dr Hagstrom said.&nbsp;</p><p>
&nbsp;
A longer study would also be beneficial, added Dr Desai, as would measuring body water content, tracking the menstrual cycle – which can affect fluid retention – and creatine absorption, which was not feasible for this trial.&nbsp;</p></div>
<div><p>“It would be really interesting to see if creatine has more of a long-term benefit,” said Dr Desai. “When you start weight training, you have those beginner gains in strength and those start tapering off around the 12-week mark and become slower, so it’s possible the support from creatine might come at a later stage.”&nbsp;</p><p>
&nbsp;
In the meantime, the researchers hope it will give people more realistic expectations on creatine use, and prompt them to question claims made in the marketing of some supplements. &nbsp;</p><p>
&nbsp;
“For your average person taking creatine to boost their gains in the gym, this will hopefully change their perception about what it can help them achieve,” Dr Desai said. “For professional athletes, particularly those who must be at a particular weight for their sport, the findings may inform how and when they take the supplement.”&nbsp;</p><p>
&nbsp;
As for researchers, it’s hoped the study may encourage others to start to use a wash-in phase, to better understand the impact of supplements with and without exercise.&nbsp;</p></div>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <p>It’s&nbsp;interesting to me that <em>Revenge of the Nerds</em>, while still full up of the nostalgia that the 80s lends us, is lately being <a href="http://the-toast.net/2014/09/30/sexual-racial-politics-nerd-culture-dialogue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">repositioned in the zeitgeist</a>. What was viewed for many years as a bit of harmless fun that waved the banner for nerds everywhere is finally being called out for exactly what it is; an Us vs Them revenge fest that never lets go of racism or misogyny, and damages the image of geek culture more than it applauds for it. That shouldn’t be surprising—<em>RotN</em> was always just a frat house comedy with a thin nerdy gloss applied to it. And that’s fine with me, because that was never my go-to movie for feeling the geeky solidarity.</p>
<p>No, my friends. That movie was <em>Real Genius</em>.</p>

<p><em>Real Genius</em> was loosely (very very <em>very</em> loosely) inspired by actual events that took place when university students were working to&nbsp;crack laser technology. But in <em>Real Genius</em>, this is being done on the fictional Pacific Tech campus, where the students are unknowingly creating that laser for the CIA to use in government sanctioned hits from space. They don’t know this because their odious professor, Dr. Hathaway (played to a tee by William Atherton), obviously isn’t letting them in on the secret. He’s too busy skimming off the funds that the government is providing to the project, so he can renovate his house.</p>
<p><a href="https://reactormag.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/real-genius3.jpg"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://reactormag.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/real-genius3.jpg" alt="Real Genius, Mitch Taylor" width="740" height="314"></a></p>
<p>Our protagonist is fifteen-year-old Mitch Taylor (Gabriel Jarrett), who is accepted early to Pacific Tech because, well, he’s a genius. He’s assigned to the laser project, working with his new roommate Chris Knight (Val Kilmer), a senior at the school who appears to have given up on taking college all that seriously. So… burnt out upper classman plus eager-to-please, impressionable freshman? We’re already set up for some prime Odd Couple shenanigans. We’re introduced to a guy named Kent and his cronies, who are also working on the laser project. Unlike Chris, Kent is the ultimate sycophant and only too happy to throw other students under the bus provided he gets to be top dog. So now we have a rivalry. Mitch meets a lot of strange people at Pacific Tech, one of them being Jordan, one of the campus’ few women who happens to size Mitch up and make him a sweater the day after meeting him, which she excitedly presents to him in men’s room while he’s peeing. So now we have a love story.</p>
<p>And… that’s pretty much where the comparisons to most college flicks and <em>Real Genius</em> ends. Because the film is about a lot more than that, for all it is a very 80s campus comedy. For one, the movie is better at portraying geeks in ways that don’t just melt down to old tropes of pocket protectors and bow ties and awkwardness. It communicates that having an outrageous IQ can be isolating, but doesn’t make all smart people out to be socially undeveloped shut-ins. It also shows us how being driven toward answers can blind even the most optimistic, well-meaning folks into making terrible mistakes. And it communicates what it’s like to study for finals more realistically than any film I’ve ever seen, which is an accomplishment and a half.</p>
<p><a href="https://reactormag.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/real-genius4.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="https://reactormag.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/real-genius4.jpg" alt="Real Genius, Chris Knight, Val Kilmer" width="740" height="355"></a></p>
<p>No really, there’s a scene where everyone is gathered around a communal table to cram for the exam, and one guy just gets up and starts <em>screaming</em> at everyone before running from the building. Everyone else is unresponsive and some other dude sitting on the room’s perimeter moves into his vacated seat without comment. That’s basically the experience distilled into its purest form.</p>
<p>Also, did I mention that it ends on a Tears For Fears song? Because that should be enough to recommend it right there.</p>
<p><a href="https://reactormag.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/real-genius9.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="https://reactormag.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/real-genius9.jpg" alt="Real Genius, 1985" width="740" height="416"></a></p>
<p>Another great thing about this film is how it <em>doesn’t</em> couch itself in the “nerd versus jock” dynamic. It’s a boring cliche that rarely bothers to examine the realities of persecution due to differences. Instead, it herds people into group stereotypes and activity negates character complexity. <em>Real Genius</em> knows this, and most of the rivalry here is geek-on-geek. We watch the very real dynamic of people in the same social circle trying to one-up each other to gain status, stroke their own egos, or flat out cause trouble for fun. When we reach the “party with hot girls” part of the film that so many college movies unthinkingly provide, the narrative beelines away from any form of non-consensual action; the party is full of student beauticians who are keen to meet some boys, and when the guys from Pacific Tech balk at having to talk to them, Chris Knight points out that they might try using their brains to impress them. The most uncomfortable person at the party is not any of the female attendants, but Mitch… understandable because he’s fifteen and this is probably the highest concentration of bikinis he’s ever witnessed. He finally starts having fun when he realizes that Jordan is there, testing scuba equipment in the pool.</p>
<p>The virtually opposing approaches to life that Mitch and Chris represent is the focal point of the tale, the paragon of straight-laced nerd-dom juxtaposed with the free-wheeling, frenetic creativity that Knight gears his mind toward. Mitch is distraught by the fact that a student he’d previously idolized appears to be nothing more than another party-hard slacker who doesn’t seem to care one bit about their work they’re doing. It’s not until later that he finds out this attitude is new; Chris was once just like Mitch, but he relaxed into this new mindset when he followed a man into their dorm room closet. (I swear that’s not a metaphor.) That man—Lazlo Hollyfeld—was a big shot student at Pacific Tech in the decade previous, who went a little out of his mind when he found out that his inventions were being used to harm others. Seeing this, Chris realized that spending his life focused on work for work’s sake was a mistake.</p>
<p><a href="https://reactormag.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/real-genius6.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://reactormag.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/real-genius6.jpg" alt="Real Genius, Dr. Hathaway, William Atherton" width="740" height="359"></a></p>
<p>Unfortunately, Knight’s new groove is making it harder for Dr. Hathaway to meet his laser deadline, so the professor decides to spitefully ruin Chris’ life—giving Kent the post-school job he was already promised and flunking him out of the Pacific Tech program, preventing him from graduating. With a little pep talk from Mitch, Chris throws himself back into their project and makes real headway on the laser just to prove Hathaway wrong. It’s only after they deliver it to Hathaway that Lazlo leaves the steam tunnels below their closet and points out that what they created was likely intended for a very specific purpose—to kill people. From space. From that point on, the crew is on the clock to ruin the laser’s presentation for the military and CIA and to get even with Dr. Hathaway for using them. (Also to prank Kent because he kind of deserves it for being a lapdog and generally horrible to Mitch just because the kid is younger and smarter than he is.)</p>
<p>The film makes it a mission to prove that what geeks and geniuses are best at isn’t memorizing math formulas and elements off the periodic table; it’s their ability to be creative and in doing so, change the world around us. The students do get even with Dr. Hathaway, but they do it in an inspired way that essentially harms no one except him—they redirect the laser so it goes off at his home, where they’ve situated a giant ball of unpopped popcorn. <em>Ka-blooey.</em> Essentially, they destroy the thing that Hathaway was siphoning money off of the laser program to gain, his fancy house. It makes the project seem like a bust, effectively ruins Hathaway, and punishes him for being dishonest. As revenge schemes go, it’s a remarkably fair-minded one that’s fun to boot. And it’s not about proving their superiority over another group, but instead about taking back control over what they’ve created.</p>
<p><a href="https://reactormag.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/real-genius5.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://reactormag.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/real-genius5.jpg" alt="Real Genius, popcorn house" width="740" height="356"></a></p>
<p>The film doesn’t showcase as many women as we might hope for (and the Pacific Tech campus is also blindingly white overall, though Chris’ friend Ikagami is present and happily avoids most of your average Asian stereotypes aside from smartness), but the way it treats the majority of those women is impressive, particularly for this era in filmmaking… no doubt largely due to the movie’s female director, Martha Coolidge. There are few instances of pure objectification just for the sake of it in <em>Real Genius</em>; even though the co-ed party shows plenty of girls in swimsuits, the shots that reveal them are often at a distance, never lingering. While Knight is blunt in his sexual overtures to women, the ones he encounters are more than capable of tackling his advances and throwing them back in his face when he’s not up to snuff. His directness gives him no power, which is extremely important because it indicates that not every woman is automatically going to swoon over that kind of come-on. (Which, in turn, suggests that women are real, unique individuals with different preferences.) And when they aren’t interested, Chris is never entitled or angry about it—he simply moves on.</p>
<p>I really can’t talk about women in this film without focusing up on Jordan Cochran. While she does occupy a typically female place in the plot (Mitch’s love interest), her portrayal by Michelle Meyrink is nothing short of revelatory when it comes to broadening the variety of women that we should expect in fiction. To start, Jordan is not a conventionally attractive girl, certainly not in a California/feature film sense. She has a weird haircut and a child-like cadence to her voice, and she’s not particularly fashionable. It’s also entirely possible for this character to read somewhere on the autistic spectrum, though by way of a Hollywoodified lens; she is uncertain of common boundaries (visiting Mitch in the bathroom and being perturbed by his inability to pee in front of her), she has severe insomnia (it’s suggested that she drove her roommate to a nervous breakdown by never ever sleeping), she misunderstands the social cues of others (she frequently assumes the ends of Mitch’s sentences incorrectly), and her idea of what constitutes an everyday activity would hardly pass for your average citizen (Mitch finds her sanding her dorm room floor late one night and she uses the beautician party as an excuse to test a rebreather she designed herself). It’s not the fact that she might be on the spectrum itself that’s remarkable, but the fact that the film never suggests that Jordan should be viewed differently because of it. It doesn’t make her “special” in a manic pixie dream way, but it doesn’t make her pitiable either. She’s simply who she is, and that person is still portrayed as desirable and engaging and brilliant.</p>

<p>It helps that she’s very much her own kind of genius. Jordan makes most of her own equipment, clearly comfortable with a variety of tools and practical materials. She isn’t involved in the laser project whatsoever—in fact, we’re never told what Jordan is at Pacific Tech to do aside from being some sort of eclectic savant who cares about sled velocity on ice and the smoothness of her floors. She comes off as a kind of mad scientist, probably the sort of person to invent a few hundred incredibly useful patents throughout the course of her life and hopefully retire rich with a giant lab/workshop in her basement where she can create gorgeous metalwork in peace. Prior to <em>Real Genius</em>, Meyrink appeared in <em>Revenge of the Nerds</em> as one of the members of Omega Mu, the nerd girl sorority. In that movie, she and her Greek sisters were figures to be laughed at. Here, she is an odd force to be reckoned with. There is simply no comparison; one of these characters is inspirational to young women, and the other is decidedly not. In the end, Jordan’s status as Mitch’s girlfriend has very little to do with her place in the story (outside of letting her meet these characters and form friendships with them), an effective 180 from her position as&nbsp;Gilbert’s&nbsp;love interest&nbsp;in <em>Revenge of the Nerds</em>. Jordan is a heroic character in <em>Real Genius</em>, whereas Judy is largely a trophy for the (male) hero in <em>RotN</em>.</p>
<p>What’s also impressive about <em>Real Genius</em> is that it allows its focal character, Mitch Taylor, to be as young as he is, with all the embarrassment and strangeness that being fifteen entails. Mitch calls his parents crying because college isn’t working out the way he’d prefer, and he begs to come home. Mitch is cornered alone by an older, more experienced woman who clearly wants to teach him “the ways of the world,” but he runs from the scenario, owning up to his discomfort and knowing that he’d rather be with Jordan.<span>&nbsp; </span>The film never makes fun of Mitch for being less advanced than his peers or a perceived “square,” never sniggers at him for being the straight-laced one who cares about his work. It’s never suggested that he should simply play along, act older, learn to enjoy things that don’t interest him. Chris Knight has to convince him to loosen up by presenting real, hard data on why sticking too hard to the work might hurt him in the long run. And even then, Mitch doesn’t become a mini version of his mentor—he simply takes Knight’s advice to heart and figures out what his own version of relaxed is.</p>

<p>Rather than placing geeks on someone else’s playground, forcing them into an opposing socially-constructed box and proving that they can “play the game” better than everyone else by virtue of being smarter, <em>Real Genius</em> shows that nerds have their own games. They don’t need to run faster or get more pledges or give themselves makeovers to have fun and prove their worth. Mitch wakes up to a hall full of ice one morning; Ikagami has somehow created a gas that turns into the slippery stuff, and then back into a gas after a few hours. Chris hails the accomplishment as “Pacific Tech’s: Smart People on Ice!” The walls of the dorms are covered in strange graffiti, people shuffle back and forth between common areas and rooms in their weird-looking pajamas and towels. Knight has appointed himself as the dorm resident in charge of fun, trying to get people away from their books with “Mutant Hamster Races” and “Madame Curie Lookalike Contests.” In short, it’s like any other college campus, complete with overworked students. Nerds are not a rare and exotic breed of people, but they do make some awesome stuff, and that’s why they make for good movie plots.</p>
<p>It also helps that <em>Real Genius</em> might be one of the most quotable films on the planet. Even Joss Whedon would cry at how snappy the dialogue is, which is recommendation enough over most college movies where dialogue can be horrifically contrived. Chris Knight is the primary conduit of said snappiness, and you have to wonder how many of Kilmer’s lines are ad-libbed, because it seems like it might be a lot of them. It’s encouraging to have a character who at the start appears to be such a parody of himself—the super-smart-guy-who-can-also-be-a-jerk-because-he’s-good-looking-and-snarky—turn out to be a genuinely decent person who cares about people. And he proves that by changing his tactics with others; when he realizes that Mitch is not responding to devil-may-care antics, he quits the act and explains his reasons for exhibiting rather extreme senioritis. It comes clear very quickly that his primary reason for asking Dr. Hathaway to make Mitch his roommate is to make certain that Mitch doesn’t make his (or Lazlo’s) mistakes. Without realizing that they’re already being lured into the same gambit that snagged Lazlo years ago, Chris is already trying to provide Mitch with the tools he needs to avoid the scenario. He may be a cynic, as he says, but he’s inciting campus rowdiness to protect everyone’s health and expand their horizons, not to encourage them to blow their educations.</p>

<p>In that way, <em>Real Genius</em> occupies an interesting middle ground in how it portrays education for a film that’s all about brainy, bookish people. It’s not suggesting that going to college should be one long non-stop alcohol-fueled party haze, but it’s also not suggesting that what you learn at a higher education facility is the only valuable knowledge you will ever absorb. Life experience is shown to be equally (or even more) valuable. And while it can be easier to retreat into books when you’re a certain kind of person, the tale&nbsp;cautions that it’s important to&nbsp;stay aware of the world around you–otherwise you might miss when you’re being taken advantage of. For a film that’s already 30 years old, the wisdom it displays is universal; value your emotional development as much as your intellectual development; use your abilities to improve the world; question authority; definitely don’t make dangerous weapons for your college professors.</p>
<p>So you can keep <em>Revenge of the Nerds</em>, if that’s your thing, and all the other films of its ilk. They do a fairly poor job of committing the experience of social outsiders to memory. For a film that offers a chance to laugh with people rather than at them, to appreciate what college truly&nbsp;teaches most of us, to embrace what’s really fun about being an unabashed geek, I’d recommend <em>Real Genius</em> every single time.</p>
