<p>On behalf of the Thunderbird team, <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Modules/Thunderbird#Thunderbird_Council">Thunderbird Council</a>, our global community of contributors, and our extended Mozilla family, I am incredibly excited to announce the initial launch of Thunderbird 115 “Supernova” for Linux, macOS, and Windows! With this year’s version, we’re delivering much more than just another yearly release. Supernova represents a modernized overhaul of the software – both visually and technically – while retaining the familiarity and flexibility you expect from Thunderbird.</p>



<p>“Supernova is the beginning of a new era for Thunderbird,” says Ryan Sipes, Thunderbird’s Product and Business Development Manager. “It lays a beautiful, solid groundwork for future releases that will make Thunderbird a significantly better email client – and we won’t stop until it’s the best option out there.”</p>



<p>“During the past year we reworked some of the oldest parts of our code base with the goal of modernizing them to make maintenance and extensibility easier,” says Alex Castellani, Thunderbird’s Director of Product Engineering. “We did our best to strike a comfortable balance between new features and interface changes to appeal to new users, while maintaining the current layout and interface that millions of our users know and love. This is <a href="https://blog.thunderbird.net/2023/02/the-future-of-thunderbird-why-were-rebuilding-from-the-ground-up/">the first step</a> towards a more flexible, reliable, and customizable Thunderbird that will accommodate different needs, preferences, and workflows.”</p>



<p>Here’s a brief look at some of the best new features and improvements in Thunderbird 115. For the complete list, please visit <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/new-thunderbird-115-supernova">this support article</a>.</p>

<h3>Modernized Cards View</h3>



<figure><a href="https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2023/07/115.png"><img decoding="async" width="1680" height="1050" src="https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2023/07/115.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2023/07/115.png 1680w, https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2023/07/115-252x158.png 252w, https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2023/07/115-600x375.png 600w, https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2023/07/115-768x480.png 768w, https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2023/07/115-1536x960.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1680px) 100vw, 1680px"></a></figure>



<p>Supernova’s new Card View is our version of the well-known vertical layout for the Message List, perfect for people used to modern webmail. Card View emulates a mobile interface list with multi-line support, offering a more comfortable appearance to reduce cognitive burden. (And because we want Supernova to feel familiar for veteran users, the legacy “Table” view is still available.)</p>



<h3>Brand New Thunderbird Logo</h3>



<p>Supernova ships with a brand new Thunderbird logo honoring our history and vital connection to Mozilla, while representing the revitalization of our brand and a promising, sustainable future.</p>


<div>
<figure><a href="https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2023/07/appmenu-default.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2023/07/appmenu-default.png" alt="" width="189" height="297" srcset="https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2023/07/appmenu-default.png 273w, https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2023/07/appmenu-default-252x396.png 252w" sizes="(max-width: 189px) 100vw, 189px"></a><figcaption>New Thunderbird AppMenu ≡</figcaption></figure></div>


<h3>Dynamic Unified Toolbar</h3>



<p>Supernova features a single dynamic toolbar, presenting frequently used and contextual options based on the tab or Space that is currently active. Take full control by customizing the toolbar and window layout to perfectly fit your workflow.</p>



<h3>Intuitive AppMenu</h3>



<p>The new Application Menu (≡) in Supernova is now keyboard-accessible, and redesigned for faster, easier navigation. Fewer submenus, persistent global options, and consistent iconography combine to create a much more intuitive experience.</p>



<h3>Improved Calendar Design</h3>



<figure><a href="https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2023/07/cal.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2023/07/cal.png" alt="" width="840" height="531" srcset="https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2023/07/cal.png 1554w, https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2023/07/cal-252x160.png 252w, https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2023/07/cal-600x380.png 600w, https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2023/07/cal-768x486.png 768w, https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2023/07/cal-1536x973.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px"></a></figure>



<p>As part of an ongoing effort to modernize and upgrade Thunderbird’s Calendar, Supernova introduces an improved “mini-month” layout, improvements to the day/week/month grid, a pleasing color palette, and several more minor changes.</p>



<h3>Elegant Density Control</h3>



<figure><a href="https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2023/07/Appmenu_Density@2x.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2023/07/Appmenu_Density@2x.png" alt="" width="596" height="596" srcset="https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2023/07/Appmenu_Density@2x.png 1400w, https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2023/07/Appmenu_Density@2x-252x252.png 252w, https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2023/07/Appmenu_Density@2x-600x600.png 600w, https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2023/07/Appmenu_Density@2x-160x160.png 160w, https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2023/07/Appmenu_Density@2x-768x768.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 596px) 100vw, 596px"></a><figcaption>Change your density setting and font size easily from the new AppMenu</figcaption></figure>



<p>Working with multiple monitors and display resolutions? Supernova lets you dial in the perfect density settings and font sizes for the entire application, with just a single click from the AppMenu.</p>



<h3>New + Sortable Folder Modes</h3>


<div>
<figure><a href="https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2023/07/folderpane.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2023/07/folderpane.png" alt="" width="218" height="528" srcset="https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2023/07/folderpane.png 284w, https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2023/07/folderpane-252x610.png 252w" sizes="(max-width: 218px) 100vw, 218px"></a></figure></div>


<p>Supernova gives you more control by introducing sortable Folder Modes. Display all of your Tags in the Folder Pane, turn on and off Local Folders, or move your favorite Folder Mode sections up and down with one click. Less scrolling, more productivity.</p>



<h3>Eye-Catching Tags View</h3>



<p>Tags are a familiar and powerful part of your workflow, so Supernova adds an eye-catching “Tags” view to the Folder Pane. Quickly jump to your custom, color-coded tag categories to find and filter your messages even faster.</p>



<h3>Improved Address Book</h3>



<p>Supernova continues to iterate on the modernized Address Book introduced in Thunderbird 102. You’ll enjoy a new tabular view, an improved Edit view, delete buttons, and better accessibility.</p>



<h3>Better Accessibility</h3>



<p>Speaking of accessibility, Supernova substantially improves Thunderbird’s keyboard navigation and screen reader accessibility across the entire application. We’ve also greatly expanded the ability to navigate Mail content and buttons using the TAB and arrow keys.</p>



<h3>More To Come…</h3>



<p>Supernova is constantly evolving. Throughout the next year, we’ll deliver many improvements to existing Supernova features and introduce brand new ones, including Thunderbird Sync. Upgrade to version 115 and experience the future of Thunderbird!</p>



<hr>



<h3>How To Get Thunderbird 115 “Supernova”</h3>



<p>As with any major release, we sometimes become aware of corner cases after significant public testing. The Thunderbird team will wait to enable automatic updates until we’re confident no such issues exist. We’ll keep you posted right here, and on social media platforms. (Existing Thunderbird 102 users will continue to see security updates during this time).&nbsp;</p>



<p>On Linux, the timing of this release and subsequent automatic updates may be determined by your distribution’s maintainers. If it’s convenient for you, we recommend installing the <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/org.mozilla.Thunderbird">Thunderbird Flatpak from Flathub</a>, which is now packaged and maintained by the Thunderbird team.&nbsp;(Please note that 115 is <em>not </em>live on Flathub at time of publication, but as always we’ll keep you updated.)</p>



<p>If you don’t want to wait for an automatic update, Thunderbird 115 is also available to download directly at <a href="https://thunderbird.net/">thunderbird.net</a> for Windows, Linux, and macOS. </p>

<p>Yesterday, Congress members revealed the <a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Attacks%20on%20Tax%20Privacy_Formatted.pdf">results</a> of a seven-month investigation into tax-filing companies. Lawmakers found that H&amp;R Block, TaxAct, and TaxSlayer "recklessly shared" potentially hundreds of millions of taxpayers' sensitive personal and financial data with Google and Meta "for years" in apparent violation of laws prohibiting tax preparers from sharing tax return information without customers' consent.</p>
<p>In a press release provided to Ars from the office of Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), lawmakers alleged a "massive, likely illegal breach of taxpayer privacy." Insisting upon urgent redress, lawmakers are now calling upon the Department of Justice, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the Federal Trade Commission, and the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration to "fully investigate this matter and prosecute any company or individuals who violated the law."</p>
<p>The Congress members' report said that "any tax return preparer who 'knowingly or recklessly discloses'" tax return information "is subject to a fine up to $1,000 per violation, and a prison term of up to one year."</p>
<p>"The companies shared millions of taxpayers’ tax return data, meaning they could face billions of dollars in potential criminal liability," lawmakers wrote in a <a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2023.07.11%20Letter%20to%20IRS,%20TIGTA,%20FTC,%20DOJ%20on%20tax%20prep%20pixel%20data%20sharing.pdf">letter</a> to federal agencies.</p>
<p>For its investigation, congressional staff interviewed representatives at tax-filing sites, as well as at Meta and Google. These interviews uncovered what their report said was "a troubling pattern and practice of data sharing by tax prep companies, a complete lack of corporate responsibility and accountability on the part of tax prep companies and Big Tech firms, and a potentially illegal use of sensitive taxpayer information."</p>
<p>"Under the law, 'a tax return preparer may not disclose or use a taxpayer’s tax return information prior to obtaining a written consent from the taxpayer,'" lawmakers' letter said.</p>
<p>The only exception allows for data sharing with "auxiliary service providers" working "in connection with the preparation of a tax return." However, lawmakers said that "Meta and Google likely do not meet the definition of 'auxiliary service providers,'" partly because "the data sharing with Meta was for advertising purposes—not 'in connection with the preparation of a tax return.'"</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>The congressional probe followed a bombshell <a href="https://themarkup.org/pixel-hunt/2022/11/22/tax-filing-websites-have-been-sending-users-financial-information-to-facebook">report</a> from The Markup in November 2022, revealing that tax-filing websites had been sharing customers' sensitive financial information with Meta. After being contacted by The Markup, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/11/major-tax-filing-websites-secretly-share-income-data-with-meta/">all three tax-filing websites confirmed</a> that they'd removed or disabled the Meta Pixel tracking tools that were gathering sensitive data.</p>
<p>But while tax-filing websites were quick to stop collecting data, nobody's sure how much information was collected. One unnamed company told Congress that "every single taxpayer who used their websites could have had at least some of their data shared."</p>
<p>Lawmakers in their letter called tax prep companies "untrustworthy and incompetent." Attempting to research if tax prep companies had gained consent to disclose and use data from its users, Congress was blocked by the companies, who refused to "provide current and historical versions of disclosure agreements and privacy policies." Undeterred, Congress consulted Internet archives to access historical versions of company policies and pieced together that none of the companies appeared to have gained consent from their customers to share the sensitive data with Meta and Google.</p>
<p>TaxSlayer and H&amp;R Block did not immediately responded to Ars' request to comment, but a TaxAct spokesperson told Ars that the company cooperated with lawmakers and works to protect user privacy.</p>
<p>"TaxAct has engaged with Senator Warren and her staff to provide transparent, detailed explanations on our use of these standard analytics tools," TaxAct's spokesperson told Ars. "TaxAct has always complied with laws that protect our customers’ privacy and, as noted in the report, we disabled the tools in question while we evaluated potential concerns. Protecting the rights and privacy of our customers is our top priority, and we are committed to engaging with stakeholders to address any concerns and to help advance public policy."</p>
<p>A Meta spokesperson told Ars that Meta stands by a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/11/major-tax-filing-websites-secretly-share-income-data-with-meta/">statement provided to Ars</a> last year, saying that “advertisers should not send sensitive information about people through our business tools. Doing so is against our policies and we educate advertisers on properly setting up business tools to prevent this from occurring. Our system is designed to filter out potentially sensitive data it is able to detect.”</p>
<p>A Google spokesperson told Ars that the company has "strict policies and technical features that prohibit Google Analytics customers from collecting data that could be used to identify an individual. Site owners—not Google —are in control of what information they collect and must inform their users of how it will be used. Additionally, Google has strict policies against advertising to people based on sensitive information.”</p>

We run apps for our users on hardware we host around the world. Building security for a platform like this is tricky, and that's what the post is about. But you don't have to read any of this to get an app running on here. See how to <a href="https://fly.io/docs/speedrun/">speedrun getting an app running on Fly.io here</a>.</p><p>We built some little security thingies. We're open sourcing them, and hoping you like them as much as we do. In a nutshell: it's a proxy that injects secrets into arbitrary 3rd-party API calls. We could describe it more completely here, but that wouldn't be as fun as writing a big long essay about how the thingies came to be, so: buckle up.</p> <p>The problem we confront is as old as Rails itself. Our application started simple: some controllers, some models. The only secrets it stored were bcrypt password hashes. But not unlike a pet baby alligator, it grew up. Now it's become more unruly than we'd planned.</p> <p>That's because frameworks like Rails make it easy to collect secrets: you just create another model for them, <a href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_encryption.html">roll some kind of secret to encrypt them</a>, jam that secret into the deployment environment, and call it a day.</p> <p>And, at least in less sensitive applications, or even the early days of an app like ours, that can work!</p> <p> For what it's worth, and to the annoyance of some of our Heroku refugees, we've never stored customer app secrets this way; our Rails API can write customer secrets, but has never been able to read them. We'll talk more about how this works in a sec.</p><p>But for us, not anymore. At the stage we're at, all secrets are hazmat. And Rails itself is the portion of our attack surface we're least confident about –&nbsp;the rest of it is either outside of our trust boundaries, or written in Rust and Go, strongly-typed memory-safe languages that are easy to reason about, and which have never accidentally treated YAML as an executable file format.</p> <p>So, a few months back, during an integration with a 3rd party API that relied on OAuth2 tokens, we drew a line: ⚡ <em>henceforth, hazmat shall only be removed from Rails, never added</em> ⚡. This is easier said than done, though: despite prominent "this is not a place of honor" signs all over the codebase, our Rails API is still where much of the action in our system takes place.</p> <h3 id="how-apps-use-secrets-3-different-approaches"><a href="#how-apps-use-secrets-3-different-approaches" aria-label="Anchor"></a>How Apps Use Secrets: 3 Different Approaches</h3><p><img src="https://fly.io/blog/2023-07-12/secrets-1.png?2/3&amp;card&amp;center" alt=""></p> <p>We just gave you one way, probably the most common. Stick 'em in a model, encrypt them with an environment secret, and watch Dependabot religiously for vulnerabilities in transitively-added libraries you've never heard of before.</p> <p><img src="https://fly.io/blog/2023-07-12/secrets-2.png?2/3&amp;card&amp;center" alt=""></p> <p>Here's a second way, probably the second-most popular: use a secrets management system, like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kms/">KMS</a> or <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/products/vault">Vault</a>. These systems, which are great, keep secrets encrypted and allow access based on an intricate access control language, which is great.</p> <p>That's what we do for customer app secrets, like <code>DATABASE_URL</code> and <code>API_KEY</code>. We use <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/products/vault">HashiCorp Vault</a> (for the time being). Our Rails API has an access token for Vault that allows it to set secrets, but not read any of them back, like a kind of diode. A game-over Rails vulnerability might allow an attacker to scramble secrets, but not to easily dump them.</p> <p>In the happiest cases with secrets, systems like Vault can keep secret bits from ever touching the application. Customer app secrets are a happy case: Rails never needs to read them, <a href="https://fly.io/blog/carving-the-scheduler-out-of-our-orchestrator/">just our orchestrator</a>, to inject them into VM environments. In other happy cases, Vault operates on the app's behalf: signing a time-limited request URL for AWS, or making a direct request to a known 3rd-party service. Vault calls these features "<a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/secrets">secret engines</a>", and when you can get away with using them, it's hard to do better.</p> <p>The catch is, sometimes you can't get away with them. For most 3rd parties, Vault has no idea how to interact with them. And most secrets are bearer tokens, not request signatures. The only way to use those kinds of secrets is to read them into app memory. If good code can read a secret from Vault, so can a YAML vulnerability.</p> <p> Still: this is better than nothing: even if apps can read raw secrets, systems like Vault can provide an audit trail of which secrets were pulled when, and make it much easier to rotate secrets, which you'll want to do with raw secrets to contain their blast radius. HashiCorp Vault is great, so is KMS, we recommend them unreservedly.</p><p><img src="https://fly.io/blog/2023-07-12/secrets-3.png?2/3&amp;card&amp;center" alt=""></p> <p>So that's why there's a third way to handle this problem, which is: decompose your application into services so that the parts that have to handle secrets are tiny and well-contained. The bulk of our domain-specific business code can chug along in Rails, and the parts that trade bearer tokens with 3rd parties can be built in a couple hundred lines of Go.</p> <p>This is a good approach, too. It's just cumbersome, because a big application ends up dealing with lots of different kinds of secrets, making a trusted microservice for each of them is a drag. What you want is to notice some commonality in how 3rd party API secrets are used, and to come up with some possible way of exploiting that.</p> <p>We thought long and hard on this and came up with:</p> <h3 id="tokenizer-the-fabled-4th-way"><a href="#tokenizer-the-fabled-4th-way" aria-label="Anchor"></a>Tokenizer: The Fabled 4th Way</h3><p><img src="https://fly.io/blog/2023-07-12/secrets-4.png?2/3&amp;card&amp;center" alt=""></p> <p>We developed a multipurpose secret-using service called the <code>Tokenizer</code>.</p> <p><code>Tokenizer</code> is a stateless HTTP proxy that holds the private key of a <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/crypto/nacl/box">Curve25519 keypair.</a></p> <p>When we get a new 3rd party API secret, we encrypt it to <code>Tokenizer's</code> public key; we "tokenize" it. Our API server can handle the (encrypted) tokenized secret, but it can't read or use it directly. Only <code>Tokenizer</code> can.</p> <p>When it comes time to talk to the 3rd party API, Rails does so via <code>Tokenizer</code>. Here's how that works:</p> <ol> <li>The API request is proxied, as an ordinary HTTP 1.1 request, through <code>Tokenizer</code>. </li><li>The request carries one or more additional <code>Proxy-Tokenizer</code> headers. </li><li>Each <code>Proxy-Tokenizer</code> header carries an encrypted secret and instructions for <code>Tokenizer</code> to rewrite the request in some way, usually by injecting the decrypted plaintext into a header. </li></ol> <p>You can think of <code>Tokenizer</code> as a sort of Vault-style "secret engine" that happens to capture virtually everything an app needs secrets for. It can even use decrypted secrets to selectively HMAC parts of requests, for APIs that authenticate with signatures instead of bearer tokens.</p> <p>Check it out: <a href="https://github.com/superfly/tokenizer">it's not super complicated</a>.</p> <p>Now, our goal is to keep Rails from ever touching secret bits. But, hold on: a game-over Rails vulnerability would give attackers an easy way around <code>Tokenizer</code>: you'd just proxy requests for a particular secret to a service you ran that collected the plaintext.</p> <p>To mitigate that, we built the obvious feature: you can lock requests for specific secrets down to a list of allowed hosts or host regexp patterns.</p> <p>We think this approach to handling secrets is pretty similar to how payment processors tokenize payment card information, hence the name. The advantages are straightforward:</p> <ul> <li>Secrets are exposed to a much smaller attack surface that doesn't include Rails. </li><li>Virtually every usage of secrets we're likely to run across is captured by HTTP proxying, without us needing to write per-service code. </li><li>The tokenizer is a tiny project that's easy to audit and reason about. </li><li>Every language we work in already has first-class support for running requests through a proxy (something we already do for <a href="https://github.com/stripe/smokescreen">SSRF protection</a>.) </li></ul> <h3 id="ssokenizer-tokenizing-oauth-sso"><a href="#ssokenizer-tokenizing-oauth-sso" aria-label="Anchor"></a>SSOkenizer: Tokenizing OAuth SSO</h3><p>When we created <code>Tokenizer</code>, we were motivated by the problem of OAuth2 tokens other services providers gave us, for partnership features we build for mutual customers.</p> <p>We'd also dearly like our customers to use OAuth2/OIDC to log into Fly.io itself; it's more secure for them, and gives them the full complement of Google MFA features, meaning we don't immediately have to implement the full complement of Google MFA features. Letting people log into Fly.io with a Google OAuth token means we have to keep track of people's OAuth tokens. That sounds like a job for the <code>Tokenizer</code>!</p> <p>But there's a catch: acquiring those OAuth tokens in the first place means doing the OAuth2 dance, which means that for a brief window of time, Rails is handling hazmat. We'd like to close that window.</p> <p><img src="https://fly.io/blog/2023-07-12/ssokenizer.png?2/3&amp;card&amp;center" alt=""></p> <p>Enter the <code>SSOkenizer</code>.</p> <p>The job of the <code>SSOkenizer</code> is to perform the OAuth2 dance on behalf of Rails, and then use the output of that process (the OAuth2 bearer token yielded from the OAuth2 code flow, which you can <a href="https://github.com/superfly/ssokenizer#ssokenizer">see in its cursed majesty here</a>) to drive the <code>Tokenizer</code>.</p> <p>In other words, where we'd otherwise explicitly encrypt secrets to be tokenized a-priori, the <code>SSOkenizer</code> does that on the fly, passing tokenized OAuth2 credentials back to Rails. Those… tokenized tokens can only be used through the <code>Tokenizer</code> proxy, which is the only component in our system with the private key that unseals them.</p> <p>We think this is a pretty neat trick. The <code>SSOkenizer</code> itself is tiny, even smaller than the <code>Tokenizer</code> (<a href="https://github.com/superfly/ssokenizer/">you can read it here</a>), and essentially stateless; in fact, pretty much everything in this system is minimally stateful, except Rails, which is great at being stateful. We even keep almost all of OAuth2 out of Rails and confined to Go code (where it's practically the hello-world of Go OAuth2 libraries).</p> <p>A nice side effect-slash-validation of this design: once we got it working for Google, it became a super easy project to get OAuth2 logins working for other providers.</p> <h3 id="feel-free-to-poach-this"><a href="#feel-free-to-poach-this" aria-label="Anchor"></a>Feel Free To Poach This</h3><p>We're psyched for a bunch of reasons:</p> <ul> <li>We've got a clear path to rolling out SSO logins. </li><li>We can do integrations with third-party services now without infecting Rails with more hazmat secrets. </li><li>We've honored the rule of "only removing hazmat from Rails, not adding it". </li><li>We've also cleared a path to getting all the rest of the hazmat Rails has access to tokenized. </li></ul> <p>These are standalone tools with no real dependencies on Fly.io, so they're easy for us to open source. Which is what we did: if they sound useful to you, check out the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/superfly/tokenizer">tokenizer</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/superfly/ssokenizer">ssokenizer</a>&nbsp;repositories for instructions on deploying and using these services yourself.</p>  </section> <dl> <dt> Previous post&nbsp;&nbsp;↓ </dt> <dd> <a href="https://fly.io/blog/flydotio-heart-bun/"> Fly.io ❤️ Bun </a> </dd> </dl> </article></div>]]></description>

<p><b>Telling the bees</b> is a tradition in many European countries in which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bee" title="Bee">bees</a> would be told of important events in their keeper's lives such as deaths, births, marriages and departures and returns in the household. If the custom was omitted or forgotten and the bees were not "put into mourning" then it was believed a penalty would be paid, such as the bees leaving their hive, stopping the production of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honey" title="Honey">honey</a> or dying.<sup id="cite_ref-Drake2001_1-0"><a href="#cite_note-Drake2001-1">[1]</a></sup>

<p>Following a death in the household there were several ways in which bees were to be informed and therefore put into proper mourning.
</p><p>
The process is described in 1901 work of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Adams_Drake" title="Samuel Adams Drake">Samuel Adams Drake</a> <i>A book of New England legends and folk lore in prose and poetry</i>: </p><blockquote><p>...goodwife of the house to go and hang the stand of hives with black, the usual symbol of mourning, she at the same time softly humming some doleful tune to herself.<sup id="cite_ref-Drake2001_1-1"><a href="#cite_note-Drake2001-1">[1]</a></sup></p></blockquote><p> One such ‘tune’ from Nottinghamshire had the woman (either a spouse or other caretaker) say "The master's dead, but don't you go; Your mistress will be a good mistress to you."<sup id="cite_ref-:0_2-2"><a href="#cite_note-:0-2">[2]</a></sup> Another similar oration recorded in Germany went "Little bee, our lord is dead; Leave me not in my distress."<sup id="cite_ref-:1_5-1"><a href="#cite_note-:1-5">[5]</a></sup>
</p><p>Another method involved the male head of the household approaching the hive and knocking gently on it until "the bees’ attention was thus secured" and then saying "in a low voice that such or such a person - mentioning the name - was dead."<sup id="cite_ref-Drake2001_1-2"><a href="#cite_note-Drake2001-1">[1]</a></sup> The key to the family home could also be used as a knocker.<sup id="cite_ref-Roud2006_3-1"><a href="#cite_note-Roud2006-3">[3]</a></sup>
</p><p>One description from the Carolina mountains in the United States says that "You knock on each hive, so, and say, 'Lucy is dead.'"<sup id="cite_ref-:1_5-2"><a href="#cite_note-:1-5">[5]</a></sup>

</p><p>A section from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Greenleaf_Whittier" title="John Greenleaf Whittier">John Greenleaf Whittier</a>'s poem "Tell the Bees" describes the practice:
</p>
<blockquote><div><p>Before them, under the garden wall,<br>
Forward and back<br>
Went, drearily singing, the chore-girl small,<br>
Draping each hive with a shred of black.</p><p>

Trembling, I listened; the summer sun<br>
Had the chill of snow;<br>
For I knew she was telling the bees of one<br>
Gone on the journey we all must go!</p><p>

"Stay at home, pretty bees, fly not hence!<br>
Mistress Mary is dead and gone!"
</p></div></blockquote>
<p>In the <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midsomer_Murders" title="Midsomer Murders">Midsomer Murders</a></i> episode "The Killings at Badger's Drift" (series 1 episode 1), a minor character remarks that a deceased character's bees must be informed of her death or they will "just clear off". The custom is also explained in "The Sting of Death" (series 21 episode 3) and the bees are in mourning with black cloth on the beehives. The ninth book in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana_Gabaldon" title="Diana Gabaldon">Diana Gabaldon</a>'s <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outlander_(book_series)" title="Outlander (book series)">Outlander</a></i> series is entitled <i>Go Tell the Bees that I am Gone</i>.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://xata.io/blog/postgres-full-text-search-engine">https://xata.io/blog/postgres-full-text-search-engine</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36699016">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This is part 1 of a blog mini-series, in which we explore the full-text search functionality in PostgreSQL and investigate how much of the typical search engine functionality we can replicate. In part 2, we'll do a comparison between PostgreSQL's full-text search and Elasticsearch.</p>
<p>If you want to follow along and try out the sample queries (which we recommend; it's more fun that way), the code samples are executed against the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jrobischon/wikipedia-movie-plots">Wikipedia Movie Plots</a> data set from Kaggle. To import it, download the CSV file, then create this table:</p>
<div role="group" data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre data-theme="default" tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span data-line=""><span>CREATE</span><span> </span><span>TABLE</span><span> </span><span>movies</span><span>(</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>	ReleaseYear </span><span>int</span><span>,</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>	Title </span><span>text</span><span>,</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>	Origin </span><span>text</span><span>,</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>	Director </span><span>text</span><span>,</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>	Casting </span><span>text</span><span>,</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>	Genre </span><span>text</span><span>,</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>	WikiPage </span><span>text</span><span>,</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>	Plot </span><span>text</span><span>);</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>And import the CSV file like this:</p>
<div role="group" data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre data-theme="default" tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span data-line=""><span>\</span><span>COPY</span><span> movies(ReleaseYear, Title, Origin, Director, Casting, Genre, WikiPage, Plot)</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>	</span><span>FROM</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>wiki_movie_plots_deduped.csv</span><span>'</span><span> DELIMITER </span><span>'</span><span>,</span><span>'</span><span> CSV HEADER;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The dataset contains 34,000 movie titles and is about 81 MB in CSV format.</p>

<p>The Postgres approach to full-text search offers building blocks that you can combine to create your own search engine. This is quite flexible but it also means it generally feels lower-level compared to search engines like Elasticsearch, Typesense, or Mellisearch, for which full-text search is the primary use case.</p>
<p>The main building blocks, which we'll cover via examples, are:</p>
<ul role="list"><li>The <code>tsvector</code> and <code>tsquery</code> data types</li><li>The match operator <code>@@</code> to check if a <code>tsquery</code> matches a <code>tsvector</code></li><li>Functions to rank each match (<code>ts_rank</code>, <code>ts_rank_cd</code>)</li><li>The GIN index type, an inverted index to efficiently query <code>tsvector</code></li></ul>
<p>We'll start by looking at these building blocks and then we'll get into more advanced topics, covering relevancy boosters, typo-tolerance, and faceted search.</p>

<p>The <code>tsvector</code> data type stores a sorted list of <em>lexemes</em>. A <em>lexeme</em> is a string, just like a token, but it has been <em>normalized</em> so that different forms of the same word are made. For example, normalization almost always includes folding upper-case letters to lower-case, and often involves removal of suffixes (such as <code>s</code> or <code>ing</code> in English). Here is an example, using the <code>to_tsvector</code> function to parse an English phrase into a <code>tsvector</code>.</p>
<div role="group" data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre data-theme="default" tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span data-line=""><span>SELECT</span><span> </span><span>*</span><span> </span><span>FROM</span><span> unnest(to_tsvector(</span><span>'</span><span>english</span><span>'</span><span>,</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>	</span><span>'</span><span>I</span><span>''</span><span>m going to make him an offer he can</span><span>''</span><span>t refuse. Refusing is not an option.</span><span>'</span><span>));</span></span>
<span data-line=""> </span>
<span data-line=""><span> lexeme | positions | weights</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>--------+-----------+---------</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> </span><span>go</span><span>     | {</span><span>3</span><span>}       | {D}</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> m      | {</span><span>2</span><span>}       | {D}</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> make   | {</span><span>5</span><span>}       | {D}</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> offer  | {</span><span>8</span><span>}       | {D}</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> </span><span>option</span><span> | {</span><span>17</span><span>}      | {D}</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> refus  | {</span><span>12</span><span>,</span><span>13</span><span>}   | {D,D}</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>(</span><span>6</span><span> </span><span>rows</span><span>)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>As you can see, stop words like “I”, “to” or “an” are removed, because they are too common to be useful for search. The words are normalized and reduced to their root (e.g. “refuse” and “Refusing” are both transformed into “refus”). The punctuation signs are ignored. For each word, the <strong>positions</strong> in the original phrase are recorded (e.g. “refus” is the 12th and the 13th word in the text) and the <strong>weights</strong> (which are useful for ranking and we'll discuss later).</p>
<p>In the example above, the transformation rules from words to <em>lexemes</em> are based on the <code>english</code> search configuration. Running the same query with the <code>simple</code> search configuration results in a <code>tsvector</code> that includes all the words as they were found in the text:</p>
<div role="group" data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre data-theme="default" tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span data-line=""><span>SELECT</span><span> </span><span>*</span><span> </span><span>FROM</span><span> unnest(to_tsvector(</span><span>'</span><span>simple</span><span>'</span><span>,</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>	</span><span>'</span><span>I</span><span>''</span><span>m going to make him an offer he can</span><span>''</span><span>t refuse. Refusing is not an option.</span><span>'</span><span>));</span></span>
<span data-line=""> </span>
<span data-line=""><span>  lexeme  | positions | weights</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>----------+-----------+---------</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> an       | {</span><span>7</span><span>,</span><span>16</span><span>}    | {D,D}</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> can      | {</span><span>10</span><span>}      | {D}</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> going    | {</span><span>3</span><span>}       | {D}</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> he       | {</span><span>9</span><span>}       | {D}</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> him      | {</span><span>6</span><span>}       | {D}</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> i        | {</span><span>1</span><span>}       | {D}</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> </span><span>is</span><span>       | {</span><span>14</span><span>}      | {D}</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> m        | {</span><span>2</span><span>}       | {D}</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> make     | {</span><span>5</span><span>}       | {D}</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> </span><span>not</span><span>      | {</span><span>15</span><span>}      | {D}</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> offer    | {</span><span>8</span><span>}       | {D}</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> </span><span>option</span><span>   | {</span><span>17</span><span>}      | {D}</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> refuse   | {</span><span>12</span><span>}      | {D}</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> refusing | {</span><span>13</span><span>}      | {D}</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> t        | {</span><span>11</span><span>}      | {D}</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> </span><span>to</span><span>       | {</span><span>4</span><span>}       | {D}</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>(</span><span>16</span><span> </span><span>rows</span><span>)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>As you can see, “refuse” and “refusing” now result in different lexemes. The <code>simple</code> configuration is particularly useful when you have columns that contain labels or tags.</p>
<p>PostgreSQL has built-in configurations for a pretty good set of languages. You can see the list by running:</p>
<div role="group" data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre data-theme="default" tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span data-line=""><span>SELECT</span><span> cfgname </span><span>FROM</span><span> pg_ts_config;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Notably, however, there is no configuration for CJK (Chinese-Japanese-Korean), which is worth keeping in mind if you need to create a search query in those languages. While the <code>simple</code> configuration should work in practice quite well for unsupported languages, I'm not sure if that is enough for CJK.</p>

<p>The <code>tsquery</code> data type is used to represent a normalized query. A <code>tsquery</code> contains search terms, which must be already-normalized lexemes, and may combine multiple terms using AND, OR, NOT, and FOLLOWED BY operators. There are functions like <code>to_tsquery</code>, <code>plainto_tsquery</code>, and <code>websearch_to_tsquery</code> that are helpful in converting user-written text into a proper <code>tsquery</code>, primarily by normalizing words appearing in the text.</p>
<p>To get a feeling of <code>tsquery</code>, let's see a few examples using <code>websearch_to_tsquery</code>:</p>
<div role="group" data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre data-theme="default" tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span data-line=""><span>SELECT</span><span> websearch_to_tsquery(</span><span>'</span><span>english</span><span>'</span><span>, </span><span>'</span><span>the dark vader</span><span>'</span><span>);</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> websearch_to_tsquery</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>----------------------</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>'</span><span>dark</span><span>'</span><span> &amp; </span><span>'</span><span>vader</span><span>'</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>That is a logical AND, meaning that the document needs to contain both “quick” and “dog” in order to match. You can do logical OR as well:</p>
<div role="group" data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre data-theme="default" tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span data-line=""><span>SELECT</span><span> websearch_to_tsquery(</span><span>'</span><span>english</span><span>'</span><span>, </span><span>'</span><span>quick OR dog</span><span>'</span><span>);</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> websearch_to_tsquery</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>----------------------</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> </span><span>'</span><span>dark</span><span>'</span><span> | </span><span>'</span><span>vader</span><span>'</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>And you can exclude words:</p>
<div role="group" data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre data-theme="default" tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span data-line=""><span>SELECT</span><span> websearch_to_tsquery(</span><span>'</span><span>english</span><span>'</span><span>, </span><span>'</span><span>dark vader -wars</span><span>'</span><span>);</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>   websearch_to_tsquery</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>---------------------------</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> </span><span>'</span><span>dark</span><span>'</span><span> &amp; </span><span>'</span><span>vader</span><span>'</span><span> &amp; !</span><span>'</span><span>war</span><span>'</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Also, you can represent phrase searches:</p>
<div role="group" data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre data-theme="default" tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span data-line=""><span>SELECT</span><span> websearch_to_tsquery(</span><span>'</span><span>english</span><span>'</span><span>, </span><span>'</span><span>"the dark vader son"</span><span>'</span><span>);</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>     websearch_to_tsquery</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>------------------------------</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> </span><span>'</span><span>dark</span><span>'</span><span> </span><span>&lt;-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>vader</span><span>'</span><span> </span><span>&lt;-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>son</span><span>'</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This means: “dark”, followed by “vader”, followed by “son”.</p>
<p>Note, however, that the “the” word is ignored, because it's a stop word as per the <code>english</code> search configuration. This can be an issue on phrases like this:</p>
<div role="group" data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre data-theme="default" tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span data-line=""><span>SELECT</span><span> websearch_to_tsquery(</span><span>'</span><span>english</span><span>'</span><span>, </span><span>'</span><span>"do or do not, there is no try"</span><span>'</span><span>);</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> websearch_to_tsquery</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>----------------------</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> </span><span>'</span><span>tri</span><span>'</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>(</span><span>1</span><span> </span><span>row</span><span>)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Oops, almost the entire phrase was lost. Using the <code>simple</code> config gives the expected result:</p>
<div role="group" data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre data-theme="default" tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span data-line=""><span>SELECT</span><span> websearch_to_tsquery(</span><span>'</span><span>simple</span><span>'</span><span>, </span><span>'</span><span>"do or do not, there is no try"</span><span>'</span><span>);</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>                           websearch_to_tsquery</span></span>

<p>While the following example doesn't match:</p>
<div role="group" data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre data-theme="default" tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span data-line=""><span>SELECT</span><span> websearch_to_tsquery(</span><span>'</span><span>english</span><span>'</span><span>, </span><span>'</span><span>dark vader -father</span><span>'</span><span>) @@</span></span>

<span data-line=""><span>?column?</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>----------</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> f</span></span></code></pre></div>

<p>Now that we've seen <code>tsvector</code> and <code>tsquery</code> at work, let's look at another key building block: the GIN index type is what makes it fast. GIN stands for <em>Generalized Inverted Index.</em> GIN is designed for handling cases where the items to be indexed are composite values, and the queries to be handled by the index need to search for element values that appear within the composite items. This means that GIN can be used for more than just text search, notably for JSON querying.</p>
<p>You can create a GIN index on a set of columns, or you can first create a column of type <code>tsvector</code>, to include all the searchable columns. Something like this:</p>
<div role="group" data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre data-theme="default" tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span data-line=""><span>ALTER</span><span> </span><span>TABLE</span><span> movies </span><span>ADD</span><span> search tsvector </span><span>GENERATED</span><span> </span><span>ALWAYS</span><span> </span><span>AS</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>	(to_tsvector(</span><span>'</span><span>english</span><span>'</span><span>, Title) </span><span>||</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span> </span><span>||</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>   to_tsvector(</span><span>'</span><span>english</span><span>'</span><span>, Plot) </span><span>||</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span> </span><span>||</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>   to_tsvector(</span><span>'</span><span>simple</span><span>'</span><span>, Director) </span><span>||</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span> </span><span>||</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>	 to_tsvector(</span><span>'</span><span>simple</span><span>'</span><span>, Genre) </span><span>||</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span> </span><span>||</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>   to_tsvector(</span><span>'</span><span>simple</span><span>'</span><span>, Origin) </span><span>||</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span> </span><span>||</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>   to_tsvector(</span><span>'</span><span>simple</span><span>'</span><span>, Casting)</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>) STORED;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>And then create the actual index:</p>
<div role="group" data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre data-theme="default" tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span data-line=""><span>CREATE</span><span> </span><span>INDEX</span><span> </span><span>idx_search</span><span> </span><span>ON</span><span> movies </span><span>USING</span><span> GIN(search);</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>You can now perform a simple test search like this:</p>
<div role="group" data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre data-theme="default" tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span data-line=""><span>SELECT</span><span> title </span><span>FROM</span><span> movies </span><span>WHERE</span><span> search @@ websearch_to_tsquery(</span><span>'</span><span>english</span><span>'</span><span>,</span><span>'</span><span>dark vader</span><span>'</span><span>);</span></span>
<span data-line=""> </span>
<span data-line=""><span>                        title</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>--------------------------------------------------</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope (aka Star Wars)</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> </span><span>Return</span><span> of the Jedi</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>(</span><span>3</span><span> </span><span>rows</span><span>)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>To see the effects of the index, you can compare the timings of the above query with and without the index. The GIN index takes it from over 200 ms to about 4 ms on my computer.</p>

<p>So far, we've seen how <code>ts_vector</code> and <code>ts_query</code> can match search queries. However, for a good search experience, it is important to show the best results first - meaning that the results need to be sorted by <em>relevancy</em>.</p>
<p>Taking it directly from the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/textsearch-controls.html#TEXTSEARCH-RANKING">docs</a>:</p>

<p>The two ranking functions mentioned are <code>ts_rank</code> and <code>ts_rank_cd</code>. The difference between them is that while they both take into account the frequency of the term, <code>ts_rank_cd</code> also takes into account the proximity of matching lexemes to each other.</p>
<p>To use them in a query, you can do something like this:</p>
<div role="group" data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre data-theme="default" tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span data-line=""><span>SELECT</span><span> title,</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>       ts_rank(search, websearch_to_tsquery(</span><span>'</span><span>english</span><span>'</span><span>, </span><span>'</span><span>dark vader</span><span>'</span><span>)) rank</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  </span><span>FROM</span><span> movies</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  </span><span>WHERE</span><span> search @@ websearch_to_tsquery(</span><span>'</span><span>english</span><span>'</span><span>,</span><span>'</span><span>dark vader</span><span>'</span><span>)</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  </span><span>ORDER BY</span><span> rank </span><span>DESC</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  </span><span>LIMIT</span><span> </span><span>10</span><span>;</span></span>
<span data-line=""> </span>
<span data-line=""><span> title                                            |    rank</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>--------------------------------------------------+------------</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> </span><span>Return</span><span> of the Jedi                               | </span><span>0</span><span>.</span><span>21563873</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith     | </span><span>0</span><span>.</span><span>12592985</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope (aka Star Wars) | </span><span>0</span><span>.</span><span>05174401</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>One thing to note about <code>ts_rank</code> is that it needs to access the <code>search</code> column for each result. This means that if the <code>WHERE</code> condition matches a lot of rows, PostgreSQL needs to visit them all in order to do the ranking, and that can be slow. To exemplify, the above query returns in 5-7 ms on my computer. If I modify the query to do search for <code>dark OR vader</code>, it returns in about 80 ms, because there are now over 1000 matching result that need ranking and sorting.</p>
<h2 id="Relevancy-tuning">Relevancy tuning</h2>
<p>While relevancy based on word frequency is a good default for the search sorting, quite often the data contains important indicators that are more relevant than simply the frequency.</p>
<p>Here are some examples for a movies dataset:</p>
<ul role="list"><li>Matches in the title should be given higher importance than matches in the description or plot.</li><li>More popular movies can be promoted based on ratings and/or the number of votes they receive.</li><li>Certain categories can be boosted more, considering user preferences. For instance, if a particular user enjoys comedies, those movies can be given a higher priority.</li><li>When ranking search results, newer titles can be considered more relevant than very old titles.</li></ul>
<p>This is why dedicated search engines typically offer ways to use different columns or fields to influence the ranking. Here are example tuning guides from <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/app-search/current/relevance-tuning-guide.html">Elastic</a>, <a href="https://typesense.org/docs/guide/ranking-and-relevance.html">Typesense</a>, and <a href="https://www.meilisearch.com/docs/learn/core_concepts/relevancy">Meilisearch</a>.</p>
<p>If you want a visual demo of the impact of relevancy tuning, here is a quick 4 minutes video about it:</p>
<div><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GfgdQs4WuXM" title="YouTube video player" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"></iframe></p></div>

<p>While Postgres doesn't have direct support for boosting based on other columns, the rank is ultimately just a sort expression, so you can add your own signals to it.</p>
<p>For example, if you want to add a boost for the number of votes, you can do something like this:</p>
<div role="group" data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre data-theme="default" tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span data-line=""><span>SELECT</span><span> title,</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  ts_rank(search, websearch_to_tsquery(</span><span>'</span><span>english</span><span>'</span><span>, </span><span>'</span><span>jedi</span><span>'</span><span>))</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    </span><span>-- numeric booster example</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>log</span><span>(NumberOfVotes)</span><span>*</span><span>0</span><span>.</span><span>01</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> </span><span>FROM</span><span> movies</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> </span><span>WHERE</span><span> search @@ websearch_to_tsquery(</span><span>'</span><span>english</span><span>'</span><span>,</span><span>'</span><span>jedi</span><span>'</span><span>)</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> </span><span>ORDER BY</span><span> rank </span><span>DESC</span><span> </span><span>LIMIT</span><span> </span><span>10</span><span>;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The logarithm is there to smoothen the impact, and the 0.01 factor brings the booster to a comparable scale with the ranking score.</p>
<p>You can also design more complex boosters, for example, boost by the rating, but only if the ranking has a certain number of votes. To do this, you can create a function like this:</p>
<div role="group" data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre data-theme="default" tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span data-line=""><span>create</span><span> </span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>numericBooster</span><span>(rating </span><span>numeric</span><span>, votes </span><span>numeric</span><span>, voteThreshold </span><span>numeric</span><span>)</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>	</span><span>returns</span><span> </span><span>numeric</span><span> </span><span>as</span><span> $$</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>		</span><span>select</span><span> </span><span>case</span><span> </span><span>when</span><span> votes </span><span>&lt;</span><span> voteThreshold </span><span>then</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span> </span><span>else</span><span> rating </span><span>end</span><span>;</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>$$ </span><span>language</span><span> </span><span>sql</span><span>;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>And use it like this:</p>
<div role="group" data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre data-theme="default" tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span data-line=""><span>SELECT</span><span> title,</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  ts_rank(search, websearch_to_tsquery(</span><span>'</span><span>english</span><span>'</span><span>, </span><span>'</span><span>jedi</span><span>'</span><span>))</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    </span><span>-- numeric booster example</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    </span><span>+</span><span> numericBooster(Rating, NumberOfVotes, </span><span>100</span><span>)</span><span>*</span><span>0</span><span>.</span><span>005</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> </span><span>FROM</span><span> movies</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> </span><span>WHERE</span><span> search @@ websearch_to_tsquery(</span><span>'</span><span>english</span><span>'</span><span>,</span><span>'</span><span>jedi</span><span>'</span><span>)</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> </span><span>ORDER BY</span><span> rank </span><span>DESC</span><span> </span><span>LIMIT</span><span> </span><span>10</span><span>;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Let's take another example. Say we want to boost the ranking of comedies. You can create a <code>valueBooster</code> function that looks like this:</p>
<div role="group" data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre data-theme="default" tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span data-line=""><span>create</span><span> </span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>valueBooster</span><span> (col </span><span>text</span><span>, val </span><span>text</span><span>, factor </span><span>integer</span><span>)</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>	</span><span>returns</span><span> </span><span>integer</span><span> </span><span>as</span><span> $$</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>		</span><span>select</span><span> </span><span>case</span><span> </span><span>when</span><span> col </span><span>=</span><span> val </span><span>then</span><span> factor </span><span>else</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span> </span><span>end</span><span>;</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>$$ </span><span>language</span><span> </span><span>sql</span><span>;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The function returns a factor if the column matches a particular value and 0 instead. Use it in a query like this:</p>
<div role="group" data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre data-theme="default" tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span data-line=""><span>SELECT</span><span> title, genre,</span></span>

<p>Remember when we talked about the <code>tsvector</code> lexemes and that they can have weights attached? Postgres supports 4 weights, named A, B, C, and D. A is the biggest weight while D is the lowest and the default. You can control the weights via the <code>setweight</code> function which you would typically call when building the <code>tsvector</code> column:</p>
<div role="group" data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre data-theme="default" tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span data-line=""><span>ALTER</span><span> </span><span>TABLE</span><span> movies </span><span>ADD</span><span> search tsvector </span><span>GENERATED</span><span> </span><span>ALWAYS</span><span> </span><span>AS</span></span>

<p>Let's see the effects of this. Without <code>setweight</code>, a search for <code>dark vader OR jedi</code> returns:</p>

<p>Note how the movie titles with “jedi” in their name have jumped to the top of the list, and their rank has increased.</p>
<p>It's worth pointing out that having only four weight “classes” is somewhat limiting, and that they need to be applied when computing the <code>tsvector</code>.</p>

<p>PostgreSQL doesn't support fuzzy search or typo-tolerance directly, when using <code>tsvector</code> and <code>tsquery</code>. However, working on the assumptions that the typo is in the query part, we can implement the following idea:</p>
<ul role="list"><li>index all <em>lexemes</em> from the content in a separate table</li><li>for each word in the query, use similarity or Levenshtein distance to search in this table</li><li>modify the query to include any words that are found</li><li>perform the search</li></ul>
<p>Here is how it works. First, use <code>ts_stats</code> to get all words in a materialized view:</p>
<div role="group" data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre data-theme="default" tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span data-line=""><span>CREATE</span><span> MATERLIAZED VIEW unique_lexeme </span><span>AS</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>   </span><span>SELECT</span><span> word </span><span>FROM</span><span> ts_stat(</span><span>'</span><span>SELECT search FROM movies</span><span>'</span><span>);</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now, for each word in the query, check if it is in the <code>unique_lexeme</code> view. If it's not, do a fuzzy-search in that view to find possible misspellings of it:</p>
<div role="group" data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre data-theme="default" tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span data-line=""><span>SELECT</span><span> </span><span>*</span><span> </span><span>FROM</span><span> unique_lexeme</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>   </span><span>WHERE</span><span> levenshtein_less_equal(word, </span><span>'</span><span>pregant</span><span>'</span><span>, </span><span>2</span><span>) </span><span>&lt;</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>;</span></span>
<span data-line=""> </span>
<span data-line=""><span>   word</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>----------</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> premant</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> pregrant</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> pregnant</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> paegant</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>In the above we use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance">Levenshtein distance</a> because that's what search engines like Elasticsearch use for fuzzy search.</p>
<p>Once you have the candidate list of words, you need to adjust the query include them all.</p>

<p>Faceted search is popular especially on e-commerce sites because it helps customers to iteratively narrow their search. Here is an example from amazon.com:</p>
<div><p><a href="https://xata.io/mdx/blog/amazon_faceted_search.png"><img alt="Faceted search on Amazon" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://xata.io/_next/image?url=%2Fmdx%2Fblog%2Famazon_faceted_search.png&amp;w=640&amp;q=75 640w, https://xata.io/_next/image?url=%2Fmdx%2Fblog%2Famazon_faceted_search.png&amp;w=750&amp;q=75 750w, https://xata.io/_next/image?url=%2Fmdx%2Fblog%2Famazon_faceted_search.png&amp;w=828&amp;q=75 828w, https://xata.io/_next/image?url=%2Fmdx%2Fblog%2Famazon_faceted_search.png&amp;w=1080&amp;q=75 1080w, https://xata.io/_next/image?url=%2Fmdx%2Fblog%2Famazon_faceted_search.png&amp;w=1200&amp;q=75 1200w, https://xata.io/_next/image?url=%2Fmdx%2Fblog%2Famazon_faceted_search.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1920w, https://xata.io/_next/image?url=%2Fmdx%2Fblog%2Famazon_faceted_search.png&amp;w=2048&amp;q=75 2048w, https://xata.io/_next/image?url=%2Fmdx%2Fblog%2Famazon_faceted_search.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 3840w" src="https://xata.io/_next/image?url=%2Fmdx%2Fblog%2Famazon_faceted_search.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></a></p><p><figcaption>Faceted search on Amazon</figcaption></p></div>
<p>The above can implemented by manually defining categories and then adding them as <code>WHERE</code> conditions to the search. Another approach is to create the categories algorithmically based on the existing data. For example, you can use the following to create a “Decade” facet:</p>
<div role="group" data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre data-theme="default" tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span data-line=""><span>SELECT</span><span> ReleaseYear</span><span>/</span><span>10</span><span>*</span><span>10</span><span> decade, </span><span>count</span><span>(Title) cnt </span><span>FROM</span><span> movies</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  </span><span>WHERE</span><span> search @@ websearch_to_tsquery(</span><span>'</span><span>english</span><span>'</span><span>,</span><span>'</span><span>star wars</span><span>'</span><span>)</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  </span><span>GROUP BY</span><span> decade </span><span>ORDER BY</span><span> cnt </span><span>DESC</span><span>;</span></span>
<span data-line=""> </span>
<span data-line=""><span>decade | cnt</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>--------+-----</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>   </span><span>2000</span><span> |  </span><span>39</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>   </span><span>2010</span><span> |  </span><span>31</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>   </span><span>1990</span><span> |  </span><span>29</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>   </span><span>1950</span><span> |  </span><span>28</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>   </span><span>1940</span><span> |  </span><span>26</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>   </span><span>1980</span><span> |  </span><span>22</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>   </span><span>1930</span><span> |  </span><span>13</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>   </span><span>1960</span><span> |  </span><span>11</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>   </span><span>1970</span><span> |   </span><span>7</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>   </span><span>1910</span><span> |   </span><span>3</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>   </span><span>1920</span><span> |   </span><span>3</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>(</span><span>11</span><span> </span><span>rows</span><span>)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This also provides counts of matches for each decade, which you can display in brackets.</p>
<p>If you want to get multiple facets in a single query, you can combine them, for example, by using CTEs:</p>
<div role="group" data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre data-theme="default" tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span data-line=""><span>WITH</span><span> releaseYearFacets </span><span>AS</span><span> (</span></span>

<span data-line=""><span>  </span><span>FROM</span><span> movies</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  </span><span>WHERE</span><span> search @@ websearch_to_tsquery(</span><span>'</span><span>english</span><span>'</span><span>,</span><span>'</span><span>star wars</span><span>'</span><span>)</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  </span><span>GROUP BY</span><span> val </span><span>ORDER BY</span><span> cnt </span><span>DESC</span><span>),</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>genreFacets </span><span>AS</span><span> (</span></span>

<p>The above should work quite well on small to medium data sets, however it can become slow on very large data sets.</p>

<p>We've seen the PostgreSQL full-text search primitives, and how we can combine them to create a pretty advanced full-text search engine, which also happens to support things like joins and ACID transactions. In other words, it has functionality that the other search engines typically don't have.</p>
<p>There are more advanced search topics that would be worth covering in detail:</p>
<ul role="list"><li>suggesters / auto-complete</li><li>exact phrase matching</li><li>hybrid search (semantic + keyword) by combining with pg-vector</li></ul>
<p>Each of these would be worth their own blog post (coming!), but by now you should have an intuitive feeling about them: they are quite possible using PostgreSQL, but they require you to do the work of combining the primitives and in some cases the performance might suffer on very large datasets.</p>
<p>In part 2, we'll make a detailed comparison with Elasticsearch, looking to answer the question on when is it worth it to implement search into PostgreSQL versus adding Elasticsearch to your infrastructure and syncing the data.

They’re for people who want to manage. This creates weird incentives for builders to become managers, even when they don’t want to.</p><p>We want to make Shopify a crafter’s paradise. Our goal is to clear the obstacles for crafters to do their best work and be rewarded for it.</p><p><strong>I’ve worked at many companies where the career ladders always seem to require product managers to become people managers. It’s always like, “If you want to be a director, you need to manage X+ people.” What are your thoughts on this?</strong></p><p>I think traditional career ladders are broken - they just don’t work.</p><p>At Shopify, we have a management track and a crafter track. What this means is you don’t need to manage more people to get promoted and make more money.</p><p>I think this dual track approach is incredibly empowering for crafters. Is managing more people a hard job? Sure. But so is being an individual contributor (IC) leading an open-source project that impacts our entire code base. It’s just a different kind of complexity.</p><p><strong>It’s a copout the complexity is only associated with managing more people.</strong></p><p>I was talking to a Chief Product Officer who decided to return to a being an individual contributor. He told me that what he really loved is just working with engineers and customers. It’s ok to admit this to yourself.</p><p><strong>As companies scale, optics start playing a larger role. People start spending more time on internal docs than actually talking to customers. How do you prevent this from happening at Shopify?</strong></p><p>At Shopify, we rage against becoming a big bureaucratic company.</p><p>In most product reviews, product managers spend way too much time preparing the perfect presentation for execs. </p><p>At Shopify, our approach to product reviews is different. We want to see how the product actually works by playing with the demo or diving into the code. </p><p><strong>No one ever asks in as Shopify product review: “What’s the strategy of this?” Strategy is the least meaningful aspect of whether a product is great or not.</strong></p><p>We want our PMs to be extremely user-focused, to take full ownership over problems, and to have a high tolerance for risk.</p><p>If these attributes aren't present, product managers tend to become "keepers of strategy.” You end up with smart, highly credentialed individuals spending all their time writing strategy memos to increase their team size so that they can write even more strategy memos.</p><p>At Shopify, our primary job is to build products, not career ladders. Therefore, we focus on the actual product that’s shipping during reviews, not the strategy behind it.</p><p><strong>I love that. Many PMs have this grand vision and strategy but end up just shipping the MVP and moving onto something else.</strong></p><p>Yes, many people misunderstand how great products are built.</p><p>They think that a great product comes from a strategy document, but that’s not true. </p><p><strong>Great products are built through continuous tinkering and adjustments. Every product that we love has been built this way.</strong></p><p>At Shopify, staying in touch with the customer is a crucial aspect of the PM role. We do this in a few ways:</p><ol><li><p><strong>We remove internal hoops to talk to customers.</strong><span> Anyone can do it. In fact, it's part of the job. I talk to customers everyday.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>We become the customer. </strong><span>Many Shopify PMs (including myself and Tobi) have stores. This lets us experience the customer’s pain and struggles directly.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>We encourage everyone to be a customer service representative. </strong><span>Getting this experience, even for just a few days, gives people much more insight into customer needs.</span></p></li></ol><p>Our customers are independent business owners. In many ways, they’re similar to us. They’re builders who want to focus on craftsmanship.</p><p>That’s why we love hiring former founders as employees. Even those at Shopify who aren't founders have a founder mentality.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2044d421-e44a-4e77-9012-1854370249cc_1016x579.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2044d421-e44a-4e77-9012-1854370249cc_1016x579.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2044d421-e44a-4e77-9012-1854370249cc_1016x579.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2044d421-e44a-4e77-9012-1854370249cc_1016x579.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2044d421-e44a-4e77-9012-1854370249cc_1016x579.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2044d421-e44a-4e77-9012-1854370249cc_1016x579.png" width="1016" height="579" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2044d421-e44a-4e77-9012-1854370249cc_1016x579.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:579,&quot;width&quot;:1016,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:312323,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2044d421-e44a-4e77-9012-1854370249cc_1016x579.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2044d421-e44a-4e77-9012-1854370249cc_1016x579.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2044d421-e44a-4e77-9012-1854370249cc_1016x579.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2044d421-e44a-4e77-9012-1854370249cc_1016x579.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Tobi (Shopify CEO) co-founded Shopify after getting frustrated by how difficult it was to set up his online snowboarding store</figcaption></figure></div><p><strong>I also enjoy working with founders vs. corporate types. I think founders just have a deep urgency to bring value to the customer and to the business.</strong></p><p>Yes, it’s hard to imagine what Shopify would look like if it were run by corporate types. It probably won’t exist to be honest.</p><p><strong>What are your thoughts on measuring progress using metrics and OKRs?</strong></p><p>We don’t over-index on OKRs. Many important things can’t be measured and not everything that can be measured is important.</p><p>If you focus too much on turning 1 into 1.1, you risk neglecting things that actually matter. Instead, we’re a company of crafters who focus on tinkering and continuous feedback loops. </p><p><strong>Many companies spend a lot of time deciding if they're measuring the right thing. We prefer to focus on building the right thing.</strong></p><p>That's not to say there isn't a role for measurement. Measurement is crucial for making sure that you're doing the right thing. However, building products isn’t the same as being a stock broker. They’re different jobs. </p><p>Bottom line:</p><p><strong>Building great products is a matter of having taste and knowing when your product will resonate with customers.</strong></p><p>Unfortunately, this is why there are so few good product managers. I can't teach taste or the kind of extreme ownership over problems that we require, nor can I teach customer empathy. I can help fine-tune these skills, but my job is to select people who already possess these qualities.</p><p>If you’re enjoying this post, please fill out this 1-minute survey about the newsletter:</p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://forms.gle/46v611Xcu5qtC5xr8&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Fill out a 1-min reader survey&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:&quot;button-wrapper&quot;}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://forms.gle/46v611Xcu5qtC5xr8" rel=""><span>Fill out a 1-min reader survey</span></a></p><p><strong>In early 2023, Shopify initiated operation “Chaos Monkey” to:</strong></p><ol><li><p><strong>Cancel all meetings with 3+ people&nbsp;</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Reinstate “no meeting Wednesdays”</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Remove needless Slack channels</strong></p></li></ol><p><strong>Can you share why the exec team decided to do this?</strong></p><p>It started during Christmas break 2022 when Tobi and I had a conversation.</p><p>The fact is, nobody joined Shopify to spend all day sitting in meetings.

The average time people spent in meetings went down by a third.</p><p>Going back to our previous conversation, there was no 5-year strategy doc behind this change.

I think this is a sign that there’s something wrong with the underlying structure.</p><p><strong>Does Shopify have a strong writing culture to help people communicate without meetings?</strong></p><p>Yes, we try to make async decisions as much as we can. We do this in a few ways:</p><ol><li><p><strong>One of our mantras is “Do things, tell people.” </strong><span>You’ll see this plastered on our walls if you come to Shopify’s office.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>We built an operating system called GSD (get shit done). </strong><span>This internal tool emphasizes frequent written updates, which are much easier to digest than constant meetings.</span></p></li></ol><p>If there’s a need to go back and forth on an issue, then a meeting may be called. But that’s the thing:</p><p><strong>A meeting is a bug that some other process didn’t work out.</strong></p><p>When an ad hoc meeting happens, we try to understand why written exchanges didn't work to make improvements.</p><p><strong>How can folks reading this protect their time to focus on their craft? Can they just say no to meetings?</strong></p><p>I think it’s hard because most companies are structured to serve managers. </p><p>Even the physical office reflects this. The top floors are often reserved for managers. At Shopify, we follow an inverted organizational chart where the lowest level is the CEO, reflecting our commitment to servant leadership. </p><p><span>For those who want to focus on their craft, my advice is to just </span><a href="https://www.shopify.com/careers" rel="">apply to Shopify.</a></p><p><strong>I find that a company’s culture frequently starts to erode as the company gets larger. </strong></p><p>You have to fight everyday to keep the culture alive. At Shopify, we focus on 3 areas:</p><ol><li><p><strong>We frequently ask “Why?” </strong><span>We question every process to understand if it still needs to exist. Often, companies adopt best practices like OKRs without second thought. We don’t like doing something blinding just because it’s the status quo.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>We hire people who like risk. </strong><span>Like I said before, we like hiring founders as employees. We try to avoid hiring people who want to minimize risk by adopting industry best practices blindly. </span></p></li><li><p><strong>We focus on the mission. </strong><span>We want to be the all-in-one commerce platform for people to start and grow businesses. We try to avoid getting distracted by other side quests. </span></p></li></ol><p><strong>I think the last point is particularly important. Many companies claim to be mission focused but always get distracted by the latest trend.</strong></p><p>Yes. There’s this great quote from Stephen Covey that rings true:</p><p><strong>The main thing is to keep the main thing the main thing.</strong></p><p><strong><span>Thank Kaz!

         }"><p data-block-key="wrbmq">NotebookLM is an experimental product designed to use the power and promise of language models paired with your existing content to gain critical insights, faster. Think of it as a virtual research assistant that can summarize facts, explain complex ideas, and brainstorm new connections — all based on the sources you select.</p><p data-block-key="8he48">A key difference between NotebookLM and traditional AI chatbots is that NotebookLM lets you “ground” the language model in your notes and sources. Source-grounding effectively creates a personalized AI that’s versed in the information relevant to you. Starting today, you can ground NotebookLM in specific Google Docs that you choose, and we’ll be adding additional formats soon.</p><p data-block-key="7c9e9">Once you’ve selected your Google Docs, you can do three things:</p><ul><li data-block-key="58a93"><b>Get a summary:</b> When you first add a Google Doc into NotebookLM, it will automatically generate a summary, along with key topics and questions to ask so you get a better understanding of the material.</li><li data-block-key="6mhmm"><b>Ask questions:</b> When you’re ready for a deeper dive, you can ask questions about the documents you’ve uploaded. For example:<ul><li data-block-key="5mniq">A medical student could upload a scientific article about neuroscience and tell NotebookLM to “create a glossary of key terms related to dopamine”</li><li data-block-key="3a9ai">An author working on a biography could upload research notes and ask a question like: “Summarize all the times Houdini and Conan Doyle interacted.”</li></ul></li><li data-block-key="9k9mv"><b>Generate ideas:</b> NotebookLM isn’t just for Q&amp;A. We’ve found some of its more delightful and useful capabilities are when it’s able to help people come up with creative new ideas. For example:<ul><li data-block-key="d158b">A content creator could upload their ideas for new videos and ask: “Generate a script for a short video on this topic.”</li><li data-block-key="be0fh">Or an entrepreneur raising money could upload their pitch and ask: “What questions would potential investors ask?”</li></ul></li></ul><p data-block-key="4t4o4">While NotebookLM’s source-grounding does seem to reduce the risk of model “hallucinations,” it’s always important to fact-check the AI’s responses against your original source material. When you're drawing on multiple sources, we make that fact-checking easy by accompanying each response with citations, showing you the most relevant original quotes from your sources.</p></div>

We will also use a strict set of safety criteria in alignment with our <a href="https://ai.google/responsibility/principles/">AI Principles</a> and implement appropriate safeguards before expanding to more users and launching new functionality.</li></ul><p data-block-key="4ajn0">We’ve built NotebookLM such that the model only has access to the source material that you’ve chosen to upload, and your files and dialogue with the AI are not visible to other users. We do not use any of the data collected to train new AI models.</p><p data-block-key="d6vmp">We hope that in these early days you give NotebookLM a shot.

It's in their interest to buy the tickets off people and then resell them themselves, since they will get two cuts in that case. Couple that with the fact that they're in a unique position to measure demand and model future pricing, they can effectively double dip with little risk.<p>Further, the shell companies could be something Stubhub is doing to derisk the arbitrage portion of the transaction to isolate losses associated with inability to sell the tickets for a profit to the shell company rather than to Stubhub.

That's $2 total.</p><p>If I sell a ticket to someone else on Stubhub for $50 then they also get $1 from me and $1 from the seller. The "double dipping" doesnt work out even before you factor in the overhead.</p><p>This is not to say they aren't manipulating market. Maybe they think they can make more money because humans are risk adverse and sell tickets for less than they should to optimize EV, or somethikng.

</figure><p>The first genome-wide hunt to find genetic risk factors for long COVID has yielded a hit: a DNA sequence near a gene called <i>FOXP4</i>, which is active in the lungs and in some immune cells.</p><p>The study, which was released as a preprint on 1 July<sup><a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">1</a></sup>, used data collected from 6,450 people with long COVID across 16 countries. Researchers hope that this analysis will be just the beginning: a vast amount of data are required to unpick a disorder as complex as long COVID, which has been associated with more than 200 symptoms, including severe fatigue, nerve pain and difficulties with concentration and memory.</p><article data-label="Related">

 </article><p>“It’s very important that this type of study is being done,” says Chris Ponting, who studies medical bioinformatics at the University of Edinburgh, UK. “It will gain momentum and greater power as the case number increases.”</p><p>Such studies are early steps towards learning more about the causes of long COVID, says Stéphanie Longet, an immunologist at Jean Monnet University in Saint-Étienne, France, who has long COVID. “There are several key topics which are essential for patients, including treatments and prevention,” she says. “When causes, maybe multifactorial, [are] clearly understood, it will help to treat patients who will be more susceptible to develop long COVID and potentially prevent long COVID.”</p><h2>Susceptibility genes</h2><p>For more than three years, the global COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative has been searching for DNA sequences that are associated with a risk of developing severe COVID-19. That hunt, which is ongoing, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01655-0" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01655-0" data-track-category="body text link">has implicated genes involved in the immune system</a> and in allowing the SARS-CoV-2 virus to enter cells<sup><a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">2</a></sup>.</p><p>The long-COVID study is a spin-off from that effort, says Hugo Zeberg, a geneticist at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm and a lead author on the preprint. To study the condition, the team compiled data from 24 studies involving a total of nearly 6,500 people diagnosed with long COVID, as well as more than a million other participants who served as controls.</p><article data-label="Related">
  <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-01702-2" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"><img alt="" src="https://media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-023-02269-2/d41586-023-02269-2_23195404.jpg"><p>How common is long COVID? Why studies give different answers</p></a>
 </article><p>In one analysis that combined data from 11 of those studies, researchers found a particular region of the genome that was associated with about 1.6-fold higher odds of developing long COVID. That segment of DNA is near a gene called <i>FOXP4</i>, which is active in the lungs and other organs. The variant linked to long COVID is also associated with higher expression of <i>FOXP4</i> in lung cells.</p><p>Previous research has linked the same gene to an increased risk of severe COVID-19, and Zeberg and his colleagues found that it is also associated with lung cancer. Although having severe COVID-19 increases the risk of developing long COVID, the team found that the contribution of the DNA variant to long-COVID risk was too large to be explained by its link to severe COVID-19 alone. “This variant has a much stronger impact on long COVID than its impact on severity,” says Zeberg.</p><p>Replicating that finding in other data sets would help to strengthen the study’s conclusions, says Zhongshan Cheng, a bioinformatician at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee. Much of the data used in the long-COVID analysis was also used in the analysis that found a link between <i>FOX4P</i> and severe COVID-19, he notes. Fresh data would help to rule out the possibility that other factors, such as lung cancer, could have influenced the apparent association with <i>FOX4P</i>.</p><h2>More to come</h2><p>Even so, the study is a breakthrough, Cheng says, and future studies will probably add to the list of genetic risk factors for long COVID.</p><p>“It won’t just be a single answer, there will be a whole variety of people’s vulnerabilities contributing to why they haven’t recovered from COVID,” says Ponting. He and his colleagues proposed a study that would have included DNA from 15,000 people with long COVID. But grant reviewers rejected the proposal, he says, because they thought the condition too complex to be dissected in the way Ponting's team suggested.</p><p>“I disagree,” he says. “It is very complicated, but also very important to pick apart. The health and socio-economic costs of long COVID are enormous.”</p>

Something seems broken. You’re frustrated — and you have no idea how to fix it. </p><p> In times like these, I like to step back and ask a question: </p><p><b>“What problem do I actually have?”</b></p><p> Because here’s the thing: When we can’t find a solution, it’s often because we’re trying to solve the wrong problem. </p><p> In this newsletter, I’ll help you find the problem you <span><i>actually</i></span> have — by distilling it down to one simple word. Then we can find a solution that <span>actually</span> works. </p><p><h2><span><b>Let’s start with an example.</b></span></h2></p><p> A young professional recently came to me with a problem. He works at an advertising agency, and his ideas are always getting shot down. He’s frustrated, demoralized, and can’t figure out what’s wrong. </p><p> “Should I just start executing my ideas without asking permission?” he asked me. </p><p> This would be an act of desperation, but he sees no other choice. He believes in his ideas. Nobody’s giving him a chance. So maybe he just… spends some time and money, and proves himself that way? </p><p> To which I said: <span><i>Hold up there.</i></span></p><p> The problem is, he doesn’t actually know what problem he has. Which means he can’t find the right solution. </p><p> And that’s the most common problem of all. </p><p><h2><span><b>We can find your problem.</b></span></h2></p><p> Have you ever gone to a physical therapist? It’s a fascinating experience. </p><p> You go in complaining about your shoulder, and after a little while, the PT says: “Oh, the problem is actually your lower back, which is forcing you to stand this way, and then you’re compensating with your neck, which is being felt in your shoulder.” </p><p> Fix the lower back, and your shoulder pain goes away. Or something like that — I’m not a physical therapist! (Also, <a href="https://flight.beehiiv.net/v2/clicks/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.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.yedoKneSQBFy1PjJDJ1KYZuGSApb5CAkTCe3c3lhY9U" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">lol this</a>.) </p><p> The point is, our work and life problems function similarly. </p><p> Problems feel big and abstract, and they radiate outward. We spend a lot of time trying to solve for the <span><i>symptom</i></span> of the problem, rather than locating the actual problem itself. </p><p> So, how can we actually find the source? </p><p><h2><span><b>You need a “one-word problem.”</b></span></h2></p><p> Consider this: What if your problem is actually very small? </p><p> That’s not to say it’s simple or unimportant. It’s just to say, it’s specific. The problem is <span><i>this thing</i></span>, not <span><i>everything</i></span>. </p><p> And how do we find that? By focusing. Your goal is to distill your problem down to a simple, single word — so small it can fit inside a Mad Libs-style sentence like this: </p><p><span><b>“I don’t have a ______ problem. I actually have a ______ problem.”</b></span></p><p> And how do you do <i><span>that</span></i>? </p><p> Let’s go back to the young man at the advertising agency. </p><p> Nobody accepts his ideas — so right now, we might say he has an “acceptance problem.” That’s a big, abstract problem that’s hard to solve. </p><p> But also, he’s never tested whether that’s his <span><i>actual</i></span> problem. </p><p> So, it’s time for: </p><p><b>Step #1: Create some hypotheses.</b>&nbsp; </p><p> Break out all the potential problems you’re facing — write down any realistic, untested possible version of your problem. For example, I presented the advertising guy with a few. </p><p> What if, instead of having an acceptance problem, he really has a… </p><div><ul><li><p><span><b>Ideas problem: </b></span>He thinks his ideas are good, but they are bad. </p></li><li><p><span><b>Seniority problem: </b></span>His team doesn’t value junior people’s ideas. </p></li><li><p><span><b>Vibe problem: </b></span>He’s part of a team that doesn’t value his type of ideas. </p></li><li><p><span><b>Communication problem: </b></span>His ideas are good, but he’s bad at communicating them. </p></li><li><p><span><b>Collaboration problem: </b></span>He’s going it alone, while his colleagues collaborate to get more buy-in from the team. </p></li></ul></div><p> So, there are six possible problems. Write them all down, I said. </p><p><b>Step #2: Experiment!</b>&nbsp; </p><p> Run tests to see which problem you actually have. Because each one-word problem comes with its own solution. </p><p> Some are easy to test. For example, with the ad guy: The seniority problem is easily testable. He can think back — are other junior members of the team being rejected, or are their ideas getting through? </p><p> But many will require effort. The communication problem is a big one. Maybe his ideas are great but also complicated — so when he describes them in meetings, nobody understands him. What can he do instead? Make sketches? Quick mock-ups? He should test this out. </p><p> Perhaps this sounds exhausting. But it should sound liberating. Because before, this advertising guy only saw the symptom of a problem and had one high-risk solution in mind — and that was to spend time and money executing ideas without permission, and probably pissing off his boss. </p><p> But now he has a <i><span>lot</span></i> of potential solutions. And one day, he can finally fill out the Mad Libs: </p><p><span><b>“I don’t have an </b></span><span><span><b>acceptance</b></span></span><span><b> problem. I actually have a </b></span><span><span><b>communication</b></span></span><span><b> problem.”</b></span></p><p> Along the way, of course, he (and you!) should also ask others for input. He could approach his boss and say: “Hey, I’m having trouble getting my ideas through, and I came up with a couple of potential solutions. What do you think about these?” That’ll start a helpful conversation. </p><p><h2><span><b>Now, apply this thinking everywhere.</b></span></h2></p><div><p><img alt="" src="https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/36d64f59-f89e-4a76-8e45-ec079a4c34f8/DALL_E_2023-07-08_08.36.01_-_one-line_drawing_of_person_looking_down_at_a_giant_tumbleweed2.png"></p><p><small><p>Made with DALL-E 2</p></small></p></div><p> Are you in a struggling relationship? Step back and ask: “Do I have a relationship problem, or a…” </p><p> Now what is it? Communication problem? Lifestyle problem? Jealousy problem? Something else? Maybe there’s something specific to solve for, without having to blow up the entire relationship. </p><p> Are you unhappy at work? Step back and ask: “Do I have a job problem, or a…” </p><p> Now what is it? Manager problem? Responsibilities problem? And so on. </p><p> I remember once interviewing Jason Robins, the founder of DraftKings, about an existential problem his company faced: Multiple states were threatening to change their gambling laws, which would have put DraftKings out of business. </p><p> This seemed like an existential problem. But how do you solve for that!? So he stepped back and basically asked: <span><i>What problem do I actually have?</i></span></p><p> “It's really no different than figuring out how to build a product that people want,” <a href="https://flight.beehiiv.net/v2/clicks/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5lbnRyZXByZW5ldXIuY29tL2dyb3dpbmctYS1idXNpbmVzcy9ob3ctZHJhZnRraW5ncy1zdXJ2aXZlZC1hbmQtbWFkZS1kYWlseS1mYW50YXN5LXNwb3J0cy1sZWdhbC8zMDAxMjg_dXRtX3NvdXJjZT1qYXNvbmZlaWZlci5iZWVoaWl2LmNvbSZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPXJlZmVycmFsJnV0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1ob3ctdG8tc29sdmUteW91ci1iaWctcHJvYmxlbXMtYnktc29sdmluZy15b3VyLXJlYWwtcHJvYmxlbSIsInBvc3RfaWQiOiIwNWI1ZjRhNC02NzQwLTQyZmUtOTk4MC02Nzg2YzcyMzczOWUiLCJwdWJsaWNhdGlvbl9pZCI6IjQwY2ZjOTgzLWE5OWYtNGNlNy05YzUzLTExNTg5NjRmZGU5ZSIsInZpc2l0X3Rva2VuIjoiMmZmZWM0MTAtYzVmNS00YjExLWEwMGEtNzBlMDc3MmFhZmQzIiwiaWF0IjoxNjg5MTc3NjA1LjkzMSwiaXNzIjoib3JjaGlkIn0.0MPlbB6TwKlGvG7cobgQG5jXvJkRa965pIkBYMM9SPQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">he told me</a>. “It was: <span><i>This is the problem we've got to solve</i></span>. And all of a sudden, you know what you’re doing.” </p><p> In DraftKing’s case, Robins realized he had a <i>relationships problem</i>. DraftKings had no relationships with lawmakers, which meant no open dialog or opportunity to create common ground. So they invested in lobbyists, started meeting with local officials, and ultimately helped craft laws that made lawmakers happy but kept DraftKings in business. </p><p> Your problems are real. They are hard. They drain your time and energy. But they are not everything, and they are not everywhere. They are contained. Identifiable. Solvable. </p><p> But you will not get there until you can name them. Until you know what you’re dealing with.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A group of Democratic senators is <a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24782736/2023.07.11_Letter_to_IRS__TIGTA__FTC__DOJ_on_tax_prep_pixel_data_sharing.pdf">urging federal law enforcement officials</a> to investigate and prosecute some of the most popular online tax filing companies for allegedly sharing millions of taxpayers’ financial data with Meta and Google.&nbsp;</p><p>On Tuesday, Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), and others asked the Justice Department, Federal Trade Commission, Treasury Department, and the IRS to investigate whether TaxSlayer, H&amp;R Block, and TaxAct violated taxpayer privacy laws by sharing sensitive user information with the two tech firms.</p><p>Senators also released <a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Attacks%20on%20Tax%20Privacy_Final.pdf">their own report</a> Wednesday detailing the accusations, first raised <a href="https://themarkup.org/pixel-hunt/2022/11/22/tax-filing-websites-have-been-sending-users-financial-information-to-facebook">by <em>The Markup </em>last November</a>. The report alleges that for years, tax preparation companies infused their products with Meta and Google tracking pixels that revealed identifying information — like a user’s full name, address, and date of birth. The senators also suggest that some of the information provided, like the forms a user accessed, could be used to show “whether taxpayers were eligible for certain deductions or exemptions.”&nbsp;</p><p>The senators claim that the companies did not receive user consent to share this information, which could violate laws banning tax preparers from sharing tax return information with third parties, especially since much of this data could be used for advertising purposes.&nbsp;</p><p>“The findings of this report reveal a shocking breach of taxpayer privacy by tax prep companies and by Big Tech firms that appeared to violate taxpayers’ rights and may have violated taxpayer privacy law,” the senators said in their Tuesday letter.&nbsp;</p><p>TaxSlayer, H&amp;R Block, and TaxAct all confirmed that they shared “extensive taxpayer data” through Meta’s pixel in the senators’ report. After <em>The Markup </em>published its November findings, each of the companies said they had “removed or disabled” it from their websites. &nbsp; </p></div></div>]]></description>

  <p>Written by <a href="https://klangmag.co/lifers-dayjobbers-and-the-independently-wealthy-a-letter-to-a-former-student/www.maxalper.xyz">Max Alper</a></p><hr><p><em>Last year, a private student of mine had gotten in touch with me via email at around 3 AM. I had known this student for years prior, as they were in one of the earliest college courses I ever taught when they were an undergraduate at CUNY. This student, now in their mid-twenties, had witnessed much of my growth as an educator, from a nervous graduate student lecturing a room of indifferent college students to Professor Shitlord Emeritus of the Internet. <br></em></p><p><em>I often take the feedback of students like these incredibly close to heart. I thrive on constructive criticism, and these students have seen the changes I’ve made to my lessons and teaching style based on their words and feedback over the years. So when I saw this person shoot me a DM at 3 AM the previous night, I was a bit concerned. No good DMs get sent at 3 AM, nothing good happens at 3 AM.<br></em></p><p><em>The student, who we will call Billy, starts off with the first sentence: “Hey Max, depression really sucks.” We’re getting right to it off the bat. </em></p><p><em>Billy tells me how much they’ve been struggling during the past few years, even before COVID, burning themselves out trying to make a living as a working musician in Brooklyn. It’s hard for anybody anywhere in the states to pay rent off their art. I can only imagine what it’s like to grow up an aspiring artist all the while watching your hometown turn into the hip stomping ground for wealthy transplants from the Midwest and other parts of the East Coast. If anyone should have a shot in the various New York music scenes first and foremost, it should be local kids like Billy. <br></em></p><p><em>So it breaks my heart when Billy tells me he feels like a failure in his own city. And because of the toll this has taken on his mental health, Billy says he’s giving up on music altogether and applying to trade school. I responded with a few thoughts for Billy, some of which I’ve expanded upon below, that I’d like to share with you all.</em></p><hr><p>Dear Billy,<br></p><p>This breaks my heart on a few levels. For one thing, I’ve known you since you were a college student in my American Music History class getting your BA in Music. I thought I had done a decent enough job exposing the bullshit of the music industry to younger artists such as yourself, but one can only keep it <em>so real</em> in a college classroom without getting fired for telling their students that the game rigged.</p><p>What I wish I could have told you then is that every industry is saturated with nepotism and corruption, and oftentimes the arts are where these toxic qualities of the market get put on full display. We <em>do not</em> live in a meritocracy, hard work doesn’t automatically equal success when we are competing against those who have paid their way to the front of the line. But not to worry Billy, you have time to make your mark in your beautiful hometown of New York, let me tell you why.</p><p>Look at your favorite artists, alive or dead, the ones who you have always aspired to be as a professional. Chances are they have had one of three types of musical careers. Every professional musician I’ve met has fallen into one of these macro categories. I know it seems like an overgeneralization, but it continues to prove itself to be tried and true in my experience, so just hear me out. <br></p><p>The first of these three types of professional artists is the independently wealthy artist. I’m not saying look to the ones who flaunt it, you need to look for the ones with<em> time</em>. Often the most noticeable sign of merit on the surface level of a musician is their virtuosity behind their instrument. To shred is to impress, right? Yes, even I can admit that some good old-fashioned practice on a traditional instrument can indeed improve one's musical abilities tenfold. But this type of practice takes time, lots of time. <br></p><p>Who paid for all this time? How does someone outside of a conservatory program have the time to compose, record, and perform new original material every month, let alone to even practice their instrument an hour a day? The answer almost always comes down to the ability to not have to worry about paid work while pursuing your craft. As in, most likely, someone in your family pays your rent.</p><p>I’m not saying wealthy people can’t make incredible artists. Without Marcel Duchamp’s monthly allowance from his father throughout his adult life, we would never have Dada. Giacinto Scelsi was literally the heir and Duke of La Spezia castle estate. Something more contemporary? Grimes’ mother was a Crown Prosecutor, the Canadian equivalent of a District Attorney, in Vancouver. Frankie Cosmos’ dad is the guy from Wild Wild West, no, not Will Smith, the other guy. Julian Casablancas’ father ran New York’s top super modeling agency while young Julian hung out at the kid’s table with Ivanka Trump at Christmas time. The list goes on. <br></p><p>As talented and influential as these folks may be, it’s impossible not to link their artistic careers to the affluent lifestyles that supported them since birth. We can love their work while acknowledging that their upbringing most certainly is not the norm, nor is it something that your average aspiring artist can emulate in their practices. It’s like sprinting a hundred-meter dash while expecting to have the same shot of winning as the runner who is given a ninety-meter handicap. Time is money, and there will always be people out there who have more time than you to pursue their passions. So, fuck ‘em dude, you work with the time you have, it’s not a race.<br></p><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/5uEXY88I2QRSyIsBLNLih1oEIMj7Jucr024ENhVUMqrONq662OzO2B7Ame4iw3zvw_UNLav13XSYH_cuKRfSIlVBMtJjyM83BA9RKlrqoZrSu3cnuhTb8v16C4cXFcyDop3UBeSI2QcMQtcRxmjKdg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="583" height="329"></figure><p>The second general category of musical career is that of the lifer, or one who has dedicated their life to the struggle of making a living solely as an independent working musician, for better or worse. There’s never a better time to be about that life than when you’re young. You’ll never know it ain’t for you unless you try, and you got the energy for it in your early twenties. Being about that life includes, but is not limited to, tour nomadism, working seven days a week across multiple musical projects that both gig and record, and relying solely on the income generated from said touring and bands. This <em>usually</em> means not making much money, especially in the COVID and post-COVID world. Not to say you can’t make decent money off Bandcamp sales when you have the right amount of presence on the internet, but the effect of the pandemic has without a doubt been crippling to working musicians. As smaller venues closed across the country, private equity moved in. <br></p><p>In our contemporary hellscape that is the recording industry, gigs and direct in-person sales of merchandise are essential. For all the good that the monthly Bandcamp Friday series has done both during and after the pandemic, which included waiving all sales fees for artists to yield 100% revenue on the first Friday of every month, mass adoption of streaming platforms as the main means of record distribution has all but cemented the death of recorded music on its own as an asset of monetary value. <br></p><p>Not to say lifers playing the game by industry standards had it good before streaming, artists have been getting fucked over on royalties and rights to their masters since the phonograph. What makes our contemporary record industry different is that it has merged with platform capitalism at its highest level of infrastructure. One simply cannot survive off streaming alone without a means of getting playlisted by the platform algorithm, which often incentivizes those that can afford to game the system to do so. Streamfarming, algo-boosting, and paid bots have become quite profitable industries if you know where to look. If companies like Spotify can't make a profit and are propped up by shareholders, how should you be expected to earn a living using their platforms unless you find a way to game the system? Do you have 20 smartphones lying around, per chance?<br></p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/Sghh3F0nis9Mdb0YerKvd2EJBuOMUYwXZtk_rBFbMoUCF5VY6OrmkmIiSb3R39kYfqa96daVEfExnIt-RXURQn4OonjIm0yskkOYDO4vl2WNA32Lf12TrxVot0LhRleBJxyGj5UcW8wF0onVKRgCwg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="542" height="529"></figure><p><br>For an artist, choosing to not engage in self-promotion via streaming or social media platforms is in and of itself an act of protest. To knowingly cut oneself off from an algorithmically boosted audience makes it that much harder for an artist to get heads out to shows to pay full price at the door and buy merch directly after the concert. Hell, even I am married to the platform as an independent music teacher at this point. Instagram can get heads through the door, unfortunate as it may be, it may be the reason why you’re reading this letter at all. <br></p><p>With the way the cookie crumbles, Spotify and other streaming platforms can that much more likely get you a Bandcamp sale from someone who discovered you while scrolling the algorithm. To live that life as an online musician means to constantly release work across all platforms, to take advantage of every Bandcamp Friday. Any potential means of monetization is worthwhile, hustle equals survival. It's the sigma grindset on a quest for minimum wage.<br></p><p>The founder of Spotify, Daniel Ek, tells us that artists need to make more work if they want to benefit from the new systems in place. Nothing has changed for lifers. Hustle hard, no sleep. Believe me, just because I am acknowledging the sad truth doesn’t mean I don’t want to burn it all to the ground in a blaze of glory. Or at the very least demand a Spotify healthcare plan for any and all artists on the platform in a country that otherwise won’t provide it for them. A boy can dream. I digress.</p><p>It’s because of this harsh reality that romanticizing the lifer lifestyle in 21st century Brooklyn, or any other major American city, as anything other than the struggle it is can be incredibly dangerous. Millennials and Zoomers have been sold the lie that the big cities remain a bastion for cutting edge arts and culture, let alone that they are even livable for working artists. What year do they expect us to believe it is? The <em>New York Times</em> loves to gloat about the local renaissance happening in Bushwick in the Arts Section while covering a tech CEO who recently bought a brownstone in Bed-Stuy for a cool five million in the Real Estate section. <br></p><p>No-wave New York and its grandchildren are all but dead when rent costs as much as it does. The Lower East Side is a weekend playground for New Jersey’s most drunk. People who live in a closet in the shadow of a Chinatown fish market on one side and the Manhattan Bridge on the other pay upwards of $3000 monthly for the privilege to do so. The ground level of McKibben Lofts is now home to yoga studios and organic markets. The live/work loft space of the solitary working artist in the 2010s is nothing more than a leftover set on a soundstage for HBO’s <em>Girls, </em>unless you’re looking for nine roommates<em>. </em><br></p><p>The Lifer game is an uphill battle in the big cities, where nightlife can be both the main source of income for many, while also being the major contributing factor to the rising costs of living. It’s for this reason that I assume that some of the most successful lifers I’ve encountered have made the bulk of their careers outside of the big cities. Those that have sought a smaller, tight-knit <em>community</em> over a larger <em>scene,</em> a sort of preferred intimacy over a massive reach,<em> </em>are bound to find it wherever they end up. The lifer game is a social one first and foremost. It’s one of survival, but also one that requires a greater community to prosper. So as long as we put ourselves out there as a resource and provide a means of putting each other on bills and a place to crash whenever a head rolls into town, <strong>DIY will never die</strong>, struggle it may be. <br></p><p>The third and final general category of musical career I’ve encountered, and the one I’ve found myself in for some time now, is that of the Dayjobber. It’s the category you seem to find yourself falling into, Billy; a line of work you claim makes you a failure as an artist by choosing to enter. I wish I could strangle you through the computer screen, Billy, lovingly, of course, to snap you out of the toxic mindset you’ve found yourself in. Okay, no strangling, how about a very stern bearhug? <br></p><p>Not only are you not a failure for coming to terms with the fact that you’d prefer the peace of mind and mental health benefits that financial stability outside the arts can provide, but you’re also that much more of a professional artist as a result of this acknowledgment. A day job not only pays the bills, but also provides a necessary break for your ears and brain. You know your work requires sustenance, time and money doesn’t grow on trees, so you seek to build a cushion to support your artistic practices. It doesn’t matter if you’re not practicing every day or gigging every weekend. You make it work on your terms, at your own pace. It’s more than what most do in their adult age. At least you're fucking doing it.<br></p><p>I’m telling you this as a guy who has never paid his bills off gigs and record sales alone. I make fucking noise music and walls of ambient textures, dude, I don’t expect to receive a big advance from Atlantic or Sony to crank out my algorithmically generated pulsating meter nowness anytime soon. I came to terms early in my musical career with the fact that I needed to find a trade if I wanted to pay my bills and continue to pursue my art. The key is finding something you’re actually good at. <br></p><p>When I was in college, I spent my weekends working as a direct support professional for various schools and learning centers for kids in New York with special needs. The plan at the time was to just get into special education at the vocational level out of college. The work was gratifying and steady on its own and I was a decent teacher, a music-related profession wasn’t even in the cards at the time. It was only through years of working as a DSP that I eventually started to plan out syllabi that combined both K-12 education and music technology. <br></p><p>This ultimately pushed me to go to graduate school for an MFA in Sonic Arts and Electronic Music. Hey, Billy, this was when we first met! I was only a humble, broke, and eager graduate student working as an adjunct music instructor and studio assistant when you enrolled in my Music in Global America class. I didn’t re-enter the academy simply to better myself as an artist, I did so to expand my abilities to teach, talk, and write about music technology. Words, education, and technology are my trade, it just so happens that it now relates to the words, education, and technology of music on a full-time schedule. <br></p><p>And I am by no means alone in my pursuits to pay my bills outside of gigs and record sales. Philip Glass, boring as I may find him, is a hero of mine in this regard. He has gone on record to say “I expected to have a day job for the rest of my life”, having worked alongside fellow minimalist Steve Reich and sculptor Richard Serra as a moving company in the 1960s, as well as a cab driver up to (and during) the premiere of <em>Einstein on the Beach</em> in 1976. John Cage never stopped foraging for rare mushrooms and truffles - what was once his primary skill for sustenance during the Great Depression had transformed into his main source of income well into the peak of his career as a composer and public intellectual. Michelin Star restaurants in Manhattan paid top dollar for Cage’s occasional fungal findings upstate, enough to make sure he could spend the majority of his time composing and writing, sometimes with and or about mushrooms themselves. Charles Ives never stopped selling life insurance. Fenriz, of Norwegian Black Metal pioneers Darkthrone, never stopped being a postman and a union member. The list goes on.<br></p><p>You’re not a failure by being a dayjobber, Billy, you’re an artist, just like the rest of us. So what if you aren’t some rich kid from the Upper East Side who had the privilege of being stuck in a practice room since Kindergarten? Sure that kid can shred, but do you really want to be that person? You’re playing shows, making records, and selling merch online, all without daddy’s money to hold you down. You’re making it happen without the head start that Richy Rich got the second he was born. Be proud of that! Knowing that the game is rigged is liberating! Just because the music industry lacks meritocracy doesn’t mean you can’t blow these assholes out of the water through your craft. Your experiences outside their bubble will only foster more creativity as a result. <br></p><p>So what if it takes a bit longer because you can only dedicate an occasional evening or weekend to work on your new record? So long as you dedicate yourself to that time, as little as it may be, so long as you allow the public to hear what you’ve been up to, whenever or wherever that may be, Billy, then you’ll never be a failure. You’re still alive, aren’t you? Then you can make the time, but no rush.</p><p>Your former professor,</p><p>Max</p><hr><div><p><em><a href="https://klangmag.co/ear-fatigue/www.maxalper.xyz">Max Alper</a> aka La Meme Young is a composer, educator, writer, and cultural worker.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Bcachefs-Plans-For-Linux-6.6">https://www.phoronix.com/news/Bcachefs-Plans-For-Linux-6.6</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36693109">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><img alt="LINUX STORAGE" src="https://www.phoronix.com/assets/categories/linuxstorage.webp" width="100" height="100"></p><p>
While the <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/search/Linux+6.5">Linux 6.5</a> kernel merge window just ended days ago and there still is two months to go until that stable release, already the lead developer of the <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/search/Bcachefs">Bcachefs</a> file-system is working to get the code merged for Linux 6.6.
</p><p>
Lead Bcachefs developer Kent Overstreet submitted <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Bcachefs-PR-Linux-6.5">the Bcachefs merge request for Linux 6.5</a> but it didn't end up being merged this cycle. <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-6.5-Bcachefs-Unlikely">Concerns were raised on the mailing list</a> around changes to the kernel outside of the Bcachefs module itself and other disagreements taking place on that lengthy kernel mailing list thread.
</p><p>
In the <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-6.5-rc1">Linux 6.5-rc1 announcement</a> Linus Torvalds commented, "<em>The biggest single mention probably goes to what wasn't merged, with the bcachefs pull request resulting in a long thread (we didn't hit a hundred emails yet, but it's not far away). Let's calm this party down.</em>"
</p><p>
Overstreet appears undeterred and is working on getting Bcachefs enhancements made and appears that he will be submitting a new merge request for what will be the Linux 6.6 cycle.
</p><p>
Overstreet published <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20230712025459.dbzcjtkb4zem4pdn@moria.home.lan/">a new mailing list post</a> today that outlines some of the latest changes. The Bcachefs kernel code is now clearly marked as "EXPERIMENTAL", another code reviewer has been added for Bcachefs, there is other code review happening, some of the prerequisite patches have been pruned down, and discussions over the QA process.
</p><p><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=2023&amp;image=bcachefs_for_linux_66" alt="Bcachefs Git"></p>
<p>He ended the LKML post with:
</p><blockquote>And here's the branch I intend to re-submit next merge window, as it currently sits:
<p>
<a href="https://evilpiepirate.org/git/bcachefs.git/log/?h=bcachefs-for-upstream">
<br>https://evilpiepirate.org/git/bcachefs.git/log/?h=bcachefs-for-upstream</a></p></blockquote>
<p>That's where he continues queuing the latest Bcachefs file-system code  and for what he's hoping will be in good enough shape for acceptance into the Linux 6.6 merge window when it kicks off in about two months.</p><p>Those wishing to learn more about the Bcachefs file-system features can do so via the project site at <a href="https://bcachefs.org/">bcachefs.org</a>.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>
	<a href="https://variety.com/t/milan-kundera/" id="auto-tag_milan-kundera" data-tag="milan-kundera">Milan Kundera</a>, whose 1984 novel “The Unbearable Lightness of Being” was turned into an Oscar-nominated film, has died at the age of 94.</p>



<p>
	Kundera died Tuesday in Paris after a long illness, Jindra Pavelková, a representative of the Moravian Library, the Czech library housing his personal collection, told <em>Variety</em> Wednesday. </p>



<p>
	“Milan Kundera was a writer who reached whole generations of readers across all continents and achieved global fame,” Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala said. “He leaves behind not only notable fiction, but also significant essay work.”

</p>



<p>
	The 1988 film adaptation of “The Unbearable Lightness of Being” was directed by <a href="https://variety.com/t/philip-kaufman/" id="auto-tag_philip-kaufman" data-tag="philip-kaufman">Philip Kaufman</a> and starred Daniel Day-Lewis and Juliette Binoche. Jean-Claude Carrière and Kaufman were Oscar nominated for adapted screenplay, and Sven Nykvist was Oscar nominated for cinematography.

	</p>




<p>
	Other films based on his writing include 1965’s “Nobody Will Laugh,” directed by Hynek Bocan, which won the Grand Prize at Mannheim-Heidelberg Film Festival, 1969’s “The Joke,” directed by Jaromil Jires, which played at San Sebastián Film Festival, and 1969’s “I, the Distressing God,” directed by Antonín Kachlík.</p>



<p>
	Kundera was born in Brno, Czechoslovakia, in 1929. His first novel, “The Joke,” was published in 1967, and was greeted with acclaim. French poet Louis Aragon called it “one of the greatest novels of the century.” </p>



<p>
	In 1968, the Prague Spring, a period of liberal reform in Czechoslovakia, was crushed by Soviet troops. Kundera criticized the invasion, and was subsequently ostracized by the Communist regime, and sacked from his post at Prague’s FAMU film school. “The Unbearable Lightness of Being” centers on the Prague Spring and its aftermath.</p>



<p>
	In 1975, he emigrated to France, and was stripped of his Czechoslovak citizenship four years later. He became a French citizen in 1981, and lived in France until his death, although he was made a citizen of the Czech Republic in 2019.</p>

 Building the Theory</h2>

</section>
<section>
<p>
Most of my free time for the past few years has gone into building out the compiler's foundations so that it could support this unexplored approach.
</p>

</section>
<section>
<p>
It was <i>hard</i>. Any kind of borrowing system is already pretty complex, but they also requires full generics, which are notoriously difficult. <a href="#note4" data-noteid="4">4</a> <a href="#note5" data-noteid="5">5</a>
</p>

</section>
<section>
<p>
On top of that, an entire new compiler stage was needed to get regions and generational references to work seamlessly together. <a href="#note6" data-noteid="6">6</a>
</p>

</section>
<section>
<p>
Finally, a few months ago, <b>the regions prototype was finished</b>. It's rough around the edges, <a href="#note7" data-noteid="7">7</a> but it successfully compiled something for the first time.
</p>

</section>
<section>
<p>
With that, I made the <a href="https://github.com/Verdagon/RegionsBenchmarks/blob/main/cellular-automata/CellularAutomata.vale">first ever zero-check Vale program</a>! <a href="#note8" data-noteid="8">8</a>
</p>
<p>
It was a program that uses <a href="https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/tutorials/generate-random-cave-levels-using-cellular-automata--gamedev-9664">Cellular Automata</a> to generate a level for a roguelike game.
</p>

</section>

<section>
<p>
Of course, it didn't work perfectly at first. Compilers are tricky. The slightest misstep in the compiler code will add extra instructions to the resulting assembly, causing artificial overhead in the final program. And sometimes, there's extra little bits of information you need to pass to the optimizer (or the CPU itself!) to trick it into the most optimal behavior.
</p>

</section>
<section>
<p>
To help me track down the problems, I kept comparing its assembly to the assembly generated by Vale's "unsafe" modes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span>unsafe_no_bounds</span> is similar to C; all memory-safety protections are turned off, and it only uses raw pointers for everything, rather than generational references.
</li>
<li>
<span>unsafe_with_bounds</span> then adds bounds checking for array accesses, similar to how Rust does it.
</li>
</ul>

</section>
<section>
<p>
After a couple months of tracking down differences, the resulting assembly looked nearly identical to Vale's <span>unsafe_with_bounds</span> mode! Every difference was expected <a href="#note9" data-noteid="9">9</a> and everything looked pretty reasonable.
</p>

</section>
<section>
<h2 id="the-benchmarks">
 The Benchmarks</h2>
<p>
Finally, I benchmarked the program again:
</p>

</section>
<div>
      
      <pre><code>Summary
  './build_unsafe_no_bounds/main' ran
    1.18 ± 0.01 times faster than './build_unsafe_with_bounds/main'
    1.18 ± 0.01 times faster than './build_safe_fastest/main'</code></pre>
    </div>
<section>
<p>
Success! Vale's normal mode (<span>safe_fastest</span> here) showed no slowdowns compared to only bounds checking.
</p>

</section>
<section>
<p>
In other words, <b>this approach has no observable overhead.</b> <a href="#note10" data-noteid="10">10</a>
</p>

</section>
<section>
<p>
Finally seeing this was a shock, a relief, and almost surreal. No overhead! We knew it was possible in theory, but seeing it happen for real still felt very surprising.
</p>

</section>
<section>
<p>
Feel free to play with it! Just build from the <a href="https://github.com/Verdagon/Vale/tree/regions">regions branch</a>, check out the <a href="https://github.com/Verdagon/RegionsBenchmarks">benchmarking scripts</a>, and to ask any questions in the <a href="https://discord.gg/SNB8yGH">discord server</a>.
</p>

</section>
<section>
<p>
And before we get too excited, let's keep these important details in mind:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
This is not benchmarking against languages like C and Rust directly. Those compilers have years of unrelated optimizations that would just confound the experiment, so I compare with <span>unsafe_no_bounds</span> and <span>unsafe_with_bounds</span> to isolate those variables and get a more accurate comparison of the memory safety approaches.
</li>
<li>
This was benchmarked on a Razer Blade 15" 2018 (512GB SSD) running Ubuntu 22.04, using <a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine">hyperfine</a> inside a <a href="https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/man1/cset-shield.1.html">cset shield</a>.
</li>
<li>
When I made larger programs, I observed quite a bit of optimizer noise, <a href="#note11" data-noteid="11">11</a> where a minor change in one area would swing the measurements one way or another. <a href="#note12" data-noteid="12">12</a> Benchmark results for the larger programs seemed rather fragile. We'll need a large set of benchmark programs to isolate away this optimizer noise.
</li>
<li>
In a larger program (a tiny roguelike game), I also observed that the optimizer didn't merge two identical branches of an if-statement, and missed a couple other obvious optimizations. I'm not sure how the presence of an integer (especially unread!) would affect this. It could even be a bug in LLVM, which are pretty common.
</li>
</ul>

</section>
<section>
<p>
That last one hints that we might want our own Vale-specific pre-optimizer, similar to Rust's <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/tree/main/cranelift">Cranelift</a>, since LLVM was designed more with C in mind. <a href="#note13" data-noteid="13">13</a>
</p>

</section>
<section>
<p>
Still, even with these details, these results are quite promising!
</p>

</section>
<section>
<h2 id="what-does-this-mean">
 What does this mean?</h2>
<p>
This means that generational references and regions combine to form a memory safety approach that is very, very fast.
</p>

</section>
<section>
<p>
It also means that this approach is actually viable, and could be desirable for quite a few software domains. A domain might desire this approach if:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
It wants more predictable latency than tracing garbage collection.
</li>
<li>
It wants better performance and cache friendliness than reference counting.
</li>
<li>
It wants to prototype and iterate more easily than with borrow checking.
</li>
</ul>

</section>
<section>
<h2 id="where-does-vale-go-from-here">
 Where does Vale go from here?</h2>
<p>
The above benchmarks compared Vale's safe mode to Vale's unsafe modes, for a more accurate comparison of the memory safety approaches.
</p>

</section>
<section>
<p>
However, there are still a few things to do before Vale can really go toe-to-toe with languages like C and C++. <a href="#note14" data-noteid="14">14</a>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
I'll need to start a Vale-specific pre-optimizer, since LLVM's optimizer seems to have some problems reasoning about generations and immutability.
</li>
<li>
Vale still needs to support inline data, instead of putting all structs on the heap. (Note that that wouldn't affect the above benchmarks, which didn't use any structs.)
</li>
<li>
Regions are still just in the prototype phase. I'll need to smoothe out the rough edges, pay down a bit of tech debt, and merge this code in before doing anything else.
</li>
</ul>

</section>
<section>
<p>
After this is merged in, I'll be making the standard library use regions so that every user will benefit from them, even if their main program code doesn't use regions directly.
</p>

</section>
<section>
<p>
It's a pretty ambitious endeavor, so it's not clear how long this will take. With enough sponsorship I can work on this full-time, so if you believe in the direction we're heading, please consider sponsoring on <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/ValeLang">GitHub</a> or <a href="https://www.patreon.com/user/about?u=5018675">Patreon</a>!

<div id="note4" data-noteid="4">
<p><span>4</span></p><section>
<p>
Previously, Vale had templates (like C++), not full generics.
</p>

</section>
</div>
<div id="note5" data-noteid="5">
<p><span>5</span></p><section>
<p>
It took the Golang team a decade to figure out their generics, and I don't blame them at all for that, after this struggle with generics!

</div>
<div id="note6" data-noteid="6">
<p><span>6</span></p><section>
<p>
Under the hood, it reduces regions to "pure height" integers: negative for region generic parameters, zero for the default region, and increasing positive for every pure block.
</p>

</section>
</div>
<div id="note7" data-noteid="7">
<p><span>7</span></p><section>
<p>
For example, its compile errors are very, <i>very</i> verbose, and there are a lot of things that just trigger assertions in the compiler still. I'll be fixing all of these before merging it into the main branch.
</p>

</section>
</div>
<div id="note8" data-noteid="8">
<p><span>8</span></p><section>
<p>
You can count how many generation checks in a program via the <span>--print_mem_overhead true</span> compiler flag.
</p>

<div id="note9" data-noteid="9">
<p><span>9</span></p><section>
<p>
The only expected difference is that it put a pseudo-random generation number at the top of every allocation, though it never needed to read it for any generation checks. This is really just a montonically increasing register under the hood, to keep things fast. We'll be able to remove this once we add <a href="https://verdagon.dev/blog/zero-cost-borrowing-regions-part-2-isolates">isolates</a> or <span>uni</span>que references.
</p>

</section>
</div>
<div id="note10" data-noteid="10">
<p><span>10</span></p><section>
<p>
There could be overhead in theory, in the form of a nonatomic monotonically incrementing integer used for filling generations. It doesn't seem to affect the performance, likely because registers and simple arithmetic operations are so cheap on modern CPUs compared to the real bottleneck which is memory latency. The optimizer also often optimizes it out, since it sees nobody using these generations.
</p>

</section>
</div>
<div id="note11" data-noteid="11">
<p><span>11</span></p><section>
<p>
This is not the same thing as benchmark noise. This benchmarking setup reported very consistent run times (hence the <span>± 0.01</span> in the output).
</p>

</section>
</div>
<div id="note12" data-noteid="12">
<p><span>12</span></p><section>
<p>
In fact, when I switched the size of the generation numbers, it consistently had negative overhead (<span>1.13 ± 0.01</span>), which is a bit weird considering that there weren't that many generation numbers in the program anyway. It did change the register allocations, so I suspect that's dwarfing any performance differences from anything actually semantically different in the programs.
</p>

</section>
</div>
<div id="note13" data-noteid="13">
<p><span>13</span></p><section>
<p>
We might want this anyway, as I'm pretty sure LLVM would treat generational references as undefined behavior, if it could figure out that we're intentionally accessing released memory.

            <span>Abstract:</span>  Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have demonstrated unprecedented
capabilities in multiple AI tasks. However, hardware inefficiencies have become
a significant factor limiting the democratization of LLMs. We propose Chiplet
Cloud, an ASIC supercomputer architecture that optimizes total cost of
ownership (TCO) per token for serving generative LLMs. Chiplet Cloud fits all
model parameters inside the on-chip SRAMs to eliminate bandwidth limitations
while moderating the die size to improve system costs while leveraging software
mappings to overcome data communication overhead. We propose a comprehensive
design methodology that accurately explores a spectrum of major design
trade-offs in the joint space of hardware-software and generates a detailed
performance-cost analysis on all valid design points. We evaluate Chiplet Cloud
on four popular LLMs. Compared to GPU and TPU, our architecture can achieve up
to 94x and 15x improvement in TCO/Token respectively, significantly reducing
the cost for realistically serving modern LLMs.
