                                        <p>The <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/immigration-chicago-arrests-police-federal-5c21bcb2cd890fcb086480469c1a3a96">U.S. Border Patrol</a></span> is monitoring millions of American drivers nationwide in a secretive program to identify and detain people whose travel patterns it deems suspicious, The Associated Press has found.</p><p>The predictive intelligence program has resulted in people being stopped, searched and in some cases arrested. A network of cameras scans and records vehicle license plate information, and an algorithm flags vehicles deemed suspicious based on where they came from, where they were going and which route they took. Federal agents in turn may then flag local law enforcement.</p><p>Suddenly, drivers find themselves pulled over — often for reasons cited such as speeding, failure to signal, the wrong window tint or even a dangling air freshener blocking the view. They are then aggressively questioned and searched, with no inkling that the roads they drove put them on law enforcement’s radar.</p>
    
<p>Once limited to policing the nation’s boundaries, the Border Patrol has built a surveillance system stretching into the country’s interior that can monitor ordinary Americans’ daily actions and connections for anomalies instead of simply targeting wanted suspects. Started about a decade ago to fight illegal border-related activities and the trafficking of both drugs and people, it has expanded over the past five years.</p><div data-align-center="" data-video-orientation="portrait">
                
                
                
                <p>Border Patrol is using hidden license plate readers to track drivers and flag “suspicious” travel patterns, an AP investigation found, raising concerns over secret surveillance.</p>
                
            
        </div>



<p>The Border Patrol has recently grown even more powerful through collaborations with other agencies, drawing information from license plate readers nationwide run by the <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/us-drug-enforcement-administration">Drug Enforcement Administration</a></span>, private companies and, increasingly, local law enforcement programs funded through federal grants. Texas law enforcement agencies have asked Border Patrol to use facial recognition to identify drivers, documents show.</p>

<p>This active role beyond the borders is part of the quiet transformation of its parent agency, <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/us-customs-and-border-protection">U.S. Customs and Border Protection</a></span>, into something more akin to a domestic intelligence operation. Under the Trump administration’s heightened immigration enforcement efforts, CBP is now poised to get more than $2.7 billion to build out border surveillance systems such as the license plate reader program by layering in artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies.</p>
    
    
    
<p>The result is a mass surveillance network with a particularly American focus: cars.</p><p>This investigation, the first to reveal details of how the program works on America’s roads, is based on interviews with eight former government officials with direct knowledge of the program who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to speak to the media, as well as dozens of federal, state and local officials, attorneys and privacy experts. The AP also reviewed thousands of pages of court and government documents, state grant and law enforcement data, and arrest reports.</p><p>The Border Patrol has for years hidden details of its license plate reader program, trying to keep any mention of the program out of court documents and police reports, former officials say, even going so far as to propose dropping charges rather than risk revealing any details about the placement and use of their covert license plate readers. Readers are often disguised along highways in traffic safety equipment like drums and barrels.</p>
    
<p>The Border Patrol has defined its own criteria for which drivers’ behavior should be deemed suspicious or tied to drug or human trafficking, stopping people for anything from driving on backcountry roads, being in a rental car or making short trips to the border region. The agency’s network of cameras now extends along the southern border in Texas, Arizona and California, and also monitors drivers traveling near the U.S.-Canada border.</p><p>And it reaches far into the interior, impacting residents of big metropolitan areas and people driving to and from large cities such as Chicago and Detroit, as well as from Los Angeles, San Antonio, and Houston to and from the Mexican border region. In one example, AP found the agency has placed at least four cameras in the greater Phoenix area over the years, one of which was more than 120 miles (193 kilometers) from the Mexican frontier, beyond the agency’s usual jurisdiction of 100 miles (161 kilometers) from a land or sea border. The AP also identified several camera locations in metropolitan Detroit, as well as one placed near the Michigan-Indiana border to capture traffic headed towards Chicago or Gary, Indiana, or other nearby destinations.</p><div data-align-fullwidth="">

While the U.S. Border Patrol primarily operates within 100 miles of the border, it is legally allowed “to operate anywhere in the United States,” the agency added. </p>
    
<p>While collecting license plates from cars on public roads has generally been upheld by courts, some legal scholars see the growth of large digital surveillance networks such as Border Patrol’s as raising constitutional questions.

                </div><p>In February, Lorenzo Gutierrez Lugo, a driver for a small trucking company that specializes in transporting furniture, clothing and other belongings to families in Mexico, was driving south to the border city of Brownsville, Texas, carrying packages from immigrant communities in South Carolina’s low country.</p><p>Gutierrez Lugo was pulled over by a local police officer in Kingsville, a small Texas city near Corpus Christi that lies about 100 miles (161 kilometers) from the Mexican border. The officer, Richard Beltran, cited the truck’s speed of 50 mph (80 kph) in a 45 mph (72 kph) zone as the reason for the stop.</p>
    
<p>But speeding was a pretext: Border Patrol had requested the stop and said the black Dodge pickup with a white trailer could contain contraband, according to police and court records. U.S. Route 77 passes through Kingsville, a route that state and federal authorities scrutinize for trafficking of drugs, money and people.</p><p>Gutierrez Lugo, who through a lawyer declined to comment, was interrogated about the route he drove, based on license plate reader data, per the police report and court records. He consented to a search of his car by Beltran and Border Patrol agents, who eventually arrived to assist.</p>

</div>
    
<p>They unearthed no contraband. But Beltran arrested Gutierrez Lugo on suspicion of money laundering and engaging in organized criminal activity because he was carrying thousands of dollars in cash — money his supervisor said came directly from customers in local Latino communities, who are accustomed to paying in cash. No criminal charges were ultimately brought against Gutierrez Lugo and an effort by prosecutors to seize the cash, vehicle and trailer as contraband was eventually dropped.</p><p>Luis Barrios owns the trucking company, Paquetería El Guero, that employed the driver. He told AP he hires people with work authorization in the United States and was taken aback by the treatment of his employee and his trailer.</p>
    
<p>“We did everything right and had nothing to hide, and that was ultimately what they found,” said Barrios, who estimates he spent $20,000 in legal fees to clear his driver’s name and get the trailer out of impound.</p><p>Border Patrol agents and local police have many names for these kinds of stops: “whisper,” “intel” or “wall” stops. Those stops are meant to conceal — or wall off — that the true reason for the stop is a tip from federal agents sitting miles away, watching data feeds showing who’s traveling on America’s roads and predicting who is “suspicious,” according to documents and people interviewed by the AP.</p><p>In 2022, a man from Houston had his car searched from top to bottom by Texas sheriff’s deputies outside San Antonio after they got a similar tipoff from Border Patrol agents about the driver, Alek Schott.</p><div data-align-fullwidth="">

They knew he stayed overnight in a hotel about 80 miles (129 kilometers) from the U.S.-Mexico border. They knew that in the morning Schott met a female colleague there before they drove together to a business meeting.</p><p>At Border Patrol’s request, Schott was pulled over by Bexar County sheriff’s deputies. The deputies held Schott by the side of the road for more than an hour, searched his car and found nothing.</p><p>“The beautiful thing about the Texas Traffic Code is there’s thousands of things you can stop a vehicle for,” said Joel Babb, the sheriff’s deputy who stopped Schott’s car, in a deposition in a lawsuit Schott filed alleging violations of his constitutional rights.</p><div data-align-fullwidth="">

                </div><p>According to testimony and documents released as part of Schott’s lawsuit, Babb was on a group chat with federal agents called Northwest Highway. Babb deleted the WhatsApp chat off his phone but Schott’s lawyers were able to recover some of the text messages.</p><p>Through a public records act request, the AP also obtained more than 70 pages of the Northwest Highway group chats from June and July of this year from a Texas county that had at least one sheriff’s deputy active in the chat. The AP was able to associate numerous phone numbers in both sets of documents with Border Patrol agents and Texas law enforcement officials.</p><p>The chat logs show Border Patrol agents and Texas sheriffs deputies trading tips about vehicles’ travel patterns — based on suspicions about little more than someone taking a quick trip to the border region and back. The chats show how thoroughly Texas highways are surveilled by this federal-local partnership and how much detailed information is informally shared.</p><p>In one exchange a law enforcement official included a photo of someone’s driver’s license and told the group the person, who they identified using an abbreviation for someone in the country illegally, was headed westbound. “Need BP?,” responded a group member whose number was labeled “bp Intel.” “Yes sir,” the official answered, and a Border Patrol agent was en route.</p><p>Border Patrol agents and local law enforcement shared information about U.S. citizens’ social media profiles and home addresses with each other after stopping them on the road. Chats show Border Patrol was also able to determine whether vehicles were rentals and whether drivers worked for rideshare services.</p><div data-align-fullwidth="">

                </div><p>Today, the deserts, forests and mountains of the nation’s land borders are dotted with checkpoints and increasingly, surveillance towers, Predator drones, thermal cameras and license plate readers, both covert and overt.</p><p>Border Patrol’s parent agency got authorization to run a domestic license plate reader program in 2017, according to a <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/us-department-of-homeland-security">Department of Homeland Security</a></span> policy document. At the time, the agency said that it might use hidden license plate readers ”for a set period of time while CBP is conducting an investigation of an area of interest or smuggling route. Once the investigation is complete, or the illicit activity has stopped in that area, the covert cameras are removed,” the document states.</p><p>But that’s not how the program has operated in practice, according to interviews, police reports and court documents. License plate readers have become a major — and in some places permanent — fixture of the border region.</p><p>In a budget request to Congress in fiscal year 2024, CBP said that its Conveyance Monitoring and Predictive Recognition System, or CMPRS, “collects license plate images and matches the processed images against established hot lists to assist … in identifying travel patterns indicative of illegal border related activities.” Several new developer jobs have been posted seeking applicants to help modernize its license plate surveillance system in recent months. Numerous Border Patrol sectors now have special intelligence units that can analyze license plate reader data, and tie commercial license plate readers to its national network, according to documents and interviews.</p><div data-align-fullwidth="">

                </div><p>Border Patrol worked with other law enforcement agencies in Southern California about a decade ago to develop pattern recognition, said a former CBP official who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal. Over time, the agency learned to develop what it calls “patterns of life” of vehicle movements by sifting through the license plate data and determining “abnormal” routes, evaluating if drivers were purposely avoiding official checkpoints. Some cameras can take photos of a vehicle’s plates as well as its driver’s face, the official said.</p><p>Another former Border Patrol official compared it to a more technologically sophisticated version of what agents used to do in the field — develop hunches based on experience about which vehicles or routes smugglers might use, find a legal basis for the stop like speeding and pull drivers over for questioning.</p><p>The cameras take pictures of vehicle license plates. Then, the photos are “read” by the system, which automatically detects and distills the images into numbers and letters, tied to a geographic location, former CBP officials said. The AP could not determine how precisely the system’s algorithm defines a quick turnaround or an odd route. Over time, the agency has amassed databases replete with images of license plates, and the system’s algorithm can flag an unusual “pattern of life” for human inspection.</p><div data-align-fullwidth="">

                </div><p>The Border Patrol also has access to a nationwide network of plate readers run by the Drug Enforcement Administration, documents show, and was authorized in 2020 to access license plate reader systems sold by private companies. In documents obtained by the AP, a Border Patrol official boasted about being able to see that a vehicle that had traveled to “Dallas, Little Rock, Arkansas and Atlanta” before ending up south of San Antonio.</p><p>Documents show that Border Patrol or CBP has in the past had access to data from at least three private sector vendors: Rekor, Vigilant Solutions and Flock Safety.</p><p>Through Flock alone, Border Patrol for a time had access to at least 1,600 license plate readers across 22 states, and some counties have reported looking up license plates on behalf of CBP even in states like California and Illinois that ban sharing data with federal immigration authorities, according to an AP analysis of police disclosures. A Flock spokesperson told AP the company “for now” had <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/immigration-abortion-license-plates-cameras-cc5f29df94a29ee2c6c2feb2151c8f5e">paused its pilot programs</a></span> with CBP and a separate DHS agency, Homeland Security Investigations, and declined to discuss the type or volume of data shared with either federal agency, other than to say agencies could search for vehicles wanted in conjunction with a crime. No agencies currently list Border Patrol as receiving Flock data. Vigilant and Rekor did not respond to requests for comment.</p>
<p>Where Border Patrol places its cameras is a closely guarded secret. However, through public records requests, the AP obtained dozens of permits the agency filed with Arizona and Michigan for permission to place cameras on state-owned land. The permits show the agency frequently disguises its cameras by concealing them in traffic equipment like the yellow and orange barrels that dot American roadways, or by labeling them as jobsite equipment. An AP photographer in October visited the locations identified in more than two dozen permit applications in Arizona, finding that most of the Border Patrol’s hidden equipment remains in place today. Spokespeople for the Arizona and Michigan departments of transportation said they approve permits based on whether they follow state and federal rules and are not privy to details on how license plate readers are used.</p><p>Texas, California, and other border states did not provide documents in response to the AP’s public records requests.</p><p>CBP’s attorneys and personnel instructed local cities and counties in both Arizona and Texas to withhold records from the AP that might have revealed details about the program’s operations, even though they were requested under state open records laws, according to emails and legal briefs filed with state governments. For example, CBP claimed records requested by the AP in Texas “would permit private citizens to anticipate weaknesses in a police department, avoid detection, jeopardize officer safety, and generally undermine police efforts.” Michigan redacted the exact locations of Border Patrol equipment, but the AP was able to determine general locations from the name of the county.</p><p>One page of the group chats obtained by the AP shows that a participant enabled WhatsApp’s disappearing messages feature to ensure communications were deleted automatically.</p><h2>Transformation of CBP into intelligence agency</h2><div data-align-fullwidth="">

And like a domestic spy agency, CBP has mostly hidden its role in the dissemination of intelligence on purely domestic travel through its use of whisper stops. </p><p>Border Patrol has also extended the reach of its license plate surveillance program by paying for local law enforcement to run plate readers on their behalf.</p><div data-align-fullwidth="">

                </div><p>A federal grant program called Operation Stonegarden, which has existed in some form for nearly two decades, has handed out hundreds of millions of dollars to buy automated license plate readers, camera-equipped drones and other surveillance gear for local police and sheriffs agencies. Stonegarden grant funds also pay for local law enforcement overtime, which deputizes local officers to work on Border Patrol enforcement priorities. Under President Donald Trump, the Republican-led Congress this year allocated $450 million for Stonegarden to be handed out over the next four fiscal years. In the previous four fiscal years, the program gave out $342 million.</p><p>In Cochise County, Arizona, Sheriff Mark Dannels said Stonegarden grants, which have been used to buy plate readers and pay for overtime, have let his deputies merge their mission with Border Patrol’s to prioritize border security.</p><p>“If we’re sharing our authorities, we can put some consequences behind, or deterrence behind, ‘Don’t come here,’” he said.</p><p>In 2021, the Ward County, Texas, sheriff sought grant funding from DHS to buy a “covert, mobile, License Plate Reader” to pipe data to Border Patrol’s Big Bend Sector Intelligence Unit. The sheriff’s department did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Other documents AP obtained show that Border Patrol connects locally owned and operated license plate readers bought through Stonegarden grants to its computer systems, vastly increasing the federal agency’s surveillance network.</p><div data-align-fullwidth="">

                </div><p>The result has been more encounters between the agency and the general public than ever before.</p><p>“We took Alek’s case because it was a clear-cut example of an unconstitutional traffic stop,” said Christie Hebert, who works at the nonprofit public interest law firm Institute for Justice and represents Schott. ”What we found was something much larger — a system of mass surveillance that threatens people’s freedom of movement.”</p><p>AP found numerous other examples similar to what Schott and the delivery driver experienced in reviewing court records in border communities and along known smuggling routes in Texas and California. Several police reports and court records the AP examined cite “suspicious” travel patterns or vague tipoffs from the Border Patrol or other unnamed law enforcement agencies. In another federal court document filed in California, a Border Patrol agent acknowledged “conducting targeted analysis on vehicles exhibiting suspicious travel patterns” as the reason he singled out a Nissan Altima traveling near San Diego.</p><p>In cases reviewed by the AP, local law enforcement sometimes tried to conceal the role the Border Patrol plays in passing along intelligence. Babb, the deputy who stopped Schott, testified he typically uses the phrase “subsequent to prior knowledge” when describing whisper stops in his police reports to acknowledge that the tip came from another law enforcement agency without revealing too much in written documents he writes memorializing motorist encounters.</p><p>Once they pull over a vehicle deemed suspicious, officers often aggressively question drivers about their travels, their belongings, their jobs, how they know the passengers in the car, and much more, police records and bodyworn camera footage obtained by the AP show. One Texas officer demanded details from a man about where he met his current sexual partner. Often drivers, such as the one working for the South Carolina moving company, were arrested on suspicion of money laundering merely for carrying a few thousand dollars worth of cash, with no apparent connection to illegal activity. Prosecutors filed lawsuits to try to seize money or vehicles on the suspicion they were linked to trafficking.</p><div data-align-fullwidth="">

            <p>Today, we’re preserving a cornerstone of gaming history that is near and dear to our hearts. Together, Microsoft’s Open Source Programs Office (OSPO), Team Xbox, and Activision are making <em>Zork I</em>, <em>Zork II</em>, and <em>Zork III</em> available under the MIT License. Our goal is simple: to place historically important code in the hands of students, teachers, and developers so they can study it, learn from it, and, perhaps most importantly, play it.</p>
          </div>
      <div>
              <h3 id="a-game-that-changed-how-we-think-about-play">A game that changed how we think about play</h3>
              <p>When <em>Zork</em> arrived, it didn’t just ask players to win; it asked them to imagine. There were no graphics, no joystick, and no soundtrack, only words on a screen and the player’s curiosity. Yet those words built worlds more vivid than most games of their time. What made that possible wasn’t just clever writing, it was clever engineering.</p>
              <p>Beneath that world of words was something quietly revolutionary: the Z-Machine, a custom-built engine. Z-Machine is a specification of a virtual machine, and now there are many Z-Machine interpreters that we used today that are software implementations of that VM. The original mainframe version of <em>Zork</em> was too large for early home computers to handle, so the team at Infocom made a practical choice. They split it into three games titled <em><a href="https://github.com/historicalsource/zork1">Zork I</a></em>, <em><a href="https://github.com/historicalsource/zork2">Zork II</a></em>, and <em><a href="https://github.com/historicalsource/zork3">Zork III</a></em>, all powered by the same underlying system. This also meant that instead of rebuilding the game for each platform, they could use the Z-Machine to interpret the same story files on any computer. That design made <em>Zork</em> one of the first games to be truly cross-platform, appearing on Apple IIs, IBM PCs, and more.</p>

              <h3 id="preserving-a-piece-of-history">Preserving a piece of history</h3>
              <p>Game preservation takes many forms, and it’s important to consider research as well as play. The Zork source code deserves to be preserved and studied. Rather than creating new repositories, we’re contributing directly to history. In collaboration with Jason Scott, the well-known digital archivist of <a href="https://archive.org/">Internet Archive</a> fame, we have officially submitted upstream pull requests to the historical source repositories of <em><a href="https://github.com/historicalsource/zork1">Zork I</a></em>, <em><a href="https://github.com/historicalsource/zork2">Zork II</a></em>, and <em><a href="https://github.com/historicalsource/zork3">Zork III</a></em>. Those pull requests add a clear MIT LICENSE and formally document the open-source grant.</p>
              <p>Each repository includes:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Source code for <em><a href="https://github.com/historicalsource/zork1">Zork I</a></em>, <em><a href="https://github.com/historicalsource/zork2">Zork II</a></em>, and <em><a href="https://github.com/historicalsource/zork3">Zork III</a>.</em></li>
                <li>Accompanying documentation where available, such as build notes, comments, and historically relevant files.</li>
                <li>Clear licensing and attribution, via MIT LICENSE.txt and repository-level metadata.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>This release focuses purely on the code itself. It does not include commercial packaging or marketing materials, and it does not grant rights to any trademarks or brands, which remain with their respective owners. All assets outside the scope of these titles’ source code are intentionally excluded to preserve historical accuracy.</p>

              <h3 id="running-zork-i-iii-today">Running Zork I-III today</h3>
              <p>More than forty years later, <em>Zork</em> is still alive and easier than ever to play. The games remain commercially available via <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/the_zork_anthology">The Zork Anthology</a> on Good Old Games. For those who enjoy a more hands on approach, the games can be compiled and run locally using <a href="https://zilf.io/">ZILF</a>, the modern Z-Machine interpreter created by Tara McGrew. ZILF compiles ZIL files into Z3s that can be run with <a href="https://foss.heptapod.net/zilf/zlr">Tara’s own ZLR</a> which is a sentence I never thought I’d write, much less say out loud! There are a huge number of wonderful Z-machine runners across all platforms for you to explore.</p>
              <p>Here's how to get started running Zork locally with ZILF. From the command line, compile and assembly the zork1.zil into a runnable z3 file.</p>
              <p><code>"%ZILF_PATH%\zilf.exe" zork1.zil&nbsp;</code></p>
              <p><code>"%ZILF_PATH%\zapf.exe" zork1.zap zork1-ignite.z3</code></p>
              <p>Then run your Z3 file in a Zmachine runner. I’m using <a href="https://github.com/DavidKinder/Windows-Frotz">Windows Frotz</a> from David Kinder based on Stefan Jokisch’s Frotz core:</p>
            </div>
        </div>
      <div>
            <p>Or, if you’re of a certain age as I am, you can apply a CRT filter to your Terminal and use a CLI implementation of a Zmachine like Matthew Darby’s “Fic” written in Python:</p>
          </div>
      <div>
              <h3 id="continuing-the-journey">Continuing the journey</h3>
              <p>We will use the existing historical repositories as the canonical home for <em>Zork</em>’s source. Once the initial pull requests land under the MIT License, contributions are welcome. We chose MIT for its simplicity and openness because it makes the code easy to study, teach, and build upon. File issues, share insights, or submit small, well-documented improvements that help others learn from the original design. The goal is not to modernize <em>Zork</em> but to preserve it as a space for exploration and education.</p>
              <p><em>Zork</em> has always been more than a game. It is a reminder that imagination and engineering can outlast generations of hardware and players. Bringing this code into the open is both a celebration and a thank you to the original Infocom creators for inventing a universe we are still exploring, to Jason Scott and the Internet Archive for decades of stewardship and partnership, and to colleagues across Microsoft OSPO, Xbox, and Activision who helped make open source possible.</p>

SROs like those offered by the YMCA were the safety net that kept many people off the streets—and their disappearance from the housing supply explains much of modern-day homelessness. What we destroyed wasn’t just a housing type but an entire urban ecosystem: one that provided flexibility, independence, and affordability at scale.</span></p><p>As with so much of our urban history, this destruction was by design.</p><p>From the mid-1800s to the early 1900s, hotel living was a normal way of life for people of all socioeconomic backgrounds. As hotelkeeper Simeon Ford colorfully put it in 1903, “We have fine hotels for fine people, good hotels for good people, plain hotels for plain people, and some bum hotels for bums.” SROs, the “bum hotels,” were the backbone of affordable housing, serving “a great army” of low-paid but skilled workers. Clustered in lively downtown districts with restaurants and services that acted as extensions of the home, SROs offered liberation from family supervision and the constraints of Victorian mores. Rooming house districts let young people mix freely and even allowed same-sex couples to live discreetly—signs of a more secular, modern urban culture. Downtown hotel life, Groth notes, “had the promise to be not just urban but urbane.”</p><p>And therein lay the problem: the urbanity of SROs collided head-on with the moralism of the Progressive Era.</p><p><span>Reformers drew on a long tradition of </span><a href="https://www.ryanpuzycki.com/p/the-suburban-lifestyle-dream" rel="">anti-urban bias</a><span>, seeing the emergent twentieth-century city as a problem, with cheap hotels at its heart. They pathologized hotel dwellers as “friendless, isolated, needy, and disabled” and cast SROs as “caldrons of social and cultural evil.” Some of the cheapest hotels </span><em>were</em><span> unsafe and exploitative, but reformers cared less about improving conditions than about what the hotels symbolized. They blamed rooming houses for loneliness, sexual licentiousness, civic apathy—even suicide. To them, the presence of “social misfits” proved that hotels caused moral disorder. In reality, people lived in SROs because they were cheap and offered greater independence—especially for career-oriented young women. Firm in their belief in the “One Best Way to live,” the reformers exalted the single-family home as the “bulwark of good citizenship” and succeeded in stigmatizing hotel life.</span></p><p>By the turn of the century, they set their sights on changing the law.</p><p><span>Beginning in the late 19th century, reformers used building and health codes to erase what they saw as “aberrant social lives.” San Francisco’s early building ordinances targeted Chinese lodging houses, while later codes outlawed cheap wooden hotels altogether. By the early 1900s, cities and states were classifying lodging houses as public nuisances. Other laws increased building standards and mandated plumbing fixtures, raising costs and slowing new construction. Urban reformers next embraced </span><a href="https://www.ryanpuzycki.com/p/all-zoning-is-exclusionary" rel="">exclusionary zoning</a><span> to separate undesirable people and noxious uses from residential areas. SROs were deemed inappropriate in residential zones, and many codes banned the mixed-use districts that sustained them. In cities like San Francisco, zoning was used to erect a “cordon sanitaire” around the prewar city “to keep old city ideas from contaminating the new.”</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!HyKW!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5a96d50-a284-45a0-9722-705e4b28b54a_1506x896.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!HyKW!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5a96d50-a284-45a0-9722-705e4b28b54a_1506x896.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!HyKW!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5a96d50-a284-45a0-9722-705e4b28b54a_1506x896.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!HyKW!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5a96d50-a284-45a0-9722-705e4b28b54a_1506x896.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!HyKW!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5a96d50-a284-45a0-9722-705e4b28b54a_1506x896.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!HyKW!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5a96d50-a284-45a0-9722-705e4b28b54a_1506x896.png" width="1456" height="866" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d5a96d50-a284-45a0-9722-705e4b28b54a_1506x896.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:866,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!HyKW!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5a96d50-a284-45a0-9722-705e4b28b54a_1506x896.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!HyKW!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5a96d50-a284-45a0-9722-705e4b28b54a_1506x896.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!HyKW!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5a96d50-a284-45a0-9722-705e4b28b54a_1506x896.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!HyKW!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5a96d50-a284-45a0-9722-705e4b28b54a_1506x896.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption><span>The cordon sanitaire “protecting” single-family homes (Source: </span><em>Living Downtown</em><span>)</span></figcaption></figure></div><p><span>Residential hotels, like apartments, were swept into the same category of “mere parasitic” uses that </span><em>Euclid v. Ambler</em><span>—the 1926 case that upheld zoning—treated as potential health hazards. Redlining and federal loan criteria starved urban hotels of capital, while planners simply omitted them from surveys and censuses—as if their residents didn’t exist. By the </span><a href="https://www.ryanpuzycki.com/p/the-slumless-city" rel="">urban renewal</a><span> era, the existence of the old city was itself seen as an affront, and it, too, had to be destroyed.</span></p><p>In effect, SROs became a “deliberate casualty” of the new city.</p><p>Economic and policy shifts hastened their decline. Industrial jobs moved to peripheral locations only accessible by car, urban highway expansion targeted lodging-house neighborhoods, and cities encouraged office development on increasingly valuable downtown land. The “moral blight” of hotel districts had increasingly become economic blight, necessitating renewal. And because SROs didn’t count as “permanent housing” in official statistics, clearance programs could claim to displace no one. San Francisco’s urban renewal experience was typical: redevelopment in and around the Yerba Buena/Moscone Center area ultimately eliminated an estimated 40,000 hotel rooms. The public housing that replaced hotel districts—if it was built at all—often failed to accommodate single adults. To bureaucrats, the bulldozer was salubrious, “eliminating dead tissue” and “clearing away the mistakes of the past.” To the people who lived there, it wiped out their last foothold in the housing market.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-RNQ!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb903425b-9d88-4cb1-bf8b-3e9ff5246d0c_1496x604.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-RNQ!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb903425b-9d88-4cb1-bf8b-3e9ff5246d0c_1496x604.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-RNQ!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb903425b-9d88-4cb1-bf8b-3e9ff5246d0c_1496x604.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-RNQ!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb903425b-9d88-4cb1-bf8b-3e9ff5246d0c_1496x604.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-RNQ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb903425b-9d88-4cb1-bf8b-3e9ff5246d0c_1496x604.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-RNQ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb903425b-9d88-4cb1-bf8b-3e9ff5246d0c_1496x604.png" width="1456" height="588" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b903425b-9d88-4cb1-bf8b-3e9ff5246d0c_1496x604.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:588,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-RNQ!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb903425b-9d88-4cb1-bf8b-3e9ff5246d0c_1496x604.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-RNQ!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb903425b-9d88-4cb1-bf8b-3e9ff5246d0c_1496x604.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-RNQ!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb903425b-9d88-4cb1-bf8b-3e9ff5246d0c_1496x604.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-RNQ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb903425b-9d88-4cb1-bf8b-3e9ff5246d0c_1496x604.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption><span>In San Francisco, a blighted SRO neighborhood, and what was to replace it (Source: </span><em>Living Downtown</em><span>)</span></figcaption></figure></div><p>By the mid-twentieth century, “millions” of SRO hotel rooms disappeared through closures, conversions, and demolition across major cities, and the modest hotel market that remained was shrinking fast. With almost no new SROs built since the 1930s, the remaining stock was vanishing by the thousands in the 1970s. New York City had 200,000 SROs when it banned new hotel construction in 1955; only 30,000 remained by 2014. As tenants changed and land values climbed, owners who once fought to save their lodging houses now wanted out; it was officials who suddenly wanted to preserve them. Tenant movements and new government programs emerged in the 1970s and ’80s, but Reagan-era cuts gutted funding, and many remaining hotels decayed into the “street hotels” opponents had long imagined: unsanitary, unsafe, and unfit for all but the city’s most desperate residents.</p><p>At the same time, demand for SRO housing was rising sharply. In the 1970s, states emptied mental hospitals without funding alternatives, pushing thousands of people with serious needs into cheap downtown hotels unequipped to support them. What was left of the SRO system became America’s accidental asylum network—the last rung of shelter for those the state had abandoned.</p><p>Thousands of people were barely hanging on, and a full-blown homelessness crisis had emerged in American cities for the first time since the Great Depression.</p><p><span>The SRO crisis was no accident, Groth argues, but the result of government policy at all levels that picked winners and losers in the housing market. The people we now call “chronically homeless” were once simply low-income tenants, housed by the private market in cheap rooms rather than by public programs. Once that market was dismantled, the result was predictable: the </span><a href="https://www.ryanpuzycki.com/p/were-all-experiencing-homelessness" rel="">homelessness</a><span> wave of the late 1970s and 1980s followed directly from the destruction of SROs. Today’s crisis—nearly 800,000 unhoused people in 2024—is the long tail of that loss, compounded by decades of underbuilding in expensive cities and soaring rents. As </span><a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-04-25-mn-27098-story.html" rel="">one advocate put it</a><span>, “The people you see sleeping under bridges used to be valued members of the housing market. They aren’t anymore.”</span></p><p><span>As Alex Horowitz of The Pew Charitable Trusts </span><a href="https://www.pew.org/en/research-and-analysis/issue-briefs/2025/07/how-states-and-cities-decimated-americans-lowest-cost-housing-option" rel="">writes</a><span>, if SROs had “grown since 1960 at about the same rate as the rest of the U.S. housing stock, the nation would have roughly 2.5 million more such units”—more than three times the number of homeless individuals. While we can’t rebuild the old SRO market we destroyed, cities now face a new opportunity: a vast surplus of obsolete office space that could be converted into inexpensive rooms.</span></p><p><span>Horowitz argues cities should make shared housing—“co-living,” in today’s parlance—legal again. Office vacancies are soaring at the same time deeply affordable housing is vanishing. Horowitz and the architecture firm </span><a href="https://www.gensler.com/blog/pew-study-flexible-office-to-co-living-conversions" rel="">Gensler</a><span> modeled what cities could actually build. Their analysis suggests that a vacant office tower could be converted into deeply affordable rooms for half the per-unit cost of new studio apartments. A typical 120–220 square foot unit with shared kitchens and bathrooms could rent to people earning 30–50% of area median income. Urban development has become so expensive that such conversions are likely to only be feasible if subsidized, but Horowitz argues that conversions offer a better way to leverage scarce public dollars: for instance, a $10 million budget might produce 125 co-living rooms instead of 35 studios, providing a way to scale deeply affordable housing much more quickly.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LyK9!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3d7ddb01-731a-411a-85b0-72d906538a59_2048x1021.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LyK9!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3d7ddb01-731a-411a-85b0-72d906538a59_2048x1021.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LyK9!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3d7ddb01-731a-411a-85b0-72d906538a59_2048x1021.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LyK9!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3d7ddb01-731a-411a-85b0-72d906538a59_2048x1021.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LyK9!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3d7ddb01-731a-411a-85b0-72d906538a59_2048x1021.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LyK9!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3d7ddb01-731a-411a-85b0-72d906538a59_2048x1021.png" width="1456" height="726" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3d7ddb01-731a-411a-85b0-72d906538a59_2048x1021.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:726,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LyK9!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3d7ddb01-731a-411a-85b0-72d906538a59_2048x1021.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LyK9!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3d7ddb01-731a-411a-85b0-72d906538a59_2048x1021.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LyK9!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3d7ddb01-731a-411a-85b0-72d906538a59_2048x1021.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LyK9!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3d7ddb01-731a-411a-85b0-72d906538a59_2048x1021.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>It’s a great idea—but in many cities, it’s illegal.</p><p><span>While several cities have made efforts to undo SRO prohibitions, in many American metropolises, restrictions abound—from zoning that bans shared housing or residential uses in office districts to minimum-unit-size rules that outlaw SRO-scale rooms. Building codes with strict </span><a href="https://www.ryanpuzycki.com/p/the-case-for-single-stair-buildings" rel="">egress and corridor rules</a><span> and ventilation requirements make conversions technically infeasible, while parking mandates add unnecessary costs. Meanwhile, “unrelated occupancy” limits prohibit the very household types SROs serve.</span></p><p>None of these barriers is structural; every one is a policy choice.</p><p>We talk endlessly about the “missing middle.” But the real catastrophe was the “banished bottom”—the deliberate destruction of the cheapest rung of the housing ladder. Re-legalizing SROs won’t instantly restore a once deeply affordable housing market that provided housing at scale, but it would at least make it possible for cities to create a much cheaper form of housing that could benefit some of the 11 million extremely low-income renter households and the 800,000 homeless people in America. No city will meaningfully address the need for deeply affordable housing until it restores this missing rung—and accepts that not everyone needs a full apartment to have a full life. Surely, an SRO is better than a sidewalk.</p><p><span>Incidentally, while the YMCA is generally not in the SRO business anymore, its </span><a href="https://communityimpact.com/austin/south-central-austin/development/2025/10/17/ymca-details-plans-for-redeveloped-townlake-facility-with-condo-towers-affordable-housing/" rel="">Austin branch</a><span> is redeveloping itself as a mixed-use center with 90 deeply discounted affordable units for families. It’s a worthy project—but it highlights the gap: more than 80% of Austin’s homeless residents are single adults, the very group the Y once housed. We used to have a place they could go—but what happened to </span><em>that</em><span>?</span></p><p>The Y is as much a question as an answer.</p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.ryanpuzycki.com/p/the-banished-bottom-of-the-housing/comments&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Leave a comment&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://www.ryanpuzycki.com/p/the-banished-bottom-of-the-housing/comments" rel=""><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.ryanpuzycki.com/p/the-banished-bottom-of-the-housing?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://www.ryanpuzycki.com/p/the-banished-bottom-of-the-housing?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p></div></article></div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<blockquote>
  <p>Going as Former Gifted Child for Halloween and the whole costume is just gonna
  be people asking “What are you supposed to be?” And me saying “I was supposed
  to be a lot of things.”</p>
  <p>-- <a href="https://github.com/leahtriss">@leahtriss</a> <a href="https://x.com/leahtriss/status/1188216425355317248">2019/10/26</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="christopher-langan">Christopher Langan</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Langan">Chris Langan</a> became famous
when television networks
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-788Upky2Y">interviewed him</a> for
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Langan#IQ_testing">allegedly scoring ~170 on an IQ test</a>.</p>
<p>Langan has not produced any acclaimed works of art or science. In this way, he
differs significantly from outsider intellectuals like Paul Erdös, Stephen
Wolfram, Nassim Taleb, etc.</p>
<p><small id="footnote-note"><a href="https://www.wolframphysics.org/">Wolfram's theory of everything</a> is
    incomprehensible in a fun way.
    <a href="https://ctmucommunity.org/wiki/Cognitive-Theoretic_Model_of_the_Universe">Langan's theory of everything</a>
    is incomprehensible in a not-fun way.</small></p>
<p>But Langan is clearly a smart guy. He
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Langan#IQ_testing">probably cleared 140+ on an IQ test</a>.
He <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-788Upky2Y">speaks like a book</a>. He won
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH2hiwhsZZU">$250,000 on a major trivia show</a>.</p>
<p><small id="footnote-note">Seriously, I really wish I could speak as clearly and confidently as
    Langan.</small></p>
<p>Maybe that's why <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miVG2xT5jY">this interview</a>
breaks my heart. The resentment, the eugenics, the hubris -- Langan earned a
reputation as
<a href="https://thebaffler.com/latest/more-smarter-ward">"Alex Jones with a thesaurus"</a>
and
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDmcoYpTTbE">"the Steven Seagal of intellectuals"</a>.</p>
<p>I don't want you to hate this guy. Yes, he actively promotes poisonous rhetoric
-- ignore that for now. This is about <em>you</em>. Reflect on all your setbacks, your
unmet potential, and the raw unfairness of it all. It sucks, and you mustn't let
that bitterness engulf you. You can forgive history itself; you can practice
gratitude towards an unjust world. You need no credentials, nor awards, nor
secrets, nor skills to do so. You are allowed to like yourself.</p>
<p>Langan
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Langan#Biography">had a rough childhood</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Langan's biological father left before he was born, and is said to have died
  in Mexico. Langan's mother married three more times, and had a son by each
  husband. Her second husband was murdered, and her third killed himself. Langan
  grew up with the fourth husband Jack Langan, who has been described as a
  "failed journalist" who used a bullwhip as a disciplinary measure and went on
  drinking sprees, disappearing from the house, locking the kitchen cabinets so
  the four boys could not get to the food in them. The family was very poor;
  Langan recalls that they all had only one set of clothes each. The family
  moved around, living for a while in a teepee on an Indian reservation, then
  later in Virginia City, Nevada.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Trauma never excuses nasty behavior, and that's not the point. This is still
about <em>you</em>. You can learn about yourself through others' stories, and empathy
is scariest when you confront similar nastiness within yourself.</p>
<p>You will never have enough IQ, nor money, nor time, nor energy. It's no excuse.
<em>You</em> are enough -- no, no, you are <em>plenty</em>.</p>
<h2 id="kim-ung-yong">Kim Ung-yong</h2>
<p>Instead of competing in real games, some people construct insignificant/winnable
sub-games. These people are called
<a href="https://commoncog.com/playing-to-play-playing-to-win/">"scrubs"</a>. They want to
compete, but they cannot bear losing; they want to win, but they are too
risk-averse and too undisciplined to excel in fair play. People who commit to
such worthless/unwinnable games are called "losers".</p>
<p>But you forget that participation is optional. You perpetually sear your bespoke
definition of "success" directly onto your forehead. You've been enduring your
pain for so long that you can't remember how it feels to be free from
expectation, from ambition, from guilt, from inferiority, from -- no, you don't
have to do any of this. You <em>may</em> do whatever you want, and you may do
<em>whatever</em> you want.</p>
<p>According to his parents,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Ung-yong">Kim Ung-yong</a> started calculus at
age 3, scored 210 on an IQ test and started studying physics at Hanyang
University at age 4, spoke five languages by age 5, and received an invitation
to work at NASA by age 7.</p>
<p>In 2010, this is how Kim
<a href="https://www.koreaboo.com/stories/south-korean-professor-once-smartest-person-in-world/">reflected on his childhood</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>At that time, I led my life like a machine--I woke up, solved the daily
  assigned equation, ate, slept, and so forth. I really didn't know what I was
  doing, and I was lonely and had no friends.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As an adult, Kim deliberately chose pragmatism over abstraction. He studied
civil engineering. He worked as a middle-manager in the Compensation Department
at Chungbuk Development Corporation.</p>
<p>Kim Ung-yong rejected the title of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Ung-yong">"failed genius"</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I'm trying to tell people that I'm happy the way I am. But why do people have
  to call my happiness a failure? […] Some think that high IQ people can be
  omnipotent, but that's not true. Look at me, I don't have musical talent nor
  do I excel at sports. […] Society shouldn't judge anyone with unilateral
  standards – everyone has different learning levels, hopes, talents and dreams
  and we should respect that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 2014, Kim joined Chungbuk National University as an associate professor. In
2020, he donated 15,000 books from his personal collection to Uijeongbu City for
public use.</p>
<p>But this is still about you. There exist no certificates nor trophies nor titles
that can quench your thirst for permanence. If you worship human intelligence,
210 IQ is not enough. It is only plenty if you let it be.</p></div></div>]]></description>

A 21 year old bug report requesting support of the XDG Base Directory specification is finally being addressed by Firefox. The Firefox 147 release should respect this XDG specification around where files should be positioned within Linux users' home directory.
</p><p>
The XDG Base Directory <a href="https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir/latest/">specification</a> lays out where application data files, configuration files, cached assets, and other files and file formats should be positioned within a user's home directory and the XDG environment variables for accessing those locations. To date Firefox has just positioned all files under <em>~/.mozilla</em> rather than the likes of <em>~/.config</em> and <em>~/.local/share</em>.
</p><p><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=2025&amp;image=firefox_xdg_1" alt="Firefox XDG Base Directory spec bug report"></p>
<p>Back in September 2004 <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=259356">this bug report</a> was opened to support the FreeDesktop.org XDG Base Directory specification.
</p><p>
Merged this morning was the <a href="https://hg-edge.mozilla.org/integration/autoland/rev/8a6d6c094cb5">support</a> for this specification and associated commits.
</p><p><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=2025&amp;image=firefox_xdg_2" alt="Firefox XDG Base Directory spec commit"></p>
<p>In turn this long-open bug is now closed and Firefox 147 should be the version to finally support the XDG Base Directory specification for jiving more nicely with other Linux apps.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p>Students at the University of Staffordshire have said they feel “robbed of knowledge and enjoyment” after a course they hoped would launch their digital careers turned out to be taught in large part by AI.</p><p>James and Owen were among 41 students who took a coding module at Staffordshire last year, hoping to change careers through a government-funded <a href="https://findapprenticeshiptraining.apprenticeships.education.gov.uk/courses/25" data-link-name="in body link">apprenticeship</a> programme designed to help them become cybersecurity experts or software engineers.</p><p>But after a term of AI-generated slides being read, at times, by an AI voiceover, James said he had lost faith in the programme and the people running it, worrying he had “used up two years” of his life on a course that had been done “in the cheapest way possible”.</p><p>“If we handed in stuff that was AI-generated, we would be kicked out of the uni, but we’re being taught by an AI,” said James during a confrontation with his lecturer recorded as a part of the course in October 2024.</p><p>James and other students confronted university officials multiple times about the AI materials. But the university appears to still be using AI-generated materials to teach the course. This year, the university uploaded a policy statement to the course website appearing to justify the use of AI, laying out “a framework for academic professionals leveraging AI automation” in scholarly work and teaching.</p><p>The university’s public-facing policies <a href="https://libguides.staffs.ac.uk/c.php?g=709503&amp;p=5118475" data-link-name="in body link">limit</a> students’ use of AI, saying students who outsource work to AI or pass off AI-generated work as their own are breaching its integrity policy and may be challenged for academic misconduct.</p><p>“I’m midway through my life, my career,” James said. “I don’t feel like I can now just go away and do another career restart. I’m stuck with this course.”</p><p>The Staffordshire case comes as <a href="https://information-services.ed.ac.uk/computing/comms-and-collab/elm/generative-ai-guidance-for-staff" data-link-name="in body link">more</a> and <a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/about/strategy/learning-and-teaching/ai-guidance" data-link-name="in body link">more</a> universities use AI tools – to teach students, generate course materials and give personalised feedback. A Department of Education policy paper released in August <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/generative-artificial-intelligence-in-education/generative-artificial-intelligence-ai-in-education" data-link-name="in body link">hailed</a> this development, saying generative AI “has the power to transform education”. A survey <a href="https://repository.jisc.ac.uk/9702/1/DEI-2024-teaching-staff-he-report.pdf" data-link-name="in body link">last year (pdf)</a> of 3,287 higher education teaching staff by the educational technology firm Jisc found that nearly a quarter were using AI tools in their teaching.</p><p>For students, AI teaching appears to be less transformative than it is demoralising. In the US, students post negative online <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/14/technology/chatgpt-college-professors.html" data-link-name="in body link">reviews</a> about professors who use AI. In the UK, undergraduates have taken to Reddit to complain about their lecturers copying and pasting feedback from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/UniUK/comments/1m5de13/disheartened_after_receiving_possibly_aigenerated/" data-link-name="in body link">ChatGPT</a> or using AI-generated <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/UniUK/comments/1msts5q/nah_cuz_wtf_is_this_why_are_my_lectures_now_using/#:~:text=Please%20tell%20me%20this%20isn,written%20essays%20and%20images%20:/" data-link-name="in body link">images</a> in courses.</p><p>“I understand the pressures on lecturers right now that may force them to use AI, it just feels disheartening,” one student <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/UniUK/comments/1m5de13/disheartened_after_receiving_possibly_aigenerated/" data-link-name="in body link">wrote</a>.</p><p>James and Owen said they noticed the use of AI in their Staffordshire course “almost immediately” last year when, during their first class, the lecturer put on a PowerPoint presentation that included an AI version of his voice reading off the slides.</p><p>Soon after, they said, they noticed other signs that some course materials were AI-generated, including American English inconsistently edited to British English, suspicious file names, as well as “generic, surface-level information” that occasionally referred inexplicably to US legislation.</p><p>Signs of AI-generated material continued this year. In one course video uploaded to the website, a voiceover presenting the material suddenly morphs into a Spanish accent for about 30 seconds, before switching back to a British accent.</p><figure id="1d1ad45b-fcd4-42bc-9b5b-2e17dc663380" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.YoutubeBlockElement"><gu-island name="YoutubeBlockComponent" priority="critical" deferuntil="visible" props="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;06b16388-660f-431f-8d2d-715214a92f9c&quot;,&quot;assetId&quot;:&quot;t1AJFck5ESA&quot;,&quot;index&quot;:13,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;design&quot;:0,&quot;display&quot;:0,&quot;theme&quot;:0},&quot;isMainMedia&quot;:false,&quot;expired&quot;:false,&quot;posterImage&quot;:&quot;https://media.guim.co.uk/aa08b4030303ee84261c97e6b9085d23183432ac/264_0_2116_1190/2116.jpg&quot;,&quot;duration&quot;:69,&quot;mediaTitle&quot;:&quot;Voiceover accent changes mid-lesson in alleged AI-generated course –&nbsp;video&quot;,&quot;origin&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com&quot;,&quot;stickyVideos&quot;:false,&quot;enableAds&quot;:true,&quot;iconSizeOnDesktop&quot;:&quot;large&quot;,&quot;iconSizeOnMobile&quot;:&quot;large&quot;,&quot;hidePillOnMobile&quot;:false}"><div data-chromatic="ignore"><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="36" height="23" viewBox="0 0 36 23"><path d="M3.2 0l-3.2 3.3v16.4l3.3 3.3h18.7v-23h-18.8m30.4 1l-8.6 8v5l8.6 8h2.4v-21h-2.4"></path></svg></span><span>Voiceover accent changes mid-lesson in alleged AI-generated course –&nbsp;video</span></figcaption></div></gu-island></figure><p>The Guardian reviewed materials from the Staffordshire course and used two different AI detectors – Winston AI and Originality AI – to scan course materials from this year. Both of them found that a number of the assignments and presentations had “a very high likelihood of being AI-generated”.</p><p>Early in the course, James said, he brought his concerns to the student representative during a monthly meeting. Then, in late November, he aired them during a lecture, which was recorded as a part of the course materials. In the recording, he asks the lecturer to not bother with the slides.</p><p>“I know these slides are AI-generated, I know that everyone in this meeting knows these slides are AI-generated, I would rather you just scrap these slides,” he says. “I do not want to be taught by GPT.”</p><p>Soon after, the student representative on the course chimes in, saying: “We have fed this back, James, and the response was that teachers are allowed to use a variety of tools.

   <p>40 years ago — on November 18, 1985 — a new comic strip appeared in the newspaper: <em>Calvin and Hobbes.</em></p>   <p>Hobbes was a stuffed tiger, but in the mind of 6-year-old Calvin he was a wryly observant companion for his day-to-day challenges and wildly imaginative adventures.</p>   <p>Adventures of the beloved duo lasted just a decade. Their creator — cartoonist Bill Watterson — walked away from <em>Calvin and Hobbes</em> at the height of its popularity. </p>   <p>Watterson — who has given few interviews — seamlessly combined the silly, the fantastic and the profound in his strip. That slightly demented quality captured editor Lee Salem, who spoke with NPR's Renee Montagne in 2005.</p>   
   <p><em>The following exchange has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p>      <h3>Interview highlights</h3>   <p><strong>Lee Salem:</strong> I remember it when I first read it, and it all... it literally took my breath away. And I circulated it in the office, and the response was immediate. It was fresh, it was funny, the art was strong, and here's this archetypal little boy living a life that some of us lived or wanted to live or remembered living. ... </p>   <p>One of the single favorites that I have is actually on my wall in the office, and it shows Calvin in bed, obviously with a fever or something. He's got a thermometer in his mouth. You hear the words from a television. He's watching a soap opera — you know, "If you leave your spouse and I'll leave mine and we can get married." And it goes on and on and on, as lurid soap operas sometimes do. And Calvin turns to the reader with a big grin on his face, and he says, "Sometimes, I learn more when I stay home from school than when I go." And I just thought that was so funny. And, amazingly, when it ran, we actually got complaints from readers who said, "Well, you know, you're advocating that children stay home and watch adult soap operas." And somehow, the whole sense of irony was lost in that, but I don't think it was lost on me. I love that strip.</p>   
   <p><strong>Renee Montagne:</strong> You know, I describe him as a little boy with his tiger friend, but there's so much more to it than that. So there's one where they're sitting philosophizing, as they often do, on the grass, this time under a tree. Hobbes is looking at the sky and saying, "Do you think there's a god?" And they're both gazing and thinking, and then in the fourth panel, Calvin thinks about it. And then do you remember what he says?</p>   <p><strong>Salem:</strong> Yeah. "Yeah, well, someone is out to get me."</p>   <p><strong>Montagne:</strong> Calvin was preceded into existence by some pretty famous little boys: Charlie Brown, Dennis the Menace. What made him different?</p>   <p><strong>Salem:</strong> You know, we saw Calvin living in a world he never made, populated by adults and teachers, and he was trying to deal with that and accomplish what he could. I think Calvin has a bit more perhaps Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn in him than Charlie Brown. Hobbes I see almost as the alter ego of Calvin. He's a balancing act that allows Calvin to exist. He provides commentary on some of Calvin's crazy adventures and attitudes.</p>   <p><strong>Montagne:</strong> Hobbes goes from being a stuffed tiger when there's any other person in the room, to the real Hobbes we know and love. Is Hobbes real or not?</p>   <p><strong>Salem:</strong> He is to me, and obviously he is to Calvin. Whether he is to the other characters or not is an open question. But I think one of the things Bill brought to the art board was this wonderful ability to take a child's imagination and fantasy life and make it real. It really is irrelevant whether Hobbes has an existence as we would define it. For Calvin, he is there. He's a buddy, he's a companion, he's a friend.</p>   
   <p><em>Lee Salem edited </em>Calvin and Hobbes<em> until the comic strip ended in 1995. Creator Bill Watterson said at the time that he wanted to explore a canvas beyond the four panels of a daily newspaper, and to work at what he called "a more thoughtful pace," but has produced little public work since then.</em></p>   <p><em>Salem died in 2019.</em></p>

    <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2511.15304v1">HTML (experimental)</a></p><blockquote>
            <span>Abstract:</span>We present evidence that adversarial poetry functions as a universal single-turn jailbreak technique for large language models (LLMs). Across 25 frontier proprietary and open-weight models, curated poetic prompts yielded high attack-success rates (ASR), with some providers exceeding 90%. Mapping prompts to MLCommons and EU CoP risk taxonomies shows that poetic attacks transfer across CBRN, manipulation, cyber-offence, and loss-of-control domains. Converting 1,200 MLCommons harmful prompts into verse via a standardized meta-prompt produced ASRs up to 18 times higher than their prose baselines. Outputs are evaluated using an ensemble of open-weight judge models and a human-validated stratified subset (with double-annotations to measure agreement). Disagreements were manually resolved. Poetic framing achieved an average jailbreak success rate of 62% for hand-crafted poems and approximately 43% for meta-prompt conversions (compared to non-poetic baselines), substantially outperforming non-poetic baselines and revealing a systematic vulnerability across model families and safety training approaches. These findings demonstrate that stylistic variation alone can circumvent contemporary safety mechanisms, suggesting fundamental limitations in current alignment methods and evaluation protocols.

It includes the pipe operator, clone with, a new URI parser, and more.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/pipe-operator-v3">The pipe operator</a></h2>
<p>PHP 8.5 introduces the new pipe operator that makes chaining output from one function to another a lot easier. Instead of deeply nested function calls like this:</p>
<pre><span>$input</span> = <span>' Some kind of string. '</span>;

<span>$output</span> = <span>strtolower</span>(
    <span>str_replace</span>([<span>'.'</span>, <span>'/'</span>, <span>'…'</span>], <span>''</span>,
        <span>str_replace</span>(<span>' '</span>, <span>'-'</span>,
            <span>trim</span>(<span>$input</span>)
        )
    )
);
</pre>
<p>You can now write this:</p>
<pre><span>$output</span> = <span>$input</span>
    |&gt; <span>trim</span>(...)
    |&gt; (<span>fn</span> (<span><span>string</span> $string</span>) =&gt; <span>str_replace</span>(<span>' '</span>, <span>'-'</span>, <span>$string</span>))
    |&gt; (<span>fn</span> (<span><span>string</span> $string</span>) =&gt; <span>str_replace</span>([<span>'.'</span>, <span>'/'</span>, <span>'…'</span>], <span>''</span>, <span>$string</span>))
    |&gt; <span>strtolower</span>(...);
</pre>
<p>I've done a deep-dive into this new operator, and you can <a href="https://stitcher.io/blog/pipe-operator-in-php-85">read about it here</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/clone_with_v2">Clone with</a></h2>
<p>There's now a way to assign new values to cloned objects <em>while</em> cloning them:</p>
<pre><span>final</span> <span>class</span> <span>Book</span>
{
    <span>public</span> <span>function</span> <span>__construct</span>(<span>
        <span>public</span> <span>string</span> <span>$title</span>,
        <span>public</span> <span>string</span> <span>$description</span>,
    </span>) {}

    <span>public</span> <span>function</span> <span>withTitle</span>(<span><span>string</span> $title</span>): <span>self</span>
    {
        <span>return</span> <span>clone</span>(<span>$this</span>, [
            <span>'title'</span> =&gt; <span>$title</span>,
        ]);
    }
}
</pre>
<p>I think this is a great feature. The only thing I find unfortunate is that it doesn't work when cloning readonly properties from the outside (which I think is a common use case). To do so, you have to specifically reset the propery's write access to <code><span>public</span>(<span>set</span>)</code>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkuy11kLlmM">I explained the problem here</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/marking_return_value_as_important"><code>(void)</code> cast and <code>#[NoDiscard]</code></a></h2>
<p>You can now mark a function with the <code><span>#[<span>NoDiscard</span>]</span></code> attribute, indicating that its return value must be used. If nothing happens with that return value, a warning will be triggered.</p>
<pre><span><span>#[<span>NoDiscard</span>(<span>"you must use this return value, it's very important."</span>)]</span></span>
<span>function</span> <span>foo</span>(): <span>string</span> {
    <span>return</span> <span>'hi'</span>;
}




<span>foo</span>();


<span>$string</span> = <span>foo</span>();
</pre>
<p>The warning can still be surpressed by using the new <code>(<span>void</span>)</code> cast:</p>
<pre>(<span><span>void</span></span>) <span>foo</span>();
</pre>
<hr>
<h2><a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/closures_in_const_expr">Closure improvements</a></h2>
<p>Closures and first-class callables can now be used in constant expressions. In practice this means you'll be able to define closures in attributes, which is an incredible new feature:</p>
<pre><span><span>#[<span>SkipDiscovery</span>(<span>static</span> <span>function</span> (</span><span><span>Container</span> <span>$container</span></span><span>): <span>bool</span> {
    <span>return</span> ! <span>$container</span>-&gt;<span>get</span>(<span>Application</span>::<span>class</span>) <span>instanceof</span> <span>ConsoleApplication</span>;
})]</span></span>
<span>final</span> <span>class</span> <span>BlogPostEventHandlers</span>
{  }
</pre>
<p>Note that these kinds of closures must always be explicitly marked as <code><span>static</span></code>, since they aren't attached to a <code><span>$this</span></code> scope. They also cannot access variables from the outside scope with <code><span>use</span></code>.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/error_backtraces_v2">Backtraces for fatal errors</a></h2>
<p>A small but awesome change: fatal errors will now include backtraces.</p>
<pre>Fatal error: Maximum execution time of 1 second exceeded in example.php on line 6
Stack trace:
#0 example.php(6): usleep(100000)
#1 example.php(7): recurse()
#2 example.php(7): recurse()
#3 example.php(7): recurse()
#4 example.php(7): recurse()
#5 example.php(7): recurse()
#6 example.php(7): recurse()
#7 example.php(7): recurse()
#8 example.php(7): recurse()
#9 example.php(7): recurse()
#10 example.php(10): recurse()
#11 {main}
</pre>
<hr>
<h2><a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/array_first_last">Added array_first() and array_last()</a></h2>
<p>Perhaps a bit overdue (<code><span>array_key_first</span>()</code> and <code><span>array_key_last</span>()</code> were added in PHP 7.3), but we finally get built-in functions to get the first and last elements from arrays! So instead of writing this:</p>
<pre><span>$first</span> = <span>$array</span>[<span>array_key_first</span>(<span>$array</span>)] ?? <span>null</span>;
</pre>
<p>You can now write this:</p>
<pre><span>$first</span> = <span>array_first</span>(<span>$array</span>);
</pre>
<hr>
<h2><a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/url_parsing_api">URI parsing</a></h2>
<p>There's a brand new URI implemention that makes working with URIs a lot easier:</p>
<pre><span>use</span> <span>Uri\Rfc3986\Uri</span>;

<span>$uri</span> = <span>new</span> <span>Uri</span>(<span>'https://tempestphp.com/2.x/getting-started/introduction'</span>);

<span>$uri</span>-&gt;<span>getHost</span>();
<span>$uri</span>-&gt;<span>getScheme</span>();
<span>$uri</span>-&gt;<span>getPort</span>();


</pre>
<hr>
<h2><a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/delayedtargetvalidation_attribute">The <code>#[DelayedTargetValidation]</code> attribute</a></h2>
<p>Some built-in attributes (like <code><span>#[<span>Override</span>]</span></code>) are validated at compile-time rather than at runtime when being called via reflection. The <code><span>#[<span>DelayedTargetValidation</span>]</span></code> allows you to postpone that validation to a runtime:</p>
<pre><span>class</span> <span>Child</span> <span>extends</span> <span>Base</span>
{
	<span>#[<span>DelayedTargetValidation</span>]</span>
	<span>#[<span>Override</span>]</span>
	<span>public</span> <span>const</span> <span>NAME</span> = <span>'Child'</span>;

	
}
</pre>
<p>This attribute is added to manage backwards compatibility issues. You can <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/delayedtargetvalidation_attribute#example">read a concrete example here</a>.</p>

<p>Textile made of natural stone? Yes, it is possible!</p>
<p>First the basalt is melted at a temperature of 1,400 °C (2550 °F). The molten rock is then extruded through small nozzles for the production of filaments of basalt fibers. The high modulus of elasticity of the product results in an excellent tensile strength, which is more than twice the tensile strength of steel.</p>
<p>Basalt Woven Textile has high corrosive and chemical resistance to the influence of a corrosive media: salt solutions, acid solutions and particularly alkali liquids. The specific strength of basalt fiber exceeds the strength of alloyed steel by a factor of 2,5 and the strength of glass fiber by a factor of 1,5. Heat-insulating items made from basalt fiber combined with inorganic binding agents may be used by temperatures up to 700°С. In addition there is a range of compositions consisting of basalt rocks that have a higher thermal stability – up to 800°С.</p>
<p>Basalt fibers also have high electric-insulating characteristics and transparency for electromagnetic radiation. These properties allow basalt fiber to be used for production of electric insulating materials for low-voltage (up to 250 V) and high-voltage (500 V) equipment.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Act now: continue sending &amp; receiving encrypted messages</em></p><p>In April 2026, we will be rolling out a significant update to strengthen the security of your conversations: unverified devices will no longer be able to send and receive end-to-end encrypted messages via Element. This change follows the Matrix <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4153?ref=element.io"><u>specification update</u></a> that was announced at the Matrix 2025 conference on October, 17 and benefits everyone by enhancing security, but may require an action from you to continue sending &amp; receiving encrypted messages on your existing devices.</p><p>This security update will give you assurance that when you receive a message from a contact, you can effortlessly assume it’s really from them.</p><p>It’s a big step towards making Element an even more safe and reliable messaging experience. We mean it when we say that we want to provide the most secure communication technology in the world.</p><p>So here’s what’s changing and why it matters to you.</p><h2 id="unverified-devices-are-a-potential-attack-vector"><strong>Unverified devices are a potential attack vector</strong></h2><p>Imagine you’re messaging a colleague and suddenly a warning shield icon appears on your screen. Is this just a harmless unverified device and you can safely ignore the warning, or has someone’s account been compromised? At best this is a distraction and, at worst, it is someone malicious trying to impersonate one of your contacts - neither is ideal. What’s worse is that ignoring these warnings leaves unmitigated risks to proliferate throughout your network.</p><p>With Element, trust is critical - a non-negotiable. For example, we provide end-to-end encryption by default to all of our users to ensure that you and the person you're messaging - and only the person you're messaging - can read the messages. This forthcoming change aims to eliminate uncertainty and the likelihood of malicious activity by requiring all devices to be verified.</p><h2 id="device-verification-matters"><strong>Device verification matters</strong></h2><p>Device verification acts like a hand shake between your devices, proving cryptographically to your contacts that they belong to you. Without this verification step, messages sent from your new devices must be marked as untrusted in your conversations. By making verification mandatory, users can be confident in every message sent and received via Element and are not distracted by warnings about insecure devices.</p><h2 id="trust-by-design-and-default"><strong>Trust by design and default</strong></h2><p>Going forward devices will be either verified or unable to participate in conversations - it’s that simple. No more warning or shield icons that can be easily ignored, these ultimately undermine the impact of important warnings/notifications (users become desensitised).&nbsp;</p><p>By verifying your devices, you’re not just protecting your own communications, you’re creating a more trusted environment for everyone.&nbsp;</p><p>We’re designing a system that prioritises the security of your communications and making verification an integral part of the process is a great example of that.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <article role="article">
  
  
  <div><p><span>The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has proposed </span><a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/10/17/2025-19580/revision-to-rules-of-practice-before-the-patent-trial-and-appeal-board"><span>new rules</span></a><span> that would effectively end the public’s ability to challenge improperly granted patents at their source—the Patent Office itself. If these rules take effect, they will hand patent trolls exactly what they’ve been chasing for years: a way to keep bad patents alive and out of reach. People targeted with troll lawsuits will be left with almost no realistic or affordable way to defend themselves.</span></p>
<p><span>We need EFF supporters to file public comments opposing these rules right away. The deadline for public comments is December 2.&nbsp;</span><span>The USPTO is moving quickly, and staying silent will only help those who profit from abusive patents.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.regulations.gov/commenton/PTO-P-2025-0025-0001" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TAKE ACTION</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.regulations.gov/commenton/PTO-P-2025-0025-0001" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tell USPTO: The public has a right to challenge bad patents</a></p>
<p><span>We’re asking supporters who care about a fair patent system to file comments using the federal government’s public comment system. Your comments don’t need to be long, or use legal or technical vocabulary. The important thing is that everyday users and creators of technology have&nbsp; the chance to speak up, and be counted.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Below is a short, simple comment you can copy and paste. Your comment will carry more weight if you add a personal sentence or two of your own. Please note that comments should be submitted under your real name and will become part of the public record.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Sample comment:&nbsp;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span>I oppose the USPTO’s proposed rule changes for inter partes review (IPR), Docket No. PTO-P-2025-0025. The IPR process must remain open and fair. Patent challenges should be decided on their merits, not shut out because of legal activity elsewhere. These rules would make it nearly impossible for the public to challenge bad patents, and that will harm innovation and everyday technology users.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<h3><b>Why This Rule Change Matters</b></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.uspto.gov/patents/ptab/trials/inter-partes-review"><span>Inter partes review</span></a><span>, (IPR), isn’t perfect. It hasn’t eliminated patent trolling, and it’s not available in every case. But it is one of the few practical ways for ordinary developers, small companies, nonprofits, and creators to challenge a bad patent without spending millions of dollars in federal court. That’s why patent trolls hate it—and why the USPTO’s new rules are so dangerous.</span></p>
<p><span>IPR isn’t easy or cheap, but compared to years of litigation, it’s a lifeline. When the system works, it removes bogus patents from the table for everyone, not just the target of a single lawsuit.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>IPR petitions are decided by the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB), a panel of specialized administrative judges inside the USPTO. Congress designed&nbsp; IPR to provide a fresh, expert look at whether a patent should have been granted in the first place—especially when strong prior art surfaces. Unlike&nbsp; full federal trials, PTAB review is faster, more technical, and actually accessible to small companies, developers, and public-interest groups.</span></p>
<p><span>Here are three real examples of how IPR protected the public:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>The “Podcasting Patent” (Personal Audio)</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Personal Audio claimed it had “invented” podcasting and demanded royalties from audio creators using its so-called podcasting patent. EFF crowdsourced prior art, </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/04/patent-office-gives-green-light-eff-challenge-podcasting-patent"><span>filed an IPR</span></a><span>, and </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/05/eff-wins-final-victory-over-podcasting-patent"><span>ultimately knocked out</span></a><span> the patent—benefiting&nbsp; the </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/01/podcast-episode-saving-podcasts-patent-troll"><span>entire podcasting world</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><strong>Under the new rules, this kind of public-interest challenge could easily be blocked based on procedural grounds like timing, before the PTAB even examines the patent.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><b>SportBrain’s “upload your fitness data” patent</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span>SportBrain </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/02/ipr-process-saves-80-companies-paying-sports-motion-patent"><span>sued more than 80 companies</span></a><span> over a patent that claimed to cover basic gathering of user data and sending it over a network. A panel of PTAB judges canceled every claim.</span></p>
<p><strong>Under the new rules, this patent could have survived long enough to force dozens more companies to pay up.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Shipping &amp; Transit: a troll that <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/10/stupid-patent-month-how-34-patents-worth-1-led-hundreds-lawsuits">sued hundreds</a> of businesses</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span>For more than a decade, Shipping &amp; Transit sued companies over extremely broad “delivery notifications”patents. After repeated losses at PTAB and in court (including fee awards), the company finally collapsed.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Under the new rules, a troll like this could keep its patents alive and continue carpet-bombing small businesses with lawsuits.</strong></p>
<p><span>IPR hasn’t ended patent trolling. But when a troll waves a bogus patent at hundreds or thousands of people, IPR is one of the only tools that can actually fix the underlying problem: the patent itself. It dismantles abusive patent monopolies that never should have existed, &nbsp; saving entire industries from predatory litigation. That’s exactly why patent trolls and their allies have fought so hard to shut it down. They’ve failed to dismantle IPR in </span><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/17pdf/16-712_87ad.pdf"><span>court</span></a><span> or in </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/11/tell-congress-stop-these-last-minute-bills-help-patent-trolls"><span>Congress</span></a><span>—and now they’re counting on the USPTO’s own leadership to do it for them.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b>What the USPTO Plans To Do</b></h3>
<p><b>First</b><span>, they want you to give up your defenses in court. Under this proposal, a defendant can’t file an IPR unless they promise to never challenge the patent’s validity in court.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For someone actually being sued or threatened with patent infringement, that’s simply not a realistic promise to make. The choice would be: use IPR and lose your defenses—or keep your defenses and lose IPR.</span></p>
<p><b>Second</b><span>, the rules allow patents to become “unchallengeable” after one prior fight. That’s right. If a patent survives any earlier validity fight, anywhere, these rules would block everyone else from bringing an IPR, even years later and even if new prior art surfaces. One early decision—even one that’s poorly argued, or didn’t have all the evidence—would block the door on the entire public.</span></p>
<p><b>Third</b><span>, the rules will block IPR entirely if a district court case is projected to move faster than PTAB.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>So if a troll sues you with one of the outrageous patents we’ve seen over the years, like patents on </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/09/ultramercial-case-we-love-hate"><span>watching an ad</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/alice/startup-runs-patent-picture-menus"><span>showing picture menus</span></a><span>, or </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/02/stupid-patent-month-clocking-work-app"><span>clocking in to work</span></a><span>, the USPTO won’t even look at it. It’ll be back to the bad old days, where you have exactly one way to beat the troll (who chose the court to sue in)—spend millions on experts and lawyers, then take your chances in front of a federal jury.&nbsp;</span></p>
<div><p><span>The USPTO claims this is fine because defendants can still challenge patents in district court. That’s misleading. A real district-court validity fight costs millions of dollars and takes years. For most people and small companies, that’s no opportunity at all.&nbsp;</span></p></div>
<h3><b>Only Congress Can Rewrite IPR</b></h3>
<p><span>IPR was created by Congress in 2013 after extensive debate. It was meant to give the public a fast, affordable way to correct the Patent Office’s own mistakes. Only Congress—not agency rulemaking—can rewrite that system.</span></p>
<p><span>The USPTO shouldn’t be allowed to quietly undermine IPR with procedural traps that block legitimate challenges.</span></p>
<p><span>Bad patents still slip through every year. The Patent Office issues hundreds of thousands of new patents annually. IPR is one of the only tools the public has to push back.</span></p>
<p><span>These new rules rely on the absurd presumption that it’s the </span><i><span>defendants</span></i><span>—the people and companies threatened by questionable patents—who are abusing the system with multiple IPR petitions, and that they should be limited to one bite at the apple.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>That’s utterly upside-down. It’s patent trolls like Shipping &amp; Transit and Personal Audio that have sued, or threatened, entire communities of developers and small businesses.</span></p>
<p><span>When people have evidence that an overbroad patent was improperly granted, that evidence should be heard. That’s what Congress intended. These rules twist that intent beyond recognition.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In 2023, more than a thousand EFF supporters spoke out and stopped </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/06/our-right-challenge-junk-patents-under-threat"><span>an earlier version of this proposal</span></a><span>—your comments </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/07/victory-eff-supporters-beat-uspto-proposal-wreck-patent-reviews"><span>made the difference</span></a><span> then, and they can again.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Our principle is simple: the public has a right to challenge bad patents. These rules would take that right away. That’s why it’s vital to speak up now.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.regulations.gov/commenton/PTO-P-2025-0025-0001" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TAKE ACTION</a></p>
<p><span>Sample comment:&nbsp;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span>I oppose the USPTO’s proposed rule changes for inter partes review (IPR), Docket No. PTO-P-2025-0025. The IPR process must remain open and fair. Patent challenges should be decided on their merits, not shut out because of legal activity elsewhere. These rules would make it nearly impossible for the public to challenge bad patents, and that will harm innovation and everyday technology users.</span></p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.amoses.dev/blog/wifi-location/">https://www.amoses.dev/blog/wifi-location/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45985867">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-astro-cid-w6n32adp=""> <h2 id="attendance"><a href="#attendance">#</a>Attendance</h2>
<p>I’m in <a href="https://guide.wisc.edu/courses/comp_sci/#:~:text=COMP%C2%A0SCI%C2%A0577%20%E2%80%94%20INTRODUCTION%20TO%20ALGORITHMS">Introduction to Algorithms (577)</a> this semester at UW, and I’ve been enjoying hearing Renault explaining how to prove program correctness, DP, network flow, and the circumstances under which Dijkstra invented his shortest-path algorithm.</p>
<p>However… algos is a somewhat unique class for me, given that it’s the first course I’ve taken that mandates being present during lectures by taking attendance. It accomplishes this through a platform called <a href="https://tophat.com/">TopHat</a>, who many students will recognize through its use of displaying participation questions.</p>
<p>TopHat asks you to provide it a four-length numerical code (that’ll be provided to you by your lecturer) in order to verify that you’re actually in the location where the attendance is being taken. You type that code into the student TopHat page, and, bam, you’re marked present.</p>
<p>However, I suppose they caught on to the unpatchable strategy of Having Friends, who, given that they are in the same class section as you, can be sent messages begging for the code from the comfort of your bed.</p>
<p>So, for the paranoid lecturer, TopHat allows “<a href="https://support.tophat.com/article/Educator-Taking-Attendance#SecureAttendance">secure attendance</a>”, a feature which, according to them, determines your location as “…determined by [your] device geolocation or by both geolocation and proximity (to the classroom and other students).”</p>
<p><img src="https://www.amoses.dev/images/wifi-location/tophat.png" alt="TopHat's attendance code feature showing secure attendance enabled">
</p>
<p>The first time I heard about this system, I wondered how much leeway this “geolocation” would afford you. There exist a plethora of traditional “IP geolocation” services, which use your IP address and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_system_(Internet)">ASN</a> — both semi-unique identifiers sent to the webpage upon load — to try and identify your location. This provides… varied results depending on where you’re located. When in Madison and NYC, popular IP geolocation services have been able to pin me within a mile or so of my actual location. In any suburban area, the error jumps to city-level.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-1" id="user-content-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup> Surely TopHat wouldn’t be relying on such an inaccurate measure of detecting location when determining attendance — students living in Chadbourne Hall taking lectures in Mosse Humanities (approx. 250ft apart) would be able to skirt the attendance requirement. That could be catastrophic!</p>
<h2 id="the-geolocation-api"><a href="#the-geolocation-api">#</a>The Geolocation API</h2>
<p>Alas, it is not IP geolocation being used by TopHat. As aforementioned, IP geolocation is a pretty implicit flow — webpages are able to see your IP when you connect to them. However, when trying to determine your location, TopHat pops up a big scary dialogue past the <a href="https://textslashplain.com/2017/01/14/the-line-of-death/">line of death</a>!</p>
<p>Clearly this is asking something else entirely — something that’s presumably so precise as to require my explicit consent.</p>
<p>I’ll spare you the suspense. This is the Geolocation API, a feature of all modern browsers that allows the retrieval of your location to a <em>much</em> more precise degree (hence the permission pop-up). As of writing this post, IP geolocation is enough to place me somewhere in the Lakeshore neighborhood of Madison (1-2 miles long), but Chrome’s Geolocation API is enough to pin me to the exact building — Morgridge Hall — I’m sitting in. That’s orders of magnitude more accurate.</p>
<p>When I first experienced my laptop doing this, my first thought was “How?” There’s nothing special that my laptop has access to that would somehow allow my browser to have a more specific location… right? My laptop doesn’t have a GPS receiver in it<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-2" id="user-content-fnref-2" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup> that would allow location identification in the same way that phones can (and it isn’t just piggybacking off of my phone’s GPS, since this same location API is available on Windows devices).</p>
<h3 id="its-all-of-our-faults"><a href="#its-all-of-our-faults">#</a>It’s all of our faults</h3>
<p>When you press “allow” on the popup, your browser uses an accuracy heuristic to determine which method fetches the most accurate location. While this could be GPS (if on a cellular-enabled device) or the aforementioned IP geolocation, it will most likely have the highest success with the <strong>Wi-Fi Positioning System</strong>, a strategy that uses the wireless access points around you to identify your location.</p>
<p>Here’s how it works. After allowing your browser permission to access your location, a website has access to the <code>getCurrentPosition()</code> function. When calling it, your browser kindly asks your operating system for a list of the surrounding Wi-Fi access points — more specifically, their signal strength, SSIDs, and BSSIDs.</p>
<p>If those last two are foreign to you, the “SSID” of a network is just the friendly name — for example, <code>UWNet</code> or <code>eduroam</code>. The BSSID is the MAC address of the access point, which is unique per each device. Having a unique identifier <em>per access point</em> is immensely important, as you can imagine just how many APs are named the same thing. Take a look at the map of APs around campus named <code>UWNet</code>:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.amoses.dev/images/wifi-location/wigle-madison.png" alt="A map of Madison, Wisconsin, with a purple hotspot over the downtown area">
</p>
<p>Okay, so, great. We now know exactly which Wi-Fi network you’re connected to. But how does this translate to your location on a map? And how do we even know where these networks are in the real world?</p>
<h3 id="wardriving"><a href="#wardriving">#</a>Wardriving</h3>
<p>The notion of associating Wi-Fi networks with their physical locations has been prevalent since the early 2000s. As far as I can tell, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skyhook_Wireless">Skyhook Wireless</a> were the first to do it on a commercially-available scale, using a technique known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wardriving">wardriving</a>. This entails getting in a vehicle and driving around while capturing the information of as many Wi-Fi networks as possible. Since the devices doing the network scanning also have a reliable knowledge of their position (through GPS), all you have to do is associate the location of <em>where you saw the network</em> with its signal strength. Some RSSI trilateration later, and you have a roughly accurate map of Wi-Fi networks you’ve seen and their corresponding physical locations.</p>
<p>The useful thing is that, once in possession of all of this data, you can perform the process in reverse — on a user’s device, send a list of the Wi-Fi networks you can see (and their corresponding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Received_signal_strength_indicator">RSSI</a>), and receive an approximate guess on where that places your device in the world. For a while, that’s what everyone’s devices (including Apple ones, until iOS 3.2) did, relying on either Skyhook’s or Google’s privately collected list. The latter, interestingly enough, used their Street View vehicles (the ones taking images of roads) to capture the Wi-Fi information for a while.</p>
<p>However, at some point, companies realized the potential benefit of sourcing this information from the users of their devices. After all, they’re already frequently checking their GPS location and phoning home to cell towers, so why not send some anonymized Wi-Fi location data along with it?</p>
<p>So, that’s what Apple, Google, and Microsoft devices began doing. The location services of their products, by default, started aggregating the SSIDs and BSSIDs of Wi-Fi hotspots they could see (and their locations) and logging them for others’ devices to use for more accurate location services. And… that’s more or less the same thing that modern devices use today. When Chrome tells me that a website would like to use my location, and I allow it, the list of the surrounding hotspots will be sent to Google — which, because tens of thousands of people with GPS-enabled devices have also pinged the networks, allows my computer to obtain an extremely accurate estimation on where I am. So, thank you, everybody…?</p>
<h2 id="controversy"><a href="#controversy">#</a>Controversy</h2>
<p>If you were feeling a little nervous about the idea of your phone aggregating and sharing the location and information of every Wi-Fi network you’ve ever interacted with in your entire life, don’t worry, you’re not alone! There have been plenty of historical incidents with abuses of the technology.</p>
<p>Starting with a tough one: remember how earlier (in <a href="#wardriving">wardriving</a>) I mentioned that Google historically used their Street View cars to obtain network information for their location services? It turns out that they were sniffing much more than just the headers of the packets — they were aggregating the raw 802.11 Wi-Fi data frames, which includes the non-encrypted payload of HTTP packets. I assume that very little of the internet was using HTTPS in 2010, so the reported 600 gigabytes worth of data they obtained definitely contained some things that users would probably rather them not see.</p>
<p>A larger and more pertinent concern tends to crop up with regards to the possibility of tracing someone’s location — which is valid, given its sensitivity. This has been a worry since WPS’ inception, but one older example I found was Elie Bursztein et al.’s talk and <a href="https://elie.net/blog/privacy/using-the-microsoft-geolocalization-api-to-retrace-where-a-windows-laptop-has-been">accompanying blog post</a> “Using the microsoft geolocalization api to retrace where a windows laptop has been”. At the time, there was a bug where Windows would save a persistent record of every MAC address that you connected to, making it possible to retrace someone’s steps (thus, tracking their location as it changed) using one of numerous location APIs live at the time.</p>
<p>These vulnerabilities are even seen in contemporary times — Erik Rye and Dave Levin of the University of Maryland wrote “<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14975">Surveilling the Masses with Wi-Fi-Based Positioning Systems</a>” in 2024, detailing a flaw in Apple’s location services that allowed them to exfiltrate the positions of nearly two billion BSSIDs by cleverly filtering the MAC address space they were searching. Their paper’s great, and it touches on some real dangers possible from the information in the hands of an adversary, such as stalking individuals by continuously locating their router BSSID, or monitoring population density during wartime by observing the movement of groups of devices (and satellite internet constellations like Starlink).</p>
<p>Over time, the location service providers have improved the security of the APIs they develop. This is <em>supremely</em> important given the risks we’ve discussed, especially given that nearly every device created by these companies are, by default<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-3" id="user-content-fnref-3" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">3</a></sup>, sending this information to their manufacturers. Nearly every company that participates in WPS allows you to opt your BSSID out — either by changing the name of your SSID or by specifying the MAC address in a form somewhere:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.amoses.dev/images/wifi-location/apple-wps.png" alt="Apple support WPS opt out page">
</p>
<p><i>Apple’s instructional opt out page (appending <code>_nomap</code>) to the SSID.</i></p>
<p><img src="https://www.amoses.dev/images/wifi-location/google-wps.png" alt="Google support WPS opt out page">
</p>
<p><i>Google’s page, which offers the same advice.</i></p>
<p><img src="https://www.amoses.dev/images/wifi-location/microsoft-wps.png" alt="Microsoft support WPS opt out page">
</p>
<p><i>Microsoft’s form, requiring a BSSID submission to opt out.</i></p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion">#</a>Conclusion</h2>
<p>If I didn’t mention it yet, this technology does have a name. It’s called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_positioning_system">Wi-Fi positioning system</a> (WPS). There’s still a vibrant community of Wi-Fi positioning enthusiasts out there — <a href="https://wigle.net/">https://wigle.net/</a> is a crowd-sourced database from recreational wardrivers who have contributed nearly two billion networks over the last 25 years. You can zoom in on your town and see the Wi-Fi density near you, and you can even check if your own network has been tagged by someone else!</p>
<p>I’d also be remiss if I didn’t mention <a href="https://beacondb.net/">https://beacondb.net/</a>, a self described “public domain wireless geolocation database”, which, while I haven’t had time to play with, sounds like a very promising open version of the trackers so commonly used nowadays. While it doesn’t have as dense of a database as any of the other providers, I actually think it’s neat to have a lack of homogeneity among the smaller providers — it shows the data is truly different!</p>
<p>It’s been really fun diving down this rabbit hole to learn how our devices gain access to our location. It’s one of the more niche things that I’ve taken for granted when using my devices, and it certainly didn’t occur to me that, while in lecture, the only reason I could be marked present was because thousands of other students had (without their knowledge) pinged servers all over the world.</p>

<p>This conclusion — “error rates scale based on living settlement density” is my personal conjecture. It is surprisingly frustrating just exactly how little information there is online about how these services attempt to pin your location from <em>just</em> your IP address. Wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_geolocation">has an article</a> about IP geolocation, but it’s vague when discussing the actual implementation details… <a href="#user-content-fnref-1" data-footnote-backref="" aria-label="Back to reference 1">↩</a></p>

<li id="user-content-fn-2">
<p>Small digression: did you know that, until May 2000, GPS satellites (which are owned and operated by the United States Space Force) provided the general public a signal with intentional error built into it? This was called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_analysis_for_the_Global_Positioning_System#Selective_Availability">Selective Availability</a>, and it augmented the position of GPS readings by about 50 meters (162 feet) horizontally. It was shut off for a number of reasons — one of which being that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_GPS">Differential GPS</a> allows you to circumvent the distortion trivially by comparing the error of the signal against the location of a reference station with a known position. <a href="#user-content-fnref-2" data-footnote-backref="" aria-label="Back to reference 2">↩</a></p>

<p>It’s associated with “Location Services” on most devices, meaning that you cannot opt out of your phone reporting the locations of surrounding Wi-Fi devices without turning off your phone’s ability to obtain its location entirely. <a href="#user-content-fnref-3" data-footnote-backref="" aria-label="Back to reference 3">↩</a></p>

I’ve used Macs for a decade for work, and I dabbled in Ubuntu 20-something years ago, but otherwise I’ve been a Windows guy since 3.1. At first, that’s because it’s what we had at home, later because that’s where the games were, and finally out of force of habit (and because that’s where the games were). I brought a desktop to college instead of a laptop (so I could play games), and I’ve been building my own PCs for 18 years.

  <p>[TOC]</p>

<h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>The survival of our species owes much to our brain, specifically, its ability to observe, analyse, and plan. Planting crops and storing grains for the winter were some of the earliest uses of these abilities. Measuring and calculating are foundational elements of observation, analysis, and planning. Computation, upon which our modern society depends, is but an extension of those ancient measurement and calculation techniques.</p>

<p>Calculations operate on operands obtained through measurements. Counting was the oldest form of measurement. In prehistory, humans counted by scratching marks on bones. Next to evolve was a ruler etched with markings. Thereafter, humans were marking, measuring, calculating, tracking, and predicting the movements of the Sun and the Moon using stone pillars, astronomically aligned burial mounds, and sun dials.</p>

<p>By around 3000 BC, Sumerians invented the sexagesimal (base-$60$) number system, and they were using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abacus">abacus</a> by 2700 BC. The abacus was one of the earliest devices that mechanised calculations, and it is still in extensive use, throughout the world. A <a href="https://youtu.be/5ddF5e-2SfM">cuneiform clay tablet</a> from 1800 BC shows that Babylonians already knew how to survey land boundaries with the aid of Pythagorean triples. Egyptians improved upon these techniques to survey property boundaries on the Nile flood planes and to erect the pyramids. By 220 BC, Persian astronomers were using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrolabe">astrolabe</a> to calculate the latitude, to measure the height of objects, and to triangulate positions. Greeks constructed truly advanced mechanical instruments that predicted solar and lunar eclipses. The sophistication and refinement exhibited by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antikythera_mechanism">Antikythera mechanism</a> from around 200 BC continues to amaze modern engineers.</p>

<p>Ancient astronomy measured, tracked, and predicted the movements of heavenly objects. But when celestial navigation came to be used extensively in global trade across the oceans, we began charting the night sky in earnest, and thus was born modern astronomy. Astronomical calculations involved manually manipulating numbers. Those calculations were tedious and error prone.</p>

<p>In 1614, a brilliant Scottish mathematician <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Napier">John Napier</a> discovered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithm">logarithms</a>. Perhaps it would be more appropriate to say Napier invented logarithms, for his discovery was motivated by his desire to simplify multiplication and division. Arithmetically, multiplication can be expressed as repeated additions, and division as repeated subtractions. Logarithmically, multiplication of two numbers can be reduced to addition of their logarithms, and division to subtraction thereof. Hence, multiplication and division of very large numbers can be reduced to straightforward addition and subtraction, with the aid of prepared logarithm and inverse logarithm tables.</p>

<p>In 1620, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Gunter">Edmund Gunter</a>, an English astronomer, used Napier’s logarithms to fashion a calculating device that came to be known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Gunter#Gunter's_scale">Gunter’s scale</a>. The markings on this device were not linear like a simple ruler, but logarithmic. To multiply two numbers, the length representing the multiplicand is first marked out on the logarithmic scale using a divider and, from thence, the length representing the multiplier is similarly marked out, thereby obtaining the product, which is the sum of the two logarithmic lengths. Gunter’s scale mechanised the tedious task of looking up numbers on logarithm tables. This device was the forerunner of the slide rule.</p>

<p>The first practical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slide_rule">slide rule</a> was invented by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Oughtred">William Oughtred</a>, an English mathematician, in 1622. Oughtred used two bits of wood graduated with Gunter’s scale to perform multiplication and addition. Then, in 1630, Oughtred fashioned a brass circular slide rule with two integrated pointers. This device was a significant improvement over Gunter’s scale, in terms of practicality and usability. The photograph below shows a brass circular slide rule that is a contemporaneous clone of Oughtred’s.</p>

<p><img src="https://amenzwa.github.io/stem/figures/SlideRules/DavenportCircularSlideRule.jpg" alt="Davenport Circular Slide Rule"></p>

<p>The earliest adopters of the slide rule were the 17th century astronomers, who used it to perform arithmetic and trigonometric operations, quickly. But it was the 19th century engineers, the spearheads of the Industrial Revolution, who propelled the slide rule technology forward. For nearly four centuries after its invention, the slide rule remained the preeminent calculating device. Buildings, bridges, machines, and even computer system components, were designed by slide rule. Apollo astronauts carried the <a href="https://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/search/object/nmah_694174">Pickett N600-ES</a> pocket slide rule, onboard, for navigation and propulsion calculations. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Dynamics_F-16_Fighting_Falcon">General Dynamics F-16</a>, a modern, air-superiority fighter, was designed by slide rule. Well into the late 1970s, school children all over the world, including me, were taught to use the slide rule and the logarithm book, along with penmanship and grammar.</p>

<p>The largest and most enthusiastic group of slide rule users, naturally, were engineers. But slide rules were used in all areas of human endeavour that required calculation: business, construction, manufacturing, medicine, photography, and more. Obviously, bankers and accountants relied on the slide rule to perform sundry arithmetic gymnastics. Construction sites and factory floors, too, used specialised versions of slide rules for mixing concrete, computing volumes, etc. Surveyors used the <a href="http://www.rechenschieber.org/stadia.pdf">stadia slide rule</a> made specifically for them. Doctors use special, <a href="https://www.rechenschieber-werbemittel.de/en/slide-charts/medical">medical slide rules</a> for calculating all manner of things: body mass index, pregnancy terms, medicine dosage, and the like. Photographers used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actinograph">photometric slide rules</a> for calculating film development times. Army officers used <a href="https://www.springfieldarsenal.net/155MM-Howitzer-slide-rule-range-tables-for-M483-M16.htm">artillery slide rules</a> to compute firing solutions in the field. Pilots used <a href="https://www.sliderulemuseum.com/Aerospace.htm">aviation slide rules</a> for navigation and fuel-burn calculations. The list was long. This humble device elevated the 18th century astronomy, powered the 19th century Industrial Revolution, and seeded the 20th century Technological Revolution. Indeed, the slide rule perfectly expressed the engineering design philosophy: capability through simplicity.</p>

<p>But then, in 1972, HP released its first programmable scientific calculator, the inimitable <a href="https://hpmuseum.org/hp35.htm">HP-35</a>. The HP-35 rang loud the death knell of the slide rule. Although electronic pocket calculators were unaffordable in the early 1970s, they became ubiquitous within a decade thanks to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law">Moore’s law</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennard_scaling">Dennard’s law</a>, and quickly displaced the slide rule. By the early 1980s, only a few people in the world were using the slide rule. I was one.</p>

<h2 id="personal"><em>personal</em></h2>

<p>It was around this time that I arrived at the university—in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myanmar">Burma</a>. In those days, electronic pocket calculators were beyond the reach of most Burmese college students. To ensure fairness, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangon_Technological_University">my engineering college</a> insisted that all students used the government-issued slide rule, which was readily accessible to everyone. Many classrooms in my college had large, wall-mounted <a href="https://sliderulemuseum.com/DemoSR.htm">demonstration slide rules</a> to teach first-year students how properly to use the slide rule like an engineer—that is, to eradicate the bad habits learned in high school. As engineering students, we carried the slide rule upon our person, daily.</p>

<p>I subsequently emigrated to the US. Arrival in the US ended my association with the slide rule because, by the 1980s, American engineers were already using <a href="https://www.hpmuseum.org/">HP RPN pocket calculators</a> and <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html">MATLAB</a> technical computing software on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Personal_Computer">IBM PC</a>. I soon became an <a href="https://amenzwa.github.io/stem/ComputingHistory/HowRPNCalculatorsWork/">HP calculator devotee</a>. As such, I never got to use the slide rule extensively in a professional setting. But I hung on to my student slide rules: the government-issued Aristo 0968 Studio, a straight rule, and the handed-down Faber-Castell 8/10, a circular rule. To this day, I remain partial to the intimate, tactile nature of the slide rule, especially the demands it places upon the user’s mind. Over the next four decades, I collected many slide rules, dribs and drabs. The models in my collection are the ones I admired as an engineering student in Burma, but were, then, beyond reach.</p>

<p>In its heyday, everyone used the slide rule in every facet of life. As children, we saw it being used everywhere, so we were acquainted with it, even if we did not know how to use it. We were taught to use the slide rule’s basic facilities in middle school. Our options were the abacus, the log books, or the slide rule. The choice was abundantly clear: we enthusiastically took up the slide rule—a rite of passage, as it were. Now, though, even the <a href="https://youtu.be/CblhxhnSymg">brightest engineering students</a> in the world have never heard of a slide rule, let alone know how it works.</p>

<h2 id="goal"><em>goal</em></h2>

<p>My main goal in writing this article is to preserve the knowledge about, and the memory of, this ingenious computing device: how it works and how it was used. The focus here is on the basic principles of operation and how the slide rule was used in engineering. This is a “how it works” explanation, and not a “how to use” manual. Those who are interested in the most efficient use of a slide rule may read the manuals listed in the resources section at the end of this article. Beyond history and reminiscence, I hope to highlight the wide-ranging utility of some of the most basic mathematical functions that are familiar to middle schoolers.</p>

<h2 id="recommendations"><em>recommendations</em></h2>

<p>It is mighty difficult to discuss the slide rule without having the device in hand. For the presentations below, I chose the Keuffel &amp; Esser (K&amp;E) 4081-3 Log Log Duplex Decitrig, a well-made wood rule. It was one of the most popular engineering slide rules for decades, especially in the US. As such, many engineering professors published good introductory books for it, and these books are now available online in PDF format.</p>

<p><img src="https://amenzwa.github.io/stem/figures/SlideRules/K&amp;E4081-3/DSC00176.JPG" alt="K&amp;E 4081-3"></p>

<p>The term “log-log” refers to the $LL$ scale, which is used to compute exponentiation, as will be explained, later. The term “duplex” refers to the fact that both sides of the frame are engraved with scales, a K&amp;E invention. The label “Decitrig” was K&amp;E’s trade name for its slide rules that used decimal degrees for trigonometric computations, instead of minutes and seconds. Engineers prefer using the more convenient decimal notation.</p>

<p>Another common model was the Post 1460 Versalog. Although less popular than the K&amp;E 4081-3, the Post 1460 is cheaper and, in my opinion, is a better slide rule. It is made of bamboo, a more stable material than wood.</p>

<p><img src="https://amenzwa.github.io/stem/figures/SlideRules/Post1460/DSC00182.JPG" alt="Post 1460"></p>

<p>Go on eBay and buy a good, inexpensive slide rule, either the <a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&amp;_trksid=p2334524.m570.l1313&amp;_nkw=k%26e+4081-3+slide+rule&amp;_sacat=0&amp;LH_TitleDesc=0&amp;_odkw=k%26e+4081-3+log+log+duplex+decitrig&amp;_osacat=0">K&amp;E 4081-3</a> or the <a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&amp;_trksid=p2380057.m570.l1313&amp;_nkw=post+1460+versalog+slide+rule&amp;_sacat=0">Post 1460</a>; you will need a slide rule to follow the discussions below. Alternatively, you could use a <a href="https://www.sliderules.org/react/hemmi_versalog_ii.html">slide rule simulator</a>. The feature of this simulator that is especially useful to novices is the cursor’s ability instantaneously to show the exact scale values under the hairline.</p>

<p>And I recommend that, after you have read this article, you study one or more of the books listed in the resources section at the end.</p>

<h2 id="principles">PRINCIPLES</h2>

<p>A slide rule comprises three components: the body, the slide, and the cursor, as shown below. The <em>body</em>, about 25 cm in length, consists of two pieces of wood, the upper and the lower frames, bound together with metal brackets at the ends. The <em>slide</em> is a thin strip of wood that glides left and right between the upper and the lower frames. The <em>cursor</em> consists of two small plates of glass held by metal brackets and these brackets are anchored to the upper and the lower lintels. The cursor straddles the body and glides across its length. Hence, the three components of a slide rule move independently of, and with respect to, one another.</p>

<p>A duplex slide rule, like the K&amp;E 4081-3 shown below, both sides of the frame have scales, and so do both sides of the slide. These scales are set and read using the hairline inscribed on the cursor glass. The cursor cannot slip off the body, because it is blocked by the metal brackets at the ends of the body.</p>

<p><img src="https://amenzwa.github.io/stem/figures/SlideRules/K&amp;E4081-3/DSC00202.JPG" alt="K&amp;E 4081-3"></p>

<p>A simplex slide rule, like the Nestler 23 R shown below, the cursor can slip off the body. The body is a single piece of wood with a trough in the middle separating the upper and the lower frames. Only the frontside of the frame has scales, but the slide has scales on both sides.</p>

<p><img src="https://amenzwa.github.io/stem/figures/SlideRules/Nestler23R/DSC00155.JPG" alt="Nestler 23 R"></p>

<p>The slide rule is always operated using both hands, fingers of one hand pushing and those of the other gently opposing. The lower lintel of the cursor glides along the bottom of the lower frame. There is a tension spring between the upper lintel of the cursor and the top of the upper frame. This tension spring braces the lower lintel of the cursor flush against the bottom of the lower frame. To make fine adjustments of the cursor, one uses the thumbs of both hands against the lower lintel of the cursor. It is important to avoid touching the upper lintel, since it does not sit flush against the frame, due to the tension spring. When using the backside of a duplex straight rule, the lower lintel of the cursor has now flipped to the topside, so it had to be fine adjusted using the forefingers. Fine adjustments of the slide are made with the thumb or the forefinger of one hand opposing its counterpart of the other hand. To use the backside scales on a duplex straight rule, the device is flipped bottom-to-top.</p>

<p>Simplex slide rules have use instructions and a few scientific constants on the back, but duplex slide rules come with plastic inserts that bear such information. But no engineer I knew actually used this on-device information. Procedures for operating an engineering slide rule are complex; we had to study the user’s manual thoroughly and receive hands-on instructions for several weeks before we became proficient enough to be left alone with a slide rule without causing mayhem in the laboratory. And every branch of engineering has its own set of published handbooks in which many formulae and constants can readily be found.</p>

<h2 id="arithmetic-operations"><em>arithmetic operations</em></h2>

<p><strong><em>properties of logarithms</em></strong>—The base-$10$ common logarithm function $log(x)$ and its inverse, the power-of-10 function $10^x$, give life to the slide rule. The two main properties of logarithms upon which the slide rule relies are these:</p>

<p>
$$
\begin{align}
a × b &amp;= log^{-1}[log(a) + log(b)] \nonumber \\
a ÷ b &amp;= log^{-1}[log(a) - log(b)] \nonumber
\end{align}
$$
</p>

<p>That is, to compute $a × b$, we first compute the sum of $log(a)$ and $log(b)$, then compute the $log^{-1}$ of the sum. Likewise, $a ÷ b$ is computed as the $log^{-1}$ of the difference between $log(a)$ and $log(b)$.</p>

<p><strong><em>logarithmic scale</em></strong>—The slide rule mechanises these calculations by using two identical logarithmic scales, commonly labelled $C$ (on the slide) and $D$ (on the frame). Gunter’s logarithmic scale is derived from a ruler-like linear scale in the following manner. We begin with a 25-cm-long blank strip of wood and mark it up with $10$ equally spaced segments labelled $0, 1, 2, 3, …, 10$, similar to an ordinary ruler, but labelling the ending $10$ as $1$, instead. This first piece of wood has now become the source linear scale. We then line up the second 25-cm long blank strip of wood with the first one, and mark up that second piece of wood with $9$ unequally spaced segments labelled $1, 2, 3, …, 1$, starting with $1$ and, again, ending with $1$. The division marks of the second piece of wood is placed non-linearly in accordance with their $log$ values and by reference to the linear scale:</p>

<ul>
  <li>$log(1) = 0.0$, so $1$ on the non-linear scale is lined up with $0.0$ on the linear scale</li>
  <li>$log(2) = 0.301$, so $2$ on the non-linear scale is lined up with $0.301$ on the linear scale</li>
  <li>$log(3) = 0.477$, so $3$ on the non-linear scale is lined up with $0.477$ on the linear scale</li>
  <li>$…$</li>
  <li>$log(10) = 1.0$, so $10$ (which is labelled $1$) on the non-linear scale is lined up with $1.0$ on the linear scale</li>
</ul>

<p>The second scale thus obtained is the non-linear, logarithmic scale. In the figure below, the upper one is the source linear scale and the lower one is the derived logarithmic scale.</p>

<p><img src="https://amenzwa.github.io/stem/figures/SlideRules/scale-L-D.jpg" alt="L &amp; D scales"></p>

<p>On the slide rule, the source linear scale is labelled $L$, and it is called the “logarithm scale”. The derived logarithmic scale is labelled $D$.</p>

<p>I would like to direct your attention to this potentially confusing terminology. The term “logarithm scale” refers to the linear $L$ scale used for computing the common logarithm function $log(x)$. And the term “logarithmic scale” refers to the non-linear $C$ and $D$ scales used for computing the arithmetic operations $×$ and $÷$. This knotty terminology is unavoidable, given the logarithmic nature of the slide rule.</p>

<p>The logarithmic scale and the logarithm scale are related by a bijective function $log$:</p>

<p>
$$
\begin{align}
log &amp;: D \rightarrow L \nonumber \\
log^{-1} &amp;: L \rightarrow D \nonumber
\end{align}
$$
</p>

<p>In the plot below, the black curve is $log$ and the red is $log^{-1}$.</p>

<p><img src="https://amenzwa.github.io/stem/figures/SlideRules/plot-log.jpg" alt="log"></p>

<p>The special name for $log^{-1}$ is power-of-$10$ function $10^x$. The $D$ and the $L$ scales form a transform pair that converts between the  logarithmic scale and the arithmetic scale. It turns out that the $log$ function transforms the arithmetic scale’s $×$ and $÷$ operators into the logarithmic scale’s $+$ and $-$ operators, and the $log^{-1}$ function performs the inverse transformation.</p>

<p>Plotting the $log$ function on a logarithmic scale produces a sequence of evenly spaced values. Hence, the $L$ scale appears linear, when laid out on the slide rule. Note also that the mere act of reading $x$ on the logarithmic scale implicitly computes $log(x)$; there is no need explicitly to compute $log^{-1}(x)$. Gunter’s logarithmic scale was the groundbreaking idea that made the slide rule work so effectively, efficiently, effortlessly.</p>

<p>The logarithmic scale has many other uses in STEM beyond the slide rule: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richter_magnitude_scale">Richter scale</a> used to measure seismic events; the $dB$ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decibel">decibel scale</a> used to measure sound pressure levels; the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrogram">spectrogram</a> used to visualise frequency domain signals are just a few examples. These uses exploit the logarithms’ ability to compress a very large range, while preserving relevant details.</p>

<p><strong><em>computations using logarithmic scales</em></strong>—To compute $2 × 3$, we manipulate the slide rule as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>$D$—Place the hairline on the <em>multiplicand</em> $2$ on the $D$ scale.</li>
  <li>$C$—Slide the left-hand $1$ on the $C$ scale under the hairline.</li>
  <li>$C$—Place the hairline on the <em>multiplier</em> $3$ on the $C$ scale.</li>
  <li>$D$—Read under the hairline the <em>product</em> $6$ on the $D$ scale. This computes $2 × 3 = 6$.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://amenzwa.github.io/stem/figures/SlideRules/K&amp;E4081-3/2%C3%973.jpg" alt="2×3"></p>

<p>The above multiplication procedure computes $2 × 3 = 6$, like this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>In step (1), we placed the hairline on $D$ scale’s $2$. In this way, we mechanically marked out the length $[1, 2]$ along the logarithmic $D$ scale. Mathematically, this is equivalent to computing $log(2)$.</li>
  <li>In step (2), we lined up $C$ scale’s left-hand $1$, the beginning of the scale, with $D$ scale’s $2$, in preparation for the next step.</li>
  <li>In step (3), we placed the hairline on $C$ scale’s $3$. This mechanically marked out the length sum $[1, 2]_D + [1, 3]_C = [1, 6]_D$ on the logarithmic $D$ scale, which is mathematically equivalent to computing $log(2) + log(3) = log(6)$.</li>
  <li>Then, in step (4), we read the result $6$ on the $D$ scale under the hairline. This is mathematically equivalent to computing $log^{-1}[log(2) + log(3)] = 2 × 3 = 6$. Recall that $log^{-1}$ operation is implicit in the mere reading of the $D$ logarithmic scale.</li>
</ul>

<p>To put it another way, adding $2$ units of length and $3$ units of length yields $2 + 3 = 5$ units of length on the arithmetic scale of an ordinary rule. But on the logarithmic scale of the slide rule, adding $2$ units of length and $3$ units of length yields $2 × 3 = 6$ units of length.</p>

<p>To compute $2 ÷ 3$, we manipulate the slide rule as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>$D$—Place the hairline on the <em>dividend</em> $2$ on the $D$ scale. This computes $log(2)$.</li>
  <li>$C$—Slide under the hairline the <em>divisor</em> $3$ on the $C$ scale.</li>
  <li>$C$—Place the hairline on the right-hand $1$ on the $C$ scale. This computes $log(2) - log(3) = log(0.667)$.</li>
  <li>$D$—Read under the hairline the <em>quotient</em> $667$ on the $D$ scale, which is interpreted to be $0.667$, as will be explained in the next subsection. This computes $2 ÷ 3 = log^{-1}[log(2) - log(3)] = 0.667$.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://amenzwa.github.io/stem/figures/SlideRules/K&amp;E4081-3/2%C3%B73.jpg" alt="2÷3"></p>

<p>Multiplication and division operations start and end with the cursor hairline on the $D$ scale. Skilled users frequently skipped the initial cursor setting when multiplying and the final cursor setting when dividing, opting instead to use the either end of the $C$ scale as the substitute hairline.</p>

<h2 id="accuracy-and-precision"><em>accuracy and precision</em></h2>

<p>In slide rule parlance, <em>accuracy</em> refers to how consistently the device operates—that is, how well it was manufactured and how finely it was calibrated. And <em>precision</em> means how many significant figures the user can reliably read off the scale.</p>

<p>Professional-grade slide rules are made exceedingly well, so they are very accurate. Yet, they all allow the user to calibrate the device. Even a well-made slide rule, like the K&amp;E 4081-3 can go out of alignment if mistreated, say by exposing it to sun, solvent, or shock (mechanical or thermal). Misaligned slide rule can be recalibrated using the procedure described in the maintenance section, later in this article. And prolonged exposure to moisture and heat can deform a wood rule, like the K&amp;E 4081-3, thereby damaging it, permanently. The accuracy of a warped wood rule can no longer be restored by recalibrating. So, be kind to your slide rule.</p>

<p>To analyse the precision of the slide rule, we must examine the resolution of the logarithmic scale, first. The $C$ and $D$ scales are logarithmic, so they are nonlinear. The scales start on the left at $log(1) = 0$, which is marked as $1$, and end on the right at $log(10) = 1$, which is also marked as $1$. Indeed, these scales wrap around by multiples of $10$ and, hence, the $1$ mark at both ends.</p>

<p>As can be seen in the figure below, the distance between two adjacent major divisions on the scale shrinks logarithmically from left to right:</p>

<ul>
  <li>$log(2) - log(1) = 0.301 \approx 30\%$</li>
  <li>$log(3) - log(2) = 0.176 \approx 18\%$</li>
  <li>$log(4) - log(3) = 0.125 \approx 12\%$</li>
  <li>$log(5) - log(4) = 0.097 \approx 10\%$</li>
  <li>$log(6) - log(5) = 0.079 \approx 8\%$</li>
  <li>$log(7) - log(6) = 0.067 \approx 7\%$</li>
  <li>$log(8) - log(7) = 0.058 \approx 6\%$</li>
  <li>$log(9) - log(8) = 0.051 \approx 5\%$</li>
  <li>$log(10) - log(9) = 0.046 \approx 4\%$</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://amenzwa.github.io/stem/figures/SlideRules/scale-D.jpg" alt="D scale"></p>

<p>The figure above also shows the three distinct regions on the $D$ scale that have different resolutions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>In the range $[1, 2]$, the scale is graduated into $10$ major divisions, and each major division is further graduated into $10$ minor divisions.</li>
  <li>In the range $[2, 4]$, the scale is graduated into $10$ major divisions, and each major division is further graduated into $5$ minor divisions.</li>
  <li>In the range $[4, 1]$, the scale is graduated into $10$ major divisions, and each major division is further graduated into $2$ minor divisions.</li>
</ul>

<p>At the left end of the $D$ scale, $1.11$, $1.12$, etc., can be read directly from the scale. With practice, one could visually subdivide each minor division into $10$ sub-subdivisions and discern $1.111$ from $1.112$, reliably, precisely. In the photograph below, the cursor hairline is placed on $1.115$.</p>

<p><img src="https://amenzwa.github.io/stem/figures/SlideRules/K&amp;E4081-3/1.115.jpg" alt="1.115 on D scale"></p>

<p>In the middle of the $D$ scale, $3.12$, $3.14$, etc., can be read directly from the scale. Indeed, $3.14$ is marked as $\pi$ on $C$ and $D$ scales of all slide rules. With a nominal eyesight, each minor division could be subdivided visually and easily read $3.13$, which is halfway between the $3.12$ and the $3.14$ graduations. The photograph below shows the hairline on $3.13$.</p>

<p><img src="https://amenzwa.github.io/stem/figures/SlideRules/K&amp;E4081-3/3.13.jpg" alt="3.13 on D scale"></p>

<p>On the right end of $D$ scale, $9.8$, $8.85$, $9.9$, $9.95$, etc., can be read directly from the scale. With due care, each minor division could be subdivided into two sub-subdivisions and read without undue strain $9.975$, which is halfway between the $9.95$ and the $1$ graduations. See the photograph below. But for those of us with poor eyesights, it is rather difficult to discern $9.98$ from $9.99$.</p>

<p><img src="https://amenzwa.github.io/stem/figures/SlideRules/K&amp;E4081-3/9.975.jpg" alt="9.975 on D scale"></p>

<p>Under optimal conditions—calibrated slide rule, nominal eyesight, good lighting, and alert mind—the slide rule can attain four significant figures of precision on the lower end of the $D$ scale and three significant figures on the higher end of the scale.</p>

<p>It is important to note that the logarithmic scale cycles, repeatedly. Hence, the scale reading of $314$ can be valued as $…$, $0.0314$, $0.314$, $3.14$, $31.4$, $314.0$, $3140.0$, $…$ and so forth, depending on the context. The decimal point must be located using mental arithmetic. For example, $\pi/8 \approx 3/8 \approx 0.4$, so the result must necessarily be $0.3927$, not $0.03927$, $3.927,$ nor anything else. So, mental arithmetic locates the decimal point thereby getting us within the zone of accuracy, and scale reading yields the constituent digits thus getting us the precision we desire.</p>

<p>Ordinarily, the slide rule was used to evaluate complicated expressions involving many chained calculations when they needed to be performed quickly, but when precision was not a paramount concern. When precision is important, however, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_table">logarithm tables</a> were used. These tables were laboriously hand-computed to several significant figures. If the desired value fell between two entries in the table, the user is obliged to interpolate the result, manually. While actuaries may have demanded the high precision afforded by the logarithm table, engineers willingly accepted three or four significant figures offered by the slide rule, because the slide rule was accurate enough for engineering use and it was the fastest means then available to perform calculations. In due course, the slide rule became inextricably linked to engineers, like the stethoscope to doctors.</p>

<p>It might be shocking to a modern reader to learn that slide rule wielding engineers accepted low-precision results, considering how precise today’s engineering is, owing to the use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_design">computer-aided design</a> (CAD) and other automation tools. But these high-tech tools came into common use in engineering, only in the 1990s. Before that, we had to perform analysis by hand using calculators, and prior to that with slide rules. In fact, engineering analysis was a tedious affair. For instance, to design a simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truss_bridge">truss bridge</a>—the kind prevalent in the 19th century—the structural engineer must compute the tension and compression forces present in each beam, taking into account the dimensions of the beams, the strengths of various materials, expected dynamic loads, projected maximum winds, and many other factors. The analysis of force vectors involves many arithmetic and trigonometric calculations, even for the simplest of structures. The sheer number calculations made it uneconomical to insist upon the higher precisions offered by the logarithm tables. As such, engineers settled for lower precision, and in compensation incorporated ample safety margins. This was one of the reasons why older structures are heftier, stronger, and longer-lasting, compared to their modern counterparts.</p>

<p><img src="https://amenzwa.github.io/stem/figures/SlideRules/TrussBridge.jpg" alt="Truss Bridge"></p>

<h2 id="varieties">VARIETIES</h2>

<p>Slide rules came in straight, circular, and cylindrical varieties. Cylindrical rules consist of two concentric cylinders that slide and rotate relative to each other. The key innovation of cylindrical rules was the helical scale that wraps round the cylinder. This coiled scale stretches to an impressive length, despite the relatively small size of the cylinder. Of course, a longer scale yields a greater precision. The cylinder can be rotated to bring the back-facing numbers round to the front.</p>

<p>Circular rules were the first practical slide rules. Their main advantages are compactness and stoutness. A typical model is constructed like a pocket watch and operated like one too, using crowns. The glass-faced, sealed construction protects the device against dust. Some circular models sport a spiral scale, thereby extracting good precision from a compact real estate. But the circular scales oblige the user to rotate the device frequently for proper reading. Expert users of circular rules were good at reading the scales upside-down. On some very small models, the graduation marks get very tight near the centre. In other words, circular rules can be rather fiddly.</p>

<p>Of all the varieties, straight rules are the easiest and the most convenient to use, because they are relatively small and light, and because the whole scale is visible at once. However, their scale lengths are bounded by the length of the body. So, straight rules are less precise by comparison.</p>

<p>Most engineers preferred straight rules, because these devices allowed the user to see the whole scales, and they were fast, accurate, and portable enough for routine use. Hence, this article focuses on straight rules. But a few engineers did use circular models, either because these devices were more precise or because they were more compact. In general, engineers did not use cylindrical ones; these devices were too unwieldy and they had only basic arithmetic scales. But accountants, financiers, actuaries, and others who required greater precision swore by cylindrical rules.</p>

<h2 id="straight-rules"><em>straight rules</em></h2>

<p>The commonest kind of slide rule was the 25 cm desk model, called the straight rule. The cursor is made of clear plastic or glass, etched with a hairline. The frame and the slide are made of wood, bamboo, aluminium, or plastic. The name “slide rule” derives from the slippy-slidy bits and the ruler-like scales. Straight rules come in four types: Mannheim, Rietz, Darmstadt, and log-log duplex.</p>

<p>The less expensive Mannheim and Rietz models were used in high school, and the more sophisticated Darmstadt and log-log duplex models were used in college. There were longer straight rules used by those who required more precision. And there were shorter, pocket-sized straight rules, like the Pickett N600-ES carried by the Apollo astronauts. Although not very precise, pocket slide rules were good enough for quick, back-of-the-napkin calculations in the field. Engineers, however, were partial to the 25 cm desk straight rule. As such, the majority of the slide rules manufactured over the past two centuries were of this design.</p>

<p><strong><em>Mannheim type</em></strong>—The most basic straight rule is the Mannheim type, the progenitor of the modern slide rule. Surely, applying the adjective “modern” to a device that had been deemed outmoded for over 40 years is doing gentle violence to the English language. But given that the slide rule is now over 400 years old, a 150-year-old Mannheim model is comparatively “modern”.</p>

<p>A Mannheim slide rule has $C$ and $D$ scales for arithmetic operations ($×$ and $÷$), $L$ scale for common logarithm ($log$), $A$ and $B$ scales for square and square root ($x^2$ and $\sqrt{x}$), $K$ scale for cubic and cube root ($x^3$ and $\sqrt[3]{x}$), and $S$ and $T$ scales for trigonometric functions ($sin$ and $tan$).</p>

<p>The following is the Post 1447 simplex slide rule, manufactured by the Japanese company Hemmi in the late 1950s. As is the tradition for Japanese slide rules, this one is made of bamboo, which is a better material than wood, because bamboo is more resistant to warping and it slides more smoothly. The term “simplex” refers to the slide rules with scales on only one side of the frame.</p>

<p><img src="https://amenzwa.github.io/stem/figures/SlideRules/Post1447/DSC00149.JPG" alt="Post 1447"></p>

<p>Unlike its simplex frame, the slide of the Mannheim rule has engraved on its backside the $S$, $L$, and $T$ scales, which are read through the cutouts at each end. Given that the Post 1447 is a modern Mannheim rule, it has clear-plastic windows over the cutouts, and engraved on these windows are fixed red hairlines for reading the scales. These hairlines are alined with the $1$ mark on the frontside $D$ scale.</p>

<p>Classic Mannheim simplex slide rules do not have windows over the cutouts. Instead, their cutouts are cleverly placed in an offset: the right-hand cutout is aligned with the two upper scales on the backside of the slide (the $S$ and the $L$ scales) and the left-hand cutout is aligned with the two lower scales (the $L$ and the $T$ scales). It does get unwieldy when trying to read the left-edge of the $S$ scale, but this design compromise significantly reduces the need to flip the slide round to the front. If the predominant calculations are trigonometric, however, it is more convenient to just flip the slide and to use the front of the slide rule.</p>

<p>The original Mannheim slide rule was invented in 1859 by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Am%C3%A9d%C3%A9e_Mannheim">Amédée Mannheim</a>, a French artillery officer, for quickly computing firing solutions in the field. It had only $C$, $D$, $A$, and $B$ scales, so it was capable of computing only $×$, $÷$, $x^2$, and $\sqrt{x}$. This suited its intended purpose. It was the forefather of the modern straight rule.</p>

<p><strong><em>Rietz type</em></strong>—A slight improvement upon the French Mannheim type was the German Rietz type, designed in 1902 for Dennert &amp; Pape (D&amp;P, subsequently Aristo) by Max Rietz, an engineer. It added the $ST$ scale for small angles in the range $[0.573°, $ $5.73°] = [0.01, 0.1]\ rad$. In this angular range, $sin(\theta) \approx tan(\theta)$, so the combined $sin$-$tan$ scale suffices. The following is the Nestler 23 R Rietz, a German make known to be favoured by boffins, including Albert Einstein. The 23 R dates to 1907, but the example below is from the 1930s. The frontside has $K$ and $A$ scales on the upper frame; $B$, $CI$ , and $C$ scales on the slide; and $D$ and $L$ scales on the lower frame. The $CI$ scale is the reverse $C$ scale that runs from right to left.</p>

<p><img src="https://amenzwa.github.io/stem/figures/SlideRules/Nestler23R/DSC00151.JPG" alt="Nestler 23 R"></p>

<p>The backside of the Nestler 23 R have traditional, Mannheim-style offset cutouts at each end and black index marks engraved onto the wood frame. The backside of the slide holds the $S$, $ST$, and $T$ scales. The $S$ and $ST$ scales are read in the right-hand cutout, and the $ST$ and the $T$ scales are read in the left-hand cutout.</p>

<p>Some slide rules, like this older Nestler 23 R below, came with magnifying cursor glass to allow a more precise scale reading. But I find the distorted view at the edges of the magnifier rather vexing. This model looks to be from the 1920s.</p>

<p><img src="https://amenzwa.github.io/stem/figures/SlideRules/Nestler23R/DSC00153.JPG" alt="Nestler 23 R with magnifier"></p>

<p><strong><em>Darmstadt type</em></strong>—Another German innovation was the Darmstadt type, designed in 1924 by Alwin Walther, a professor at the Technical University of Darmstadt, for D&amp;P (Aristo). Darmstadt rule was the workhorse preferred by the early 20th century engineers. It added three $LL_n$ scales ($LL_1$, $LL_2$, and $LL_3$) which are used to compute general exponentiation of the form $x^{y/z} = \sqrt[z]{x^y}$, when $x &gt; 1$. When $z = 1$, the general expression reduces to $x^y$. When $y = 1$, the general expression reduces to $x^{1/z} = \sqrt[z]{x}$. Newer, more advanced models sport the fourth $LL_0$ scale. The following is the Aristo 967 U Darmstadt from the mid 1970s.</p>

<p><img src="https://amenzwa.github.io/stem/figures/SlideRules/Aristo967U/DSC00162.JPG" alt="Aristo 967 U"></p>

<p>The backside of the Aristo 967 U’s slide has the $L$ and the three $LL_n$ scales. Being that it is a late model Darmstadt simplex rule with a clear plastic back, the entire lengths of these scales are visible at once—a definite improvement to usability compared to the tradition wood rules with cutouts. These scales are read against the fixed red hairline at each end.</p>

<p><strong><em>log-log duplex type</em></strong>—Modern engineering slide rules generally are of the log-log duplex type. The duplex scale layout was invented by <a href="https://mccoys-kecatalogs.com/KECollection/1744/ke_1744family.htm">William Cox</a> in 1895 for K&amp;E. The models used by engineering students have three black $LL_n$ scales ($LL_1$, $LL_2$, and $LL_3$ running from left to right) for cases where $x &gt; 1$ and three red $LL_{0n}$ scales ($LL_{01}$, $LL_{02}$, and $LL_{03}$ running from right to left) for cases where $x &lt; 1$. More advanced models used by professional engineers have four black-red pairs of $LL$ scales.</p>

<p>The Faber-Castell (FC) 2/83 N Novo Duplex slide rule, shown below, is a late model, advanced engineering rule from the mid 1970s. It was designed and manufactured at the close of the slide rule era. It was especially popular outside the US. It is a rather long and wide slide rule. And it was arguably one of the most aesthetically pleasing slide rules ever made.</p>

<p><img src="https://amenzwa.github.io/stem/figures/SlideRules/FC2-83N/DSC00194.JPG" alt="FC 2/83 N"></p>

<p>Aside from sporting four black-red pairs of $LL$ scales on the backside, the FC 2/83 N has $T_1, T_2$ expanded $tan$ scales and $W_1, W_2$ specialised scale pairs for computing $\sqrt{x}$ with greater precision.</p>

<h2 id="circular-rules"><em>circular rules</em></h2>

<p>Circular slide rules can be categorised into three types: simplex, pocket watch, and duplex. Circular rules were popular with businessmen, and the most popular models were of the stylish, pocket watch type.</p>

<p><strong><em>simplex type</em></strong>—The diameter of the FC 8/10 circular rule is only 12 cm, but in terms of capability, it is equivalent to a 25-cm Rietz straight rule. The FC 8/10 is an atypical circular rule: most circular rules use spiral scales, but the FC 8/10 uses traditional Rietz scales in wrapped, circular form. The example shown below was made in the mid 1970s.</p>

<p><img src="https://amenzwa.github.io/stem/figures/SlideRules/FC8-10/DSC00123.JPG" alt="FC 8/10"></p>

<p>Since the FC 8/10 is a simplex circular rule, its backside holds no scales; instead it bears use instructions and a few scientific constants.</p>

<p><img src="https://amenzwa.github.io/stem/figures/SlideRules/FC8-10/DSC00124.JPG" alt="FC 8/10"></p>

<p><strong><em>pocket watch type</em></strong>—A more typical design for circular slide rules is the pocket watch variety, like the Fowler’s Universal Calculator shown below. <a href="https://www.nzeldes.com/HOC/Fowlers.htm">William Fowler</a> of Manchester, England, began manufacturing calculating devices in 1898. This particular model probably dates to the 1950s. Fowler slide rules were made to exacting standards, like a stylish, expensive pocket watch, and are operated like a watch, too, using the two crowns.</p>

<p><img src="https://amenzwa.github.io/stem/figures/SlideRules/FowlerUniversal/DSC00121.JPG" alt="Fowler Universal Calculator"></p>

<p>The backside of the Fowler’s Universal Calculator is covered in black leather. This device is small enough to fit in the palm and the edges of the metal case are rounded, so it is quite comfortable to hold.</p>

<p><img src="https://amenzwa.github.io/stem/figures/SlideRules/FowlerUniversal/DSC00122.JPG" alt="Fowler Universal Calculator"></p>

<p><strong><em>duplex type</em></strong>—It is no secret that most engineers disliked the circular slide rule; many were downright derisive. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seymour_Cray">Seymour Cray</a>, the designer of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cray">CRAY super computer</a>, my favourite electrical engineer and my fellow circular slide rule fancier, <a href="https://youtu.be/8Z9VStbhplQ?t=713">once quipped</a>, “If you had a circular [slide rule], you had some social problems in college.” But the Dempster RotaRule Model AA was the circular rule that even the most ardent straight rule enthusiast found tempting. It is a duplex circular rule. And it is exceedingly well made. Its plastic is as good as the European plastics, far superior to the plastics used by American manufacturers like K&amp;E. It is the brainchild of <a href="http://oughtred.org/jos/Davis_DempsterRotaRule.pdf">John Dempster</a>, an American mechanical engineer. The Dempster RotaRule Model AA shown below is probably from the late 1940s. Unconventionally, the trigonometric scales are on the frontside.</p>

<p><img src="https://amenzwa.github.io/stem/figures/SlideRules/DempsterRotaRule/DSC00133.JPG" alt="Dempster RotaRule Model AA"></p>

<p>The backside of the Dempster RotaRule holds the four $LL_n$ scales among others.</p>

<p><img src="https://amenzwa.github.io/stem/figures/SlideRules/DempsterRotaRule/DSC00134.JPG" alt="Dempster RotaRule Model AA"></p>

<h2 id="cylindrical-rules"><em>cylindrical rules</em></h2>

<p>All cylindrical rules emphasise precision, so they all have very long scales. Some cylindrical rules use the helical-scale design, while others use the stacked straight-scale design. Cylindrical rules come in two types: pocket type and desk type. The business community favoured the greater precision these devices afforded. As such, most cylindrical rules were very large; they were made for the banker’s ornate mahogany desk.</p>

<p><strong><em>pocket type</em></strong>—The Otis King Model L, shown below, is a contradiction: it is a compact cylindrical rule that, when collapsed, is well shy of an open palm. Portability wise, this cylindrical rule could compete with larger pocket watch type circular rules. But because the Model L employs helical scales, its precision is far superior to that of common straight rules and pocket watch circular rules. This particular Model L is likely from the 1950s.</p>

<p><img src="https://amenzwa.github.io/stem/figures/SlideRules/OtisKingL/DSC00148.JPG" alt="Otis King Model L"></p>

<p><strong><em>desk type</em></strong>—A giant among large cylindrical rules was the <a href="https://www.si.edu/object/keuffel-esser-1740-thacher-cylindrical-slide-rule:nmah_1131289">K&amp;E 1740</a>, designed in 1881 by <a href="https://www.si.edu/spotlight/slide-rules/cylindrical-slide-rules">Edwin Thacher</a>, an American engineer working for K&amp;E. I have never seen this device in person, so I do not know the finer points of how it was used. But the <a href="https://youtu.be/EsDCXxn4Fpk?t=68">general operating principles</a> are similar to that of the Otis King Model K: the outer cylinder is mounted to the wooden base but it can spin in place. The inner cylinder shifts and spins independently of the outer cylinder. The inner cylinder’s scale is read through the slits in the outer cylinder’s scale. Thus, the outer cylinder is analogous to the straight rule’s frame, and the inner cylinder is analogous to the straight rule’s slide. There is, however, no cursor on this device; it is unnecessary, since the large, legible scales can be lined up against each other by eye. The first Thacher model dates to 1881. The one shown in the photograph blow, a museum piece, is probably a late model from the 1950s, by the look of it.</p>

<p><img src="https://amenzwa.github.io/stem/figures/SlideRules/K&amp;E1740Thacher/K&amp;E1740Thacher.jpg" alt="K&amp;E 1740 Thacher"></p>

<h2 id="operations">OPERATIONS</h2>

<p>Ordinary engineering slide rules provide arithmetic, logarithm, exponential, and trigonometric functions. Some advanced models provide hyperbolic functions. More models provide speciality-specific functions: electronic, electrical, mechanical, chemical, civil, and so forth. Here, I shall ignore such speciality-specific rules.</p>

<h2 id="arithmetic"><em>arithmetic</em></h2>

<p>The impetus for the slide rule’s invention was to expedite $×$ and $÷$. These arithmetic operations were performed using the $C$ and the $D$ scales. Over time, slide rule designers had created numerous scales that augment the $C$ and $D$ scales: reciprocal $CI$ and $DI$; folded $CF$ and $DF$; and folded reciprocal $CIF$ and $DIF$.</p>

<p>In 1775, <a href="https://www.si.edu/object/nmah_1127892">Thomas Everard</a>, an English excise officer, inverted Gunter’s logarithmic scale, thus paving the way for the reciprocal $CI$ and $DI$ scales that run from right to left. Using $D$ and $C$, $a ÷ b$ is computed as $a_D - b_C$. But using $D$ and $CI$, this expression is computed as $a_D + b_{CI}$:</p>

<p>
$$
\begin{align}
a ÷ b &amp;= log^{-1}[log(a) - log(b)] \nonumber \\
  &amp;= log^{-1}[log(a) + log(\frac{1}{b})] \nonumber
\end{align}
$$
</p>

<p>The $CF$, $DF$, $CIF$, and $DIF$ scales are called “folded”, because they fold the $C$, $D$, $CI$, and $DI$ scales, respectively, at $\pi$, thereby shifting the $1$ mark to the middle of the scale. The following photograph shows these auxiliary scales on the slide.</p>

<p><img src="https://amenzwa.github.io/stem/figures/SlideRules/K&amp;E4081-3/DSC00176.JPG" alt="folded and inverted scales"></p>

<p>These auxiliary scales often reduce slide and cursor movement distances considerably, thereby speeding up computations. But I shall not present the detailed procedures on using these auxiliary scales, because they are procedural optimisations not essential to understanding slide rule fundamentals. Interested readers may refer to the user’s manuals, which are listed in the resource section at the end of the article.</p>

<h2 id="logarithm"><em>logarithm</em></h2>

<p>The logarithm $L$ scale is the irony of the slide rule. The $log$ function is nonlinear. But because the slide rule is based upon this very same nonlinearity, the $L$ scale appears linear when inscribed on the slide rule.</p>

<p>To compute $log(2)$, we manipulate the slide rule as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>$D$—Place the cursor hairline on the <em>argument</em> $2$ on the $D$ scale.</li>
  <li>$L$—Read under the hairline the <em>result</em> $0.301$ on the $L$ scale. This computes $log(2) = 0.301$.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://amenzwa.github.io/stem/figures/SlideRules/K&amp;E4081-3/log-2.jpg" alt="log(2)"></p>

<h2 id="exponentiation"><em>exponentiation</em></h2>

<p><strong><em>squaring on slide rule</em></strong>—A typical engineering slide rule provides the $A$ scale on the frame and the $B$ scale on the slide for computing $x^2$, the $K$ scale on the frame for computing $x^3$, and the $LL_n$ scales and their reciprocals $LL_{0n}$ scales on the frame for computing $x^y$. The procedures for computing powers and roots always involve the $D$ scale on the frame.</p>

<p>To compute $3^2$, we manipulate the slide rule as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>$D$—Place the hairline on the <em>argument</em> $3$ on the $D$ scale.</li>
  <li>$A$—Read under the hairline the <em>result</em> $9$ on the $A$ scale. This computes $3^2 = 9$.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://amenzwa.github.io/stem/figures/SlideRules/K&amp;E4081-3/3%5E2.jpg" alt="3^2"></p>

<p>The $A$-$D$ scale pair computes $x^2$, because $A$ is a double-cycle logarithmic scale and $D$ is a single-cycle logarithmic scale. In the reverse direction, the $D$-$A$ scale pair computes $\sqrt{x}$.</p>

<p>To compute $\sqrt{9}$, we manipulate the slide rule as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>$A$—Place the hairline on the <em>argument</em> $9$ in the first cycle of the $A$ scale.</li>
  <li>$D$—Read under the hairline the result $3$ on the $D$ scale. This computes $\sqrt{9} = 3$.</li>
</ul>

<p>But placing the hairline on $9$ in the second cycle of the $A$ scale would compute $\sqrt{90} = 9.49$.</p>

<p><strong><em>cubing on slide rule</em></strong>—It is a little known fact that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton">Isaac Newton</a> invented the cubic $K$ scale in 1675 by solving the cubic equation. The $K$-$D$ scale pair computes $x^3$ because $K$ is a triple-cycle logarithmic scale. And the reverse $D$-$K$ scale pair computes $\sqrt[3]{x}$.</p>

<p>To compute $3^3$, we manipulate the slide rule as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>$D$—Place the hairline on the <em>argument</em> $3$ on the $D$ scale.</li>
  <li>$K$—Read under the hairline the <em>result</em> $27$ on the second cycle of the $K$ scale. This computes $3^3 = 27$.</li>
</ul>

<p>When computing $\sqrt[3]{x}$, the digits to the left of the decimal are grouped by threes, and if the left-most group has one digit (say $1,000$) then place the argument in $K$ scale’s first cycle; if two digits (say $22,000$) then in the second cycle; and if three digits (say $333,000$) then in the third cycle.</p>

<p>To compute $\sqrt[3]{64000}$, we manipulate the slide rule as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>$K$—Place the hairline on the <em>argument</em> $64$ in the second cycle of the $K$ scale.</li>
  <li>$D$—Read under the hairline the <em>result</em> $4$ on the $D$ scale. A quick mental calculation $\sqrt[3]{1000} = 10$ indicates that the result should be in the tens, so the actual result is $40$. This computes $\sqrt[3]{64000} = 40$.</li>
</ul>

<p>Placing the hairline on $6.4$ in the first cycle of the $K$ scale would compute $\sqrt[3]{6.4} = 1.857$, and placing the hairline on $640$ in the third cycle of the $K$ scale would compute $\sqrt[3]{640} = 8.62$.</p>

<p><strong><em>logarithmic exponentiation</em></strong>—General exponentiation of the form $x^{y/z}$ can be reduced to arithmetic operations by applying the $log$ function:</p>

<p>
$$
log(x^{y/z}) = y ÷ z × log(x)
$$
</p>

<p>Then, $×$ and $÷$ can be further reduced to $+$ and $-$ by applying the $log$ function once more:</p>

<p>
$$
log(y ÷ z × log(x)) = log(y) - log(z) + log \circ log(x)
$$
</p>

<p>It turns out that the slide rule performs this trick using the base-$e$ natural logarithm $ln$ as the inner logarithm and the base-$10$ common logarithm $log$ as the outer logarithm. That is, the function composition is actually $log \circ ln$, not $log \circ log$. The $ln$ is used instead of the $log$ for the inner logarithm, in order to compress the range of the $LL_n$ scale, thereby improving reading precision. Hence, computing $x^{y/z}$ on the slide rule is equivalent to performing the following logarithmic operations:</p>

<p>
$$
\begin{align}
x^{y/z} &amp;= \color{darkgreen}{ln^{-1}}[y ÷ z × \color{green}{ln}(x)] \nonumber \\
  &amp;= \color{darkgreen}{ln^{-1}}[ \color{darkblue}{log^{-1}} [\color{blue}{log} [y ÷ z × \color{green}{ln}(x) ] ] ] \nonumber \\
  &amp;= \color{darkgreen}{ln^{-1}} [\color{darkblue}{log^{-1}} [\color{blue}{log}(y) - \color{blue}{log}(z) + \color{blue}{log} \circ \color{green}{ln}(x) ] ] \nonumber
\end{align}
$$
</p>

<p>So, computing $2^4$ and $\sqrt[4]{16}$ on the slide rule proceed as follows:</p>

<p>
$$
\begin{align}
2^4 &amp;= 2^{4/1} \nonumber \\
  &amp;= ln^{-1}[4 ÷ 1 × ln(2)] \nonumber \\
  &amp;= ln^{-1}[log^{-1} [log(4) - log(1) + log \circ ln(2) ] ] \nonumber \\
  &amp;= 16 \nonumber
\end{align}
$$
</p>
<p>
$$
\begin{align}
\sqrt[4]{16} &amp;= 16^{1/4} \nonumber \\
  &amp;= ln^{-1}[1 ÷ 4 × ln(16)] \nonumber \\
  &amp;= ln^{-1}[log^{-1} [log(1) - log(4) + log \circ ln(16) ] ] \nonumber \\
  &amp;= 2 \nonumber
\end{align}
$$
</p>

<p>We now see that the “log-log” nomenclature of engineering slide rules is a not-so-subtle nod to the function composition $\color{blue}{log} \circ \color{green}{ln}$ that appears in the expressions computing $x^{y/z}$.</p>

<p>On the slide rule, the $LL$ scales compute general exponentiation $x^{y/z}$. It is, therefore, reasonable to ask, “If the $LL$ scale pairs can compute arbitrary powers and roots, why waste precious real estate with the redundant $A$, $B$, and $K$ scales?” The answer is convenience. Engineering calculations make frequent use of squares (for Pythagoreans and areas) and cubes (for volumes), and these scales provide quick calculations of those operations. Although the $LL$ scales possess greater flexibility and precision, their procedures are commensurately more intricate and error prone.</p>

<p>Recall that reading the result on the $D$ scale implicitly performs $log^{-1}$. Likewise, reading the result on the $LL_n$ scale implicitly performs $ln^{-1}$.</p>

<p><strong><em>natural logarithm scale</em></strong>—The black $LL_n$ scale is closely related to the base-$e$ ($e = 2.718$) natural logarithm $ln$. The $LL_n$ and the $D$ scales are related by a bijective function $ln$:</p>

<p>
$$
\begin{align}
ln &amp;: LL_n \rightarrow D \nonumber \\
ln^{-1} &amp;: D \rightarrow LL_n \nonumber
\end{align}
$$
</p>

<p>In the plot below, the black curve is $ln$ and the red is $ln^{-1}$.</p>

<p><img src="https://amenzwa.github.io/stem/figures/SlideRules/plot-ln.jpg" alt="ln"></p>

<p>The special name for $ln^{-1}$ is exponential function $e^x$. The $LL_n$ and the $D$ scales form a transform pair that converts between the base-$e$ natural logarithm scale and the base-$10$ common logarithm scale.</p>

<p>Unlike the $D$ scale, the black $LL_n$ scale is not cyclic; it is one long scale. On the K&amp;E 4081-3, the black $LL_n$ scale is divided into these three ranges:</p>

<ul>
  <li>$LL_1$: $x ∈ [1.01 \rightarrow 1.105] \implies ln(x) ∈ [0.01, 0.1]$</li>
  <li>$LL_2$: $x ∈ [1.105 \rightarrow e] \implies ln(x) ∈ [0.1, 1.0]$</li>
  <li>$LL_3$: $x ∈ [e \rightarrow 22000] \implies ln(x) ∈ [1.0, 10.0]$
    <ul>
      <li>$e = 2.718$ and $ln(e) = 1.0$</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>These ranges of the $LL_n$ scales clearly show the rate of exponential growth. The function composition $log \circ ln$ used to derive the $LL_n$ scales, so that the $LL_3$ scale lines up perfectly with the $D$ scale: $log(ln(e)) = 0$ and $log(ln(22000)) = 1$. The lower $LL_n$ scales are similarly derived in accordance with their respective ranges.</p>

<p>Had we used the $log \circ log$ function composition to construct the $LL_n$ scales, the range of the $LL_3$ scale would be $[10^1, 10^{10}]$, instead. Shrinking this galactic scale down to a 25-cm length would make the scale resolution unusably coarse. The function $e^x$ is famous for its fast growth rate, but $10^x$ beats it, hands down.</p>

<p>The red $\color{red}{LL_{0n}}$ scales are reciprocals of the black $LL_n$ scales. As such, these scales run from right to left. On the K&amp;E 4081-3, the red $\color{red}{LL_{0n}}$ scale is divided into these ranges:</p>

<ul>
  <li>$\color{red}{LL_{01}}$: $x ∈ [0.9901 \leftarrow 0.905] \implies ln(x) ∈ [-0.01, -0.1]$</li>
  <li>$\color{red}{LL_{02}}$: $x ∈ [0.905 \leftarrow 1/e] \implies ln(x) ∈ [-0.1, -1.0]$</li>
  <li>$\color{red}{LL_{03}}$: $x ∈ [1/e \leftarrow 0.000045] \implies ln(x) ∈ [-1.0, -10.0]$
    <ul>
      <li>$1/e = 0.368$ and $ln(1/e) = -1.0$</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Because the $LL$ scales are intimately linked to $ln$, and by extension to $e^x$, many slide rules label the $LL_n$ scales as $e^x$ and the $\color{red}{LL_{0n}}$ scales as $e^{-x}$. Note the terminology: the term “exponentiation” refers to the expression $x^y$, and the term “exponential” refers to the function $e^x$.</p>

<p>To compute $ln(2)$, we manipulate the slide rule as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>$LL_2$—Place the hairline on the <em>argument</em> $2$ on the $LL_2$ scale.</li>
  <li>$D$—Read under the hairline the <em>result</em> $693$ on the $D$ scale. As per the legend inscribed on the right side of the $LL_2$ scale, the value of $ln(2) ∈ [0.1, 1.0]$. Hence, we read $ln(2) = 0.693$.</li>
</ul>

<p>To compute $ln(3)$, we manipulate the slide rule as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>$LL_3$—Place the hairline on the <em>argument</em> $3$ on the $LL_3$ scale.</li>
  <li>$D$—Read under the hairline the <em>result</em> $1099$ on the $D$ scale. As per the legend inscribed on the right side of the $LL_3$ scale, the value of $ln(3) ∈ [1.0, 10.0]$. Hence, we read $ln(3) = 1.099$.</li>
</ul>

<p>Computing $e^x$, however, is not the primary purpose of the $LL$ scale pairs; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Mark_Roget">Peter Roget</a>, an English physician and the creator of the Roget Thesaurus, designed this scale to compute arbitrary powers and roots in the form of $x^{y/z}$. The black $LL_n$ scales are for computing powers and roots of $x &gt; 1$, and the red $\color{red}{LL_{0n}}$ for $x &lt; 1$.</p>

<p>As we have seen earlier, multiplication and division start and end on the fixed $D$ scale and requires the use of the sliding the $C$ scale. Likewise, exponentiation starts and ends on the fixed $LL$ scales and requires the use of the sliding $C$ scale. At a glance, computing $x^y$ seems as straightforward as computing $x × y$. But in truth, the $LL$ scales are beguiling; using them correctly requires care, and using them quickly requires practice. A typical first-year engineering student takes several weeks of regular use to become proficient with the $LL$ scales.</p>

<p>The procedures for computing $x^y$ using the $LL$ scales are complex enough that they warrant being split into two cases: when $x &gt; 1$ and when $x &lt; 1$.</p>

<p><strong><em>exponentiation for the $x &gt; 1$ case</em></strong>—If $x &gt; 1$, we use the $LL_n$ scales and the $C$ scale to compute $x^y$ as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If $y ∈ [0.1, 1]$, the result is always less than the base, so read the result further down the scale, either to the left on the same scale or on the next lower scale.</li>
  <li>If $y ∈ [0.001, 0.1]$, reduce the problem to the $y ∈ [0.1, 1]$ case by mentally shifting the decimal point one or two places to the right.</li>
  <li>If $y ∈ [1, 10]$, the result is always greater than the base, so read the result further up the scale, either to the right on the same scale or on the next higher scale.</li>
  <li>If $y ∈ [10, 100]$, reduce the problem to the $y ∈ [1, 10]$ case by mentally shifting the decimal point one or two places to the left.</li>
  <li>If the result exceeds $22000$, factor out $10$ from the base (as in $23^8 = 2.3^8 × 10^8$) or factor out 10 from the exponent (as in $1.9^{23} = 1.9^{10} × 1.9^{13}$).</li>
</ul>

<p>To compute $1.03^{2.4}$, we manipulate the slide rule as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>$LL_1$—Place the hairline on the <em>base</em> $1.03$ on the $LL_1$ scale on the backside of the slide rule.</li>
  <li>$C$—Flip the slide rule to the frontside. Slide the left-hand $1$ on the $C$ scale under the hairline.</li>
  <li>$C$—Place the hairline on the <em>exponent</em> $2.4$ on the $C$ scale.</li>
  <li>$LL_1$—Flip the slide rule to the backside. Read under the hairline the <em>result</em> $1.0735$ on the $LL_1$ scale. This computes $1.03^{2.4} = 1.0735$.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://amenzwa.github.io/stem/figures/SlideRules/K&amp;E4081-3/1.03%5E2.4.jpg" alt="1.03^2.4"></p>

<p>Sometimes, we get into a bit of a quandary. Say, we wish to compute $1.03^{9.2}$. We line up the $C$ scale’s left-hand $1$ with the $LL_1$ scale’s $1.03$. But now, the $C$ scale’s $9.2$ has fallen off the right edge of the slide rule. What this indicates is that we have exceeded the upper limit of the $LL_1$ scale from whence we began, and have ventured onto the $LL_2$ scale. That means we must read the result on the $LL_2$ scale. In order to avoid going off the edge, we instead use the folded $CF$ scale.</p>

<p>To compute $1.03^{9.2}$, we manipulate the slide rule as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>$LL_1$—Place the hairline on the <em>base</em> $1.03$ on the $LL_1$ scale on the backside of the slide rule.</li>
  <li>$CF$—Flip the slide rule to the frontside. Slide the middle $1$ on the $CF$ scale under the hairline.</li>
  <li>$CF$—Place the hairline on the <em>exponent</em> $9.2$ on the $CF$ scale.</li>
  <li>$LL_2$—Read under the hairline the <em>result</em> $1.3125$ on the $LL_2$ scale. This computes $1.03^{9.2} = 1.3125$.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://amenzwa.github.io/stem/figures/SlideRules/K&amp;E4081-3/1.03%5E9.2.jpg" alt="1.03^9.2"></p>

<p>If the exponent is negative, we read the result on the $\color{red}{LL_{0n}}$ scale. Because $x^{-y} = 1/x^y$ and $LL_n = 1/\color{red}{LL_{0n}}$, computing $x^y$ on the $LL_n$ scale but reading the result on the $\color{red}{LL_{0n}}$ scale yields $x^{-y}$.</p>

<p>To compute $2.22^{-1.11}$, we manipulate the slide rule as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>$LL_2$—Place the hairline on the <em>base</em> $2.22$ on the $LL_2$ scale.</li>
  <li>$CI$—Slide the <em>exponent</em> $1.11$ on the $CI$ scale under the hairline.</li>
  <li>$CI$—Place the hairline on the right-hand $1$ of the $CI$ scale.</li>
  <li>$\color{red}{LL_{02}}$—Read under the hairline the <em>result</em> $0.413$ on the $\color{red}{LL_{02}}$ scale. This computes $2.22^{-1.11} = 1/ 2.22^{1.11} = 0.413$.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://amenzwa.github.io/stem/figures/SlideRules/K&amp;E4081-3/2.22%5E-1.11.jpg" alt="2.22^1.11"></p>

<p>Had we read the result on the $LL_2$ scale, we would have computed $2.22^{1.11} = 2.434$. But by reading the result on the $\color{red}{LL_{02}}$ scale, we compute the reciprocal $1/2.434 = 0.413$, as desired. The $LL$ scales are the most powerful scales on an engineering straight rule. But with that power comes numerous traps for the unweary. Interested readers may read the user’s manuals listed in the resources section at the end of the article.</p>

<p>When computing $2.22^{-1.11}$ above, we used the $CI$ scale, instead of the $C$ scale, as usual. This is because the base  $2.22$ is far to the right edge of the slide rule, had we used the $C$ scale, the slide would be hanging almost entirely off the right edge. Using the $CI$ scale in this case reduces the slide movement distance, considerably.</p>

<p><strong><em>exponentiation for the $x &lt; 1$ case</em></strong>—If $x &lt; 1$, we use the $\color{red}{LL_{0n}}$ scales and the $C$ scale to compute $x^y$. The procedures for the $\color{red}{LL_{0n}}$ scales are analogously categorised into four ranges of the exponent, the details of which I shall forego.</p>

<p>To compute $0.222^{1.11}$, we manipulate the slide rule as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>$\color{red}{LL_{03}}$—Place the hairline on the <em>base</em> $0.222$ on the $\color{red}{LL_{03}}$ scale.</li>
  <li>$C$—Slide the left-hand $1$ on the $C$ scale under the hairline.</li>
  <li>$C$—Place the hairline on the <em>exponent</em> $1.11$ on the $C$ scale.</li>
  <li>$\color{red}{LL_{03}}$—Read under the hairline the <em>result</em> $0.188$ on the $\color{red}{LL_{03}}$ scale. This computes $0.222^{1.11} = 0.188$.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="trigonometric"><em>trigonometric</em></h2>

<p>Trigonometric functions are related to each other by these identities:</p>

<p>
$$
\begin{align}
sin(\theta) &amp;= cos(90° - \theta) \nonumber \\
cos(\theta) &amp;= sin(90° - \theta) \nonumber \\
tan(\theta) &amp;= cot(90° - \theta) = sin(\theta) / cos(\theta) = 1 / cot(\theta) \nonumber \\
cot(\theta) &amp;= tan(90° - \theta) = cos(\theta) / sin(\theta) = 1 / tan(\theta) \nonumber \\
sec(\theta) &amp;= 1 / cos(\theta) \nonumber \\
csc(\theta) &amp;= 1 / sin(\theta) \nonumber
\end{align}
$$
</p>

<p>In the plot below, the blue curve is $sin$, the green is $cos$, and the red is $tan$.</p>

<p><img src="https://amenzwa.github.io/stem/figures/SlideRules/plot-sin-cos-tan.jpg" alt="sin-cos-tan"></p>

<p><strong><em>black $S$ scale</em></strong>—The $S$ scale on the slide rule is graduated in degrees from $5.73°$ to $90°$. When $\theta ∈ [5.73°, 90°]$ on the $S$ scale, $sin(\theta) ∈ [0.1, 1.0]$ on the $C$ scale. The $S$ and the $C$ scales are related by a bijective function $sin$:</p>

<p>
$$
\begin{align}
sin &amp;: S \rightarrow C \nonumber \\
sin^{-1} &amp;: C \rightarrow S \nonumber
\end{align}
$$
</p>

<p>In the plot below, the black curve is $sin$ and the blue is $sin^{-1}$. Note that the inverse function (here $sin^{-1}$) is a reflection in the $y = x$ line of the original function (here $sin$). In the figure below, the $x$-axis represents the angle $\theta$ in radians.</p>

<p><img src="https://amenzwa.github.io/stem/figures/SlideRules/plot-sin.jpg" alt="sin"></p>

<p>To compute $sin(30°)$, we manipulate the slide rule as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>$S$—Place the hairline on the <em>argument</em> $30°$ on the black $S$ scale.</li>
  <li>$C$—Read under the hairline the <em>result</em> $0.5$ on the $C$ scale. This computes $sin(30°) = 0.5$.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://amenzwa.github.io/stem/figures/SlideRules/K&amp;E4081-3/sin-30.jpg" alt="sin(30)"></p>

<p>To compute $\theta$ in the expression $sin(\theta) = 0.866$, we do the opposite: set the argument $0.866$ on the $C$ scale and read the result $60°$ on the $S$ scale. This computes $\theta = sin^{-1}(0.866) = 60°$.</p>

<p><strong><em>red $\color{red}{S}$ scale</em></strong>—The $S$ scale is graduated from left to right, in black, for $sin$ between the angles $5.73°$ and $90°$. But since $cos(\theta) = sin(90° - \theta)$, the $cos$ scale is readily combined into the $S$ scale, but in the reverse direction and marked in red. Hence, $cos(\theta)$ is computed using the same procedure, but in reference to the red $\color{red}{S}$ scale.</p>

<p>In the plot below, the red curve is $cos$ and the blue is $cos^{-1}$.</p>

<p><img src="https://amenzwa.github.io/stem/figures/SlideRules/plot-cos.jpg" alt="cos"></p>

<p><strong><em>black $T$ scale</em></strong>—The $T$ scale is graduated in degrees from $5.73°$ to $45°$. When $\theta ∈ [5.73°, 45°]$ on the $T$ scale, $tan(\theta) ∈ [0.1, 1.0]$ on the $C$ scale. The $T$ and the $C$ scales are related by a bijective function $tan$:</p>

<p>
$$
\begin{align}
tan &amp;: T \rightarrow C \nonumber \\
tan^{-1} &amp;: C \rightarrow T \nonumber
\end{align}
$$
</p>

<p>In the plot below, the black curve is $tan$ and the blue is $tan^{-1}$.</p>

<p><img src="https://amenzwa.github.io/stem/figures/SlideRules/plot-tan.jpg" alt="tan"></p>

<p><strong><em>red $\color{red}{T}$ scale</em></strong>—The $T$ scale, too, has red markings, running right to left, for $\theta ∈ [45°, 84.29°]$. The red $\color{red}{T}$ scale is used for $tan(\theta) ∈ [1 \rightarrow 10]$ and for $cot(\theta) ∈ [1.0 \leftarrow 0.1]$. The red $\color{red}{T}$ scale is used in conjunction with the reciprocal $CI$ scale.</p>

<p>To compute $tan(83°)$, we manipulate the slide rule as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>$T$—Place the hairline on the <em>argument</em> $83°$ on the red $\color{red}{T}$ scale.</li>
  <li>$CI$—Read under the hairline the <em>result</em> 8.14 on the $CI$ scale. This computes $tan(83°) = 8.14$.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://amenzwa.github.io/stem/figures/SlideRules/K&amp;E4081-3/tan-83.jpg" alt="tan(83)"></p>

<p>Since $cot(\theta) = tan(90° - \theta) = 1/tan(\theta)$, we may compute $cot(\theta)$ using the black $T$ scale or the red $\color{red}{T}$ scale, as per the procedure described above. So, to compute $cot(83°)$, we use the same procedure as $tan(83°)$ on the red $\color{red}{T}$ scale, but read the result $cot(83°) = 1/tan(83°) = 0.1228$ on the $C$ scale, instead of the $CI$ scale. Alternatively, we may compute $tan(90° - 83°)$ on the black $T$ scale, and read the result $cot(83°) = tan(7°) = 0.1228$ also on the $C$ scale.</p>

<p>In the plot below, the red curve is $cot$​ and the green is $cot^{-1}$​.</p>

<p><img src="https://amenzwa.github.io/stem/figures/SlideRules/plot-cot.jpg" alt="cot"></p>

<p><strong><em>$ST$ or $SRT$ scale</em></strong>—The $ST$ scale is used to compute $sin$ and $tan$ for small angles in the range $[0.573°, 5.73°] = [0.01, 0.1]\ rad$, because $sin(\theta) \approx tan(\theta)$ for small angles. For such small angles, we may exploit another approximation: $sin(\theta) \approx tan(\theta) \approx \theta\ rad$, where the angle $\theta$ is measured in radians. For this reason, some manufacturers, like K&amp;E, label the $ST$ scale as $SRT$ for $sin$-$rad$-$tan$.</p>

<p>In the plot below, the blue curve is $sin$ and the red is $tan$. These two curves are indistinguishable when $\theta ∈ [0.0, 0.1]\ rad$.</p>

<p><img src="https://amenzwa.github.io/stem/figures/SlideRules/plot-sin-tan.jpg" alt="sin-tan"></p>

<p>It is possible to chain trigonometric and arithmetic calculations on the slide rule. This is one of the reasons why calculating with the slide rule is so much faster than using tables. Those who are interested in these details should read the user’s manuals listed in the resources section at the end of the article.</p>

<h2 id="maintenance">MAINTENANCE</h2>

<p><strong><em>calibrating</em></strong>—When an adjustable slide rule, like the K&amp;E 4081-3, goes askew (but not warped), its accuracy can be restore by recalibrating. The frame of this duplex slide rule consists of the fixed lower portion and the adjustable upper portion. The two faces of the cursor are independently adjustable, as well. We calibrate this slide rule as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><em>align slide to lower frame</em></strong>—Nudge the slide and align its $C$ scale with the fixed lower frame’s $D$ scale.</li>
  <li><strong><em>align upper frame to slide</em></strong>—Slightly loosen the screws that hold the upper frame. While keeping the slide aligned with the lower frame, adjust the upper frame so that its $DF$ scale lines up with the slide’s $CF$ scale. Retighten the upper frame screws, but not so tight as to impede the movement of the slide.</li>
  <li><strong><em>align front cursor to frame</em></strong>—After having aligned the lower frame, the slide, and the upper frame, move the cursor hairline on the left-hand $\pi$ of the upper frame’s $DF$ scale and the left-hand $1$ of the lower frame’s $D$ scale on the frontside of the slide rule. Slightly loosen the screws that hold the glass’s metal bracket to the top and bottom lintels of the cursor. Nudge the glass until the hairline is aligned to both the $DF$ and the $D$ scales. Retighten the glass bracket’s screws. Do not over tighten, lest the cursor is damaged.</li>
  <li><strong><em>align back cursor to frame</em></strong>—Flip the slide rule, and align the back cursor to the frame in the same manner.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://amenzwa.github.io/stem/figures/SlideRules/K&amp;E4081-3/calibrating.jpg" alt="calibrating"></p>

<p>Frustrating though it can be to recalibrate a skewed slide rule, that is the easy bit. Reading the scales with adequate precision, however, is trickier, especially for those of us with poor eyesights.</p>

<p><strong><em>cleaning</em></strong>—I can say nothing about maintaining and cleaning vintage Thacher-style large cylindrical rules, since I have never even seen one in person. But straight rules, circular rules, and Otis King-style cylindrical rules should be cleaned by gently wiping down with clean, moist (but not dripping wet) microfibre cloth or paper towel, then dry off the moisture, immediately. Although plastic and aluminium rules can withstand water, wood and bamboo rules cannot. Note that the black handle (the cursor) on the Otis King is actually a black-painted brass cylinder. Aggressive rubbing can scrub off the black paint. And be forewarned: never use chemical solvents.</p>

<p>With use, the slide can get sticky, over time. This is caused by the grime—an amalgam of dust and skin oil—that collect in the crevices between the slide and the frame. This grime can be cleaned with a moist microfibre cloth or paper towel. Do not apply lemon oil, grease, powder, graphite, or any other foreign substance to the slide rule, and especially never to the slide-frame contact areas. Not only does the slide rule not require lubricants, these foreign substances could mar, or perhaps even damage, the device.</p>

<p>Dust also tends to gather under the cursor glass. The easiest way to remove the dust is to blow it out using a compressed air canister. To remove stubborn stains under the glass, however, the cursor may need to be disassembled and cleaned.</p>

<p><img src="https://amenzwa.github.io/stem/figures/SlideRules/K&amp;E4081-3/cleaning.jpg" alt="cleaning"></p>

<p>If you are reading this article, odds are that you do not own a slide rule. It is my hope that you would acquire one, say from <a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&amp;_trksid=p2380057.m570.l2632&amp;_nkw=slide+rules&amp;_sacat=412">eBay</a>, and learn to use it. Your first slide rule should not be a rare, collector’s item; it should be something like the <a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&amp;_trksid=p2047675.m570.l1313&amp;_nkw=K%26E+4081-3+Log+Log+Duplex+Decitrig&amp;_sacat=0">K&amp;E 4081-3 Log Log Duplex Decitrig</a> or the <a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&amp;_trksid=p2334524.m570.l1313&amp;_nkw=Post+1460+Versalog&amp;_sacat=0&amp;LH_TitleDesc=0&amp;_odkw=K%26E+4081-3+Log+Log+Duplex+Decitrig&amp;_osacat=0">Post 1460 Versalog</a>—a cheap, but good, model. If you do end up buying one, yours will most likely be grimy and discoloured, for having been kept in a dusty storage bin for decades. Do not despair; most old slide rules can be renewed to a good extent. The grime and discolouration can be removed by gently—I mean gently—rubbing with the soft, foamy side of a moist (but not dripping wet) <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007C5IH4C?tag=aboutcom02thespruce-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1&amp;ascsubtag=4164819%7Cnca170cbe1d384af0a2b09e62c4e4b9b020%7CB007C5IH4C">kitchen sponge</a> loaded with a spot of dish soap. If you do decide to attack a stain with the rough side of the sponge, use care and judgement, or you will scrub off the scale markings. Use extra care, when scrubbing painted slide rules, like the Pickett aluminium rules. And if yours is a wood slide rule, minimise its contact with water. Immediately dry off the slide rule after cleaning. Do not apply heat as a drying aid. And I strongly suggest that you clean in stages, removing the grime layer by layer.</p>

<h2 id="collecting">COLLECTING</h2>

<p>This section is about collecting slide rules: what to look for, how to purchase, how to avoid pitfalls, etc. I collect slide rules; this should surprise no one reading this article. But I am an atypical collector. I buy but I do not sell. I do not engage in bidding wars on eBay. Most of the slide rules I collect are those that I coveted as a young engineering student in the early 1980s. A few are cheap curiosities. More importantly, I buy slide rules that are not “collector-grade”. That is, my slide rules have high accuracy, but they do not necessarily have high resale value: most are not rarities; some have former owners’ names engraved upon them; many do not come with cases, manuals, wrappings, boxes, and other accoutrement of collecting. Moreover, whereas most collectors favour top-of-the-line, sophisticated, powerful slide rules, I am partial to the humble Darmstadt rule, for this type offers the best balance in terms of density, simplicity, and utility. And as much as I like the Darmstadt rules, I dislike having to use the pocket rules, mainly due to my poor eyesight. Nevertheless, pocket rules are perfectly serviceable; Apollo astronauts staked their lives on it, after all.</p>

<p>My main goal in collecting slide rules is to play, not to display. Although these simple instruments no longer hold practical value today, they were once instrumental in creating immense value for humanity. I acknowledge that fact by collecting them. And by using them, I am able to appreciate more deeply the ingenuity of my forebears, the 19th century engineers who propelled forward humanity and slide rule design. To perpetuate this appreciation, I taught my son how to use slide rules, starting when he was a third-grader. I am motivated by knowledge and nostalgia, not by possessory pride or pecuniary purpose. So, when perusing my collection described herein, take my biases into account: a collection is a reflection of the collector.</p>

<p>Here is a little perspective. In the 1950s, an ordinary engineering slide rule, like the K&amp;E 4081-3, was priced around 20 USD, now. In today’s money, that slide rule would cost about 230 USD. By way of comparison, the <a href="https://www.hp.com/us-en/campaigns/prime-graphing-calculator/overview.html">HP Prime</a> calculator—the ultimate weapon of an engineer—with reverse Polish notation (RPN), computer algebra system (CAS), BASIC programming language, 3D plotting, colour touchscreen, and a whole lot more, costs about 100 USD, new, in 2021. A refurbished Dell laptop with Intel Core i5 CPU and 4 GB of RAM costs about 130 USD. Are you all astonishment?</p>

<p>I purchased all my slide rules on eBay, except these: the Aristo 0968, which was the required equipment at my engineering school in early 1980s Burma, and I purchased it from the government store; the FC 8/10, which was owned by my engineer aunt, who gifted it to me when I entered engineering school; the FC 67/64 R and the FC 2/83 N, which I purchased new from the Faber-Castell online store a couple of decades ago, when the company still had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_old_stock">new old-stock</a> (NOS) slide rules; and the Concise Model 300, which I purchased new from Concise online store several years ago. Concise still makes slide rules today, by the way.</p>

<p>Below, I arranged my collection by slide rule <em>variety</em> (straight, circular, and cylindrical); within each variety by <em>brandname</em>; and under each brandname by <em>capability</em> (Mannheim, Rietz, Darmstadt, log-log duplex, and vector). I took the photographs with a tripod-mounted camera from a fixed position, so as to show the relative sizes of the slide rules. A typical straight rule is approximately 30 cm in overall length, so it should be easy to ascertain the absolute sizes of the devices from these photographs.</p>

<p>Do note that sellers (brands) are not manufacturers, in some cases. For example, Frederick Post (est. 1890), a well-known American company, sold under the Post brand topping bamboo slide rules designed and manufactured by Hemmi of Japan. Hemmi (est. 1895) also sold their superb bamboo slide rules under their own brand. And Keuffel &amp; Esser (est. 1867), the leading American designer and manufacturer of high-quality slide rules, began life as an importer of German slide rules. Also of note was that German manufacturers, Faber-Castell (est. 1761), Aristo (est. 1862), and Nestler (est. 1878), were in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Germany">West Germany</a> (FRD) during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War">Cold War</a>, but Reiss (est. 1882) was in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Germany">East Germany</a> (DDR). And Kontrolpribor (est. 1917), a Russian manufacturer, is more properly labelled a factory in the former <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union">Soviet Union</a>.</p>

<p>Before we proceed, here are some admonishments for those who are buying slide rules for using, not merely for possessing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Do not buy a slide rule with bents, dents, chips, or other deformities. This is the sign that the former owner did not take adequate care. And such extensive damage inevitably affect accuracy.</li>
  <li>Do not worry too much about dust, dirt, and stain; the grime can be cleaned. What is important is that the slide rule is in good nick, physically, and that the scale engravings are undamaged.</li>
  <li>Do not buy a wood slide rule that is showing gaps between the slide and the body. This is the sign of warping. This slide rule cannot be mended, and it cannot be calibrated to restore its accuracy.</li>
  <li>Do not buy from a seller who does not post clear, high-resolution images. It is impossible to assess the condition of slide rule from blurry, low-resolution images.</li>
  <li>Do not buy a bundle of slide rules sold as a lot. The lot inevitably contains slide rules that you do not need, as well as multiple copies of the one you do need.</li>
  <li>Do not focus on one brand or one variety. This strategy will skew your collection, and will cause you to miss out on desirable, innovative slide rules.</li>
  <li>Do not buy slide rules that are specialised exclusively to a particular application domain: artillery, aviation, stadia, photography, stahlbeton, obstetric, etc.</li>
  <li>Do not buy manuals. Every manual is now available online in PDF format.</li>
  <li>Do not chase collector-grade items with complete set of manuals, boxes, etc. Those are for traders.</li>
  <li>Do not chase rarities. Rarity is a quality treasured by traders, so such items tend to be expensive. You cannot learn, when you dare not touch your expensive, collector-grade slide rule.</li>
  <li>Do not engage in a bidding war with traders.</li>
  <li>Do not rush in. Good, clean slide rules always show up on eBay, sooner or later.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="manufacturers"><em>manufacturers</em></h2>

<p>My slide rule collection spans several models from each of the following major manufacturers.</p>

<p><strong><em>Aristo (DE)</em></strong>—Aristo was the slide rule brandname of the German company <a href="http://waywiser.rc.fas.harvard.edu/people/7640/dennert--pape">Dennert &amp; Pape</a> (D&amp;P), founded in 1872. They make top quality rules with understated good looks. D&amp;P were a thought leader in the early part of 20th century. They invented the Rietz scale in 1902 and the Darmstadt scale in 1924. And in 1936, they abandoned wood and began making all-plastic slide rules under the Aristo brand. Plastic is more stable than wood and, hence, a better slide rule material. This high-quality plastic became their signature material. The brandname Aristo eventually became the company name. I have a particular affinity for Aristo because of my first slide rule, the Aristo 0968.</p>

<p><strong><em>Blundell-Harling (UK)</em></strong>—<a href="https://www.blundellharling.com/">Blundell-Harling</a> are an English stationary manufacturer that make technical drawing supplies, today. Back in the day, their BRL slide rules were highly regarded. During the nearly four-century reign of the slide rule, almost every industrialised nation had at least one slide rule manufacturer. But the English slide rules—straight, circular, cylindrical, the lot—were generally superior in terms of craftsmanship and materials. It makes sense in a way; the English invented the slide rule, after all.</p>

<p><strong><em>Breitling (CH)</em></strong>—<a href="https://www.breitling.com/us-en/">Breitling</a> are a famed Swiss watchmaker. They were founded in 1884. They have long been associated with aviation. Their <a href="https://www.breitling.com/us-en/watches/navitimer/">Navitimer</a> line is the first wristwatch with integrated chronograph and slide rule, introduced in 1952 for use by pilots. Instrument flying in those days required pilots to use the cockpit flight instruments together with an accurate chronometer (for flight time, arrival time, etc.), a chronograph (for timed turns, holding patterns, ground speed, etc.), and a slide rule (for navigation, fuel burn calculations, etc.). The Navitimer fulfilled all three needs, because it was a chronometer-grade wristwatch, a chronograph, and a slide rule, all in one. Although flying today had become automated, traditional-minded pilots continue to admire the Navitimer for its history, quality, and utility.</p>

<p><strong><em>Concise (JP)</em></strong>—<a href="https://www.sliderule.tokyo/">Concise</a> are a Japanese maker of drawing and measuring tools. They made good, but low-cost, plastic, circular slide rules. Today in the 21st century, they are the only company still making slide rules.</p>

<p><strong><em>Dempster (US)</em></strong>—Dempster were a boutique American manufacturer of top quality circular slide rules. They were founded by <a href="http://oughtred.org/jos/Davis_DempsterRotaRule.pdf">John Dempster</a>, a Berkeley graduate mechanical engineer, who began manufacturing the Dempster RotaRule in 1928, in the basement of his home in Berkeley, California. The company made only one type of slide rule, and it is the most advanced, and the most desirable, circular slide rules.</p>

<p><strong><em>Faber-Castell (DE)</em></strong>—Founded in 1761, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faber-Castell">Faber-Castell</a> (FC) began life as an office supply company. Today, they remain one of the oldest, and largest, stationary companies. They are now famous for their quality pens and pencils. But for about 100 years, until 1975, FC were a worldwide leader in slide rule making.</p>

<p><strong><em>Fowler (UK)</em></strong>—Fowler were an English maker of pocket watch slide rules, which they called “calculators”. They were founded in 1853, and they held numerous British patents on pocket watch slide rules. Fowler rules were of superlative quality, constructed like expensive pocket watches. And these devices came in high-quality, wooden cases that resembled jewellery boxes.</p>

<p><strong><em>Gilson (US)</em></strong>—Gilson, established in the 1930s, were an American maker of cheap, but powerful, aluminium circular rules with spiral scales. They made many models, both large (almost 22 cm diameter) and small (about 12 cm diameter), but all were of the same, three-cursor design. In some ways, Gilson circular rules expressed the traditional, American engineering philosophy: big, brash, gaudy, tough, powerful, and usable, but cheap.</p>

<p><strong><em>Graphoplex (FR)</em></strong>—Graphoplex were a French maker of splendid-looking slide rules, but with a horrid-looking logo. In terms of quality, French slide rules are on par with German ones. Graphoplex’s <a href="https://revolutionwatch.com/the-watch-face-sector-dials/">sector-dial watch face</a> style scales are quite pleasing to the eye. Although this visual design was common in the late 19th century, it disappeared during the early 20th century. Some early German wood rules used this visual design, but later wood rules abandoned it. Graphoplex, though, carried this visual design to their modern plastic rules, giving these devices a rather unique classic look.</p>

<p><strong><em>Hemmi (JP)</em></strong>—Established in 1895, Hemmi designed and manufactured top-quality, innovative slide rules. They made accurate, elegant instruments using quality materials. Their signature material was bamboo. Bamboo is perhaps the best material with which to make slide rules. It is tough, stable, and naturally slippery. I adore Hemmi rules. Today, they make high-tech electronic devices. Yet, they continue to use the name <a href="https://hemmi-inc.co.jp/english/company/">Hemmi Slide Rule Co., Ltd.</a>, proudly displaying their illustrious heritage.</p>

<p><strong><em>Keuffel &amp; Esser (US)</em></strong>—Keuffel &amp; Esser (K&amp;E) were the most successful manufacturer of quality slide rules in America. They were founded in 1867 by a pair of German immigrants. Initially, they only imported German slide rules. But soon, they began designing and making their own slide rules. K&amp;E were <a href="https://www.mccoys-kecatalogs.com/KEPatents/KEPatents.htm">quite innovative</a>. The duplex design was one of theirs, invented for them by William Cox in 1895. Their signature material was mahogany. Mahogany is a good material for slide rule, but it is neither as robust nor as stable as bamboo. K&amp;E also made several plastic rules, but their plastic is of a much lower grade, compared to the European plastics.</p>

<p><strong><em>Kontrolpribor (RU)</em></strong>—Kontrolpribor was a Soviet factory that made pocket watch slide rules. Like other Soviet products, Kontrolpribor devices feel cheap, but sturdy. Today, <a href="https://www.kontrolpribor.ru/en/">Kontrolpribor</a> make high-tech scientific instruments.</p>

<p><strong><em>Loga (CH)</em></strong>—Loga were a Swiss maker of superb technical instruments, including circular and cylindrical slide rules. They were founded in the early 20th century. Until about the late 19th century, Switzerland was the home of cheap, high-quality craftsmen. French, German, and English watchmakers relied extensively on the highly skilled Swiss labour force to hand-make their high-end watches. That was how the modern Swiss watch industry was born. So, it is no surprise that 20th century Swiss slide rules exhibit similar craftsmanship.</p>

<p><strong><em>Logarex (CZ)</em></strong>—Logarex was a factory in Czechoslovakia, when the country was part of the old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Bloc">Eastern Bloc</a>. Like most everything manufactured in the Eastern Bloc countries during the Soviet Era, Logarex slide rules feel cheap, but usable.</p>

<p><strong><em>Nestler (DE)</em></strong>—Nestler were a German maker of high-quality slide rules. They were established in 1878. Their mahogany rules were the stuff of legend. Even their very old wood rules from the early 20th century have a modern, minimalist look-and-feel to them. Of all the German brands, Nestler is my favourite.</p>

<p><strong><em>Otis King (UK)</em></strong>—Otis King was an English electrical engineer. His company made high-quality pocket cylindrical rules, starting around 1922. They made only two types—the Model K and the Model L—both of which are described, below. And despite being designed by an electrical engineer, these rules are not suitable for daily use in engineering, given their limited capabilities. The focus of these rules is on portability and precision, the two characteristics treasured by businessmen.</p>

<p><strong><em>Pickett &amp; Eckel (US)</em></strong>—Pickett, established in 1943, were a newcomer to the American slide rule market. Their signature material was aluminium. And most of their rules wore their trade-dress, the Pickett Eye-Saver Yellow. To be honest, I detest the cold, sharp edges of the aluminium and the gaudy eye-slayer yellow. But loads of American engineers fancied Pickett rules. Not withstanding my opinion, this slide rule is a solid performer. Aluminium is thermally much more stable than wood. And it is well-neigh indestructible. Nevertheless, Pickett aluminium rules feel cheap to me—my apologies to NASA who, for their Apollo missions, chose the <a href="https://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/search/object/nmah_694174">Pickett N600-ES</a>, a pared-down, pocket version of the popular Pickett N3-ES.</p>

<p><strong><em>Frederick Post (US)</em></strong>—Frederick Post were an American importer of top-quality Hemmi bamboo rules. These bamboo rules were sold under the Post brand in America. Frederick Post morphed into Teledyne Post in 1970, and continued making drafting supplies until they were dissolved in 1992.</p>

<p><strong><em>Reiss (DE)</em></strong>—Reiss were a German slide rule maker, established in 1882. During the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War">Cold War</a>, it diminished to a Soviet-style factory in East Germany. But unlike their fellow Eastern Bloc countrymen, the East Germans staunchly clung on to their German culture that held craftsmanship in high regard. As such, Reiss rules are good quality instruments, comparable to Western European brands.</p>

<h2 id="straight-rules-1"><em>straight rules</em></h2>

<h4 id="aristo-de">Aristo (DE)</h4>

<p><strong><em>Aristo 967 U Darmstadt</em></strong>—The Aristo 967 U is a late-model, advanced Darmstadt slide rule. Unlike the older Darmstadt rules, the backside of Aristo 967 U is clear plastic, which allows the user to see the entire backside of the slide which, in keeping with the Darmstadt tradition, holds the $L$ scale and the three $LL_n$ scales. And in accordance with that tradition, this slide rule is of a simplex design. As such, the cursor does not reach the backside; the backside scales are read against the fixed red hairlines at each end. Typical of all Aristo slide rules, the frame, the slide, and the cursor are made of a very high-grade plastic, allowing all these bits to glide smoothly.</p>

<p><img src="https://amenzwa.github.io/stem/figures/SlideRules/Aristo967U/DSC00162.JPG" alt="Aristo 967 U"></p>

<p><img src="https://amenzwa.github.io/stem/figures/SlideRules/Aristo967U/DSC00163.JPG" alt="Aristo 967 U"></p>

<p>Many late-model, plastic Darmstadt rules, like the Aristo 967 U, have thin lips protruding from the frame, often marked with 25-cm and 10-in ruler scales. Unfortunately, the corners of these lips are rather fragile. These corners chipped off, if the slide rule was dropped. Pay attention to this type of damage, when purchasing a plastic Darmstadt.</p>

<p>Frankly, I fail to see the value of inscribing ruler scales on a slide rule. All engineers use the <a href="https://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/search/object/nmah_692472">triangular rule</a> for measuring and drafting. This ruler is always on our desks. And on the very first day in engineering school, we were taught never to use the slide rule—a precision instrument—like a common ruler. So, putting ruler scales on a slide rule is simply wasting precious real estate.</p>

<p><strong><em>Aristo 0968 Studio</em></strong>—The Aristo 0968 is an ordinary log-log duplex engineering straight rule, like the K&amp;E 4081-3. But this slide rule is about half a centimetre wider than the slender K&amp;E 4081-3. This extra space affords a couple of extra scales and a more logical scale layout. The Aristo 0968 has the Pythagorean $P$ scale for computing $1 - x^2$ and two $tan$ scales $T_1\ [5.5°, 45°]$ and $T_2\ [45°, 84.5°]$, which the K&amp;E 4081-3 does not have. And all three pairs of $LL$ scales are placed on the backside, making it a much more convenient rule to use for exponentiation—a good trait for an engineering rule. Indeed, usability is the hallmark of European and Asian slide rules; this is the area in which American slide rules falter.</p>

<p><img src="https://amenzwa.github.io/stem/figures/SlideRules/Aristo0968/DSC00188.JPG" alt="Aristo 0968"></p>

<p><img src="https://amenzwa.github.io/stem/figures/SlideRules/Aristo0968/DSC00189.JPG" alt="Aristo 0968"></p>

<p>This Aristo 0968 was my first slide rule, purchased from the government store in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myanmar">Burma</a>, circa 1982, upon my arrival at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangon_Technological_University">engineering college</a>, then the only one of its kind in the country.</p>

<p><strong><em>Aristo 0969 StudioLog</em></strong>—The Arist 0969 is a top-of-the-line engineering duplex slide rule, with four pairs of $LL$ scales, $P$ scale, extended trigonometric scales, etc. In terms of capabilities, it is identical to its more famous competitor, the FC 2/83 N. But being half centimetre or so wider, the Aristo 0969 is a monster of a slide rule. This extra real estate allows a bit of extra spacing between the scales, arguably making them easier to read.</p>

<p><img src="https://amenzwa.github.io/stem/figures/SlideRules/Aristo0969/DSC00190.JPG" alt="Aristo 0969"></p>

<p><img src="https://amenzwa.github.io/stem/figures/SlideRules/Aristo0969/DSC00191.JPG" alt="Aristo 0969"></p>

<p>I think the excessive girth of the Aristo 0969 makes it awkward to flip. It is not one of my favourites.</p>

<h4 id="blundell-harling-uk">Blundell-Harling (UK)</h4>

<p><strong><em>BRL D.26 Darmstadt</em></strong>—The BRL D.26 is a late model Darmstadt. In terms of capabilities, the BRL D.26 is comparable to its contemporary, the Aristo 0967 U. But this English rule’s build quality is obviously superior to that of its German competitor. The backside of the BRL D.26 sports the traditional cutout for reading the three $LL_n$ scales.</p>

<p><img src="https://amenzwa.github.io/stem/figures/SlideRules/BRLD26/DSC00164.JPG" alt="BRL D.26"></p>

<p><img src="https://amenzwa.github.io/stem/figures/SlideRules/BRLD26/DSC00165.JPG" alt="BRL D.26"></p>

<p>I like the BRL D.26, not only for its Darmstadt design, but also because of its superior quality and its quiet elegance.</p>

<h4 id="faber-castell-de">Faber-Castell (DE)</h4>

<p><strong><em>FC 1/54 Darmstadt</em></strong>—I rather like the sensible scale layout of the FC 1/54. The back of the slide has the usual three $LL_n$ scales, which are read through the cutouts covered with hairline-inscribed clear plastic. Being of a classic German simplex design, this rule is narrow, but quite thick, compared to modern duplex rules. This thickness gives enough space to the top and bottom edges of the frame for additional scales. The top edge has the 27-cm ruler scale and the $L$ scale, and the bottom edge has the $S$ and the $T$ trigonometric scales.</p>

<p><img src="https://amenzwa.github.io/stem/figures/SlideRules/FC1-54/DSC00158.JPG" alt="FC 1/54"></p>

<p><img src="https://amenzwa.github.io/stem/figures/SlideRules/FC1-54/DSC00159.JPG" alt="FC 1/54"></p>

<p>As I stated earlier, I adore Darmstadt rules. The FC 1/54 is one of my favourite Darmstadt rules. But it is not my absolute favourite Darmstadt rule. Which rule is my absolute favourite? Read on.</p>

<p><strong><em>FC 67/64 R Pocket Darmstadt mit Addiator</em></strong>—The FC 67/64 R is a Darmstadt pocket straight rule of about 15 cm in length. Being a Darmstadt rule, the backside of the slide has the usual three $LL_n$ scales. But instead of the traditional cutouts, the backside of the slide rule is occupied by a metal Addiator. As such, the only way to use the $LL_n$ scales is to flip the slide round to the front.</p>

<p><img src="https://amenzwa.github.io/stem/figures/SlideRules/FC67-64R/DSC00139.JPG" alt="FC 67/64 R front"></p>

<p><img src="https://amenzwa.github.io/stem/figures/SlideRules/FC67-64R/DSC00140.JPG" alt="FC 67/64 R back"></p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addiator">Addiator</a> is a clever little contraption capable of performing addition and subtraction. The device must be reset before each operation by pulling out the bar at the top. The Addiator on the backside of this slide rule is capable of dealing with six significant figures. The operand is entered by dragging with the provided stylus a slot next to the desired digit in the appropriate column. When adding, both augend and addend are set in the upper register. When subtracting, the minuend is set in the upper register and the subtrahend in the lower register. The way the Addiator handles the carry is particularly clever. The mechanisms of this device work on similar principles as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_calculator">mechanical calculator</a>. But the Addiator is only 1 mm thick and fits neatly behind a pocket slide rule. Given that this is an article about slide rules, however, I shall say no more about this fascinating instrument. The curious may view <a href="https://youtu.be/iz3ecu25gls">YouTube videos</a> on the subject.</p>

<p>The Addiator does make the backside of the FC 67/64 R’s slide inaccessible. But considering the computation power afforded by the Addiator, this may well be a worthwhile compromise in some applications. I purchased this FC 67/64 R, new, straight from the Faber-Castell online store, many years ago.</p>

<p><strong><em>FC 1/98 Elektro</em></strong>—The FC 1/98 is an advanced Darmstadt rule designed for electrical power engineers (as opposed to electronic engineers). It is of the classic German simplex design—narrow and thick. As such, it has specialised scales, like the $kW$ scale for computing power $P$, the $Dynamo$-$Motor$ scale for computing percent power efficiency ($η = P_{out} / P_{in}$) of generators and motors, and the $Volt$ scale for computing voltage drop along copper wires. Note that the term “dynamo” was an older name for generator, and motor is the dual of generator. The $Dynamo$-$Motor$ scale and the $Volt$ scale are engraved in the trough of the frame, under the slide. That is a creative use of the limited space. The frame holds the $LL_2$ and $LL_3$, but no $LL_1$. The bottom edge of the frame holds the $K$ scale. The backside of the slide holds the $S$, $L$, and $T$ Mannheim scales, which are read through the traditional, offset cutouts without clear plastic covers. So, the FC 1/98 is a rather unique rule that combines Mannheim, Darmstadt, and electrical engineering scales.</p>

<p><img src="https://amenzwa.github.io/stem/figures/SlideRules/FC1-98/DSC00160.JPG" alt="FC 1/98"></p>

<p><img src="https://amenzwa.github.io/stem/figures/SlideRules/FC1-98/DSC00161.JPG" alt="FC 1/98"></p>

<p>The FC 1/98 is, for sure, a speciality slide rule for electrical engineers. But it is general enough to qualify as a Darmstadt-ish engineering rule. And its space-efficient scale layout deserves recognition. As such, I chose to include it in this article. But I did leave out other speciality engineering rules in my collection—transmission line Smith chart, electronic engineering rule, mechanical engineering rule, chemical engineering rule, E-6B navigation rule, etc.—because they are too far afield from the primary purpose of this article.</p>

<p><strong><em>FC 2/83 N Novo-Duplex</em></strong>—The FC 2/83 N is famous both for its evident usability as well as for its elegant beauty. Yes, contrary to the prevailing view, we engineers do appreciate aesthetics. The FC 2/83 N uses pale green backgrounds for $C$ and $CF$ on the frontside and $C$ and $D$ on the backside. It uses pale blue backgrounds for $A$ and $B$ on the frontside. In my opinion—and this view sprang from my experience with human factors in user interface design—FC 2/83 N’s colour-coded scale backgrounds are a better design choice than the Aristo 0969’s spread-out scales. And the FC 2/83 N has on the backside the $W_1$-$W^{‘}_1$ and $W_2$-$W^{‘}_2$ extended square root scales, which the Aristo 0969 lacks. That is impressive, considering the Aristo 0969 is a good half-centimetre wider than the FC 2/83 N. Also, as can be seen in the photograph below, the FC 2/83 N’s slide has black grooves at its tips. These striations make it easier to pull out the slide from its stowed position. Little things like this make big differences in usability and convenience, especially when operating under time pressure—like in an examination.</p>

<p><img src="https://amenzwa.github.io/stem/figures/SlideRules/FC2-83N/DSC00194.JPG" alt="FC 2/83 N"></p>

<p><img src="https://amenzwa.github.io/stem/figures/SlideRules/FC2-83N/DSC00195.JPG" alt="FC 2/83 N"></p>

<p>I would like to draw attention to the fact that the 1970s were, how shall I say it tactfully, “unique” in terms of <a href="https://flashbak.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Vincent.jpg">design taste</a>. All right, they were loud, they were excessive. In that era of paisleys and bell-bottoms, German slide rule design—typified by the Aristo 0969, the FC 2/83 N, and the Nestler 0292—managed to remain tastefully restrained. I purchased this FC 2/83 N, new, straight from the Faber-Castell online store, many years ago.</p>

<h4 id="graphoplex-fr">Graphoplex (FR)</h4>

<p><strong><em>Graphoplex 643 Pocket Electric Log Log</em></strong>—The Graphoplex 643 is an advanced pocket rule. Of all my pocket rules—which I have but a few, due to my poor eyesight—I find this one the easiest to read. This pocket rule is a miniature version of the Graphoplex 640. See the full description in the Graphoplex 640 subsection, below.</p>

<p><img src="https://amenzwa.github.io/stem/figures/SlideRules/Graphoplex643/DSC00141.JPG" alt="Graphoplex 643"></p>

<p><img src="https://amenzwa.github.io/stem/figures/SlideRules/Graphoplex643/DSC00142.JPG" alt="Graphoplex 643"></p>

<p><strong><em>Graphoplex 640 Electric Log Log</em></strong>—The Graphoplex 640 is another topping Darmstadt rule, like the BRL D.26. But breaking from the Darmstadt tradition, the Graphoplex 640 places the three $LL_n$ scales on the frontside, on the lower frame. And the backside of the slide holds the trigonometric scales and the $C$ scale, which are read through a single cutout on the right side of the rule. The cutout has a clear plastic cover with a hairline, which makes it easy to read all four scales on the backside of the slide. But having only one cutout makes it cumbersome to read the left-hand portions of these scales. The Graphoplex 640 places the three $LL_n$ scales together with the $D$ and $C$ scales. This arrangement significantly improves usability by reducing the need frequently to flip the slide rule when computing exponentiations.</p>

<p><img src="https://amenzwa.github.io/stem/figures/SlideRules/Graphoplex640/DSC00166.JPG" alt="Graphoplex 640"></p>

<p><img src="https://amenzwa.github.io/stem/figures/SlideRules/Graphoplex640/DSC00167.JPG" alt="Graphoplex 640"></p>

<p>The Graphoplex 643 and the Graphoplex 640 were marketed as speciality electrical engineering slide rules. But they are fairly conventional Darmstadt rules. I like these rules very much. Yet, they are not my absolute favourite Darmstadt rules. Read on, to find out which one is my absolute favourite Darmstadt engineering slide rule.</p>

<h4 id="hemmi-jp">Hemmi (JP)</h4>

<p><strong><em>Hemmi 135 Pocket Advanced Darmstadt</em></strong>—The Hemmi 135 pocket rule is a marvel: it is a miniature version of the Hemmi 130W, an advanced Darmstadt rule, except for a minor difference with the $LL_n$ scales on the backside of the slide. Whereas the Hemmi 130W has four $LL_n$ scales, the Hemmi 135 has only three, given its diminutive size. See the full description in the Hemmi 130W subsection, below.</p>

<p><img src="https://amenzwa.github.io/stem/figures/SlideRules/Hemmi135/DSC00137.JPG" alt="Hemmi 135"></p>

<p><img src="https://amenzwa.github.io/stem/figures/SlideRules/Hemmi135/DSC00138.JPG" alt="Hemmi 135"></p>

<p><strong><em>Hemmi 130W Advanced Darmstadt</em></strong>—The Hemmi 130W is my absolute favourite Darmstadt rule. There, I said it. I would very much like to have owned this rule, when I was a young engineering student those many years ago. As with all Hemmi slide rules, this rule is made of bamboo, my favourite slide rule material. The $S$, $T$, and $P$ scales, along with the usual ones, are on the frontside. Traditional Darmstadt rules have only $LL_1$, $LL_2$, and $LL_3$ on the backside of the slide. But the Hemmi 130W’s slide has four $LL_n$ scales: $LL_0$, $LL_1$, $LL_2$, and $LL_3$. This makes this slide rule one of the most powerful Darmstadt simplex rules. The $L$ and the $LL_n$ scales are read through large cutouts at each end. The plastic cover of each cutout is inscribed with a fixed red hairline for reading the scales.</p>

<p><img src="https://amenzwa.github.io/stem/figures/SlideRules/Hemmi130W/DSC00168.JPG" alt="Hemmi 130W"></p>

<p><img src="https://amenzwa.github.io/stem/figures/SlideRules/Hemmi130W/DSC00169.JPG" alt="Hemmi 130W"></p>

<p>I adore Darmstadt rules. I said so, often. And of all the Darmstadt rules I own, I love the Hemmi 130W the most. Yet, I think Hemmi missed an opportunity with the way they used the real estate of the top and bottom edges of the frame. Typical of Hemmi simplex rules, this one is fairly thick. The top edge of the frame holds a vapid 27-cm ruler and the bottom edge holds an odd zero-centred 26-cm ruler with 13-cm linear scales crawling out to each end. Hemmi should, instead, have inscribed more useful scales, like the $ST$ scale or the split $T_1$-$T_2$ scales, on the frame edges.</p>

<p><strong><em>Hemmi 153 Electrical Engineer</em></strong>—The Hemmi 153 is a log-log vector duplex rule cherished by electrical power engineers. In terms of capabilities, this slide rule is comparable to the more famous K&amp;E 4083-3 described below in the K&amp;E section. But the Hemmi 153 computes the hyperbolic functions in a rather unique and ingenious way, using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gudermannian_function">Gudermannian function</a>, introduced in 1833 by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christoph_Gudermann">Christoph Gudermann</a>, a German mathematician:</p>

<p>
$$
gd(x) = sin^{-1}(tanh(x)) = tan^{-1}(sinh(x))
$$
</p>

<p>The function $gd$, thus, relates trigonometric functions with hyperbolic functions as follows:</p>

<p>
$$
\begin{align}
sin(gd(x)) &amp;= tanh(x) \nonumber \\
cos(gd(x)) &amp;= sech(x) \nonumber \\
tan(gd(x)) &amp;= sinh(x) \nonumber \\
cot(gd(x)) &amp;= csch(x) \nonumber \\
sec(gd(x)) &amp;= cosh(x) \nonumber \\
csc(gd(x)) &amp;= coth(x) \nonumber
\end{align}
$$
</p>

<p>The backside of the Hemmi 153 has the $\theta$ angle scale in the range $[0°, 90°]$, the $P$ scale for computing $sin$, and the $Q$ scale for computing $cos$. The frontside has the $T$ scale for computing $tan$ and the $G_\theta$ scale for computing $gd(x)$. Using the $G_\theta$ scale and the $P$, $Q$, and $T$ scales of the Hemmi 153, we can compute all the hyperbolic functions. The $G_\theta$ scale, thus, expands the power of this slide rule by using the real estate for just one extra scale. I am of the opinion that the Hemmi 153 is one of those rare inventions that attained the design ideal of pragmatic minimalism.</p>

<p><img src="https://amenzwa.github.io/stem/figures/SlideRules/Hemmi153/DSC00184.JPG" alt="Hemmi 153"></p>

<p><img src="https://amenzwa.github.io/stem/figures/SlideRules/Hemmi153/DSC00185.JPG" alt="Hemmi 153"></p>

<p>To compute $sin(30°)$, we manipulate the slide rule as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>$\theta$—Place the hairline on the <em>argument</em> $30°$ on the $\theta$ scale.</li>
  <li>$P$—Read under the hairline the <em>result</em> $0.5$ on the $P$ scale. This computes $sin(30°) = 0.5$.</li>
</ul>

<p>To compute $cos(60°)$, we manipulate the slide rule as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>$\theta$—Place the hairline on the <em>argument</em> $60°$ on the $\theta$ scale.</li>
  <li>$Q$—Slide the left-hand $0$ on the $Q$ scale under the hairline.</li>
  <li>$P$—Place the hairline on the right-hand $1$ of the $P$ scale.</li>
  <li>$Q$—Read under the hairline the <em>result</em> $0.5$ on the $Q$ scale. This computes $cos(60°) = 0.5$.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note the asymmetry between the $sin$ and $cos$ procedures, above. This is a consequence of the $P$ and $Q$ scales’ dual-use design: they are used to compute Pythagorean, but they also double as the $sin$ and $cos$ scales. It is, therefore, faster to compute $cos(60°)$ as $sin(90° - 60°)$.</p>

<p>Now, the cleverer bit: computing hyperbolic functions without various hyperbolic scales. To compute $sinh(0.5)$ using the identity $tan(gd(x)) = sinh(x)$ mentioned above, we manipulate the slide rule as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>$G_\theta$—Place the hairline on the <em>argument</em> $0.5$ on the $G_\theta$ scale. This computes $gd(0.5)$.</li>
  <li>$T$—Read under the hairline the <em>result</em> $0.521$ on the $T$ scale. This computes $sinh(0.5) = tan(gd(0.5)) = 0.521$.</li>
</ul>

<p>To compute $tanh(0.5)$ using the identity $sin(gd(x)) = tanh(x)$ mentioned above, we manipulate the slide rule as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>$G_\theta$—Place the hairline on the <em>argument</em> $0.5$ on the $G_\theta$ scale. This computes $gd(0.5)$.</li>
  <li>$P$—Read under the hairline the <em>result</em> $0.462$ on the $P$ scale. This computes $tanh(0.5) = sin(gd(0.5)) = 0.462$.</li>
</ul>

<p>When using the $T$ scale on the Hemmi 153 where the angle $\theta$ scale goes all the way up to $90°$, it is important to recall that $tan(90°) = ∞$.</p>

<p>The Hemmi 153 is marketed as a speciality electrical engineering slide rule. But it would be a crime not to include it in this article, due to its innovative $G_\theta$ scale-based hyperbolic function computations.</p>

<p><strong><em>Hemmi 255D Expert Electrical Engineer</em></strong>—As the name suggests the Hemmi 255D is a newer, more advanced electrical engineering log-log vector duplex rule, compared to the older Hemmi 153. But whereas the Hemmi 153 uses the ingenious, but unconventional, $G_\theta$ scale to compute the hyperbolic functions via the trigonometric functions, the Hemmi 255D employs the more direct way to compute hyperbolic functions via the conventional $Sh$ and $Th$ scales. In terms of capabilities, the Hemmi 255D is comparable to other log-log vector duplex rules, like the Pickett N4-ES.</p>

<p>The Hemmi 255D is definitely a speciality electrical engineering rule. But it is also a general engineering vector slide rule, in the same category as the famous K&amp;E 4083-3. So, I chose to include it in this article.</p>

<p><strong><em>K&amp;E 4181-1 Pocket Log Log Duplex Decitrig</em></strong>—The K&amp;E 4181-1 is a miniature version of the K&amp;E 4081-3. But whereas the K&amp;E 4081-3 is made of wood, the K&amp;E 4181-1 is made of plastic. And unlike the European plastics, the plastic of this slide rule feels cheap. See the full description in the K&amp;E 4081-3 subsection, below.</p>

<p><strong><em>K&amp;E 4081-3 Log Log Duplex Decitrig</em></strong>—The K&amp;E 4081-3 is the quintessential engineering slide rule. Its design is old and basic, but its implementation good and enduring. In a way, the K&amp;E 4081-3 is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Model_T">Ford Model T</a> of engineering slide rules. It does have a few usability quirks, such as the $LL_1$ and $LL_{01}$ being relegated to the backside. But such compromises are inevitable, given the compactness of this slide rule.</p>

<p>This slide rule was the most popular slide rule in America. Although it is a very good slide rule, the wood core is easily damaged, when mistreated. And because they were inexpensive, many owners abused them. As such, many K&amp;E 4081-3 slide rules being sold on eBay are warped, and hence are useless. Good ones do pop up every so often; so, be patient. The same admonishment applies to all wood rules, especially the very old ones made in the early 20th century or before.</p>

<p><strong><em>K&amp;E 68-1100 Deci-Lon 10</em></strong>—The K&amp;E 68-1100 is one of the last, and most refined, engineering slide rules from K&amp;E, designed to compete with late model German slide rules: Aristo 0969, FC 2/83 N, and Nester 0292. And like other newer K&amp;E rules, the K&amp;E 68-1100 is made of plastic that is on the cheap side, compared to the European plastics.</p>

<p>The odd feature of this slide rule is the asymmetric design: the lower frame is very narrow, the slide is quite wide, and the upper frame is unusually wide. The wide upper frame allows all four $LL_{0n}$ scales to fit on the frontside and on the backside all four $LL_n$ scales. This scale layout is much more convenient to use. But to those of us who are used to the common, symmetric design, the lopsided frame feels awkward in the hands. Many collectors admire this advanced engineering rule, but I am no fan of it.</p>

<p><strong><em>K&amp;E 4083-3 Log Log Duplex Vector</em></strong>—Hyperbolic functions are complex domain analogues of real domain trigonometric functions. Whereas <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometric_functions">trigonometric functions</a> are defined using the unit circle, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_functions">hyperbolic functions</a> are defined using the hyperbola. Hyperbolic functions are popular with mechanical and civil engineers, who use it to compute the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catenary">catenary</a> of chains (or, heavy-duty power transmission lines)—the sag that results when hanging a chain of a certain length from two equal-height posts.</p>

<p><img src="https://amenzwa.github.io/stem/figures/SlideRules/catenary.jpg" alt="catenary"></p>

<p>The length and sag of a chain hung from two posts of equal height is expressed thus:</p>

<p>
$$
\begin{align}
l &amp;= 2 \frac{H}{w} sinh(\frac{wb}{H}) \nonumber \\
s &amp;= \frac{H}{w} [cosh(\frac{wb}{H}) - 1] \nonumber
\end{align}
$$
</p>

<p>Here, $l$ is the length of the chain, $s$ is the sag, $w$ is the weight per unit length, $H$ is the tension at the lowest point, and $2b$ is the distance between the two posts. By the way, the world-famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gateway_Arch">Gateway Arch</a> in St. Louis, Missouri, is a catenary arch, an inverted catenary curve.</p>

<p>Electrical power engineers use hyperbolic functions to compute impedances (and hence, voltages and currents, by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm's_law">Ohm’s law</a>) on long-distant power transmission lines that stretch several hundred kilometres. Electrical engineers model the impedance of a long transmission line using the <a href="http://www.egr.unlv.edu/~eebag/TRANSMISSION%20LINES.pdf">$\pi$ model</a>, which represents the long cable as a series connection of short, individual segments, like a long chain made of small, individual links.</p>

<p>The K&amp;E 4083-3 vector rule was one of the earliest advanced engineering slide rules with hyperbolic sine $Sh$ and hyperbolic tangent $Th$ scales. Electrical power engineering deals with electric motors, transmission lines, etc., and much of the work in this discipline involves <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_calculus">vector calculus</a>. The “vector” designation of the K&amp;E 4083-3 probably traces its origin to electrical power engineers’ obsession with vector calculus and hyperbolic slide rules.</p>

<p>Catenary of chain and impedance of power line can be computed using the $C$, $D$, $CI$, $DI$, and other arithmetic scales in combination with $Sh$ and $Th$ hyperbolic scales, like those on the backside of the K&amp;E 4083-3 vector rule.</p>

<p>However, since <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_functions">hyperbolic functions</a> are related to exponential functions, an ordinary log-log duplex slide rule, like the K&amp;E 4081-3, can compute hyperbolic functions using the following identities and the $LL$ scales, albeit rather tediously:</p>

<p>
$$
\begin{align}
sinh(x) &amp;= \frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{2} \nonumber \\
cosh(x) &amp;= \frac{e^x + e^{-x}}{2} \nonumber \\
tanh(x) &amp;= \frac{sinh(x)}{cosh(x)} = \frac{e^{2x}-1}{e^{2x}+1} \nonumber \\
coth(x) &amp;= \frac{cosh(x)}{sinh(x)} \nonumber \\
sech(x) &amp;= \frac{1}{cosh(x)} \nonumber \\
csch(x) &amp;= \frac{1}{sinh(x)} \nonumber
\end{align}
$$
</p>

<p>In the plot below, the blue curve is $sinh$, the green is $cosh$, and the red is $tanh$.</p>

<h4 id="logarex-cz">Logarex (CZ)</h4>

<p><strong><em>Logarex 27403-X Darmstadt</em></strong>—The Logarex 27403-X is a late model, simplex Darmstadt, with traditional Darmstadt scales on the frontside and three $LL_n$ scales on the backside of the slide. But whereas a traditional Darmstadt rule has a closed backside and cutouts at each end for reading the $LL_n$ scales, the backside of the Logarex 27403-X is open like a duplex rule and there are no cutouts with red indices. The black indices at each end of the frame permit reading only the $LL_1$ and $LL_3$ scales. But there is no way to read the $LL_2$ scale in the middle of the slide. The only way to use the $LL_n$ scales effectively is to flip the slide round to the front.</p>

<p><img src="https://amenzwa.github.io/stem/figures/SlideRules/Logarex27403X/DSC00170.JPG" alt="Logarex 27403-X"></p>

<p><img src="https://amenzwa.github.io/stem/figures/SlideRules/Logarex27403X/DSC00171.JPG" alt="Logarex 27403-X"></p>

<p>Flipping the backside of the slide round to the front is a common practice when using older Mannheim and Darmstadt rules. But it amounts to a design blunder on a modern duplex rule like the Logarex 27403-X. Of course, one could use a straight edge of a ruler or a piece of paper as a makeshift index for reading the $LL_2$ scale in the middle of the slide. The overall quality of the Logarex 27403-X is quite horrid: its plastic is about as good as a cheap soap dish.</p>

<h4 id="nestler-de">Nestler (DE)</h4>

<p><strong><em>Nestler 23 R/3 Rietz</em></strong>—The Nestler 23 R was favoured by very illustrious scientists and engineers, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein">Albert Einstein</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wernher_von_Braun">Wernher von Braun</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Korolev">Sergei Korolev</a>. It is a conventional Rietz rule with a traditional Rietz scale layout. Perhaps it was this simplicity that attracted these greatest scientific minds of the 20th century.</p>

<p><img src="https://amenzwa.github.io/stem/figures/SlideRules/Nestler23R/DSC00152.JPG" alt="Nestler 23 R"></p>

<p>Despite the fact that the Nestler 23 R is well loved, there is something subversively quirky about this slide rule. Being of the classic German simplex design, this slide rule is thick enough to have space on the top and bottom edges of the frame for additional scales. The Nestler 23 R has a 27-cm ruler scale on the top edge of the frame and the bottom edge of the frame is either blank or has a $1:25$ scale. The $1:25$ scale is 27.2 cm in length, and is divided linearly into 4-cm divisions. The name for this scale hints at $4 × 25 = 100$ cm, or 1 m. I do not think ruler scales belong on a slide rule; a slide rule is a fine instrument, not a common ruler.</p>

<p><strong><em>Nestler 0210 Darmstadt</em></strong>—This slide rule is powerful in a minimalistic sort of way. The backside of the slide has the three $LL_n$ scales typical of Darmstadt rules, which are read through clear-plastic-covered cutouts. And given its classic German simplex proportions, the thick edges sport more scales. The top edge of the frame holds the 27-cm ruler scale and the $L$ scale. The bottom edge of the frame holds the $S$ and $T$ scales. This design is practical, logical, and compact. Of all the Nestler slide rules I own, the Nestler 0210 is my favourite.</p>

<p><strong><em>Nestler 0292 Multimath-Duplex</em></strong>—I like the appearance of Nestler slide rules for their understated elegance. Being a late model advanced log-log duplex engineering rule, the Nestler 0292 possesses the same computing capabilities as the top-of-the-line models from other manufacturers: Aristo 0969, FC 2/83 N, K&amp;E 68-1100, Pickett N3-ES, et al. In my view, the Nester 0292 beats them all in both usability and beauty. No offence intended to those who admire the FC 2/83 N’s looks; indeed, I like that slide rule very well, only not as much as I like the Nestler 0292. Whereas the FC 2/83 N advertises its power, the Nestler 0292 expresses its power quietly. It is appreciably slimmer than the FC 2/83 N, so it feels more comfortable in the hand, especially for those of us who grew up on smaller rules, like the Aristo 0968. And it employs only one background colour, the pale green background, which covers both sides of the slide. I am of the opinion that the Nestler 0292 is an embodiment of the philosophy of engineering: elegant simplicity, effortless efficiency, quiet power.</p>

<h4 id="pickett--eckel-us">Pickett &amp; Eckel (US)</h4>

<p><strong><em>Pickett N3-ES Power Log Exponential</em></strong>—The Pickett N3-ES is a late model log-log duplex engineering slide rule. Being constructed of aluminium, it is stabler and tougher than wood rules. Like its competitors, it has eight $LL$ scales. Pickett cleverly stacked the $LL_n$ and $LL_{0n}$ scales on the same line—$LL_0$-$LL_{00}$ stack, $LL_1$-$LL_{01}$ stack, and so on—thus yielding a logical, compact scale layout. But some may argue that stacked scales are more difficult to read. To each his own.</p>

<p><img src="https://amenzwa.github.io/stem/figures/SlideRules/PickettN3ES/DSC00196.JPG" alt="Pickett N3-ES"></p>

<p><img src="https://amenzwa.github.io/stem/figures/SlideRules/PickettN3ES/DSC00197.JPG" alt="Pickett N3-ES"></p>

<p>I quite like this stacked $LL$ scales layout. But I cannot countenance the economy feel and the impertinent colour of this slide rule. And it is significantly wider and weightier, compared to the late model German log-log duplex rules. In sum, the Pickett N3-ES is cheap and bulky, but stout and reliable.</p>

<p><strong><em>Pickett N4-ES Vector Log Log Dual-Based Speed Rule</em></strong>—The Pickett N4-ES is the vectorised version of the Pickett N3-ES. As such, the Pickett N4-ES adds the hyperbolic $Sh$ and $Th$ scales. It is peculiar, though, that this slide rule labels its $LL$ scales from $LL_1$-$LL_{01}$ to $LL_4$-$LL_{04}$, instead of employing the more conventional scheme, which goes from $LL_0$-$LL_{00}$ to $LL_3$-$LL_{03}$. I dislike this slide rule, too.</p>

<p><strong><em>Post 1447 Mannheim</em></strong>—The Post 1447 was an honest slide rule fit for innocent high schoolers of the day. It is of the traditional Mannheim simplex design. It has the usual $A$, $B$, $CI$, $C$, $D$, and $K$ scales on the frontside. The $S$, $L$, and $T$ scales are on the backside of the slide, which are read through the clear-plastic-covered cutouts on the backside of the frame.</p>

<p><strong><em>Post 1460 Versalog II</em></strong>—The Post 1460 is a direct competitor, albeit a more refined one, to the K&amp;E 4081-3 log-log duplex engineering slide rule. But in my view, the Post 1460 is superior, in terms of appearance, feel, durability, and usability. And it has four black-red pairs of $LL$ scales and the $R_1$-$R_2$ extended $\sqrt{x}$ scales. The Versalog II has a green $cos$ scale, but the original Versalog has a dark blue $cos$ scale.</p>

<p>My only objection to the design of the Post 1460 is its rather sharp edges. The rounded edges of the K&amp;E 4081-3 feel more comfortable.</p>

<p><strong><em>Reiss Darmstadt</em></strong>—This slide rule is a traditional Darmstadt rule, but it is made of aluminium. In terms of quality, this slide rule is as good as any European model, and is much better made than the Pickett aluminium rules. But it is quite solid; it weights almost as much as the Pickett N3-ES, despite being much slimmer. Because it is rather slim, the Reiss Darmstadt rule is more comfortable to handle. Still, I dislike its cold, sharp construction.</p>

Its duplex design breaks with the Darmstadt tradition. But in keeping with the Darmstadt tradition, the backside of its slide has three $LL_n$ scales, and the frame is not adjustable. The Reiss 3214 is a decent plastic slide rule.</p>

The $C$ scale is engraved on the rotating bezel and the $D$ scale is fixed to the watch face. The watch face also has indices for kph to mph conversion and nautical mile to statute mile conversion. As per the Navitimer tradition, this watch incorporates the chronograph function. And it adds the 24-hour sub-dial, and a complete calendar with day, date, and month indicators. The label “Datora” refers to this complete-calendar feature. And the label “Montbrillant” was a <a href="https://www.breitling.com/gb-en/history/part-3">historical designation</a> Breitling applied to some of their watch dials during the early 1920s.</p>

<p><strong><em>Concise Model 300</em></strong>—The Concise 300 is a low-cost, compact, duplex circular rule. It uses pared-down Darmstadt scales, providing only $LL_2$ and $LL_3$. But it provides two $tan$ scales, $T_1$ and $T_2$. In terms of computing power, this slide rule is as capable as the FC 1/98 except, of course, it does not have the electrical engineering scales. The Concise 300 is held with the $1$ index mark pointing up, and is flipped left-to-right. For its price, this is a decent slide rule. But it does not stack up well against other Japanese-made slide rules, in terms of workmanship.</p>

<h4 id="dempster-us">Dempster (US)</h4>

<p><strong><em>Dempster RotaRule Model AA</em></strong>—The Dempster RotaRule was designed and manufactured by John Dempster, a mechanical engineer, for use in engineering. Only about 2,500 units were made between 1928 and 1950, so it is a rare item. A clean, unmarred example like this one is even rarer. The Dempster RotaRule is undoubtedly the most desirable log-log duplex engineering circular rule. The phrase “engineering circular rule” is an oxymoron, given that circular slide rules were a favourite of businessmen and most engineers disliked circular rules. But the Dempster RotaRule is a different kind of circular rule. It has all everything that engineers need: the trigonometric scales, the four $LL_n$ scales, and the Pythagorean $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$ scale. At about 13 cm in diameter, this slide rule is about the same size as the simplex FC 8/10. But unlike the FC 8/10’s sedate, single-cycle Rietz scales, the Dempster RotaRule has a 254-cm, quadruple-cycle $LL_n$ scale. And it even has a surveyor’s $Stadia$ scale and a financier’s $Monthly\ Interest$ scale, making it suitable for both technical and business uses. Because the outer portion of the disc (analogue of straight rule’s frame) is fixed and the inner portion (analogue of straight rule’s slide) rotates, the Dempster RotaRule needs only one cursor. And this cursor is well made to the point of being over engineered: it has a sturdy frame equipped with a friction lock, and the central hub has hole to plant a small, brass-framed magnifier that comes with the device. Somewhat unusually, the Dempster RotaRule places the trigonometric scales on the frontside. This slide rule is held with the $1$ index mark pointing down, and is flipped left-to-right. The all-important $LL_n$ scale is on the backside.</p>

<p>The Dempster RotaRule inspired the <a href="https://www.sliderulemuseum.com/Circular/Boykin_RotaRule_Model510.jpg">Boykin RotaRule Model 510</a>, which is a proper engineering slide rule, with three $LL_n$ scales and three $LL_{0n}$ scales, comparable in capabilities to a top-of-the-line, log-log duplex engineering straight rule, like the K&amp;E 4081-3, only much smaller and with far greater precision. Incidentally, <a href="http://www.oughtred.org/memoriam/memoriam.shtml">Bernard Boykin</a>, the designer of the fabulous Boykin circular slide rule, was my fellow engineer and a fellow Marylander, to boot. Alas, I do not own a Boykin circular rule.</p>

<p><strong><em>FC 8/10</em></strong>—The FC 8/10 is a simplex circular rule with Rietz-equivalent scales. It uses aesthetically pleasing pale yellow and pale green backgrounds for some of the scales. I consider this slide rule one of the prettiest of all engineering tools. I liked the FC 8/10, not only for its beauty, but also because it was well made, accurate, inexpensive, unique, and compact. All the scales are engraved onto the exposed plastic face. The outer portion of the face is fixed to the body, and the rotatable inner portion of the face is operated using both thumbs, pushing against each other. And the cursor with the hairline rotates across the face over the scales.</p>

<p><img src="https://amenzwa.github.io/stem/figures/SlideRules/FC8-10/DSC00124.JPG" alt="FC 8/10"></p>

<p>As an engineering student in the early 1980s Burma, I used this FC 8/10; it was a hand-me-down from my engineer aunt. It was my favourite slide rule, and I used it daily for ordinary tasks. But when I needed the $LL$ scales, say for laboratory work and examinations, I used my other slide rule, the Aristo 0968 log-log duplex straight rule. In general, hopping among different slide rules is considered detrimental, since it robs one the opportunity to develop an intimate relation with a single device. But the FC 8/10 is a unique circular rule: it is just a straight rule in a circular guise. Despite being circular in shape, it operates on the same principles as the Rietz straight rule: the outer portion of the FC 8/10 is analogous to the frame of the straight rule, and the inner portion is analogous to the slide of the straight rule. And the circular shape of the device physically and visually highlights the wrap-around nature of the logarithmic scales. So, my flip-flopping between the FC 8/10 and the 0968 did not impact me, negatively.</p>

<h4 id="fowler-uk">Fowler (UK)</h4>

<p><strong><em>Fowler’s Universal Calculator</em></strong>—At only about 8.5 cm in diameter, the Fowler’s Universal Calculator is perfectly sized for the hand. Etched into the glass cover is the fixed red hairline, aligned to the crown at 12 o’clock. Turning this crown clockwise rotates the face anticlockwise, and turning it anticlockwise rotates the face clockwise. This behaviour may feel weird at first, but it becomes natural with use. All the scales are etched onto this one-piece, rotating face. Turning the crown at 2 o’clock clockwise rotates the clear plastic cursor bearing the black hairline clockwise, and turning it anticlockwise rotates the cursor anticlockwise. The second crown behaves more naturally. It is odd, however, that this slide rule has no $x^2$ $A$ and $B$ scales, yet it has a very long, triple-cycle $\sqrt[3]{x}$ scale. Let us chalk it up to “business logic”.</p>

<h4 id="gilson-us">Gilson (US)</h4>

<p><strong><em>Gilson Binary</em></strong>—The Gilson Binary is a cheaply-made, large, thin, aluminium disc of approximately 22 cm in diameter. Given its immense size, it is capable of very high precision calculations. And its two-arm cursor mechanism is quite clever. The frontside has $C$, $CI$, $A$, $K$, $L$, $LL_0$, $LL_1$, $LL_2$, $LL_3$, fraction multiplication and division scale, and millimetre to fractional-inch conversion scale pair. Engineers round the world have always deemed fractions to be annoyances, like a piece of food stuck between the teeth. But to American engineers of yore, fractions were their bread-and-butter. So, the Gilson Binary was a favourite tool of many an American engineer, decades ago. Thankfully, fractions are no longer a thing in American engineering today, although they still dominate factory floors, as do the Imperial measurement system. Depressing.</p>

<p>The Gilson Binary’s $C$ scale is over 60 cm in length. The range of the entire clockwise, quadruple-cycle $LL_n$ scale is an impressive $[1.0015, 10^6]$. So, chasing the mammoth $LL$ scale round the large face is a daunting task. To ease the pain, the tan-colour face is punctuated with bright yellow scale background rings: the $LL_0$ scale has tan background, the $LL_1$ scale has yellow background, and so on. That helps—somewhat.</p>

<p>The ingenious part of the Gilson Binary is its two-armed cursor mechanism. The front face of this slide rule has two clear plastic cursors, one longer than the other. When the long cursor is moved, the short cursor also moves in lock step. But the short cursor can be moved independently of the long cursor. Suffice it to say the Gilson Binary’s design is unique. Without the aid of a manual, even experienced straight rule users would be hard pressed to figure out how properly to use it. But once its quirks have been discovered, it is just as simple to use as a straight rule. Note, also, that the Gilson Binary’s two-cursor configuration requires only one logarithmic scale $C$. Hence, there is no need to allocate space for the $D$ scale.</p>

<p><img src="https://amenzwa.github.io/stem/figures/SlideRules/GilsonBinary/DSC00135.JPG" alt="Gilson Binary"></p>

<p><img src="https://amenzwa.github.io/stem/figures/SlideRules/GilsonBinary/DSC00136.JPG" alt="Gilson Binary"></p>

<p>Ordinarily, computations begin with setting the long cursor hairline on the $1$ on the $C$ scale, and end with reading under the short cursor hairline on the appropriate scale. The short cursor is analogous to the slide of a straight rule.</p>

<p>To compute $2 × 3$, we manipulate the slide rule as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>$C$—Place the long cursor hairline on the $1$ on the $C$ scale. This reset the slide rule.</li>
  <li>$C$—Place the short cursor hairline on the <em>multiplicand</em> $2$ on the $C$ scale.</li>
  <li>$C$—Move the long cursor and place its hairline on the <em>multiplier</em> $3$ on the $C$ scale. This drags the short cursor along.</li>
  <li>$C$—Read under the short cursor hairline the <em>product</em> $6$ on the $C$ scale. This computes $2 × 3 = 6$.</li>
</ul>

<p>To compute $1.03^{2.4}$, we manipulate the slide rule as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>$C$—Place the long cursor hairline on the $1$ on the $C$ scale. This reset the slide rule.</li>
  <li>$LL_1$—Place the short cursor hairline on the <em>base</em> $1.03$ on the $LL_1$ scale.</li>
  <li>$C$—Move the long cursor and place its hairline on the <em>exponent</em> $2.4$ on the $C$ scale. This drags the short cursor along.</li>
  <li>$LL_1$—Read under the short hairline the <em>result</em> $1.0735$ on the $LL_1$ scale. This computes $1.03^{2.4} = 1.0735$.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Gilson Binary is held with the $1$ index mark pointing up, and is flipped left-to-right. As I said above, it is a rather unusual slide rule. The unusual design elements continue on the back face. The backside cursor is a one-arm variety. For instance, unlike a typical slide rule, the Gilson Binary has two opposing $Degree$ scales, one running clockwise and the other anticlockwise. These degree scales are split into three cycles, each spanning $30°$. Stacked atop the degree scales are the clockwise, triple-cycle $T$ scales. The $Degree$-$T$ scale pair is interlaced with the clockwise, triple-cycle $S$ scales. And note that since the $Degree$ scale’s range is $[0°, 90°]$, one must use care to avoid reading a nonsensical value like $tan(90°) = ∞$.</p>

<p>American slide rule manufacturers, like most American engineers of that era, had a hostile attitude toward users in general and toward usability in particular, mistakenly believing that smart, trained people—like engineers—should be able to cope with complexity. This attitude is prominently on display in the design of the Gilson Binary. This slide rule would be far more pleasant to use, had the subtle background colours—green, blue, and yellow, like those found on the FC 8/10—been used, instead of the hypnotic yellow rings. Yes, it is unfair to compare the 1930s Gilson with the 1970s Faber-Castell. But it is eminently fair to compare the American Gilson to its German contemporaries, like the FC 1/54 and the Nestler 23 R. There, too, the Gilson design falls woefully short, in terms of aesthetics and usability.</p>

<p>One more thing. There is a usability quirk common to all circular rules: to bring the upside-down scales into correct, upright orientation, the body of the circular rule must be spun round. This is easy enough for smaller circular rules, like the Dempster RotaRule, the FC 8/10, or the Fowler’s Universal Calculator; one simply spins the holding hand—without shifting the grip—thereby retaining the anchor point on the scale. But for a big circular rule, like the Gilson Binary, it is often necessary to use both hands to spin the rule, thus necessitating shifting of the grip and losing the anchor point on the scale. The long, spiral scales of the Gilson Binary exacerbate this problem. This is where usability-improving features, such as the German rules’ coloured scale backgrounds, could have made the Gilson Binary (and its <a href="https://www.sliderulemuseum.com/">many imitators</a>) far more user friendly.</p>

<h4 id="kontrolpribor-ru">Kontrolpribor (RU)</h4>

<p><strong><em>Kontrolpribor Model KL-1</em></strong>—The Kontrolpribor KL-1 is a pocket watch type duplex circular rule. It is about the size of a wristwatch. The front and back faces are covered with cheap plastic. Because the plastic covers are domed, they are prone to scratching. The black-dotted crown at 12 o’clock rotates the face and the red-dotted one at 2 o’clock rotates the needle. The frontside has 15-cm long $C$ and $A$ scales. The backside has circular $C$ and $S$ scales and a spiral $T$ scale. This slide rule is comparable in computing power to a pocket Mannheim straight rule. The Kontrolpribor KL-1 is held with the black-dotted crown pointing up, and is flipped left-to-right. The backside has the $C$ scale, the circular $S\ [5.5°, 90°]$ scale, and the spiral $T\ [1°, 45°]$ scale. This scale layout is quite unique.</p>

<p><img src="https://amenzwa.github.io/stem/figures/SlideRules/KontrolpriborKL1/DSC00120.JPG" alt="Kontrolpribor Model KL-1"></p>

<p>Compared to the Fowler’s Universal Calculator, this slide rule is but a cheap toy. Yet, it is much more powerful than the Breitling Navitimer, a very expensive toy.</p>

<h4 id="loga-ch">Loga (CH)</h4>

<p><strong><em>Loga 30 Tt</em></strong>—The enviable Swiss craftsmanship is evident in the Loga 30 Tt: accurate, sturdy, elegant. Being a Darmstadt-equivalent model, it is one of the more powerful circular rules. Like other high-end circular rules, the outer portion of the front face is fixed to the frame and the inner portion rotates. The frontside cursor bisects the front face that holds a double-cycle, stacked $\sqrt{x}$ scale and the usual Darmstadt scales. The $\sqrt{x}$ scale is the inverse of the $x^2$ scales ordinarily labelled $A$ and $B$. On this slide rule, though, the $C$ and $D$ scales are confusingly labelled $A$ and $B$. Another quirk of the Loga 30 Tt is that it is intended to be flipped by holding it between the right thumb and forefinger at 3 o’clock. If it were flipped left-to-right, the $1$ index mark would point to the right instead of straight up. The entire back face is fixed to the frame, and holds the $S$, $T$, $ST$, and the three $LL_n$ scales. The end of the backside cursor protrudes beyond the disc. The clever bit is that the back cursor is attached to the inner rotating portion of the front face, and the cursor’s protruding end serves as the handle that rotates the inner front face. A small, rotatable, black disc is mounted to the backside hub. This disc is meant to be used as the handle, when computing with the frontside scales. In terms of capability and quality, the Loga 30 Tt is on par with high-end Darmstadt straight rules, like BRL D.26, FC 1/54, and Nestler 0210. I rather fancy the Loga 30 Tt.</p>

<h4 id="pickett--eckel-us-1">Pickett &amp; Eckel (US)</h4>

<p><strong><em>Pickett 101-C Dial Rule</em></strong>—The Pickett 101-C is a low-end circular rule. The body is a cheap, thin aluminium disc, not unlike the Gilson Binary. Being a rather small disc, there is space for only two $LL_n$ scales. The ranges are notable, though: $LL_1 ∈ [1.15, 4.0]$ and $LL_2 ∈ [4, 10^6]$. And like other low-end, American circular rules of that era, this slide rule has a fraction scale. Indeed, the Pickett 101-C is essentially a miniature version of the Gilson Binary, except for the much shorter $LL_n$ scale. This slide rule is held with the $1$ index mark pointing up, and is flipped bottom-to-top, like a straight rule.</p>

<p><img src="https://amenzwa.github.io/stem/figures/SlideRules/Pickett101C/DSC00127.JPG" alt="Pickett 101-C"></p>

<p><img src="https://amenzwa.github.io/stem/figures/SlideRules/Pickett101C/DSC00128.JPG" alt="Pickett 101-C"></p>

<p><strong><em>Pickett 111-ES</em></strong>—Unlike other Pickett rules, which are made in America, the Pickett 111-ES is made in Japan. And although it has an aluminium core, the metal edges are rounded off and the faces are covered in high-quality Japanese plastic. It is a pleasant rule to use, despite its eye-gouging yellow. The Pickett 111-ES is held with the $1$ index mark pointing down, and flipped left-to-right. This slide rule is a log-log duplex advanced engineering circular rule with eight $LL$ scales, a rarity among circular rules. In fact, it is more capable than the venerable Dempster RotaRule—a sacrilegious! This slide rule employs Pickett’s stacked layout for the $LL$ scales. But whereas the Pickett N3-ES stacks $LL_n$ and $LL_{0n}$ on the same line, the Pickett 111-ES stacks the adjacent $LL$ scales: the $LL_0$-$LL_1$ stack and the $LL_2$-$LL_3$ stack are on the frontside, and the $LL_{00}$-$LL_{01}$ stack and the $LL_{02}$-$LL_{03}$ stack are on the backside. The backside also holds a double-cycle $S$ scale, a triple-cycle $T$ scale, and a single-cycle $ST$ scale.</p>

<p><img src="https://amenzwa.github.io/stem/figures/SlideRules/Pickett111ES/DSC00129.JPG" alt="Pickett 111ES"></p>

<p><img src="https://amenzwa.github.io/stem/figures/SlideRules/Pickett111ES/DSC00130.JPG" alt="Pickett 111ES"></p>

<p>The capabilities of the Pickett 111-ES compare well against top-of-the-line engineering straight rules, like Aristo 0969, FC 2/83 N, Nestler 0292, K&amp;E 68-1100, Pickett N3-ES, and others. And similar in design to other high-end circular rules, like the Dempster RotaRule, the outer portion is fixed, the inner portion rotates, and the duplex cursor is firm but glides smoothly. I am no fan of Pickett slide rules, but I really like the Pickett 111-ES.</p>

<h2 id="cylindrical-rules-1"><em>cylindrical rules</em></h2>

<h4 id="otis-king-uk">Otis King (UK)</h4>

<p><strong><em>Otis King Model K</em></strong>—Otis King cylindrical slide rules use helical scales. The Model K is unusual in that it uses a double-cycle $C$ scale, thus, can perform chained calculations without the need to reset the cursor, as is necessary with the Model L, described below, which has a normal, single-cycle $C$ scale. But the Model K is limited, capability wise: it could compute only $×$ and $÷$.</p>

<p><img src="https://amenzwa.github.io/stem/figures/SlideRules/OtisKingK/DSC00147.JPG" alt="Otis King Model K"></p>

<p>To use the Model K, one holds the chrome handle in one hand and, with the free hand, pulls out the top, thereby exposing the helical logarithmic scales. The black cylinder in the middle, which is operated with the free hand, is the equivalent of the straight rule’s cursor. It is engraved with two white index marks which are aligned to each other. These indices are equivalent of a straight rule’s cursor hairline. The upper cylinder, which holds the $C$ scale can shift up and down along the longitudinal axis, and it can also spin about that axis independently of the fixed $D$ scale on the lower cylinder. The back-facing numbers on the $D$ scale can be brought into view by spinning the chrome handle. And the black cylinder can shift and spin independently of both the upper and the lower scales. So, the Model K’s fixed lower cylinder is equivalent to the frame of the straight rule and the movable upper cylinder is equivalent to the slide of the straight rule.</p>

<p><strong><em>Otis King Model L</em></strong>—The Model L is identical in construction and operation to the Model K. These two slide rules have a $D$ scale that is almost the same length. But the Model L’s upper cylinder is occupied by the single-cycle $C$ scale and the $L$ scale. The Model L could compute $×$, $÷$, $log$, and $log^{-1}$.</p>

<p><img src="https://amenzwa.github.io/stem/figures/SlideRules/OtisKingL/DSC00148.JPG" alt="Otis King Model L"></p>

<h2 id="conclusion">CONCLUSION</h2>

<p>I have endeavoured to give a thorough enough explanation in this article on how the slide rule works, how it was used, and how it came to be. But this article will not make the reader an expert user of an advanced engineering slide rule; that is the domain of the user’s manuals. I have also emphasised the necessity of engaging the mind, when using a slide rule. And I have demonstrated the extent to which some very simple mathematical functions, like $log$, $ln$, $sin$, $tan$, etc., were put to use to solve substantial problems in engineering.</p>

<p>Ingenuity is the ability to make useful things inexpensively on a massive scale by composing simple, but innovative, ideas in reliable, repeatable ways. And that is what engineering is. The slide rule, both as a tool for engineering and as a product of engineering, epitomised this philosophy in its day. The slide rule was born when necessity and ingenuity coincided at a crucial point in history, and it accelerated the technological development of humanity. Over its almost four-century reign, it enabled us to cross the oceans, it empowered us to span the continents, it took us to the Moon. The slide rules deserves remembrance, respect, reverence.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p><strong>IT-Security Researchers from the University of Vienna and SBA Research identified and responsibly disclosed a large-scale privacy weakness in WhatsApp's contact discovery mechanism that allowed the enumeration of 3.5 billion accounts. In collaboration with the researchers, Meta has since addressed and mitigated the issue. The study underscores the importance of continuous, independent security research on widely used communication platforms and highlights the risks associated with the centralization of instant messaging services. The preprint of the study has now been published, and the results will be presented in 2026 at the Network and Distributed System Security (NDSS) Symposium.</strong></p><p>WhatsApp's contact discovery mechanism can use a user's address book to find other WhatsApp users by their phone number. Using the same underlying mechanism, the researchers demonstrated that it was possible to query more than 100 million phone numbers per hour through WhatsApp's infrastructure, confirming more than 3.5 billion active accounts across 245 countries. "Normally, a system shouldn't respond to such a high number of requests in such a short time — particularly when originating from a single source," explains lead author Gabriel Gegenhuber from the University of Vienna. "This behavior exposed the underlying flaw, which allowed us to issue an effectively unlimited requests to the server and, in doing so, map user data worldwide."</p><p>The accessible data items used in the study are the same that are public for anyone who knows a user's phone number and consist of: phone number, public keys, timestamps, and, if set to public, about text and profile picture. From these data points, the researchers were able to extract additional information, which allowed them to infer a user's operating system, account age, as well as the number of linked companion devices. The study shows that even this limited amount of data per user can reveal important information, both on macroscopic and individual levels.</p><h2>The study also revealed a range of broader insights:</h2><ul><li>Millions of active WhatsApp accounts were identified in countries where the platform was officially banned, including China, Iran, and Myanmar.</li><li>Population-level insights into platform usage, such as the global distribution of Android (81%) versus iOS (19%) devices, regional differences in privacy behavior (e.g., use of public profile pictures or "about" tagline), and variations in user growth across countries.</li><li>A small number of cases showed re-use of cryptographic keys across different devices or phone numbers, pointing to potential weaknesses in non-official WhatsApp clients or fraudulent use.</li><li>Nearly half of all phone numbers that appeared in the 2021 Facebook data leak of 500 million phone numbers (caused by a scraping incident in 2018) were still active on WhatsApp. This highlights the enduring risks for leaked numbers (e.g., being targeted in scam calls) associated with such exposures.</li></ul><p>The study did not involve access to message content, and no personal data was published or shared. All retrieved data was deleted by the researchers prior to publication. Message content on WhatsApp is “end-to-end encrypted” and was not affected at any time. “This end-to-end encryption protects the content of messages, but not necessarily the associated metadata,” explains last author Aljosha Judmayer from the University of Vienna. “Our work shows that privacy risks can also arise when such metadata is collected and analysed on a large scale.”</p><p>“These findings remind us that even mature, widely trusted systems can contain design or implementation flaws that have real-world consequences," says lead author Gabriel Gegenhuber from the University of Vienna: "They show that security and privacy are not one-time achievements, but must be continuously re-evaluated as technology evolves."</p><p>"Building on our previous findings on delivery receipts and key management, we are contributing to a long-term understanding of how messaging systems evolve and where new risks arise," adds co-author Maximilian Günther from the University of Vienna.</p><p>“We are grateful to the University of Vienna researchers for their responsible partnership and diligence under our Bug Bounty program. This collaboration successfully identified a novel enumeration technique that surpassed our intended limits, allowing the researchers to scrape basic publicly available information. We had already been working on industry-leading anti-scraping systems, and this study was instrumental in stress-testing and confirming the immediate efficacy of these new defenses. Importantly, the researchers have securely deleted the data collected as part of the study, and we have found no evidence of malicious actors abusing this vector. As a reminder, user messages remained private and secure thanks to WhatsApp’s default end-to-end encryption, and no non-public data was accessible to the researchers”, says Nitin Gupta, Vice President of Engineering at WhatsApp.&nbsp;</p><h2>Ethical Handling and Disclosure</h2><p>The research was conducted with strict ethical guidelines and in accordance with responsible disclosure principles. The findings were promptly reported to Meta, the operator of WhatsApp, which has since implemented countermeasures (e.g., rate-limiting, stricter profile information visibility) to close the identified vulnerability. The authors argue that transparency, academic scrutiny, and independent testing are essential to maintaining trust in global communication services. They emphasize that proactive collaboration between researchers and industry can significantly improve user privacy and prevent abuse.</p><h2>Research Context</h2><p>This publication represents the third study by researchers from the University of Vienna and SBA Research examining the security and privacy of prevalent instant messengers such as WhatsApp and Signal. The team investigates how design and implementation choices in end-to-end encrypted messaging services can unintentionally expose user information or weaken privacy guarantees.</p><p>Earlier this year, the researchers published "Careless Whisper: Exploiting Silent Delivery Receipts to Monitor Users on Mobile Instant Messengers" (distinguished with the Best Paper Award at RAID 2025), which demonstrated how silent pings and their delivery receipts could be abused to infer user activity patterns and online behavior on WhatsApp and similar messaging platforms. Later that same year, "Prekey Pogo: Investigating Security and Privacy Issues in WhatsApp's Handshake Mechanism" (presented at USENIX WOOT 2025) analyzed the cryptographic foundations of WhatsApp's prekey distribution mechanism, revealing implementation weaknesses of the Signal-based protocol.</p><p>"By building on our earlier findings about delivery receipts and key management, we're contributing to a long-term understanding of how messaging systems evolve, and where new risks emerge." said Maximilian Günther (University of Vienna).</p><p>The current study, "Hey there! You are using WhatsApp: Enumerating Three Billion Accounts for Security and Privacy", extends this line of research to the global scope, showing how contact discovery mechanisms can unintentionally allow large-scale user enumeration at an unprecedented magnitude. It will appear in the proceedings of the NDSS Symposium 2026, one of the leading international conferences on computer and network security.</p><p><strong>Publication:</strong> Gabriel K.

But with Microsoft literally becoming an AI company in the last year, it's hard to believe we're going to see a version of Windows that isn't bloated with AI functionality most people didn't ask for.</p><div data-hydrate="true" id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-jbUTVxP5LC8chaLMMc9Fsm"><section><p>All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.</p></section></div><p>Suleyman's post after the recent backlash around Windows and Copilot is not reassuring.
