<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p>OpenAI is now set to become a Public Benefit Corporation, with its investors entitled to uncapped profit shares. Its nonprofit foundation will retain some measure of control and a 26% financial stake, in sharp contrast to its previous stronger control and much, much larger effective financial stake. The value transfer is in the hundreds of billions, thus potentially the largest theft in human history. </p><p>I say potentially largest because I realized one could argue that the events surrounding the dissolution of the USSR involved a larger theft. Unless you really want to stretch the definition of what counts this seems to be in the top two.</p><p><span>I am in no way surprised by OpenAI moving forward on this, but I am deeply disgusted and disappointed they are being allowed (for now) to do so, </span><a href="https://news.delaware.gov/2025/10/28/ag-jennings-completes-review-of-openai-recapitalization/#:~:text=Delaware%20secures%20structural%20reform%20and,.%2C%20a%20Delaware%20nonprofit%20corporation" rel="">including this statement of no action by Delaware</a><span> and t</span><a href="https://oag.ca.gov/system/files/attachments/press-docs/Final%20Executed%20MOU%20Between%20OpenAI%20and%20California%20AG%20re%20Notice%20of%20Conditions%20of%20Non-Objection%20%2810.27.2025%29%20%28Signed%20by%20OpenAI%29%20%28Signed%20by%20CA%20DOJ%29.pdf" rel="">his Memorandum of Understanding with California</a><span>.  </span></p><p><span>Many media and public sources are calling this a win for the nonprofit, </span><a href="https://x.com/AISafetyMemes/status/1983486800569229518" rel="">such as this from the San Francisco Chronicle</a><span>. This is mostly them being fooled. They’re anchoring on OpenAI’s previous plan to far more fully sideline the nonprofit. This is indeed a big win for the nonprofit compared to OpenAI’s previous plan. But the previous plan would have been a complete disaster, an all but total expropriation. </span></p><p>It’s as if a mugger demanded all your money, you talked them down to giving up half your money, and you called that exchange a ‘change that recapitalized you.’</p><p><span>As in, </span><a href="https://openai.com/index/built-to-benefit-everyone/" rel="">they claim OpenAI has ‘completed its recapitalization</a><span>’ and the nonprofit will now only hold equity OpenAI claims is valued at approximately $130 billion (as in 26% of the company, which is actually to be fair worth substantially more than that if they get away with this), as opposed to its previous status of holding the bulk of the profit interests in a company valued at (when you include the nonprofit interests) well over $500 billion, along with a presumed gutting of much of the nonprofit’s highly valuable control rights. </span></p><p>They claim this additional clause, presumably the foundation is getting warrants with but they don’t offer the details here:</p><blockquote><p>If OpenAI Group’s share price increases greater than tenfold after 15 years, the OpenAI Foundation will receive significant additional equity. With its equity stake and the warrant, the Foundation is positioned to be the single largest long-term beneficiary of OpenAI’s success.</p></blockquote><p>We don’t know that ‘significant’ additional equity means, there’s some sort of unrevealed formula going on, but given the nonprofit got expropriated last time I have no expectation that these warrants would get honored. We will be lucky if the nonprofit meaningfully retains the remainder of its equity.</p><p><a href="https://x.com/sama/status/1983182740666364113" rel="">Sam Altman’s statement on this is here, also announcing his livestream Q&amp;A</a><span> that took place on Tuesday afternoon. </span></p><p>There can be reasonable disagreements about exactly how much. It’s a ton.</p><p>There used to be a profit cap, where in Greg Brockman’s own words, ‘If we succeed, we believe we’ll create orders of magnitude more value than any existing company — in which case all but a fraction is returned to the world.’ </p><p>Well, so much for that.</p><p><span>I looked at this question in </span><strong><a href="https://thezvi.substack.com/p/the-mask-comes-off-at-what-price" rel="">The Mask Comes Off: At What Price</a></strong><span> a year ago. </span></p><p>If we take seriously that OpenAI is looking to go public at a $1 trillion valuation, then consider that Matt Levine estimated the old profit cap only going up to about $272 billion, and that OpenAI still is a bet on extreme upside. </p><blockquote><p><span>Garrison Lovely: UVA economist Anton Korinek has used standard economic models to </span><a href="https://www.genaiforecon.org/ValueAGI.pdf" rel="">estimate</a><span> that AGI could be worth anywhere from $1.25 to $71 quadrillion globally. If you take Korinek’s assumptions about OpenAI’s share, that would put the company’s value at $30.9 trillion. In this scenario, Microsoft would walk away with less than one percent of the total, with the overwhelming majority flowing to the nonprofit.</span></p><p><span>It’s tempting to dismiss these numbers as fantasy. But it’s a fantasy constructed in large part by OpenAI, when it </span><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/openai-warns-agi-money-obsolete-while-raising-billions-usd-2025-8" rel="">wrote</a><span> lines like, “it may be difficult to know what role money will play in a post-AGI world,” or when Altman </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzcJlKg2Rc0&amp;t=2734s" rel="">said</a><span> that if OpenAI succeeded at building AGI, it might “capture the light cone of all future value in the universe.” That, he said, “is for sure not okay for one group of investors to have.”</span></p></blockquote><p>I guess Altman is okay with that now?</p><p>Obviously you can’t base your evaluations on a projection that puts the company at a value of $30.9 trillion, and that calculation is deeply silly, for many overloaded and obvious reasons, including decreasing marginal returns to profits. </p><p>It is still true that most of the money OpenAI makes in possible futures, it makes as part of profits in excess of $1 trillion. </p><blockquote><p><a href="https://www.themidasproject.com/article-list/the-midas-project-statement-on-openai-s-restructuring" rel="">The Midas Project</a><span>: Thanks to the now-gutted profit caps, OpenAI’s nonprofit was already entitled to the vast majority of the company’s cash flows. </span><a href="https://openai.com/index/openai-lp/" rel="">According to OpenAI</a><span>, if they succeeded, “orders of magnitude” more money would go to the nonprofit than to investors. President Greg Brockman said “all but a fraction” of the money they earn would be returned to the world thanks to the profit caps.</span></p><p>Reducing that to 26% equity—even with a warrant (of unspecified value) that only activates if valuation increases tenfold over 15 years—represents humanity voluntarily surrendering tens or hundreds of billions of dollars it was already entitled to. Private investors are now entitled to dramatically more, and humanity dramatically less.</p><p><span>OpenAI is not suddenly one of the best-resourced nonprofits ever. From the public’s perspective, OpenAI may be one of the </span><em>worst</em><span> financially performing nonprofits in history, having voluntarily transferred more of the public’s entitled value to private interests than perhaps any charitable organization ever.</span></p></blockquote><p>I think Levine’s estimate was low at the time, and you also have to account for equity raised since then or that will be sold in the IPO, but it seems obvious that the majority of future profit interests were, prior to the conversion, still in the hands of the non-profit.</p><p>Even if we thought the new control rights were as strong as the old, we would still be looking at a theft in excess of $250 billion, and a plausible case can be made for over $500 billion. I leave the full calculation to others.</p><p>The vote in the board was unanimous. </p><p>I wonder exactly how and by who they will be sued over it, and what will become of that. Elon Musk, at a minimum, is trying. </p><p>They say behind every great fortune is a great crime. </p><p>Altman points out that the nonprofit could become the best-resourced non-profit in the world if OpenAI does well. This is true. There is quite a lot they were unable to steal. But it is beside the point, in that it does not make taking the other half, including changing the corporate structure without permission, not theft.</p><blockquote><p><a href="https://www.themidasproject.com/article-list/the-midas-project-statement-on-openai-s-restructuring" rel="">The Midas Project</a><span>: From the public’s perspective, OpenAI may be one of the worst financially performing nonprofits in history, having voluntarily transferred more of the public’s entitled value to private interests than perhaps any charitable organization ever.</span></p></blockquote><p>There’s no perhaps on that last clause. On this level, whether or not you agree with the term ‘theft,’ it isn’t even close, this is the largest transfer. Of course, if you take the whole of OpenAI’s nonprofit from inception, performance looks better.  </p><blockquote><p><a href="https://x.com/aidan_mclau/status/1983338894608495018" rel="">Aidan McLaughlin</a><span> (OpenAI):  ah yes openai now has the same greedy corporate structure as (checks notes) Patagonia, Anthropic, Coursera, and http://Change.org.</span></p><p>Chase Brower: well i think the concern was with the non profit getting a low share.</p><p>Aidan McLaughlin: our nonprofit is currently valued slightly less than all of anthropic.</p><p>Tyler Johnson: And according to OpenAI itself, it should be valued at approximately three Anthropics! (Fwiw I think the issues with the restructuring extend pretty far beyond valuations, but this is one of them!)</p></blockquote><p>Yes, it is true that the nonprofit, after the theft and excluding control rights, will have an on-paper valuation only slightly lower than the on-paper value of all of Anthropic. </p><p>The $500 billion valuation excludes the non-profit’s previous profit share, so even if you think the nonprofit was treated fairly and lost no control rights you would then have it be worth $175 billion rather than $130 billion, so yes slightly less than Anthropic, and if you acknowledge that the nonprofit got stolen from it’s even more.</p><p><a href="https://x.com/tszzl/status/1983602123834343484" rel="">If OpenAI can successfully go public at a $1 trillion valuation</a><span>, then depending on how much of that are new shares they will be selling the nonprofit could be worth up to $260 billion.</span></p><p>What about some of the comparable governance structures here?  Coursera does seem to be a rather straightforward B-corp. The others don’t?</p><p>Patagonia has the closely held Patagonia Purpose Trust, which holds 2% of shares and 100% of voting control, and The Holdfast Collective, which is a 501c(4) nonprofit with 98% of the shares and profit interests. The Chouinard family has full control over the company, and 100% of profits go to charitable causes. </p><p>Does that sound like OpenAI’s new corporate structure to you?</p><p>Change.org’s nonprofit owns 100% of its PBC.</p><p>Does that sound like OpenAI’s new corporate structure to you? </p><p>Anthropic is a PBC, but also has the Long Term Benefit Trust. One can argue how meaningfully different this is from OpenAI’s new corporate structure, if you disregard who is involved in all of this. </p><p><a href="https://x.com/BjarturTomas/status/1983183247795507298" rel="">What the new structure definitely is distinct from is the original intention:</a></p><blockquote><p>Tomas Bjartur: If not in the know, OpenAI once promised any profits over a threshold would be gifted to you, citizen of the world, for your happy, ultra-wealthy retirement - one needed as they plan to obsolete you. This is now void. </p></blockquote><p><span>Would OpenAI have been able to raise further investment </span><a href="https://www.obsolete.pub/p/breaking-openai-alums-nobel-laureates" rel="">without withdrawing its profit caps for investments already made?</a><span> </span></p><p>When you put it like that it seems like obviously yes? </p><p>I can see the argument that to raise funds going forward, future equity investments need to not come with a cap. Okay, fine. That doesn’t mean you hand past investors, including Microsoft, hundreds of billions in value in exchange for nothing. </p><p>One can argue this was necessary to overcome other obstacles, that OpenAI had already allowed itself to be put in a stranglehold another way and had no choice. But the fundraising story does not make sense. </p><p>The argument that OpenAI had to ‘complete its recapitalization’ or risk being asked for its money back is even worse. Investors who put in money at under $200 billion are going to ask for a refund when the valuation is now at $500 billion? Really? If so, wonderful, I know a great way to cut them that check.</p><p>I am deeply disappointed that both the Delaware and California attorneys general found this deal adequate on equity compensation for the nonprofit. </p><p>I am however reasonably happy with the provisions on control rights, which seem about as good as one can hope for given the decision to convert to a PBC. I can accept that the previous situation was not sustainable in practice given prior events.</p><p>The new provisions include an ongoing supervisory role for the California AG, and extensive safety veto points for the NFP and the SSC committee. </p><p>If I was confident that these provisions would be upheld, and especially if I was confident their spirit would be upheld, then this is actually pretty good, and if it is used wisely and endures it is more important than their share of the profits.</p><blockquote><p>AG Bonta: We will be keeping a close eye on OpenAI to ensure ongoing adherence to its charitable mission and the protection of the safety of all Californians.</p></blockquote><p>The nonprofit will indeed retain substantial resources and influence, but no I do not expect the public safety mission to dominate the OpenAI enterprise. Indeed, contra the use of the word ‘ongoing,’ it seems clear that it already had ceased to do so, and this seems obvious to anyone tracking OpenAI’s activities, including many recent activities. </p><p><a href="https://openai.com/our-structure/" rel="">What is the new control structure?</a><span> </span></p><p><a href="https://news.delaware.gov/2025/10/28/ag-jennings-completes-review-of-openai-recapitalization/#:~:text=Delaware%20secures%20structural%20reform%20and,.%2C%20a%20Delaware%20nonprofit%20corporation" rel="">OpenAI did not say, but the Delaware AG tells us more</a><span> and the California AG has additional detail.

This will include the PBC using the principles in the “OpenAI Charter,” available at </span><strong><a href="https://openai.com/charter" rel="">openai.com/charter</a></strong><span>, to execute the mission.</span></p></li><li><p>PBC directors will be required to consider only the mission (and may not consider the pecuniary interests of stockholders or any other interest) with respect to safety and security issues related to the OpenAI enterprise and its technology.</p></li><li><p>The NFP’s board-level Safety and Security Committee, which is a critical decision maker on safety and security issues for the OpenAI enterprise, will remain a committee of the NFP and not be moved to the PBC. The committee will have the authority to oversee and review the safety and security processes and practices of OpenAI and its controlled affiliates with respect to model development and deployment. It will have the power and authority to require mitigation measures—up to and including halting the release of models or AI systems—even where the applicable risk thresholds would otherwise permit release.</p></li><li><p>The Chair of the Safety and Security Committee will be a director on the NFP Board and will not be a member of the PBC Board. Initially, this will be the current committee chair, Mr. Zico Kolter. As chair, he will have full observation rights to attend all PBC Board and committee meetings and will receive all information regularly shared with PBC directors and any additional information shared with PBC directors related to safety and security.</p></li><li><p>With the intent of advancing the mission, the NFP will have access to the PBC’s advanced research, intellectual property, products and platforms, including artificial intelligence models, Application Program Interfaces (APIs), and related tools and technologies, as well as ongoing operational and programmatic support, and access to employees of the PBC.</p></li><li><p>Within one year of the recapitalization, the NFP Board will have at least two directors (including the Chair of the Safety and Security Committee) who will not serve on the PBC Board.</p></li><li><p>The Attorney General will be provided with advance notice of significant changes in corporate governance.</p></li></ul></blockquote><p>What did California get?</p><p><a href="https://oag.ca.gov/system/files/attachments/press-docs/Final%20Executed%20MOU%20Between%20OpenAI%20and%20California%20AG%20re%20Notice%20of%20Conditions%20of%20Non-Objection%20%2810.27.2025%29%20%28Signed%20by%20OpenAI%29%20%28Signed%20by%20CA%20DOJ%29.pdf" rel="">California also has its own Memorandum of Understanding</a><span>. It talks a lot in its declarations about California in particular, how OpenAI creates California jobs and economic activity (and ‘problem solving’?) and is committed to doing more of this and bringing benefits and deepening its commitment to the state in particular.</span></p><p>The whole claim via Tweet by Sam Altman that he did not threaten to leave California is raising questions supposedly answered by his Tweet. At this level you perhaps do not need to make your threats explicit. </p><p><span>The actual list </span><a href="https://x.com/robertwiblin/status/1983258006226907230" rel="">seems pretty good, though</a><span>? Here’s a full paraphrased list, some of which overlaps with Delaware’s announcement above, but which is more complete. </span></p><ol><li><p>Staying in California and expanding the California footprint.</p></li><li><p>The NFP (not for profit) retains control as long as they continue to hold ‘class N common stock’ which only they can choose to give up. What happens if Altman wants that?</p></li><li><p>The PBC and NFP missions will be identical.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://openai.com/charter" rel="">The OpenAI charter</a><span> will be published. Check.</span></p></li><li><p>The NFP Board owes fiduciary duties to the NFP, Mission and public beneficiaries of the NFP. I notice it doesn’t say ‘exclusively’ here.</p></li><li><p>The board shall carry out the charitable purpose (already presumably required).</p></li><li><p>No cheating clause: While the PBC holds Class N Common Stock (again, what happens if Altman tries to end this?) the NFP must approve in advance in writing any amendments to the PBC’s corporate governance guidelines or the mission, any Deemed Liquidation Event, or any sale of material assets of the PBC, or any additional issue of shares of Class N common stock.</p><ol><li><p>The PBC can issue Class B common stock, but they can’t let the Bs vote.</p></li></ol></li><li><p> PBC board and Safety and Security Committee (SSC) must only consider the mission with respect to safety and security issues. The chair of the SSC must be on the NFP board and not the PBC board, but can attend all PBC board meetings and gets all PBC safety and security related information.</p><ol><li><p>In particular, the SSC cannot consider shareholder returns, competitive pressures, financial implications or market timing.</p><ol><li><p>It seems impossible this will 100% be followed, but it helps.</p></li></ol></li></ol></li><li><p>The SSC is a committee of the NFP and oversees safety and security. </p></li><li><p>The SSC can require mitigations up to and including halting releases, without formal justification. </p><ol><li><p>“The NFP will provide advance notice to the Attorney General of any material changes to the SSC’s authority.” This is good but worrisome to see, you know?</p></li></ol></li><li><p>“OpenAI will continue to undertake measures to mitigate risks to teens and others in connection with the development and deployment of AI and of AGI.” </p><ol><li><p>I mean, I would hope they were going to do that anyway.</p></li></ol></li><li><p>The PBC shall give the NFP all reasonable access to services and resources without compensation as needed for the mission. </p></li><li><p>Within a year at least one NFP director, in addition to the SSC chair, will serve only on the NFP board (so at least two directors must be different).</p></li><li><p>The PBC board must be majority independent directors. </p></li><li><p>The PBC will have various good corporate governance things.</p></li><li><p>The PBC will publish a yearly report on its progress in its mission.</p></li><li><p>The NFP Board’s Mission and Strategy Commission will meet with the California AG semi-annually and individual members will be available as needed.</p></li><li><p>The NFP will provide 21 days notice before consenting to changes of PBC control or mission, or any threat to the Class N share rights, or any relocation outside of California.</p></li><li><p>The California AG can review, and hire experts to help review, anything requiring such notice, and get paid by NFP for doing so. </p></li><li><p>Those on both NFP and PBC boards get annual fiduciary duty training.</p></li><li><p>The board represents that the recapitalization is fair (whoops), and that they’ve disclosed everything relevant (?), so the AG will also not object.</p></li><li><p>This only impacts the parties to the MOU, others retain all rights. Disputes resolved in the courts of San Francisco, these are the whole terms, we all have the authority to do this, effective as of signing, AG is relying on OpenAI’s representations and the AG retains all rights and waive none as per usual.</p></li></ol><p><span>Also, it’s not even listed in the memo, but </span><a href="https://x.com/_NathanCalvin/status/1983992985533739395" rel="">the ‘merge and assist’ clause was preserved</a><span>, meaning OpenAI commits to join forces with any ‘safety-conscious’ rival that has a good chance of reaching OpenAI’s goal of creating AGI within a two-year time frame. I don’t actually expect an OpenAI-Anthropic merger to happen, but it’s a nice extra bit of optionality.  </span></p><p><span>This is better than I expected, </span><a href="https://x.com/BenShindel/status/1983511688470036676" rel="">and as Ben Shindel points out better than many traders expected</a><span>. This actually does have real teeth, and it was plausible that without pressure there would have been no teeth at all. </span></p><p>It grants the NFP the sole power to appoint and remove directors, and requiring them not to consider the for-profit mission in safety contexts. The explicit granting of the power to halt deployments and mandate mitigations, without having to cite any particular justification and without respect to profitability, is highly welcome, if structured in a functional fashion. </p><p><span>It is remarkable how little many expected to get. </span><a href="https://x.com/GarrisonLovely/status/1983307624423805300" rel="">For example, here’s Todor Markov, who didn’t even expect the NFP to be able to replace directors at all</a><span>. If you can’t do that, you’re basically dead in the water. </span></p><p>I am not a lawyer, but my understanding is that the ‘no cheating around this’ clauses are about as robust as one could reasonably hope for them to be. </p><p><span>It’s still, as Garrison Lovely calls it, </span><a href="https://x.com/GarrisonLovely/status/1983307655889498303" rel="">‘on paper’ governance</a><span>. Sometimes that means governance in practice. Sometimes it doesn’t. As we have learned. </span></p><p>The distinction between the boards still means there is an additional level removed between the PBC and the NFP. In a fast moving situation, this makes a big difference, and the NFP likely would have to depend on its enumerated additional powers being respected. I would very much have liked them to include appointing or firing the CEO directly.</p><p>Whether this overall ‘counts as a good deal’ depends on your baseline. It’s definitely a ‘good deal’ versus what our realpolitik expectations projected. One can argue that if the control rights really are sufficiently robust over time, that the decline in dollar value for the nonprofit is not the important thing here. </p><p>The counterargument to that is both that those resources could do a lot of good over time, and also that giving up the financial rights has a way of leading to further giving up control rights, even if the current provisions are good. </p><p>Similarly to many issues of AI alignment, if an entity has ‘unnatural’ control, or ‘unnatural’ profit interests, then there are strong forces that continuously try to take that control away. As we have already seen. </p><p>Unless Altman genuinely wants to be controlled, the nonprofit will always be under attack, where at every move we fight to hold its ground. On a long enough time frame, that becomes a losing battle.</p><p>Right now, the OpenAI NFP board is essentially captured by Altman, and also identical to the PBC board. They will become somewhat different, but no matter what it only matters if the PBC board actually tries to fulfill its fiduciary duties rather than being a rubber stamp. </p><p>One could argue that all of this matters little, since the boards will both be under Altman’s control and likely overlap quite a lot, and they were already ignoring their duties to the nonprofit. </p><blockquote><p><a href="https://apnews.com/article/openai-chatgpt-nonprofit-microsoft-c661df3242766d6b0ddbab401ad1fd84" rel="">Robert Weissman, co-president of the nonprofit Public Citizen</a><span>, said this arrangement does not guarantee the nonprofit independence, likening it to a corporate foundation that will serve the interests of the for profit.</span></p><p>Even as the nonprofit’s board may technically remain in control, Weissman said that control “is illusory because there is no evidence of the nonprofit ever imposing its values on the for profit.”</p></blockquote><p>So yes, there is that. </p><p>They claim to now be a public benefit corporation, OpenAI Group PBC.</p><blockquote><p>OpenAI: The for-profit is now a public benefit corporation, called OpenAI Group PBC, which—unlike a conventional corporation—is required to advance its stated mission and consider the broader interests of all stakeholders, ensuring the company’s mission and commercial success advance together.</p></blockquote><p>This is a mischaracterization of how PBCs work. It’s more like the flip side of this. A conventional corporation is supposed to maximize profits and can be sued if it goes too far in not doing that. Unlike a conventional corporation, a PBC is allowed to consider those broader interests to a greater extent, but it is not in practice ‘required’ to do anything other than maximize profits.</p><p>One particular control right is the special duty to the mission, especially via the safety and security committee. How much will they attempt to downgrade the scope of that?</p><blockquote><p><a href="https://www.themidasproject.com/article-list/the-midas-project-statement-on-openai-s-restructuring" rel="">The Midas Project</a><span>: However, the effectiveness of this safeguard will depend entirely on how broadly “safety and security issues” are defined in practice. It would not be surprising to see OpenAI attempt to classify most business decisions—pricing, partnerships, deployment timelines, compute allocation—as falling outside this category. </span></p><p>This would allow shareholder interests to determine the majority of corporate strategy while minimizing the mission-only standard to apply to an artificially narrow set of decisions they deem easy or costless.</p></blockquote><p><a href="https://openai.com/index/next-chapter-of-microsoft-openai-partnership/" rel="">They have an announcement about that too</a><span>.</span></p><blockquote><p>OpenAI: First, Microsoft supports the OpenAI board moving forward with formation of a public benefit corporation (PBC) and recapitalization.</p><p>Following the recapitalization, Microsoft holds an investment in OpenAI Group PBC valued at approximately $135 billion, representing roughly 27 percent on an as-converted diluted basis, inclusive of all owners—employees, investors, and the OpenAI Foundation. Excluding the impact of OpenAI’s recent funding rounds, Microsoft held a 32.5 percent stake on an as-converted basis in the OpenAI for-profit.</p></blockquote><p>Anyone else notice something funky here? OpenAI’s nonprofit has had its previous rights expropriated, and been given 26% of OpenAI’s shares in return. If Microsoft had 32.5% of the company excluding the nonprofit’s rights before that happened, then that should give them 24% of the new OpenAI. Instead they have 27%. </p><p>I don’t know anything nonpublic on this, but it sure looks a lot like Microsoft insisted they have a bigger share than the nonprofit (27% vs. 26%) and this was used to help justify this expropriation and a transfer of additional shares to Microsoft.</p><p>In exchange, Microsoft gave up various choke points it held over OpenAI, including potential objections to the conversion, and clarified points of dispute.</p><p>Microsoft got some upgrades in here as well.</p><blockquote><ol><li><p>Once AGI is declared by OpenAI, that declaration will now be verified by an independent expert panel.</p></li><li><p>Microsoft’s IP rights for both models and products are extended through 2032 and now includes models post-AGI, with appropriate safety guardrails.</p></li><li><p>Microsoft’s IP rights to research, defined as the confidential methods used in the development of models and systems, will remain until either the expert panel verifies AGI or through 2030, whichever is first.

In particular, AGI used to be something OpenAI seemed like it could simply declare (you know, like war or the defense production act) and now it needs to be verified by an ‘expert panel’ which implies there is additional language I’d very much like to see. </p><p>In other ways OpenAI comes out ahead. An incremental $250B of Azure services sounds like a lot but I’m guessing both sides are happy with that number. Getting rid of the right of first refusal is big, as is having their non-API products free and clear. Getting hardware products fully clear of Microsoft is a big deal for the Ives project.</p><p>My overall take here is this was one of those broad negotiations where everything trades off, nothing is done until everything is done, and there was a very wide ZOPA (zone of possible agreement) since OpenAI really needed to make a deal. </p><p>In theory govern the OpenAI PBC. I have my doubts about that.</p><p>What they do have is a nominal pile of cash. What are they going to do with it to supposedly ensure that AGI goes well for humanity? </p><p><span>The default, </span><a href="https://www.obsolete.pub/p/the-end-of-openais-nonprofit-era" rel="">as Garrison Lovely predicted a while back</a><span>, is that the nonprofit will essentially buy OpenAI services for nonprofits and others, recapture much of the value and serve as a form of indulgences, marketing and way to satisfy critics, which may or may not do some good along the way. </span></p><p><a href="https://openai.com/index/50-million-fund-to-build-with-communities/" rel="">The initial $50 million spend looked a lot like exactly this</a><span>. </span></p><p>Their new ‘initial focus’ for $25 billion will be in these two areas:</p><blockquote><ul><li><p><strong>Health and curing diseases.</strong><span> The OpenAI Foundation will fund work to accelerate health breakthroughs so everyone can benefit from faster diagnostics, better treatments, and cures.

There’s nothing wrong with health and curing diseases, but pushing this now does not advance the fundamental mission of OpenAI. They are going to start with, essentially, doing AI capabilities research and diffusion in health, and funding scientists to do AI-enabled research. A lot of this will likely fall right back into OpenAI and be good PR.</p><p>Again, that’s a net positive thing to do, happy to see it done, but that’s not the mission.</p><p>Technical solutions to AI resilience could potentially at least be useful AI safety work to some extent. With a presumed ~$12 billion this is a vast overconcentration of safety efforts into things that are worth doing but ultimately don’t seem likely to be determining factors. Note how Altman described it in his tl;dr from the Q&amp;A:</p><blockquote><p>Sam Altman: The nonprofit is initially committing $25 billion to health and curing disease, and AI resilience (all of the things that could help society have a successful transition to a post-AGI world, including technical safety but also things like economic impact, cyber security, and much more). The nonprofit now has the ability to actually deploy capital relatively quickly, unlike before.</p></blockquote><p>This is now infinitely broad. It could be addressing ‘economic impact’ and be basically a normal (ineffective) charity, or one that intervenes mostly by giving OpenAI services to normal nonprofits. It could be mostly spent on valuable technical safety, and be on the most important charitable initiatives in the world. It could be anything in between, in any distribution. We don’t know. </p><p>My default assumption is that this is primarily going to be about mundane safety or even fall short of that, and make the near term world better, perhaps importantly better, but do little to guard against the dangers or downsides of AGI or superintelligence, and again largely be a de facto customer of OpenAI. </p><p>There’s nothing wrong with mundane risk mitigation or defense in depth, and nothing wrong with helping people who need a hand, but if your plan is ‘oh we will make things resilient and it will work out’ then you have no plan. </p><p>That doesn’t mean this will be low impact, or that what OpenAI left the nonprofit with is chump change. </p><p>I also don’t want to knock the size of this pool. The previous nonprofit initiative was $50 million, which can do a lot of good if spent well (in that case, I don’t think it was) but in this context $50 million chump change. </p><p>Whereas $25 billion? Okay, yeah, we are talking real money. That can move needles, if the money actually gets spent in short order. If it’s $25 billion as a de facto endowment spent down over a long time, then this matters and counts for a lot less.</p><p>The warrants are quite far out of the money and the NFP should have gotten far more stock than it did, but 26% (worth $130 billion or more) remains a lot of equity. You can do quite a lot of good in a variety of places with that money. The board of directors of the nonprofit is highly qualified if they want to execute on that. It also is highly qualified to effectively shuttle much of that money right back to OpenAI’s for profit, if that’s what they mainly want to do. </p><p>It won’t help much with the whole ‘not dying’ or ‘AGI goes well for humanity’ missions, but other things matter too. </p><p><span>Not entirely. As Garrison Lovely notes, </span><a href="https://www.obsolete.pub/p/the-end-of-openais-nonprofit-era" rel="">all these sign-offs are provisional</a><span>, and there are other lawsuits and the potential for other lawsuits. In a world where Elon Musk’s payouts can get crawled back, I wouldn’t be too confident that this conversation sticks. It’s not like the Delaware AG drives most objections to corporate actions.</span></p><p><span>The last major obstacle is the Elon Musk lawsuit, where standing is at issue but the judge has made clear </span><a href="https://www.obsolete.pub/p/what-the-headlines-miss-about-the" rel="">that the suit otherwise has merit</a><span>. There might be other lawsuits on the horizon. But yeah, probably this is happening. </span></p><p>So this is the world we live in. We need to make the most of it. </p></div></article></div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div></div>]]></description>

<h2 id="a-zombie-proposal-that-refuses-to-die">A zombie proposal that refuses to die</h2>

<p>Since its introduction in 2022, Chat Control has become what privacy advocates call a <em>zombie proposal</em>, repeatedly resurrected despite consistent opposition from civil society, technical experts, and the public. The <strong>Electronic Frontier Foundation</strong> and <a href="https://www.globalencryption.org/2024/05/joint-statement-on-the-dangers-of-the-may-2024-council-of-the-eu-compromise-proposal-on-eu-csam/">more than 80 civil society organizations</a> have strongly opposed the legislation, which would mandate client-side scanning of encrypted communications under the guise of combating child sexual abuse material.</p>

<p>The pattern has become predictable. EU lawmakers introduce the proposal, claiming it includes safeguards for privacy. Technical experts explain why those safeguards are illusory. Public pressure mounts. The proposal is withdrawn or modified. Then, after a brief hiatus, it returns with minor tweaks, and the cycle begins anew. This latest withdrawal by the <strong>Danish presidency</strong> follows the same script, but the underlying issues remain unresolved.</p>

<p>What makes this particularly frustrating is that the fundamental problem with Chat Control has never been addressed. The proposal seeks to create what privacy experts call a “backdoor” into encryption, allowing authorities to scan messages before they’re encrypted or after they’re decrypted. Proponents argue this preserves encryption while enabling content moderation, but this reveals a <em>dangerous misunderstanding</em> of how encryption actually works. Creating any mechanism to access encrypted content inherently weakens the entire system, making it vulnerable not just to authorized access but to malicious actors as well.</p>

<h2 id="the-technical-impossibility-of-safe-scanning">The technical impossibility of “safe” scanning</h2>

<p>The core issue with Chat Control and similar proposals lies in a fundamental misunderstanding of encryption technology. End-to-end encryption works because only the sender and recipient possess the keys to decrypt messages. Any third party, whether a government agency or a tech company, cannot read the contents. This is not a design choice but a mathematical certainty that ensures the security of billions of communications daily.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/11/why-adding-client-side-scanning-breaks-end-end-encryption">Client-side scanning</a>, the technical approach favored by Chat Control advocates, attempts to circumvent this limitation by analyzing messages on users’ devices before encryption or after decryption. While this might sound like a clever workaround, it fundamentally breaks the security model of encryption. If a device can scan and report on message content, so can malware, hackers, or authoritarian governments who might compel tech companies to expand the scope of scanning.</p>

<p>Security researchers have repeatedly demonstrated that there is <em>no way to create a scanning system</em> that only works for “good guys.” <strong>Apple</strong> learned this lesson the hard way in 2021 when it proposed a similar system for detecting child abuse imagery in iCloud photos. The backlash from security experts was swift and devastating, forcing the company to abandon the plan. The same security vulnerabilities that would enable Chat Control would inevitably be exploited by malicious actors, putting everyone at greater risk.</p>

<p>Moreover, the scope creep inherent in surveillance technologies is well documented. A system initially designed to detect illegal content could easily be expanded to monitor political dissent, religious expression, or any other communication governments deem problematic. <strong>Countries around the world</strong> are watching the EU’s actions closely. If Chat Control were to pass, it would set a dangerous precedent that authoritarian regimes would eagerly exploit, claiming they’re simply following Europe’s lead in implementing “reasonable” content moderation.</p>

<h2 id="public-pressure-and-the-power-of-resistance">Public pressure and the power of resistance</h2>

<p>The withdrawal of Chat Control demonstrates the <em>critical importance of sustained public engagement</em> in technology policy. Unlike previous instances where technical proposals sailed through legislative processes with little public awareness, this fight has been characterized by unprecedented mobilization from civil society organizations, technology companies, security researchers, and ordinary citizens concerned about their digital rights.</p>

<p>Organizations like the <strong>Electronic Frontier Foundation</strong>, <strong>European Digital Rights</strong>, and numerous national privacy advocacy groups have played a crucial role in educating the public about the risks of Chat Control. Their efforts have included detailed technical explanations, legal analysis, and coordination of opposition campaigns that have reached millions of Europeans. This groundswell of opposition has made it politically toxic for lawmakers to support the proposal, at least in its current form.</p>

<p>The effectiveness of this resistance offers important lessons for future policy battles. First, technical expertise matters. When security researchers speak with a unified voice about the impossibility of safe backdoors, it becomes harder for politicians to dismiss concerns as alarmist. Second, coalition-building across different sectors strengthens opposition. When <a href="https://edri.org/our-work/chat-control-what-is-actually-going-on/">civil liberties groups</a>, tech companies, and individual users all oppose a policy, it suggests the problems are real and widespread. Third, sustained pressure is essential because, as Chat Control demonstrates, bad proposals rarely die on the first attempt.</p>

<p>However, this victory should be tempered with realism. The forces pushing for Chat Control have not given up, and the underlying political dynamics that gave rise to the proposal remain unchanged. Politicians face genuine pressure to be seen as “doing something” about online harms, particularly regarding child safety. Until alternative approaches that don’t compromise encryption gain political traction, proposals like Chat Control will continue to resurface.</p>

<h2 id="the-path-forward-requires-education-and-alternatives">The path forward requires education and alternatives</h2>

<p>The repeated resurrection of Chat Control points to a deeper problem in how technology policy is made. Many lawmakers genuinely believe they can have both strong encryption and government access to encrypted content. This belief persists despite unanimous opposition from the cryptographic community because the political incentives favor appearing tough on crime over understanding complex technical realities.</p>

<p>Breaking this cycle requires a <em>fundamental shift in how we approach online safety</em>. Rather than seeking technological magic bullets that promise security without trade-offs, policymakers need to invest in solutions that actually work. This includes better funding for law enforcement training and tools that don’t require breaking encryption, improved international cooperation on criminal investigations, and addressing the root causes of online exploitation through social programs and education.</p>

<p><strong>Technology companies</strong> also bear responsibility for developing and promoting genuinely privacy-preserving safety features. End-to-end encrypted platforms can implement abuse prevention measures that don’t involve content scanning, such as metadata analysis, user reporting systems, and account-level restrictions for suspicious behavior. While these approaches may be less comprehensive than mass surveillance, they achieve meaningful safety improvements without the catastrophic privacy trade-offs of backdoors.</p>

<p>Looking ahead, the privacy community cannot simply celebrate the withdrawal of Chat Control and move on. The next presidency of the EU Council will bring new opportunities for the proposal to resurface in yet another modified form. Sustained vigilance, continued public education, and proactive development of alternative safety measures will be essential. The fight to protect encryption is not a single battle but an ongoing campaign that requires long-term commitment from everyone who values digital privacy and security.</p>

<p>The withdrawal of Chat Control is a victory, but it’s a temporary one. The fundamental challenge remains: convincing policymakers that some trade-offs are not worth making, and that breaking encryption to combat illegal content creates far more problems than it solves. Until that message truly sinks in, the zombie proposal will keep rising from the grave, and the privacy community must remain ready to defeat it again and again.</p>

<p>cabal won’t work in the browser due to lack of process support; but it’s possible to use <code>wasm32-wasi-cabal</code> to precompile some third party packages to wasm and make this playground support them as well.</p>

<p>thanks for the reports! a few seconds of freeze during start-time is expected, since it needs to download ~50M of a rootfs tarball and extract it, then link the ghc library and all its dependencies. as for safari, it’s strange since i i just landed a workaround for a webkit bug that breaks the wasm dynamic linker a few days ago, i’ll take a closer look later.</p>

<p>the ghc library already mostly works when compiled to wasm, and it can parse/typecheck/desugar stuff. the bottleneck is the linker/loader part, for it to be useful it needs to be able to dynamically load and execute haskell code. i landed a couple of ghc patches recently to push towards that direction, and the last one that gets us towards the haskell playground (not landed yet) is <a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/15000" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Draft: Support running GHC fully client-side in the browser (!15000) · Merge requests · Glasgow Haskell Compiler / GHC · GitLab</a></p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1oj52xx/tech_companies_are_firing_everyone_to_fund_ai_but/">https://old.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1oj52xx/tech_companies_are_firing_everyone_to_fund_ai_but/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45782267">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>So, Amazon announced they're laying off 30k people. This is set to be the largest layoff in the company’s history. That's on top of Microsoft cutting 15k, Meta cutting 3.6k and Google cutting hundreds this year. Over 180,000 tech workers laid off in 2025 alone.</p>

<p>But here's what nobody's connecting and it's actually insane when you connect all the dots. These same companies are spending over $300 billion on AI this year. So they're firing people to "free up capital for AI investments." Then spending that money buying stuff from each other. And none of it's making them money yet.</p>

<p>Let me break down what's actually happening:</p>

<p>Layoff is just an excuse - Every company's using the same line. "We're restructuring for AI." "AI will handle these tasks now." "We need to fund AI initiatives."</p>

<p>Zuckerberg said AI could be ready this year to "effectively be a sort of mid-level engineer capable of writing code.", Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said "we will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today.", Salesforce laid off 4,000 customer support staff and their CEO literally said it was because of "increasing AI adoption.", IBM cut 8,000 jobs in HR because "AI tools take over routine administrative tasks."</p>

<p>So the story is AI's now capable of doing these jobs right? That's why they gotta fire everyone. Except the thing is - They're not saving that money. They're spending way more than they're saving.</p>

<p>and <strong>where the money is really going?</strong> They're buying from each other - </p>

<ul>
<li>Microsoft buys Nvidia chips. Rents cloud capacity from Amazon AWS. Buys software from other companies. </li>
<li>Amazon buys Nvidia chips. Uses Microsoft software. Rents capacity they can't build fast enough.</li>
<li>Meta buys Nvidia chips. Rents infrastructure from Google Cloud and AWS</li>
<li>Apple doesn't even build AI infrastructure. They rent everything from Google AWS and Azure. So Apple pays Google. Google pays Nvidia. Nvidia pays TSMC for manufacturing. Microsoft pays Amazon. Amazon pays Microsoft. Meta pays everyone.</li>
</ul>

<p>They're literally just passing money in circles. The "Magnificent 7" stocks/companies Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta and Tesla, have a combined market cap of $17 trillion. For reference US GDP is $30 trillion. But their combined revenue in 2024? $2.2 trillion. Net profit? around $550 billion.</p>

<p>They're trading at an average P/E ratio of 35. That means investors are paying $35 for every $1 of profit. The S&amp;P 500 without them? P/E of 15.5. Why the premium? Because everyone believes AI is going to make them wildly profitable in the future.</p>

<p>But right now they're just spending money. On each other. Creating the illusion of growth.</p>

<p>But here's the trap. These companies CAN'T stop now. Because if any of them stops their stock crashes. Investors think they're giving up on AI and falling behind. So they're locked in an arms race. Have to keep spending to maintain stock prices even if the spending doesn't generate returns.</p>

<p>Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet Meta increased capex by 42% in 2024. Planning another 17% increase in 2025. $244 billion total spend next year across just those 4.</p>

<p>and it's going to Mostly Nvidia. Who uses it to buy manufacturing from TSMC. Who uses it to buy equipment from ASML. Money moving in circles.</p>

<p><strong>Connecting the dots</strong></p>

<p>So let me spell this out. These companies are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Laying off hundreds of thousands of workers to "fund AI"</li>
<li>Spending way more on AI than they're saving from layoffs</li>
<li>Buying most of that AI infrastructure from each other</li>
<li>Not making any actual profit from AI yet</li>
<li>Can't stop spending or their stocks crash</li>
<li>Creating the illusion of economic growth through spending alone</li>
</ol>

<p>So when you hear "stock market hit a new record" that means these 7 companies went up. The other 493? They contributed 46%. And why did these 7 go up? Because they're spending hundreds of billions on AI. Which inflates their valuations. Which makes the S&amp;P go up. Which makes everyone think the economy's great. Your 401k? Probably heavy in S&amp;P 500 index funds. Which means 37% of your retirement is bet on these 7 companies and their AI spending paying off eventually.</p>

<p>And we're all just along for the ride.</p>

<p><strong>TLDR</strong></p>

<p>Amazon laid off 30,000 people yesterday. Microsoft 15,000 this year. Meta 3,600. Intel 22,000. Over 180,000 tech workers fired in 2025. All saying it's to "fund AI initiatives." But they're spending $300B+ on AI way more than they're saving from layoffs. Most of that money going to each other in circles. Apple rents AI infrastructure from Google AWS Azure. Everyone buys Nvidia chips. They pay each other for cloud capacity. AI spending added 0.5% to GDP. Without it GDP would've grown 0.6%. Only Meta showing actual AI revenue. Everyone else just spending hoping it pays off. Goldman Sachs and Sequoia reports say ROI is nonexistent so far. But they can't stop spending or stocks crash. Locked in arms race. The 7 biggest tech companies are 37% of S&amp;P 500. Made up 54% of gains in 2024. Your 401k is probably 37% bet on AI spending paying off. If it doesn't they're massively overvalued at 35x earnings. Firing people to fund buying stuff from each other while making no profit yet.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-1740">

		<p><span>arXiv’s computer science (CS) category has updated its moderation practice with respect to review (or survey) articles and position papers. Before being considered for submission to arXiv’s CS category, review articles and position papers must now be accepted at a journal or a conference and complete successful peer review. When submitting review articles or position papers, authors must include documentation of successful peer review to receive full consideration. Review/survey articles or position papers submitted to arXiv without this documentation will be likely to be rejected and not appear on arXiv.</span><span><br>
</span><span><br>
</span><span>This change is being implemented due to the unmanageable influx of review articles and position papers to arXiv CS.</span></p>
<p><b>Is this a policy change?</b></p>
<p><span>Technically, no! If you take a look at </span><a href="https://info.arxiv.org/help/policies/content-types.html"><span>arXiv’s policies for specific content types</span></a><span> you’ll notice that review articles and position papers are not (and have never been) listed as part of the accepted content types. Review articles and position papers have, in the past, only been accepted at moderator discretion, because the few we received were of high quality and of interest to arXiv readers and the scientific community at large.</span></p>
<p><b>Why is the arXiv CS category making this change?</b></p>
<p><span>In the past few years, arXiv has been flooded with papers. Generative AI / large language models have added to this flood by making papers – especially papers not introducing new research results – fast and easy to write. While categories across arXiv have all seen a major increase in submissions, it’s particularly pronounced in arXiv’s CS category.</span></p>
<p><span>The goal of this change of practice is to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Help arXiv readers more easily find valuable review articles and position papers written by subject matter experts</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Free up moderators to focus on the content types officially accepted by arXiv, reduce submission hold times, and keep the pace of scientific discovery going!</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span><strong>Above all, the core purpose of arXiv is to share research papers and facilitate scientific discovery quickly and freely. </strong>We are making this change in support of that mission.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In the past, arXiv CS received a relatively small amount of review or survey articles, and those we did receive were of extremely high quality, written by senior researchers at the request of publications like Annual Reviews, Proceedings of the IEEE, and Computing Surveys. Position paper submissions to arXiv were similarly rare, and usually produced by scientific societies or government study groups (for example,the Computing Research Association of the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine).&nbsp; While, as now, these papers were not content types officially accepted by arXiv, the arXiv moderators accepted them because of their scholarly value to the research community.</span></p>
<p><span>Fast forward to present day – submissions to arXiv in general have risen dramatically, and we now receive hundreds of review articles every month. The advent of large language models have made this type of content relatively easy to churn out on demand, and the majority of the review articles we receive are little more than annotated bibliographies, with no substantial discussion of open research issues.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>arXiv believes that there are position papers and review articles that are of value to the scientific community, and we would like to be able to share them on arXiv. However, our team of volunteer moderators do not have the time or bandwidth to review the hundreds of these articles we receive without taking time away from our core purpose, which is to share research articles.</span></p>
<p><span>Reasonable and trusted outside refereed venues already exist (conferences and journals) which solicit position papers and review articles on subjects of concern or interest to our readers (such as concerns over privacy, ethics, safety, and security of recent CS technologies, particularly applications of artificial intelligence) and as part of that process, they conduct in-depth review to assure quality, evidential support of opinions, and scholarly value. Since arXiv does not have the resources to conduct this quality-control in-house for content types that we do not officially accept, this change of practice is allowing us to rely on these refereed venues to do so for us so that we can still share position papers and review articles of value on arXiv.</span></p>
<p><b>How do I submit my review article or position paper to arXiv? </b><span>Before submission to arXiv, have your review article or position paper accepted to a refereed venue with peer review like a journal or a conference.</span> <span>Review articles or position papers must be accepted to a journal or conference before being submitted to arXiv and you must have documentation of complete and successful peer review.</span></p>
<p><span>Please note: the review conducted at conference workshops generally does not meet the same standard of rigor of traditional peer review and is not enough to have your review article or position paper accepted to arXiv. </span></p>
<p><b>How do I show my review article or position paper has successfully completed peer review? </b><span>When you submit to arXiv, please include the peer reviewed journal reference and DOI metadata. If you do not provide this, your review article or position paper will likely be rejected.</span></p>
<p><b>Can I resubmit my position paper or review article after being rejected? </b><span>If your position paper or review article was rejected because it did not complete a successful peer review process, you can submit an appeal request to resubmit if your article has since completed a successful peer review process. Do not resubmit your position paper or review article without an accepted appeal. Here are the </span><a href="https://info.arxiv.org/help/moderation/appeals.html"><span>instructions for how to appeal.</span></a></p>
<p><b>I have a scientific paper studying the impact of science and technology in society. Can I submit this to arXiv without peer review? </b><span>Yes, arXiv has always released these types of scientific papers, for example in cs.CY or physics.soc-ph. These are scientific research papers and are not subject to this moderation practice change.</span></p>
<p><b>Will other categories on arXiv also change their practice re: review articles and position papers? </b><span>Each category of arXiv has different moderators, who are subject matter experts with a terminal degree in their particular subject, to best serve the scholarly pursuits, goals, and standards of their category. While all moderators adhere to arXiv policy, the only policy arXiv has in place with regard to review articles and position papers is that they are not a generally accepted content type. The goal of the moderators of each category is to make sure the work being submitted is actually science, and that it is of potential interest to the scientific community. If other categories see a similar rise in LLM-written review articles and position papers, they may choose to change their moderation practices in a similar manner to better serve arXiv authors and readers. We will make these updates public if and when they do occur.</span></p>

<p dir="auto"><code>catten</code> is an operating system kernel developed as a key component of the CharlotteOS project but it is designed to be flexible enough that we hope it can also find use in many other places. It seeks to be a monolithic kernel with low-level system call interfaces that borrows ideas from exokernels and other novel systems like Plan 9 and Fuchsia. Its design allows for almost any higher level interface to be layered on top and also includes a typesafe system namespace (akin to the namespaces found in Fuschsia and Plan 9 but more flexible and typesafe) with URIs as paths which has the added benefit of allowing access to the namespace of another host over a network without having to mount anything locally all while being secured by granular capabilities and a persistent mandatory access control policy.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://jellyfin.org/posts/SQLite-locking/">https://jellyfin.org/posts/SQLite-locking/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45781298">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="__blog-post-container"><p>SQLite is a powerful database engine, but due to its design, it has limitations that should not be overlooked.</p>
<p>Jellyfin has used a SQLite-based database for storing most of its data for years, but it has also encountered issues on many systems. In this blog post, I will explain how we address these limitations and how developers using SQLite can apply the same solutions.</p>
<p>This will be a technical blog post intended for developers and everyone wanting to learn about concurrency.</p>
<p>Also Jellyfin's implementation of locking for SQLite should be fairly easy to be implemented into another EF Core application if you are facing the same issue.</p>
<p>- JPVenson</p>
<!-- -->
<h2 id="the-premise">The Premise<a href="#the-premise" aria-label="Direct link to The Premise" title="Direct link to The Premise" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>SQLite is a file-based database engine running within your application and allows you to store data in a relational structure.
Overall it gives your application the means of storing structured data as a single file and without having to depend on another application to do so.
Naturally this also comes at a price. If your application fully manages this file, the assumption must be made that your application is the sole owner of this file, and nobody else will tinker with it while you are writing data to it.</p>
<p>So an application that wants to use SQLite as its database needs to be the only one accessing it.
Having established this fact, an important thought arises: if only a single write operation should be performed on a single file at a time, this rule must also apply to operations within the same application.</p>
<h2 id="the-w-a-l-mode">The W-A-L mode<a href="#the-w-a-l-mode" aria-label="Direct link to The W-A-L mode" title="Direct link to The W-A-L mode" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>SQLite has a feature that tries to get around this limitation: the Write-Ahead-Log (WAL).
The WAL is a separate file that acts as a journal of operations that should be applied to an SQLite file.
This allows multiple parallel writes to take place and get enqueued into the WAL.
When another part of the application wants to read data, it reads from the actual database, then scans the WAL for modifications and applies them on the fly.
This is not a foolproof solution; there are still scenarios where WAL does not prevent locking conflicts.</p>
<h2 id="sqlite-transactions">SQLite transactions<a href="#sqlite-transactions" aria-label="Direct link to SQLite transactions" title="Direct link to SQLite transactions" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>A transaction is supposed to ensure two things.
Modifications made within a transaction can be reverted, either when something goes wrong or when the application decides it should and optionally a transaction may also block other readers from reading data that is modified within a transaction.
This is where it gets spicy and we come to the real reason why I am writing this blog post.
For some reason on some systems that run Jellyfin when a transaction takes place the SQLite engine reports the database is locked and instead of waiting for the transaction to be resolved the engine refuses to wait and just crashes.
This seems to be a not uncommon issue and there are many reports to be found on the issue.</p>
<p>The factor that makes this issue so bad is that it does not happen reliably. So far we only have one team member where this can be (somewhat) reliably be reproduced which makes this an even worse a bug.
From the reports this issue happens across all operating systems, drive speeds and with or without virtualization.
So we do not have any deciding factor identified that even contributes to the likelihood of the issue happening.</p>
<h2 id="the-jellyfin-factor">The Jellyfin factor<a href="#the-jellyfin-factor" aria-label="Direct link to The Jellyfin factor" title="Direct link to The Jellyfin factor" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Having established the general theory on how SQLite behaves, we also have to look at the specifics of Jellyfins usage of SQLite.
During normal operations on a recommended setup (Non-Networked Storage and preferably SSD) its unusual for any problems to arise, however the way Jellyfin utilises the SQLite db up to 10.11 is very suboptimal.
In versions prior to 10.11 Jellyfin had a bug in its parallel task limit which resulted in exponential overscheduling of library scan operations which hammered the database engine with thousands of parallel write requests that an SQLite engine is simply not able to handle.
While most SQLite engine implementations have retry behavior, they also have timeouts and checks in place to prevent limitless waiting so if we stress the engine enough, it just fails with an error.
That and very long running and frankly unoptimized transactions could lead to the database just being overloaded with requests and flaking out.</p>
<h2 id="the-solution">The solution<a href="#the-solution" aria-label="Direct link to The solution" title="Direct link to The solution" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Since we moved the codebase over to EF Core proper, we have the tools to actually do something about this as EF Core gives us a structured abstraction level.
EF Core supports a way of hooking into every command execution or transaction by creating <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/logging-events-diagnostics/interceptors" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Interceptors</a>.
With an interceptor we can finally do the straight forward idea of just "not" writing to the database in parallel in a transparent way to the caller.
The overall idea is to have multiple strategies of locking. Because all levels of synchronization will inevitably come at the cost of performance, we only want to do it when it is really necessary.
So, I decided on three locking strategies:</p>
<ol>
<li>No-Lock</li>
<li>Optimistic locking</li>
<li>Pessimistic locking</li>
</ol>
<p>As a default, the no-lock behavior does exactly what the name implies. Nothing. This is the default because my research shows that for 99% all of this is not an issue and every interaction at this level will slow down the whole application.</p>
<p>Both the optimistic and pessimistic behaviors use two interceptors—one for transactions and one for commands—and override <code>SaveChanges</code> in <code>JellyfinDbContext</code>.</p>
<h3 id="optimistic-locking-behavior">Optimistic locking behavior<a href="#optimistic-locking-behavior" aria-label="Direct link to Optimistic locking behavior" title="Direct link to Optimistic locking behavior" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>Optimistic locking means to assume the operation in question will succeed and only handle issues afterwards. In essence this can be boiled down to "Try and Retry and Retry ..." for a set number of times until either we succeed with the operation or fail entirely.
This still leaves the possibility that we will not actually be able to perform a write, but the introduced overhead is far less than the Pessimistic locking behavior.</p>
<p>The idea behind how this works is simple: every time two operations try to write to the database, one will always win. The other will fail, wait some time, then retry a few times.</p>
<p>Jellyfin uses the <code>Polly</code> library perform the retry behavior and will only retry operations it will find have been locked due to this exact issue.</p>
<h3 id="pessimistic-locking-behavior">Pessimistic locking behavior<a href="#pessimistic-locking-behavior" aria-label="Direct link to Pessimistic locking behavior" title="Direct link to Pessimistic locking behavior" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>Pessimistic locking always locks when a write to SQLite should be performed. Essentially every time an transaction is started or a write operation on the database is done though EF Core, Jellyfin will wait until all other read operations are finished and then block all other operations may they be read or write until the write in question has been performed.
This however means, that Jellyfin can only ever perform a single write to the database, even if it would technically does not need to.</p>
<p>In theory, an application should have no issue reading from table "Alice" while writing to table "Bob" however to eliminate all possible sources of concurrency related locking, Jellyfin will only ever allow a single write performed on its database in this mode.
While this will absolutely result in the most stable operation, it will undoubtedly also be the slowest.</p>
<p>Jellyfin uses a <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/runtime-libraries/system-threading-readerwriterlockslim" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ReaderWriterLockSlim</a> to lock the operations, that means we allow an unlimited number of reads to happen concurrently while only one write may ever be done on the database.</p>
<h3 id="the-future-smart-locking-behavior">The future Smart locking behavior<a href="#the-future-smart-locking-behavior" aria-label="Direct link to The future Smart locking behavior" title="Direct link to The future Smart locking behavior" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>In the future we might also consider combining both modes, to get the best of both worlds.</p>
<h2>The result</h2>
<p>Initial testing showed that with both modes, we had great success in handling the underlying issue. While we are not yet sure why this happens only on some systems when others work, we at least now have an option for users previously left out of using Jellyfin.</p>
<p>When I was researching this topic, I found many reports all over the internet facing the same error but nobody was able to provide a conclusive explanation whats really happening here.
There have been similar proposals made to handle it but there wasn't a "ready to drop in" solution that handles all the different cases or only code that required massive modifications to every EF Core query.
Jellyfin's implementation of the locking behaviors should be a copy-paste solution for everyone having the same issues as its using interceptors and the caller has no idea of the actual locking behavior.</p>
<p>Best of luck,</p>

<pre>Hi all,

I plan to introduce hard Rust dependencies and Rust code into
APT, no earlier than May 2026. This extends at first to the
Rust compiler and standard library, and the Sequoia ecosystem.

In particular, our code to parse .deb, .ar, .tar, and the
HTTP signature verification code would strongly benefit
from memory safe languages and a stronger approach to
unit testing.

If you maintain a port without a working Rust toolchain,
please ensure it has one within the next 6 months, or
sunset the port.

It's important for the project as whole to be able to
move forward and rely on modern tools and technologies
and not be held back by trying to shoehorn modern software
on retro computing devices.

Thank you for your understanding.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For years, startups have been taught to prioritize growth over everything else. Profitability was seen as unambitious or even wrong – something to worry about when you hit scale. Why focus on profits when money and valuations were easy to come by?</p><p>But that thinking was always flawed.</p><p>Profitability isn't unambitious; it's controlling your own destiny. It means you don't have to rely on investors for survival. It means you can focus on your unaltered vision and mission. And it means you as a founder decide the pace of growth. And once you experience it, it's hard to imagine doing things any other way.</p><p><a href="https://paulgraham.com/ramenprofitable.html">Paul Graham famously wrote about "ramen profitability"</a> – the point where a founding team could survive without external funding. He argued this made startups more attractive to investors, showing they could get customers to pay, were serious about building valuable products, and were disciplined with expenses.</p><p>Graham wrote his essay in 2009. I’d argue that we now live in a world where it’s not just easier to get ramen profitable, but traditionally profitable – while also growing fast.</p><p>At Linear we didn't set out to be profitable but kind of stumbled into it. We believed that to win this market we really needed to build a superior tool. The best way we knew how to do that was to keep the team small and focused. And when we launched after a year in private beta, almost all of our 100 beta users converted to paid customers. To our surprise, we realized it wouldn't take that long to become profitable if we kept the costs in check. Twelve months after launch, we hit profitability, and we've stayed profitable ever since.</p><p>I don't know why hiring massive teams ever became the norm. In my own experience, small teams always delivered better quality, and faster. Maybe it's fear of missing out if you don't grow the team fast. Maybe it's investors whispering that your team is "understaffed compared to benchmarks." Being understaffed compared to benchmarks almost always should be a source of pride, not a problem. People should be surprised how small your team is, not how big it is.</p><p>What holds you back is rarely team size – it's the clarity of your focus, skill and ability to execute. Larger teams mean slower progress, more management overhead, more meetings, more opinions, and usually dilution of vision and standards. Yet growing the team has somehow become a symbol of success.</p><p>At Linear, we hired our first employee after six months and roughly doubled the team each year. With each hire, we make sure they truly elevate the team. We don't set out to hire ten engineers – we hire the next <em>great</em> engineer. This intentional approach has allowed us to maintain both quality and culture.</p><p>The most underrated thing about profitability is how much peace of mind it gives you. Once you're profitable, you stop worrying about survival and focus on what really matters: building something great. Building the way you want. Instead of optimizing for the next fundraising round, you optimize for value creation.</p><p>While profitability might not come quickly for every startup, I believe it's achievable sooner than most think. If you're creating a new market, or truly require massive scale like a social network, or significant upfront investment like a hardware company, it might take longer. But if you're in a category where there isn't hard upfront investment, and you get some level of product-market fit with customers willing to pay, you can probably be profitable. You can decide to become profitable. And usually, it's a decision about how much and how fast you hire.</p><p><strong>Measure What Matters</strong></p><p>Revenue per employee is one of the clearest ways to see you’re hiring appropriately. While some of the best public companies benchmark at $1-2M per employee, for startups it's not unreasonable to target the range of $500k-$1M per employee.</p><p><strong>Understand Your Risk Profile</strong></p><p>Are you building something highly speculative where you're not sure if there's a market for it, or are you building something that already has a market but with a different take on it? In the former case profitability takes longer, but in the latter it could happen right away. Most software today, especially in the B2B space, is about building a modern version of something existing.</p><p><strong>Hire Intentionally and Slower</strong></p><p>For most software startups, ten people before product-market fit should be your ceiling, not your target. After PMF, every hire should address a specific, pressing need – not just fill out an org chart. At Linear, our deliberately slow headcount growth forced us to be selective, which meant making better hires. It also protected our culture, since rapid hiring often dilutes the very things that made your startup special in the first place. When you hire less, you naturally hire better.</p><p><strong>Raise on Your Own Terms </strong></p><p>Being profitable doesn't mean you have to be anti-investors. It means you have that choice, and investors are quite interested in profitable companies that also grow fast. You can raise more, less, or nothing. You can wait for the right timing, the right partner, or fund. For most ambitious startups, it can still be a good idea to raise something even if you could get by bootstrapping. Investors can still be helpful, and the additional cash balance can help you to make larger investments, or acquisitions.</p><p>The point is that you can be and are allowed to be profitable as a startup. It's not a bad thing, it's not an oxymoron or as hard as people make it out to be. The secret is that a lot of successful companies actually were quite profitable early on, they just didn't talk about it. When you're profitable, you make decisions based on what's best for your customers and your product, not what's best for impressing investors.</p><p>I didn't set out to build a profitable startup. But once I got there, I realized I wouldn't want to build a company any other way.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><header></header><section><article> <p>A few months back, while playing around with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://threejs.org/">Three.js</a>, I came across something that completely derailed my plans. Strange attractors - fancy math that creates beautiful patterns. At first I thought I'd just render one and move on, but then soon I realized that this is too much fun. When complexity emerges from three simple equations, when you see something chaotic emerge into beautiful, it's hard not to waste some time. I've spent countless hours, maybe more than I'd care to admit, watching these patterns form. I realized there's something deeply satisfying about seeing order emerge from randomness. Let me show you what kept me hooked.</p>

<h2>The Basics: Dynamical Systems and Chaos Theory</h2>
<p>Dynamical Systems are a mathematical way to understand how things <strong>change over time</strong>. Imagine you have a system, which
could be anything from the movement of planets to the growth of a population. In this system, there are rules that
determine how it evolves from one moment to the next. These rules tell you what will happen next based on what is
happening now. Some examples are, a pendulum, the weather patterns, a flock of birds, the spread of a virus in a
population (we are all too familiar with this one), and stock market.</p>
<p>There are two primary things to understand about this system:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Phase Space</strong>: This is like a big collection of all the possible states the system can be in. Each state is like a
snapshot of the system at a specific time. This is also called the <strong>state space</strong> or the <strong>world state</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamics</strong>: These are the rules that takes one state of the system and moves it to the next state. It can be
represented as a function that transforms the system from now to later.</li>
</ul>

<p>For instance, when studying population growth, a phase-space (world-state) might consist of the current population size
and the rate of growth or decline at a specific time. The dynamics would then be derived from models of population
dynamics, which, considering factors like birth rates, death rates, and carrying capacity of the environment, dictate
the changes in population size over time.</p>
<p>Another way of saying this is that the dynamical systems describe how things change over time, in a space of
possibilities, governed by a set of rules. Numerous fields such as biology, physics, economics, and applied mathematics,
study systems like these, focusing on the specific rules that dictate their evolution. These rules are grounded in
relevant theories, such as Newtonian mechanics, fluid dynamics, and mathematics of economics, among others.</p>
<h3 id="chaos-theory">Chaos Theory</h3>
<p>There are different ways of classifying dynamical systems, and one of the most interesting is the classification into
chaotic and non-chaotic systems. The change over time in non-chaotic systems is more deterministic as compared to
chaotic systems which exhibit randomness and unpredictability.</p>
<p><strong>Chaos Theory</strong> is the sub branch of dynamical systems that studies chaotic systems and challenges the traditional
deterministic views of causality. Most of the natural systems we observe are chaotic in nature, like the weather, a drop
of ink dissolving in water, social and economic behaviours etc. In contrast, systems like the movement of planets,
pendulums, and simple harmonic oscillators are extremely predictable and non-chaotic.</p>
<p>Chaos Theory deals with systems that exhibit irregular and unpredictable behavior over time, even though they follow
deterministic rules. Having a set of rules that govern the system, and yet exhibit randomness and unpredictability,
might seem a bit contradictory, but it is because the rules do not always represent the whole system. In fact, most of
the time, these rules are an approximation of the system and that is what leads to the unpredictability. In complex
systems, we do not have enough information to come up with a perfect set of rules. And by using incomplete information
to make predictions, we introduce uncertainty, which amplifies over time, leading to the chaotic behaviour.</p>

<p>Chaotic systems generally have many non-linear interacting components, which we partially understand (or can partially
observe) and which are very sensitive to small changes. A small change in the initial conditions can lead to a
completely different outcome, a phenomenon known as the <strong>butterfly effect</strong>. In this post, we will try to see the
butterfly effect in action but before that, let's talk about <strong>Strange Attractors</strong>.</p>
<h2>Strange Attractors</h2>
<p>To understand Strange Attractors, let's first understand what an attractor is. As discussed earlier, dynamical systems
are all about <strong>change over time</strong>. During this change, the system moves through different possible states (remember the
phase space jargon?). An attractor is a set of states towards which a system tends to settle over time, or you can say,
towards which it is <strong>attracted</strong>. It's like a magnet that pulls the system towards it.</p>
<p>For example, think of a pendulum. When you release it, it swings back and forth, but eventually, it comes to rest at the
bottom. The bottom is the attractor in this case. It's the state towards which the pendulum is attracted.</p>
<p>This happens due to the system's inherent dynamics, which govern how states in the phase space change. Here are some of
the reasons why different states get attracted towards attractors:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stability</strong>: Attractors are stable states of the system, meaning that once the system reaches them, it tends to stay
there. This stability arises from the system's dynamics, which push it towards the attractor and keep it there.</li>
<li><strong>Dissipation</strong>: Many dynamical systems have dissipative forces, which cause the system to lose energy over time. This
loss of energy leads the system to settle into a lower-energy state, which often corresponds to an attractor. This is
what happens in the case of the pendulum.</li>
<li><strong>Contraction</strong>: In some regions of the phase space, the system's dynamics cause trajectories to converge. This
contraction effect means that nearby states will tend to come closer together over time, eventually being drawn
towards the attractor.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some attractors have complex governing equations that can create unpredictable trajectories or behaviours. These
nonlinear interactions can result in multiple stable states or periodic orbits, towards which the system evolves. These
complex attractors are categorised as <strong>strange attractors</strong>. They are called "strange" due to their unique
characteristics.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Fractal Structure</strong>: Strange attractors often have a fractal-like structure, meaning they display intricate
patterns that repeat at different scales. This complexity sets them apart from simpler, regular attractors.</li>
<li><strong>Sensitive Dependence on Initial Conditions</strong>: Systems with strange attractors are highly sensitive to their initial
conditions. Small changes in the starting point can lead to vastly different long-term behaviors, a phenomenon known
as the "butterfly effect".</li>
<li><strong>Unpredictable Trajectories</strong>: The trajectories on a strange attractor never repeat themselves, exhibiting
non-periodic motion. The system's behavior appears random and unpredictable, even though it is governed by
deterministic rules.</li>
<li><strong>Emergent Order from Chaos</strong>: Despite their chaotic nature, strange attractors exhibit a form of underlying order.
Patterns and structures emerge from the seemingly random behavior, revealing the complex dynamics at play.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can observe most of these characteristics in the visualisation. The one which is most fascinating to observe is the
butterfly effect.</p>
<h3 id="the-butterfly-effect">The Butterfly Effect</h3>
<blockquote><p>A butterfly can flutter its wings over a flower in China and cause a hurricane in the Caribbean.</p></blockquote>
<p>One of the defining features of strange attractors is their sensitivity to initial conditions. This means that small
changes in the starting state of the system can lead to vastly different long-term behaviors, a phenomenon known as the
<strong>butterfly effect</strong>. In chaotic systems, tiny variations in the initial conditions can amplify over time, leading to
drastically different outcomes.</p>

<p>There is another way of observing the butterfly effect in this visualisation. Change the <code>Initial State</code> from <code>cube</code> to
<code>sphere surface</code> in the control panel and observe how the particles move differently in the two cases. The particles
eventually get attracted to the same states but have different trajectories.</p>

<h2>Implementation Details</h2>
<p>This visualization required rendering a large number of particles using Three.js. To achieve this efficiently, we used a
technique called <strong>ping-pong rendering</strong> <sup><a href="#user-content-fn-2" id="user-content-fnref-2" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup>. This method handles iterative updates of particle systems directly on the GPU,
minimizing data transfers between the CPU and GPU. It utilizes two frame buffer objects (FBOs) that alternate roles: One
stores the current state of particles and render them on the screen, while the other calculates the next state.</p>
<h3 id="implementation-workflow">Implementation Workflow</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Setting Up Frame Buffer Objects (FBOs):</strong> We start by creating two FBOs, <code>ping</code> and <code>pong</code>, to hold the current and
next state of particles. These buffers store data such as particle positions in RGBA channels, making efficient use
of GPU resources.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Shader Programs for Particle Dynamics:</strong> The shader programs execute on the GPU and apply attractor dynamics to
each particle. Following is the attractor function which update the particle positions based on the attractor equation.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Rendering and Buffer Swapping:</strong> In each frame, the shader computes the new positions based on the attractor's
equations and stores them in the inactive buffer. After updating, the roles of the FBOs are swapped: The previously
inactive buffer becomes active, and vice versa.</p>

</li>
</ol>
<p>This combination of efficient shader calculations and the ping-pong technique allows us to render the particle system.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="centercontent">
<p itemprop="description">Last night I had a very strange experience: About two thirds of the way through reading a Web page about myself, Tim Bray, I
    succumbed to boredom and killed the tab. Thus my introduction to
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grokipedia">Grokipedia</a>. Here are early impressions.</p>

<p id="p-1"><span>On Bray</span> · 
My Grokipedia entry has over seven thousand words, compared to a mere 1,300 in
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Bray">my Wikipedia article</a>. It’s pretty clear how it was generated; an LLM, trained
    on who-knows-what but definitely including that Wikipedia article and this blog, was told to go nuts.</p>

<p>Speaking as a leading but highly biased expert on the subject of T. Bray, here are the key take-aways:</p>

<p id="p-2"><span>(Overly) complete</span> · 
It covers all the territory; there is no phase of my life’s activity that could possibly be encountered in combing the Web
    that is not exhaustively covered. In theory this should be good but in fact, who cares about the details of what I worked on
    at Sun Microsystems between 2004 and 2010? I suppose I should but, like I said, I couldn’t force myself to plod all the way
    through it.</p>

<p id="p-3"><span>Wrong</span> · 
Every paragraph contains significant errors. Sometimes the text is explicitly self-contradictory on the face of it,
    sometimes the mistakes are subtle enough that only I would spot them.</p>

<p id="p-4"><span>Style</span> · 
The writing has that LLM view-from-nowhere flat-affect semi-academic flavor. I don’t like it but the evidence suggests that
    some people do?</p>

<p id="p-5"><span>References</span> · 
All the references are just URLs and at least some of them entirely fail to support the text. Here’s an example. In
    discussion of my expert-witness work for the FTC in their litigation against Meta concerning its acquisitions of Instagram and
    WhatsApp, Grokipedia says:</p>

<blockquote><p>[Bray] opined that users' perceptions of response times in online services critically influence market
    dynamics.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It cites
    <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/FTCReplytoMetaResponse-CounterstatementofMaterialFacts.pdf">Federal
    Trade Commission’s Reply to Meta Platforms, Inc.’s Response to Federal Trade Commission’s Counterstatement of Material
    Facts</a> (warning: 2,857-page PDF). Okay, that was one of the things I argued, but the 425 pages of court documents that I
    filed, and the references to my reporting in the monster document, make it clear that it was one tiny subset of the main
    argument.</p>

<p>Anyhow, I (so that you won’t have to) spent a solid fifteen minutes spelunking back and forth through that FTC doc, looking
    for strings like “response time” and “latency” and so on. Maybe somewhere in those pages there’s support for the claim quoted
    above, but I couldn’t find it.</p>

<p id="p-6"><span>Useful?</span> · 
Wikipedia, in my mind, has two main purposes: A quick visit to find out the basics about some city or person or plant or
    whatever, or a deep-dive to find out what we <em>really</em> know about genetic linkages to autism or Bach’s relationship with
    Frederick the Great or whatever.</p>

<p>At the moment, Grokipedia doesn’t really serve either purpose very well. But, after all, this is release 0.1, maybe we
    should give it a chance.</p>

<p>Or, maybe not.</p>

<p id="p-7"><span>Woke/Anti-Woke</span> · 
The whole point, one gathers, is to provide an antidote to Wikipedia’s alleged woke bias. So I dug into that. Let’s consider
    three examples of what I found.  First, from that same paragraph about the FTC opinion quoted above:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While Bray and aligned progressives contend that such dominance stifles innovation by enabling predatory acquisitions and
      reduced rivalry—evidenced by fewer startup exits in concentrated sectors—counterarguments highlight that Big Tech's scale has
      fueled empirical gains, with these firms investing over $240 billion in U.S. R&amp;D in 2024 (more than a quarter of national
      totals) and driving AI, cloud, and patent surges.[<a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2020/06/08/Anti-monopoly">128</a>]
      [<a href="https://www.intereconomics.eu/contents/year/2025/number/2/article/big-tech-and-the-us-digital-military-industrial-complex.html">131</a>] Six tech industries alone accounted for
      over one-third of 
      U.S. GDP growth from 2012–2021, comprising about 9% of the 
      economy and sustaining 9.3 million jobs amid falling consumer prices and rapid technological diffusion.
      [<a href="https://itif.org/publications/2023/05/30/six-tech-industries-accounted-for-more-than-one-third-of-gdp-growth-in-the-last-decade/">132]</a> 
      [<a href="https://jamesmadison.org/the-united-states-is-the-leader-of-the-digital-revolution-pro-tech-policies-are-key/">133</a>]
      Right-leaning economists often defend consumer welfare metrics and market self-correction, warning that forced divestitures
      risk eroding the efficiencies and investment incentives that have propelled sector productivity above 6% annual growth in key
      areas like durable manufacturing tech.
      [<a href="https://itif.org/publications/2025/09/19/five-persistent-myths-about-big-tech/">134</a>]
      [<a href="https://www.nber.org/digest/oct01/technology-and-productivity-growth?page=1&amp;perPage=50">135</a>]</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I’ve linked the numbered citations to the indicated URLs. Maybe visit one or two of them and see what you think? Four are
    to articles arguing, basically, that monopolies must be OK because the companies accused of it are growing really fast and
    driving the economy. They seem mostly to be from right-wing think-tanks but I guess that’s what those think-tanks are for.  One
    of them, #131, <cite>Big Tech and the US Digital-Military-Industrial Complex</cite>, I think isn’t helpful to the argument at
    all. But still, it’s broadly doing what they advertise: Pushing back against “woke” positions, in this case the position that
    monopolization is bad.</p>

<p>I looked at a couple of other examples.  For example, this is from the header of the Greta Thunberg article:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While credited with elevating youth engagement on environmental issues, Thunberg's promotion of urgent, existential climate
      threats has drawn scrutiny for diverging from nuanced empirical assessments of climate risks and adaptation capacities, as
      well as for extending her activism into broader political arenas such as anti-capitalist and geopolitical protests.[5][6]</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Somehow I feel no urge to click on those citation links.</p>

<p>If Ms Thunberg is out there on the “woke” end of the spectrum, let’s flit over to the other end, namely the entry for
    J.D. Vance, on the subject of his book <cite>Hillbilly Elegy</cite>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Critics from progressive outlets, including Sarah Smarsh in her 2018 book <cite>Heartland</cite>, faulted the memoir for
      overemphasizing personal and cultural failings at the expense of structural economic policies, arguing it perpetuated
      stereotypes of rural whites as self-sabotaging.[71] These objections, often rooted in institutional analyses from academia and
      media, overlooked data on behavioral patterns like opioid dependency rates—peaking at 21.5 deaths per 100,000 in Appalachia
      around 2016—that aligned with Vance's observations of "deaths of despair" precursors.[72]</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I read and enjoyed <cite>Heartland</cite> but the citation is to a <cite>New Yorker</cite> article that doesn’t mention
    Smarsh. As for the second sentence… my first reaction as I trudged through its many clauses, was “life’s too short”.
    But seriously, opioid-death statistics weaken the hypothesis about structural economic issues? Don’t get it.</p>

<p id="p-8"><span>Take-away</span> · 
Wikipedia is,
    <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2024/06/15/Wikipedia-Pain">to quote myself</a>, the encyclopedia that “anyone who’s willing to
    provide citations can edit”.
    Grokipedia is “the encyclopedia that Elon Musk’s LLM can edit, with sketchy citations and no progressive argument left
    un-attacked.”</p>

<p>So I guess it’s Working As Intended?</p>

<p><img src="https://enaix.github.io/assets/img/android-skull.jpg" alt="android skull"></p>

<p>As you all know, Google has introduced developer verification as a way to prevent users from installing “unregistered” APKs. This measure was taken as a security feature to link every APK in existence to its developer, as in Play Store.</p>

<p><a href="https://developer.android.com/developer-verification">Link to the Android documentation</a>, <a href="https://developer.android.com/developer-verification/guides/faq">link to FAQ</a></p>

<h2 id="why-this-is-bad">Why this is bad</h2>

<p>This has already been discussed by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/10/google-confirms-android-dev-verification-will-have-free-and-paid-tiers-no-public-list-of-devs/">ArsTechnica</a> and on some threads (some cherry-picked ones): <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1nwddik/heres_how_androids_new_app_verification_rules/">reddit</a>, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45017028">ycombinator</a>, <a href="https://hackaday.com/2025/08/26/google-will-require-developer-verification-even-for-sideloading/">hackaday</a>.</p>

<p>A quick recap of the main points (as of 30 Oct 2025):</p>

<ul>
  <li>The base tier costs $25, as in Play Market. Requires an ID</li>
  <li>There will be a limited “hobbyist” unpaid license. Google claims that they won’t require an ID</li>
  <li>Legal info is told to be private, unlike with Play Market</li>
  <li>The verification code is supposed to be located in Play Services, <strong>but Google hasn’t published the source code yet</strong></li>
  <li>Google assures that it would be possible to install applications locally using ADB, <strong>but there are no details on this</strong></li>
  <li>Hobbyist license restrictions are unknown</li>
</ul>

<p>A few months prior Google has decided to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/google-makes-android-development-private-will-continue-open-source-releases/">make Android development private</a>, which seems to be a preparation for the upcoming changes (<a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-not-killing-aosp-3566882/">another article</a>). Due to this change in AOSP release format, it is no longer possible to track what exactly Google is doing.</p>

<p>My answer to this question is that it would simply prevent small developers from distributing their apps, including myself. If we take the legal route, a hobbyist license is supposed to have some limit on the number of installs by design. If we take, say, 10K installs, this is not enough in my case. Another question is how exactly the process of verification is going to happen, what if Google adopts the same rules as in Play Store? Taking my <a href="https://github.com/enaix/Kirikiroid2-debloated">fork of the old VN engine port</a>, this apk would not pass security checks, as the old codebase relies on legacy external storage permissions, which are banned in Play Store. If we take the adb route, there are <strong>no guarantees that this method is going to work in the future in the form you expect</strong>. For instance, Google mentions that this method is meant for on-device tests during development, and nothing prevents them from reporting the install to their servers and checking if a self-signed apk has been installed on other devices. Another way to put it, this is problematic for an average Android user to perform these steps, and this is going to be the developer’s problem.</p>

<p>The situation links pretty well with Samsung <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/say-goodbye-to-your-custom-roms-as-one-ui-8-kills-bootloader-unlock/">removing bootloader unlocking with the One UI 8 update</a>. Great, duh…</p>

<h2 id="the-concept">The concept</h2>

<p><img src="https://enaix.github.io/assets/img/loader1.svg" alt="apk loader"></p>

<p>My vision of the hack is to distribute a verified loader apk, which in turn dynamically loads any apk the user wants. A user obtains the loader apk once and loads apps without installing as much as they want.</p>

<p>The Java virtual machine in Android is the ART/Dalvik runtime (I will refer to it as Dalvik, it seems that Google hates cool names). Did you know that Dalvik natively <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/dalvik/system/PathClassLoader">allows dynamic code execution using PathClassLoader</a>? So an apk may just load some zip/apk/dex code from external storage and execute it in current context. Essentially, this means that we can natively load the apk into memory and execute any code inside of the target apk, and we are not altering the original code signature of the loader.</p>

<p>In order to actually run the apk, the loader needs to properly initialize the main activity (aka the main screen, or the entrypoint) of the target apk. So, the main activity needs to be initialized and somehow placed inside of the Android’s activity cycle with the loader acting as a wrapper. Then, the loader apk should handle other aspects like local files handling and names conflict resolution. This can be achieved by patching the target apk bytecode: .odex/.dex classes may be dynamically decompiled into .smali, analyzed and compiled back into a modified apk. Furthermore, the loader would have to parse AndroidManifest options of the target (main activity location, screen options).</p>

<h3 id="implementation">Implementation</h3>

<p>Developing such wrapper in a straightforward way has proven to be rather difficult, as Android <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/master/core/java/android/app/Activity.java">activity management logic</a> is extremely complicated and differs from version to version. In short, it was problematic to perform the initialization process the right way. Some people suggested to avoid the initialization step completely, and use Unsafe Dalvik api to register the target’s activity as the loader apk activity stub, which is declared in the loader’s manifest without class. I couldn’t find exact methods in the <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/sun/misc/Unsafe">Unsafe documentation</a>, but this actually may be a way to go.</p>

<p>Due to this particular issue I couldn’t bring the proof of concept to a working state in a reasonable time, and because of this I was considering to not publish this article at all. The purpose of this post is not to give a somewhat ready solution, but get some feedback on the concept, as I was not ready to devote lots of time on a potentially broken solution.</p>

<h2 id="the-logistics">The logistics</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Information provided in this section is for educational use only, all scenarios discussed below are hypothetical.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In order to install the loader apk on the device, it would require, well, some form of verification. Hobbyist license is the only choice here, as paying $25 for each attempt is not optimal. Since the hobbyist license has a limited number of installs, there should be multiple instances of the apk with separate licences. In this hypothetical scenario there may either be a pool of volunteers who sign the code, or completely random users who are willing to help. In the second case, the loader code would somehow need to be verified or scanned, since such distribution system would be vulnerable to malware.</p>

<p>The final and the most important issue in this process is the verification process itself, as the loader code may (and likely will) be flagged by Google. So, the code would require some form of obfuscation like code flow modification and implementing double functionality (for instance, registering it as a file manager). If Google decides to ban dynamic code loading altogether, the final solution would be to pack the Dalvik runtime into the loader as a native library. This of course would have extremely low performance, but it should be technically possible.</p>

<p>Overall, the hypothetical plan has lots of assumptions, with which I’m not happy with. First of all, it requires lots of manual work by the volunteers or random people, and this work also includes the apk obfuscation, which was not discussed in detail. Then, the verification process itself should be somewhat permissive to allow potentially suspicious apps (I would like to hear how does this happen with current Play Store verification).</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>The project described in this article by no means is a finished solution, and if you have started to think what else could work, it means that the article has reached its original goal. I believe that we would eventually come up with a proper solution in the future. Thank you for reading!</p>
