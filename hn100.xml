<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-astro-cid-2q5oecfc=""> <p>Our relationship with computers and phones has changed. We used to rely on software installed locally on our computers, and are now shifting towards a model based on services and companion apps, sometimes with free tiers and subscriptions.</p>
<p>Most services are provided by organisations, who collect and sometimes resell users’ information to third parties. This massive, indiscriminate, and corporate collection of personal data is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_capitalism">surveillance capitalism</a>. While organisations can argue this data collection is necessary to provide their services, this comes with significant privacy implications.</p>
<p>Self-hosting and paid subscriptions are common strategies to escape surveillance capitalism. But what guarantees do they really offer? What alternatives exist for the general public who wants to escape surveillance capitalism, and at what cost?</p>
<h2 id="paid-subscriptions-are-not-enough">Paid subscriptions are not enough</h2>
<p>When services have a free and a paid tier, it can be tempting to think that the provider is going to sell your data on the free tier but they’re going to be mindful of it on the paid tier. Paying a subscription to your provider can sound like a good idea to keep your data safe, and it sometimes is. But it’s not necessarily the case.</p>
<p>As reported by The Verge, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/2/23622227/betterhelp-customer-data-advertising-privacy-facebook-snapchat">mental health service provider BetterHelp shared customer’s email addresses, IP addresses, and health questionnaire information with third parties</a> including Facebook and Snapchat, while promising it was private. Mental health is precisely the type of information that should remain private, making this move particularly appalling from BetterHelp.</p>
<h2 id="self-hosting-but-as-a-service">Self-hosting, but as a service</h2>
<p>One of the major enablers of surveillance capitalism is centralisation. In that sense, paid subscriptions don’t offer any guarantee that the provider will play fair game and keep your data private.</p>
<p>Self-hosting is rather efficient at preventing surveillance capitalism, mostly because the data doesn’t live in a central repository but on the self-hoster’s infrastructure. In that sense, it doesn’t directly enable surveillance capitalism. It’s important here to make a distinction between private and public information though. Posts on federated social media platforms are not centralised, but they are public and can be scraped to be exploited. The threat we’re discussing in this article is a provider growing so big it can collect and exploit data that is not public, at a large scale.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the vendor of the self-hosted solution could theoretically still gather information about the users by making its software send data to the mothership regardless of where it’s installed. To an extent, this can be acceptable as long as the user explicitly knows what data is sent, can opt-out, and that the minimum amount of anonymised data is sent for clearly defined purposes. This practice is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telemetry#Software">telemetry</a>. Open-source software allows any tech-savvy person to look up the code and check what is actually sent to the mothership. Proprietary software makes it much more difficult.</p>
<p>But <a href="https://ergaster.org/posts/2023/08/09-i-dont-want-to-host-services-but-i-do">as we discussed earlier on this blog</a>, self-hosting doesn’t scale well because it requires time and knowledge. There’s a workaround: using software that can be self-hosted, but buying it as a service. A real life example would be the Google Drive ethical alternative <a href="https://nextcloud.com/">Nextcloud</a>: several providers like Ionos offer hosted Nextcloud instances. This makes solutions like these accessible (and safe!) to a broader public.</p>
<p>Using open-source licences means that the software can be audited, but it also allows anyone to take the code and offer it as service. This can lead to a race to the bottom in terms of cost and quality when the service providers are not playing fair game: they benefit from development work they didn’t invest resources in, all while not contributing financially or technically to the upstream project either.</p>
<p>If the customers of such providers encounter problems, support is often minimal: in very budget-tight environments, losing a customer can be more profitable than investigating a significant problem. Such predatory methods harm the ecosystems in which they’re deployed: customers get bad experiences, and the upstream project gets little to no benefit. Similar behaviours have been observed in the Matrix ecosystem where integrators deployed open source products without contributing anything back.</p>
<p><img alt="A screenshot of the Nextcloud website's page listing the partners working with Nextcloud." src="https://ergaster.org/_astro/nextcloud-partners.DuAZqLpZ_1XMc1K.webp" width="2880" height="1580" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></p>
<p>Ultimately, support contracts are an insurance for the service provider <em>and</em> for their customers. When the service provider pays for upstream’s support and reports an issue, the engineers who developed the product investigate the case, fix the problem, and make the fix permanent for everyone. This also allows the upstream to generate a bit of revenue, contributing to the project’s health, sustainability, and to the emergence of new exciting features.</p>
<p>Nextcloud also allows users to sign up on third party providers directly from <a href="https://nextcloud.com/">nextcloud.com</a>. The sign-up feature makes it extremely easy for the user to choose a provider. Nextcloud’s <a href="https://jospoortvliet.com/">Jos Poortvliet</a> confirmed to me that it’s not a formal certification programme, but more of a group of companies Nextcloud trusts. Nextcloud doesn’t generate revenue from this programme, intentionally, since they’re not in the business of monetising private users. Certification programmes are usually very expensive to run and not necessarily profitable for vendors.</p>
<p><img alt="A screenshot of the Nextcloud website prompting the user for their email address, and offering them to get started with a provider near them." src="https://ergaster.org/_astro/nextcloud-signup.Do-jCSrM_Z1Cnz2L.webp" width="2880" height="1580" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></p>
<h2 id="not-trusting-anyone">Not trusting anyone</h2>
<p>When buying a hosted service from a provider, we enable a form of partial re-centralisation… which technically allows the provider to start selling the users’ data for profit.</p>
<p>There’s a third option: making sure the data can only be read by its intended recipients, turning the servers into rather dumb pipes. This is End-to-End Encryption (E2EE). It certainly sounds like a silver bullet! So why doesn’t every service provider implement it, to show their good faith? Because it has drawbacks.</p>
<p>When using E2EE, the files are encrypted. Nobody apart from their owner and people who have been explicitly authorised by the owner can read them. This means neither the server software nor the technical administrator of the server can read them either. This is often what users expect, but this has consequences!</p>
<h3 id="the-server-becomes-dumb">The server becomes dumb</h3>
<p>Since the server can’t read the data, there are some legitimate operations it cannot perform anymore. A typical example is “deep” search, which is functionality where the server spends computing time to read and index all the files so it’s easy for the user to query them. When files are encrypted, indexing and search can only happen on the client. Those operations are quite expensive, and the clients don’t necessarily have the computing power, connectivity or storage required to do so.</p>
<p>There are some new techniques such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphic_encryption">homomorphic encryption</a> that could eventually enable users to offload this computation to the server&nbsp;<em>without</em>&nbsp;the server learning anything about what it is actually doing but they are not yet ready for large-scale use.</p>
<p>Having a dumb server also severely limits its ability to send automated reports or alerts based on specific workflows. In a sense, the server can’t “work” for the user anymore and becomes nothing more than a backup service.</p>
<h3 id="data-can-become-irrecoverable">Data can become irrecoverable</h3>
<p>With E2EE, encryption and decryption keys are stored on the device only, which is a significant risk. Let’s assume you host your important documents exclusively on an E2EE service and your keys only exist on your phone. If your phone is broken or lost, your decryption keys are lost with it.</p>
<p>There are three workarounds to avoid losing the keys entirely:</p>
<ol>
<li>Generating a “paper key” (also called “recovery key”, “seed passphrase”, or even “paper wallet” in the context of cryptocurrencies) directly on the client, and giving the user the 12 to 15 words to write down or print somewhere.</li>
<li>Derive the encryption key from the user’s password. This is <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/11/firefox-sync-privacy/">the approach Firefox Sync is taking</a> for example.</li>
<li>Storing the encryption keys on the server-side, in a vault encrypted by a key derived from a passphrase. The passphrase must of course be long enough to make it difficult to break by the server administrator.</li>
</ol>
<p>The major inconvenient of these workarounds is that they require the user to either print/write a generated key and store them somewhere safe where they can recover it later, or remember a passphrase to access their en/decryption keys. If the user loses the generated key or can’t remember the passphrase, their data is lost and irrecoverable. The service provider cannot do anything about it because they can’t access the data. In other words: there’s no “forgot my password” link anymore.</p>
<p>The reputational risk of not being able to help users who forgot their password is often unacceptable for service providers. Even Apple who positions itself as a company respectful of their users’ privacy doesn’t turn on E2EE by default, and understandably takes a lot of precautions before <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/108756">allowing users to turn on actual E2EE</a> on their iCloud account.</p>
<h3 id="the-e-in-e2ee-doesnt-stand-for-everything">The “E” in E2EE doesn’t stand for “Everything”</h3>
<p>While E2EE is particularly good at preventing nosy folks from looking at files and messages themselves, it doesn’t mean <em>everything</em> is encrypted. In particular, metadata can be sent in clear text either because it’s necessary for the server to provide the service, <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/module/why-metadata-matters">or because the service providers can profit from it</a>.</p>
<p>Typically, WhatsApp is an E2EE messenger, but the provider still has access to metadata. WhatsApp also has a moderation feature that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/09/whatsapp-end-to-end-encrypted-messages-arent-that-private-after-all/">allows users to decrypt an E2EE message they were sent, and send it to Meta for moderation purposes</a>. While moderation is a valid use case which doesn’t break encryption itself, it shows that the client could in theory decrypt the message and send it to the service provider behind the user’s back.</p>
<p><img alt="A screenshot of the iOS App Store displaying the &quot;App Privacy&quot; section of WhatsApp. A lot of items are mentioned in the &quot;Data Linked to You&quot; section." src="https://ergaster.org/_astro/whatsapp-data-collected.D2jizaJk_wsrgM.webp" width="1179" height="2556" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></p>
<p>This highlights that E2EE alone is also not enough: even if users don’t need to trust the service provider they need to be able to trust both the protocol and the client they rely on. This means the client necessarily needs to be open source and audited regularly by an independent third party.</p>
<h2 id="beyond-tech">Beyond tech</h2>
<p>As we have seen, there are several strategies to help the general public trying to escape surveillance capitalism. Self-hosting is efficient but doesn’t scale well, paid instances of self-hostable software work generally well but are not a silver bullet, and E2EE is very useful to protect privacy but don’t provide a full guarantee either.</p>
<p>Ultimately E2EE is a very libertarian approach to a societal issue, taking a “myself against the world” stance. It can be a valid stance, especially for minorities and in hostile contexts. But surveillance capitalism is not a technological problem. It is enabled by technology, but at the very core it is a societal problem.</p>
<p>As Molly White said, “there are never purely technological solutions to societal problems”. To fight surveillance capitalism, we need E2EE, regulation, justice, and education.</p>
<p>We need E2EE to prevent the collection from happening in the first place. We need proper regulation to define what is acceptable or not, which will ultimately define what is a viable business model and what is not. This means that the fines must make it prohibitively unprofitable to sell users’ data. We need justice and executive bodies to actually enforce the regulation. And we need education for the general public to understand the risks of surveillance capitalism.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p><span>Exclusive</span> IBM has canceled a program that rewarded inventors at Big Blue for patents or publications, leaving some angry that they are missing out on potential bonuses.</p>
<p>By cancelling the scheme, a source told <em>The Register</em>, IBM has eliminated a financial liability by voiding the accrued, unredeemed credits issued to program participants which could have been converted into potential cash awards.</p>
<p>For years, IBM has sponsored an "Invention Achievement Award Plan" to incentivize employee innovation. In exchange for filing patents, or for publishing articles that served as defense against rival patents, IBM staff were awarded points that led to recognition and potentially cash bonuses.</p>

    

<p>According to documentation seen by <em>The Register</em>, "Invention points are awarded to all inventors listed on a successful disclosure submission."</p>

        


        

<p>One point was awarded for publishing. Three points were awarded for filing a patent or four if the filing was deemed high value. For accruing 12 points, program participants would get a payout.</p>
<p>﻿﻿"Inventors reach an invention plateau for every 12 points they achieve – which must include at least one file decision," the rules state. And for each plateau achieved, IBM would pay its inventors $1,200 in recognition of their efforts.</p>

        

<p>No longer, it seems. IBM canceled the program at the end of 2023 and replaced it with a new one that uses a different, incompatible point system called BluePoints.</p>
<p>"The previous Invention Achievement Award Plan will be sunset at midnight (eastern time) on December 31st, 2023," company FAQs explain. "Since Plateau awards are one of the items being sunset, plateau levels must be obtained on or before December 31, 2023 to be eligible for the award. Any existing plateau points that have not been applied will not be converted to BluePoints."</p>

</ul>
<p>We're told that IBM's invention review process could take months, meaning that employees just didn't have time between the announcement and the program sunset to pursue the next plateau and cash out.</p>
<p>Those involved in the program evidently were none too pleased by the points grab. And they sought answers from corporate brass through an internal Slack channel.</p>
<p>Citing the revised award scheme, one question read, "Do we allow customers to unilaterally cancel the payment schedule after work has been delivered?"</p>

        

<p>Another read, "Is it reasonable to do this to employees, many of whom worked outside of their regular job to develop IP?"</p>
<p>We're told these represented the most upvoted questions submitted to the CEO's recent monthly Office Hours meeting, but the response was evasive.</p>
<p>IBM did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>A former IBMer reports that a colleague still with Big Blue said, "My opinion...the invention award program was buggered a long time [ago]. It rewarded words on a page instead of true innovation. [Former CEO] Ginni [Rometty] made it worse by advocating the program to fluff up young egos." ®</p>

<h2><span id="Introduction">Introduction</span></h2>
<p>This page is aimed at learning from the wisdom of the PostgreSQL community.
</p><p>People involved in the PostgreSQL community, as organizations or individuals, are posting vast amounts of useful information on blogs, wikis, and websites. However, they are scattered, and it will not be easy to find the information you are looking for.
</p><p>Therefore, this page has compiled a collection of links to articles that the editor(s) informative, from hundreds of blog sites registered on Planet PostgreSQL, plus the PostgreSQL wiki and websites. Some notable topics from these articles are picked up here, trying to organize and summarize them for introduction purposes. Please feel free to add links to the articles you find helpful to others. Adding the summaries of them is also appreciated in addition to the links.
</p><p><b>Notes</b>
</p>
<ul><li>do not expect everything to be extracted from those articles! Diving directly into the original articles is strongly recommended.</li>
<li>Some configuration parameters, functions, statistics views, and system tables/views may only be available after some major versions. Consult PostgreSQL documentation for availability.</li></ul>

<li>Main fork (<code>base/&lt;database_OID&gt;/&lt;relation_filenode_no&gt;</code>)

<li>FSM (free space map) fork (<code>base/&lt;database_OID&gt;/&lt;relation_filenode_no&gt;_fsm</code>)
<ul><li>Keeps track of free space in the relation.</li>
<li>Entries are organized as a tree, where each leaf node entry stores free space in one relation block.</li>

</p><p>Processes
</p></code></code><code><code><ul><li>Single-threaded: postmaster launches a single backend process for each client connection. Thus, each SQL execution only uses a single CPU core. Parallel query, index build, VACUUM etc. can utilize multiple CPU cores by running multiple server processes.</li>
<li>postmaster: The parent of all server processes. Controls the server startup and shutdown. Create shared memory and semaphores. Launches other server processes and reaps dead ones. Opens and listens on TCP ports and/or Unix domain sockets, accepts connection requests, and spawns client backends to pass the connection requests to.</li>
<li>(Client) backend: Acts on behalf of a client session and handles its requests, i.e., executes SQL commands.</li>
<li>Background processes
<ul><li>logger: Catches all stderr output from other processes through pipes, and writes them to log files.</li>
<li>checkpointer: Handles all checkpoints.</li>
<li>background writer: Periodically wakes up and writes out dirty shared buffers so that other processes don't have to write them when they need to free a shared buffer to read in another page.</li>
<li>startup: Performs crash and point-in-time recovery. Ends as soon as the recovery is complete.</li>
<li>stats collector: Receives messages from other processes through UDP sockets, accumulates statistics about server activity, and writes them to files. The statistics can be viewed with pg_stat... views. This process is gone as of PostgreSQL 15.</li>
<li>walwriter: Periodically wakes up and writes out WAL buffers to reduce the amount of WAL that other processes have to write. Also ensures the writes of commit WAL records from asynchronously committed transactions.</li>
<li>archiver: Archives WAL files.</li>
<li>autovacuum launcher: Always running when autovacuum is enabled. Schedules autovacuum workers to run.</li>
<li>autovacuum worker: Connect to a database as determined in the launcher, examine system catalogs to select the tables, and vacuum them.</li>
<li>parallel worker: Executes part of a parallel query plan.</li>
<li>walreceiver: Runs on the standby server. Receives WAL from the walsender, stores it on disk, and tells the startup process to continue recovery based on it.</li>
<li>walsender: Runs on the primary server. Sends WAL to a single walreceiver.</li>
<li>logical replication launcher: Run on the subscriber. Coordinates  logical replication workers to run.</li>
<li>logical replication worker: Runs on the subscriber. An apply worker per subscription receives logical changes from walsender on the publisher and applies them. One or more tablesync workers perform initial table copy for each table.</li></ul></li>
<li>Background worker: Runs system-supplied or user-supplied code. e.g., used for parallel query and logical replication.</li></ul></code></code><code><code><p>Memory
</p></code></code><code><code><ul><li>Shared memory
<ul><li>Shared buffers: Stores the cached copy of data files (main, FSM, and VM forks).</li>
<li>WAL buffers: Transactions put WAL records here before writing them out to disk.</li>
<li>Other various areas: One large shared memory segment is divided into areas for specific uses.</li>
<li>The allocations of areas can be examined with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/view-pg-shmem-allocations.html">pg_shmem_allocations</a>.</li></ul></li>
<li>Local memory
<ul><li>Work memory: Allocated for a query operation such as sort and hash. Configured with work_mem and hash_mem_multiplier parameters.</li>
<li>Maintenance work memory: Allocated for maintenance operations, such as VACUUM, CREATE INDEX, and ALTER TABLE. Configured with maintenance_work_mem parameter.</li>
<li>Temporary buffers: Allocated for caching temporary table blocks. Configured with temp_buffers parameter.</li>
<li>Other various areas: A memory context is allocated for a specific usage (e.g., a message from client, transaction, query plan, execution state). Hundreds of memory contexts per session are possible.</li>
<li>The allocation and usage of memory contexts can be examined with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/view-pg-backend-memory-contexts.html">pg_backend_memory_contexts</a> view for the current session, and with the function <code>pg_log_backend_memory_contexts(backend_pid)</code> for other sessions.</li></ul></li></ul></code></code><code><code><h3><span id="Reading_and_writing_database_data">Reading and writing database data</span></h3></code></code><code><code><ul><li>Read:
<ul><li>First, search the shared buffers for a buffer containing the target block. If found, it's returned to the requester.</li>
<li>Otherwise, allocate a buffer from a free buffer list, and read the target block from the data file into the buffer.</li>
<li>If there's no free buffer, evict and use a used buffer. If it's dirty, writes out the buffer to disk.</li></ul></li>
<li>Write
<ul><li>Find the target shared buffer, modify its contents, and write the changes to the WAL buffers.</li>
<li>The modifying transaction writes out its WAL records from the WAL buffers to disk, including the commit WAL record.</li>
<li>The modified dirty shared buffers are flushed to disk by background writer, checkpointer, or any other process. This is asynchronous with the transaction completion.</li></ul></li>
<li>Any backend can read and write shared buffers, WAL buffers, data and WAL files. Unlike some other DBMSs, writes are not exclusively performed by a particular background process.</li>
<li>The database data file is read and written one block at a time. There's no multiblock I/O.</li>
<li>Some operations bypass shared buffers: the write of an index during index creation, CREATE DATABASE, ALTER TABLE ... SET TABLESPACE</li></ul></code></code><code><code><h3><span id="Query_processing">Query processing</span></h3></code></code><code><code><ol><li>A client connects to a database, sends a query (SQL command) to the server, and receives the result.</li>
<li>The parser first checks the query for correct syntax. Then, it interprets the semantics of the query to understand which tables, views, functions, data types, etc. are referenced.</li>
<li>The rewrite system (rewriter) transforms the query based on the rules stored in the system catalog pg_rewrite. One example is the view: a query that accesses a view is rewritten to use the base table.</li>
<li>The planner/optimizer creates a query plan.</li>
<li>The executor executes the query plan and returns the result set to the client.</li></ol></code></code><code><code><p>Notes
</p></code></code><code><code><ul><li>Each session runs on a connection to a single database. Therefore, it cannot access tables on a different database. However, one session can connect to another database and create another session via a foreign data wrapper like postgres_fdw, and access tables there. For example, an SQL command can join one table on the local database and another table on a remote database.</li>
<li>Each SQL command basically uses only one CPU core. A parallel query and some utility commands such as CREATE INDEX and VACUUM can use multiple CPU cores by running background workers.</li></ul></code></code><code><code><h3><span id="References">References</span></h3></code></code><code><code><p>PostgreSQL Documentation

</p></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><ul><li>When the connection is closed, any incomplete transaction is rolled back.</li>
<li>Terminating a connection (<code>pg_terminate_backend()</code>) and canceling a query (<code>pg_cancel_backend()</code>) does not always work. For example, they don't work while the backend process is running in an uninterruptible section, such as waiting to acquire a lightweight lock, a read/write system call against a network storage device, and a loop without a cancellation point.</li>
<li>Set statement_timeout at appropriate levels (statement, user, database, instance). A short timeout is not recommended at a wide level because it cancels intentional long-running queries.</li>
<li>Set client-side timeouts appropriately.</li>
<li>Set server-side timeouts appropriately.
<ul><li>tcp_keepalives_idle, tcp_keepalives_interval, tcp_keepalives_count
<ul><li>TCP keep-alive works while the TCP connection is idle. It does not work when the socket connection is being established, or some data has been sent and waiting for its ACK.</li>

<li>Comes to the rescue when TCP keep-alive doesn't help. i.e., when the socket connection is being established, or some data has been sent and waiting for its ACK.</li>
<li>Confusing when used together with TCP keep-alive because this changes when TCP keep-alive times out. It would be safe to set tcp_user_timeout to tcp_keepalives_idle + tcp_keepalives_interval * tcp_keepalives_count.</li></ul></li>

</p></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><ul><li>Client drivers allow multiple hosts to be specified in the connection string.
<ul><li>Connection timeout is applied to each host in the connection string. Therefore, making a connection may take unexpectedly long if there are many failed hosts before the running one in the list.</li></ul></li>
<li>Restore session state after failover: session variables, prepared statements, temporary tables, holdable cursors (created with DECLARE CURSOR WITH HOLD), advisory locks, session user (set with SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION), current user (set with SET ROLE).</li>
<li>Be careful about transaction retry: It's unknown whether the transaction was committed or rolled back when a database server failover happens during the transaction commit.
<ul><li><code>pg_xact_status( xid8 )</code> can be used to determine the transaction outcome.</li></ul></li></ul></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><h3><span id="WAL">WAL</span></h3></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><p>What WAL is for
</p></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><ul><li>Crash recovery, archive recovery (Point-In-Time-Recovery: PITR), and replication</li>
<li>Updates are redone regardless of whether the transaction was committed.</li>
<li>There is no undo log (before image) or operation, unlike other popular DBMSs.
<ul><li>Therefore, transaction rollback and crash recovery is fast.</li>
<li>Changes by an aborted transaction are left in memory and on disk, but they are invisible to other transactions thanks to MVCC.</li></ul></li></ul></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><p>WAL structure
</p></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><ul><li>A sequence of 8 KB blocks.</li>
<li>Each block can contain multiple WAL records. Also, each WAL record can span multiple blocks.</li>
<li>The content is the same both in memory and on storage.</li>
<li>The WAL buffer is a contiguous array of blocks in memory. It's used in a circular fashion.</li>
<li>The WAL on storage is divided into WAL segment files. Each WAL segment file is 16 MB by default, which is configurable with <code>initdb</code>'s <code>--wal-segsize=size</code>.</li></ul></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><p>Writing WAL
</p></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><ul><li>In memory, modify the data pages in shared buffers, and then write the change into the WAL buffer.</li>
<li>WAL buffer is always written to WAL files sequentially (no random write).</li>
<li>Before writing a dirty data page in a shared buffer out to disk, first all WAL records up to the latest one that affected the data page. This rule is the WAL (Write Ahead Log).
<ul><li>Each data page has, in its page header, the location (LSN) of the WAL record that represents the latest update to it. This is the page LSN.</li>
<li>LSN (Log Sequence Number): an unsigned 8-byte integer. It represents the WAL segment, block, and an offset in that block.</li></ul></li>
<li>If writing to the WAL file fails, the instance will crash with a PANIC message.</li>
<li>WAL volume can grow beyond max_wal_size due to the reasons such as:
<ul><li>Heavy writes like loading data with COPY</li>
<li>failure to archive WAL files</li>
<li>the large value of wal_keep_size</li>
<li>an unused replication slot</li></ul></li>
<li>SELECT can modify data pages and write WAL when:
<ul><li>acquiring row locks, e.g., SELECT FOR UPDATE. They set xmax in the tuple header, and could possibly update MultiXact data structures.</li>
<li>pruning line pointers and defragmenting the page.</li>
<li>setting hint bits to tuple headers. WAL is emitted when page checksums are enabled.</li></ul></li></ul></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><h3><span id="Transaction">Transaction</span></h3></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><p>ACID: what they are attributed to
</p></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><ul><li>Atomicity: transaction rollback and database recovery</li>
<li>Consistency: integrity constraints and triggers, such as non-NULL, check, primary key/unique/foreign key constraints</li>
<li>Isolation: MVCC and locks</li>
<li>Durability: WAL</li></ul></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><p>Transaction ID (XID)
</p></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><ul><li>A transaction is assigned an XID when it first modifies data, such as in INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and SELET FOR SHARE/UPDATE.
<ul><li>XID assignments are serialized with XidGen LWLock.</li>
<li>XID assignment is usually very fast, but it might sometimes experience hiccups. It allocates and zeros a new commit log (clog) page through SLRU cache every 32K transactions. That clog page allocation could possibly flush a dirty page for page replacement.</li>
<li>This could cause an unpredictable spike of response time.</li></ul></li>
<li>Read-only transactions do not assign an XID. They are free from the LWLock contention for assigning a new XID.</li>
<li>XIDs are stored in tuple headers and visible as xmin and xmax system columns (<code>SELECT xmin, xmax, * FROM mytable</code>).
<ul><li>xmin is the XID of a transaction that created the tuple (INSERT, UPDATE, COPY).</li>
<li>xmax is the XID of a transaction that either:
<ul><li>deleted the tuple (DELETE, UPDATE).</li>
<li>locked the tuple (e.g., SELECT FOR SHARE/UPDATE)</li></ul></li></ul></li>
<li>Special XID values
<ul><li>0: invalid XID</li>
<li>1: bootstrap XID. Used by bootstrap processing during initdb.</li>
<li>2: Frozen XID: Recent versions of PostgreSQL only use this for sequence tuples, not for tables.</li></ul></li></ul></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><p>MVCC: Multi-Version Concurrency Control
</p></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><ul><li>The major advantage of MVCC is "reading never blocks writing and writing never blocks reading." i.e., UPDATE/DELETE and SELECT on the same row do not block each other.
<ul><li>Writes to the same row block each other.</li>
<li>In the traditional lock-based concurrency control, read and write on the same row conflict.</li></ul></li>
<li>How it works overall:
<ul><li>Insert and update to a row create a new version of the row. Update leaves the old row version for other running transactions. (Multi-version)</li>
<li>XID of the creating transaction is set to xmin field in the new row version.</li>
<li>The new row version is only visible to its creating transaction until it commits.</li>
<li>Once the creating transaction commits, all new subsequent transactions will be able to see the new row version. Other existing transactions continue to see the old row version. The old row version is a "dead tuple" now.</li>
<li>Delete to a row does not remove the row version. It sets the XID of the deleting transaction to xmax field in the row version.</li>
<li>The deleted row version is only invisible to its deleting transaction until it commits.</li>
<li>Once the deleting transaction commits, all new subsequent transactions won't be able to see the row version. Other existing transactions continue to see the row version. The row version is a "dead tuple" now.</li>
<li>Finally, when there are no transactions remaining that can see the dead tuple, vacuum removes it.</li></ul></li>
<li>How tuple visibility works:
<ul><li>Each transaction uses its own snapshot, commit log (clog), and the xmin and/or xmax in the target tuple header, to determine whether it can see a given row version.</li>
<li>What snapshot is:
<ul><li>A picture of what transactions are running at a certain point of time.</li>
<li>You can run "<code>SELECT pg_current_snapshot();</code>" to see the snapshot of the current transaction.</li>
<li>The snapshot's textual representation is xmin:xmax:xip_list. e.g., 10:20:10,14,15.</li>
<li>xmin: Lowest transaction ID that was still active. All transaction IDs less than xmin are either committed and visible, or rolled back and dead.</li>
<li>xmax: One past the highest completed transaction ID. All transaction IDs greater than or equal to xmax had not yet completed as of the time of the snapshot, and thus are invisible.</li>
<li>xip_list: Transactions in progress at the time of the snapshot. A transaction ID that is xmin &lt;= X &lt; xmax and not in this list was already completed at the time of the snapshot, and thus is either visible or dead according to its commit status.</li>
<li>In a READ COMMITTED transaction, a snapshot is taken at the beginning of every SQL statement.</li>
<li>In a REPEATABLE READ or SERIALIZABLE transaction, a snapshot is obtained at the start of the first SQL statement and used throughout the transaction.</li></ul></li>
<li>What commit log (clog) is:
<ul><li>An array of bits representing the transaction status.</li>
<li>Two bits are used to indicate a transaction's outcome: IN PROGRESS, COMMITTED, ABORTED, SUBCOMMITTED.</li>
<li>Stored in a set of files in $PGDATA/pg_xact/.</li>
<li>Cached in memory buffers of 128 8 KB pages.</li></ul></li>
<li>Clog is consulted when the snapshot shows that the target transaction has been completed.</li>
<li>Based on the snapshot and clog, the change by a committed transaction is visible, and that by an aborted or running transaction is invisible.</li>
<li>The actual tuple visibility is much more complex...</li></ul></li></ul></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><p>Hint bit
</p></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><ul><li>Hint bits are the bits in the tuple header's infomask field that help determine tuple visibility.</li>
<li>They are for performance optimization. Not essential to data correctness.</li>
<li>They represent whether the transaction indicated by xmin or xmax was committed or aborted. There are four flag bits:
<ol><li><code>HEAP_XMIN_COMMITTED</code>: xmin transaction was committed</li>
<li><code>HEAP_XMIN_INVALID</code>: xmin transaction was aborted</li>
<li><code>HEAP_XMAX_COMMITTED</code>: xmax transaction was committed</li>
<li><code>HEAP_XMAX_INVALID</code>: xmax transaction was aborted</li></ol></li>
<li>How hint bits are used:
<ol><li>A transaction checks the hint bits to see if the xmin and/or xmax transaction was committed or aborted.</li>
<li>If the hint bits are set, done.</li>
<li>Otherwise, examine the commit log ($PGDATA/pg_xact/), and possibly the subtransaction hierarchy ($PGDATA/pg_subtrans/) to determine the transaction outcome. This is an expensive operation.</li>
<li>Set the hint bits. They will be persisted to disk later.</li></ol></li>
<li>Setting hint bits writes a data page, and can also write WAL if page checksums are enabled.</li></ul></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><h3><span id="Lock">Lock</span></h3></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><p>A lock request can wait, even when the requested mode is compatible with held locks.
</p></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><ul><li>Q: Do you think Transaction 3 goes on to run the query?
<ol><li>Transaction 1: A long-running <code>SELECT</code> is still running against mytable.</li>
<li>Transaction 2: Run "<code>ALTER TABLE mytable ADD COLUMN new_col int;</code>". Get blocked because ALTER TABLE's Access Exclusive lock request conflicts with the Access Share lock held by Transaction 1's <code>SELECT</code>.</li>
<li>Transaction 3: Run a short <code>SELECT</code> query against mytable.</li></ol></li>
<li>A: Transaction 3 waits until Transaction 2 completes, because Transaction 2 came earlier and is waiting.</li>
<li>Later requestors respect earlier waiters in the wait queue and do not overtake them. Otherwise, earlier requestors might wait for an unduly long time.</li>
<li>Therefore, execute even the DDL that is expected to run fast:
<ul><li>during off-peak hours, and/or</li>
<li>with a lock timeout. e.g., run "<code>SET lock_timeout = '5s';</code>" before the DDL. Retry the DDL if it times out.</li></ul></li>

</p></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><ul><li>Purpose and usage
<ul><li>The data page of every relation, including all forks, has a 16-bit checksum in its page header.</li>
<li>Designed to detect corruption by the I/O system (e.g., volume manager, file system, disk driver, storage firmware, storage device, etc.) Early detection prevents the propagation of corruption.</li>
<li>Not designed to detect memory errors.</li>
<li>Enabled at the full cluster level, either with <code>initdb</code>'s -k/--data-checksums or with <code>pg_checksums</code> while the database server is shut down. Disabled by default due to its performance overhead.</li>
<li>Run <code>"SHOW data_checksums"</code> to know if data checksums are enabled. It returns on or off.</li></ul></li>
<li>How it works
<ul><li>The checksum is calculated from the page content and set when the data page is about to be written out to disk.</li>
<li>Just after reading the page from disk, the checksum is verified by comparing the value set in the page header and the newly calculated value.</li>
<li>If the verification fails, a WARNING and ERROR messages are emitted, resulting in a query failure.</li>
<li>If the page header fails a basic sanity check before performing checksum verification, the query will fail with the same ERROR message, without the WARNING that indicates the checksum failure.</li></ul></li></ul></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><p>WAL CRC

</p></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><ol><li>File system level backup (binary format)</li>
<li>SQL Dump with pg_dump/pg_dumpall (text format)</li>
<li>Continuous archiving (binary format)</li></ol></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><p>Characteristics of backup and recovery methods
</p></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><ul><li>SQL dump and continuous archiving can be performed online. The file system level backup requires the database server to be shut down.</li>
<li>SQL dump can selectively back up and restore individual tables. The other methods cannot back up or restore only certain individual tables or tablespaces.</li>
<li>The SQL dump will typically be smaller, because the SQL script needs to contain just the index creation command, not the index data.</li>
<li>The SQL dump can be loaded into a database of a newer major version.</li>
<li>The SQL dump can transfer a database to a different machine architecture, such as going from a 32-bit to a 64-bit server.</li>
<li>Continuous archiving can perform PITR. The database cluster can be recovered up-to-date or to a certain point of time.</li>
<li>Dumps created by pg_dump are consistent; the dump of each database is a snapshot of the database when pg_dump started. pg_dumpall calls pg_dump for each database in turn, so the database cluster-wide consistency is not guaranteed.</li>
<li>pg_dump dumps all data in a database within a single transaction, issuing many SELECT commands. That long-running transaction could:
<ul><li>block other operations that require strong lock modes, such as ALTER TABLE, TRUNCATE, CLUSTER, REINDEX.</li>
<li>cause table and index bloat, because vacuum cannot remove dead tuples.</li></ul></li>
<li><code>pg_backup_start()</code> and <code>pg_basebackup</code> of continuous archiving performs a checkpoint at the beginning. The user can choose the checkpoint speed between "fast" and "spread".</li>
<li>Archive recovery, as well as crash recovery, empties the content of unlogged relations. SQL dump outputs the contents of unlogged tables.</li>
<li>pg_dumpall's --no-role-passwords option uses pg_roles instead of pg_authid to dump database roles. This allows the use of pg_dumpall in restricted environments like DBaaS where users are not permitted to read pg_authid to protect passwords. The restored roles will have NULL passwords.</li></ul></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><h3><span id="Streaming_replication">Streaming replication</span></h3></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><p>Architecture
</p></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><ul><li>Topology
<ul><li>Only the entire database cluster is replicated. Partial replication is not possible.</li>
<li>One primary server replicates to one or more standby servers.</li>
<li>Each standby replicates from one primary.</li>
<li>The standby can cascade changes to other standbys.</li>
<li>The primary is unaware of the locations of standbys. The standby connects to the primary specified by primary_conninfo parameter.
<ul><li>ex. <code>primary_conninfo = 'host=192.168.1.50 port=5432 user=foo password=foopass'</code></li></ul></li></ul></li>
<li>Primary and standby versions
<ul><li>Different major versions don't work.</li>
<li>Different minor versions will work because the disk format is the same, but no formal support is offered. It's advised to keep primary and standby servers at the same minor version.</li>
<li>It's safest to update the standby servers first during minor version upgrade.</li></ul></li>
<li>Processes and data flow
<ul><li>At server startup, the standby first reads and applies WAL from archive, next from $PGDATA/pg_wal/, and then launches one walreceiver, which connects to the primary and streams WAL from there. If the replication connection is terminated, it repeats this cycle at 5 second intervals, which can be configured by wal_retrieve_retry_interval.</li>
<li>The primary spawns the walsender when it accepts the connection request from walreceiver.</li>
<li>walsender reads and sends WAL to the walreceiver.</li>
<li>walreceiver writes and flushes the streamed WAL to $PGDATA/pg_wal/, and notifies the startup process.</li>
<li>A single startup process reads and applies the WAL.</li>
<li>walreceiver periodically notifies the walsender of replication progress -- how far it has written, flushed, and applied the WAL.</li>
<li>A cascading standby has walsenders as well as a walreceiver running.</li></ul></li>
<li>Replication user
<ul><li>The replication user needs REPLICATION role attribute.</li>
<li>REPLICATION enables the user to read all data for replication, but not for consumption by SELECT queries.</li></ul></li></ul></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><p>General administration
</p></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><ul><li>The standby is read-only. Any object, including roles, cannot be created only on the standby.</li>
<li>max_wal_senders should be slightly higher than the number of standby servers, so that the standby can accept connections after a temporary unexpected disconnection while the disconnected walsender still remains.</li>
<li>Backups can be taken on the standby.</li>
<li>archive_timeout is not required to reduce the data loss window.</li>
<li>Cascading replication reduces the load on the primary.</li>
<li>WAL on the primary
<ul><li>Without any measure, the primary does not care about the standby and remove/recycle old WAL files that the standby still need.</li>
<li>If the standby requests WAL that has already been removed, the primary emits a message like <code>"ERROR: requested WAL segment 000000020000000300000041 has already been removed"</code>.</li>
<li>To make the primary preserve WAL files, either use a replication slot (preferred) or set keep_wal_size (old method).</li>
<li>max_slot_wal_keep_size caps the WAL volume preserved by the replication slot.</li></ul></li>
<li>Synchronous replication
<ul><li>The transaction hangs during its commit if no synchronous standby is available.</li>
<li>To resume the hanging transaction, remove synchronous_standby_names setting and reload the configuration. That makes the replication asynchronous.</li></ul></li></ul></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><p>Causes of replication lag
</p></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><ul><li>Hardware configuration: Server, storage, and network</li>
<li>Heavy workload on the primary: The amount of WAL generated on the primary is so large that the solo startup process cannot keep up.
<ul><li>Set wal_compression = on to reduce the amount of WAL.</li></ul></li>
<li>Retrieving WAL from slow archive: The standby could not get WAL from the primary, so it has to fetch it from the WAL archive.</li>
<li>Recovery conflicts: The replay of some operations can be blocked by queries running on the standby.
<ul><li>This is relevant when hot standby is used.</li>
<li>Reduce max_standby_archive_delay and max_standby_streaming_delay to cancel conflicting queries and resume WAL replay early.</li></ul></li></ul></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><p>Hot standby
</p></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><ul><li>The ability to run read-only queries while the server is in archive recovery or standby mode.</li>
<li>To determine if the server is in hot standby, use <code>"SHOW in_hot_standby"</code> for PostgreSQL 14+, or <code>"SELECT pg_is_in_recovery()"</code> otherwise.</li>
<li>Recovery conflicts
<ul><li>Conflicts between the WAL replay and queries on the standby.</li>
<li>Either delay WAL replay or cancel queries.</li>
<li>Actions on the primary that cause recovery conflicts include:
<ul><li>Operations that take Access Exclusive locks: DDL, LOCK, file truncation by vacuum (including autovacuum)
<ul><li>Access Exclusive lock requests are WAL-logged and replayed by the standby.</li></ul></li>
<li>Dropping a tablespace where queries put temporary files on the standby</li>
<li>Dropping a database to which clients are connected on the standby</li>
<li>Vacuum cleanup of dead tuples that standby transaction still can see according to their snapshots</li>
<li>Vacuum cleanup of a page on which standby transactions have a buffer pin (e.g., the cursor is positioned on the page.)</li></ul></li>
<li>What happens upon recovery conflicts
<ul><li>WAL application waits for at most the period specified by max_standby_archive_delay and max_standby_streaming_delay (except for the replay of DROP DATABASE and ALTER DATABASE SET TABLESPACE.)</li>
<li>Then, conflicting sessions are terminated in the case of replaying DROP DATABASE, or conflicting queries are canceled in other cases.</li>
<li>If an idle session holds a lock, the session is also terminated.</li></ul></li>
<li>Monitoring recovery conflicts
<ul><li><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/monitoring-stats.html#MONITORING-PG-STAT-DATABASE-CONFLICTS-VIEW">pg_stat_database_conflicts</a> on the standby shows the number of canceled queries due to each type of recovery conflict.</li>
<li>"log_recovery_conflict_waits = on" logs messages that the WAL application has waited longer than deadlock_timeout and the wait finished.
<ul><li><code>LOG:  recovery still waiting after 1.023 ms: recovery conflict on snapshot</code></li>
<li><code>DETAIL:  Conflicting processes: 1234, 1235</code></li>
<li><code>LOG:  recovery finished waiting after 3.234 ms: recovery conflict on snapshot</code></li></ul></li></ul></li>
<li>Minimizing the number of queries cancelled due to recovery conflict
<ul><li>Avoid operations that require Access Exclusive locks. e.g., ALTER TABLE, VACUUM FULL, CLUSTER, REINDEX, TRUNCATE</li>
<li>Disable file truncation by vacuum by setting vacuum_truncate storage parameter on the primary.
<ul><li>ex. <code>ALTER TABLE some_table SET (vacuum_truncate = off);</code></li></ul></li>
<li>Set hot_standby_feedback = on the standby.
<ul><li>sends the oldest XID to the primary, reflected in pg_stat_replication.backend_xmin, which is taken into account when vacuum decides to remove a dead tuple.</li>
<li>can incur table bloat because dead tuple removal is delayed.</li>
<li>cannot prevent all conflicts.</li></ul></li>
<li>Adjust max_standby_streaming_delay/max_standby_archive_delay on the standby.</li>
<li>Adjust vacuum_defer_cleanup_age on the primary.</li></ul></li>

</p></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><ul><li>When running SELECT, psql retrieves the entire result set and stores all rows in the client memory.</li>
<li>With the FETCH_COUNT variable like <code>"psql -v FETCH_COUNT=100 ..."</code>, psql uses a cursor and issues DECLARE, FETCH, and CLOSE to retrieve the result set piecemeal.</li>
<li>Client drivers have similar facility, such as psqlODBC's UseDeclareFetch and PgJDBC's defaultRowFetchSize connection parameter.</li></ul></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><p>Common causes of server-side out of memory (OOM) issues
</p></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><ul><li>A high number of connections
<ul><li>Even idle connections could continue to hold much memory. PostgreSQL keeps database object metadata in memory during the session. This is for performance. You can notice this by bloated CacheMemoryContext.</li>
<li>If connection pooling is used, many connections may consume large amounts of memory over time. This is because connections are picked up randomly from the pool, used to access some relations, and released back to the pool, which results in many sessions accumulating the meta data of many relations.</li></ul></li>
<li>A high value of work_mem
<ul><li>It's advised not to set a high value to work_mem at an instance level (postgresql.conf) or a database level (ALTER DATABASE). Many sessions could allocate that amount of memory simultaneously. What's worse, each SQL statement could run such sort and/or hash operations in parallel, each of which can allocate as much memory as work_mem.</li>
<li>For a hash-based operation, work_mem * hash_mem_multiplier bytes of work memory will be allocated at maximum.</li></ul></li>
<li>Low max_locks_per_transaction
<ul><li>Each lockable object (e.g., table, index, sequence, XID, but not row) is allocated an entry in the lock table when it's locked. The entry represents the lockable object, grantees, waiters, and granted/requested lock modes.</li>
<li>The lock table is allocated in shared memory. Its size is fixed at server startup.</li>
<li>The default value of max_locks_per_transaction is 64. This means that each transaction is expected to lock 64 or fewer objects.</li>
<li>The number of entries in the lock table is (max_connections + max_prepared_transactions + alpha) * max_locks_per_transaction.</li>
<li>One transaction can use more than max_locks_per_transaction entries, if those are available.</li>
<li>If each of many concurrent transactions may access more objects, say, touch hundreds or thousands of partitions, increase max_locks_per_transaction.</li></ul></li></ul></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><p>Cannot retrieve a large bytea value
</p></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><ul><li>For example, after successfully inserting 550 MB of bytea column value, fetching it fails with  an error message like <code>"invalid memory aloc request size 1277232195"</code>.</li>
<li>Why?
<ul><li>When the PostgreSQL server sends query results to the client, it either converts the data to text format or returns it in binary format.</li>
<li>psql and client drivers instruct the server to use text format.</li>
<li><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype-binary.html">PostgreSQL uses either hex or escape format</a> when it converts bytea data to text format. The default format is hex. hex and escape formats use 2 and 4 bytes respectively to represent each original byte in text format.
<ul><li>ex. <code>SELECT 'abc'::bytea;</code> returns <code>\x616263</code></li></ul></li>
<li>The PostgreSQL server allocates one contiguous memory area to convert each column value to text format. This allocation size is limited to 1 GB - 1. That restriction has something to do with the handling of variable-length data types in TOAST.</li>
<li>Due to this limitation, PostgreSQL cannot return bytea data over 500 MB in text format.</li></ul></li></ul></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><h3><span id="Storage">Storage</span></h3></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><p>Common causes of full storage

<li>Log rotation and purge are not configured properly: log_rotation_age, log_rotation_size, log_truncate_on_rotation</li></ul></li>
<li>Temporary files are created
<ul><li>The work_mem is small and/or the query plan is bad.</li>
<li>A holdable cursor is kept open.
<ul><li>e.g. <code>DECLARE CURSOR cur WITH HOLD FOR SELECT * FROM mytable; COMMIT;</code></li>
<li>During the commit, the result set of the holdable cursor is stored in a work memory area of size work_mem, and the content beyond work_mem is spilled to a temporary file.</li></ul></li>

<li>temp_file_limit can limit the total size of temporary files used by each session at any instant. A transaction exceeding this limit will be aborted.</li>
<li>If you want to limit the size of a database, table, or WAL ($PGDATA/pg_wal/), put it in a tablespace on a file system with limited size.
<ul><li>The tablespace of a database/table can be specified explicitly by <code>CREATE/ALTER DATABASE/TABLE ... TABLESPACE, or implicitly by the default_tablespace parameter.</code></li><code>
<li>temp_tablespaces can be used to specify where temporary files are created for temporary tables/indexes and sort/hash operations.</li>
<li>WAL directory can be specified by initdb's --waldir option.

</p></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code><ol><li>Starts a transaction.
<ul><li>When there are multiple target relations, vacuum starts and commits a transaction for each relation to release locks as soon as possible.</li></ul></li>
<li>Gets an Share Update Exclusive lock for a heap and opens it. Non-wrap-around-prevention vacuum gives up vacuuming the relation if the relation cannot get the lock, emitting the following message.
<ul><li><code>LOG:  skipping of vacuum "rel_name" --- lock not available</code></li></ul></li>
<li>Gets Row Exclusive locks for the indexes and opens them.</li>
<li>Allocates the work memory to accumulate the TIDs of dead tuples.</li>
<li>Repeats the following steps until the entire heap has been processed:
<ul><li>Scans the heap: Accumulates dead tuple TIDs in the work memory until it gets full or the end of the heap is reached. The item IDs for the dead tuples are retained. Also, prunes and defragments each page if required, and possibly freezes live tuples.</li>
<li>Vacuums the indexes: Delete index entries that contain dead tuple TIDs.</li>
<li>Vacuums the heap: Reclaims the item IDs for the dead tuples. This is done here, not while scanning the heap, because the item ID cannot be freed until the index entries pointing to it have been deleted.</li>
<li>Updates the FSM and VM during the above processing.</li></ul></li>
<li>Cleans up the indexes.
<ul><li>Updates every index's stats in pg_class's relpages and reltuples.</li>
<li>Closes the indexes but retains their locks until transaction end.</li></ul></li>
<li>Truncate the heap so as to return empty pages at the end of the relation to the operating system.
<ul><li>The data file is truncated if the heap has at least the lesser of 1,000 blocks and (relation_size / 16) contiguous empty blocks at its end.</li>
<li>Takes an Access Exclusive lock on the heap. If another transaction holds a conflicting lock, wait for at most 5 seconds. If the lock cannot be obtained, gives up truncating.</li>
<li>Scans backwards the heap to verify that the end pages are still empty. Periodically checks if another transaction is waiting for a conflicting lock. If someone else is waiting, releases the Access Exclusive lock and gives up truncating.</li></ul></li>
<li>Updates relation stats.
<ul><li>Updates pg_class's relpages, reltuples, relallvisible, relhasindex, relhasrules, relhastriggers, relfrozenxid, and relminmxid.</li></ul></li>
<li>Close the relation.</li>
<li>Commits a transaction.</li>
<li>Vacuums the relation's TOAST table.</li>
<li>Repeats the above processing for each relation.</li>
<li>Updates database stats.
<ul><li>Updates pg_database.datfrozenxid to be the minimum of pg_class.relfrozenxid values, and truncates commit log in pg_xact/.</li>
<li>Updates pg_database.datminmxid to be the minimum of pg_class.relminmxid values, and truncates MultiXact data in pg_multixact/.</li></ul></li></ol></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code><p>Autovacuum is designed to be non-intrusive
</p></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code><ul><li>Autovacuum takes a rest (sleep) every time it has done a certain amount of work. Therefore, it does not continuously consume resources.
<ul><li>"A certain amount of work" and the sleep time can be configured by autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit and autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay respectively. autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay is 2 ms by default.</li></ul></li>
<li>Autovacuum skips the relation if it cannot get a lock on it due to some conflicting lock. Wrap-around-prevention autovacuum does not do this.</li>
<li>A concurrent transaction cancels non-aggressive autovacuum, if it has waited on a conflicting relation lock for deadlock_timeout seconds and found out that the lock is held by autovacuum. These messages can be seen:
<ul><li><code>ERROR:  canceling autovacuum task</code></li>
<li><code>DETAIL:  automatic vacuum of table "mytable"</code></li></ul></li>
<li>Vacuum skips reading data pages if VM shows that they have only tuples visible to all transactions (all-visible bit is set in VM). Aggressive vacuum reads even such pages to freeze tuples.</li>
<li>Vacuum skips reading data pages if VM shows that they have only frozen tuples (all-frozen bit is set in VM).</li>
<li>Autovacuum performs reduced work on a data page when it cannot get an exclusive LWLock on it. Autovacuum for wrap-around does not do this.</li>
<li>Vacuum gives up truncating the relation if another transaction holds or is waiting for a lock on the target relation.</li></ul></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code><p>Autovacuum is not run against a relation
</p></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code><ul><li>Check the following to see if that is the case.
<ul><li>last_autovacuum and autovacuum_count columns of pg_stat_all_tables</li>
<li>Server logs after setting log_autovacuum_min_duration to 0</li></ul></li>
<li>Common reasons
<ul><li>The relation has to be eligible for autovacuum.
<ul><li>UPDATE/DELETE-mostly relations: updated/deleted tuples &gt;= autovacuum_vacuum_threshold + autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor * pg_class.reltuples</li>
<li>INSERT-mostly relations: inserted tuples &gt;= autovacuum_vacuum_insert_threshold + autovacuum_vacuum_insert_scale_factor * pg_class.reltuples</li></ul></li>
<li>Autovacuum workers are busy with other many and/or large relations.</li>
<li>Some transactions continuously request or hold a conflicting relation lock for long. Non-wrap-around-prevention vacuum gives up such a relation.</li>
<li>Autovacuum cannot vacuum temporary tables. Manual vacuum needs to be run. This might lead to XID wrap-around and database shutdown.</li>
<li>Statistics stored in pg_stat/ were lost due to crash or archive recovery, including failover. Those statistics are always reset during recovery. Autovacuum depends on the statistics, which can be seen via pg_stat_all_tables, to determine if vacuuming is needed.</li></ul></li></ul></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code><p>Why vacuum does not remove dead tuples
</p></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code><ul><li>Slow autovacuum</li>
<li>Long-running transactions</li>
<li>Physical standbys with hot_standby_feedback = on</li>
<li>Unused replication slots</li>
<li>Orphaned prepared transactions</li></ul></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code><p>Reducing the risk of XID wrap-around
</p></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code><ul><li>Reduce XID consumption.
<ul><li>Each subtransaction allocates its own XID. A subtransaction is started by SAVEPOINT and PL/pgSQL's exception block (BEGIN ... EXCEPTION).</li>
<li>Some client drivers offer statement-level rollback. It encloses each SQL statement with SAVEPOINT and RELEASE SAVEPOINT.</li></ul></li>
<li>Make autovacuum run smoothly (see above).</li>
<li>Lower autovacuum_vacuum_insert_scale_factor (PostgreSQL 13+) or autovacuum_freeze_max_age so that autovacuum processes the table more frequently.</li>
<li>Schedule regular VACUUM FREEZE runs.</li></ul></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code><p>Configuration to speed up autovacuum
</p></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code><ul><li>Lower autovacuum_vacuum_threshold, autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor, autovacuum_vacuum_insert_threshold, autovacuum_vacuum_insert_scale_factor for large tables.</li>
<li>Decrease autovacuum_naptime
<ul><li>Even 1s is practical if the write workload is heavy and the host has many CPU cores.</li></ul></li>
<li>Increase autovacuum_max_workers
<ul><li>Effective when there are many relations. Each relation is handled by only one autovacuum worker.</li>
<li>Increase autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit as well. Otherwise, each autovacuum worker would sleep more frequently, because cost limits are shared among all active autovacuum workers.</li></ul></li>
<li>Increase maintenance_work_mem/autovacuum_work_mem
<ul><li>The work memory stores an array of dead tuple TIDs. A TID is (block no, item no), which is 6 bytes.</li>
<li>Setting a large value reduces the number of index scans.</li>
<li>The maximum allocated size is 1 GB - 1 no matter how large the parameter values are.</li>
<li>Does not always allocate the specified size. The actual size is large enough to accommodate all possible TIDs, so it will be small for small tables.</li>
<li>For a table with no index, only less than 2 KB is allocated. Vacuum only accumulates TIDs for one table block because it does not need to scan indexes.</li></ul></li>
<li>Increase vacuum_buffer_usage_limit
<ul><li>Vacuum uses 256 KB of ring buffers by default to cache data pages, so that it does not evict pages that are likely to be used by applications.</li>
<li>Vacuum also benefits from caching pages: heap pages are read twice, and index pages may possibly be read more than once.</li>
<li>Setting this to 0 allows vacuum to use shared buffers without limit.</li></ul></li>
<li>Decrease autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay, increase autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit
<ul><li>Setting autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay to 0, which keeps autovacuum running like the manual vacuum.</li></ul></li>
<li>Partition a large table so that multiple autovacuum workers can work on its partitions concurrently.</li>
<li>Delete unnecessary indexes.
<ul><li>Autovacuum processes indexes one at a time. (Manual vacuum can process them in parallel with its PARALLEL option.)</li></ul></li></ul></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code><h3><span id="Upgrade">Upgrade</span></h3></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code><p>Characteristics of versions
</p></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code><ul><li>Major version
<ul><li>Contains new features and incompatibilities.</li>
<li>Released once a year.</li>
<li>Sensitive bug fixes are only incorporated into the latest major version. "Sensitive" includes the fixes that could lead to incompatibility, adverse effects such as unstability and security, or require lots of code changes not worth the benefit.</li>
<li>The upgrade can skip intervening major versions. e.g., version 11 can be upgraded to 16 without going through 12 to 15.</li>
<li>Always requires careful planning and testing to deal with incompatible changes.</li></ul></li>
<li>Minor version
<ul><li>Contains only frequently-encountered bugs, security issues, and data corruption problems to reduce the risk associated with upgrading.</li>
<li>Running the latest minor version is always recommended. The community considers not upgrading to be riskier than upgrading.</li>
<li>Released at least once every three months, the second Thursday of February, May, August, November. Additional minor versions may be released to address urgent issues.</li>
<li>The upgrade can skip intervening minor versions.</li>
<li>Does not normally require a dump and restore; you can stop the database server, install the updated binaries, and restart the server.</li>
<li>Additional manual steps may be required for some minor versions to remedy the bad effects of fixed bugs, such as rebuilding affected indexes. See the section "Migration to Version &lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;" in the release note.</li></ul></li></ul></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code><p>Major upgrade methods
</p></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code><ol><li>pg_dumpall/pg_dump and psql/pg_restore: easy, long downtime</li>
<li>pg_upgrade: relatively easy, shorter downtime</li>
<li>Logical replication: complex setup and operation, minimal downtime</li></ol></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code><p>Overview of pg_upgrade
</p></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code><ul><li>Upgrades a database cluster to a later major version without dump/restore of user data.</li>
<li>Not an in-place upgrade: migrates data from an old database cluster to a new database cluster freshly created with initdb.</li>
<li>The basic idea is that because the relation data storage format rarely changes and only the layout of system catalogs change, pg_upgrade just dumps and restores the database schema and uses relation data files as-is.</li>
<li>Upgrade from 9.2 and later is supported.</li>
<li>Downgrade is not possible.</li>
<li>Does not migrate database statistics in pg_statistic. The user needs to run ANALYZE in every database after pg_upgrade completes.</li></ul></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code><p>Main steps of pg_upgrade
</p></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code><ol><li>Creates output directory for log and intermediate files.</li>
<li>Checks that the major version of the target cluster is newer, and that the old and new clusters are binary-compatible by comparing information in pg_control.</li>
<li>Gets the list of databases and relations (table, index, TOAST table, matview) of the old cluster.</li>
<li>Gets the list of library names that contain C-language functions.</li>
<li>Performs various checks to find blockers of upgrade, such as the inability to connect to databases and the presence of prepared transactions.</li>
<li>Creates a dump of global objects by running <code>pg_dumpall --globals-only</code>.</li>
<li>Creates dumps of each database by running <code>pg_dump --schema-only</code>. This is parallelized by spawning one process or thread for each database when --jobs is specified.</li>
<li>Checks the previously extracted loadable libraries with C-language functions exist in the new cluster by running <code>LOAD</code>.</li>
<li>Copies commit log files in pg_xact/ and MultiXact files in pg_multixact/ from the old cluster to the new cluster.</li>
<li>Sets next XID and MultiXact ID for the new cluster to take over the old cluster.</li>
<li>Restores global objects in the new cluster by running <code>psql</code>.</li>
<li>Restores database schemas in the new cluster by running <code>pg_restore</code>. This is parallelized by spawning one process or thread for each database when --jobs is specified.</li>
<li>Gets the list of databases and relations (table, index, TOAST table, matview) of the new cluster.</li>
<li>Links or copies user relation files from the old cluster to the new cluster. This is parallelized by spawning one process or thread for each tablespace when --jobs is specified.</li>
<li>Sets next OID for the new cluster.</li>
<li>Creates a script to delete the old cluster (delete_old_cluster.sh). This script removes the data directory and tablespace version directories.</li>
<li>Reports extensions that should be updated and creates update_extensions.sql. This script contains a list of ALTER EXTENSION ... UPDATE commands.</li></ol></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code><p>Log files for troubleshooting pg_upgrade

</p></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code><ul><li><b>Do not use large objects.</b> They can be problematic. Use bytea columns or external file storage such as an OS file system and object storage.</li>
<li>Removing lots of LOBs
<ul><li>Trying to remove many large objects within a single transaction, e.g., <code>"SELECT lo_unlink(lo_oid) FROM mytable;"</code> can fail with the following message:
<ul><li><code>ERROR:  out of shared memory</code></li>
<li><code>HINT:  You might need to increase max_locks_per_transaction.</code></li></ul></li>
<li>Cause: When a large object is deleted, it is locked with Access Exclusive mode. Therefore, as many entries as the deleted LOBs are required in the lock table.</li>
<li>Solutions: Do either or both of:
<ul><li>Increase max_locks_per_transaction. The database server has to be restarted.</li>
<li>Delete LOBs in chunks, e.g., 100 LOBs per transaction.</li></ul></li></ul></li>
<li>Dealing with orphaned LOBs
<ul><li>An orphaned LOB is a large object whose OID does not appear in any oid or lo data column of the database.</li>
<li>Such an orphaned LOB would result if the application fails to delete it by calling lo_unlink() when it deletes the associated table row.
<ul><li>Solutions: Do both of:</li>
<li>Use <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/vacuumlo.html">vacuumlo</a> to delete orphaned LOBs.</li>
<li>Use <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/lo.htmllo">extension</a> and set a trigger on the LOB column. It automatically calls lo_unlink() when the table row containing the LOB OID is updated or deleted.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code><h3><span id="Sequence">Sequence</span></h3></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code><p>There is no gapless sequence
</p></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code><ul><li>A sequence produces gaps when:
<ul><li>The transaction rolls back: Because nextval() and setval() calls are never rolled back, allocated sequence values are not reclaimed.</li>
<li>Cached values are unused: If the caching is enabled for a sequence, nextval() preallocates the specified number of values and caches them in the session's local memory. Subsequent nextval() calls fetch values from the cache until the cache is empty, and then preallocate some values again. So, if the session ends without using all the cached values, those will be gaps.</li>
<li>The server crashes: Even with a NO CACHE sequence, you can see a gap in these steps: nextval() -&gt; crash recovery -&gt; nextval(). For performance, PostgreSQL does not WAL-log every fetching of a value from a sequence. nextval() WAL-logs a value 32 numbers ahead of the current value, and the next 32 calls to nextval() don’t WAL-log anything. As a result, some numbers appear to be skipped.</li></ul></li></ul></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code><h3><span id="References_5">References</span></h3></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code><p>PostgreSQL Documentation

</p></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code><ul><li>The logging collector (logger) is the sole process to write logs to server log files.</li>
<li>Every backend process writes logs to its standard error, which is connected through a Unix pipe to the read endpoint of the logger. The logger reads messages from the pipe and writes them to files.</li>
<li>If the pipe gets full, the backend could block when writing to it. This happens when the logger is behind due to overwhelming amount of logging, for example, when some combination of pgAudit, auto_explain, and log_min_duration_statement is used and many concurrent sessions are running short queries.</li>
<li>The block on the pipe is not treated as a wait event (possibly by mistake), so the backend appears to be consuming CPU.</li></ul></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code><h3><span id="Import_and_export">Import and export</span></h3></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code><p><code>ALTER TABLE SET UNLOGGED/LOGGED</code> is heavy

<li><code>COPY (FREEZE)</code> comes to the rescue. FREEZE option freezes the loaded rows and set their hint bits.</li>
<li>The table must have been created or truncated in the current subtransaction.

<ul><li>autovacuum does not execute ANALYZE on foreign tables. Hence, the local statistics may get stale and lead to poor query plans.</li></ul></li>
<li>Enable use_remote_estimate for long-running queries
<ul><li>i.e., <code>ALTER FOREIGN SERVER/TABLE ... OPTIONS (use_remote_estimate 'true');</code></li>
<li>This makes postgres_fdw issue EXPLAIN to perform the cost estimate on the remote server.</li>
<li>The query planning time will get longer due to the round-trip for EXPLAIN. So, this may not be worth the cost for short queries. You can use different foreign servers/tables with different settings for OLTP, batch, and analytics workloads.</li></ul></li>
<li>Increase fetch_size
<ul><li>i.e., <code>ALTER FOREIGN SERVER/TABLE ... OPTIONS (fetch_size '1000');</code></li>
<li>postgres_fdw uses a cursor to fetch rows from a foreign table. fetch_size determines the number of rows to fetch at a time. The default is 100.</li>
<li>If the network latency is high, reducing the round-trips by increasing this setting may help. Be aware that higher values require more memory to store fetched rows.</li></ul></li>
<li>Increase batch_size
<ul><li>i.e., <code>ALTER FOREIGN SERVER/TABLE ... OPTIONS (batch_size '1000');</code></li>
<li>By default, postgres_fdw inserts one row at a time into a foreign table during multi-row inserts (<code>INSERT ... SELECT, INSERT ... VALUES (row1), (row2),..., COPY FROM</code>).</li>
<li>Raising this setting will dramatically increase the throughput, particularly where the network latency is high.</li></ul></li>
<li>List the extension names in extensions parameter that have compatible behavior on both the local and remote servers
<ul><li>i.e., <code>ALTER FOREIGN SERVER ... OPTIONS (extensions 'extension1,extension2');</code></li>
<li>The immutable functions and operators in those extensions are considered to bring the same result on the local and remote servers. As a result, execution of them will be shipped to the remote server.</li>
<li>This is particularly beneficial when those functions and operators are used in the WHERE clause. Those filters will be executed on the remote server and thus fewer rows are transfered.</li></ul></li></ul></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code><h3><span id="Full_text_search">Full text search</span></h3></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code><p>Full-text search queries got much slower after inserting many new documents

</p></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code><ul><li>Avoid disk writes by client backends.
<ul><li>If there is no free shared buffer when the server process wants a new page, it has to evict a used buffer. If the evicted page is dirty, the server process needs to write the page to disk. This adds to the response time.</li>
<li>This undesirable situation can be detected by checking that the buffers_backend in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/monitoring-stats.html#MONITORING-PG-STAT-BGWRITER-VIEW">pg_stat_bgwriter</a> is high. If buffers_backend_fsync is also high, the situation is worse.</li>
<li>To alleviate this:
<ul><li>Make more free buffers: increase shared_buffers.</li>
<li>Make more clean buffers: increase bgwriter_lru_multiplier so that the background writer writes dirty buffers more aggressively. If the maxwritten_clean of pg_stat_bgwriter rises frequently, try increasing bgwriter_lru_maxpages.</li></ul></li></ul></li>
<li>Large shared buffers may be counterproductive.
<ul><li>The benefits of shared buffers is diminished on a host with high-performance storage.</li>
<li>That's because PostgreSQL uses the OS's filesystem cache: the data is cached in the filesystem cache as well as in shared buffers (double buffering).</li>
<li>Therefore, start with 25% of RAM for shared buffers, and then increase it up to around 40% as long as you can see some improvement.</li>
<li>However, some benchmark demonstrated that 64 GB or more can do harm.</li></ul></li>
<li>Leverage <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgprewarm.html">pg_prewarm</a> to quickly regain performance after failover.
<ul><li>After the database server restart or failover, the contents of shared buffers is empty or can be quite different from what was before the failover. Thus, application response times get worse until the shared buffers are warmed up.</li>
<li>Add pg_prewarm in shared_preload_libraries, and set pg_prewarm.autoprewarm to on.</li>
<li>This launches the autoprewarm worker, which periodically saves in a file the list of relation and block numbers cached in shared buffers. At server startup, pg_prewarm worker reads the file to refill shared buffers.</li></ul></li>
<li><code>"SELECT * FROM some_table;"</code> does not necessarily cache the entire table.
<ul><li>You may want to do this for performance test or application warmup, but it doesn't work. Also, it does not cache indexes at all.</li>
<li>If the size of a relation is larger than a quarter of shared buffers, its sequential scan only uses 256 KB of shared buffers.</li>
<li>The idea behind this is that a page that has been touched only by such a scan is unlikely to be needed again soon, so PostgreSQL tries to prevent such large sequential scans from evicting many useful pages out of the shared buffers.</li>
<li>Likewise, bulk writes, e.g., COPY FROM and CREATE TABLE AS SELECT, use only 16 MB of shared buffers.</li>
<li>To cache the entire relation, run <code>SELECT pg_prewarm('relation_name')</code>. This works for indexes as well.</li></ul></li></ul></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code><p>Tips for local memory

<li>The temporary file that log_temp_files shows is not sufficient. Additional overhead for buffering temporary data in memory must be included.</li>
<li>One way to estimate work_mem is to multiply the width and number of plan rows that are sorted or hashed, found in the query plan. Add some extra for overhead, say, further multiply it by 1.1 or so.</li>
<li>If parallel query is used, divide the result by (number of parallel workers used + 1). "+1" is for the parallel leader process.</li>
<li>Run EXPLAIN ANALYZE to see if external file is used. Try increasing work_mem until the use of external file disappears.</li></ul></li>

</p></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code><ul><li>This is a mechanism to store large values of up to 1 GB - 1.</li>
<li>A tuple cannot span multiple pages. Then, how is a column value stored that is larger than the page size (commonly 8 KB)?</li>
<li>Large column values of TOAST-able data types are compressed and/or broken up into chunks. Each chunk is stored as a separate row in the table's associated TOAST table. The chunk size is chosen so that four chunk rows will fit on a page. That is about 2,000 bytes for 8 KB page size.</li>
<li>A TOAST-able data type is the one which has a variable-length (varlena) representation. That is, a 1 or 4 byte varlena header followed by the column value. char(n) seems like fixed-length, but it has a varlena format.</li>
<li>TOAST table
<ul><li>Each table has 0 or 1 TOAST table and TOAST index.</li>
<li>The TOAST table and its index are created in CREATE/ALTER TABLE if needed.</li>
<li>The TOAST table is pg_toast.pg_toast_&lt;main_table_OID&gt;.</li>
<li>The TOAST index is pg_toast.pg_toast_&lt;main_table_OID&gt;_index.</li>
<li>The TOAST table's OID is stored in the table's pg_class.reltoastrelid.</li>
<li>The TOAST index's OID is stored in the TOAST table's pg_class.reltoastidxid.</li>
<li>Every TOAST table has these columns:
<ul><li>chunk_id OID: an OID identifying the particular TOASTed value</li>
<li>chunk_seq int: a sequence number for the chunk within its value</li>
<li>chunk_data bytea: the actual data of the chunk</li>
<li>Primary key (chunk_id, chunk_seq)</li></ul></li></ul></li>
<li>How TOAST works
<ul><li>It's triggered only when a row value to be stored in a table is wider than 2 KB (when the page size is 8 KB).</li>
<li>Compresses and/or moves column values to the TOAST table, until the row value is shorter than 2 KB (when the page size is 8 KB) or no more gains can be had. This 2 KB threshold can be adjusted for each table using the storage parameter toast_tuple_target in CREATE/ALTER TABLE.</li>
<li>Stores the TOASTed value's chunk_id in the main table's column. This is called a TOAST pointer.</li></ul></li>
<li>The value storage strategy - whether it should be compressed or moved to the TOAST table - can be chosen from four options using <code>ALTER TABLE ALTER COLUMN column_name SET STORAGE { PLAIN | EXTERNAL | EXTENDED | MAIN }</code></li>
<li>The compression method can be chosen between pglz and lz4. It can be set for each column by using the COMPRESSION column option in CREATE/ALTER TABLE or otherwise the default_toast_compression parameter.</li>
<li>Insertion of a TOASTed value could become unsurprisingly slow.
<ul><li>This tends to be seen when the target table already has millions of TOASTed values, particularly after inserting lots of rows in succession.</li>
<li>Why?
<ul><li>Each TOASTed value is identified by an OID.</li>
<li>OID is an unsigned 4-byte value, which is generated from a cluster-wide counter that wraps around every 4 billion values. Therefore, a single table cannot have more than 2^32 (4 billion) TOASTed values.</li>
<li>When inserting a TOASTed value, PostgreSQL generates a new OID for it, checks if an existing TOASTed value in the target table already uses the same OID. If it's used, PostgreSQL generates the next OID and perform the check again. This is repeated until a free OID is found.</li>
<li>If successive OIDs are used in the target table, this retry takes a long time.</li></ul></li></ul></li>
<li>The remedy is to partition the table. Each partition has its own TOAST table. Thus, the likelihood of duplicate OID in each partition is reduced.</li></ul></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code><h3><span id="Transaction_2">Transaction</span></h3></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code><p>Killed (dead) index tuples can give mysterious query speedup

This avoids its index key comparison as well as its heap tuple fetch.</li></ul></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code><p>Subtransactions can be harmful
</p></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code><ul><li>A subtransaction is a part of a transaction that can be rolled back without rolling back the main (top-level) transaction.</li>
<li>A subtransaction is started explicitly by a SAVEPOINT command, or implicitly when you enter a block with an EXCEPTION clause in PL/pgSQL.</li>
<li>Some client drivers provide an option to start and end a subtransaction for every SQL statement, such as PgJDBC's connection parameter "autosave". Watch out for their default values.</li>
<li>Each subtransaction allocates its own XID when it performs an operation that needs an XID, such as modifying data or locking a row.</li>
<li>The tuple header's xmin and xmax fields record the XID of the subtransaction that updated it. For checking tuple visibility, a transaction that sees the xmin/xmax needs to know whether the main transaction, not the subtransaction, has ended.</li>
<li>How to know the main transaction of a subtransaction:
<ul><li>When a subtransaction assigns its XID, it records its direct parent's XID in $PGDATA/pg_subtrans/.</li>
<li>The structure of pg_subtrans is an array of XIDS. For example, the parent XID of XID 100 is stored in the 101st element of the array. The array is divided into 8 KB pages.</li>
<li>The pg_subtrans data is cached in a memory area of 32 pages. The area is managed by SLRU (simple least-recently used) buffers. So, The cache can contain 32 pages * 8 KB / 4 = 65,536 transactions.</li>
<li>Therefore, to get the main transaction's XID, as many entries as the subtransaction nesting depth need to be traversed.</li></ul></li>
<li>Is pg_subtrans always examined for tuple visibility?
<ul><li>No. A snapshot stores not only main transactions' XIDs but also subtransactions' XIDs. If the checker's snapshot contains all subtransactions, it can get the job done without consulting pg_subtrans.</li>
<li>However, that's not always the case. Each backend can have at most 64 subtransaction XIDs in its ProcArray entry in shared memory. If the main transaction has more than 64 subtransactions, its ProcArray entry is marked overflowed.</li>
<li>When creating a snapshot, the ProcArray entries of all running transactions are scanned to collect the XIDs of main and sub transactions. If any entry is marked overflowed, the snapshot is marked suboverflowed.</li>
<li>A suboverflowed snapshot does not contain all data required to determine visibility, so the tuple's xmin/xmax must be traced back to their top-level transaction XID using pg_subtrans.</li></ul></li>
<li>So, what's the problem?
<ul><li>The readers of pg_subtrans contend for lwlocks to protect the SLRU buffers with the writers, who register their parents' XID. The reader and writer takes Share and Exclusive mode locks respectively.</li>
<li>The pg_subtrans cache is not so big. Under many concurrent subtransactions, disk I/O arise.</li></ul></li>

<ul><li>For example, the first transaction with XID 100 runs <code>SELECT ... FOR SHARE</code>. The xmax becomes 100.</li>

<li>The statistics target can be set for indexed expressions. e.g., <code>ALTER INDEX index_name ALTER COLUMN expr SET STATISTICS 1000;</code></li></ul></li>
<li>Indexes on foreign keys speed up constraint processing.
<ul><li>ex. <code>CREATE TABLE orders (..., product_id int REFERENCES products ON CASCADE DELETE);</code></li>
<li>You can see the time taken for the constraint cascade processing with EXPLAIN ANALYZE and auto_explain. Foreign key constraints are implemented using triggers internally.
<ul><li>ex. <code>EXPLAIN ANALYZE DELETE FROM products WHERE product_id = 2;</code></li>
<li>... <code>Trigger for constraint orders_product_id_fkey: time=0.322 calls=1</code></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code><p>Making an index-only scan work
</p></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code><ul><li>Use EXPLAIN ANALYZE to see how many times the index-only scan had to read the heap. For example, it shows something like "Heap Fetches: 0". 0 is the best.</li>
<li>Make autovacuum more aggressive or run VACUUM to update the visibility map. That would reduce the heap fetches.</li></ul></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code><h3><span id="Query_planning">Query planning</span></h3></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code><p>Pitfalls of ANALYZE
</p></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code><ul><li>Autovacuum does not run ANALYZE on temporary tables or foreign tables. Manually ANALYZE them.</li>
<li>The query plan can change after ANALYZE even when the table content hasn't changed.
<ul><li>ANALYZE takes a random sample of the table contents (300 x default_statistics_target rows). Hence, the collected statistics can vary depending on which rows are read.</li>
<li>To avoid or reduce this query plan variance, do either of:
<ul><li>Fix the query plan using third-party software like pg_hint_plan.</li>
<li>Raise the amount of statistics collected by ANALYZE, i.e., <code>ALTER TABLE ... ALTER COLUMN ... SET STATISTICS</code>. The more rows are used, the less the statistics fluctuation would be. However, this will make the ANALYZE and query planning slower because more statistics are written or read.</li>
<li>Set the table's storage parameters autovacuum_analyze_threshold and autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor to large values, so that autovacuum won't practically ANALYZE it. Then, do manual ANALYZE if needed.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code><p>Use of a set-returning function could lead to a poor query plan
</p></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code><ul><li>This is likely to be observed when the function is used to filter rows in WHERE clause or join.</li>
<li>That's because the planner does not have reasonably accurate information about selectivity. Thus, its cost estimate would be inaccurate.</li>
<li>CREATE/ALTER FUNCTION can set a fixed cost and the number of rows it returns. The planner support function given by the SUPPORT clause, which needs to be written in C, can change the cost and rows dynamically.
<ul><li><code>CREATE FUNCTION ... RETURNS {SETOF ... | TABLE(...)} COST execution_cost ROWS result_rows SUPPORT support_function</code></li></ul></li></ul></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code><p>Custom plan and generic plan
</p></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code><ul><li>PREPARE performs parse, analysis, and rewrite to generate a prepared statement.
<ul><li>ex. <code>PREPARE stmt(int) AS SELECT * FROM mytable WHERE col = $1;</code></li></ul></li>
<li>EXECUTE makes a query plan and execute it.
<ul><li>ex. <code>EXECUTE stmt(123);</code></li></ul></li>
<li>A query plan that takes specific parameter values into account is the best. Such plans are called a custom plan. On the other hand, a query plan that doesn't consider parameter values is called a generic plan.</li>
<li>You can tell a custom plan from a generic plan by the presence of a placeholder. For instance,
<ul><li>Custom  plan: <code>Filter: (col = 123)</code></li>
<li>Generic plan: <code>Filter: (col = $1)</code></li></ul></li>
<li>But planning is costly. If the generic plan is good enough, PostgreSQL uses it to avoid making custom plans.
<ul><li>PostgreSQL uses a custom plan for the first five executions of a prepared statement.</li>
<li>On the sixth execution, a generic plan is generated, and its cost is compared with the average cost of the past five executions.</li>
<li>If the cost of the generic plan is cheaper, it continues to adopt it. Custom plans won't be considered.</li>
<li>Otherwise, a new custom plan is created and used. On subsequent executions, the cost of the generic plan is compared with the average cost of all past executions of custom plans, and whichever is cheaper is chosen.</li></ul></li>
<li>You can force a generic or custom plan by setting plan_cache_mode to force_generic_plan or force_custom_plan respectively. This might be necessary to force custom plans, if the cost estimate of the generic plan is underestimated.</li></ul></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code><h3><span id="References_6">References</span></h3></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code><p>PostgreSQL Documentation

<p>Google News is boosting sites that rip-off other outlets by using AI to rapidly churn out content, 404 Media has found. Google told 404 Media that although it tries to address spam on Google News, the company ultimately does not focus on whether a news article was written by an AI or a human, opening the way for more AI-generated content making its way onto Google News.</p><p>The presence of AI-generated content on Google News signals two things: first, the black box nature of Google News, with entry into Google News’ rankings in the first place an opaque, but apparently gameable, system. Second, is how Google may not be ready for moderating its News service in the age of consumer-access AI, where essentially anyone is able to churn out a mass of content with little to no regard for its quality or originality.</p><p>“I want to read the original stories written by journalists who actually researched them and spoke to primary sources. Any news junkie would,” Brian Penny, a ghostwriter who first flagged some of the seemingly AI-generated articles to 404 Media, said.</p><div><p>💡</p><p><b><strong>Do you know about any other AI-generated content farms? I would love to hear from you. Using a non-work device, you can message me securely on Signal at +44 20 8133 5190. Otherwise, send me an email at joseph@404media.co.</strong></b></p></div><p>One example was a news site called Worldtimetodays.com, which is littered with full page and other ads. On Wednesday it <a href="https://worldtimetodays.com/the-star-wars-theory-youtuber-drama-explained/?ref=404media.co"><u>published an article about Star Wars</u></a> fandom. The article was very similar to one <a href="https://www.distractify.com/p/star-wars-theory-drama-explained?ref=404media.co#:~:text=Star%20Wars%20Theory%20has%20kicked%20up%20all%20sorts%20of%20internet%20drama.&amp;text=According%20to%20fans%20like%20%40behartwithnoe,rumors%20simply%20to%20make%20videos."><u>published a day earlier on the website Distractify</u></a>, with even the same author photo. One major difference, though, was that Worldtimetodays.com wrote “Let’s be honest, war of stars fans,” rather than Star Wars fans. <a href="https://worldtimetodays.com/hibachi-restaurant-suspect-named-by-prosecutor/?ref=404media.co#google_vignette"><u>Another article</u></a> is a clear rip-off of <a href="https://heavy.com/news/jamal-bazile/?ref=404media.co"><u>a piece from Heavy.com</u></a>, with Worldtimetodays.com not even bothering to replace the Heavy.com watermarked artwork. Gary Graves, the listed author on Worldtimetodays.com, has published more than 40 articles in a 24 hour period.&nbsp;</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Zig Software Foundation is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization which I am proud
to say makes <strong>extremely efficient use of monetary resources</strong>. Unlike many of
our peers, our primary expense is direct payments to contributors for their
enhancements to the Zig project.</p><p>Don’t take my word for it - let’s look at some numbers.</p><h2 id="2023-expenditures">2023 Expenditures</h2><table><tbody><tr><th>Expense Name</th><th>2023 Cost</th><th>Description</th></tr><tr><td>Contractors</td><td>$308,102.61</td><td>Direct compensation to contributors working on Zig at a rate of $60/hour.</td></tr><tr><td>Employees</td><td>$102,000.00</td><td>ZSF has one employee which is yours truly, Andrew Kelley, serving the role of
Lead Software Engineer. My duties as President of Zig Software Foundation are
strictly volunteer work;
I am not compensated for serving on the board of directors. The other two
members of the ZSF board of directors
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wPQtJxIgCo7SReJev-H7OZGgYt0k8LqECc4G4QYT0aE">chose my salary</a> to be $159,790 per year, matching
the median salary for a Lead Software Engineer in New York City at the time.<p>I have never once received my full salary. At the time of writing, I am accepting
$108,000/year (before taxes) and donating the rest to ZSF. In the past I have donated
an even larger portion. In the future I think it would be nice to be fully
compensated.</p></td></tr><tr><td>CI &amp; Website</td><td>$14,661.35</td><td>Zig has great cross-compiling abilities in part
due to investing in testing infrastructure for different systems. Some of these costs were
one-time costs to purchase machines that sit in our homes and offices while others
are market-rate Hetzner bare metal machines that we run GitHub Actions on.<p>Some of this cost is for hosting ziglang.org. Since our free AWS credits have expired
we have plans to switch to Fastly which should save about $500/month.</p></td></tr><tr><td>Travel</td><td>$10,847.6</td><td>In a 2022 meeting, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EqyZcd4AKu7Y9Zb_xdE_7q8i-NnqIz1BW8IiJxMX6Xc">the board decided</a>
that the previous year's travel budget successfully helped grow Zig adoption,
and raised the budget from $10,000 to $15,000. In 2023, ZSF spent $10,847
of those allocated funds, increasing Zig's presence in North America (e.g. Seattle, Vancouver) and Europe (e.g. Stockholm, Berlin, Amsterdam) as well as keeping up relationships with likeminded communities like
<a href="https://handmade-seattle.com/">Handmade Seattle</a>.</td></tr><tr><td>Legal System</td><td>$9,700.00</td><td>This is mostly paying our accountant,
<a href="https://www.stradafg.com/">Strada Financial Group</a>, to keep the American
legal system happy and keep our organization tax-exempt, but also includes a payment
to a legal firm to help us
<a href="https://ziglang.org/news/statement-regarding-zen-programming-language/">regain the Zig trademark in Japan from a trademark troll</a>.</td></tr><tr><td>Taxes</td><td>$8,894.66</td><td>Although ZSF is a tax-exempt organization, employees are still required
to pay income tax.</td></tr><tr><td>Sponsorships</td><td>$6,068.43</td><td>The Zig project is mostly comprised of in-house code, however,
it also relies on third party projects. Today, every Zig
installation includes some source files or ported code from
<a href="http://musl.libc.org/">musl libc</a>,
<a href="https://www.mingw-w64.org/">mingw-w64</a>, and others.
ZSF donates money to these projects as a way to say thanks, give back to the ecosystem,
and increase the sustainability of Zig's dependencies.</td></tr><tr><td>Bank Fees</td><td>$1,060.50</td><td>This is a tiny slice of the pie, but every time ZSF
wires money, there is a transaction fee. Our contractors graciously bill
infrequently when possible to help reduce this cost.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Total Expenses</td><td>$461,335.15</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>We spent 92% of our money in 2023 on paying contributors for their time.</strong></p><p>So far so good. You can see we’ve been hard at work spending our esteemed
donors' money on advancing the <a href="https://ziglang.org/zsf/#mission-statement">mission statement</a>.</p><p>However, if we look at the trend of donations over time for the year 2023, we
see overall a slow decline. This is likely due to the fact that we have slacked
off on <em>asking for money</em>.</p><h2 id="2023-donations-per-month">2023 Donations Per Month</h2><p>Meanwhile, <strong>user activity has skyrocketed</strong>. A rapidly increasing user base
is adding Zig to their software stacks, filing issues, sending pull requests,
asking for help, and shipping software that depends on Zig.</p><h2 id="new-github-issues-per-month">New GitHub Issues Per Month</h2><table><tbody><tr><th colspan="2">Average time to close issues</th></tr><tr><td>All Time</td><td>5 months</td></tr><tr><td>Past Year</td><td>7 months</td></tr><tr><td>Past Month</td><td>4 months</td></tr></tbody></table><table><tbody><tr><th colspan="2">Average time to close pull requests</th></tr><tr><td>All Time</td><td>12 days</td></tr><tr><td>Past Year</td><td>18 days</td></tr><tr><td>Past Month</td><td>about 1 month</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Source: <a href="https://www.repotrends.com/ziglang/zig" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Repo Trends</a></p><h2 id="total-github-stars">Total GitHub Stars</h2><p>In response to this rising demand, we
<a href="https://ziglang.org/news/welcome-jacob-young/">added incredible new members to the Zig core team</a>.
Thanks to the income that was available to us in 2023, we were able to offer
new contracts.</p><h2 id="2023-income">2023 Income</h2><table><tbody><tr><th>Income Name</th><th>2023 Amount</th><th>Description</th></tr><tr><td>Uber Support Contract</td><td>$184,800.00</td><td>Uber has wisely agreed to a support contract since
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCj2J3HcEfc">they use the Zig toolchain</a>
and want a guaranteed Service-Level Agreement if they run into any bugs while using it.
Other companies are invited to follow in their footsteps and obtain a ZSF support contract in
order to guarantee speedy response when encountering a bug while using Zig.</td></tr><tr><td>GitHub Sponsors</td><td>$145,462.88</td><td><a href="https://github.com/sponsors/ziglang">Zig on GitHub Sponsors</a>. This category contains a numerous amount of both individuals and companies. It's pretty convenient
for both ZSF and donors, as long as Microsoft keeps being cool about it. Hopefully they don't
alter the deal anytime soon. We lost a lot of donors when they dropped PayPal support.</td></tr><tr><td>Bun</td><td>$58,666.67</td><td><a href="https://bun.sh/">Bun</a> is a
fast JavaScript all-in-one toolkit built using the Zig programming language. The company
behind Bun sponsors ZSF in order to ensure that the tech stack they depend on
continues to flourish, improve, and become more widely adopted.</td></tr><tr><td>TigerBeetle</td><td>$22,000.00</td><td><a href="https://tigerbeetle.com/">TigerBeetle</a> is a database company
whose product is built on the Zig programming language and likewise sponsors ZSF. It's
good business practice to keep your software supply chain healthy.</td></tr><tr><td>Benevity</td><td>$19,851.42</td><td>Benevity helps us collect company-matched donations from employees.
This category contains a number of individuals.</td></tr><tr><td>Pex</td><td>$15,000.00</td><td><a href="https://pex.com/">Pex</a> is a company whose product helps
enable the fair and transparent use of copyrighted content.</td></tr><tr><td>Individuals</td><td>$8,710.76</td><td>This category contains people who donate via paper checks,
<a href="https://www.every.org/zig-software-foundation-inc/">via every.org</a>, or via
UK Online Giving Foundation.</td></tr><tr><td>Total Income</td><td>$454,491.73</td></tr></tbody></table><p>However, with our current level of recurring income, we will not be able to renew
everyone’s contracts, nor offer new contracts to Zig core team members.</p><h2 id="a-plea-for-donations">A Plea for Donations</h2><p>We have extremely talented Zig core team members who want to renew their
contracts, and others who are interested to start getting paid for their
valuable work for the first time.</p><p>In order to do this, <strong>we need more recurring donations</strong>. I for one do not enjoy
asking for money, but in the interest of our users and contributors, it would
be irresponsible not to.</p><p><strong>Please sign up for a monthly donation</strong> if you can. Our preferred donation method
is <a href="https://www.every.org/zig-software-foundation-inc/f/help-zig-stay-indepe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via Every.org</a>.
A fellow 501(c)(3) non-profit, they seamlessly manage gift receipts, and are not
pivoting to AI <a href="https://github.blog/2023-11-08-universe-2023-copilot-transforms-github-into-the-ai-powered-developer-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">like GitHub is currently doing</a>, which frankly scares the shit

<p>OK, queues.</p>

<p>People misuse queues all the time. The most egregious case being to fix issues with slow apps, and consequently, with overload. But to say why, I'll need to take bits of talks and texts I have around the place, and content that I have written in more details about in <a href="http://www.erlang-in-anger.com/">Erlang in Anger</a>.</p>

<p>To oversimplify things, most of the projects I end up working on can be visualized as a very large bathroom sink. User and data input are flowing from the faucet, down 'till the output of the system:</p>
<img src="https://ferd.ca/static/img/sink1.png" width="534" height="309">
<p>So under normal operations, your system can handle all the data that comes in, and carry it out fine:</p>
<img src="https://ferd.ca/static/img/sink2.png" width="479" height="307">
<p>Water goes in, water goes out, everyone's happy. However, from time to time, you'll see temporary overload on your system. If you do messaging, this is going to be around sporting events or events like New Year's Eve. If you're a news site, it's gonna be when a big thing happens (Elections in the US, Royal baby in the UK, someone says they dislike French as a language in Quebec).</p>

<p>During that time, you may experience that temporary overload:</p>
<img src="https://ferd.ca/static/img/sink3.png" width="452" height="315">
<p>The data that comes out of the system is still limited, and input comes in faster and faster. Web people will use stuff like caches at that point to make it so the input and output required gets to be reduced. Other systems will use a huge buffer (a queue, or in this case, a sink) to hold the temporary data.</p>

<p>The problem comes when you inevitably encounter prolonged overload. It's when you look at your system load and go "oh crap", and it's not coming down ever. Turns out Obama doesn't want to turn in his birth certificate, the royal baby doesn't look like the father, and someone says Quebec should be better off with Parisian French, and the rumor mill is going for days and weeks at a time:</p>
<img src="https://ferd.ca/static/img/sink4.png" width="449" height="303">
<p>All of a sudden, the buffers, queues, whatever, can't deal with it anymore. You're in a critical state where you can see smoke rising from your servers, or if in the cloud, things are as bad as usual, but more!</p>

<p>The system inevitably crashes:</p>
<img src="https://ferd.ca/static/img/sink5.png" width="453" height="314">
<p>Woops, everyone is dead, you're in the office at 3am (who knew so many people in the US, disgusted with their "Kenyan" president, now want news on the royal baby, while Quebec people look up 'royale with cheese baby' for some reason) trying to keep things up.</p>

<p>You look at your stack traces, at your queue, at your DB slow queries, at the APIs you call. You spend weeks at a time optimizing every component, making sure it's always going to be good and solid. Things keeps crashing, but you hit the point where every time, it takes 2-3 days more.</p>

<p>At the end of it, you see a crapload of problems still happening, but they're a week apart between each failure, which slows down your optimizing in immense ways because it's incredibly hard to measure things when they take weeks to go bad.</p>

<p>You go "okay I'm all out of ideas, let's buy a bigger server." The system in the end looks like this, and it's still failing:</p>
<img src="https://ferd.ca/static/img/sink6.png" width="476" height="315">
<p>Except now it's an unmaintainable piece of garbage full of dirty hacks to make it work that cost 5 times what it used to, and you've been paid for months optimizing it for no god damn reason because it still dies when overloaded.</p>

<p>The problem? That red arrow there. You're hitting some hard limit that even through all of your profiling, you didn't consider properly. This can be a database, an API to an external service, disk speed, bandwidth or general I/O limits, paging speed, CPU limits, whatever.</p>

<p>You've spent months optimizing your super service only to find out at some point in time, you went past its optimal speed without larger changes, and the day your system got to have an operational speed greater than this hard limit, you've doomed yourself to an everlasting series of system failures.</p>

<p>The disheartening part about it is that you discover that once your system is popular, has people using it and its APIs, and changing it to be better is very expensive and hard. Especially since you'll probably have to revisit assumptions you've made in its core design. Woops.</p>

<p>So what do you need? You'll need to pick <em>what has to give</em> whenever stuff goes bad. You'll have to pick between blocking on input (back-pressure), or dropping data on the floor (load-shedding). And that happens all the time in the real world, we just don't want to do it as developers, as if it were an admission of failure.</p>

<p>Bouncers in front of a club, water spillways to go around dams, the pressure mechanism that keeps you from putting more gas in a full tank, and so on. They're all there to impose a system-wide flow control to keep operations safe.</p>

<p>In [non-critical] software? Who cares! We never shed load because that makes stakeholders angry, and we never think about back-pressure. Usually the back-pressure in the system is implicit: 'tis slow.</p>

<p>A function/method call to something ends up taking longer? It's slow. Not enough people think of it as back-pressure making its way through your system. In fact, slow distributed systems are often the canary in the overload coal mine. The problem is that everyone just stands around and goes "durr why is everything so slow??" and devs go "I don't know! It just is! It's hard, okay!"</p>

<p>That's usually because somewhere in the system (possibly the network, or something that is nearly impossible to observe without proper tooling, such as <a href="http://www.snookles.com/slf-blog/2012/01/05/tcp-incast-what-is-it/">TCP incast</a>), something is clogged and everything else is pushing it back to the edge of your system, to the user.</p>

<p>And that back-pressure making the system slower? It slows down the rate at which users can input data. It's what is likely keeping your whole stack alive. And you know when people start using queues? Right there. When operations take too long and block stuff up, people introduce a freaking queue in the system.</p>

<p>And the effects are instant. The application that was sluggish is now fast again. Of course you need to redesign the whole interface and interactions and reporting mechanisms to become asynchronous, but man is it fast!</p>

<p>Except at some point the queue spills over, and you lose all of the data. There's a serious meeting that then takes place where everyone discusses how this could possibly have happened. Dev #3 suggests more workers are added, Dev #6 recommends the queue gets persistency so that when it crashes, no requests are lost.</p>

<p>"Cool," says everyone. Off to work. Except at some point, the system dies again. And the queue comes back up, but it's already full and uuugh. Dev #5 goes in and thinks "oh yeah, we could add more queues" (I swear I've seen this unfold back when I didn't know better). People say "oh yeah, that increases capacity" and off they go.</p>

<p>And then it dies again. And nobody ever thought of that sneaky red arrow there:</p>
<img src="https://ferd.ca/static/img/sink6.png" width="476" height="315">
<p>Maybe they do it without knowing, and decide to go with MongoDB because it's "faster than Postgres" (heh). Who knows.</p>

<p>The real problem is that everyone involved used queues as an optimization mechanism. With them, new problems are now part of the system, which is a nightmare to maintain. Usually, these problems will come in the form of ruining the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_principle">end-to-end principle</a> by using a persistent queue as a fire-and-forget mechanisms or assuming tasks can't be replayed or lost. You have more places that can time out, require new ways to detect failures and communicate them back to users, and so on.</p>

<p>Those can be worked around, don't get me wrong. The issue is that they're being introduced as part of a solution that's not appropriate for the problem it's built to solve. All of this was just premature optimization. Even when everyone involved took measures, reacted to real failures in real pain points, etc. The issue is that nobody considered what the true, central business end of things is, and what its limits are. People considered these limits locally in each sub-component, more or less, and not always.</p>

<p>But someone should have picked what had to give: do you stop people from inputting stuff in the system, or do you shed load. Those are inescapable choices, where inaction leads to system failure.</p>

<p>And you know what's cool? If you identify these bottlenecks you have for real in your system, and you put them behind proper back-pressure mechanisms, your system won't even have the right to become slow.</p>

<p>Step 1. Identify the bottleneck. Step 2: ask the bottleneck for permission to pile more data in:</p>
<img src="https://ferd.ca/static/img/sink7.png" width="387" height="259"> <img src="https://ferd.ca/static/img/sink8.png" width="383" height="259">
<p>Depending on where you put your probe, you can optimize for different levels of latency and throughput, but what you're going to do is define proper operational limits of your system.</p>

<p>When people blindly apply a queue as a buffer, all they're doing is creating a bigger buffer to accumulate data that is in-flight, only to lose it sooner or later. You're making failures more rare, but you're making their magnitude worse.</p>

<p>When you shed load and define proper operational limits to your system, you don't have these. What you may have is customers that are as unhappy (because in either case, they can't do what your system promises right), but with proper back-pressure or load-shedding, you gain:</p>

<ul>
<li>Proper metrics of your quality of service</li>
<li>An API that will be designed with either in mind (back-pressure lets you know when you're in an overload situation, and when to retry or whatever, and load-shedding lets the user know that some data was lost so they can work around that)</li>
<li>Fewer night pages</li>
<li>Fewer critical rushes to get everything fixed because it's dying all the time</li>
<li>A way to monetize your services through varying account limits and priority lanes</li>
<li>You act as a more reliable endpoint for everyone who depends on you</li>
</ul>
<p>To make stuff usable, a proper idempotent API with end-to-end principles in mind will make it so these instances of back-pressure and load shedding should rarely be a problem for your callers, because they can safely retry requests and know if they worked.</p>

<p>So when I rant about/against queues, it's because queues will often be (but not always) applied in ways that totally mess up end-to-end principles for no good reason. It's because of bad system engineering, where people are trying to make an 18-wheeler go through a straw and wondering why the hell things go bad. In the end the queue just makes things worse. And when it goes bad, it goes really bad, because everyone tried to close their eyes shut and ignore the fact they built a dam to solve flooding problems upstream of the dam.</p>

<p>And then of course, there's the use case where you use the queue as a messaging mechanism between front-end threads/processes (think PHP, Ruby, CGI apps in general, and so on) because your language doesn't support inter-process communications. It's marginally better than using a MySQL table (which I've seen done a few times and even took part in), but infinitely worse than picking a tool that supports the messaging mechanisms you need to implement your solution right.</p>

<h3>from the <i>too-big-to-fail,-too-cheap-to-care</i> dept</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20160712/15543134951/field-drug-tests-2-tool-that-can-destroy-lives.shtml" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20160712/15543134951/field-drug-tests-2-tool-that-can-destroy-lives.shtml">Field drug tests</a> often seem to be more a triumph of imagination than a triumph of science. They’re cheap. Some popular tests run <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2016/11/04/las-vegas-pd-continues-to-use-faulty-2-drug-field-tests-because-convictions-matter-more-than-justice/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2016/11/04/las-vegas-pd-continues-to-use-faulty-2-drug-field-tests-because-convictions-matter-more-than-justice/">less than $3/per</a>. That’s the literal selling point. When in doubt, a cop can get probable cause by grabbing a substance, dumping it into a field test, and deciding whatever results are generated are evidence of guilt.</p>
<p>It rarely is. Sure, if you run enough tests, you’re bound to have some of these field tests confirmed by lab tests that are far more precise and less likely to be interpreted subjectively by the person performing the test. (Theoretically. There’s plenty of evidence out there showing lab drug tests can be just as faulty as field drug tests, although <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2018/04/10/more-drug-lab-misconduct-results-massachusetts-court-tossing-nearly-12000-convictions/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2018/04/10/more-drug-lab-misconduct-results-massachusetts-court-tossing-nearly-12000-convictions/">in these cases</a>, the problem is <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2017/04/26/prosecutors-overturn-more-than-21000-drug-convictions-wake-massive-drug-lab-misconduct/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2017/04/26/prosecutors-overturn-more-than-21000-drug-convictions-wake-massive-drug-lab-misconduct/">usually the person performing</a> the testing [or not!] than the test itself.)</p>
<p>Cheap, fast, and easy. And wrong. So very very often wrong. Field drug tests have labeled everything from <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2019/08/16/prosecutor-tosses-charges-against-driver-after-field-drug-test-claims-bird-poop-cars-hood-is-cocaine/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2019/08/16/prosecutor-tosses-charges-against-driver-after-field-drug-test-claims-bird-poop-cars-hood-is-cocaine/">bird poop</a> (on a car’s hood!) to <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2017/10/31/man-gets-37500-payout-after-field-drug-test-says-donut-crumbs-are-methamphetamines/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2017/10/31/man-gets-37500-payout-after-field-drug-test-says-donut-crumbs-are-methamphetamines/">donut crumbs</a> to <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2019/08/29/man-spends-three-months-jail-because-drug-dog-field-test-said-his-honey-was-methamphetamines/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2019/08/29/man-spends-three-months-jail-because-drug-dog-field-test-said-his-honey-was-methamphetamines/">honey</a> to the <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2021/06/03/man-sues-after-field-drug-test-says-his-daughters-ashes-are-meth-ecstasy/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2021/06/03/man-sues-after-field-drug-test-says-his-daughters-ashes-are-meth-ecstasy/">ashes of a deceased loved one</a> as contraband, resulting in the immediate arrest of people not actually in possession of anything illegal. </p>
<p>This is just what’s been observed by those challenging these results in court during criminal trials or filing civil rights lawsuits following wrongful arrests. It’s happened often enough that even a <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/04/28/cheap-field-drug-tests-are-finally-getting-called-out-by-courts-as-the-bullshit-they-are/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/04/28/cheap-field-drug-tests-are-finally-getting-called-out-by-courts-as-the-bullshit-they-are/">few courts are taking notice</a>, in some cases refusing to accept plea deals predicated on nothing more than field drug tests results.</p>
<p>Data on field drug tests is difficult to obtain. Cops are in no hurry to turn this information over and the patchwork of public records laws across the nation often allows law enforcement to refuse disclosure simply by stating the results are relevant to a criminal investigation (even if the investigation has long since been closed). </p>
<p>What data can be obtained has been collected and parsed by the Quattrone Center for Fair Administration of Justice at the University of Pennsylvania. What’s long been assumed based on mainly anecdotal evidence now has at least some scientific backing: field drug tests aren’t worth what we’re paying for them, even if it is only $3/per. According to the Center’s <a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/24360980/fdt-study.pdf" data-type="link" data-id="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/24360980/fdt-study.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a> [PDF], nearly one third of the money spent on field drug tests is misspent. (h/t <a href="https://reason.com/2024/01/09/study-estimates-roadside-drug-tests-result-in-30000-wrongful-arrests-every-year/" data-type="link" data-id="https://reason.com/2024/01/09/study-estimates-roadside-drug-tests-result-in-30000-wrongful-arrests-every-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">C.J. Ciaramella at Reason</a>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Utilizing a nationwide survey of agencies, the report offers national estimates on the frequency of test usage, finding that each year approximately 773,000 drug-related arrests involve the use of presumptive tests. Using the survey data and national estimates of drug arrests, this report examines the impact of the tests on wrongful arrests, racial disparities in their use, and their subsequent impact on drug possession prosecutions and dispositions.</em></p>
<p><em>Although the true error rate of these tests remains unknown, estimates based on the imperfect data that are available suggest that <strong><span>around 30,000 arrests</span> each year involve people who do not possess illegal substances but who are nonetheless falsely implicated by color-based presumptive tests</strong></em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not great. Not even good. Not even close to good. I don’t know where it’s acceptable to rack up a false arrest rate of nearly 4%, but America shouldn’t be one of those places. I realize it’s only probable cause at the point of arrest rather than the courtroom standard of “beyond a reasonable doubt.” But 30,000 bogus arrests a year from a single cause — field drug tests — is unacceptable. </p>
<p>Here’s how that works out in the greater scheme of things, in terms of criminal justice:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>The use of presumptive field tests in drug arrests is one of the largest, if not the<br>largest, known contributing factor to wrongful arrests and convictions in the United States.</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s not just arrests. It’s also convictions. And those convictions aren’t happening in bench trials or jury trials. They’re plea agreements where people weigh their options and decide that the <em>best</em> option is to “admit” to a crime they haven’t committed rather than subject themselves to indefinite detention and the <a href="https://interrogatingjustice.org/uncategorized/fairness-in-sentencing/the-trial-tax-in-america/" data-type="link" data-id="https://interrogatingjustice.org/uncategorized/fairness-in-sentencing/the-trial-tax-in-america/">full weight of prosecutorial forces that love to punish people</a> for insisting on their innocence and/or seek to have their rights respected.</p>
<p>The whole system is stacked against defendants, beginning with the tests that cops treat as actual probable cause when they realistically should be considered nothing more than a hunch. This is the depressing reality of criminal justice in the United States when it comes to field drug tests and people falsely accused by faulty tests.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>In our survey, <strong>89% of prosecutors reported that guilty pleas are permitted without confirmatory testing</strong> (i.e., follow-up testing by a lab to verify that a field test “positive” result accurately detected an illegal drug).</em></p>
<p><em><strong>67% of drug labs in the U.S. report that they are not asked to review samples when there are plea agreements, and 24% do not receive samples for confirmatory testing</strong> when there are field test results available.</em></p>
<p><em>Even when labs receive samples, <strong>46% report that they will not conduct a confirmatory test if there has been a guilty plea, and 8% report that they will not retest</strong> if there has been a presumptive identification</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This isn’t justice. This isn’t even a polite hat tip in the direction of justice. This is railroading, aided and abetted by drug labs beholden to cops and almost as disinterested in what happens to people facing criminal charges possibly predicated on incorrect test results. On the law enforcement side, the fact is no one cares and no one cares that no one cares. Courts are the last hope, and even most of those are more than willing to clear dockets quickly and easily by signing off on any plea deal placed in front of them.</p>
<p>As the report notes, it’s not as though cops and prosecutors aren’t aware of the limitations of field drug tests. It’s that they don’t care. All tests come packaged with plenty of verbiage stating how any field test should be verified with a lab test, how dozens of legal substances can trigger false positives, and how tests can be rendered useless by exposure to UV light or elevated temperatures.</p>
<p>But none of that is legally binding. It’s not like improper use results in a voided warranty. It’s not like field drug test makers are going to stop selling to cops just because cops ignore every single instruction printed on the package. Again, this is up to the courts. And low level courts that handle a large percentage of possession cases aren’t going to increase their own workload by forcing prosecutors to verify tests or refuse plea deals based on nothing more than what a cop claimed to have observed while misusing a cheap test prone to false positives.</p>
<p>It’s not that better field drug test tech doesn’t exist. It does. Portable Raman spectrometers, which are capable of producing results comparable to lab equipment (at least according to the Scientific Working Group for the Analysis of Seized Drugs), very few law enforcement agencies are going to trade in cheap drug tests they can buy in bulk with actually accurate testing equipment than can cost up to $20,000 per device.</p>
<p>As the report states, the 30,000 wrongful arrests is an extreme undercount. Its survey managed to only find 93 law enforcement agencies willing to discuss field drug test use and only 82 of those actually provided enough information to warrant being included in this report. </p>
<p>Of the few that did respond, there’s even more bad news. This is quite the pair of sentences:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Twelve agencies recently stopped using the tests due to concerns about fentanyl exposure (i.e., a belief that physical contact with fentanyl is, by itself, dangerous for the officer), and two agencies reported that the tests were an unnecessary expense as <strong>suspects were arrested and charged regardless of the test outcome</strong>.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Did you get all of that? Twelve agencies have gone <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2022/07/20/omnipresent-fentanyl-copaganda-is-turning-normal-citizens-into-fainting-goats/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2022/07/20/omnipresent-fentanyl-copaganda-is-turning-normal-citizens-into-fainting-goats/">full fainting goat</a> and two agencies flat out admitted they arrested people whether or not the tests indicated illegal substances. And if arrest is the inevitable outcome, why blow money on field drug tests? </p>
<p>There’s nothing positive in this report, other than the recommendations it suggests, like refusing plea deals backed by nothing but field tests and ensuring all field tests are verified by lab testing. But if <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20161206/15130336213/more-prosecutors-refuse-to-accept-guilty-pleas-based-faulty-2-field-drug-tests.shtml" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20161206/15130336213/more-prosecutors-refuse-to-accept-guilty-pleas-based-faulty-2-field-drug-tests.shtml">very little of this</a> is happening yet, it’s hard to believe there will be widespread adoption in the future. So, we’ll just get what we’ve been getting for years: tens of thousands of bogus arrests every year — arrests that will be touted by those performing them as indicative of their tireless service to the War on Drugs. The reality, however, will be tens of thousands of destroyed lives and violated rights by tests so questionable they should never have been considered evidence of anything.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
							<p>Mixing new technology and new laws is always a fraught business, especially if the tech in question relates to communication. Lawmakers routinely propose bills that would sweep up all sorts of First Amendment-protected speech. We've seen a lot of this with social media, and we're starting to see it with artificial intelligence. Case in point: the No Artificial Intelligence Fake Replicas And Unauthorized Duplications (No AI FRAUD) Act. Under the auspices of protecting "<a href="https://salazar.house.gov/media/press-releases/salazar-introduces-no-ai-fraud-act">Americans' individual right to their likeness and voice</a>," the bill would restrict a range of content wide enough to ensnare parody videos, comedic impressions, political cartoons, and much more.</p> <p>The bill's sponsors, Reps. María Elvira Salazar (R-Fla.) and Madeleine Dean (D-Pa.), say they're concerned about "AI-generated fakes and forgeries," per a <a href="https://salazar.house.gov/media/press-releases/salazar-introduces-no-ai-fraud-act">press release</a>. They aim to protect people from unauthorized use of their own images and voices by defining these things as the intellectual property of each individual.</p> <p>The No AI Fraud Act cites several instances of AI being used to make it appear that celebrities created ads or art that they did not actually create. For instance, "AI technology was used to create the song titled 'Heart on My Sleeve,' emulating the voices of recording artists Drake and The Weeknd," states the bill's text. AI technology was also used "to create a false endorsement featuring Tom Hanks' face in an advertisement for a dental plan."</p> <p>But while the examples in the bill are directly related to AI, the bill's actual reach is much more expansive, targeting a wide swath of "digital depictions" or "digital voice replicas."</p> <p>Salazar and Dean say the bill balances people's "right to control the use of their identifying characteristics" with "First Amendment protections to safeguard speech and innovation." But while the measure does nod to free speech rights, it also expands the types of speech deemed legally acceptable to restrict. It could mean way more legal hassles for creators and platforms interested in exercising their First Amendment rights, and result in a chilling effect on certain sorts of comedy, commentary, and artistic expression.</p> <h2><b>An Insanely Broad Bill&nbsp;</b></h2> <p>At its core, <a href="https://reason.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/090C34FC92DED2E83456EB85C8E64E44.no-ai-fraud-act.pdf">the No AI Fraud Act</a> is about creating a right to sue someone who uses your likeness or voice without your permission. It states that "every individual has a property right in their own likeness and voice," and people can only use someone's "digital depiction or digital voice replica" in a "manner affecting interstate or foreign commerce" if the individual agrees (in writing) to said use. This agreement must involve a lawyer, and its terms must be governed by a collective bargaining agreement. If any of these three elements are missing, the person whose voice or likeness was used can sue for damages.</p> <p>The bit about <i>interstate or foreign commerce</i> might appear to significantly limit this bill's provisions. But basically, anything involving the internet can be deemed a matter of interstate or foreign commerce.</p> <p>So just how broad is this bill? For starters, it applies to the voices and depictions of all human beings "living or dead." And it defines <i>digital depiction</i> as any "replica, imitation, or approximation of the likeness of an individual that is created or altered in whole or part using digital technology." <em>Likeness</em> means any "actual or simulated image… regardless of the means of creation, that is readily identifiable as the individual." <i>Digital voice replica</i> is defined as any "audio rendering that is created or altered in whole or part using digital technology and is fixed in a sound recording or audiovisual work which includes replications, imitations, or approximations of an individual that the individual did not actually perform." This includes "the actual voice or a simulation of the voice of an individual, whether recorded or generated by computer, artificial intelligence, algorithm, or other digital means, technology, service, or device."</p> <p>These definitions go way beyond using AI to create a fraudulent ad endorsement or musical recording.</p> <p>They're broad enough to include reenactments in a true-crime show, a parody TikTok account, or depictions of a historical figure in a movie.</p> <p>They're broad enough to include sketch-comedy skits, political cartoons, or those Dark Brandon memes.</p> <p>They're broad enough to encompass you using your phone to record an impression of President Joe Biden and posting this online, or a cartoon like<em> South Park</em> or <em>Family Guy</em> including a depiction of a celebrity.</p> <p>And it doesn't matter if the intent is not to trick anyone. The bill says that it's no defense to inform audiences that a depiction "was unauthorized or that the individual rights owner did not participate in the creation, development, distribution, or dissemination of the unauthorized digital depiction, digital voice replica, or personalized closing service."</p> <p>What's more, it's not just the creators of off-limits content that could be sued. Potentially liable parties include anyone who "distributes, transmits, or otherwise makes available to the public a personalized closing service"; anyone who "publishes, performs, distributes, transmits, or otherwise makes available to the public a digital voice replica or digital depiction"; and anyone who "materially contributes to, directs, or otherwise facilitates any of the above" with knowledge that the individual depicted had not consented.&nbsp;This is broad enough to ensnare social media platforms, video platforms, newsletter services, web hosting services, and any entity that enables the sharing of art, entertainment, and commentary. It also applies to the makers of tools that merely allow others to create audio replicas or visual depictions, including tools like ChatGPT that allow for the creation of AI-generated images.</p> <h2><b>But…the First Amendment</b></h2> <p>Apparently aware of obvious First Amendment issues with this proposal, the lawmakers inserted a section saying that "First Amendment protections shall constitute a defense to an alleged violation." But this isn't terribly reassuring, considering that lawmakers are simultaneously trying to expand the categories of speech unprotected by the First Amendment.</p> <p>At present, intellectual property—<a href="https://www.suffolk.edu/law/academics-clinics/what-can-i-study/intellectual-property/intellectual-property-law-basics-certificate/explore-the-four-areas-of-ip-law#:~:text=Intellectual%20Property%20Law%20includes%20patents,ways%20they%20are%20very%20different.">such as copyrighted works and trade secrets</a>—falls under free speech exceptions, meaning restrictions are permitted. By defining one's voice and likeness as intellectual property, the lawmakers are trying to shoehorn depictions of someone else's voice or likeness into the category of unprotected speech.</p> <p>Even as intellectual property, voice replicas and digital depictions of others wouldn't <em>always</em> be prohibited. Just as the doctrine of <a href="https://reason.com/tag/fair-use/">fair use</a> provides some leeway with copyright protections, this bill defines circumstances under which replicas and depictions would be OK, such as when "the public interest in access to the use" outweighs "the intellectual property interest in the voice or likeness."</p> <p>But even if people being sued ultimately prevail on First Amendment grounds, it still means they have to go to court, with all the time and expense that entails. Even for those with the resources to do this, it would be a big headache. And many people do not have the resources to do this, which means that even when the First Amendment is on their side, they're still likely to lose, to cave (by taking down whatever content is being challenged), or to avoid making said content in the first place.</p> <p>You can see how this might seriously chill speech that is protected. People may be afraid to even create art, comedy, or commentary that could get challenged.&nbsp;And tech companies could be afraid to allow such content on their platforms.</p> <p>If this measure becomes law, I would expect to see a lot more takedowns of anything that might come close to being a violation, be it a clip of a <i>Saturday Night Live</i> skit lampooning Trump, a comedic impression of Taylor Swift, or a weird ChatGPT-generated image of Ayn Rand. I would also expect to see more platforms institute blanket bans on parody accounts and the like.</p> <p>The bill stipulates that imitators aren't liable "if the harm caused by such conduct is negligible." But emotional distress counts as harm, which makes this a pretty subjective designation.</p> <p>And some categories of content—such as "sexually explicit" content and "intimate images"—are declared per se harmful (which means there could be no arguing that they did not actually harm the party being depicted and therefore were not actually violations). Supporters will likely argue that this targets things like deepfake porn (where AI is used to make it appear someone appeared in a porn video when they did not). But the language of the law is broad enough to potentially ensnare a wide range of content, including erotic art, commentary that conjures two political figures intimately involved (like those—yes, often silly and sophomoric—images of Trump and Putin in bed together), and comedic/parodic depictions of sexual encounters.</p> <p>There's no doubt that AI is opening up new parameters for creative expression <em>and</em> for deception, raising new questions and presenting new issues that society will have to deal with. But we shouldn't let lawmakers use these hiccups to justify a broad new incursion on free speech rights.</p>						</div></div>]]></description>

</p><p>Situation: Company A creates a service or buys out Company B and integrates them with their website. Years and years go by, with updates to the service slowing to a complete stop as employees quit or are reassigned. One day, Company A decides managing it is too expensive and not worth the effort, so they shut it down.
</p>
<h2><span id="Pushed_out_by_a_competitor">Pushed out by a competitor</span></h2>

</p><p>Situation: Company A runs a service, maybe with a limited market (country, age group etc.) One day multinational Company B appears, covering Company A's services, and soon more and more users think "why not use <i>that</i> service if so many others do?", and a bit later "why use <i>any other</i> service, if everyone uses <i>that</i>?" Unless company A is lucky enough or finds a way to keep users, it can soon end its business, left by the users.
</p><p>Company A may end with symptoms of <a href="#Abandoned">Abandoned</a>, but also may try a redesign to keep users (this can also cause data loss, see <a href="#teh_futurez.211.21">below</a>).
</p><p><b>Exercise</b>: Think of some services you used happily back then, but now even mentioning their name is embarassing. If these services are still active (used by a group of "hardcore" users), it's not too late (but definitely time) to archive them!

</p><p>Situation: Company A does <a rel="nofollow" href="http://itsthisforthat.com/">"Facebook for cats"</a>. Company A grows a small community of loyal <strike>cat soldiers</strike> users, but doesn't gain enough traction to keep things profitable. Company A can't find anyone who's interested in acquiring them, so they shut down.
</p><p>Variation: Company B starts a service that becomes very popular in a short time, showing an exponential growth. CEO of Company B (in fact, just Joey in the garage) has no idea of a good business policy, or never even wanted to make it a big business, so as soon as the HDD gets full, he pulls the plug.

</p><p>Situation: Either Company A releases the new Singing and Dancing Version 2.0 website, which is supposed to succeed nasty old version 1.0, or Company A "pivots" and becomes The All New Shiny Company A. In either case, Company A removes their old website and deletes all of the user data.

<h2>New EU project NGI TALER will bring private and secure online payments to the Eurozone</h2>
<p>
We are excited to announce the creation of a European project December 1st 2023, which 
will run for the next 36 months. This Next Generation Internet pilot named "NGI TALER" is 
operated by a consortium of 11 partners from 8 European countries with the mandate to roll 
out an innovative electronic payment system for the greater benefit of European citizens, 
merchants, and banks. This payment system is different from current online payment 
methods, like credit cards or bank transfers, in that it offers privacy for the buyer: 
neither merchants nor banks can trace or link the payments. It is also a no-risk payment 
option for the merchant as there is no equivalent of fake or stolen credit cards, as 
payments are cleared and confirmed instantly. The payment system is socially, ecologically 
and fiscally responsible: it is not a new currency, there is no energy-consuming 
proof-of-work or proof-of-stake method and clearing is processed much faster than payments 
by credit cards. NGI TALER enforces transparency on the merchants so that states ensure 
that businesses can be held accountable for their income and pay their taxes.
</p>
<p>
NGI TALER is funded as a pilot under the Next Generation Internet (NGI) initiative within 
the European Commission's Horizon Europe research funding program. This project is based 
on the free software GNU Taler which has been developed by the GNU community and Taler 
Systems S.A., and which has received wide praise from financial experts including experts 
from several central banks - including the Swiss National Bank (SNB). The goal is to make 
GNU Taler available as payment system via two European banks - GLS Bank (Germany) and 
MagNet Bank (Hungary). NGI TALER's ambition is to reach the European market during the 
project period and have the payment mechanism accepted and widely adopted by the end of 
the project.
</p>
<p>
Under the hood, GNU Taler deploys state-of-the-art cryptography to achieve these features. 
The initial investment into the required infrastructure is low and the payment mechanism 
operates more cost efficiently than existing payment solutions, with lower transaction 
fees - a benefit that will be shared by consumers and merchants. This makes even 
micro-payments possible, creating an interesting and privacy preserving alternative to 
subscription- or advertisement-based revenue for newspapers and other publishers.
</p>
<p>
NGI TALER is coordinated by the Coding Theory and Cryptology group at Eindhoven University 
of Technology and has 10 more partners:
</p><ul>
 <li>Bern University of Applied Sciences (BFH),</li>
 <li>small for-profit (Code Blau GmbH, Taler Systems S.A., VisualVest),</li>
 <li>non-profit structures (petites singularités, E-Seniors Association),</li>
 <li>cooperative banks (GLS Bank, MagNet Bank),</li>
 <li>a philanthropic organization (Stichting NLnet) and</li>
 <li>a grassroots movement (Homo Digitalis).</li>
</ul>

<p>

        <p>On October 20th, my seven year old son Nikolas suffered cardiac arrest while undergoing a procedure at the hospital to treat an underlying congenital condition. The doctors performed CPR and succeeded in reviving him but ultimately he suffered catastrophic brain damage. My wife and I were in the hospital for nearly a month at his bedside as we awaited his ultimate prognosis.</p><p>What is there to say?</p><div><p><strong>First</strong>, I'm devastated. </p><p><strong>Second</strong>, I'm not going to be giving more details beyond what I write here for now.</p><p><strong>Third</strong>, I'll address those the most common questions, and concerns.</p></div><p><strong>Fourth</strong>, I'm making major changes to my life.</p><p><strong>Fifth</strong>, I will describe a bit about what this situation feels like from the inside. If you have not experienced this kind of tragedy, it will likely surprise you, as it did me.</p><h2 id="devastation">Devastation</h2><div><p>There's three things everybody says to me now:</p><p>"I can't imagine what you're going through."<br>"I don't know how you're handling it."<br>"That must be so hard."</p><p>These statements are true. If you haven't been through this, you don't get it. So let me tell you all about it. It'll be okay. Well, actually it's <em>not </em>okay, but it's okay that it's not okay.</p></div><p>My son is alive, but all of his higher mental functions have been wiped out. He still sleeps and wakes, breathes under his own power, and responds to certain stimuli, but he makes no intentional movements. He moves reflexively, and occasionally smiles and even laughs, but he can't speak and it's not clear what degree of awareness he still has of his situation, if any. The MRI results were conclusive that the damage was widespread and severe, and to such a degree that short of an outright miracle, there is no hope for regeneration through brain "plasticity" or any other known path towards recovery. People don't come back from this kind of injury.</p><p>That's important to say. I believe in miracles, but part and parcel of that belief is the acknowledgement that miracles are by definition rare, and the faith that God is able to grant them must be paired with a complete lack of presumption of receiving one (Daniel 3:17-18, emphases mine):</p><blockquote><sup>17</sup><strong> If it be so</strong>, our God whom we serve <strong>is able to deliver us </strong>from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of thine hand, O king.<br><sup>18</sup><strong> But if not,</strong> be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.</blockquote><p>I would be delighted to hear Nikolas' voice calling out to me tomorrow morning, but I hold no lingering hope that this will happen. That's what it takes to get me through my day. </p><p>I'm reminded of one the little flavor quotes in Act VII in my game <em>Defender's Quest: Valley of the Forgotten</em>:</p><figure><img src="https://www.fortressofdoors.com/content/images/2023/12/image-1.png" alt="Act VII: It is said that men fear death. In my experience, what men truly fear is the uncertainty of death. In all that ordeal, when death was certain, I was possessed by an unassailable calm I have never felt before or since. It was only when the hope of survival appeared that I felt the true grip of terror. - from the Memoirs of Gedemon Dalavbar, Master of Archers, being a History of his Adventures and Exploits in Service to the Ash King" loading="lazy" width="1704" height="960" srcset="https://www.fortressofdoors.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/12/image-1.png 600w, https://www.fortressofdoors.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/12/image-1.png 1000w, https://www.fortressofdoors.com/content/images/size/w1600/2023/12/image-1.png 1600w, https://www.fortressofdoors.com/content/images/2023/12/image-1.png 1704w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>My friend James Cavin, the game's writer, wrote those words over a decade ago, and I couldn't think of a better way to describe the strangeness of my current situation.</p><p>While hope yet remained, I suffered the most. The most devastating moment in the hospital was opening the MRI report. Up until then we were clinging to hope, and afterwards there was nothing left to do but to live with the loss. Our crushed hopes allow us to get on with the long road ahead.</p><p>As for "I can't imagine how hard that must be"–</p><p>Turns out, unfathomable tragic loss isn't very <em>hard</em>. It's <em>easy</em>, in fact. Easy in the same way that falling off a cliff is "easy"–gravity does all the work for you. It's not like climbing mount Everest, desperately putting one foot in front of the other. It's not like struggling to answer questions in a final exam. Tragic loss is just something that happens to you.</p><h2 id="its-not-hard-just-terrible">It's not hard, just terrible. </h2><p>The grief is different than people expect, too. I cried a lot, but after a certain point you only have so many tears left to cry. I can't cry all day, every day, for months on end.</p><p>And honestly, at this point crying feels <em>good</em>. Crying isn't really when I feel like I'm suffering the most, although I think people on the outside sort of had that expectation. There's this implicit assumption from other people that you will have a very legible grief, to "put on sad-face," so to speak.</p><p>But!</p><p>This isn't one of those essays where the author describes their personal suffering in great detail and then passively aggressively berates all the readers who haven't suffered to the exact same level for being somehow morally deficient, as has become vogue in the popular press over the last ten years.</p><p>Because guess what – two months ago I would have been <em>just like </em>most of you! Two months ago, if I were talking to someone who was in the position I find myself in now, I'd ask all the same "insensitive" and "inappropriate" questions, all the while being desperately afraid I was being insensitive and inappropriate. So everyone should just relax. I lost my son, it's terrible. No, you're not a bad person for asking me how I'm doing. Yes, everything's weird. I know you don't know what to say. I don't know what to say either. Nobody does. It's fine. </p><h2 id="what-were-in-for">What We're In For</h2><p>My son is alive, severely brain damaged, bedridden, and unable to care for himself. We took him off of all medical supports and moved him into home hospice care. This means that we stopped the artificial ventilator and IV's, as well as all medicines and treatments other than those aimed at comfort and pain relief, and moved him into a hospital bed we have installed at home. </p><p>The doctors initially thought he would quickly die after being taken off the ventilator, but he has persisted for about a month now. He receives food and water through a feeding tube, medicine for pain relief and comfort, and daily care from my wife and I as well as from hospice nurses who visit during the week. </p><p>The fact is, Nikolas could very well live for years or even decades to come, and my wife and I will take care of him up until that moment. We do not stand for euthanasia, but neither will we prolong his life through heroic and artificial life support measures. Food, water, comfort, and daily care–these he will receive from us, indefinitely.</p><p>This is not the sort of thing that can be easily outsourced unless I were to commit my son to a facility, which we will not do as it would drastically reduce our ability to see him on a daily basis. This puts a large daily burden of work, material expense, and restriction on personal freedom. We take this burden gladly.</p><p>Fortunately, we have been able to qualify for public medical assistance in this regard and it looks like we are going to be financially okay for the time being. I am grateful that I also have a strong private support network should I have to lean on it. <strong>To be 100% clear, I am not asking for money and I neither need nor want anyone to offer me any.</strong></p><h2 id="changes">Changes</h2><p>My nearly complete game, <em>Defender's Quest 2: Mists of Ruin</em> was originally supposed to ship at the end of 2023, but that's now been obviously delayed. I'm very grateful to our publisher, Armor Games, for being understanding in the midst of this tragedy.</p><p>A couple things are changing from the original plan before this all happened.</p><p><strong>First</strong>, this is the end of my professional game career. There will be a lot I have to say about this in the future, but the short version is with all the obligations I now have (particularly ongoing medical expenses) I am suddenly in the need of a much more stable, predictable, and boring career. I was successful early on, but as the years went by I found myself having to juggle development with any number of day jobs and side gigs due to the inherent instability of indie game development. I've loved my time in games, but I have to move on. I will write a post-mortem of my 10+ years in games sometime, as I have had some real accomplishments above and beyond the two Defender's Quest games that I am quite proud of to this day.</p><p><strong>Second</strong>, I am no longer a daily member of the DQ2 development team. This is particularly painful for me given that I was nearly at the end of a ten year journey for a game that's been in development since before any of my three children were born, but losing one of those children has upended my priorities.</p><p>But DQ2 is neither cancelled nor abandoned. </p><p>It was always Level Up Labs, LLC, not Lars Doucet, who bore the ultimate responsibility for the game's development, and I am but a part of that company. My co-founder, Anthony Pecorella, has heroically stepped up to the plate and coordinated the final stages of development in my absence. I am still in an advisory role and will make sure the final game is a good one, but I simply no longer have the capacity to do this with the new daily burdens in my life. I will try, if possible, to make sure we fulfill all of the pre-order campaign obligations (I've kept all the records), but I will ask for people's understandings if we fall short in certain regards or some of the goodies wind up being delayed. </p><p>As always, if you are unhappy with your preorder for any reason, email leveluplabs@gmail.com and we will cheerfully refund your money.</p><p><strong>Third</strong>, GameDataCrunch.com is officially defunct for good, at least under my direction. I still have all the source code, scripts, databases and other stuff for it, so anyone with decent web development skills (it's mostly just a pile of php, javascript, cron jobs, and MySQL) could easily resurrect it and keep it going. I have some people in mind for this already, but if you want to make your own pitch for why I should turn it over to you I'd be more than happy to hear it: email me at lars dot doucet at gmail dot com.</p><p><strong>Fourth</strong>, I now have one and only one job, which is working on real estate mass appraisal valuation technology for the purposes of accurately and credibly measuring the value of land separately from buildings and improvements. This is the kind of straightforward, steady, stable, boring work that I need to support my family right now. It also conveniently lines up with <a href="https://www.landisabigdeal.com/?ref=fortressofdoors.com" rel="noreferrer">my niche interests</a>.</p><p>And with that, I'm left with the new normal.</p><h2 id="its-strange">It's Strange</h2><p>I'm shocked at how quickly our family adapted to the situation. Our two girls (ages five and ten) have proved remarkably resilient, and help with Nikolas' daily care with eagerness and calm. We still read to him at bed time, pray with him, and sing his favorite songs. I know that he almost certainly can't hear us in his current physical form, and though I don't know how eternity relates to the physical world that's welded to the arrow of time, I like to think that Nikolas watches us from Heaven and hears us in that way (and perhaps I am watching there alongside him from the other side).</p><p>The best metaphor I can give for the daily home hospice care of your own seven year old son is a monastic vocation. It's menial work, tied to the hours of the day, an obligation and an obedience, for the rest of my life, or his, whichever comes first. Nikolas has becomes a living altar to his own memory.</p><p>I do not want to paint an overly rosy picture. I re-experience the trauma of losing him every time I see him, and it is deeply painful to see him in his reduced state. But all I have left to give him is my love, expressed in his daily care.</p><p>There are many costs, and not just in terms of time and money. My wife and I can no longer leave the house at the same time without finding someone with adequate training to watch over Nikolas while we are gone. I'm grateful that we were fairly boring homebound personalities, as this means we have been forced to give up much less than other couples would experience in this situation.</p><p>I won't be traveling much in the future, for obvious reasons, but we will find a way to make the most essential trips should the need arise.</p><p>The other thing I want to convey to people is that although I'm sad and experiencing a great loss, I cling relentlessly to joy. Since I was a small child I always hated a particular kind of tragic story, and I still feel that way today. I did not hate tragedies in general, or any story with a sad ending, but specifically the kind of story where not only does something terrible happen to beloved characters, but the kind of story where it's very obvious that the author is making some kind of nihilistic statement in doing so, sort of turning to face the reader, saying, <em>Now do you see, you naïve moron? Life is naught but pain, and you're a fool and a worm for not being as miserable as me!</em></p><p>Enough.</p><p>Look, the news media inundates us every day with endless tales of genuine horror and suffering, because in a world with billions of people <em>that will always be happening somewhere</em>. Life is and will always be fundamentally unfair, and the vale of tears filled with a never-ending parade of horrors. And yet, it's also true that for the median person on Earth, <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/much-better-awful-can-be-better?ref=fortressofdoors.com" rel="noreferrer">life is much better today than ever before in human history</a>. </p><p>My own story is exactly one such example – the fact that I'm devastated to lose my son to a crippling injury highlights another fact–that this very thing has become so rare in my country as to be "unimaginable." We should rejoice at this! Losing a child used to be so unremarkably commonplace that <em>everyone</em>, even emperors and kings, routinely suffered it until approximately yesterday.</p><p>The correct adjective for the tragedy I'm experiencing is not "unimaginable" but <em>unfathomable</em>. I can imagine it just fine because it's happening to me, and you can imagine it too now because I'm describing it to you. And because we can imagine it, we can turn and face it, and, with God's grace, we can lift up our cross and bear it, somehow. </p><p>But what none of us can do is to measure–to <em>fathom–</em>the depth of it.</p><blockquote>Stand at the brink of the abyss of despair, and when you see that you cannot bear it anymore, draw back a little and have a cup of tea.<p>— Elder Sophrony of Essex</p></blockquote><figure><img src="https://www.fortressofdoors.com/content/images/2023/12/DALL-E-2023-12-02-15.50.18---A-serene--contemplative-scene-inspired-by-Elder-Sophrony-of-Essex-s-quote.-The-image-depicts-a-peaceful-landscape-with-a-deep--dark-abyss-in-the-backg-1.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="https://www.fortressofdoors.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/12/DALL-E-2023-12-02-15.50.18---A-serene--contemplative-scene-inspired-by-Elder-Sophrony-of-Essex-s-quote.-The-image-depicts-a-peaceful-landscape-with-a-deep--dark-abyss-in-the-backg-1.png 600w, https://www.fortressofdoors.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/12/DALL-E-2023-12-02-15.50.18---A-serene--contemplative-scene-inspired-by-Elder-Sophrony-of-Essex-s-quote.-The-image-depicts-a-peaceful-landscape-with-a-deep--dark-abyss-in-the-backg-1.png 1000w, https://www.fortressofdoors.com/content/images/2023/12/DALL-E-2023-12-02-15.50.18---A-serene--contemplative-scene-inspired-by-Elder-Sophrony-of-Essex-s-quote.-The-image-depicts-a-peaceful-landscape-with-a-deep--dark-abyss-in-the-backg-1.png 1024w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://getpolarized.io/2019/05/11/portable-web-documents.html">https://getpolarized.io/2019/05/11/portable-web-documents.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39036774">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><img src="https://getpolarized.io/assets/images/portable-web-documents-scaled.png">

<p>Portable Web Documents are a technology similar to PDFs (Portable Document
Format) implemented in Polar which support offline caching of full HTML
documents, and with (in the future) improved support for video, charts, and
other compelling features.</p>
<p>Polar uses PWDs and PDFs to manage the users reading and allows the user to keep
all documents in a central repository and allows for suspend/resume of reading,
tagging, and annotation.</p>
<p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZkEo5YmNukY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p>
<br>
<h2>Why a New Document Format?</h2>
<p>PDFs are great and have gotten us pretty far to date but I think their future
is limited.</p>
<p>They're perfect for laying out text and charts in a static format plus
preserving the document long term and of course sending them via email or
storing them in the cloud.</p>
<p>But they also have a few major limitations.</p>
<p>They only support static layouts - not fluid/dynamic layouts that change when
you resize the page.</p>
<p>Don't have support for features like video, animated images, interactive charts.</p>
<p>They also have limited form support.</p>
<p>Printing HTML pages as PDFs is also difficult as HTML wasn't designed to be
paginated and without explicit support for CSS form-feed on certain items
(large images) the resulting PDF becomes mangled and hard to read. </p>
<h2>HTML in a Portable Document Format?</h2>
<p>What if we could combine the benefits of PDFs with the benefits of HTML content?</p>
<p>HTML is amazing and supports a lot of compelling features that are not possible
in PDF but they're also limited in a few key areas.</p>
<p>If any of the resources in your document vanishes it's effectively broken.</p>
<p>It would also be nice to have the ability to cache a page offline in perpetuity.  </p>
<p>HTML pages can (for the most part) be censored.  If your ISP or government orders
a website offline you might be out of luck.</p>
<h2>Portable Web Documents to the Rescue</h2>
<p>Polar supports a file format called Portable Web Documents (PWDs) (note
internally we still refer to these as PHZs since we're still in development of a
finalize document format) which supports the best of both worlds.</p>
<p>PWDs are essentially a full HTML document including all dependent resources
bundled in a zip file archive.</p>
<p>There are some associated file formats like WARC and MHTML that attempt to solve
this problem but only really get you about 30-50% of a complete solution.</p>
<p>WARCs or example can't actually be loaded properly in Chrome due to chrome's
inability to handle service workers elegantly in chrome extensions or to serve
resources directly via request handlers. </p>
<p>Request handlers can only redirect you to a new URL.  They can't really replace
content.   </p>
<p>Due to cross origin issues and other web complexities it's better to take the
entire document, rewrite the URLs and properly handle dependent resources,
and re-bundle into a new layout which bypasses all these technical challenges.</p>
<h2>Capture and Storage.</h2>
<p>Capture is by far the biggest challenge in making PWDs as representing the
original form an intent of the web designer (and the reader) as a document can
sometimes be very challenging.</p>
<p>To create a PWD we first have to capture it and this requires support from the
browser.</p>
<p>Right now Polar implements capture via Electron.  We allow the user to preview
the URL then store the data directly into a rewritten PWD image.</p>
<p>However, the web isn't really static anymore.</p>
<p>You can't just take the CSS stylesheets and  references and store them.</p>
<p>You also have to look at the <em>live</em> DOM.</p>
<p>Many toolkits like React actually modify the DOM directly and manipulate and
redefine CSS styles.  These have to be written correctly or you will break
page load.</p>
<p>Now you have to deactivate all scripts and event handlers so that when the
PWD loads it's in a neutralized document. You wouldn't want scripts running due
to potential security issues.</p>
<p>Now you have to think about web fonts, iframes, and potentially extract metadata
from the page including title, description and possibly microdata so that the
PWD has the same metadata exposed in its internal metadata manifest.</p>
<p>This is just an abbreviated list of course of some of the challenges.  There are
another 10-20 issues that we have to be careful when creating PWDs.</p>
<p>We still have some challenges now that we're unsure how to handle.</p>
<p>For example, some iframes only load when they're visible so we enabled a cheat
to expand the preview window to trigger them to load.</p>
<p>However, this caused another ugly bug where some websites like to 'auto-paginate'
so that when you're at the bottom of a page you're given a full related article
in the hope that you stay with the site longer.</p>
<p>These issues are mutually exclusive though.  A solution for one breaks the
solution for the other so we're stuck in a catch 22 until we have a workaround.</p>
<h2>Current Limitations</h2>
<p>We do have some limitations currently which I'd like to lift in the future.</p>
<p>Technically we only support static layouts. PWDs could also support fully fluid
layouts as well which would be really exciting.</p>
<p>It would be nice to support caching of video, audio, images, and interactive
charts.  </p>
<p>This would make PWDs sort of like a 'young lady's illustrated primer' (if you've
ever read Diamond Age) where a book is now fully interactive.</p>
<p>This would also mean that this interactivity would work offline and be fully
interactive!  </p>
<p>Right now Polar is limited to capturing within Electron which means we can't
access the user's cookies and prevents some URLs from loading properly.</p>
<p>We're porting our capture code to our chrome extension to mitigate this and
this should be fixed shortly.</p>
<h2>The Future</h2>
<p>Polar wanted something like PWDs so that we can enable some cool features in the
future.</p>
<p>The first (which we have now actually) is just full offline archival of web
pages to prevent them from being deleted.  If the content is important you don't
want it to vanish.</p>
<p>We also want a way for users to collaborate around web content.  Add
annotations, comments, etc.</p>
<p>We ideally don't want the content to vanish so PWDs allow us to keep it
associated with the users document store.</p>
<p>We'd also like to enable features where users can exchange documents directly
without relying on the original site.</p>
<p>This allows us to bypass censorship for documents that might be sensitive
outside of their host country.  </p>
<p>We also want to support video, audio, and interactive charting formats. Video
is a bit difficult as we need to determine how to stream and store the video
within the compressed archive and stream it efficiently.  </p>
<p>Our plan is to use web workers and service workers to decompress it in a
background thread.</p>
<p>Interactive charts and spreadsheets are also compelling but I don't want to just
enable raw Javascript support.  It might be possible that something like WASM
could solve this by putting the controls in a sandbox.</p>
<p>We also need a strategy to preserve teh fonts long term.  Right now we don't
store the fonts along with the PWD because they can increase the size by about
2x.  </p>
<p>It might be nice for a system like Polar to have sort of a shared CDN so that
fonts are only stored once but this creates problems with dependencies which
aren't ideal.</p>
<h2>Working with Portable Web Documents</h2>
<p>If you'd like to play with the current version of PWDs download Polar and take
it for a spin.</p>
<p>Right now you can view them in the webapp but can't create them so you need to
download the desktop version of Polar.</p>
<p>We're planning on fixing this issue in the next big refactor to embed the

                  Web Components
                </h2><p>Web Components are a set of browser APIs that allow us to create custom HTML elements. <strong>They are one of the major things that SPA (Single Page Application) frameworks have been giving us for a long time.</strong> Frameworks like Vue, React, Angular or Svelte have their own approach and APIs for creating and using reusable, isolated UI components. This framework-specific philosophy has been widely used for quite a long time right now. It has a few unfortunate consequences:</p>
<ul>
<li>It depends on a specific framework </li>
<li>Complexity - to be used productively, most SPA frameworks require complex tooling and host of dependencies</li>
<li>Components can be reused only in the context of a specific framework</li>
<li>Framework updates often render components not usable anymore (anyone has changed, or tried to, major versions of Vue or React recently?)</li>
<li>If we decide to change the framework, we have to throw away our own components or a library we were using, and migrate to another one. This new library might not have everything that we need or may have a completely different API</li>
<li>We need to learn the specifics of each framework in order to use and create components. This knowledge is framework-specific and not universal at all</li>
</ul>
<p><br>Luckily, for quite a long time right now, we have <em>Web Components</em>, native to the browser way of creating reusable, custom HTML elements. In a nutshell, <strong>we can encapsulate any behavior we want in the specific JavaScript class. We can then use it in the HTML, in the same way as we use <em>div</em>, <em>p</em>, <em>input</em>, <em>button</em> or any other, browser-native element</strong>.</p>
<p>Creating <em>Web Components</em> is extremely straightforward. To illustrate, let's say that we would like to have something like this:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;custom-message 
  category="Curiosities" 
  message="Some interesting message"&gt;
&lt;/custom-message&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>All we need is a few lines of JavaScript:</p>
<pre><code>class CustomMessage extends HTMLElement {
  constructor() {
    super();
    const category = this.getAttribute("category");
    const message = this.getAttribute("message");
    this.innerHTML = `
      &lt;div&gt;You've got an interesting message, from ${category} category:&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;${message}&lt;/div&gt;`;
  }
}

customElements.define('custom-message', CustomMessage);
</code></pre>
<p><strong>That is all! No extra tooling and zero dependencies required.</strong> If we add to this the ability to observe attribute values changes and lifecycle callbacks:</p>
<pre><code>...

static observedAttributes = ["category", "message"];

attributeChangedCallback(name, oldValue, newValue) {
  console.log(`${name} attribute was changed from ${oldValue} to ${newValue}!`);
}

connectedCallback() {
  console.log("Element was added to the DOM!");
}

disconnectedCallback() {
  console.log("Element was removed from the DOM!");    
}

...
</code></pre>
<p>...there is virtually no limit to what we can do with <em>Web Components</em>! Moreover, <strong>there is also a possibility of creating Shadow (hidden) DOM with scoped CSS, but it is quite complex, has its drawbacks and is frankly not needed in the majority of cases</strong>. Because of that, we will stick with the basics here:</p>
<ul>
<li>creating custom elements in JavaScript by extending <em>HTMLElement</em> class and registering them in the <em>customElements</em> registry</li>
<li>consuming custom elements in the HTML</li>
<li>using plain old DOM (Document Object Model) and CSS</li>
<li>using lifecycle callbacks and attributes change observers</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, we shall ask the question: how and why can we utilize <em>Web Components</em> in the context of <em>HTMX</em>?</p>

                <h2 id="htmx">
                  HTMX
                </h2><p>I wrote quite an extensive article about <a href="https://htmx.org/" target="_blank"><em>HTMX</em></a> which you can find <a href="https://binaryigor.com/htmx-simpler-web-based-app-or-system.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
For the sake of completeness, let's give a short definition: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>HTMX is a JavaScript library that allows making arbitrary http requests from any HTML element, not only from forms, links or videos. It expects HTML in response, and renders whole HTML pages or fragments directly in the page section we have specified. We do not need to exchange JSON or any other data format with the server only to then translate it to HTML on the client side, so that it can be rendered. It is done automatically by HTMX, we just need to use its own, custom HTML attributes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br>It is highly interesting, useful and a promising technology. It simplifies many things and allows us to build <em>SPA</em> or <em>SPA-like</em> applications without complex tooling, dependencies, frameworks and mostly without writing application-specific JavaScript code. In a way, it is a JavaScript library thanks to which we do not need to write our own JavaScript. We can just have one application, no frontend/backend distinction, and that is it (simplifying a little of course, but <a href="https://www.ufried.com/blog/simplify_1/" target="_blank">it simplifies soo many things</a>). There is one thing that I find missing though. There is no straightforward way to create isolated and reusable components where we can encapsulate HTML templates and JavaScript (if needed) related to a given component. <strong>Wouldn't it be amazing, if we can create a library of reusable, framework-agnostic components that can be then used in all HTMX-based applications?</strong> All of that is perfectly doable with Web Components, so let's dive in!</p>

                <h2 id="assumptions">
                  Assumptions
                </h2><p>In our solution, we make the following assumptions:</p>
<ol>
<li>We will not use <em>Shadow DOM</em>. HTMX does not work with it and I would argue that it complicates things and is mostly not needed to create useful, isolated and reusable Web Components</li>
<li>We will make our components fully configurable from the outside. This generic approach will allow us to arbitrarily, externally style these components, make using them together with HTMX extremely simple, and at the same time components do not need to know anything about HTMX</li>
<li>For styling, we will use <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" target="_blank">Tailwind CSS</a>. We could also use custom, scoped CSS, but it is significantly easier to do with Tailwind, and it is an amazing and astoundingly simple tool on its own, so why not use it? </li>
<li>This is about <em>Web Components</em> in the context of <em>HTMX</em> afterall, so they need to be easy to use together. Luckily, point <em>2.</em> covers us here</li>
</ol>

                <h2 id="solution-walkthrough">
                  Solution walkthrough
                </h2><p>Repo with referenced code, all and more examples can be found <a href="https://github.com/BinaryIgor/code-examples/tree/master/flexible-web-components" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>I wanted to be as generic as possible, but at the same time to have as simple API as possible, so to make configuring our components simple (by HTML attributes) I have come up with the following convention:</p>
<pre><code>{component-element}:{attribute}="{value}"
</code></pre>
<p>To illustrate how it works, here is the <em>InfoModal</em> example (classes are from Tailwind CSS):</p>
<pre><code>&lt;info-modal 
  id="info-modal" 
  container:class="bg-black/80"
  content:class="bg-amber-300 border-solid border-4 border-black rounded-md m-auto mt-32 px-8 pt-8 pb-32 w-3/5"
  message:class="text-lg italic"
  close:class="text-2xl p-4 cursor-pointer"
  close-icon="&amp;#10006;"&gt;
&lt;/info-modal&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Basically, <em>container:*</em> attributes will be copied without <em>container:</em> prefix to the <em>container element</em> of the <em>info-modal</em> component. <em>Content:*</em> attributes will be copied without <em>content:</em> prefix to the <em>content element</em> and so on, for all supported and exposed elements of the <em>info-modal</em> component. Resulting HTML is as follows:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;info-modal 
  id="info-modal" 
  container:class="bg-black/80" 
  content:class="bg-amber-300 border-solid border-4 border-black rounded-md m-auto mt-32 px-8 pt-8 pb-32 w-3/5" 
  message:class="text-lg italic" 
  close:class="text-2xl p-4 cursor-pointer"
  close-icon="&amp;#10006;"&gt;

  &lt;!-- style attributes are set internally by the component --&gt;
  &lt;div 
    style="display: none;" 
    &lt;!-- container has its own non-overridable class, ours is appended --&gt;
    class="fixed z-10 left-0 top-0 w-full h-full overflow-auto bg-black/80"&gt;
    &lt;div 
      style="position: relative;" 
      class="bg-amber-300 border-solid border-4 border-black rounded-md m-auto mt-32 px-8 pt-8 pb-32 w-3/5"&gt;
      &lt;span 
        &lt;!-- close has its own non-overridable class, ours is appended --&gt;
        class="absolute top-0 right-0 text-2xl p-4 cursor-pointer"&gt;
          &amp;#10006;
      &lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;!-- title has its own default class --&gt;
      &lt;div class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2"&gt;Default title&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;!-- message does not have a default class, ours is set --&gt;
      &lt;div class="text-lg italic"&gt;Default message&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/info-modal&gt;
</code></pre>
<p><br>To make it possible, I created a <em>Components object</em>, which has the following, main method:</p>
<pre><code>export const Components = {
  // element is a custom element reference,
  // elementId is a name of atrributes element,
  // like "container", "content", "input" and so on
  mappedAttributes(element, elementId,
    { defaultAttributes = {},
      defaultClass = "",
      // add (concatenate) attributes/class to the current ones
      toAddAttributes = {},
      toAddClass = "",
      // skip some attributes while copying/transforming
      toSkipAttributes = [],
      // change content:class to class, 
      // while copying attributes, or keep it as it is
      keepId = false } = {}) {

    let baseAttributes = baseAtrributesFromDefaults(defaultAttributes, defaultClass);

    let mappedAttributes = mappedAttributesWithDefaults(element, elementId, baseAttributes, toSkipAttributes, keepId);

    mappedAttributes = mappedAttributesWithToAddValues(mappedAttributes, toAddAttributes, toAddClass);

    // turn this map of element attributes into a string like:
    // id="custom-element-id"
    // class="custom-element-class"
    // hx-post="/validate"
    return Object.entries(mappedAttributes)
      .map(e =&gt; `${e[0]}="${e[1]}"`)
      .join("\n");
},

...
</code></pre>
<p>Default attributes will be overridden by anything that a client supplies and additional attributes will be added to the current ones, using simple string concatenation. <em>DefaultClass</em> and <em>toAddClass</em> are treated in the same way as <em>defaultAttributes</em> and <em>toAddAttributes</em> - they are separate parameters for the sake of API simplicity.</p>
<p>We then make use of the <em>Components object</em> in our custom components (<em>InfoModal</em> again):</p>
<pre><code>...

const containerAttributes = Components.mappedAttributes(this, "container", {
  toAddClass: containerClass,
  defaultClass: containerClassDefault
});
const contentAttributes = Components.mappedAttributes(this, "content", {
  defaultClass: contentClassDefault
});

...

this.innerHTML = `
&lt;div style="display: none;" ${containerAttributes}&gt;
  &lt;div style="position: relative;" ${contentAttributes}&gt;
    &lt;span ${closeAttributes}&gt;${closeIcon}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;div ${titleAttributes}&gt;${titleToRender}&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div ${messageAttributes}&gt;${messageToRender}&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;`;

...
</code></pre>
<p>As we can see, <strong>this is extremely generic and has nothing to do with HTMX: we just allow to inject arbitrary, external attributes into all elements exposed by a component</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Using HTMX is mostly about setting its attributes on HTML elements.</strong> Our generic approach has thus interesting consequences: we can take components created in that way (without any knowledge about HTMX) and use them together with HTMX in the following manner (<em>InputWithError</em>):</p>
<pre><code>&lt;input-with-error 
  input:type="text"
  input:name="message"
  input:placeholder="Input something..."
  &lt;!-- HTMX starts here --&gt;
  input:hx-post="/validate"
  input:hx-trigger="input changed delay:500ms"
  input:hx-swap="outerHTML"
  input:hx-target="next input-error"&gt;
&lt;/input-with-error&gt;
</code></pre>

                <h2 id="htmx-examples">
                  HTMX examples
                </h2><p>Let's walk through a few concrete examples of <em>Web Components</em> used together with <em>HTMX</em>.</p>

                <h3 id="confirmable-modal">
                  Confirmable Modal
                </h3><p>We quite often face a need for certain requests to be confirmed by the user, before actually issuing them. There is a special HTMX attribute that we can use for that purpose: <a href="https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-confirm/" target="_blank">hx-confirm</a>. Having <em>confirmable-modal</em> similar to <em>info-modal</em> from one of the previous examples, we can write the following HTML:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;confirmable-modal 
  title="Delete confirmation"
  ok-text="Delete"&gt;
&lt;/confirmable-modal&gt;

&lt;button 
  hx-delete="/test"
  hx-confirm="Are you sure to delete this test entity?"
  hx-target="#delete-result"&gt;
  Try to confirm
&lt;/button&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>To capture requests, sent by HTMX, and show <em>confirmable-modal</em> beforehand, we need to add the following JavaScript to our page:</p>
<pre><code>const confirmableModal = document.querySelector("confirmable-modal");

document.addEventListener("htmx:confirm", e =&gt; {
  // do not issue http request
  e.preventDefault();

  confirmableModal.onOk = () =&gt; {
    // ok clicked, issue stopped previously http request
    e.detail.issueRequest(e);
    // hide modal after sending the request
    confirmableModal.hide();
  };

  // show confirmable modal with question configured through htmx attribute
  confirmableModal.show({ message: e.detail.question });
});
</code></pre>
<p>This will show our modal before issuing a http request which looks like:</p>

</figure>



                <h3 id="order-form-and-list">
                  Order Form and List
                </h3><p>Building on previously shown <em>input-with-error</em> and <em>info-modal</em>, we can have a <em>form-container</em> that provides common form functionalities. As the name suggests, it is just a container, so it accepts and can work with any number of inputs, specification of which is left completely to a client. Common form functionalities include features like enabling/disabling form submission, clearing all inputs after successful submission, or showing generic error after failed submission. In the context of HTMX, having a form element allows us to send all form inputs data in a straightforward way. To make the example more relevant to HTMX, in the form we will be able to specify a new <em>order</em> entity. After failed submission, an error will be shown, using <em>info-modal</em>. After successful submission, a new <em>order</em> will be added to the orders list. Here is the simplified HTML:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;info-modal 
  id="error-modal" 
  &lt;!-- Add value to default title class attribute --&gt;
  title:add:class="text-red-500" 
  title="Something went wrong..."&gt;
&lt;/info-modal&gt;

&lt;form-container
  form:id="order-form"
  form:class="rounded bg-slate-200 p-2 max-w-screen-md"
  form:hx-post="/orders"
  form:hx-target="#orders"
  submit:class="py-2 rounded bg-slate-100 mt-4 w-full"
  submit:value="Add Order"&gt;

  &lt;input-with-error 
    container:class="mb-2"
    &lt;!-- Add value to default input class attribute --&gt;
    input:add:class="w-full"
    input:name="id"
    input:placeholder="Order id"
    input:hx-post="/orders/validate-id"
    input:hx-trigger="input changed delay:500ms"
    input:hx-swap="outerHTML"
    input:hx-target="next-input-error"
    &lt;!-- Send also secret input from below (secret-input is its id),
     id and secret validations are related --&gt;
    input:hx-include="#secret-input"&gt;
  &lt;/input-with-error&gt;
    
  &lt;!-- Similar to above, definitions of other inputs:
   name, description, secret --&gt;

&lt;/form-container&gt;

&lt;ul id="orders" class="space-y-2 max-w-screen-md"&gt;
  ${ordersHtml()}
&lt;/ul&gt;

...

function ordersHtml() {
  return orders.map(o =&gt;
  `&lt;div class="rounded bg-slate-100 p-2"&gt;
     &lt;div&gt;Id: ${o.id}&lt;/div&gt;
     &lt;div&gt;Name: ${o.name}&lt;/div&gt;
     &lt;div&gt;Description: ${o.description}&lt;/div&gt;
     &lt;div&gt;Secret: ${o.secret}&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;`)
  .join("\n");
}
</code></pre>
<p><br>Additionally, we need to add some JavaScript, so that <em>info-modal</em> and a few of the <em>form-container</em> features can work:</p>
<pre><code>const errorModal = document.getElementById("error-modal");

const formContainer = document.querySelector("form-container");

formContainer.addEventListener("htmx:afterRequest", e =&gt; {
  const form = document.getElementById("order-form");
  // we only care about requests sent by the form,
  // not other of its many elements (inputs mainly)
  if (e.srcElement == form) {
    // error text response from the server
    const error = e.detail.failed ? e.detail.xhr.response : "";
    // this will enable form submission again,
    // and clear inputs only if error is empty/undefined
    formContainer.afterSubmit({ error: error });
    // show error only if there is one
    if (error) {
      errorModal.show({ message: error });
    }
  }
});
</code></pre>
<p><br>This how it looks with input errors:</p>

                <h2 id="flexible-and-copyable-web-components-collection">
                  Flexible and Copyable Web Components collection
                </h2><p>With the described approach, it is possible to create a collection of generic, reusable, flexible and framework-agnostic Web Components. <strong>When it comes to UI components, I think white box philosophy is superior: we should have access to the simple source code of components, they should be designed to be copied and possibly tinker with, and not used as a black box dependency.</strong> This is because, it is often the case that a given component <em>almost</em> matches our needs, but not exactly - in that situation it is a true lifesaver to have control and ability to change them. <a href="https://tailwindui.com/" target="_blank">Tailwind UI</a> takes a similar approach, but is not open-sourced; it is a paid tool and it focuses on framework-specific components.</p>
<p>There are a few libraries and collections of Web Components out there, most notably <a href="https://shoelace.style/" target="_blank">Shoelace</a>. This is a step in the right direction, but unfortunately, they also use other tools, dependencies and additional abstractions and take a rather black box approach - they are meant to be used as a closed dependency, not something to copy, understand and tinker with. Additionally, they mostly use <em>Shadow DOM</em> and because of that, they can not be used with <em>HTMX</em>. I would love to see a collection of components created with a similar approach to the one described here: without unnecessary abstractions and with different, white box philosophy in mind. It means that these components would have a simple to understand source code with zero or minimal dependencies. Furthermore, they would be completely configurable from the outside, designed to be rather copied and possibly modified - not used as a black box dependency.</p>

                  Closing thoughts
                </h2><p>As we saw, Web Components are extremely easy to create and use with HTMX. <strong>They solve an important problem when working with HTMX: how and where should we define reusable components that also might need to use JavaScript to enhance their behavior, not only HTML?</strong> Additionally, if created with described here, generic approach to configuration through attributes, they can be extremely flexible and reusable:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;input-with-error 
  container:class="mb-2"
  input:add:class="w-full"
  input:type="password"
  input:name="secret"
  input:id="secret-input"
  input:placeholder="Order secret, compatibility with id is required"     
  input:hx-post="/orders/validate-secret"
  input:hx-trigger="input changed delay:500ms"
  input:hx-swap="outerHTML"
  input:hx-target="next input-error"
  input-error:id="secret-error"&gt;
&lt;/input-with-error&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Even though they do not know anything about HTMX, it turns out that it is a breeze to connect these two technologies!</p>

        <p>PANAMA CITY (AP) — A severe drought that began last year has forced authorities to slash ship crossings by 36% in the Panama Canal, one of the world's most important trade routes.</p>
              <p>The new cuts announced Wednesday by authorities in Panama are set to deal an even greater economic blow than previously expected. </p>
              <p>Canal administrators now estimate that dipping water levels could cost them between $500 million and $700 million in 2024, compared to previous estimates of $200 million. </p>
              <p>One of the most severe droughts to ever hit the Central American nation has stirred chaos in the 50-mile maritime route, causing a traffic jam of boats, casting doubts on the canal's reliability for international shipping and raising concerns about its affect on global trade.</p>
              <p>On Wednesday, Panama Canal Administrator Ricaurte Vásquez said they would cut daily ship crossings to 24, after already gradually slashing crossings last year from 38 a day in normal times.</p>
              <p>"It's vital that the country sends a message that we're going to take this on and find a solution to this water problem," Vásquez said.</p>
              <p>Vásquez added that in the first quarter of the fiscal year the passageway saw 20% less cargo and 791 fewer ships than the same period the year before.</p>
              <p>It was a “significant reduction” for the country, Vásquez said. But the official said that more “efficient” water management and a jump in rainfall in November has at least enabled them to ensure that water levels are high enough for 24 ships to pass daily until the end of April, the start of the next rainy season.</p>
              <p>Canal authorities attributed the drought to the El Niño weather phenomenon and climate change, and warned it was urgent for Panama to seek new water sources for both the canal's operations and human consumption. The same lakes that fill the canal also provide water for more than 50% of the country of more than 4 million people.</p>
              <p>“The water problem is a national problem, not just of the Canal,” Vásquez said. “We have to address this issue across the entire country.”</p>

<p>Private equity firms are increasingly buying hospitals across the US, and when they do, patients suffer, according to two separate reports. Specifically, the equity firms cut corners, slash services, lay off staff, lower quality of care, take on substantial debt, and reduce charity care, leading to lower ratings and more medical errors, the reports collectively find.</p>
<p>Last week, the financial watchdog organization Private Equity Stakeholder Project (PESP) released <a href="https://pestakeholder.org/news/new-report-details-harm-caused-to-healthcare-industry-by-apollo/">a repor</a>t delving into the state of two of the nation's largest hospital systems, Lifepoint and ScionHealth—both owned by private equity firm Apollo Global Management. Through those two systems, Apollo runs 220 hospitals in 36 states, employing around 75,000 people.</p>
<p>The report found that some of Apollo's hospitals were among the worst in their respective states, based on a ranking by The Lown Institute Hospital Index. The index ranks hospitals and health systems based on health equity, value, and outcomes, PESP notes. The hospitals also have dismal readmission rates and government rankings. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) ranks hospitals on a one-to-five star system, with the national average of 3.2 stars overall and about 30 percent of hospitals at two stars or below. Apollo's overall average is 2.8 stars, with nearly 40 percent of hospitals at two stars or below.</p>
<h2>Patterns</h2>
<p><a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2813379">The other report</a>, a study published in JAMA late last month, found that the rate of serious medical errors and health complications increases among patients in the first few years after private equity firms take over. The study examined Medicare claims from 51 private equity-run hospitals and 259 matched control hospitals.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>Specifically, the study, led by researchers at Harvard University, found that patients admitted to private equity-owned hospitals had a 25 percent increase in developing hospital-acquired conditions compared with patients in the control hospitals. In private equity hospitals, patients experienced a 27 percent increase in falls, a 38 percent increase in central-line bloodstream infections (despite placing 16 percent fewer central lines than control hospitals), and surgical site infections doubled.</p>
<p>"These findings heighten concerns about the implications of private equity on health care delivery," the authors concluded.</p>
<p>It also squares with PESP's investigation, which collected various data and media reports that could help explain how those medical errors could happen. The report found a pattern of cost-cutting and staff layoffs after private equity acquisition. In 2020, for instance, Lifepoint cut its annual salary and benefit costs by $166 million over the previous year and cut its supply costs by $54 million. Staff that remained at Apollo's hospitals were, in some cases, underpaid, and some hospitals cut services, including obstetric, pediatric, and psychiatric care.</p>
<p>Another pattern was that Apollo's hospitals were highly indebted. According to Moody's Investor Services, Apollo's ScionHealth has 5.8 times more debt than income to pay that debt off. Lifepoint's debt was 7.9 times its income. Private equity firms often take on excessive debt for leveraged buyouts, but this can lead cash to be diverted to interest payments instead of operational needs, PESP reported.</p>
<p>Apollo also made money off the hospitals in sale-leaseback transactions, in which it sold the land under the hospitals and then leased it back. In these cases, hospitals are left paying rent on land they used to own.</p>

Ward’s reaction to the scandal was all too familiar: first, attempting to <a href="https://twitter.com/henrysward/status/1743713154721554849" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">downplay</a> the <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/01/07/carta-henry-ward-investigating-allegations-confidential-information/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">concerns</a>; then, publicly <a href="https://twitter.com/henrysward/status/1743794996732735679" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">attacking</a> the person reporting them; then, rushing out a “thought leadership” <a href="https://henrysward.medium.com/how-we-handle-captable-information-c98d85d79277" rel="noopener">puff piece</a> that raised <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/01/09/carta-unanswered-questions" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">more questions</a> than it answered; before finally pulling a 180 and <a href="https://henrysward.medium.com/should-carta-facilitate-secondary-trading-c319e0c9f080" rel="noopener">announcing</a> that the company would exit the liquidity business entirely<a href="#51d0" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">²</a>…without ever explaining what had <em>actually</em> gone wrong, or how Carta would change its operating procedures moving forward.</p><p id="5f46">For customers, it was a confusing whirlwind of a week that broke trust and left many <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/carta-a-key-silicon-valley-player-for-startups-stumbles-prompting-customers-to-consider-competitors-89800bb8" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">considering</a> alternative vendors. For shareholders, including thousands of current and former Carta employees, it was like watching a forest fire, as much of the value of their stock — <a href="https://tribecap.co/1-trillion-in-equity-how-carta-is-set-to-unlock-the-private-markets/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">predicated</a> on Carta’s plans to <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/crisis-at-carta-how-henry-wards-dream-of-a-nasdaq-for-private-startups-died?rc=hx9mul" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">become</a> “a Nasdaq for private startups” — went up in smoke.</p><p id="d0ba">For me, it was déjà vu all over again.</p><p id="fa25">Fourteen months ago I was Carta’s CTO, well-regarded, praised by Ward for “bleeding Carta blue” (then the color of our logo), and working nights and weekends to <a rel="noopener" href="https://medium.com/building-carta/engineering-levels-at-carta-d33db2a55a20">take care</a> of “the people, the products, and the profits…in that order.” But the more time I spent in Carta’s C-suite, the more concerned I became about the company’s leadership. After witnessing behavior that veered from bad-for-business to ethically questionable to potentially illegal, I met privately with several other executives and board members. When these meetings only increased my unease, I sent a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/17UwfZfvcyfXKNR43FNbYefwI7vVg-rqn/view" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">signed letter</a> to the entire Carta board and the company’s general counsel, so that they, from their higher vantage, could assess the merits of my concerns and decide what to do.

A major law firm <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/gender-discrimination-lawsuit-carta-vcs-2023-1" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">investigated</a>, and I was questioned for eight hours by a team that included former United States Attorney General <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loretta_Lynch" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Loretta Lynch</a>.<a href="#6a9d" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">³</a> Days after my interview — on the Friday before Christmas — I was fired “for cause.” A week later, Carta sued me.</p><p id="22a6">And their lawsuit was a real whopper.</p></div><div><figure><figcaption>Carta’s October 2021 engineering leadership offsite in Chicago</figcaption></figure><p id="da6e">I joined Carta in September of 2018.

The technical challenges Carta was facing when I interviewed were a far cry from the problems I’d worked on during my PhD at <a href="https://www.cs.stanford.edu/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Stanford</a>, but what drew me to the company was the disproportionate impact such simple technology could have on so many people. Making employees <a href="https://mr-p.medium.com/think-like-an-owner-70ebf70644f7" rel="noopener">owners</a> — giving them an economic stake in the value they create — isn’t a panacea for capitalism’s uninternalized externalities, but it’s a damn good start. And Carta’s platform had such potential to do <em>good</em>: arming workers with the tools to navigate thorny and unfamiliar tax laws, guiding companies to ensure equal and equitable pay, helping families <a rel="noopener" href="https://medium.com/@jerrytalton/on-startup-offers-d59bf4baee9b">create</a> and <a href="https://x.com/jerrytalton/status/1508939642506477571?s=61&amp;t=2nQmwUH_WPoOR7pJKVkCnw" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">preserve</a> generational wealth.

Because I tried to blow the whistle? <strong>Yuck</strong>.</p></div><div><p id="a11d">At various times in my life, I have been an expert in different things: the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlTJrNJ5lA" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">discography</a> of Tom Petty &amp; the Heartbreakers, organizational management principles, reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo. But nobody becomes an expert whistleblower. This turns out to be a major point of contention: “we want people to speak up!” says the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a-4bywFOPLcOnHuRfYJpQ5Ga5KpVh3UA/view?usp=drive_link" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">company handbook</a>, drafted by expensive lawyers. But as soon as someone does, those same lawyers swoop in: “but not like <em>that</em>!”</p><p id="6620">So I have to ask: what form of objection would have been acceptable? Who should it have come from? How should it have been delivered? In May of 2019, Henry messaged the company asking employees to come directly to him with problems, instead of using the newly launched whistleblower platform. At a leadership offsite in August 2022, he described his philosophy of management: “Friction is failure,” Henry proclaimed. “If you’re arguing, you’re not doing your job.” In another lawsuit filed against Carta by a former executive, Henry <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/carta-lawsuits-employees-ceo-retaliation-2023-2" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">said</a> “I didn’t fire him because of his performance. I fired him because he was complaining to people he shouldn’t be complaining to.” Just a week ago, in the latest Carta scandal, Henry <a href="https://twitter.com/henrysward/status/1743794996732735679" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">accused</a> a prominent startup CEO of “firebombing” him “for exposure” after the founder posted evidence that Carta had misused customer data. As far as I can tell, the company’s position is that <em>nobody</em> ever speaks up in the right way, or has a legitimate concern. Wrongdoing isn’t the gravest sin: <a href="https://twitter.com/pmarca/status/1502432636865691648" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">talking</a> about it is.</p><p id="5022">When I finally decided that — as a fiduciary — I had no choice but to write to Carta’s board, I hoped that my record of accomplishment and my commitment to the company would ensure I was taken seriously. I had joined as a Director with a single direct report, been promoted three times in two years to Chief Technology Officer, and then led engineering through a period of <a href="https://www.axios.com/2021/08/13/carta-valuation-fundraising" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">unprecedented growth</a> to a team more than 400 strong. True to the company’s mission, I was an <a href="https://carta.com/about/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">owner</a>: I had invested nearly my entire life’s savings exercising the company’s stock options, and Carta’s success was now my success. I had <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/danfike" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">hired</a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/juliaking3" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">so</a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kineticrick" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">many</a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nguyenbaochau" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">amazing</a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cupto" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">senior</a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ternasky" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">leaders</a> who were smarter and more experienced than I, and we consistently garnered glowing performance reviews and stellar Employee Voice Survey results. I was being paid a $623,000 a year base salary and had a $3.9M annual equity target. What <em>conceivable</em> motivation could I have to put all of that at risk, unless something was seriously wrong? And if I, a 40-year-old 6’2” cis white guy in the C-suite with a Stanford PhD, couldn’t speak up, who could? Plus, I was writing a private letter to the board, not calling reporters or threatening a lawsuit. What was the company going to do, pretend it was a mistake to have hired me in the first place? Say I was bad at my job? Nobody could stomach <em>that</em> much hypocrisy, right?<a href="#42bc" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">⁶</a></p><p id="0932">Turns out some can. And when powerful people attack your reputation, the mud sticks, no matter how mendacious. Those who know me well or have worked closely with me over the years laughed when they heard the names Henry was calling me. But for the many thousands whose first exposure to me has been Carta’s lawsuit or Henry’s blog post, his calumnies have scored. And it’s tough, too, to blame folks for not tripping over themselves running to my defense, as the company continues its “nuke them from orbit” <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/carta-lawsuit-former-employee-recordings-of-its-ceo-2023-9" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">legal strategy</a> against anyone who dares raise their head.</p><p id="8c86">It’s hard not to cheer when powerful hypocrites are finally called to account: the evangelical preacher caught embezzling funds; the crypto billionaire’s Ponzi scheme revealed. But don’t forget that shame is also one of the most pernicious weapons of the shameless. <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/7007297-Emily-Kramer-v-Carta#document/p16" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Telling</a> a female executive that “she was like an alcoholic who needed to admit her problem and have a full-scale recovery from being an asshole” isn’t the worst thing ever done in corporate America, but the effect is still undeniable: to <a href="https://emilykramer.medium.com/equity-for-all-1ae9ac42679e" rel="noopener">break</a> something, just a little, inside. During a long “coaching” session with Henry, another seasoned executive wrote in her notes: “own it; [the problem is] me; what could I have done better?” Months later, I listened to her read back what she had written and start to cry. Nobody as lucky or as privileged as I has any business looking for sympathy, but attempting to shame someone publicly for their (safe, legal, <em>consensual</em>) private life is some dark shit.</p><p id="20db"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_of_Tyler_Clementi" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">People</a> <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goo_Hara" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">kill</a> <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubba_Copeland" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">themselves</a>, after all.</p></div><div><p id="6cfa">Herodotus, in his<em> Histories</em>, tells how Solon advised Croesus to “count no man happy until the end is known,” so it’s still too early for me to say for sure what I’ll take away from this experience. But there is one thing I’m certain of: the only way any of this is going to stop is if we all <em>collectively</em> decide that we are mad as hell and not going to take it anymore. I have always liked Madeline Albright’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRimyfmz0MA&amp;t=13s" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">quote</a> about the special place in hell reserved for women who don’t help other women, but I think the proper focus should be on <em>power</em>, not gender. What is the point of accruing influence and money and prestige if you won’t use them to help people? Stop saying “this isn’t my job; there’s nothing I can do; I don’t want to know; it didn’t happen to <em>me</em>; it’s none of <strong>my</strong> business.” Mankind is your business. The common welfare is your business. The dealings of your trade are but a drop of water in the comprehensive ocean of your business.</p><p id="d472">Late in the summer of 2022, I asked a prominent Silicon Valley founder and investor — who had been close to the company and knew something of its rampant dysfunction — for advice. “If you pop up one-by-one,” they said, “Henry can knock you down. You have to stand together.” Yet what is any ocean but a multitude of drops? It has to start with you, with one person deciding that enough is enough. When you see something, <em>say something</em>. Spend some — not all, but some — of the social and professional capital that you have been working so hard for so long to collect, and stand up for someone who can’t do it on their own. Because let me tell you: <em>nobody</em> can do it alone. When you shrug and move on because you don’t want to make waves, some of the people you leave behind are drowning.</p><p id="c015">Before I sent my letter to the full board at Carta, I met with <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/carta-startup-discrimination-harassment-boys-club-allegations-henry-ward-lawsuit-2023-10" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Barbara Byrne</a>, the company’s only independent director, and the board’s only woman. We spoke for almost two hours, and the last thing Barbara did was tell me a story about a dispute she’d had at work years before, where her employer sent expensive lawyers to intimidate her. “The only power they have,” she said, “is the power to make you afraid. Don’t let them make you afraid.”</p><p id="a26a">I am tired, disgusted, outraged, disappointed, and incredulous…but I refuse to be afraid. Seeing my good name smeared across the internet is painful and awful — after all, it is my <strong>name</strong>: I cannot have another in my life. But I have accepted that, if the last five years is going to mean anything, it will have to cost something.</p><p id="5229">Don’t let them make you afraid.</p></div><div><p id="5d5f">¹ We are challenging most of these redactions in court.</p><p id="51d0">² This abrupt reversal came forty-eight hours after one Carta board member <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/07/carta-the-cap-table-management-outfit-is-accused-of-unethical-tactics-by-a-customer-after-it-tries-broker-a-deal-for-a-startups-shares-without-consent/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">offered TechCrunch</a> an impassioned defense of the “legitimacy” Carta was bringing to a “messy market”; five days after <a href="https://linear.app/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Linear</a> CEO and Carta customer <a href="https://karrisaarinen.com/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Karri Saarinen</a> first rang the alarm on social media; and three years after Carta <a href="https://twitter.com/cartainc/status/1334184362120769537?lang=en" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> the launch of <a href="https://carta.com/blog/liquid-rsus/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Carta Liquidity</a>, “a new equity paradigm for private companies.”</p><p id="6a9d">³ The company has refused to release the report of their investigation.</p><p id="abf8">⁴ After this response was published, the article was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231030124219/https:/www.businessinsider.com/carta-startup-discrimination-harassment-boys-club-allegations-henry-ward-lawsuit-2023-10" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">updated</a> to “clarify” the board member’s comment, which is reassuring since “asking management questions” sounds a bit like the board’s basic function.</p><p id="0159">⁵ These claims were so brazen and outrageous that Carta’s counsel was <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1W0ROWCkAZ_WU7-RoFgDb5mi9fjqbtRV2/view?usp=drive_link" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">forced</a> to <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Cw4VWUX7tNZU2DZiUd8L6DI1lria71Gk/view?usp=sharing" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">ask the court</a> for leave to withdraw them, and subsequently amended their complaint to do so. But this didn’t stop Henry from circulating the original, unaltered filing in the blog post that he sent to 40,000 Carta corporate customers four months later.</p><p id="42bc">⁶ I also failed to include “accuse me of being ‘hopped up on drugs’ and ‘high’ at work” on my Carta Bingo card, after I notified the exec team and my direct reports that it would take several weeks to recover from the painful surgeries I had on both feet in September 2022. But I think we are meant to believe that implying my planned convalescence was a drug addiction — as Carta did in their public lawsuit — is appropriate corporate behavior, since “<a href="https://fortune.com/2023/10/16/women-claims-mistreatment-carta-unicorn-startup/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Henry does play hardball</a>.”</p></div></div></article></div>]]></description>

I've never used it myself, but it's a self contained IDE that has everything to make decent 2D games.</p><p>I'd advise against the pitfall that 3D games lure you into. That includes engines that are 3D with a 2D "mode". There is so much leaky abstraction, and the doco will be intermingled with 3D all over the place, leading to frustration and unnecessary complexity.</p><p>If a game is fun in 3D, chances are you could write a game in the same vein in 2D and carry the idea and execution across. 3D games are beyond ridiculously hard to execute on by oneself (well), and require exponentially more work to complete.</p><p>There is no gain, in terms of discovering the joy of making games, in diving in 3D first.</p><p>If you prefer a more programming centric approach, with no IDE, I recommend Love2D. It's a joy to use, well documented.</p><p>If you want a full blown low level approach, I recommend Raylib. It's fantastic and fun to use as well. But at this point, you're swimming in the deep end.</p><p>Also worthy of note is PICO-8. It's a fantasy console that can be easily ported on 'open' console (such as the ambernic), making your game feel alive, being played on a hand-held console. But as for the learning experience, I found it to be more of an expert's getaway retreat, rather than a good first choice for an engine. That said there is enough material out there and small enough API, to pick it up  rather quickly, all batteries included.

                  <p><span>What a great response. To follow, this doesn't preclude anyone's child from jumping head first into programming, just that "producing" a game isn't really the goal but "making" it is. My 9 year old son makes mini RPGs on paper. Like he draws hit points and a monster and does attacks and marks damage as he plays. It's awesome. Sometimes "making a game" doesn't need to be programming at all.</span></p></div></td></tr>

My parents sat me down and taught me the very basics of how to code. I didn't learn very well from them, but they also bought me a textbook and I learned great from that. By age 12, I had recreated a lot of the games I was fond of, pacman, snake, space invaders, etc.<p>Maybe the bar was lower for my interests at the time (flash mini games vs AAA 3D games as described here), but just offering a different take: Maybe your son _would_ very much be interested in learning to code. Though starting with 2d retro games might be easier.

Could you just "build" it with cardboard, a board drawn on a computer and printed out and various physical pieces? Or at least, do that for a prototype of the core part of the game and gameplay? I think it would be useful to learn the concept of a "minimum viable product" in this context (or rather, "minimum quantum of utility" to get away from preconceived ideas about what a "product" is..). Being able to get it to a point where people can first actually try to play it is really useful, and lets you get feedback early without all the overhead of the actual computer programming (if needed)</span></p></div></td></tr>

Love2D is great if you're okay with Lua.  Browser based engines have a great iteration loop.

Love2d is a simple library/framework, and Lua is much simpler than python, and you will (are forced to) learn the basics, for example there's no built-in object-orientation, you make it yourself, so you learn how such systems actually work.

This is a serious tool for any kind of creative project.<p>The way to use Venn diagrams is to distill "the game" (which, for any pre-teen, and for most first-time adults too, is going to be a jumble of features and assets) into its absolute core: the big picture, philosophy, principles, themes, "design pillars". The core is the overlap of all the specific stuff: when you implement something, it has code, it has visuals, it has audio, and it should all relate to the core. So, Tetris, Sokoban, and Minecraft are all about "playing with blocks" at some level, but they differ in that the core also contains some other aspect of play. Every piece of media that works for its audience - they find it believable and engaging - is representable in the diagram.</p><p>So when your son asks for this or that feature, have him work through it on a diagram, filling in "what sound does it make" and similar kinds of details while you address the big picture parts that are hardest. Make lots of little diagrams. You'll eventually hit on one where you can reasonably hope to prototype it with your chosen tool. That's good enough, when you are 9 years old.

The only game I ever really made was a top down shooter with SML because I 1) learned that games are hard work 2) had no idea where to get assets besides ripping sprite sheets which I didn’t have the attention span for 3) I found more joy in the coding itself than making a game. I always had some dinky project going and it was almost never a game. Hell, I had more fun making a GameBoy emulator than making games!</p><p>These days, now that I know what I’m doing, I have an idea for a game I’d like to make. I wonder if I’ll ever get around to it? It’s ambitious, but I think doable solo (minus the art). It’d probably be a 5-10 year project. A big part of the reason I haven’t started it is I know how much not fun parts there are involved, like tuning algorithms.

You can help him of course and try to steer him towards incremental improvement.<p>With Roblox he will definitely be able to just use pre-made (of not super awesome looking) cars and zombies. In fact the Roblox tutorials come with a pretty good looking Zombie actually. With animations and all. They also have some official item collections which included high and low poly stuff.</p><p>You can help him put together a simple version in a couple days tops probably. Like something that's literally just car that won't drive, some zombies that walk towards the player location if in range, he has to long press to "repair" the car and escape. First version done.</p><p>Then expand from there, like have an actual "broken car" model vs "working car". Start adding houses and streets and an "escape zone" you gotta reach etc.</p><p>That said, don't underestimate his curiosity. I thought my kids wouldn't get past that either and now I sometimes glimpse or they show me what they've been working on. I just showed them some 3D software like Blender, they got a tablet and a cheap graphics tablet for the PC. And I do see them doodling around with it, trying things. Just like we did. But with cooler tech. Just today actually I told one of them when they were on the tablet how I watched Star Trek as a kid and always wanted to "live long enough that I'd have something like the P.A.D.D.". And look here we've had iPads for "forever" now and the kids think it's normal to have.

(yes I've done some developing coz the kids wanted me to build a game for them. "daddy, daddy, I found this pink cow! You gotta put it in!" - I never finished coz it got boring but it was a lot of fun).<p>He can blow up (just super size) the models and maybe find some "motor" asset someone made and published to actually put under the hood or just next to the car, which he needs to repair too. A blown out tire? Go find rubber or a new tire? Lug it back to the car first. A jerry can asset someone made that he needs to find at a gas station (maybe someone already made that asset) to fill up the car. Like "if Jerry can is in inventory - inventory is already pre built in roblox just use it - then long pressing the action key will fill up the car". Find a "lead pipe" asset to use as a weapon. To begin with use one of the premade with animations and everything swords. The learn how to make your own.</p><p>Since it's all for learning nobody has to care about asset licensing or money. When he does, it's a teachable moment.

I also found several other examples on the Scratch website which show how to build 3D graphics on a 2D canvas. After many years of teaching kids to code, I would say the best introduction for a 9 year old is to start with block-based environments to build structural thinking fundamentals, before introducing him to typed programming languages.<p>The issue I see in starting in Unity or an equivalent high-level abstraction (e.g. threejs.org), is that it doesn't build strong fundamentals in how you <i>think</i> about solving problems. Many kids these days think they are "coding" when they are really just modifying a collection of examples and starting points (which has fueled the burgeoning industry of summer camps teaching "Minecraft modding"). As is the case for many other skills, great amateurs make great professionals.

A game engine enables way more possibilities than modding. You can add multiplayer over websocket/webrtc, you can write your own shader, you can write your game logic however you want etc. All of that without the overhead/limitation of a modding environment.</p><p>Also, out in the wild the job opportunity for Garry's Mod developers is very scarce, if any. Just something to think about if op wants to do some carrier development for the kid while having fun.

                        <div id="intro">
                <p><em>This article was <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://themarkup.org/privacy/2024/01/17/each-facebook-user-is-monitored-by-thousands-of-companies-study-indicates" target="_blank">copublished</a> with The Markup, a nonprofit, investigative newsroom that challenges technology to serve the public good.

<p>By now most internet users know their online activity is constantly tracked. No one should be shocked to see ads for items they previously searched for, or to be asked if their data can be shared with an unknown number of “partners.”</p>
<p>But what is the scale of this surveillance? Judging from data collected by Facebook and newly described in a <a href="http://innovation.consumerreports.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/CR_Who-Shares-Your-Information-With-Facebook.pdf">unique study by Consumer Reports</a> (PDF), it’s massive, and examining the data may leave you with more questions than answers.</p>
            </div>

<div id="more-on-online-privacy-related-articles">
        <p>Using a panel of 709 volunteers who shared archives of their Facebook data, Consumer Reports found that a total of 186,892 companies sent data about them to the social network. On average, each participant in the study had their data sent to Facebook by 2,230 companies. That number varied significantly, with some panelists’ data listing over 7,000 companies providing their data.&nbsp; The Markup helped Consumer Reports recruit participants for the study. Participants downloaded an archive of the previous three years of their data from their Facebook settings, then provided it to Consumer Reports. </p>
<p>By collecting data this way, the study was able to examine a form of tracking that is normally hidden: so-called server-to-server tracking, in which personal data goes from a company’s servers to Meta’s servers. Another form of tracking, in which Meta tracking pixels are placed on company websites, is visible to users’ browsers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because the data came from a self-selected group of users, and because the results were not demographically adjusted, the study does not “make any claims about how representative this sample is of the U.S. population as a whole,” Consumer Reports says. Participants were also likely more privacy-conscious and technically inclined than typical users and more likely to be members of Consumers Reports.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
                 <p>Despite its limitations, the study offers a rare look, using data directly from Meta, on how personal information is collected and aggregated online.</p>
<p>Meta spokesperson Emil Vazquez defended the company’s practices. “We offer a number of transparency tools to help people understand the information that businesses choose to share with us, and manage how it’s used,” Vazquez wrote in an emailed statement to The Markup.</p>
<p>While Meta does provide transparency tools like the one that enabled the study, Consumer Reports identified problems with them, including that the identity of many data providers is unclear from the names disclosed to users and that companies that provide services to advertisers are often allowed to ignore opt-out requests.</p>
<p>One company appeared in 96 percent of participants’ data: LiveRamp, a data broker based in San Francisco. But the companies sharing your online activity to Facebook aren’t just little-known data brokers. Retailers like Home Depot, Macy’s, and Walmart, all were in the top 100 most frequently seen companies in the study. Credit reporting and consumer data companies such as Experian and TransUnion’s Neustar also made the list, as did Amazon, Etsy, and PayPal.</p>
<p>LiveRamp did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
            </div>

    
    <div id="what-exactly-does-this-data-contain">
                <p>The data examined by Consumer Reports in this study comes from two types of collection: events and custom audiences. Both categories include information about what people do outside of Meta’s platforms.</p>
<p>Custom audiences allow advertisers to upload customer lists to Meta, often including identifiers like email addresses and mobile advertising IDs. These customers, and so-called look-alike audiences made up of similar people, can then be targeted with ads on Meta’s platforms.</p>
<p>The other category of data collection, “events,” describes interactions that the user had with a brand, which can occur outside of Meta’s apps and in the real world. Events can include going to a page on a company’s website, leveling up in a game, going to a physical store, or purchasing a product. These signals originate from Meta software code included in many mobile apps, their tracking pixel, which is included on many websites, and from server-to-server tracking, where a company’s server passes data to a Meta server.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Markup has written extensively about the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://themarkup.org/series/pixel-hunt" target="_blank">Meta Pixel</a> and how it has been used to surveil people as they <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://themarkup.org/pixel-hunt/2023/06/13/suicide-hotlines-promise-anonymity-dozens-of-their-websites-send-sensitive-data-to-facebook" target="_blank">dial suicide hotlines</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://themarkup.org/privacy/2023/02/16/forget-milk-and-eggs-supermarkets-are-having-a-fire-sale-on-data-about-you" target="_blank">buy their groceries</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://themarkup.org/pixel-hunt/2023/11/22/facebook-watches-teens-online-as-they-prep-for-college" target="_blank">take the SAT</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://themarkup.org/pixel-hunt/2022/11/22/tax-filing-websites-have-been-sending-users-financial-information-to-facebook" target="_blank">file their taxes</a>, and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://themarkup.org/pixel-hunt/2022/06/16/facebook-is-receiving-sensitive-medical-information-from-hospital-websites" target="_blank">book appointments with their doctors</a>. Website owners can configure the pixel to track user website interactions such as searches or filling out a form, sending each action to Meta, even if the user doesn’t have an account on Facebook. Although research tools like The Markup’s Pixel Hunt can detect the Meta pixel or SDK tracking, there is no way for a consumer to monitor the traffic between a company’s server and Meta’s. This Consumer Reports study looks at server-to-server data along with the rest.</p>

            </div>
    <div id="how-can-you-see-your-data">
                <p>Facebook users can browse through the list of companies that have sent their data to Facebook by going to the Accounts Center and clicking on “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://accountscenter.facebook.com/info_and_permissions" target="_blank">Your information and permissions</a>.” </p>
<p>From this menu, users can either download or access their information. To see the companies outside of Meta that have been sharing your information, select “Your activity off Meta technologies,” then “Recent activity.” You might be prompted to reenter your password at this point. This view will show you the number of recent connections between various third-party businesses you visited and Meta, and examples of the activity that was shared. You can choose to prevent future sharing by the company by selecting “Disconnect.” To see detailed information about these interactions, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://facebook.com/dyi" target="_blank">request a copy of your data</a>.</p>
<p>But after jumping through the many hoops required to get your hands on this data, you may still be left with lingering questions. For example, in addition to easily recognizable company names more than 7,000 companies in Consumer Reports’ study were named using unreadable gibberish, or just numbers that don’t mean anything to most users. Even those companies with readable names often did not include links to the company website. Some company names were ambiguous, such as Viking, which could be a number of different businesses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“This type of tracking which occurs entirely outside of the user’s view is just so far outside of what people expect when they use the internet,” Caitriona Fitzgerald, deputy director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, told The Markup in an interview. Fitzgerald said that while users are likely aware that Meta knows what they are doing while they are on Facebook and Instagram, “they don’t expect Meta to know what stores they walk into or what news articles they’re reading or every site they visit online.”&nbsp;</p>
            </div>
    
    <div>
                 <p>In the report, Consumer Reports calls for a number of policy proposals covering data collection practices, some of which could be part of a national digital privacy law, something that the organization has long advocated for. The recommendations specifically aimed at Meta’s technology and the advertisers who use it include:&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>• Requiring companies to adopt “data minimization” strategies</strong>, which call for the collection of the absolute minimum amount of data needed to provide the service being offered.</p>
<p><strong><strong>•</strong> Expanding the powers of “authorized agents” to act on behalf of consumers to act on their rights. </strong><a href="https://www.permissionslipcr.com/">Permission Slip</a> is a mobile app by Consumer Reports that allows users to quickly opt out of and delete data from a long list of companies and data brokers on behalf of users; the app takes advantage of state privacy laws’ authorized agent provisions.</p>
<p><strong><strong>•</strong> Increasing ad transparency </strong>by creating ad archives that allow the public to see all ads that have been served to users on a platform, following the lead of the European Union’s <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://husovec.eu/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Official-Version-OJ_L_2022_277_FULL_EN_TXT.pdf" target="_blank">Digital Services Act</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>• Improving the quality and readability of the data </strong>that Meta makes available in its existing transparency tools, so that consumers can actually act on the information they review.</p>
<p>Fitzgerald echoed these recommendations, saying the problem lies with the fact that the burden is on the consumer to take action to prevent this data collection. Even a “global opt-out” mechanism allowing users to avoid having their data shared is not enough because “that still requires the user to take an action to protect their privacy. A lot of people are not going to have the time or knowledge to do that,” Fitzgerald said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vazquez, Meta’s spokesperson, said the company would “continue to invest in data minimization technologies to keep up with evolving expectations. As we cover in our terms, businesses are responsible for getting permission to share people’s information with companies like ours.”</p>
<p>For now, the lack of a federal privacy law leaves consumers in most states with few options. “I think people should be encouraging their elected officials to pass privacy laws that require businesses to change some of these business practices to stop this ubiquitous tracking of our every click and every movement,” Fitzgerald said.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="Box">



<p><a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1747280541362102287/">Tim Sweeney, on Twitter/X, yesterday at 10:30am</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As of today, developers can begin exercising their 
court-established right to tell US customers about better prices 
on the web. These awful Apple-mandated confusion screens are over 
and done forever. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That take didn’t last long.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1747408148799881390">Sweeney, yesterday at 7:00pm</a>, after Apple released <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/01/16/apple-guidelines-external-purchase-links">the details of its intended compliance</a> with the anti-steering (<em>anti-anti-steering</em>?) mandate from the Epic v. Apple case:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A quick summary of glaring problems we’ve found so far: </p>

<ol>
<li>Apple has introduced an anticompetitive new 27% tax on web 
purchases. Apple has never done this before, and it kills price 
competition. Developers can’t offer digital items more cheaply 
on the web after paying a third-party payment processor 3-6% 
and paying this new 27% Apple Tax.</li>
</ol>

<p>[Sweeney’s points 2–4, complaining about Apple’s stringent design, 
presentation, and privacy demands regarding external links, 
omitted.] </p>

<p>Epic will contest Apple’s bad-faith compliance plan in 
District Court. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sweeney’s description makes it sound as though Apple is demanding its commission from all web sales for apps and services that have an iOS app. They’re not. They’re only demanding the commission from web sales that occur within 7 days of a user tapping through to the web from <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/storekit-external-entitlement-us/">the new External Purchase Links entitlement</a> in an app. Any app or service that already sells over the web, without paying a cent to Apple, can continue to do so in exactly the same way.</p>

<p>Also, Apple <em>has</em> done this before: what they announced yesterday is almost exactly in line <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2022/02/going_dutch">with their compliance with Netherlands regulations pertaining to dating apps in 2022</a>.</p>

<p>Before yesterday:</p>

<ul>
<li>iOS app developers could sell digital content and subscriptions over the web, without paying Apple any commission.</li>
<li>iOS apps outside <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/09/01/apple-anti-steering-relaxation">the “reader” category</a> could not link to, nor even tell users about, those web purchases from within their apps.</li>
</ul>

<p>After yesterday:</p>

<ul>
<li>Apps that wish to link to — or, I think, even inform users about — web purchasing options from within their iOS apps must (a) still offer Apple’s IAP for those items; (b) pay Apple its adjusted 27/12 percent commissions on web sales that come from inside iOS apps; (c) send Apple sales data monthly and submit to audits of their sales; and (d) follow Apple’s stringent design edicts for these in-app links to the web.</li>
<li>Apps that do not link out to their web stores from within their iOS apps using Apple’s new External Purchase Links entitlement can continue whatever they were doing before yesterday. For apps that do nothing new, Apple is collecting nothing new.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m only surprised that Sweeney was seemingly surprised by any of this. He genuinely seemed to think that Apple not only would, but <em>had to</em> allow links from within apps to the web for purchases without collecting any commission on those sales, and that developers could present those links however they chose.</p>

<p>I’m glad that Sweeney and Epic plan to contest this, because I’m genuinely curious whether Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers sees Apple’s solution as complying with her injunction against their prior anti-steering rules. But I think it <em>does</em> comply.</p>

<hr>

<p>To be clear, I think Apple should allow apps <em>other than games</em> to just tell users they can pay/buy/subscribe/whatever on the web, without any commission. That the rules which have applied only to “reader” apps since early 2022 should be extended to all apps other than games, perhaps alongside a requirement (which doesn’t apply to “reader” apps) that apps taking advantage of this <em>also</em> offer in-app purchasing.</p>

<p>I’d draw an exception for games — an exception that surely Sweeney would disagree with completely, given that he’s in the games business — because games are different, and hefty un-circumventable revenue commissions to platform owners are clearly standard for the video game industry. The iPhone and iPad are not PCs; they’re consoles for games and apps.</p>

<p>But I’m not sure at all that Apple is doing anything contrary to the law. Sweeney (and other critics of Apple’s stewardship of iOS as a tightly controlled console) believe Apple both shouldn’t and <em>legally can’t</em> comply with the anti-steering injunction this way. I only believe Apple shouldn’t, not that they legally can’t.</p>

<p>Most critics of Apple’s control over all iOS software are seemingly of the view that iPhones and iPads should, on principle, be largely like the Mac, where the App Store is an option, not the only game in town for software distribution. Personally, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2021/06/annotating_apples_anti-sideloading_white_paper">I am on the record wishing that Apple would allow some sort of “expert” or “developer” mode</a> — chock full of warnings, perhaps even requiring a developer account to enable — that would basically offer the same options for installing third-party software on iOS as there are on the Mac. That’s me, personally, an expert user. But even setting aside every penny of revenue generated by the App Store,<sup id="fnr1-2024-01-17"><a href="#fn1-2024-01-17">1</a></sup> I see and understand many of the reasons why Apple wouldn’t want to do this. There are a lot of Mac users whose Macs are overrun by adware and other scammy software. I’m not talking about viruses or malware, even — but apps that just abuse the largely free-for-all nature of the Mac platform.</p>

<p>Basically, there’s an argument that iOS devices should be more like traditional PCs (including the Mac), on ethical or moral grounds. The “<em>it’s my device, I should decide and control what software runs on it</em>” argument. I get it. But I also get that most consumers’ Windows PCs, and many Macs,<sup id="fnr2-2024-01-17"><a href="#fn2-2024-01-17">2</a></sup> are riddled with bad software (privacy invasive, resource hogging, and all sorts of <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2021/12/22/grammarly-disables-spell-checking-globally/">anti-user shenanigans</a> you’d never think of) that App Store policies forbid. App Store review is far from perfect — I mean come on, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/search/app+store+rejection">that should go without saying</a> — but it is undeniable that adversarial software is not a problem for <em>any</em> typical users on iOS. Nothing you install from the App Store can damage your iPhone or iPad experience. Nothing you install from the App Store is difficult to uninstall if you don’t like it. The same is true of dedicated game consoles like Switch, PlayStation, and Xbox — and to a lesser degree (because Google’s Play Store review seems comparatively lax) for Android.</p>

<p>But the cynical take is that it’s all about the money for Apple. Maybe the cynics are right! Let’s just concede that they are, and that Apple will only make decisions here that benefit its bottom line. My argument remains that Apple <em>should not</em> be pursuing this plan for complying with the anti-steering injunction by collecting commissions from web sales that initiate in-app. Whatever revenue Apple would lose to non-commissioned web sales (for non-games) is not worth the hit they are taking to the company’s brand and reputation — this move reeks of greed and avarice — nor the increased ire and scrutiny of regulators and legislators on the “anti-Big-Tech” hunt.</p>

<p>Apple should have been looking for ways to <em>lessen</em> regulatory and legislative pressure over the past few years, and in today’s climate that’s more true than ever. But instead, their stance has seemingly been “<em>Bring it on.</em>” Confrontational, not conciliatory, conceding not an inch. Rather than take a sure win with <em>most</em> of what they could want, Apple is seemingly hell-bent on trying to keep <em>everything</em>. To win in chess all you need is to capture your opponent’s king. Apple seemingly wants to capture every last piece on the board — even while playing in a tournament where the referees (regulators) are known to look askance at blatant poor sportsmanship (greed).</p>

<p>Apple’s calculus should be to balance its natural desire to book large amounts of revenue from the App Store with policies that to some degree <em>placate</em>, rather than antagonize, regulators and legislators. No matter what the sport, no matter what the letter of the rulebook says, it’s never a good idea to piss off the refs.</p>

        <p>Hi, welcome to the brand new website, HN Reads.  I enjoy reading <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a> and I love buying books (and reading), and I also love data, so what better than doing some processing of data about books to find some interesting results?!  It also gives me the opportunity to write about books that I find interesting.</p>
<p>Here are the top 40 books recommended by HN readers in 2023.</p>
<p>How I generated this list:</p>
<ul>
<li>get stories that contain the word “book”, but not “macbook”, “chromebook”, etc. That were posted in 2023, and also try to only get “ask HN” stories, by excluding stories that have a url in them.</li>
<li>get the comments for the stories</li>
<li>for each comment, use the OpenAI gpt3.5 chat API to extract a list of book details in json format:</li>
</ul>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback"> 	 [
 	 	{"match":"xxx","title":"xxx", "author":"xxx", "link":"xxx"},
 	 	...
 	 ]
</code></pre></div><ul>
<li>standardise titles, e.g. “Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid” is converted
to “Gödel, Escher, Bach”. Any leading “the” is also removed.  I end up with a title
column and an orig_title column in my data. If there are that have the same title, but different subtitles, for example “Javascript: the good parts” and “Javascript: the Definitive Guide”, this isn’t too much of a problem, as the authors are different.</li>
<li>aggregate the resulting information.  There was some manual adjustment to standardise
the book titles and authors names, for example Gödel was sometimes spelled “Godel”
and Douglas Hofstadter was sometimes returned as “Douglas R. Hofstadter”.</li>
</ul>
<p>I also shared some details about this process at <a href="https://blog.reyem.dev/post/extracting_hn_book_recommendations_with_chatgpt_vol_ii/">my blog</a>.</p>
<p>It’s nice to see one of my favourite series appearing on this list, the Hyperion Cantos. I don’t usually go for books with horror elements, but the story is so good, and the science
fiction elements are cool too.</p>
<p>A couple of controversial figures don’t rank in the top 40 of 2023:  Elon Musk’s new biography
wasn’t recommended once in an “Ask HN” about books, although there were plenty of stories
on Hacker News about him and Isaacson’s book.  Also Ayn Rand’s books weren’t mentioned often
enough in 2023 to make the list.</p>
<p>Without further delay, here’s the list:</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p><em>Context: When I was laid off from Google, I knew I'd be deluged with
questions.  I wrote this FAQ to share with friends and family, to
prevent repeated explanation.  But my other goal was to help so many
of my co-workers process and understand the repeated waves of mass
layoffs.</em></p>
<p><strong>What happened?</strong></p>
<p>Google just did another big round of layoffs.  I was part of them,
along with hundreds of others.  Many of us had long tenure or
seniority; my run was 18 years!</p>
<p><strong>Oh no!  But why were <em>you</em> targeted?</strong></p>
<p>I wasn’t personally targeted, I didn’t mess up.  In fact these layoffs
were extremely impersonal.  Google seems to be carrying out generic
initiatives to save operational cost.  I was an Engineering Director
with “only” 35 reports (rather than a typical 80+ people), and so it’s
likely that some heuristic decided that the business could do fine
without me.</p>
<p><strong>This is unfair!  After all you’ve done, how could Google do this to
you?</strong></p>
<p>Please understand: <em>Google is not a person.</em> It’s many groups of
people following locally-varying processes, rules, and culture.  To
that end, it makes no sense to either love or be angry at “Google”;
it’s not a consciousness, and it has no sense of duty nor debt.</p>
<p><strong>Are you OK?  I’m so sorry!  How are you coping?</strong></p>
<p>I’m fine.  :-) Google culture changed dramatically last year with its
first major round of layoffs, and I saw the writing on the wall.  I’ve
been preparing myself for this (increasingly inevitable) event for
months now – which included plenty of time for all the stages of
grief.  If anything, I have a mixed set of emotions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>enormous pride in building a Chicago Engineering office over
decades, and achieving really cool things in the Developer, Ads, and
Search divisions;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>deep gratitude in getting to work with some of the most intelligent,
creative people in the world;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a sense of relief.  The conflict between “uncomfortable culture” and
“golden handcuffs” was becoming intolerable.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What happens next?</strong></p>
<p>I’ve seen long-tenured leaders exit Google and go into an identity
crisis; that’s not me.  :-)</p>
<p>I have a <a href="https://www.red-bean.com/sussman/">zillion hobbies and shadow
careers</a> – plenty of things to do
and paths to follow.  The <em>first</em> order of business, however, is
probably a long-overdue sabbatical.  After 25+ years in tech, I need a
few months to rest and recover!</p>
<p>I’ll soon publish a couple of ‘post-mortem’ stories.  The first will
be about my own career at Google, and the second will be about how
I’ve seen Google culture change over time.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
<h2>A suspect</h2>

<p>I think the manufacturer of your son's ball mixed in a Swedish word:</p>

<blockquote>
  <h2><em>Yxa</em></h2>
  
  <h3>Swedish, n.: <em>an axe</em></h3>
  
  <p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LNTu2.jpg" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LNTu2.jpg" alt="See caption"></a><br>
  <sub>The photograph above is <a href="https://www.bukowskis.com/sv/auctions/562/48-elsa-beskow-j-julgran-och-y-yxa" rel="noreferrer">page 22</a> of the Swedish children's book <em>Vill du läsa I</em> ("Would you like to read [vol I]") by painter Elsa Beskow. The <code>J</code> above it is for <em>julgran</em>, the Swedish word for <em>Christmas tree</em>.</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Forensics</h2>

<p>I say this on the basis that:</p>

<ol>
<li>I checked several thesauruses, like you, as well as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Axes" rel="noreferrer">Wikipedia's category for axes</a>, and while I found <em>adze</em>, <em>chopper</em>, <em>cleaver</em>, <em>hatchet</em>, <em>mattock</em>, <em>tomahawk</em>, <em>twibill</em> and so on, I found nothing approaching a word with an initial <code>y</code>.</li>
<li>I used <a href="http://onelook.com/" rel="noreferrer">OneLook.com</a>'s reverse-dictionary functionality to search for "words starting with a <code>y</code> and having a meaning relating to <em>axe</em>"¹ and the only thing suggested was <a href="http://www.onelook.com/thesaurus/?s=axe&amp;f_sw=y&amp;loc=wildcard3" rel="noreferrer"><em>yataghan</em></a>: "a long Turkish knife with a curved blade having a single edge". An <a href="http://www.oriental-arms.com/photos/items/77/001477/ph-0.jpg" rel="noreferrer">image search</a> tells us that no ball-maker would confuse this sword-like blade for an axe.</li>
<li>Going one step further, I checked <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Blade_weapons" rel="noreferrer">Wikipedia's comprehensive list of bladed weapons</a>, and from all countries, throughout all history, only 3 start with an initial <code>y</code>: <em>yanmaodao</em> (Chinese), <em>yari</em> (Japanese), and <em>yatagan</em> (Turkish). These are all sword-like weapons, not axe-like, and as mentioned in the previous bullet, of the three, only <em>yatagan</em> has made it into English dictionaries.</li>
<li>I used an online tool named <em>Translatr</em> to translate both <em>axe</em> and <a href="http://translatr.varunmalhotra.xyz/?ref=producthunt" rel="noreferrer"><em>hatchet</em> into 90+ languages</a>, and cross-checked these with the manual translations on Wiktionary, and literally the only word of those ~200 options which started with a <code>y</code> was Swedish <em>yxa</em>. </li>
</ol>

<p>Cross-checking the translation from Swedish back into English confirmed that Swedish <em>yxa</em> is English <em>axe</em>. And indeed it is used in Swedish children's primers to illustrate the letter <code>y</code>, as you can see from the children's book excerpt above.</p>

<h2>The crime scene</h2>

<p>As for the other symbols on the ball, we can analyze which letter-symbol pairings make sense in each language. Here I've tagged each pairing with ✅ to indicate "the name a toddler would shout out for the depicted object starts with the corresponding letter", ❌ for "no, it doesn't", and ❓ for "this pairing merits further discussion".</p>

<p>In English, the pairings are <strong>A</strong>pple✅, <strong>B</strong>ear✅, <strong>C</strong>at✅, <strong>D</strong>og✅, <strong>E</strong>lephant✅, <strong>F</strong>rog✅, <strong>G</strong>iraffe✅, <strong>H</strong>ouse✅, <strong>I</strong>ce✅, <strong>J</strong>et✅, <strong>K</strong>angaroo✅, <strong>L</strong>ion✅, <strong>M</strong>ouse✅, <strong>N</strong>ail✅, <strong>O</strong>wl✅, <strong>P</strong>ig✅, <strong>Q</strong>ueen✅, <strong>R</strong>ainbow✅, <strong>S</strong>nail✅, <strong>T</strong>iger✅, <strong>U</strong>boat❓, <strong>V</strong>olcano✅, <strong>W</strong>orm✅, <strong>X</strong>ylophone✅, <strong>Y</strong> / axe❌, <strong>Z</strong>ebra✅.</p>

<p>In Swedish, these correspond to <strong>Ä</strong>pple❌, <strong>B</strong>jörn✅, <strong>K</strong>att❌, <strong>H</strong>und❌, <strong>E</strong>lefant✅, <strong>G</strong>roda❌, <strong>G</strong>iraff✅, <strong>H</strong>us✅, <strong>I</strong>s✅, <strong>J</strong>et✅, <strong>K</strong>änguru✅, <strong>L</strong>ejon✅, <strong>M</strong>us✅, <strong>S</strong>pik❓², <strong>U</strong>ggla❌, <strong>G</strong>ris❌, <strong>D</strong>rottning❌, <strong>R</strong>egnbåge✅, <strong>S</strong>nigel✅, <strong>T</strong>iger✅, <strong>U</strong>båt✅, <strong>V</strong>ulkan✅, <strong>M</strong>ask❌³, <strong>X</strong>ylofon✅, <strong>Y</strong>xa✅, <strong>Z</strong>ebra✅.</p>

<p>As you can see, because most of these words</p>

<ul>
<li>are loanwords to both languages (like <em>kangaroo</em> or <em>giraffe</em>), or</li>
<li>are loanwords from English to Swedish (like <em>jet[plane]</em>), or</li>
<li>have [proto-]Germanic roots shared by both English and Swedish (like <em>house</em> and <em>mouse</em>), or</li>
<li>are completely artificial coinages (like <em>xylophone</em>)</li>
</ul>

<p>most pairings are sensible in both languages. </p>

<p>All told, in Swedish there are 8 words which simply do not fit, not to mention that, <a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/395382/which-word-begins-with-y-and-looks-like-an-axe-in-this-picture/395385?noredirect=1#comment938521_395385">as @jkej points out</a>, a Swedish ball would also have to present the letters <code>Å</code>, <code>Ä</code> and <code>Ö</code>, and would possibly choose to omit <code>W</code>. This rules out the possibility that this is a ball made for the Swedish market.</p>

<p>For English, on the other hand, outside the mysterious <code>Y</code>, all the pairings use straightforward, non-suspicious common nouns an English-speaking toddler would be familiar with<sup>4</sup>. </p>

<p>Except for one. That <em>U-boat</em> is Swedish-fishy.</p>

<h2>A new clue</h2>

<p>Almost no one refers to submarines as U-boats in contemporary English. Quoting <a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/395382/which-word-begins-with-y-and-looks-like-an-axe-in-this-picture/395385?noredirect=1#comment937798_395382">@tchrist's response</a> to that information:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>... especially how a submarine or “U-boat” picture that got used for the U, <strong>given how uncommon a word for a sub that U-boat is in English these days</strong> — and to a toddler rather than to a great-grandfather who might actually remember them. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which is evidence against the maker of the ball being completely familiar with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_As_She_Is_Spoke" rel="noreferrer">English as she is spoke</a>. </p>

<p>There's also positive evidence for "U" is for "U-boat" in Swedish children's primers. Quoting <a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/395382/which-word-begins-with-y-and-looks-like-an-axe-in-this-picture/395385?noredirect=1#comment937595_395385">@jkej in the comments</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The submarine could be seen as circumstantial evidence (although not very strong) for some kind of Swedish mix-up explanation. Although U-boat is an English word, it seems a little strange to use it in this context. But <strong>in Swedish ubåt is the only word for submarine</strong>.  </p>
  
  <p>I used Google Image to examine some English alphabet posters and it seemed like almost all of them used umbrella or unicorn for U, but none of them used a U-Boat. Similarly, <strong>I found several Swedish alphabet posters with ubåt for U</strong>, although uggla (owl) was more common. <strong>I can also confirm that yxa was very common for Y</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And indeed it's easy to turn up Swedish pedagogical material having both <code>Y</code> = <em>yxa</em> and <code>U</code> = <em>ubåt</em>, like this one from the Swedish site <a href="http://www.imgrum.net/tag/barnteckning" rel="noreferrer">imgrum.com</a>:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xzaQ9.jpg" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xzaQ9.jpg" alt="2x3 grid of letter-image pairs showing <code>T</code>-<code>Y</code>"></a></p>

<p>But it doesn't stop there.</p>

<h2>Following the footprints</h2>

<p>Following @jkej's lead on Fishpond.com, I found the manufacturer is <a href="http://www.ballbouncesport.com/" rel="noreferrer">Ball, Bounce and Sport Inc.</a><sup>5</sup></p>

<p>This is page 32 of <a href="http://www.ballbouncesport.com/catalog/flash/Default.html" rel="noreferrer">their online catalog</a> (you need to install Adobe Flash; their PDF catalog is broken<sup>6</sup>):</p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QSulU.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QSulU.png" alt="page 32 of Hedstrom toy catalog"></a></p>

<p><sub>Item G: 54-4155; #10 <strong>A-Z Phonics</strong>; 0-33149 04155-9</sub></p>

<p>However, though Fishpond.com listed "Ball, Bounce and Sport Inc." as the ball's manufacturer, upon visiting BB&amp;S' site, one immediately notices the headers and copy all immediately point to another name:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ERe05.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ERe05.png" alt="Hedstrom logo"></a></p>

<p>Structurally, Ball, Bounce and Sport Inc. was once a subsidiary of <a href="http://hedstrom.com/" rel="noreferrer">Hedstrom</a>, and through a series of fits and starts in the last century, eventually <a href="http://www.sbnonline.com/article/how-jim-braeunig-took-ball-bounce-and-sport-from-bankruptcy-to-booming-business/" rel="noreferrer">took ownership of the Hedstrom brand</a>, and now is  <a href="http://www.ballbouncesport.com/olditems.php" rel="noreferrer">doing business as</a> Hedstrom.</p>

<p>That is, <em>Hedstrom</em> is the ball manufacturer's preferred name for branding purposes. Which is interesting, because the name "Hedstrom" is Scandinavian; per <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedstrom" rel="noreferrer">Wikipedia's article on the surname</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Hedstrom</strong>, Hedström and Hedstrøm are surnames of <strong>Swedish</strong> and Norwegian origin</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Tailing the suspect</h2>

<p>So is the name <em>Hedstrom</em> indicative of Swedish influences on the ball's manufactoring process?</p>

<p>The <em>Smart Business</em> article linked above on BBS taking ownership of the the Hedstrom brand notes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>BBS owns 98 percent of U.S. and Canadian rubber ball markets and a growing percentage of the rotational molding market.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No mention of international markets. However, one influence I can find of non–North American interests in Hedstrom is that these sources confirm that manufacturing is done in Asia, as other answers and comments suggest:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>BB&amp;S’s Hedstrom Entertainment Division makes play balls and other toys in Asia</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But what about Sweden? I've read <a href="http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:pxa2mVcNRgMJ:www.hedstromplastics.com/our-company/history/%20&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us" rel="noreferrer">several</a> <a href="http://hedstrom.com/about-us/" rel="noreferrer">different</a> <a href="http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20041012/news05/200014205/toy-maker-hedstrom-folds" rel="noreferrer">histories</a> of Hedstrom. The accounts are confusing and at points seemingly contradictory, involving many name changes. </p>

<p>But <a href="http://times-gazette.com/local%20news/2011/02/25/-big-three-carry-on" rel="noreferrer">the salient event</a> was in 1981:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Eagle Rubber started making balloons out of a garage in 1916. The company grew and spawned an industry that led to Ashland becoming the balloon capital of the world. The company eventually added lines of plastic play balls. It was <strong>bought out by Hedstrom Inc. in 1981</strong>, which went bankrupt in 2004.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But if Eagle was the company who built up the play ball business, whence the the acquiring company, Hedstrom? According to <a href="http://www.harryrinker.com/col-1163.html" rel="noreferrer">this column of Harry Rinker</a>, who is an antiques appraiser and thereby somewhat of an historian:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Carl H. Hedstrom, E. Gustaf Hedstrom, Knute W. Hedstrom</strong>, Wilfred P. Shuffleton, and Walter Beaman founded the Hedstrom Company, Gardner, Massachusets in 1915.<br>
  ...
  The Hedstrom Corporation still exists. Its Bedford plant produces outdoor gym sets, <strong>play balls</strong>, toys, etc.  The Dotham operation is toy focused.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thus the name <em>Hedstrom</em> originates from three Swedes in 1915. The catalog above is dated ~2012, and page 32 lists several of the playballs as <em>new</em>, but not the phonics one, so it's not clear when the ball was first produced. But certainly a century passed between the reason for naming the company <em>Hedstrom</em> and producing the ball. </p>

<p>So, with a century and countless mergers, bankruptcies, and restructurings intervening, the Swedish name <em>Hedstrom</em>, while intriguing, cannot be adduced as evidence that the <code>Y</code> stands for <em>yxa</em>.</p>

<h2>The interrogation</h2>

<p>I reached out to Hedstrom via their online contact form, Twitter, and Facebook. They replied to me this morning via Facebook:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2YQeQ.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2YQeQ.png" alt="Facebook reply from Hedstrom with photo of A-Z Phonics ball pairing a *yoyo* with <code>Y</code>"></a></p>

<p>They confirm your ball is not an official Hedstrom A-Z Phonics ball. The <strong>official ball has a yo-yo for the letter <code>Y</code></strong>. The Hedstrom ball also has a UPC and producer's mark.</p>

<p>Further, Hedstrom confirms they do no business internationally (outside Canada, one assumes), and they're not aware of any specific producers who have a known history of copying their designs. </p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OoK23.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OoK23.png" alt="Follow-up FB message from Hedstrom confirming they do no business internationally"></a></p>

<p>A second customer service representative actually responded separately to my contact via their website, instead of Facebook. She did her own forensics, and corroborated that Hedstrom's opinion is that this is a knock-off ball:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thank you for visiting our website and for your online inquiry about an ABC Playball.  Unfortunately, I do not believe this ball was manufactured by Hedstrom.  I've <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ziA9p.jpg" rel="noreferrer">attached an image from our QA files of our ball</a> for your reference.  <strong>Some of the things that tip me</strong> off that this is not our ball are the elephant and kangaroo colors.  Also, there is considerably more white space on you ball whereas ours has more designs.  So, just for fun, I visited our samples department hoping to find this ball and I was able to find and inflate a sample of our ball.  <strong>Our playball has a Yo-Yo for the letter "Y"</strong>.  Another way you can tell is whether or not there is an official Hedstrom legal patch.  This patch would contain our name, Hedstrom Corporation, our address, our website, made in China in three different languages, a UPC barcode with the number 0-33149-04155-9 and a four-digit date code.  Our inflation valve should be concealed in the Robot "R" picture, too.  I'm not sure if your ball has our legal patch or not or where your inflation valve is located, but these are just a few of the way we identify our products.  It's probably not impossible for another manufacturer to find and use our designs as these are rather old for us and are not licensed or trademarked.  </p>
  
  <p>Hope that helps solve the mystery for you.  <strong>But we are of the opinion that this is a knock off and not an official Hedstrom produced playball</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One last follow-up, and she shared the history of the ball, to the extent she was able to dig up:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The records that I can still access tell me w<strong>e created this ball in 2004 and first sold it in 2005</strong>.  The last one was sold in 2008.  <strong>Our records don’t indicate ‘who’ might have been the designer at the time.</strong>  </p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Going under cover</h2>

<p>So that trail runs cold. The ball is a knock-off.  Let's examine it in more detail for clues.</p>

<p>Indeed, additional analysis reveals that your ball and the Hedstrom ball are very similar, but not identical. There are some differences which have to be taken into account.</p>

<p>In particular, <a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/395382/which-word-begins-with-y-and-looks-like-an-axe-in-this-picture/395385?noredirect=1#comment937988_395385">@H Walters points out</a> that the layout — that is, the positions of the symbols relative to one another — are different in your photograph than in the catalog thumbnail for the Hedstrom ball:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>K</code> and <code>E</code> are shared designs between the two images. The neighborhood around <code>K</code> and <code>E</code> are very different, however; in the OP image <code>K</code> and <code>E</code> are adjacent and at each others' "9 o'clock" (<code>E</code> being oriented differently); <code>Q</code> is at <code>K</code>'s 6, and <code>Y</code> at K's 7. In the catalog <code>K</code> and <code>E</code> aren't even adjacent; we can see <code>E</code>'s entire neighborhood (from 1 to 12: <code>BMDGHL</code>), and <code>K</code>'s neighborhood that can be seen is <code>JIDA</code>. So at the very least, if they're the same ball, <code>K</code> and <code>E</code> are repeated, which makes little sense.</p>

<p>And, <a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/395382/which-word-begins-with-y-and-looks-like-an-axe-in-this-picture/395385?noredirect=1#comment937988_395385">as @m69 further points out</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It's not just that the lay-out is different; look at which part of the letter E is covered by the elephant's ear; that's different too.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/i5dwK.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/i5dwK.png" alt="side-by-side comparison of Hedstrom and OP ball pictures"></a></p>

<p>Note also that in the photo of the ball that Hedstrom sent me, <code>V</code> is used for <em>vase</em>, not <em>volcano</em>, <code>R</code> is for <em>robot</em>, not <em>rainbow</em>, and the drawing of the nail for <code>N</code> is a slightly different style than on your ball.</p>

<h2>The stake-out</h2>

<p>Finally, <a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/395382/which-word-begins-with-y-and-looks-like-an-axe-in-this-picture/395385?noredirect=1#comment941010_395385">at @jkej's prompting</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It would add to the "circumstantial" evidence if we could find out the full set of pictures/words used on the original Hedstrom ball. Particularly, it would be very interesting if we could confirm that:   </p>
  
  <ol>
  <li>All words that are not sensible in English (i.e. Yxa and U-boat) were absent from the original.   </li>
  <li>All words not sensible in Swedish were present on the original.   </li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>If (2) holds it is possible that all words added to the knock-off were taken from a Swedish source. Given the pictures of the original that we already have, we only need to confirm that <strong>O</strong>wl, <strong>Q</strong>ueen and <strong>W</strong>orm were on the original to prove (2).  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I asked my contact at Hedstrom, and she replied:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>The ‘U’ has a red and white UMBRELLA.</strong>  The ‘O’ has a brown and yellow OWL.  The ‘Q’ has a QUEEN with white hair and a yellow crown with red &amp; blue jewels.  And ‘W’ is an orange and red WORM.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Based on this, @jkej's analysis is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I'd like to underscore that I think the answer from Hedstrom was a BIG step forward. It may seem like a dead end, but i<strong>t conclusively tells us that A) the pictures on the ball came from two distinctly separate sources, B) the general impression of an English ball can be fully explained by one of the sources, C) the pictures from the second source are better explained in Swedish.</strong> These were things we could only speculate about before. </p>
</blockquote>

<h2>DNE evidence</h2>

<p>So a third-party made a knock-off version of the ball, not unusual in Asian manufacture, and introduced these differences, and perhaps picked up some Swedish contagion in the process.</p>

<p>To confirm that, we'll have to pick up the scent of this mysterious DNE you found near the valve of your ball.</p>

<p>But to do that, we have to start at the other end of the trail. I've reached out to Lojas França via email and Facebook. The email bounced, but there's still hope they'll reply on Facebook.</p>

<h2>A hot lead!</h2>

<p>Meanwhile, an informant, <a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/395382/which-word-begins-with-y-and-looks-like-an-axe-in-this-picture/395385#comment941032_395385">@Brad Koch</a>, has it from some good sources in shady corners of the internet that <strong>the ball has been found</strong>. From <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14672359" rel="noreferrer">@thedrake on HackerNews</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I found the BALL manufacturer!!!!<br>
  <a href="https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/Alphabets-print-ball_573748097.html" rel="noreferrer">https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/Alphabets-print-ball_573748097.html</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YIkLK.jpg" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YIkLK.jpg" alt="ball pictures from Alibaba.com"></a></p>

<p>And what do we spy in the SW and SE corners of the right image (zoom in):</p>



<p>Our suspects! Hiding in China, right where our intelligence said they'd be.  And all the other images match as well.</p>

<p>Now to track down the manufacturer of these knock-off balls.</p>

<h2>The chase afoot</h2>

<p>From the Alibaba link, we find (one) producer of these balls is  Shanghai Jianhuiling Sporting Goods Co., Ltd. Tracking down <a href="http://www.hktdc.com/manufacturers-suppliers/Shanghai-Jianhuiling-Sporting-Goods-Company-Limited/en/1X03W4G8/" rel="noreferrer">the markets they operate in leads us to</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Nature of Business: Exporter‚ Manufacturer<br>
  Industry: Toys &amp; Games<br>
  Product/Service Range: Toys and Games<br>
  Major Market(s):<br>
  • Eastern Europe<br>
  • <strong>Western Europe</strong>  </p>
</blockquote>

<h2>A final fingerprint</h2>

<p>So while Hedstrom is not responsible for the axe on your ball, there is one last piece of evidence that <code>Y</code>=<em>yxa</em>.</p>

<p>We find the ball again on <a href="https://www.pinterest.se/pin/431219733041038600/" rel="noreferrer">a Swedish user's Pinterest page</a>. </p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CnJV3.jpg" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CnJV3.jpg" alt="A-Z Phonetics ball found on Swedish Pinterest page"></a></p>

<p>In fact, this one of <a href="https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=Alphabet&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbs=simg:CAQSlQEJBOaJ0JJxtOkaiQELEKjU2AQaAggKDAsQsIynCBpiCmAIAxIoshS3FKcKsxSmCqgKpxS4FJAK3h2bNZY1sSn2PfM9nTWeNfg9tiecKRowHvzPjflZDiTjoHy0QXGMFiZBvRMAdAuMrhEfdOmr0G6tIG58poQI734deofnHXWnIAQMCxCOrv4IGgoKCAgBEgT5_1KYbDA&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwin-rzPsNnUAhXMOiYKHdFPCh4Q2A4IJigB&amp;biw=1131&amp;bih=645" rel="noreferrer">only 3 sites</a> I could find anywhere on the Internet with an image of your ball<sup>7</sup>.</p>

<h2>Case <s>closed</s> open</h2>

<p>After all this, one thing is certain. Since the original designer of the ball, an American company whose employees are native speakers of English, used <em>yo-yo</em> to illustrate <code>y</code>, we know <strong>the intended word is not English</strong>.</p>

<p>Overall, adulteration of the ball with Swedish words seems indicated, though far from definitive.</p>

<p>But it's the best theory I've got. Except of course for <a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/395382/which-word-begins-with-y-and-looks-like-an-axe-in-this-picture#comment937271_395382">@Vincent Fourmond's conclusion</a> that we're dealing here with a <strong><em><a href="http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/markknopfler/yaketyaxe.html" rel="noreferrer">yakety axe</a></em></strong>.</p>

<hr>

<p>¹ <sub> I also tried "and related to": <em>hatchet</em>, <em>chop</em>, and <em>cut</em>, even though the latter two words are verbs and all the other symbols on the child's ball represent concrete nouns. Nothing material emerged.</sub></p>

<p>² <sub>We could make a case for <em>N</em> also fitting for Swedish, as <a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/395382/which-word-begins-with-y-and-looks-like-an-axe-in-this-picture/395711#comment938232_395382">@konaya points out</a>, by observing the depicted object could as easily be a tack, which is <strong><em>n</em></strong><em>ubb</em> in Swedish.</sub></p>

<p>³ <sub>Note that the <code>E</code> and <code>K</code> which are on the northermost latitude in the photograph have different orientations, and the symbol always has the same orientation as its letter (i.e., the top of the symbol shows you where the top of the letter is) so there is no concern that the <code>W</code> for <em>worm</em> might be <code>M</code> for <em>maggot</em> or anything.<p>I say this because I wondered for a moment whether the illustrator mistook <code>Y</code> for an upside-down <code>h</code> in <em>hatchet</em>.</p></sub></p>

<p><sup>4</sup> <sub>Which, taken as a holistic pattern, makes the <a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/a/395388/55623"><em>yellow</em></a> theory very <a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/395382/which-word-begins-with-y-and-looks-like-an-axe-in-this-picture/395385?noredirect=1#comment937132_395388">dubious</a>.</sub></p>

<p><sup>5</sup> <sub>Since this question was asked, the Fishpond.com product page has been removed, with no redirect. Likely that's due to the the popularity of this question causing many people to hit that page (which listed an out-of-stock item), causing needless load from their perspective. But <a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/395382/which-word-begins-with-y-and-looks-like-an-axe-in-this-picture/395385#comment939108_395385">through shrewd parameter hacking, @biolauri</a> got Google <a href="http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:tOAl0SvloBsJ:www.fishpond.com/Toys/Playground-Ball-Alphabet-Ball-Bounce-Sport/" rel="noreferrer">to serve up a cached version</a>. A <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EKz3d.png" rel="noreferrer">screenshot is available here</a>, for when the cache inevitably gets flushed and also disappears.</sub></p>

<p><sub>With the cached Fishpond.com page in hand, <a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/395382/which-word-begins-with-y-and-looks-like-an-axe-in-this-picture/395385#comment939363_395385">@H Walters did some source snooping</a> and noticed a number of references to the same number as in the Fishpond.com URL: 0033149041559. Many of these references were meta tags and hidden input fields, variously labelled <em>barcode</em> as in <code>&lt;input type="hidden" name="barcode" value="0033149041559" id="barcode" /&gt;</code> or <em>gtin13</em> as in <code>&lt;meta itemprop='gtin13' content='0033149041559' /&gt;</code>. It also exactly matches the code in the catalog (see caption under catalog screenshot; there it is listed in component form <a href="http://www.pacificbarcode.com/all-about-barcodes/" rel="noreferrer">Indicator-Company Prefix–Item Reference-Check Digit</a>), and <a href="http://gepir.gs1.org/index.php/search-by-gtin" rel="noreferrer">a barcode search</a> confirms the company prefix 0033149 is indeed owned by Ball, Bounce and Sport Inc.</sub></p>

<p><sub>An interesting discrepancy, however. While the Fishpond.com and BBS catalog barcode item reference match (04155), the associated "part numbers" do not. The catalog shows 54-4155: that is, group number 54 (likely "decorated play balls"), species 4155 (same as bar code item reference, less the leading 0). But Fishpond.com shows  <em>Other Information:   54-4246T</em>, which is the same group number (54, decorated play balls), but <strong>a different species</strong> 4246T.</sub></p>

<p><sup>6</sup> <sub>And we also know the wholesale price per dozen as of April 2013 was $1.77, thanks to <a href="https://docs.google.com/viewerng/viewer?url=http://media.wix.com/ugd/e48a2f_fa8bb3b5c6a97bd7baf7118b822eafee.xls?dn%3DHedstromSpecialtyPriceListApril2013.xls" rel="noreferrer">this price sheet</a> (file name "HedstromSpecialtyPriceListApril2013.xls") tracked down by <a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/395382/which-word-begins-with-y-and-looks-like-an-axe-in-this-picture#comment939485_395385">@Mari-Lou's UPC hunting skills</a>.</sub></p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lyo33.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lyo33.png" alt="2103 Hedstrom [Specialty] Price list"></a></p>

<p><sub>Note that the UPC / barcode is the same as in the catalog, 0-33149-04155-9, but the item number differs. The ~2012 catalog has 54-4155, but the 2013 price list has 54-4155<strong>4</strong>. This may be a typo, or it may be additional substantiation that one UPC may be used for different versions of the product.</sub></p>

<p><sup>7</sup> <sub>One potential risk here is that the Pinterest.se page was dynamically generated just for me, based on cookies set during the course of my research into "Swedish" and a young child's toy. Note the Swedish header translates to just a generic a "check out these fine products", and all the products offered are to toys for young children, related to reading, and all the descriptions are in English. But I think the risk here is low: I found the site through a reverse image search on Google, which suggests it pre-existed my research.</sub></p>

<p>In 1987, when residents of Jacobs Drive in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Gabriel,_Louisiana#Demographics" title="St. Gabriel, Louisiana">St. Gabriel</a>, a low-income community in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iberville_Parish,_Louisiana" title="Iberville Parish, Louisiana">Iberville Parish</a> with about 50% of its population consisting of inmates at two correctional facilities, noticed an abundance of cancer cases within their community, they coined the term "Cancer Alley" to reflect the concentration.

</p><p>In 2018, the Formosa Plastics Corporation proposed the Sunshine Project, a $9.4 billion industrial complex to be located on the west bank of St. James Parish that is estimated to become the petrochemical and plastics project with the single greatest environmental detriment, at an estimated 13,628,086 tons of greenhouse gas emissions yearly.<sup id="cite_ref-14"><a href="#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup> The proposed complex would span 2,500 acres and will be situated one mile from an elementary school,<sup id="cite_ref-biologicaldiversity.org_15-0"><a href="#cite_note-biologicaldiversity.org-15">[15]</a></sup> On January 15, 2020, RISE St. James, a faith-based grassroots organization of St. James Parish community members, in conjunction with the nonprofit conservation organization <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Biological_Diversity" title="Center for Biological Diversity">Center for Biological Diversity</a>, the grassroots organization <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_Bucket_Brigade" title="Louisiana Bucket Brigade">Louisiana Bucket Brigade</a>, and the nonprofit Healthy Gulf, sued the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_administration" title="Trump administration">Trump administration</a> for permitting Formosa Plastics' proposed petrochemical complex.

</p><p>While developments in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formosa_Plastics_Corporation" title="Formosa Plastics Corporation">Formosa Plastics Corporation</a> in St. James Parish remain to be monitored, the multigenerational disenfranchisement and exploitation of Black people and people of Color are difficult to ignore.

The threat of the hurricane's destruction caused the industries located in Cancer Alley to release unprocessed chemicals and gases into the air via "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flaring" title="Flaring">flaring</a>."<sup id="cite_ref-lungcancercenter.com_34-3"><a href="#cite_note-lungcancercenter.com-34">[34]</a></sup> Even though flaring causes chemicals to be released into the air, the process is legal in emergencies and burns the chemicals directly into the air.<sup id="cite_ref-lungcancercenter.com_34-4"><a href="#cite_note-lungcancercenter.com-34">[34]</a></sup> After the hurricane, residents were not only left with damaged homes but also more pollution in the air and water than usual.

<p>In recent years in the United States, the environmental protection and civil rights movements have merged to form an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_justice_movement" title="Environmental justice movement">environmental justice movement</a> in response to minority and low-income communities throughout the country being constantly threatened by pollution.<sup id="cite_ref-35"><a href="#cite_note-35">[35]</a></sup> Many communities that face the largest burdens from pollution tend to be poor and consist mainly of minorities. Due to this, poor and minority communities will resort to grassroots activism to protect themselves.
</p><p>In September 2022, environmental justice advocates in southern Louisiana were able to declare victory after two decisions denied two major petrochemical complexes from moving forward.<sup id="cite_ref-ncronline.org_36-0"><a href="#cite_note-ncronline.org-36">[36]</a></sup> The state district court judge Trudy White released a decision that reversed and vacated 14 air regulations permits that the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ) had issued for the proposed Formosa Plastics Group complex in the town of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welcome,_Louisiana" title="Welcome, Louisiana">Welcome</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-ncronline.org_36-1"><a href="#cite_note-ncronline.org-36">[36]</a></sup> The town already has multiple oil refineries and industrial plants and is located in Cancer Alley.
</p><p>Another group that has been actively fighting against the petrochemical industry in Cancer Alley is Rise St. James. Rise St. James is a faith-based grassroots organization that fights for environmental justice and works to defeat the proliferation of petrochemical industries in St. James Parish, Louisiana. The organization successfully defeated the construction of a $1.25 billion plastics manufacturing plant in 2019 and is currently fighting to prevent Formosa Plastics from building a multibillion-dollar plant in the parish.<sup id="cite_ref-Rise_St._James_37-0"><a href="#cite_note-Rise_St._James-37">[37]</a></sup> Rise St. James is also committed to educating the community and those outside of the community about the chemicals they breathe in every day. The organization's website includes a "Chemical of the Month" page and provides information on a specific chemical and how much it is found in certain areas of Cancer Alley.<sup id="cite_ref-Rise_St._James_37-1"><a href="#cite_note-Rise_St._James-37">[37]</a></sup>
