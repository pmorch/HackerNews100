            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/21/aws_ceo_entry_level_jobs_opinion/">https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/21/aws_ceo_entry_level_jobs_opinion/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44972151">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Amazon Web Services CEO Matt Garman has suggested firing junior workers because AI can do their jobs is "the dumbest thing I've ever heard."</p>
<p>Garman made that remark in <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfocTxMzOP4">conversation</a> with AI investor Matthew Berman, during which he talked up AWS’s <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/18/aws_updated_kiro_pricing/">Kiro AI-assisted coding tool</a> and said he's encountered business leaders who think AI tools "can replace all of our junior people in our company."</p>
<p>That notion led to the “dumbest thing I've ever heard” quote, followed by a justification that junior staff are “probably the least expensive employees you have” and also the most engaged with AI tools.</p>

    

<p>“How's that going to work when ten years in the future you have no one that has learned anything,” he asked. “My view is you absolutely want to keep hiring kids out of college and teaching them the right ways to go build software and decompose problems and think about it, just as much as you ever have.”</p>

        


        

<p>Naturally he thinks AI – and Kiro, natch – can help with that education.</p>
<p>Garman is also not keen on another idea about AI – measuring its value by what percentage of code it contributes at an organization.</p>

        

<p>“It’s a silly metric,” he said, because while organizations can use AI to write “infinitely more lines of code” it could be bad code.</p>
<p>“Often times fewer lines of code is way better than more lines of code,” he observed. “So I'm never really sure why that's the exciting metric that people like to brag about.”</p>
<p>That said, he’s seen data that suggests over 80 percent of AWS’s developers use AI in some way.</p>

        

<p>“Sometimes it's writing unit tests, sometimes it's helping write documentation, sometimes it's writing code, sometimes it's kind of an agentic workflow” in which developers collaborate with AI agents.</p>
<p>Garman said usage of AI tools by AWS developers increases every week.</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/20/amazon_quietly_fixed_q_developer_flaws/">Amazon quietly fixed Q Developer flaws that made AI agent vulnerable to prompt injection, RCE</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/20/aws_custom_xeons_r8_instances/">AWS still cares enough about Intel to order up a fresh batch of custom Xeons</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/18/aws_updated_kiro_pricing/">AWS pricing for Kiro dev tool dubbed 'a wallet-wrecking tragedy'</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/12/ibm_cloud_severity_one_outage/">IBM Cloud hit by Severity One incident with the same symptoms as other recent SNAFUs</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The CEO also offered some career advice for the AI age, suggesting that kids these days need to learn how to learn – and not just learn specific skills.</p>
<p>“I think the skills that should be emphasized are how do you think for yourself? How do you develop critical reasoning for solving problems? How do you develop creativity? How do you develop a learning mindset that you're going to go learn to do the next thing?”</p>
<p>Garman thinks that approach is necessary because technological development is now so rapid it’s no longer sensible to expect that studying narrow skills can sustain a career for 30 years. He wants educators to instead teach “how do you think and how do you decompose problems”, and thinks kids who acquire those skills will thrive. ®</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Picture this: you send a seemingly harmless image to an LLM and suddenly it exfiltrates all of your user data. By delivering a multi-modal prompt injection not visible to the user, we achieved data exfiltration on systems including the Google Gemini CLI. This attack works because AI systems often scale down large images before sending them to the model: when scaled, these images can reveal prompt injections that are not visible at full resolution.</p><p>In this blog post, we’ll detail how attackers can <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity20/presentation/quiring">exploit image scaling</a> on Gemini CLI, Vertex AI Studio, Gemini’s web and API interfaces, Google Assistant, Genspark, and other production AI systems. We’ll also explain how to mitigate and defend against these attacks, and we’ll introduce <a href="https://github.com/trailofbits/anamorpher">Anamorpher</a>, our open-source tool that lets you explore and generate these crafted images.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.trailofbits.com/img/image_scaling_figure_1.png" alt="Image showing a side-by-side comparison of an image that is harmless at the original resolution but contains a prompt injection when scaled down"><figcaption>Figure 1: Ghost in the Scale: Side-by-side comparison of an image that is harmless at the original resolution but contains a prompt injection when scaled down</figcaption></figure><p><em>Background</em>: <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity19/presentation/xiao">Image scaling attacks</a> were used for model <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08633">backdoors, evasion, and poisoning</a> primarily against older computer vision systems that enforced a fixed image size. While this constraint is less common with newer approaches, the systems surrounding the model may still impose constraints calling for image scaling. This establishes an underexposed, yet widespread vulnerability that we’ve weaponized for <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/how-hackers-exploit-ais-problem-solving-instincts/">multi-modal prompt injection</a>.</p><h2 id="data-exfiltration-on-the-gemini-cli">Data exfiltration on the Gemini CLI</h2><figure><img src="https://blog.trailofbits.com/img/image_scaling_figure_2.gif" alt="Scale to fail in the Gemini CLI"><figcaption>Figure 2: Scale to fail in the Gemini CLI</figcaption></figure><p>To set up our data exfiltration exploit on the Gemini CLI through an image-scaling attack, we applied the default configuration for the Zapier MCP server. This automatically approves all MCP tool calls without user confirmation, <a href="https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/5598">as it sets <code>trust=True</code> in the <code>settings.json</code> of the Gemini CLI</a>. This provides an important primitive for the attacker.</p><p>Figure 2 showcases a video of the attack. First, the user uploads a seemingly benign image to the CLI. With no preview available, the user cannot see the transformed, malicious image processed by the model. This image and its prompt-ergeist triggers actions from Zapier that exfiltrates user data stored in Google Calendar to an attacker’s email without confirmation.</p><p>This attack is one of many prompt injection attacks already demonstrated on agentic coding tools (including Claude Code and OpenAI Codex). Prior attacks have achieved data exfiltration and remote code execution by <a href="https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2025/claude-code-exfiltration-via-dns-requests/">exploiting unsafe actions contained in sandboxes</a>, <a href="https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2025/chatgpt-codex-remote-control-zombai/">utilizing overly permissive domains contained in network allowlists</a>, and <a href="https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2025/github-copilot-remote-code-execution-via-prompt-injection/">bypassing user confirmation by changing environment configurations</a>. Evidently, these agentic coding tools continue to lack sufficiently secure defaults, design patterns, or systematic defenses that minimize the possibility of impactful prompt injection.</p><h2 id="even-more-attacks">Even more attacks</h2><figure><img src="https://blog.trailofbits.com/img/image_scaling_figure_3.gif" alt="Honey, I shrunk the payload on Genspark"><figcaption>Figure 3: Honey, I shrunk the payload on Genspark</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://blog.trailofbits.com/img/image_scaling_figure_4.gif" alt="Injection through the looking glass on Vertex AI Studio"><figcaption>Figure 4: Injection through the looking glass on Vertex AI Studio</figcaption></figure><p>We also successfully demonstrated image scaling attacks on the following:</p><ul><li>Vertex AI with a Gemini back end</li><li>Gemini’s web interface</li><li>Gemini’s API via the <code>llm</code> CLI</li><li>Google Assistant on an Android phone</li><li>Genspark</li></ul><p>Notice the persistent mismatch between user perception and model inputs in figures 3 and 4. The exploit is particularly impactful on Vertex AI Studio because the front-end UI shows the high-resolution image instead of the downscaled image perceived by the model.</p><p>Our testing confirmed that this attack vector is widespread, extending far beyond the applications and systems documented here.</p><h2 id="sharpening-the-attack-surface">Sharpening the attack surface</h2><p>These image scaling attacks exploit downscaling algorithms (or <a href="https://guide.encode.moe/encoding/resampling.html">image resampling algorithms</a>), which perform interpolation to turn multiple high resolution pixel values into a single low resolution pixel value.</p><p>There are three major downscaling algorithms: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nearest-neighbor_interpolation">nearest neighbor interpolation</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilinear_interpolation">bilinear interpolation</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicubic_interpolation">bicubic interpolation</a>. Each algorithm requires a different approach to perform an image scaling attack. Furthermore, these algorithms are implemented differently across libraries (e.g., Pillow, PyTorch, OpenCV, TensorFlow), with varying anti-aliasing, alignment, and kernel phases (in addition to <a href="https://bartwronski.com/2021/02/15/bilinear-down-upsampling-pixel-grids-and-that-half-pixel-offset/">distinct bugs</a> that historically have <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.11222">plagued model performance</a>). These differences also impact the techniques necessary for an image scaling attack. Therefore, exploiting production systems required us to fingerprint each system’s algorithm and implementation.</p><p>We developed a custom test suite and methodology to fingerprint downscaling algorithms across different implementations. Core components of this test suite include images with <a href="https://nicola.asuni.xyz/papers/20140923_STAG_ASUNI_TESTIMAGES.pdf">checkerboard patterns, concentric circles, vertical and horizontal bands</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moir%C3%A9_pattern">Moiré patterns</a>, and <a href="https://www.imatest.com/imaging/sharpness/">slanted edges</a>. These would reveal <a href="https://guide.encode.moe/encoding/video-artifacts.html">artifacts</a> such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ringing_artifacts">ringing</a>, blurring, edge handling, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliasing">aliasing</a>, and <a href="https://www.imatest.com/docs/nyquist-aliasing/">inconsistencies in color</a> caused by the underlying downscaling algorithm. This typically provided a sufficient amount of information to determine the algorithm and implementation, enabling us to choose from one of our crafted attacks.</p><h2 id="nyquists-nightmares">Nyquist’s nightmares</h2><p>To understand why image downscaling attacks are possible, imagine that you have a long ribbon with an intricate yet regular pattern on it. As this ribbon is pulled past you, you’re trying to recreate the pattern by grabbing samples of the ribbon at regular intervals. If the pattern changes rapidly, you need to grab samples very frequently to capture all the details. If you’re too slow, you’ll miss crucial parts between grabs, and when you try to reconstruct the pattern from your samples, it looks completely different from the original.</p><p>In this analogy, your hand is the sampler, and if the sampling rate falls below a certain threshold (i.e., your hand isn’t fast enough), you cannot unambiguously reconstruct the pattern. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist%E2%80%93Shannon_sampling_theorem">This aliasing effect is a consequence of the Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem</a>. Exploiting this ambiguity by manipulating specific pixels such that a target pattern emerges is exactly what image scaling attacks do. Refer to <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/sec20fall_quiring_prepub.pdf">Quiring et al.</a> for a more detailed explanation.</p><h2 id="anamorpher-and-the-attackers-darkroom">Anamorpher and the attacker’s darkroom</h2><p>Currently, Anamorpher (named after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anamorphosis">anamorphosis</a>) can develop crafted images for the aforementioned three major methods. Let’s explore how Anamorpher exploits bicubic interpolation frame by frame.</p><p>Bicubic interpolation considers the 16 pixels (from 4x4 sampling) around each target pixel, using cubic polynomials to calculate smooth transitions between pixel values. This method creates a predictable mathematical relationship that can be exploited. Specifically, the algorithm assigns different weights to pixels in the neighborhood, creating pixels that contribute more to the final output, which are known as high-importance pixels. Therefore, the total <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luma_(video)">luma</a> (brightness) of dark areas of an image will increase if specific high-importance pixels are higher luma than their surroundings.</p><p>Therefore, to exploit this, we can carefully craft high-resolution pixels and solve the inverse problem. First, we select a decoy image with large dark areas to hide our payload. Then, we adjust pixels in dark regions and push the downsampled result toward a red background using least-squares optimization. These adjustments in the dark areas cause the background to turn red while text areas remain largely unmodified and appear black, creating much stronger contrast than visible at full resolution. While this approach is most effective on bicubic downscaling, it also works on specific implementations of bilinear downscaling.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.trailofbits.com/img/image_scaling_figure_5.png" alt="How Anamorpher applies this technique on OpenCV’s implementation of bicubic interpolation"><figcaption>Figure 5: How Anamorpher applies this technique on OpenCV’s implementation of bicubic interpolation</figcaption></figure><p>Anamorpher provides users with the ability to visualize and craft image scaling attacks against specific algorithms and implementations through a front-end interface and Python API. In addition, it comes with a modular back end, which enables users to customize their own downscaling algorithm.</p><h2 id="mitigation-and-defense">Mitigation and defense</h2><p>While some downscaling algorithms are more vulnerable than others, attempting to identify the least vulnerable algorithm and implementation is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.08690">not a robust approach</a>. This is especially true since image scaling attacks are not restricted to the aforementioned three algorithms.</p><p>For a secure system, we recommend not using image downscaling and simply limiting the upload dimensions. For any transformation, but especially if downscaling is necessary, the end user should always be provided with a preview of the input that the model is actually seeing, even in CLI and API tools.</p><p>The strongest defense, however, is to implement <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08837">secure design patterns and systematic</a> defenses that mitigate impactful prompt injection beyond multi-modal prompt injection. Inputs, but especially text within an image, should not be able to initiate sensitive tool calls without explicit user confirmation. Refer to our <a href="https://blog.trailofbits.com/2025/07/31/hijacking-multi-agent-systems-in-your-pajamas/#building-secure-mass">prior guidance on securing agentic systems</a>.</p><h2 id="now-what">Now what?</h2><p>Image scaling attacks may be even more impactful on mobile and edge devices where fixed image sizes are more frequently enforced and suboptimal downscaling algorithms are readily available within the <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Bitmap#createScaledBitmap(android.graphics.Bitmap,%20int,%20int,%20boolean)">default frameworks and tools</a>. Future work should examine the impact on these devices as well as the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06256">additional attack surface introduced by voice AI</a>. It would also be useful to explore more effective fingerprinting approaches, <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/securing-agentic-ai-how-semantic-prompt-injections-bypass-ai-guardrails/">semantic prompt injection</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11615">factorized diffusion</a>, <a href="https://blog.trailofbits.com/2019/11/01/two-new-tools-that-tame-the-treachery-of-files/">polyglots</a>, and additional artifact exploitation, especially any typically chained with upscaling (such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dither">dithering</a>).</p><p><a href="https://github.com/trailofbits/anamorpher">Anamorpher</a> is currently in beta, so feel free to reach out with feedback and suggestions as we continue to improve this tool.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Cloud services giant Fastly has released a report claiming AI crawlers are putting a heavy load on the open web, slurping up sites at a rate that accounts for 80 percent of all AI bot traffic, with the remaining 20 percent used by AI fetchers. Bots and fetchers can hit websites hard, demanding data from a single site in thousands of requests per minute.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>I can only see one thing causing this to stop: the AI bubble popping</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to the <a href="https://learn.fastly.com/rs/025-XKO-469/images/Fastly-Threat-Insights-Report.pdf">report</a> [PDF], Facebook owner Meta's AI division accounts for more than half of those crawlers, while OpenAI accounts for the overwhelming majority of on-demand fetch requests.</p>
<div><p><img src="https://regmedia.co.uk/2025/07/01/tollbooth.jpg?x=174&amp;amp;y=115&amp;amp;crop=1" width="174" height="115" alt="tollbooth"></p><h2 title="The bargain between content makers and crawlers has broken down">Cloudflare creates AI crawler tollbooth to pay publishers</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/07/01/cloudflare_creates_ai_crawler_toll/"><span>READ MORE</span></a></p></div>
<p>"AI bots are reshaping how the internet is accessed and experienced, introducing new complexities for digital platforms," Fastly senior security researcher Arun Kumar opined in a statement on the report's release. "Whether scraping for training data or delivering real-time responses, these bots create new challenges for visibility, control, and cost. You can't secure what you can't see, and without clear verification standards, AI-driven automation risks are becoming a blind spot for digital teams."</p>
<p>The company's report is based on analysis of Fastly's Next-Gen Web Application Firewall (NGWAF) and Bot Management services, which the company says "protect over 130,000 applications and APIs and inspect more than 6.5 trillion requests per month" – giving it plenty of data to play with. The data reveals a growing problem: an increasing website load comes not from human visitors, but from automated crawlers and fetchers working on behalf of chatbot firms.</p>
<p>The report warned, "Some AI bots, if not carefully engineered, can inadvertently impose an unsustainable load on webservers," Fastly's report warned, "leading to performance degradation, service disruption, and increased operational costs." Kumar separately noted to The Register, "Clearly this growth isn't sustainable, creating operational challenges while also undermining the business model of content creators.&nbsp; We as an industry need to do more to establish responsible norms and standards for crawling that allows AI companies to get the data they need while respecting websites content guidelines."</p>
<p>That growing traffic comes from just a select few companies. Meta accounted for more than half of all AI crawler traffic on its own, at 52 percent, followed by Google and OpenAI at 23 percent and 20 percent respectively. This trio then has its hands on a combined 95 percent of all AI crawler traffic. Anthropic, by contrast, accounted for just 3.76 percent of crawler traffic. The Common Crawl Project, which slurps websites to include in a free public dataset designed to prevent duplication of effort and traffic multiplication at the heart of the crawler problem, was a surprisingly-low 0.21 percent.</p>

    

<p>The story flips when it comes to AI fetchers, which unlike crawlers are fired off on-demand when a user requests that a model incorporates information newer than its training cut-off date. Here, OpenAI was by far the dominant traffic source, Fastly found, accounting for almost 98 percent of all requests. That's an indication, perhaps, of just how much of a lead OpenAI's early entry into the consumer-facing AI chatbot market with ChatGPT gave the company, or possibly just a sign that the company's bot infrastructure may be in need of optimization.</p>

        


        

<p>While AI fetchers make up a minority of Ai bot requests – only about 20%, says Kumar – they can be responsible for huge bursts of traffic, with one fetcher generating over 39,000 requests per minute during the testing period. "We expect fetcher traffic to grow as AI tools become more widely adopted and as more agentic tools come into use that mediate the experience between people and websites," Kumar told <em>The Register</em>.</p>
<p>Perplexity AI, which was <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/04/perplexity_ai_crawlers_accused_data_raids/">recently accused</a> of using IP addresses outside its reported crawler ranges and ignoring robots.txt directives from sites looking to opt out of being scraped, accounted for just 1.12 percent of AI crawler bot and 1.53 percent of AI fetcher bot traffic recorded for the report – though the report noted that this is growing.</p>

        

<p>Kumar decried the practice of ignoring robots.txt notes, telling <em>El Reg</em>, "At a minimum, any reputable AI company today should be honoring robots.txt. Further and even more critically, they should publish their IP address ranges and their bots should use unique names. This will empower site operators to better distinguish the bots crawling their sites and allow them to enforce granular&nbsp; rules with bot management solutions."</p>
<p>But he stopped short of calling for mandated standards, saying that industry forums are working on solutions. "We need to let those processes play out.&nbsp; Mandating technical standards in regulatory frameworks often does not produce a good outcome and shouldn't be our first resort."</p>

</ul>
<p>It's a problem large enough that users have begun fighting back. In the face of bots riding roughshod over polite opt-outs like robots.txt directives, webmasters are increasingly turning to active countermeasures like <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/07/09/anubis_fighting_the_llm_hordes/">the proof-of-work Anubis</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/03/18/ai_crawlers_sourcehut/">gibberish-feeding tarpit Nepenthes</a>, while Fastly rival Cloudflare has been testing a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/07/01/cloudflare_creates_ai_crawler_toll/">pay-per-crawl approach</a> to put a financial burden on the bot operators. "Care must be exercised when employing these techniques," Fastly's report warned, "to avoid accidentally blocking legitimate users or downgrading their experience."</p>
<p>Kumar notes that small site operators, especially those serving dynamic content, are most likely to feel the effects most severely, and he had some recommendations. "The first and simplest step is to configure robots.txt which immediately reduces traffic from well-behaved bots. When technical expertise is available, websites can also deploy controls such as Anubis, which can help reduce bot traffic." He warned, however, that bots are always improving and trying to find ways around "tarpits" like Anubis, as code-hosting site Codeberg <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/15/codeberg_beset_by_ai_bots/">recently experienced</a>. "This creates a constant cat and mouse game, similar to what we observe with other types of bots today," he said.</p>
<p>We spoke to Anubis developer Xe Iaso, CEO of Techaro. When we asked whether they expected the growth in crawler traffic to slow, they said: "I can only see one thing causing this to stop: the AI bubble popping.</p>

        

<p>"There is simply too much hype to give people worse versions of documents, emails, and websites otherwise. I don't know what this actually gives people, but our industry takes great pride in doing this."</p>
<p>However, they added: "I see no reason why it would not grow. People are using these tools to replace knowledge and gaining skills. There's no reason to assume that this attack against our cultural sense of thrift will not continue. This is the perfect attack against middle-management: unsleeping automatons that never get sick, go on vacation, or need to be paid health insurance that can produce output that superficially resembles the output of human employees. I see no reason that this will continue to grow until and unless the bubble pops. Even then, a lot of those scrapers will probably stick around until their venture capital runs out."</p>
<h3>Regulation – we've heard of it</h3>
<p><em>The Register</em> asked Xe whether they thought broader deployment of Anubis and other active countermeasures would help.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/07/09/anubis_fighting_the_llm_hordes/"><span>READ MORE</span></a></p></div>
<p>They responded: "This is a regulatory issue. The thing that needs to happen is that governments need to step in and give these AI companies that are destroying the digital common good existentially threatening fines and make them pay reparations to the communities they are harming. Ironically enough, most of these AI companies rely on the communities they are destroying.</p>
<p>"This presents the kind of paradox that I would expect to read in a Neal Stephenson book from the '90s, not CBC's front page. Anubis helps mitigate a lot of the badness by making attacks more computationally expensive. Anubis (even in configurations that omit proof of work) makes attackers have to retool their scraping to use headless browsers instead of blindly scraping HTML."</p>
<p>And who is paying the piper?</p>
<p>"This increases the infrastructure costs of the AI companies propagating this abusive traffic. The hope is that this makes it fiscally unviable for AI companies to scrape by making them have to dedicate much more hardware to the problem. In essence: it makes the scrapers have to spend more money to do the same work."</p>
<p>We approached Anthropic, Google, Meta, OpenAI, and Perplexity but none provided a comment on the report by the time of publication. ®</p>

	</header>

	<p>For my <a href="https://osrd.fr/en/">day job</a>, I need to build and run a <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/">Docker Compose</a> project.
However, because Docker <a href="https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/26824">doesn’t play well with nftables</a> and I
prefer a rootless + daemonless approach, I’m using <a href="https://podman.io/">Podman</a>.</p>
<p>Podman supports Docker Compose projects with two possible solutions: either by
connecting the official <a href="https://github.com/docker/compose/">Docker Compose CLI</a> to a Podman socket, either by
using <a href="https://github.com/containers/podman-compose">their own drop-in replacement</a>. They ship a
<a href="https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-compose.1.html">small wrapper</a> to select one of these options. (The
wrapper has the same name as the replacement, which makes things confusing.)</p>
<p>Unfortunately, both options have downsides. When using the official Docker
Compose CLI, the classic builder is used instead of the newer <a href="https://docs.docker.com/build/buildkit/">BuildKit</a>
builder. As a result, some features such as <a href="https://docs.docker.com/reference/compose-file/build/#additional_contexts">additional contexts</a> are not
supported. When using the podman-compose replacement, some other features are
missing, such as <code>!reset</code>, <code>configs</code> and referencing another service in
additional contexts. It would be possible to add these features to
podman-compose, but that’s an endless stream of work (Docker Compose regularly
adds new features) and I don’t really see the value in re-implementing all of
this (the fact that it’s Python doesn’t help me getting motivated).</p>
<p>I’ve started looking for a way to convince the Docker Compose CLI to run under
Podman with BuildKit enabled. I’ve tried a few months ago and never got it to
work, but it seems like this recently became easier! The podman-compose wrapper
<a href="https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/1e7f810f714240f5d68f92baa1ab39ee53a249f5/cmd/podman/compose.go#L164">force-disables BuildKit</a>, so we need to use
directly the Docker Compose CLI without the wrapper. On Arch Linux, this can be
achieved by enabling the Podman socket and creating a new Docker context (same
as setting <code>DOCKER_HOST</code>, but more permanent):</p>
<pre><code>pacman -S docker-compose docker-buildx
systemctl --user start podman.socket
docker context create podman --docker host=unix://$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/podman/podman.sock
docker context use podman
</code></pre>
<p>With that, <code>docker compose</code> just works! It turns out it automagically creates a
<code>buildx_buildkit_default</code> container under-the-hood to run the BuildKit daemon.
Since I don’t like automagical things, I immediately tried to run BuildKit
daemon myself:</p>
<pre><code>pacman -S buildkit
systemctl --user start buildkit.service
docker buildx create --name local unix://$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/buildkit/rootless
docker buildx use local
</code></pre>
<p>Now <code>docker compose</code> uses our systemd-managed BuildKit service. But we’re not
done yet! One of the reasons I like Podman is because it’s daemonless, and
we’ve got a daemon running in the background. This isn’t the end of the world,
but it’d be nicer to be able to run the build without BuildKit.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there’s a way around this: any Compose project can be turned into
a JSON description of the build commands called <a href="https://docs.docker.com/build/bake/">Bake</a>. <code>docker buildx bake --print</code> will print that JSON file (and the Docker Compose CLI will use Bake
files if <code>COMPOSE_BAKE=true</code> is set since v2.33). Note, Bake supports way more
features (e.g. HCL files) but we don’t really need these for our purposes (and
the command above can lower fancy Bake files into dumb JSON ones).</p>
<p>The JSON file is pretty similar to the <code>podman build</code> CLI arguments. It’s not
that hard to do the translation, so I’ve written <a href="https://github.com/emersion/bakah">Bakah</a>, a small tool which
does exactly this. It uses <a href="https://buildah.io/">Buildah</a> instead of shelling out to Podman (Buildah
is the library used by Podman under-the-hood to build images). A few details
required a bit more attention, for instance dependency resolution and parallel
builds, but it’s quite simple. It can be used like so:</p>
<pre><code>docker buildx bake --print &gt;bake.json
bakah --file bake.json
</code></pre>
<p>Bakah is still missing the fancier Bake features (HCL files, inheritance,
merging/overriding files, variables, and so on), but it’s enough to build
complex Compose projects. I plan to use it for <a href="https://codeberg.org/emersion/soju-containers">soju-containers</a> in the future,
to better split my Dockerfiles (one for the backend, one for the frontend) and
remove the CI shell script (which contains a bunch of Podman CLI invocations).
I hope it can be useful to you as well!</p>

<p dir="auto">DiffMem is a lightweight, git-based memory backend designed for AI agents and conversational systems. It uses Markdown files for human-readable storage, Git for tracking temporal evolution through differentials, and an in-memory BM25 index for fast, explainable retrieval. This project is a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploring how version control systems can serve as a foundation for efficient, scalable memory in AI applications.</p>
<p dir="auto">At its core, DiffMem treats memory as a versioned repository: the "current state" of knowledge is stored in editable files, while historical changes are preserved in Git's commit graph. This separation allows agents to query and search against a compact, up-to-date surface without the overhead of historical data, while enabling deep dives into evolution when needed.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Why Git for AI Memory?</h2><a id="user-content-why-git-for-ai-memory" aria-label="Permalink: Why Git for AI Memory?" href="#why-git-for-ai-memory"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Traditional memory systems for AI agents often rely on databases, vector stores, or graph structures. These work well for certain scales but can become bloated or inefficient when dealing with long-term, evolving personal knowledge. DiffMem takes a different path by leveraging Git's strengths:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Current-State Focus</strong>: Memory files store only the "now" view of information (e.g., current relationships, facts, or timelines). This reduces the surface area for queries and searches, making operations faster and more token-efficient in LLM contexts. Historical states are not loaded by default—they live in Git's history, accessible on-demand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Differential Intelligence</strong>: Git diffs and logs provide a natural way to track how memories evolve. Agents can ask "How has this fact changed over time?" without scanning entire histories, pulling only relevant commits. This mirrors how human memory reconstructs events from cues, not full replays.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Durability and Portability</strong>: Plaintext Markdown ensures memories are human-readable and tool-agnostic. Git's distributed nature means your data is backup-friendly and not locked into proprietary formats.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Efficiency for Agents</strong>: By separating "surface" (current files) from "depth" (git history), agents can be selective—load the now for quick responses, dive into diffs for analytical tasks. This keeps context windows lean while enabling rich temporal reasoning.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">This approach shines for long-horizon AI systems where memories accumulate over years: it scales without sprawl, maintains auditability, and allows "smart forgetting" through pruning while preserving reconstructability.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How It Works</h2><a id="user-content-how-it-works" aria-label="Permalink: How It Works" href="#how-it-works"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">DiffMem is structured as importable modules—no servers required. Key components:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Writer Agent</strong> (<code>writer_agent</code>): Analyzes conversation transcripts, identifies/creates entities, stages updates in Git's working tree. Commits are explicit, ensuring atomic changes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Context Manager</strong> (<code>context_manager</code>): Assembles query-relevant context at varying depths (basic: core blocks; wide: semantic search; deep: full files; temporal: with git history).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Searcher Agent</strong> (<code>searcher_agent</code>): LLM-orchestrated BM25 search—distills queries from conversations, retrieves snippets, synthesizes responses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>API Layer</strong> (<code>api.py</code>): Clean interface for read/write operations. Example:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="from diffmem import DiffMemory

memory = DiffMemory(&quot;/path/to/repo&quot;, &quot;alex&quot;, &quot;your-api-key&quot;)

# Get context for a conversation
context = memory.get_context(conversation, depth=&quot;deep&quot;)

# Process and commit new memory
memory.process_and_commit_session(&quot;Had coffee with mom today...&quot;, &quot;session-123&quot;)"><pre><span>from</span> <span>diffmem</span> <span>import</span> <span>DiffMemory</span>

<span>memory</span> <span>=</span> <span>DiffMemory</span>(<span>"/path/to/repo"</span>, <span>"alex"</span>, <span>"your-api-key"</span>)

<span># Get context for a conversation</span>
<span>context</span> <span>=</span> <span>memory</span>.<span>get_context</span>(<span>conversation</span>, <span>depth</span><span>=</span><span>"deep"</span>)

<span># Process and commit new memory</span>
<span>memory</span>.<span>process_and_commit_session</span>(<span>"Had coffee with mom today..."</span>, <span>"session-123"</span>)</pre></div>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">The repo follows a structured layout (see <code>repo_guide.md</code> for details), with current states in Markdown files and evolution in Git commits. Indexing is in-memory for speed, rebuilt on demand.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Why This Works</h2><a id="user-content-why-this-works" aria-label="Permalink: Why This Works" href="#why-this-works"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">DiffMem's git-centric design solves key challenges in AI memory systems:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Reduced Query Surface</strong>: Only current-state files are indexed/searched by default. This minimizes noise in BM25 results and keeps LLM contexts concise—crucial for token limits. When history is needed, agents pull targeted diffs (e.g., <code>git diff HEAD~1 file.md</code>), not full archives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Scalable Evolution Tracking</strong>: Git handles 50+ years of changes efficiently. Agents can reconstruct past states (<code>git show &lt;commit&gt;:file.md</code>) without bloating active memory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Developer-Friendly</strong>: No DB schemas or migrations—edit Markdown directly. Git provides free versioning, branching (e.g., monthly timelines), and collaboration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Lightweight PoC</strong>: Runs in-process, minimal deps (gitpython, rank-bm25, sentence-transformers). Easy to hack on.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Prototype Status and Limitations</h2><a id="user-content-prototype-status-and-limitations" aria-label="Permalink: Prototype Status and Limitations" href="#prototype-status-and-limitations"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">This is an early PoC—functional but not production-hardened. What's working:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Entity creation/update from transcripts.</li>
<li>Multi-depth context assembly.</li>
<li>Semantic/BM25 hybrid search.</li>
<li>Git-based temporal queries.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Known limitations:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>No automatic git sync (manual pulls/pushes).</li>
<li>Basic error handling.</li>
<li>Index rebuilds on every init (add caching for production).</li>
<li>No multi-user concurrency locks.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">We're sharing this as open-source R&amp;D to spark discussion. Feedback welcome!</p>

<p dir="auto">DiffMem points to a future where AI memory is as versioned and collaborative as code. Imagine:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Agent-Driven Pruning</strong>: LLMs that "forget" low-strength memories by archiving to git branches, mimicking neural plasticity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Collaborative Memories</strong>: Multi-agent systems sharing repos, with merge requests for "memory reconciliation."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Temporal Agents</strong>: Specialized models that query git logs to answer "how did I change?"—enabling self-reflective AI.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Hybrid Stores</strong>: Combine with vector embeddings for semantic depth, using git as the "diff layer" over embeddings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Open-Source Ecosystem</strong>: Plugins for voice input, mobile sync, or integration with tools like Obsidian.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">As AI agents become long-lived companions, git-like systems could make them evolvable without data silos. We're excited to see where the community takes this—perhaps toward distributed, privacy-first personal AIs.</p>
<p dir="auto">This is an R&amp;D project from Growth Kinetics, a boutique data solutions agency specializing in AI enablement. We're exploring how differential memory can power next-gen agents. We'd love collaborations, PRs, or honest feedback to improve it.</p>

technology is the wrong way to look at it.</p><p>it would be like trying to obsess intensely over hammers, nails, saw to build a house. tech is the same; it’s just a set of tools to do something.</p><p>enter my favorite method to get your life untangled, which I call the wafflehouse method (bear with me, I swear this blog post is useful).</p><p>I’ll detail here how to use it, but remember that untangling your life goals is a deeply personal process. </p><p>take inspiration from this, but feel free to modify so that it feels good.</p><p>call in sick, cancel your meetings and plans for two days.</p><p>straight in the middle of the week.</p><p>don’t tell your kids, wife, moms or friends that you are taking off.</p><p>you are going to go on a deeply personal introspective adventure and the only one invited is you.</p><p>48h to find yourself in the whole year is the least you can do.</p><p>sorry for the image but yes that’s what you gonna do.</p><p>pick your favorite spot, the one you feel very good to be at, and can spend a whole day by yourself.</p><p>can’t give you advice on picking a spot just make sure that wherever you are going has deep significance for yourself.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank"

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p>I stayed in a hotel recently, which means I watched cable television, which means I consumed commercials that I could not skip—and some of these commercials advertised upcoming movie releases. Promo after promo, I noticed an unmistakable pattern: every film was "Certified Fresh" on Rotten Tomatoes, with this seal of approval serving as the ad's climactic selling point.</p><p>After five days of "Certified Fresh" movie propaganda, I began to grow suspicious. If every movie is un-rotten, then one of two things must be true:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Humanity Has Stopped Producing Bad Art: </strong><span>After a century of trial and error, mankind has perfected the art of cinema, as proven by recent masterworks like </span><em>Cats, Space Jam: A New Legacy</em><span>, the live-action </span><em>Snow White</em><span>, </span><em>Red One</em><span>, and </span><em>Joker: Folie à Deux</em><span>. Critics, who were once joyless automatons thriving on takedowns of human creativity, now bask in this golden age of moviemaking, lavishing praise upon the timeless artistry of The Walt Disney Company and Warner Bros. Discovery.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Rotten Tomatoes Has Changed:</strong><span> Perhaps this seemingly objective platform has been compromised, potentially by corporate interests 🙉. If this reads as conspiratorial, that's because it is (albeit a decidedly low-stakes conspiracy).</span></p></li></ol><p><span>After delving into the data, this "</span><em>conspiracy</em><span>" seems more like "</span><em>fact</em><span>" (which makes for a rather boring conspiracy theory).</span></p><p>So today, we'll delve into the suspicious recalibration of Rotten Tomatoes, tracing when and how Hollywood's foremost stamp of artistic excellence turned rotten.</p><p>Rotten Tomatoes was founded in 1998 to aggregate reviews of Jackie Chan films. Within months, its creators recognized the concept's broader potential and expanded the platform to cover all movies. The website quickly became a trusted proxy for critical consensus, a role it has maintained for over 25 years.</p><p>Rotten Tomatoes appraises movies through its trademarked "Tomatometer" score, calculated as the percentage of critic reviews that are deemed "positive." Both a lukewarm 3-out-of-5 star rating and an effusive rave of cinematic brilliance qualify as "positive" on the platform. Films with a Tomatometer score above 60% receive a "fresh" label; anything below this threshold is branded "rotten."</p><p><span>While many nitpick Rotten Tomatoes' blunt approach to aggregation, much of the site's appeal lies in its straightforward methodology. According to polling from The Morning Consult, </span><a href="https://pro.morningconsult.com/articles/america-can-stomach-rotten-tomatoes" rel="">nearly a third of Americans have checked the Tomatometer before seeing a film</a><span>, making Rotten Tomatoes Hollywood's most influential tastemaker by a significant margin. The site is performatively transparent, which contributes to its perceived integrity and broad consumer trust, while also making its underlying mechanics readily auditable. </span></p><p>In a well-calibrated system, critic scores should remain stable over time unless there's a meaningful shift in film quality. So why has the average Tomatometer score increased over the past decade? What changed: the movies or the metric?</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SppS!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37977b00-a0ca-49a6-a2d8-17cff7b17e65_1588x1226.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SppS!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37977b00-a0ca-49a6-a2d8-17cff7b17e65_1588x1226.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SppS!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37977b00-a0ca-49a6-a2d8-17cff7b17e65_1588x1226.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SppS!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37977b00-a0ca-49a6-a2d8-17cff7b17e65_1588x1226.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SppS!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37977b00-a0ca-49a6-a2d8-17cff7b17e65_1588x1226.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SppS!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37977b00-a0ca-49a6-a2d8-17cff7b17e65_1588x1226.png" width="1456" height="1124" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/37977b00-a0ca-49a6-a2d8-17cff7b17e65_1588x1226.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1124,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:166263,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.statsignificant.com/i/171297626?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37977b00-a0ca-49a6-a2d8-17cff7b17e65_1588x1226.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SppS!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37977b00-a0ca-49a6-a2d8-17cff7b17e65_1588x1226.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SppS!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37977b00-a0ca-49a6-a2d8-17cff7b17e65_1588x1226.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SppS!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37977b00-a0ca-49a6-a2d8-17cff7b17e65_1588x1226.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SppS!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37977b00-a0ca-49a6-a2d8-17cff7b17e65_1588x1226.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>And here is where the intrigue deepens: this rating shift coincides with Fandango's 2016 acquisition of Rotten Tomatoes 🙉. One might consider this a conflict of interest, given Fandango is America's largest movie-ticketing platform, partially owned by NBCUniversal and Warner Bros. Discovery (and that person would be correct!).</p><p>If I had a corkboard for tracking this conspiracy theory, it would be incredibly lame: I'd have a picture of Rotten Tomatoes and a photo of Fandango, with a single spool of yarn connecting the two. This does not "go all the way to the top," and there is probably no mention of these dealings in The Epstein Files.</p><p>While these two data points paint an unflattering portrait of Rotten Tomatoes, they do not prove whether the site's aggregation process or scoring methods have fundamentally changed. To test this, I decided to look at the relationship between Rotten Tomatoes' critic score and its user-generated audience score (the latter aggregates reviews from moviegoers who have seen a film).</p><p>While critics and audiences don't always agree, their sentiments tend to be strongly correlated—a wave of critical pans usually signals similar disdain from viewers, and vice-versa. Before 2016, a higher audience score generally went hand in hand with a strong Tomatometer rating.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank"

However, this label has no special bearing on a film's top-line Tomatometer score and is largely incorporated into ancillary aspects of the site. Rotten Tomatoes claims that these reviewer additions were made to diversify its critic pool by including more women, people of color, and underrepresented groups—a statement I can neither confirm nor deny. What I can say is this: these new reviewers fundamentally altered the site's steady state, and the platform did little to account for this underlying shift. Maybe increased critic scores are a happy accident, albeit one with extremely suspicious timing.</p><p><span>Furthermore, this emerging class of lesser-known Tomatometer-approved critics has become a strategic asset for Hollywood studios. According to a 2023 Vulture analysis, </span><a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/rotten-tomatoes-movie-rating.html" rel="">PR firms will actively court reviewers from smaller outlets to inflate Tomatometer scores</a><span> in the run-up to a film's release. Apparently, a cottage industry has emerged around recruiting non-Top Critics to secure a "fresh" label pre-release, which studios can then brandish as a marketing hook.</span></p><p>I don't have any hard data to verify Vulture's claims, but one could see how an expanded pool of Tomatometer-approved hobbyists might be ripe for manipulation. With the right mix of critics, a "fresh" rating can be engineered to coincide with a film's opening weekend.</p><p><span>You'd think after spending a few hours deconstructing the Tomatometer that I'd be firmly against the site's alleged-but-also-somewhat-obvious review inflation. Yet my immediate lizard-brain reaction was strangely pro-inflation, surprising even me: </span><em>maybe Rotten Tomatoes being (ostensibly) rigged isn't such a bad thing? </em><span>I'm not proud of this knee-jerk response, so much as it speaks to the state of movies in 2025.</span></p><p><span>In the aftermath of the pandemic, box office coverage frames every weekend as a referendum on the film industry's continued existence. Will Marvel return to form? If not, does that mean cinema is dead? Can A24 single-handedly save indie film? If not, does that mean cinema is dead? Every week, movies are either "so over" or "so back," and it's exhausting. If you love moviegoing and the theatrical experience, you want nothing more than for people to stop watching </span><em>Love Is Blind Brazil</em><span>, leave their houses, and go to the movies.</span></p><p>Enter Rotten Tomatoes, a debatably flawed yet widely influential website that is a questionable proxy for critical acclaim. For whatever reason, people trust this platform and will decide to leave their homes based on its recommendation. Rotten Tomatoes is the focal point of television promos because it can create demand where it previously did not exist.</p><p>If I were the owner of a movie-ticketing app or a sicko-utilitarian like Sam Bankman-Fried, I'd argue the ends justify the means: the average score goes up, more movies are deemed "fresh," people go to theaters, and cinema lives to fight another day. Unfortunately, I am not a sicko-utilitarian, which means I am now advocating against my best interests. Hooray for me.</p><p>In the short term, inflated scores may lure people to theaters once or twice. But in the long run, it's better if people enjoy their experience at the theater (by, you know, seeing a good movie). Despite my lizard-brain reaction, I believe long-term thinking usually wins out, while short-term shenanigans are always rotten in hindsight. Although what was once deemed "rotten" is now considered "certifiably fresh," so who knows.</p><div data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.statsignificant.com/p/is-rotten-tomatoes-still-reliable?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;}" data-component-name="CaptionedButtonToDOM"><p><em>This post is public so feel free to share it.</em></p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.statsignificant.com/p/is-rotten-tomatoes-still-reliable?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://www.statsignificant.com/p/is-rotten-tomatoes-still-reliable?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p></div><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fUDG!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b328782-2a8f-4ee5-b834-808053d7e5b7_716x700.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fUDG!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b328782-2a8f-4ee5-b834-808053d7e5b7_716x700.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fUDG!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b328782-2a8f-4ee5-b834-808053d7e5b7_716x700.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fUDG!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b328782-2a8f-4ee5-b834-808053d7e5b7_716x700.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fUDG!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b328782-2a8f-4ee5-b834-808053d7e5b7_716x700.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fUDG!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b328782-2a8f-4ee5-b834-808053d7e5b7_716x700.png" width="144" height="140.78212290502793" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9b328782-2a8f-4ee5-b834-808053d7e5b7_716x700.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:700,&quot;width&quot;:716,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:144,&quot;bytes&quot;:856992,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fUDG!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b328782-2a8f-4ee5-b834-808053d7e5b7_716x700.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fUDG!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b328782-2a8f-4ee5-b834-808053d7e5b7_716x700.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fUDG!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b328782-2a8f-4ee5-b834-808053d7e5b7_716x700.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fUDG!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b328782-2a8f-4ee5-b834-808053d7e5b7_716x700.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Struggling to turn your data into actionable insights?

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="blogpost">
  
  
  <div><p>Slightly unusual genre today: a <a href="https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/3129">negative
result</a> about our <a href="https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2732"><code>git-review</code></a>
tool for a different take on code review process, which we decided to
shelve, at least for the time being.</p>
<p>A lot of people are unsatisfied with GitHub’s code review process.
One of the primary issues is that GitHub poorly supports stacked pull
requests and <a href="https://gist.github.com/thoughtpolice/9c45287550a56b2047c6311fbadebed2">interdiff
reviews</a>. While I also see interdiff as valuable, it’s not the reason
why I decided to experiment with <code>git-review</code>. I have two
other problems with GitHub, and with every single other code review
system, with the exception of <a href="https://www.janestreet.com/tech-talks/janestreet-code-review/">the
thing that Jane Street uses internally</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>review state is not stored as a part of repository itself,</li>
<li>review is done via remote-first web-interface.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="optimal-workflow"></h2>
<p>Let’s start with the second one.</p>
<p>By the way of analogy, I don’t use GitHub’s web editor to write code.
I clone a repository locally, and work in my editor, which is:</p>
<ul>
<li>fully local, memory/nvme latencies, no HTTP round-trips,</li>
<li>tailored to my specific odd workflow.</li>
</ul>
<p>When I review code, I like to pull the source branch locally. Then I
soft-reset the code to mere base, so that the code looks as if it was
written by me. Then I fire up magit, which allows me to effectively
navigate both through the diff, and through the actual code. And I even
use git staging area to mark files I’ve already reviewed:</p>
<p><img src="https://tigerbeetle.com/blog/2025-08-04-code-review-can-be-better/magit-review.webp" alt="code review in magit"></p>
<p>Reviewing <em>code</em> rather than diff is so powerful: I can run
the tests, I can go to definition to get the context, I can try out my
refactoring suggestions in-place, with code completion and the other
affordances of my highly sophisticated code editor.</p>
<p>Alas, when I want to actually leave feedback on the PR, I have to
open the browser, navigate to the relevant line in the diff, and (after
waiting for several HTTP round-trips) type my suggestion into a text
area. For some reason, the text area also regularly lags for me,
especially on larger diffs.</p>
<p>Two things are wrong here. On the interface side, review feedback is
text related to the code. The most natural interface is to just leave
review comments as inline comments in the code, or even to fix the code
directly:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><span>// CR(matklad): Hm, this check seems imprecise to me.</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2"><span>// Shouldn't we compare `replica.view` instead of `header.view` here?</span></span>
<span id="cb1-3"><span>if</span> (header<span>.</span>view <span>!=</span> view) <span>return</span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And on the implementation side, because the data is stored in a
remote database, rather than in a local git repository, we get all those
latency-inducing round-trips (not to mention vendor lock in).</p>
<p>Thus, <a href="https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2732"><code>git-review</code></a>
was born. The idea is simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>Code review is a single commit which sits on top of the PR
branch.</li>
<li>That commit adds a bunch of code comments with specific
markers.</li>
<li>Review process involves both the author and the reviewer modifying
this top commit (so, there’s a fair amount of
<code>git push --force-with-lease</code> involved).</li>
<li>The review concludes when all threads were marked as
<code>//? resolved</code> and an explicit revert commit is added on top
(such that review is preserved in the history).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-devil-in-the-detail"></h2>
<p>It didn’t exactly fail, but wasn’t a spectacular success. When it
comes to writing tools, I am a huge fan of getting-rich-quick schemes,
of writing 500 lines of <a href="https://matklad.github.io/2024/02/10/window-live-constant-time-grep.html">hacky,
use-case specific code</a> which works better for <em>that</em> use-case
than <a href="https://burntsushi.net/ripgrep/">something serious</a>. A
simple script for converting <em>your</em> <code>.md</code> to
<code>.html</code> <a href="https://tigerbeetle.com/blog/2025-02-27-why-we-designed-tigerbeetles-docs-from-scratch/">can
be cheaper to maintain</a> than a general purpose solution.</p>
<p>I had a hope that “code review is just a commit” would be the secret
to keep implementation complexity low. Sadly, the devil is in the
details in this particular case.</p>
<p>The basic idea, that reviewing is leaving comments in code, works as
well as I had expected (that is, it’s really, really awesome). But
modifying code under review turned out to be tricky. If a reviewer
requests a change, and you apply it to some deep commit, or even add a
new commit on top, you now have to solve mere conflicts with the review
comments themselves, as they are often added at the <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Interactive-Staging">hunk</a>
boundaries. And then, while <code>--force-with-lease</code> is workable,
it also adds friction. There is an impedance mismatch here, where, for
code, we want very strong, hash-chained intentional sequence of
state-transitions, while for review we would be more happy with more lax
conflict-free merging rules. It <em>might</em> be solved with more
tooling to “push” and “pop” review comments on top of pristine review
branch, but that seems to push well beyond my 500 line limit.</p>
<p>Then, there’s a second change. It seems like <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/git/CAESOdVAspxUJKGAA58i0tvks4ZOfoGf1Aa5gPr0FXzdcywqUUw@mail.gmail.com/T/#u">upstream
git might be getting a Gerrit-style Change-Id</a> for tracking revisions
of a single commit over rebases. If that happens, we might actually get
first class support for per-commit interdiff review! But that would be
somewhat incompatible with <code>git-review</code> approach, which adds
an entire separate commit to the branch. But, perhaps, in the
<code>Change-Id</code> world, we could be adding review comments to the
commits themselves, and, rather that adding a revert at the conclusion
of review, instruct git to store all revisions of a particular
<code>Change-Id</code>.</p>
<p>Anyway, we are begrudgingly back to web-interface based code reviews
for now. Hopefully someone is inspired enough to fix this properly one
day!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><em>All the opinions expressed in this article and on this website are entirely my own and do not represent my employer in any way.</em></p>



<hr>



<p>Ever heard about the “Bus factor”? It is a concept that measures the risk of losing all knowledge about a particular thing – a software development project for example – by estimating how many team members could get crushed by a bus before nobody knows how to work on the project anymore. As an example, if 3 people on your team know how to restore a backup of your database, the Bus Factor for that particular function in 3.</p>



<h2>From one to zero</h2>



<p>Since the dawn of humanity, even long before buses existed, the Bus Factor has always had a “worst case” value of 1. If the sole keeper of a piece of knowledge came to pass, the knowledge was lost, unless it had been transferred previously.</p>



<p>And humanity has worked hard to keep itself far from this Bus Factor of 1. Brown-bag sessions, documentation, video tutorials, knowledge handovers, demos and showcases, without forgetting <em>schools</em>, and many more mechanisms in which an uncountable number of man-hours has been sunk.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="832" height="336" src="https://www.mindflash.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/c07fb8c4-dd67-4388-8c6c-df38ce04bce0.jpg" alt="Cavemen holding a knowledge sharing session to increase their bus factor" srcset="https://www.mindflash.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/c07fb8c4-dd67-4388-8c6c-df38ce04bce0.jpg 832w, https://www.mindflash.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/c07fb8c4-dd67-4388-8c6c-df38ce04bce0-300x121.jpg 300w, https://www.mindflash.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/c07fb8c4-dd67-4388-8c6c-df38ce04bce0-768x310.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 832px) 100vw, 832px"></figure>



<p>But on the 30th of November 2022, all of this changed, and suddenly a large part of humanity became perfectly fine with a Bus Factor not just of 1, but of <strong>zero</strong>.</p>



<h2>AI first, humans nowhere</h2>



<p>That date corresponds to the release of ChatGPT to the public, and the start of the mass-market adoption of GenAI. It’s also the birth of what would become 3 years later the concept of “AI first”.</p>



<p>One might think that “AI first” would leave humans second, but, unsurprisingly, delegating the creation process to machines has instead left us nowhere to be found when it comes to knowledge keeping.</p>



<p>Focusing a bit on programming, it seems like a growing part of the industry is now happy to let LLMs generate functions, entire features, or even complete projects (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44157131" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">security holes included</a>). They have moved on from understanding their code-base and preserving this knowledge to actively trying to avoid having any piece of knowledge about their project to begin with, preferring instead to “vibe”.</p>



<h2>Where the bus hits a wall</h2>



<p>We can leave aside the flaws of vibe-coding and the issues with LLM-generated code in general for another article. Indeed, the quality of the generated code does not really matter here. It is obviously easier to understand code that you have never seen before if it is good code, but ultimately reading code remains much more complex than writing it no matter what.</p>



<p>Before LLMs, provided that your team did some of their due diligence, you could always expect to have some help when tackling new code-bases. Either a mentor, or at least some (even if maybe partially outdated) documentation. With LLMs, this is gone. The only thing you can rely on is on your ability to decipher what a highly imperfect system generated, and maybe ask explanations to that same imperfect system about <s>your code</s> its code (oh, and it has forgotten everything about the initial writing process by then).</p>



<p>Imagine having to solve bugs, add new features, patch security holes and upgrade dependencies in a piece of software that nobody on Earth has even the faintest idea about how it was built and why it was built that way.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="832" height="336" src="https://www.mindflash.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/c07fb8c4-dd67-4388-8c6c-df38ce04bce0-1.jpg" alt="a programmer looking confused at hieroglyphs on his computer" srcset="https://www.mindflash.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/c07fb8c4-dd67-4388-8c6c-df38ce04bce0-1.jpg 832w, https://www.mindflash.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/c07fb8c4-dd67-4388-8c6c-df38ce04bce0-1-300x121.jpg 300w, https://www.mindflash.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/c07fb8c4-dd67-4388-8c6c-df38ce04bce0-1-768x310.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 832px) 100vw, 832px"></figure>



<p>Now, imagine being the user uploading personal documents, credit card information, private photos or thoughts to a piece  of software that nobody on Earth has even the faintest idea about how it was built and why it was built that way.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Because of the situation of a Bus Factor of zero that it creates, vibe coding is fundamentally flawed. That is, only until there is an AI that can generate 100% accurate code 100% of the time, and it is fed 100% accurate prompts.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Some time ago I&nbsp;wrote a long blog post I&nbsp;called “<a href="https://mackuba.eu/2024/02/21/bluesky-guide/">Complete guide to Bluesky</a>”, which explains how all the user-facing features of Bluesky work and various tips and tricks. This one is meant to be a bit like a developer version of that – I&nbsp;want to explain in hopefully understandable language what all the pieces of the network architecture are and how they all fit together. I&nbsp;hope this will let you understand better how Bluesky and the underlying protocol works, and how it differs from e.g. the Fediverse. This should also be a good starting point if you want to start building some apps or tools on ATProto.</p>

<p>This post is a first part of a series – next I&nbsp;want to look at some comparisons with the Fediverse and some common misconceptions that people have, and look at the state of decentralization of this network, but that was way too much for one post; so this one focuses on the “ATProto intro tutorial” part.</p>

<p>But before we start, a little philosophical aside:</p>


<h2>What is “Bluesky”? Which “Bluesky” are we talking about?</h2>

<p>Discussions about Bluesky sometimes get a little confusing because… “Bluesky” could mean a few different things. Language is hard.</p>

<p>First, we have Bluesky the company, the team. Usually, when people want to clarify that they’re talking about the group of people or the organization, they say “Bluesky PBC” (PBC = Public Benefit Corporation), or “Bluesky team”.</p>

<p>(If you want to read a bit about where Bluesky came from and what’s the current state of the company, read <a href="https://mackuba.eu/2024/02/21/bluesky-guide/#what-is-bluesky">these two sections</a> in the Bluesky Guide blog post.)</p>

<p>And we also have Bluesky the product, the social network, the thing that they’ve built. This network is not a single black box like Twitter or Facebook are (despite what they say about it on Mastodon), it’s more like a set of separate and actually very transparent boxes.</p>

<p>The system they’ve built, of which Bluesky was initially meant to be just a tech demo, is called the <strong>Authenticated Transfer Protocol</strong>, or AT Protocol, or ATProto. Bluesky is built on ATProto, and it is in practice a huge part of what ATProto currently is, which makes the boundary between Bluesky and non-Bluesky a bit hard to define at times, but it’s still only a subset of it.</p>

<p>Bluesky in this second meaning is some nebulous thing that consists of: the data types (“<a href="#lexicons">lexicons</a>”) that are specific to the Bluesky microblogging aspect of ATProto, like Bluesky posts or follows; the APIs for handling them and for accessing other Bluesky-specific features; the rules according to which they all work together; and the whole “social layer” that is created out of all of this, the virtual “place” – the thing that people have in mind when they say “this website”, even when it’s accessed through a mobile app. One of the coolest things about Bluesky &amp; ATProto, in my opinion, is that it connects many different independent pieces into something that still feels like one shared virtual space.</p>

<p>People outside the company can create (and are creating) other such things on ATProto that aren’t necessarily Bluesky-related – see e.g. <a href="https://whtwnd.com/">WhiteWind</a> or <a href="https://leaflet.pub/">Leaflet</a> (blogging platforms), <a href="https://tangled.sh/">Tangled</a> (GitHub alternative), <a href="https://frontpage.fyi/">Frontpage</a> (Hacker News style link aggregator), or <a href="https://grain.social/">Grain</a> (photo sharing site). They use the same underlying mechanisms that are at the base of ATProto, but use separate data types, have different rules, goals, and UIs. How do we call these things as a whole, the different sets of “data types + rules + required servers + client apps” that define different use cases of the network?</p>

<p>Bluesky team usually calls them “apps”, but I’m not a big fan of this term, because “app” kinda implies a client app, and that’s just one small piece of it. I&nbsp;sometimes call them “services” – though it’s probably not perfect either, since it implies just the server part in turn. Suggestions welcome&nbsp;:) (I’m mentioning this at the beginning, because this is something that many different parts are related to.)</p>

<p>Personally, when I&nbsp;say “the Bluesky app”, I&nbsp;will generally mean the actual client app (mobile / webapp), not the “service”, and when I&nbsp;say “Bluesky-specific”, I&nbsp;will mean the “service”, not the company; and “Bluesky-hosted” will mean run by Bluesky the company. Hopefully in most cases, it can be guessed from context.</p>

<p>BTW, the commonly accepted term for the whole shared “multiverse” of all ATProto apps is “The&nbsp;Atmosphere”, or “ATmosphere” (though I&nbsp;much prefer the former personally, the weird capitalization bugs me somehow&nbsp;;). It was <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:bnqkww7bjxaacajzvu5gswdf/post/3k26nw6kwnh2e">coined</a> by someone from the community, but was accepted by the team and is now mentioned on the <a href="https://atproto.com/guides/glossary#atmosphere">official atproto site</a>.</p>

<hr>

<p>Let’s start with defining the various building pieces of the protocol:</p>



<h2>Records &amp; blobs</h2>

<p>The most basic piece of the ATProto world is a <strong>record</strong>. Records are basically JSON objects representing the data about a specific entity like a post or profile, organized in a specific way. A post/reply, repost, like, follow, block, list, entry on a list, user profile info – each of these is one record. Most public actions you take on Bluesky, like following someone or liking a post, are performed by creating a record of an appropriate type (or editing/deleting one created before).</p>

<p>For example, this is a <a href="https://shiitake.us-east.host.bsky.network/xrpc/com.atproto.repo.getRecord?repo=did:plc:vc7f4oafdgxsihk4cry2xpze&amp;collection=app.bsky.feed.post&amp;rkey=3ltxjiss3is2j">post record</a>. This is one of the <a href="https://lionsmane.us-east.host.bsky.network/xrpc/com.atproto.repo.getRecord?repo=did:plc:sflxm2fxohaqpfgahgdlm7rl&amp;collection=app.bsky.feed.like&amp;rkey=3luapblv3vd2i">likes of that post</a>.</p>

<p>Records are stored on disk and transferred between servers in a binary format called <a href="https://cbor.io/">CBOR</a>, although in most API&nbsp;endpoints they’re returned in a JSON form (they are equivalent, just different encodings of the same data).</p>

<p>The key thing about records, which has very real consequences for user-facing features, is that you can only create and modify <em>your own</em> records, not those owned by others (and there are no “shared” records at the moment, each record is owned by a specific account). This means that e.g. when you follow someone, you create a follow record on your account, and that other person can’t delete your record, which is why there’s currently no “soft-blocking” feature, i.e. you can’t make someone stop following you (though you can block them). There are workarounds though, as I’ll explain later in the <a href="#appview">AppView section</a>.</p>

<p>This also means that there’s often an unexpected assymetry between seemingly similar actions: for example, getting a list of people followed by person X is very simple (they’re all X’s records, so they’re all in one place), but getting a list of all followers of X is much harder (each record is in a different place!). This is something that the AppView helps with too, as we’ll see later.</p>

<p>A second, complimentary way of storing user data is <strong>blobs</strong>. Blobs are basically binary files, meant mostly for storing media like images and video. For example, here is a direct link to an <a href="https://lab.martianbase.net/xrpc/com.atproto.sync.getBlob?did=did:plc:oio4hkxaop4ao4wz2pp3f4cr&amp;cid=bafkreib7vmhsk7w36bmrlwi2mjgkkoq44xysdahi226re2a76rlmgamgvu">image blob</a> showing a photo of when I&nbsp;started writing this blog post. Blobs are stored on the same server as records, but somewhat separate from them, since it’s a different type of data.</p>



<h2>Lexicons</h2>

<p>Each record belongs to a specific “record type” and stores its data organized in a specific structure, which defines what kinds of fields it can have with what types, what they mean, which are required, and so on – kind of like XML/JSON Schema. This schema definition which describes a given record type is called a <strong>lexicon</strong> in ATProto. (If you’re curious why make a new standard, see threads e.g. <a href="https://blue.mackuba.eu/skythread/?author=did:plc:ragtjsm2j2vknwkz3zp4oxrd&amp;post=3juoxe37rez2q">here</a>, <a href="https://blue.mackuba.eu/skythread/?author=did:plc:ragtjsm2j2vknwkz3zp4oxrd&amp;post=3kjgebkayik2g">here</a>, or <a href="https://blue.mackuba.eu/skythread/?author=did:plc:ragtjsm2j2vknwkz3zp4oxrd&amp;post=3jvf7bakmm22h">here</a>, or <a href="https://www.pfrazee.com/blog/why-not-rdf">this blog post</a>).</p>

<p>A lexicon needs to have an identifier (called <strong>NSID</strong>, Namespace Identifier), which uses the reverse domain name format, e.g. <code>app.bsky.feed.post</code>. All lexicons that are used to store the data of a specific app are usually grouped under the same prefix, e.g. Bluesky lexicons all start with <code>app.bsky</code>.</p>

<p>The structure of a given lexicon’s records is defined in a special JSON file – for example, this file defines the <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto/blob/main/lexicons/app/bsky/feed/post.json">app.bsky.feed.post lexicon</a>. As you can see, this is the place which for example specifies that a post’s text can have at most 300 characters (more specifically, Unicode graphemes). This also means that you can’t create a different server which would make posts longer than 300 characters that would be Bluesky-compatible and displayed on <a href="https://bsky.app/">bsky.app</a> – such posts would not pass the validation against the post record schema, and would be rejected by any server or client which performs such validation. Essentially, whover designs and controls the given lexicon, decides what kinds of data it can hold and any constraints on it. In order to store a different, incompatible type of data, you need to create a new lexicon (although you <em>can</em> add additional fields to a record that aren’t defined in its lexicon; many third party apps are doing that, like e.g. <a href="https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy-fed/issues/1092#issuecomment-2164027121">Bridgy Fed</a>).</p>

<p>Lexicon name prefixes generally define boundaries between “apps” as in “services”, and between the “territory” that’s owned by different parties. The lexicons and endpoints defined by Bluesky are defined either under <code>app.bsky.*</code> – these are things specific to Bluesky the microblogging service – or under <code>com.atproto.*</code>, which are things meant to be used by all ATProto apps and services regardless of the use case. There are also a couple of other minor namespaces like <code>chat.bsky.*</code> for the (centralized) DM service, and <code>tools.ozone.*</code> for the open source <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/ozone/">Ozone moderation tool</a>.</p>

<p>The lexicon prefix is generally (in most cases) a good way to tell if a piece of the protocol is something Bluesky-specific (specific to the Bluesky service), or something general for all ATProto. There are no record types defined in <code>com.atproto</code>, so things like post, profile, follow are all Bluesky-specific and under <code>app.bsky</code>, as are APIs for e.g. searching users, getting timelines, custom feeds and so on. Meanwhile, <code>com.atproto</code> APIs deal more with things like: info about a repository, fetching a repository, signing up for a new account, refreshing an access token, downloading a blob, etc.</p>

<p>Third party developers and teams building apps on ATProto/Bluesky, which either extend Bluesky’s features or make something completely separate, use their own namespaces for new lexicons, like <code>blue.flashes</code>, <code>social.pinksky</code>, <code>events.smokesignal</code>, <code>sh.tangled</code>, and so on. (There is a lot of nuance to whether you should use your own lexicons or reuse or extend existing ones when building things, and there have been a lot of discussions about it on Bluesky, and even conference talks. A good starting point is <a href="https://www.pfrazee.com/blog/lexicon-guidance">this blog post</a> by Paul Frazee.)</p>



<h2>Identity</h2>

<p>Each user is uniquely identified in the network with their <strong>Decentralized Identifier (DID)</strong>. DIDs are a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-1.0/">W3C standard</a>, but (as I&nbsp;understand) this standard mostly just defines a framework, and there can be many different “methods” of storing and resolving the identifiers, and each system that uses it can pick or create different types of those DIDs.</p>

<p>The format of a DID is: <code>did:&lt;type&gt;:&lt;…&gt;</code>, where the last part depends on the method. ATProto supports two types of DIDs, but in practice, almost everyone uses one of them, the “plc”. Each DID has a “<strong>DID document</strong>”, a JSON file (<a href="https://plc.directory/did:plc:oio4hkxaop4ao4wz2pp3f4cr">see mine</a>) which describes the account – in ATProto at least, the document includes things such as: the assigned handles, the PDS server hosting the account, and some cryptographic keys.</p>

<p>An important thing to note is that <strong>DIDs are permanent</strong>; it’s the only thing that is permanent about your account, because something has to be. There needs to be some unique ID that all databases everywhere can use to identify you, which doesn’t change, and the DID is that ID. This means that you can’t change a DID of one type into another type later.</p>

<p>The main DID method is <code>did:plc</code>, where IIRC “plc” originally stood for “placeholder” (I&nbsp;think it was meant to be temporary until something better is designed), and was later kind of retconned to mean “<a href="https://github.com/did-method-plc/did-method-plc">Public Ledger of Credentials</a>” 🙃 The DIDs of this type are identified by a random string of characters, which looks like this: <code>did:plc:vc7f4oafdgxsihk4cry2xpze</code>. The DID documents of each DID are stored in a centralized service hosted at <a href="https://plc.directory/">plc.directory</a> (Bluesky wants to eventually transfer the ownership to some external non-profit), which basically keeps a key-value store mapping a DID to a JSON file. It also keeps an “<a href="https://plc.directory/did:plc:oio4hkxaop4ao4wz2pp3f4cr/log/audit">audit log</a>” of the previous versions of the document (this means that, for example, the whole history of your old handles is available and you can’t erase it!). There’s also some cryptographic stuff there which, as I&nbsp;understand it, lets anyone verify that everything in the database checks out (don’t ask me how).</p>

<p>The other, rarely used method is <code>did:web</code>. Those DIDs look like this: <code>did:web:witchcraft.systems</code>, and the DID document is stored in a specific <code>.well-known</code> path on the given hostname, in this case <a href="https://witchcraft.systems/.well-known/did.json">witchcraft.systems</a> (yes, that’s an actual TLD&nbsp;;). It does not store an audit log/history like <code>plc</code> does.</p>

<p>The reason why it’s rarely used and not recommended, is because, first, it’s more complicated to create one (though that’s a solvable problem of course, see a <a href="https://blog.smokesignal.events/posts/3lwopvsmtx22a-creating-a-did-method-web-identity-for-atprotocol">just published guide</a>); but second and more importantly, since DIDs are permanent, this means that your account is permanently bound to that domain. You need to keep it accessible and not let it expire, or you lose the account – you can’t migrate it to <code>did:web:another.site</code> at some point later. It gives you more independence, but at the cost of being tied to that domain you have, and this isn’t a tradeoff that most people are likely to want, and definitely not people who don’t understand what they’re getting into.</p>

<p>If you’re fine with that choice, you can create a <code>did:web</code> account and almost everything in Bluesky and ATProto should work exactly the same. “Almost”, because some services forget to implement that second code path, since it’s so rarely used 😉 but in that case, politely nudging the developer to fix the issue should help in most cases&nbsp;:&gt;</p>



<h4>Handles</h4>

<p>What DIDs enable is that since they act as the unique identifier, your handle doesn’t have to, like it does on the Fediverse. I&nbsp;can be <code>@mackuba.bsky.social</code> one day, <code>@mackuba.eu</code> the next day, and <code>@mackuba.martianbase.net</code> the week after. All existing connections – follows &amp; followers, my posts, likes, blocks, lists I’m on, mentions in posts, etc. all work as before, because they all reference the DID, not the handle. With mentions specifically it works kinda funny, because they use what’s called a “facets” system (see <a href="#facets">later section</a>), where the link target is specified separately from the displayed text. So you can have an old post saying “hey @mackuba.bsky.social”, where the handle in it links to my profile which is now named “@mackuba.eu”. The link still works, because it really links to the DID behind the scenes.</p>

<p>Unlike on the Fediverse, the format of handles is just a hostname, not username + hostname. You assign a whole hostname to a specific account, and if you own any domain name, that can be your username (and if you own a well known domain name, it’s strongly recommended that you do, as a form of self-verification!).</p>

<p>The handle to DID assignment is a two-way link – a DID needs to claim a given handle, and the owner of the domain needs to verify that they own that DID. On the DID side, this happens in the <code>alsoKnownAs</code> field of the DID document (<a href="https://plc.directory/did:plc:oio4hkxaop4ao4wz2pp3f4cr">see here in mine</a>). On the domain side, there are two ways of verifying a handle, depending on what’s more convenient to you: either a DNS TXT entry, or a file on a <code>.well-known</code> path.</p>

<p>You might be wondering how handles like <code>*.bsky.social</code> work – in this case, each such handle is its own domain name, and you can actually enter a domain like <a href="https://aoc.bsky.social/">aoc.bsky.social</a> into a browser and it will redirect to a Bluesky profile on <a href="https://bsky.app/">bsky.app</a>. Behind the scenes, this is normally handled by having a wildcard domain pointing to one service, which responds to HTTP requests on that <code>.well-known</code> path by returning different DIDs, depending on the domain. That’s not only a <code>bsky.social</code> thing – e.g. there’s now an open Blacksky PDS server which hands out <code>blacksky.social</code> handles, and there are even “handle services” which <em>only</em> give out handles – e.g. you can be <a href="https://swifties.social/">yourname.swifties.social</a> if you want&nbsp;;)</p>

<p>One place where handle changes break things is (some) post URLs on <a href="https://bsky.app/">bsky.app</a>. The official web client uses handles by default in permalinks, which means that if you link to a Bluesky post e.g. from a blog post and you change your handle later, that link will no longer work. You can however replace the handle after <code>/profile/</code> with the user’s DID, and the router accepts such links just fine, they just aren’t used by default. So the form you’d want to use when putting links in a blog post or article (like the one you’re reading) would be something like: <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:ragtjsm2j2vknwkz3zp4oxrd/post/3llwrsdcdvc2s">https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:ragtjsm2j2vknwkz3zp4oxrd/post/3llwrsdcdvc2s</a>.</p>



<h2>AT URIs</h2>

<p>Each record can be uniquely addressed with a specific <strong>URI</strong> with the at:// scheme. The format of the URI&nbsp;is:</p>

<pre><code>at://&lt;user_DID&gt;/&lt;lexicon_NSID&gt;/&lt;rkey&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Rkey</strong> is an identifier of a specific record instance – a usually short alphanumeric string, e.g. Bluesky post rkeys look something like <code>3larljiybf22v</code>. So a complete post URI&nbsp;might look like this: <code>at://did:plc:z72i7hdynmk6r22z27h6tvur/app.bsky.feed.post/3larljiybf22v</code>. You can look up at:// URIs in some record browser tools, e.g. <a href="https://pdsls.dev/at://did:plc:z72i7hdynmk6r22z27h6tvur/app.bsky.feed.post/3larljiybf22v">PDSls</a>.</p>

<p>AT URIs are used for all references between records – quotes, replies, likes, mute list entries, and so on. If you look at <a href="https://morel.us-east.host.bsky.network/xrpc/com.atproto.repo.getRecord?repo=did:plc:l3rouwludahu3ui3bt66mfvj&amp;collection=app.bsky.feed.like&amp;rkey=3lwctqgpttm2a">this like record</a>, for example, its <code>subject.uri</code> points to <code>at://did:plc:vwzwgnygau7ed7b7wt5ux7y2/app.bsky.feed.post/3lv2b3f5nys2n</code>, which is the URI&nbsp;of a post record you can see <a href="https://pdsls.dev/at://did:plc:vwzwgnygau7ed7b7wt5ux7y2/app.bsky.feed.post/3lv2b3f5nys2n">here</a>. Since the URIs use DIDs in the first part, handle changes don’t affect such links.</p>



<h2>User repositories</h2>

<p>All user data (records and blobs) is stored in a <strong>repository</strong> (or “repo”). The repository is identified by user’s DID, and stores:</p>

<ul>
<li>records, grouped by lexicon into so-called <strong>collections</strong></li>
<li>blobs (stored separately from records)</li>
<li>authentication data like access tokens, signing keys, hashed passwords etc.</li>
</ul>


<p>Internally, an important part of how the repo stores user records is a data structure called “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree">Merkle Search Tree</a>” – but this isn’t something that you need to understand when using the protocol, unless you’re working on a PDS/relay implementation (I&nbsp;haven’t needed to get into it so far).</p>

<p>You can download the records part of your (or anyone else’s!) repo as a bundle called a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:fkasq7xtzrmlvz46c5trkrn3/post/3lkedsoq4vs2d">CAR file</a>, a <a href="https://ipld.io/specs/transport/car/">Content Addressed Archive</a> (fun fact: the icon for the button in the Bluesky app which downloads a repo backup is the shape of a car 🚘).</p>

<p>The cool part is that a repository stores all data of the given user, from *all* lexicons. Including third party developer lexicons. This means that if someone has their account hosted on Bluesky servers, but uses third party ATProto apps like Tangled or Grain, Bluesky lets them store these apps’ records like Grain photos or Tangled pull requests on the same server where it keeps their Bluesky posts. (And yes, of course someone made a <a href="https://github.com/ziodotsh/atfile">lexicon/tool for storing arbitrary files</a> on your Bluesky PDS… and did it in Bash, because why not 🙃)</p>



<h2>XRPC</h2>

<p><strong>XRPC</strong> is the convention used for APIs in the ATProto network. The API&nbsp;endpoints use the same naming convention as lexicon NSIDs, and they have URLs with paths in the format of <code>/xrpc/&lt;nsid&gt;</code>, e.g. <code>/xrpc/app.bsky.feed.getPosts</code>. There are similar <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto/blob/main/lexicons/app/bsky/feed/getPostThread.json">lexicon definition files</a> which specify what parameters are accepted/required by an endpoint and what types of data are returned in the JSON response. PDSes, AppViews, labellers and feed generators all implement the same kind of API, although with different subsets of specific endpoints. Third party apps don’t <em>have</em> to use the same convention, but it’s generally a good idea, since it integrates better with the rest of the ecosystem.</p>



<h2>Rich text / facets</h2>

<p>This one is kinda Bluesky-specific, but it’s pretty important to understand, and I&nbsp;think you can reuse it for non-Bluesky apps too.</p>

<p>The “<strong>facets</strong>” system is something used for links and possibly rich text in future in Bluesky posts. It’s perhaps a little bit unintuitive at first, but it’s pretty neat and allows for a lot of flexibility.</p>

<p>The way you handle links, mentions, or hashtags, is that they aren’t highlighted automatically, but you need to specifically mark some range of text as a link using the facets. A facet is a marking of some range of the post text (from-to) with a specific kind of link. If you look e.g. at <a href="https://pdsls.dev/at://did:plc:257wekqxg4hyapkq6k47igmp/app.bsky.feed.post/3lnkwu24v5k2j">this post here</a>, you can see that it has a facet marking the byte range 60-67 of the post text as a hashtag “ahoy25”. If there was no facet there, it would just render as normal unlinked text “#ahoy25” in the post (when you see that, it’s an easy tell that a post was made using some custom tool that’s in early stages of development). It works the same way for mention links and normal URL links.</p>

<p>(If you’re curious why they implemented it this way, check out <a href="https://www.pfrazee.com/blog/why-facets">this blog post</a>.)</p>

<p>Note that the displayed text in the marked fragment doesn’t have to match what the facet links to; this means that you can have links that just use some shorter text for the link instead of a part of the URL, in order to fit more text in one post (although in the official app, clicking such link triggers a warning popup first). E.g. some Hacker News bots commonly use this format, see <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:7dh44snmqoa4gyzv3652gm3j/post/3lmhylb375m2a">this post</a>. The Bsky app doesn’t let you create such posts directly, but some other clients like <a href="https://skeetdeck.pages.dev/decks/3lpzuhjwlxcns">Skeetdeck</a> do.</p>

<p>Facets are also used for URL shortening – if you just put a long URL in the text of a post made through the API, it will be neither shortened nor highlighted. You need to manually mark it with a facet, and manually shorten the displayed part to whatever length you want.</p>

<p>Likely the most tricky part is that the index numbers you need to use for the ranges are counted on a UTF-8 representation of the text string, but they’re counted in… bytes and not unicode scalars, which most languages index strings in 😅 This is somewhat of an unfortunate tech debt thing as I&nbsp;understand, and it was made this way mostly because of JavaScript, which doesn’t work with UTF-8 natively. But this means you need to be extra careful with the indexes in most languages.</p>

<hr>

<p>Ok, now that we got through the basic pieces, let’s talk about servers:</p>



<h2>PDS</h2>

<p>The original copy of all user data is stored on a server called <strong>PDS</strong>, Personal Data Server. This is the “source of truth”. A PDS stores one or more user accounts and repos, handles user authentication, and serves as an “entry point” to the network when connecting from a client app. Most network requests from the client are sent to your PDS, although only some of them are handled directly by the PDS, and the rest are proxied e.g. to the AppView. So in a way, your PDS kind of serves as your “user agent” in the network on the backend side of things (beyond the client app), especially if it’s under your control.</p>

<p>Each PDS has an XRPC API&nbsp;with some number of endpoints for things like listing repositories, listing contents of each, looking up a specific record or blob, account authentication and management, and so on. It also has a websocket API&nbsp;called a “<strong>firehose</strong>” (the <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto/blob/main/lexicons/com/atproto/sync/subscribeRepos.json">subscribeRepos endpoint</a>). The firehose streams all changes happening on a given PDS (from all repos) as a stream of “events”, where each event is an addition, edit, or deletion of a record in one of the repos, or some change related to an account, like handle change or deactivation.</p>

<p>One of the most important features of ATProto is that <strong>an account is not permanently assigned to a PDS</strong>. Unlike in ActivityPub, where your identifier is e.g. <code>mackuba@mastodon.social</code> and it can never change, because everything uses that as the unique ID, here the unique ID is the DID. The PDS host is assigned to a user in the DID document JSON (e.g. on <a href="https://plc.directory/">plc.directory</a>), but you can migrate to a different PDS at any point, and at the moment there are even some fairly user-friendly tools available for doing that, like <a href="https://atpairport.com/">ATP Airport</a> or <a href="https://pdsmoover.com/">PDS MOOver</a> (although it’s still a bit unpolished at the moment, and for now you can’t migrate back to Bluesky-hosted PDSes). In theory, you should even be able to migrate to a different PDS if your old PDS is dead or goes rogue, if you have prepared in advance (<a href="https://www.da.vidbuchanan.co.uk/blog/adversarial-pds-migration.html">this is a bit more technical</a>). If everything goes well, nobody even notices that anything has changed (you can’t even easily check in the app what PDS someone is on, although there are external tools for that, like <a href="https://internect.info/">internect.info</a>).</p>

<p>Initially, during the limited beta in 2023, Bluesky only had one PDS, <code>bsky.social</code>. In November 2023, several additional PDSes were created (also under Bluesky PBC control) and existing users were quietly all spread to a random one of those. At that point, the network was already “technically federated”, operating in the target architecture, although with access restricted to only Bluesky-run servers. This restriction was lifted in February 2024 with the <a href="https://docs.bsky.app/blog/self-host-federation">public federation launch</a>.</p>

<p>Since then, ATProto enthusiasts started setting setting up PDS servers for themselves, either creating alt/test accounts there, or moving their main accounts. As of August 2025, there around 2000 third party PDS servers, although most of them are very small – usually hosting one person’s main and/or test accounts, and maybe those of a couple of their friends. I&nbsp;have <a href="https://blue.mackuba.eu/directory/pdses">a list of them</a> on my website, and there’s also a more complete list <a href="https://github.com/mary-ext/atproto-scraping">here</a> (mine excludes inactive PDSes and empty accounts).</p>

<p>As you can see there, there’s one massive PDS for <a href="https://fed.brid.gy/">Bridgy Fed</a>, the Bluesky-Mastodon bridge service, hosting around 30-40k bridged accounts from the Fediverse, Threads, Nostr, Flipboard, or the web (blogs); then some number of small to medium PDSes for various services, and a very long tail of servers with single-digit number of accounts. At this moment, large public PDS in the style of Fedi instances aren’t much of a thing yet, although there are at least a few communities working on setting up one (e.g. <a href="https://www.blackskyweb.xyz/">Blacksky</a>, <a href="https://northskysocial.com/">Northsky</a>, or <a href="https://turtleisland.blog/2025/04/28/turtle-island-bluesky-pds/">Turtle Island</a>). Blacksky specifically has <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:w4xbfzo7kqfes5zb7r6qv3rw/post/3lvtlqoef5c2z">opened up for migrations</a> just last week and has now a few hundred real accounts.</p>

<p>The vast majority of PDSes at the moment use the <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/pds">reference implementation from Bluesky</a> (written in TypeScript), but there are a few alternative implementations at various levels of maturity (Blacksky’s Rudy Fraser’s <a href="https://github.com/blacksky-algorithms/rsky/tree/main/rsky-pds">rsky</a> written in Rust, <a href="https://github.com/haileyok/cocoon">cocoon</a> in Go, or <a href="https://github.com/DavidBuchanan314/millipds">millipds</a> in Python). The official version is very easy to set up and very cheap to run – it’s bundled in Docker, and there’s basically one script you need to run and answer a few questions.</p>

<p>As for the Bluesky-hosted PDSes, the number is currently in high double digits, and each of them hosts a few hundred thousands of accounts (!). And what’s more, they keep the record data in SQLite databases, one per account. And it works really well, go figure. The Bluesky PDSes are all given names of different kinds of mushrooms (like Amanita, Boletus or Shiitake), hence they are often called “mushroom servers”; you can see the full list e.g. <a href="https://status.bsky.app/">here</a>. <code>bsky.social</code> was left as a so-called “<strong>entryway server</strong>”, which handles shared authentication for all Bluesky-hosted PDSes (it’s a private piece of Bluesky PBC infrastructure that’s not open source and not needed for independent PDS hosters).</p>



<h2>Relay</h2>

<p>A <strong>relay</strong> is probably the piece of the ATProto architecture that’s most commonly misunderstood by people familiar with other networks like the Fediverse. It doesn’t help that both the Fediverse and Nostr also include servers called “relays”, but they serve a different purpose in each of them:</p>

<ul>
<li>a relay in Nostr is a core piece of the architecture: your posts are uploaded to one or more relays that you have configured and are hosted there, where other users can fetch them from</li>
<li>a relay in the Fediverse is an optional helper service that redistributes posts from some number of instances who have opted in to others, in order to make content more discoverable e.g. on hashtag feeds</li>
</ul>


<p>In ATProto, a relay is a server which combines the firehose streams from all PDSes it knows about into one massive stream that includes every change happening anywhere on the network. Such full-network firehose is then used as the input for many other services, like AppViews, labellers, or feed generators. It serves as a convenient streaming API&nbsp;to get e.g. all posts on the network to process them somehow, or all changes to accounts, or all content in general, from a single place.</p>

<p>Initially, the relay was also expected to keep a complete archive of all the data on the network, from all repos, from the beginning of time. This requirement was later removed in the updates late last year, at least partially triggered by the drastic increase in traffic in November 2024, which overwhelmed Bluesky’s and third party servers for at least a few days. Currently, Bluesky’s and other relays are generally “non-archival”, meaning that they live stream current events (+ a buffer of e.g. last 24 or 36 hours), but don’t keep a full archive of all repos (this change has <a href="https://whtwnd.com/bnewbold.net/3lo7a2a4qxg2l">massive lowered the resource requirements</a> / cost of running a relay, making it much more accessible). An archival relay could always be set up too, but I’m not aware of any currently operating.</p>

<p>Bluesky operates one main relay at <a href="https://bsky.network/">bsky.network</a>, which is used as a data source for their AppView and pretty much everyone else in the ATProto ecosystem at the moment (internally, it’s really some kind of “load balancer” using the <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/indigo/tree/main/cmd/rainbow">rainbow</a> service, with a few real relay servers behind it).</p>

<p>The relay code is <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/indigo/">implemented in Go</a>, and isn’t very hard to get up and running (especially the recent “1.1” update improved things quite a lot). Some people have been running alternative relay services privately for some time, and there is now e.g. a public relay run by Rudy Fraser at <a href="https://atproto.africa/">atproto.africa</a> (with a custom implementation in Rust! 🦀), and a couple run by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:hdhoaan3xa3jiuq4fg4mefid/post/3ltkh6bdo4ki5">Phil @bad-example.com</a>. I’m also running <a href="https://relay.feeds.blue/">my own small relay</a>, feeding content only from non-Bluesky PDSes.</p>



<h4>Jetstream</h4>

<p>There is also a variant of a relay called <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/jetstream">Jetstream</a> – it’s a service that reads from a real CBOR relay and outputs a stream that’s JSON based, better organized, and much more lightweight (the full relay includes a lot of additional data that’s mostly used for cryptographic operations and other low-level stuff). For many simpler tools and services, it might make more sense to stream data from that one instead, if only to save bandwidth. (Bluesky runs a couple of instances listed there in the readme, but you can also run your own.)</p>



<h2>AppView</h2>

<p>The terribly named <strong>AppView</strong> is the second most important piece of the network after the PDS.</p>

<p>The AppView is basically an API&nbsp;server that serves processed data to client apps. It’s an equivalent of an API&nbsp;backend (with the databases behind it) that you’d find on a classic social media site like Twitter. AppView streams all new data written on the network from the relay, and saves a copy of it locally in a processed, aggregated and optimized form. For example, an AppView backed by an SQL database could have a <code>posts</code> table with a <code>text</code> column, a <code>likes</code> table storing all likes with a foreign key <code>post_id</code>, probably also an integer <code>likes_count</code> column in <code>posts</code> for optimization, and so on.</p>

<p>The AppView is designed to be able to easily give information such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>the latest posts from this user</li>
<li>all the replies in a given thread organized in a tree</li>
<li>most recent posts on the network with the hashtag #rubylang or mentioning “iOS 26”</li>
<li>how many likes/reposts has a given post received, and who made them</li>
<li>how many follows/followers does a given user have, and who are they</li>
<li>is user A allowed to view or reply to a post from user B</li>
</ul>


<p>All this data originates from users’ PDSes and has its original copy stored there, but the “raw” record don’t always allow you to access all information easily. For example, to find out how many likes a post has, you need to know all <code>app.bsky.feed.like</code> records referencing it from other users, and each of those like records is stored in the liking user’s repo on that user’s PDS. Same with followers, as I&nbsp;mentioned earlier in the section on records, or with building threads (again, different replies in one thread are hosted in different repos), or for basically any kind of search. So having this kind of API&nbsp;with processed data from the entire network is essential for client apps and various tools and services built around Bluesky by other people.</p>

<p>AppView also applies some additional rules to the data, sometimes overriding what people post into their PDSes, since anyone can technically post anything into their PDS. For example, the AppView prevents you from looking at the profiles of people who have blocked you, at least when you’re logged in. It also hides them from your followers list, even if they have a <code>follow</code> record referencing you, making it seem like they don’t; and if they try to make an <code>app.bsky.feed.post</code> replying to you (they <em>can</em> create such record on their PDS!), it excludes such reply from feeds and threads, as if it never happened. Same goes for “thread gates” which lock access to threads, and so on.</p>

<p>The AppView is one of the few components which <em>aren’t</em> completely open source. Initially, the AppView used Postgres as its data store; <em>that</em> version is still in the public repository. In late 2023, Bluesky has migrated to a “v2” version, which uses the NoSQL database <a href="https://www.scylladb.com/">ScyllaDB</a> instead, to be able to handle the massive read traffic from many millions of concurrent users. The upper layer with the “business logic” is kept in the <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto/tree/main/packages/bsky">public repository</a>, while the so called “dataplane” layer that interacts directly with Scylla is not. The reason is mostly that it’s built for a specific hardware setup they have and wouldn’t be directly usable by others, while it would add some unnecesary work for the team to publish it. It’s still possible to run the AppView with the <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto/tree/main/packages/bsky/src/data-plane">old Postgres-based data layer</a> (and I&nbsp;think the team uses that internally for development), it just can’t handle as much traffic as the current live version.</p>

<p>This is the piece that’s hardest to run yourself, and one that requires the most resources. That said, a private AppView should be possible to run right now for <a href="https://whtwnd.com/futur.blue/3ls7sbvpsqc2w">under $200/month</a> – the biggest requirement is at least a few TB of disk space. The truly costly part is not collecting and storing all this data, but serving it to a huge number of users who would use it as a backend for the client app in daily use. An alternative full-network Bluesky AppView that is used by a few thousands of users shouldn’t be very hard to run, but to be able to serve millions, you’ll need a lot of hardware and something more custom than the Postgres-based version.</p>

<p>There have also been some attempts at alternative implementations – the most advanced right now is <a href="https://github.com/alnkesq/AppViewLite">AppViewLite</a>, built in C#, which goes to great lengths to minimize the resource use.</p>



<h4>CDN</h4>

<p>A part of the AppView (at least the Bluesky one) is also a CDN for serving images &amp; videos. The API&nbsp;responses from e.g. <code>getTimeline</code> or <code>getPostThread</code> generally include links to any media on the Bluesky CDN hostname, not directly on the PDS, even though you <em>can</em> fetch every blob from the PDS, since that’s the “source of truth” (although IIRC the Bluesky PDS implementation doesn’t set the CORS headers there). It’s recommended to access any media this way in order to not use too much bandwidth from the PDS.</p>



<h2>Labellers</h2>

<p>(Or “labelers” officially, but I&nbsp;like the British spelling more here, sue me ¯\_(ツ)_/¯)</p>

<p>We’re now getting to more Bluesky specific things (i.e. specific for the Bluesky-service, although some parts of it are ATProto-general and mentioned on the <a href="https://atproto.com/specs/label">atproto.com site</a>).</p>

<p>A <strong>labeller</strong> is a moderation service for Bluesky (or other ATProto app), which can be run by third parties. Labellers emit labels, which are assigned to an account or a record (like a post). Each labeller defines its own set of labels, depending on what it’s focusing on; then, users can “subscribe” to a labeller and choose how they want to handle the labels it assigns: you can hide the labelled posts/users, mark them with a warning badge, or ignore given label.</p>

<p>Labellers were initially designed to just do community moderation of unwanted content, e.g. you can have a service focused on fighting racism, transphobia, or right-wing extremism, and that service helps protect its users from some kinds of bad actors; or you can have one marking e.g. posts with political content, users who follow 20k accounts, or who post way too many hashtags. In practice, many <a href="https://blue.mackuba.eu/labellers/">existing labellers</a> are meant for self-labelling instead, letting you assign e.g. a country flag or some fun things like a D&amp;D character class to yourself.</p>

<p>The way it works technically is:</p>

<ul>
<li>a labeller either runs a firehose client pulling posts from the relay, or relies on reports from users and/or its operating team (usually using the <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/ozone/">Ozone tool</a> for that)</li>
<li>labels, which are lightweight objects (<em>not</em> ATProto records) are emitted from labeller’s special firehose stream (the <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto/blob/main/lexicons/com/atproto/label/subscribeLabels.json">subscribeLabels endpoint</a>)</li>
<li>the AppView listens to the label firehoses of all labellers it knows about, in addition to the relay stream, and records all received labels in its database</li>
<li>when a logged in user pulls data like threads or timelines from the AppView, it adds relevant label info to the responses depending on which labellers the user follows</li>
<li>the specific list of labellers whose labels should be applied is passed explicitly in API&nbsp;requests in the <code>atproto-accept-labelers</code> header (there is a “soft” limit of 20 labellers you can pass at a time, which is why the official app won’t let you subscribe to more)</li>
<li>in the official app, Bluesky’s official moderation service (which is “just” another labeller) is hardcoded as one of those 20 and you can’t turn it off; when connecting from your own app or tool, you’re free to ignore it if you want</li>
</ul>

<h2>Feed generators</h2>

<p><a href="https://mackuba.eu/2024/02/21/bluesky-guide/#feeds">Custom feeds</a> are one of the coolest features of Bluesky. They let you create any kind of feed using any algorithm and let everyone on the platform use it (even as the default feed, if they want to).</p>

<p>The way this system works is that you need to run a “<strong>feed generator</strong>” service on your server. In that service, you expose an API&nbsp;that the AppView can call, which returns a list of post at:// URIs selected by you however you want in response to a given request.</p>

<p>A minimal feed service can be pretty simple – the API&nbsp;is just three endpoints, two of which are static, and the third returns the post URIs. One “small” problem is that in order to return the post URIs, you need to have some info about posts stored up front, which in practice means that you almost always need to connect to a relay’s firehose stream and store some post data (of selected or all posts, depending on your use case).</p>

<p>The flow is like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>a feed record is uploaded to your repo, including metadata and location of the feed generator service, which lets other users find your feed</li>
<li>when the user opens that feed in the app, the AppView makes a request to your service on their behalf</li>
<li>your service looks at the request params and headers, and returns a list of posts it selected in the form of at:// URIs</li>
<li>the AppView takes those URIs and maps them to full posts (so-called “hydration”), which it returns to the user’s app</li>
</ul>


<p>How exactly those posts are selected to be returned in the given request is completely up to you, the only requirement is that these are posts that the AppView will have in its database, since you only send URIs, not actual post data. In most cases, feeds use some kind of keyword/regexp matching and chronological ordering, but you can even build very complex, AI-driven algorithmic “For You” style personalized feeds.</p>

<p>You don’t necessarily have to code a feed service yourself and host it in order to have a custom feed – there are a few feed hosting services that don’t require technical knowledge to use, like <a href="https://skyfeed.app/">SkyFeed</a> or <a href="https://www.graze.social/">Graze</a>.</p>



<h2>Client apps</h2>

<p>Ok, that’s technically not a server, but stay with me…</p>

<p>The final piece that you need to fully enjoy Bluesky is the client app – a mobile/desktop one or a web frontend. Unlike on Fedi, where an instance software like Mastodon usually includes a built-in web frontend that is your main interface for accessing the service, the PDS doesn’t include anything like that, just a database and an API&nbsp;(which also means it’s much more lightweight and needs less resources). All browsing is done through a separate client, and the client always does everything through the public API&nbsp;– kind of like when you run a custom web client for Mastodon like <a href="https://elk.zone/">Elk</a> or <a href="https://phanpy.social/">Phanpy</a>, you connect it to your instance, and you view your timeline on <a href="https://elk.zone/">elk.zone</a>.</p>

<p>So when you go to <a href="https://bsky.app/">bsky.app</a>, that’s what you’re seeing – a web client that connects to your PDS (Bluesky-hosted or self-hosted) through the public API, no more, no less. The official app is built for both mobile platforms and for the web from a single React Native codebase (apparently React Native on the web and normal web React is not the same thing 🧐). This has allowed the still very small frontend team (and IIRC at first it was literally just Paul) to build the app for three platforms in any reasonable amount of time and maintain it going forward. The downside is that it’s kinda neither a great webapp nor a great mobile app… But the team is doing what they can to improve it, and it’s already much better than it used to be, and tbh more than good enough for me.</p>

<p>There aren’t nearly as many alternative clients as there are for Mastodon, and none of them are <em>really</em> great, but there are a few options; see the <a href="https://mackuba.eu/2024/02/21/bluesky-guide/#apps">apps part of my Bluesky Guide</a> blog post for links.</p>



<h2>DMs</h2>

<p>Notice that I&nbsp;haven’t mentioned DMs anywhere – that’s because they aren’t a part of the protocol at the moment. The Bluesky team wants to eventually add some properly implemented, end-to-end encrypted, secure DMs using some open standard, but they won’t be able to finish that in the short term, and a lot of people were asking for at least some simple version of DMs in the app. So they’ve decided as an interim solution to implement them as a fully centralized, closed source service. It is accessible to third-party Bluesky clients through the API&nbsp;(the <code>chat.bsky.*</code> namespace), but it’s not something you can run yourself. The team is <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:44ybard66vv44zksje25o7dz/post/3lacrutxhio2h">very open</a> about the fact that it’s not a proper replacement for something like Signal, and that for sensitive communication, you should ideally just use it for swapping contacts on Signal on iMessage and move the conversation there. They also kinda don’t want to spend too much time adding features there, because it’s considered a temporary solution, so it’s pretty basic in terms of available features.</p>

<p>There are also a few other closed-source helper services, like the “cardyb” they use for generating link card details, or the video service for preprocessing videos, but they’re all specific to some Bluesky use cases only and not strictly necessary to use.</p>

<hr>



<h2>How it all fits together</h2>

<p>So the flow and hierarchy is like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>the <strong>client app</strong> you use creates new records as a result of actions you take (new posts, likes, follows), and saves them into your PDS</li>
<li>your <strong>PDS</strong> emits events on its firehose with the record details</li>
<li>Bluesky <strong>relay</strong> and other relays are connected to the firehoses of each PDS they know about (your PDS generally needs to ask them to connect using the <code>PDS_CRAWLERS</code> ENV variable), and they pass those events to their output firehose</li>
<li>the Bluesky <strong>AppView</strong> (and other AppViews) listen to the firehose of their selected relay (though it could be multiple relays, or it could even just stream directly from PDSes, but in practice this will normally be one trusted relay)</li>
<li>the AppView gets events including your records, and if they are relevant, saves the data to its internal database in some appropriate representations</li>
<li>when other users browse Bluesky in their client apps, they load timelines, feeds and threads from the AppView, which returns info about your post from that database it saved it to</li>
</ul>


<p>Additionally:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>feed generators</strong> run by third party feed operators also stream data from Bluesky’s or some other relay and save it locally, so they can respond to feed requests from the AppView</li>
<li><strong>labellers</strong> also stream data from Bluesky’s or some other relay, and emit labels on their firehoses, which get sent to the AppView (note: there is no official “labeller relay” sitting between labellers and the AppView, although one third party dev <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:w4xbfzo7kqfes5zb7r6qv3rw/post/3lrgs3itqyc2q">wrote one</a>)</li>
</ul>


<p>Note:</p>

<ul>
<li>PDSes <strong>do not connect to each other directly</strong>, and they don’t store posts of users from other PDSes, only their own</li>
<li>although right now basically everyone uses the Bluesky relay and AppView, anyone <em>can</em> set up their own alternative relays and AppViews, which feed from all or any subset of known PDSes</li>
<li>PDS chooses which relays to ask to connect, but relays can also connect by themselves to a PDS or another relay; AppView chooses which relay(s) it streams data from; and PDS chooses which AppView it loads timelines &amp; threads from</li>
<li>it’s absolutely possible and expected that two users using different PDSes, which use separate AppViews feeding from separate relays will be able to talk to each other and see each other’s responses on their own AppView, as long as the users aren’t banned on the other user’s infrastructure</li>
</ul>


<p>The metaphor that’s often used to describe these relationship is that PDSes are like websites which publish some blog posts, and relays &amp; AppViews are like search engines which crawl and index the web, and then let you look up results in them. In most cases, a website should be indexed and visible in all/most available search engines.</p>

<hr>



<h2>Where to go next</h2>

<p>And that’s about it – I&nbsp;think with the above, you should have a pretty good grasp of the big picture of ATProto architecture and all the specific parts of it. Now, if you want to start playing with the protocol and building some things on it, a lot will depend on what specifically you want to build and using what languages/technologies:</p>



<h4>SDKs:</h4>

<p>Two languages are officially supported by Bluesky:</p>

<ul>
<li>JavaScript/TypeScript, in which most of their code is written (see the <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto/tree/main/packages">packages folder</a> in the <code>atproto</code> repo)</li>
<li>Go, which is used in some backend pieces like the relay, or the <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/goat">goat</a> command line tool used e.g. for PDS migrations (see the <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/indigo"><code>indigo</code> repo</a>)</li>
</ul>


<p>For Python, there is a <a href="https://atproto.blue/">pretty full-featured SDK created by Marshal</a>, which is the only third party SDK <a href="https://atproto.com/sdks">officially endorsed</a> by the Bluesky team.</p>

<p>For other languages, I&nbsp;have a website called <a href="https://sdk.blue/">sdk.blue</a>, which lists all libraries and SDKs I&nbsp;know about, grouped by language. As you can see, there is something there for most major languages; I’ve built and maintain a group of <a href="https://sdk.blue/#ruby">Ruby gems</a> myself. If you want to use a language that doesn’t have any libraries yet, it’s really not that hard to make one from scratch – for most things you just need an HTTP client and a JSON parser, and maybe a websocket client.</p>



<h4>Docs:</h4>

<p>There is quite a lot of official documentation, although it’s a bit spread out and sometimes not easy to find.</p>

<p>The places to look in are:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://atproto.com/">atproto.com</a> – the official AT Protocol website; a bit more formal documentation about the elements of the protocol, kind of like what I&nbsp;did here, but with much more info and detailed specifications of each thing</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.bsky.app/docs/get-started">docs.bsky.app</a> – more practical documentation with guides and examples of specific use cases in TS &amp; Python (roll down the sections in the sidebar); it shows examples of how to make a post, upload a video, how to connect to the firehose, how to make a custom feed, etc.</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.bsky.app/blog">docs.bsky.app/blog</a> – developer blog with updates about protocol changes</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.bsky.app/docs/category/http-reference">HTTP reference</a> – a reference of all the API&nbsp;endpoints</li>
<li>something that I&nbsp;also find useful is to have the <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto">atproto repo</a> checked out locally and opened in the editor, and look things up in the JSON files from the <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto/tree/main/lexicons">/lexicons folder</a></li>
</ul>


<p>And a few other articles that might work better for you:</p>

<ul>
<li>“<a href="https://atproto.com/articles/atproto-for-distsys-engineers">ATProto for distributed systems engineers</a>”, Bluesky’s technical overview of the server and data flow architecture</li>
<li>“<a href="https://atproto.com/articles/atproto-ethos">ATProto Ethos</a>”, also on the Bluesky blog, based on a conference talk</li>
<li>“<a href="https://steveklabnik.com/writing/how-does-bluesky-work/">How Does BlueSky Work?</a>”, by Steve Klabnik (of Ruby &amp; Rust fame) (Feb 2024)</li>
<li>the “<a href="https://atproto.com/guides/applications">Statusphere</a>” app example on atproto.com</li>
</ul>




<h4>Community:</h4>

<p>Someone said recently that “<em>bsky replies are the only real documentation for ATProto</em>”, and honestly, they’re not wrong. We have a great community of third party developers now, building their own tools, apps, libraries, services, even organizing <a href="https://ahoy.eu/">conferences</a>. If you’re starting out and you have any questions, just ask and someone will probably help, and some of the Bluesky team developers are also very active in Bluesky threads, answering questions and clarifying things. So a lot of such knowledge that’s not necessarily found in the official docs can be found somewhere on Bluesky.</p>

<p>The two places I&nbsp;recommend looking at are:</p>

<ul>
<li>the “ATProto Touchers” Discord chat – ping me or some other developer for an invite&nbsp;:)</li>
<li>my <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:oio4hkxaop4ao4wz2pp3f4cr/feed/atproto">ATProto feed</a> on Bluesky, which tries to catch any ATProto development discussions – it should include posts with any mention of “ATProto” or things like “AppView” or various API&nbsp;names and technical terms, or you can use <code>#atproto</code> or <code>#atdev</code> hashtag to be sure</li>
</ul>


<p>Also, there’s a fantastic newsletter called <a href="https://connectedplaces.online/">Connected Places</a> (formerly Fediverse Report) by Laurens Hof, who publishes two separate editions every week, about what’s happening in Bluesky/ATProto and in the Fediverse (and *a lot* of things are happening).</p>



<h4>Ideas:</h4>

<p>Some easy ways to start tinkering:</p>

<ul>
<li>use one of the <a href="https://sdk.blue/">existing libraries for your favorite language</a> and make a website or command-line tool which loads some data from the AppView or PDS: load and print timelines, calculate statistics, browse contents of PDSes and repos, etc.</li>
<li>make a bot that posts something (not spammy!)</li>
<li>make a simple custom feed service using <a href="https://docs.bsky.app/docs/starter-templates/custom-feeds">one of the available templates</a></li>
<li>connect to the relay firehose and print or record some specific types of data</li>
</ul>




<h4>Tools:</h4>

<p>And a couple of tools which will certainly be useful in development:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://internect.info/">internect.info</a> – look up an account by handle/DID and see details like assigned PDS or handle history</li>
<li><a href="https://pdsls.dev/">PDSls</a> – PDS and repository browser, lets you look up repos by account DID or records by at:// URI&nbsp;(there are a few others, but this one is most popular)</li>
</ul>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-element="story-body" data-subscriber-content=""> <p>Most people not deeply involved in the artificial intelligence frenzy may not have noticed, but perceptions of AI’s relentless march toward becoming more intelligent than humans, even becoming a threat to humanity, came to a screeching halt Aug. 7.</p><p>That was the day when the most widely followed AI company, OpenAI, released GPT-5, an advanced product that the firm had long promised would put competitors to shame and launch a new revolution in this purportedly revolutionary technology.</p><p>As it happened, GPT-5 was a bust. It turned out to be less user-friendly and in many ways less capable than its predecessors in OpenAI’s arsenal. It made the same sort of risible errors in answering users’ prompts, was no better in math (or even worse), and not at all the advance that OpenAI and its chief executive, Sam Altman, had been talking up.</p><div data-click="enhancement" data-align-center=""> <blockquote> <p>AI companies are really buoying the American economy right now, and it’s looking very bubble-shaped.</p> </blockquote>  <p>— Alex Hanna, co-author, “The AI Con”</p>  </div><p>“The thought was that this growth would be exponential,” says Alex Hanna, a technology critic and co-author (with Emily M. Bender of the University of Washington) of the indispensable new book “<a href="https://www.harpercollins.com/products/the-ai-con-emily-m-benderalex-hanna?variant=43065101189154" target="_blank">The AI Con</a>: How to Fight Big Tech’s Hype and Create the Future We Want.” Instead, Hanna says, “We’re hitting a wall.” </p><p>The consequences go beyond how so many business leaders and ordinary Americans have been led to expect, even fear, the penetration of AI into our lives. Hundreds of billions of dollars have been invested by venture capitalists and major corporations such as Google, Amazon and Microsoft in OpenAI and its multitude of fellow AI labs, even though none of the AI labs has turned a profit. </p><p>Public companies have scurried to announce AI investments or claim AI capabilities for their products in the hope of turbocharging their share prices, much as an earlier generation of businesses promoted themselves as “dot-coms” in the 1990s to look more glittery in investors’ eyes. </p><p>Nvidia, the maker of a high-powered chip powering AI research, plays almost the same role as a stock market leader that Intel Corp., another chip-maker, played in the 1990s — helping to prop up the bull market in equities.</p><p>If the promise of AI turns out to be as much of a mirage as dot-coms did, stock investors may face a painful reckoning.</p><p>The cheerless rollout of GPT-5 could bring the day of reckoning closer. “AI companies are really buoying the American economy right now, and it’s looking very bubble-shaped,” Hanna told me. </p><p>The rollout was so disappointing that it shined a spotlight on the degree that the whole AI industry has been dependent on hype. </p><p>Here’s Altman, speaking just before the unveiling of GPT-5, comparing it with its immediate predecessor, GPT-4o: “GPT-4o maybe it was like talking to a college student,” he said. “With GPT-5 now it’s like talking to an expert — a legitimate PhD-level expert in anything any area you need on demand ... whatever your goals are.” </p><p>Well, not so much. When one user asked it to produce a map of the U.S. with all the states labeled, GPT-5 <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:qc6xzgctorfsm35w6i3vdebx/post/3lvua4fgc722k" target="_blank">extruded a fantasyland</a>, including states such as Tonnessee, Mississipo and West Wigina. Another prompted the model for a list of the first 12 presidents, with names and pictures. It only <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:vqtakzi5bityrtbjj4cfan4l/post/3lvvplusuos2n" target="_blank">came up with nine</a>, including presidents Gearge Washington, John Quincy Adama and Thomason Jefferson. </p><p>Experienced users of the new version’s predecessor models were appalled, not least by OpenAI’s decision to shut down access to its older versions and force users to rely on the new one. “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1mkd4l3/gpt5_is_horrible/" target="_blank">GPT5 is horrible</a>,” wrote a user on Reddit. “Short replies that are insufficient, more obnoxious ai stylized talking, less ‘personality’ … and we don’t have the option to just use other models.” (OpenAI quickly relented, reopening access to the older versions.)</p><p>The tech media was also unimpressed. “<a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/openai-huge-problem-gpt-5" target="_blank">A bit of a dud</a>,” judged the website Futurism and Ars Technica termed the rollout <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/08/the-gpt-5-rollout-has-been-a-big-mess/" target="_blank">“a big mess.”</a> I asked OpenAI to comment on the dismal public reaction to GPT-5, but didn’t hear back.</p><p>None of this means that the hype machine underpinning most public expectations of AI has taken a breather. Rather, it remains in overdrive. </p><p>A projection of AI’s development over the coming years published by something called the AI Futures Project under the title <a href="https://ai-2027.com/" target="_blank">“AI 2027”</a> states: “We predict that the impact of superhuman AI over the next decade will be enormous, exceeding that of the Industrial Revolution.” </p><p>The rest of the document, mapping a course to late 2027 when an AI agent “finally understands its own cognition,” is so loopily over the top that I wondered whether it wasn’t meant as a parody of excessive AI hype. I asked its creators if that was so, but haven’t received a reply.</p><p>One problem underscored by GPT-5’s underwhelming rollout is that it exploded one of the most cherished principles of the AI world, which is that “scaling up” — endowing the technology with more computing power and more data — would bring the grail of artificial general intelligence, or AGI, ever closer to reality. </p><p>That’s the principle undergirding the AI industry’s vast expenditures on data centers and high-performance chips. The demand for more data and more data-crunching capabilities will require <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/7052c560-4f31-4f45-bed0-cbc84453b3ce" target="_blank">about $3 trillion in capital</a> just by 2028, in the estimation of Morgan Stanley. That would outstrip the capacity of the global credit and derivative securities markets. But if AI won’t scale up, most if not all that money will be wasted.</p><p>As Bender and Hanna point out in their book, AI promoters have kept investors and followers enthralled by relying on a vague public understanding of the term “intelligence.” AI bots seem intelligent, because they’ve achieved the ability to seem coherent in their use of language. But that’s different from cognition. </p><p>“So we’re imagining a mind behind the words,” Hanna says, “and that becomes associated with consciousness or intelligence. But the notion of general intelligence is not really well-defined.” </p><p>Indeed, as long ago as the 1960s, that phenomenon was noticed by Joseph Weizenbaum, the designer of the pioneering chatbot ELIZA, which replicated the responses of a psychotherapist so convincingly that even test subjects who knew they were conversing with a machine thought it displayed emotions and empathy.</p><p>“What I had not realized,” <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Computer-Power-Human-Reason-Calculation/dp/0716704633/" target="_blank">Weizenbaum wrote in 1976</a>, “is that extremely short exposures to a relatively simple computer program could induce powerful delusional thinking in quite normal people.” Weizenbaum warned that the “reckless anthropomorphization of the computer” — that is, treating it as some sort of thinking companion — produced a “simpleminded view of intelligence.” </p><p>That tendency has been exploited by today’s AI promoters. They label the frequent mistakes and fabrications produced by AI bots as “hallucinations,” which suggests that the bots have perceptions that may have gone slightly awry. But the bots “don’t have perceptions,” Bender and Hanna write, “and suggesting that they do is yet more unhelpful anthropomorphization.” </p><p>The general public may finally be cottoning on to the failed promise of AI more generally. Predictions that AI will lead to large-scale job losses in creative and STEM fields (science, technology, engineering and math) might inspire feelings that the whole enterprise was a tech-industry scam from the outset. </p><p>Predictions that AI would yield a burst of increased worker productivity haven’t been fulfilled; in many fields, productivity declines, in part because workers have to be deployed to double-check AI outputs, lest their mistakes or fabrications find their way into mission-critical applications — legal briefs incorporating nonexistent precedents, medical prescriptions with life-threatening ramifications and so on.</p><p>Some economists are dashing cold water on predictions of economic gains more generally. MIT economist Daron Acemoglu, for example, forecast last year that AI would produce <a href="https://economics.mit.edu/sites/default/files/2024-05/The%20Simple%20Macroeconomics%20of%20AI.pdf" target="_blank">an increase of only about 0.5%</a> in U.S. productivity and an increase of about 1% in gross domestic product over the next 10 years, mere fractions of the AI camp’s projections.</p><p>The value of Bender’s and Hanna’s book, and the lesson of GPT-5, is that they remind us that “artificial intelligence” isn’t a scientific term or an engineering term. It’s a marketing term. And that’s true of all the chatter about AI eventually taking over the world.</p><p>“Claims around consciousness and sentience are a tactic to sell you on AI,” Bender and Hanna write. So, too, is the talk about the billions, or trillions, to be made in AI. As with any technology, the profits will go to a small cadre, while the rest of us pay the price ... unless we gain a much clearer perception of what AI is, and more importantly, what it isn’t. </p><div data-list-id="00000192-be42-da32-a3db-ff76fc3b0000" data-module-id="00000192-be42-da32-a3db-ff76fc3b0000" data-click="enhancement" data-align-center="">  <p data-element="element-header" data-click="liZZListTitleCTA">  <h3 data-element="element-header-title" data-counter="3">More to Read </h3>  </p>      </div> </div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://github.com/google/pytype">https://github.com/google/pytype</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44963724">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text"><p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">An update on pytype</h2><a id="user-content-an-update-on-pytype" aria-label="Permalink: An update on pytype" href="#an-update-on-pytype"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>TL;DR</strong>: The last supported Python version for Pytype will be 3.12. We are
still very actively interested in the space of Python type checking, but
shifting our investments towards new ideas and different frameworks.</p>
<p dir="auto">Pytype's development began in 2012 to meet Google developers' demand for
compile-time checking. Pytype started with using type inference and interface
files, and then switched to inline annotations (while retaining the inference
engine) after the acceptance of PEP 484. Later, pytype's team collaborated with
Guido and mypy to create typeshed, a central repository for type annotations.</p>
<p dir="auto">While pytype has been effective, its bytecode-based design has presented
challenges in implementing new features (e.g. faster adoption of new typing
PEPs) due to bytecode’s inherent instability and propensity to change.
Consequently, we intend to focus our investments on exploring new typing
approaches that are better suited for Google’s Python user base and make
Python 3.12 the last supported version for pytype.</p>
<p dir="auto">We encourage folks to investigate the mature and excellent alternative solutions
for Python typing going forward. We would like to note that the Python typing
ecosystem is very robust now, offering a wider array of mature solutions (see
<a href="https://github.com/google/pytype/issues/1925" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/google/pytype/issues/1925/hovercard">FAQ</a>).</p>
<p dir="auto">The creation and development of pytype was a collaborative effort, and we would
like to thank all contributors to pytype, especially the four main contributors:
Rebecca Chen, Martin DeMello, Teddy Sudol, and initial lead Matthias Kramm.
We particularly recognize Rebecca Chen for her decade-long commitment to pytype
and her significant contributions to Python's type system as a long-standing
member of the typing council.</p>
