<p id="caption-attachment-38130">Histology image of a patient whose metastatic cancer went into complete remission after receiving a new immunotherapy treatment (Ravetch lab)</p>
</div>
<p>Over the past 20 years, a class of cancer drugs called CD40 agonist antibodies have shown great promise—and induced great disappointment. While effective at activating the immune system to kill cancer cells in animal models, the drugs had limited impact on patients in clinical trials&nbsp;and caused dangerously systemic inflammatory responses, low platelet counts, and liver toxicity, among other adverse reactions—even at a low dose.</p>
<p>But in 2018, the lab of Rockefeller University’s Jeffrey V. Ravetch <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1810566115" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demonstrated</a> it could engineer an enhanced CD40 agonist antibody so that it improved its efficacy and could be administered in a manner to limit serious side effects. The findings came from research on mice, genetically engineered to mimic the pathways relevant in humans. The next step was to have a clinical trial to see the drug’s impact on cancer patients.</p>
<p>Now the results from the phase 1 clinical trial of the drug, dubbed 2141-V11, have been <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ccell.2025.07.013" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> in <em>Cancer Cell</em>. Of 12 patients, six patients saw their tumors shrink, including two who saw them disappear completely.</p>
<p>“Seeing these significant shrinkages and even complete remission in such a small subset of patients is quite remarkable,” says first author Juan Osorio, a visiting assistant professor in Ravetch’s <a href="https://lab.rockefeller.edu/ravetch/">Leonard Wagner Laboratory of Molecular Genetics and Immunology</a> and a medical oncologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.</p>
<p>Notably, the effect wasn’t limited to tumors that were injected with the drug; tumors elsewhere in the body either got smaller or were destroyed by immune cells.</p>
<p>“This effect—where you inject locally but see a systemic response—that’s not something seen very often in any clinical treatment,” Ravetch notes. “It’s another very dramatic and unexpected result from our trial.”</p>
<p><strong>Engineering enhancements</strong></p>
<p>CD40 is a cell surface receptor and member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily, proteins that are largely expressed by immune cells. When triggered, CD40 prompts the rest of immune system to spring into action, promoting antitumor immunity and developing tumor-specific T cell responses.</p>
<p>In 2018, Ravetch’s lab—which has been supported in this line of research by Rockefeller’s Therapeutic Development Fund, founded by trustee Julian Robertson and continued by the Black Family Foundation—engineered 2141-V11, a CD40 antibody that binds tightly to human CD40 receptors and is modified to enhance its crosslinking by also engaging a specific Fc receptor. It proved to be 10 times more powerful in its capacity to elicit an antitumor immune response.</p>
<p>They then changed how they administered the drug. The long-time approach had been to give it intravenously. But CD40 receptors are widespread, so too many non-cancerous cells pick it up, leading to the well-known toxic side effects. Instead, they injected the drug directly into tumors.</p>
<p>“When we did that, we saw only mild toxicity,” Ravetch says.</p>
<p>Those findings became the basis of the phase 1 clinical trial described in the current study, which aimed to determine a starting clinical dose of the drug and better understand the mechanisms underlying its effectiveness.</p>
<p><strong>Inducing remission</strong></p>
<p>The trial included 12 patients representing myriad metastatic cancer types: melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, and different types of breast cancer. Of those 12, none suffered the serious side effects seen with other CD40 drugs. Six experienced systemic tumor reduction, of which two had a complete response—meaning their cancer disappeared entirely.</p>
<p>The two patients who experienced complete remission had melanoma and breast cancer, respectively—both notoriously aggressive and recurring.</p>
<p>“The melanoma patient had dozens of metastatic tumors on her leg and foot, and we injected just one tumor up on her thigh,” Ravetch says. “After multiple injections of that one tumor, all the other tumors disappeared. The same thing happened in the patient with metastatic breast cancer, who also had tumors in her skin, liver, and lung. And even though we only injected the skin tumor, we saw all the tumors disappear.”</p>
<p>Tissue samples from the tumor sites revealed the immune activity that the drug stimulated. “We were quite surprised to see that the tumors became full of immune cells—including different types of dendritic cells, T cells, and mature B cells—that formed aggregates resembling something like a lymph node,” Osorio says. “The drug creates an immune microenvironment within the tumor, and essentially replaces the tumor with these tertiary lymphoid structures.”</p>
<p>The presence of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) is associated with improved prognosis and response to immunotherapy, Osorio notes.</p>
<p>They also found TLS in the tumors they didn’t inject. “Once the immune system identifies the cancer cells, immune cells migrate to the non-injected tumor sites,” he says.</p>
<p><strong>Improving immunotherapy</strong></p>
<p>The findings have sparked a number of other clinical trials that the Ravetch lab is currently collaborating on with researchers at Memorial Sloan Kettering and Duke University. Now in either phase 1 or phase 2 study, the trials are investigating 2141-V11’s effect on specific cancers, including bladder cancer, prostate cancer, and glioblastoma—all aggressive and hard to treat. Collectively, nearly 200 people are enrolled in the studies.</p>
<p>These studies will help to illuminate why some patients respond to 2141-V11 and others do not—and how to potentially change that.</p>
<p>For example, the two patients in the clinical trial whose cancer disappeared both had a high clonality of T cells—key cancer-cell killers—when they began the study. “This suggests there are some requirements from the immune system in order for this drug to work, and we’re in the process of dissecting these characteristics in more granular detail in these larger studies.”</p>
<p>“As a general rule, only 25 to 30% of patients will respond to immunotherapy, so the biggest challenge in the field is to try to determine which patients will benefit from it. What are the indicators or predictors of response? And how can we convert non-responders into responders?”</p>

        </p>
    

    <p>Over the last twenty years, I have used over a dozen languages professionally, from C to Common Lisp, from Java to Python, from C++ to Typescript.</p>
<p>Yet, I love janky programming languages. In particular, I really enjoy PHP and Javascript.</p>
<p>Here's why.</p>
<h2 id="they-are-used-by-people-who-get-shit-done">They are used by people who get shit done.</h2><p>This makes it easy to find people who:</p>
<ul>
<li>understand business needs,</li>
<li>can iterate quickly</li>
<li>have shipped and maintained many projects in the past.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="there-is-a-lot-of-fud-that-has-been-cargo-culted-throughout-the-years">There is a lot of FUD that has been cargo-culted throughout the years.</h2><p>PHP8 is not your grandmother's PHP3, ECMAScript 12 is not your grandfather's Javascript.</p>
<p>Their ecosystems haven't stood still either.  Tools like CPAN, PECL, npm have put significant evolutionary pressure on other languages.  With its daily new paradigms and frameworks, Javascript has been a hotbed of innovation for years.</p>
<h2 id="their-quality-is-offset-by-other-factors">Their quality is offset by other factors.</h2><p>These languages are not popular for their elegance, but for other reasons.</p>
<p>These can be:</p>
<ul>
<li>speed</li>
<li>ease of deployment</li>
<li>malleability</li>
<li>tooling</li>
<li>community</li>
<li>frameworks</li>
<li>platforms</li>
</ul>
<p>PHP is a favorite of mine because of its cgi-bin model:</p>
<ul>
<li>legacy codebases can be refactored in pieces</li>
<li>resource leaks are non-existent</li>
<li>caching and scaling are simpler</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="they-are-fun">They are fun.</h2><p>Because basic areas of the language are problematic areas means that programming comes with a sense of experimentation. There is pleasure in finding ways to write elegant code in a language that doesn't prescribe any.</p>
<h2 id="janky-programming-languages-are-great-equalizers">Janky programming languages are great equalizers.</h2><p>Because they are quite permissive, they allow people of all levels and backgrounds to get started with programming. You can be a complete PHP beginner and get a real website going within days.</p>
<p>Having started by copy-pasting BASIC snippets and later on making my own websites with PHP2 and PHP3, I feel pride in being able to pay back by helping newcomers where they are.</p>
<p>Poo-poo-ing a 12-year-old or a recent BootCamp graduate because they are writing actual code is missing the point.</p>
<p>In fact, because users are builders and learners because they have diverse backgrounds, janky languages tend to have very active and welcome communities.</p>
<h2 id="i-never-had-issues-writing-good-code">I never had issues writing good code.</h2><p>PHP, Javascript, Lua, Perl all provide effective tools:</p>
<ul>
<li>functions</li>
<li>variables</li>
<li>classes</li>
<li>first-class functions</li>
<li>sometimes traits and prototypal inheritance.</li>
</ul>
<p>Good software is:</p>
<ul>
<li>product alignment</li>
<li>software design</li>
<li>naming and design patterns</li>
<li>enforcing invariants through static analysis or unit testing</li>
<li>providing fast and effective feedback loops to developers</li>
<li>good team communication</li>
</ul>
<p>None of which depend on the language.</p>
<p>Javascript and PHP in particular come with:</p>
<ul>
<li>solid libraries</li>
<li>pragmatic static analysis tools</li>
<li>great IDE support</li>
</ul>
<p>In fact, they have better tooling than many a "serious" programming language.</p>
<h2 id="i-love-legacy-codebases">I love legacy codebases.</h2><p>A legacy codebase means that the product is performing well. It means that I can often make immediate and impactful improvements.</p>
<p>For me, nothing comes close to the pleasure of improving a product with many users.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-headline="How Cryptocurrency Captured the Dream of the Decentralized Web"><p><span>The term </span><a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/web3" target="_blank">Web3</a><span> was originally </span><a href="https://gavwood.com/dappsweb3.html" target="_blank">coined</a><span> by Etherium cofounder </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Wood" target="_blank">Gavin Wood</a><span> as a secure, decentralized, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/peer-to-peer">peer-to-peer</a> version of the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/internet">Internet</a>. </span><span>The idea was to build an Internet</span><span> based on </span><a data-linked-post="2653906720" href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/forget-cryptocurrencies-and-nftssecuring-devices-is-the-future-of-blockchain-technology" target="_blank">blockchain technology</a><span> and a peer-to-peer network, without the need for large <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/data-centers">data centers</a> or third-party providers. These days, however, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/blockchain">blockchain</a> is most famous as the tool enabling <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-future-of-money?utm_campaign=post-teaser&amp;utm_content=ibfuflhf" target="_blank">cryptocurrencies</a>. Most recently</span><span>, the Trump administration has </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/18/business/bitcoin-crypto-rally-us-stocks" target="_blank">taken</a><span> on a pro-cryptocurrency stance, boosting blockchain’s </span>popularity and media prominence.</p><p><span><a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/cryptography">Cryptography</a> is central to the functioning of blockchains, whether for a <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/decentralized-web">decentralized Web</a> or for <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/cryptocurrencies">cryptocurrencies</a>. Every time a <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/cryptocurrency">cryptocurrency</a> transaction is initiated, all parties involved in the transaction need to securely prove that they agree to the transfer. This is done via a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature" target="_blank">digital signature</a>: a cryptographic protocol that generates a secret, private key that is unique to each user and a public key that the user shares. Then, the private key is used to generate a unique signature for each transaction. The public key can be used to verify that, indeed, the signature was created by the holder of the private key. In this way, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/web3">Web3</a> in every incarnation relies heavily on cryptography. </span></p><p><span>To learn more about the evolution of Web3, and cryptography’s role, we caught up with</span><span> </span><a href="https://wahby.net/" target="_blank">Riad Wahby</a><span>, assistant professor of electrical and <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/computer-engineering">computer engineering</a> at <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/carnegie-mellon-university">Carnegie Mellon University</a>, in Pittsburgh, and a cofounder and CEO of hardware-backed Web3 security platform </span><a href="https://cubist.dev/" target="_blank">Cubist</a><span>.</span></p><p><span> Wahby explained what Web3 was meant to be, what it’s become, and how hardware-backed cryptography will enable its future.<br></span></p><h3>Web3 Began as a Response to What Came Before</h3><p><strong><em>IEEE Spectrum</em>: What is Web3?</strong></p><p><strong>Riad Wahby:</strong> That’s the hardest question that you’re going to ask by far, because I don’t know how to answer it in a way that satisfies everyone.</p><p>The term Web3 was coined around 2014, by people who looked at the way that the Web had developed. Web 1.0 was the first Web bubble, the dot-com bubble. <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/web-2-0">Web 2.0</a>, roughly speaking, is <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/google">Google</a> and <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/facebook">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/microsoft">Microsoft</a> and Apple and <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/netflix">Netflix</a>, and the like. And the perception, especially from folks who originally coined this term Web3, was that these companies had basically taken the Web in the wrong direction, because your privacy is gone, and you’re the product, so to speak. You use <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/gmail">Gmail</a> for free because Google is mining your emails to sell things like better advertising. Web3 was originally a reaction to this. Early proponents of Web3 basically said, “We don’t want that. We want to take back control of our stuff. I want to own my own data, and maybe cryptocurrencies and blockchains are the way there.” So that’s where the term originally came from.</p><p><strong>What does the term mean now?</strong></p><p><strong>Wahby:</strong> Now it doesn’t mean anything like that at all. Now Web3 is the broader ecosystem around cryptocurrencies and blockchain-based technologies. And I think basically all of that revolutionary spirit has gone away in favor of building financial products and making a lot of money doing it. As far as I can tell, the term has really transformed from a reaction to a lack of privacy and a lack of sovereignty in my own data to “Hey, this is a technology that has something to do with blockchains.” Maybe you can buy some kind of speculative meme coin and make a bunch of money doing it. So I don’t know, maybe that took a dark turn at the end. That’s how things go.</p><p><strong>How are those two definitions connected?</strong></p><p><strong>Wahby:</strong> Cryptography really fits into the revolutionary spirit, in the sense that the folks who want to cast off the chains of things like Google and Facebook, one of the tenets was—”The way that we’ll do that is we’ll build this technology that’s sort of amazing and that gives us all these great properties.” And they were going to do that using some advanced cryptographic technologies. This is the reason that there’s so many people who are cryptography researchers at universities that also are involved deeply in some kind of cryptocurrency. Because it’s like this is a sea change in the way that cryptography gets used in the world.</p><p>Twenty years ago, it used to be that if you were working on really any kind of cryptography, regardless of how theoretical or how practical you intended it to be, you knew that there was not much of a chance that any of it was going to get really used in the world, unless it was extremely practical and extremely focused on solving some immediate problem. And it just used to be the case that people were extremely conservative about what kind of cryptography they used. Basically, everyone thought, “We don’t need any of this crazy stuff. That’s all theory. Nobody cares. The only stuff we need is what lets you connect to <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/amazon">Amazon</a> and safely buy stuff.” The rise of cryptocurrencies brought with it this whole shift in the way that cryptography gets deployed in the world, where now if you can come up with some interesting functionality that’s enabled by some advanced cryptography, probably somewhere somebody is going to try and turn that into a product that they can sell.</p><h3>Web3 Is Both Good and Bad for Cryptography</h3><p><strong>What effect has this had on the cryptographic community?</strong></p><p><strong>Wahby:</strong> It’s both good and bad. It’s good in that this means that there’s a lot of motivation to build interesting, cool stuff. And as a researcher in cryptography, I love it because it means that there’s tons more research money being poured into cryptography.</p><p>That’s the good side. The bad side is that the reason that people were so conservative about deploying new cryptography is that it’s easy to get the security mechanism wrong. The default state of cryptography is [to assume everything is] broken. You have to be very, very careful that each change that you make isn’t returning your cryptography to the default state. I’m not saying that people in Web3 aren’t careful. They are. It’s just by the nature of things, since it’s a much faster time frame, there’s much more pressure to just push stuff into production. And I think the downside is that we have seen a little bit of brokenness. It’s hopefully not causing people to lose oodles of money. And I think the historical record bears this out: People lose oodles of money because other people are really dishonest, not because the cryptography is broken for the most part. But the cryptography can also be broken, and that can also be worrisome. But I’d say from the perspective of somebody who’s doing research in cryptography, the impact of Web3 on the cryptographic community has generally been a good thing.</p><p><strong>Now you’re focused on <a data-linked-post="2667266794" href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/open-titan-chip" target="_blank">hardware security</a>. Can you explain what that is?</strong></p><p><strong>Wahby:</strong> Any cryptocurrency has this property that if I hold some token, and I want to send it to somebody else, the way that I do that is by producing a digital signature that says, I want to spend this token. The secret key is what lets you generate a signature. So if you have 10 <a data-linked-post="2657850698" href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-merge-heralds-cryptos-climate-friendly-future" target="_blank">E</a>TH [cryptocurrency coins], and they’re all protected by this key, and somebody takes a copy of your key, then life is bad.</p><p>With a digital signature key it could just be sitting on your hard drive, and then you get some <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/malware">malware</a>, and now somebody has silently stolen your key. There have been these big, broadly targeted malware campaigns where millions and millions of people have all had their keys stolen. So now the criminals are just like sitting there counting up all the money that they’ve stolen, and there’s no reversing transactions, unlike at a bank.</p><p>Here’s where hardware comes in. This is not really a Web3 technology, this is kind of old, good stuff. There are these devices called hardware security modules, and they’ve been used for multiple decades. This is a physical device, and this device can run certain cryptographic <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/algorithms">algorithms</a>. And it knows enough that when you tell it, “Hey, please generate me a key,” it can generate you a key securely. And when you tell it, “Please give me a signature,” it can give you a signature securely. But the important thing is the way that it’s designed, the key never leaves this piece of hardware. It turns what was a piece of data into a physical object. And we know how to secure a physical object.</p><p><strong>You’re working on extending hardware security for more use cases. Can you explain what you’re doing?</strong></p><p><strong>Wahby:</strong> There are two issues with the standard hardware security module.</p><p>No. 1, you need more cryptography support, so you need to be able to apply digital signatures to transactions very quickly if you’re actively trading. And No. 2, you need a way of expressing that it’s not just a key that can generate any signature. It’s a key that also has attached to it some kind of policy that says these are the kinds of signatures that are okay to generate, and everything else is not allowed, to add extra security. These are the two directions that we have that our technology enables within traditional hardware security modules.</p><p>We start with the security that’s provided by the traditional hardware security module, and we extend it using this, actually another piece of trusted hardware called the Trusted Execution Environment. We extend it to support the actual kinds of cryptography that are needed for Web3 and to support this rich programmable policy layer that lets you say, “This key is only intended for this specific kind of use,” or “anytime somebody tries to make a payment from this key, first I have to check whether the recipient is subject to sanctions,” or any other rule. So in the end, we have, not only a hardware security module, we have also this Trusted Execution Environment and this policy layer, and all this other cryptographic stuff that together gives us a hardware security module that’s really designed for the Web3 use case.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>Memory Integrity Enforcement (MIE) is the culmination of an unprecedented design and engineering effort, spanning half a decade, that combines the unique strengths of Apple silicon hardware with our advanced operating system security to provide industry-first, always-on memory safety protection across our devices — without compromising our best-in-class device performance. We believe Memory Integrity Enforcement represents the most significant upgrade to memory safety in the history of consumer operating systems.</p>
<hr>
<p>There has never been a successful, widespread malware attack against iPhone. The only system-level iOS attacks we observe in the wild come from mercenary spyware, which is vastly more complex than regular cybercriminal activity and consumer malware. Mercenary spyware is historically associated with state actors and uses exploit chains that cost millions of dollars to target a very small number of specific individuals and their devices. Although the vast majority of users will never be targeted in this way, these exploit chains demonstrate some of the most expensive, complex, and advanced attacker capabilities at any given time and are uniquely deserving of study as we work to protect iPhone users against even the most sophisticated threats. Known mercenary spyware chains used against iOS share a common denominator with those targeting Windows and Android: they exploit memory safety vulnerabilities, which are interchangeable, powerful, and exist throughout the industry.</p>
<p>For Apple, improving memory safety is a broad effort that includes developing with safe languages and deploying mitigations at scale. (For a primer on how we think about memory safety, see the opening of <a href="https://security.apple.com/blog/towards-the-next-generation-of-xnu-memory-safety#memorysafety">this post</a>.) We created Swift, an easy-to-use, memory-safe language, which we employ for new code and targeted component rewrites. In iOS 15, we introduced <a href="https://security.apple.com/blog/towards-the-next-generation-of-xnu-memory-safety/">kalloc_type</a>, a secure memory allocator for the kernel, followed in iOS 17 by its user-level counterpart, xzone malloc. These secure allocators take advantage of knowing the type — or purpose — of allocations so that memory can be organized in a way that makes exploiting most memory corruption vulnerabilities inherently difficult.</p>
<p>In 2018, we were the first in the industry to deploy Pointer Authentication Codes (PAC) in the A12 Bionic chip, to protect code flow integrity in the presence of memory corruption. The strong success of this defensive mechanism in increasing exploitation complexity left no doubt that the deep integration of software and hardware security would be key to addressing some of our greatest security challenges. With PAC behind us, we immediately began design and evaluation work to find the most effective way to build sophisticated memory safety capabilities right into Apple silicon.</p>
<p>Arm published the <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/login/articles/login_summer19_03_serebryany.pdf">Memory Tagging Extension (MTE)</a> specification in 2019 as a tool for hardware to help find memory corruption bugs. MTE is, at its core, a memory tagging and tag-checking system, where every memory allocation is tagged with a secret; the hardware guarantees that later requests to access memory are granted only if the request contains the correct secret. If the secrets don’t match, the app crashes, and the event is logged. This allows developers to identify memory corruption bugs immediately as they occur.</p>
<p>We conducted a deep evaluation and research process to determine whether MTE, as designed, would meet our goals for hardware-assisted memory safety. Our analysis found that, when employed as a real-time defensive measure, the original Arm MTE release exhibited weaknesses that were unacceptable to us, and we worked with Arm to address these shortcomings in the new <a href="https://developer.arm.com/documentation/109697/0100/Feature-descriptions/The-Armv8-9-architecture-extension?lang=en#md454-the-armv89-architecture-extension__FEAT_MTE4">Enhanced Memory Tagging Extension (EMTE)</a> specification, released in 2022. More importantly, our analysis showed that while EMTE had great potential as specified, a rigorous implementation with deep hardware and operating system support could be a breakthrough that produces an extraordinary new security mechanism.</p>
<p>Consider that MTE can be <a href="https://developer.arm.com/documentation/108035/0100/How-does-MTE-work-/When-to-use-SYNC-and-ASYNC-MTE-modes">configured</a> to report memory corruption either synchronously or asynchronously. In the latter mode, memory corruption doesn’t immediately raise an exception, leaving a race window open for attackers. We would not implement such a mechanism. We believe memory safety protections need to be strictly synchronous, on by default, and working continuously. But supporting always-on, synchronous MTE across key attack surfaces while preserving a great, high-performance user experience is extremely demanding for hardware to support.</p>
<p>In addition, for MTE to provide memory safety in an adversarial context, we would need to finely tune the operating system to defend the new semantics and the confidentiality of memory tags on which MTE relies. Ultimately, we determined that to deliver truly best-in-class memory safety, we would carry out a massive engineering effort spanning all of Apple — including updates to Apple silicon, our operating systems, and our software frameworks. This effort, together with our highly successful secure memory allocator work, would transform MTE from a helpful debugging tool into a groundbreaking new security feature.</p>
<p>Today we’re introducing the culmination of this effort: Memory Integrity Enforcement (MIE), our comprehensive memory safety defense for Apple platforms. Memory Integrity Enforcement is built on the robust foundation provided by our <strong>secure memory allocators</strong>, coupled with <strong>Enhanced Memory Tagging Extension (EMTE)</strong> in synchronous mode, and supported by extensive <strong>Tag Confidentiality Enforcement</strong> policies. MIE is built right into Apple hardware and software in all models of iPhone 17 and iPhone Air and offers unparalleled, always-on memory safety protection for our key attack surfaces including the kernel, while maintaining the power and performance that users expect. In addition, we’re making EMTE available to all Apple developers in Xcode as part of the new <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/enabling-enhanced-security-for-your-app#Adopt-hardware-memory-tagging">Enhanced Security</a> feature that we released earlier this year during WWDC.</p>
<p>The rest of this post dives into the intensive engineering effort required to design and validate Memory Integrity Enforcement.</p>
<h3>Designing Memory Integrity Enforcement</h3>
<p>Memory Integrity Enforcement starts with our secure memory allocators — kalloc_type, xzone malloc, and WebKit’s libpas — all of which use <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/adopting-type-aware-memory-allocation">type information</a> to decide how to organize memory allocations. With both use-after-free and out-of-bounds bugs, an attacker’s goal is to create overlapping interpretations of memory, which they achieve by controlling the precise position of certain allocations — of a specific type — that is advantageous to them. The type-aware placement policies of our secure memory allocators help thwart these memory corruption techniques, as we described in our <a href="https://security.apple.com/blog/what-if-we-had-sockpuppet-in-ios16/">kalloc_type post</a>. Our secure allocators set a new high-water mark of software protection against memory corruption, while preserving the same or better performance as the allocators they replaced.</p>
<p>Allocators can apply protections only at the granularity of memory pages — 16KB on iOS — which is a natural fit for multi-page allocations. For smaller allocations, our secure allocators can use page-level protections to help prevent memory corruption attacks across different type buckets. However, page-level protections are too coarse to defend against attacks within the same type bucket, and we use memory tagging to close this gap.</p>
<p>Let’s look at how EMTE can be used to protect against two of the most common types of memory corruption: buffer overflows and use-after-free vulnerabilities. For buffer overflows, the allocator is responsible for using different tags for neighboring allocations. If a request to access memory spills over to adjacent memory that has a different tag, the hardware blocks it, and the operating system can take action and terminate the process. We represent this visually below with three adjacent allocations, tagged with three different secrets: ⏺️, 🔼, and ⏹️. Two access attempts with the 🔼 tag are permitted to 🔼-tagged memory, but the third attempt is blocked as it spills over into the adjacent, ⏹️-tagged allocation.</p>
<p> Memory Integrity Enforcement blocks buffer overflows </p>

<p>The allocator is also responsible for retagging memory as it gets reused for other purposes. In the image below, the 🔼 allocation is retagged as ⏹️ after it has been freed and reallocated by the system. If a request to the retagged memory is made with the older 🔼 tag, as would be seen in use-after-free exploits, the hardware blocks it and lets the operating system take further action.</p>

<p>A key weakness of the original MTE specification is that access to non-tagged memory, such as global variables, is not checked by the hardware. This means attackers don’t have to face as many defensive constraints when attempting to control core application configuration and state. With Enhanced MTE, we instead specify that accessing non-tagged memory from a tagged memory region requires knowing that region’s tag, making it significantly harder for attackers to turn out-of-bounds bugs in dynamic tagged memory into a way to sidestep EMTE by directly modifying non-tagged allocations.</p>
<p>Finally, we developed <strong>Tag Confidentiality Enforcement</strong> to protect the implementation of our secure allocators from technical threats and to guard the confidentiality of EMTE tags — including against side-channel and speculative-execution attacks.</p>
<p>Our typed allocators and EMTE both rely on confidentiality of kernel data structures from user applications, and of the tags chosen by the allocator. Attackers might attempt to defeat EMTE, and in turn Memory Integrity Enforcement, by revealing these secrets. To protect the kernel allocator backing store and tag storage, we use the <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/security/operating-system-integrity-sec8b776536b/1/web/1#secd022396fb">Secure Page Table Monitor</a>, which provides strong guarantees even in the presence of a kernel compromise. We also ensure that when the kernel accesses memory on behalf of an application, it's subject to the same tag-checking rules as userspace.</p>
<p>Attacks based on speculative execution can also be used to expose secrets. To improve performance, modern CPUs predict the execution of instructions that follow prior, potentially longer latency instructions. If the prediction is correct, computation is very fast. If it’s wrong, the CPU discards the prediction, and computation is slower. Unfortunately, discarded predictions have observable effects that can reveal system state and data, and because speculative attacks never cause the system to crash or misbehave in observable ways during their use, they’re particularly useful for an attacker. For example, evaluating a pointer authentication instruction speculatively exposed <a href="https://pacmanattack.com/">timing differences</a> in our original implementation of Pointer Authentication Codes (PAC), which would allow the valid signature to be isolated. During the design phase for Memory Integrity Enforcement, we identified and addressed the three speculative vulnerabilities that could undermine tag confidentiality.</p>
<p>First, when EMTE is active, requests to access memory cause the hardware to check tags. It's crucial that evaluating a tag-checking instruction speculatively doesn’t expose timing differences that would allow an attacker to isolate the valid tag. From the start, we designed the Apple silicon implementation so that tag values can’t influence speculative execution in any way. Recently published <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08719">security research</a> demonstrates that the MTE implementation on Google’s Pixel devices is vulnerable to this type of attack, allowing MTE to be bypassed in Google Chrome and the Linux kernel.</p>
<p>Second, allocators assign random tags to memory, and attackers must not be able to predict tag values that the system will choose. We address this issue by frequently re-seeding the underlying pseudo-random generator used to select new tags.</p>
<p>Third, <a href="https://spectreattack.com/spectre.pdf">Spectre variant 1 (V1)</a> is a speculative-execution vulnerability that allows attackers to exploit conditional branches to leak data, including MTE tag values. To date, there has been no solution to this problem in consumer operating systems, because general Spectre V1 mitigations such as <a href="https://llvm.org/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.html">Speculative Load Hardening</a> have a prohibitive CPU cost. The presence of EMTE leaves Spectre V1 as one of the last avenues available to attackers to help guide their attacks, so we designed a completely novel mitigation that limits the effective reach of Spectre V1 leaks — at virtually zero CPU cost — and forces attackers to contend with type segregation. This mitigation makes it impractical for attackers to use Spectre V1, as they would typically need 25 or more V1 sequences to reach more than 95 percent exploitability rate — unless one of these sequences is related to the bug being exploited, following similar reasoning as our <a href="https://security.apple.com/blog/towards-the-next-generation-of-xnu-memory-safety#benefits">kalloc_type analysis</a>.</p>
<p>Our mission with Memory Integrity Enforcement is to protect all users by default and provide an extraordinary disruption to the exploitation of memory corruption vulnerabilities. To do so, we considered a wide set of threats, including some of the most challenging ones — such as side channels — and arrived at this extensive combination of features not present in other MTE implementations. Google took a great first step last year when they offered MTE to those who opt in to their program for at-risk users. But even for users who turn it on, the effectiveness of MTE on Android is limited by the lack of deep integration with the operating system that distinguishes Memory Integrity Enforcement and its use of EMTE on Apple silicon.</p>
<p>For the new A19 and A19 Pro chips to support Memory Integrity Enforcement, we dedicated an extraordinary amount of Apple silicon resources to security — more than ever before — including CPU area, CPU speed, and memory for tag storage. And to fully realize this hardware investment, we designed all of the new operating system elements of MIE jointly with our hardware work, including secure allocators, EMTE, and tag confidentiality protections.</p>
<p>Because EMTE tag checking imposes a performance cost, we designed Memory Integrity Enforcement to take advantage of our secure allocators first and use EMTE to protect only smaller individual allocations within a type bucket, which software allocators can’t defend on their own. Then, by knowing where and how we would deploy EMTE, we could accurately model the tag-checking demand of the operating system, and design our silicon to satisfy it. Our hardware implementation influenced additional software design decisions, reducing the overhead of tag checks even further. Importantly, deploying EMTE with this level of precision supports our strategy to provide as many memory safety improvements as possible to users on previous iPhone generations, which don’t support EMTE.</p>
<p>For the security evaluation of Memory Integrity Enforcement, we involved our offensive research team from the very beginning. From 2020 to 2025, they continuously analyzed and attacked the system — first conceptually, with theoretical exploitation avenues, then with practical attacks in simulated environments, and eventually on new hardware prototypes. Prolonged engagement from our offensive research team allowed us to identify and eradicate entire attack strategies and techniques before attackers could ever discover them, leading to a stronger, more mature feature from the outset.</p>
<p>Our offensive research team identified where and how attackers are most likely to break into the system, and our deployment of Memory Integrity Enforcement is deeply guided by their findings. Notably, this includes making sure that this powerful new protection is available to third-party apps that are likely entry points for attackers — such as social networks, messaging apps, or any other app where a specific user can be targeted. Starting immediately with the launch of MIE, any developer can begin testing this powerful protection for their app, including EMTE on hardware that supports it, using the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/enabling-enhanced-security-for-your-app#Adopt-hardware-memory-tagging">Enhanced Security</a> settings in Xcode.</p>
<p>The meticulous planning and implementation of Memory Integrity Enforcement made it possible to maintain synchronous tag checking for all the demanding workloads of our platforms, delivering groundbreaking security with minimal performance impact, while remaining completely invisible to users.</p>
<h3>Security evaluation</h3>
<p>Memory Integrity Enforcement started with a deeply ambitious goal: to make it immensely more expensive and difficult to develop and maintain mercenary spyware attacks based on memory corruption against our platforms. While there’s no such thing as perfect security, MIE is designed to dramatically constrain attackers and their degrees of freedom during exploitation.</p>
<p>Throughout the design and implementation of Memory Integrity Enforcement, our offensive research team evaluated our progress by looking at sophisticated exploit chains that were previously used against our platform, recent vulnerabilities, and our own internal research. First, we worked on rebuilding and adapting previously seen exploit chains to systems protected by MIE. But it’s not sufficient to consider only previous chains that were developed before MIE existed, because attackers will surely adapt in reaction to these new protections. We therefore also evaluated a selection of more recent vulnerabilities that we expected would have the best chance of surviving MIE. For these, we meticulously enumerated all possible exploitation opportunities, similar to our evaluation of <a href="https://security.apple.com/blog/what-if-we-had-sockpuppet-in-ios16/">SockPuppet against kalloc_type</a>.</p>
<p>Both approaches revealed the same conclusion: Memory Integrity Enforcement vastly reduces the exploitation strategies available to attackers. Though memory corruption bugs are usually interchangeable, MIE cut off so many exploit steps at a fundamental level that it was not possible to restore the chains by swapping in new bugs. Even with substantial effort, we could not rebuild any of these chains to work around MIE. The few memory corruption effects that remained are unreliable and don’t give attackers sufficient momentum to successfully exploit these bugs.</p>
<p>Here’s a visual representation of what this looks like for an attacker. The chart below represents six of the real-world exploit chains that we evaluated and shows the steps where Memory Integrity Enforcement — the secure allocators, EMTE, or both — stops the attack.</p>
<p> Memory Integrity Enforcement vs. real-world exploit chains</p>
<figure><picture><source srcset="https://security.apple.com/assets/image/generated/xlarge_advanced-memory-integrity-light.png 2500w, https://security.apple.com/assets/image/generated/large_advanced-memory-integrity-light.png 1650w, https://security.apple.com/assets/image/generated/medium_advanced-memory-integrity-light.png 1300w, https://security.apple.com/assets/image/generated/small_advanced-memory-integrity-light.png 840w, https://security.apple.com/assets/image/generated/xsmall_advanced-memory-integrity-light.png 560w" media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" decoding="async" loading="lazy"><img alt="Memory Integrity Enforcement vs. real-world exploit chains" src="https://security.apple.com/assets/image/generated/medium_advanced-memory-integrity-dark.png" srcset="https://security.apple.com/assets/image/generated/xlarge_advanced-memory-integrity-dark.png 2500w, https://security.apple.com/assets/image/generated/large_advanced-memory-integrity-dark.png 1650w, https://security.apple.com/assets/image/generated/medium_advanced-memory-integrity-dark.png 1300w, https://security.apple.com/assets/image/generated/small_advanced-memory-integrity-dark.png 840w, https://security.apple.com/assets/image/generated/xsmall_advanced-memory-integrity-dark.png 560w" sizes="(max-width:734px) 100vw, (max-width:1068px) calc(100vw - 76px), 650px" decoding="async" loading="lazy"></picture></figure>
<p>Notably, attackers confront Memory Integrity Enforcement early in the exploitation process. Although some issues are able to survive MIE — for example, intra-allocation buffer overflows — such issues are extremely rare, and even fewer will lend themselves to a full end-to-end exploit. Inevitably, attackers must face MIE at a stage where their capabilities are still very limited, leaving few viable avenues for exploitation. This leads to fragile chains where breaking just one step is often enough to invalidate the entire exploit strategy. When that happens, most of the chain’s components can’t be reused, and the attackers have to restart exploit development with entirely new bugs.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>The industry-leading security of iPhone means that the vast majority of our users never face system-level attacks on their devices. Our work on memory safety is aimed primarily at the mercenary spyware and surveillance industry, which spends many millions of dollars to exploit memory corruption vulnerabilities and target a small number of individuals because of who they are and what they do. Over the past five years, we developed a comprehensive approach to memory safety that integrates the best of our hardware and software capabilities, and today’s announcement is the culmination of this ambitious vision. With the introduction of the iPhone 17 lineup and iPhone Air, we’re excited to deliver Memory Integrity Enforcement: the industry’s first ever, comprehensive, always-on memory-safety protection covering key attack surfaces — including the kernel and over 70 userland processes — built on the Enhanced Memory Tagging Extension (EMTE) and supported by secure typed allocators and tag confidentiality protections.</p>
<p>Based on our evaluations pitting Memory Integrity Enforcement against exceptionally sophisticated mercenary spyware attacks from the last three years, we believe MIE will make exploit chains significantly more expensive and difficult to develop and maintain, disrupt many of the most effective exploitation techniques from the last 25 years, and completely redefine the landscape of memory safety for Apple products. Because of how dramatically it reduces an attacker’s ability to exploit memory corruption vulnerabilities on our devices, we believe Memory Integrity Enforcement represents the most significant upgrade to memory safety in the history of consumer operating systems.</p></div></article></div>]]></description>

The back of iPhone Air is now protected with Ceramic Shield, and the front cover uses Ceramic Shield 2, delivering 3x better scratch resistance, making iPhone Air more durable than any previous iPhone. iPhone Air also features a stunning 6.5-inch Super Retina XDR display with ProMotion up to 120Hz.<sup>1</sup> With the most Apple-designed chips in an iPhone — the powerhouse A19 Pro, N1, and C1X — iPhone Air is the most power-efficient iPhone ever made. Paired with the redesigned internal architecture and software optimizations, iPhone Air has fantastic all-day battery life. A powerful 48MP Fusion Main camera enables the equivalent of four lenses with incredible image quality, and the innovative 18MP Center Stage front camera takes selfies to the next level.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>iPhone Air will be available in four gorgeous finishes: space black, cloud white, light gold, and sky blue. Pre-orders begin Friday, September 12, with availability beginning Friday, September 19.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>“The all-new iPhone Air is so powerful, yet impossibly thin and light, that you really have to hold it to believe it’s real. This huge leap in design and engineering is only made possible through Apple innovation, especially Apple silicon,” said John Ternus, Apple’s senior vice president of Hardware Engineering. “iPhone Air is a brand-new member of the iPhone family that delivers advanced features our users will love, like pro performance, a versatile 48MP Fusion camera system, our innovative Center Stage front camera, and great all-day battery life — all in a breakthrough design that feels like you’re holding the future.”

</h2>
                 
             
                 <div>Featuring a breakthrough design with pro performance, iPhone Air is the thinnest iPhone ever made at 5.6mm, and it is incredibly light, with a large, stunning display. The grade 5 titanium frame is strong, with an elegant high-gloss mirror finish, and a new plateau on the back that is precision-milled on both sides to house the cameras, speaker, and Apple silicon. This maximizes space for the battery to deliver remarkable all-day battery life. The thin design also features the Action button, so users can easily access a variety of functions with just a press, and Camera Control, to quickly launch the camera or enable visual intelligence.<sup>2</sup>

                 <div>The stunning 6.5-inch Super Retina XDR display features ProMotion, with an adaptive refresh rate of up to 120Hz for smooth scrolling and stunning graphics. The Always-On display shows important information at a glance, and when not in use, it efficiently adjusts down to 1Hz. iPhone Air is easy to use outside with 3000 nits peak outdoor brightness — the highest ever on iPhone — and 2x better outdoor contrast.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>iPhone Air also introduces the Ceramic Shield 2 front cover, which is tougher than any smartphone glass or glass-ceramic with a new Apple-designed coating, providing 3x better scratch resistance and improved anti-reflection to reduce glare. For the very first time, Ceramic Shield now protects the back of iPhone, including the plateau, delivering 4x better resistance to cracks than the back glass on previous models. And with the strong titanium frame, iPhone Air exceeds Apple’s stringent bend strength requirements. This design makes iPhone Air more durable than any previous iPhone.

                 <div>iPhone Air introduces an all-new Center Stage front camera that advances the photo and video experience. The Center Stage front camera features the first square front camera sensor on iPhone, offering a wide field of view and capturing photos up to 18MP. Users no longer have to rotate their iPhone to take a landscape selfie — they can take photos and videos in portrait or landscape while holding their iPhone vertically. For group shots, Center Stage for photos uses AI to automatically expand the field of view and can rotate from portrait to landscape to include everyone in the frame. The Center Stage front camera enables ultra-stabilized video in 4K HDR, and users can record on the front and rear cameras simultaneously with Dual Capture — perfect for documenting themselves and the world around them. During calls over FaceTime or third-party apps, Center Stage for video calls keeps users stable and positioned in frame.

                 <div>Apple is introducing a new ecosystem of accessories to complement the breakthrough design of iPhone Air:
</div>
                 
             
                 <div><ul>
<li>The iPhone Air Case with MagSafe — available in frost and shadow — has an ultra-thin translucent design with a lightly frosted interior, a high-gloss outer surface, and a reinforced polycarbonate frame to protect iPhone Air from scratches and drops.</li>
</ul>
</div>
                 
             
                 <div><ul>
<li>The slim and lightweight iPhone Air Bumper — available in four matching colors — perfectly frames iPhone Air with a reinforced polycarbonate design for added edge protection.</li>
</ul>
</div>
                 
             
                 <div><ul>
<li>Crafted from 100 percent recycled yarns, the Crossbody Strap drapes comfortably, with embedded flexible magnets and stainless steel sliding mechanisms to easily adjust the length and keep both straps securely aligned. The Crossbody Strap will be available in 10 colors: black, light gray, blue, light blue, purple, sienna, green, neon yellow, tan, and orange.</li>
</ul>
</div>

</h2>
                 
             
                 <div>Apple 2030 is the company’s ambitious plan to be carbon neutral across its entire footprint by the end of this decade by reducing product emissions from their three biggest sources: materials, electricity, and transportation. iPhone Air is made with 35 percent recycled content, including 80 percent recycled titanium, the highest ever for an iPhone, and 100 percent recycled cobalt in the battery. A new titanium USB-C port is 3D-printed to be thinner and stronger, fitting into the slim design while using 33 percent less material than a conventional forging process. iPhone Air is manufactured with 45 percent renewable electricity, like wind and solar, across the supply chain. It is designed to be durable, repairable, and offer industry-leading software support, while meeting Apple’s high standards for energy efficiency and safe chemistry. The paper packaging is 100 percent fiber-based and can be easily recycled.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-headline="E-Paper Display Reaches the Realm of LCD Screens"><p><a data-linked-post="2656435247" href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/how-e-ink-developed-full-color-epaper" target="_blank">E-paper displays</a> are prized for their readability and <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/low-power">low power</a> use, but they’ve long been dismissed as too slow for everyday computing. </p><p>Modos, a two-person startup with open-hardware roots, thinks it has cracked part of that problem with a development kit capable of driving an <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/e-paper">e-paper</a> display at refresh rates up to a record 75 hertz.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.crowdsupply.com/modos-tech/modos-paper-monitor" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Modos Paper Monitor and Dev Kit</a>, now available for <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/crowdfunding">crowdfunding</a> on Crowd Supply, combines standard e-paper panels with an <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/open-source">open source</a> <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/fpga" target="_self">FPGA</a>-based display controller. While the kit provides enthusiasts and developers a complete package (with e-paper display, display driver, and hardware adapter), it’s also an entry point for experimenting with different e-paper displays.</p><p>RELATED: <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/how-e-ink-developed-full-color-epaper" target="_blank">How E Ink Developed Full-Color E-paper</a></p><p><span>“I would say instead of our secret sauce, </span><span>we have</span> open sauce<span>,” </span><span>says</span> cofounder <a href="https://alexsoto.dev/" target="_blank">Alexander Soto</a>. “<span>You</span> don’t even need to use the panel <span>we’re</span> offering. You could use a different panel and still get <span>[75 Hz]</span><span>.”</span></p><h2>E-paper at 75 Hz</h2><p>Most e-paper panels update at a refresh rate of around 10 Hz or less. (E-paper is the generic term for screens that mimic the appearance of ink on paper—the most well-known brand being that made by the company E Ink.) Some displays don’t even quote a refresh rate and may require up to a full second to refresh. </p><p>A better refresh rate means a display can show more frames each second, which in turn provides smoother, more lifelike motion. Modern <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/digital-video">digital video</a> is usually delivered at 30 or 60 frames per second, which until recently was well beyond the reach of an e-paper display. This is an area where e-paper clearly lags <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/lcd">LCD</a> displays, which start at 60 Hz <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/computer-display-500-hertz" target="_self">and go up from there</a>.</p><p>Modos is able to hit refresh rates of up to 75 Hz on a 13-inch e-paper panel with a 1,600 by 1,200 resolution. (a 6-inch e-paper panel with 1,448 by 1,072 resolution and the same refresh rate is available, too.) <span>Bumping the refresh rate also reduces latency. That’s a key point, as it allows an e-paper display to be used in situations where latency matters, such as a computer or tablet display.</span></p><p>“A lot of people default to thinking that with <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/e-readers">e-readers</a> or e-paper, it’s slow, it’s going to be flashing all the time,” says Soto. “Our challenge has been going to conferences, going to events, and showing people…e-paper can be very fast.” </p><h2>Open Source E-Paper Display Controller</h2><p>Modos’s quoted 75-Hz refresh rate is the highest yet for an e-paper display, but it’s arguably not the key innovation. Several competitors already <a href="https://shop.dasung.com/products/dasung-paperlike-103-the-worlds-first-60hz-e-ink-monitor?srsltid=AfmBOorlsMmiegZ0giXwX251IS66vU2ndubmx7sO-in0dfuYmove1fdS" target="_blank">offer e-paper displays with refresh rates up to 60 Hz which</a>, though lower, is close. </p><p>But Modos has a not-so-secret weapon: Caster, an open-source e-paper display controller that’s compatible with a wide variety of e-paper panels. The display controller, which is based on the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/amd">AMD</a> Spartan-6 <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/fpga">FPGA</a>, departs from typical e-paper controllers with pixel-level display management. </p><p>“Traditionally, the [e-paper display] controller used a single-state machine to control the entire panel, with only two states: static and updating,” says Modos cofounder <a href="https://github.com/zephray" target="_blank">Wenting Zhang</a>. “Caster treats each pixel individually rather than as a whole panel, which allows localized control on the pixels.”</p><p>The FPGA display controller is paired with Modos’s <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/glider">Glider</a> Mega Adapter, which includes four different display connectors compatible with several dozen e-paper displays ranging in size from 4.3 to 13 inches. Soto says the adapter can be used to repurpose displays salvaged from older e-readers, like Amazon’s <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/kindle">Kindle</a>.</p><p> <span data-rm-shortcode-id="82b00cdb83e4c7253acea47ddb69f8b5"><iframe frameborder="0" height="auto" type="lazy-iframe" scrolling="no" data-runner-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N_Lqa1FMtpw?rel=0" width="100%"></iframe></span> <small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">A 75-Hz refresh rate allows for smoother scrolling.</small> <small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Modos</small> </p><p>Modos also provides an application <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/programming">programming</a> interface (API), written in the C programming language, that lets applications select display-driving modes dynamically. As the video above shows, a <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/linux">Linux</a> window manager can be used to render text in a low-latency binary color mode, display maps in more detailed yet responsive gray scale, and display video with maximum-fidelity gray scale—all simultaneously on the same screen. </p><p>The code and schematics for Caster, Glider, and the API are open source <a href="https://github.com/Modos-Labs" target="_blank">and available on Github</a>. </p><h2>Crowdfunding for E-paper Innovation</h2><p>Modos’s crowdfunding campaign is set to conclude on <span>18 September. </span>Orders are expected to ship in January of 2026, although (as is often the case for crowdfunded projects) the shipping window is not guaranteed. </p><p>Getting to this stage has taken several years. The company’s founders initially hoped to build an e-paper laptop, the <a href="https://www.modos.tech/blog/modos-paper-laptop" target="_blank">Modos Paper Laptop</a>, which was announced in January of 2022. However, the realities of electronics manufacturing complicated that project early in its life and the laptop was never made available to order. </p><p>“Part of it was that the primary aspect ratio for the majority of [laptop] chassises are for 16:9 and 16:10. And when you look at e-paper displays, it was an aspect ratio of 4:3. So, we either had to make a custom chassis, or a custom panel, both of them being prohibitively expensive,” says Soto.</p><p>Panel sourcing also remains a hurdle. E-paper’s production is geared toward e-readers and signage, which means most panels aren’t the right size for a computer. However, the Modos Paper Monitor and Dev Kit found a practical compromise in recently introduced 13-inch e-paper displays, many of which provide a resolution similar to LCD and <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/oled">OLED</a> panels developed for <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/laptops">laptops</a>. </p><p>In this way, the Dev Kit is a continuation of Modos’s original goal. While building a full-fledged e-paper laptop was impractical, the Dev Kit’s high refresh rate, open-source display controller, and API give ambitious users the opportunity to implement their own low-latency e-paper computer display—or anything else they put their mind to.</p><p><em>This article was updated on 8 September 2025 to replace mentions of “E Ink” (the specific e-paper technology developed by the company of the same name) with “e-paper.”</em><br></p></div></div>]]></description>

I remember starting at Microsoft in the late '90s, always in the office, no laptops, and primarily working with the people right down the hall. As technology evolved and our business expanded, we became more open, more global, and able to scale in ways we couldn't have imagined. Then the pandemic reshaped everything. It pushed us to think differently about work, to connect like never before (thank you Teams!), reminded us of how much we value being together, and gave us focus and autonomy in the traditional workday. We're not going back, and we shouldn't. Instead, we should take the best of what we've learned and move forward.</em></p><p><em>In the AI era, we are moving faster than ever, building world class technology that changes how people live and work, and how organizations everywhere operate. If you reflect on our history, the most meaningful breakthroughs happen when we build on each other's ideas together, in real time.</em></p><p><em>We've looked at how our teams work best, and the data is clear: when people work together in person more often, they thrive—they are more energized, empowered, and they deliver stronger results. As we build the AI products that will define this era, we need the kind of energy and momentum that comes from smart people working side by side, solving challenging problems together.</em></p><p><em>With that in mind, we're updating our flexible work expectations to three days a week in the office.</em></p><p><em>We'll roll this out in three phases: 1) starting in Puget Sound at the end of February; 2) expanding to other US locations; 3) and then launching outside the US.</em></p><p><em>Our goal with this change is to provide more clarity and consistency in how we come together, while maintaining the flexibility we know you value. We want you to continue to shape your schedule in ways that work best for you, making in-person time intentional and impactful. Importantly, this update is not about reducing headcount. It's about working together in a way that enables us to meet our customers' needs.</em></p><p><em>For some of you, this is not a change. For others this may be a bigger adjustment, which is exactly why we're providing time to plan thoughtfully. As part of these updates, we're also enhancing our workplace safety and security measures so we can continue to provide a workplace where every employee can do their best work.</em></p><p><em>What you need to know:</em></p><p><em>Puget Sound-area employees: If you live within 50 miles of a Microsoft office, you'll be expected to work onsite three days a week by the end of February. You'll receive a personalized email today with more details. Please connect with your manager and team to understand your organization's plans. If needed, you can request an exception by Friday, September 19.</em></p><p><em>Managers: You'll find actions to take, and the resources to support both you and your team on the Managers@Microsoft SharePoint.</em></p><p><em>All employees: You'll hear from your EVP or organizational leadership today with specific guidance. Each business will do what is best for their team, which means some groups will deviate from our company-wide expectations. If you are outside of the Puget Sound area, you do not need to take any action at this time unless your EVP communicates otherwise.</em></p><p><em>Timelines and details for additional US office locations will be announced soon. For employees outside the United States, we will begin planning in 2026. More information is available on the Flexible Work at Microsoft SharePoint.</em></p><p><em>As always, we'll keep learning together to ensure Microsoft is the best place for you to grow and have a great career. Let's keep moving forward together.</em></p><p><em>Thank you,</em></p><p><em>Amy"</em></p><p><strong><em>Have a tip?

<p><abbr>I</abbr>t’s been some time since <strong>Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)</strong> has been seen using a tool known as a Stingray, or a cell-site simulator, in its attempts to find and remove undocumented immigrants. The tool tricks a phone into thinking it’s a cell tower, and when a suspect’s device connects, the cops can trace its location. Its use is controversial because anyone in the same area as the target is at risk of having their information exposed.</p>

<p>In a recently-unsealed search warrant reviewed by <em>Forbes</em>, ICE <strong>used such a cell-site simulator in an attempt to track down an individual</strong> in Orem, Utah. The suspect had been ordered to leave the U.S. in 2023, but is believed to still be in the country. Investigators learned last month that before going to Utah, he’d escaped prison in Venezuela where he was serving a sentence for murder, according to the warrant. He’s also suspected of being linked to gang activity in the country, investigators said.</p>

<p>When the government got the target’s number, they first got a warrant to get its location. However, the trace wasn’t precise–it only told law enforcement that the target was somewhere in an area covering about 30 blocks. That led them to asking a court for a Stingray-type device to get an accurate location.</p>

<p>The warrant was issued at the end of last month and it’s not yet known if the fugitive was found.</p>
<p>But the case shows that, despite having been<a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/privacy-technology/ice-using-powerful-stingray-surveillance-devices" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="https://www.aclu.org/news/privacy-technology/ice-using-powerful-stingray-surveillance-devices" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.aclu.org/news/privacy-technology/ice-using-powerful-stingray-surveillance-devices" aria-label="criticized by civil rights groups"> criticized by civil rights groups</a> for using Stingrays during the last Trump administration, ICE continues to use the technology. Earlier this year, new media publication <a href="https://san.com/cc/exclusive-evidence-of-cell-phone-surveillance-detected-at-anti-ice-protest/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="https://san.com/cc/exclusive-evidence-of-cell-phone-surveillance-detected-at-anti-ice-protest/" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://san.com/cc/exclusive-evidence-of-cell-phone-surveillance-detected-at-anti-ice-protest/" aria-label="Straight Arrow News">Straight Arrow News</a> said it had analysed “mobile network anomalies” around a Washington state protest against ICE raids that were consistent with Stingray use.</p>
<p><em>Forbes</em> found contract records showing ICE purchased nearly $1 million worth of “cell site simulator vehicles” in May this year, indicating it’s taking the surveillance tool fully mobile. That was part of a contract first signed under the Biden administration in 2024.</p>
<p>ICE also has an active contract worth up to $4.4 million with the original Stingray manufacturer, Harris Corporation, for unspecified “equipment to determine the location of targeted mobile handsets.” That deal was also signed during the Biden years.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p dir="ltr"><strong>Update Sept. 9 @ 3pm ET</strong></p><p dir="ltr">What you're about to read is something that all endpoint detection and response (EDR) companies perform as a byproduct of investigating threats. Because these services are designed to monitor for and detect threats, EDR systems by nature need the capability to monitor system activity, as is outlined in our <a href="https://support.huntress.io/hc/en-us/articles/35179490601491-Huntress-Data-Collection-and-Incident-Response" target="_blank">product documentation</a>, <a href="https://www.huntress.com/privacy-policy" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>, and <a href="https://support.huntress.io/hc/en-us/articles/14692045459731-Huntress-Platform-Terms-of-Service" target="_blank">Terms of Service</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">On the heels of questions around how and why Huntress released this information, we wanted to clarify several important aspects of our investigation. We have an obligation to 1) research and respond to security threats and investigate malware and 2) educate the broader community about those threats. These dual objectives played into our decision to develop and publish this blog post.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">When we first came across the host mentioned in this blog, it was because we were first responding to numerous alerts that were related to malware executing on it. Part of this process involves our SOC team closely investigating signals and collecting artifacts related to EDR telemetry on the host. It was only upon further investigation into this telemetry that we observed signals indicating malicious behavior. By this point, we also found that the unique machine name used by the individual was the same as one that we had tracked in several incidents prior to them installing the agent.</p><p dir="ltr">At this point, we determined that the host that had installed the Huntress agent was, in fact, malicious. We wanted to serve the broader community by sharing what we learned about the tradecraft that the threat actor was using in this incident. In deciding what information to publish about this investigation, we carefully considered several factors, like strictly upholding our privacy obligations, as well as disseminating EDR telemetry that specifically reflected threats and behavior that could help defenders.</p><p dir="ltr">Overall, this investigation is a result of what we strive to do best: transparency, education, and wrecking hackers. Read on to learn more.</p><p>------------------------</p><h2 id="summary" dir="ltr">Summary</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Here at Huntress, we love exposing adversary tradecraft, and we also love when threat actors make blunders. So imagine our delight when a threat actor installed Huntress onto their operating machine—after finding us via one of our advertising campaigns and starting a trial— giving us a sprawling inside look at how they’re using AI to build workflows, searching for tools like Evilginx, and more.</p>
<p dir="ltr">------------------------</p>
<p dir="ltr">We all know that security products are often downloaded by attackers for “evaluation,” but often we can only guess as to how they decided to target a particular technology, or the actions taken while trying out such software. We recently had the pleasure of getting a front seat view into what one attacker did, simply because they installed our agent and let us collect information directly from them. Here, we will cover this strange tale.</p>

<h2 id="how-did-we-get-here" dir="ltr">How did we get here?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Like most good stories, this one starts in the middle and works its way back and forth. Let’s start with how this person of interest got our attention. One of the tricks of the trade to get people interested in your products is through advertising. As such, we run ads to help lead potential customers to our products. An adverse effect here might be garnering some “unwanted” attention as well. Such is the setting for the beginning of this adventure: it all started with a nicely placed Google ad.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The attacker tripped across our ad while researching another security solution. We confirmed this is how they found us by examining their Google Chrome browser history. An example of how this may have appeared to them in the moment may be seen in Figure 1.</p>

<p><img data-zoomable="" data-image-zoomable="true" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeJUVtwy7xflclvgUeBGQfKElGqL2tDQbXGU__smHcQsDJvHgD5E2eZRuOmqeV-NsvVb-JB152RhoN3lL-lTVNJYV5oNlEBuvSu83HIBy9G-Q143xhDbhTB1SpIniI7ZeHY6VxM?key=6dcQwm6GIQlCTfuUoMFMyQ" alt="" width="100%"><em><br>Figure 1: Google search for Bitdefender, leading to a Huntress ad</em></p>

<p dir="ltr">It appears that the attacker became interested in Huntress while simultaneously trying out Bitdefender. After hitting our comparison page, they could hardly contain themselves and started a trial immediately. We are able to follow their journey through their Chrome history, as seen in Figure 2 below.</p>

<p><strong id="docs-internal-guid-be8d7eb7-7fff-327f-6069-dcb73e57acea"><img data-zoomable="" data-image-zoomable="true" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdKW29wTam1W7HtnCDFCrX2D6axopp-uc5BAtORJxIoMZ1VcDFBCGvI1SO7704Ba3mJoq4PF1RLoUFFJBb1pS7ftM2yA5U3XzrVVv2XgbjGTn-frP-K-yRmJ-8bkaChOhp-wN1j?key=6dcQwm6GIQlCTfuUoMFMyQ" alt="" width="100%"></strong>
    <em><br>Figure 2: Browser history showing how a search for Bitdefender led to a Huntress trial</em>
</p>




<p dir="ltr">It’s no secret that threat actors may install security products for research purposes or even for legitimate use—and in fact, the adversary was interested in other security products in addition to Bitdefender and Huntress. We found evidence that they had bought a Malwarebytes subscription (including the Malwarebytes browser guard extension).</p>

<p><img data-zoomable="" data-image-zoomable="true" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXe4s839ASjHRduw42AfZDjVCCo9gYEfwo00ZXg-JsrUFJSBECVjEPyafTyhfC4bUPrllQbWx2pCu2lR0QnDZzlASrOwP69P7x6qTJ9g0kDAex4Ax2_K_-K3l5HWiO9PLqSDdn9x?key=6dcQwm6GIQlCTfuUoMFMyQ" alt="" width="100%"><br><span><em>Figure 3: Attacker tries to stay safe with an installed Malwarebytes browser extension </em>🤣</span></p>

<h2 id="threat-actor-red-flags-and-our-response" dir="ltr">Threat actor red flags—and our response</h2>
<p dir="ltr">We knew this was an adversary, rather than a legitimate user, based on several telling clues. The standout red flag was that the unique machine name used by the individual was the same as one that we had tracked in several incidents prior to them installing the agent. Further investigation revealed other clues, such as the threat actor’s browser history, which appeared to show them trying to actively target organizations, craft phishing messages, find and access running instances of Evilginx, and more. We also have our suspicions that the operating machine where Huntress was installed is being used as a jump box by multiple threat actors—but we don’t have solid evidence to draw firm conclusions at this time.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Huntress analysts went to work evaluating the outstanding indicators of compromise found on the adversary’s host and how they related to data found within authentications to identities at Huntress. Retroactive hunts disclosed a further 20 identities which were compromised; many of which had been accessed by the adversary prior to Huntress’ deployment against the identity, whose activity was limited to refreshing session tokens to maintain access.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Overall, analysis of the adversary’s primary operating infrastructure, hosted on Autonomous System (AS) “<strong>12651980 CANADA INC</strong>.” (now known as VIRTUO) disclosed a pattern of access of over <strong>2471</strong> unique identities spanning the last two weeks– many of which were preemptively caught by additional detection capabilities such as malicious mail rule creation, or session token theft.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The intelligence gathered by the above has resulted in detections of high confidence against the adversary’s infrastructure; and equipped our systems and analysts to respond to these incidents in significantly less time and with extreme confidence in malice, eliminating adversarial attempts to evade our detections.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">All in all, we were able to see the threat actor’s specific day-to-day activities—from their methodologies to the specific types of organizations (and even individuals) they were interested in. We also saw them begin to tinker with tools and search for tutorials, attempting to learn more. For instance, after installing the Huntress agent, the threat actor took steps to better understand Autoruns.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><br><strong id="docs-internal-guid-f7aa566e-7fff-bc29-2a94-c149563495b6"><img data-zoomable="" data-image-zoomable="true" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdPydpBlPDUhdpXoIj2Tszjw0b_1JM21SgtUEqdyV18htkfyvOYkTj0v6nBA0FVh6B_SJyPrllalrwV3jNTgd3Ogv3x78Ea8c4f-lS_PEVD1Qk9zY4Btq54gFOkk6TL1qhEDJLY?key=6dcQwm6GIQlCTfuUoMFMyQ" alt="" width="100%"></strong><em>Figure 4: The threat actor attempting to better understand Autoruns</em></p>






<p dir="ltr">Overall, over the course of three months we saw an evolution in terms of how the threat actor refined their processes, incorporated AI into their workflows, and targeted different organizations and vertical markets, as outlined in Figure 5 below.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The Chrome browser history gave a first-hand look at how the adversary is using AI tools to increase the operational efficiency of their workflows. While there have previously been many reports on how cybercriminals are using AI (based on indicators in phishing messages or landing page content), this is the first time that we have a close-up view of a threat actor embedding AI into their operations in order to automate—and speed up—their workflow.</p>
<p dir="ltr">On May 25, the threat actor signed up for Make.com, which is legitimate workflow automation software, before researching the platform’s Telegram Bot integration feature as a way to launch automated processes (as seen in Figure 6 below). The threat actor then poked around several FAQ sites to better understand how Telegram Bot APIs work and how to set up webhooks.</p>

<p><img data-zoomable="" data-image-zoomable="true" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdD1sNQy7UFszqPrYnYqsKTxKPPMvBwNblhn-PdLylCfh3H__YPNTevJGgGRY7q6XL9CQODTBmFfx8W7f_baKImgYYblbEBaicYk7md_HbdIH4UnHudnolzjrdW_DRS_X0vyap5?key=6dcQwm6GIQlCTfuUoMFMyQ" alt="" width="100%"><em><br>Figure 6: Signing up for <a href="http://make.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Make.com</a>&nbsp;</em></p>

<p dir="ltr">Over time, the threat actor started to get a better grasp of how they could use Make.com for specific workflows, and their browser history shows them starting to rely more heavily on the platform. By the time June 29 rolled around, the threat actor had fully developed their workflow with Make. As seen in Figure 8, the threat actor would first identify the organization of interest (typically after receiving a “tip” from Telegram) before using Google Translate to translate or craft messages related to these organizations. While we don’t have detailed insight into how the threat actor was using Make for these specific workflows, we can see that it was part of the process to automate specific functions.&nbsp;</p>

        <p dir="ltr"><em>Figure 8: Threat actor starts to rely on automated workflows</em></p>
        <p dir="ltr">The threat actor also appeared to be interested in other AI tools to help with data generation and writing. We saw multiple Google searches for “free ai no signup” and for “csv generator ai.” We also saw the threat actor using Toolbaz AI, which is a writing assistant; the CSV spreadsheet generator feature of DocsBot AI, which is an AI chatbot tool; and the AI data generator feature of Explo AI, which is an embedded analytics tool.</p>
        
        <h3 dir="ltr">Finding running instances of Evilginx</h3>
        <p dir="ltr">We saw evidence of the threat actor searching for running instances of the Evilginx man-in-the-middle attack framework using Censys, and then attempting to access those instances.</p>

        <p><img data-zoomable="" data-image-zoomable="true" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfhpZnkip4Xhwe_x_mbNvnxsQjN-fBnmhC4XMYD_lqlYAnZU1ZEw__A2tMULxs3KIGMZXgfxrpgOjzVos2GpV_jfwjUwmWuEwl_rlRe8SbPm26TmZ5Voqr4ADbhmSeRDFZNdPCbqw?key=6dcQwm6GIQlCTfuUoMFMyQ" alt="" width="100%"><em><br>Figure 9: Using Censys to search for running instances of Evilginx</em></p>

        <p dir="ltr">In addition to Evilginx, we also found evidence of multiple installed tools on the threat actor’s system—or, in some cases, an interest in tools based on the threat actor browser history. These tools included recon and attack tool GraphSpy, open source tool Bloodhound, the TeamFiltration framework used for enumeration and exfiltration, and more.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

        <h3 dir="ltr">Interest in residential proxy services</h3>
        <p dir="ltr">The Chrome browser history also revealed visits by the threat actor to multiple residential proxy webpages, including LunaProxy and Nstbrowser (which bills itself as an anti-detect browser and supports the use of residential proxies). The threat actor visited the pricing plan page for LunaProxy, researched specific products, and looked up quick start guides throughout May, June, and July. Residential proxy services have become increasingly popular with threat actors as a way to route their traffic through residential IP addresses, allowing them to obscure malicious activity, like avoiding suspicious login alerts while using compromised credentials.</p>

        <p><img data-zoomable="" data-image-zoomable="true" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXd01_NfMWLtwacDez_IZgwu1t-1_i3MNpywbE8BjlZkaY6SMuPaqVdzhbtvs3wlP4J00ZOH02YEJ09aBM07nRb3pCOwEBt2STmiEgQqva-RARySA_R2kh_eL5UM7QJMPe_4rLq4sQ?key=6dcQwm6GIQlCTfuUoMFMyQ" alt="" width="100%"><em><br>Figure 12: A VirusTotal lookup of LunaProxy.exe, which was in the Chrome history</em></p>


        
        <h2 id="research-and-recon-methods" dir="ltr">Research and recon methods</h2>
        <p dir="ltr">The Chrome browser history entries also gave us a close view of the attacker’s reconnaissance methods. The threat actor spent a lot of time researching companies across different sectors, from specific banks to “top real estate companies in the US” (also looking up “real estate agents in California”).&nbsp;</p>
        <p dir="ltr">The threat actor didn’t just search for individual companies—they also looked at all parts of the ecosystem surrounding organizations of interest, from their customer bases to associated third-party companies across the supply chain. For example, the threat actor appeared to start targeting software companies in early July, searching for these types of companies via Google Search and using database marketing tools like ReadyContacts and InfoClutch to scope out how many customers they had and their market share.&nbsp;</p>
        <p dir="ltr">The threat actor also used the BuiltWith platform, which lets users identify and analyze the technology stacks used by websites. On July 8, browser entries show the attacker conducting an extensive level of research on a prominent ecommerce vendor for managing payments and subscriptions, including a list of its customers, contacts, and market share. The threat actor then used BuiltWith to search for the websites relying on that vendor, before navigating to the BuiltWith sign up page, presumably to access that list.</p>
        <p dir="ltr">The threat actor conducted a fair amount of research into tools used to scrape Telegram group data, including looking at scraper tools like Apify, the Axiom Chrome extension, and the RapidAPI platform (Figure 13).</p>

        <p><img data-zoomable="" data-image-zoomable="true" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXd7IPUx5HRRyuk188k8TDxBwvLdcnS_xQ0efa1HRxh-KT1CAK6cRF0-l-0XO2Bg5T53OmZCbhrOUofNVXxT-GM7a7xX6aCLMLhrwyqN9Crfxkb8FbyVssOeM3OiDcr0XC4xKwUQ0Q?key=6dcQwm6GIQlCTfuUoMFMyQ" alt="" width="100%"><em><br>Figure 13: While researching data scraping tools the threat actor&nbsp;came across RapidAPI&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>


        
        <h2 id="use-of-google-translate" dir="ltr">Use of Google Translate</h2>
        <p dir="ltr">The threat actor used Google Translate extensively, and Chrome browser shows them first visiting bank websites, and then using the translation platform, likely to assist in crafting phishing-related messages, as seen in Figure 14.&nbsp;</p>

        <p><img data-zoomable="" data-image-zoomable="true" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXes_3NIeO_FSiOzccc9ZhFZC-bU1sKp9D4jkVF1axM-vFs6RZOXPeFGkFtmf35Cd40hlqII4hHoAYd5v_uk6CIaO4ctyXPbgxKE3cpTXl2ZVtvZJLogHPrXzyT0xZzgDw1eK7BJtw?key=6dcQwm6GIQlCTfuUoMFMyQ" alt="" width="100%"><em><br>Figure 14: The threat actor used Google Translate services extensively&nbsp;</em></p>



        <p dir="ltr">The attacker often used urlscan to get information about various websites. Tips appear to have come in via Telegram using the <a href="https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#getupdates" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">getUpdates</a> method.</p>

        <p dir="ltr">They started trying to run the Python script:</p>

        <p dir="ltr"><span>C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python313\python.exe main.py -h</span></p>
        <p dir="ltr">Then, they started to run it against the original victim whose cookie file we saw earlier:</p>

        <p dir="ltr">This is where our EDR data drops off, as they may have become aware of us and uninstalled the agent.</p>
        
        <h2 id="hours-worked-in-a-day" dir="ltr">Hours worked in a day</h2>
        <p dir="ltr">The attacker’s browser history gives us an unprecedented level of insight into their everyday activity, searches, workflows, research, and more. The browser history shows the threat actor working intensively almost every day between the period of May 29, 2025 through July 9, 2025.&nbsp;</p>

        <p dir="ltr">On many of these days, the browser entries were seen across most hours of the day, logging 12 to 14 hours. But there was some variation, as seen in Figure 29, above: on several days, the threat actor worked as little as one to two hours.</p>
        <p dir="ltr">When we hone in on a few of the days when the most hours were put in, we can see some of the things that piqued the attacker’s interest in those days. We analyzed the urls to see what businesses, or categories they might have fallen into, and then looked to see how many times the attacker visited these sites.&nbsp;</p>
        <p dir="ltr">We can see a few trends. During these days, the attacker spent a lot of time researching various banking entities and bank personnel. To further expand on some of the graph labels:</p>

        <p dir="ltr">We can see that from May 29 to June 1, 2025, the attacker was mostly looking at various banking websites. Digging further into their activities, you see them researching various banks, reading about Telegram Bots, then downloading a blueprint from Make.</p>

        <p dir="ltr">The next day, it seems that the attacker spent a little more time researching various attack infrastructure, in addition to focusing on banks, and similar activities seen previously.</p>

        <div dir="ltr"><p>The other interesting thing was that the attacker was mostly focused on banks and sites that were in Nigeria during this time period, even looking for things like:</p><p>“No. 1 regulated crypto exchange in Nigeria.”</p></div>
        <p dir="ltr">“top crypto companies nigeria”</p>
        <div dir="ltr"><p>“Best Crypto Exchanges in Nigeria”</p><p>“Top Cryptocurrency Companies in Nigeria”</p></div>
        <p dir="ltr">While we don’t know where the attacker is based, the machine they had installed our agent upon appeared to be based in the United States, on the West Coast, based on the machine’s internal time zone and IP address.</p>

        <p dir="ltr">It seems that the attacker had spent quite some time looking at our various capabilities after they had started a trial with us. Figure 36 above shows just how much more time they spent interacting with the Huntress website, and particularly the account dashboard once they had started the trial.</p>
        
        <h2 id="lessons-learned" dir="ltr">Lessons learned</h2>
        <p dir="ltr">This incident gave us in-depth information about the day-to-day activities of a threat actor, from the tools they were interested in to the ways they conducted research and approached different aspects of attacks.&nbsp;</p>
        <p dir="ltr">Upon confirming that the machine name was one used by an adversary, we decided to release these details because they give an invaluable understanding into the mindset and behaviors of threat actors behind attacks. For other defenders, we hope that this information can help add context around the ways that threat actors conduct research and launch attacks at the backend—and the different types of organizations, tools, and platforms that interest them.&nbsp;</p></div>

Ever since I’ve read that, I wanted to push his awesome idea to the logical extreme: Build a <strong>multiplayer</strong> DOOM-like shooter <strong>entirely</strong> in SQL with CedarDB doing all the heavy lifting.
During a month of parental leave (i.e., a lot of sleepless nights), I tried exactly that.</p><p>Here’s a sneak peek at DOOMQL:</p><video controls="">
<source src="https://cedardb.com/blog/doomql/doomql.mp4" type="video/mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video><p>DOOMQL in action</p><p>Okay, with the flashy demo out of the way, let’s talk about details.
What follows is a tour of the architecture, the SQL rendering pipeline, the game loop, and the fun metagame of cheating by issuing SQL commands against the database.</p></section><h2 id="why-even-do-this">Why even do this?</h2><section>Playing DuckDB DOOM in your browser is fun, but some things bugged me:
First of all, having parts of the rendering pipeline in Javascript felt like cheating. It worked well for DuckDB-Doom where everything is contained in a single HTML page, but I wanted to see if I could do everything in SQL. DuckDB-Doom is also a little bit stuttery with just 8 frames per second and has a pretty tiny viewport. I wanted to see if I could speed that up by switching over to CedarDB. I also wanted real sprites with transparency and they should move around believably in 3D space.
And most importantly, making the game multi-player should not just be possible, but easy, right? I got nerd-sniped by the perceived similarity of a database server to a traditional game server: <strong>Databases exist to synchronize shared state across clients.</strong> Thanks to transaction isolation, each player has a consistent view of the game world, no matter what the other clients are doing. Why not lean into that?
I would love to lie to you and claim I did it all to push CedarDB as an awesome database system but to be honest the database nerd in me just wanted to turn all knobs up to 11 and see what breaks.</section><h2 id="architectural-overview">Architectural overview</h2><section><p>At a high level</p><ul><li>State lives in tables (map, players, mobs, inputs, configs, sprites, …)</li><li>Rendering is a stack of SQL views that implement raycasting and sprite projection</li><li>The game loop is a tiny shell script that executes a SQL file ~ 30 times per second.</li><li>The client is ~ 150 lines of Python: It polls for input and queries the database for your 3D view.</li></ul><p>You can play, observe other players and even cheat (by sending raw SQL).</p></section><h2 id="game-state-or-lets-store-everything-in-the-database">Game state, or: Let’s store everything in the database</h2><section><p>With a database at hand, it’s natural to store all game configuration, state, and static data in the database:</p><p><strong>Config</strong>:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sql"><span><span><span>CREATE</span><span> </span><span>TABLE</span><span> </span>config(<span>

Well, we’ve got <code>VIEWS</code> in SQL as well. They’re also just views on our (2D) state tables.
What’s stopping us from quite <em>literally</em> building a 3D “view” of our 2D map
using a simple raycasting algorithm?</p><p>The pipeline:</p><ol><li>Send a set of rays from each player’s eye into the world, and see which map tiles are visible</li><li>Check which walls the player sees, rendering them at the correct height and more or less solid based on the distance</li><li>Project mobs into the player’s camera space</li><li>Select sprite LODs based on depth</li><li>Expand sprites into pixels, scaled to screen space</li><li>Occlude against walls and other sprites</li><li>Assemble frame buffer rows with <code>string_agg</code></li><li>Build a minimap reusing the visible tiles calculation from earlier</li><li>Combine the 3D view with minimap and HUD (HP/bullets/players) into a game view</li></ol><p>Let’s take a more in-depth look at steps 2, 7, and 8.</p></section><h3 id="raycasting">Raycasting</h3><section><p>The recursive ray‑marching logic is adapted from <a href="https://www.hey.earth/posts/duckdb-doom">Patrick’s DuckDB DOOM post</a>.

I don’t think any other database system can keep up with that.
Let me know if you find one!</p><p>You might worry that rendering the views of all players and filtering late would be very wasteful.
CedarDB’s query optimizer pushes the <code>where player_id = &lt;...&gt;</code> predicate through view boundaries, avoiding unncessary work.

<p>Yesterday <a href="https://www.aikido.dev/blog/npm-debug-and-chalk-packages-compromised">one of the biggest package ecosystems had very popular packages get compromised</a>. We're talking functionality like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Formatting text with colors for use in the terminal</li>
<li>A list of common color names and their RGB values</li>
<li>A decorator for functions so you can debug their inputs/outputs as they are run</li>
<li>A utility function that determines if its argument can be used like an array</li>
</ul>
<p>These kinds of dependencies are everywhere and nobody would even think that they could be harmful. Getting code into these packages means that it's almost guaranteed a free path to production deployments. If an open proxy server (a-la Bright Data or other botnets that the credit card network tolerates for some reason), API key stealer, or worse was sent through this chain of extreme luck on the attacker's part, then this would be a completely different story.</p>
<p>We all dodged a massive bullet because all the malware did was modify the destination addresses of cryptocurrency payments mediated via online wallets like <a href="https://metamask.io/">MetaMask</a>.</p>
<p>As someone adjacent to the online security community, I have a sick sense of appreciation for this attack. This was a really good attack. It started with a phishing email that I'd probably fall for if it struck at the right time:</p>
<figure><a href="https://files.xeiaso.net/blog/2025/we-dodged-a-bullet/the-email.jpg"><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="https://files.xeiaso.net/blog/2025/we-dodged-a-bullet/the-email.avif"><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://files.xeiaso.net/blog/2025/we-dodged-a-bullet/the-email.webp"><img loading="lazy" src="https://files.xeiaso.net/blog/2025/we-dodged-a-bullet/the-email.jpg"></picture></a></figure>
<p>This is frankly a really good phishing email. Breaking it down:</p>
<ul>
<li>It greets the user personally with their NPM username. This makes it look personalized, so people are more likely to trust it.</li>
<li>People are used to the idea of changing passwords for security. With that in mind, at a glance the idea of changing your two-factor auth credentials "for security reasons" isn't completely unreasonable.</li>
<li>NPM has always been kinda weird compared to other open source package repositories, so them requiring something strange like that reads as reasonable.</li>
<li>It sets a deadline a few days in the future. This creates a sense of urgency, and when you combine urgency with being rushed by life, you are much more likely to fall for the phishing link.</li>
<li>It links to a website (I'm assuming it's on npm.help), and that website is used to get the two-factor credentials somehow and then start publishing new packages with the exploit code.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a 10/10 phishing email. Looking at it critically the only part about it that stands out is the domain "npmjs.help" instead of "npmjs.com". Even then, that wouldn't really stand out to me because I've seen companies use new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_top-level_domain">generic top level domains</a> to separate out things like the blog at <code>.blog</code> or the docs at <code>.guide</code>, not to mention the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tokih_heres-your-builders-guide-to-new-activity-7315851665348141057-9oBM"><code>.new</code> stack</a>.</p>
<p>One of my friends <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/buttplug.engineer">qdot</a> also got the phishing email and here's what he had to say:</p>
<center><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:sfvpv6dfrug3rnjewn7gyx62/app.bsky.feed.post/3lyds45qxpc2i" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreigtonkqupqoprhrsosj6sf5sj5wmy6nseof5nx3mtrycsycw4pcxi" data-bluesky-embed-color-mode="system"><p>I got the email for it and was like "oh I'll deal with this
later".</p><p>Saved by procrastination!</p><p>— qdot (<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:sfvpv6dfrug3rnjewn7gyx62?ref_src=embed">
@buttplug.engineer
</a>) <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:sfvpv6dfrug3rnjewn7gyx62/post/3lyds45qxpc2i?ref_src=embed">September 8, 2025 at 2:04 PM</a></p></blockquote></center>
<p>With <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/is-arrayish">how</a> <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/color-string">widely</a> <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/color-name">used</a> these libraries are, this could have been <em>so much worse</em> than it was. I can easily imagine a timeline where this wasn't just a cryptocurrency interceptor. Imagine if something this widely deployed into an ecosystem where automated package bumping triggering production releases is common did API key theft. You'd probably have more OpenAI API keys than you know what you'd do with. You could probably go for years without having to pay for AWS again.</p>
<p>It is just maddening to me that a near Jia Tan level chain of malware and phishing was wasted on cryptocurrency interception that won't even run in the majority of places those compromised libraries were actually used. When I was bumping packages around these issues, I found that most of these libraries were used in command line tools.</p>
<p>This was an attack obviously targeted towards the Web 3 ecosystem as users of Web 3 tools are used to making payments with their browsers. With my black hat on, I think that the reason they targeted more generic packages instead of Web 3 packages was so that the compromise wouldn't be as noticed by the Web 3 ecosystem. Sure, you'd validate the rigging that helps you interface with Metamask, but you'd never think that it would get monkey-patched by your color value parsing library.</p>
<p>One of the important things to take away from this is that every dependency could be malicious. We should take the time to understand the entire dependency tree of our programs, but we aren't given that time. At the end of the day, we still have to ship things.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p><a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8259" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)</a>
is a simple data interchange format. Almost 15 years ago,
we wrote about <a href="https://go.dev/blog/json">support for JSON in Go</a>,
which introduced the ability to serialize and deserialize Go types to and from JSON data.
Since then, JSON has become the most popular data format used on the Internet.
It is widely read and written by Go programs,
and encoding/json now ranks as the 5th most imported Go package.</p>
<p>Over time, packages evolve with the needs of their users,
and <code>encoding/json</code> is no exception. This blog post is about Go 1.25’s new
experimental <code>encoding/json/v2</code> and <code>encoding/json/jsontext</code> packages,
which bring long-awaited improvements and fixes.
This post argues for a new major API version,
provides an overview of the new packages,
and explains how you can make use of it.
The experimental packages are not visible by default and
may undergo future API changes.</p>
<h2 id="problems-with-encodingjson">Problems with <code>encoding/json</code></h2>
<p>Overall, <code>encoding/json</code> has held up well.
The idea of marshaling and unmarshaling arbitrary Go types
with some default representation in JSON, combined with the ability to
customize the representation, has proven to be highly flexible.
However, in the years since its introduction,
various users have identified numerous shortcomings.</p>
<h3 id="behavior-flaws">Behavior flaws</h3>
<p>There are various behavioral flaws in <code>encoding/json</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Imprecise handling of JSON syntax</strong>: Over the years, JSON has seen
increased standardization in order for programs to properly communicate.
Generally, decoders have become stricter at rejecting ambiguous inputs,
to reduce the chance that two implementations will have different
(successful) interpretations of a particular JSON value.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>encoding/json</code> currently accepts invalid UTF-8,
whereas the latest Internet Standard (RFC 8259) requires valid UTF-8.
The default behavior should report an error in the presence of invalid UTF-8,
instead of introducing silent data corruption,
which may cause problems downstream.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>encoding/json</code> currently accepts objects with duplicate member names.
RFC 8259 does not specify how to handle duplicate names,
so an implementation is free to choose an arbitrary value,
merge the values, discard the values, or report an error.
The presence of a duplicate name results in a JSON value
without a universally agreed upon meaning.
This could be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avilmOcHKHE&amp;t=1057s" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">exploited by attackers in security applications</a>
and has been exploited before (as in <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-12635" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">CVE-2017-12635</a>).
The default behavior should err on the side of safety and reject duplicate names.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Leaking nilness of slices and maps</strong>: JSON is often used to communicate with
programs using JSON implementations that do not allow <code>null</code> to be unmarshaled
into a data type expected to be a JSON array or object.
Since <code>encoding/json</code> marshals a nil slice or map as a JSON <code>null</code>,
this may lead to errors when unmarshaling by other implementations.
<a href="https://go.dev/issue/63397#discussioncomment-7201222">A survey</a>
indicated that most Go users prefer that nil slices and maps
are marshaled as an empty JSON array or object by default.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Case-insensitive unmarshaling</strong>: When unmarshaling, a JSON object member name
is resolved to a Go struct field name using a case-insensitive match.
This is a surprising default, a potential security vulnerability, and a performance limitation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Inconsistent calling of methods</strong>: Due to an implementation detail,
<code>MarshalJSON</code> methods declared on a pointer receiver
are <a href="https://go.dev/issue/22967">inconsistently called by <code>encoding/json</code></a>. While regarded as a bug,
this cannot be fixed as too many applications depend on the current behavior.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="api-deficiencies">API deficiencies</h3>
<p>The API of <code>encoding/json</code> can be tricky or restrictive:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It is difficult to correctly unmarshal from an <code>io.Reader</code>.
Users often write <code>json.NewDecoder(r).Decode(v)</code>,
which fails to reject trailing junk at the end of the input.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Options can be set on the <code>Encoder</code> and <code>Decoder</code> types,
but cannot be used with the <code>Marshal</code> and <code>Unmarshal</code> functions.
Similarly, types implementing the <code>Marshaler</code> and <code>Unmarshaler</code> interfaces
cannot make use of the options and there is no way to plumb options down the call stack.
For example, the <code>Decoder.DisallowUnknownFields</code> option loses its effect
when calling a custom <code>UnmarshalJSON</code> method.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>Compact</code>, <code>Indent</code>, and <code>HTMLEscape</code> functions write to a <code>bytes.Buffer</code>
instead of something more flexible like a <code>[]byte</code> or <code>io.Writer</code>.
This limits the usability of those functions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="performance-limitations">Performance limitations</h3>
<p>Setting aside internal implementation details,
the public API commits it to certain performance limitations:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>MarshalJSON</strong>: The <code>MarshalJSON</code> interface method forces the implementation
to allocate the returned <code>[]byte</code>. Also, the semantics require that
<code>encoding/json</code> verify that the result is valid JSON
and also to reformat it to match the specified indentation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>UnmarshalJSON</strong>: The <code>UnmarshalJSON</code> interface method requires that
a complete JSON value be provided (without any trailing data).
This forces <code>encoding/json</code> to parse the JSON value to be unmarshaled
in its entirety to determine where it ends before it can call <code>UnmarshalJSON</code>.
Afterwards, the <code>UnmarshalJSON</code> method itself must parse the provided JSON value again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lack of streaming</strong>: Even though the <code>Encoder</code> and <code>Decoder</code> types operate
on an <code>io.Writer</code> or <code>io.Reader</code>, they buffer the entire JSON value in memory.
The <code>Decoder.Token</code> method for reading individual tokens is allocation-heavy
and there is no corresponding API for writing tokens.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, if the implementation of a <code>MarshalJSON</code> or <code>UnmarshalJSON</code> method
recursively calls the <code>Marshal</code> or <code>Unmarshal</code> function,
then the performance becomes quadratic.</p>
<h2 id="trying-to-fix-encodingjson-directly">Trying to fix <code>encoding/json</code> directly</h2>
<p>Introducing a new, incompatible major version of a package is a heavy consideration.
If possible, we should try to fix the existing package.</p>
<p>While it is relatively easy to add new features,
it is difficult to change existing features.
Unfortunately, these problems are inherent consequences of the existing API,
making them practically impossible to fix within the <a href="https://go.dev/doc/go1compat">Go 1 compatibility promise</a>.</p>
<p>We could in principle declare separate names, such as <code>MarshalV2</code> or <code>UnmarshalV2</code>,
but that is tantamount to creating a parallel namespace within the same package.
This leads us to <code>encoding/json/v2</code> (henceforth called <code>v2</code>),
where we can make these changes within a seperate <code>v2</code> namespace
in contrast to <code>encoding/json</code> (henceforth called <code>v1</code>).</p>
<h2 id="planning-for-encodingjsonv2">Planning for <code>encoding/json/v2</code></h2>
<p>The planning for a new major version of <code>encoding/json</code> spanned years.
In late 2020, spurred on by the inability to fix issues in the current package,
Daniel Martí (one of the maintainers of <code>encoding/json</code>) first drafted his
thoughts on <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WQGoM44HLinH4NGBEv5drGlw5_RNW-GP7DdGEpm7Y3o" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">what a hypothetical <code>v2</code> package should look like</a>.
Separately, after previous work on the <a href="https://go.dev/blog/protobuf-apiv2">Go API for Protocol Buffers</a>,
Joe Tsai was disapppointed that <a href="https://go.dev/pkg/google.golang.org/protobuf/encoding/protojson">the <code>protojson</code> package</a>
needed to use a custom JSON implementation because <code>encoding/json</code> was
neither capable of adhering to the stricter JSON standard that the
Protocol Buffer specification required,
nor of efficiently serializing JSON in a streaming manner.</p>
<p>Believing a brighter future for JSON was both beneficial and achievable,
Daniel and Joe joined forces to brainstorm on <code>v2</code> and
<a href="https://github.com/go-json-experiment/json" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">started to build a prototype</a>
(with the initial code being a polished version of the JSON serialization logic from the Go protobuf module).
Over time, a few others (Roger Peppe, Chris Hines, Johan Brandhorst-Satzkorn, and Damien Neil)
joined the effort by providing design review, code review, and regression testing.
Many of the early discussions are publicly available in our
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZgrQPcV8W8EChkaAvv-3NUu6PYmnGG3b" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">recorded meetings</a> and
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rovrOTd-wTawGMPPlPuKhwXaYBg9VszTXR9AQQL5LfI" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">meeting notes</a>.</p>
<p>This work has been public since the beginning,
and we increasingly involved the wider Go community,
first with a
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avilmOcHKHE" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">GopherCon talk</a> and
<a href="https://go.dev/issue/63397">discussion posted in late 2023</a>,
<a href="https://go.dev/issue/71497">formal proposal posted in early 2025</a>,
and most recently <a href="https://go.dev/issue/71845">adopting <code>encoding/json/v2</code> as a Go experiment</a>
(available in Go 1.25) for wider-scale testing by all Go users.</p>
<p>The <code>v2</code> effort has been going on for 5 years,
incorporating feedback from many contributors and also gaining valuable
empirical experience from use in production settings.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that it’s largely been developed and promoted by people
not employed by Google, demonstrating that the Go project is a collaborative endeavor
with a thriving global community dedicated to improving the Go ecosystem.</p>
<h2 id="building-on-encodingjsonjsontext">Building on <code>encoding/json/jsontext</code></h2>
<p>Before discussing the <code>v2</code> API, we first introduce the experimental
<a href="https://go.dev/pkg/encoding/json/jsontext"><code>encoding/json/jsontext</code></a> package
that lays the foundation for future improvements to JSON in Go.</p>
<p>JSON serialization in Go can be broken down into two primary components:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>syntactic functionality</em> that is concerned with processing JSON based on its grammar, and</li>
<li><em>semantic functionality</em> that defines the relationship between JSON values and Go values.</li>
</ul>
<p>We use the terms “encode” and “decode” to describe syntactic functionality and
the terms “marshal” and “unmarshal” to describe semantic functionality.
We aim to provide a clear distinction between functionality
that is purely concerned with encoding versus that of marshaling.</p>
<p><img src="https://go.dev/blog/jsonv2-exp/api.png" width="100%"></p><p>This diagram provides an overview of this separation.
Purple blocks represent types, while blue blocks represent functions or methods.
The direction of the arrows approximately represents the flow of data.
The bottom half of the diagram, implemented by the <code>jsontext</code> package,
contains functionality that is only concerned with syntax,
while the upper half, implemented by the <code>json/v2</code> package,
contains functionality that assigns semantic meaning to syntactic data
handled by the bottom half.</p>
<p>The basic API of <code>jsontext</code> is the following:</p>
<pre><code>package jsontext

type Encoder struct { ... }
func NewEncoder(io.Writer, ...Options) *Encoder
func (*Encoder) WriteValue(Value) error
func (*Encoder) WriteToken(Token) error

type Decoder struct { ... }
func NewDecoder(io.Reader, ...Options) *Decoder
func (*Decoder) ReadValue() (Value, error)
func (*Decoder) ReadToken() (Token, error)

type Kind byte
type Value []byte
func (Value) Kind() Kind
type Token struct { ... }
func (Token) Kind() Kind
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>jsontext</code> package provides functionality for interacting with JSON
at a syntactic level and derives its name from
<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8259#section-2" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">RFC 8259, section 2</a>
where the grammar for JSON data is literally called <code>JSON-text</code>.
Since it only interacts with JSON at a syntactic level,
it does not depend on Go reflection.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://go.dev/pkg/encoding/json/jsontext#Encoder"><code>Encoder</code></a> and
<a href="https://go.dev/pkg/encoding/json/jsontext#Decoder"><code>Decoder</code></a>
provide support for encoding and decoding JSON values and tokens.
The constructors
<a href="https://go.dev/pkg/encoding/json/jsontext#Options">accept variadic options</a>
that affect the particular behavior of encoding and decoding.
Unlike the <code>Encoder</code> and <code>Decoder</code> types declared in <code>v1</code>,
the new types in <code>jsontext</code> avoid muddling the distinction between syntax and
semantics and operate in a truly streaming manner.</p>
<p>A JSON value is a complete unit of data and is represented in Go as
<a href="https://go.dev/pkg/encoding/json/jsontext#Value">a named <code>[]byte</code></a>.
It is identical to <a href="https://go.dev/pkg/encoding/json#RawMessage"><code>RawMessage</code></a> in <code>v1</code>.
A JSON value is syntactically composed of one or more JSON tokens.
A JSON token is represented in Go as the <a href="https://go.dev/pkg/encoding/json/jsontext#Token">opaque <code>Token</code> type</a>
with constructors and accessor methods.
It is analogous to <a href="https://go.dev/pkg/encoding/json#Token"><code>Token</code></a> in <code>v1</code>
but is designed represent arbitrary JSON tokens without allocation.</p>
<p>To resolve the fundamental performance problems with
the <code>MarshalJSON</code> and <code>UnmarshalJSON</code> interface methods,
we need an efficient way of encoding and decoding JSON
as a streaming sequence of tokens and values.
In <code>v2</code>, we introduce the <code>MarshalJSONTo</code> and <code>UnmarshalJSONFrom</code> interface methods
that operate on an <code>Encoder</code> or <code>Decoder</code>, allowing the methods’ implementations
to process JSON in a purely streaming manner. Thus, the <code>json</code> package need not
be responsible for validating or formatting a JSON value returned by <code>MarshalJSON</code>,
nor would it need to be responsible for determining the boundaries of a JSON value
provided to <code>UnmarshalJSON</code>. These responsibilities belong to the <code>Encoder</code> and <code>Decoder</code>.</p>
<h2 id="introducing-encodingjsonv2">Introducing <code>encoding/json/v2</code></h2>
<p>Building on the <code>jsontext</code> package, we now introduce the experimental
<a href="https://go.dev/pkg/encoding/json/v2"><code>encoding/json/v2</code></a> package.
It is designed to fix the aforementioned problems,
while remaining familiar to users of the <code>v1</code> package.
Our goal is that usages of <code>v1</code> will operate <em>mostly</em> the same if directly migrated to <code>v2</code>.</p>
<p>In this article, we will primarily cover the high-level API of <code>v2</code>.
For examples on how to use it, we encourage readers to
study <a href="https://go.dev/pkg/encoding/json/v2#pkg-examples">the examples in the <code>v2</code> package</a> or
read <a href="https://antonz.org/go-json-v2/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Anton Zhiyanov’s blog covering the topic</a>.</p>
<p>The basic API of <code>v2</code> is the following:</p>
<pre><code>package json

func Marshal(in any, opts ...Options) (out []byte, err error)
func MarshalWrite(out io.Writer, in any, opts ...Options) error
func MarshalEncode(out *jsontext.Encoder, in any, opts ...Options) error

func Unmarshal(in []byte, out any, opts ...Options) error
func UnmarshalRead(in io.Reader, out any, opts ...Options) error
func UnmarshalDecode(in *jsontext.Decoder, out any, opts ...Options) error
</code></pre>
<p>The <a href="https://go.dev/pkg/encoding/json/v2#Marshal"><code>Marshal</code></a>
and <a href="https://go.dev/pkg/encoding/json/v2#Unmarshal"><code>Unmarshal</code></a> functions
have a signature similar to <code>v1</code>, but accept options to configure their behavior.
The <a href="https://go.dev/pkg/encoding/json/v2#MarshalWrite"><code>MarshalWrite</code></a>
and <a href="https://go.dev/pkg/encoding/json/v2#UnmarshalRead"><code>UnmarshalRead</code></a> functions
directly operate on an <code>io.Writer</code> or <code>io.Reader</code>,
avoiding the need to temporarily construct an <code>Encoder</code> or <code>Decoder</code>
just to write or read from such types.
The <a href="https://go.dev/pkg/encoding/json/v2#MarshalEncode"><code>MarshalEncode</code></a>
and <a href="https://go.dev/pkg/encoding/json/v2#UnmarshalDecode"><code>UnmarshalDecode</code></a> functions
operate on a <code>jsontext.Encoder</code> and <code>jsontext.Decoder</code> and
is actually the underlying implementation of the previously mentioned functions.
Unlike <code>v1</code>, options are a first-class argument to each of the marshal and unmarshal functions,
greatly extending the flexibility and configurability of <code>v2</code>.
There are <a href="https://go.dev/pkg/encoding/json/v2#Options">several options available</a>
in <code>v2</code> which are not covered by this article.</p>
<h3 id="type-specified-customization">Type-specified customization</h3>
<p>Similar to <code>v1</code>, <code>v2</code> allows types to define their own JSON representation
by satisfying particular interfaces.</p>
<pre><code>type Marshaler interface {
    MarshalJSON() ([]byte, error)
}
type MarshalerTo interface {
    MarshalJSONTo(*jsontext.Encoder) error
}

type Unmarshaler interface {
    UnmarshalJSON([]byte) error
}
type UnmarshalerFrom interface {
    UnmarshalJSONFrom(*jsontext.Decoder) error
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <a href="https://go.dev/pkg/encoding/json/v2#Marshaler"><code>Marshaler</code></a>
and <a href="https://go.dev/pkg/encoding/json/v2#Unmarshaler"><code>Unmarshaler</code></a> interfaces
are identical to those in <code>v1</code>.
The new <a href="https://go.dev/pkg/encoding/json/v2#MarshalerTo"><code>MarshalerTo</code></a>
and <a href="https://go.dev/pkg/encoding/json/v2#UnmarshalerFrom"><code>UnmarshalerFrom</code></a> interfaces
allow a type to represent itself as JSON using a <code>jsontext.Encoder</code> or <code>jsontext.Decoder</code>.
This allows options to be forwarded down the call stack, since options
can be retrieved via the <code>Options</code> accessor method on the <code>Encoder</code> or <code>Decoder</code>.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://go.dev/pkg/encoding/json/v2#example-package-OrderedObject">the <code>OrderedObject</code> example</a>
for how to implement a custom type that maintains the ordering of JSON object members.</p>
<h3 id="caller-specified-customization">Caller-specified customization</h3>
<p>In <code>v2</code>, the caller of <code>Marshal</code> and <code>Unmarshal</code> can also specify
a custom JSON representation for any arbitrary type,
where caller-specified functions take precedence over type-defined methods
or the default representation for a particular type.</p>
<pre><code>func WithMarshalers(*Marshalers) Options

type Marshalers struct { ... }
func MarshalFunc[T any](fn func(T) ([]byte, error)) *Marshalers
func MarshalToFunc[T any](fn func(*jsontext.Encoder, T) error) *Marshalers

func WithUnmarshalers(*Unmarshalers) Options

type Unmarshalers struct { ... }
func UnmarshalFunc[T any](fn func([]byte, T) error) *Unmarshalers
func UnmarshalFromFunc[T any](fn func(*jsontext.Decoder, T) error) *Unmarshalers
</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://go.dev/pkg/encoding/json/v2#MarshalFunc"><code>MarshalFunc</code></a> and
<a href="https://go.dev/pkg/encoding/json/v2#MarshalToFunc"><code>MarshalToFunc</code></a>
construct a custom marshaler that can be passed to a <code>Marshal</code> call
using <code>WithMarshalers</code> to override the marshaling of particular types.
Similarly,
<a href="https://go.dev/pkg/encoding/json/v2#UnmarshalFunc"><code>UnmarshalFunc</code></a> and

<p><a href="https://go.dev/pkg/encoding/json/v2#example-package-ProtoJSON">The <code>ProtoJSON</code> example</a>
demonstrates how this feature allows serialization of all
<a href="https://go.dev/pkg/google.golang.org/protobuf/proto#Message"><code>proto.Message</code></a> types
to be handled by the <a href="https://go.dev/pkg/google.golang.org/protobuf/encoding/protojson"><code>protojson</code></a> package.</p>
<h3 id="behavior-differences">Behavior differences</h3>
<p>While <code>v2</code> aims to behave <em>mostly</em> the same as <code>v1</code>,
its behavior has changed <a href="https://go.dev/pkg/github.com/go-json-experiment/json/v1#hdr-Migrating_to_v2">in some ways</a>
to address problems in <code>v1</code>, most notably:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>v2</code> reports an error in the presence of invalid UTF-8.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>v2</code> reports an error if a JSON object contains a duplicate name.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>v2</code> marshals a nil Go slice or Go map as an empty JSON array or JSON object, respectively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>v2</code> unmarshals a JSON object into a Go struct using a
case-sensitive match from the JSON member name to the Go field name.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>v2</code> redefines the <code>omitempty</code> tag option to omit a field if it would have
encoded as an “empty” JSON value (which are <code>null</code>, <code>""</code>, <code>[]</code>, and <code>{}</code>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>v2</code> reports an error when trying to serialize a <code>time.Duration</code>,
which currently has <a href="https://go.dev/issue/71631">no default representation</a>,
but provides options to let the caller decide.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For most behavior changes, there is a struct tag option or caller-specified option
that can configure the behavior to operate under <code>v1</code> or <code>v2</code> semantics,
or even other caller-determined behavior.
See <a href="https://go.dev/pkg/github.com/go-json-experiment/json/v1#hdr-Migrating_to_v2">“Migrating to v2”</a> for more information.</p>
<h3 id="performance-optimizations">Performance optimizations</h3>
<p>The <code>Marshal</code> performance of <code>v2</code> is roughly at parity with <code>v1</code>.
Sometimes it is slightly faster, but other times it is slightly slower.
The <code>Unmarshal</code> performance of <code>v2</code> is significantly faster than <code>v1</code>,
with benchmarks demonstrating improvements of up to 10x.</p>
<p>In order to obtain greater performance gains,
existing implementations of
<a href="https://go.dev/pkg/encoding/json/v2#Marshaler"><code>Marshaler</code></a> and
<a href="https://go.dev/pkg/encoding/json/v2#Unmarshaler"><code>Unmarshaler</code></a> should
migrate to also implement
<a href="https://go.dev/pkg/encoding/json/v2#MarshalerTo"><code>MarshalerTo</code></a> and
<a href="https://go.dev/pkg/encoding/json/v2#UnmarshalerFrom"><code>UnmarshalerFrom</code></a>,
so that they can benefit from processing JSON in a purely streaming manner.
For example, recursive parsing of OpenAPI specifications in <code>UnmarshalJSON</code> methods
significantly hurt performance in a particular service of Kubernetes
(see <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-openapi/issues/315" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">kubernetes/kube-openapi#315</a>),
while switching to <code>UnmarshalJSONFrom</code> improved performance by orders of magnitude.</p>
<p>For more information, see the
<a href="https://github.com/go-json-experiment/jsonbench" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>go-json-experiment/jsonbench</code></a>
repository.</p>
<h2 id="retroactively-improving-encodingjson">Retroactively improving <code>encoding/json</code></h2>
<p>We want to avoid two separate JSON implementations in the Go standard library,
so it is critical that, under the hood, <code>v1</code> is implemented in terms of <code>v2</code>.</p>
<p>There are several benefits to this approach:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Gradual migration</strong>: The <code>Marshal</code> and <code>Unmarshal</code> functions in <code>v1</code> or <code>v2</code>
represent a set of default behaviors that operate according to <code>v1</code> or <code>v2</code> semantics.
Options can be specified that configure <code>Marshal</code> or <code>Unmarshal</code> to operate with
entirely <code>v1</code>, mostly <code>v1</code> with a some <code>v2</code>, a mix of <code>v1</code> or <code>v2</code>,
mostly <code>v2</code> with some <code>v1</code>, or entirely <code>v2</code> semantics.
This allows for gradual migration between the default behaviors of the two versions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Feature inheritance</strong>: As backward-compatible features are added to <code>v2</code>,
they will inherently be made available in <code>v1</code>. For example, <code>v2</code> adds
support for several new struct tag options such as <code>inline</code> or <code>format</code> and also
support for the <code>MarshalJSONTo</code> and <code>UnmarshalJSONFrom</code> interface methods,
which are both more performant and flexible.
When <code>v1</code> is implemented in terms of <code>v2</code>, it will inherit support for these features.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reduced maintenance</strong>: Maintenance of a widely used package demands significant effort.
By having <code>v1</code> and <code>v2</code> use the same implementation, the maintenance burden is reduced.
In general, a single change will fix bugs, improve performance, or add functionality to both versions.
There is no need to backport a <code>v2</code> change with an equivalent <code>v1</code> change.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>While select parts of <code>v1</code> may be deprecated over time (supposing <code>v2</code> graduates from being an experiment),
the package as a whole will never be deprecated.
Migrating to <code>v2</code> will be encouraged, but not required.
The Go project will not drop support for <code>v1</code>.</p>
<h2 id="experimenting-with-jsonv2">Experimenting with <code>jsonv2</code></h2>
<p>The newer API in the <code>encoding/json/jsontext</code> and <code>encoding/json/v2</code> packages are not visible by default.
To use them, build your code with <code>GOEXPERIMENT=jsonv2</code> set in your environment or with the <code>goexperiment.jsonv2</code> build tag.
The nature of an experiment is that the API is unstable and may change in the future.
Though the API is unstable, the implementation is of a high quality and
has been successfully used in production by several major projects.</p>
<p>The fact that <code>v1</code> is implemented in terms of <code>v2</code> means that the underlying implementation of <code>v1</code>
is completely different when building under the <code>jsonv2</code> experiment.
Without changing any code, you should be able to run your tests
under <code>jsonv2</code> and theoretically nothing new should fail:</p>
<pre><code>GOEXPERIMENT=jsonv2 go test ./...
</code></pre>
<p>The re-implementation of <code>v1</code> in terms of <code>v2</code> aims to provide identical behavior
within the bounds of the <a href="https://go.dev/doc/go1compat">Go 1 compatibility promise</a>,
though some differences might be observable such as the exact wording of error messages.
We encourage you to run your tests under <code>jsonv2</code> and
report any regressions <a href="https://go.dev/issues">on the issue tracker</a>.</p>
<p>Becoming an experiment in Go 1.25 is a significant milestone on the road to
formally adopting <code>encoding/json/jsontext</code> and <code>encoding/json/v2</code> into the standard library.
However, the purpose of the <code>jsonv2</code> experiment is to gain broader experience.
Your feedback will determine our next steps, and the outcome of this experiment,
which may result in anything from abandonment of the effort, to adoption as stable packages of Go 1.26.
Please share your experience on <a href="https://go.dev/issue/71497">go.dev/issue/71497</a>, and help determine the future of Go.</p>

                                        <p>WASHINGTON (AP) — A decade-long slide in high schoolers’ reading and <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/math-science-stem-girls-a80f44c20b1724bba6953756ecc862cd">math</a></span> performance persisted during the COVID-19 pandemic, with 12th graders’ scores dropping to their lowest level in more than 20 years, according to results released Tuesday from an exam known as the nation’s report card.</p><p>Eighth-grade students also lost significant ground in science skills, according to the results from the National Assessment of Education Progress.</p><p>The assessments were the first since the pandemic for eighth graders in science and 12th graders in reading and math. They reflect a <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/naep-test-scores-nations-report-card-school-60150156e41b8518be3b6eabf77d0c66">downward drift</a></span> across grade levels and subject areas in previous releases from NAEP, which is considered one of the best gauges of the academic progress of U.S. schools.</p><p>“Scores for our lowest-performing students are at historic lows,” said Matthew Soldner, the acting commissioner of the National Center for Education Statistics. “These results should galvanize all of us to take concerted and focused action to accelerate student learning.”</p>
    
<p>While the pandemic had an outsize impact on student achievement, experts said falling scores are part of a longer arc in education that cannot be attributed solely to COVID-19, <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/online-school-covid-learning-loss-7c162ec1b4ce4d5219d5210aaac8f1ae">school closures</a></span> and related issues such as heightened <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/school-attendance-sick-day-chronic-absenteeism-270f6d07041760e90bf84d9f4108aa4d">absenteeism</a></span>. Educators said potential underlying factors include children’s increased screen time, shortened attention spans and a decline in reading longer-form writing both in and out of school.</p>



<p>The dip in reading scores appeared alongside a shift in how English and language arts are taught in schools, with an emphasis on <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/books-reading-high-school-english-class-c8d9f39773268a6e8c79cb0b3c78d3c1">short texts and book excerpts</a></span>, said Carol Jago, associate director of the California Reading and Literature Project at UCLA. As a high school English teacher 20 years ago, Jago said it was common for her high school students to read 20 books over the course of a year. Now, some English classes are assigning just three books a year.</p>
    
    
    
<p>“To be a good reader, you have to have the stamina to stay on the page, even when the going gets tough,” Jago said. “You have to build those muscles, and we’re not building those muscles in kids.”</p>
    
    
    

    
<p>Education Secretary Linda McMahon said the scores show why the Trump administration wants to <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-education-department-scotus-layoffs-student-loans-f24637f2a1d57432f6dc24d082e95b9b">give states more control</a></span> of education spending.</p><p>“Despite spending billions annually on numerous K-12 programs, the achievement gap is widening, and more high school seniors are performing below the basic benchmark in math and reading than ever before,” McMahon said.</p><p>House Democrats said the Trump administration’s efforts to dismantle the Education Department will only hurt students. The declines show a need for federal investment in academic recovery and educational equity, said Democratic Rep. Bobby Scott of Virginia, ranking member of the House Committee on Education and Workforce.</p><p>“Eliminating the very agency responsible for supporting public schools and enforcing civil rights protections of students will only deepen the achievement gaps identified by this assessment,” Scott said.</p>
    
<h2>Fewer students show basic proficiency in math and reading</h2><p>The test scores show more students are not reaching what would be considered “basic” achievement across subject areas, said Lesley Muldoon, executive director of the National Assessment Governing Board. While NAEP’s definition of “proficient” is a high bar, Muldoon said, it is not an unreasonable one, and it is based on what researchers believe students should be able to achieve by the end of high school.</p><p>“These students are taking their next steps in life with fewer skills and less knowledge in core academics than their predecessors a decade ago,” she said. “This is happening at a time when rapid advancements in technology and society demands more of future workers and citizens, not less.”</p><p>In reading, the average score in 2024 was the lowest score in the history of the assessment, which began in 1992. Thirty-two percent of high school seniors scored below “basic,” meaning they were not able to find details in a text to help them understand its meaning.</p><p>In math, the average score in 2024 was the lowest since 2005, when the assessment framework changed significantly. On the test, 45% of high school seniors scored below “basic” achievement, the highest percentage since 2005. Only 33% of high school seniors were considered academically prepared for college-level math courses, a decline from 37% in 2019.</p>
    
<p>The high school reading and math assessments, and the eighth grade science test, are given less frequently than the biannual fourth and eighth grade reading tests, which were last released earlier this year. The new scores reflect tests taken in schools around the country between January and March 2024.</p>
    
<h2>Achievement gaps are widening</h2><p>The gap between the highest- and lowest-performing students was its widest ever among eighth grade science students, reflecting growing inequality in the American school system. The achievement gap widened also in 12th grade math.</p><p>The scores also reflect the re-emergence of a <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/math-science-stem-girls-a80f44c20b1724bba6953756ecc862cd">gender gap</a></span> in science, technology, engineering and math courses. In 2019, boys and girls scored virtually the same on the NAEP science assessment. But in 2024, girls saw a steeper decline in scores. A similar pattern occurred in state math assessments, according to an Associated Press analysis.</p><p>Schools had largely closed the gender gap in math and science, but it widened in the years following the pandemic as special programs to engage girls lapsed.</p><p>On a NAEP survey of students, a shrinking percentage of eighth grade students said they regularly took part in inquiry-based learning activities in the classroom. The pandemic disrupted schools’ ability to create those hands-on learning experiences for students, which are often critical to understanding scientific concepts and processes, said Christine Cunningham, senior vice president of STEM learning at the Museum of Science in Boston.</p><p>Still, she noted declines across subjects began well before schools closed in 2020.</p><p>“We don’t know exactly what the cause of it is, but it would be incomplete to assume that if we hadn’t had COVID, the score would not have gone down,” Cunningham said. “That’s not what the data showed even before the pandemic.” ___</p><p>Feathers reported from New York.</p><p>___</p><p>The Associated Press’ education coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

			</div><div><p>SANTA FE — Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham and the New Mexico Early Childhood Education and Care Department announced a historic milestone on Monday: New Mexico will become the first state in the nation to guarantee no-cost universal child care starting Nov. 1.</p>
<p>This groundbreaking new initiative will make child care available to all New Mexicans, regardless of income, by removing income eligibility requirements from the state’s child care assistance program and continuing the waiver of family copayments.</p>
<p>“Child care is essential to family stability, workforce participation, and New Mexico’s future prosperity,” said Lujan Grisham. “By investing in universal child care, we are giving families financial relief, supporting our economy, and ensuring that every child has the opportunity to grow and thrive.”</p>
<p>This announcement fulfills the promise made by the governor and the New Mexico Legislature when they created the Early Childhood Education and Care Department in 2019. Since then, New Mexico has expanded access to no-cost child care to families with incomes at or below 400% of the federal poverty level, reducing financial strain on tens of thousands of families.</p>
<p>With Monday’s announcement universal child care will be extended to every family in the state, regardless of income. This amounts to an average annual family savings of $12,000 per child.</p>
<p>“New Mexico is creating the conditions for better outcomes in health, learning, and well-being,” said Neal Halfon, professor of pediatrics, public health and public policy at the University of California, Los Angeles, and director of the Center for Healthier Children, Families, and Communities. “Its approach is rooted in data, driven by communities, and becoming a model for the nation.</p>
<p>“By prioritizing public investments in early childhood educators, families, and children, New Mexico continues to lead the way in building a sustainable, affordable, and quality child care and early learning system that helps its communities and economy thrive,” said Michelle Kang, president and CEO of the National Association of the Education of Young Children (NAEYC). “Achieving universal child care will make a huge difference for the state’s children, families, businesses, and educators—and for all of us, by showing that it can be done.”</p>
<p>Families who receive child care assistance report greater financial stability, more time to focus on their children, and the ability to choose higher-quality care settings. Now, every family in New Mexico will have the same opportunity. New Mexico is also taking decisive action to build the supply of infant and toddler care statewide:</p>
<ul>
<li>Establishing a $12.7 million low-interest loan fund to construct, expand, and renovate child care facilities, with an additional $20 million requested in the Fiscal Year 2027 budget.</li>
<li>Targeting growth to focus on care for infants, toddlers, low-income families, and children with special needs.</li>
<li>Partnering with employers and school districts to expand child care options for working families.</li>
<li>Launching a statewide campaign to recruit licensed and registered home providers.</li>
<li><span>To support providers, reimbursement rates will rise to reflect the true cost of care.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Programs that commit to paying entry-level staff a minimum of $18 per hour and offer 10 hours of care per day, five days a week, will receive an incentive rate. New Mexico estimates an additional 5,000 early childhood professionals are needed to fully achieve a universal system.</p>
<p>“Early childhood care and education is a public good,” said ECECD Sec. Elizabeth Groginsky. “By providing universal access and improving pay for our early childhood workforce, we are easing financial pressure on families, strengthening our economy, and helping every child learn in safe, nurturing environments. This is the kind of investment that builds equity today and prosperity for the future.”</p>
<p>With universal child care, New Mexico is leading the nation by showing that what is best for children and families is also the smartest investment for long-term prosperity—building a stronger future for every community in the state.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p dir="auto">The DuckDB distribution for <a href="http://node.js/" rel="nofollow">Node.js</a> on <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/" rel="nofollow">npm</a> was compromised with malware (along with <a href="https://www.aikido.dev/blog/npm-debug-and-chalk-packages-compromised" rel="nofollow">several other packages</a>). An attacker published new versions of four of duckdb’s packages that included <strong>malicious code to interfere with cryptocoin transactions</strong>. The following packages and versions are affected:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>@duckdb/node-api@1.3.3</code></li>
<li><code>@duckdb/node-bindings@1.3.3</code></li>
<li><code>duckdb@1.3.3</code></li>
<li><code>@duckdb/duckdb-wasm@1.29.2</code></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Note: The current release version of DuckDB is 1.3.2, with 1.4.0 expected to be released on Sept 10th, 2025 (tomorrow as of this writing). We do not plan to ever release a “legit” DuckDB 1.3.3. Users should double-check that they are not accidentally updating to those affected versions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">We have ourselves noticed this <em>within four hours</em> of it happening. Here’s our response:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>As an immediate response, we have <strong>deprecated</strong> the specific versions.</li>
<li>We have reached out to npm support to <strong>delete the affected versions</strong>. They were so kind to do so.</li>
<li>We have also <strong>re-released</strong> the node packages with higher version numbers (1.3.4/1.30.0) as a further safeguard so the latest version of the package points to a safe version</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">We apologize for this issue. We are reviewing our internal processes to ensure the safety of future releases.</p>
<h3 dir="auto">Postmortem</h3>
<p dir="auto">On September 8th (Monday), the DuckDB maintainers received the following message from "<a href="mailto:...@npmjs.help">...@npmjs.help</a>":</p>

He followed the link (now defunct) to a website hosted under the domain <code>npmjs.help</code>. This website contained a <strong>pixel-perfect copy</strong> of the <a href="http://npmjs.com/" rel="nofollow">npmjs.com</a> website. He logged in using the <code>duckdb_admin</code> user and password, followed by 2FA. Again, the user profile, settings etc. were a perfect copy of the <a href="http://npmjs.com/" rel="nofollow">npmjs.com</a> website including all user data. As requested by the email, he then re-set the 2FA setup.</p>
<p dir="auto">In the background, the copycat website forwarded all actions to the actual npm website, so the 2FA was actually updated there, too. But they also added a new API token, which they then used to publish the malicious package versions. In hindsight, the fact that his browser did not auto-complete the login should have been a red flag. It's painful to spell out, but <strong>we fell for a classic phishing attack</strong>.</p>
<p dir="auto">We again apologize for this mishap. We are reviewing our internal processes to ensure the safety of future releases. It is fortunate that we noticed this within a few hours of it happening. The DuckDBLabs team was able to set up a call at 7AM to perform an immediate response. Fortunately we were not locked out of our NPM account, which also easily could have happened. We were able to rotate passwords, tokens and API keys immediately.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://github.com/naugtur/running-qix-malware">https://github.com/naugtur/running-qix-malware</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45179889">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text"><p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">You too can run malware from NPM (I mean without consequences)</h2><a id="user-content-you-too-can-run-malware-from-npm-i-mean-without-consequences" aria-label="Permalink: You too can run malware from NPM (I mean without consequences)" href="#you-too-can-run-malware-from-npm-i-mean-without-consequences"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Phishing NPM package authors continues, unsurprisingly.
The stakes are not high enough to switch from phishing to anything more advanced (like <a href="https://xkcd.com/538/" rel="nofollow">https://xkcd.com/538/</a>) but seeing article blurbs say "Supply chain Attack" next to "These packages generally receive 2-3 billion downloads per week." might finally be enough to make an impression, one hopes.</p>
<p dir="auto">This is not a detailed analysis of the attack, there's plenty of that already. If you're looking for one, visit our friends at <a href="https://socket.dev/blog/npm-author-qix-compromised-in-major-supply-chain-attack" rel="nofollow">https://socket.dev/blog/npm-author-qix-compromised-in-major-supply-chain-attack</a></p>
<p dir="auto">Instead, let's look at how you could have a compromised dependency like that get into your app and be stopped.</p>
<p dir="auto">One of the compromised packages was <code>is-arrayish</code> and I'll use that as an example going forward.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">What the malware does</h2><a id="user-content-what-the-malware-does" aria-label="Permalink: What the malware does" href="#what-the-malware-does"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">So if an app uses <code>is-arrayish</code> in the browser, it will override <code>fetch</code>, <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> and <code>window.ethereum.request</code> and whenever it finds a transaction being sent, it'll replace the target address with one of the malware author's addresses that looks most alike.</p>
<p dir="auto">I won't go into this either, but you can take a look at the summary of "donations" some other friends linked to here: <a href="https://intel.arkm.com/explorer/entity/61fbc095-f19b-479d-a037-5469aba332ab" rel="nofollow">https://intel.arkm.com/explorer/entity/61fbc095-f19b-479d-a037-5469aba332ab</a></p>
<p dir="auto">Pretty low impact for an attack this big. Some of it seems to be people mocking the malware author with worthless transfers.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Let's see it in action</h2><a id="user-content-lets-see-it-in-action" aria-label="Permalink: Let's see it in action" href="#lets-see-it-in-action"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Say we have an app.
The app allows the user to send a meaningless transaction to themselves. Don't expect it to make sense.
It also uses <code>is-arrayish</code> because otherwise we'd have nothing to demo.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="const isArrayish = require(&quot;is-arrayish&quot;);

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <i>9/8/2025</i>
    
    <p>CRDTs. Data structures that can be replicated across multiple nodes, edited independently, merged back together, and it all just works. But collaborative document editing and multiplayer TODO lists are just the tip of the iceberg - I believe the big application is distributed databases, and for that we need to talk about consistency.</p>
<p>CRDTs are a tool for <strong>Strong Eventual Consistency</strong>. Let's start with the definition of normal Eventual Consistency<sup><a id="footnote-ref-1" href="#footnote-1" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup>:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Eventual Delivery</dt>
  <dd>An update delivered to one node will <i>eventually</i> reaches all nodes</dd>
  
  <dt>Eventual Convergence</dt>
  <dd>If two nodes have seen all the same updates, they will <i>eventually</i> have the same state.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Strong Eventual Consistency (SEC) replaces <em>Eventual Convergence</em> with <em>Strong Convergence</em>:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Strong Convergence</dt>
  <dd>If two nodes have seen all the same updates, they will have the same state.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Spot the difference! In SEC two replicas have the same state as soon as the updates are processed, not <em>eventually</em>. If multiple nodes are updated independently, there will be conflicts - this is inevitable. What SEC guarantees is that these conflicts are solved automatically and deterministically.</p>
<p>This has massive implications. SEC means low latency, because nodes don't need to coordinate to handle reads and writes. It means incredible fault tolerance - every single node in the system bar one could simultaneously crash, and reads and writes could still happen normally. And it means nodes still function properly if they're offline or split from the network for arbitrary time periods.</p>
<p>Strong Eventual Consistency is Eventual Consistency that works. If you're doing local first, or low latency geo-replicated systems - accept no substitute. This is the context I think we should see CRDTs in - building blocks of Strongly Eventually Consistent systems. CRDTs as application state as one thing, CRDTs as entire databases are quite another.</p>

<time datetime="2025-09-08">Sep 8, 2025</time>



(<a href="http://maurycyz.com/tags/programming">Programming</a>) 



<p>Internet ads are horrible:
They waste your time, and the advertising industry makes the internet a worse place.
Payouts are so small that the only way to survive is to turn your site into an ad filled hellhole with no real substance.</p>
<p>If you want to support your favorite authors: send then money.
A dollar helps more then viewing ads ever would.</p>
<p>However, most people see advertising as a part of the internet experience, which is why I added this message to my site:</p>

<ad-note id="box">
<ad-note-content-wrapper>
No adblocker detected. Consider using an extension like <a href="https://ublockorigin.com/">uBlock Origin</a> to save time and bandwidth. <u>Click here to close.</u>
</ad-note-content-wrapper>
</ad-note>
<p>It’s shown off to the side, and never covers content.
It won’t be shown if there isn’t enough space.
The close button actually works and it stays closed.</p>
<p>The specific recommendation is important because a lot of people have only <em>heard of adblockers from ads</em>.
Commercial adblockers range from sketchy to outright scams:
If they are paying to be promoted, they must expect to make money from users.</p>
<h2 id="technical-details">Technical details:</h2>
<p>The page itself contains a div to hold the message and tries to load a script called “nativeads.js”:</p>

</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Finally, there’s a bit of CSS to make it look nice:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="css"><span><span>#ad-note-hidden<span>,</span> #ad-note {
</span></span><span><span>        <span>display</span>: <span>none</span>;

</span></span><span><span>        #ad-note {
</span></span><span><span>                <span>display</span>: <span>block</span>;
</span></span><span><span>                <span>position</span>: <span>fixed</span>;
</span></span><span><span>                <span>bottom</span>: <span>1</span><span>em</span>;
</span></span><span><span>                <span>right</span>: <span>1</span><span>em</span>;

</span></span><span><span>                <span>background-color</span>: <span>#111111</span>;
</span></span><span><span>                <span>padding</span>: <span>1</span><span>em</span>;
</span></span><span><span>        }

</span></span><span><span>                <span>margin-bottom</span>: <span>0</span><span>em</span>;
</span></span><span><span>        }
</span></span><span><span>}}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The message won’t be visible if an adblocker removes the &lt;div&gt; element – which has a lot of ad-like class names – or
blocks the network request for “nativeads.js”.</p>
<p>The network request ensures that it doesn’t miss blockers like uBlock Origin Lite, which by default will only filter network requests, not page content.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I have no way to detect DNS based blocking short of loading an actual ad.
Instead, I made the message unobtrusive and easy to close.</p>
<p>The message won’t be shown in browsers that don’t support JavaScript, because those don’t need adblockers to begin with.
It should be functional without CSS, but I can’t think of any browsers that support JS but not CSS.
(but if you use external CSS, it’s quite common for the request to fail resulting in an unstyled page.)</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://stefanbohacek.com/project/detect-missing-adblocker-wordpress-plugin/">Stefan Bohacek</a> for the original idea. I’ve modified it to reduce false positives and explicitly scoped the cookie so the message is only shown once.</p>
