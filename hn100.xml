The “majority” of the new users on the decentralized social network are from the US, Wang says. The app is currently the number two free social networking app in the US App Store, only trailing Meta’s Threads.</p><div><p>People posting on Threads, on the other hand, have raised complaints about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/7/24264382/threads-engagement-bait-problem-mosseri-meta">engagement bait</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/11/24267898/mosseri-acknowledges-mistakes-threads-instagram-broken-moderation">moderation issues</a>, and, as of late, misinformation, <a href="https://www.usermag.co/p/metas-threads-overrun-with-liberal-election-fraud-conspiracies">reports Taylor Lorenz</a>.

<p>This blog post was written together with <a href="https://mclare.blog/">&lt;mclare&gt;</a>, who made coooool visualizations like the picture at the end of the post!</p>
<h2 id="whats-a-bus-factor-or-truck-factor">What’s a Bus Factor or Truck Factor?</h2>
<p>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor">wikipedia</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The “bus factor” is the minimum number of team members that have to suddenly disappear from a project before the project stalls due to lack of knowledgeable or competent personnel.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>
<p>In 2015 or so, my employer had layoffs.
One of them was the only contributor to part of the codebase that made money for our company.
I remembered reading about <a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?TruckNumber">Truck Number</a> on the original wiki, so I thought it’d be fun to write a github enterprise plugin that calculates who you can’t afford to fire.
I enjoy reading research papers, and found this <a href="http://aserg.labsoft.dcc.ufmg.br/truckfactor/">truck factor</a> research paper.</p>
<p>I started writing the plugin, and talked five minutes on it at our Thursday afternoon lightning talks.
My coworkers said it would immediately hit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law">Goodhart’s Law</a>. They saw this as a way for management to easily calculate who you <strong>can</strong> fire!</p>
<h2 id="what">What?</h2>
<p>The original authors calculated how many people had to be hit by a bus for a bunch of popular GitHub projects to stall.
This includes the Linux kernel among others. In the first preprint, they said 80 people would have to leave the project for Linux to stop.</p>
<p>Last week I mentioned this blog post idea to mclare, and she said we should try to reproduce the results and see if the truck factor has improved in the past ten years.</p>
<p>The authors’ <a href="https://github.com/aserg-ufmg/Truck-Factor">github repo</a> is available and still works!</p>
<h2 id="are-we-able-to-reproduce-the-results">Are we able to reproduce the results?</h2>
<p>The Truck Factor research paper links to a <a href="https://github.com/aserg-ufmg/Truck-Factor">github repository</a>!
The data from the paper is available as JSON!
Their <a href="http://aserg.labsoft.dcc.ufmg.br/truckfactor/target.html">visualization</a> is backed by a CSV we can scrape!</p>
<p>But, we don’t know the <strong>date</strong> they pulled the data.</p>
<p>The README instructions don’t quite work, and we spent an hour figuring out how to execute the pieces.
Fortunately, the issues on the github repository told us how to fix the problem. I wanted results, not an afternoon of debugging their use of awk in shell scripts.
mclare got the list of github repos out of the first column of their CSV. We needed to clone them all!
We had fun learning about <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/">gnu parallel</a> to run a bunch of git clone commands at the same time.</p>
<h3 id="gnu-parallel">Gnu Parallel</h3>
<p>Why does <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/">gnu parallel</a> use <strong>all</strong> the cores when we tell it to use only 8?
We only saw eight <code>git clone</code> processes at a time, but a large number of <code>git index-pack</code> processes that maxed out all 32 cores on my laptop.
I’m guessing git’s index-pack is a forked subprocess and allows parallel to start another git clone?
If you know the answer, send us a message!</p>
<h3 id="ruby-gems-in-nixos">Ruby Gems in NixOS</h3>
<p>The Truck Factor code uses <a href="https://github.com/github-linguist/linguist">linguist</a> to filter out files that are only documentation. Later in the paper the authors say that documentation is the best way to keep your project alive, so I’m not convinced that’s good.</p>
<p>In any case, I’m running NixOS and have no experience with Ruby, thus installing Ruby Gems did not fit in the time I had.
If you know a good way to install the linguist plugin in a Nix flake, please send me a message! (or even a <a href="https://github.com/spite-driven-development/Truck-Factor">pull request</a>)</p>
<h2 id="but-how-did-you-recalculate-the-results">But, <strong>how</strong> did you recalculate the results?</h2>
<p>We forked the original repository on github, cloned it locally, and puzzled our way through the README.
We used <code>mvn package</code> to compile the Java source into a jar, and tried each of the steps on the numpy github repository.
Then we were ready to recalculate all the things.</p>
<p>mclare downloaded the CSV from the authors’ <a href="http://aserg.labsoft.dcc.ufmg.br/truckfactor/target.html">visualization</a> and we converted the first column into a <a href="https://github.com/spite-driven-development/Truck-Factor/blob/master/meta/repo_list.txt">list of github repositories</a>.
I started with a for loop, but mclare switched to gnu parallel, because it’s cool. Also because everything gets done faster.</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><span># clone the repositories</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2"><span>parallel</span> <span>-j</span> 8 git clone ::: <span>$(</span><span>cat</span> ../meta/repo_list.txt<span>)</span></span>
<span id="cb1-3"><span># change into the directory so you don't get the awk error</span></span>
<span id="cb1-4"><span>cd</span> gittruckfactor/scripts</span>
<span id="cb1-5"><span># scrape out all the git commit info</span></span>
<span id="cb1-6"><span>for</span> x <span>in</span> ../../repos/<span>*</span><span>;</span> <span>do</span> <span>./commit_log_script.sh</span> <span>$x</span><span>;</span> <span>done</span><span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb1-7"><span># run the java code that ingests the scraped commit data</span></span>
<span id="cb1-8"><span>for</span> x <span>in</span> ../repos/<span>*</span><span>;</span> <span>do</span> <span>dirname</span> <span>$x</span> <span>&gt;&gt;</span> ../results.txt <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>echo</span> java <span>-jar</span> ./target/gittruckfactor-1.0.jar <span>$x</span> <span>$x</span> <span>&gt;&gt;</span> ../results.txt<span>;</span> <span>done</span><span>;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>I have a fast gigabit internet connection at home, it took 17.5 minutes to clone all the repos one at a time.
Processing each repo took about the same time, eighteen minutes maybe?</p>
<p>Here’s one example output for the linux kernel repository:</p>
<pre><code>linux
TF = 12 (coverage = 49.98%)
TF authors (Developer;Files;Percentage):
Linus Torvalds;5712;6.59
Mauro Carvalho Chehab;2479;2.86
Rob Herring;1313;1.51
Thomas Gleixner;1228;1.42
Krzysztof Kozlowski;1222;1.41
Ben Skeggs;1211;1.40
Arnaldo Carvalho de Melo;911;1.05
Greg Kroah-Hartman;852;0.98
David Howells;718;0.83
Ian Rogers;599;0.69
Masahiro Yamada;598;0.69
Takashi Iwai;581;0.67
</code></pre>
<h2 id="problems">Problems</h2>
<p><a href="https://mclare.blog/">&lt;mclare&gt;</a> This calculation neglects the review process. As you go up the career ladder, developers should do more review and less hands on keyboard.</p>
<h2 id="further-work">Further Work</h2>
<ul>
<li><label>does the truck factor calculation take into account git’s co-authored-by and reviewer headers? If not, could it?</label></li>
<li><label>why is our number for Linux so very different ten years later? The original paper gives a truck factor of 80, we get EIGHT!</label>
<ul>
<li><label>The original paper uses a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance">Levenshtein distance</a> of one to find and merge developer aliases. I don’t think we did that. Maybe that changes our number?</label></li>
<li><label>Would this version of the truck factor code still give us 80 if we checkout the Linux kernel repo at mid-2015 ? According to the git history, the algorithm was updated in 2016, could we get new numbers for a later blog post?</label></li>
</ul></li>
<li><label>We could look at some of the <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=5286537198548981618&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0,22">156 citations</a> of this paper and see if someone came up with a better calculation.</label></li>
<li><label>We could compare popular projects of today to their history. Rust and other recent big names are not mentioned in the 2015 paper. For that matter, we could write a script to find yearly truck numbers for any git repo.</label></li>
<li><label>Shae wants to figure out how to install Ruby Gems in NixOS so the linguist plugin can filter out which files are only documentation.</label></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion---bus-factors-got-scarier">Conclusion - Bus Factors got scarier.</h2>
<p>The biggest question we both had was, did it get any better?</p>
<p>I’m gonna say no, it’s gotten worse.
The 2015 <a href="https://peerj.com/preprints/1233v1.pdf">preprint</a> of this paper gave the linux kernel a truck factor of ninety!
The <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.06766">full publication</a> gave that same repository a truck number of fifty seven.</p>
<p>Without the linguist plugin to filter out documentation and third party libraries, we got a truck factor of twelve for the Linux kernel repository.
After mclare installed the plugin on her system, she got a truck factor of eight for the Linux kernel.</p>
<p>This is not an improvement.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the replies.<br>
The Macbook is a 2010 17" so it would have been pretty easy to upgrade and repair (socketed Ram and HDD, screwed in battery) but the age would have made this laptop not only unusably slow but it was also dead as a doornail. Its one of the still good Macbooks with the glowing apple logo.<br>
Yes, all the green PCBs are made by me.</p>

              <p>This is really cool! What is the function of top left board that requires cooling from what looks like a framework fan? If it is a Framework fan can you explain how the lower section was liberated from it’s heatsink?</p>

            <p>Its to compensate for apples innovative cooling design. Ive desoldered the old heatpipe from the heatsink and soldered a new one on that i press against the main heatpipe.</p>

            <p>Sorry it isn’t quite clear to me, is that additional fan adding to the existing cpu cooling solution because you saw overheating or to get the most thermal performance?</p>

            <p>Yes its adding to the existing cpu cooling. The first prototype of this I build was using an i5 1135 cpu and was getting pretty hot. So I figured adding an additional heatsink and fan would help. On the Ryzen board im not sure I would have gone through that trouble again, its running much cooler.</p>

            <p>If you dont add a second cooling fan I dont think that would be an issue on the 15 inch. The 13 might be difficult to fit the battery but I think it would be possible.</p>

							<p>Apple apparently hasn’t learned much from the criticism it took earlier this year for an ad showing creative works unceremoniously crushed in an industrial press (see “<a href="https://tidbits.com/2024/05/10/apple-apologizes-for-tone-deaf-crush-ipad-pro-ad/">Apple Apologizes for Tone-Deaf “Crush!” iPad Pro Ad</a>,” 10 May 2024). A pair of new ads for Apple Intelligence portray the Writing Tools and Memories movies as tools for those unwilling to put in any effort.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3m0MoYKwVTM">first ad</a>, Apple Intelligence enables a goof-off who wastes time and annoys his colleagues to surprise his boss with an unexpectedly well-written email. It’s not clear that the boss is impressed; he just can’t believe the guy would have written a professional message.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Apple Intelligence | Writing Tools | iPhone 16" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3m0MoYKwVTM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Is the message that Apple Intelligence is aimed at the perpetually lazy? Where’s the positive ad with a dyslexic child using Writing Tools to proofread a school essay or a businessperson using it to understand a complex report dumped on them minutes before a meeting?</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0BXZhdDqZM">second ad</a> channels a similar suggestion—that Apple Intelligence is a crutch for the thoughtless. In it, a woman realizes that she has forgotten her husband’s birthday only after their kids give him thoughtful, homemade gifts, so she quickly uses Apple Intelligence to create a Memories movie of the children doing woodworking with their father. Apple Intelligence to the rescue! Apparently, making a Memories movie is easier than creating a repeating annual calendar event.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Apple Intelligence | Create memory movies | iPhone 16" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A0BXZhdDqZM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Why would Apple want to promote the idea that Apple Intelligence can bail you out from failing to pay attention to the most important people in your life? It’s trivially easy to imagine positive scenarios enhanced by a Memories movie, such as a teen sharing photos with an ailing grandparent in the hospital or high school friends reconnecting over shared sports photos. They might be a touch cloying, but Memories movies trend in that direction anyway.</p>
<p>As it stands now, and likely as it will be in its next release, Apple Intelligence won’t change the world or even your everyday Mac experience. But it can make a difference for some, and Apple would be better served by showing it helping those who are already trying to do good work and be good people.</p>
<p>Imagine you work at Apple’s ad agency. What ads would you like to see showcasing Apple Intelligence features?</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><header></header><section><p>I have shipped a lot of different projects over the last ~10 years in tech. I often get tapped to lead new ones when it’s important to get it right, because I’m good at it. Shipping in a big tech company is a very different skill to writing code, and lots of people who are great at writing code are terrible at shipping.</p>
<p>Here’s what I think about when I’m leading a project and what I’ve seen people get wrong.</p>
<h2>Shipping is hard</h2>
<p>The most common error I see is to assume that shipping is easy. The default state of a project is to <em>not ship</em>: to be delayed indefinitely, cancelled, or to go out half-baked and burst into flames. Projects do not ship automatically once all the code has been written or all the Jira tickets closed. They ship because someone takes up the difficult and delicate job of shipping them.</p>
<p>That means that in almost all cases, <strong>shipping has to come first</strong>. You cannot have anything else as your top priority. If you spend all your time worrying about polishing the customer experience (for example), you will not ship! Obsessing over UX is praiseworthy behaviour when you are an engineer on the team, but a blunder if you are leading the project. You should cherish the other engineers on your team who are doing that work, and give them as much support as you can. But your primary concern has to be shipping the project. It is too hard a job to do in your spare time.</p>
<p>In my experience, projects almost always ship because one single person makes them ship. To be clear, that person doesn’t write all the code or do all the work, and I’m not saying the project could ship without an entire team behind it. But it’s <em>really important</em> that one person on the project has an end-to-end understanding of the whole thing: how it hangs together technically, and what product or business purpose it serves. Good teams and companies understand this, and make sure every project has a single responsible engineer (typically this position is called a “technical lead” or “DRI” role). Bad teams and companies don’t do this, and projects live and die based on whether an engineer steps up into this role of their own accord.</p>
<h2>What is shipping?</h2>
<p>Why do so many engineers think shipping is easy? I know it sounds extreme, but I think many engineers do not understand what shipping even is inside a large tech company. What does it mean to ship? It does <em>not</em> mean deploying code or even making a feature available to users. Shipping is a social construct within a company.Concretely, that means that <strong>a project is shipped when the important people at your company believe it is shipped.</strong> If you deploy your system, but your manager or VP or CEO is very unhappy with it, <em>you did not ship</em>. (Maybe you shipped something, but you didn’t ship the actual project.) You only know you’ve shipped when your company’s leadership acknowledge you’ve shipped. A congratulations message in Slack from your VP is a good sign, as is an internal blog post that claims victory. For small ships, an atta-boy from your manager will do.</p>
<p>This probably sounds circular, but I think it’s a really important point. Of course if you deploy something that users love and makes a ton of money, you’ve shipped. But that’s only true because satisfying users and making money is something that makes your leadership team happy. If you ship something users hate and makes no money, but your leadership team is happy, <em>you still shipped</em>. You can feel any way you like about that, but it’s true. If you don’t like it, you should probably go work for companies that really care how happy their users are.</p>
<p>Engineers who think shipping means delivering a spec or deploying code will repeatedly engineer their way into failed ships.</p>
<h2>Communication</h2>
<p>So if your primary job when shipping something is to make your company’s leadership happy with the project, what does that mean in practice? First, <strong>you have to get clear on what the company is looking to get out of the project</strong>. Sometimes it’s extracting more money from a small set of users (e.g. enterprise features). Sometimes it’s spending money to grow the total set of users (e.g. splashy free-tier features). Sometimes it’s mollifying a particular very large customer by building a feature specifically for them. Sometimes it’s just an influential VP or CEO’s pet project, and you need to align with their vision. There are lots of potential reasons, and if you want to ship the project you need to know which ones apply in this case. Align your work and communication accordingly! For instance, enterprise features often don’t need splashy UI but are completely inflexible on requirements, end-user features need to be polished, pet projects mean you need to be in active communication with the specific mover and shaker whose pet it is, and so on.</p>
<p>Second, no matter the project goal, your leadership team (the people in your reporting chain who care about the project) will always have basically zero technical context about the project compared to you. That means they will be trusting you for estimates, to answer technical questions, and to anticipate technical problems. <strong>Maintaining that trust should be your top priority</strong>. If they don’t have faith in your ability to do the job and to keep them informed, you will not ship. They’ll de-risk by cancelling the project, or letting it roll out with zero attention or celebration (remember that an un-celebrated launch is not a ship!) Alternatively, they’ll sideline you and go to another engineer, who will then formally or informally be the one who actually ships the project. Either way, you’ll feel it at review time and they’ll go to someone else for the next one.</p>
<p>How do you maintain trust with your leadership team? This could be a whole article (or book) by itself, but here’s my summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>The best thing is a track record of having shipped in the past, if you can get it</li>
<li>Project confidence (if you’re visibly worried, they will be too)</li>
<li>Project competence. You want to aim for something like a NASA mission control vibe</li>
<li>Communicate professionally and concisely, and don’t make them chase you for updates: post a daily or weekly thread somewhere</li>
</ul>
<p>It is much, much more important to do these things than for the project to ship with zero bugs on the exact deadline. If a project has to be delayed for technical reasons, in my experience you will not suffer consequences so long as you communicate it clearly, confidently (and ideally with some warning). In fact, it’s paradoxically often <em>better</em> for you if there is some kind of problem that forces a delay, for the same reason that the heroic on-call engineer who hotfixes an incident gets more credit than the careful engineer who prevents one.</p>
<h2>Getting into production</h2>
<p>Even so, you typically still have to get the project into production. The most common problem here is missing a key detail. Sometimes it’s a technical detail: maybe we rely on storing the user documents in Memcached, but many documents are multiple megabytes and will be larger than the Memcached block size. Sometimes it’s a detail of coordination: maybe the platform team that owns Memcached was expecting one-tenth of the traffic our project will send them, so they call a meeting with the VPs and delay the project. Sometimes it’s a legal detail: maybe the user data is unexpectedly sensitive, and our system doesn’t have the controls we’d need to handle it safely. These issues can come from anywhere, and are very hard to anticipate. Dealing with them requires a deep technical understanding of the system and the ability to pivot quickly.</p>
<p>For instance, you may have read that first example and are now thinking “well, you could split the documents across multiple Memcached keys, or increase the block size, or move to Redis, etc…“. All of those are potential solutions! But knowing which of those solutions will work - and more importantly, which of those solutions will not blow out the project timeline - is impossible unless you’ve got a deep understanding.</p>
<p>This is doubly important because the problem in question doesn’t even need to be real. In the lead up to a project launch, it’s very common for other teams or engineers to raise <em>potential</em> problems (e.g. “hey, are we sure the user data will fit in Memcached?“) If nobody steps forward and explains why this isn’t a problem (or if it is, how it’s being addressed before launch), the project will be delayed, and it will be your responsibility. Why? Because your manager (or their manager) will not know whether this is a serious problem. That’s what they pay you for! If you’re not stepping up to address it, they will naturally err on the side of caution and <em>not ship</em>.</p>
<p>You need to stay light on your feet so that when these issues come up you’re not neck-deep in other work. That usually means not being fully heads-down on implementation (i.e. delegating tasks to other engineers on the project). Ideally you should have at least 20% of your time free from implementation in the early stages of the project, scaling up to 90-100% in the final days. If you do that, when issues do come up you’ll be able to grant them your full attention.</p>
<h2>Can we ship right now?</h2>
<p>Feature flags are the best way I’ve seen to do this, but staging environments also work, and so on. The key thing is to get whatever you’re building in front of as many eyes as possible: yours, but also other engineers, and ideally leadership, product, design and so on. Five minutes playing with the actual feature, even in a very rough state, will bring up issues that nobody anticipated. Being able to directly see it themselves also does wonders for reassuring leadership that you’ve got things under control.</p>
<p>The best way to anticipate problems is to deploy early. In general, a helpful question to ask is <strong>can I ship this right now?</strong> Not this week, not today: right this second. If not, what would have to change for me to be able to ship <em>something</em>? If the ship needs a deploy, can that happen now behind a feature flag? If we’re waiting on some other team to make a change on their end, can I make it so the system doesn’t strictly require their change after all? For instance, if the platform team is setting up a cache layer, I could make it so my feature still works (albeit a little slower) if it can’t find the cache.</p>
<p>Remember, your main priority is maintaining trust with your leadership team. Nothing builds trust like having fallback plans, because in case of emergency fallback plans indicate control over the situation. If the worst does happen and you can’t release on the day, your manager will be much happier going to their manager about it if they can say something like “our options are to delay four days, or ship tomorrow by sacrificing X” - even if sacrificing X is a non-starter. That means they’ll be more likely to interpret the delay as an unavoidable problem that you handled effectively, instead of as a mistake you made that means they can’t rely on you.</p>
<p>I think a lot of engineers hold off on deploys essentially out of fear. If you want to ship, you need to do the exact opposite: you need to deploy as much as you can as early as possible, and you need to do the scariest changes as early as you can possibly do them. Remember that you have the most end-to-end context on the project, which means <strong>you should be the least scared of scary changes</strong>. Everyone else is dealing with more unknowns and is going to be even less keen to pull the big lever. (If there’s some other engineer who is across all of this who you’re waiting for, bad news: they’re probably the one actually shipping your project).</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<ul>
<li>Shipping is really hard and you have to make it your main priority if you want to ship</li>
<li>Shipping doesn’t mean deploying code, it means making your leadership team happy</li>
<li>You need your leadership team to trust you in order to ship</li>
<li>Most of the essential technical work is in anticipating problems and creating fallback plans</li>
<li>You should asking yourself “can I ship right this second?”</li>
<li>Have courage!</li>

That world was very good to me. The times were good, as were the profits.

I knew it wasn’t the most socially valuable enterprise, but I certainly thought it was net positive. </p><p>When sports gambling was legalized in America, I was hopeful it too could prove a net positive force, far superior to the previous obnoxious wave of daily fantasy sports. </p><p>It brings me no pleasure to conclude that this was not the case.

This allows us to track all credit and debt outcomes for roughly 7 million Americans. </p><p>We leverage this data and compare states implementing sports gambling to those that don’t and study both sports gambling of any type as well as online/mobile gambling specifically. We study 8 financial/debt outcomes and find the following results:</p><p>First, credit scores, a summary metric of overall creditworthiness, decrease by modest but statistically significant amounts (~1%). We also test for evidence of pre-trends between treated/control states and find none.</p><p>…</p><p>Second, several measures of excessive debt increase substantially. We find a roughly 28% increase in bankruptcies and an 8% increase in debt transferred to debt collectors. Similarly, auto loan delinquencies increase substantially as does use of debt consolidation loans.</p><p>Interestingly, we find that banks restrict access to credit on average in affected states. Credit card limits decrease and the ratio of secured to unsecured loans increases. After three years post-legalization we actually find a decrease in credit card delinquencies as a result.</p></blockquote><p>I expected some negative impacts. But a 28% increase in bankruptcies is far more than I would have predicted. The typical adult bankruptcy rate is about 0.16%, so this would mean about 4bps (0.04%)/year of additional bankruptcies, or an over 1% additional chance a typical person goes bankrupt during their lifetime. </p><p>Alternatively as a sanity check, that’s on the order of 100,000 additional bankruptcies a year, which will rise over time if we don’t intervene. We are talking about an average handle of maybe 120 billion in 2023, but on average lower during this time period, let’s say average of 70 billion, with a likely sportsbook hold (before expenses) of something like 10% if we exclude advantage betters who are definitely not going bankrupt, given all the parlays and shaded lines and in-game betting and generally atrocious odds, so total net losses to ‘normal gamblers’ of 7 billion per year. </p><p>That suggests that for every $70k in net sportsbook gross profits from regular gamblers, someone filed for bankruptcy. That seems like a lot? It means those who are inclined to bet on sports are either often doing it out of desperation, or that the same causes that lead them to bet on sports and pushing them to the financial edge in other ways as well, and this is the straw breaking the camel’s back. Claude found it all plausible when I had it do a bunch of estimations. I do notice I am skeptical.</p><p>The result is clear. A bankruptcy is extremely socially expensive, on the order of $200k. That alone is almost triple the profits, and clearly wipes out all the social gains. </p><p>Legalized online sports betting is currently a deeply, deeply horrible deal. </p><p>I wish it were different. I am all for letting people do things, and I have enjoyed and benefited greatly from the ability to bet on sports. </p><p>And yes, I do think the majority of people who play plausibly get their money’s worth in entertainment, even at the outrageous prices charged. The problem is if a majority get a small benefit, and others get a huge loss, that is on net a disaster.</p><p>I can’t look at these findings, even if I don’t fully believe them, and not see a huge disaster from these effects alone.</p><p>I also can’t see a way in which the positive-sum benefits could justify that disaster.</p><p><span>We can then add a second paper, “</span><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4881086" rel="">Gambling Away Stability: Sports Betting’s Impact on Vulnerable Households</a><span>.” They found that sports betting greatly reduced traditional net investments, while traditional gambling stays unchanged. </span></p><blockquote><p><a href="https://www.maximum-progress.com/p/should-sports-betting-be-banned" rel="">Maxwell Tabarrok</a><span>: The negative effects on investment are large relative to the sample mean. The average household invests about $360 a quarter so a $50 decrease in investment is a loss of 14%.</span></p></blockquote><p>This includes households that never bet.</p><p>If this is fully real, that’s holy **** territory. It’s an apocalypse. We are decreasing net household investment by 14%? Can there possibly be compensation for that? Alex Tabarrok notes that various details seem like they prove too much, and I agree it seems unlikely the effects are this large. But it can be a lot smaller than that, and still way too high. </p><p>There are a variety of goods households can choose to consume, including traditional gambling. If sports gambling were a regular consumption good that consumers were choosing because they enjoy it more, it wouldn’t be having these effects. Eating dramatically into savings rather than shifting the consumption basket, while not even reducing traditional gambling, says that consumers are clearly not responding rationally, and do not understand the choices they are making. </p><p><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4938642" rel="">Here’s a third paper</a><span>, showing that sports betting increases domestic violence. When the home team suffers an upset loss while sports betting is legal, domestic violence that day goes up by 9% for the day, with lingering effects. </span></p><p>It is estimated 10 million Americans are victims of domestic violence each year.</p><p>Claude estimates if you extrapolate from this result that there might be a 3% overall increase in domestic violence as the result of legalized sports betting, which seems non-crazy given that betting on NFL home favorites is only a tiny portion of overall losses. </p><p><span>Again, this is an overall effect for the entire population. The percentage of people who bet on sports is rising rapidly, </span><a href="https://www.shu.edu/business/news/sports-poll-finds-slowed-growth-for-sports-betting.html#:~:text=Among%20the%20general%20population%2C%2037,2022%20it%20was%2041%20percent." rel="">but even so only 34% said they placed even one bet</a><span> in 2023, and many of those will be limited to nominal wagers on things like the Super Bowl and March Madness. </span><a href="https://www.wamc.org/news/2024-02-09/new-poll-finds-39-of-americans-bet-on-sporting-events-ahead-of-super-bowl-sunday" rel="">This survey has 39% sports betting participation</a><span>, with about 35% of betters betting at least once a week. So again, the effects on the households that actually gamble are far higher.</span></p><p>This is a huge direct cost to bear. Domestic violence ruins lives. It also is a huge indicator that this is causing large amounts of distress in various forms, and that those gambling on sports are not making rational or wise consumption decisions.</p><p>Meanwhile, frankly, the product emphasis and implementation sucks. Almost all of the legal implementations (e.g. everyone I know about except Circa) are highly predatory. That’s what can survive in this market.</p><p>Why? Predation is where the money is. There is no physical overhead at an online casino, but after paying for all the promotions and credit card payments and advertisements and licenses and infrastructure, the only way to make all that back under the current laws and business models is the above-mentioned 10%-style hold that comes from toxic offerings. </p><p>Thus high prices even on the main lines, even higher ones on parlays and in-game betting. Whenever I see lines on the TV I usually want to puke at how wide the prices are. In game odds are beyond obnoxious. Anyone this drives away is a customer they have decided not to want.</p><p>This is what the in-game odds look like when they’re relatively reasonable, and seriously, ow my balls:</p><div><figure><a

they are), advertisements, promotional texts and emails and especially a barrage of push notifications. </p><p>Anyone showing any skill? They are shown the door.  </p><p><span>I don’t think this is central to the case that current legal sports betting is awful, </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-27/sports-betting-apps-are-even-more-toxic-than-you-imagined?cmpid=BBD093024_MONEYSTUFF&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_term=240930&amp;utm_campaign=moneystuff" rel="">but it is illustrative what pros do in order to disguise themselves and get their wagers down</a><span>. That to do that, they make themselves look like the whales. Which means addicts.</span></p><p>I’m used to stories like this one, that’s normal:</p><blockquote><p><span>Ira Boudway (Bloomberg): If I open an account in New York, maybe for a few weeks I just bet the Yankees right before the game begins,” says Rufus Peabody, a pro bettor and co-host of the </span><em><a href="https://x.com/bettheprocess?lang=en" rel="">Bet the Process</a></em><span> podcast. If this trick works, the book sees these normie, hometown bets as a sign that it’s safe to raise his limits.</span></p></blockquote><p>It seems players have upped their game.</p><blockquote><p>One pro bettor I know set up a bot which logs in to his accounts every day between 2 and 4 a.m., to make it seem like he can’t get through the night without checking his bets. Another withdraws money and then reverses those withdrawals so it looks like he can’t resist gambling.</p><p><span>Simulating addictive behavior, says Peabody, is an effective way to get online sportsbooks to send you </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2022-03-30/sports-betting-app-promos-make-bettors-look-for-new-edge?sref=VBucTHzi" rel="">bonus money</a><span> and keep your accounts open. This isn’t necessarily because operators are targeting problem bettors, he says; they’re simply looking to identify and encourage customers who are likely to spend—and lose—the most. This just happens to be a good way to find and enable addicts, too.</span></p></blockquote><p>The rest of the post is filled with the usual statistics and tragic stories.</p><p>What I find interesting about these examples is that they are very level-1 plays.</p><p>As in, this is exactly what someone would do if they thought they were up against a system that was looking for signs of what type of player you are, but only in the most mechanical and simple sense. For this type of thing to work, the book must not be looking at details or thinking clearly or holistically.</p><p>If you had tried this stuff on me when I was watching customers, to the extent I noticed it at all, I am pretty sure I would if anything have caught you faster. </p><p>Vices and other distractions are constant temptations. When you carry a phone around with you, that temptation is ever present. </p><p>Indeed, I recently got a Pixel Watch, and the biggest benefit of it so far is that I can stay connected enough to not worry, and not be tempted to check for things, without the pull of what a phone can do. And we have repeatedly seen how distracting it is for kids in school to have the smartphone right there in their pocket. I have learned to be very, very careful with mobile games, even ones with no relevant microtransactions. </p><p>Putting gambling in your pocket makes the temptation to gamble ever-present. Even for those who can resist it, that is a not so cheap mental tax to pay, and likely to result in the occasional impulse bet, even without the constant notifications. First hit’s free. Constant offers that adjust to your responses, to get you to keep coming back. </p><p>Now consider that at least several percent of people have an acute gambling addiction or vulnerability. For them, this is like an alcoholic being forced to carry a flask around in their pocket 24/7, while talk of what alcohol to choose and how good it would be to use that flask right now gets constantly woven into all their entertainment, and they by default get notifications asking if now is a good time for a beer. You can have the apps back up and running within a minute, even if you delete them. </p><p>It was plausible that this was an acceptable situation, that people could mostly handle that kind of temptation. We have now run the experiment, and it is clear that too many of them cannot.</p><p>I am coming around to a generalized version of this principle. There is a vast difference between:</p><ol><li><p>Something being legal, ubiquitous, frictionless and advertised.</p></li><li><p>Something being available, mostly safe to get, but we make it annoying.</p></li><li><p>Something being actively illegal, where you can risk actual legal trouble.</p></li><li><p>Something being actively illegal and we really try to stop you (e.g. rape, murder). </p></li></ol><p>We’ve placed far too many productive and useful things in category 2 that should be in category 1. By contrast, we’ve taken too many destructive things, too many vices, that we long had the wisdom to put in category 2, and started putting them in category 1. </p><p>Prohibitions, putting such things into categories 3 and especially 4, tends to work out extremely poorly. Don’t do that unless absolutely necessary. Let people do privately destructive things if they want to do that. </p><p>Often, it is important that you make doing the wrong thing a little annoying. It is especially important to not make it annoying to do the productive things, and not annoying to instead do the destructive things. </p><p><a href="https://x.com/KelseyTuoc/status/1823112217979478260" rel="">The elite refrains from irresponsible gambling, but here sets up conditions where such irresponsible actions are the inevitable result. The actual big elite hypocrisy is not the failure to impose paternalistic rules on the non-elite, it is that we constantly</a><span> imposing extreme and expensive consumption requirements and restrictions on the non-elite when they are trying to live their lives and get their needs met. We impose these deeply restrictive, expensive and stupid elite norms on others all the time. </span></p><p>This paternalism severely damages their lives in numerous ways. This is the core reason why it is so difficult for ordinary people to pay their bills or raise families, despite earnings that would make them rich elsewhere or elsewhen. </p><p>These productive actions are severely restricted, because if you are going to be productive then you have to do so ‘correctly’ and obey all sorts of rules and requirements. Whereas if your actions are destructive, well then, go ahead, and it would be wrong of us to even enforce existing law.</p><p>That is a deeply toxic approach. We should reverse it. We should allow people to do productive actions as freely as possible, and put up frictions to sufficiently destructive actions. </p><p>Mobile gambling has shown itself to be a highly destructive action for its users, well in excess of any profits earned, sufficiently so as to substantially damage economic conditions. A that point, we need to draw the line.</p><p><a href="https://www.maximum-progress.com/p/should-sports-betting-be-banned" rel="">Maxwell Tabarrok makes the contrary case</a><span> that sports gambling is ordinary consumption, and we should not assume that so-called ‘vulnerable populations’ need protections from deciding to increase their consumption. He says the evidence is not compelling here. </span></p><p>His view is that this is no different from people buying Taylor Swift tickets. </p><p>In general I am highly sympathetic to this argument. I am not looking to tell people how much to invest or what goods to consume. But here I must strongly disagree.</p><p>I’ve certainly enjoyed consuming gambling, including in a few narrow small stakes cases where I wasn’t trying to be an advantage player. I think many others do so in ways that are not mistakes, or are mistakes we should allow them to make. </p><p>But ‘this is normal consumption’ seems to me like an absurd interpretation of the evidence above, and fails to understand the nature of the consumption being offered. You can’t place this ability to wager directly onto everyone’s phones at all times, putting the temptation at arm’s reach, see these consequences, and pretend these consequences are merely revealed preferences. </p><p>Most other prediction markets do not pose the same problems. They would not even if they greatly expanded and became more ‘normie’ friendly. </p><p>In particular, sports markets are highly related to and integrated into the most ‘normie’ of activities and into the related media, and they pay off quickly, and they’re ubiquitous, with something for you every day.</p><p>The legalized mobile online sports betting experiment is a clear failure. It should end. </p><p>You should need to go to a physical location to place fully legal bets of a non-trivial size, or at least interact with a human or bear some other cost or risk. </p><p>I’m fine with that location being the local sports bar, especially if the bar gets to book your action. Yes, I realize that will mean more illegal and untaxed online sports betting, but it is what it is. The barriers to doing that would do a lot of good work.  </p><p>At a bare minimum, the advertising and dark pattern complexes feeding this must be disempowered. The Federal Government should do what it can. The states should realize they are not doing themselves any favors and resist or undo this cash grab.</p><p>Legalized online casino gaming, allowing roulette or similar games from one’s phone, is of course far worse. That certainly should not be allowed via the internet. I am not keen to be expansive in what ‘counts as gambling’ but the obvious gambling that resolves in seconds and pays real money absolutely must go. We will need to figure out where to draw the line on ‘loot boxes’ and other game features, but if the more obnoxious and toxic versions of that got banned as well, that would be good too. </p><p><a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/online-sports-betting-hurts-consumers" rel="">Ben Krauss and Milan Singh reach the same conclusion at Slow Boring</a><span>, although they are less willing to fully bite the bullet. </span><a href="https://x.com/KelseyTuoc/status/1822333974548537644" rel="">Kelsey Piper, who similar to me is loathe to tell people what they cannot do, does bite the bullet</a><span>. </span><a href="https://x.com/esaagar/status/1838200488698732944" rel="">Here Saagar Enjeti bites the bullet</a><span>. </span><a href="https://archive.fo/FeAy9#selection-687.0-687.45" rel="">Here Charles Fain Lehman at The Atlantic bites the bullet</a><span>. </span></p><p>Otherwise, as the amount of gambling expands, it is only going to get worse.</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

He has a great way of explaining things. </span><a href="https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/33470/what-technical-reasons-are-there-to-have-low-maximum-password-lengths/33471#33471" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">My favorite answer he ever gave</a><span> responds to a query as to why so many applications still had character length restrictions (this was some years ago), typically eight characters, on passwords:</span></p><pre><code><code>Take five chimpanzees. Put them in a big cage. Suspend some bananas from the roof of the cage. Provide the chimpanzees with a stepladder. BUT also add a proximity detector to the bananas, so that when a chimp goes near the banana, water hoses are triggered and the whole cage is thoroughly soaked.

Soon, the chimps learn that the bananas and the stepladder are best ignored.

Now, remove one chimp, and replace it with a fresh one. That chimp knows nothing of the hoses. He sees the banana, notices the stepladder, and because he is a smart primate, he envisions himself stepping on the stepladder to reach the bananas. He then deftly grabs the stepladder... and the four other chimps spring on him and beat him squarely. He soon learns to ignore the stepladder.

Then, remove another chimp and replace it with a fresh one. The scenario occurs again; when he grabs the stepladder, he gets mauled by the _four_ other chimps -- yes, including the previous "fresh" chimp. He has integrated the notion of "thou shallt not touch the stepladder".

Iterate. After some operations, you have five chimps who are ready to punch any chimp who would dare touch the stepladder -- and none of them knows why.

Originally, some developer, somewhere, was working on an old Unix system from the previous century, which used the old [DES-based "crypt"](https://ftp.gnu.org/old-gnu/Manuals/glibc-2.2.3/html_chapter/libc_32.html), actually a password _hashing_ function derived from the DES block cipher. In that hashing function, only the first eight characters of the password are used (and only the low 7 bits of each character, as well). Subsequent characters are ignored. That's the banana.

The Internet is full of chimpanzees.

I'd like to go over the implications of this; the next several (and probably many more a year until I retire or die) will be to understand the </span><em>why</em><span> for common, useless security controls.</span></p><p>If the control can only be explained in a nebulous way, such as "to improve security" or "for compliance reasons", that's probably a useless control. If the security-ish person forcing the control on you cannot adequately explain it, it's probably because they have no idea why themselves. If that security-ish person doesn't understand why, it's a good heuristic that there isn't a legitimate why at all.</p><p>"But Jon," you say, unhappily trapped in this conversation, "What if the reasoning is very complex and hard to explain to people who are not experienced security masters?". This is a fair question on the surface.</p><p>How many controls can you think of that you know are useful, and you genuinely know why they are, but you can't explain it in 2-3 sentences to someone with a modicum of technical understanding? Some examples:</p><ul><li><p>Encryption in transit is valuable because it prevents anyone with access to points on the network between you and your friend from viewing or modifying your messages</p></li><li><p>Private S3 buckets are valuable so you don't leak your data all over the place and have embarrassing articles written about you</p></li><li><p>Cross-site scripting (XSS) safe front-end frameworks like React are good because they prevent XSS. XSS is bad because it allows an attacker to take over your active web session and do horrible things</p></li></ul><p><span>See? Easy. There are many complex things about security, but these are almost all in </span><em>how</em><span> we do things. The why is almost always pretty simple.</span></p><p><span>You won't be able to give wonderful off-the-cuff explanations for </span><em>every </em><span>security control you ever implement. It's more that every control you consider, spend resources implementing, and spend other teams' resources in dealing with the implantation should be explainable after you think about it. The reason should never just be "to support our robust security posture." That's a tautology, and tautologies </span><a href="https://xkcd.com/703/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">outside of XKCD comics</a><span> are bad.</span></p><p>When I rant about this with my peers, mentors, friends, family, and unfortunate bystanders at the bar, a common reframe is, "Why is this so bad"? It's still people caring about security. So what if some of that isn't as effective as it could be?</p><p>We are so resource-constrained as an industry. There's not enough manpower, budget, and political capital. We can't be wasteful while still being effective stewards of the systems and data entrusted to us. We can't waste any of it! And we certainly can't keep asking for more budget when we're blowing 50% of what we already have on useless crap.</p><p>People, going about their everyday lives and jobs with their own problems, deadlines, and OKRs, have a finite amount of fucks to give about security. You have to use those fucks very sparingly. We can only get the average person to do a few things to help secure themselves or their company; wasting most of those slots on uselessness is devastating. We can't afford to be chimps.</p><p>These also aren't decisions that only affect the implementing company. Many useless controls are in compliance and control frameworks and standard maturity models, forcing waste on whole swaths of companies.</p><p>Many, many more are added by well-meaning security teams to security questionnaires, forcing every company that tries to sell to them to at least spend time discussing why they don't do it. Sometimes this leads to much back and forth, wasting time on both sides. I've spent depressing amounts of time implementing useless controls, not for their value (there was none), but because the time cost was lower than explaining to prospects why we don't do them every single week. This is devastating to security teams at medium-sized companies; I know several 3-4-person security teams whose roadmaps are hamstrung due to the cost of customer requests for useless dribble. </p><p>Worse, useless controls may be added to contractual security addendums. Worst, these contractual requirements can be recursive: As a signing company, I not only have to implement the useless control myself but require all of my significant sub-processors to implement it as well. These types of contractual requirements can be depressingly hard to unwind, leaving the entire industry in a less secure state, not because we even think the control is useful anymore, but because we're contractually bound to beat up any chimp who tries to effect change and grab a banana.</p><p>Don't be a chimp.</p><p>Don't implement controls without knowing why! You should be able to figure out the threat model related to the control, understand the threat this control is mitigating or the outcome you're looking for, and vaguely, how. You don't need to understand the TLS handshake process, how keys are computed, or how cipher suites are negotiated, but you need to understand what TLS buys you and where that is actually useful.</p><p>If you're on a security team, you should demand this from your peers. </p><p><span>If you're a normal employee, engineer, or executive reading this post for some reason, you should demand this from your security team. Make them tell you why. If they can't in a satisfactory way, it's </span><em>probably</em><span> not because it's complicated but because they don't really know themselves. Send them this post as a response; I can use the impressions.</span></p><p>I'll be publishing a series of posts diving into useless controls that we still demand everywhere.

Mostek had grown into the one’s top producer of DRAM, and every Z80 microprocessor — including Zilog-branded ones — went through tests there.</p><p>Mostek also tested Fairchild F-8 CPU chips and exotic parts such as the Magnavox “Star” T.V. tuner chips. The system was general purpose enough, we could test RAMs, ROMs and calculators — though we made our own custom testers for these. The room did most of the heavy lifting on all of the early CPU chips. Mostek also had a second-source license for many popular CPU chips — the Farichild F-8 series, the Z80, the Intel 8088/6, and the Motorola 68000 family.</p><p>Several MTSI engineers began their careers at Mostek which invented the multiplexed DRAM, too. But back in 1971, Mostek’s engineers were introduced to the Sentry 610. Fairchild Systems had just introduced the first computer-controlled, modularized, expandable test system product line in the the Sentry series. These third-generation systems were designed to test complex MSI/ LSI integrated circuits, electronic subsystems, and systems.</p><p>The machine was a beauty.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F71b57236-a299-4001-90de-a3e58de058f5_720x343.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel="nofollow ugc noopener"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F71b57236-a299-4001-90de-a3e58de058f5_720x343.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F71b57236-a299-4001-90de-a3e58de058f5_720x343.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F71b57236-a299-4001-90de-a3e58de058f5_720x343.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F71b57236-a299-4001-90de-a3e58de058f5_720x343.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F71b57236-a299-4001-90de-a3e58de058f5_720x343.png" width="720" height="343" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/71b57236-a299-4001-90de-a3e58de058f5_720x343.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:343,&quot;width&quot;:720,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:127440,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F71b57236-a299-4001-90de-a3e58de058f5_720x343.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F71b57236-a299-4001-90de-a3e58de058f5_720x343.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F71b57236-a299-4001-90de-a3e58de058f5_720x343.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F71b57236-a299-4001-90de-a3e58de058f5_720x343.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>From clockwise from the upper left, the system comprised a disk drive, a 9-track tape, the Fairchild 24-bit CPU, a terminal and printer, the Sentry 610 Tester, and a pair of 64-pin test heads. The door to this temperature and humidity-controlled room is on the right, in the back of this photograph, down the ramp to the right.</p><p>The disk drive was a head-per-track unit, with a large platter rotating on its side. It was 26 inches in diameter and stored 75,000 bits. This particular disk developed flakies in 1974, so I was elected to drape it with plastic, crawl under it, and spend a shift carefully wiping the surface with alcohol. To my surprise, it worked. The surface looked like raw steel instead of the oxide that I expected.</p><p>The CPU was a Sentry 400-series CPU running “Factor,” Fairchild’s test language. The machine was 24-bits wide at about 250 Khz. There were two boxes of cards, about 12″ X 18″, and 12 boards with 2-bit slices per board. You could access it by pulling the black latch on the left side, and swinging open the door. On the front of the CPU was a LED bank behind plexiglass to make Blinkenlights. I still have the test handbook for it.</p><p>This CPU had a “short” and “long” bus mapped to the various peripherals. One night it failed to boot, which would cost a few thousand dollars an hour. I assigned a technician in training to fix it. An hour or so later he found it, but did not know what to do next. He toggled the switches to go to the short data bus, and after many flicks of the switch and looking through a file cabinet of documentation, he proved to me he was able to write the necessary data to access the disk via the long data bus and read back the disk register.&nbsp;</p><p>Sure enough, there was a bit set, which the documents said was the “disk online” bit, and it was off.</p><p>“Oh,” I said. I turned around, and the “Online” switch was flipped downward on the disk. “Click.” It was a great learning lesson in depth of how the CPU worked, for him and me both.</p><blockquote><p><strong>“Optimized for engineering, sophisticated production needs, QA and test center operations, the Sentry 610 is the most versatile analytical tester available for engineering and production. It can perform the widest range of tests for the broadest range of components. At user option, the Sentry 610 can perform high-speed MaS/LSI, PCB, and bipolar tests simultaneously. It offers complete testing at the wafer level and through automatic handlers at full-rated device speeds up to 10 MHz. The wide choice of peripherals gives the Sentry 610 system massive data handling capacity to manipulate, analyze, compute and generate reports on test procedures in analyzing MaS/LSI."</strong></p><p><em>A Profile of Fairchild Systems Technologies, 1975</em></p></blockquote><p>A full-rated device speed of 10 Mhz was quite fast for this era. The Sentry 610 was based on an 11 Mhz clock and a wild ECL divide-by-11 circuit made of NOR gates and flip-flops which I had to troubleshoot to fix a Magnavox TV tuner test.</p><p>The tester had removable panels and two doors that could swing open. Each door held three banks of cards of TTL and ECL logic, with a five-foot-tall, wire-wrapped backplane. I once tried to count the ICs in the tester and came up with a number — around 60,000 chips. The center panel was filled with large — and very heavy — rack mount power supplies. At the bottom, in the black area, were three-phase twist-n-lock 220V power connectors, a bank of 110V AC utility outlets, and cables running to the two test heads. The black panel running horizontally had some test BNCs no one ever used, and a key to power it off and on.</p><p>We had to be careful about those AC utility jacks. The tester ground was at -11 volts at several hundred amps. If you clipped a scope to a ground, it would happily melt the insulation off the scope probe until it stunk up the room and pooled on the floor. We had to use a three-prong adapter with the ground cut off.</p><p>The tester could DMA test patterns from the disk to the pins of the DUT at full speed, change power supply voltages at megahertz rates, and via microcode running out of ECL RAM, call test subroutines in hardware at the full clock rate. Each test vector looked like a binary 101011..001, 64 bits long, and each bit set an output high or low, or was an expected response.</p><p>These bits basically were wired to the test pins. Someone wrote a Z80 cross compiler that made “Set F 10101010101……100101” statements from assembly language, so we could test actual code on the Z80 at full speed. It was exotic tech for us. We could only compare it to the assembly language PDP-11 testers we typically made. Mostek made all their own custom testers except for these.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6d63c102-1751-41b0-8a8d-0eb63dc7e262_300x300.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel="nofollow ugc noopener"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6d63c102-1751-41b0-8a8d-0eb63dc7e262_300x300.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6d63c102-1751-41b0-8a8d-0eb63dc7e262_300x300.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6d63c102-1751-41b0-8a8d-0eb63dc7e262_300x300.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6d63c102-1751-41b0-8a8d-0eb63dc7e262_300x300.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6d63c102-1751-41b0-8a8d-0eb63dc7e262_300x300.png" width="300" height="300" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/6d63c102-1751-41b0-8a8d-0eb63dc7e262_300x300.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:300,&quot;width&quot;:300,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:87173,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6d63c102-1751-41b0-8a8d-0eb63dc7e262_300x300.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6d63c102-1751-41b0-8a8d-0eb63dc7e262_300x300.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6d63c102-1751-41b0-8a8d-0eb63dc7e262_300x300.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6d63c102-1751-41b0-8a8d-0eb63dc7e262_300x300.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>The test heads had a circular array of pin electronics (PE) cards.

The famous three witches are all played by men.&nbsp;</p><p>But in an era of supposedly infinite choices, Béla Tarr’s <em>Macbeth </em>is impossible to find.&nbsp;</p><p>No streaming service hosts the film, even the specialist ones, and a DVD that included it as a bonus feature is long out of print. But, like many a determined cinephile, Daniel did some digging, found an illegal stream on a “a random archive website” and let himself be flooded by Tarr’s existential universe.</p><p>For anyone interested in movies and their history, breaking the law is a common situation. If it’s not on iTunes, or Amazon, or any of the big streamers, niche streamers, or the scrappy upstarts like the ad-supported B-movie haven Tubi, what else is there to do? For every <em>Atlantics</em> (2019) or <em>All Quiet on the Western Front</em> (2022) – festival hits that got splashy streaming deals with Netflix – there are films from visionary, award-winning directors, like Hong Sang-soo, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivian_Qu">Vivian Qu</a> and <a href="https://i-d.co/article/xavier-dolan-controversy-interview-new-film/">Xavier Dolan</a>, which never got official US or UK releases.&nbsp;</p><p>In other parts of the world, access is even more restricted. “The kinds of movies that get mainstream distribution in India are super limited,” says the Chennai-based filmmaker Ashwin Arvind. His discovery of arthouse cinema coincided with the realisation that Spanish director <a href="https://i-d.co/article/pedro-almodovar-strange-way-of-life-interview-pedro-pascal/">Pedro Almodóvar</a>’s films had no Indian distribution, so he streamed them illegally instead. “With India’s censor board there’s no way that we were getting any films with any graphic content uncut.”&nbsp;</p></div>

<div><p>Pre-2010 arthouse is even more scarce. The transition from physical media to streaming in the late 00s led to the quiet loss of a slew of films that had previously been available from specialist companies like Tartan, Artificial Eye <em>et al.</em> Apichatpong Weerasethakul’s <em>Blissfully Yours</em> won the <a href="https://i-d.co/article/photos-cannes-film-festival-francesc-planes-gonzo-glamour-debauchery/">Cannes Film Festival</a>’s Un Certain Regard prize back in 2002 and is not legally viewable anywhere. Federico Fellini’s rare circus documentary <em>I Clowns</em> (1970) was re-released a decade ago, only for its distribution deal to expire<em>. The Falls</em> (1980), the abstract three-hour debut movie of Peter Greenaway, known best for <em>The Cook, the Thief, His Wife &amp; Her Lover</em> (1989), has fallen into the abyss.&nbsp;</p><p>A slew of sites – most of them legally dubious – are making these forgotten films available to everyone. Rarefilmm is a curated online archive of hundreds of niche, hard-to-find movies, often lifted from their original film print, from 1910s silent films about New York starlets to Nicaraguan <a href="https://i-d.co/article/coming-of-age-documentaries/">coming-of-age</a> dramas from the 1980s. A regularly updated <a href="https://letterboxd.com/rhettman417/list/movies-on-rarefilmmcom/">list</a> on Letterboxd includes every film they feature, and an <a href="https://rarefilmm.com/chat-room/">online chatroom</a> sees visitors share recommendations based on what they’ve watched. Similarly, a collection of sites specialise in doing the same thing, organising films by their area of origin: be it <a href="https://sovietmoviesonline.com/">Soviet</a>, <a href="https://easterneuropeanmovies.com/">Eastern European</a> or <a href="https://asian-movies-online.com/">Asian</a>. Beyond these platforms, users on reddit regularly point people towards other sites, like archive.org, through which a quick search can uncover a hard to find film uploaded illegally online, if poorly signposted, years ago. Since May, the Rarefilmm following on X has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240518064721/https://x.com/rarefilmm">nearly doubled</a>.&nbsp;</p></div>



<figure><blockquote><p>“I send my film to people all the time”</p><cite>crystal moselle</cite></blockquote></figure>



<div><p>Of course, cinephiles have been torrenting and sharing hard-to-find movies for two decades and change, but it’s occured mostly via private communities like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karagarga">Karagarga</a>, where users share links to barely-seen films and add subtitles to unsubtitled foreign language features. But a new boom in interest in those films, perhaps fuelled by Letterboxd’s rise to prominence, has created a greater appetite for the stuff that’s trickier to find.</p><p>Some filmmakers are all for it. “I send my film to people all the time,” says the director <a href="https://i-d.co/article/skate-kitchen-crystal-moselle/" data-type="link" data-id="https://i-d.co/article/skate-kitchen-crystal-moselle/">Crystal Moselle</a> (<em>The Black Sea</em>, HBO’s <em>Betty</em>). She won’t say which one. “There’s people that don’t have it in their countries, and spreading the word of the work to me is more important [than adhering to distribution rules].” Moselle says that pirated material was key to honing her craft. When she was in her early 20s, she would buy bootleg VHS copies of <em>Grey Gardens </em>and<em> </em>movies by Wong Kar-wai from vendors on the <a href="https://i-d.co/article/nuevayorkinos-instagram-photography/">New York City</a> sidewalk. The former, she says, was “the kind of film that really inspired me to make documentaries [that were] fly on the wall and voyeuristic.”&nbsp;</p><p>Filmmakers are moulded versions of their influences, so if the budding ones are only able to access whatever surfaces on VOD, then the possibility of making art that pushes against that standard becomes near-impossible. Examples like<em> All Quiet…</em> and <em>Atlantics</em> are the anomaly; for the most part, Netflix isn‘t prioritising arthouse and foreign language film. Streaming services operate in the world of media for mass consumption, subject to the same strict distribution rules as every other competitor. As a result, films fall out of their hands, or they can choose to remove a project – or sell off the rights of their projects to other services – should they choose. Their guiding principle is distribution, not preservation.&nbsp;</p><p>Master of scuzzy and distasteful American comedy <a href="https://i-d.co/article/john-waters-on-karma-the-art-of-selling-out-and-dropping-acid-at-70/">John Waters</a> has an allergy towards these new media behemoths. If filmmakers are more concerned with their film existing forever over the money it will make them in the short term, “don’t sell to Netflix,” is his advice. “It’s called show business, not show art.”</p><p>But even with his underground heritage, Waters equally represents the mixed feelings many filmmakers have towards the illegitimate way their work is seen. On one hand, he wants audiences to have access to the films that he makes. Simultaneously, he wants to ensure that he retains control over what those titles are.</p></div>

<div><p>Waters‘ early work, so salacious it has routinely been destroyed by the censorship boards asked to grade it, has become arthouse catnip:&nbsp;films that young cinephiles once had to scourge for on shared VHS tapes are now find on digital clouds and drives. Films like <em>Eat Your Makeup </em>(1968), his 16mm comedy about a kidnapping nanny, and his Divine-starring short <em>The Diane Linkletter Story </em>(1970), have never been officially released, but have found cult audiences online via pirated streams. The source? “Don’t ask me!” he says.</p><p>Waters keeps an eye on what leaks online from his unreleased catalogue and files a Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) request for it to be removed when he spots something. “If you don’t watch over it and you allow it, you lose your copyright,” he says. While he accepts that the ones that have been officially released have been pirated and shared already, he really doesn’t want you to watch the unreleased ones illegally. “I don’t sign them at book signings. Some of those films I don’t want in distribution. They’re too old.” Even so, he appreciates the curated platforms that specialise in vintage films. “When I was starting, the only place you could ever see rare films was college film series,” he says. “Now you can look at every scene and every cut.”</p><p>Even so, no archive is perfect, and that’s where the global community of <em>extremely</em>&nbsp;online cinephiles come in. This June, Rarefilmm’s Whitehead posted a download of <em>Four Letter Word</em>, <a href="https://i-d.co/article/sean-baker-on-the-magical-honesty-of-the-florida-project-and-sliding-into-his-actors-dms/">Sean Baker</a>’s offbeat early comedy from 2000. After posting it, Baker himself reached out, asking Whitehead to delete it as well as&nbsp; <a href="https://i-d.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/bakerrarefilmm.jpg">sharing the news</a> that the film’s 4K restoration would be coming soon. And, later this month, Béla Tarr’s <em>Macbeth</em> will finally <a href="https://film.curzon.com/film/bela-tarr-a-curzon-collection/#synopsis">receive an official release</a> in the UK, via Curzon.&nbsp;</p><p>In the 15 years since Tarr’s <em>Macbeth</em> was last available to purchase, the illegal downloads and streams have helped quell the desires of those who were desperate to watch it, its legacy kept alive by some intrepid internet-literate cinephiles. The work that survives, it turns out, is the work that is out there to be seen.</p></div>

<hr>
<p>So in a nutshell I made this:</p>
<figure><div><p><img alt="An image" src="https://questdb.io/img/blog/2024-10-24/gb-vid.gif" loading="lazy"></p><figcaption>A trading Gameboy</figcaption></div></figure>
<h2 id="the-story">The story<a aria-label="Direct link to The story" title="Direct link to The story" href="https://questdb.io/blog/making-a-trading-gameboy/#the-story">​</a></h2>
<p>I didn't wake up one day thinking I'd make a trading Gameboy.</p>
<p>It all came about gradually. Some might say I fell into a rabbit hole.</p>
<p>While it's satisfying to create something, I took the most pleasure in learning
new things and gradually solving new problems.</p>
<p>This post is to share much of that I have learned.</p>
<h2 id="from-displaying-a-price">From displaying a price...<a aria-label="Direct link to From displaying a price..." title="Direct link to From displaying a price..." href="https://questdb.io/blog/making-a-trading-gameboy/#from-displaying-a-price">​</a></h2>
<p>My kid had a <a href="https://questdb.io/blog/raspberry-pi-5-benchmark/" rel="">Raspberry Pi</a> and he loved it.</p>
<p>Debian came pre-installed with a version of minecraft, and he really enjoyed
having a tiny single-board computer with dangling wires. Unfortunately, the
bare-bones setup was also a weakness and we ended up stepping on the HDMI
connector and rendering the board unusable.</p>
<p>One day, he asked if I could get him a replacement. Upon checking the
<a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Raspberry Pi website</a>, I came across the
Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller and a basic electronic kit with buttons, LEDs,
and a two-line display which seemed more appropriate for his age.</p>
<p>Unlike the Raspberry Pi computer, the Pico is a microcontroller. Mostly this
means it's not running an operating system and instead can run simple code. They
are also typically less powerful with only 256kb of RAM instead of Gigabytes for
the bigger brother, and have a lower clock speed.</p>
<p>However, this also means the controller starts immediately running your code
upon power up, and it does not have to share resources to maintain an underlying
system. This results in low power consumption, making them appropriate for
battery-powered use cases.</p>
<p>After blinking a few coloured LEDs, we found that we could use potentiometers to
control how much electricity would go through the circuit. We could then read
this value from a screen. With some tinkering, we made a calculator which would
multiply two numbers which are set using the potentiometer:</p>
<figure><div><p><img alt="An image" src="https://questdb.io/img/blog/2024-10-24/calculator.webp" loading="lazy"></p><figcaption></figcaption></div></figure>
<p>This was a pretty cool object to bring to school for a demo, and both of us were
pretty satisfied. But it then occurred to me that we could do so much more with
these, particularly as I found that some versions of the Pico microcontroller
contained a wireless chip.</p>
<p>So, as someone deeply interested in finance, I knew that <em>technically</em> nothing
could stop me from connecting to, say, an API and then display stock prices on
the screen. And that's what I ended up doing with the Raspberry Pi Pico, and a
matrix of LEDs:</p>
<figure><div><p><img alt="An image" src="https://questdb.io/img/blog/2024-10-24/led-matrix.webp" loading="lazy"></p><figcaption></figcaption></div></figure>
<p>There were a few variations of this idea with train times and so on, but the
main concept was there. It then occurred to me that simply looking at a price
may not be as interesting, so I started experimenting with charts instead.</p>
<p>This meant using a different display, able to render more details. I found one
called the
<a href="https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/pico-display-pack-2-0?variant=39374122582099" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Pimoroni Pico Display Pack 2.0</a>,
which came with a lot of benefits for my use case.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, it included a socket, which means one can simply fit the
microcontroller to the back of the display and not worry with wires.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Second, it came with 4 built-in buttons which also simplifies wiring.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lastly, it has a
<a href="https://github.com/pimoroni/pimoroni-pico/blob/main/micropython/modules/picographics/README.md" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">pretty robust library</a>
which allows you to display primitives on a screen such as text, lines,
squares, circles, polygons, etc.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<figure><div><p><img alt="An image" src="https://questdb.io/img/blog/2024-10-24/display-pack.webp" loading="lazy"></p><figcaption></figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Above I used the buttons to allow the player to take a long or short position in
the underlying. However, I quickly found the game uninteresting because it was
purely based on luck: Watch a line on the screen and go long/short/flat.</p>
<p>I knew I wanted to gamify this, but had to find a different model to make it
enjoyable.</p>
<h2 id="to-making-markets">...To making markets<a aria-label="Direct link to ...To making markets" title="Direct link to ...To making markets" href="https://questdb.io/blog/making-a-trading-gameboy/#to-making-markets">​</a></h2>
<p>It then occurred to me that a market-making game would be more interesting.</p>
<p>When market-making, you are quoting on both exchanges and over the counter,
hedging in the underlying market and taking/managing risk. A large difference
between market making and the previous game is that in market making, you are
constantly quoting both sides, and other participants come and trade against
you.</p>
<p>But you don't decide whether to buy or sell, your counterparties do. However,
you can then decide what to do with this position, for example hedge it
immediately, warehouse it, etc.</p>
<p>One particularly satisfying dynamic was to offset the flow: Get a position
through someone hitting your quotes and shortly after receive an opposite trade
which closes this position. While you could have closed the position yourself,
waiting for passive flow instead means you don't cross the bid-ask spread and
maximise your margin.</p>
<p>It quickly dawned on me that four buttons would not be sufficient. This led me
to the rabbit hole of 3D printing. I won't go into too much detail here, but I
bought a
<a href="https://www.prusa3d.com/fr/produit/kit-de-l-original-prusa-mini-2/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Prusa Mini +</a>,
some calipers, and after some measurements, a lot of trial and error, and a
lousy soldering job, I ended up with this.</p>
<figure><div><p><img alt="An image" src="https://questdb.io/img/blog/2024-10-24/gameboy-first.webp" loading="lazy"></p><figcaption></figcaption></div></figure>
<h2 id="game-on">Game on!<a aria-label="Direct link to Game on!" title="Direct link to Game on!" href="https://questdb.io/blog/making-a-trading-gameboy/#game-on">​</a></h2>
<p>In this game, there is a red line representing the fair value, and your bid and
offer prices in green and blue. You can control your quotes by increasing or
decreasing the spread, and skewing your quotes up and down to attract more flow
on the side you're axed on (where you have a preference or bias towards buying
or selling).</p>
<p>Say you just bought a lot of XYZ. You probably want to sell and don't want to
buy more of it. You would then skew your quotes down by a few basis points which
makes it more likely for you to sell (you are giving a more aggressive sell
price), and conversely less likely to buy.</p>
<p>However, at this stage I started running into some issues. The first was that
building this was very tedious. I had to solder a lot of cables within this box.
In addition, I was unsatisfied with the software side and the game felt slow and
clunky.</p>
<p>So with the same concept, I went for a complete overhaul.</p>
<h3 id="the-idea-of-the-game">The idea of the game<a aria-label="Direct link to The idea of the game" title="Direct link to The idea of the game" href="https://questdb.io/blog/making-a-trading-gameboy/#the-idea-of-the-game">​</a></h3>
<p>In this game, you act as a market-maker on the ETF markets. Your job is to quote
a tradeable bid price and ask price on the exchange at all times, while
answering OTC requests for larger trades and managing your risk. You control
your prices through algo parameters and fight for being first in the orderbook
on the side you prefer to trade on. You can also place orders manually.</p>
<p>To manage your risk, you can trade in the underlying markets. For example, if
you sell S&amp;P 500 ETFs, you are short. To mitigate this risk, you can buy a hedge
instrument (for example S&amp;P500 futures) which are perfectly correlated to the
ETF and therefore render yourself immune to market movements.</p>
<p>As you trade the ETFs on exchange and OTC, you accumulate risk which you can
choose to neutralise in the hedge markets. Doing so has a cost and reduces the
margin you make on each trade. So does trading the ETF directly with the market
as you'd pay the spread. You can execute hedges via algos such as TWAP which
make your hedge adjust slower, but also at a lower cost since you spread
execution over time.</p>
<p>If you're doing a good job, you capture a lot of flow, win a lot of trade
requests, and don't lose money nor take disproportionate risk. Events such as a
release new financial figures or major news happen from time to time, so you
want to make sure you're not outright long or short when this happens.
Additionally, you don't have the best latency, so you want to avoid keeping your
quotes during figures as you'd be subject to latency arbitrage.</p>
<p>Overall this is a good representation of the dynamics of market-making in the
ETF space, and a good entry point for beginners or junior traders to understand
the basic principles behind it.</p>
<h2 id="improving-the-hardware">Improving the hardware<a aria-label="Direct link to Improving the hardware" title="Direct link to Improving the hardware" href="https://questdb.io/blog/making-a-trading-gameboy/#improving-the-hardware">​</a></h2>
<p>Let's dig more into the constructive details.</p>
<h3 id="pcb">PCB<a aria-label="Direct link to PCB" title="Direct link to PCB" href="https://questdb.io/blog/making-a-trading-gameboy/#pcb">​</a></h3>
<p>To avoid cutting and soldering wires, the solution was a printed circuit board
(PCB). I downloaded <a href="https://www.kicad.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Kicad</a>, which is an open-source PCB
design tool, and got started. To my surprise, the process was much easier than I
thought and I could go from complete zero to ordering my PCBs online in a couple
of days.</p>
<p>The first step is to design the diagram, which means listing all components and
their connections in a schematic way. In my case, the diagram looks like the
following:</p>
<figure><div><p><img alt="An image" src="https://questdb.io/img/blog/2024-10-24/kicad-schema.webp" loading="lazy"></p><figcaption>Click to zoom</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The buttons are on the left-hand side. The microcontroller in the middle, the
display on the right. Other items include the speaker, the on-off button and the
battery management system which handles the lithium battery's charge and
discharge.</p>
<p>Once they are connected like this, the system knows I will need to route traces
between all these connector points, and we can start making the PCB.</p>
<p>To my surprise, the drawing of traces (the electrical connection between two
points) is done by hand. The schematic we just made only helps guiding
connections from one point to another and making sure all connections are
implemented.</p>
<p>So after designing the schematic, it was time to place the components on the
board and to draw the traces to join the related connectors:</p>
<figure><div><p><img alt="An image" src="https://questdb.io/img/blog/2024-10-24/kicad-pcb.webp" loading="lazy"></p><figcaption>Click to zoom</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>I was particularly pleased to find that I could leave some copper exposed to
display text. It's something I found visually attractive.</p>
<p>Anyways, once the components are placed on the board and the connections are
drawn, you can export gerber files which you can then upload on
<a href="https://www.pcbway.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">PCB Way</a> to order the boards. They arrived within 4
days which is impressive considering that their manufacturing involves many
steps, and that they shipped from China.</p>
<h3 id="3d-printed-case">3D printed Case<a aria-label="Direct link to 3D printed Case" title="Direct link to 3D printed Case" href="https://questdb.io/blog/making-a-trading-gameboy/#3d-printed-case">​</a></h3>
<p>Kicad allows us to export the PCB 3D model and footprint. This meant I could
design a case around it to 3D print later:</p>
<figure><div><p><img alt="An image" src="https://questdb.io/img/blog/2024-10-24/pcb-3d.webp" loading="lazy"></p><figcaption></figcaption></div></figure>
<p>What's nice is that you can import the model into something like Autodesk Fusion
360, and then design the case around it. In this instance, I projected the PCB
sketch imported from Kicad (the purple lines) and created a structure around it
using offsets from the Kicad drawing. I left some holes for the screws and used
the feature which automatically models the thread in 3D:</p>

<p>I designed this with the intent of leaving the PCB exposed, so the case was
simply covering the back of the PCB and the battery. The result is the simple
case displayed in red below which 3D-prints in half an hours or so:</p>

<p>As mentioned, there was a lot to improve in the first software iteration.</p>
<p>For this new one, I decided to start from scratch.</p>

<p>The previous game model was based on a random walk of the price. I know, it's
not ideal. But I started this fetching real prices and I soon found that this
was not ideal for a game for a few reasons.</p>
<p>First, in the space of few minutes, the prices don't change that much. Creating
the reference price myself meant I could inject events such as market crashes
and whatnot to spice things up a bit.</p>
<p>Another consideration was that the API calls from the Pico took a long time, and
this was a blocking operation.</p>
<p>The model looks like the following:</p>

<p>Essentially, the whole game is based around a reference price, and that
reference price moves between two ticks following a random walk.</p>
<p>However, I introduced a figures concept whereby at certain moments, economic
figures are released, and the price jumps at that time. Then, markets are more
volatile (the price changes by a larger amount between two ticks), until such
point that it reverts to normal trading mode with standard volatility.</p>
<p>You can think of this reference price as the 'fair' price for the consensus of
market participants.</p>

<p>With a reference price, I can start constructing other concepts. In the previous
iteration, there was only one bid and offer, meaning the player always won the
trades.</p>
<p>Because of this, I simulated the effects of player actions (skew and spread) by
affecting the relative probabilities that a player would receive a trade on
either bid or offer sides at each tick.</p>
<p>In this iteration, I wanted to simulate the dynamics of a real orderbook and
queue position. In the real world, you only get the trade if you're first in the
queue, and I wanted a similar dynamic:</p>

<p>The logic is that traders can add orders to the bid and ask sides of the
orderbook. These are then stored in a heapq.</p>
<p>Since the micropython implementation only implements minheap, I had to store one
of the sides by taking the opposite of the price so that it would be stored in
the correct order. This is why some negative signs appear in the code suce as
this <code>-self.buy_orders[0][0] &gt;= self.sell_orders[0][0]</code>.</p>

<p>Having done this, I could start creating agents. These agents would, for

<p>The result of the above is a stream of orders coming on both sides of the
orderbook.</p>
<p>Some of these orders are resting, and populate the orderbook.</p>
<p>Some are crossing the spread, taking liquidity from the book, and resulting in
trade matches.</p>
<p>When a trade happens, both counterparties are notified, and the risk engine is
updated with the new positions.</p>
<p>This is a simple placeholder for now, but it's relatively easy to implement a
set of smarter agents, each with their own logic and incentives, including
competing market-makers, and arbitrageurs.</p>
<p>The player logic is different and more akin to controlling an algo:</p>

<p>The parameter <code>turn_latency</code> is so that a player's algo can only update quotes
periodically. This replicates the throttling implemented by exchanges whereby
traders cannot continuously update their quotes with every tick.</p>
<p>When the latency has elapsed, a few things happen:</p>
<ol>
<li>The current player quotes are cancelled with the exchange</li>
<li>New quotes are calculated using the current quoting parameters</li>
<li>The quotes are sent back to the exchange.</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition, other orders may be sent automatically to another market for
hedging if the player sets up their algo to automatically hedge the flow.</p>

<p>I decided to split the display into a bunch of sections which can be rendered

<p>So in this case, this is what displays the price in the top-right corner with a
value of 50.22:</p>
<figure><div><p><img alt="An image" src="https://questdb.io/img/blog/2024-10-24/display-price.webp" loading="lazy"></p><figcaption></figcaption></div></figure>
<p>There are multiple other sections like this. The one displaying the chart area,
the one with the controls, the news, the risk section, the market depth chart,
the orderbook table, the trades feed, and so on.</p>
<p>By rendering them independently, I can then place them relatively to one another
and potentially schedule their update cycles at different moments if needed.</p>

<p>It is really easy to program a microcontroller to react to a button press.
Connect the button, and write some micropython like the following:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>import</span><span> machine</span><br></span><span><span>button </span><span>=</span><span> machine</span><span>.</span><span>Pin</span><span>(</span><span>12</span><span>,</span><span> machine</span><span>.</span><span>Pin</span><span>.</span><span>IN</span><span>,</span><span> machine</span><span>.</span><span>Pin</span><span>.</span><span>PULL_UP</span><span>)</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>while</span><span> </span><span>True</span><span>:</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>    </span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>not</span><span> button</span><span>.</span><span>value</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>:</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>        </span><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>'Button pressed!'</span><span>)</span><br></span></code></pre></div>
<p>However when the program becomes larger, this approach stops working. One of the
reasons is that you may be pressing the button at the moment where the loop is
executing some other code.</p>
<p>By the time your code gets back to evaluating <code>button.value()</code>, you may have
released it. Ideally, you'd want your inputs to be immediately registered.</p>
<p>Another consideration is that button presses, from a signal perspective, are not
how one intuitively may think. Instinct tells us that the button is an on/off
switch, and therefore pressing it should look like the following:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span></span><br></span><span><span>____________|-----------------------|__________________</span><br></span><span><span>            ^                       v</span><br></span><span><span>          press                  release</span><br></span></code></pre></div>
<p>However, in practice, it looked more like the following.</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span></span><br></span><span><span>____________|-|_|-|_|-|_|--------|__________________</span><br></span><span><span>            ^                       v</span><br></span><span><span>          press                  release</span><br></span></code></pre></div>
<p>It seems like the signal needs to stabilise after a button press and may
oscillate initially, even if the button is pressed continuously. This has two
consequences.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, it means you may register several presses instead of one.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Second, depending on timing, your software may not register a button press if
the signal jumped to the low state at that exact time.</li>
</ul>
<p>To circumvent this, I used <code>interrupt requests</code> which will monitor a signal
change and interrupt execution to run the routine called by the button press. I
coupled this with a timeout to avoid processing the same button input multiple
times.</p>
<p>In this case, the trigger is the 'falling' edge of the signal:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>    </span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>__init__</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>)</span><span>:</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>        </span><span>from</span><span> machine </span><span>import</span><span> Pin</span><br></span><span><span>        self</span><span>.</span><span>last_change_ms </span><span>=</span><span> ticks_ms</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>        self</span><span>.</span><span>callbacks </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>}</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><br></span><span><span>        self</span><span>.</span><span>red_button </span><span>=</span><span> Pin</span><span>(</span><span>13</span><span>,</span><span> mode</span><span>=</span><span>Pin</span><span>.</span><span>IN</span><span>,</span><span> pull</span><span>=</span><span>Pin</span><span>.</span><span>PULL_UP</span><span>)</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>        self</span><span>.</span><span>red_button</span><span>.</span><span>irq</span><span>(</span><span>trigger</span><span>=</span><span>Pin</span><span>.</span><span>IRQ_FALLING</span><span>,</span><span> handler</span><span>=</span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>red_isr</span><span>)</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><br></span><span><span>    </span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>red_isr</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span><span> pin</span><span>)</span><span>:</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>        </span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>'RE'</span><span> </span><span>in</span><span> self</span><span>.</span><span>callbacks </span><span>and</span><span> time</span><span>.</span><span>ticks_diff</span><span>(</span><span>ticks_ms</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>,</span><span> self</span><span>.</span><span>last_change_ms</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>&gt;</span><span> BTN_FREQ_MS</span><span>:</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>            </span><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>f'</span><span>{</span><span>RED</span><span>}</span><span>BUTTONS</span><span>{</span><span>ENDC</span><span>}</span><span>: notifying button listener </span><span>{</span><span>RED</span><span>}</span><span>RED</span><span>{</span><span>ENDC</span><span>}</span><span>'</span><span>)</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>            self</span><span>.</span><span>callbacks</span><span>[</span><span>'RE'</span><span>]</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>            self</span><span>.</span><span>last_change_ms </span><span>=</span><span> ticks_ms</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><br></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Since the same button may have different functions depending on the context, for
example depending on which menu you are currently in, each button press is
triggering a callback.</p>
<p>Changes in menu context send a list of callbacks to override the previous one
and setup the new actions. I found this made the buttons more generic.</p>
<h3 id="ram-issues">RAM issues<a aria-label="Direct link to RAM issues" title="Direct link to RAM issues" href="https://questdb.io/blog/making-a-trading-gameboy/#ram-issues">​</a></h3>
<p>I quickly ended up with memory issues whereby the program would crash with an
error message such as <code>Memory allocation failed, failed to allocate 256 bytes</code>
or something like this.</p>
<p>What happened here is two things.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, 256kb is not so much</li>
<li>Second, it is relatively easy to end up with memory fragmentation.
Fragmentation means that I have enough bytes in memory to allocate to my
object, however these bytes are not contiguous and scattered across the memory
range making the allocation impossible.</li>
</ul>
<p>I watched a few videos from the creator of
<a href="https://micropython.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">MicroPython</a>, and read documentation online. This led
to a few discoveries which helped.</p>
<h4 id="using-const">Using const()<a aria-label="Direct link to Using const()" title="Direct link to Using const()" href="https://questdb.io/blog/making-a-trading-gameboy/#using-const">​</a></h4>
<p>Say you have config values which won't change at runtime. When defining them as
<code>LOOP_FREQUENCY_MS = 250</code>, this may create a variable which requires more
memory. In this example, the system may allocate 32 bits for an <code>int</code> whereas I
only need 8 bits.</p>
<p>In some instances, for example when writing <code>c = 22 ... a = b x c</code>, I now
understand the compiler may detect that 22 is a constant and therefore apply
this for you, but being explicit does not hurt.</p>
<h4 id="proactive-memory-defragmentation">Proactive memory defragmentation<a aria-label="Direct link to Proactive memory defragmentation" title="Direct link to Proactive memory defragmentation" href="https://questdb.io/blog/making-a-trading-gameboy/#proactive-memory-defragmentation">​</a></h4>
<p>MicroPython has a garbage collection mechanism which triggers automatically.</p>
<p>However, it may only trigger once the memory is already fragmented, and not be
able to help. When starting up the game, I create a lot of objects. As a result,
this may not immediately trigger a connection.</p>
<p>I used <code>gc.collect()</code> profusely at startup and found that this helps make sure
that whatever memory is consumed by my objects is packed tighter together to
reduce fragmentation and its effects down the line.</p>
<h4 id="precompiling">Precompiling<a aria-label="Direct link to Precompiling" title="Direct link to Precompiling" href="https://questdb.io/blog/making-a-trading-gameboy/#precompiling">​</a></h4>
<p>MicroPython is an interpreted language whereby the code you write is transformed
into bytecode at compilation time. However, this compilation happens at startup
on the board itself, and can leave a significant memory footprint behind.</p>
<p>As I was struggling with memory issues, I considered compiling ahead of time,
and copying the files to the board.</p>

<p>This creates a set of <code>.mpy</code> files which are bytecode instead of the <code>.py</code>
files. Taking the compilation step from the board to the computer means less
memory usage and a faster startup time, although the onboard compilation is
quite quick and not noticeable.</p>
<h4 id="buffering">Buffering<a aria-label="Direct link to Buffering" title="Direct link to Buffering" href="https://questdb.io/blog/making-a-trading-gameboy/#buffering">​</a></h4>
<p>I have a few files such as a <code>.txt</code> containing information such as the list of
'fun' news to display during the game. I may be in situations where I cannot
load the file in memory in one go. So to avoid crashing when reading it, I count
the number of lines by reading it in a buffer:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>count_lines</span><span>(</span><span>file</span><span>)</span><span>:</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>    count </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>    </span><span>while</span><span> </span><span>True</span><span>:</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>        </span><span>buffer</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>file</span><span>.</span><span>read</span><span>(</span><span>1024</span><span>)</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>        </span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>not</span><span> </span><span>buffer</span><span>:</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>            </span><span>break</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>        count </span><span>+=</span><span> </span><span>buffer</span><span>.</span><span>count</span><span>(</span><span>'\n'</span><span>)</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>    </span><span>return</span><span> count</span><br></span></code></pre></div>
<p>In a similar way, I tried to steer clear of string variables and holding text in
memory as this can quickly accumulate when collecting objects with text. So
things like <code>side = 'buy'</code> would be transformed into <code>'side_is_buy: True</code> etc.</p>

<p>While I tried to be efficient, the game can be slow if not careful, even when
the microcontroller clocks 133 million times per second. In this section, we'll
look at some learnings which helped me make the game feel more fluid.</p>
<h4 id="multiprocessing">Multiprocessing<a aria-label="Direct link to Multiprocessing" title="Direct link to Multiprocessing" href="https://questdb.io/blog/making-a-trading-gameboy/#multiprocessing">​</a></h4>
<p>The first item is that the Pico has two cores, which means it can run two
processes in parallel. This means I can split the work two-ways and
theoretically do two things at the same time thereby (I simplify) run at twice
the speed.</p>
<p>One difficulty with multiprocessing is potential contention over resources. For
example, trying to modify a variable from one process while the other process is
reading it.</p>
<p>In this case, I decided to organise my two processes such that they are
independent. One runs the background game such as the exchange, bots, the
matching engine, and similar. The other handles the player side such as
rendering the game on screen, processing inputs, and so on.</p>
<p>The initialisation looks like this:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>### Within the main thread...</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>### Start second thread</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>second_thread </span><span>=</span><span> _thread</span><span>.</span><span>start_new_thread</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>second_thread</span><span>,</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>second_thread</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>)</span><span>:</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>    aio</span><span>.</span><span>create_task</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>exchange</span><span>.</span><span>flow</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>    aio</span><span>.</span><span>create_task</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>exchange</span><span>.</span><span>simulate_order_book</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>    aio</span><span>.</span><span>create_task</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>exchange</span><span>.</span><span>cash_market</span><span>.</span><span>flow</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>### Do something else with the first thread</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>from</span><span> game </span><span>import</span><span> Game</span><br></span><span><span>next_step </span><span>=</span><span> Game</span><span>(</span><span>resources</span><span>)</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>while</span><span> </span><span>True</span><span>:</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>    next_step </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>await</span><span> next_step</span><span>.</span><span>flow</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><br></span></code></pre></div>
<h4 id="coroutines">Coroutines<a aria-label="Direct link to Coroutines" title="Direct link to Coroutines" href="https://questdb.io/blog/making-a-trading-gameboy/#coroutines">​</a></h4>
<p>The game consists of many small loops. The bots send orders in a loop at a given
frequency. The player's algo reacts to market data at a given frequency. The
display refreshes at a given frequency; there are many such intervals.</p>
<p>Having all these steps in a loop such as this is not optimal because it forces
all steps to execute sequentially:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>while</span><span> </span><span>True</span><span>:</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>    loop1</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>    loop2</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>    </span><span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span><br></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Fortunately, micropython comes with a built-in implementation of <code>asyncio</code>.</p>
<p>This allows us to setup co-routines, then let them run at a given frequency by
using <code>await aio.sleep_ms(interval)</code>. This pauses the current co-routine and
opens up resources to schedule another co-routine whose execution is due.</p>
<p>Here is an example for the player turn loop, and asynchronous wait:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>async</span><span> </span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>play</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>)</span><span>:</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>    </span><span>while</span><span> self</span><span>.</span><span>playing</span><span>:</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>        self</span><span>.</span><span>rpm_price </span><span>=</span><span> self</span><span>.</span><span>exchange</span><span>.</span><span>rpm</span><span>.</span><span>get_ref_price</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>        self</span><span>.</span><span>player_turn</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>        </span><span>await</span><span> aio</span><span>.</span><span>sleep_ms</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>player_turn_ms</span><span>)</span><br></span></code></pre></div>
<p>What's nice about this is that we can then easily separate the loop frequencies
for all routines, and increase the frequency for critical ones, while decreasing
it for background tasks which don't need a high update rate. All frequencies can
then be setup as <code>Const()</code> in a config file.</p>
<h4 id="overclocking">Overclocking<a aria-label="Direct link to Overclocking" title="Direct link to Overclocking" href="https://questdb.io/blog/making-a-trading-gameboy/#overclocking">​</a></h4>
<p>It would not be a real trading machine if it was not overclocked! Overclocking
means increasing the CPU clock frequency over its default value, in this case
133 Mhz. Doing so is easy in micropython and I found that I could double the
clock frequency without any issues:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>from</span><span> machine </span><span>import</span><span> freq</span><br></span><span><span></span><span>from</span><span> config </span><span>import</span><span> OVERCLOCK_MHZ</span><span>,</span><span> MAX_OVERCLOCK_MHZ</span><span>,</span><span> OVERCLOCK</span><br></span><span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>async</span><span> </span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>main</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>:</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>    </span><span>if</span><span> OVERCLOCK </span><span>and</span><span> OVERCLOCK_MHZ </span><span>&lt;</span><span> MAX_OVERCLOCK_MHZ</span><span>:</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>        freq</span><span>(</span><span>OVERCLOCK_MHZ </span><span>*</span><span> </span><span>1_000_000</span><span>)</span><br></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Overclocking is not without risks however, and the CPU may become unstable or
overheat as a result. So increasing it is possible but with some risks and
downsides such as shortening the life of your device. But doubling the clock
speed in a situation such as this is a quick and easy way to get the performance
boost I need.</p>

<p>Generally, users are guided towards <a href="https://thonny.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Thonny</a> as an IDE. It
is great in many ways. The REPL mode allows you to connect to your board, modify
your code on the device, and run it.</p>
<p>While it's perfect for small scripts such as collecting readings or controlling
a small item, it becomes much more complicated when using more advanced objects,
classes, etc. There is no version control, and very few syntax checks or
highlights.</p>
<p>The process mostly looked like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Update a file on the Pico</li>
<li>Update another file</li>
<li>Save the first file</li>
<li>Run</li>
<li>Error message because the second file was not saved and therefore your code is
broken</li>
<li>Save the second file</li>
<li>Run</li>
<li>Get an error message because you made a small syntax error which was not
highlighted in the IDE</li>
</ul>
<p>A lot of issues I had at runtime were because of typos or small syntax issues
which IDEs equipped with syntax checks would catch instantly and highlight.</p>
<p>On the other hand, using a fully fledged IDE also makes life harder because you
lose the ability to browse and edit files on device. While this would have been
a no-go due to the annoying overhead of copying the code across many times over,
I found that using a small script helped a lot and rendered this step painless.</p>
<p>To that end, I used
<a href="https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/reference/mpremote.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">mpremote</a> to
copy all my files to the board and lastly start the program:</p>

<p>QuestDB is a monster for <a href="https://questdb.io/market-data/" rel="">market data</a>. The Pico microcontroller
includes a wireless chip. So it's possible to connect it to the network, and
then to issue http requests to send data to a QuestDB instance.</p>
<p>Connecting to the wifi is pretty simple in micropython:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>connect_to_wifi</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>)</span><span>:</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>  wlan </span><span>=</span><span> network</span><span>.</span><span>WLAN</span><span>(</span><span>network</span><span>.</span><span>STA_IF</span><span>)</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>  wlan</span><span>.</span><span>active</span><span>(</span><span>True</span><span>)</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>  wlan</span><span>.</span><span>connect</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>ssid</span><span>,</span><span> self</span><span>.</span><span>pwd</span><span>)</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>  </span><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>f'connecting </span><span>{</span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>ssid</span><span>}</span><span>'</span><span>)</span><br></span></code></pre></div>
<p>And then we can sending data using a raw HTTP request. For example something
like this:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>send_results</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>)</span><span>:</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>    query </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>f"INSERT INTO game(ref_price,timestamp, p_bid, p_ask, skew, pnl) "</span><span> \</span><br></span><span><span>            </span><span>f"VALUES("</span><span> \</span><br></span><span><span>            </span><span>f"</span><span>{</span><span>str</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>current_ref_price</span><span>)</span><span>}</span><span>,"</span><span> \</span><br></span><span><span>            </span><span>f"systimestamp(),"</span><span> \</span><br></span><span><span>            </span><span>f"</span><span>{</span><span>str</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>current_player_bid</span><span>)</span><span>}</span><span>,"</span><span> \</span><br></span><span><span>            </span><span>f"</span><span>{</span><span>str</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>current_player_ask</span><span>)</span><span>}</span><span>,"</span><span> \</span><br></span><span><span>            </span><span>f"</span><span>{</span><span>str</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>player_skew</span><span>)</span><span>}</span><span>,"</span><span> \</span><br></span><span><span>            </span><span>f"</span><span>{</span><span>str</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>player_pnl</span><span>)</span><span>}</span><span>)"</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>    full_url </span><span>=</span><span> self</span><span>.</span><span>url </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>"?query="</span><span> </span><span>+</span><span> self</span><span>.</span><span>url_encode</span><span>(</span><span>query</span><span>)</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>    </span><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>full_url</span><span>)</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>    </span><span>try</span><span>:</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>        requests</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>url</span><span>=</span><span>full_url</span><span>)</span><br></span></code></pre></div>
<p>I can then setup a Grafana dashboard with queries such as the following:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>SELECT</span><span> </span><span>timestamp</span><span>,</span><span> ref_price</span><span>,</span><span> p_bid player_bid</span><span>,</span><span> p_ask player_ask</span><br></span><span><span></span><span>FROM</span><span> game</span><br></span><span><span></span><span>WHERE</span><span> $__timeFilter</span><span>(</span><span>timestamp</span><span>)</span><br></span></code></pre></div>
<p>And tada!</p>
<p>Game stats are flowing in realtime into a QuestDB instance and displayed live in
a <a href="https://questdb.io/docs/third-party-tools/grafana/" rel="">Grafana</a> dashboard. Of course, I
<a href="https://questdb.io/blog/increase-grafana-refresh-rate-frequency/" rel="">set the refresh frequency to 250ms</a>
for more of a true HFT feel:</p>
<figure><div><p><img alt="An image" src="https://questdb.io/img/blog/2024-10-24/game-on-grafana.webp" loading="lazy"></p><figcaption>Click to zoom</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>It's pretty satisfying to see the quotes adjusting automatically to market
price. With more time, I could change the algo to adjust to the orderbook, fight
for position, or come up with many other creative situations.</p>
<p>Another satisfying thing is to watch the autohedge get to work when I cross my
threshold parameter. This threshold is dynamic, meaning that I can adjust it
over the game depending on my current risk appetite. As soon as it's crossed, it
sends orders in the other orderbook to hedge in the underlying.</p>
<p>What's less satisfying is my performance in this game. In this instance, it was
all going well until figures occurred. I was making money from the spread
collected on the flow. But when figures came out, I had a small short
position... and the markets jumped up.</p>
<p>Consequently, my PnL went from positive to negative. While I remembered to pull
quotes (I would have been demolished by arbitrage otherwise because I have
higher latency than the market), I didn't completely flatten my position.</p>
<p>I'll do better next time!</p>
<h2 id="in-conclusion">In conclusion<a aria-label="Direct link to In conclusion" title="Direct link to In conclusion" href="https://questdb.io/blog/making-a-trading-gameboy/#in-conclusion">​</a></h2>
<p>While accidental, this experience was very enriching for a few reasons.</p>
<p>First, as someone who always worked in dematerialised things (data, trading,
computers), it was great to work on something tangible and physical. There is a
pleasure in creation and this opened new perspectives in terms of daring to do
things with my hands such as fixing something at home or building.</p>
<p>I naturally feel more at home with a computer than with a hammer, and people in
the opposite situation tell me they are scared of computers. It's great to
realise that going from one to the other is possible, and feels great.</p>
<p>Second, I was amazed to discover 3D printers and CAD design. The state of
tooling is such that one can very easily design a part (PCB or other physical
object) to solve real world problems with infinitely more satisfaction than just
buying something off-the-shelf.</p>
<p>For example, my bedside table lamp comes with shades, and there is a set of two
disks which screw on the lamp shaft to hold the shade in place. These broke, and
within a few minutes I could print replacements for a fraction of the cost with
multiples of the satisfaction.</p>
<p>Most people I know have never seen such a machine before and I envy them for
their ability to see it in action for the first time materialising an object
before their eyes.</p>
<p>Third, I am truly impressed by the Raspberry Pi Pico, and the micropython
language. When I think microcontroller, I think toothbrush control or small RC
remote. But seeing it run an exchange, orderbook, matching engine, and
refreshing a display for a cost of around $8 is truly impressive.</p>
<p>They just released a new version with more cores, more memory, and other
features, and I can't wait to try it for other projects and to see what more
skilled makers will make of it!</p>

					<p>Over the past two decades, Google has hosted two different internal platforms for predictions. Why did the first one fail — and will the other endure?</p>
				<div>
											<div><p>It’s July 2005. Google is the darling of Silicon Valley. It has just unveiled Google Maps; Gmail is still in beta. Next year it will acquire YouTube and launch Google Translate.</p><p>The week’s new hires file past a full-size dinosaur skeleton in the courtyard on the way to their first TGIF — the company’s weekly all-hands. They wear beanies with red, yellow, green, and blue colors — like the yet-to-be-designed Chrome logo — with a propeller on top. They are here to see Google’s founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, both wearing shorts and plain colored t-shirts, banter about new tech.</p><p>In the first line of their Founders’ IPO letter, Page and Brin wrote “Google is not a conventional company.” They sought to provide “unbiased, accurate and free access to information.” On this Friday, Patri Friedman, the grandson of Milton Friedman, and Bo Cowgill, now an economics professor at Columbia University, are here to talk about Google’s next bet to do this: an internal prediction market called Prophit.</p><p>On stage next to Larry Page, Friedman and Cowgill announce winners from Prophit’s first quarter and show statistical results on its forecasting accuracy. Prophit was popular inside Google. Over the next three years, about 20% of all Google employees would place bets.</p><p>Two months after this presentation, <em>The </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/26/business/at-google-the-workers-are-placing-their-bets.html"><em>New York Times</em> covered Prophit</a>. They wrote about it again <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/07/technology/07link.html">in 2008</a>, and it became a <a href="https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=34562"><em>Harvard Business Review</em> case-study</a>. Despite the momentum, in March 2010, Prophit hit a major roadblock in its public launch as an external product. It attempted a pivot, and ultimately shut down in 2011.</p></div>

  </p>
  </figure>
</div>
											<div><p>In April 2020, almost exactly 15 years after Prophit launched, and one month after employees worldwide were sent home due to COVID-19, I launched Google’s second internal prediction market, called Gleangen.<sup>

    <span id="fnref-1">
        1    </span>
    <!-- </a> -->
</sup>
 By late 2022, about 8% of Google employees had placed a bet on Gleangen. The company had grown so large that 8% represented 15,000 people — ten times the number of employees that placed bets on Prophit. Gleangen sustained over 1,000 monthly traders, more than the popular forecasting platforms <a href="https://www.metaculus.com/">Metaculus</a> (where I later served as CTO) and <a href="https://manifold.markets/stats">Manifold</a> at the time.<sup>

</sup>
</p><p>Outside of Google, prediction markets have once again been thrust into the spotlight. Weeks before it became a mainstream view, users on sites like PredictIt and Metaculus predicted not only that President Biden would drop his reelection campaign but that <a href="https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/prediction-markets-suggest-replacing">doing so would increase the Democrats’ chance of winning</a>. Over the next few months, swings in election prediction markets regularly made national news,  and despite some distortions caused by aggressive whales, the markets <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-06/donald-trump-win-betting-markets-prediction-websites-nailed-election-forecast?cmpid=BBD110724_MONEYSTUFF&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_term=241107&amp;utm_campaign=moneystuff&amp;embedded-checkout=true">ultimately </a><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-06/donald-trump-win-betting-markets-prediction-websites-nailed-election-forecast?embedded-checkout=true">performed</a><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-06/donald-trump-win-betting-markets-prediction-websites-nailed-election-forecast?cmpid=BBD110724_MONEYSTUFF&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_term=241107&amp;utm_campaign=moneystuff&amp;embedded-checkout=true"> well</a>. Theoretically, prediction markets are equally powerful when used by companies to anticipate events, such as predicting their competitors’ next moves.</p><p>But as Cowgill has shown, corporate prediction markets have <a href="https://academic.oup.com/restud/article-abstract/82/4/1309/2607345?login=false">a mixed track record</a>, as evidenced by attempts at Google and many other companies. Why is this? What does it take to make them work? The inside story of Prophit and Gleangen, the two largest corporate prediction markets ever run, offers some lessons.</p></div>
											<p><h2>A new type of information economy</h2>
</p>
											<div><p>Probably the first corporate prediction market was built in 1990 by economist Robin Hanson for employees of the doomed hypertext startup Project Xanadu. It had 18 participants, who bet on questions like whether cold fusion would be developed by 1991. The decade was dotted with other prediction market experiments, like the Iowa Electronic Markets (an online real money prediction platform established in 1988) and Hollywood Stock Exchange (a 1996 virtual market for film-related options).</p><p>Researchers like Hanson and others, such as the economist Justin Wolfers, worked out some of the implementation details from this data. Crucially, they also showed that most markets — whether operating with either real or play money — were relatively accurate, much more so than even the most accurate individuals. In 2004, the journalist James Surowjecki published the widely-read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wisdom_of_Crowds"><em>The Wisdom of Crowds</em></a>, detailing cases where collective judgment surpassed individual expertise. Cowgill read the book the same year, and decided to start a prediction market at Google.</p><p>The company had some key ingredients to make a market work. First, it had a culture open to experimentation. Googlers were famously permitted 20% of their working hours to experiment on new products.<sup>
    <!-- <a id="fnref-3" href="#fn-3"> -->
    <span id="fnref-3">
        3    </span>
    <!-- </a> -->
</sup>
 Cowgill posted his idea for “Google Decision Markets” on a message board. Engineers Ilya Kirnos, Doug Banks, and Piaw Na responded to help, and Patri Friedman joined the project a few months later.</p><p>A second ingredient was Google’s economic expertise. Hal Varian, Google’s chief economist then and now, wrote <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Rules">the book</a> on the economics of the internet, and helped design Google’s famous ad auction system. On Hal’s suggestion, the Prophit team used the prediction market structure first <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2117471">described</a> by economists at the University of Iowa and based on the Iowa Electronic Markets.<sup>

</p><p>Prophit launched to Google employees in April 2005. Market prices were featured on the company intranet home page. It was an immediate hit.</p></div>

											<div><p>In Google’s early days, long before it became a blue-chip stock, its offices were full of LEGOs, ball-pits, and Magic the Gathering cards. Product design mirrored office design, and Google built applications full of bright colors, easter eggs, and April Fools’ jokes.</p><p>Prophit was such a product: serious with a dash of whimsy. Markets tracked over 60% of all Google quarterly objectives, such as “How many Gmail users will there be by the end of Q2?” Some questions aimed to predict its competitors' next moves, such as “Will Apple launch a computer based on Intel's Power PC chip?” Yet one third of all markets were marked as “fun,” of interest to employees but with no clear connection to Google’s business (e.g., the quality of Star Wars Episode III or gas prices).</p><p><a href="https://funginstitute.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/CorporatePredictionMarkets1.pdf">Cowgill</a> told me an anecdote of both the seriousness and the whimsy. A senior executive saw Prophit give a very low probability that the company would complete the hire of a new senior executive on time (filling the position had been a quarterly objective for the past six quarters). “The betting on this goal was extremely harsh. I am shocked and outraged by the lack of brown-nosing at this company,” the executive said to laughter in a company-wide meeting. But the market was the nudge the execs needed. They subsequently “made some hard decisions” to complete the hire on time.</p><p>The crowd of Googlers produced accurate predictions, spurred by competition for $10,000 of awards each quarter, plus the even-more-valuable prestige of the leaderboards. In a <a href="https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/services.google.com/en//blog_resources/google_prediction_market_paper.pdf">2009 paper</a> which analyzed the first 2.5 years of Prophit, Cowgill found that the platform demonstrated high calibration that improved over time. (It wasn’t perfect. There was an optimism bias — bettors thought positive outcomes for Google would happen more often than they actually did.<sup>

</sup>
 There were also strong correlations in the bets made by people who sat within a few feet of each other.)</p><p>But that was just Prophit’s internal beta. The product was designed to launch externally, not to be an internal decision-making tool. It was meant to become Google’s next world-changing innovation in information technology.</p></div>
											<p><h2>Economists vs. the United States</h2>
</p>
											<div><p>Google pioneered many now standard tech practices: on-site cafés, A/B tests, and “dogfooding,” or first releasing new products internally where they can be improved before launching to the public.&nbsp;</p><p>Prophit was a logical next step in the company's mission to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful. That included all the world’s books, all the world’s roads, and all the world’s languages — why not all the information in the heads of the world’s humans? Prediction markets offered a mechanism to systematically elicit reliable information from human judgment. Cowgill relayed to me what happened next, a previously unreported chapter in the Prophit story.&nbsp;</p><p>The biggest obstacle preventing Prophit’s public launch was the inconvenient fact that online gambling was (mostly) illegal, and the laws surrounding it were not uniform across states. States attorneys general could claim Prophit fell within their jurisdiction, requiring Google to adhere to 50 different state policies.<sup>

</sup>
</p><p>Prophit, along with Google’s legal and policy teams, developed a strategy to convince a federal regulator to pre-emptively assert jurisdiction over Prophit. It was Google’s opinion that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission would be the most natural and friendly regulator, in part because the CFTC had already issued a "<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/sites/default/files/files/foia/repfoia/foirf0503b004.pdf">no action letter</a>" protecting the Iowa Electronic Markets<sup>

</sup>
 back in 1993. In May 2008, the CFTC <a href="https://www.cftc.gov/LawRegulation/FederalRegister/e8-9981.html">published </a>a letter expressing concerns about the potential overlap between prediction markets and gambling, but left the door open for possible exemptions, and invited public comments on how to regulate such markets..</p><p>The CFTC staffed many economists, and they seemed to understand the moment. That same month, an article called <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1157679"><em>The Promise of Prediction Markets</em></a> appeared in the prestigious journal <em>Science</em>, arguing that prediction markets held too much research and decision-making potential to be fettered by government restrictions. Its authors included four Nobel laureates in economics, numerous academic proponents of markets (including Philip Tetlock, Robin Hanson, and Robert Forsythe), as well as Google’s own Hal Varian.</p><p>Google hired a lobbying firm with extensive CFTC ties. They also organized support from Yahoo! and Microsoft, where prediction markets had been popular among senior executives. The three companies, despite their rivalry in their core markets, <a href="https://www.cftc.gov/sites/default/files/idc/groups/public/@lrfederalregister/documents/frcomment/08-004c029.pdf">jointly</a> <a href="https://www.cftc.gov/sites/default/files/idc/groups/public/@lrfederalregister/documents/frcomment/08-004c031.pdf">backed</a> a single proposal for the CFTC to legalize prediction markets. In March 2010, Cowgill and Ilya Kirnos, another of Prophit’s creators, went to Washington to lobby this proposal to the CFTC, as well as officials in the White House and Congress.</p><p>But by the time the CFTC digested Google's proposal, the political appetite for financial deregulation had changed. The 2008 financial crisis hit its peak with the collapse of Lehman brothers in September. In the interim years, many had come to blame the crisis on the lack of oversight of new financial products. In July 2010, just a few months after Cowgill and Kirnos’s visit to Washington, the Dodd-Frank Act was passed, overhauling nearly all federal financial regulatory agencies. According to Googlers working on Prophit in DC and Mountain View, despite Silicon Valley’s organized push, the intellectual momentum for regulatory reform had died.</p></div>

  </p>
  </figure>
</div>
											<div><p>As the meetings in DC stalled, so too did progress back in Mountain View. Cowgill told me that it became hard to get resources to continue lobbying — and, crucially, engineering headcount to support the external launch. This put Prophit in limbo.&nbsp;</p><p>Although internally successful, without a path to a public launch, it underwent a surprising — if brief — pivot. Cowgill had by that point joined Hal Varian’s economics team, where he tried to implement prediction markets within different projects. One such project was a social network for Chinese users because Google Plus (Google’s attempt at a social network) was blocked there. Cowgill, together with engineers in Chinese offices, integrated Prophit’s engine to power a forecasting feature in the app. But it failed to take off, and Google later killed the project.&nbsp;</p><p>By that point, most of Prophit’s core team had moved on. Friedman left in 2008 to start the Seasteading Institute. Banks and Na left Google in 2010. Kirnos kept running markets until the last ones paid out in mid-2011 and left in 2012 for a startup that was later acquired by Twitter. Cowgill started a PhD in Economics at Berkeley. “I regret that we shut down Prophit,” he wrote to the Prophit group in 2012. “We should have treated the internal instance as a product in its own right, not as a stepping stone to going public.”</p></div>
											<p><h2>The flow of information at Waymo</h2>
</p>
											<div><p>I’d been fascinated by prediction markets since I graduated college in 2011. I read about Prophit, and I was influenced by the same intellectual momentum that had brought Cowgill and Kirnos to Washington. I joined Google in 2014, where I worked first on Google Search and then on Google Translate. In early 2018, I had been promoted twice to Senior Software Engineer, and I began looking for new opportunities.</p><p>I dug up all the code and internal emails on Prophit that I could find. Cowgill’s e-mail expressing regret for not pursuing Prophit as an internal-only app caught my attention. Why not build a new prediction market, I thought, only this time designed <em>from the beginning</em> to influence decision making inside Google?</p><p>I met with Cowgill, Friedman, and Varian. All three expressed reservations about trying again — as did my friends from other divisions, whom I would need to help me pitch Area 120, Google’s in-house incubator for full-time “20% projects,” to staff “Prophit 2.0.” And so I set the idea aside and instead found a role on the systems engineering team at the self-driving car company Waymo. But while at Waymo, I quickly found a concrete use case for a prediction market.<br>Waymo’s systems engineering team measured safety through a variety of metrics from real driving, simulated driving, and models. Yet this data was fragmented — different orgs across the 1,000 person company had different access levels, and worse, different definitions for what they were measuring.</p><p>I was working on a new metric modeling the chance of collision from a particular maneuver. I spoke with engineers about how their projects might improve safety as measured by this metric. Opinions differed widely. And this was crucial information — engineering prioritization at the highest level depended on expectations of which potential projects would most likely improve safety of various car maneuvers.</p><p>I realized I could get the most accurate assessments of the likely impact of projects by aggregating the predictions of the crowd of engineers. And I could envision how these predictions could change priorities in practice, thanks to two famous stories of goals in Waymo’s history, the two “Founder’s Challenges.”</p><p>In the first, in early 2009, Larry Page <a href="https://waymo.com/blog/2020/04/in-the-drivers-seat-1000-mile-challenge/">challenged</a> what was then known as Project Chauffeur to complete 10 different autonomously driven 100-mile routes in California within two years. The team succeeded with three months to spare. Page’s second challenge, issued in 2015, was for Waymo to provide 1,000 driverless rides per week within one year. On this challenge, the company fell far short. By 2020, five years later, the company was still only completing about <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/sdc-prod/v1/safety-report/Waymo-Public-Road-Safety-Performance-Data.pdf">50-200 such rides each week</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>This reminded me of Cowgill’s anecdote about the senior manager who used Prophit to intervene on a failing initiative. I imagined what would have happened if the second Founder’s Challenge had had a company-wide betting pool on when the milestone would be met. Might a Waymo executive have done what the early Google executive had done — intervened when the probability of success dropped, asked bettors why the outcome was in doubt, and changed course?</p><p>I decided to build a prediction market to find out, using my team’s safety metrics as the targets to forecast. I made a prototype, onboarded employees, sourced predictions, got UX feedback, and iterated. Once I had minimal liquidity, I presented the resulting forecasts to every senior manager that would take a meeting.</p><p>In 2019, although Waymo had by then become a separate company from Google, it was in many ways still attached. It had never moved out of the warehouse it shared with Google X. It used the same HR system and the same tech stack. I even continued to use my Google laptop and Google badge.&nbsp;</p><p>In one key way, though, Waymo was not like Google. Access to data was much more restricted.</p><p>Prophit worked, in part, because of internal transparency. When a market forecast how many Gmail users would join next quarter, it was based on a value that was visible to everyone at Google. Google was famously internally transparent compared to other tech giants.</p><p>One Waymo VP, upon seeing these safety metric forecasts, said this would help communicate these metrics across company divisions. And then, to my amazement, he said this was counter to his division’s goal to <em>restrict</em> information like this. The core mechanism of prediction markets — using the wisdom of crowds — can be antithetical to the common management desire to control who knows what.<sup>

</sup>
</p><p>I failed to find any management support for the prediction market. But I had seen the potential. Less than one year after joining Waymo, I searched Google job listings for the role most aligned with forecasting, got a role on the supply chain forecasting team, and transferred back to the mothership.</p></div>

											<p><h2>The end of Google’s 20% culture</h2>
</p>
											<div><p>In early February 2020, one month after I started my new role, I saw a question on Metaculus asking if a new coronavirus <a href="https://www.metaculus.com/questions/3530/how-many-people-will-die-as-a-result-of-the-2019-novel-coronavirus-covid-19-before-2021/">might lead</a> to a global pandemic. One month later, all 150,000 Alphabet employees were sent home. Demand for information surged, and management didn’t have answers. So I used my extra time in lockdown to revamp and relaunch what I was now calling Gleangen as a prediction market for all Google employees.</p><p>Early markets, bet on by thousands of employees, centered on our uncertain future: when offices would re-open in various countries, the date vaccines would be available, and how at-home and in-office work would be balanced. Several times, such markets gave high probabilities to the creation of pandemic policies long before they were actually enacted.</p><p>My main challenge in making Gleangen a useful internal tool for strategy was generating enough users, bets, and liquidity on markets about Google’s core businesses. Over the next 18 months, while working my day job in supply chain forecasting, I wrote, predicted, and resolved over a thousand such markets. I grew a mailing list and chat group, and hosted socials, unconferences, and talks. As Prophit had done, I got approval to pay out valuable prizes to complement the play-money leaderboards. I posted links to Gleangen on so many internal memes that people told me to stop. I once spent an entire weekend hanging flyers in every bathroom I could access across dozens of buildings in campuses across the Bay Area.&nbsp;</p><p>I never presented at TGIF, though Google CEO Sundar Pichai did answer a TGIF question about a Gleangen market. And while the time for puff pieces from <em>The</em> <em>New York Times</em> about Google had long passed, I did manage to get approval to write a <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/solutions-how-tos/design-patterns-in-googles-prediction-market-on-google-cloud">public piece</a> in December 2021 that — while mostly an ad for Google Cloud — explained the basics of prediction markets, highlighted Gleangen’s over 10,000 users, and included screenshots of the interface.</p><p>Like Prophit, Gleangen only got official staffing after achieving success from its incubation during engineers’ “20% time.” It was official company policy that all Google employees in good standing could work on projects of their choosing one day per week, as long as they were for the benefit of Google. Internal job postings listed hundreds of 20% project opportunities.</p><p>But by 2020, despite no change in official policy, the concept of 20% time at Google was on life-support.<sup>
    <!-- <a id="fnref-9" href="#fn-9"> -->
    <span id="fnref-9">
        9    </span>
    <!-- </a> -->
</sup>
 None of the three managers I had during this phase approved of me spending one day a week on Gleangen. (Neither did any of the over 20 other 20% contributors I recruited to administer the site, add features, and manage contests.) Gleangen became my full-time job in early 2022.&nbsp;</p></div>
											<p><h2>The wisdom of the Googler crowd</h2>
</p>
											<div><p>From the beginning, my plan was to learn from Cowgill, Friedman, and Varian’s experience — and mistakes — with Prophit. “The plan we executed was to focus on having as much adoption, buzz, and usage by employees as possible,” Cowgill told me. “Google was making choices about public products based on buzz and adoption, with the mantra of ‘user growth now, monetize later.’” What they didn’t do, he said, was sell their product to decision-makers the way one might sell enterprise decision support software. “That's probably how it should be done,” he said, ”with lots of consulting and oversight of each application and client.”</p><p>So I ran pilots to produce useful forecasts for division after division, from Nest to the Quantum Computing team. While most managers were supportive, few were willing to allocate resources.</p><p>I was well aware of the known obstacles to prediction market adoption in the workplace: unwillingness to share data, the desire for plausible deniability when projects fail, the risks of market manipulation, and good old-fashioned status quo bias. But in hindsight, my almost three-year struggle before I got official staffing for Gleangen came down to poor execution on exactly what Cowgill advised: understanding client needs. I had a somewhat utopian view of the value of information. I put some, but not enough, effort into figuring out the messy details on how to operationalize the wisdom of Googlers into a valuable resource for managers.</p><p>Even in cases where managers wanted explicit probabilistic forecasts, a prediction market turned out to be a tough sell. I tried to launch an initiative to use Gleangen to augment the forecasts Google made to drive purchasing decisions of computers, power, and land for its data centers. There was a seemingly strong need for accuracy in the forecasts — too high, and Google could spend hundreds of millions of dollars overprovisioning; too low, and core Google products like Adwords could run out of resources.</p><p>Most managers of the supply chain forecasting teams accepted the premise that Gleangen would improve accuracy. But accuracy wasn’t their top priority. Supply chain forecasts were produced and used by many teams totalling hundreds of people.&nbsp; Managers were incentivized to improve the forecasting process’ transparency, adjustability, accountability, and interoperability with other systems. They didn’t stand to benefit much even if Gleangen did improve the final accuracy of the forecasts. And my initiative exposed them to risk of disrupting many of the subtler roles the process provided, such as value judgments on which parts of Google’s business should get scarce data center resources. I didn’t offer to serve their real needs as if they were enterprise customers, as Cowgill had advised.</p><p>This challenge of operationalizing the wisdom of the Googlers came to a climax when we began forecasting perhaps the most important development in Google’s recent history: large language models.</p></div>
											<p><h2>Forecasting AI</h2>
</p>
											<div><p>Shortly after Gleangen launched in April 2020, I read OpenAI’s technical report on GPT-3. By early 2022, I was convinced that properly developing LLMs was the most important challenge Google faced. This was a chance to use collective intelligence to improve the chance of success of an important outcome.</p><p>I met with the leads of the core LLM teams inside Google Research, then called <a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/lamda/">LaMDA</a>. Together we devised two types of markets: technical LLM milestones and the integration of LLMs in Google products. We secured a budget to incentivize extra participation with prizes and launched the “LLM Forecasting Contest.”</p><p>Six months into the contest, OpenAI released ChatGPT. Its success sent Google’s top executives scrambling. Most employees close to the development of LLMs, and those who used LaMDA internally, were much less surprised than management. But at a company as large as Google, information — even critical information — sometimes doesn’t percolate up to the top.</p><p>This was exactly the sort of problem I’d built Gleangen to solve. But, to my dismay, I realized we hadn’t produced the information executives really needed. We asked questions of the type “Will Google integrate LLMs into Gmail by Spring 2023?” and “How many parameters will the next LaMDA model have?” Yet what executives would have wanted to know was “Will <em>Microsoft</em> integrate LLMs into <em>Outlook</em> by Spring 2023?” and “How many parameters will the next <em>GPT</em> model have?”</p><p>This turns out to be a general lesson from running a corporate prediction market. Forecasting internal progress, and acting on that information, requires solving complex operational problems and understanding the <a href="https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2020/05/23/mazes-sequence-summary/">moral mazes</a> that managers face. Forecasting competitors’ progress has almost none of these problems.</p><p>It’s conceivable that many executives would have consulted Gleangen in 2022 for forecasts on Microsoft, OpenAI, and Anthropic. This could have enshrined the wisdom of the Googler crowd as a critical source of information, giving individual employees an ability to directly influence senior management by contributing high-quality information. It could have delivered on Friedman and Cowgill’s original vision of prediction markets as part of Google’s core mission: organizing the information inside people’s heads and making it systematically useful.</p><p>We learned from this experience. Gleangen became a staffed part of Google’s Behavioral Economics team shortly after this LLM forecasting contest started. I left Google in October of 2022 to serve as the CTO of Metaculus, but as of August 2024, the team continues to refine its approach to make Gleangen a useful source of information for Google senior management.</p></div>

											<p><h2>Looking to the future</h2>
</p>
											<div><p>As <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/dQhjwHA7LhfE8YpYF/prediction-markets-in-the-corporate-setting">Nuño Sempere, Misha Yagudin, and Eli Lifland wrote in 2021</a>, a successful corporate prediction market needs to cost less than the value of information it produces. I see the path forward in two improvements to this cost-benefit analysis. First, it must present leadership with more valuable information. All the examples of predictions in this article — executive hires, self-driving car safety metrics, COVID-19 workplace policies, datacenter costs, and LLM progress — could be useless or pivotal, depending on the process around it and the needs of the internal customer.</p><p>Second, AI could make the forecasts cheaper to produce. Sarah Pratt, a researcher at DeepMind, and members of the Gleangen team released a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04446">paper</a> in June which compared bettors on Gleangen to predictions from PaLM 2, an LLM developed by Google. In brief, that paper — as well as several others recently released — show AI forecasts are much better than chance, but not nearly as accurate as a human crowd, at least not yet. Their paper also highlights another way AI helps with the cost-benefit of corporate prediction markets: they increase the value of the wisdom of the human crowd by using it for evaluation, and perhaps soon the training, of AI systems.</p><p>As the economists, engineers, and researchers running corporate prediction markets improve this value proposition, they may realize the now decades-old vision of Bo Cowgill and others. They are buoyed by the popularity of real-money public markets like Polymarket and Kalshi.<sup>

 At the Manifest conference this summer, run by the prediction market Manifold, Keri Warr, a member of the technical staff at Anthropic, announced that Anthropic has launched an internal prediction market with a “focus on decision-makers.” Time will tell whether Anthropic’s employees, in concert with Claude, will produce information that helps steer the direction of the company — and if so, whether more companies will follow them.&nbsp;</p></div>

</p>
<p dir="auto"><em>TinyTroupe</em> is an experimental Python library that allows the <strong>simulation</strong> of people with specific personalities, interests, and goals. These artificial agents - <code>TinyPerson</code>s - can listen to us and one another, reply back, and go about their lives in simulated <code>TinyWorld</code> environments. This is achieved by leveraging the power of Large Language Models (LLMs), notably GPT-4, to generate realistic simulated behavior. This allow us to investigate a wide range of <strong>convincing interactions</strong> and <strong>consumer types</strong>, with <strong>highly customizable personas</strong>, under <strong>conditions of our choosing</strong>. The focus is thus on <em>understanding</em> human behavior and not on directly <em>supporting it</em> (like, say, AI assistants do) -- this results in, among other things, specialized mechanisms that make sense only in a simulation setting. Further, unlike other <em>game-like</em> LLM-based simulation approaches, TinyTroupe aims at enlightening productivity and business scenarios, thereby contributing to more successful projects and products. Here are some application ideas to <strong>enhance human imagination</strong>:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Advertisement:</strong> TinyTroupe can <strong>evaluate digital ads (e.g., Bing Ads)</strong> offline with a simulated audience before spending money on them!</li>
<li><strong>Software Testing:</strong> TinyTroupe can <strong>provide test input</strong> to systems (e.g., search engines, chatbots or copilots) and then <strong>evaluate the results</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Training and exploratory data:</strong> TinyTroupe can generate realistic <strong>synthetic data</strong> that can be later used to train models or be subject to opportunity analyses.</li>
<li><strong>Product and project management:</strong> TinyTroupe can <strong>read project or product proposals</strong> and <strong>give feedback</strong> from the perspective of <strong>specific personas</strong> (e.g., physicians, lawyers, and knowledge workers in general).</li>
<li><strong>Brainstorming:</strong> TinyTroupe can simulate <strong>focus groups</strong> and deliver great product feedback at a fraction of the cost!</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">In all of the above, and many others, we hope experimenters can <strong>gain insights</strong> about their domain of interest, and thus make better decisions.</p>
<p dir="auto">We are releasing <em>TinyTroupe</em> at a relativelly early stage, with considerable work still to be done, because we are looking for feedback and contributions to steer development in productive directions. We are particularly interested in finding new potential use cases, for instance in specific industries.</p>
<div dir="auto"><p dir="auto">Note</p><p dir="auto">🚧 <strong>WORK IN PROGRESS: expect frequent changes</strong>.
TinyTroupe is an ongoing research project, still under <strong>very significant development</strong> and requiring further <strong>tidying up</strong>. In particular, the API is still subject to frequent changes. Experimenting with API variations is essential to shape it correctly, but we are working to stabilize it and provide a more consistent and friendly experience over time. We appreciate your patience and feedback as we continue to improve the library.</p>

<p dir="auto">To get a sense of what TinyTroupe can do, here are some examples of its use. These examples are available in the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/TinyTroupe/blob/main/examples">examples/</a> folder, and you can either inspect the pre-compiled Jupyter notebooks or run them yourself locally. Notice the interactive nature of TinyTroupe experiments -- just like you use Jupyter notebooks to interact with data, you can use TinyTroupe to interact with simulated people and environments, for the purpose of gaining insights.</p>
<div dir="auto"><p dir="auto">Note</p><p dir="auto">Currently, simulation outputs are better visualized against dark backgrounds, so we recommend using a dark theme in your Jupyter notebook client.</p>

<p dir="auto">Let's begin with a simple customer interview scenario, where a business consultant approaches a banker:</p>

</p>
<p dir="auto">The conversation can go on for a few steps to dig deeper and deeper until the consultant is satisfied with the information gathered, for instance a concrete project idea:</p>

</p>
<p dir="auto">Now, instead of having to carefully read what the agents said, we can extract the choice of each agent and compute the overall preference in an automated manner:</p>

</p>
<p dir="auto">After running a simulation, we can extract the results in a machine-readable manner, to reuse elsewhere (e.g., a report generator); here's what we get for the above brainstorming session:</p>

<p dir="auto">To run the library, you need:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Python 3.10 or higher. We'll assume you are using <a href="https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/" rel="nofollow">Anaconda</a>, but you can use other Python distributions.</li>
<li>Access to Azure OpenAI Service or Open AI GPT-4 APIs. You can get access to the Azure OpenAI Service <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/openai-service" rel="nofollow">here</a>, and to the OpenAI API <a href="https://platform.openai.com/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.
<ul dir="auto">
<li>For Azure OpenAI Service, you will need to set the <code>AZURE_OPENAI_KEY</code> and <code>AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT</code> environment variables to your API key and endpoint, respectively.</li>
<li>For OpenAI, you will need to set the <code>OPENAI_API_KEY</code> environment variable to your API key.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>By default, TinyTroupe <code>config.ini</code> is set to use some specific API, model and related parameters. You can customize these values by including your own <code>config.ini</code> file in the same folder as the program or notebook you are running. An example of a <code>config.ini</code> file is provided in the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/TinyTroupe/blob/main/examples">examples/</a> folder.</li>
</ul>
<div dir="auto"><p dir="auto">Important</p><p dir="auto"><strong>Content Filters</strong>: To ensure no harmful content is generated during simulations, it is strongly recommended to use content filters whenever available at the API level. In particular, <strong>if using Azure OpenAI, there's extensive support for content moderation, and we urge you to use it.</strong> For details about how to do so, please consult <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/content-filter" rel="nofollow">the corresponding Azure OpenAI documentation</a>. If content filters are in place, and an API call is rejected by them, the library will raise an exception, as it will be unable to proceed with the simulation at that point.</p>
</div>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Installation</h2><a id="user-content-installation" aria-label="Permalink: Installation" href="#installation"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Currently, the officially recommended way to install the library is directly from this repository, not PyPI.</strong> You can follow these steps:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">If Conda is not installed, you can get it from <a href="https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/" rel="nofollow">here</a>. You can also use other Python distributions, but we'll assume Conda here for simplicity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Create a new Python environment:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="conda create -n tinytroupe python=3.10"><pre>conda create -n tinytroupe python=3.10</pre></div>

<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="conda activate tinytroupe"><pre>conda activate tinytroupe</pre></div>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Make sure you have eihter Azure OpenAI or OpenAI API keys set as environment variables, as described in the <a href="#pre-requisites">Pre-requisites</a> section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Clone the repository, as we'll perform a local install (we <strong>will not install from PyPI</strong>):</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="git clone https://github.com/microsoft/tinytroupe

</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Install the library <strong>from this repository, not PyPI</strong>:</p>

</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">You can now run the examples in the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/TinyTroupe/blob/main/examples">examples/</a> folder or use TinyTroupe to create your simulations 🥳. If you want to run the examples in the
<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/TinyTroupe/blob/main/examples">examples/</a> folder or modify TinyTroupe itself, however, you should clone the repository as described below.</p>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Principles</h2><a id="user-content-principles" aria-label="Permalink: Principles" href="#principles"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Recently, we have seen LLMs used to simulate people (such as <a href="https://github.com/joonspk-research/generative_agents">this</a>), but largely in a “game-like” setting for contemplative or entertainment purposes. There are also libraries for building multiagent systems for proble-solving and assitive AI, like <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/" rel="nofollow">Autogen</a> and <a href="https://docs.crewai.com/" rel="nofollow">Crew AI</a>. What if we combine these ideas and simulate people to support productivity tasks? TinyTroupe is our attempt. To do so, it follows these principles:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li><strong>Programmatic</strong>: agents and environments are defined programmatically (in Python and JSON), allowing very flexible uses. They can also thus underpin other software apps!</li>
<li><strong>Analytical</strong>: meant to improve our understanding of people, users and society. Unlike entertainment applications, this is one aspect that is critical for business and productivity use cases. This is also why we recommend using Jupyter notebooks for simulations, just like one uses them for data analysis.</li>
<li><strong>Persona-based</strong>: agents are meant to be archetypical representation of people; for greater realism and control, detailed specification of such personas is encouraged: age, occupation, skills, tastes, opinions, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Multiagent</strong>: allows multiagent interaction under well-defined environmental constraints.</li>
<li><strong>Utilities-heavy</strong>: provides many mechanisms to facilitate specifications, simulations, extractions, reports, validations, etc. This is one area in which dealing with <em>simulations</em> differs significantly from <em>assistance</em> tools.</li>
<li><strong>Experiment-oriented</strong>: simulations are defined, run, analyzed and refined by an <em>experimenter</em> iteratively; suitable experimentation tools are thus provided. <em>See one of our <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/the-case-for-experiment-oriented-computing/" rel="nofollow">previous paper</a> for more on this.</em></li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">Together, these are meant to make TinyTroupe a powerful and flexible <strong>imagination enhancement tool</strong> for business and productivity scenarios.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Assistants vs. Simulators</h3><a id="user-content-assistants-vs-simulators" aria-label="Permalink: Assistants vs. Simulators" href="#assistants-vs-simulators"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">One common source of confusion is to think all such AI agents are meant for assiting humans. How narrow, fellow homosapiens! Have you not considered that perhaps we can simulate artificial people to understand real people? Truly, this is our aim here -- TinyTroup is meant to simulate and help understand people! To further clarify this point, consider the following differences:</p>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Project Structure</h2><a id="user-content-project-structure" aria-label="Permalink: Project Structure" href="#project-structure"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The project is structured as follows:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>/tinytroupe</code>: contains the Python library itself. In particular:
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>/tinytroupe/prompts</code>  contains the prompts used to call the LLMs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>/tests</code>: contains the unit tests for the library. You can use the <code>test.bat</code> script to run these.</li>
<li><code>/examples</code>: contains examples that show how to use the library, mainly using Jupyter notebooks (for greater readability), but also as pure Python scripts.</li>
<li><code>/data</code>: any data used by the examples or the library.</li>
<li><code>/docs</code>: documentation for the project.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Using the Library</h2><a id="user-content-using-the-library" aria-label="Permalink: Using the Library" href="#using-the-library"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">As any multiagent system, TinyTroupe provides two key abstractions:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>TinyPerson</code>, the <em>agents</em> that have personality, receive stimuli and act upon them.</li>
<li><code>TinyWorld</code>, the <em>environment</em> in which the agents exist and interact.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Various parameters can also be customized in the <code>config.ini</code> file, notably the API type (Azure OpenAI Service or OpenAI API), the model parameters, and the logging level.</p>
<p dir="auto">Let's see some examples of how to use these and also learn about other mechanisms available in the library.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">TinyPerson</h3><a id="user-content-tinyperson" aria-label="Permalink: TinyPerson" href="#tinyperson"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">A <code>TinyPerson</code> is a simulated person with specific personality traits, interests, and goals. As each such simulated agent progresses through its life, it receives stimuli from the environment and acts upon them. The stimuli are received through the <code>listen</code>, <code>see</code> and other similar methods, and the actions are performed through the <code>act</code> method. Convenience methods like <code>listen_and_act</code> are also provided.</p>
<p dir="auto">Each such agent contains a lot of unique details, which is the source of its realistic behavior. This, however, means that it takes significant effort to specify an agent manually. Hence, for convenience, <code>TinyTroupe</code> provide some easier ways to get started or generate new agents.</p>
<p dir="auto">To begin with, <code>tinytroupe.examples</code> contains some pre-defined agent builders that you can use. For example, <code>tinytroupe.examples.create_lisa_the_data_scientist</code> creates a <code>TinyPerson</code> that represents a data scientist called Lisa. You can use it as follows:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="from tinytroupe.examples import create_lisa_the_data_scientist

lisa = create_lisa_the_data_scientist() # instantiate a Lisa from the example builder
lisa.listen_and_act(&quot;Tell me about your life.&quot;)"><pre><span>from</span> <span>tinytroupe</span>.<span>examples</span> <span>import</span> <span>create_lisa_the_data_scientist</span>

<span>lisa</span> <span>=</span> <span>create_lisa_the_data_scientist</span>() <span># instantiate a Lisa from the example builder</span>
<span>lisa</span>.<span>listen_and_act</span>(<span>"Tell me about your life."</span>)</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">To see how to define your own agents from scratch, you can check Lisa's source, which contains elements like these:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="lisa = TinyPerson(&quot;Lisa&quot;)

           &gt; new technologies, and sustainable practices. In my free time, I enjoy traveling to
           &gt; exotic places, playing the guitar, and reading science fiction books. How about you?

<p dir="auto"><code>TinyWorld</code> enforces very little constraints on the possible interactions. Subclasses, however, are supposed to provide more strucutred environments.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Utilities</h3><a id="user-content-utilities" aria-label="Permalink: Utilities" href="#utilities"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">TinyTroupe provides a number of utilities and conveniences to help you create simulations and derive value from them. These include:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>TinyPersonFactory</code>: helps you generate new <code>TinyPerson</code>s using LLMs.</li>
<li><code>TinyTool</code>: simulated tools that can be used by <code>TinyPerson</code>s.</li>
<li><code>TinyStory</code>: helps you create and manage the story told through simulations.</li>
<li><code>TinyPersonValidator</code>: helps you validate the behavior of your <code>TinyPerson</code>s.</li>
<li><code>ResultsExtractor</code> and <code>ResultsReducer</code>: extract and reduce the results of interactions between agents.</li>
<li>... and more ...</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">In general, elements that represent simulated entities or complementary mechanisms are prefixed with <code>Tiny</code>, while those that are more infrastructural are not. This is to emphasize the simulated nature of the elements that are part of the simulation itself.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Caching</h3><a id="user-content-caching" aria-label="Permalink: Caching" href="#caching"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Calling LLM APIs can be expensive, thus caching strategies are important to help reduce that cost.
TinyTroupe comes with two such mechanisms: one for the simulation state, another for the LLM calls themselves.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Caching Simulation State</h4><a id="user-content-caching-simulation-state" aria-label="Permalink: Caching Simulation State" href="#caching-simulation-state"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Imagine you have a scenario with 10 different steps, you've worked hard in 9 steps, and now you are
just tweaking the 10th step. To properly validate your modifications, you need to rerun the whole
simulation of course. However, what's the point in re-executing the first 9, and incur the LLM cost, when you are
already satisified with them and did not modify them? For situations like this, the module <code>tinytroupe.control</code>
provide useful simulation management methods:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>control.begin("&lt;CACHE_FILE_NAME&gt;.cache.json")</code>: begins recording the state changes of a simulation, to be saved to
the specified file on disk.</li>
<li><code>control.checkpoint()</code>: saves the simulation state at this point.</li>
<li><code>control.end()</code>: terminates the simulation recording scope that had be started by <code>control.begin()</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Caching LLM API Calls</h4><a id="user-content-caching-llm-api-calls" aria-label="Permalink: Caching LLM API Calls" href="#caching-llm-api-calls"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">This is enabled preferably in the <code>config.ini</code> file, and alternativelly via the <code>openai_utils.force_api_cache()</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">LLM API caching, when enabled, works at a lower and simpler level than simulation state caching. Here,
what happens is a very straightforward: every LLM call is kept in a map from the input to the generated output;
when a new call comes and is identical to a previous one, the cached value is returned.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Config.ini</h3><a id="user-content-configini" aria-label="Permalink: Config.ini" href="#configini"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The <code>config.ini</code> file contains various parameters that can be used to customize the behavior of the library, such as model parameters and logging level. Please pay special attention to <code>API_TYPE</code> parameter, which defines whether you are using the Azure OpenAI Service or the OpenAI API. We provide an example of a <code>config.ini</code> file, <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/TinyTroupe/blob/main/examples/config.ini">./examples/config.ini</a>, which you can use as a template for your own, or just modify to run the examples.</p>

<p dir="auto">We need all sorts of things, but we are looking mainly for new interesting use cases demonstrations, or even just domain-specific application ideas. If you are a domain expert in some area that could benefit from TinyTroupe, we'd love to hear from you.</p>
<p dir="auto">Beyond that, many other aspects can be improved, such as:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Memory mechanisms.</li>
<li>Data grounding mechanisms.</li>
<li>Reasoning mechanisms.</li>
<li>New environment types.</li>
<li>Interfacing with the external world.</li>
<li>... and more ...</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Please note that anything that you contribute might be released as open-source (under MIT license).</p>
<p dir="auto">If you would like to make a contribution, please try to follow these general guidelines:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Tiny naming convention</strong>: If you are implementing a experimenter-facing simulated element (e.g., an agent or environment type) or closely related (e.g., agent factories, or content enrichers), and it sounds good, call your new <em>XYZ</em> as <em>TinyXYZ</em> :-) On the other hand, auxiliary and infrastructural mechanisms should not start with the "Tiny" prefix. The idea is to emphasize the simulated nature of the elements that are part of the simulation itself.</li>
<li><strong>Tests:</strong> If you are writing some new mechanism, please also create at least a unit test <code>tests/unit/</code>, and if you can a functional scenario test (<code>tests/scenarios/</code>).</li>
<li><strong>Demonstrations:</strong> If you'd like to demonstrate a new scenario, please design it preferably as a new Jupyter notebook within <code>examples/</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Microsoft:</strong> If you are implementing anything that is Microsoft-specific and non-confidential, please put it under a <code>.../microsoft/</code> folder.</li>
</ul>
