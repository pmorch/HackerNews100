Many believe it’s filled with unnecessary features that are difficult to disable. </p> <p>According to a recent test by YouTuber TrigzZolt, Windows 11 might actually be the slowest version of Windows released in the past 25 years — yes, even slower than the often-criticized Windows Vista.</p> <h2>A Slow Experience Despite Promises</h2> <figure><p> <iframe loading="lazy" title="Windows XP vs Vista vs 7 vs 8.1 vs 10 vs 11 | Speed Test" width="780" height="439" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/7VZJO-hOT4c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p><a href="https://www.eteknix.com/category/microsoft">Microsoft</a> promotes Windows 11 as its fastest operating system ever, but real-world tests tell a different story. In a detailed comparison, TrigzZolt benchmarked several Windows versions: XP, Vista, 7, 8.1, 10, and 11. The results showed that the newest version, Windows 11, performed the worst overall.</p> <p>The tests covered system boot time, laptop battery performance, application launch speed, memory management, and video editing capabilities. The benchmarks were run on a <a href="https://www.eteknix.com/category/lenovo">Lenovo</a> ThinkPad X220 — a model not officially compatible with Windows 11 — which could have affected some results. However, since the incompatibility mainly relates to hardware security rather than performance, the impact was likely minor.</p> <p>Among all the tested systems, Windows 11 was the slowest to start up, took the longest to open simple applications like Paint and File Explorer, and performed poorly when handling video editing in OpenShot. It also showed the highest <a href="https://www.eteknix.com/category/ram">RAM</a> usage when idle. Even without active applications, Windows 11 consumes significantly more memory due to its many background services and always-on features. Recently added AI functions have also contributed to slowing it down.</p> <p>The only areas where Windows 11 performed better were file transfer speed and storage space management for system applications. Overall, the conclusion was clear — Microsoft needs to lighten Windows 11, instead of filling it with more and more features that few users actually use.</p>  </div>     </article>  <div id="read-next-block"> <h2>Read Next</h2> <div id="tie-read-next"> <ul></ul> <div> <div> <p><span>1 hour ago</span></p> <h3>SanDisk Will Double the Price of Its Enterprise SSDs in 2026</h3> </div> <div> <p><span>1 hour ago</span></p> <h3>Epic Games Store Users Have Grown by 173% in Six Years, But Revenue Only by 1.6%</h3> </div> <div> <p><span>1 hour ago</span></p> <h3>Forza Horizon 5 Sells Over Five Million Copies on PS5</h3> </div> <div> <p><span>2 hours ago</span></p> <h3>Nintendo Switch Is About to Become the Second Best-Selling Console of All Time</h3> </div> <div> <p><span>8 hours ago</span></p> <h3>Steam Machine Appears on European Retail Listings Starting at $950</h3> </div> <div> <p><span>11 hours ago</span></p> <h3>DLSS 4.5 Boosts Visuals But Hurts Performance on RTX 30 and 20 GPUs</h3> </div> <div> <p><span>11 hours ago</span></p> <h3>Larian Studios Comments on Baldur’s Gate 3 Coming to Nintendo Switch 2</h3> </div> <div> <p><span>23 hours ago</span></p> <h3>Dawn of War Returns to Its Roots</h3> </div> <div> <p><span>23 hours ago</span></p> <h3>Gigabyte Breaks Records with World-First CQDIMM Technology</h3> </div> <div> <p><span>1 day ago</span></p> <h3>Intel Unveils Panther Lake for Handheld Gaming, Calls AMD Chips “Ancient Silicon”</h3> </div> <div> <p><span>1 day ago</span></p> <h3>Report: NVIDIA Delays RTX 50 SUPER Series Indefinitely Amid GDDR7 Memory Shortage</h3> </div> <div> <p><span>1 day ago</span></p> <h3>FromSoftware Acknowledges Online Issues in Elden Ring and Dark Souls on PC, Promises a Fix Soon</h3> </div> <div> <p><span>1 day ago</span></p> <h3>No Generative AI Will Be Used in the Development of Divinity, Larian Confirms</h3> </div> <div> <p><span>1 day ago</span></p> <h3>TSMC Beats Market Expectations with 20% Revenue Growth in Q4 2025, Driven by AI</h3> </div> <div> <p><span>1 day ago</span></p> <h3>Manor Lords Publisher Calls AI a “Cancer” and Refuses to Use It in His Games</h3> </div> <div> <p><span>1 day ago</span></p> <h3>Avowed Officially Coming to PlayStation 5, Release Date Confirmed</h3> </div> <div> <p><span>1 day ago</span></p> <h3>Sony Reveal Hyperpop DualSense Conntrollers and Console Covers</h3> </div> <div> <p><span>1 day ago</span></p> <h3>ASRock NUC Ultra 300 BOX Series Revealed</h3> </div> <div> <p><span>2 days ago</span></p> <h3>Detroit: Become Human Surpasses Another Major Sales Milestone</h3> </div> <div> <p><span>2 days ago</span></p> <h3>The PS2 Processor Once Raised Military Concerns, Says Final Fantasy IX Developer</h3> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Greetings from the year of Linux on my desktop.</p><p>In November, I got fed up and said <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/823337/switching-linux-gaming-desktop-cachyos">screw it, I’m installing Linux</a>. Since that article was published, I have dealt with one minor catastrophe after another. None of that has anything to do with Linux, mind you. It just meant I didn’t install it on my desktop until Sunday evening.</p><p>My goal here is to see how far I can get using Linux as my main OS <em>without</em> spending a ton of time futzing with it — or even much time researching beforehand. I am not looking for more high-maintenance hobbies at this stage. I want to see if Linux is a wingable alternative to Microsoft’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/821948/microsoft-windows-11-ai-agents-taskbar-integration">increasingly annoying OS</a>.</p><p>Honestly? So far it’s been fine. Many things I expected to be difficult — like getting my Nvidia graphics card working properly — were perfectly straightforward. A few things I thought would be simple weren’t. And I’ve run into one very funny issue with a gaming mouse that <em>only</em> works in games. But I’ve been able to use my Linux setup for work this week, I played exactly one video game, and I even printed something from my accursed printer.</p><div><p id="day-one"><h2>Day one</h2></p></div><div><p><a href="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/itworked.png?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0,0,100,100" data-pswp-height="1440" data-pswp-width="2560" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><img alt="Cachy splash screen showing the Hello window and a terminal" data-chromatic="ignore" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" sizes="(max-width: 639px) 100vw, (max-width: 1023px) 50vw, 700px" srcset="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/itworked.png?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=256 256w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/itworked.png?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=376 376w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/itworked.png?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=384 384w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/itworked.png?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=415 415w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/itworked.png?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=480 480w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/itworked.png?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=540 540w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/itworked.png?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=640 640w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/itworked.png?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=750 750w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/itworked.png?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=828 828w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/itworked.png?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=1080 1080w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/itworked.png?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=1200 1200w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/itworked.png?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=1440 1440w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/itworked.png?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=1920 1920w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/itworked.png?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=2048 2048w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/itworked.png?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=2400 2400w" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/itworked.png?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=2400"></a></p></div><p>I picked <a href="https://cachyos.org/">CachyOS</a> rather than a better-known distro like Ubuntu because it’s optimized for modern hardware, and I had heard that it’s easy to install and set up for gaming, which is one of the reasons I’d stuck with Windows for this long. After backing up my Windows image sometime in December (close enough), I follow the <a href="https://wiki.cachyos.org/installation/installation_on_root/">installation instructions in the Cachy wiki</a> and download the <a href="https://cachyos.org/">CachyOS</a> live image to a <a href="https://www.ventoy.net/en/index.html">Ventoy</a> USB drive, plug it into my PC, reboot into the BIOS to disable Secure Boot, reboot again into the Ventoy bootloader, and launch the CachyOS disk image.</p><p>First challenge: My mouse buttons don’t work. I can move the cursor, but can’t click on anything. I try plugging in a mouse (without unplugging the first one), same deal. Not a major issue; I can get around fine with just the keyboard. Maybe this is just an issue with the live image.</p><p>I launch the installer and am thrust into analysis paralysis. An operating system needs lots of little pieces to work — stuff you don’t even think of as individual components if you use Mac or Windows. How do you boot into the OS? What runs the desktop environment? How are windows drawn? What’s the file system? Where do you get software updates? In Mac and Windows, all those decisions are made for you. But Linux is fundamentally different: The core of the OS is the kernel, and everything else is kind of up to you. A distro is just somebody’s idea of what pieces to use. Some, like <a href="https://system76.com/pop/?srsltid=AfmBOoqaheiCcxLI9c_91oVN7uwiR6EIckpvCR9HWEN3781ua9N_u3E3">Pop_OS!</a> and <a href="https://linuxmint.com/">Mint</a>, aim for simplicity and make all those choices for you (though you can still change them if you want). But Cachy is based on <a href="https://archlinux.org/">Arch</a>, a notoriously DIY distro, and before I do anything else, I have to pick one of four bootloaders. I pick Limine, for reasons I can’t recall.</p><p>Next, I need to figure out where to install it. On the recommendation of Will Smith from the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2888221/check-out-pcworlds-new-linux-podcast.html"><em>Dual Boot Diaries</em> podcast</a> — from whom the “an operating system is a bunch of pieces” thing above is largely cribbed — I install Cachy on a different physical drive from Windows, since Windows updates tend not to care if they overwrite other bootloaders.</p><div><p><a href="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/partition.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0,0,100,100" data-pswp-height="1707" data-pswp-width="2560" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><img alt="photo of a computer screen (SORRY) with a disk partition manager running.

The guide says it needs at least 20GB, so I go big and make it 100GB. This will cause a minor problem later.</p><p>Next, I have to pick <a href="https://wiki.cachyos.org/installation/desktop_environments/">one of <em>thirteen</em> different desktop environments</a>. This is too many options. KDE and Gnome seem to be the best-supported for gaming, so I pick KDE.

Cachy automatically installed the correct GPU drivers; my monitor, speakers, and Logitech webcam work fine with no effort. Even my printer prints, with only a tweak to my firewall settings.</p><p>There are lots of ways to install apps on Linux. Sometimes you can just download them from a company’s website, or you get them from your distro’s official repositories, or GitHub, or wherever. There’s no official app store for Linux, but there are at least three projects aiming to provide universal Linux apps: Flatpak, AppImage, and Snap. Neat! Commence hodgepodging.</p><p>I grab Chromium, Discord, Slack, and Audacity using the “Install Apps” button on Cachy’s welcome screen. Slack I get from the Arch User Repository. Twenty minutes later, I try to install 1Password from the same location, but the repository is down. I pick up my kid from a playdate and try again. It works.</p><div><p id="whats-missing"><h2><strong>What’s missing</strong></h2></p></div><p>I prefer the Arc browser, which doesn’t have a Linux build, but there are plenty of browsers.

I figure I ought to try <em>one</em> game. Then I remember that my root partition is only 100GB. I reboot back into the Cachy live image and use the Parted utility to increase it to 1TB, then make a second btrfs partition in the remaining space. I reboot, log into Epic and GOG, and start downloading <em>The Outer Worlds</em>, a game from 2019 I’ve been playing a bit lately. It runs fine with Proton, and I can even sync my saves from the cloud. I play it for a few minutes with my trackball, remember I hate gaming on a trackball, and plug my gaming mouse back in. It works fine as long as I’m in the game, but outside the game, mouse clicks stop working again. It makes sense — the bug is on the desktop, not in games — but it’s very funny to have a gaming mouse that <em>only</em> works for gaming.</p><div><p

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p><span>ANALYSIS</span> From May's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/05/19/legal_aid_agency_data_theft/">cyberattack on the Legal Aid Agency</a> to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/12/19/uk_foreign_office_hack/">Foreign Office breach</a> months later, cyber incidents have become increasingly common in UK government.</p>
<p>The scale extends far beyond these high-profile cases: the NCSC reports that 40 percent of attacks it managed between September 2020 and August 2021 targeted the public sector, a figure expected to grow.</p>
<p>Given this threat landscape, why does the UK's flagship Cyber Security and Resilience (CSR) Bill exclude both central and local government?</p>

    

<p>Sir Oliver Dowden, former digital secretary and current shadow deputy PM, led calls in the House of Commons this week urging Labour to rethink its stance on excluding central government from the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/11/12/uk_cyber_security_and_resilience/">Cyber Security and Resilience (CSR) Bill</a>.</p>

        


        

<p>"I would just urge the minister, as this bill passes through Parliament, to look again at that point, and I think there is a case for putting more stringent requirements on the public sector in order to force ministers' minds on that point."</p>
<p>The CSR bill was announced days into Sir Keir Starmer's tenure as Prime Minister, aiming to provide an essential refresh of the country's heavily outdated NIS 2018 regulations.</p>

        

<p>It proposed to bring managed service providers into scope, as was scheduled in 2022 before those plans fell by the wayside, and datacenters, among many other aspects.</p>
<p>Parallels can be drawn with the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/10/24/nis2_compliance_checklist/">EU's NIS2</a>. However, the CSR bill's scope is narrower, excluding public authorities, unlike the EU's equivalent regulatory refresh.</p>
<p>Ian Murray, minister of state across two government departments and responsible, in part, for data policy and public sector reform, thanked Dowden for his suggestions and promised to take them on board.</p>

        

<p>In responding to the shadow deputy PM, Murray also pointed to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/06/government_cyber_action_plan/">Government Cyber Action Plan</a>, which it launched hours before the CSR bill was set for a second reading in the Commons.</p>
<p>This plan will ostensibly hold government departments to equal security standards as the CSR bill... just without any of the legal obligations.</p>
<p>Cynics may see it as a tool to quell any criticisms of the bill's scope not extending to central government, all without making any hard security commitments.</p>
<p>As Dowden noted in the Commons on Tuesday, cybersecurity is a matter that is often deprioritized quickly in government. "I welcome the minister's comments about the obligation on the public sector. However, I would caution him that, in my experience, cybersecurity is one of those things that ministers talk about but then other priorities overtake it. And the advantage of legislative requirements is that it forces ministers to think about it."</p>
<p>"I do think that more pressure needs to be brought to bear on ministers in terms of their accountability for cybersecurity. I fear that if we don't put this into primary legislation, it's something that can slip further and further down ministers' in-trays. Whilst [some] ministers may have a desire to address it, other, more pressing, immediate problems distract their attention."</p>
<p>One could argue that if the government is serious about holding itself to the same standards as the critical service providers in scope of the CSR bill, it would just bring itself and local authorities also into scope.</p>
<p>Neil Brown, director at British law firm decoded.legal, told <em>The Register</em>: "The argument is that government departments will be held to standards equivalent to those set out in the bill, and so do not need to be included. This does not fill me with confidence.</p>
<p>"If the government is going to hold itself to standards equivalent to those set out in the bill, then it has nothing to fear from being included in the bill since, by definition, it will be compliant."</p>
<p>Labour MP Matt Western, who also chairs the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/29/submarine_cable_security_report_uk/">National Security Strategy joint committee</a>, suggested that the CSR bill would not be a cure-all, but the first of many pieces of bespoke legislation the government will pass to improve national security.</p>
<p>This suggests the government is considering specific legislation to shore up public sector security further down the line. Perhaps this is wishful thinking.</p>

</ul>
<p>Brown told us "separate legislation does not sound like a terrible idea," and notes that existing UK telecoms law is separated for effect.</p>
<p>The Telecommunications (Security) Act 2021 and the Product Security and Telecommunications Infrastructure Act 2022, for example, both seek to improve security in the telco space, but target different organizations. Security requirements often differ between types of organization, so potentially reserving a public sector-specific cybersecurity bill could be the way to go.</p>
<p>Ministers' plans also include a provision in the bill to introduce new legislative amendments as needed, to meet the demands of a rapidly shifting cybersecurity landscape, leaving behind the Brexit-related hindrances that delayed the previous NIS updates in the first place.</p>
<p>However, the likelihood of being able to deliver on effective legislative amendments at pace is uncertain.</p>
<p>Arguably, if the government wanted to do it correctly, it would carry out a comprehensive (and lengthy) industry consultation before pushing any amendments through the two Houses, another typically arduous process.</p>
<p>Whether this way of iterating on existing law could balance speed with comprehensiveness in unanswered.</p>
<p>For Brown, the approach taken by Labour – to legislate in smaller steps – seems like the smarter choice.</p>
<p>"My preference is to legislate little and often, iterating as needed, rather than trying to create one piece of legislation which is all things to all people," he says. "Legislation inevitably entails compromise, and often reflects the divergent interests of numerous interested parties (including lobbying groups) – I look, for instance, at the Online Safety Act 2023. Smaller bills/acts, more targeted in scope, responding to a clearly-articulated problem statement, seems more sensible to me.</p>
<p>"As to whether the CSR would result in a better outcome than NIS2, I'm afraid I do not know."</p>
<p>Given the scale of the cyber threat facing the UK's public sector, failing to account for this in the CSR bill could open the government up to intense scrutiny.</p>
<p>The National Audit Office's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/01/29/nao_blasts_uk_gov_cyber/">report</a> into UK government security improvements in January 2025 laid bare the sorry state of its systems. Of the 72 most critical systems run by various departments, 58 were reviewed; auditors found a litany of security flaws across them and noted a staggeringly slow pace at which the issues were being addressed.</p>
<p>That is not an assessment which goes hand-in-hand with a public sector free from regular cyberattacks.</p>
<p>Each time a central authority, arm's-length body, local council, or NHS trust is compromised, the government's decision not to include the public sector within the scope of the CSR bill hands the opposition another opportunity to question its commitment to cybersecurity.</p>
<p>Labour does, at least, have some ammo to fire back if this scenario were to ever become reality, with the Conservatives having failed to enact the cybersecurity recommendations from its <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/05/30/uk_government_security_consultation/">2022 consultation</a>, despite having had more than two years to do so.</p>
<p>Even with the government's Cyber Action Plan, its reluctance to bring the public sector into the scope of its flagship cyber legislation fails to inspire any confidence that it has serious ambitions to improve security in this problem area. ®</p>

</ul>

<p>We discovered that entire sections describing domestic U.S. intelligence facilities were deliberately removed from two published documents, while equivalent foreign facilities remained visible. The evidence exists in an unexpected place - the PDF metadata of documents published by The Intercept in 2016, and by The Intercept and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation in a 2017 collaborative investigation. To our knowledge, this is the first time this information has been revealed publicly. The removed sections reveal the operational designations and cover name structure for domestic U.S. NRO Mission Ground Stations.</p>
<p>Using PDF analysis tools, we found hidden text embedded in the metadata versioning of two documents published alongside investigative stories about NSA satellite surveillance facilities. These metadata artifacts prove that earlier versions of the documents contained detailed descriptions of domestic U.S. ground stations that were systematically scrubbed before publication (not just redacted with black boxes, but with text completely removed).</p><p><strong>What was published from the Snowden documents:</strong></p><ul>

</ul>
<p>The facilities themselves are not unknown. "Aerospace Data Facility" at Buckley Space Force Base is publicly acknowledged as a National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) Mission Ground Station. "Classic Wizard Reporting and Testing Center" at Naval Research Laboratory is publicly acknowledged, though its designation as a Mission Ground Station is less clear. What's NOT public (until now) is the specific operational designations used in classified networks: "Consolidated Denver Mission Ground Station (CDMGS)" and "Potomac Mission Ground Station (PMGS)." The Snowden documents prove these are deliberate cover names (not just alternative terminology) and show exactly what's classified and what's not.</p>

    fied.</pre>
<h2>Potomac Mission Ground Station (PMGS)</h2>
<p>In the "hidden version" of the document "Menwith satellite classification guide" section 5.1.5 describes a facility formally identified by its cover name "Mission Support Facility (MSF)," also referred to as the "Classic Wizard Reporting and Testing Center (CWRTC)." The classified operational designation is Potomac Mission Ground Station (PMGS).</p>
<p><strong>Location</strong>: Buildings 259 and 260, Naval Research Laboratory, Southwest Washington, DC.</p>
<p><strong>Public cover story</strong>: "Software development, maintenance, testing, and communications support to a world-wide Navy communications and reporting system."</p>
<p><strong>Actual function</strong>: Mission Ground Station in the National Reconnaissance Office's satellite intelligence network.</p>
<p>The document explicitly states that "the fact of a cover story is S//TK" - meaning even acknowledging that CWRTC is a cover name (rather than the facility's real identity) is classified Secret/Talent Keyhole.</p>
<p>The classification guide provides a detailed breakdown of what's public and what's secret:</p>
<ul>
  <li>"Classic Wizard Reporting and Testing Center (CWRTC)" = <strong>UNCLASSIFIED</strong></li>
  <li>"Potomac Mission Ground Station (PMGS)" = <strong>S//TK (SECRET)</strong></li>
  <li>The fact that CWRTC is a cover name for PMGS = <strong>S//TK (SECRET)</strong></li>
  <li>Association of NRO, CIA, or NSA personnel with CWRTC = <strong>S//TK (SECRET)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This layered classification allows the facility to operate under a public identity while keeping its actual intelligence designation and function secret.</p>
<h2>Consolidated Denver Mission Ground Station (CDMGS)</h2>
<p>In the "hidden version" of the document "NRO SIGINT Guide for Pine Gap" section 5.1.2 describes a facility identified by the cover name "Aerospace Data Facility (ADF)". The classified operational designation is "Consolidated Denver Mission Ground Station (CDMGS)."</p>
<p><strong>Location</strong>: Buckley Space Force Base, Aurora, Colorado</p>
<p><strong>Public acknowledgment</strong>: Publicly known as "Aerospace Data Facility-Colorado." For example ADF-C is openly described <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20251228020638/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace_Data_Facility-Colorado" target="_blank">in Wikipedia</a> as an NRO facility for "command and control of reconnaissance satellites."</p>
<p><strong>What's NOT public</strong>: The operational designation "Consolidated Denver Mission Ground Station" and the fact that "Aerospace Data Facility" is a cover name for it.</p>
<p>As with PMGS, the classification guide shows "the fact of a cover story is S//TK" - the deception itself is classified.</p>

<p>Both hidden facilities appear in an organizational classification table in the Pine Gap guide. The table's visual structure reveals which names refer to the same facilities through deliberate formatting. Thicker borders separate distinct facility groups, while thinner borders separate columns within each group (this might be a bit hard to see from the screenshot/document). Each facility appears multiple times - once under its classified operational designation, and again under its unclassified cover name(s):</p><p><img src="https://libroot.org/public/post-imgs/pinegap-table.png"></p><p>The groupings show:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Denver facility</strong>: CDMGS (real designation) + ADF (cover name) + <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260110053742/https://theintercept.com/snowden-sidtoday/3008265-mooney-award-for-2001/" rel="nofollow=" target="_blank">FSD</a> (Field Station Denver, cover name)</li>
  <li><strong>Potomac facility</strong>: PMGS (real designation) + MSF (cover name) + CWRTC (cover name)</li>
  <li><strong>Menwith Hill</strong>: HMGS (real designation) + RAF MHS (cover name)</li>
  <li><strong>Pine Gap</strong>: AMGS (real designation) + JDFPG (cover name)</li>
</ul>
<p>For each facility, the real operational designation (CDMGS, PMGS, HMGS, AMGS) has all agency associations classified S//TK (Secret). But the cover names have NSA and NGA associations marked as unclassified (U) or For Official Use Only (U//FOUO).</p>
<p>This creates a classification system where you can publicly acknowledge intelligence work using sanitized facility names, while the actual operational designations remain secret.</p>
<p>The domestic facilities use two cover names each (ADF + FSD for Denver; MSF + CWRTC for Potomac), while foreign facilities use only one. This suggests layered operational security for facilities on U.S. soil - possibly to navigate Congressional oversight, legal restrictions on domestic intelligence operations, or different audiences requiring different levels of plausible deniability.</p>

<p>There is a deliberate pattern in these two classification guides: detailed sections describing specific U.S. facilities were removed, while equivalent foreign facility sections were published intact. The 2016 Menwith Hill guide had its PMGS section (5.1.5) completely removed. The 2017 Pine Gap guide had its CDMGS section (5.1.2) completely removed. Both guides retained their detailed descriptions of foreign facilities, including operational designations, cover stories, and visitor protocols.</p>
<p>U.S. facilities weren't entirely absent from the published documents. The Pine Gap classification table shows CDMGS, PMGS, ADF, and other U.S. facility designations alongside foreign facilities, revealing the structure of the Mission Ground Station network. Other published documents from both investigations mention U.S. facilities. What was specifically removed were the detailed classification guide sections that would have explained these U.S. facilities the same way Menwith Hill and Pine Gap were explained.</p>
<h2>Who edited the documents?</h2>
<p>PDF metadata provides forensic evidence of the editing process. The Pine Gap classification guide shows timestamps from July 31, 2017, three weeks before publication. Two versions were created minutes apart using Nitro Pro 8, a commercial PDF editor: version 1 at 13:48:54 (containing the CDMGS section) and version 2 at 13:50:48 (with CDMGS removed). The Intercept and ABC published identical PDFs with the same metadata artifacts, indicating the editing was done once and the same file shared between organizations.</p>
<p>The Intercept, as holder of the Snowden archive, likely handled technical document preparation for publications. The Menwith Hill classification guide, published solely by The Intercept in 2016, shows more thorough metadata sanitization but the same editorial pattern - domestic facility sections removed while foreign equivalents remain.</p>
<p>We contacted Ryan Gallagher, the journalist who led both investigations, to ask about the editorial decision to remove these sections. After more than a week, we have not received a response.</p>

<p>The next part will be a technical deep-dive into PDF metadata across the published Snowden documents. We found that many documents contain multiple versions in their metadata, revealing the editorial redaction process: visible NSA agents' usernames that were later removed, screenshots that were later redacted, and surveillance data that went through multiple rounds of redaction. We'll also document cases of failed redactions - including one where redacted text remained fully copyable, previously reported only by a Polish cybersecurity blog.</p>

Disclaimer: this is a very nerdy blog entry. It is about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_markup_language">lightweight markup languages</a> and why I think that Org mode syntax is the best lightweight markup language for many use-cases. And with lightweight markup language, I do mean the syntax, the way you express headings, lists, font variations such as bold face or italic, and such things.

</p>

<p>

Disclaimer: I've written a very similar article on <a href="https://karl-voit.at/2025/08/17/Markdown-disaster">why Markdown is a bad idea in general</a>.

</p>

<p>

Please do note that <b>this is not about Emacs at all</b>. This is about Org mode syntax and its advantages even when used outside of Emacs. You can type Org mode syntax in <a href="http://www.vim.org/">vim</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Notepad">notepad.exe</a>, <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a>, <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a>, and all other text editors out there. And in my opinion it does have advantages compared to the other, common lightweight markup standards such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AsciiDoc">AsciiDoc</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki#Editing">Wikitext</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText">reStructuredText</a>.

</p>

<p>

Of course, Org mode syntax is my favorite syntax. Despite my personal choice you will see that I've got some pretty convincing arguments that underline my statement as well. So this is not just a matter of personal taste.

</p>

<p>

If you already have a grin on your face because you don't have any clue what this is all about: keep on reading. It makes an excellent example for making fun of nerds at your next dinner party. ;-)

</p>

	  <header><h2>Org Mode Syntax Is Intuitive, Easy to Learn and Remember</h2></header>

<p>

Here you are. This is almost anything you need to know about Org mode syntax:

</p>

	  <div>
	  <pre> * This Is A Heading
 ** This Is A Sub-Heading
 *** And A Sub-Sub-Heading

 Paragraphs are separated by at least one empty line.

 *bold* /italic/ _underlined_ +strikethrough+ =monospaced=
 [[http://Karl-Voit.at][Link description]]
 http://Karl-Voit.at → link without description

 - list item
 - another item
   - sub-item
     1. also enumerated
     2. if you like
 - [ ] yet to be done
 - [X] item which is done

 : Simple pre-formatted text such as for source code.
 : This also respects the line breaks. *bold* is not bold here.	  </pre>
    </div>

<p>

And yes, for the people with advanced syntax in mind, this is not everything. Just the basics. A common objection is that source code needs a begin and an end marker instead of a string prefix like <code>: </code> and Org mode syntax is providing this as well:

</p>

	  <div>
	  <pre> #+BEGIN_SRC python
 myresult = 42 * 23
 print('Hello Europe! ' + str(myresult))
 #+END_SRC	  </pre>
    </div>

<p>

I've seen many coworkers who typed Org mode markup when taking notes in their text editor. And they did not even know anything about it. So it is that intuitive I'd say.

</p>

<p>

While I was learning Org mode, I did not even use a cheat-sheet for the syntax as I normally do. It was very natural for me to type Org mode syntax right from the start.

</p>

<p>

Tables are a bit more complicated like in all other markup languages I know of:

</p>

	  <div>
	  <pre> | My Column 1 | My Column 2 | Last Column |
 |-------------+-------------+-------------|
 |          42 | foo         | bar         |
 |          23 | baz         | abcdefg     |
 |-------------+-------------+-------------|
 |          65 |             |             |	  </pre>
    </div>

<p>

You most probably won't type a table like this outside of Emacs. The manual alignment without tool-support is very tedious. But even here you are able to deliver a perfectly fine Org mode table by simply ignoring the alignment altogether:

</p>

	  <div>
	  <pre> | My Column 1|My Column 2 | Last Column |
 |-
 | 42 | foo | bar|
 | 23 | baz | abcdefg|
 |-
 | 65 |||	  </pre>
    </div>

	  <header><h2>Org Mode Syntax Is Standardized</h2></header>

<p>

This is an almost ridiculous argument because in my opinion a markup is of no use when it is not the same for tool A as for tool B.

</p>

<p>

However, there are markup languages that are different. For example the very widely used markup language named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a> has many flavors to choose from (list far from complete):

</p>
<ul>
<li>the original writeup and implementation by John Gruber</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown#Markdown_Extra">Markdown
Extra</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MultiMarkdown">MultiMarkdown</a></li>
<li><a href="http://github.com/">GitHub</a> Flavored Markdown</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown#CommonMark">CommonMark</a>
which tries to standardize the Markdown standard (again)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jgm/djot">Djot</a> (derived from
CommonMark)</li>
<li><a href="https://mystmd.org/">MyST</a> (superset of CommonMark)</li>
<li>by the time you read this, there probably will be even much
more!</li>
</ul>

<p>

<a href="https://pandoc.org/">Pandoc</a> lists six different Markdown flavors as output formats. This is an absolutely bad situation which foils the original idea behind lightweight markup languages. When some web service tells me that I can use "Markdown" for a text field, I have to dig deeper to find out which of those many different Markdown standards the web page is talking about. After this I will have to continue and look for a cheat-sheet of this dialect because nothing is more difficult to differentiate than multiple standards that are almost the same but not really the same. A usability hell. I get furious every time I have to enter this hell.

</p>

<p>

With Markdown, the original (inconsistently designed) syntax format is a minimal set that made much sense when used when typing emails and so forth. Later-on, various tools needed more syntax elements for obvious reasons. For example, tools wanted to have footnotes or tables. Those syntax add-ons extended the original Markdown. However, they were not standardized.

</p>

<p>

This resulted in a zoo of very similar but incompatible set of Markdown flavors. Those differences cause information loss by moving from one "Markdown" tool to another "Markdown" tool because Markdown is not Markdown in most cases.

</p>

<p>

In contrast to that, the syntax of Emacs Org-mode as the one and only original form has - by far - the largest set of syntax elements and various extensions by modules. Any other adaptation of this syntax in other tools chose a real sub-set of the original syntax elements. This makes data transitions much smoother, is less error-prone and causes less data loss.

</p>

<p>

As of 2025-02, there is no formal Org-mode syntax definition. However, as described in the upper paragraphs, the Org-mode syntax is more standardized than any of the Markdown standards with respect to Markdown in general. All Org-mode syntax elements are part of the Emacs Org-mode implementation and all derivatives are sub-sets of this set of syntax elements. This is quite the opposite with Markdown.

</p>

<p>

An additional notion (which is not related to the syntax itself) is the lack of standardization of file extensions using Markdown syntax. I've seen <code>.md</code>, <code>.mkdn</code>, <code>.markdown</code> and even <code>.txt</code> (in Markdown).

</p>

<p>

With Org mode syntax, life is easy. The snippet from the previous section explains all there is. Any tool that interprets Org mode syntax accepts this simple and easy to remember syntax. The file name extension is always <code>.org</code>.

</p>

	  <header><h2>Org Mode Syntax Is Consistent</h2></header>

	  <header><h3>Different Heading Approaches</h3></header>

<p>

Many lightweight markup languages do offer multiple ways of typing headings.

</p>

<p>

There are basically three ways of defining headings:

</p>
<ol>
<li>Prefix headings</li>
<li>Pre- and postfix headings</li>
<li>Underlined headings</li>
</ol>

<p>

Here are some examples for each category:

</p>

	  <div>
	  <pre> Prefix headings:

 # Heading 1
 ## Heading 2
 ### Heading 3

 Pre- and postfix headings:

 = Heading 1 =
 == Heading 2 ==
 === Heading 3 ===

 Underlined headings:

 Heading 1
 =========

 Heading 2
 ~~~~~~~~~

 Heading 3
 *********	  </pre>
    </div>

<p>

I prefer the prefix heading style. Org mode syntax use this as well with <code>*</code> as prefix characters. The more asterisks, the deeper the level of the heading is.

</p>

<p>

<b>Pre- and postfix headings</b> do offer bad usability. The user has manually synchronize the number of prefix character with the number of postfix characters. And it is totally unclear how something like <code>=<code> heading </code>==</code> with different numbers of pre/postfix characters is going to turn out when being interpreted.

</p>

<p>

And in case the user already used a markup language with simple prefix headings, it is not logical why there is the need for the postfix characters at all.

</p>

<p>

Even worse than this is the <b>underlined heading category</b>. The user is completely irritated for multiple reasons. Besides the tedious manual work to align the stupid heading characters with the heading title, it is not clear what characters must be used for those heading lines. If you've got a bigger document with different levels of headings you get confused which heading character stands for which heading level.

</p>

<p>

Are the tilde characters level one? Or was it the equals characters? And how about asterisks? Without a cheat-sheet, the occasional markup user is completely lost.

</p>

<p>

This gets even more worse: some markup languages let you choose your "order" of heading characters. This results in weird situations. For example one author is starting to write a reStructuredText document using her favorite heading syntax. A second author is joining in and has to analyze the document in order to know what heading syntax he must use.

</p>

	  <header><h3>reStructuredText</h3></header>

<p>

In the <a href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/emacs.html">reStructuredText mode of Emacs</a> you can find following function:

</p>

<blockquote>You can visualize the hierarchy of the section adornments in the
current buffer by invoking <code>rst-display-adornments-hierarchy</code>, bound
on <code>C-c C-a C-d</code>. A temporary buffer will appear with fake section
titles rendered in the style of the current document. This can be
useful when editing other people's documents to find out which section
adornments correspond to which levels.</blockquote>

<p>

Yes, you got it right, it is true: this function's only purpose is to generate a dummy-hierarchy of headings to visualize which markup has to be used for heading 1, which one for heading 2 and so forth just for this single document. What a bad design decision of the markup when you need such hacks just to know how a heading should look like in a markup even if you are familiar with in the first place.

</p>

<p>

Here is one more: some markup languages even allow <b>mixed heading styles</b>. You can use an underlined heading style for heading level 1, a prefix style for level 2, another underlining style for level 3 and so forth. Now the chaos is a perfect one.

</p>

	  <header><h3>AsciiDoc</h3></header>

<p>

I'm using <a href="https://powerman.name/doc/asciidoc">this cheatsheet</a> as reference for this section in AsciiDoc.

</p>

	  <div>
	  <pre> Level 1
 -------
 Text.

 Level 2
 ~~~~~~~
 Text.

 Level 3
 ^^^^^^^
 Text.

 Level 4
 +++++++
 Text.	  </pre>
    </div>

<p>

There is no good way of memorizing the characters used for the various levels of headings. Within the text, you can't see clearly which heading has a higher level.

</p>

<p>

Do you have to manually align the characters below the heading text? Does it work when the heading text has a different length than the following line?

</p>

	  <div>
	  <pre> == Level 1
 Text.

 === Level 2
 Text.

 ==== Level 3
 Text.

 ===== Level 4
 Text.	  </pre>
    </div>

<p>

Why are there two different options for the same very basic syntax element? What about mixing them? Does it work?

</p>

<p>

Why don't they start with one eual sign? Level one consists of two equal characters and so forth. Why this off-by-one mismatch?

</p>

	  <div>
	  <pre> * bullet
 * bullet
   - bullet
   - bullet
 * bullet
 ** bullet
 ** bullet
 *** bullet
 *** bullet
 **** bullet	  </pre>
    </div>

<p>

and

</p>

	  

<p>

Again: why two different ways of writing a simple list?

</p>

<p>

First list version: Why do I have to use multiple asterisks but just one dash?

</p>

	  <div>
	  <pre> a. letter
 b. letter
    .. letter2
    .. letter2
        .  number
        .  number
            1. number2
            2. number2
            3. number2
            4. number2
        .  number
    .. letter2
 c. letter	  </pre>
    </div>

<p>

One letter, two dots, one dot → any logic seems to be gone.

</p>

	  <div>
	  <pre> Term 1::
     Definition 1
 Term 2::
     Definition 2
     Term 2.1;;
         Definition 2.1
     Term 2.2;;
         Definition 2.2
 Term 3::
     Definition 3
 Term 4:: Definition 4
 Term 4.1::: Definition 4.1
 Term 4.2::: Definition 4.2
 Term 4.2.1:::: Definition 4.2.1
 Term 4.2.2:::: Definition 4.2.2
 Term 4.3::: Definition 4.3
 Term 5:: Definition 5	  </pre>
    </div>

<p>

Definition indented or not? The level after the definition text is hard to follow in the layout.

</p>

	  <div>
	  <pre> .Multiline cells, row/col span

    </div>

<p>

Please note that this has many table options that Org mode syntax does not provide such as multi-line cells. However, this comes with the price of a table syntax I would not be able to remember at least for occasional use.

</p>

	  <header><h3>Web Links and Simple Markup in Different Markup Languages</h3></header>

<p>

Let's have a look at a different markup element: <b>external links</b>. As you already remember in Org mode syntax, a link looks like this:

</p>

	  <div>
	  <pre> [[http://Karl-Voit.at][my home page]]	  </pre>
    </div>

<p>

The only difficult thing here is to remember that the URL is at the beginning and the description follows after the URL. Many markup languages do add additional and unnecessary levels of difficulties.

</p>

<p>

Here are some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_markup_language#Link_syntax">examples from Wikipedia</a> and comments by me where a user might be irritated.

</p>

<p>

AsciiDoc:

</p>

	  

<p>

The form is simple but for complex URLs, the <code>[Text]</code> might look like being part of the URL itself. Not beautiful but at least something I could live with.

<p>

Markdown:

</p>

	  <div>
	  <pre> [Text](http://example.com)
 [Text](http://example.com "Title")	  </pre>
    </div>

<p>

Brackets or parentheses first? Why using different kind of markup characters in the first place like only brackets? Is the <code>Title</code> part of the URL? Why not part of <code>Text</code>? Very confusing design decisions from my point of view.

</p>

<p>

reStructuredText:

</p>

	  <div>
	  <pre> `Text &lt;http://example.com/&gt;`_	  </pre>
    </div>

<p>

Holy moly. This is some weird stuff. First, you have to grave accents <code>`</code> and not apostrophes <code>'</code>. Then what about the underscore character at the end? This is as complicated as you can define a simple URL. I'd even prefer the hard to type HTML version of linking. A disaster for something which has "lightweight" in its class name.

</p>

<p>

Even with the most basic formatting syntax, Markdown (I assume in all flavors of it) shows a high level of inconsistency:

</p>

	  <div>
	  <pre> _italic_, **bold**, `monospace`, ~~strikethrough~~	  </pre>
    </div>

<p>

Why is it that italic and monospace require only one character before and after the string in-between and others require two? It's inconsistent and therefore hard to learn and error-prone.

</p>

<p>

Markdown has even different formatting for the very same thing:

</p>

	  <div>
	  <pre> This is **bold text**.
 This is __bold text__.
 Text**is**bold
 NOT allowed: Text__is__bold	  </pre>
    </div>

	  <div>
	  <pre> This is *italic*.
 This is _italic_.
 Text*is*italic
 NOT allowed: Text_is_italic	  </pre>
    </div>

	  <div>
	  <pre> Horizontal Rules with three or more asterisks (***),
 dashes (---), or underscores (___) on a line by themselves	  </pre>
    </div>

<p>

And now compare the Org syntax for the same formats:

</p>

	  <div>
	  <pre> /italic/, *bold*, ~monospace~, +strikethrough+
 three or more dashes on one line for horizontal rules	  </pre>
    </div>

<p>

Org made different choices for the syntax. In my opinion with better mnemonics but you could disagree here. However, with one leading and one trailing syntax character, it's for sure easier to learn, type and recognize due to better consistency.

</p>

	  <header><h2>Org Mode Syntax Can Be Easily Typed</h2></header>

<p>

The simple syntax of Org mode does not imply typing unnecessary characters. You don't have to manually align something like underlined headings. Anybody using a simple text editor is very fast at adding markup for headings, font variations, and so forth. The previous section proved that other markup languages clearly fail in many cases.

</p>

	  <header><h2>Org Mode Syntax Makes Sense Outside of Emacs</h2></header>

<p>

You don't have to use the Emacs editor to write and work with Org mode markup text. As I mentioned above, many people already do so just because Org mode syntax is an intuitive and clean way of typing text characters.

</p>

<p>

When you've got text information in Org mode markup, you can process it with many tools. Most prominent and most important examples are files pushed within a GitHub repository and the swiss army knife named <a href="https://pandoc.org/">Pandoc</a> which is able to convert Org mode syntax to dozens of formats like HTML, odt (LibreOffice), docx (Word), LaTeX, PDF, and so forth.

</p>

<p>

Many lightweight markups don't come with any decent tool support at all. When I'm using, e.g., markdown in any solution that doesn't do more than syntax highlighting, there is no real reason why this can not be written in Org mode syntax instead.

</p>

<p>

So, yes, Org mode syntax came with a perfect tool support in the first place. But my point is, that the syntax itself has that many advantages that is should be adapted for all the "tool-support is not the main focus"-applications as well.

<p>

You can write and render Org mode syntax in <a href="https://github.com/novoid/github-orgmode-tests">GitHub</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.com/pages/org-mode/blob/master/README.org">GitLab</a>. You can and should use it in any text editor like Notepad for your personal notes. <b>Especially when there is no tool support</b> because of the "easy to type manually"-syntax.

</p>

	  <header><h2>Org Mode Syntax Has Excellent Tool Support (If You Want)</h2></header>

<p>

As I mentioned in the beginning, this is not an article about Emacs. Nevertheless for anybody not familiar with Emacs I have to mention that with Emacs there is a tool that supports (not only) in writing Org mode syntax in a perfect way.

</p>

<p>

You might start with mouse-only usage. There are menu items with all important functions. For the users that want to get a minimum of efficiency, the menu items show you <a href="http://orgmode.org/orgcard.pdf">the keyboard shortcuts you might want to use</a>.

</p>

<p>

For Org mode syntax it is really easy to learn. Basically you just have to use <code>TAB</code> for toggle the collapsing and expanding of headings, lists, and blocks. It's <code>Alt</code> and the arrow keys to move around headings, list items, and even table columns/rows. <code>Ctrl-Return</code> creates a new heading or list item without the need of entering the markup characters and manually matching indentation levels at all.

</p>

<p>

That's it. With those three things you're good to write Org mode syntax efficiently. The basic file open/save, finding help, exiting Emacs stuff is accessible with icons or the menu. No need to <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/refcards/pdf/refcard.pdf">learn more keyboard shortcuts</a> if you don't want to.

</p>

<p>

Having experienced this great tool-support, users typically are eager to learn more. You don't have to. You might be happy with Org mode for capturing minutes of meetings and your shopping list. However, others do master a few additional things and <a href="https://github.com/vikasrawal/endingmalnutrition">write whole eBooks</a> <a href="http://irreal.org/blog/?p=5313">within Org mode</a>.

</p>

<p>

Since this article is not about Emacs, I want to explain why I mention the perfect Emacs support. My point is that Org mode deserves to be adopted for all kind of use-cases where a simple to read and simple to type lightweight markup is needed. However, <b>if</b> you want to have a decent tool support, there is no lightweight markup out there which has a better tool support compared to Org mode within Emacs. I did not find any tool support for Markdown, AsciiDoc, Wikitext or reStructuredText anywhere that could compete with the cozy Org mode syntax support within Emacs.

</p>

<p>

Yes, there could be more tool support outside of emacs but this is my point: change this. This syntax should support more people.

</p>

	  <header><h2>Summary</h2></header>

<p>

Lightweight markup languages are designed to be used with a minimum effort compared to full-blown and therefore more complicated markup languages such as HTML or LaTeX.

</p>

<p>

Some are doing their job better than others. In my experience, many design decisions of widely adapted markups such as Markdown, AsciiDoc or reStructuredText (and others) are questionable from a usability point of view. At least I do have some issues when I have to use them in my daily life.

</p>

<p>

Unfortunately, I hardly see any people out there using Org mode syntax as a markup language outside of Emacs although there are very good reasons for it as an easy to learn and easy to use markup language.

</p>

<p>

With this blog article I wanted to point out the usefulness of Org mode even when you are not using Emacs as an writing tool. Of course, when you are using Emacs to type Org mode syntax, you get probably the most advanced tool-support for typing lightweight markup on top. But this was not the point of this article.

</p>

<p>

Update 2021-11-28: Due to the high demand and discussions of this article, the idea grew in me that we do have to address some issues of Org-mode mentioned here. <b>Therefore, I came up with <a href="https://gitlab.com/publicvoit/orgdown">Orgdown</a>. You should check out <a href="https://karl-voit.at/2021/11/27/orgdown">my Orgdown motivation article</a>.</b>

<p>

<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/orgmode/comments/8690ex/as_a_markup_language_forgetting_about_todogtd/dwvl3d4/">"revocation" has a valid point related to the missing standardization of Org mode</a>. Here is my comment on this:

</p>

<p>

The statements here refer to a <b>lightweight</b> markup, the basic things of Org mode syntax. I explicitly listed "headings, lists, font variations such as bold face or italic, and such things".

</p>

<p>

What I do not cover here is a full syntax statement or standard. In my opinion, currently this is not possible outside of Emacs for various reasons.

</p>

<p>

Of course, there are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/orgmode/comments/8690ex/as_a_markup_language_forgetting_about_todogtd/dwizwjs/">variations in interpreting Org mode files between Emacs and pandoc</a>. Also, pandoc only supports a sub-set of Org mode. Otherwise, pandoc would have to re-implement or embed Emacs for parsing purposes.

</p>

<p>

In this specific case, pandoc seems to have a more strict parser related to leading spaces for #-lines, or keywords. I'm pretty sure that the pandoc project accepts this issue as a bug. In doubt, the interpretation of Emacs is the definition, or golden-standard, of Org mode syntax. Even <a href="https://orgmode.org/worg/dev/org-syntax.html">this beta-version of a syntax definition</a> does not mention optional spaces before keywords. <a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/Org-syntax.html">The manual</a> mentions <code>org-element-parse-buffer</code> and <code>org-lint</code> which would be most probably the best choice for defining the official standard if you would search for one.

</p>

<p>

However, this does not relate at all with the intention of this article: the design of the (basic) Org mode syntax compared to other lightweight markup languages. All the issues mentioned where other markups show inconsistencies and usability issues where Org mode seems to have advantages still do apply here. Completely independent of the standardization argument. My personal believe is, that if there would be more use of Org mode syntax elements outside of Emacs, there would be a much higher pressure on formally defining Org mode as a syntax which pandoc and even Emacs could use as the golden standard.

</p>

<p>

So far, there is not even the necessity of defining this golden standard because nobody outside of the Emacs community knows or even is using Org mode. And this is what I tried to change a bit because other markup languages do tend to hurt my geeky soul when I do have to use them. ;-)

</p>

	  <header><h2>Comment by Ian Zimmerman</h2></header>

<p>

Ian wrote an email comment on reStructuredText (ReST):

</p>

<blockquote>Most of your argument makes at least some sense, but you miss the
point of the ReST link syntax: the URL doesn't have to be inline! The
normal style (which I use for my blog) is like this:<br>
<code>blah blah blah follow the interesting link at `foo`_ blah blah blah</code><br>
<code>more blah bluh bleh</code><br>
<code>.. _foo: http ://www.foo.example.com</code><br>
which among other things means that you can mention and link foo
multiple times without repeating the URL.<br>
Maybe there is a way of doing that in org - I don't know, I'm a total
beginner.  That's why I'm reading your post.</blockquote>

<p>

(Note: I added an additional space character after <code>http</code> in the example above to work around <a href="https://github.com/novoid/lazyblorg/issues/46">this lazyblorg issue</a>.)

</p>

<p>

First, about that question related to defining an URL once and referring to it multiple times. I'm not aware of an Org mode feature that is providing this functionality except <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/org/Footnotes.html">footnotes</a>, which is not specific to URLs only. An even more general approach could be the use of very powerful <a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/Macro-Replacement.html">macro replacement</a>. However, discussion those things, we're far away from the discussion of markup that is lightweight.

</p>

<p>

Second, I acknowledge that I did not cover this possibility to define <a href="https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/user/rst/quickref.html#hyperlink-targets">URL references in REsT markup</a>. In my opinion and when I try to look at it from a hypothetic user perspective, I do think that this still proves my point. There is no logical explanation for that underscore character. I already had to add those back-ticks as syntax element. Why combining those back-ticks with an additional underscore? This does not make sense to me. Furthermore, where should I place this block where the URLs are defined? After each paragraph? Visual clutter. At the end of the text? Too fragile IMHO. And don't get me started on those two dots and the underscore switching places. This is certainly not putting more weight in the thought that ReST syntax has a higher level of logic.

</p>

<p>

For somebody looking for a smooth, easy to remember lightweight markup language, I still think that nothing beats Org mode in general. Even when we totally neglect the Emacs integration and 99 percent of its feature-set which allows for the most complex requirements while still being consistent and lightweight in syntax.

            <guid>46562790</guid>
            <pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 04:35:32 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://rushter.com/blog/zsh-shell/">https://rushter.com/blog/zsh-shell/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46562790">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Oh My Zsh is still getting recommended a lot.
The main problem with Oh My Zsh is that it adds a lot of unnecessary bloat that affects shell startup time.</p>
<p>Since OMZ is written in shell scripts, every time you open a new terminal tab, it has to interpret all those scripts.
Most likely, you don't need OMZ at all.</p>
<p>Here are the timings from the default setup with a few plugins:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>➜<span>  </span>~<span> </span>/usr/bin/time<span> </span>-f<span> </span><span>"%e seconds"</span><span> </span>zsh<span> </span>-i<span> </span>-c<span> </span><span>exit</span>
<span>0</span>.38<span> </span>seconds
</code></pre></div>

<p>And that's only for prompt and a new shell instance! Creating a new tab takes some time for your terminal too.
It feels like a whole second to me.</p>
<p>My workflows involve opening and closing up to hundreds of terminal or tmux tabs a day. I do everything from the terminal.
Just imagine that opening a new tab in a text editor would take half a second every time.</p>
<p>Once in a while, it also checks for updates, which can take up to a few seconds when you open a new tab.</p>
<p>I see no reason in frequent updates for my shell configuration.
Especially, when a lot of third-party plugins are getting updates too.
Why would you want you shell to fetch updates?</p>
<p>My advice is to start simple and only add what you really need.</p>
<h3>Minimal Zsh configuration</h3>
<p>Here is the minimal Zsh configuration that works well as a starting point:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>export</span><span> </span><span>HISTSIZE</span><span>=</span><span>1000000000</span>
<span>export</span><span> </span><span>SAVEHIST</span><span>=</span><span>$HISTSIZE</span>
setopt<span> </span>EXTENDED_HISTORY
setopt<span> </span>autocd
autoload<span> </span>-U<span> </span>compinit<span>;</span><span> </span>compinit
</code></pre></div>

<p>It's an already pretty good setup with completions!</p>
<p>Some details about this configuration:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>HISTSIZE</code> and <code>SAVEHIST</code> set the size of your history.</li>
<li><code>EXTENDED_HISTORY</code> adds timestamps to your history entries.</li>
<li><code>autocd</code> allows you to change directories without typing <code>cd</code>.</li>
<li><code>compinit</code> initializes the Zsh completion system.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Prompt customization</h3>
<p>You also want to customize your prompt.
For prompts, I'm using <a href="https://starship.rs/" target="_blank">starship</a> which is a fast and minimal prompt packed into a single binary.</p>
<p>The very old way of doing this in Oh My Zsh was to use plugins and custom themes.
With starship, it's very simple and easy now. It replaces git, virtual environment and language specific plugins.</p>
<p>Here is my config for starship:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>[aws]</span>
<span>disabled</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>true</span>

<span>[package]</span>
<span>disabled</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>true</span>

<span>[gcloud]</span>
<span>disabled</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>true</span>

<span>[azure]</span>
<span>disabled</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>true</span>


<span>[nodejs]</span>
<span>disabled</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>true</span>

<span>[character]</span>
<span>success_symbol</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>'[➜](bold green)'</span>

<span>[cmd_duration]</span>
<span>min_time</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>500</span>
<span>format</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>'underwent [$duration](bold yellow)'</span>

<span>[directory]</span>
<span>truncation_length</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>255</span>
<span>truncate_to_repo</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>false</span>
<span>use_logical_path</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>false</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Because cloud services are available globally, I've disabled them.
I don't want them to be displayed on every prompt, since this adds visual noise.</p>
<p>Here is how my prompt looks like now:
<img src="https://rushter.com/static/uploads/img/2026/prompt.png"></p>
<p>This project uses both Python and Rust, they are highlighted in the prompt.
When you run a command, it also shows how long it took to execute.</p>
<p>To enable it, add the following line to your <code>.zshrc</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>eval</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>$(</span>starship<span> </span>init<span> </span>zsh<span>)</span><span>"</span>
</code></pre></div>

<h3>History search</h3>
<p>A lot of people use <code>zsh-autosuggestions</code> plugin for history search.
I find it distracting, because it shows all suggestions as you type.</p>
<p>Instead, I prefer using <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf" target="_blank">fzf</a> binded to <code>Ctrl+R</code> for searching history.
It gives an interactive fuzzy search.</p>
<p><img src="https://rushter.com/static/uploads/img/2026/fzf.png"></p>
<p>To enable it, add the following lines to your <code>.zshrc</code>:</p>


<h3>Final startup time</h3>
<p>After these changes, the startup should look as follows:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>❯<span> </span>/usr/bin/time<span> </span>-f<span> </span><span>"%e seconds"</span><span> </span>zsh<span> </span>-i<span> </span>-c<span> </span><span>exit</span>
<span>0</span>.07<span> </span>seconds
</code></pre></div>

<h3>Miscellaneous tips</h3>
<p>For Vim users, I also suggest enabling Vim mode in Zsh. It makes editing commands much faster.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>set</span><span> </span>-o<span> </span>vi
<span># Fix for backspace in vi mode</span>
bindkey<span> </span>-v<span> </span><span>'^?'</span><span> </span>backward-delete-char
</code></pre></div>

<p>It works the same way as in Vim. By default, <code>zle</code> (the library that reads the shell input) uses Emacs keybindings.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>After switching from OMZ a year ago, it only took me a few days to get used to the new workflow.
If you still missing some of the plugins, you can always load them manually.</p></div><p><span>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
								
<p>When I switched from an iMac to a Mac mini in late 2024 I choose an <a href="https://www.asus.com/us/displays-desktops/monitors/proart/proart-display-5k-pa27jcv/techspec/">ASUS ProArt 5K PA27JCV</a> (24″, 60 Hz) for the monitor and while it looked great, it died after 14 months, seemingly with a backlight or power supply problem. ASUS’ warranty support requires shipping the monitor back, potentially waiting 3-4 weeks, and then getting a replacement. And worse, the replacement could have dead pixels, as the ASUS warranty doesn’t consider ≤5 dark pixels a problem.</p>



<p>The old <a href="https://support.hp.com/us-en/product/details/hp-zr2440w-24-inch-led-backlit-ips-monitor/5163690">HP ZR2440w</a> that I swapped in as a spare wasn’t cutting it, so with an indeterminate wait ahead of me, potentially receiving something with bad pixels, and my being vaguely interested in something larger and with a faster refresh rate I went looking at new monitors.</p>



<p>Coming to the realization that 4K is probably fine I picked up a <a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-32-plus-4k-qd-oled-monitor-s3225qc/apd/210-brvv/monitors-monitor-accessories">Dell 32 Plus 4K QD-OLED Monitor – S3225QC</a> from Costco for $499. It was well reviewed online and looked pretty good when I played with one for about 20 minutes at Micro Center. When I got home and sat in front of it doing my normal things it looked a bit… different… almost as if my glasses weren’t working quite right. But I figured new monitor tech just needed some time for me to get accustomed to. After all, it had a very high contrast ratio and sharp pixels; maybe it’s just that?</p>



<p>After a few days it still didn’t feel right, so I began looking for a solution. Costco has a 90-day return window for computer monitors, so I had some time, but this didn’t look good; I wanted an answer soon.</p>



<p>I was fortunate to be able to borrow a <a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-ultrasharp-32-4k-usb-c-hub-monitor-u3223qe/apd/210-bdph/monitors-monitor-accessories">Dell UltraSharp 32 4K USB-C Hub Monitor U3223QE</a> for the weekend, which was perfect as being a being a high end display with the same resolution and panel size as the S3225QC I could compare them side by side. And in the end the LCD just looked better.</p>

<p>I took some macro photos of both displays and it turns out that what was bothering me was <a href="https://pcmonitors.info/articles/qd-oled-and-woled-fringing-issues/">fringing</a>, a problem common to OLEDs. It was hard to point out during normal use other than text-is-a-bit-blurry-and-weird , or like an oversharpened image, or almost like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compression_artifact">artifacted text in a JPEG</a> image, but with photos it was much easier to see what’s going on. And better, the cause: the arrangement of the subpixels; the little red/blue/green dots that make up a pixel.</p>



<p>As shown above, the subpixles in the Dell S3225QC QD-OLED form a square with green on the top, a larger red pixel in the lower left, and smaller blue in the lower right. The Dell U3223QE, a typical LCD, has three vertical stripes making a square. The result being that high contrast edges look very different on an OLED, often with a strong off-color border — or fringe — along horizontal and vertical lines.</p>



<p>In the photos above, note the vertical part of the 1 which has red and green dots along its right side, and large red dots along the top of the 6 with green along the bottom. These are the strongly colored fringes. (On the LCD they appear white as the three equal size subpixels pixels act equally.)</p>



<p>This meant that things that I tend to do, text or fine lines in maps or CAD-type drawing, are not right at all on the pixel pattern found in this OLED panel. Beyond the pixel pattern, I also suspect that the much crisper pixels (defined points of light) contribute to the fringing having an artifacting-like effect.</p>



<p>This was much more pronounced when looking at light text on a dark background; the way that I read most websites. <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> does a wonderful job demonstrating this problem:</p>

<p>This gets at why OLEDs make great TVs and gaming monitors. The contrast is outstanding, color is excellent, and high refresh rates are ideal for moving images and fast-response games. And there’s no noticeable fringing because edges are constantly moving across pixels; almost nothing is still. They also work great on small devices like phones where the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_density">pixel density</a> is so high that fringing is too small to see.</p>



<p>But on desktop monitors for still things — text and fine lines — OLEDs currently just aren’t great; I guess that’s why office and productivity type monitors are still LCDs. Even though I don’t like being that person who returns computer stuff just because they don’t like it, I ended up returning the monitor after only four days of using it. The S3225QC and it’s QD-OLED just doesn’t work for me; it made my eyes feel funny to use.</p>



<p>Within the past few weeks <a href="https://news.lgdisplay.com/en/2025/12/lg-display-unveils-worlds-first-240hz-rgb-stripe-oled-panel/">LG has announced RGB stripe OLED panels</a> which will resolve this problem, but there aren’t currently any monitors available using these panels, so back to an LCD I’ll go. (It looks like <a href="https://www.analyticsinsight.net/news/ces-2026-first-rgbstripe-qdoleds-from-msi-asus-can-finally-fix-text-fringing">ASUS and MSI will some them available soon, but only as wide-screen gaming monitors</a>. And I suspect the first ones available will be fairly expensive.)</p>



<p>Whether this’ll be buying my own U3223QE, perhaps a <a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-ultrasharp-32-4k-thunderbolt-hub-monitor-u3225qe/apd/210-bqhs/monitors-monitor-accessories">Dell U3225QE</a> (adds 120 Hz scanning, an ambient light sensor, and a Thunderbolt dock), or just waiting for an ASUS PA27JCV to come back, I’m not sure… But whatever I end up using will, for now, will be an LCD, not an OLED.</p>

<p><span>This works better than trying to finish five minutes early. Meetings often don’t finish on time, and the impact is highest with back-to-back meetings. If you try to end at 1:55pm, you will likely talk until 2:00pm anyway, which then runs into the next meeting. But shifting the start time usually guarantees a break. Why? Because there is strong social pressure not to allow meetings to run much past the top of the hour <strong>when that is the official end-time</strong>. The same social pressure applies to meetings that end at the half-hour.</span></p>
<p><span>That short break changes the tone of a meeting. It takes a minute or two to move between events, even online. When people arrive at 1:05pm, they are settled and less stressed. You might fear that people will start arriving at 1:07pm, but I have seen the opposite. They respect the new time. They arrive by 1:05pm, ready to work.</span></p>
<p><span>Do we lose five minutes in every meeting? In theory, yes. </span><span>But meetings rarely started on the dot anyway before this change.</span></p>
<p><span>On balance, it is a win. The best proof is that the entire org does it now (the org didn’t copy my team — it just started organically), even though it is not mandatory. Like good code, a good team is built on small, sane details. Giving people five minutes to clear their heads, between back-to-back meetings, is a detail that works.</span></p>
<p>Try it — you’ll see it improves your day.</p>

So my natural first question is, can I game on it? Let’s try it out and compare it with some similar computers.</p><p>For the showdown of crappy gaming computers, we’ll see which of these handles gaming best:</p><h3 id="beelink-mini-s13"><a href="https://amzn.to/4qh5EOe">Beelink MINI-S13</a></h3><ul><li><strong>CPU:</strong> 4-core Intel N150 @ 3.6GHz</li><li><strong>RAM:</strong> 16GB DDR4</li><li><strong>PCIe:</strong> M.2 Gen3 x4</li></ul><p><img src="https://scottjg.com/posts/2026-01-08-crappy-computer-showdown/beelink-top.jpg" alt="beelink-top.jpg"><img src="https://scottjg.com/posts/2026-01-08-crappy-computer-showdown/beelink-bottom.jpg" alt="beelink-bottom.jpg"></p><p>More powerful than the Raspberry Pi 5, but at a similar price point. It also has a potential advantage for running games, since it’s not ARM-based.</p><p>In the photo, you can see the default configuration (SSD in the fast PCIe slot). For this experiment, I’ll move it into the slower (x1) slot and plug the eGPU into the faster (x4) slot.</p><h3 id="radxa-rock-5b"><a href="https://amzn.to/4qf4uCU">Radxa ROCK 5B</a></h3><ul><li><strong>CPU:</strong> 8-core RK3588 (4× Cortex-A76 @ 2.4GHz + 4× Cortex-A55 @ 1.8GHz)</li><li><strong>RAM:</strong> 16GB DDR4</li><li><strong>PCIe:</strong> M.2 Gen3 x4</li><li><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://amzn.to/4qwrXjf">Aftermarket heat sink &amp; fan combo</a></li></ul><p><img src="https://scottjg.com/posts/2026-01-08-crappy-computer-showdown/rock5b-top.jpg" alt="rock5b-top.jpg"><img src="https://scottjg.com/posts/2026-01-08-crappy-computer-showdown/rock5b-bottom.jpg" alt="rock5b-bottom.jpg"></p><p>Pretty comparable to the Raspberry Pi 5 (it’s ARM), but the extra cores give it a little more horsepower. The faster PCIe slot is also included on-board. Since the PCIe slot will be taken for the GPU, we’ll just use a <a href="https://amzn.to/4pzyybl">USB SSD</a> for both ARM boards.</p><h3 id="raspberry-pi-5"><a href="https://amzn.to/4jxuw1r">Raspberry Pi 5</a></h3><ul><li><strong>CPU:</strong> 4-core BCM2712 (Cortex-A76 @ 2.4GHz)</li><li><strong>RAM:</strong> 16GB DDR4</li><li><strong>PCIe:</strong> M.2 Gen2 x1 (via <a href="https://amzn.to/49vdJb2">NVme HAT</a>)</li><li><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://amzn.to/4sCeFmI">Aftermarket heat sink &amp; fan combo</a></li></ul><p><img src="https://scottjg.com/posts/2026-01-08-crappy-computer-showdown/rpi5-top.jpg" alt="rpi5-top.jpg"><img src="https://scottjg.com/posts/2026-01-08-crappy-computer-showdown/rpi5-bottom.jpg" alt="rpi5-bottom.jpg"></p><p>This is why we’re all here. It’s the quintessential hobbyist SBC. Unfortunately it’s the most challenged: fewer cores, and significantly less PCIe bandwidth. The Pi 5’s Gen2 x1 slot provides ~500 MB/s, compared to ~4,000 MB/s on the Gen3 x4 slots of the other machines, an 8x difference.</p><h3 id="egpu">eGPU</h3><p>We will be using a relatively inexpensive <a href="https://amzn.to/3LuqWIV">OCuLink dock</a> to pair with our very expensive GPU. If you’re not familiar with the technology, it’s basically a PCIe extension cord to let you plug a graphics card into a computer that wouldn’t normally fit one. The dock is powered externally by a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/quiet-Certification-semi-Passive-Technology-Overclocked/dp/B0FBX9VS3B?th=1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=scottjg-20&amp;linkId=7741030a2c13875241c115fadf12ab8e&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl">separate power supply</a>.</p><p>For this experiment, we’re using an NVIDIA RTX 5090 Founders Edition (32GB VRAM).</p><p><img alt="OCuLink eGPU dock" loading="lazy" src="https://scottjg.com/posts/2026-01-08-crappy-computer-showdown/egpu-oculink.jpg"></p><p>The OCuLink cable plugs into an M.2 card that we’ll insert into each machine as we test it.</p><p>On the Intel-based Beelink machine, from a software perspective the card is more or less indistinguishable from a normal graphics card. We can just install the normal NVIDIA drivers.</p><p>The ARM-based computers we’re testing have various quirks (lack of DMA coherence, memory alignment requirements, etc.) that make them incompatible with most GPU drivers out of the box. Luckily, <a href="https://github.com/mariobalanica">@mariobalanca</a> wrote some patches that allow the drivers to work on these systems. NVIDIA already had some workarounds in the user-space part of their drivers for Ampere-based systems for memory alignment issues, so some of that gets inherited here.</p><p>I have packaged the drivers you can run on Ubuntu or Fedora <a href="https://github.com/scottjg/nvidia-armsbc">here</a>, if you’d like to try this yourself.</p><p>If you’ve gotten this far and simply don’t believe this actually works, here’s a screenshot:
<img alt="Raspberry Pi 5 GPU screenshot" loading="lazy" src="https://scottjg.com/posts/2026-01-08-crappy-computer-showdown/pi5-gpu-screenshot.jpg"></p><h2 id="cpu-performance">CPU Performance</h2><p>Before we get into the games, let’s take a look at how these machines compare.</p><p>Most PC games are designed for Intel CPUs. If we want to play them on ARM we’ll have to use a compatibility layer called FEX. The graph shows not only the native performance of the machines, but also the significantly degraded performance under FEX. To be fair, FEX is an incredible feat of engineering, but all emulation comes at a cost.</p><p>The Raspberry Pi 5 under FEX seems to have similar performance to a 2008 Intel Core 2 Quad Q9650. Not very promising. That said, gamers usually say that, for most games, it’s OK to skimp on CPU a bit as long as you have a good GPU. We will definitely be testing that line of thinking.</p><h2 id="games">Games</h2><p>I tried to find games that had built-in benchmarks that also worked under FEX, along with Steam’s Proton compatibility layer, tilting towards games that didn’t have as strong CPU requirements. It turns out this is actually not a huge list. Here are a handful that I tried:</p><h3 id="cyberpunk-2077-2020">Cyberpunk 2077 (2020)</h3><p><img alt="Screenshot of Cyberpunk 2077 running on the Raspberry Pi" loading="lazy" src="https://scottjg.com/posts/2026-01-08-crappy-computer-showdown/cyberpunk-rpi5-ultra.jpg"></p><p>Yes, believe it or not, <code>vkcube</code> is not the only thing you can run in this configuration. Through the maze of compatibility layers (FEX, WINE/Proton, DXVK, etc), you too can run Cyberpunk 2077 on your Raspberry Pi 5. The screenshot above is running at 1080p with Ultra Raytracing quality settings.</p><p>The game is playable on the Beelink machine with some lower settings. Since it’s an Intel machine, I also tested the game on Windows for posterity. Usually it’s suggested that even with all the compatibility layers, Linux gaming can be faster, but not in this case on the lower settings here.</p><p>These games really get CPU bound, caught up on these lower-spec CPUs. I think on a normal gaming PC, it wouldn’t matter as much, but every cycle starts to count here, and not all the abstractions provided by WINE are zero cost.</p><p>Unfortunately the Pi barely breaks 15 FPS, but on the ROCK 5B, it approaches playable on low settings. Granted, not sure how fun that would be at 22 FPS.</p><h3 id="doom-the-dark-ages-2025">Doom: The Dark Ages (2025)</h3><p>This game doesn’t run under FEX, so I didn’t collect full benchmarks here. The anti-cheat stuff is too weird and doesn’t get properly emulated.</p><p>However, the benchmark does offer a unique view into the challenges these low-power PCs face.</p><p><img alt="Doom: The Dark Ages benchmark" loading="lazy" src="https://scottjg.com/posts/2026-01-08-crappy-computer-showdown/doom-benchmark.jpg"></p><p>You can see it running on the Beelink here. The GPU is absolutely shredding through the Ultra quality frames at 4K resolution, but the CPU is really struggling. You can see the GPU is able to process almost 90 FPS, but because of the bottleneck at the CPU, the overall frame rate can’t break 30 FPS. That’s the main challenge here.</p><h3 id="alien-isolation-2014">Alien: Isolation (2014)</h3><p>My next thought was, maybe if we jump back a decade, we can have better luck. This game actually ships with a Linux port. Unfortunately the Linux port doesn’t include the built-in benchmark tool, so I ran it under Proton/WINE. I also found that DXVK caused every game from this point onward to crash immediately on the ARM hosts, so I run the games with <code>PROTON_USE_WINED3D=1</code> to fall back to the OpenGL renderer.</p><p>For those unfamiliar: DXVK translates DirectX calls to Vulkan, while WineD3D translates them to OpenGL. The GPU driver, when running on ARM, has a Vulkan implementation that apparently has issues when running under FEX that OpenGL avoids. Something to keep in mind if you’re trying to replicate this.</p><p><img alt="Screenshot of Alien: Isolation running the benchmark" loading="lazy" src="https://scottjg.com/posts/2026-01-08-crappy-computer-showdown/alien-isolation-rpi5.jpg"></p><p>Honestly, not the best looking game by modern standards, even on Ultra settings. It does have some cool lighting effects, at least. I admit I have never played this game for real, so I can’t vouch for it being fun or not. I just ran the benchmark tool.</p><p>I initially tested this game on the Beelink and thought it looked promising. Relatively low CPU usage. It seems like it is playable on the ROCK 5B with an average 23 FPS. Not sure about the Pi though, at only 15 FPS.</p><h3 id="hitman-absolution-2012">Hitman: Absolution (2012)</h3><p>OK, OK. So we already know the performance of the Pi is on par with a PC from 2008, so I figured, let’s go back a couple more years.</p><p><img alt="Hitman Absolution Benchmark" loading="lazy" src="https://scottjg.com/posts/2026-01-08-crappy-computer-showdown/hitman-absolution.jpg"></p><p>Couldn’t get the windowed mode to work right on this one, but I swear it’s running on the Raspberry Pi 5. You can probably tell from the FPS counter.</p><p>I would say the performance makes it basically unusable on these ARM machines.</p><p>That said, the Beelink really shines here. Windows perf is way ahead of Linux on this one too. More than playable on both, though.</p><p>I was actually a little puzzled by this one. It seems like it shouldn’t be this bad on the ARM hosts. This feels like a performance bug, but it’s hard to say where in the stack it might be. Oh well.</p><h3 id="just-cause-2-demo-2010">Just Cause 2 Demo (2010)</h3><p>OK, so let’s go back <em>another</em> couple years. This demo was free, thankfully.</p><p><img alt="Just Cause 2 Benchmark" loading="lazy" src="https://scottjg.com/posts/2026-01-08-crappy-computer-showdown/just-cause-2-rpi5.jpg"></p><p>So remember earlier when I said I had to disable DXVK for these games to run on ARM? On Intel Windows, I had to actually add DXVK because the game crashed immediately on launch. Weird.</p><p>Nearly 40 FPS average on a Raspberry Pi 5. 2010 is our year! Windows still dominates here. It’s more apples-to-apples on Beelink’s Linux vs Windows now since now both are using DXVK.</p><h3 id="portal-2-2011">Portal 2 (2011)</h3><p>After I had run all of these, I was curious to try Portal 2. Valve is the company that maintains Proton and FEX. You’d think they maybe would have optimized it for their own games. It’s also old enough that it’s in the sweet spot of potentially being playable on the Pi.</p><p><img alt="Portal 2" loading="lazy" src="https://scottjg.com/posts/2026-01-08-crappy-computer-showdown/portal2-rpi5.jpg"></p><p>Sadly, Portal 2 does not ship with a built-in benchmark. However, it does have a <code>timedemo</code> feature where you can record yourself playing and then play it back as a benchmark. I picked a random level and recorded it. Then, ran it on the test systems. Since there was a native version, I benchmarked that alongside the Proton/WINE version.</p><p>So, now that we have a native Linux port to compare with, it totally leaves Windows in the dust (finally). Most importantly, the Raspberry Pi 5 can play this game at 4K resolution, way above 60 FPS.</p><p>So I can now say with a straight face, that it’s possible to use the Raspberry Pi 5 to game in 4K, admittedly strapped to a GPU that’s roughly worth 10x the price of the Pi. In all seriousness, probably any lower-end GPU would work here. Clearly we’re not using the 5090 to its full potential anyway.</p><h2 id="power-usage">Power Usage</h2><p>These machines are also known to be low power. I guess for a gaming computer, I’m not sure how important that is. You can just turn it off when you’re not using it. That said, a gaming PC CPU could use 20-50w while completely idle.</p><p>For these measurements I took the idle power usage and also average power usage during the Cyberpunk 4K Ultra Raytracing benchmark, both measured at the AC outlet. This does not include the GPU, just the CPU, since that’s what we’re really comparing here.</p><p>The Pi 5 sips power at under 9W even under load, while the Beelink pulls almost 30W during the benchmark. One way of looking at it, is that the Beelink performs so much faster in games, and the amount of power is proportional to that.</p><p>Another way to look at it, is if the ARM-based machines weren’t mired in emulating x86, they probably would have considerably better performance on per-watt basis compared to the Intel CPU.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>So, can you game on a Raspberry Pi 5 with an RTX 5090? I guess, technically, yes. Would you want to? Probably not.</p><ul><li><strong>Modern games (2020+):</strong> Most likely unplayable. The CPU perf degradation under FEX is brutal. Even playing on the lowest 720p settings, Cyberpunk barely hits 16 FPS average on the Pi 5.</li><li><strong>2010-era games:</strong> If you’re trying to play older games, you can probably get away with it. You also probably do not need a graphics card as powerful as the 5090.</li></ul><p>The Beelink is the clear winner if you actually want to game. It’s still terrible, but it’s cheap, runs x86 natively, and with the right settings, it can hit 50 FPS+ in every game I tried. Windows consistently outperformed Linux on most WINE/Proton titles, so you’re probably better off just installing Windows on it.</p><p>The ROCK 5B edges out the Raspberry Pi 5 slightly in most benchmarks, but not by much. The extra cores and PCIe bandwidth don’t seem to matter as much as the raw performance lost to FEX emulation. That said, it does bring the game from painfully playable to borderline playable in some games.</p><p>Given all the momentum around ARM (Valve is about to ship an ARM VR headset, and NVIDIA is rumored to ship their own SoC with an NVIDIA GPU soon), I think future platforms will probably be better optimized, and Linux gaming on ARM will probably be more plausible in the future. Sadly, I don’t recommend strapping your super expensive graphics card to a cheap SBC for now. Unless it’s just for a fun blog post.</p></div></div>]]></description>
