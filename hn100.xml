<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><h5>April 9, 2024</h5><p>This post is a continuation of my journey to build a complete computer system using discrete logic components. At this point I have made a computer capable of running network applications like an HTTP server or a LAN game.</p><p>Last year I built <a href="https://qdiv.dev/posts/eth-to-spi">a physical level adapter</a> which converts a 10BASE-T Ethernet signal to SPI and back. Back then I used an STM32 microcontroller to test its operation, now I’m implementing a MAC layer module to connect it to my <a href="https://qdiv.dev/posts/ccpu">homebrew computer</a>.</p><p>Both adapters are full-duplex and have independent transmitter and receiver parts.</p><p><img src="https://qdiv.dev/eth2/overview-eth.jpg" alt="Discrete logic computer">

<em>The new module with PHY shield removed. Bodge wires fix swapped SCK and MOSI.</em></p><h2 id="receiver">Receiver
<a href="#receiver">#</a></h2><p>Summary of receiver operation:</p><ul><li>SPI serial data is converted to bytewise parallel data, byte clock is extracted;</li><li>First 6 bytes are checked against destination MAC address criteria, unmatched frames are rejected;</li><li>Bytes are written into a static RAM buffer;</li><li>When a frame ends, receiver is disabled and further frames are rejected until user re-arms the receiver. Byte counter is stopped, its value is made accessible to the user.</li></ul><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_check_sequence">FCS</a> is not checked in hardware.</p><h3 id="data-collection">Data collection
<a href="#data-collection">#</a></h3><p>Firstly, serial SPI data needs to be converted into a stream of bytes.</p><p><img src="https://qdiv.dev/eth2/receiver.png" alt="Receiver"></p><p>Serial data is shifted into a shift register (<code>U32</code>). <code>U30</code> and <code>U31</code> count bits and bytes respectively. Static RAM write signal <code>recv_buf_we</code> is formed using a D flip-flop <code>U29B</code>. This signal briefly becomes low after each 8 bits of input data:</p><p><img src="https://qdiv.dev/eth2/recv_buf_we.svg" alt="recv_buf_we"></p><p>Received bytes are written into a 2 kB static RAM buffer 6116 (<code>U20</code>).</p><p><img src="https://qdiv.dev/eth2/recv-buffer.png" alt="receiver buffer"></p><p><code>U13</code>, <code>U16</code> and <code>U18</code> form an address multiplexer: it chooses either byte counter or system address bus as an address input for the SRAM (<code>U20</code>). A tri-state buffer <code>U21</code> forwards the received byte into the RAM.</p><p>To access the received data and its length, RAM and byte counter are connected to the system data bus with tri-state buffers:</p><p><img src="https://qdiv.dev/eth2/recv-output.png" alt="receiver output"></p><p><code>U25</code> connects the receiver RAM with the system data bus. After a frame is complete, the byte counter is not reset and its value is kept on the <code>recv_byte_cnt</code> bus. This bus is connected with the system data bus using <code>U26</code> and <code>U27</code>. They are activated when CPU makes a read request to specific addresses. The other half of <code>U27</code> makes a two-bit read-only status register which is used to query receiver and transmitter status.</p><h3 id="mac-address-filtering">MAC address filtering
<a href="#mac-address-filtering">#</a></h3><p>When analyzing the Ethernet traffic I noticed that frames usually come in small groups (3-4 frames together separated by a short delay). Frames in one group usually have different destination MAC addresses. This made me think that my computer won’t be able to filter received frames by MAC and re-arm the receiver fast enough to catch the frames meant for itself. I needed a hardware MAC address filtering.</p><p>Storing a custom MAC address somewhere and then comparing first 6 received bytes against it is a no-go: too complex. I could also make it a repetition of a single byte (e.g. FE:FE:FE:FE:FE:FE), but that’s boring. To bring some variation to my MAC, I made it a function of the byte index:</p><ul><li>Bit 0 is fixed to 0;</li><li>Bit 1 is fixed to 1;</li><li>Bits 2-4 are an inversion of the byte index;</li><li>Bits 5-7 are fixed to 1.</li></ul><p>Using this rule, the MAC address comes out to be <code>FE:FA:F6:F2:EE:EA</code>. We also need to accept the broadcast MAC <code>FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF</code> to work with ARP.</p><p><img src="https://qdiv.dev/eth2/mac-filter.png" alt="MAC filter"></p><p>On this schematics, bus <code>a[0..3]</code> is the lower 4 bits of the byte counter. Bus <code>d[0..7]</code> is the received byte. <code>U33</code> compares data bits 0 and 2-4 with their desired values, the output of <code>U34A</code> will be high when those bits match. <code>U35A</code> implements the broadcast MAC check: its output will be high when bits 0 and 2-4 are all ones. Those two signals are combined with a logical OR (implemented with diodes <code>D7</code> and resistor <code>R6</code>). The remaining bits are checked for being all ones with <code>U35B</code>.</p><p>This block only checks the validity of a single byte. To check all six of them, the result is accumulated in <code>U10A</code>. When no frame is being received, <code>ss</code> (the incoming SPI slave select signal) is low and <code>U10A</code> is set to 1. During frame reception this value is updated for each received byte. If destination MAC address matches the criteria, the value of <code>U10A</code> stays high. When byte address reaches 5, the final value is latched into <code>U36B</code>. Its output is used to inhibit frame reception if destination address is unmatched.</p><h2 id="transmitter">Transmitter
<a href="#transmitter">#</a></h2><p>Similarly to the receiver, the transmitter doesn’t implement FCS generation, it is done in software. To simplify the transmitter even further, I decided to only support frames of a fixed length. This way no complex digital comparator is necessary, the frame transmission logic only depends on a single bit of the byte counter. I selected the frame length to be 1024 bytes, this is close to the usual MTU of 1500 bytes. The frame preamble (the sequence of several 0x55 ending with a 0xD5 required by 10BASE-T) is also included in those 1024 bytes and needs to be loaded there in software.</p><p>Fixing the frame length doesn’t have any effect on higher-level protocols because they encode the packet size in their headers and do not rely on the actual Ethernet frame length.</p><p>Summary of transmitter operation:</p><ul><li>Data is stored in a static RAM;</li><li>20 MHz clock is fed to a 4-bit counter, its overflow output is used as a byte clock;</li><li>To transmit a frame, user writes to a specific write-only memory location which enables the counter;</li><li>Parallel byte data is serialized using a shift register.</li></ul><h3 id="counters">Counters
<a href="#counters">#</a></h3><p><img src="https://qdiv.dev/eth2/tx-counters.png" alt="tx counters"></p><p>Same as in the receiver, two counters are used to count bits (<code>U12</code>) and bytes (<code>U14</code>). First counter is fed by a 20 MHz clock from an integrated oscillator. 20 MHz is not used directly, but only divided at least by 2. This way the duty cycle of the oscillator doesn’t affect the output signal.</p><h3 id="data-flow">Data flow
<a href="#data-flow">#</a></h3><p><img src="https://qdiv.dev/eth2/tx-dataflow.png" alt="tx data flow"></p><p>Same as in the receiver three 74HC157 multiplexors (not shown here) are used to select address input for the RAM (<code>U22</code>). <code>U23</code> is used to load data into the RAM. <code>U24</code> acts as an intermediate storage for the byte currently being transmitted. The idea here is similar to my <a href="https://qdiv.dev/posts/vga/#image-generation">VGA pipeline</a>: byte counter 74HC4040 is a ripple counter and is slow to stabilize, <code>U24</code> provides a stable output while RAM output is still invalid. This data is fed to the shift register <code>U28</code> and shifted bit-by-bit.</p><p><em>After I’d built the thing I noticed that I’d messed up the order of bits coming from the RAM to the shift register. I had to shuffle bits in software to workaround this hardware bug. This was something I couldn’t test in Verilog beforehand.</em></p><p>To form a nice 10BASE-T signal (see <a href="https://qdiv.dev/posts/eth-to-spi/#transmitter">my previous post</a>) <code>MOSI</code> and <code>SCK</code> should be precisely synchronized. <code>U11A</code> and <code>U8B</code> achieve that. <code>tx_cnt0</code> (bit 0 of the bit counter, 20 MHz divided by 2) is used as a clock. <code>U11A</code> changes its output in sync with this signal. <code>U8B</code> delays the clock to match the delay introduced by <code>U11A</code>. Because a D-latch is more complex than a simple AND gate and has a slightly larger (by 5 ns) delay, a faster 74LV74A is used here. Its propagation delay is the same as of 74HC08. This is the only chip of a “fast” family on this board.</p><h2 id="cpu-interface">CPU interface
<a href="#cpu-interface">#</a></h2><p>From the programmer’s point of view, my Ethernet adapter has following interface:</p><ul><li>Both frame buffers are mapped at <code>0xF000</code>.</li><li>There are two read-only registers:<ul><li>8-bit status register at <code>0xFB00</code> has two flags:<ul><li><code>RX_FULL</code> - a frame is received,</li><li><code>TX_BUSY</code> - a frame is being transmitted;</li></ul></li><li>16-bit received data length register at <code>0xFB02</code>.</li></ul></li><li>Writing any value at <code>0xFB00</code> re-arms the receiver.</li><li>Writing any value at <code>0xFB01</code> starts a transmission.</li></ul><p>There are no interrupts since my CPU doesn’t support them.</p><p><img src="https://qdiv.dev/eth2/addr-select.png" alt="address selector"></p><p>Any relevant address starts with an <code>F</code> (upper 4 bits are all ones). This condition is checked by <code>U2A</code>.</p><p>Bit 11 should be 0 for a buffer address. <code>U1D</code>, <code>D2</code>, <code>R2</code> and <code>U1E</code> check that. Then the buffer select signal is combined with either write- or output-enable signals to select writing to the TX buffer or reading from the RX buffer.</p><p>Second hex digit being <code>B</code> (1011) for registers is checked by <code>U1B</code> and <code>U2B</code>. Then another diode logic block (<code>D1</code>, <code>R1</code>, <code>U1C</code>) combines it with the first digit check. Decoders <code>U4A</code> and <code>U4B</code> are used to select the individual function.</p><p>Two LEDs indicate buffer or register access.</p><h2 id="programming">Programming
<a href="#programming">#</a></h2><p>I wanted a network support for my computer, but didn’t want to implement a TCP/IP stack myself. Also I wanted a decent C compiler because my first compiler sucked and programming in assembly is annoying. So I made a <a href="https://github.com/imihajlow/ccpu-cc">C compiler</a>. It is mature enough to compile uIP 1.0 (a tiny TCP/IP library). Despite my CPU having awfully low code density, uIP is small enough to fit into RAM and have some place left for an actual application.</p><p>Network performance is very low, but I’m still very happy with it considering that no commercial CPUs or special chips are involved here:</p><ul><li>Ping round trip average 85 ms;</li><li>HTTP server download speed 2.6 kB/s (serving static files from the SD card).</li></ul><h2 id="project-repository">Project repository

<p><em>Those of you who haven’t been in IT for far, far too long might not know that next month will be the 16th(!) anniversary of the <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/DSA-1571-1">disclosure</a> of what was, at the time, a fairly earth-shattering revelation: that for about 18 months, the Debian OpenSSL package was <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-0166">generating entirely predictable private keys</a>.</em></p>

<p>The recent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XZ_Utils_backdoor">xz-stential threat</a> (thanks to <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@nixCraft@mastodon.social">@nixCraft</a> for <a href="https://mastodon.social/@nixCraft/112219225728684695">making me aware of that one</a>), has got me thinking about my own serendipitous interaction with a major vulnerability.
Given that the statute of limitations has (probably) run out, I thought I’d share it as a tale of how “huh, that’s weird” can be a powerful threat-hunting tool – but only if you’ve got the time to keep pulling at the thread.</p>

<h2 id="prelude-to-an-adventure">Prelude to an Adventure</h2>

<p>Our story begins back in March 2008.
I was working at Engine Yard (EY), a now largely-forgotten Rails-focused hosting company, which pioneered several advances in Rails application deployment.
Probably EY’s greatest claim to lasting fame is that they helped launch a little code hosting platform you might have heard of, by providing them free infrastructure when they were little more than a glimmer in the Internet’s eye.</p>

<p>I am, of course, talking about everyone’s favourite Microsoft product: GitHub.</p>

<p>Since GitHub was in the right place, at the right time, with a compelling product offering, they quickly started to gain traction, and grow their userbase.
With growth comes challenges, amongst them the one we’re focusing on today: SSH login times.
Then, as now, GitHub provided SSH access to the git repos they hosted, by SSHing to <code>git@github.com</code> with publickey authentication.
They were using the standard way that everyone manages SSH keys: the <code>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code> file, and that became a problem as the number of keys started to grow.</p>

<p>The way that SSH uses this file is that, when a user connects and asks for publickey authentication, SSH opens the <code>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code> file and scans all of the keys listed in it, looking for a key which matches the key that the user presented.
This linear search is normally not a huge problem, because nobody in their right mind puts more than a few keys in their <code>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code>, right?</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://www.hezmatt.org/~mpalmer/blog/images/2008_github_auth_keys_sideeye.jpg" alt="2008-era GitHub giving monkey puppet side-eye to the idea that nobody stores many keys in an authorized_keys file">
</figure>

<p>Of course, as a popular, rapidly-growing service, GitHub was gaining users at a fair clip, to the point that the one big file that stored all the SSH keys was starting to visibly impact SSH login times.
This problem was also not going to get any better by itself.
Something Had To Be Done.</p>

<p>EY management was keen on making sure GitHub ran well, and so despite it not <em>really</em> being a hosting problem, they were willing to help fix this problem.
For some reason, the late, great, Ezra Zygmuntowitz pointed GitHub in my direction, and let me take the time to <em>really</em> get into the problem with the GitHub team.
After examining a variety of different possible solutions, we came to the conclusion that the least-worst option was to patch OpenSSH to lookup keys in a MySQL database, indexed on the key fingerprint.</p>

<p>We didn’t take this decision on a whim – it wasn’t a case of “yeah, sure, let’s just hack around with OpenSSH, what could possibly go wrong?”.
We knew it was potentially catastrophic if things went sideways, so you can imagine how much worse the other options available were.
Ensuring that this wouldn’t compromise security was a lot of the effort that went into the change.
In the end, though, we rolled it out in early April, and lo! SSH logins were fast, and we were pretty sure we wouldn’t have to worry about this problem for a long time to come.</p>

<p>Normally, you’d think “patching OpenSSH to make mass SSH logins super fast” would be a good story on its own.
But no, this is just the opening scene.</p>

<h2 id="chekovs-gun-makes-its-appearance">Chekov’s Gun Makes its Appearance</h2>

<p>Fast forward a little under a month, to the first few days of May 2008.
I get a message from one of the GitHub team, saying that <em>somehow</em> users were able to access other users’ repos over SSH.
Naturally, as we’d recently rolled out the OpenSSH patch, which touched <em>this very thing</em>, the code I’d written was suspect number one, so I was called in to help.</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://www.hezmatt.org/~mpalmer/blog/images/the_usual_suspects.png" alt="The lineup scene from the movie The Usual Suspects">
<figcaption>
  They're called The Usual Suspects for a reason, but sometimes, it really <b>is</b> Keyser Söze
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Eventually, after more than a little debugging, we discovered that, somehow, there were two users with keys that had the same key fingerprint.
This <em>absolutely</em> shouldn’t happen – it’s a bit like winning the lottery twice in a row<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="https://www.hezmatt.org/~mpalmer/blog/#fn:1">1</a></sup> – unless the users had somehow shared their keys with each other, of course.
Still, it was worth investigating, just in case it was a web application bug, so the GitHub team reached out to the users impacted, to try and figure out what was going on.</p>

<p>The users professed no knowledge of each other, neither admitted to publicising their key, and couldn’t offer any explanation as to how the other person could possibly have gotten their key.</p>

<p>Then things went from “weird” to “what the…?”.
Because <em>another</em> pair of users showed up, sharing a key fingerprint – but it was a <em>different</em> shared key fingerprint.
The odds now have gone from “winning the lottery multiple times in a row” to as close to “this literally cannot happen” as makes no difference.</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://www.hezmatt.org/~mpalmer/blog/images/were_through_the_looking_glass.jpg" alt="Milhouse from The Simpsons says that We're Through The Looking Glass Here, People">
</figure>

<p>Once we were really, <em>really</em> confident that the OpenSSH patch wasn’t the cause of the problem, my involvement in the problem basically ended.
I wasn’t a GitHub employee, and EY had plenty of other customers who needed my help, so I wasn’t able to stay deeply involved in the on-going investigation of The Mystery of the Duplicate Keys.</p>

<p>However, the GitHub team did keep talking to the users involved, and managed to determine the only apparent common factor was that all the users claimed to be using Debian or Ubuntu systems, which was where their SSH keys would have been generated.</p>

<p>That was as far as the investigation had really goten, when along came May 13, 2008.</p>

<h2 id="chekovs-gun-goes-off">Chekov’s Gun Goes Off</h2>

<p>With the publication of <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/DSA-1571-1">DSA-1571-1</a>, everything suddenly became clear.
Through a well-meaning but ultimately disasterous cleanup of OpenSSL’s randomness generation code, the Debian maintainer had inadvertently reduced the number of possible keys that could be generated by a given user from “bazillions” to a little over 32,000.
With so many people signing up to GitHub – some of them no doubt following best practice and freshly generating a separate key – it’s unsurprising that some collisions occurred.</p>

<p>You can imagine the sense of “oooooooh, so <em>that’s</em> what’s going on!” that rippled out once the issue was understood.
I was mostly glad that we had conclusive evidence that my OpenSSH patch wasn’t at fault, little knowing how much more contact I was to have with Debian weak keys in the future, running <a href="https://pwnedkeys.com/">a huge store of known-compromised keys</a> and using them to find <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1620772">misbehaving Certificate Authorities</a>, amongst other things.</p>

<h2 id="lessons-learned">Lessons Learned</h2>

<p>While I’ve not found a description of exactly when and how Luciano Bello discovered the vulnerability that became CVE-2008-0166, I presume he first came across it some time before it was disclosed – likely before GitHub tripped over it.
The stable Debian release that included the vulnerable code had been released a year earlier, so there was plenty of time for Luciano to have discovered key collisions and go “hmm, I wonder what’s going on here?”, then keep digging until the solution presented itself.</p>

<p>The thought “hmm, that’s odd”, followed by intense investigation, leading to the discovery of a major flaw is also what ultimately brought down the recent XZ backdoor.
The critical part of that sequence is the ability to <em>do</em> that intense investigation, though.</p>

<p>When I reflect on my brush with the Debian weak keys vulnerability, what sticks out to me is the fact that I <em>didn’t</em> do the deep investigation.
I wonder if Luciano hadn’t found it, how long it might have been before it was found.
The GitHub team would have continued investigating, presumably, and perhaps they (or I) would have eventually dug deep enough to find it.
But we were all super busy – myself, working support tickets at EY, and GitHub feverishly building features and fighting the fires in their rapidly-growing service.</p>

<p>As it was, Luciano <em>was</em> able to take the time to dig in and find out what was happening, but just like the XZ backdoor, I feel like we, as an industry, got a bit lucky that someone with the skills, time, and energy was on hand at the right time to make a huge difference.</p>

<p>It’s a luxury to be able to take the time to really dig into a problem, and it’s a luxury that most of us rarely have.
Perhaps an understated takeaway is that somehow we all need to wrestle back some time to follow our hunches and really dig into the things that make us go “hmm…”.</p>

TSAC is an audio compression utility reaching very low bitrates such
as 5.5 kb/s for mono or 7.5 kb/s for stereo at 44.1 kHz with a good
perceptual quality. Hence TSAC compresses a 3.5 minute stereo song to
a file of 192 KiB.

An Nvidia GPU is necessary for fast operation. CPU only is also
supported but slower.

<h2>Technical information</h2>
<ul>
  <li><code>tsac</code> is based on a modified version of
    the <a href="https://github.com/descriptinc/descript-audio-codec">Descript
      Audio Codec</a> extended for stereo and a Transformer model to further
    increase the compression ratio. Both models are quantized to 8 bits
    per parameter.</li>
  <li>The Transformer model is evaluated in a deterministic and
    reproducible way. Hence the result does not depend on the exact
    GPU or CPU model nor on the number of configured threads. This key
    point ensures that a compressed file can be decompressed using a
    different hardware or software configuration.</li>

The massive adoption of both open and closed AI models means that AI capabilities have leapfrogged our ability to understand how they are created. Releasing the OLMo framework will provide the industry with an opportunity to understand what is going on inside AI models.</p><p id="fdbf">Today, <a href="https://allenai.org/olmo" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">The Allen Institute for AI (AI2) </a>has released <a href="https://huggingface.co/allenai/OLMo-7B" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">OLMo 7B</a>, a truly open, state-of-the-art large language model released alongside the pre-training data and training code. This empowers researchers and developers to use the best <em>and</em> open models to advance the science of language models collectively.</p><blockquote><p id="c46e">“Open foundation models have been critical in driving a burst of innovation and development around generative AI,” said Yann LeCun, Chief AI Scientist at Meta. “The vibrant community that comes from open source is the fastest and most effective way to build the future of AI.”</p></blockquote><p id="05f0">OLMo and the framework is designed to aid researchers in training and experimenting with large language models.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text"><p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">llm.c</h2><a id="user-content-llmc" aria-label="Permalink: llm.c" href="#llmc"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">LLM training in simple, pure C/CUDA. There is no need for 245MB of PyTorch or 107MB of cPython. For example, training GPT-2 (CPU, fp32) is ~1,000 lines of clean code in a single file. It compiles and runs instantly, and exactly matches the PyTorch reference implementation. I chose GPT-2 as the first working example because it is the grand-daddy of LLMs, the first time the modern stack was put together.</p>
<p dir="auto">Currently, I am working on:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>direct CUDA implementation, which will be significantly faster and probably come close to PyTorch.</li>
<li>speed up the CPU version with SIMD instructions, AVX2 on x86 / NEON on ARM (e.g. Apple Silicon).</li>
<li>more modern architectures, e.g. Llama2, Gemma, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">For the repo, I'd like to maintain both clean, simple reference implementations alongside a also lot more optimized versions that can come close to PyTorch, but in a tiny fraction of the code and dependencies.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">quick start</h2><a id="user-content-quick-start" aria-label="Permalink: quick start" href="#quick-start"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Download and tokenize a dataset. The <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karpathy/char-rnn/master/data/tinyshakespeare/input.txt" rel="nofollow">tinyshakespeare</a> dataset is the fastest to download and tokenize:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="python prepro_tinyshakespeare.py"><pre>python prepro_tinyshakespeare.py</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">This prints:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="Saved 32768 tokens to data/tiny_shakespeare_val.bin
Saved 305260 tokens to data/tiny_shakespeare_train.bin"><pre><code>Saved 32768 tokens to data/tiny_shakespeare_val.bin
Saved 305260 tokens to data/tiny_shakespeare_train.bin
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">The .bin files are raw byte streams of int32 numbers indicating the token ids with the GPT-2 tokenizer. Alternatively you could also tokenize the <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/roneneldan/TinyStories" rel="nofollow">TinyStories</a> dataset with <code>prepro_tinystories.py</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">In principle we'd be ready to the train the model right here. However the baseline CPU/fp32 reference code is so inefficient that it's not practical to train these models from scratch yet. Instead, we initialize with the GPT-2 weights released by OpenAI and just do finetuning. For that, we have to download the GPT-2 weights and save them as a checkpoint we can load in C:</p>

<p dir="auto">You'll recognize this code from nanoGPT as a simple GPT-2 reference implementation in PyTorch. This script will download the GPT-2 (124M) model, overfit a single batch of data for 10 iterations, run a few steps of generation, and most importantly it will save two files: 1) the <code>gpt2_124M.bin</code> file that contains the raw model weights for loading in C, and <code>gpt2_124M_debug_state.bin</code>, which also contains more debug state: the inputs, targets, logits and loss. This is very useful for debugging C code, for unit testing, and making sure we're exactly matching the PyTorch reference implementation. For now all we care about are the model weights in <code>gpt2_124M.bin</code>. We can now initialize with them and train in raw C. First compile the code:</p>

<p dir="auto">You can have a look inside the <code>Makefile</code> and its comments. It will try to autodetect if OpenMP is available on your system, which is very helpful for speeding up the code at very low cost of code complexity. Once <code>train_gpt2</code> is compiled, you can run it:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="OMP_NUM_THREADS=8 ./train_gpt2"><pre>OMP_NUM_THREADS=8 ./train_gpt2</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">You should tune the number of threads depending on how many cores your CPU has. The program will load the model weights, the tokens, it will run a finetuning loop for a few iterations with Adam lr 1e-4, and then generate a sample from the model. The file is (I think) very readable and you should have a look. Simply, there are implementations for the forward and backward pass of all the layers, and they get strung together into a large, manual, forward/backward/update loop. The output looks like this on my MacBook Pro (Apple Silicon M3 Max):</p>

<p dir="auto">Working on Shorebird requires Dart.</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>./scripts/bootstrap.sh</code> will run <code>pub get</code> all packages in the repository.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Running tests</h3><a id="user-content-running-tests" aria-label="Permalink: Running tests" href="#running-tests"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">We don't yet have a script to run tests locally. For now, we recommend using
<code>very_good test -r</code> in the packages directory to run all shorebird tests.</p>
<p dir="auto">(If you run it in the root, it will find packages in bin/cache/flutter and try
to run tests there, some of which will fail.)</p>
<p dir="auto">To generate a coverage report install <code>lcov</code>:</p>

<p dir="auto">Then run tests with the <code>--coverage</code> flag:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="very_good test -r --coverage
genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage"><pre><code>very_good test -r --coverage
genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage
</code></pre></div>

<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Tracking coverage</h3><a id="user-content-tracking-coverage" aria-label="Permalink: Tracking coverage" href="#tracking-coverage"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The following command will generate a coverage report for the Dart packages:</p>

But moves that deviated from what the AI would do also improved, and these “human moves” accounted for 60 percent of the improvement.</span></p><p>My guess is that AlphaGo’s success forced the humans to reevaluate certain moves and abandon weak heuristics.

Until Roger Bannister ran the 4-minute mile, the best runners clustered just above 4 minutes for decades. A few months later Bannister was no longer the only runner to do a 4-minute mile.

Now it is standard repertoire at concert houses.</p><p>The recent development in Go suggests that superhuman AI systems can have this effect, too. They can prove something is possible and lift people up. This doesn’t mean that AI systems will not displace humans at many tasks, and it doesn’t mean that humans can always adapt to keep up with the systems—in fact, the human Go players are not keeping up. But the flourishing of creativity and skills tells us something about what might happen at the tail end of the human skill distribution when more AI systems come online.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

		
		
<p>As a child, I’d creep down the basement stairs and watch him: hunched over a table, a single lamp lighting his work. First he’d carve a walnut-sized body out of wood. Then he’d take a tiny brush and paint the figure in bright reds and greens and blues, wrap embroidery thread around its spindly wire legs, and top the whole thing with a shiny lacquer. On the back, he’d add a clasp and sign his name in <em>katakana</em>.&nbsp;





</p><p>The end result: a bird pin so delicate it could fit into the palm of my 8-year-old hand. My grandfather, whom I called <em>jichan</em>, made hundreds of these bird pins over the course of his retirement. I always thought they were unique to him. But in recent years, I’ve learned that he was part of something much larger.&nbsp;





</p><p>It all began in February 1942, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued <a href="https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/executive-order-9066">Executive Order 9066</a>, which led to the expulsion and incarceration of roughly 122,000 Japanese Americans. Many were given just 48 hours to pack, forcing them to sell their houses, farms, businesses and possessions at rock-bottom prices —&nbsp;ultimately costing them more than an estimated $12 billion in lost property and income, in today’s dollars.&nbsp;




</p>


<p>Carrying suitcases full of clothes and little else, most “evacuees” were sent to 10 War Relocation Authority camps in remote parts of Wyoming, California, Utah, Arizona, Colorado, Idaho and Arkansas. Others were brought to lesser-known camps throughout the country, including in Alaska, Montana, New Mexico and Hawai’i.&nbsp;





</p><p>My jichan was sent from his home in California to Poston, in the Arizona desert, the <a href="https://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/active_learning/explorations/japanese_internment/camps.cfm">second-largest camp</a> by population. At its peak, Poston held nearly 18,000 men, women and children of Japanese descent, including more than a dozen members of my family.&nbsp;





</p><blockquote>
<p>I always thought they were unique to him. But in recent years, I’ve learned that he was part of something much larger.


</p></blockquote>



<p>Since the camp barracks and grounds were <a href="https://www.npr.org/2010/05/12/126557553/the-creative-art-of-coping-in-japanese-internment">nearly empty</a> when they arrived, the incarcerated people spent their early days making their surroundings habitable: building furniture, carving clothes hangers, planting gardens, opening schools. They also took jobs, initially for no pay. Each camp eventually had a hospital, newspaper, mess hall, dry goods store and police and fire department, so many found ways to continue their careers as doctors, journalists, teachers or farmers. By the end of 1943, <a href="https://dp.la/exhibitions/japanese-internment/employment/farming_agriculture">85% of the vegetables</a> eaten in the camps came from within them.





</p><p>People sought out more leisurely distractions, too. “Stuck in that one-square-mile area, it was like, how do you entertain yourself, how do you keep your sanity?” said Delphine Hirasuna, the author of <em>The Art of Gaman, </em>a <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/198042/the-art-of-gaman-by-delphine-hirasuna/">book about the arts and crafts of Japanese incarceration</a>. In addition to forming sports leagues, they taught each other pursuits like flower arranging, doll making, sewing and quilting. “If somebody had a particular skill,” Hirasuna said, “the other people who were stuck in camp would say, ‘Could you teach me?’”&nbsp;





</p><p>In Poston, Roy Takahashi, who’d been an <a href="https://digitalassets.lib.berkeley.edu/jarda/ucb/text/cubanc_35_1_00259342ta.pdf">art student</a> prior to the war, offered a bird-carving class in <a href="https://www.loc.gov/resource/sn83025333/1944-09-05/ed-1/?sp=4&amp;q=%22bird+carving%22&amp;r=-0.711,0.319,2.422,1.268,0">September 1944</a>. Within two weeks, the camp newspaper, the <em>Poston Chronicle</em>, <a href="https://www.loc.gov/resource/sn83025333/1944-09-14/ed-1/?sp=3&amp;q=%22bird+carving%22&amp;r=-0.109,0.973,0.967,0.506,0">declared that</a> “bird carving seems to be one of the most popular pastimes now.” Archival records suggest that Takahashi offered several <a href="https://www.loc.gov/resource/sn83025333/1944-10-05/ed-1/?sp=3&amp;q=%22bird+carving%22&amp;r=0.168,1.083,0.988,0.517,0">more</a> <a href="http://digitalcollections.archives.csudh.edu/digital/collection/p16855coll4/id/38007/rec/11">sessions</a> to meet the demand.&nbsp;

<p>One reason the bird pins were so popular, Hirasuna said, is they didn’t require a lot of materials. Many of the people at camp had knives they’d fashioned out of scrap metal,&nbsp; and paint could be ordered fairly easily from a Sears catalog. For the birds’ bodies, they salvaged scraps of wood from delivery crates; for the legs and feet, they used wire from window screens.&nbsp;





</p><p>They created all manner of birds:&nbsp;My jichan’s repertoire included cranes, wood ducks, road runners, pheasants, eagles — even a toucan. They reportedly used an Audubon field guide for inspiration, as well as copies of <em>National Geographic</em>, which was “deluged” with orders for back issues, according to Allen H. Eaton’s 1952 book <em><a href="https://archive.org/stream/dli.ernet.28835/28835-Beauty%20Behind%20Barbed%20Wire%20(1952)_djvu.txt">Beauty Behind Barbed Wire</a></em>. And, though bird carving spread to many other camps, perhaps through letters and packages sent between them, Eaton wrote that Poston “outnumbered all others in the quantity and quality of carved and painted American birds.”&nbsp;





</p><p>Carol Takahashi (no relation to Roy Takahashi) said her grandparents took one of the bird-carving classes offered at Poston. For them, Takahashi said, the pins served as a form of currency: “I know my grandparents traded some of the early bird pins with other ladies for diapers and stuff like that.”&nbsp;





</p><p>Then, after the war, Takahashi’s grandparents were unable to find work. “Nobody wanted to hire Japanese,” she said. So they turned to the skill they had learned in camp, and made and sold bird pins for the next 40 years. Over time, they became the craft’s <a href="http://www.takahashibirds.com/place_in_history.html">most famous makers</a>; their pins received write-ups in the media and permanent spots in several museums. “They made the best of what they could with the situation,” Takahashi said, noting that the bird pins funded her grandparents’ retirement and their four children’s college educations.&nbsp;




</p>


<p>Kristen Hayashi, the director of collections management and access at the <a href="https://www.janm.org/">Japanese American National Museum</a> in Los Angeles, said the bird pins are “very iconic to the camp experience,” and one of the most common donations the museum receives.





</p><p>“Maybe we’re imbuing a lot of meaning onto it, but it seems very poignant that a lot of these incarcerees were recreating birds,” Hayashi said. “Just the symbolism of birds having the freedom to fly and kind of go wherever they want to —&nbsp;something they weren’t able to do incarcerated behind barbed wire.”&nbsp;





</p><p>My jichan eventually moved back to California, where he worked at a newspaper printing press and as a grocery clerk, among other jobs. In retirement, he returned to making bird pins, which my aunts and I sold at markets on both coasts.





</p><blockquote>
<p>“Just the symbolism of birds having the freedom to fly and kind of go wherever they want to —&nbsp;something they weren’t able to do incarcerated behind barbed wire.”&nbsp;


</p></blockquote>



<p>I know my jichan’s pins are still out there, as they occasionally pop up on Etsy or eBay, complete with his signature. I’m sure that many more, from many other former incarcerees, are hidden in basements or attics or jewelry boxes. When people hold these pins in their hands, I hope they see what I do: not a story of suffering, but a story of resilience —&nbsp;of finding beauty, even in the rawest places.

        <p data-block-key="g4c3e">Today, the all-new Find My Device is rolling out to Android devices around the world, starting in the U.S. and Canada. With a new, crowdsourced network of over a billion Android devices, Find My Device can help you find your misplaced Android devices and everyday items quickly and securely. Here are five ways you can try it out.</p>

Locate offline devices</h2><p data-block-key="1hpqn">Locate your compatible Android phone and tablet by ringing them or viewing their location on a map in the app — even when they’re offline. And thanks to specialized Pixel hardware, Pixel 8 and 8 Pro owners will also be able to find their devices if they’re powered off or the battery is dead.</p></div>

Keep track of everyday items with compatible Bluetooth tags</h2><p data-block-key="dl4c6">Starting in May, you’ll be able to locate everyday items like your keys, wallet or luggage with Bluetooth tracker tags from <a href="https://chipolo.net/en-us/products/category/chipolo-point" rt-link-type="external">Chipolo</a> and <a href="https://pebblebee.com/pages/google-find-my-device" rt-link-type="external">Pebblebee</a> in the Find My Device app. These tags, built specifically for the Find My Device network, will be compatible with <a href="https://blog.google/products/android/unknown-tracker-alert-google-android/" rt-link-type="external">unknown tracker alerts across Android</a> and iOS to help protect you from unwanted tracking. Keep an eye out later this year for additional Bluetooth tags from eufy, Jio, Motorola and more.</p></div>

    <p><em>If history is written by the victors, Lore Harp McGovern should have volumes devoted to her contributions to the personal computing industry. In the mid-1970s, from her suburban California home, Harp McGovern—a housewife and mother of two—began assembling memory boards and other computer expansions to sell to the growing hobbyist and business markets. With her friend Carole Ely, she grew their company, Vector Graphic, into a major manufacturer of microcomputers, eventually taking it public before before Big Blue—IBM—muscled into the market. In the latest installment of his column The Crazy Ones, </em><strong><em>Gareth Edwards</em></strong><em> tells the untold story of one of the last remaining original founders of Silicon Valley.—</em><a href="https://every.to/news/kate-lee-joins-every-as-editor-in-chief" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Kate Lee</em></a></p><hr><p>London. 1981. A young, smartly dressed woman watches from the sidelines as a stage is prepared. Everyone is there to hear about a hotly anticipated IPO out of Silicon Valley. An investor approaches the woman and asks for a coffee refill from the table behind her. Her train of thought broken, she looks up at him. For a second, she holds his gaze. Then she turns and pours him a coffee. A few minutes later, the host announces that the CEO is ready to speak.</p><p>Tucking her short brown hair behind her ears, the same young woman straightens her suit and walks confidently up onto the stage. A murmur of surprise spreads across the room, which soon gives way to polite applause. She nods in acknowledgement, her eyes scanning the audience, searching.</p><p>“My name is Lore Harp, CEO and founder of Vector Graphic,” she says, her accent a mix of German and Californian. She locks eyes with the investor who asked her to refill his cup. “Sir, do you need me to get you any more coffee?”</p><p>The crowd looks at the embarrassed investor. He shakes his head.</p><p>“Good,” Lore Harp says with a thin smile. “Let’s continue, then, shall we?”</p><p>This is the story of Lore Harp McGovern, founder of Vector Graphic. With her friend Carole Ely, she launched a multi-million-dollar computer company from her suburban home and became one of the most important founders of the microcomputer age. It is based on contemporary accounts in publications such as the <em>Harvard Business Review, Interface Age, Kilobaud, Time, </em>and the <em>Los Angeles Times</em>, as well as books such as <em>Women, Technology and Power </em>by Marguerite Zientara; <em>Future Rich</em> by Jacqueline Thompson; and <em>The Untold Story of the Computer Revolution </em>by G.H. Stine. It is also based on the words of Lore Harp McGovern herself.</p><h2><strong>‘You can do anything you want’</strong></h2><p>Like many of Silicon Valley’s pioneers, Harp was an immigrant. Born Lore Lange-Hegermann, she grew up in Bottrop, Germany amid World War II, where she shared a bombed-out building with her parents and grandfather, Hermann Lange-Hegermann.</p><p>Lange-Hegermann had been a businessman and politician during the pre-war Weimar Republic, but the rise of Hitler and the war had cost him his political career and much of his business empire. He believed in the importance of a proper education for all of his children and grandchildren, regardless of gender. As a result, Lore grew up watching her aunt become a successful lawyer and her father take over what remained of her grandfather’s businesses.</p><p>Lore’s grandfather was her biggest influence. “I remember, as a seven-year-old, getting a little book from him,” she recalled later in an interview with the Computer History Museum. “In my child’s mind’s eye, it was gigantic. And it was a photographic book of people from all over the world in their native costumes, their traditions and all this. And I was so enthused about the book that I said, ‘I will see all these people!’”</p><p>“You can do anything you want,” her grandfather responded.</p><p>What her family hadn’t entirely grasped was just how determined Lore was to achieve this goal. Smart and observant, it hadn’t taken long for her to spot that reality didn’t always match the ideal. Her mother was a talented photographer and had studied the subject in college, but society expected her to become a housewife, which she did. So while Lore studied hard, she also watched for an opportunity to do something different. In February 1964, one of her friends pulled out of a planned six-month exchange visit with an American family. It was the opportunity Lore had been waiting for. She went instead.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>A land of opportunity</strong></h2><p>On February 8, 1964, Lore Lange-Hegermann arrived in Santa Cruz, California. She was 19 years old and had promised her family that she would only stay for six months.</p><p>Six months later, to her parents’ surprise and disappointment, Lore sold her return ticket to West Germany and hitchhiked to Mexico. After that, she headed to San Francisco. When her tourist visa expired, she became undocumented, unable to officially work. She crashed in a shared house with four other women and took off-the-books jobs to pay rent and survive, while immersing herself in the growing sixties counterculture.</p><p>During this time, she met Bob Harp. Bob was a young computing researcher and engineer whose talents had secured him a well-paid role at a prestigious research institute in Germany. On his return to the U.S., his path crossed with Lore’s. She was attending a friend’s party when a British sports car roared up outside. It was Bob.</p><p>Bob was as outgoing as he was brilliant, and the two soon fell into conversation. The fact that Bob had broader horizons than most of his peers and spoke fluent German, thanks to his time in Europe, also helped. He made an instant impression on Lore, and she on him. It wasn’t long before they began dating and fell in love. When he was offered a research job at the California Institute of Technology, she agreed to go with him. For the next year, the pair enjoyed living a bohemian life in Los Angeles, until the inevitable happened—immigration services caught up with Lore. Threatened with deportation and summoned to an interview, the couple hatched a plan.</p><p>“I put on my little black shift dress,” Lore later said. “My hair was down. I put it in a big bun. I put on my pearl necklace, my father’s gold bracelet, my grandmother’s ring. I sat there like Miss Prim and Proper. And we said, ‘Oh, we just got engaged, and we’re getting married.’”</p><p>And they did. Lore Lange-Hegermann became Lore Harp. “We found some minister in our neighborhood, and then we went to McDonald’s and had a hamburger.”</p><h2><strong>The gilded cage</strong></h2><p>While Bob had worked at Caltech, Lore was able to immerse herself in the flourishing local art community. But over time the gears of his career began to turn. In the early seventies, Bob was offered a better-paid aeronautical research role at Hughes Research Laboratories, which he accepted. For Harp, this meant leaving vibrant Los Angeles for a more traditional suburban life in Westlake Village, California. “We moved from there to way out in the boonies,” Harp recalled. “Westlake Village which is…oh my God.”</p><p>By 1975, this lifestyle had begun to take a toll on her mental health. Harp had stayed in America to escape a future where her only option was to be a housewife.Yet in Westlake Village, this was the only role it seemed possible for her to play. While Bob worked, she was required to manage the home and join the various women’s groups and their activities like charity fundraisers and dinner parties—obligations expected by her community and Bob’s employer. To try and prevent this from taking over her whole life, she started studying anthropology. But then she became pregnant with their first child and was forced to abandon her studies. A second—another daughter—followed two years later. When the children were three and five, Harp tried to pursue school again, this time hoping to follow in her aunt’s footsteps and become a lawyer. But law school was not friendly to young mothers.&nbsp;</p><p>“My husband was not the kind of person who would take over half the chores while I studied, even though he was otherwise supportive,” she said. Forced to quit, Harp felt frustrated and isolated. The social activities that seemed to provide a sense of value and purpose for many of her neighbors just didn’t feel satisfying for her.</p><p>“I was 32 at the time, and I felt…‘My God, suddenly I’ll be 40, the children will be gone, and where am I going to be?'”&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>The product</strong></h2><p>Harp first met Carole Ely while they were waiting to pick up their children from school. Ely had started a promising career as a bond trader when marriage and children intervened. Now, like Harp, she was stuck living the life of a Westlake Village housewife. She, too, felt caged.</p><p>The duo talked about starting a business together. Their first idea was a travel agency. However, the travel industry in California was one of entrenched interests—when it came to securing partnerships and permits, who you knew mattered just as much as how good your product was. Networking required membership of the kind of business and social clubs that would never allow two women like Harp and Ely to join.</p><p>Then, in January 1975, <em>Popular Electronics </em>published a picture of the <a href="https://every.to/the-crazy-ones/the-secret-father-of-modern-computing" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Altair 8800</a> on its cover. Bob Harp, like many who worked with large computers in their workplace, had never imagined that he might one day own a machine of his own. He placed an order for the Altair, which was billed as the world’s first mass-market “microcomputer.” When the machine arrived in kit form, Bob quickly assembled it and it became one of his obsessions. The Harp house was soon filled with pamphlets, newsletters, and how-to guides about microcomputers, and Bob discovered, to his delight, that the Altair’s creator Ed Roberts had built it around a principle of “open architecture” via its S-100 expansion socket. Anyone could create memory boards or peripherals that could expand the functionality of the machine . A few third-party expansions were already on the market and more were being released regularly, but Bob decided it would be more interesting (and a fun test of his skills) to design his own expansion board. Over the course of a few months, he created a board for his own use, one that would double the amount of RAM in his Altair from 4K to a mighty 8K.</p><p>While Bob was at work, Harp would read the computing materials that littered the house. Dinner table conversations would routinely include discussion of the latest trends in technology. Through a form of osmosis, she became versed in the growing computer industry herself. “[Bob] was reading tech publications all the time, and I kind of read them as well, and looked at them, and saw what was going on,” she said.</p><p>Harp decided that Bob’s 8K RAM board was the opportunity that she and Ely had been waiting for. They would make and sell them from home. In return, Bob would receive a royalty payment on every sale. She called her prospective business partner and asked her if she wanted to team up and sell memory boards.</p><p>“Sure,” Ely replied. “What’s a memory board?”</p><p>Two days after that phone call, Lore Harp and Ely attended the Southern California Computer Society’s monthly show. They were there to scout out their potential market. They watched vendors try to sell bags of chips and parts for memory boards and other expansions, often with poorly composed hand-written instructions on how to build them. The whole operation seemed distinctly amateur, yet it seemed to work. Attendees would hand over bundles of money—sometimes as much as $1,000 (about $5,000 today)—in exchange for these products.</p><p>Two days later, on August 23, 1976, Vector Graphic was incorporated. Its head of marketing was Carole Ely. Lore Harp was the CEO.</p><p><strong><a href="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/3030/optimized_P3I9vJOqpHx-NNqFeebVsxGCtY1LkjgN8Jm9jKXPsiWuVOOs-A7H3R0c0KYgyFpF2Pn6SCyRc6xL_EffIA5HEH0L6V6m4udVqFylwjx78SMVcNARJng7sYqCBeP3lFBPL_MpvieYeWFs130TSTQ8ew.png?link=true" target="_blank"><img src="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/3030/optimized_P3I9vJOqpHx-NNqFeebVsxGCtY1LkjgN8Jm9jKXPsiWuVOOs-A7H3R0c0KYgyFpF2Pn6SCyRc6xL_EffIA5HEH0L6V6m4udVqFylwjx78SMVcNARJng7sYqCBeP3lFBPL_MpvieYeWFs130TSTQ8ew.png"></a></strong></p><p><em>Carole Ely (left) and Lore Harp. Source: Vector Graphic.</em></p><h2><strong>The deal</strong></h2><p>“It’s Lore Harp from Vector Graphic. We have a new memory board and need about 50,000 chips.”&nbsp;</p><p>Harp was seated in the family room of her Westlake home on the phone with a sales representative at chip manufacturer AMD. The company was one of a small number of independent U.S. chip manufacturers that were prepared to supply third parties. Harp and Ely needed these chips so they could package them into kits in Harp’s house and sell them as memory board kits.</p><p>“Oh!” The sales representative on the other end of the phone sounded keen. “I’d be happy to come to your office to discuss it.” Harp looked around the room and across to the kitchen beyond, where a large pot of stew was cooking on the stove.&nbsp;</p><p>“We’d love to meet you in our office, but we’re in the middle of moving,” she replied, thinking on her feet. Harp told the representative they were in Westlake and suggested they meet at the Westlake Inn. The sales representative agreed. After calling Carole and telling her the news, Harp called Bob at work.</p><p>“You’ve got to get home from Hughes,” she told him. “You’ve got to be here at a quarter to five to care for the kids. We have to go meet a guy from AMD.”</p><p>The memory of that first meeting was seared into Harp’s brain. “He had these little monogrammed cufflinks and that aftershave everybody had. Some Old Spice thing,” she remembered about the salesman later. “And he gave us this up-and-down look. I never forget this.”</p><p>The three of them sat down in the hotel’s restaurant area and tried to negotiate a deal. Harp told the man from AMD that they planned to manufacture memory boards and sell them to the growing hobbyist market. The salesman nodded along, then gave them a price. It was far too high. “He didn’t even know what an Altair was,” Harp said. As a result, he didn’t believe their assertions that there was a large enough market for their product to make a discount worthwhile. They refused AMD’s terms.</p><p>Not to be deterred, Harp called Fairchild Semiconductor, another major chip manufacturer. Once again, it led to a meeting at the Westlake Inn.</p><p>“You know what,” the Fairchild representative replied after Harp had explained their plan. “I’ll help you.”</p><p>Now Harp took her biggest gamble. They didn’t have enough money to pre-pay for the chips, so she decided to be honest.</p><p>“We will pay within 30 days because we cannot afford to prepay,” she told him. Harp knew that they’d need to sell enough boards first to cover the cost. “We promise we’ll pay in 30 days or before.”</p><p>The Fairchild man was silent. Then he laughed. “You know what? I trust you.”</p><p>They shook hands and went their separate ways. A few weeks later, there was a knock on the Harp family door. When Lore opened it, a man named Dick Kirkpatrick introduced himself. He explained that he was their Fairchild distributor and pointed to the boxes of chips in the back of his rental car. Harp helped him carry the boxes into the back bedroom that they had begun converting into an assembly space.</p><h2><strong>The sell</strong></h2><p>Stan Veit had just opened up his computer store one autumn morning in New York when the phone rang. It was a woman calling from California. She wanted to sell him some memory boards.</p><p>“I listened because a woman selling computer equipment was indeed a novelty,” he wrote later. “After speaking with her, I found out that her name was Lore Harp.”</p><p>Veit didn’t know it, but he was about to be subject to a sales pitch created by Carole Ely to make Vector stand out.</p><p>Harp told Veit that the Vector boards were not only superior to anything else on the market—they were cheaper as well. She made Veit a simple offer.</p><p>“She would ship me two boards, and if I liked them, I would call her and she would ship me six more and I would pay cash on delivery for the six,” Veit recalled. “If I didn’t want them I just had to send her boards back. Well, that seemed like a fair offer, so I agreed.” When the boards arrived, they were as good as Harp had claimed.&nbsp;</p><p>Veit made the call. “Thus, I became a dealer for Vector Graphic, a company run by two women,” <a href="https://archive.org/details/stan-veits-history-of-the-personal-computer/page/218/mode/2up" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">he wrote later</a>.</p><p>Veit wasn’t the only one. Harp and Ely systematically went through computer hobbyist magazines like <em>Byte </em>and <em>Interface Age</em>, which were full of advertisements from dealers like Veit. It was from these computer dealers that most hobbyists purchased their microcomputers and parts, so the Vector Graphic team targeted them aggressively. They would call them and pitch the same arrangement that they had offered Veit. By October 1976, orders were flooding in. Harp and Ely’s product wasn’t revolutionary, nor were their boards significantly cheaper than their rivals, but their approach to the process of sales and ordering was more professional. This also extended to the board kits themselves. The pair hadn’t forgotten the poor-quality instructions and packaging they’d seen at computer fairs when starting out. They put extra effort into making sure that the packaging for their own boards was of a high quality, providing clear instructions for assembly, and even color-coded their chips. Overall, Vector’s commitment to high standards made them stand out.</p><p>By the end of the year, they were almost overwhelmed with orders for their memory boards, with demand starting to exceed the number of kits the two women could assemble themselves at Harp’s home. They were also attracting neighborhood attention. It was hard not to. Every weekday morning, Bob Harp would depart for work and Lore would take the children to school. Shortly after, Lore would return home and Ely would knock on her door.</p><p>The rest of the day would see a steady stream of men in suits visiting the house. A short while later, they would leave. It would stop when Lore left to pick up the children and Bob got home. The men were computer parts dealers, but the neighbors didn’t know that.</p><p>“I think our neighbors thought we had a brothel going,” Harp said.</p><p>Eventually Harp’s next-door neighbor, Jean, grew too curious to remain silent. She knocked on the door and asked what they were up to. Harp invited her in. Jean was stunned by the operation. The rear bedroom and family room of Harp’s house had been converted into a production line for memory boards and board kits. Boxes of chips and parts were stacked on the floor, while the table was covered in fruit bowls into which the correct chips for each board had been carefully sorted, ready to be packaged. In the kitchen, salesmen helped themselves to coffee while discussing orders with the women. Toward the end of the afternoon, local high school students would arrive, paid by Harp and Ely to help with packaging and distribution. Watching, Jean admitted she had never had a job, although she had always wanted one. After a brief discussion, Harp and Ely told Jean that they were expanding and offered her a job as their receptionist. She became one of their first full-time employees. Forty years later, Harp would still vividly recall the joy of giving Jean her first ever paycheck.</p><p>“It…it was just great,” Harp said, a smile on her face.</p><p>By December 1976, Harp and Ely had built Vector Graphic into a million-dollar company. In 1977, Harp decided they should go one step further: They should release a desktop microcomputer themselves. This would go from a company oriented around building add-ons for other company’s machines to making machines themselves.</p><h2><strong>The Vector 1</strong></h2><p>Harp persuaded Bob to leave his job at Hughes and join Vector Graphic full time. Harp and Ely had already employed a number of engineers to design parts, but building a computer would require someone to manage them and create an overarching design. Bob possessed the right skills and vision to do this.</p><p>The type of computer the company would build was determined by a growing demand for business machines that had been identified by their dealer network. The pair had a reputation for treating the dealers that sold Vector products fairly, so they were happy to be regularly canvassed for their opinion on what products would sell. Vector had an advantage over its competitors when it came to market intelligence. Vector’s dealers reported that their clientele was expanding. The hobbyist market was still the primary driver for sales of first-generation computers like the Altair, but small-to-medium-sized businesses were becoming interested in owning a microcomputer to use for word processing, accounting, and other business-related tasks. Unlike the hobbyists, they were often leaving stores empty-handed.</p><p>This wasn’t due to fears over price—quite the opposite. These buyers were prepared to pay more than $3,000 (roughly $16,000 today) for the right machine coupled with the right hardware add-ons or business software. It was that they wanted a microcomputer that was reliable, powerful, expandable, and pre-built—unlike hobbyists, most businesses had no desire to assemble their own machines from a kit. It also wouldn’t hurt if it was something that could serve as an office centerpiece around important clients. A machine that ticked all these boxes didn’t yet exist. The market was machines like the Altair or Apple at the low end or expensive, room-sized computers by IBM or others at the high end. There was nothing in between, so Vector decided to fill that gap.</p><p>At the 1977 West Coast Computer Faire, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak set the home computer world abuzz with the announcement of the Apple II, a pre-built machine for home users. Just a few booths down, Lore Harp and Carole Ely did the same thing for businesses with the announcement of the Vector 1, designed by Bob Harp. In terms of CPU and RAM, it wasn’t anything special, launching with the same specifications as the Altair 8800. What differentiated it was that it could be easily expanded—well beyond the limits of the Altair. It also came pre-built.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/3030/optimized_1imEIsNaUtLoWzA53tJegncGKXXr1E11Xdzsd5E2SFTCdplx6an4HqGQa-W7tv8JQJzYbsEu6xsS9x5bfuHRdB0QDgdU5m1IY4lHsq1GhghOT4ggw3Moa6JoCTM8K6RXKVz5VK_yQvL1NIC-ZbWvzw.png?link=true" target="_blank"><img src="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/3030/optimized_1imEIsNaUtLoWzA53tJegncGKXXr1E11Xdzsd5E2SFTCdplx6an4HqGQa-W7tv8JQJzYbsEu6xsS9x5bfuHRdB0QDgdU5m1IY4lHsq1GhghOT4ggw3Moa6JoCTM8K6RXKVz5VK_yQvL1NIC-ZbWvzw.png"></a></p><p><em>Carole Ely (left) and Lore Harp holding a Vector 1. Source: Vector Graphic.</em></p><p>“Maybe people are really interested in having a computer that doesn't have all the switches,” Harp told an excited <a href="https://archive.org/details/PersonalComputing19770506/page/n109/mode/2up" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Personal Computing World </em>journalist</a>. “Maybe it’s a little beyond the hobbyist who likes to fiddle with all that and likes to see everything work.”</p><p>The Vector 1 was a no-nonsense, ready-to-use computer designed for businesses that wanted a machine that would just work. It also had style, featuring a sleek metal case with rounded corners. It was even available in four colors—burnt orange, dark green, black, and beige. “It was not Apple that did colors first,” Harp remembered later.</p><p>“The folks at Vector have managed to come up with a rather slick-looking entry into the market,” <em>Kilobaud Microcomputing </em>wrote. “And, it’s all theirs.”</p><p>Other reviews of the Vector 1 were equally impressive. So, too, were those for the Vector 2—a machine that kept to the same principles but was faster and had more RAM—that followed soon after. Together, the machines pushed Vector Graphic to the top of the second tier of microcomputer manufacturers that almost exclusively focused on business customers. Companies like Apple and Commodore could boast larger unit sales if figures for both the business and home markets were combined, but when it came to more expensive machines for medium-sized businesses, Vector was the dominant player. By 1980, it was achieving $25 million (about $95 million today) in annual sales. The company that had been started in Harp’s converted back bedroom was now a well-known brand within the computing industry.&nbsp;</p><p>Wall Street also began to notice.</p><h2>From the ground up</h2><p>It wasn’t just the functionality of Vector’s machines that impressed the business market. It was also that they reliably worked.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/3030/optimized_K1Q4r7huvZ8XXgUs1VK99J1Yu0P7cNoRSBuoLhuxW9eGvXBVa_2dEJCgAVGPAw0yWhFfWs4jfHTaL5-sCXqoHlXtlC5NKomZQbHivjacCYpK7DB4U0r4PIIgbMMbT8igpIKu-p-ci-Wb7YD97ZJqNw.png?link=true" target="_blank"><img src="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/3030/optimized_K1Q4r7huvZ8XXgUs1VK99J1Yu0P7cNoRSBuoLhuxW9eGvXBVa_2dEJCgAVGPAw0yWhFfWs4jfHTaL5-sCXqoHlXtlC5NKomZQbHivjacCYpK7DB4U0r4PIIgbMMbT8igpIKu-p-ci-Wb7YD97ZJqNw.png"></a></p><p><em>An advertisement for the 1979 Vector MZ, championing its reliability. Source: Author’s collection.</em></p><p>In customer surveys of the time, Vector Graphic consistently outperformed Apple, Commodore, Tandy, and others in terms of customer satisfaction among business users, largely due to reliability. Lore Harp had mastered running microcomputer production lines, something most other computer startups struggled with. Under her leadership, Vector rarely suffered any workforce issues, and the quality of output from the production lines themselves was high. Her success wasn’t just due to her eye for detail. It was also because she recognized that production is, fundamentally, about people.</p><p>In an era in which production-line staff was largely treated as unskilled labor and corporate benefits were reserved for the C-suite, Vector Graphic bucked the trend. When the company hit its first $1 million sales month, Harp closed the factory and took all 500 employees out to play baseball and drink beer. The company also paid well. It even had a daycare and offered home cleaning services to employees who were struggling to balance household responsibilities with their work.&nbsp;</p><p>These benefits did not go unnoticed in the trade and business press, nor that, as a result, Vector had a higher-than-average number of female employees. In interviews, magazines would ask if Harp’s approach was intended as some kind of feminist experiment. Alternatively, they would ask if it was evidence that female CEOs managed more emotionally than strategically—often with the implicit accusation that the company benefits were a sign of weakness. Harp’s answer was always the same: These benefits and policies were in place because they made economic sense.</p><p>Harp’s philosophy was made clear when Vector went public in 1981. In the first meeting with the IPO’s prospective underwriters, she dropped a bombshell—she wanted <em>every</em><strong> </strong>Vector employee to receive stock options.</p><p>“That guy in assembly who puts in the last screw? If he is really mad, and he doesn’t do it properly, and Quality Assurance misses it, it’s not just the guy back there who hears about it. It’s the VP of sales,” Harp explained. “Because soon it is sales going down because suddenly you’re no longer delivering quality product. <em>Everybody</em> is deserving, not just those of us sitting at the front office.”</p><p>She was told it wasn’t normal. Share options for senior staff was fine, but offering them to the entire staff would harm the value of the offering.</p><p>Harp wouldn’t budge. “Well, you’ve got five minutes,” she told them. “We must have a deal at the end of that time, or we walk.”</p><p>The underwriters protested again.</p><p>“Okay,” Harp said calmly, looking at her watch. “Well, that’s 30 seconds gone.”</p><p>After a frantic discussion, the underwriters agreed to find a way to make it work. In the end, Vector’s staff received stock options based on their time at the company, priced at $1 per share. When the IPO was successful, these shares increased in value by a factor of 13.</p><p>“People couldn’t believe it,” Harp said later. “They were thrilled.”</p><p>The IPO also made Harp the second-ever female founder to take a company public on the Nasdaq stock exchange. Fellow Silicon Valley tech entrepreneur Sandra Kurtzig beat her by just a few days. Harp didn’t mind. Kurtzig was the founder of ASK, a software company focused on business productivity applications. As the two most prominent female founders in the industry, they had become good friends and business allies.</p><p>Although the IPO would represent a major achievement for both Harp and Ely, running Vector was taking a toll on their marriages. Ely’s husband had tolerated her role at Vector as an outlet for her boredom, but as she continued to invest more of her time in the company, their relationship began to deteriorate. For the Harps, cracks were also appearing. Bob had also initially seen Vector as a side project for Lore Harp, and his direct involvement created further problems when the two began to hold different opinions on how the company should be run. He was resentful of the level of attention she received in the press, feeling it diminished his own role at Vector.</p><h2><strong>The Ice Maiden</strong></h2><p>In the beginning, both Harp and Ely were treated as a curious novelty by the rest of Silicon Valley. Their impressive range of products allowed them access to the right circles and markets, but that often came at a price. At best, they were treated with a sort of benign paternalism by competitors that Harp was often all too happy to exploit. Often, the first time a competitor realized how ruthless she could be was when they discovered their customers were now Vector’s customers instead.</p><p>Deals and product demos often took place in hotel rooms during industry shows or on sales tours. Unfortunately, Harp and Ely were often left having to deal with attempts at abuse or exploitation.</p><p>“They either just loved you, or they were trying to be after you,” Harp said later. “One guy actually got slapped. I said, ‘I’m here for one purpose only.’”</p><p>As Harp climbed higher within American industry, the paradigm started to shift. Senior figures within other companies began to resent her presence at the top of the tech pyramid. What had begun as an unthreatening story of two housewives running an odd little business became one instead of two women successfully building and expanding their empire. To many, this didn’t seem possible, and articles of the time suggested that Harp’s husband Bob played a larger role than he actually did. By diminishing the role of the two women in the success of their own company, readers were reassured—whether purposely or not—that behind every successful woman, there must be a man.</p><p>This attitude wasn’t universal. There were those who saw Harp’s skills clearly for what they were. In late 1980, it was Harp—and Vector—who Adam Osborne approached while looking for a manufacturer for his revolutionary portable computer. Osborne was making the jump from writing about computers to designing them. He knew that manufacturing his new machine—the Osborne 1—would be difficult and complex, so he wanted it to be made by the best. In his mind, the best was Lore Harp. Harp was skeptical and wanted to wait until Osborne had a production prototype. Unwilling to wait, Adam Osborne <a href="https://every.to/the-crazy-ones/the-rise-and-fall-of-steve-jobs-s-greatest-rival" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pushed ahead</a> on his own.</p><p>After Vector went public in August 1981, the negative perception of Harp held by some executives only grew stronger. Female business icons were allowed, as long as they followed the unwritten rules and remained quiet and humble. Harp was proud of her company and her success, and was happy to call out individuals who treated her poorly, as she had done at that London meeting for Vector’s IPO.</p><p>Soon, she was referred to as the <a href="https://archive.org/details/trialsrewardsofe0000unse/page/84/mode/2up" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Ice Maiden”</a> within the industry. Early in 1982, a female employee wrote to Harp, congratulating her on her success. However, the employee expressed her dismay at some of the things she would hear from male industry figures when she mentioned that she worked at Vector. She told Harp that one man had complained to her about “the awful bitch who was running the company.”</p><p>“I sent a nice note back,” Harp remembered later, “and said I especially enjoyed the comment about this bitch running the company because that poor guy is either so jealous or he’s so stupid that he doesn’t have anything else to talk about, and I must be terribly important in his eyes.”</p><p>Long before the phrase was coined, Lore Harp was busy living rent-free in many male executives’ heads.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>The breakup</strong></h2><p>Harp and Ely’s success came at a cost. By the end of 1981, Carole Ely was divorced; her husband was unhappy with how much of her time was occupied by her career. Lore and Bob Harp had already effectively separated by the end of 1980, and the possibility of a divorce was even declared as a business risk in the company’s IPO documents. Any faint chance of reconciliation ended with the positive press Vector received after the company went public. Much of this focused on Harp’s leadership role and impact on the company’s success, including an <a href="https://archive.org/details/time-1982-11-15/Time%201982-03-22/page/58/mode/2up" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">interview in <em>Time</em> magazine</a>. Bob, annoyed at the attention his then-wife was receiving, burned a number of copies of <em>Inc. </em>magazine—which had featured Harp on its cover—in front of her.</p><p>Official divorce proceedings began not long after, eventually concluding in the summer of 1982. In the end, Harp would be divorced for only a single day. She had already begun a relationship with the man who would become her second husband—publishing mogul Pat McGovern. She became Lore Harp McGovern. They proved to be a good match, enjoying their time together but respecting each other’s boundaries. The marriage would last until McGovern’s death in 2014.</p><h2><strong>‘Big Blue’ awakens</strong></h2><p>Adam Osborne was not the only person in Silicon Valley impressed with what Lore Harp McGovern had built at Vector. Just before she took the company public, a man named Don Estridge led a delegation from IBM to pay her a visit. Estridge indicated that IBM was thinking about making a small move into the microcomputer market, and suggested that Vector could supply computers for IBM to badge and sell under an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) arrangement. Rather than designing and selling its own microcomputer, IBM would be happy to confine itself to purchasing stock from Vector that it would sell—with a mark-up—as IBM products.</p><p>“Let me get this straight,” Harp McGovern asked him. “You are a $25 billion business. We’re a $25 million business. And you are interested in potentially buying OEM products <em>from us</em>? That seems like a highly unlikely proposition.”</p><p>Estridge insisted it was true, and Harp McGovern played along. Estridge left with a number of Vector machines as samples. Harp McGovern was smart enough though to know what this really meant: IBM was building a microcomputer. She called an emergency meeting of her senior executives.</p><p>“We have one year, if that,” she said. “The world is going to change.”</p><p>Vector Graphic knew that if IBM (“Big Blue” to its friends and enemies) entered the market, it would target business clients—Vector’s bread and butter. This couldn’t have come at a worse time. Bob Harp, who despite the divorce was still an intrinsic part of the company’s design team, had recently overseen two major technical missteps.</p><p>Vector was late in moving from machines with 8K processing to 16K, which had become the new industry standard. This left Vector—and its dealer network—selling a range of machines based on dated technology longer than other manufacturers. As a result, its customer base was slow to upgrade to new machines, choosing to wait until Vector released one based on 16K technology. This problem was compounded by the release of the Vector 3, its final 8K machine. The computer itself was as reliable as ever, but its keyboard wasn’t detachable and instead was <a href="https://www.computerhistory.org/collections/catalog/X1092.92" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">built into</a> the computer’s case. Users found this design uncomfortable to use and the Vector 3 became the first of the company’s machines to garner negative reviews.</p><p>Because of these mistakes, Vector failed to sufficiently expand its business before Big Blue arrived—even though Harp McGovern had correctly guessed that IBM was about to enter the game. Vector had little financial room to maneuver once the first IBM PC was released in August 1981.</p><p>Vector made another bad decision later that year, even after the impact of the IBM PC on the business microcomputer market became apparent: Vector continued to use the CP/M operating system rather than switch to Microsoft DOS.</p><p>CP/M had been the operating system of choice within the business sector for some time. Most business software was written to work with it, which made it the obvious choice for any microcomputer manufacturer around which to build their machine. Despite this, Vector had always enjoyed a close relationship with Microsoft, which had its own aspirations to be a power player in the operating system market. Indeed, Bill Gates occasionally worked out of Harp McGovern’s office when he was in town.</p><p>As a result, Harp McGovern had the opportunity to see, sooner than most other companies, what Microsoft was adding to its own operating system in an effort to capture the market. Once the IBM PC debuted with Microsoft DOS—not CP/M—installed, building future machines around this upstart operating system began to look more attractive. It could offer more functionality, while IBM’s adoption of DOS all but guaranteed that software companies would rewrite their business software to support it. It was a switch that Harp McGovern herself was inclined to make, so she contacted Gates and negotiated a provisional contract for Vector to pivot to using DOS instead of CP/M on far sweeter terms—and at a much faster pace—than were being offered to other manufacturers.</p><p>“We had an amazing relationship with Microsoft. I’d signed a contract where every update and every new system in perpetuity we would get at no increased royalty,“ she explained.</p><p>The deal was taken to the board, but the collective decision was made that it was better to stick with the known quantity that was CP/M for the in-development Vector 4. Switching would potentially mean redesigning the next line of machines. It meant re-educating their dealers and clients in the new operating system, and there was no guarantee that every piece of software they needed would be ported to it. The board, which included a number of ex-IBM employees, was also convinced that IBM would soon lose interest in the microcomputer market, leaving it entirely. If that happened, it would leave Vector alone on DOS—a precarious position to be in. In the end, the board agreed that moving to DOS was the bigger risk. This decision robbed Vector of the chance to be one of the first manufacturers to offer “IBM compatibility.” The window for survival in the post-IBM world would be narrow, and Vector had just narrowed it even further.</p><p>“I would say not having forced this through to make it happen was probably a flaw on my part,” Harp McGovern reflected. “By kind of going against my instinct that this needed to happen in order to be competitive. Because IBM was lusting after our dealer network.”</p><p>1982 was a tough year for Vector and the microcomputer industry in general. IBM aggressively pushed to gain market share with its PC, squeezing out many of the smaller players in this space. Harp McGovern worked hard, and successfully, to defend Vector’s share of the market in this hostile environment. Margins were squeezed, but the company’s commitment to quality and support gaveVector a fiercely loyal customer base and dealer network. Sales remained strong, and the company remained profitable. Vector seemed to have secured its niche. So at the end of 1982, Harp McGovern stepped back, relinquishing the role of CEO that she had held since founding the company in 1976. She oversaw the appointment of Fred Snow, an experienced industry hand from Honeywell, as Vector’s new CEO. Since the divorce from Bob, Harp McGovern had wanted to find more time to spend with her own children. She also wanted to fulfill the promise she had made herself as a child and travel the world in her spare time. Both Bob and Carole Ely had left the company by this point, and she decided it was her turn, too. She thought Vector no longer needed Lore Harp McGovern. She was wrong.</p><h2><strong>The final roll of the dice</strong></h2><p>In 1983, the Vector board petitioned Lore Harp McGovern to retake the position of CEO. In her absence, the company had lost more ground to IBM. Countering its moves required quick, decisive action, which the new CEO was unable to provide. The company’s market share had declined precipitously, and it was losing money at an alarming rate.</p><p>Harp McGovern was reluctant to step back into the fray.</p><p>“I had moved up to northern California at the time,” she said later in an interview. “I’d just moved up here a few months earlier with small children, nine and eleven, right after school was out, no friendship, no circle for them.”</p><p>Harp McGovern had promised to spend more time with her children. It was not a promise she was prepared to break. The board pleaded with her to return anyway, stressing that layoffs were already necessary. Without her back at the helm, they likely faced bankruptcy. Harp McGovern relented.</p><p>For almost nine months, Harp McGovern worked to save what was left of the business she and Ely had built. She oversaw a round of layoffs, which was painful for someone who believed the employees were the heart of the business. It was clear to everyone now that the future lay in IBM-compatible machines running DOS—the boat that Vector missed in 1982. Harp negotiated new investment to enable the development of IBM compatibility for the Vector 5 and beyond. . With gargantuan effort, Harp McGovern managed to drag Vector back close to profitability.&nbsp;</p><p>The personal toll, however, was enormous. Keeping the company alive took all of her talent, but it also took her away from her children. When she had agreed to become CEO again, it was conditioned on her not having to move back to LA. She wanted her now school-age children to have a stable home life. To achieve that, she endured multi-hour, long commutes to Vector’s headquarters in southern California.</p><p>“I commuted every day to Los Angeles between here and Burbank,” she said. “I would take a 6 a.m. flight. I’d get to Burbank, have my car in the parking lot, got to the office at 8:30. And at night, I’d try to get the 6 o’clock flight back so I could have dinner with my kids a little late but still have dinner, and the next day, do the same thing again.”</p><p>Soon, Harp McGovern wasn’t just fighting external battles. Friction grew with the board over where savings should be found. Where they wanted to find more cost efficiencies in staffing or production, she argued instead that they should seek new investment and expand into markets yet to be targeted by IBM. They rejected her plan to develop a new machine that would focus on networking and telecommunications, which she saw as the future of computing.&nbsp;</p><p>In the end, Harp McGovern was worn down. In 1984 she walked away (again) from her own company: “I finally said, ‘Guys, I’ve had it. I’m out of here.’ I dumped all my stock, had a good cry at my lawyer’s office because it was just…Oh, it was just…”</p><h2><strong>Life after Vector</strong></h2><p>Harp McGovern’s departure sealed the fate of Vector Graphic, although the company would limp on for a few more years. In October 1987 Vector Graphic finally declared bankruptcy. By that point, Harp McGovern herself had been out of the picture for three years. That didn’t stop a number of journalists from treating its failure as unspoken vindication that housewives—and Ice Maidens—lacked the mettle to succeed. The departure of Bob was often pushed as the turning point. Bob himself was often on hand to provide a useful quote in support of this idea.</p><p>“They didn’t develop any successful products after I left there,” he told the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1985-08-20-fi-2173-story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Los Angeles Times</em></a> in 1985 after Vector filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. “If the proper decisions had been made, it would be quite successful.”</p><p>By contrast, Harp McGovern refused to talk much about Vector for a long time after her departure. To her, Vector wasn’t just a company. It was more than that. It was something she and Ely had built from nothing into a profitable community of people.</p><p>Harp McGovern had only intended her absence from the business world to be temporary. By 1987, she was back. With Vector gone, she founded (and funded) one of the first companies attempting to develop disposable urinal funnels that would allow women to urinate standing up. Then, in partnership with her husband Pat, she launched a venture capital fund. In 1994, she became one of the original <a href="https://www.bandangels.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Band of Angels”</a>—one of the first angel investor groups in California focused on technology and life sciences.&nbsp;</p><p>“What I really enjoy is growing the company,” Harp McGovern said when asked what drove her. “Growing people within the company, accepting the challenge of being out there, competing against other companies and making an impact.”</p><p>At first, venture capital and angel investment seemed to offer those opportunities for growth, but over time she became disillusioned with this world. Many investors were happy to take her money, but they refused to accept that she might have useful advice to offer.</p><p>“After I’d done Vector—building a company from totally nothing to fairly good size with an international distribution network, having gone through raising venture capital, having gone through taking the company public and that sort of thing—I felt I could make a great contribution to other young companies that wanted to start in business,” she said later. The reality was quite different. Most entrepreneurs don’t want all the help I thought I could bring.”</p><p>Providing funding without hands-on advice held little interest for Harp. She eventually moved away from this industry as well.</p><p>In the end, Harp McGovern’s legacy would end up being something different. In 2000, alongside her husband Pat, she gave $350 million to endow the McGovern Institute at MIT. She played an active role in establishing it as one of the foremost research institutes into the brain in the world.</p><p>Of all the figures we have explored so far in this series, and of all those we are yet to explore, Lore Harp McGovern is likely the one who has been overlooked the most. Perhaps only Harp McGovern’s friend Sandy Kurtzig runs close. While Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak were building a computer empire in the suburbs of California, Lore Harp McGovern and Carole Ely were doing the same. As with Adam Osborne, however, the history of Silicon Valley likes to focus on its winners.&nbsp;</p><p>But the voices that are the most outspoken about the need for women to step up and beat men at their own game are often those that are the quietest when that actually happens. Harp McGovern didn’t just shatter Silicon Valley’s glass ceiling—the Ice Maiden (or “the awful bitch”) used its broken shards to carve out a place for herself, her company, and her employees along the way. All too often, her successes have been allocated to other people, while her failures have been attributed to her alone. For all these reasons, one of Silicon Valley’s true pioneers has been granted only a single <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lore_Harp_McGovern" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">inaccurate paragraph</a> on Wikipedia.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2016, Harp McGovern <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKLmJ5kQ5pw" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recorded an interview</a> with the Computer History Museum. “I'm delighted to do this, mainly because there were so few women in the industry at the time,” she said, when thanked for her contribution to the museum’s archive. “And also for my grandchildren to see that their grandmother actually did things that not a lot of women did in those days.”</p><p>It’s not just Harp McGovern’s grandchildren who should be aware of her achievements. Because unlike many of those who kickstarted the golden age of computing, Lore Harp McGovern, in her late seventies, is still with us today.</p><p>If you are a young founder today who finds themselves in her presence, you would do well to ask one of Silicon Valley’s last remaining original founders for her advice. If she’s prepared to offer it, then listen.</p><hr><p><em>Gareth Edwards is a digital strategist, writer, and historian.

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Use-case</h2><a id="user-content-use-case" aria-label="Permalink: Use-case" href="#use-case"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Reverst is for exposing services on the public internet from within restrictive networks (e.g. behind NAT gateways).
The tunnel binary is intended to be deployed on the public internet.
Client servers then dial out to the tunnels and register themselves on target tunnel groups.
A tunnel group is a load-balanced set of client-servers, which is exposed through the reverst tunnel HTTP interface.</p>

  <div>
    <p>What is the status of the ~18-year-old HN?</p>

<p>Instead of reading the stories, why not just dismantle HN and look under the hood?</p>

<p>I love HN, and it has these beautiful APIs that can expose most of HN data, so I went for it. I extracted ~40M items, plus ~0.5M users (who shared stories). This is the second large data harvesting project I do after LeMonde (<a href="https://blog.osm-ai.net/data-science/machine-learning/nlp/2022/02/15/french-journey-part-1.html">1</a>, <a href="https://blog.osm-ai.net/data-science/machine-learning/nlp/2022/08/18/french-journey-part-2.html">2</a>, <a href="https://blog.osm-ai.net/thinking/2023/09/23/french-journey-part-3.html">3</a>).</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/osm3000/hackernews_ml">The code for this work can be found here</a>.</p>

<p>The analysis of Hacker News (HN) yields three main insights:</p>

<p>Firstly, there’s a noticeable trend where HN is experiencing a decline in active contributors—those who comment or post stories—rather than gaining new ones.</p>

<p>Secondly, for those treating HN as a competitive platform where karma points serve as the score, the most effective strategy for success appears to be regular story submissions. Attempts to chase sensational news or relying on chance are less likely to yield significant karma gains.</p>

<p>Thirdly, while topics related to software development and business have historically been prevalent, in 2023, discussions around artificial intelligence have surged past these subjects, with business-related conversations showing a gradual decrease.</p>

<p>It’s important to consider that this analysis does not take into account the actual goals of HN, as they are not explicitly stated. For instance, there are ongoing debates about whether HN aims to be a platform similar to Reddit, which remain inconclusive. This analysis approaches HN as if it were any other Software as a Service (SaaS) product.</p>

<h2 id="hn-general-stats">HN general stats</h2>

<p>Hacker News (HN) comprises five types of items, with comments and stories being the most common. Here’s a breakdown:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Type</th>
      <th>Frequency</th>
      <th>Percentage</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Comment</td>
      <td>34.3 M</td>
      <td>86.8</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Story</td>
      <td>5.2 M</td>
      <td>13.12</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Job</td>
      <td>16.7 K</td>
      <td>0.04</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Pollopt</td>
      <td>14.7 K</td>
      <td>0.04</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Poll</td>
      <td>2 K</td>
      <td>0.01</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Historically, the number of stories shared on HN showed a consistent increase until 2011, after which it leveled off.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.osm-ai.net/assets/images/hn_part_1/freq_of_story_per_year.png" alt="freq_of_story_per_year.png"></p>

<p>Conversely, the volume of comments has continued to rise, though the rate of growth has slowed slightly in the past three years, as observed visually.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.osm-ai.net/assets/images/hn_part_1/freq_of_comment_per_year.png" alt="freq_of_comment_per_year.png"></p>

<h2 id="user-engagement-trends-on-hacker-news">User Engagement Trends on Hacker News</h2>

<p>An analysis of the behavior of users who post stories on Hacker News reveals that, typically, users cease sharing stories about one year after they begin. This observation is supported by the data visualization below.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.osm-ai.net/assets/images/hn_part_1/active_years_histogram.png" alt="Active years histogram"></p>

<p>Examining the first and last activity of these users suggests a pattern indicative of user turnover. Since around 2020, the number of users ceasing to share stories has outnumbered those who start.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.osm-ai.net/assets/images/hn_part_1/new_and_last_users_per_year.png" alt="new_and_last_users_per_year.png"></p>

<p>But does this trend hold true for users who primarily post comments? It appears so, as the data shows similar patterns for both story sharers and commenters.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.osm-ai.net/assets/images/hn_part_1/commentators_active_years_histogram.png" alt="commentators_active_years_histogram.png"></p>

<p><img src="https://blog.osm-ai.net/assets/images/hn_part_1/commentators_new_and_last_users_per_year.png" alt="commentators_new_and_last_users_per_year.png"></p>

<p>These findings suggest that Hacker News has been seeing a net loss in contributors for the past three years. Several theories could explain this trend:</p>

<ol>
  <li>It’s possible that Hacker News has reached the limits of growth afforded by its current design.</li>
  <li>Users might be migrating to alternative platforms.</li>
  <li>The demographic of Hacker News users could be aging, with the platform struggling to attract a younger audience, a challenge similar to what Facebook has faced.</li>
</ol>

<p>I’m eager to hear other perspectives on this matter.</p>

<h2 id="understanding-karma-and-upvoting-on-hacker-news">Understanding Karma and Upvoting on Hacker News</h2>

<p>For those new to Hacker News (HN), here’s a quick primer on some key elements:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Users have profiles with a “karma” score, reflecting their reputation on the platform, which is publicly visible.</li>
  <li>Users can post stories and comments.</li>
  <li>Stories and comments can receive upvotes from other users.</li>
  <li>The total number of upvotes for stories is public, unlike for comments. However, users with sufficient karma can also downvote or flag content.</li>
</ol>

<p>While accumulating karma might not be the main goal on HN, it’s interesting to explore how users can optimize their scores. Is it through sharing impactful stories or through regular contributions?</p>

<p>To analyze this, I’ll define the following metrics:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Impact: Measured by the median number of upvotes a user’s stories receive. Despite potential discrepancies between perceived impact by the user and actual upvotes by readers, I’ll treat them as equivalent for this analysis.</li>
  <li>Consistency: Determined by the total number of stories a user has posted.</li>
  <li>User’s score: Instead of using karma, which has shown inconsistencies in HN data (I will discuss this in more detail laer), I’ll use the sum of upvotes received by a user’s stories as an alternative metric.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now, examining the correlation between a user’s cumulative upvotes and their posting consistency reveals a strong relationship, with an \(R^{2}=0.78\).</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.osm-ai.net/assets/images/hn_part_1/nb_of_stories_vs_author_total_score.png" alt="nb_of_stories_vs_author_total_score.png"></p>

<p>This finding suggests that the key to a high score isn’t necessarily landing viral hits, but rather consistently sharing stories.</p>

<p>While the previous analysis with a high \(R^2\) might suggest that consistency is key, let’s delve into whether targeting high-impact stories is a strategy employed by successful users, or if it’s more about the volume of contributions.</p>

<p>To investigate this, I examined the interplay between the three variables: cumulative upvotes, median upvotes per story, and the number of stories shared. The graph below illustrates this relationship.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.osm-ai.net/assets/images/hn_part_1/author_cum_score_vs_median_score_logscale_lucky.png" alt="author_cum_score_vs_median_score_logscale_lucky.png"></p>

<p>Here’s what we can discern:</p>

<ol>
  <li>For scores up to approximately 1000:
    <ul>
      <li>Users can initially boost their score by focusing on impactful stories.</li>
      <li>However, as scores increase with this strategy, the trend becomes less pronounced, hinting that chance plays a role (like being the first to break major news).</li>
      <li>There appears to be a threshold beyond which focusing solely on impact is less effective, leading to the next observation.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>For scores beyond 1000:
    <ul>
      <li>Attaining higher scores, especially the top scores, is predominantly a result of sharing a higher number of stories.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>While this visual representation is compelling, it’s essential to approach it with caution. To further quantify these observations, I categorized the data into three ranges—low, medium, and high—for each dimension and calculated the normalized frequencies as shown in the table below.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.osm-ai.net/assets/images/hn_part_1/Screenshot_2024-04-02_at_08.55.40.png" alt="The choice of the bins, for each dimension, was based on the same log jumps: 0, 100, 10K, inf"></p>

<p>The categorization was based on logarithmic intervals: 0, 100, 10K, and beyond.</p>

<p>In the high score category, the data reveals that most users with high scores have achieved this with a medium-to-high number of stories, typically of low impact.</p>

<p><em>Thus, the data supports the conclusion that for those aiming to “win” at HN, consistent story sharing is the most effective strategy.</em></p>

<h2 id="topics-trend">Topics trend</h2>

<p>In examining the progression of story topics on Hacker News, I analyzed the titles of stories to identify trends over time. The focus was on the ten most prevalent topics, as illustrated in the graph below.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.osm-ai.net/assets/images/hn_part_1/hackernews_topic_percentage.png" alt="hackernews_topic_percentage.png"></p>

<p>The data confirms that business has consistently been a leading subject of conversation since HN’s inception, alongside software development. However, there has been a noticeable shift: discussions on business have been waning, while interest in artificial intelligence and machine learning has surged dramatically, surpassing the former frontrunners in 2023.</p>

<h2 id="personal-note-why-am-i-doing-this">Personal note: Why am I doing this?</h2>

<p>Why am I delving into this project? It’s simple: these endeavors push my technical boundaries, from establishing databases and infrastructure to implementing analytics and scaling. At this magnitude, errors come at a high cost, and any less-than-optimal choices become a significant nuisance, slowing progress (a topic I might expand on in a future post).</p>

<p>I’m drawn to the dynamism of live data; it’s always current, always evolving, and it paves the way for intriguing projects, such as forecasting story trends. In contrast, static datasets on platforms like Kaggle can quickly become mundane.</p>

<p>My ambition extends to crafting a new interface for my personal use on top of HN. Currently, HN stories are primarily accessed through a single board view. Why not design a tailored recommendation engine to curate stories of interest to me? Or create a tool to track specific users and their story submissions? I believe HN has untapped potential waiting to be explored.</p>

<p>This journey has also led me to revisit historical content, offering me a fresh perspective. For instance:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ColinWright">ColinWright</a> was a standout contributor on HackerNews up until around 2015. I stumbled upon this fact while analyzing data spanning from 2006 to 2015. One of his shared analyses on <a href="http://www.solipsys.co.uk/new/TrackingAnItemOnHackerNews.html?HN_20150505">HackerNews dynamics</a> led me to his website, which, despite its minimalistic design, struck me as elegant and effective.</li>
  <li>I encountered old posts that left a lasting impression on me:
    <ol>
      <li><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5046845">The death of Aaron Swartz</a>: I knew very little about Aaron when he was alive, and only few years ago I came to know more about him when I watched “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Internet%27s_Own_Boy">The internet’s own boy</a>” documentary about him. His story still resonates me, as I became more and more confident that there is no justice in this world, and that the law is nothing more than a tool for a few to keep the leash on the rest and maintain the status-quo.
 One of this blog posts, “<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5047421">What happens to the Dark Knight</a>”, still gives me a lot to think about.
 Another person made a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5047325">list of Aaron’s work</a> to honor him. One of it was the <a href="https://github.com/webpy/webpy"><code>webpy</code></a> python web framework, which was a nice discovery. I always wanted to learn what a web framework looks like under the hood. Flask or Django source code is much more complicated, but <code>webpy</code> seems more feasible and approachable to learn.</li>
      <li><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2227770">A UX designer who learned how to build a web app using Python-Django back in 2011</a>. Her website had a story about her personal business, and even though it was profitable, she decided to shut it down, and estimating the cost of the lost opportunity. This resonated with me, as I am considering going through a similar journey myself.</li>
      <li>By a coincidence, while looking at the data, I found that the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21">story with <code>id=21</code> is made by <code>sama</code></a> . I only know one <code>sama</code>, Sam Altman (OpenAI), which indeed turned out to be his account (apparently he is not active since ~3 years now). On the post, there is a comment from <code>pg</code> , which turned out to be Paul Graham. These are not earth shattering discoveries, probably irrelevant to anyone. But I love how looking at the data from a different point of view yielded such info.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Such discoveries are a testament to the power of perspective and the hidden gems it can reveal.</p>

<h2 id="notes-on-the-analysis">Notes on the analysis</h2>

<h2 id="why-i-didnt-use-the-users-karma">Why I didn’t use the user’s karma?</h2>

<p>I found multiple weird patterns in the user’s karma. For example, some users, who shared stories with large number of upvotes, had zero karma. Even more interestingly, there was negative karma. I don’t even know how this came to be.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Karma level</th>
      <th>Percentage</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Positive</td>
      <td>~97.9 %</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Zero</td>
      <td>~1 %</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Negative</td>
      <td>~1.13 %</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Then, there are people who shared stories, with a median of more than one, yet, their karma is one (See the table below: Percentages, normalized by index)</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>&nbsp;</th>
      <th>Karma &lt; 0</th>
      <th>Karma &gt; 0</th>
      <th>Karma == 0</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Median &lt; 5</td>
      <td>1.21</td>
      <td>97.72</td>
      <td>1.07</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>5 &lt; Median &lt; 10</td>
      <td>0.56</td>
      <td>99</td>
      <td>0.42</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Median &gt; 10</td>
      <td>0.24</td>
      <td>99.66</td>
      <td>0.10</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>I know what you might be thinking: these are low percentage of outliers. But this is what I found visually (the tables are just to communicate the observation).</p>

<p>It is very possible that this metric is tied to something else, like the upvotes on the user’s comments (this data is not available), or comments on their shared stories, or followups on the user’s comments.</p>

<p>All of this left me unsure about what the meaning of karma is exactly.</p>

<p><strong><em>Update</em></strong>: This <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_News">Wikipedia article</a> clarified a bit more the dynamics of the karma.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>However, unlike Reddit where new users can immediately both upvote and 
downvote content, Hacker News does not allow users to downvote content 
until they have accumulated 501 “karma” points. Karma points are 
calculated as the number of upvotes a given user’s content has received 
minus the number of downvotes.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_News#cite_note-tc-evol-2">[2]</a> “Flagging” comments, likewise, is not permitted until a user has 30 karma points.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>This might explain things. Although I have a 30 karma points and I can’t flag comments, thus, suggesting there was a change to this system.</p>

<h2 id="when-calculating-the-user-expected-lifetime">When calculating the user expected lifetime</h2>

<p>When I made this analysis, I only took the “year” part of the first / last appearance dates for the users, to simplify my life. This means that:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A user whose first appearance is 31/12/2011 and his last appearance is 01/01/2012 will be counted as active for a year</li>
  <li>A user whose first appearance is 01/01/2011 and his last appearance is 31/12/2011 will be counted as active for a year only as well.</li>
  <li>So, the true number here (of the expected user lifetime) is between 0~2 years.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="users-trend-graph">User’s trend graph</h2>

<p>I’ve also excluded the users who just appear in 2023, 2024, or last seen in 2024, as the year is far from over, and those it is not possible to make conclusions about it.</p>

<h2 id="topic-modeling">Topic modeling</h2>

<p>I went all over the place with this one.</p>

<p>Recently <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39852219">I saw this post</a>, where the authors analyzed the topics of OpenAI forums using <a href="http://atlas.nomic.ai/">Atlas Nomic</a>. It looked impressive. But when I tried it myself <a href="https://atlas.nomic.ai/data/omarsamir3000/lumbering-boltzmann/map">(results here)</a>, I really didn’t like the extracted topics. It is always an issue for me with these unsupervised, generic techniques.</p>

<p>Then I followed a semi-traditional approach: In order to that, I made an initial list of the topics that I thought were relevant, annotated some data accordingly, reviewed the topics list, more annotation,…etc. That went back and forth many times until I settled on a list of topics that seemed satisfying enough. 
Afterwords, I relied on GPT-4 to get the topics for each of the story titles. Few rounds of cleaning afterwords, and that was the final outcome</p>

<p>There are limitations of this work though:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The actual quality of the annotated topics is questionable. After all, what is the criteria of quality in this case?</li>
  <li>I decided on a single topic per story title. This is a major simplification.</li>
  <li>Relying on the story title to extract the topic is limiting, since it is just a sentence at best.</li>
</ol>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post"><article><p>04/08/2024</p><section><p>9 min read</p><div><figure><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2024/04/image3-11.png" alt="Major data center power failure (again): Cloudflare Code Orange tested" loading="lazy" width="1800" height="1013"></figure><p>Here's a post we never thought we'd need to write: less than five months after one of our major data centers lost power, it happened again to the exact same data center. That sucks and, if you're thinking "why do they keep using this facility??," I don't blame you. We're thinking the same thing. But, here's the thing, while a lot may not have changed at the data center, a lot changed over those five months at Cloudflare. So, while five months ago a major data center going offline was really painful, this time it was much less so.</p><p>This is a little bit about how a high availability data center lost power for the second time in five months. But, more so, it's the story of how our team worked to ensure that even if one of our critical data centers lost power it wouldn't impact our customers.</p><p>On November 2, 2023, one of our critical facilities in the Portland, Oregon region lost power for an extended period of time. It happened because of a cascading series of faults that appears to have been caused by maintenance by the electrical grid provider, climaxing with a ground fault at the facility, and was made worse by a series of unfortunate incidents that prevented the facility from getting back online in a timely fashion.</p><p>If you want to read all the gory details, they're available <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/post-mortem-on-cloudflare-control-plane-and-analytics-outage/">here</a>.</p><p>It's painful whenever a data center has a complete loss of power, but it's something that we were supposed to expect. Unfortunately, in spite of that expectation, we hadn't enforced a number of requirements on our products that would ensure they continued running in spite of a major failure.</p><p>That was a mistake we were never going to allow to happen again.</p><h3 id="code-orange">Code Orange</h3><p>The incident was painful enough that we declared what we called Code Orange. We borrowed the idea from Google which, when they have an existential threat to their business, reportedly declares a Code Yellow or Code Red. Our logo is orange, so we altered the formula a bit.</p><p>Our conception of Code Orange was that the person who led the incident, in this case our SVP of Technical Operations, Jeremy Hartman, would be empowered to charge any engineer on our team to work on what he deemed the highest priority project. (Unless we declared a Code Red, which we actually ended up doing due to a hacking incident, and which would then take even higher priority. If you're interested, you can read more about that <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/thanksgiving-2023-security-incident/">here</a>.)</p><p>After getting through the immediate incident, Jeremy quickly triaged the most important work that needed to be done in order to ensure we'd be highly available even in the case of another catastrophic failure of a major data center facility. And the team got to work.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2024/04/image2-15.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1800" height="338"></figure><h3 id="howd-we-do">How'd we do?</h3><p>We didn’t expect such an extensive real-world test so quickly, but the universe works in mysterious ways. On Tuesday, March 26, 2024, — just shy of five months after the initial incident — the same facility had another major power outage. Below, we'll get into what caused the outage this time, but what is most important is that it provided a perfect test for the work our team had done under Code Orange. So, what were the results?</p><p>First, let’s revisit what functions the Portland data centers at Cloudflare provide. As described in the November 2, 2023, <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/post-mortem-on-cloudflare-control-plane-and-analytics-outage/">post</a>, the control plane of Cloudflare primarily consists of the customer-facing interface for all of our services including our website and API. Additionally, the underlying services that provide the Analytics and Logging pipelines are primarily served from these facilities.</p><p>Just like in November 2023, we were alerted immediately that we had lost connectivity to our PDX01 data center. Unlike in November, we very quickly knew with certainty that we had once again lost all power, putting us in the exact same situation as five months prior. We also knew, based on a successful internal cut test in February, how our systems should react. We had spent months preparing, updating countless systems and activating huge amounts of network and server capacity, culminating with a test to prove the work was having the intended effect, which in this case was an automatic failover to the redundant facilities.</p><p>Our Control Plane consists of hundreds of internal services, and the expectation is that when we lose one of the three critical data centers in Portland, these services continue to operate normally in the remaining two facilities, and we continue to operate primarily in Portland. We have the capability to fail over to our European data centers in case our Portland centers are completely unavailable. However, that is a secondary option, and not something we pursue immediately.</p><p>On March 26, 2024, at 14:58 UTC, PDX01 lost power and our systems began to react. By 15:05 UTC, our APIs and Dashboards were operating normally, all without human intervention. Our primary focus over the past few months has been to make sure that our customers would still be able to configure and operate their Cloudflare services in case of a similar outage. There were a few specific services that required human intervention and therefore took a bit longer to recover, however the primary interface mechanism was operating as expected.</p><p>To put a finer point on this, during the November 2, 2023, incident the following services had at least six hours of control plane downtime, with several of them functionally degraded for days.</p><p>API and Dashboard<br>Zero Trust<br>Magic Transit<br>SSL<br>SSL for SaaS<br>Workers<br>KV<br>Waiting Room<br>Load Balancing<br>Zero Trust Gateway<br>Access<br>Pages<br>Stream<br>Images</p><p>During the March 26, 2024, incident, all of these services were up and running within minutes of the power failure, and many of them did not experience any impact at all during the failover.</p><p>The data plane, which handles the traffic that Cloudflare customers pass through our data centers in over 300 cities worldwide, was not impacted.</p><p>Our Analytics platform, which provides a view into customer traffic, was impacted and wasn’t fully restored until later that day. This was expected behavior as the Analytics platform is reliant on the PDX01 data center. Just like the Control Plane work, we began building new Analytics capacity immediately after the November 2, 2023, incident. However, the scale of the work requires that it will take a bit more time to complete. We have been working as fast as we can to remove this dependency, and we expect to complete this work in the near future.</p><p>Once we had validated the functionality of our Control Plane services, we were faced yet again with the cold start of a very large data center. This activity took roughly 72 hours in November 2023, but this time around we were able to complete this in roughly 10 hours. There is still work to be done to make that even faster in the future, and we will continue to refine our procedures in case we have a similar incident in the future.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2024/04/Incident-inspection.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="284"></figure><h3 id="how-did-we-get-here">How did we get here?</h3><p>As mentioned above, the power outage event from last November led us to introduce Code Orange, a process where we shift most or all engineering resources to addressing the issue at hand when there’s a significant event or crisis. Over the past five months, we shifted all non-critical engineering functions to focusing on ensuring high reliability of our control plane.</p><p>Teams across our engineering departments rallied to ensure our systems would be more resilient in the face of a similar failure in the future. Though the March 26, 2024, incident was unexpected, it was something we’d been preparing for.</p><p>The most obvious difference is the speed at which the control plane and APIs regained service. Without human intervention, the ability to log in and make changes to Cloudflare configuration was possible seven minutes after PDX01 was lost. This is due to our efforts to move all of our configuration databases to a Highly Available (HA) topology, and pre-provision enough capacity that we could absorb the capacity loss. More than 100 databases across over 20 different database clusters simultaneously failed out of the affected facility and restored service automatically. This was actually the culmination of over a year’s worth of work, and we make sure we prove our ability to failover properly with weekly tests.</p><p>Another significant improvement is the updates to our Logpush infrastructure. In November 2023, the loss of the PDX01 datacenter meant that we were unable to push logs to our customers. During Code Orange, we invested in making the Logpush infrastructure HA in Portland, and additionally created an active failover option in Amsterdam. Logpush took advantage of our massively expanded Kubernetes cluster that spans all of our Portland facilities and provides a seamless way for service owners to deploy HA compliant services that have resiliency baked in. In fact, during our February chaos exercise, we found a flaw in our Portland HA deployment, but customers were not impacted because the Amsterdam Logpush infrastructure took over successfully. During this event, we saw that the fixes we’d made since then worked, and we were able to push logs from the Portland region.</p><p>A number of other improvements in our Stream and Zero Trust products resulted in little to no impact to their operation. Our Stream products, which use a lot of compute resources to transcode videos, were able to seamlessly hand off to our Amsterdam facility to continue operations. Teams were given specific availability targets for the services and were provided several options to achieve those targets. Stream is a good example of a service that chose a different resiliency architecture but was able to seamlessly deliver their service during this outage. Zero Trust, which was also impacted in November 2023, has since moved the vast majority of its functionally to our hundreds of data centers, which kept working seamlessly throughout this event. Ultimately this is the strategy we are pushing all Cloudflare products to adopt as our data centers in <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/network">over 300 cities worldwide</a> provide the highest level of availability possible.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2024/04/image1-12.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1800" height="320"></figure><h3 id="what-happened-to-the-power-in-the-data-center">What happened to the power in the data center?</h3><p>On March 26, 2024, at 14:58 UTC, PDX01 experienced a total loss of power to Cloudflare’s physical infrastructure following a reportedly simultaneous failure of four Flexential-owned and operated switchboards serving all of Cloudflare’s cages. This meant both primary and redundant power paths were deactivated across the entire environment. During the Flexential investigation, engineers focused on a set of equipment known as Circuit Switch Boards, or CSBs. CSBs are likened to an electrical panel board, consisting of a main input circuit breaker and series of smaller output breakers. Flexential engineers reported that infrastructure upstream of the CSBs (power feed, generator, UPS &amp; PDU/transformer) was not impacted and continued to act normally. Similarly, infrastructure downstream from the CSBs such as Remote Power Panels and connected switchgear was not impacted – thus implying the outage was isolated to the CSBs themselves.</p><p>Initial assessment of the root cause of Flexential’s CSB failures points to incorrectly set breaker coordination settings within the four CSBs as one contributing factor. Trip settings which are too restrictive can result in overly sensitive overcurrent protection and the potential nuisance tripping of devices. In our case, Flexential’s breaker settings within the four CSBs were reportedly too low in relation to the downstream provisioned power capacities. When one or more of these breakers tripped, a cascading failure of the remaining active CSB boards resulted, thus causing a total loss of power serving Cloudflare’s cage and others on the shared infrastructure. During the triage of the incident, we were told that the Flexential facilities team noticed the incorrect trip settings, reset the CSBs and adjusted them to the expected values, enabling our team to power up our servers in a staged and controlled fashion. We do not know when these settings were established – typically, these would be set/adjusted as part of a data center commissioning process and/or breaker coordination study before customer critical loads are installed.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2024/04/Incident-inspection-3.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="284"></figure><h3 id="what%E2%80%99s-next">What’s next?</h3><p>Our top priority is completing the resilience program for our Analytics platform. Analytics aren’t simply pretty charts in a dashboard. When you want to check the status of attacks, activities a firewall is blocking, or even the status of Cloudflare Tunnels - you need analytics. We have evidence that the resiliency pattern we are adopting works as expected, so this remains our primary focus, and we will progress as quickly as possible.</p><p>There were some services that still required manual intervention to properly recover, and we have collected data and action items for each of them to ensure that further manual action is not required. We will continue to use production cut tests to prove all of these changes and enhancements provide the resiliency that our customers expect.</p><p>We will continue to work with Flexential on follow-up activities to expand our understanding of their operational and review procedures to the greatest extent possible.

  <div>
    <p>It’s long been argued that the means of production influence social, cultural and psychological processes. Rice farming, for example, requires complex irrigation systems under communal management and intense, coordinated labor. Thus, it has been argued that successful rice farming communities tend to develop people with collectivist orientations, and cultural ways of thinking that emphasize group harmony and interdependence. In contrast, wheat farming, which requires less labor and coordination <span>is associated with more individualistic cultures that value independence and personal autonomy. Implicit in Turner’s Frontier hypothesis, for example, is the idea that not only could a young man say ‘take this job and shove it’ and go west but once there they could establish a small, viable wheat farm (or other dry crop).</span></p>
<p>There is <a href="https://scholarworks.gvsu.edu/orpc/vol4/iss1/7/">plenty of evidence</a> for these theories. Rice cultures around the world do tend to exhibit similar cultural characteristics, including less focus on self, more relational or holistic thinking and greater in-group favoritism than wheat cultures. <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1246850">Similar differences exist</a> between the rice and dry crop areas of China. The differences exist but is the explanation rice and wheat farming or are there are other genetic, historical or random factors at play?</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-44770-w">new paper</a> by Talhelm and Dong in Nature Communications uses the craziness of China’s Cultural Revolution to provide causal evidence in favor of the rice and wheat farming theory of culture. After World War II ended, the communist government in China turned soldiers into farmers arbitrarily assigning them to newly created farms around the country–including two farms in Northern Ningxia province that were nearly identical in temperature, rainfall and acreage but one of the firms lay slightly above the river and one slightly below the river making the latter more suitable for rice farming and the former for wheat. During the Cultural Revolution, youth were shipped off to the farms “with very little preparation or forethought”. Thus, the two farms ended up in similar environments with similar people but different modes of production.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://marginalrevolution.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/rice-and-wheat-thinking.png" alt="" width="570" height="458" srcset="https://marginalrevolution.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/rice-and-wheat-thinking.png 916w, https://marginalrevolution.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/rice-and-wheat-thinking-300x241.png 300w, https://marginalrevolution.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/rice-and-wheat-thinking-768x617.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 570px) 100vw, 570px">Talhelm and Dong measure thought style with a variety of simple experiments which have been shown in earlier work to be associated with collectivist and individualist thinking. When asked to draw circles representing themselves and friends or family, for example, people tend to self-inflate their own circle but they self-inflate more in individualist cultures.</p>
<p>The authors find that consistent with the differences across East and West and across rice and wheat areas in China, the people on the rice farm in Ningxia are more collectivistic in their thinking than the people on the wheat farm.</p>
<p>The differences are all in the same direction but somewhat moderated suggesting that the effects can be created quite quickly (a few generations) but become stronger the longer and more embedded they are in the wider culture.</p>
<p>I am reminded of an another <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1300431110">great paper</a>, this one by <span role="listitem">Leibbrandt,</span><span role="listitem">&nbsp;Gneezy</span>, and <span role="listitem">List (LGL) that I wrote about in <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2013/10/learning-to-compete-or-cooperate.html">Learning to Compete and Cooperate</a>. LGL look at two types of fishing villages in Brazil. The villages are close to one another but some of them are on the lake and some of them are on the sea coast. Lake fishing is individualistic but sea fishing requires a collective effort. LGL find that the lake fishermen are much more willing to engage in competition–perhaps having seen that individual effort pays off–than the sea fishermen for whom individual effort is much less efficacious. Unlike Talhelm and Dong, LGL don’t have random assignment, although I see no reason why the lake and sea fishermen should otherwise be different, but they do find that women, who neither lake nor sea fish, do not show the same differences. Thus, the differences seem to be tied quite closely to production learning rather than to broader culture.</span></p>
<p>How long does it take to imprint these styles of thinking? How long does it last? Is imprinting during child or young adulthood more effective than later imprinting? Can one find the same sorts of differences between athletes of different sports–e.g. rowing versus running? It’s telling, for example, that the only famous rowers I can think are the Winklevoss <em>twins. </em>Are attempts to inculcate these types of thinking successful on a more than surface level. I have difficulty believing that “you didn’t build that,” changes say relational versus holistic thinking but would styles of thinking change during a war?</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The SUSE security team restricts the installation of system wide D-Bus
services and Polkit policies in openSUSE distributions and derived SUSE
products. Any package that ships these features needs to be reviewed by us
first, before it can be added to production repositories.</p>

<p>In November, openSUSE KDE packagers approached us <a href="https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1217076">with a long list of KDE
components</a> for an upcoming KDE6 major release. The packages
needed adjusted D-Bus and Polkit whitelistings due to renamed interfaces or
other breaking changes. Looking into this many components at once was a unique
experience that also led to new insights, which will be discussed in this
article.</p>

<p>For readers that are new to D-Bus and/or Polkit, the following sections offer
a summary to get a better idea about these systems.</p>

<h2 id="d-bus-overview">D-Bus Overview</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus/">D-Bus message bus system</a> provides a defined way to implement
remote procedure calls in applications. On Linux it is usually only used
locally, although the D-Bus specification also allows for operation over the
network.</p>

<p>A D-Bus service is a program that provides one or more interfaces that can be
invoked by clients to obtain information, trigger operations and so on. The
D-Bus specification defines a set of data types that can be passed to and
returned from D-Bus method calls.</p>

<p>D-Bus applications reach each other by connecting to a shared bus of which
there exist two predefined types: the system bus and the session bus. Services
that perform system wide tasks connect to the system bus. These services often
run as <code>root</code> or as dedicated service users. A session bus, on the other hand,
is created for each (graphical) user session, and only applications running
with the privileges of the logged-in user can connect to it. No special
privileges are involved with the session bus. Its main purpose is to provide a
defined API for session wide services, like a desktop search engine.</p>

<h2 id="polkit-overview">Polkit Overview</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/polkit/docs/latest/polkit.8.html">Polkit</a> is an authorization framework that allows (privileged)
applications to decide whether a user in the system is allowed to perform a
specific action. These actions allow for a more fine-grained authorization
model when compared to a plain <code>root</code> vs. non-<code>root</code> decision. Examples could be
an action to enable a Bluetooth device in the system, or to mount a removable
storage device.</p>

<p>A Polkit policy configuration file declares actions used by a certain
application domain and the authentication requirements for it. When an actor
in the system asks an application that uses Polkit to perform an action, then
this application in turns asks the system-wide Polkit daemon whether this
actor is privileged to do so. Depending on the context this can, for example,
lead to a password prompt being displayed in a user’s graphical session to
authorize the operation.</p>

<p>Polkit is independent of D-Bus, but the combination of both is a very common
pattern. Other manners in which Polkit can be used is in setuid-root binaries
or via the sudo-like <code>pkexec</code> utility.</p>

<h2 id="security-relevance-of-d-bus-and-polkit">Security Relevance of D-Bus and Polkit</h2>

<p>The typical setup of D-Bus and Polkit is as follows: a system daemon is
running with full root privileges and registers a service on the D-Bus system
bus. An unprivileged user that is logged into a graphical session asks the
daemon via D-Bus to perform an activity. This triggers the Polkit
authentication process to determine whether the caller is allowed to do this.</p>

<p>Security-wise, there is quite a number of things that can go wrong in this
scenario. The following sections investigate typical issues that can arise.</p>

<h3 id="covering-all-privileged-code-paths">Covering all Privileged Code Paths</h3>

<p>The system daemon actually needs to implement the Polkit authorization check
properly for every sensitive D-Bus method it offers. Polkit is not something
that is magically turned on, but the privileged component needs to identify
all the code paths that need to be protected by it.</p>

<p>Some applications deliberately offer a mix of unauthenticated and
authenticated D-Bus methods. In these cases it can sometimes be hard to keep
all the possible side effects and outcomes in mind, which can lead to security
issues when something is overlooked.</p>

<h3 id="acting-as-root-on-behalf-of-unprivileged-users">Acting as root on Behalf of Unprivileged Users</h3>

<p>The privileged D-Bus service component often needs to act on behalf of an
unprivileged client. An example could be mounting a file system in the
caller’s home directory, or processing a file provided by the caller. This is
a classic crossing of privilege boundaries. Developers of such services are
often not aware of the problems that can arise, especially when accessing user
controlled paths as <code>root</code>.</p>

<p>Similarly, if a privileged D-Bus service stores data from multiple users in a
shared system directory, then information leaks can occur by storing files with
too open permissions, or by mixing up different user contexts.</p>

<h3 id="the-integration-of-polkit-can-be-hard">The Integration of Polkit can be Hard</h3>

<p>Polkit has its own nomenclature and design principles that one needs to get
into, to fully understand it. Apart from this, even if Polkit is correctly
asked for permissions, the privileged service still needs to correctly
evaluate the result. A typical mistake that can happen in this area is when a
privileged service <em>does</em> ask Polkit correctly for authentication, but the
result is simply ignored and the privileged operation continues regardless.</p>

<h3 id="everybody-can-access-the-d-bus-system-bus">Everybody can Access the D-Bus System Bus</h3>

<p>By default, all local users can access the D-Bus system bus and talk to most
of the privileged services. Individual D-Bus service configuration files can
limit the scope of users that are allowed to invoke a D-Bus service’s methods.
This setup is the exception, however, as the majority of D-Bus services is
accessible to all users.</p>

<p>This increases the attack surface notably, as not only an interactive user
account that is running an authorized local session can talk to these
services, but also e.g. the <code>nobody</code> user account. These days, many system
daemons running on the network only have limited privileges or even use
dynamically allocated users provided by systemd. If one of these network
daemons with low privileges can be exploited, then weaknesses in privileged
D-Bus system services can offer the possibility to further escalate
privileges.</p>

<p>This is one of the reasons why, as part of a defense-in-depth strategy, the
SUSE security team looks closely also into these components that aren’t
directly attached to the network.</p>

<h2 id="the-kde-kauth-framework">The KDE KAuth Framework</h2>

<p>The KDE desktop environment is a heavy user of D-Bus services both on the
system and on the session bus. It adds further abstractions on top of D-Bus
and on top of Polkit. The base component for this is the <a href="https://api.kde.org/frameworks/kauth/html/">KAuth
framework</a>. KAuth generates D-Bus configuration files and some
glue code to integrate D-Bus and Polkit into KDE applications. In KAuth, a
privileged D-Bus service running as <code>root</code> is called a KAuth helper.</p>

<p>We performed a <a href="https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1217178">dedicated follow-up review</a> of it for the KDE6
release. A former member of the SUSE security team had found <a href="https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1036244">a major security
flaw</a> in this glue code in 2017. Since the audit at the time was
comprehensive, we did not expect to find any major issues in the core
authorization logic anymore, and in fact we didn’t.</p>

<h2 id="problematic-use-of-qvariantmap-serialized-data">Problematic use of QVariantMap Serialized Data</h2>

<p>A peculiarity of KAuth is that, instead of the native D-Bus data types, only
binary blob objects are transferred on D-Bus level, that are based on the
<code>QVariantMap</code> data type offered by the Qt framework.</p>

<p>During the review we noticed that the implementation of this feature in KAuth
<a href="https://invent.kde.org/frameworks/kauth/-/blob/4e94f01d3a191861c8095f673d70291dc225f23e/src/backends/dbus/DBusHelperProxy.cpp#L218">is a bit shaky</a>, since potentially attacker controlled data
is processed during Qt data type deserialization, before the actual D-Bus
function callbacks are even invoked. In 2019, the upstream authors
<a href="https://invent.kde.org/frameworks/kauth/-/commit/fc70fb0161c1b9144d26389434d34dd135cd3f4a">had already identified this problem</a>, that can lead
to side effects like image data being deserialized, where actually only
strings and integers are expected. The KAuth code currently meddles with
internal Qt framework state to prevent such side effects.</p>

<h2 id="problems-with-generated-d-bus-drop-in-configuration-snippets">Problems with generated D-Bus drop-in Configuration Snippets</h2>

<p>Only late in our review efforts we realized that a change introduced with the
KDE6 release of KAuth leads to <a href="https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1220215">overly open D-Bus configuration files being
generated</a>. Per-package configuration snippets for
D-Bus are installed in “/usr/share/dbus-1/system.d”. These configuration files
serve as a kind of firewall configuration for the D-Bus system bus. They
define who is allowed to register a D-Bus service for a certain interface and
also who is allowed to talk to it.</p>

<p>Here is a proper example taken from systemd-network’s “org.freedesktop.network1.conf”:</p>

<div><pre><code>&lt;busconfig&gt;
        &lt;policy user="systemd-network"&gt;
                &lt;allow own="org.freedesktop.network1"/&gt;
        &lt;/policy&gt;

        &lt;policy context="default"&gt;
                &lt;allow send_destination="org.freedesktop.network1"/&gt;
                &lt;allow receive_sender="org.freedesktop.network1"/&gt;
        &lt;/policy&gt;
&lt;/busconfig&gt;
</code></pre></div>

<p>This allows only the dedicated service user “systemd-network” to register the
D-Bus interface “org.freedesktop.network1”, while any other users in the
system may talk to it.</p>

<p>The KAuth KDE6 release candidate generated this configuration instead:</p>

<div><pre><code>&lt;policy context="default"&gt;
  &lt;allow send_destination="*"/&gt;
&lt;/policy&gt;
</code></pre></div>

<p>The ramifications of this can easily be overlooked: this states that everybody
is allowed to talk to everything on the D-Bus system bus. It also affects
other D-Bus services that should not be influenced by the drop-in
configuration snippet shipped for individual KDE packages. While most D-Bus
services running on the system bus are “public”, i.e. everybody is allowed to
talk to them, some services follow a different security model in which only
dedicated users are allowed to interact with the service. We identified 
<a href="https://github.com/libratbag/libratbag/blob/v0.17/ratbagd/org.freedesktop.ratbag1.conf">ratbagd</a> as one such D-Bus service that would be
negatively affected by this defect in KAuth. This shows that the security
posture of unrelated packages is at stake. Luckily we identified this
issue in time before the KDE6 release was finished, and the issue was fixed
before it reached production systems. We also checked any non-KDE D-Bus
configuration files we ship on openSUSE Tumbleweed for the same issue, but
luckily found no further files containing this issue.</p>

<p>These side effects are also in some sense shortcomings of the D-Bus
configuration scheme, since developers of a specific D-Bus service don’t
expect that their configuration file has a global influence. A similar issue
exists for <a href="https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1180525">logrotate</a> where settings in drop-in
configuration files in “/etc/logrotate.d” can influence global settings that
affect the complete system. This can lead to hard to find bugs in both cases,
D-Bus and logrotate, because the outcome also depends on the order in which
the configuration file snippets are parsed.</p>

<h2 id="legacy-fontinst-d-bus-service">Legacy fontinst D-Bus service</h2>

<p>Most of the KDE components that we have been requested to look into for the
KDE6 release had already been reviewed by us in recent years. A few of them
are legacy packages though, since they were already in stock when we
introduced packaging restrictions for D-Bus and Polkit. At the time we didn’t
have enough resources to check all of them in one go.</p>

<p>One such legacy component <a href="https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1217186">we encountered</a> while looking into
the KDE6 release was the “org.kde.fontinst.service” which is part of the
“plasma6-workspace” package. What we found there is a single D-Bus method
“org.kde.fontinst.manage” that actually multiplexes a whole range of
sub-methods, based on a “method” string input parameter. This is bad design
since it undermines the D-Bus protocol, and thus makes the individual method
calls less visible and less manageable. This is reinforced by the fact that
also only a single Polkit action is used to authenticate all the sub-methods.
This way there is only an all-or-nothing setting for the various code paths
that are hidden behind this single D-Bus method call.</p>

<p>The available sub-methods in this service nearly make up a generic file system
I/O layer, especially when we remember that this service is running with full
root privileges:</p>

<ul>
  <li>install: this can be used to copy arbitrary file paths to arbitrary
locations, the new files end up with mode 0644.</li>
  <li>uninstall: this allows to remove arbitrary file paths, as long as their
parent directories have a writable bit set.</li>
  <li>move: this allows to move arbitrary paths complete with new owner uid and
group gid to arbitrary new locations.</li>
  <li>toggle: this takes raw XML that also seems to specify font paths that are
to be enabled or disabled.</li>
  <li>removeFile: does what is says on the label; another way to remove files.</li>
  <li>configure: saves modified font directories and invokes a small bash script
<code>fontinst_x11</code> that prepares font directories and triggers a font refresh at
the X server.</li>
</ul>

<p>The core business logic of the fontinst service should be managing system wide
fonts provided in the system. To achieve this, ideally only the necessary high
level logical operations should be offered like: Install a font from provided
data, remove a system font by name. Copying, removing and moving arbitrary
files is way outside of the scope of what this service is supposed to do.</p>

<p>The single Polkit action “org.kde.fontinst.manage” requires <code>auth_admin_keep</code>
authorization by default i.e. anybody that wants to invoke this method needs
to provide admin credentials. Still, if an admin decides to lower these
requirements, because users should be able to e.g. install new fonts in the
system, then this interface does not only allow that, but also allows to gain
full root privileges by copying arbitrary files around (e.g. by creating a new
“/etc/shadow” file).</p>

<p>This service requires a larger redesign. KDE upstream was not able to come up
with that in time for the KDE6 release. We hope that it will still happen
though, as the API is in a rather worrying state.</p>

<h2 id="woes-with-unexpected-polkit-settings">Woes with “unexpected” Polkit Settings</h2>

<p>The situation in the fontinst service regarding the <code>auth_admin</code> setting is a
common pattern that we see when reviewing D-Bus services and Polkit actions.
Developers believe that requiring <code>auth_admin</code> authentication for a Polkit
action is enough to justify overly generic APIs or unsafe file system
operations carried out as <code>root</code>. In some cases it might be justifiable to say
that an action should never have weaker authentication requirements than
<code>auth_admin</code>, since it otherwise causes uncontrollable security issues. One
should not forget that Polkit is a <em>configurable</em> authentication framework,
though. There are default settings shipped by applications, but system
integrators and admins are allowed to change these requirements.</p>

<p>The (open)SUSE Linux distributions are the only ones we know of, that offer a
<a href="https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Security_Documentation#Configuration_of_Polkit_Settings">defined mechanism</a> for admins to override the
Polkit defaults for individual actions via profiles and overrides. This works
via the <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE/polkit-default-privs">polkit-default-privs</a> package. Our experience
with this shows that upstream developers mostly neither consider the security
consequences of lowering the Polkit authentication requirements, nor test what
happens when the authentication requirements are raised for hardening
purposes. Raised authentication requirements lead to additional password
prompts, and some applications implement workflows involving Polkit actions
that lead to very unfortunate behaviour in such cases.</p>

<p>A common example of this is a package manager like Flatpak, that attempts to
acquire Polkit authentication for a repository refresh action upon login into
a graphical session. The developers only test this with the default <code>yes</code>
Polkit authentication requirement, which makes this authentication process
invisible to users. When raising this to <code>auth_admin</code>, then suddenly a password
prompt pops up during login and users are confused and annoyed. There are ways
to deal with this: for example, services using Polkit can ask it whether an
action can be authorized without user interaction. If this is not the case,
then a package manager could choose <em>not</em> to refresh repositories just now.
Also multiple actions can be authenticated in groups using the
“org.freedesktop.policykit.imply” annotation to avoid multiple password
prompts coming up for a single workflow.</p>

<p>It is understandable that the configuration management of many different
Polkit configurations is hard to test for upstream developers. Increased
awareness of the general problems in this area would help to avoid these
issues in the first place. It seems that developers just want to “cram in”
authentication into their software, though, and stop thinking about it once
they’re done. Granted, Polkit and D-Bus are far from simple when you’re new to
them. Still, every authentication procedure should be given careful thought.
The take home lessons for developers implementing Polkit should be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Polkit is a <em>configurable</em> authentication framework and the settings
intended by developers might not be what actually happens during runtime.</li>
  <li>When modelling Polkit actions, one should take advantage of the possibility
to make them fine grained, to allow users to fine tune the requirements for
individual activities.</li>
  <li>Each Polkit authorization that happens in an application should be given
some thought in both directions: what happens if the authentication
requirement is lowered and what happens if it is raised?</li>
  <li>Another aspect that hasn’t been discussed yet is the topic of authentication
messages shown to the user. They should clearly state what exactly is being
authorized in a form that non-technical users can understand. Polkit also
supports placeholders in messages to fill in runtime information, like a file
that is being operated on. Sadly, this feature is used very rarely in
practice.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="problematic-file-system-operations-in-sddm-kcm6">Problematic File System Operations in sddm-kcm6</h2>

<p>This component is a KDE Configuration Module (KCM) for the SDDM display
manager. It contains a D-Bus service “org.kde.kcontrol.kcmsddm.conf”. We
reviewed it already in the past and <a href="https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1217188">did so again</a> for the
KDE6 release. The service has two major problems, discussed in the following
sections.</p>

<h2 id="unsafe-operations-on-file-system-paths-provided-by-the-unprivileged-d-bus-client">Unsafe Operations on File System Paths Provided by the Unprivileged D-Bus Client</h2>

<p>Multiple of the D-Bus methods provided by the sddm-kcm6 KAuth helper expect
file system paths as input parameters. Such passing of paths to privileged
D-Bus services is another problematic pattern that is often encountered. In
the <a href="https://invent.kde.org/plasma/sddm-kcm/-/blob/Plasma/6.0/sddmauthhelper.cpp?ref_type=heads#L30"><code>openConfig()</code></a> function, the provided path to a <a href="https://invent.kde.org/plasma/sddm-kcm/-/blob/Plasma/6.0/sddmauthhelper.cpp?ref_type=heads#L280">SDDM
theme configuration file</a> will be created by the helper, if
necessary.  If it already exists, then a <code>chmod()</code> of the path to mode <code>0600</code>
is performed, which is also following symlinks. To see how this can be
problematic, consider what happens if “/etc/shadow” is passed as theme
configuration path.</p>

<p>Operating as <code>root</code>, on files that are under control of an unprivileged user, is
notoriously hard to get right, and requires careful use of lower level system
calls. Often developers aren’t even aware of this problem. KDE components have
had a number of problems in this area in the past. We believe this has
deeper roots, namely in the design of the Qt framework’s file system API, which
on the one hand doesn’t allow full control over the lower level system calls
(owed to the fact that Qt is also a platform abstraction layer), and on the
other hand does not document exactly what can be expected of its APIs
in this regard. Furthermore the Qt framework itself isn’t aware of the fact
that it runs as root, possibly operating on files owned by other users. The Qt
libraries are designed for implementing feature rich GUI applications and
don’t really consider handling untrusted input, operating with raised
privileges and crossing privilege boundaries.</p>

<p>An elegant way to avoid the path access issue in the first place is by not
passing file paths, but already opened file descriptors over D-Bus. This is
possible since D-Bus uses UNIX domain sockets internally, and they can be used
to pass file descriptors. So instead of passing a string from client to
service suggesting “Open this file, trust me, it’s fine”, the client passes a
file descriptor, opened using its own low privileges, to the privileged
service. With this, many path access issues are gone in an instant. There
are cases that still require care, however, for example if recursive file
system operations need to be carried out.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the KAuth framework used by KDE <a href="https://invent.kde.org/frameworks/kauth/-/issues/3#note_826581">shows a limitation in
this area</a>. Since the KAuth helper’s D-Bus API only
transfers binary blobs that result from serializing <code>QVariantMap</code>, there
is currently no possibility to pass an open file descriptor.</p>

<h2 id="changes-in-configuration-files-owned-by-the-sddm-service-user">Changes in configuration files owned by the <code>sddm</code> service user</h2>

<p>The other problem is not found in the D-Bus API, but in the implementation of
the <code>sync()</code> and <code>reset()</code> D-Bus methods. Once any input parameters from the
client are processed, the helper operates in the home directory belonging to
the <code>sddm</code> service user. Here is some condensed code taken from the reset()
and sync() functions:</p>

<div><pre><code>// from SddmAuthHelper::reset()
QString sddmHomeDirPath = KUser("sddm").homeDir();
QDir sddmConfigLocation(sddmHomeDirPath + QStringLiteral("/.config"));
QFile::remove(sddmConfigLocation.path() + QStringLiteral("/kdeglobals"));
QFile::remove(sddmConfigLocation.path() + QStringLiteral("/plasmarc"));
QDir(sddmHomeDirPath + "/.local/share/kscreen/").removeRecursively();
</code></pre></div>

<div><pre><code>// from SddmAuthHelper::sync()
QString sddmHomeDirPath = KUser("sddm").homeDir();

QDir sddmCacheLocation(sddmHomeDirPath + QStringLiteral("/.cache"));
if (sddmCacheLocation.exists()) {
    sddmCacheLocation.removeRecursively();
}

QDir sddmConfigLocation(sddmHomeDirPath + QStringLiteral("/.config"));

if (!args[QStringLiteral("kscreen-config")].isNull()) {
    const QString destinationDir = sddmHomeDirPath + "/.local/share/kscreen/";
    QSet&lt;QString&gt; done;
    copyDirectoryRecursively(args[QStringLiteral("kscreen-config")].toString(), destinationDir, done);
}
</code></pre></div>

<p>A compromised <code>sddm</code> service user can exploit these operations to its advantage:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it can cause a denial-of-service by e.g. placing directory symlinks
to have the D-Bus service operate in completely different file system
locations. This attack is limited though, since the final path components
used in removal calls need to match, like <code>kscreen</code>.</li>
  <li>it can cause the “kscreen-config” to be copied to arbitrary locations by
placing a symlink in “~/.local/share/kscreen”.</li>
</ul>

<p>To make these operations safe, it would be best to temporarily drop privileges
to the <code>sddm</code> user.</p>

<h2 id="going-forward-from-here">Going Forward from Here</h2>

<p>KDE upstream was not able to come up with a redesign of this D-Bus service in
time for the KDE6 release. In this instance, the unsafe operations in the <code>sddm</code>
user’s home directory would formally even justify assignment of a CVE. Since
all the D-Bus methods are guarded by <code>auth_admin</code> Polkit authentication
requirements, the issues can at least not be exploited in default installations.</p>

<h2 id="kwalletmanager-pseudo-authentication-to-protect-the-configuration">KWalletManager: Pseudo-Authentication to Protect the Configuration</h2>

<p>KWalletManager is KDE’s password manager. It features a GUI and, as one would
expect, runs in the context of the graphical user session of a logged-in user.
It ships a “savehelper” service that offers a single D-Bus method
“org.kde.kcontrol.kcmkwallet5.save”. So what does a service helper running as
<code>root</code> need to save here? Let’s look <a href="https://invent.kde.org/utilities/kwalletmanager/-/blob/master/src/konfigurator/savehelper.cpp">at the implementation</a>:</p>

<div><pre><code>ActionReply SaveHelper::save(const QVariantMap &amp;args)
{
    Q_UNUSED(args);
    const qint64 uid = QCoreApplication::applicationPid();
    qDebug() &lt;&lt; "executing uid=" &lt;&lt; uid;
    return ActionReply::SuccessReply();
}
</code></pre></div>

<p>Turning this piece of code carefully to all sides will lead to the insight
that it does <em>nothing</em>. We <a href="https://invent.kde.org/utilities/kwalletmanager/-/issues/4">asked upstream</a> to remove
this unused helper, but we’ve been told that this is not a mistake, but on
purpose. They want to protect against the following attack scenario: a user
leaves their computer alone and unlocked, a random person gets by and, of all
things, wants to change KWalletManager’s settings. To prevent this from
happening, the GUI is asking the service helper to authenticate the action
requiring Polkit’s <code>auth_self</code> authorization, and doesn’t continue if this
fails.</p>

<p>This cannot stop a real attacker, though, since the KWalletManager
configuration is stored in the unprivileged user’s home directory and can
still be edited directly, or using a modified version of KWalletManager that
simply does not ask for this authentication. Not to talk about <em>all the other
things</em> that an attacker could do in such a situation. So where should one
draw a line to stop? We don’t even see this as a hardening, it is fake security
and confusing. If such a fake authentication is really needed then at least a
way should be found to implement it, without requiring an authentication helper
running as <code>root</code> that does nothing. Upstream seems to disagree, but we asked our
packagers to remove this logic from our packaging via patches.</p>

<h2 id="improvements-in-drkonqi">Improvements in DrKonqi</h2>

<p>DrKonqi is KDE’s crash handling utility. These days, it interacts with
systemd-coredump to access core dumps of applications. Our <a href="https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1203493">previous 2022
review</a> of it led to <a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/12/21/3">a finding in
systemd-coredump itself</a>. In the meantime DrKonqi
obtained additional D-Bus service logic to copy a private core dump (e.g. from
a process that was running as <code>root</code>) into the session of an unprivileged user
for analysis.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://invent.kde.org/plasma/drkonqi/-/blob/Plasma/6.0/src/coredump/polkit/main.cpp?ref_type=heads#L34">implementation of this</a> is unusual for a KDE component
in so far as it doesn’t rely on KAuth: it directly uses the Qt framework’s D-Bus
and Polkit facilities. The likely reason for this is the shortcoming of KAuth
with regard to passing file descriptors, as discussed above. The single
<code>excavateFromToDirFd()</code> D-Bus method actually accepts a file descriptor.
It is supposed to be a file descriptor referring to a directory under control
of the unprivileged caller, where the selected core dump is to be copied to.
Even though this means that DrKonqi cannot benefit from the common framework
features of KAuth, it is security-wise a good example of how to improve the
robustness of a D-Bus service running as <code>root</code> and operating in the file
system.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, even with file descriptors issues can arise, as this example
also shows. The permission handling for directories is different from regular
files. Directories generally can only be opened in read-only mode
(<code>O_RDONLY</code>). Write permissions are only checked at the time a write attempt
is made, like when calling <code>renameat()</code> in the case of the DrKonqi helper.
This is too late. The unprivileged caller can open just any directory it has
read access for and pass it to the D-Bus service. The D-Bus service running as
<code>root</code> will now happily create new files in the directory even if the caller
doesn’t have any write permissions for it.</p>

<p>There is a <a href="https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1220190#c6">constructive discussion</a> discussion going on
with upstream that led to various improvements in detail in this D-Bus service
<a href="https://invent.kde.org/plasma/drkonqi/-/merge_requests/217">that are about to be merged</a>. The issue with the dir file
descriptor was only found late in the process, but hopefully a solution for
the problem will be found soon.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>D-Bus and Polkit have their share of complexities that need to be understood
and managed well. This is important as a defense in depth measure even beyond
the local security of a Linux system. Putting additional layers on top, like in
the KAuth framework, can cause long-term problems, as can be seen from the lack
of support for passing file descriptors with the current KAuth API.</p>

<p>It was helpful that our KDE packagers and upstream approached us early about
the KDE6 release candidate and the changes it introduces. In some areas, like
the badly generated D-Bus KAuth configuration files, upstream quickly reacted
and applied fixes, thus avoiding that the problematic code was ever released
in a production version of KDE6. In other areas, like the legacy fontinst
D-Bus service or the sddm-kcm D-Bus service, the complexity of fixing API
issues has obviously been too high for upstream to come up with something
better in time. We decided not to ask for CVE assignments for the findings in
these services, since the attack vectors are not reachable to regular users in
the default Polkit configuration.</p>

<p>By now most KDE6 packages should have reached openSUSE Tumbleweed and can be
used in production.</p>

Saved Ethernet - IEEE Spectrum"><p>I’ve enjoyed reading magazine articles about Ethernet’s 50th anniversary, including one in the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/ethernet-ieee-milestone" target="_self"><em>The Institute</em></a>. Invented by computer scientists <a href="https://ethw.org/Robert_M._Metcalfe" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Robert Metcalfe</a> and <a href="https://ethw.org/David_Boggs" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">David Boggs</a>, Ethernet has been extraordinarily impactful. Metcalfe, an IEEE Fellow, received the 1996 <a href="https://corporate-awards.ieee.org/recipients/ieee-medal-of-honor-recipients/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IEEE Medal of Honor</a> as well as the 2022 <a href="https://amturing.acm.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Turing Award</a> from the <a href="https://www.acm.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Association for Computing Machinery</a> for his work. But there is more to the story that is not widely known.</p><p>During the 1980s and early 1990s, I led <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Equipment_Corporation" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Digital Equipment Corp.</a>’s networking advanced development group in Massachusetts. I was a firsthand witness in what was a period of great opportunity for LAN technologies and intense competition between standardization efforts.</p><p>DEC, <a href="https://www.google.com/aclk?sa=l&amp;ai=DChcSEwi2hOvzgu-EAxWZH60GHXwkAToYABAAGgJwdg&amp;ase=2&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw-r-vBhC-ARIsAGgUO2DU3b9FN2WnvoVFOiwwrcDDz5q7PPS2MiSG6DRs-u-xJc9j5_yBWkcaAn2LEALw_wcB&amp;ei=dHLwZY3bOdDB0PEP7_WwiAU&amp;sig=AOD64_3OM2YVYFwaHUS5T6_5SPLa3qL80Q&amp;q&amp;sqi=2&amp;nis=4&amp;adurl&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiN5ePzgu-EAxXQIDQIHe86DFEQ0Qx6BAgIEAE" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Intel</a>, and <a href="https://www.xerox.com/en-us/about" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Xerox</a> poised themselves to profit from Ethernet’s launch in the 1970s. But during the 1980s other LAN technologies emerged as competitors. Prime contenders included the <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/efficiency-of-token-ring/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">token ring</a>, promoted by <a href="https://www.ibm.com/about" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IBM</a>, and the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/token-bus" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">token bus</a>. (Today Ethernet and both token-based technologies are part of the <a href="https://www.ieee802.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IEEE 802</a> family of standards.)</p><p>All those LANs have some basic parts in common. One is the 48-bit media access control (MAC) address, a unique number assigned during a computer’s network port manufacturing process. The MAC addresses are used inside the LAN only, but they are critical to its operation. And usually, along with the general-purpose computers on the network, they have at least one special-purpose computer: a router, whose main job is to send data to—and receive it from—the Internet on behalf of all the other computers on the LAN.</p><p>In a decades-old conceptual model of networking, the LAN itself (the wires and low-level hardware) is referred to as Layer 2, or the data link layer. Routers mostly deal with another kind of address: a network address that is used both within the LAN and outside it. Many readers likely have heard the terms <em>Internet Protocol</em> and <em>IP address</em>. With some exceptions, the IP address (a network address) in a data packet is sufficient to ensure that packet can be delivered anywhere on the Internet by a sequence of other routers operated by service providers and carriers. Routers and the operations they perform are referred to as Layer 3, or the network layer.</p><p>In a token ring LAN, shielded twisted-pair copper wires connect each computer to its upstream and downstream neighbors in an endless ring structure. Each computer forwards data from its upstream neighbor to its downstream one but can send its own data to the network only after it receives a short data packet—a token—from the upstream neighbor. If it has no data to transmit, it just passes the token to its downstream neighbor, and so on.</p><p>In a token bus LAN, a coaxial cable connects all the network’s computers, but the wiring doesn’t control the order in which the computers pass the token. The computers agree on the sequence in which they pass the token, forming an endless virtual ring around which data and tokens circulate.</p><p>Ethernet, meanwhile, had become synonymous with coaxial cable connections that used a method called <em>carrier sense multiple access with collision detection</em> for managing transmissions. In the CSMA/CD method, computers that want to transmit a data packet first listen to see if another computer is transmitting. If not, the computer sends its packet while listening to determine whether that packet collides with one from another computer. Collisions can happen because signal propagation between computers is not instantaneous. In the case of a collision, the sending computer resends its packet with a delay that has both a random component and an exponentially increasing component that depends on the number of collisions.</p><p>The need to detect collisions involves tradeoffs among data rate, physical length, and minimum packet size. Increasing the data rate by an order of magnitude means either reducing the physical length or increasing the minimum packet size by roughly the same factor. The designers of Ethernet had wisely chosen a sweet spot among the tradeoffs: 10 megabits per second and a length of 1,500 meters. </p><h2>A threat from fiber</h2><p>Meanwhile, a coalition of companies—including my employer, DEC—was developing a new ANSI LAN standard: the <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/FDDI" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Fiber Distributed Data Interface</a>. The FDDI approach used a variation of the token bus protocol to transmit data over optical fiber, promising speeds of 100 Mb/s, far faster than Ethernet’s 10 Mb/s.</p><p>A barrage of technical publications released analyses of the throughputs and latencies of competing LAN technologies under various workloads. Given the results and the much greater network performance demands expected from speedier processors, RAM, and nonvolatile storage, Ethernet’s limited performance was a serious problem.</p><p>FDDI seemed a better bet for creating higher speed LANs than Ethernet, although FDDI used expensive components and complex technology, especially for fault recovery. But all shared media access protocols had one or more unattractive features or performance limitations, thanks to the complexity involved in sharing a wire or optical fiber.</p><h2>A solution emerges</h2><p>I thought that a better approach than either FDDI or a faster version of Ethernet would be to develop a LAN technology that performed store-and-forward switching.</p><p>One evening in 1983, just before leaving work to go home, I visited the office of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mark-kempf-4a2668b7" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mark Kempf</a>, a principal engineer and a member of my team. Mark, one of the best engineers I have ever worked with, had designed the popular and profitable DECServer 100 terminal server, which used the local-area transport (LAT) protocol created by Bruce Mann from DEC’s corporate architecture group. Terminal servers connect groups of dumb terminals, with only RS-232 serial ports, to computer systems with Ethernet ports.</p><p>I told Mark about my idea of using store-and-forward switching to increase LAN performance.</p><p>The next morning he came in with an idea for a learning bridge (also known as a Layer 2 switch or simply a switch). The bridge would connect to two Ethernet LANs. By listening to all traffic on each LAN, the device would learn the MAC addresses of the computers on both Ethernets (remembering which computer was on which Ethernet) and then selectively forward the appropriate packets between the LANs based upon the destination MAC address. The computers on the two networks didn’t need to know which path their data would take on the extended LAN; to them, the bridge was invisible.</p><p>The bridge would need to receive and process some 30,000 packets per second (15,000 pp/s per Ethernet) and decide whether to forward each one. Although the 30,000 pp/s requirement was near the limit of what could be done using the best microprocessor technology of the time, the Motorola 68000, Mark was confident he could build a two-Ethernet bridge using only off-the-shelf components including a specialized hardware engine he would design using programmable array logic (PAL) devices and dedicated static RAM to look up the 48-bit MAC addresses.</p><p>Mark’s contributions have not been widely recognized. One exception is the textbook <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Network-Algorithmics-Interdisciplinary-Designing-Networking/dp/0120884771" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Network Algorithmics</em></a> by George Varghese.</p><p>In a misconfigured network—one with bridges connecting Ethernets in a loop—packets could circulate forever. We felt confident that we could figure out a way to prevent that. In a pinch, a product could ship without the safety feature. And clearly a two-port device was only the starting point. Multiple-port devices could follow, though they would require custom components.</p><p>I took our idea to three levels of management, looking for approval to build a prototype of the learning bridge that Mark envisioned. Before the end of the day, we had a green light with the understanding that a product would follow if the prototype was successful.</p><h2>Developing the bridge</h2><p>My immediate manager at DEC, Tony Lauck, challenged several engineers and architects to solve the problem of packet looping in misconfigured networks. Within a few days, we had several potential solutions. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radia_Perlman" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Radia Perlman</a>, an architect in Tony’s group, provided the clear winner: the spanning tree protocol.</p><p>In Perlman’s approach, the bridges detect each other, select a root bridge according to specified criteria, and then compute a minimum spanning tree. An MST is a mathematical structure that, in this case, describes how to efficiently connect LANs and bridges without loops. The MST was then used to place any bridge whose presence would create a loop into backup mode. As a side benefit, it provided automated recovery in the case of a bridge failure.</p><p><img id="53825" data-rm-shortcode-id="994b2afc7011f34ffd78cc678663b727" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-big-green-box-with-little-boxes-within-with-gold-dots-and-different-colored-wires.jpg?id=51927566&amp;width=980" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-big-green-box-with-little-boxes-within-with-gold-dots-and-different-colored-wires.jpg?id=51927566&amp;width=980" width="3000" height="2250" alt="a big green box with little boxes within with gold dots and different colored wires"><small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">The logic module of a disassembled LANBridge 100, which was released by Digital Equipment Corp. in 1986. </small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Alan Kirby</small></p><p>Mark designed the hardware and timing-sensitive low-level code, while software engineer Bob Shelly wrote the remaining programs. And in 1986, DEC introduced the technology as the LANBridge 100, product code DEBET-AA.</p><p>Soon after, DEC developed DEBET-RC, a version that supported a 3-kilometer optical fiber span between bridges. Manuals for some of the DEBET-RCs can be found on the <a href="https://bitsavers.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bitsavers website</a>.</p><p>Mark’s idea didn’t replace Ethernet—and that was its brilliance. By allowing store-and-forward switching between existing CSMA/CD coax-based Ethernets, bridges allowed easy upgrades of existing LANs. Since any collision would not propagate beyond the bridge, connecting two Ethernets with a bridge would immediately double the length limit of a single Ethernet cable alone. More importantly, placing computers that communicated heavily with each other on the same Ethernet cable would isolate that traffic to that cable, while the bridge would still allow communication with computers on other Ethernet cables.</p><p>That reduced the traffic on both cables, increasing capacity while reducing the frequency of collisions. Taken to its limit, it eventually meant giving each computer its own Ethernet cable, with a multiport bridge connecting them all.</p><p>That is what led to a gradual migration away from CSMA/CD over coax to the now ubiquitous copper and fiber links between individual computers and a dedicated switch port.</p><p>The speed of the links is no longer limited by the constraints of collision detection. Over time, the change completely transformed how people think of Ethernet.</p><p>A bridge could even have ports for different LAN types if the associated packet headers were sufficiently similar.</p><p>Our team later developed GIGAswitch, a multiport device supporting both Ethernet and FDDI.</p><p>The existence of bridges with increasingly higher performance took the wind out of the sails of those developing new shared media LAN access protocols. FDDI later faded from the marketplace in the face of faster Ethernet versions.</p><p>Bridge technology was not without controversy, of course. Some engineers continue to believe that Layer 2 switching is a bad idea and that all you need are faster Layer 3 routers to transfer packets between LANs. At the time, however, IP had not won at the network level, and DECNet, IBM’s SNA, and other network protocols were fighting for dominance. Switching at Layer 2 would work with any network protocol.</p><p>Mark received a <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US4597078A/en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">U.S. patent</a> for the device in 1986. DEC offered to license it on a no-cost basis, allowing any company to use the technology.</p><p>That led to an IEEE standardization effort. Established networking companies and startups adopted and began working to improve the switching technology. Other enhancements—including switch-specific ASICs, virtual LANs, and the development of faster and less expensive physical media and associated electronics—steadily contributed to Ethernet’s longevity and popularity.</p><p>The lasting value of Ethernet lies not in CSMA/CD or its original coaxial media but in the easily understood and functional service that it provided for protocol designers.</p><p>The switches in many home networks today are directly descended from the innovation. And modern data centers have numerous switches with individual ports running between 40 and 800 gigabits per second. The data center switch market alone accounts for more than US $10 billion in annual revenue.</p><p>Lauck, my DEC manager, once said that the value of an architecture can be measured by the number of technology generations over which it is useful. By that measure, Ethernet has been enormously successful. The same can be said of Layer 2 switching.</p><p>No one knows what would have happened to Ethernet had Mark not invented the learning bridge. Perhaps someone else would have come up with the idea. But it’s also possible that Ethernet would have slowly withered away.</p><p>To me, Mark saved Ethernet.</p></div></div>]]></description>

				<p id="speakable-summary"><span>When I started</span> working from home in the late 1980s as a freelance technical writer, I was clearly an outlier. Even contractors mostly went into the office in those days. Over time, though, that slowly changed, and the pandemic — along with generationally shifting views on work-life balance — accelerated worker sentiment away from going into a formal office every day, even if some CEOs wish it weren’t so.</p>
<p>Today, 14% of U.S. workers work at home full time (including me), and that number is expected to <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/money/blueprint/business/hr-payroll/remote-work-statistics/">increase to 20% by next year</a>, according to data published by USA Today. In total, 58% of white collar employees want flexibility in their work schedules to work at home a few days a week, per that same USA Today data. Yet, we are continually getting post-pandemic mixed messages about returning to the office.</p>
<p>Some companies like <a href="https://www.crn.com/news/cloud/2024/ibm-orders-more-employees-to-spend-time-in-the-office">IBM</a> and Amazon have been pushing hard to get people back to the office, with Amazon CEO Andy Jassy reportedly telling employees if they wanted to stay remote, it probably <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/08/29/amazon-ceo-andy-jassy-return-to-office-mandate-or-face-consequences/">wouldn’t work out well</a> for them. Wayfair, the Boston-based online furniture company, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/wayfair-layoffs-focused-on-remote-workers-9ec2f037">concentrated on remote workers </a>over in-office folks in a layoff earlier this year, according to a WSJ report.</p>
<p>Big tech CEOs like Jassy and Elon Musk have been pushing back hard against remote work; Musk called it <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/16/elon-musk-work-from-home-morally-wrong-when-some-have-to-show-up.html">“morally wrong”</a> for some people to work at home while service workers had to show up. Meanwhile <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/michael-bloomberg-implies-remote-workers-golfing-must-return-to-office-2023-9">Michael Bloomberg suggested</a> remote workers weren’t actually working, but playing golf (which honestly sounds like projecting to me). Even Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, whose company pushed the notion of a digital HQ during the pandemic, began <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/19/benioffs-reported-slack-statement-muddles-message-about-salesforces-view-of-wfh/">preaching about a return to the office</a>, blaming working from home for lack of productivity, especially among new employees.</p>
<p>That’s a lot of executive energy being directed against working from home and toward working in the office. Some have suggested that it’s because these companies have invested heavily in office buildings and need people to fill them. Maybe it’s just a need to have the employees in front of managers for control purposes, or they genuinely believe that workers are more productive in the office. Whatever the reason, they seem quite committed to getting back to the office.</p>
<p>Do they have a point? Will workers be more productive under the watchful eye of their managers sitting in cubicles instead of the comfort of their homes? Perhaps more importantly to results-driven CEOs, will their companies make more money? Research from the University of Pittsburgh Katz School of Business published earlier this year <a href="https://business.pitt.edu/return-to-office-mandates-dont-improve-employee-or-company-performance/">suggests not necessarily</a>.</p>
<p>“Our findings are consistent with employees’ concerns that managers use RTO (return to office mandates) for power grabbing and blaming employees for poor performance. We provide evidence that RTO mandates hurt employee satisfaction but do not improve firm performance,” the report found.</p>
<p>Karen Mangia, president and chief strategy officer at the Engineered Innovation Group, who has studied and written extensively about remote work, says she was surprised to find that workers tended to value flexibility over place; it wasn’t so much where you needed to be, so much as your ability to control when you worked, to maintain a proper work-life balance.</p>
<p>“All of the research I’ve been looking at shows the same thing: that employees who have some degree of flexibility over where and when they work, are reporting higher levels of employee engagement. That is the group of people that is demonstrating to be more engaged and more productive,” she said.</p>
<p>What’s more, Mangia has found that those companies forcing employees to go back to the office are unsurprisingly having to deal with more employee burnout. “The argument so many times behind this return to office mandate is that employees will be more productive because we can collaborate in person and, and things get done. Well, being burnt out and sustaining a burnout level is the opposite of being more productive,” she said.</p>
<p>There are also good reasons to encourage hiring more remote employees, including access to a much broader and diverse employee base than you could get from one geographical location.</p>
<p>“I’ve had a big Midwestern consumer packaged goods company say ‘we’re finding all sorts of talent. Whereas before we insisted all employees must be local or must be in the city, now we’ve opened it up more broadly, and we got way better candidates. We don’t ever want to go back and we’re going to open that up permanently,’” said Dion Hinchcliffe, an analyst at Constellation Research, who has been watching this trend for a long time.</p>
<p>The next debate is how much, if any, time should employees be required to spend in the office and for what reasons. There are many tech companies that are leaving it up to their employees to decide where they want to work, and it seems to work quite well.</p>
<p>Gitlab is a prime example of a company that has been fully remote from the day it was founded a decade ago. Other tech companies with a flexible approach include Dropbox, Atlassian and Okta, none of which require a specific number of days in the office.</p>
<p>As for startups, anecdotally the vast majority of founders I speak to are remote first. Hinchcliffe says this is part of a shift to a decentralized workplace where startups in particular avoid the regular overhead of having an office. Instead they often rent space in the WeWork model to get together with customers, press and analysts, or each other, as needed.</p>
<p>Mangia says that the one worker demographic that does tend to struggle in all-virtual environments is new hires out of college, who benefit from being in an office. “When you have new-hire employees, especially early in their career, they do ramp up faster and report a better experience with a lower degree of burnout when they can come into a place where there are other people to help them,” she said, giving some credence to what Benioff was saying.</p>
<p>Even the most ardent work-from-home advocates understand there will be times when there is value in getting together for team building, to meet customers or to collaborate and brainstorm in person, but in spite of the cries from big CEOs, employees have tasted this flexibility, and it’s going to be hard to get the genie back in the bottle. For now, it continues to be a debate between labor and management about where and how work gets done.</p>
