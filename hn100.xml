<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
                    <p>No one wants to be the bad guy.</p><p>When narratives begin to shift and the once good guys are labelled as bad it's not surprising they fight back. They'll point to criticisms as exaggerations. Their faults as misunderstandings.</p><p>Today's freshly ordained bad guys are the investors and CEOs of Silicon Valley.</p><p>Once championed as the flagbearers of innovation and democratization, now they're viewed as new versions of the monopolies of old and they're fighting back.</p><p>The title of Paul Graham's essay, <a href="http://paulgraham.com/richnow.html?ref=keenen.xyz">How People Get Rich Now</a>, didn't prepare me for the real goal of his words. It's less a tutorial or analysis and more a thinly veiled attempt to ease concerns about wealth inequality.</p><blockquote>People who don't look any deeper than the Gini coefficient look back on the world of 1982 as the good old days, because those who got rich then didn't get as rich. But if you dig into <em>how</em> they got rich, the old days don't look so good. In 1982, 84% of the richest 100 people got rich by inheritance, extracting natural resources, or doing real estate deals. Is that really better than a world in which the richest people get rich by starting tech companies?</blockquote><p>What he fails to mention is that concerns about wealth inequality aren't concerned with how wealth was generated but rather the growing wealth gap that has accelerated in recent decades. Tech has made startups both cheaper and easier but only for a small percentage of people. And when a select group of people have an advantage that others don't it's compounded over time.</p><blockquote>Once you understand how these mechanisms work, and that startups were suppressed for most of the 20th century, you don't have to resort to some vague right turn the country took under Reagan to explain why America's Gini coefficient is increasing. Of course the Gini coefficient is increasing. With more people starting more valuable companies, how could it not be?</blockquote><figure><img src="https://keenen.xyz/content/images/2021/04/image.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1274" height="886" srcset="https://keenen.xyz/content/images/size/w600/2021/04/image.png 600w, https://keenen.xyz/content/images/size/w1000/2021/04/image.png 1000w, https://keenen.xyz/content/images/2021/04/image.png 1274w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Paul paints a rosy picture but doesn't mention that incomes for lower and middle-class families have fallen since the 80s. This golden age of entrepreneurship hasn't benefitted the vast majority of people and the increase in the Gini coefficient isn't simply that more companies are being started. The rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer.</p><figure><img src="https://keenen.xyz/content/images/2021/04/image-1.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="848" height="830" srcset="https://keenen.xyz/content/images/size/w600/2021/04/image-1.png 600w, https://keenen.xyz/content/images/2021/04/image-1.png 848w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><blockquote>You would think, after having been on the side of labor in its fight with capital for almost two centuries, that the far left would be happy that labor has finally prevailed. But none of them seem to be. You can almost hear them saying "No, no, not <em>that</em> way."</blockquote><p>And there we have it. The slight injection of his true ideology relegated to the notes section and vague enough that some might ignore. But keep in mind this is the same guy who argued <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/wtax.html?ref=keenen.xyz">against a wealth tax</a>. His seemingly impartial and logical writing attempts to hide his true intentions.</p><p>Is this really about how people get rich or why we should all be happy that people like PG are getting richer while tons of people and struggling to meet their basic needs. Wealth inequality is just a radical left fairy tale to villainize the hard-working 1%. We could all be rich too, it's so much easier now. Just pull yourself up by your bootstraps.</p><p>There's no question that it's easier now than ever to start a new business and reach your market. The internet has had a democratizing effect in this regard. But it's also obvious to anyone outside the SV bubble that it's still only accessible to a small minority of people. Most people don't have the safety net or mental bandwidth to even consider entrepreneurship. It is not a panacea for the masses.</p><p>But to use that fact to push the false claim that wealth inequality is solely due to more startups and not a real problem says a lot. This essay is less about how people get rich and more about why it's okay that people like PG are getting rich. They're better than the richest people of 1960. And we can join them. We just need to stop complaining and just be rich instead.</p>

<p>No rolling blackouts or grid emergencies as California continues on path to a carbon free grid.   Several strategies, including upgrades to vulnerable parts of the grid at play here, but key enabler is more clean energy, especially solar, and above all, battery storage, now equivalent to 5 very large nuclear power plants.<br></p>

<p>In fact, California seems to have reached a level of storage that is creating some kind of a phase-change in the grid, yielding benefits that are surprising even expert observers.  More and more days where renewables supply greater-than 100 percent of California’s power – enabling exports even under these challenging conditions.</p>

        <p>I retired in 2021 at 63.5 after about four decades as a programmer. What made me do this was not failing ability in any way, but after a year of consideration, I realized I didn't care to do it anymore.</p><p>Everyone will eventually reach a point at which they can no longer do what they spent their lives doing—but it's not just about retirement; it can happen at any time earlier as well. I've known people much younger than me who became obsolete due to their chosen technology going away or people who simply got tired of writing code or, more commonly, doing it as a job.</p><p>Of course its not only programmers, it happens in everything including sports where professionals keep playing beyond their ability (often to make a bunch more money), and even politicians who exceed their limit (currently on view as both US Presidential candidates should not run but won't quit). It can be that you cannot do it anymore, have a lack of desire, a bad job market, obsolete technology, or are discovering something else worth doing. In my life, I've seen all of those.</p><p>I knew a young programmer a decade ago who left his CS degree because he was making tons of money shipping mobile apps, he even wrote a book on it, and started several companies. But he burned out and discovered he no longer cared, started a Jeep dealership, then started a land clearing business (riding bulldozers all day) and enjoyed all of that more, plus had more consistent success.</p><p>I knew someone who got a CS degree when I was getting my Chemistry degree and spent his career writing only mainframe systems code. Eventually, the mainframe was abandoned, and he had not learned anything else, so he had to work installing network cables. Another team at a place where I worked bragged about how great their technology was (4GL tools generating RPG2); a year later, they were out of a job, and the tool was obsolete. Sometimes, the world passes you by.</p><p>You probably don't know any retired programmers—back in the early 80s, when I started, there was only a tiny percentage of programmers compared to today, and over the decades, many gave up, became managers, or became obsolete. So, not many remained writing code long enough to end their career still writing code. Among those who I knew that started when I did, all that remained forty years later were doing legacy work; I was the only one still working on the leading edge of things (in my case, iOS in Swift for a very large company). It's hard to sustain a career that long in an industry with insane amounts of change.</p><p>All of you reading this (programmers anyway) will eventually hit a point where you can't do the job anymore for one of the above reasons. It's important to be honest with yourself. Are you keeping up to date sufficiently to continue the job? Is the job even interesting anymore, or is there something else you would rather do? Maybe your programming is not fun, or perhaps it's no longer challenging enough. Despite how unfulfilling it is, I've known people who enjoy the paycheck, do boring work, and keep doing it. That's a choice, but I was never satisfied with that.</p><p>It's not only quitting programming that you might consider; the biggest reason to quit may be that your job is not worth doing and that you need to find another one. I've quit perfectly good jobs (and some terrible ones) because I did not find the work interesting, the direction terrible, or a hostile workplace. Naturally, some employers went out of business or laid people off, but I left those jobs involuntarily! A different kind of programming or a different industry could revive your interest. The key is still to be honest with yourself. I've known people who left a high-pressure, high-salary job, started a farm, or began a different career. It's not worth working and being miserable.</p><p>Some time ago, I knew a programmer with the same number of years of experience as me. Yet he seemed unable to comprehend what was required of him, and I had to review everything he wrote because it rarely worked; for example, he would copy and paste code but include extra lines that did nothing. I still have no idea how you can work for 30 years and be unable to do even simple things.</p><p>None of this says that you should discriminate against people simply due to their age. Age and ability are not correlated. I've known people older than me who were brilliant and some that were incapable, like the previous person. I've seen 20-year-olds who could write anything successfully and others who did not understand simple concepts. Thankfully, I saw little age discrimination besides a few interviews where the interviewer had that look on their face: "Oh no, an old guy." Especially in my last three employers (covering about a decade), each valued everything I did.</p><p>When I announced my retirement (with three months' warning), my leaders were shocked. They couldn't comprehend why anyone would retire. One of them, whom I had worked for for two of those jobs and always made his life easier, never spoke to me again or even said goodbye. I still talk with some of my peers and team, and knowing how downhill the work has gone since (although the money got really good), I would have left anyway. I like making a difference and being challenged to do things and work that matters. Money is nice, but I liked making that difference.</p><p>Everyone eventually reaches a point where a job, an employer, an industry, or even their entire career ends. It feels better to be honest and make an informed decision rather than discover you are falling behind and possibly being forced out. It feels better to leave a bad job instead of hanging on until your hair falls out, even if the next job is equally terrible (I've been there). Your career is yours; it's up to you to make the most of it, even if you end it.</p><p>I still write code every day in support of my <a href="https://digcon.art/?ref=thecodist.com">generative art practice</a>. The code is much more complex than anything I did previously, and much of it does not have anyone else doing it, so it's a lot of invention, which is fun. While I miss certain aspects of my final job, I don't miss the eternal pressure, long hours, bad executive decision-making, and endless changes. I do miss being a leader and seeing things we wrote being used by our many customers. </p><p>Programming can be a fun career, a horrible nightmare, or something in between, and it never stands still. I enjoyed the good parts, tolerated the bad, and switched technologies, industries, and employers often enough to keep it going for four decades. That's long enough.</p>

<p>We are all familiar with GPS (Global Positioning System) and its myriad applications. From getting directions using Google maps to hailing&nbsp;a ride using a ride&nbsp;sharing app, countless individuals and businesses rely on accurate position estimation&nbsp;using GPS. Position estimation using GPS is now so accurate that GPS is being used for measuring plate tectonics and continental drift. Indeed, GPS is so much a part of our lives that few of us stop and wonder how it actually works. The purpose of this post is to show you how. &nbsp;More specifically, we’ll first learn how position is calculated from range measurements to GPS satellites and then consider a concrete example where we’ll process raw data collected by a commercial GPS receiver to obtain user position estimates.</p>
<p>GPS is owned by the US government and operated by the US air force. As such, access to GPS data can be degraded or denied to other nations due to geopolitical concerns. For example, according to this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System">wikipedia article</a>, access to GPS data was denied to the Indian military during the Kargil conflict. Other countries therefore decided to implement their own GPS like systems. Examples are GLONASS by Russia, Galileo by the European Union and BeiDou by China. This may seem like a waste of resources, but many of these systems operate using the same standards as GPS and are interoperable. For example, latest GPS receivers can receive signals from both GPS and GLONASS satellites, improving positioning accuracy. The wikipedia article referenced above also provides an interesting history of the origins of the GPS system dating back to Sputnik, the first man made satellite launched in space.</p>
<p>The post is divided into 3 parts – the first part describes the&nbsp;various coordinate systems used to express position. An understanding of these coordinate systems is essential for understanding how GPS works and is useful in its own right. For example, the concept of height above the earth surface is something that people intuitively understand, but turns out to be tricky idea to precisely define. The second part describes the basic principle of triangulation used by GPS to calculate position&nbsp;and develops the mathematics for calculating the user position from satellite measurements. A casual user, interested in a general knowledge of how GPS operates but not in the details can read part 1 and the first few sections of part 2 before the math starts. &nbsp;Finally, the appendix provides the Matlab code for implementing various ideas discussed in this post.</p>
<p>Most of the information in this post derives from the book “Global Positioning Systems: Signals, Measurements and Performance”&nbsp;<span id="as0cu2o0u8" data-reflist="[&quot;a5of4cpcm&quot;]" data-footnote="undefined"><sup>1</sup></span>, an excellent book about GPS systems. The matlab code presented in this post was written as solutions to the various end of chapter problems in the book. I also make use of material in the GPS Interface Specification document<span id="adssc1bn88" data-reflist="[&quot;g1c8p8q7oq&quot;]" data-footnote="undefined"><sup>2</sup></span>. My contribution is to present the keys ideas related to GPS in a (hopefully) clear and concise manner and show&nbsp;the Matlab code that implements the positioning algorithms on real world data collected using commercial GPS receivers that can be purchased from the internet. After reading this post, a casual reader&nbsp;should have a better understanding of GPS, so the next time they use Google maps on their phone, they are aware of the amazing&nbsp;technical infrastructure that makes positioning and navigation applications possible. A more technical reader&nbsp;should be able to replicate my experiments by collecting their own data and running the Matlab code.</p>

<h2><span id="Part_1"><strong>Part 1</strong></span></h2>
<p>The fundamental task of a GPS system is to calculate position. To do so, we must first define what position means. Most people think about latitude/longitude and height when they think about position. While latitude/longitude are useful to represent a position on the earth surface, they are not suitable for mathematical calculations as they don’t provide a cartesian coordinate system. The physical distance represented by a unit difference between two longitudes is not constant, and depends on the position. For example, the distance between two longitudes one degree apart is greatest&nbsp;at the equator and approaches 0 at the poles.</p>
<p id="jOXWgSj"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.telesens.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img_596cb025bd6b0.png" alt="" width="312" height="293" srcset="https://www.telesens.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img_596cb025bd6b0.png 540w, https://www.telesens.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img_596cb025bd6b0-300x282.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 312px) 100vw, 312px"></p>
<p>To be useful for mathematical calculations, a coordinate system where a unit difference between coordinates represents a constant physical distance is required. A family of such coordinate systems can be created by defining a set of perpendicular axes intersecting at an origin that is rigidly attached to the earth. Such coordinate systems are called “ECEF” (Earth Centered, Earth Fixed). These coordinate systems work well to express the position of a user on earth as they rotate with the earth and the position of a stationary user on the earth surface is constant.</p>
<p>The most commonly used ECEF&nbsp;coordinate system is called the WGS 1984 system developed by the department of defense. WGS 84 is an ECEF frame, defined as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Origin at the center of mass of the earth</li>
<li>z axis passing through the&nbsp;<em>CTP&nbsp;</em>(Conventional Terrestrial Pole). CTP is the average of the earth’s pole’s position between the years 1900 and 1905. An average needs to be used as the position of the pole is not fixed and wanders around in a circle of radius ~15m.</li>
<li>x axis passing through the intersection of the CTP’s equatorial plane and a reference meridian, often called the <em>Mean Greenwich Meridian</em></li>
</ul>
<p>ECEF frames are convenient to represent positions with respect to the earth, but they are not inertial as they are rigidly attached to a spinning earth. To formulate the problem of satellite motion around the earth in accordance with Newton’s laws of motion, we need an inertial coordinate system in which to express acceleration, position and velocity vectors.</p>
<p id="ZiESHUc"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://www.telesens.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img_596cbb5fe5f62.png" alt="" width="504" height="381" srcset="https://www.telesens.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img_596cbb5fe5f62.png 800w, https://www.telesens.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img_596cbb5fe5f62-300x227.png 300w, https://www.telesens.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img_596cbb5fe5f62-768x581.png 768w, https://www.telesens.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img_596cbb5fe5f62-326x245.png 326w, https://www.telesens.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img_596cbb5fe5f62-80x60.png 80w" sizes="(max-width: 504px) 100vw, 504px"></p>
<p>An inertial frame can be defined in a manner similar to the ECEF frame except that the x-axis points to the vernal equinox (the direction of intersection of the equatorial plane of the earth with the plane of the earth’s orbit around the sun). Strictly speaking, this frame isn’t inertial either since the earth is moving around the sun. However, it can be considered inertial over short periods (just as the ECEF frame can be considered inertial for analyzing the movement of a body on earth over a short period).</p>
<p>In the rest of this post, we’ll be using the WGS 84 ECEF frame to express the user and satellite position. This is possible because the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.gps.gov/technical/icwg/IS-GPS-200H.pdf">GPS interface specification document</a>&nbsp;(referred to as GPS-IS in the rest of this post) provides a step by step procedure to calculate the satellite position in the ECEF frame at a given time instant that accounts for the non-inertial nature of the ECEF frame. This is fortunate because ECEF frames are ideal to express the position of a user on the surface of the earth as they rotate with the earth and thus the position of a stationary user is constant, as one would expect. This would not be the case if an inertial reference frame is used to express position as such a frame would be fixed in space, and thus would appear rotating with respect to the earth.</p>
<p>Let’s now turn to the issue of defining height that we alluded to earlier. The key question that needs to be answered when defining height is “with respect to what”? Consider for example the height of a point in a desert. If we define height to be the distance of the point from the “ground”, then such a height would change constantly as the level of the ground itself changes due to natural phenomenon&nbsp;(for example, the wind depositing more sand). &nbsp;Thus, to define height, we must first define “ground” (note that strictly speaking, this issue doesn’t arise in a ECEF reference frame, as all distances are measured with respect to the center of mass of the earth. However generally people are not interested in distance from&nbsp;the center of the earth, but from the local earth surface). To define “ground” in a consistent manner, we need a model for the surface of the earth. Two models are generally used:</p>
<h3><span id="Model_1_Reference_Ellipsoid"><strong>Model 1: Reference Ellipsoid</strong></span></h3>
<p>The surface of the earth is modeled as an oblate ellipse called the “reference ellipsoid”, centered at the earth’s center with the axis of revolution coincident with the z axis of an ECEF frame. The lengths of the semi-major and semi-minor axes (denoted as <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://www.telesens.co/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-5c53d6ebabdbcfa4e107550ea60b1b19_l3.png" alt="a" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="8" width="9"> and <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://www.telesens.co/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-f56d50c26583f9a035ff6b4e3c0ca5c0_l3.png" alt="b" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="13" width="8">) are <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://www.telesens.co/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-15d678f0603cd51a261d32c1134be9f2_l3.png" alt="a = 6378137m" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="14" width="111"> and <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://www.telesens.co/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-22702d21f7da674f49092f81e078357f_l3.png" alt="b = 6357002m" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="13" width="109">. As expected, the value generally used for earth’s radius (with the earth modeled as a sphere) is 6371Km which lies between the lengths of the semi-major and minor-axis. The reference ellipsoid is merely an abstraction for the shape of the earth. It doesn’t have any physical significance. An actual point on the earth surface will usually lie above or below the reference ellipsoid.</p>
<h3><span id="Model_2_Geoid"><strong>Model 2: Geoid</strong></span></h3>
<p>Another surface commonly used to measure height that does have physical significance is called the&nbsp;<em>geoid</em>. This surface is defined as the locus of all points with the same value of the gravitational potential. If the earth was a sphere with a uniform composition, this surface would be a regular surface that can be parameterized as a mathematical function. However since the earth is neither spherical nor uniform, the geoid is usually specified as a series of heights above the reference ellipsoid.&nbsp;Height relative to the geoid is called the orthometric height, or height above the mean sea level (MSL). This makes sense as if the oceans covered the surface of the earth, the shape of the oceans would be a close approximation to the geoid.&nbsp;Strictly speaking, the shape of the geoid itself is not fixed as the surface of the earth is constantly changing due to human activities and natural phenomenon. However given the bulk of the earth, these only have a negligible impact on the earth’s gravitational field and thus on the shape of the geoid.</p>
<p>Note that the height of the geoid is specified with respect to the reference ellipsoid and the height of a given point can be specified with respect to either. The relationship between the ellipsoid, geoid and the actual surface of the earth is shown below.</p>
<p id="AAykyRw"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://www.telesens.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img_596ce69d3e988.png" alt="" width="697" height="190" srcset="https://www.telesens.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img_596ce69d3e988.png 891w, https://www.telesens.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img_596ce69d3e988-300x82.png 300w, https://www.telesens.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img_596ce69d3e988-768x209.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 697px) 100vw, 697px"></p>
<h3><span id="Latitude_and_Longitude"><strong>Latitude and Longitude</strong></span></h3>
<p>Armed with an ellipsoidal representation of the shape of the earth and with an ECEF coordinate system, we can define the position of a point P in&nbsp;<em>ellipsoidal&nbsp;</em>coordinates (commonly known as latitude, longitude and height) as follows:</p>

<p>Note that the latitude is the angle between the equatorial plane and the line&nbsp;<em>perpendicular</em> to the surface of the ellipse at point P, not the line joining point P and the earth center (origin of the ECEF frame). Angle between the equatorial plane and the line joining point P and the earth center is called the <em>geocentric </em>(as opposed to geodetic) latitude. If the earth were a perfect sphere, the normal to a point would pass through the earth center and the geocentric and geodetic latitude would coincide.</p>
<p id="fQfkRYt"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://www.telesens.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img_596cec084e233.png" alt="" width="499" height="404" srcset="https://www.telesens.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img_596cec084e233.png 800w, https://www.telesens.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img_596cec084e233-300x243.png 300w, https://www.telesens.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img_596cec084e233-768x621.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 499px) 100vw, 499px"></p>
<h3><span id="Conversion_between_Geodetic_Ellipsoidal_and_Cartesion_Coordinates"><strong>Conversion between Geodetic (Ellipsoidal) and Cartesion Coordinates</strong></span></h3>
<p>Conversion from&nbsp;ellipsoidal to cartesian coordinates is straightforward and can be implemented in one step.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://www.telesens.co/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-1fa2534584e6b7d6bb0784d23f384753_l3.png" alt="\begin{bmatrix}x \\ y \\ z \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}(N+h)cos(\phi)cos(\lambda) \\ (N+h)cos(\phi)sin(\lambda) \\ (N(1-e^2)+h)sin(\phi) \end{bmatrix}" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="65" width="243"></p>
<p>Going from cartesian to ellipsoidal is trickier and involves an iterative procedure that quickly converges. See Appendix 4.A of <span id="a2qgvc6mnbe" data-reflist="[&quot;a5of4cpcm&quot;]" data-footnote="undefined"><sup>1</sup></span>&nbsp; for details. The corresponding Matlab code is listed in section 1.e of the appendix. The more common use case is&nbsp;to convert ECEF coordinates to ellipsoidal as the input and output of GPS processing algorithms are usually in ECEF coordinates.</p>
<h3><span id="Local_Coordinate_Systems"><strong>Local Coordinate Systems</strong></span></h3>
<p>So far, we have mostly talked about “global” coordinate systems, centered at the earth center. In some applications, it is more convenient to use local coordinate systems, centered on the user’s position. These coordinate systems are called East-North-Up (ENU) systems. Given the user’s position in elliptical coordinates (<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://www.telesens.co/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-5b2be26c0c1341f54b29baddda771346_l3.png" alt="\phi" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="16" width="11">: latitude, <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://www.telesens.co/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-2b5c45836864531b8e37025dabadd24a_l3.png" alt="\lambda" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="12" width="10">: longitude), user coordinates can be easily converted from a ECEF frame to a local ENU frame using the following matrix multiplication.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://www.telesens.co/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-a995d083b2be8e2893a7c3d3405ea53a_l3.png" alt="R_{ENU} = \begin{bmatrix}-sin(\lambda) &amp; cos(\lambda) &amp; 0 \\ -sin(\phi)cos(\lambda) &amp; -sin(\phi)sin(\lambda) &amp; cos(\phi) \\ -cos(\phi)cos(\lambda) &amp; cos(\phi)sin(\lambda) &amp; sin(\phi)\end{bmatrix}R_{ECEF}" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="65" width="461"></p>
<p>We’ll see an application of ECEF to ENU conversion when we compute the azimuth and elevation of one of the GPS satellites later.</p>
<h2><span id="Part_2_Using_GPS_to_Calculate_User_Position"><strong>Part 2: Using GPS to Calculate User Position</strong></span></h2>
<p>Determining the position of a user using GPS is essentially a triangulation problem. If the distance of the user from three or more satellites is known, then the 3D position can be calculated using triangulation. The basic idea in 2 dimensions is shown below.</p>
<p id="DFvWGDb"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://www.telesens.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/img_595483bd718db.png" alt="" width="751" height="429" srcset="https://www.telesens.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/img_595483bd718db.png 1272w, https://www.telesens.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/img_595483bd718db-300x171.png 300w, https://www.telesens.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/img_595483bd718db-768x439.png 768w, https://www.telesens.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/img_595483bd718db-1024x585.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 751px) 100vw, 751px"></p>
<p>The problem of locating the user can&nbsp;thus can be divided into two subproblems:</p>
<ol>
<li>Finding the distance of the user from each satellite</li>
<li>Determining the position of this satellite in the user’s coordinate system</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s look at each of these problems step by step.</p>
<h3><span id="Step_1_Determining_the_Position_of_a_Satellite"><strong>Step 1: Determining the Position of a Satellite</strong></span></h3>
<p>The ideal satellite orbit is an elliptical orbit and specified completely by 5 Keplerian parameters five&nbsp;of which determine the size and shape of the ellipse and the orientation of the orbital plane relative to the fixed stars (i.e., an inertial reference frame). The sixth parameter specifies the position of the satellite at a particular time instant of epoch. Given the six elements, the satellite position and velocity can be computed at any other epoch.</p>
<p id="bVbOcno"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://www.telesens.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img_596c0f935c931.png" alt="" width="722" height="327"></p>
<p>The orbit of a satellite is not an exact ellipse however as the earth is not uniform in composition and the movement of a satellite is perturbed by the gravitational forces of the sun and the moon. The resulting perturbations are small, but must be accounted for to obtain accurate position. GPS accounts for these perturbations by transmitting an expanded set of 16 orbital parameters that can be used to accurately compute the position of a satellite at a given time instant. We won’t go into the details of how these corrections are applied. The step-by-step procedure to compute the satellite position (including applying the orbital corrections)&nbsp;is described in table 20-IV in the GPS IS.

<h3><span id="Step_2_Computing_the_Distance_of_the_User_from_the_Satellite"><strong>Step 2: Computing the Distance of the User from the Satellite</strong></span></h3>
<p>The satellite signal received by a GPS receiver bears the time stamp at which the signal was sent from the satellite. By taking the difference between its own time and the timestamp of the GPS signal and multiplying by the speed of light, the receiver calculates a rough measure of the distance between the receiver and the satellite. This measure is called the <em>pseudorange</em>.&nbsp;If the clock on the satellite and the receiver were perfectly in sync and the GPS signal traveled in a straight line at the speed of light, then this measure would be the true distance between the satellite and the receiver. This however is not the case and the difference between the satellite and user clocks as well as the delays caused by the atmosphere must be modeled to calculate an&nbsp;accurate position of the user.</p>
<p>Let’s consider first the effect of the offset between the user and satellite clocks. Let’s denote the transmission time from the satellite to the user by <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://www.telesens.co/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-13197f4653c1fd428a291609eb1e3b87_l3.png" alt="\tau" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="8" width="10"> and a common time reference (referred to as GPS Time (GPST)) by <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://www.telesens.co/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-b4e3cbf5d4c5c6d9b702dd139f14c147_l3.png" alt="t" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="12" width="6">.

<p>In reality&nbsp;(thankfully), there is thick layer of atmosphere in the path of the satellite signal which slows it down and bends its path. The change in the path length due to bending of the signal ray is generally not significant. However the change in the speed of propagation can be significant and can result in positioning errors of several meters or more. This change in speed has two components – <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://www.telesens.co/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-3796b3eab9bdc7ccd4402f58ccd1eff4_l3.png" alt="I_\rho" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="18" width="15"> arising from the propagation of the signal through the ionosphere and <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://www.telesens.co/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-6869e0cab400c13080534f18769140dc_l3.png" alt="T_\rho" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="18" width="17"> arising from the propagation of the signal through the troposphere (see appendix for more information about these delays and how they can be estimated).

<p>Thus, the true range (actual distance of the user from a satellite) can be calculated from the raw pseudo ranges output by the GPS device by first subtracting the user’s estimate of the Tropo and Iono delays and then adjusting for the satellite clock offset. The Iono and the Tropo delay generally lead to a position error of ~25m and&nbsp;~2m respectively. More information about how to estimate these delays are provided in the appendix. In the rest of our analysis in this blog, we’ll ignore these delays.</p>
<h4><span id="Estimating_the_Satellite_Clock_Bias"><strong>Estimating the Satellite Clock Bias</strong></span></h4>
<p>The satellite clock bias is important to estimate as it can result in a position error of thousands of meters. The procedure to calculate the satellite clock bias is described on page 96 of the GPS Interface Specification document. The procedure consists of evaluating a polynomial whose coefficients are provided in the GPS ephemeris message and adding a relativistic term. The polynomial provides most of the correction, with the relativistic effect contributing about 1-10 m depending on the position of the satellite. The code for calculating the satellite clock bias is given in section 1.d of the appendix.</p>
<h4><span id="User_Clock_Bias"><strong>User Clock Bias</strong></span></h4>
<p>The user clock bias is an unknown quantity, just like the user position. The user clock bias will be estimated along with the user position.</p>
<h3><span id="Step_3_User_Position_and_Clock_Bias_Estimation"><strong>Step 3: User Position and Clock Bias Estimation</strong></span></h3>
<p>We are now ready to look at the algorithm used to compute the user position. A quick point about the notation before we look at the math. Generally, vector quantities are expressed using boldface (<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://www.telesens.co/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-a4997d1a0a6554f7c4b2e41d93ee7fe4_l3.png" alt="\boldsymbol{x}" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="8" width="11">) and scalar quantities without emphasis. However in the math shown below, (mostly due to laziness), I’m skipping making this distinction. I think it is clear from the context which quantities are vectors and which ones are not.</p>

<h2><span id="Note_about_the_Matlab_Code"><strong>Note about the Matlab Code</strong></span></h2>
<p>It is worth noting that while most of the equations in the Matlab code shown in the Appendix involve evaluation of expressions where the known quantities are on the right&nbsp;hand side and unknown quantities on the left&nbsp;hand side (and thus can be evaluated in one step), there are a few that requires invocation of a solver. One example is the calculation of the <em>eccentric anomaly (E)</em> from the&nbsp;<em>mean anomaly (M)</em>&nbsp;required during the calculation of the satellite position from ephemeris parameters<em>. </em>The relation between the two is expressed as:</p>

<h2><span id="Experimental_Setup"><strong>Experimental Setup</strong></span></h2>
<p>In this section, I’ll describe the hardware setup I used to collect raw GPS data which was then processed using the algorithms described above to calculate user position and clock bias. An interested user should be able to easily replicate my setup using cheap and commercially available GPS receivers and open source software.</p>
<p id="LbeRFAZ"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://www.telesens.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img_596a46e63a510.png" alt="" width="827" height="462" srcset="https://www.telesens.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img_596a46e63a510.png 1296w, https://www.telesens.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img_596a46e63a510-300x168.png 300w, https://www.telesens.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img_596a46e63a510-768x430.png 768w, https://www.telesens.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img_596a46e63a510-1024x573.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 827px) 100vw, 827px"></p>
<p>The figure above shows the main steps involved in my setup. For collecting raw GPS data, special GPS units that output “timing” information consisting of raw pseudoranges and satellite ephemeris information must be used. Regular GPS units calculate the user position internally and don’t output the raw data we need to calculate the user position using the algorithm described above. The NEO-M8T and 6T chips from u-blox fit our needs. Complete hardware assemblies with the GPS unit, antennae and serial output port can be purchased from Amazon for ~40 dollars.</p>
<p>In order to receive and save the raw GPS signal, I use the STRSVR utility in RTKLib (RTKLIB is an open source program package for standard and precise positioning that supports all common Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) – GPS, Glonass, Galileo, Baidu etc. See: http://www.rtklib.com). STRSVR takes the custom u-blox formatted output from the u-blox receiver and converts it into RTCM standard format. RTCM (Radio Technical Commission for Maritime Services, see:&nbsp;http://www.rtcm.org/differential-global-navigation-satellite–dgnss–standards.html) is a standard for GNSS data and content designed to support a variety of GNSS applications in air/land/sea navigation, surveying, radio navigation/location etc.</p>
<p>RTCM standard provides the definition of various messages that provide specific GPS information. The information we are interested in are the raw pseudoranges and satellite ephemeris. This information is contained in messages 1002 and 1019.</p>
<p id="IiqmPJz"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="632" height="256" src="https://www.telesens.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img_596a51ec3f302.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.telesens.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img_596a51ec3f302.png 632w, https://www.telesens.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img_596a51ec3f302-300x122.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px"></p>

<p>We must request the u-blox receiver to send 1002 and 1019 message information as part of the data it sends to STRSVR. This is done by using the following commands in the Cmd window:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="320" height="291" src="https://www.telesens.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img_596a6a793e425.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.telesens.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img_596a6a793e425.png 320w, https://www.telesens.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img_596a6a793e425-300x273.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px"></p>
<p id="xRnVGKT"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="361" height="136" src="https://www.telesens.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img_596a6e6a5f6ea.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.telesens.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img_596a6e6a5f6ea.png 361w, https://www.telesens.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img_596a6e6a5f6ea-300x113.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 361px) 100vw, 361px"></p>
<p>The first command sets the update rate to 1Hz and the other two enable RAW messages. The details on how this happens are a bit murky. I tried going through parts of the UBX documentation to understand this better but soon got lost. Suffices to say that&nbsp;the above commands work and cause the receiver to send the data we need.</p>
<p>I configure the STRSVR utility to receive data from the serial port at 9600 Baud and save the data to a file in RTCM 3 format.</p>
<p id="gJaMZIH"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="386" height="239" src="https://www.telesens.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img_596a6bca9c3a5.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.telesens.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img_596a6bca9c3a5.png 386w, https://www.telesens.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img_596a6bca9c3a5-300x186.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 386px) 100vw, 386px"></p>
<p>To collect the data, I went to the roof of my apartment building and placed the GPS receiver at a location where it could get an unobstructed view of the sky. I used the u-blox configuration software (https://www.u-blox.com/en/product/u-center-windows) to verify that a sufficient number of satellites were visible and a good position fix could be obtained. I then used STRSVR to collect about an hour of raw GPS data and saved the data to a file.</p>
<h3><span id="Processing_Raw_GPS_Data"><strong>Processing Raw GPS Data</strong></span></h3>
<p>STRSVR saves the raw GPS data into binary RTCM3 format. We must decode the RTCM3 data to create Matlab data structures out of it. I considered writing my own RTCM decoder, but then found an excellent Matlab library called goGPS (http://www.gogps-project.org/about/) that provides many useful routines to read and process GPS data. I used the <em>load_stream&nbsp;</em>function that reads an RTCM formatted file and extracts the RTCM messages (line 95 in my version of goGPS). I then saved the extracted data to a .mat file to serve as input to my the&nbsp;position calculation algorithm that implements the&nbsp;equations above. The Matlab code is shown in the section 1.a of the appendix. I’m also attaching the <a href="https://www.telesens.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/rtcm_data.txt">rtcm_data</a> since many people have asked for it. I changed the file extension from .mat to .txt due to wordpress security restrictions. Rename the file back to .mat when you download it.</p>
<h3><span id="Analysis_of_Results"><strong>Analysis of Results</strong></span></h3>
<p>In this section, I’ll analyze the positions and clock bias computed by my algorithms. We will look at the variation of the north/east/up components of the position with time, variation of the clock bias with time and introduce the concept of Dilution of Precision (DOP), a common metric used to measure the quality of GPS position estimates. Since the GPS receiver was stationary during data collection, the variation of the calculated position reflects the true performance of the algorithm used to calculate the position.</p>

<p>The plot of E/N/U components of the user position in a user centered ENU frame along with the position scatter plot are shown above.&nbsp;As expected, the variation in position is around 30m in the East and North direction and slightly higher along the Up direction. We’ll explain the reason for this during the discussion about DOP (Dilution of Precision) below.</p>
<h3><span id="Clock_Bias_Drift"><strong>Clock Bias Drift</strong></span></h3>
<p>The variation of the receiver clock bias against time is shown below. Note that the clock bias <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://www.telesens.co/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-f56d50c26583f9a035ff6b4e3c0ca5c0_l3.png" alt="b" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="13" width="8"> used in the algorithm above is in the unit of distance. In the plot below, the bias has been converted into unit of time by dividing by the speed of light.</p>

<p>We can see that the clock bias is not a constant but drifts linearly with time. The amount of drift is 4.27 e-7sec/sec.</p>
<h3><span id="Computing_the_Satellite_AzimuthElevation"><strong>Computing the Satellite Azimuth/Elevation</strong></span></h3>
<p>As an exercise, let’s compute the azimuth and elevation of all the satellites visible at a given time instant. This will neatly tie in many of the ideas discussed above and also provide a good segue to discussing DOP.</p>
<p>Azimuth and elevation angles are calculated from the perspective of the user. Thus, they are expressed in an ENU frame centered about the user position.</p>
<p id="mBvVNhj"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://www.telesens.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img_5970cfb6788fd.png" alt="" width="363" height="265" srcset="https://www.telesens.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img_5970cfb6788fd.png 572w, https://www.telesens.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img_5970cfb6788fd-300x219.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 363px) 100vw, 363px"></p>
<p>If the position of the satellite in the user centered ENU frame is (<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://www.telesens.co/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-922e816fa375e151e481b54a0af72edf_l3.png" alt="x_s, y_s, z_s" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="12" width="63">), then the azimuth (az) and elevation (el) is given by:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://www.telesens.co/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-3488656b0f50a2944474cc2ea270dab7_l3.png" alt="tan(az) = \frac{x_E}{x_N}" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="22" width="103"></p>

<p>The procedure to extract azimuth and elevation from&nbsp;satellite and user positions (calculated in the ECEF frame) is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Calculate the position vector from the user to the satellite (in ECEF frame)</li>
<li>Calculate the user position in Ellipsoidal coordinates (lat/lng)</li>
<li>Rotate&nbsp;the position vector to the ENU frame centered about the user position</li>

<p>As can be seen the azimuth angles are both positive and negative, while the elevations are only positive. This makes sense as the user can’t see the satellites below the horizon.</p>
<p>You may have seen satellite track charts that many GPS processing software output as a visualization aid. Those charts are created by calculating the satellite positions using the procedure described here at multiple epochs.</p>

<p>DOP helps us answer the question, “how good are my position estimates”? There are two components of the errors in our position estimate. The first one is the measurement noise, which is obvious. The noisier our measurements (pseudorange, satellite position etc), higher are the expected position errors. However, there is another, less obvious component of the positioning errors. This component is the user-satellite geometry. As explained in chapter 6 of&nbsp;<span id="tHKOjIChb0k2x6wRSOpd8" data-reflist="[&quot;a5of4cpcm&quot;]" data-footnote="undefined"><sup>1</sup></span>, it the easiest to see this in a 2D example.</p>
<p>A user measures his distance from a pair of signal sources&nbsp;S1 and S2 at known locations. If the range measurements were perfect, the user could determine his position exactly as lying on the intersection of two circles centered on S1 and S2 and radii equal to the measured ranges. The measurements however are imperfect and have a maximum uncertainty of <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://www.telesens.co/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-8e666c43aae0c51eb5a09d25b03580e3_l3.png" alt="\pm\epsilon" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="12" width="21">. The figure below shows how the user-source&nbsp;geometry affects the amount of uncertainty in the user position.</p>

<p>DOP provides a simple characterization of the user-satellite geometry. The more favourable the geometry, the lower the DOP. More favourable means the satellites are spread apart in azimuth and elevation. The lower the DOP and user range error (<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://www.telesens.co/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-1c9cc40f96a1492e298e7da85a2c1692_l3.png" alt="\sigma" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="8" width="11">), the better the quality of the position estimate. To understand the relationship between DOP and satellite geometry better, lets consider two simple examples. The first example looks at the variation between DOP and the angle between the satellite vectors in a three satellite configuration shown in the figure below.&nbsp;The first satellite is located along the y axis and the other two are located symmetrically about the y axis, at an angle <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://www.telesens.co/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-356a08e839ab6974a16448e16e56745d_l3.png" alt="\theta" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="12" width="9"> from the x-axis. The G matrix and the plot of DOP against angle theta is shown below.</p>

<p>The minimum DOP occurs at <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://www.telesens.co/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-e3adde1d8b3cea9acd70eb1f0a973637_l3.png" alt="\theta = -30^o" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="12" width="71">. This makes intuitive sense as at this angle, the satellites are maximally separated from each other. Note that the DOP does not vary symmetrically with positive and negative <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://www.telesens.co/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-356a08e839ab6974a16448e16e56745d_l3.png" alt="\theta" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="12" width="9">. This is because for a given <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://www.telesens.co/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-356a08e839ab6974a16448e16e56745d_l3.png" alt="\theta" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="12" width="9">, the separation between the satellite vectors is higher for a negative value than for a positive value.</p>
<p>Next let’s look at a more realistic example of four satellites located in 3D. First satellite is located at the zenith and the others three are located 120 degrees apart in azimuth and at an elevation of <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://www.telesens.co/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-356a08e839ab6974a16448e16e56745d_l3.png" alt="\theta" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="12" width="9"> (same for the three satellites). We’ll look at the variation of VDOP with the elevation angle.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://www.telesens.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img_5977b85448684.png" alt="" width="321" height="344" srcset="https://www.telesens.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img_5977b85448684.png 609w, https://www.telesens.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img_5977b85448684-279x300.png 279w" sizes="(max-width: 321px) 100vw, 321px"></p>

<p>As expected, the VDOP decreases with increasing elevation angle, as the satellites get farther apart from each other. It continues to decrease as the elevation goes past the horizon (elevation = 90 degrees). Since a user located on the earth surface can’t observe satellites below the horizon (in fact, signal from satellites &lt; 10 degrees above the horizon are too noisy and generally not used), the minimum value of VDOP is not achievable. This example demonstrates why VDOP is generally higher than HDOP.</p>
<p>Let’s now look at the variation of HDOP and VDOP with time calculated by our position algorithm on real data.</p>
<p id="RsMgfPx"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="560" height="420" src="https://www.telesens.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img_5977c10f6a387.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.telesens.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img_5977c10f6a387.png 560w, https://www.telesens.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img_5977c10f6a387-300x225.png 300w, https://www.telesens.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img_5977c10f6a387-326x245.png 326w, https://www.telesens.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img_5977c10f6a387-80x60.png 80w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px"></p>
<p>No surprises here. The HDOP/VDOP values are generally &lt; 2.5, which is considered adequate and as expected, VDOP is higher than HDOP.</p>
<p>This concludes the post! I hope that next time you use Google maps to get directions, you’ll think about the incredible scientists, engineers and policy makers who have given us this incredible system that makes possible so many applications that we now take for granted. According to&nbsp;<span id="a16itk3rudh" data-reflist="[&quot;a5of4cpcm&quot;]" data-footnote="undefined"><sup>1</sup></span>, the GPS constellation cost about 30 billion dollars to put in place and costs the US government about 1B annually to maintain. The valuation of Uber alone, which wouldn’t exist without GPS is upwards of 70B dollars. When you include all of the other amazing applications made possible by GPS, the public investment in GPS appears to be one of the best public investments ever made! 🙂</p>

<h3><span id="2b_Ionospheric_and_Tropospheric_Delay"><strong>2.b&nbsp;Ionospheric and Tropospheric Delay</strong></span></h3>
<p>The passage of the satellite signal through the earth’s atmosphere changes the speed of the signal and bends the signal path. These effects result in the distance to the satellite calculated by multiplying the time delay between signal&nbsp;transmission and reception with the speed of light to be&nbsp;different from the true distance. Estimating the effect of the atmosphere is important to calculate accurate pseudoranges and thus accurate user position. In the treatment above, we neglected the atmospheric effects. In this section, we’ll provide some information about atmospheric effects and how they are typically modeled. The interested reader is referred to chapter 5 of <span id="w4X0NimVt4133jjruzlIw" data-reflist="[&quot;a5of4cpcm&quot;]" data-footnote="undefined"><sup>1</sup></span>&nbsp;for details.</p>
<p>For the purpose of analyzing its interaction with GPS signals, the earth’s atmosphere can be split into two parts – troposphere and the ionosphere. The ionosphere extends from a height of about 50km to about 1000km above the earth is a region of ionized gases. The ionization is caused by the sun’s radiation and the state of the ionosphere is determined primarily by the intensity of solar activity. Electron density generally builds up during the day as the sun rises, peaking at around 2 PM local time and then starts declining. There can be considerable variability from day to day depending upon the solar activity. The speed of propagation of the signal in the ionosphere depends upon the number of free electrons in the path of the signal, defined as the&nbsp;<em>total electron count&nbsp;</em>(TEC). The number of electrons in a tube of 1<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://www.telesens.co/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-7bd22cca2802b4314e8f06fb217359f5_l3.png" alt="m^2" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="15" width="23"> cross section extending from the receiver to the satellite is given as:</p>

<p>where <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://www.telesens.co/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-5e357137369f7249106418d84ec7d492_l3.png" alt="n_e(l)" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="18" width="36"> is the electron density along the signal path and the integral is along the signal path from the satellite to the receiver. The path length through the ionospheric is shortest in the zenith direction (when the satellite is directly overhead) and longest when the satellite is close to the horizon.</p>
<p>In general, ionosphere delays are hard to model as solar flares and magnetic storms can large and rapidly varying fluctuations in electron densities. Two methods are primarily used to estimate ionospheric delays. The first method uses dual frequency GPS measurements and the fact that the ionospheric delay is inversely proportional to the square of the frequency. This enables us to set up a system of equations to estimate the&nbsp;<em>ionosphere free&nbsp;</em>pseudoranges from the noisy pseudoranges.</p>
<p>Receivers limited to single frequency measurements can use an empirical model called the Klobuchar model parameterized by the user’s latitude, longitude, satellite azimuth/elevation, local time and a set of parameters broadcast by the satellites. A step by step implementation of this model is detailed in the GPS Interface Specification and can be easily implemented in Matlab or C.</p>
<p>The troposphere extends to about 16 Km above the equator and contains roughly three quarters of the gaseous mass of the atmosphere. The troposphere is primarily composed of the dry gasses – nitrogen and oxygen, and water vapour. The primary effect of the troposphere on GPS signal propagation is to delay it slightly, causing the apparent range to the satellite to appear longer by about 2.5m, depending on the satellite elevation angle. Unlike the ionosphere, the troposphere is non-dispersive for GPS frequencies, and thus the tropospheric effect can’t be estimated by dual frequency measurements. The amount of delay caused by the troposphere depends on the pressure, temperature and humidity. Various models exist to calculate the delay from meteorological measurements.

            <span>Abstract:</span>In 1953, Enrico Fermi criticized Dyson's model by quoting Johnny von Neumann: "With four parameters I can fit an elephant, and with five I can make him wiggle his trunk." So far, there have been several attempts to fit an elephant using four parameters, but as the problem has not been well-defined, the current methods do not completely satisfy the requirements. This paper defines the problem and presents an attempt.

<p>Multiple founders have told me the ideas in this article were responsible for the financial success of their startup.</p>
<p>They might be exaggerating out of kindness, but if it’s even 10% as useful for you, it will have been worth your time.</p>
<p>We’ll explore how growth affects cash-flow, and conclude with several techniques that can transform the cash-flow of your business.</p>
<h2 id="cost-create-dollar-mrr">The cost to create a dollar of MRR <a href="#cost-create-dollar-mrr"></a>
</h2><p>What does it cost a SaaS company to add $1 of new monthly recurring revenue?</p>
<p>Using the typical acronyms:</p>
<p><span><code>CAC</code> (<strong>C</strong>ost to <strong>A</strong>cquire a <strong>C</strong>ustomer) is the total cost to get one new paying customer—Marketing and Sales costs, including fully-loaded salaries<sup>1</sup>. The simplest way to compute it is “total spend in a month” divided by “total new customers added during that month.” </span></p>
<p><span><code>ARPC</code> (<strong>A</strong>verage <strong>R</strong>evenue <strong>p</strong>er <strong>Customer</strong>) is the average monthly-recurring revenue you get from a customer. The simplest way to compute it in aggregate is “total recurring-revenue in a month (<code>MRR</code>)” divided by “total number of paying customers during that month (<code>N</code>),” </span></p>
<blockquote>
<sup>1</sup>
<span> In smaller companies, typically the founder and others are spending time on marketing and sales activities as well; include the fraction of their time, or the salary that you would have to pay someone else to do those same tasks. Also include commissions. </span>
</blockquote>
<p>Since it costs <code>CAC</code> dollars to get <code>ARPC</code> new dollars of recurring-revenue:</p>
<p><span>"the cost to create one more dollar of MRR" = <code>CAC&nbsp;/&nbsp;ARPC</code> </span></p>
<p>If you haven’t done it before, computing this metric will be eye-opening.</p>
<p>Let’s posit a hypothetical company with a $10/mo consumer-targeted SaaS product, where they pay $1.60/click for Google Ads; that traffic converts at 5% to a free trial, and those trials convert at 40% to a paid customer. Their <code>CAC</code> is $80<sup>2</sup>, and their <code>ARPC</code> is $10, therefore we would say “it costs them $8 to create $1 of MRR.”</p>
<blockquote>
<sup>2</sup>
<span> <code>$1.60&nbsp;/&nbsp;0.05&nbsp;/&nbsp;0.4&nbsp;=&nbsp;$80</code> </span>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s tempting to conclude that “It takes 8 months of customer revenue to ‘pay us back’ for the marketing and sales costs of getting that customer. That customer is unprofitable before then, and becomes more and more profitable after.”</p>

<p>All companies have mandatory expenses associated with delivering the entire product to the customer. Not just the product itself, but everything else the customer expects, like being able to pay with a credit card or call tech support:</p>
<ul>
<li>credit card processing fees</li>
<li>tech support<sup>3</sup></li>
<li>infrastructure (if SaaS)</li>
<li>professional services (if consulting)</li>
<li>bill of materials (if physical goods)</li>
<li><em>Anything else which, if missing, the customer would say “You’re not delivering the product I paid for.”</em></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<sup>3</sup>
<span> Even if you’re a solopreneur, doing support yourself, wanting to claim that therefore “support costs me nothing,” the opposite is true: Your time is valuable; you could have used that time for anything else, such as marketing or building a new feature. How should you account for this? Use whatever it would have cost to hire someone else to do the service for you, and remember that low-wage people who aren’t fluent in your language, can’t provide the level of service you’re currently providing! </span>
</blockquote>
<p>In finance we measure these costs relative to revenue:</p>
<p><span><code>GPM</code> (<strong>G</strong>ross <strong>P</strong>rofit <strong>M</strong>argin) is the percentage of revenue remaining, after subtracting these “expenses required to deliver the whole product and experience.” </span></p>
<p>Continuing our example, suppose credit card fees are 3% of revenue, infrastructure costs are 5%, and tech support is 25%. Then <code>GPM&nbsp;=&nbsp;67%</code>, i.e. after fulfilling our promises to our customers, we’re left with 67% of the money they gave us.</p>
<h2 id="payback-period-p">Payback period (p) <a href="#payback-period-p"></a>
</h2><p>Now we’re prepared to compute the <em>actual</em> pay-back period: The amount of time needed to recover <code>CAC</code> expenses, which is the number of months of revenue <em>we can spend</em>:</p>
<p><span><code>p</code> = “payback period” = <code>CAC&nbsp;/&nbsp;(MRR&nbsp;×&nbsp;GPM)</code> </span></p>
<p>In our example, <code>p&nbsp;=&nbsp;80&nbsp;/&nbsp;(10&nbsp;×&nbsp;0.67)&nbsp;=</code> 12 months.</p>

<p>The cash-flow implications are harsh. Consider:</p>
<p>You’re bootstrapped. You scrape together $1000 from life savings or credit card debt. You spend it on ads. Happily, it works! With the numbers in our example, you now have $125 in MRR, but expenses are $42/mo, so it’s going to be a whole year before you get that $1000 back. Meanwhile, you’re just <em>out</em> that cash.</p>

</h3><p>This is one of the main reasons why so many startup pundits (including myself) are always telling you to “raise your price.” The difference between $39/mo and $19/mo might not matter to your customers<sup>4</sup>, but can cut your payback period to 1/3 of what it currently is<sup>5</sup>.</p>
<blockquote>
<sup>4</sup>
<span> I know it sounds like doubling your price would dramatically reduce how many people sign up. However: (a) If sign-ups halve, you still have the same-sized business, except far more profit, and higher-quality customers, and (b) my experience and many others’ is that signups don’t halve; they might even go up. Examples below. </span>
</blockquote><blockquote>

<span> Cut into a third, not a half, because <code>MRR</code> doubles but the costs behind <code>GPM</code> do not, which means <code>GPM</code> also increases, so you get double-benefit. </span>

<p>How much should they pay? Typically you reward the customer for their up-front payment with a discount. In our example, the product is $10/mo; you might offer a plan at $100/year, exclaiming “get two months free!” on the pricing page.</p>
<p>This is a great excuse to raise prices slightly: Offer the annual plan at 12 times the <em>current</em> monthly price, then increase the month-to-month price by something like 20% (i.e. the “2 months free” amount). Existing customers can be grandfathered in, or ask them to switch to annual to preserve their monthly rate.</p>
<p>What does this do to our payback period?</p>
<p>In terms of cash:</p>
<ul>
<li>Before: We paid $80 to get $10 of MRR, which is $120/year.</li>
<li>Now: We paid $80 and also got $120/year, <strong>but we got the $120 today.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>This gives us an infinite marketing budget.</strong> To see why:</p>
<ul>
<li>We spend $80 on ads. But <em>not</em> in cash; it’s on our credit card.</li>
<li>We get $120 in our bank account, <em>in cash</em>. We mentally set aside the <code>GPM</code> costs that we will incur, that this income will need to cover. Those costs are $40, which leaves us with $80 that we’re free to spend.</li>
<li><em>Later</em>, our credit card bill comes due, and finally the $80 ad cost leaves our bank account.</li>
<li><strong>Which means we never actually lost the $80, in terms of cash!</strong> <br> We received the $80 from the customer <em>before</em> we sent away the $80 for the ad, even after setting aside <code>GPM</code> costs.</li>

<p>In real life, not all customers select annual plans. However, this is still transformative because:</p>

<li>Even if only a third of customers select an annual plan, it’s still a huge impact to cash-flow.</li>
<li>You could raise prices on the monthly plans even further, which both (a) increases selection of the annual plan and (b) decreases the pay-back period of the monthly plan.</li>

<dt>I hear that annual-plan customers cancel less often. So, will encouraging annual plans also decrease my cancellation rate?</dt>
<dd>No, but it is useful in cancellation analysis.</dd>
<dd>The reason people on annual plans have a higher retention rate, is that they self-select into those plans. What type of person does that? A person who is already intending to stay. So, offering annual doesn’t change your overall cancellation rate, but it does segregate customers in a useful way: Those more likely to cancel are now identifying themselves.</dd>
<dd>Which means, you can contact them and learn more about why they feel that way, and possibly then do something to improve cancellations, which is likely one of the most valuable things you can do. You can also compare their behavior and responses with those on annual plans, to tease out what’s actually different between the cohorts.</dd>

<dt>When someone on an annual plan cancels after, say, seven months, should I refund them the remainder of the term?</dt>
<dd>You can pick anything along this scale of generosity:</dd>
<dd><em>Refund pro-rata.</em> <br> If they cancel after seven months, then refund



<span>\(\frac{5}{12}\)</span> of their original payment. This has the benefit of simplicity and promoting your reputation as being generous.</dd>
<dd><em>Refund as if monthly.</em> <br> In retrospect, the customer is acting like they are on a monthly plan, so compute what they <em>would</em> have paid in that case, and refund them the difference. For example, if the annual plan is $100/year, and the monthly plan is $10/mo, and they canceled after 7 months, then they would have paid <span>\(7 \times \$10 = \$70\)</span> , therefore you refund them <span>\(\$100 - \$70 = \$30\)</span>, which is less than if you refunded 5 months of their annual price, i.e. <span>\(\frac{5}{12} \times \$100 = \$42\)</span> . This also means if they cancel very late in the year you don’t refund them at all, as a monthly plan would have been even more expensive.</dd>
<dd><em>No refunds.</em> <br> We have all experienced this with contracted services like our phone bill or corporate services. This is of course the least-generous approach, so you have to decide whether this policy adheres to your <a href="https://longform.asmartbear.com/emptiness/" data-title="In its emptiness, there is the function of a startup" data-desc="Everything about a startup changes over time.

<dt>What if the customer cancels before the payback period elapses?</dt>
<dd>Astute readers will notice that the “payback period” model didn’t include cancellations.</dd>
<dd>Clearly, not all customers who sign up on day 1 will still be here on day 30, much less day 300 or day 3000. In particular, if they cancel before the payback period, that’s a net-loss for the business. Don’t we need to account for that somehow?</dd>
<dd>Yes! Cancellations were omitted here for simplicity, but in practice you cannot ignore them. A simple way to account for them, is to first calculate your retention rate across the nominal payback period. For example, if payback is 12 months, what is your 12-month retention (<code>r</code>)? Excellent for Enterprise software is <code>r&nbsp;=&nbsp;95%</code>; for SMB is <code>75%</code>; Shopify is just <code>50%</code>.</dd>
<dd>Then, we declare that the customers who <em>stay</em>, must make up the costs for the customers who <em>leave</em>. Therefore if the nominal payback period is <code>p</code> (as defined earlier), we actually need to wait <code>p&nbsp;/&nbsp;r</code> to get paid back.</dd>
<dd>This formula is not exactly right either, but it’s a simple method that gets you to the right vicinity.</dd>
<dt>What about all the other expenses at the company? CAC isn’t the only cost.</dt>
<dd>That’s right, saying “infinite budget” is artistic license to make the point, which is that it’s transformative for cash flow.</dd>
</dl>
<hr>
<p>I hope you can use annual plans to dramatically change your cash-flow!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><article><p>In the past three years Notion<!-- -->’<!-- -->s data has expanded 10x due to user and content growth, with a doubling rate of 6-12 months. Managing this rapid growth while meeting the ever-increasing data demands of critical product and analytics use cases, especially our recent Notion AI features, meant building and scaling Notion’s data lake. Here’s how we did it. </p><p>Everything you see in Notion—texts, images, headings, lists, database rows, pages, etc—despite differing front-end representations and behaviors, is modeled as a "block" entity in the back end and stored in the Postgres database with a consistent structure, schema, and associated metadata (learn more about <a href="https://www.notion.so/blog/data-model-behind-notion">Notion's data model</a>).</p><div role="button" aria-label="Lightbox öffnen"><figure><p><span><span></span><img alt="Data Lake initial image" role="img" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" srcset="https://www.notion.so/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,width=1920,quality=100/https://images.ctfassets.net/spoqsaf9291f/4rrziPDb4W1MWIJd9DU75F/ea42dabcf0bd96470958a47e4f80c1d2/Data_Lake_0.png 1x, https://www.notion.so/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,width=3840,quality=100/https://images.ctfassets.net/spoqsaf9291f/4rrziPDb4W1MWIJd9DU75F/ea42dabcf0bd96470958a47e4f80c1d2/Data_Lake_0.png 2x" src="https://www.notion.so/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,width=3840,quality=100/https://images.ctfassets.net/spoqsaf9291f/4rrziPDb4W1MWIJd9DU75F/ea42dabcf0bd96470958a47e4f80c1d2/Data_Lake_0.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p><figcaption><p>Everything in Notion is a block, and these blocks are made up of data.

At the start of 2021 we had more than 20 billion block rows in Postgres, and this figure has since grown to more than two hundred billion blocks—a data volume of hundreds of terabytes, even when compressed.</p><div><p>To manage this data growth while enhancing the user experience, we’ve strategically expanded our database infrastructure from one Postgres instance to a more complex sharded architecture. We began in 2021 by <a href="https://www.notion.so/blog/sharding-postgres-at-notion">horizontally sharding our Postgres database into 32 physical instances, each comprising 15 logical shards</a>, and continued in 2023 by <a href="https://www.notion.so/blog/the-great-re-shard">increasing the number of physical instances to 96, with five logical shards per instance</a>.

Notion users update existing blocks (texts, headings, titles, bullet lists, database rows, etc) much more often than they add new ones. This causes block data to be predominantly update-heavy—90% of Notion upserts are updates. Most data warehouses, including Snowflake, are optimized for insert-heavy workloads, which makes it increasingly challenging for them to ingest block data.</p><p><strong>Use case support</strong></p><p>Data transformation logic became more complex and heavy, surpassing the capabilities of the standard SQL interface offered by off-the-shelf data warehouses. </p><div><ul><li><p>One important use case is constructing denormalized views of Notion’s block data for key products (e.g., AI and Search). Permission data, for example, ensures that only the right people can read or change a block (<a href="https://www.notion.so/blog/data-model-behind-notion">this blog</a> discusses Notion’s block permission model). But a block’s permission isn’t statically stored in the associated Postgres—it has to be constructed on the fly via expensive tree traversal computation.</p></li><li><p>In the following example, <code>block_1</code>, <code>block_2</code>, and <code>block_3 </code>inherit permissions from their immediate parents (<code>page_3 </code>and  <code>page_2</code>) and ancestors (<code>page_1 </code>and <code>workspace_a). </code>To build permission data for each of these blocks, we must traverse its ancestor tree all the way up to the root (<code>workspace_a</code>) in order to ensure completeness. With hundreds of billions of blocks whose ancestor depths ranged from a few to dozens, this kind of compute was very costly and would simply time out in Snowflake.</p></li></ul></div><div role="button" aria-label="Lightbox öffnen"><figure><p><span><span></span><img alt="Data lake image 3" role="img" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" srcset="https://www.notion.so/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,width=1920,quality=100/https://images.ctfassets.net/spoqsaf9291f/MydQ7FIKshSG7yHcqUBBh/730a7be57bebd5670132b0aa404cfbc2/Data_Lake_3.png 1x, https://www.notion.so/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,width=3840,quality=100/https://images.ctfassets.net/spoqsaf9291f/MydQ7FIKshSG7yHcqUBBh/730a7be57bebd5670132b0aa404cfbc2/Data_Lake_3.png 2x" src="https://www.notion.so/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,width=3840,quality=100/https://images.ctfassets.net/spoqsaf9291f/MydQ7FIKshSG7yHcqUBBh/730a7be57bebd5670132b0aa404cfbc2/Data_Lake_3.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p><figcaption><p>Constructing permission data for each block requires traversing the entire ancestor tree.</p></figcaption></figure></div> <p>Because of these challenges, we started to explore building our data lake.</p><div><p id="building-and-scaling-notion’s-in-house-data-lake"><h2><span>Building and scaling Notion’s in-house data lake</span></h2></p></div><p>Here were our objectives for building an in-house data lake:</p><div><ul><li><p>Establish a data repository capable of storing both raw and processed data at scale.</p></li><li><p>Enable fast, scalable, operable, and cost-efficient data ingestion and computation for any workload—especially Notion's update-heavy block data.</p></li><li><p>Unlock AI, Search, and other product use cases that require denormalized data.</p></li></ul></div><p>However, while our data lake is a big step forward, it's important to clarify what it's not intended to do:</p><div><ul><li><p>Completely replace Snowflake.

We ingest incrementally updated data from Postgres to Kafka using Debezium CDC connectors, then use <a href="https://hudi.apache.org/">Apache Hudi</a>, an open-source data processing and storage framework, to write these updates from Kafka to S3. With this raw data we can then do transformation, denormalization (e.g., tree traversal and permission data construction for each block), and enrichment, then store the processed data in S3 again or in downstream systems to serve analytics and reporting needs, as well as AI, Search, and other product requirements.</p><div role="button" aria-label="Lightbox öffnen"><figure><p><span><span></span><img alt="Data lake image 4" role="img" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" srcset="https://www.notion.so/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,width=3840,quality=100/https://images.ctfassets.net/spoqsaf9291f/47gLr3QRSWQ9MpPbvE54Nf/2d232b1d4a0ea226f07852d6d824b490/Data_Lake_4.png 1x" src="https://www.notion.so/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,width=3840,quality=100/https://images.ctfassets.net/spoqsaf9291f/47gLr3QRSWQ9MpPbvE54Nf/2d232b1d4a0ea226f07852d6d824b490/Data_Lake_4.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p><figcaption><p>Notion’s in-house data lake is built on Debezium CDC connector, Kafka, Hudi, Spark, and S3.</p></figcaption></figure></div> <p>Next we’ll describe and illustrate the design principles and decisions we arrived at after extensive research, discussion, and prototyping work.</p><div><p><h3 id="design-decision-1-choosing-a-data-repository-and-lake"><strong>Design decision 1: Choosing a data repository and lake</strong></h3></p></div><p>Our first decision was to use S3 as a data repository and lake to store all raw and processed data, and position data warehouse and other product-facing data stores such as ElasticSearch, Vector Database, Key-Value store, etc as its downstream. We made this decision for two reasons:</p><div><ul><li><p>It aligned with Notion’s AWS tech stack, e.g., our Postgres database is based on AWS RDS and its export-to-S3 feature (described in later sections) allows us to easily bootstrap tables in S3.</p></li><li><p>S3 has proven its ability to store large amounts of data and support various data processing engines (like Spark) at low cost.</p></li></ul></div><p>By offloading heavy ingestion and compute workloads to S3 and only ingesting highly cleaned and business-critical data to Snowflake and product-facing data stores, we significantly improved data compute scalability and speed and reduced cost.</p><div><p><h3 id="design-decision-2-choosing-our-processing-engine"><strong>Design decision 2: Choosing our processing engine</strong></h3></p></div><p>We chose Spark as our main data processing engine because as an open-source framework, it could be rapidly set up and evaluated to verify that it met our data transformation needs. Spark has four key benefits:</p><div><ul><li><p>Spark’s wide range of built-in functions and UDFs (User Defined Functions) beyond SQL enable complex data processing logics like tree traversal and block data denormalization, as described above.</p></li><li><p>It offers a user-friendly PySpark framework for most lighter use cases, and advanced Scala Spark for high-performance, heavy data processing.</p></li><li><p>It processes large-scale data (e.g., billions of blocks and hundreds of terabytes) in a distributed manner, and exposes extensive configurations, which allows us to fine-tune our control over partitioning, data skewness, and resource allocation. It also enables us to break down complex jobs into smaller tasks and optimize resourcing for each task, which helps us achieve reasonable runtime without over-provisioning or wasting resources.</p></li><li><p>Finally, Spark’s open-source nature offers cost-efficiency benefits.</p></li></ul></div><div><p><h3 id="design-decision-3-preference-for-incremental-ingestion-over-snapshot-dump">Design decision 3: Preference for incremental ingestion over snapshot dump</h3></p></div><p>After finalizing our data lake storage and processing engine, we explored solutions for ingesting Postgres data to S3. We wound up considering two approaches: incremental ingestion of changed data and periodic full snapshots of Postgres tables. In the end, based on performance and cost comparisons, we opted for a hybrid design:</p><div><ul><li><p><strong>During normal operations, incrementally ingest and continuously apply changed Postgres data to S3.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>In rare cases, take a full Postgres snapshot once to bootstrap tables in S3.</strong></p></li></ul></div><p>The incremental approach ensures fresher data at lower cost and with minimal delay (a few minutes to a couple hours, depending on table size). Taking a full snapshot and dumping to S3, by contrast, takes more than 10 hours and costs twice as much, so we do so infrequently, when bootstraping new tables in S3.</p><div><p><h3 id="design-decision-4-streamlining-incremental-ingestion"><strong>Design decision 4: Streamlining incremental ingestion</strong></h3></p></div><div><ul><li><p><strong>Kafka CDC Connector for Postgres → to → Kafka</strong></p></li></ul></div><p>We chose the Kafka Debezium CDC (Change Data Capture) connector to publish incrementally changed Postgres data to Kafka, similar to Fivetran’s data ingestion method. We chose it together with Kafka for their scalability, ease of setup, and close integration with our existing infrastructure. </p><div><ul><li><p><strong>Hudi for Kafka → to → S3</strong></p></li></ul></div><div><p>To ingest the incremental data from Kafka to S3, we considered three excellent data lake and ingestion solutions: <a href="https://hudi.apache.org/">Apache Hudi</a>, <a href="https://iceberg.apache.org/">Apache Iceberg</a>, and <a href="https://delta.io/">DataBricks Delta Lake</a>. In the end we chose Hudi for its excellent performance with our update-heavy workload and its open-source nature and native <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/HUDI/RFC+-+39+Deltastreamer+source+for+debezium+CDC+logs">integration with Debezium CDC messages</a>.</p></div><p>Iceberg and Delta Lake, on the other hand, weren’t optimized for our update-heavy workload when we considered them in 2022. Iceberg also lacked an out-of-box solution that understands Debezium messages; Delta Lake does have one, but it isn’t open source. We would have had to implement our own Debezium consumer if we’d gone with either of those solutions.</p><div><p><h3 id="design-decision-5-ingest-raw-data-before-processing"><strong>Design decision 5: Ingest raw data before processing</strong></h3></p></div><p>Finally, we decided to ingest raw Postgres data to S3 without on-the-fly processing in order to establish a single source of truth and simplify debugging across the entire data pipeline. Once raw data is in S3, we then do transformation, denormalization, enrichment, and other types of data processing. We store intermediate data in S3 again and only ingest highly cleaned, structured, and business-critical data to downstream systems for analytics, reporting, and product needs.</p><div><p id="scaling-and-operating-our-data-lake"><h2><span>Scaling and operating our data lake</span></h2></p></div><p>We experimented with many detailed setups in order to tackle the scalability challenges associated with Notion’s ever-increasing data volume. Here's what we tried and how it went:</p><p><strong>1. CDC connector and Kafka setup</strong></p><p>We set up one Debezium CDC connector per Postgres host and deploy them in an AWS EKS cluster. Because of the maturity of Debezium and EKS management and Kafka's scalability, we’ve only had to upgrade the EKS and Kafka clusters a few times in the past two years. As of May 2024, it smoothly handles tens of MB/sec of Postgres row changes.</p><p>We also configure one Kafka topic per Postgres table and let all connectors consuming from 480 shards write to the same topic for that table. This setup significantly reduced the complexity of maintaining 480 topics for each table and simplified downstream Hudi ingestion to S3, significantly reducing operational overhead.</p><p><strong>2. Hudi setup</strong></p><p>We used <a href="https://hudi.apache.org/docs/0.10.0/hoodie_deltastreamer/">Apache Hudi Deltastreamer</a>, a Spark-based ingestion job, to consume Kafka messages and replicate the state of Postgres table in S3. After several rounds of performance tuning, we established a fast, scalable ingestion setup to ensure data freshness. This setup provides a delay of just a few minutes for most tables, and up to two hours for the largest one, the block table (see graphic below).</p><div><ul><li><p>We use the default COPY_ON_WRITE Hudi table type with UPSERT operation, which suits our update-heavy workload.</p></li><li><p>To manage data more effectively and minimize write amplification (i.e., the number of files updated per batched ingestion run), we fine-tuned three configurations: </p><div><ul><li><p>Partition/shard data using the same Postgres shard scheme, i.e., the  <code>hoodie.datasource.write.partitionpath.field: db_schema_source_partition</code> config.

This is based on our observation that more recent blocks are more likely to get updated, which allows us to prune files with only outdated blocks.</p></li><li><p>Set the index type to be bloom filter, i.e., the  <code>hoodie.index.type: BLOOM</code></p><p> config, to further optimize the workload.</p></li></ul></div></li></ul></div><div role="button" aria-label="Lightbox öffnen"><figure><p><span><span></span><img alt="Data lake image 5" role="img" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" srcset="https://www.notion.so/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,width=3840,quality=100/https://images.ctfassets.net/spoqsaf9291f/2lSK1kBy9dHNg9UF5HU4gs/72ddf2a3cf506ccaed49ce75af8d536f/Data_Lake_5.png 1x" src="https://www.notion.so/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,width=3840,quality=100/https://images.ctfassets.net/spoqsaf9291f/2lSK1kBy9dHNg9UF5HU4gs/72ddf2a3cf506ccaed49ce75af8d536f/Data_Lake_5.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p><figcaption><p>Hudi Deltastreamer setup for the block table.</p></figcaption></figure></div> <p><strong>3. Spark data processing setup</strong>For the majority of our data processing jobs we utilize PySpark, whose relatively low learning curve makes it accessible to many team members. For more complex jobs such as tree traversal and denormalization, we leverage Spark’s superior performance in several key areas:</p><div><ul><li><p>We benefit from the performance efficiency of the Scala Spark.</p></li><li><p>We manage data more effectively by handling large and small shards separately (remember we kept the same 480 shards scheme in S3 to be consistent with Postgres); small shards have their entire data loaded into the Spark task container memory for fast processing, whereas large shards that exceed memory capacity are managed through disk reshuffling.</p></li><li><p>We utilize multi-threading and parallel processing to speed up processing of 480 shards, allowing us to optimize runtime and efficiency.</p></li></ul></div><p><strong>4. Bootstrap setup</strong></p><p>Here's how we bootstrap new tables:</p><div><ul><li><p>We first set up Debezium Connector to ingest Postgres changes to Kafka.</p></li><li><p>Starting from timestamp <code>t</code>, we kick off a AWS RDS-provided export-to-S3 job to save the latest snapshot of Postgres tables to S3. We then create a Spark job to read those data from S3 and write them to the Hudi table format.</p></li><li><p>Finally, we ensure that all changes made during the snapshotting process are captured by setting up Deltastreamer to read from Kafka messages from <code>t</code>. This step is crucial for maintaining data completeness and integrity.</p></li></ul></div><p>Thanks to the scalability of Spark and Hudi, these three steps usually complete within 24 hours, allowing us to perform re-bootstrap with manageable time to accommodate new table asks and Postgres upgrade and re-sharding operations.</p><div><p id="the-payoff-less-money-more-time-stronger-infrastructure-for-ai"><h2><span>The payoff: less money, more time, stronger infrastructure for AI</span></h2></p></div><p>We started developing our data lake infrastructure in the spring of 2022 and completed it by that fall. Due to the infra's inherently scalable nature, we were able to continually optimize and expand the Debezium EKS clusters, Kafka clusters, Deltastreamer, and Spark job to keep up with Notion's 6-to-12 month data doubling rate without significant overhauls. The payoff was significant:</p><div><ul><li><p>Moving several large, crucial Postgres datasets (some of them tens of TB large) to data lake gave us a net savings of over a million dollars for 2022 and proportionally higher savings in 2023 and 2024.</p></li><li><p>For these datasets, the end-to-end ingestion time from Postgres to S3 and Snowflake decreased from more than a day to a few minutes for small tables and up to a couple of hours for large ones. Re-syncs, when necessary, can be completed within 24 hours without overloading live databases.</p></li><li><p>Most importantly, the changeover unlocked massive data storage, compute, and freshness savings from a variety of analytics and product asks, enabling the successful rollout of Notion AI features in 2023 and 2024. Stay tuned for a detailed post on our Search and AI Embedding RAG Infra built on top of the data lake!</p></li></ul></div><p>We’d like to thank OneHouse and the Hudi open source community for their tremendous and timely support. Great open source support was crucial to our ability to spin up the data lake in just a few months.</p><p><i>As our needs grow and diversify, we continue to enhance our data lake by building automated and self-service frameworks to empower more engineers to manage and develop product use cases based on the data.</i></p><p><i>Interested in helping us build the next generation of Notion’s data management?

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://thasso.xyz/2024/07/13/setting-up-an-x86-cpu.html">https://thasso.xyz/2024/07/13/setting-up-an-x86-cpu.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40959742">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>People say there are things that are complex and there are things that are just complicated. Complexity is considered interesting, complicatedness is considered harmful. The process of setting up an x86_64 CPU is mostly complicated.</p><p>I’ll describe one way to go from a boot sector loaded by the BIOS with the CPU in 16-bit real mode to the CPU set up in 64-bit long mode. The setup is pretty bare-bones and there’s tons more to do.</p><p>To follow along, you need the <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/intel-sdm.html">Intel 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual</a>, an assembler (I used <a href="https://www.nasm.us/">nasm</a>), and <a href="https://www.qemu.org/">QEMU</a>. If you don’t have an x86_64 CPU, you should still be able to run everything I describe by emulating an x86 CPU in QEMU. I assume you know x86 assembly and the syntax that nasm uses. I like the <a href="https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/nasmtutorial/">nasm tutorial by Ray Toal</a> for getting started.</p><p>I was surprised by how readable some of the Intel manual is. The initial chapters in volume 1 do a really good job at providing an overview of the system and explaining the terms used throughout the other volumes. But volume 3: System Programming Guide is most relevant to this discussion. There is an overview of all the operating modes in volume 3, section 2.2 Modes of Operation. The path we’re taking is highlighted in red.</p><p><img src="https://thasso.xyz/public/figures/x86-mode-transitions.png" alt="Overview of x86 mode transitions"></p><p>For everything up to 32-bit mode, take a look at <a href="https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~exr/lectures/opsys/10_11/lectures/os-dev.pdf">“Writing a Simple Operating System – from Scratch”</a>. It’s unfinished but still very good.</p><h2 id="starting-point-bios"> Starting Point: BIOS <a href="#starting-point-bios"></a></h2><p>After a reset, the x86 CPU is in “real mode”. That mode has a default operand size of 16 bits. You get a 20-bit address space and thus the ability to address 1MB of memory by using segmentation. Real mode is pretty much a backward compatibility mode for the Intel 8086 chip from 1978.</p><p>After the BIOS the first code that runs is that in the boot sector. The BIOS searches the system for a disk where the first sector ends in the magic number <code>0xaa55</code> (i.e., the byte <code>0x55</code> followed by the byte <code>0xaa</code>). It loads that “boot sector” to memory at address <code>0x7c00</code>.</p><p>So the BIOS gives us 512 bytes to work with. We need to use these bytes in order to bootstrap the rest of the bootloader. <a href="https://github.com/jart/sectorlisp">One can fit a surprising amount of stuff in 512 bytes</a>, but it’s easiest to just load some more data from disk first. Fortunately, routines defined by the BIOS remain available to us as long as we’re in real mode.</p><h2 id="boot-sector-setup"> Boot Sector Setup <a href="#boot-sector-setup"></a></h2><p>Let’s set up a simple boot sector. It will just print a message to the screen using BIOS routines and then hang. This way, we know that the tooling works.</p><p>This is the assembly we need:</p><div><pre><code><span>;; src/boot_sector.s</span>

</code></pre></div><p>The linker script <code>linker.ld</code> is important because it makes sure that the code in our boot sector is relocated to the right address in the final image. Specifically, the bootloader loads the boot sector to address <code>0x7c00</code> in memory. So that’s the base address to relocate the boot sector to. In addition, the linker will add the magic number at the end of the boot sector. Other guides I’ve seen do both the offset and the magic number inside the boot sector assembly source file by using features of the assembler, but that’s somewhat hackish.</p><pre><code># linker.ld

Stage 1 is the code in the boot sector. It is everything that the BIOS loads for us. The sole purpose of stage 1 is to load stage 2 into memory. Stage 1 does this by using BIOS-provided routines to load stage 2 into memory.</p><p>In stage 2, we’ll switch from 16-bit real mode to 32-bit protected mode. In protected mode, we can’t use BIOS routines anymore. Without BIOS routines, loading sectors from a disk would become much more involved. So we’ll load a number of sectors from disk into memory and hope for the best. Of course, this is an unsafe technique, but it works for now.</p><p>This is how one can access the disk using BIOS.

In protected mode, segmentation is used by default to implement memory protection. Before switching to protected mode, you need to define a Global Descriptor Table (GDT) that contains segment descriptors for all the segments you want to define. Usually, paging is used in favor of segmentation. In fact, in 64-bit long mode, you need to use paging. But for the initial switch to protected mode, segmentation is required.</p><p>The Intel manual describes the “flat model” as a very simple segmentation model that can be implemented in the GDT. The “flat model” comprises a code segment and a data segment. Both of these segments are mapped to the entire linear address space (their base addresses and limits are identical). Using the simplest of all models is fine, since we just want to get to long mode and abandon segmentation in favor of paging.</p><p>The GDT is defined as a contiguous structure in memory. You fill a chunk of memory with the right data and give the CPU the address and the length of the memory chunk. The format of the GDT structure is described in the Intel manual.</p><p>From section “3.4.5 Segment Descriptors”:</p><p><img src="https://thasso.xyz/public/figures/segment-descriptor-layout.png" alt="Screenshot of segment descriptor layout"></p><p>The GDT is just an array of segment descriptors with a “null descriptor” at the start that’s used to catch invalid translations.
