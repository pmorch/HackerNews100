The intrusive thoughts were having a moment there. I’m back, I’m back.</p><p>Here’s the thing: More and more writers seem to be getting these sort of responses, and there is - in my observational opinion - a rather dark and insidious slant to it. Stay with me for a moment, and I’ll get back to that.&nbsp;</p><p>Part of the irony is of the flavour that would make our ancestors chuckle. Because the accuser, in their own way, wasn't entirely wrong. My writing&nbsp;does&nbsp;share some DNA with the output of a large language model. We both have a tendency towards structured, balanced sentences. We both have a fondness for transitional phrases to ensure the logical flow is never in doubt. We both deploy the occasional (and now apparently incriminating) hyphen or semi-colon or em-dash to connect related thoughts with a touch more elegance than a simple full stop.</p><p>With a calmer mind, I became a little more gracious. The error in their judgment wasn't in the&nbsp;what, but in the&nbsp;why. They had mistaken the origin story.</p><p>---</p><p>I am a writer. A writer who also happens to be Kenyan. And I have come to this thesis statement: I don't write like ChatGPT. ChatGPT, in its strange, disembodied, globally-sourced way, writes like me. Or, more accurately, it writes like the millions of us who were pushed through a very particular educational and societal pipeline, a pipeline deliberately designed to sandpaper away ambiguity, and forge our thoughts into a very specific, very formal, and very impressive shape.</p><p>There’s a growing community (cult?) of self-proclaimed AI detectives, who have designed and detailed what they consider tells, and armed their followers with a checklist of robotic tells. Does a piece of text use words like ‘furthermore’, ‘moreover’, ‘consequently’, ‘otherwise’ or ‘thusly’? Does it build its arguments using perfectly parallel structures, such as the classic “It is not only X, but also Y”? Does it arrange its key points into neat, logical triplets for maximum rhetorical impact?</p><p>To these detectives of digital inauthenticity, I say: Friend, welcome to a typical Tuesday in a Kenyan classroom, boardroom, or intra-office Teams chat. The very things you identify as the fingerprints of the machine are, in fact, the fossil records of our education.</p><p>---</p><p>The bedrock of my writing style was not programmed in Silicon Valley. It was forged in the high-pressure crucible of the Kenya Certificate of Primary Education, or KCPE. For my generation, and the ones that followed, the English Composition paper - and its Kiswahili equivalent,&nbsp;Insha -&nbsp;was not just a test; it was a rite of passage. It was one built up to be a make-or-break moment in life: A forty-minute, high-stakes sprint where your entire future, your admission to a good national high school, and by extension, your life’s trajectory, could pivot on your ability to deploy a rich vocabulary and a sophisticated sentence structure under immense, suffocating pressure.</p><p>And that one moment wasn’t an aberration. Every English class and every homework assignment for three years prior (and more, it could be argued) was specifically designed to get the teacher marking your composition to award you a mark as close as possible to the maximum of 40. Scored a 38/40? Beloved, whoever is marking your paper has deemed you worthy of breathing the same air as Malkiat Singh.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s a memory that’s hard to write over - the prompt, written in the looping, immaculate cursive of the teacher on the blackboard:&nbsp;“A holiday I will never forget.”&nbsp;Or perhaps it was one of those that demanded that you end the entire composition with, “…and that’s when I woke up and realised it was just a dream.” The topic was almost irrelevant. The real test was the execution.</p><p>There were unspoken rules, commandments passed down from teacher to student, year after year. The first commandment? Thou shalt begin with a proverb or a powerful opening statement. “Haste makes waste,” we would write, before launching into a tale about rushing to the market and forgetting the money. The second? Thou shalt demonstrate a wide vocabulary. You didn’t just ‘walk’; you ‘strode purposefully’, ‘trudged wearily’, or ‘ambled nonchalantly’. You didn’t just ‘see’ a thing; you ‘beheld a magnificent spectacle’. Our exercise books were filled with lists of these “wow words,” their synonyms and antonyms drilled into us like multiplication tables.</p><p>The third, and perhaps most important commandment, was that of structure. An essay had to be a perfect edifice. The introduction was the foundation, the body was the walls, and the conclusion was the roof, neatly summarising the moral of the story and, if you were clever, circling back to the introductory proverb to create a satisfying, if predictable, loop. We were taught to build our paragraphs around a strong topic sentence. We were taught the sin of the sentence fragment and the virtue of the compound-complex sentence. Our teachers, armed with red pens that bled judgment all over our pages, were our original algorithms, training us on a specific model of "good" writing. Our model compositions, the perfect essays from past students read aloud to the class, were our training data.</p><p>And that’s a culture that is carried over into high school, where set books must be memorised, and arguments for or against certain statements must be elaborately made for you do reach and surpass the English literature passmark. You could literally recite Shakespeare in the middle of the night right before any exam.&nbsp;</p><p>---</p><p>This style has a history, of course, a history far older than the microchip: It is a direct linguistic descendant of the British Empire. The English we were taught was not the fluid, evolving language of modern-day London or California, filled with slang and convenient abbreviations. It was the Queen's English, the language of the colonial administrator, the missionary, the headmaster. It was the language of the Bible, of Shakespeare, of the law. It was a tool of power, and we were taught to wield it with precision. Mastering its formal cadences, its slightly archaic vocabulary, its rigid grammatical structures, was not just about passing an exam. It was a signal. It was proof that you were educated, that you were civilised, that you were ready to take your place in the order of things.</p><p><em>(I’ve tried to resist it, but I can’t help myself, and perhaps you’ve already picked up on it: See the threes?)</em></p><p>In post-independence Kenya, this language didn't disappear. It simply changed its function. It became the official language, the language of opportunity, the new marker of class and sophistication. The Charles Njonjos and Tom Mboyas of their time used it to stamp their status in society. The ability to speak and write this formal, "correct" English separated the haves from the have-nots. It was the key that unlocked the doors to university, to a corporate job, to a life beyond the village. The educational system, therefore, doubled down on teaching it, preserving it in an almost perfect state, like a museum piece.</p><p>And right there is the punchline to this long, historical joke. An “AI”, a large language model, is trained on a vast corpus of text that is overwhelmingly formal. It learns from books published over the last two centuries. It learns from academic papers, from encyclopaedias, from legal documents, from the entire archive of&nbsp;structured&nbsp;human knowledge. It learns to associate intelligence and authority with grammatical precision and logical structure.&nbsp;</p><p>The machine, in its quest to sound authoritative, ended up sounding like a KCPE graduate who scored an 'A' in English Composition.&nbsp;It accidentally replicated the linguistic ghost of the British Empire.</p><p>---</p><p>Now, the world, through its new and profoundly flawed technological lens, looks at the result of our very human, very analogue training and calls it artificial. The insult is sharpened by the very tools used to enforce it. The so-called AI detectors are not neutral arbiters of truth. They are, themselves, products of a specific cultural and technical worldview.</p><p>These detectors, as I understand them, often work by measuring two key things: ‘Perplexity’ and ‘burstiness’. Perplexity gauges how predictable a text is. If I start a sentence, "The cat sat on the...", your brain, and the AI, will predict the word "floor." A text filled with such predictable phrases has low perplexity and is deemed "robotic." Burstiness measures the variation in sentence length and structure. Natural human speech and writing are perceived to be ‘bursty’ - a short, punchy sentence, followed by a long, meandering one, then another short one. LLMs, at least in their earlier forms, tended to write with a more uniform sentence length, a monotonous rhythm that lacked this human burstiness.</p><p>Now, consider our ‘training’ again. We were taught to be clear, logical, and, in a way, predictable. Our sentence structures were meant to be consistent and balanced. We were explicitly taught to avoid the very "burstiness" that ‘detectors’ now seek as a sign of humanity. A good composition flowed smoothly, each sentence building on the last with impeccable logic. We were, in effect, trained to produce text with low perplexity and low burstiness. We were trained to write in precisely the way that these tools are designed to flag as non-human. The bias is not a bug. It is the entire system.</p><p>Recent academic studies have confirmed this, finding that these tools are not only unreliable but are significantly more likely to flag text written by non-native English speakers as AI-generated. (And, again, we’re going to get back to this.) The irony is maddening: You spend a lifetime mastering a language, adhering to its formal rules with greater diligence than most native speakers, and for this, a machine built an ocean away calls you a fake.</p><p>---</p><p>So, when you read my work - when you see our work - what are you really seeing? Are you seeing a robot's soulless prose? Or are you seeing the image of our Standard Eight English teacher, Mrs. Amollo, her voice echoing in our minds - a voice that spoke with the clipped, precise accent of a bygone era - reminding us to connect our paragraphs with a suitable linking phrase? Are you seeing an algorithm's output, or the muscle memory of a thousand handwritten essays, drilled into us until the structure was as natural as breathing?</p><p>The question of what makes writing "human" has become dangerously narrow, policed by algorithms that carry the implicit biases of their creators. If humanity is now defined by the presence of casual errors, American-centric colloquialisms, and a certain informal, conversational rhythm, then where does that leave the rest of us? Where does that leave the writer from Lagos, from Mumbai, from Kingston, from right here in Nairobi, who was taught that precision was the highest form of respect for both the language and the reader?</p><p>It is a new frontier of the same old struggle: The struggle to be seen, to be understood, to be granted the same presumption of humanity that is afforded so easily to others. My writing is not a product of a machine. It is a product of my history. It is the echo of a colonial legacy, the result of a rigorous education, and a testament to the effort required to master the official language of my own country.</p><p>Before you point your finger and cry "AI!", I ask you to pause. Consider the possibility that what you're seeing isn't a lack of humanity, but a form of humanity you haven't been trained to recognise. You might be looking at the result of a different education, a different history, a different standard.&nbsp;</p><p>You might just be looking at a Kenyan, writing. And we’ve been doing it this way for a very long time.</p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://marcusolang.substack.com/p/im-kenyan-i-dont-write-like-chatgpt/comments&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Leave a comment&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://marcusolang.substack.com/p/im-kenyan-i-dont-write-like-chatgpt/comments" rel=""><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://marcusolang.substack.com/p/im-kenyan-i-dont-write-like-chatgpt?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://marcusolang.substack.com/p/im-kenyan-i-dont-write-like-chatgpt?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p></div></article></div><div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div><div><h3>Ready for more?</h3></div></div></div>]]></description>

                <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Over the last decade, when working on databases with UUID Version 4<sup id="fnref:rfc" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:rfc" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> as the primary key data type, these databases have usually have bad performance and excessive IO.</p>

<p>UUID is a native data type in Postgres can be stored as binary data. Various versions are in the RFC. Version 4 has mostly random bits, obfuscating information like when the value was created or where it was generated.</p>

<p>Version 4 UUIDs are easy to generate in Postgres using the <code>gen_random_uuid()</code><sup id="fnref:gen" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:gen" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> function since version 13 (released in 2020).</p>

<p>I’ve learned there are misconceptions about UUID Version 4, and sometimes these are the reasons users pick this data type.</p>

<p>Because of the poor performance, misconceptions, and available alternatives, I’ve come around to a simple position: <em>Avoid UUID Version 4 for primary keys</em>.</p>

<p>My more controversial take is to avoid UUIDs in general, but I understand there are some legitimate reasons for them without practical alternatives.</p>

<p>As a database enthusiast, I wanted to have an articulated position on this classic “Integer v. UUID” debate.</p>

<p>Among databases folks, debating this may be tired and clichéd. However, from my consulting work, I can say I work with databases using UUID v4 in 2024 and 2025, and still see the issues discussed in this post.</p>

<p>Let’s dig in.</p>

<h2 id="uuid-context-for-this-post">UUID context for this post</h2>
<ul>
  <li>UUIDs (or GUID in Microsoft speak)<sup id="fnref:ms" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:ms" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>) are long strings of 36 characters, 32 digits, 4 hyphens, stored as 128 bits (16 byte) values, stored using the binary <code>uuid</code> data type in Postgres</li>
  <li>The RFC documents how the 128 bits are set</li>
  <li>The bits for UUID Version 4 are mostly random values</li>
  <li>UUID Version 7 includes a timestamp in the first 48 bits, which works much better with database indexes compared with random values</li>
</ul>

<p>Although unreleased as of this writing, and pulled from Postgres 17 previously, UUID V7 is part of Postgres 18<sup id="fnref:land" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:land" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> scheduled for release in the Fall of 2025.</p>

<p>What kind of app databases are in scope for this post?</p>

<h2 id="scope-of-web-app-usage-and-and-their-scale">Scope of web app usage and and their scale</h2>
<p>The kinds of web applications I’m thinking of with this post are monolithic web apps, with Postgres as their primary OLTP database. The apps could be in categories like social media, e-commerce, click tracking, or business process automation apps.</p>

<p>The types of performance issues discussed here are related to inefficient storage and retrieval, meaning they happen for all of these types of apps.</p>

<p>What’s the core issue with UUID v4?</p>

<h2 id="randomness-is-the-issue">Randomness is the issue</h2>
<p>The core issue with UUID Version 4, given 122 bits are “random or pseudo-randomly generated values”<sup id="fnref:rfc:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:rfc" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> and primary keys are backed by indexes, is the impact to inserts and retrieval of individual items or ranges of values from the index.</p>

<p>Random values don’t have natural sorting like integers or lexicographic (dictionary) sorting like character strings.</p>

<p>UUID v4s do have “byte ordering,” but this has no useful meaning for how they’re accessed.</p>

<p>What use cases for UUID are there?</p>

<h2 id="why-choose-uuids-at-all-generating-values-from-one-or-more-client-applications">Why choose UUIDs at all? Generating values from one or more client applications</h2>
<p>One use case for UUIDs is when there’s a need to generate an identifier on a client or from multiple services, then passed to Postgres for persistence.</p>

<p>For web apps, generally they instantiate objects in memory and don’t expect an identifier to be used for lookups until after an instance is persisted as a row (where the database generates the identifier).</p>

<p>In a microservices architecture where the apps have their own databases, the ability to generate identifiers from each database without collisions is a use case for UUIDs. The UUID could also identify the database a value came from later, vs. an integer.</p>

<p>For collision avoidance (see HN discussion<sup id="fnref:hn" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:hn" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>), we can’t practically make the same guarantee with sequence-backed integers. There are hacks, like generating even and odd integers between two instances, or using different ranges in the int8 range.</p>

<p>There are also alternative identifiers like using composite primary keys (CPKs), however the same set of 2 values wouldn’t uniquely identify a particular table.</p>

<p>The avoidance of collisions is described this way on Wikipedia:<sup id="fnref:wiki" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:wiki" rel="footnote">6</a></sup></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The number of random version-4 UUIDs which need to be generated in order to have a 50% probability of one collision: 2.71 quintillion</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This number would be equivalent to:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Generating 1 billion UUIDs per second for about 86 years.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Are UUIDs secure?</p>

<h2 id="misconceptions-uuids-are-secure">Misconceptions: UUIDs are secure</h2>
<p>One misconception about UUIDs is that they’re secure. However, the RFC describes that they shouldn’t be considered secure “capabilities.”</p>

<p>From RFC 4122<sup id="fnref:rfc:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:rfc" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Section 6 Security Considerations:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Do not assume that UUIDs are hard to guess; they should not be used
  as security capabilities</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How can we create obfuscated codes from integers?</p>

<h2 id="creating-obfuscated-values-using-integers">Creating obfuscated values using integers</h2>
<p>While UUID V4s obfuscate their creation time, the values can’t be ordered to see when they were created relative to each other. We can  achieve those properties with integers with a little more work.</p>

<p>One option is to generate a pseudo-random code from an integer, then use that value externally, while still using integers internally.</p>

<p>To see the full details of this solution, please check out: <em>Short alphanumeric pseudo random identifiers in Postgres</em><sup id="fnref:alpha" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:alpha" rel="footnote">7</a></sup></p>

<p>We’ll summarize it here.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Convert a decimal integer like “2” into binary bits. E.g. a 4 byte, 32 bit integer: 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000010</li>
  <li>Perform an exclusive OR (XOR) operation on all the bits using a key</li>
  <li>Encode each bit using a base62 alphabet</li>
</ul>

<p>The obfuscated id is stored in a generated column. By reviewing the generated values, they are similar, but aren’t ordered by their creation order.</p>

<p>The values in insertion order were <code>01Y9I</code>, <code>01Y9L</code>, then <code>01Y9K</code>.</p>

<p>With alphabetical order, the last two would be flipped: <code>01Y9I</code> first, then <code>01Y9K</code> second, then <code>01Y9L</code> third, sorting on the fifth character.</p>

<p>If I wanted to use this approach for all tables, I’d try a centralized table that was polymorphic, storing a record for each table that’s using a code (and a foreign key constraint).</p>

<p>That way I’d know where the code was used.</p>

<p>Why else might we want to skip UUIDs?</p>

<h2 id="reasons-against-uuids-in-general-they-consume-a-lot-of-space">Reasons against UUIDs in general: they consume a lot of space</h2>
<p>UUIDs are 16 bytes (128 bits) per value, which is double the space of bigint (8 bytes), or quadruple the space of 4-byte integers. This extra space adds up once many tables have millions of rows, and copies of a database are being moved around as backups and restores.</p>

<p>A more considerable impact to performance though is the poor characteristics of writing and reading random data into indexes.</p>

<h2 id="reasons-against-uuid-v4s-add-insert-latency-due-to-index-page-splits-fragmentation">Reasons against: UUID v4s add insert latency due to index page splits, fragmentation</h2>
<p>For random UUID v4s, Postgres incurs more latency for every insert operation.</p>

<p>For integer primary key rows, their values are maintained in index pages with “append-mostly” operations on “leaf nodes,” since their values are orderable, and since B-Tree indexes store entries in sorted order.</p>

<p>For UUID v4s, primary key values in B-Tree indexes are problematic.</p>

<p>Inserts are not appended to the right most leaf page. They are placed into a random page, and that could be mid-page or an already-full page, causing a page split that would have been unnecessary with an integer.</p>

<p>Planet Scale has a nice visualization of index page splits and rebalancing.<sup id="fnref:ps" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:ps" rel="footnote">8</a></sup></p>

<p>Unnecessary splits and rebalancing add space consumption and processing latency to write operations. This extra IO shows up in Write Ahead Log (WAL) generation as well.</p>

<p><a href="https://buildkite.com/resources/blog/goodbye-integers-hello-uuids/">Buildkite reported a 50% reduction in write IO</a> for the WAL by moving to time-ordered UUIDs.</p>

<p>Given fixed size pages, we want high density within the pages. Later on we’ll use <em>pageinspect</em> to check the average leaf density between integer and UUID to help compare the two.</p>

<h2 id="excessive-io-for-lookups-even-with-orderable-uuids">Excessive IO for lookups even with orderable UUIDs</h2>
<p>B-Tree page layout means you can fit fewer UUIDs per 8KB page. Since we have the limitation of fixed page sizes, we at least want them to be as densely packed as possible.</p>

<p>Since UUID indexes are ~40% larger in leaf pages than bigint (int8) for the same logical number of rows, they can’t be as densely packed with values. As Lukas says, “<em>All in all, the physical data structure matters as much as your server configuration to achieve the best I/O performance in Postgres</em>.”<sup id="fnref:pga5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:pga5" rel="footnote">9</a></sup></p>

<p>This means that for individual lookups, range scans, or UPDATES, we will incur ~40% more I/O on UUID indexes, as more pages are scanned. Remember that even to access one row, in Postgres the whole page is accessed where the row is, and copied into a shared memory buffer.</p>

<p>Let’s insert and query data and take a look at numbers between these data types.</p>

<h2 id="working-with-integers-uuid-v4-and-uuid-v7">Working with integers, UUID v4, and UUID v7</h2>
<p>Let’s create integer, UUID v4, and UUID v7 fields, index them, load them into the buffer cache with <em>pg_prewarm</em>.</p>

<p>I will use the schema examples from the Cybertec post <a href="https://www.cybertec-postgresql.com/en/unexpected-downsides-of-uuid-keys-in-postgresql/">Unexpected downsides of UUID keys in PostgreSQL</a> by Ants Aasma.</p>

<p>View <a href="https://github.com/andyatkinson/pg_scripts/pull/20">andyatkinson/pg_scripts PR #20</a>.</p>

<p>On my Mac, I compiled the <code>pg_uuidv7</code> extension. Once compiled and enabled for Postgres, I could use the extension functions to generate UUID V7 values.</p>

<p>Another extension <code>pg_prewarm</code> is used. It’s a module included with Postgres, so it just needs to be enabled per database where it’s used.</p>

<p>The difference in latency and the enormous difference in buffers from the post was reproducible in my testing.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Holy behemoth buffer count batman”
<small>- Ants Aasma</small></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cybertec post results:</p>
<ul>
  <li>27,332 buffer hits, index only scan on the <code>bigint</code> column</li>
  <li>8,562,960 buffer hits, index only scan on the UUID V4 index scan</li>
</ul>

<p>Since these are buffer <em>hits</em> we’re accessing them from memory, which is faster than disk. We can focus then on only the difference in latency based on the data types.</p>

<p>How many more pages are accessed for the UUID index? 8,535,628 (8.5 million!) more 8KB pages were accessed, a 31229.4% increase. In terms of MB and MB/s that is:</p>
<ul>
  <li>68,285,024 MB or ~68.3 GB! more data that’s accessed</li>
</ul>

<p>Calculating a low and high estimate of access speeds for memory:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Low estimate: 20 GB/s</li>
  <li>High estimate: 80 GB/s</li>
</ul>

<p>Accessing 68.3 GB of data from memory (<code>shared_buffers</code> in PostgreSQL) would add:</p>
<ul>
  <li>~3.4 seconds of latency (low speed)</li>
  <li>~0.86 seconds of latency (high speed)</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s between ~1 and ~3.4 seconds of additional latency solely based on the data type. Here we used 10 million rows and performed 1 million updates, but the latencies will get worse as data and query volumes increase.</p>

<h2 id="inspecting-density-with-the-pageinspect-extension">Inspecting density with the pageinspect extension</h2>
<p>We can inspect the average fill percentage (density) of leaf pages using the <em>pageinspect</em> extension.</p>

<p>The <code>uuid_experiments/page_density.sql</code> (<a href="https://github.com/andyatkinson/pg_scripts/pull/20">andyatkinson/pg_scripts PR #20</a>) query in the repo gets the indexes for the integer and v4 and v7 uuid columns, their total page counts, their page stats, and the number of leaf pages.</p>

<p>Using the leaf pages, the query calculates an average fill percentage.</p>

<p>After performing the 1 million updates on the 10 million rows mentioned in the example, I got these results from that query:</p>
<div><pre><code> <span>idxname</span>             <span>|</span> <span>avg_leaf_fill_percent</span>
<span>---------------------+-----------------------</span>
 <span>records_id_idx</span>      <span>|</span>                 <span>97</span><span>.</span><span>64</span>
 <span>records_uuid_v4_idx</span> <span>|</span>                 <span>79</span><span>.</span><span>06</span>
 <span>records_uuid_v7_idx</span> <span>|</span>                 <span>90</span><span>.</span><span>09</span>
<span>(</span><span>3</span> <span>rows</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This shows the <code>integer</code> index had an average fill percentage of nearly 98%, while the UUID v4 index was around 79%.</p>

<h2 id="uuid-downsides-worse-cache-hit-ratio">UUID Downsides: Worse cache hit ratio</h2>
<p>The Postgres buffer cache is a critical part of good performance.</p>

<p>For good performance, we want our queries to produce cache “hits” as much as possible.</p>

<p>The buffer cache has limited space. Usually 25-40% of system memory is allocated to it, and the total database size including table and index data is usually much larger than that amount of memory. That means we’ll have trade-offs, as all data will not fit into system memory. This is where the challenges come in!</p>

<p>When pages are accessed they’re copied into the buffer cache as buffers. When write operations happen, buffers are dirtied before being flushed.<sup id="fnref:string" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:string" rel="footnote">10</a></sup></p>

<p>Since the UUIDs are randomly located, additional buffers will need to be copied to the cache compared to ordered integers. Buffers might be evicted to make space that are needed, decreasing hit rates.</p>

<h2 id="mitigations-rebuilding-indexes-with-uuid-values">Mitigations: Rebuilding indexes with UUID values</h2>
<p>Since the tables and indexes are more likely to be fragmented, it makes sense to rebuild the tables and indexes periodically.</p>

<p>Rebuilding tables can be done using pg_repack, pg_squeeze, or <code>VACUUM FULL</code> if you can afford to perform the operation offline.</p>

<p>Indexes can be rebuilt online using <code>REINDEX CONCURRENTLY</code>.</p>

<p>While the newly laid out data in pages, they will still not have correlation, and thus not be smaller. The space formerly occupied by deletes will be reclaimed for reuse though.</p>


<p>If possible, size your primary instance to have 4x the amount of memory of your size of database. In order words if your database is 25GB, try and run a 128GB memory instance.</p>

<p>This gives around 32GB to 50GB of memory for buffer cache (<code>shared_buffers</code>) which is hopefully enough to store all accessed pages and index entries.</p>

<p>Use <em>pg_buffercache</em><sup id="fnref:pgbc" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:pgbc" rel="footnote">11</a></sup> to inspect the contents, and <em>pg_prewarm</em><sup id="fnref:pgpre" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:pgpre" rel="footnote">12</a></sup> to populate tables into it.</p>

<p>One tactic I’ve used when working with UUID v4 random values where sorting is happening, is to provide more memory to sort operations.</p>

<p>To do that in Postgres, we can change the <code>work_mem</code> setting. This setting can be changed for the whole database, a session, or even for individual queries.</p>

<p>Check out <a href="https://www.pgmustard.com/blog/work-mem">Configuring work_mem in Postgres</a> on PgMustard for an example of setting this in a session.</p>

<h2 id="mitigation-in-rails-uuid-and-implicit-order-column-active-record">Mitigation in Rails: UUID and implicit order column Active Record</h2>
<p>Since Rails 6, we can control implicit_order_column.<sup id="fnref:bb" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:bb" rel="footnote">13</a></sup> The <a href="https://github.com/djezzzl/database_consistency/issues/197">database_consistency gem even has a checker</a> for folks using UUID primary keys.</p>

<p>When ORDER BY is generated in queries implicitly, it may be worth ordering on a different high cardinality field that’s indexed, like a <code>created_at</code> timestamp field.</p>

<h2 id="mitigating-poor-performance-by-clustering-on-orderable-field">Mitigating poor performance by clustering on orderable field</h2>
<p>Cluster on a column that’s high cardinality and indexed could be a mitigation option.</p>

<p>For example, imagine your UUID primary table has a <code>created_at</code> timestamp column that’s indexed with <code>idx_on_tbl_created_at</code>, and clustering on that.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>CLUSTER</span> <span>table_with_uuid_ok</span> <span>USING</span> <span>idx_on_tbl_created_at</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>I don’t see CLUSTER used ever really though as it takes an <a href="https://pglocks.org/?pgcommand=CLUSTER">access exclusive</a> lock. The CLUSTER is a one-time operation that would also need to be repeated regularly to maintain its benefits.</p>

<h2 id="recommendation-stick-with-sequences-integers-and-big-integers">Recommendation: Stick with sequences, integers, and big integers</h2>
<p>For new databases that <em>may</em> be small, with unknown growth, I recommend plain old integers and an identity column (backed by a sequence)<sup id="fnref:seq" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:seq" rel="footnote">14</a></sup> for primary keys. These are signed 32 bit (4-byte) values. This provides about 2 billion positive unique values per table.</p>

<p>For many business apps, they will never reach 2 billion unique values per table, so this will be adequate for their entire life. I’ve also recommended always using bigint/int8 in other contexts.</p>

<p>I guess it comes down to what you know about your data size, how you can project growth. There are plenty of low growth business apps out there, in constrained industries, and constrained sets of business users.</p>

<p>For Internet-facing consumer apps with expected high growth, like social media, click tracking, sensor data, telemetry collection types of apps, or when migrating an existing medium or large database with 100s of millions or billions of rows, then it makes sense to start with <code>bigint</code> (int8), 64-bit, 8-byte integer primary keys.</p>

<h2 id="uuid-v4-alternatives-use-time-ordered-uuids-like-version-7">UUID v4 alternatives: Use time-ordered UUIDs like Version 7</h2>
<p>Since Postgres 18 is not yet released, generating UUID V7s now in Postgres is possible using the <code>pg_uuidv7</code> extension.</p>

<p>If you have an existing UUID v4 filled database and can’t afford a costly migration to another primary key data type, then starting to populate new values using UUID v7 will help somewhat.</p>

<p>Fortunately the binary <code>uuid</code> data type in Postgres can be used whether you’re storing V4 or V7 UUID values.</p>

<p>Another alternative that relies on an extension is <em>sequential_uuids</em>.<sup id="fnref:sequ" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:sequ" rel="footnote">15</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<ul>
  <li>UUID v4s increase latency for lookups, as they can’t take advantage of fast ordered lookups in B-Tree indexes</li>
  <li>For new databases, don’t use <code>gen_random_uuid()</code> for primary key types, which generates random UUID v4 values</li>
  <li>UUIDs consume twice the space of <code>bigint</code></li>
  <li>UUID v4 values are not meant to be secure per the UUID RFC</li>
  <li>UUID v4s are random. For good performance, the whole index must be in buffer cache for index scans, which is increasingly unlikely for bigger data.</li>
  <li>UUID v4s cause more page splits, which increase IO for writes with increased fragmentation, and increased size of WAL logs</li>
  <li>For non-guessable, obfuscated pseudo-random codes, we can generate those from integers, which could be an alternative to using UUIDs</li>
  <li>If you must use UUIDs, use time-orderable UUIDs like UUID v7</li>
</ul>

                    <p>Finding good tree-sitter grammars is hard. In arborium, every grammar:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><svg width="1em" height="1em" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path fill="currentColor" d="M12 2C6.5 2 2 6.5 2 12s4.5 10 10 10s10-4.5 10-10S17.5 2 12 2m-2 15l-5-5l1.41-1.41L10 14.17l7.59-7.59L19 8z"></path></svg> Is generated with tree-sitter 0.26</li>

                    <p>
                        We hand-picked grammars, added missing highlight queries, and updated them
                        to the latest tree-sitter. Tree-sitter parsers compiled to WASM need libc
                        symbols (especially a C allocator)—we provide
                        <a href="https://github.com/bearcove/arborium/tree/main/crates/arborium-sysroot">arborium-sysroot</a>
                        which re-exports dlmalloc and other essentials for wasm32-unknown-unknown.

                    <p>
                        <strong>HTML</strong> — custom elements like
                        <code>&lt;a-k&gt;</code> instead of
                        <code>&lt;span class="keyword"&gt;</code>. More compact markup. No
                        JavaScript required.
                    </p>
                    <div>

                                <strong>macOS, Linux, Windows</strong> — tree-sitter handles
                                generating native crates for these platforms. Just add the
                                dependency and go.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div>

                                <strong>WebAssembly</strong> — that one's hard. Compiling Rust to
                                WASM with C code that assumes a standard library is tricky. We
                                provide a sysroot that makes this work, enabling
                                Rust-on-the-frontend scenarios like this demo.

                        Each grammar includes the full tree-sitter runtime embedded in its WASM module.
                        This adds a fixed overhead to every grammar bundle, on top of the grammar-specific parser tables.

                    <p>
                        Every grammar is compiled to WASM with aggressive size optimizations. Here's the complete build pipeline:
                    </p>

                    <h4>1. cargo build</h4>
                    <p>We compile with nightly Rust using <code>-Zbuild-std</code> to rebuild the standard library with our optimization flags:</p>
                    <div>
                        <p><code>-Cpanic=immediate-abort</code>

                        </p>
                        <p><code>-Copt-level=s</code>
                            <span>Optimize for size, not speed</span>
                        </p>
                        <p><code>-Clto=fat</code>
                            <span>Full link-time optimization across all crates</span>
                        </p>
                        <p><code>-Ccodegen-units=1</code>
                            <span>Single codegen unit for maximum optimization</span>
                        </p>
                        <p><code>-Cstrip=symbols</code>
                            <span>Remove debug symbols</span>
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <h4>2. wasm-bindgen</h4>
                    <p>Generate JavaScript bindings with <code>--target web</code> for ES module output.</p>

                    <h4>3. wasm-opt</h4>
                    <p>Final size optimization pass with Binaryen's optimizer:</p>
                    <div>
                        <p><code>-Oz</code>
                            <span>Aggressive size optimization</span>
                        </p>
                        <p><code>--enable-bulk-memory</code>
                            <span>Faster memory operations</span>
                        </p>
                        <p><code>--enable-mutable-globals</code>
                            <span>Required for wasm-bindgen</span>
                        </p>
                        <p><code>--enable-simd</code>
                            <span>SIMD instructions where applicable</span>
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <p>
                        Despite all these optimizations, WASM bundles are still large because each one embeds the full tree-sitter runtime.
                        We're exploring ways to share the runtime across grammars, but that's the architecture trade-off for now.

                                Those use regex-based tokenization (TextMate grammars). Regexes
                                can't count brackets, track scope, or understand structure—they just
                                pattern-match.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Tree-sitter actually <em>parses</em> your code into a syntax tree,
                                so it knows that <code>fn</code> is a keyword only in the right
                                context, handles deeply nested structures correctly, and recovers
                                gracefully from syntax errors.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                IDEs with LSP support (like rust-analyzer) can do even better with
                                <em>semantic</em> highlighting—they understand types and
                                dependencies across files—but tree-sitter gets you 90% of the way
                                there without needing a full language server.

                                When doing full-stack Rust, it's nice to have <em>exactly</em> the
                                same code on the frontend and the backend.

                            tree-sitter parsers so large?
                        </h4>
                        <div>
                            <p>
                                Tree-sitter uses table-driven LR parsing. The grammar compiles down
                                to massive state transition tables—every possible parser state and
                                every possible token gets an entry.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                These tables are optimized for O(1) lookup speed, not size. A
                                complex grammar like TypeScript can have tens of thousands of
                                states.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The tradeoff is worth it: you get real parsing (not regex hacks)
                                that handles edge cases correctly and recovers gracefully from
                                syntax errors.

<p>Unscii is a set of bitmapped Unicode fonts based on classic system fonts.
Unscii attempts to support character cell art well while also being suitable
for terminal and programming use.</p>

<p>The two main variants are unscii-8 (8×8 pixels per glyph) and unscii-16
(8×16). There are also several alternative styles for unscii-8, as well as
an 8x16 "full" variant that incorporates missing Unicode glyphs from
Fixedsys Excelsior and GNU Unifont. "unscii-16-full" falls under GPL because
of how Unifont is licensed; the other variants are in the Public Domain.</p>

<p>Unscii was created by Viznut.</p>

<h2>UNSCII 2.0</h2>

<p>In 2020-03-10, the new <a href="http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode13.0.0/">Unicode version
13.0</a> added 214 graphics characters for "legacy computing" (including,
among all, the missing PETSCII characters, and a majority of missing
Teletext/Videotex characters). Most of these were already included in Unscii
1.x, but now I have been able to give them proper Unicode mappings as well.
This is the main reason for the Unscii 2.0 release.</p>

<p>Additionally, Unscii 2.0 fixes errors in some characters, legibility in
some others and adds a bunch of new ones.</p>

<h2>DOWNLOADS</h2>

<p>HEX and PCF are the only actual bitmapped formats here. HEX is the same
simple hexdump format as used by the Unifont project. TTF, OTF and WOFF
are vectorized.</p>

<p>NOTE: Due to format limitations, the PCF versions lack all the characters
above U+FFFF! However, all the new graphics characters are provided in the
good old PUA range as well. A mapping is in the file <a href="http://viznut.fi/unscii/uns2uni.tr">uns2uni.tr</a>.</p>

<h2>BACKSTORY</h2>

<p>Years ago, I noticed that Unicode had a bunch of pseudographic characters
that could be used to enrichen Ansi art. However, no one seemed to use them.
Even MUDs that used the 256-color Xterm palette and had no issues with
Unicode still preferred to stick to the blocks available in the MS-DOS
codepage 437.</p>

<p>After looking into existing Unicode fonts, the reason became obvious: the
implementation of non-CP437 graphics characters was shaky at best. Unicode
Consortium doesn't even care how pseudographics are implemented. It was a
kind of chicken-and-egg problem: No commonly accepted Unicode graphics font,
no Unicode art scene; no art scene, no font support. The idea of an
art-compatible Unicode font was born.</p>

<p>For Unscii, I studied a bunch of classic system fonts and how their
characters had been used in Ascii and "extended-Ascii" art.</p>

<p>8×8 system fonts can be divided in two major categories according to
their line thickness: 1-pixel and 2-pixel. 2-pixel-wide lines are used in
more prominent classic systems, so I chose it. Also, 2-pixel 8×8 system
fonts are surprisingly similar to one another which made it easier to choose
neutral shapes.</p>

<p>The basic look of the 8×8 variant of Unscii is based on the following
systems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Amiga (Topaz-8)</li>
<li>Amstrad CPC</li>
<li>Atari 8-bit (as in 800, XL etc.)</li>
<li>Atari Arcade (the iconic ROM font)</li>
<li>Atari 32-bit (as in ST etc.)</li>
<li>BBC Micro (graphics mode font)</li>
<li>Commodore 64</li>
<li>IBM PC (the 8×8 ROM font as in CGA, or VGA 80×50)</li>
</ul>

<p>The 8×16 variant of Unscii has been mostly derived from the 8×8 variant
by using a set of transformation principles. When in doubt, the following
fonts have been looked at for additional reference:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows Fixedsys 8×15 (and its modern successor Fixedsys Excelsior)</li>
<li>IBM PC VGA ROM font(s) (and their modern successor U_VGA)</li>
<li>X Window System fonts 8x13(B) and 9x15(B)</li>
<li>Classic Macintosh 12-point Monaco</li>
<li>Digital VT420 10×16 font (used in the 80×24 mode)</li>
<li>Modern monospaced vector fonts: DejaVu Sans Mono, Lucida Console,
Inconsolata</li>
</ul>

<p>In general, neutral shapes are preferred, unless art, legibility or
readability require otherwise: The characters /\XY are connective because of
their connetive use in ascii art, and the serifs in iIl are longer than in
most classic systems.</p>

<p>Whenever a 8×16 shape has not been defined, Unscii falls back to
height-doubled 8×8.</p>

<p>I also studied game fonts and thin-line system fonts. This resulted in
the variants unscii-8-thin, unscii-8-mcr and unscii-8-fantasy.</p>

<p>When studying legacy character sets, I found literally hundreds of
characters without proper Unicode codepoints. These are mapped in the PUA
range as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>U+E080..E0FF: Teletext/Videotex block mosaics.</li>
<li>U+E100..: The most prominent and useful non-Unicode pseudographics:
everything found in PETSCII, Videotex smooth mosaics, extra shades,
round corners, X/Y doublers.</li>
<li>U+E800..: Somewhat stranger but still potentially useful: junctions with
border-aligned lines, diagonal line junctions, non-straight lines, weirder
fill patterns, etc.</li>
<li>U+EC00..: Total oddities. Mostly game-oriented bitmaps and other
depictive characters from Sharp MZ, Aquarius, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>Since Unicode 13.0, many of these are also available in Unicode, but
the PUA mappings are retained for compatibility.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>
	<a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/t/rob-reiner/" id="auto-tag_rob-reiner_1" data-tag="rob-reiner">Rob Reiner</a>, who directed such beloved Hollywood classics as <em>This Is Spinal Tap</em>, <em>Stand by Me</em> and&nbsp;<em>When Harry Met Sally</em>&nbsp;after starring in the trailblazing sitcom <em><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/t/all-in-the-family/" id="auto-tag_all-in-the-family_1" data-tag="all-in-the-family">All in the Family</a></em>, died Sunday along with his wife, Michele, in their Brentwood home.&nbsp;He was 78.</p>



<p>
	Reiner and his wife, 70, were found dead in their home on Chadbourne Avenue, with the couple “suffering lacerations consistent with a knife,” law enforcement sources <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2025/12/14/rob-reiner-wife-michele-found-dead-los-angeles-home/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">told</a> <em>TMZ</em>. There reportedly was no sign of forced entry.

</p>



<p>
	Said a spokesperson for the family: “It is with profound sorrow that we announce the tragic passing of Michele and Rob Reiner. We are heartbroken by this sudden loss, and we ask for privacy during this unbelievably difficult time.”

	</p>






<p>
	Citing “multiple sources,” <em>People</em> <a rel="nofollow" href="https://people.com/rob-reiner-wife-michele-were-killed-by-son-sources-11868856" target="_blank">reported</a> that the Reiners’ son Nick, 32, is the suspected killer. He battled drug addiction and homelessness, had more than a dozen stints in rehab and co-wrote a film loosely based on his life, <em>Being Charlie</em> (2015), that was directed by his father.</p>



<p>
	Near the scene Sunday just before 9 p.m., LAPD chief of detectives Alan Hamilton said “we have not identified a suspect at this time,” there “was no person of interest” and that many family members would be interviewed.</p>



<p>
	The Los Angeles Fire Department had been called to the Reiners’ home at about 3:40 p.m. by an unidentified person, and LAPD Robbery Homicide Division detectives were investigating.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	<em>The Princess Bride </em>(1987), <em>Misery</em>&nbsp;(1990), the Oscar best picture nominee <em>A Few Good Men </em>(1992)<em>, The American President </em>(1995) and&nbsp;<em>The Bucket List</em> (2007) also were among Rob Reiner’s 20-plus directing credits.

	</p>




<p>
	Reiner was also a co-founder of <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/t/castle-rock/" id="auto-tag_castle-rock_1" data-tag="castle-rock">Castle Rock</a> Entertainment, the production company behind such films as <em>City Slickers </em>(1991),<em> <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/shawshank-redemption-review-1994-movie-932222/">The Shawshank Redemption</a> </em>(1994),<em> Waiting for Guffman </em>(1996), <em>Miss Congeniality </em>(2000), <em>Best in Show </em>(2000),<em> Michael Clayton </em>(2007) and <em><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/t/seinfeld/" id="auto-tag_seinfeld_1" data-tag="seinfeld">Seinfeld</a></em>, one of the most lucrative television properties of all time.</p>



<p>
	From the outset of his feature directorial career with&nbsp;<em>This Is Spinal Tap</em>&nbsp;(1984), Reiner seemed to reimagine Hollywood standards, creating and starring in the first mainstream mockumentary — a rock ’n’ roll satire so dead-on, film critic Roger Ebert <a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-this-is-spinal-tap-1984" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">called it</a> “one of the funniest movies ever made.” From there, he would move seamlessly from comedy to drama, from fantasy to horror, as few directors ever have.</p>



<p>
	Reiner would establish yet another benchmark — this time for romantic comedies — with <em><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/harry-met-sally-1989-review-959579/">When Harry Met Sally</a></em> (1989), screenwriter Nora Ephron’s ode to true love (based loosely on her and Reiner’s lives) that starred Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan.</p>



<p>
	His biggest box office hit, the gripping courtroom drama&nbsp;<em>A Few Good Men</em>, based on Aaron Sorkin’s 1989 play and starring Tom Cruise and Jack Nicholson, could not have been more different.</p>



<p>
	Some of Reiner’s movies took a while to capture the world’s attention. <em>The Princess Bride</em>, his timeless fairy tale adventure that was based on the <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/william-goldman-dead-butch-cassidy-919295/">William Goldman</a> novel and starred Robin Wright, Mandy Patinkin and Peter Falk, was one of several films that grew in popularity over decades on the way to cult status.

	</p>




<p>
	On television, Reiner played to some of the biggest audiences in history, first in the role of Michael “Meathead” Stivic, the liberal antagonist of Carroll O’Connor’s Archie Bunker, on CBS’ <em>All in the Family</em>, and then as a ground-floor executive on NBC’s <em>Seinfeld, </em>which he fought to keep on the air.&nbsp;</p>

	“We knew we had a great show,” Reiner <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpVAERsrMOU" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">told</a> Howard Stern in 2016.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	But after a rocky launch in the summer of 1989, the network was concerned that&nbsp;<em>Seinfeld</em>&nbsp;— famously a show “about nothing” — was a misfire. After four episodes, it was on the brink of cancellation.</p>



<p>
	“I went in there and had a screaming crazy thing with [NBC president] Brandon Tartikoff,” Reiner said. “And I promised him — there&nbsp;<em>will</em>&nbsp;be&nbsp;<em>stories</em>!”</p>



<p>
	In 1993, Reiner and Castle Rock partners Andrew Scheinman, Alan Horn, Glenn Padnick and Martin Shafer sold their company to broadcast mogul Ted Turner for about $160 million. (It became part of Time Warner when it acquired Turner Broadcasting in 1996.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	The principals stayed on, holding to their original ideal: to make independent movies outside the traditional studio system. But after a run of poorly performing films starting in the late ’90s, Castle Rock initiated layoffs and eventually was absorbed into Warner Bros.</p>



<p>
	In 2020, Reiner relaunched the company and <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/rob-reiner-castle-rock-film-division-with-175m-fund-1235033565/">revived its film division</a> a year later, with <em>Spinal Tap II: The End Continues</em> (2025) among its offerings. 

	</p>




<p>
	“There’s not one film that I’ve ever made that could get made today by a studio, not one — even&nbsp;<em>A Few Good Men</em>,” Reiner said. “Every movie that I make, have made and will make is always going to be independently financed.”</p>



<p>
	Throughout his behind-the-camera career, Reiner continued as a working actor. He played the well-intentioned plastic surgeon Dr. Morris Packman, who <a href="https://youtu.be/qx1Rua92Zno?si=b7vivK1M8Oy17cuB" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">affectionately spars</a> with Goldie Hawn, in&nbsp;<em>The First Wives Club</em>&nbsp;(1996); Tom Hanks’ pal in Ephron’s <em>Sleepless in Seattle</em> (1993); and the father of Zooey Deschanel on the 2011-18 Fox sitcom&nbsp;<em>New Girl</em>.</p>



<p>
	He was <a href="https://youtu.be/VO4XYoB49Lg?si=6Y5Y8H7qPIEI6FNp" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">particularly memorable</a> in Martin Scorsese’s <em>The Wolf of Wall Street</em>&nbsp;(2013) as stockbroker Max Belfort in scenes with Leonardo DiCaprio and Jonah Hill that were largely improvised.</p>

<p>
	Reiner’s sense of what worked onscreen was honed early on — first at home as the oldest child of comedy icon <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/carl-reiner-dead-comedy-legend-720797/">Carl Reiner</a> and later around his dad’s close friends, among them <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/sid-caesar-dead-comedy-titan-679817/">Sid Caesar</a>, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/neil-simon-dead-odd-couple-748670/">Neil Simon</a>, Mel Brooks and the most influential of all, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/norman-lear-dead-all-in-the-family-jeffersons-maude-producer-1235713439/">Norman Lear</a>, the TV auteur whose 1970s activist comedies&nbsp;<em>All in the Family, The Jeffersons, Good Times </em>and<em> Maude</em> sparked seismic shifts in popular culture.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	“Norman was the first guy who recognized that I had any talent,” Reiner <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/rob-reiner-remembers-norman-lear-1235739049/">wrote for<em> The Hollywood Reporter</em></a><em> </em>in the wake of Lear’s 2023 death, noting that he viewed him as “a second father.”

	</p>




<p>
	“It wasn’t just that he hired me for&nbsp;<em>All in the Family</em>,” Reiner told <em>American Masters</em> in 2005. “It was that I saw, in how he conducted his life, that there was room to be an activist as well. That you could use your celebrity, your good fortune, to help make some change.”</p>



<p>
	As the Hollywood scion forged his directing career, it was Lear who put up the money for&nbsp;<em>Stand by Me</em>&nbsp;(1986) and Reiner’s other early films, including the John Cusack-Nicollette Sheridan romp&nbsp;<em>The Sure Thing</em> (1985), lauded for elevating the teen comedy genre.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	<em>Stand by Me</em>&nbsp;— regarded as among the finest of coming-of-age movies — marked Reiner’s ascent into Hollywood’s highest ranks, no longer just a sitcom actor or the genial ex-husband of a fellow TV comic, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/penny-marshall-dead-laverne-shirley-star-75-686405/">Penny Marshall</a>, star of&nbsp;<em>Laverne &amp; Shirley</em>. (Marshall too would go on to become a top Hollywood director.)</p>



<p>
	Famed author-screenwriter Goldman, who penned the&nbsp;<em>Misery</em>&nbsp;screenplay, said Reiner became a success because his work is “funny, but not simpy.”</p>



<p>
	“His films have a certain comedy style … a sweetness and toughness,” Goldman <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/18/movies/film-rob-reiner-applies-the-human-touch.html" target="_blank">told</a> <em>The New York Times</em> in 1987. “<em>Stand by Me&nbsp;</em>is not just about four kids coming of age before junior high school — they’re going to see a corpse. If John Hughes had made&nbsp;<em><a rel="nofollow" href="https://youtu.be/S9ZdffeniwM?si=JDkzYqkBn4nMcmSS" target="_blank">Stand by Me</a></em>&nbsp;— and I’m not knocking Hughes — they would have been searching for a convertible.”</p>



<p>
	Stephen King, author of the 1982 novella&nbsp;<em>The Body</em> (on which&nbsp;<em>Stand by Me</em>&nbsp;was based) and the 1987 novel <em>Misery</em>, became one of Reiner’s most-steadfast collaborators.&nbsp;

	</p>




<p>
	Among other King books turned into movies by Castle Rock — Reiner named the company for the fictional setting in many of the author’s novels — were&nbsp;<em>Shawshank, The Green Mile </em>(1999)and<em>&nbsp;Dolores Claiborne&nbsp;</em>(1995).</p>



<p>
	After several false starts, King finally agreed to develop&nbsp;<em><a href="https://youtu.be/R_TdSvT9ddg?si=_EjkphQR1mmvmR_n&amp;t=2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Misery</a></em>&nbsp;for the screen, but only if Reiner put “his name on it” as producer or director.</p>

<p>
	“It was a very personal book to him,” Reiner <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvfP8GyJhTU&amp;list=PLC55WRXRuDkwraIYcUC05HD-Xl6Bzq3Y1&amp;index=7" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">told</a> TCM in 2021. “It was all about himself as a writer and feeling trapped … And so he let us option the book for $1. In fact, I think we made seven Stephen King films, and each one of them we got an option for $1.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	The 1990 Kathy Bates-<a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/james-caan-dead-godfather-rollerball-1235176631/">James Caan</a> starrer remains one of Hollywood’s finest horror pieces, with Bates winning an Oscar for her role as the obsessive fan Annie Wilkes, who tortures author Paul Sheldon (Caan) while holding him hostage in her remote cabin.</p>



<p>
	“Rob had a fantastic crew of people — people he had worked with for years, just the creme de la creme,” Bates <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31FH1qmtbZY" target="_blank">said</a> of the&nbsp;<em>Misery</em>&nbsp;shoot in a 2020 interview with <em>Vanity Fair</em>. “I learned so much just hanging out [on set] and watching.”</p>



<p>
	Bates, 42 years old at the time, had predominantly been a stage actress. At the Academy Awards, where she bested Meryl Streep, Joanne Woodward, Anjelica Huston and Julia Roberts, she thanked Reiner “for taking a chance on me.”</p>



<p>
	Often the most memorable scenes in Reiner’s filmography came from his comedies — notably Ryan’s climactic moment in&nbsp;<em>When Harry Met Sally</em> in which she <a href="https://youtu.be/lNEX0fbGePg?si=0lQSLG39OH3fCA-6" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">feigns an orgasm</a> over lunch with Crystal’s character at Katz’s Deli.

	</p>




<p>
	Yet it was Reiner’s mother, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/estelle-reiner-dies-at-94-121976/">Estelle Reiner</a>, who landed the film’s renowned punchline: “I’ll have what she’s having.”</p>



<p>
	“I said to her, mom, the line you have is the last line in the scene, and if it doesn’t pop and top everything that’s come before it, I won’t use it,” Reiner <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/dpHtWNfmSjU" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">told</a> the AFI in a joint interview with Ephron in 2009. “We’ll shoot it but be prepared, it might have to be cut.</p>



<p>
	“And she said, ‘I don’t care, I just wanna spend the day with you and be with you on the set. I don’t care if it’s in the movie or not.’”&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	Robert Reiner&nbsp;was born in the Bronx on March 6, 1947, one of three children of the former Estelle Lebost, an artist and set designer, and Carl Reiner, the comic and writer who got his start as an entertainer in the U.S. Army and then in Broadway musicals.</p>



<p>
	The family lived just off Grand Concourse, across the street from Marshall and her brother, future writer-producer-director <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/garry-marshall-dead-happy-days-912665/">Garry Marshall</a>. But it would be decades before Rob and Penny actually met — at the 1970 audition in Los Angeles for the roles of Mike and Gloria Stivik on&nbsp;<em>All in the Family</em>. (The role of Gloria, of course, would go to Sally Struthers.)</p>



<p>
	As Carl’s career gained steam (he would win 11 Emmys), the family moved to Bonnie Meadow Road in the bucolic New York suburb of New Rochelle. It was the very street where Reiner would set his landmark 1960s CBS sitcom&nbsp;<em>The Dick Van Dyke Show</em>, about a rising comedy writer, Rob Petrie, and his beautiful wife, Laura.

	</p>




<p>
	“Basically he wrote his own life in&nbsp;<em>The Dick Van Dyke Show</em>,” Rob Reiner said of his father. “And my mother was <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/mary-tyler-moore-dead-at-80-719799/">Mary Tyler Moore</a>.”</p>

<p>
	Rob got his start as an apprentice at the Bucks County Playhouse in Pennsylvania and with small guest roles on such shows as&nbsp;<em>That Girl, Room 222&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>The Beverly Hillbillies.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>
	After UCLA Film School in 1967, he was paired with another young comic, Steve Martin, as a writing team on CBS’&nbsp;<em>The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour</em>. The two were barely out of their teens.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	The&nbsp;<em>All in the Family</em>&nbsp;role, for which Reiner would&nbsp;win two Emmys, followed in 1971. Convinced the show’s incendiary subject matter would be rejected by viewers, he initially viewed the gig as a stopgap to tide him over between writing gigs.</p>



<p>
	When the sitcom became a hit (Reiner stayed for eight of its nine seasons), he continued writing anyway, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://youtu.be/vA9PJARSCC0?si=ovJfI5uTz7wOu5k4" target="_blank">penning four episodes of the show</a> and co-writing (with Garry Marshall and Phil Mishkin) the first episode of ABC’s <em>Happy Days</em> in 1974.</p>

</div>



<p>
	As a filmmaker notably surrounding himself with many of the industry’s top writers — Goldman, King, Sorkin, Ephron, Crystal — Reiner showcased their dialogue to everlasting effect.</p>



<p>
	<em>The Princess Bride’s</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/24qcCD2Cskg?si=1IXUYlU1D33GcRJv" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">“Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die”</a>; <em>Misery’s</em> “I’m your No. 1 fan”;&nbsp;<em>A Few Good Men’s</em>&nbsp;“You can’t handle the truth”; and&nbsp;<em>When Harry Met Sally’s</em>&nbsp;“I’ll have what she’s having” (Crystal actually came up with that line) reigned in pop culture for decades.

	</p>




<p>
	But as Penny Marshall would humorously point out, no matter how substantive their accomplishments, “For me, all they say is ‘Laverne,’ and for Rob … it’s ‘Meathead,’” she <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/09/17/charmed-life" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">told</a> the <em>New Yorker</em> in 2012. “We’re stuck with it.”</p>



<p>
	The couple performed together infrequently but did co-star in the well-received 1978 romantic comedy <em><a href="https://youtu.be/5dZdVEHmhXA?si=NSLXy7S0oomfelm8&amp;t=46" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">More Than Friends</a>.</em>&nbsp;The ABC telefilm, written by Reiner and Mishkin and directed by James Burrows, was something of a precursor to&nbsp;<em>When Harry Met Sally</em>, about childhood pals unsure if they should pursue love as adults.</p>



<p>
	Reiner also made an appearance as “Sheldn” (no “o”), the fiancé of Penny’s Myrna Turner, on Garry Marshall’s ABC series&nbsp;<em>The Odd Couple.</em></p>



<p>
	Their 10-year marriage came to an end in 1981 — amid tension as&nbsp;<em>Laverne &amp; Shirley</em>&nbsp;shot Marshall to superstardom while Reiner was quietly forging his post-sitcom film career.</p>



<p>
	Upon Marshall’s death in 2018, Reiner professed his admiration for her, tweeting “so sad about Penny.” He added, “I loved Penny. I grew up with her. She was born with a great gift. She was born with a funny bone and the instinct of how to use it. I was very lucky to have lived with her and her funny bone. I will miss her.”</p>



<p>
	The couple were the parents of actress Tracy Reiner, born in 1964 to Marshall during a brief first marriage and adopted by Reiner soon after their 1971 wedding.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	In 1989, Reiner married Michele Singer, a photographer whom he met on the set of&nbsp;<em>When Harry Met Sally</em>. He said she was the inspiration for the film’s happily-ever-after script change. In 2020, she joined Reiner in running Castle Rock and produced films. 

	</p>




<p>
	In addition to Nick, the couple had two other children, son Jake and daughter Romy.</p>



<p>
	A lifelong political activist who with King was among the public figures to urge President Joe Biden to hand the 2024 re-election reins to Kamala Harris, Reiner rarely missed a week on social media, penning calls to action on a range of social justice issues for his millions of followers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	He was among Hollywood’s most vigorous and constant voices opposing Donald Trump.</p>



<p>
	Among his other causes, Reiner was the co-founder of the American Foundation for Equal Rights, which fought to overturn California’s ban on same-sex marriage. In the late-’90s, he and his father were activists for higher taxes on cigarettes — money that was earmarked for prenatal care.</p>



<p>
	His advocacy was often part of his writing and filmmaking, from his earliest days with the Smothers brothers to <em>LBJ</em> (2016) and <em>Shock and Awe</em> (2017), about journalists investigating the Bush administration’s 2003 invasion of Iraq.</p>



<p>
	Reiner was often a Hollywood peacemaker, well known for putting actors and crew at ease. When Bates and Caan clashed early in the production of <em>Misery</em> (she liked rehearsing; he preferred winging it), Reiner brokered a wary peace while using the tension to elicit superb performances.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	“I want everyone around me to feel comfortable and happy,” he <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jul/19/i-want-everyone-to-be-happy-how-rob-reiner-became-a-great-director-and-a-political-hero" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">told</a> <em>The Guardian</em> in 2018. “People only act up out of insecurity, and when they make it difficult, I just say, ‘We’re playing make-believe here — enjoy yourself!’”

But this misses his <i>moment</i>.&nbsp;</p><p>In the mid-1970s, Varley exploded into science fiction like a phoenix. His "Eight Worlds" stories were set in a future where hyper-powerful aliens have killed everyone on Earth as a threat to its whales and porpoises and humanity survives everywhere else in the Solar System. Despite this bleak background, the stories were bright and inventive. People change gender on a whim. Wealthy and glorious cities turn to shacks and hovels when their holographic fronts are turned off at night. People bank their memories so that, upon death, they can be restarted with new memories. He wrote so many major stories per year that, in a resurrection of an old pulp-days practice, some had to be published under a pseudonym.</p><p>We were all dazzled. His work was full of impressive new ideas. And, outside of the Eight Worlds sequence, he wrote things like "In the Hall of the Martian Kings," which resurrected the possibility of intelligent life on Mars after the Mariner probes had apparently disproved that. Or "Air Raid," which made air travel terrifying again.&nbsp;</p><p>His novel <i>Titan </i>looked to be the opening of a classic trilogy.</p><p>Briefly--for almost a decade--John Varley seemed to be the new Robert Heinlein.</p><p>And then, alas, he went to Hollywood.&nbsp;</p><p>Hollywood paid him to write, rewrite, and rererewrite a script for <i>Millennium </i>(based on "Air Raid") while five directors came and went. Unsurprisingly, the result pleased nobody--most particularly Varley himself. His novelization of the movie made that abundantly clear. Then, by the man's own testimony, he was paid more and more and more money to write scripts that were never made.</p><p>After too long an absence, Varley returned to print. He was every bit as good a writer as he'd ever been. But his ideas were no longer new. In his absence, writers like William Gibson and Neal Stephenson had moved the cutting edge along.</p><p>Thereafter, Varley was only a very good science fiction writer. It is this person that most of his readers will mourn.</p><p>But I will mourn the man who, for a time, seemed to be the resurrection of science fiction, the New Heinlein, the <i>kwisatz haderach</i>&nbsp;of genre. Back then, he set the standard. His were the stories we all wanted to equal and perhaps surpass. He was the reason we read science fiction in the first place.</p><p>Long, long ago, when I was yet unpublished, I found myself talking with Isaac Asimov at I forget which convention, when John Varley cruised by, trailed by enthusiastic fans. Asimov gazed sadly after him and said, "Look at him. A decade ago, everybody was asking, 'Who is John Varley?' A decade from now, everybody will be asking, 'Who is Isaac Asimov?'"</p><p>And<i>&nbsp;that</i>&nbsp;was John Varley's moment.</p><p><i>Above: Photo taken from <b>Worlds Without End. </b>Go <a href="https://www.worldswithoutend.com/">here </a>to explore it.</i></p><p>*</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’ve used SoundCloud for over 10 years. In my country it’s blocked, so a VPN isn’t a choice — it’s the only way to access music at all. Now proxy and VPN requests are blocked too, and I’m locked out completely.</p>

<p>I’m not a bot, not scraping, not abusing anything. I just want to listen to music that’s been part of my life for a decade. Being cut off from that because of where I live feels unfair and exhausting.</p>

<p>This is what “internet freedom” looks like for many of us: blocked by our country, then blocked again by the platform. I really hope SoundCloud considers users who <em>depend</em> on VPNs just to exist online.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Microsoft's Copilot AI chatbot is arguably one of the most controversial add-ons ever implemented in the Windows 11 operating system. However, the controversy doesn't stop at PC operating systems. It seems to extend to TVs as well. According to Reddit user u/defjam16, his LG TV webOS received an update that installed Microsoft's Copilot AI app, with no option to remove it. Although users can choose to ignore it, the push for increased AI integration in everyday products is becoming unavoidable, even on TVs. What exactly can a Copilot AI app do in your TV? We don't know either.</p><p>

Microsoft is likely promoting its Copilot on TVs to capture more of the AI app market, aiming to become the go-to platform for AI inquiries. Since webOS is a Linux-based TV operating system LG uses, it is also possible that Microsoft is preparing the Copilot AI app for a wider rollout to Linux users, who are now officially commanding a 3% market share among PCs. Other TV operating system platforms are also at "risk" of getting a dedicated Microsoft Copilot AI app, which is especially bad for people not wanting their TV to do any AI processing.</p><p><a href="https://www.techpowerup.com/img/LyjhnECZ5Iamtqd9.jpg" target="_blank" data-width="1377" data-height="960" data-fancybox="g344075"><img src="https://tpucdn.com/img/LyjhnECZ5Iamtqd9_thm.jpg" width="186" height="130" alt=""></a> <a href="https://www.techpowerup.com/img/GLz7iYOgnpmCkRQD.jpg" target="_blank" data-width="1707" data-height="960" data-fancybox="g344075"><img src="https://tpucdn.com/img/GLz7iYOgnpmCkRQD_thm.jpg" width="231" height="130" alt=""></a> </p><p>Additionally, LG has a setting called "Live Plus" that Reddit users highlighted. When it's turned on, the TV can recognize what's displayed on screen and use that viewing information for personalized recommendations and ads. LG describes it as an "enhanced viewing experience," but you can disable it in the menu under Settings &gt; All Settings &gt; General &gt; Additional Settings (though exact wording varies by model). This likely uses another AI model to help sort the user data and make recommendations.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-dtm-region="articulo_cuerpo"><p>It can’t be seen or touched, but it’s shaking up markets and attracting investment. <a href="https://english.elpais.com/society/2025-07-17/is-artificial-intelligence-turning-off-our-minds.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/society/2025-07-17/is-artificial-intelligence-turning-off-our-minds.html">Artificial intelligence</a> (AI) has become the object of desire for Big Tech, which is <a href="https://english.elpais.com/economy-and-business/2025-11-22/techs-ai-debt-surge-cools-market-fever.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/economy-and-business/2025-11-22/techs-ai-debt-surge-cools-market-fever.html">pouring astronomical sums</a> into its development, fueled by record profits. The other side of this frenzy is workforce reductions, with automation as the backdrop, announced by multinationals like Amazon, Meta, and UPS, which, incidentally, threaten to extend the impact of new technologies to another area: public coffers. Fewer people working means fewer taxpayers, so the question naturally arises: if <a href="https://english.elpais.com/economy-and-business/2024-11-17/workers-fear-the-age-of-robots-will-a-machine-take-my-job.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/economy-and-business/2024-11-17/workers-fear-the-age-of-robots-will-a-machine-take-my-job.html">machines and algorithms replace humans in their jobs</a>, should they also have to cover the taxes that humans stop paying?</p><p>Labor, through income tax and social security contributions, is one of the pillars of the tax systems of almost all countries, and the impact of automation on the tax base — or, in other words, the potential decrease in revenue — is not a new concern. In 2019, Nobel laureate Edmund Phelps proposed a tax on robots to help maintain social benefits. Shortly before, <a href="https://english.elpais.com/eps/2025-02-03/bill-gates-i-hope-elon-musk-thinks-carefully-about-what-he-says.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/eps/2025-02-03/bill-gates-i-hope-elon-musk-thinks-carefully-about-what-he-says.html">Bill Gates</a>, founder of one of the world’s largest technology companies, Microsoft, which has its own artificial intelligence (Copilot), had suggested applying the same tax burden to robots as would be borne by the workers they replace.</p><p>“The trend toward automation and AI could lead to a decrease in tax revenues. In the United States, for example, about 85% of federal tax revenue comes from labor income,” says Sanjay Patnaik, director of the Center for Regulation and Markets at the Brookings Institution. He suggests that governments address “the risks posed by AI” by increasing capital gains taxation rather than creating a specific tax on it, due to the difficulties in designing such a tax and the distortions it could generate. The repeated use of the conditional tense is because the impact of <a href="https://english.elpais.com/technology/2024-05-26/generative-ai-digs-the-graves-of-traditional-search-engines-and-virtual-assistants.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/technology/2024-05-26/generative-ai-digs-the-graves-of-traditional-search-engines-and-virtual-assistants.html">generative AI</a>, the kind capable of creating content on demand, is still uncertain, both in positive terms — improved productivity and economic growth — and negative terms; job losses.</p><p>Even so, forecasts are mixed. Goldman Sachs, for example, estimates that AI will boost global GDP by 7% over the next decade; the IMF predicts it will contribute up to eight-tenths of a percentage point annually to growth between now and 2030. On the other hand, the International Labour Organization estimates that one in four workers worldwide, concentrated in high-income countries, holds a job with some degree of exposure to AI, but at the same time predicts that most jobs will be transformed rather than disappear.</p><p>“We know there will be an impact, but it’s difficult to quantify,” confirms Luz Rodríguez, a professor of labor law and a former Spanish Secretary of State for Employment. “The previous wave of automation affected employment in the middle of the production chain; generative AI is targeting higher up the ladder, more skilled jobs that require critical thinking,” she summarizes. “I’m not optimistic, but I am positive: there are jobs being created that wouldn’t exist without new technologies, such as <a href="https://english.elpais.com/economy-and-business/2024-01-29/the-horrors-experienced-by-meta-moderators-i-didnt-know-what-humans-are-capable-of.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/economy-and-business/2024-01-29/the-horrors-experienced-by-meta-moderators-i-didnt-know-what-humans-are-capable-of.html">content moderators</a> on social media or <a href="https://english.elpais.com/climate/2024-08-20/bitcoin-mining-uses-the-same-amount-of-energy-as-argentina-while-laptops-need-a-ton-of-material.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/climate/2024-08-20/bitcoin-mining-uses-the-same-amount-of-energy-as-argentina-while-laptops-need-a-ton-of-material.html">Bitcoin miners</a>.”</p><p>Daniel Waldenström, a professor at the Stockholm Institute for Industrial Economics, rejects the idea of a specific tax on AI, arguing that there has been no significant increase in unemployment, even in the United States, the birthplace of these new technologies and a leader in their implementation. He also emphasizes the difficulty in defining it precisely: “What are automation, robots, or AI? A chip, a humanoid machine, an application, or a computer program? We will never be able to define it precisely. We should continue taxing what already exists: income from labor, consumption, and capital gains.”</p><p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has also joined the debate. In a report published last summer, the organization’s economists reached a mixed conclusion: they did not recommend specifically taxing AI — as this could stifle productivity and distort the market — but urged governments to remain vigilant against potential disruptive scenarios. Their proposals included raising taxes on capital — which have been decreasing as the tax burden on labor has increased — creating a supplementary tax on “excessive” corporate profits, and reviewing tax incentives for innovation, patents, and other intangible assets that, while boosting productivity, can also displace human jobs.</p><p>Carl Frey, associate professor of AI and Work at Oxford University and author of the book <i>How Progress Ends </i>(Princeton University Press, 2025), holds a similar view: he does not support an AI tax, but acknowledges that the tax system has become unbalanced. “In many OECD economies, we have seen an increase in income taxes and a decrease in capital taxes,” he notes. This system incentivizes companies to invest more in automation than in job-creating technologies. “Addressing this imbalance is essential to supporting the job-creating technologies of the future.”</p><p>The recent moves by major tech companies and the evolution of tax systems in recent years justify this concern. Amazon, for example, has announced a 38% increase in profits and multimillion-dollar investments in AI, while simultaneously reporting 14,000 job cuts worldwide. Meanwhile, corporate tax rates have plummeted in the last decade in OECD countries, from 33% in 2000 to the current 25%; the tax wedge for workers — income tax and social security contributions — has decreased by only 1.3 percentage points in the same period, from 36.2% to 34.9%.</p><p>Susanne Bieller, secretary general of the International Federation of Robotics, argues that applying ad hoc taxes stems from “a problem that doesn’t exist,” since automation and robots “create new jobs by increasing productivity.” She warns that taxing production tools instead of business profits “would have a negative impact” on competitiveness and employment. “We need incentives for [European] companies to use technologies like robots and digitalization to remain competitive globally,” she concludes. “The world faces a labor shortage of approximately 40 million jobs per year [...] Robots cannot take over entire jobs, but they can handle certain tasks.”</p><h3>Inequality</h3><p>In addition to employment, the soaring spending of major tech companies on AI and the surge in their stock prices are causing concern, <a href="https://english.elpais.com/economy-and-business/2024-07-14/ai-swings-between-market-euphoria-and-the-specter-of-a-bubble.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/economy-and-business/2024-07-14/ai-swings-between-market-euphoria-and-the-specter-of-a-bubble.html">raising fears of a bubble</a>. Analysts also warn that the energy consumption of these technologies is so high that their climate footprint could offset the promised growth benefits.</p><p>In the best-case scenario, the new jobs created by AI could be “more productive, better paid, and more accessible,” offsetting job and tax losses, predicts Patnaik. However, the latent — and very likely — risk remains that the process will not be automatic. Job creation could be delayed, less-skilled professionals could struggle to adapt, and a gap could emerge between countries — and within them — and across productive sectors.</p><p>MIT economists Daron Acemoğlu and Simon Johnson warned about this in 2023. “Over the past four decades, automation has increased productivity and multiplied corporate profits, but it has not led to shared prosperity in industrialized countries,” they cautioned in a document for the IMF. “Technology and artificial intelligence produce social impacts that are relevant to politics. We cannot allow technological determinism,” Rodríguez asserts. “The debate is necessary, and we will go wherever we want to go.”</p><p><i>Sign up for </i><a href="https://plus.elpais.com/newsletters/lnp/1/333/?lang=en" target="_self" rel="" title="https://plus.elpais.com/newsletters/lnp/1/333/?lang=en"><i>our weekly newsletter</i></a><i> to get more English-language news coverage from EL PAÍS USA Edition </i></p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    
    
    <div>
        <p>We spent fifteen years watching <a href="https://a16z.com/why-software-is-eating-the-world/">software eat the world</a>. Entire industries got swallowed by software - retail, media, finance - you name it, there has been incredible disruption over the past couple of decades with a proliferation of SaaS tooling. This has led to a huge swath of SaaS companies - valued, collectively, in the trillions.</p>
<p>In my last post debating if the cost of <a href="https://martinalderson.com/posts/has-the-cost-of-software-just-dropped-90-percent/">software has dropped 90%</a> with AI coding agents I mainly looked at the <em>supply</em> side of the market. What will happen to <em>demand</em> for SaaS tooling if this hypothesis plays out? I've been thinking a lot about these second and third order effects of the changes in software engineering.</p>
<p>The calculus on build vs buy is starting to change. Software ate the world. Agents are going to eat SaaS.</p>
<h2>The signals I'm seeing</h2>
<p>The obvious place to start is simply demand starting to evaporate - especially for "simpler" SaaS tools. I'm sure many software engineers have started to realise this - many things I'd think to find a freemium or paid service for I can get an agent to often solve in a few minutes, exactly the way I want it. The interesting thing is I didn't even notice the shift. It just happened.</p>
<p>If I want an internal dashboard, I don't even think that Retool or similar would make it easier. I just build the dashboard. If I need to re-encode videos as part of a media ingest process, I just get Claude Code to write a robust wrapper round ffmpeg - and not incur all the cost (and speed) of sending the raw files to a separate service, hitting tier limits or trying to fit another API's mental model in my head.</p>
<p>This is even more pronounced for less pure software development tasks. For example, I've had Gemini 3 produce really high quality UI/UX mockups and wireframes in minutes - not needing to use a separate service or find some templates to start with. Equally, when I want to do a presentation, I don't need to use a platform to make my slides look nice - I just get Claude Code to export my markdown into a nicely designed PDF.</p>
<p>The other, potentially more impactful, shift I'm starting to see is people really questioning renewal quotes from larger "enterprise" SaaS companies. While this is very early, I believe this is a really important emerging behaviour. I've seen a few examples now where SaaS vendor X sends through their usual annual double-digit % increase in price, and now teams are starting to ask "do we actually need to pay this, or could we just build what we need ourselves?". A year ago that would be a hypothetical question at best with a quick 'no' conclusion. Now it's a real option people are putting real effort into thinking through.</p>
<p>Finally, most SaaS products contain many features that many customers don't need or use. A lot of the complexity in SaaS product engineering is managing that - which evaporates overnight when you have only one customer (your organisation). And equally, this customer has complete control of the roadmap when it is the same person. No more hoping that the SaaS vendor prioritises your requests over other customers.</p>
<h2>The maintenance objection</h2>
<p>The key objection to this is "who maintains these apps?". Which is a genuine, correct objection to have. Software has bugs to fix, scale problems to solve, security issues to patch and that isn't changing.</p>
<p>I think firstly it's important to point out that a <em>lot</em> of SaaS is poorly maintained (and in my experience, often the more expensive it is, the poorer the quality). Often, the security risk comes from having an external third party <em>itself</em> needing to connect and interface with internal data. If you can just move this all behind your existing VPN or access solution, you suddenly reduce your organisation's attack surface dramatically.</p>
<p>On top of this, agents <em>themselves</em> lower maintenance cost dramatically. Some of the most painful maintenance tasks I've had - updating from deprecated libraries to another one with more support - are made significantly easier with agents, especially in statically typed programming ecosystems. Additionally, the biggest hesitancy with companies building internal tools is having one person know everything about it - and if they leave, all the internal knowledge goes. Agents don't leave. And with a well thought through AGENTS.md file, they can explain the codebase to anyone in the future.</p>
<p>Finally, SaaS comes with maintenance problems too. A recent flashpoint I've seen this month from a friend is a SaaS company deciding to deprecate their existing API endpoints and move to another set of APIs, which don't have all the same methods available. As this is an essential system, this is a huge issue and requires an enormous amount of resource to update, test and rollout the affected integrations.</p>
<p>I'm not suggesting that SMEs with no real software knowledge are going to suddenly replace their entire SaaS suite. What I do think is starting to happen is that organisations with some level of tech capability and understanding are going to think even more critically at their SaaS procurement and vendor lifecycle.</p>
<h2>The economics problem for SaaS</h2>
<p>SaaS valuations are built on two key assumptions: fast customer growth and high NRR (often exceeding 100%).</p>
<p>I think we can start to see a world already where demand from new customers for certain segments of tooling and apps begins to decline. That's a problem, and will cause an increase in the sales and marketing expenditure of these companies.</p>
<p>However, the more insidious one is net revenue retention (NRR) declines. NRR is a measure of how much existing customers spend with you on an ongoing basis, adjusted for churn. If your NRR is at 100%, your existing cohort of customers are spending the same. If it's less than that then they are spending less with you <em>and/or</em> customers are leaving overall.</p>
<p>Many great SaaS companies have NRR significantly above 100%. This is the beauty of a lot of SaaS business models - companies grow and require more users added to their plan. Or they need to upgrade from a lower priced tier to a higher one to gain additional features. These increases are generally <em>very</em> profitable. You don't need to spend a fortune on sales and marketing to get this uptick (you already have a relationship with them) and the profit margin of adding another 100 user licenses to a SaaS product for a customer is somewhere close to infinity.</p>
<p>This is where I think some SaaS companies will get badly hit. People will start migrating parts of the solution away to self-built/modified internal platforms to avoid having to pay significantly more for the next pricing tier up. Or they'll ingest the data from your platform via your APIs and build internal dashboards and reporting which means they can remove 80% of their user licenses.</p>
<h2>Where this doesn't work (and what still has a moat)</h2>
<p>The obvious one is anything that requires very high uptime and SLAs. Getting to four or five 9s is really hard, and building high availability systems gets really difficult - and it's very easy to shoot yourself in the foot building them. As such, things like payment processing and other core infrastructure are pretty safe in my eyes. You're not (yet) going to replace Stripe and all their engineering work on core payments easily with an agent.</p>
<p>Equally, very high volume systems and data lakes are difficult to replace. It's not trivial to spin up clusters for huge datasets or transaction volumes. This again requires specialised knowledge that is likely to be in short supply at your organisation, if it exists at all.</p>
<p>The other one is software with significant network effects - where you collaborate with people, especially external to your organisation. Slack is a great example - it's not something you are going to replace with an in-house tool. Equally, products with rich integration ecosystems and plugin marketplaces have a real advantage here.</p>
<p>And companies that have proprietary datasets are still very valuable. Financial data, sales intelligence and the like stay valuable. If anything, I think these companies have a real edge as agents can leverage this data in new ways - they get more locked in.</p>
<p>And finally, regulation and compliance is still very important. Many industries require regulatory compliance - this isn't going to change overnight.</p>
<p>This does require your organisation having the skills (internally or externally) to manage these newly created apps. I think products and people involved in SRE and DevOps are going to have a real upswing in demand. I suspect we'll see entirely new functions and teams in companies solely dedicated to managing these new applications. This does of course have a cost, but this cost can be often managed by existing SRE or DevOps functions, or if it requires new headcount and infrastructure, amortised over a much higher number of apps.</p>
<h2>Who's most at risk?</h2>
<p>To me the companies that are at serious risk are back-office tools that are really just CRUD logic - or simple dashboards and analytics on top of their customers' <em>own data</em>.</p>
<p>These tools often generate a lot of friction - because they don't work <em>exactly</em> the way the customer wants them to - and they are tools that are the most easily replaced with agents. It's very easy to document the existing system and tell the agent to build something, but with the pain points removed.</p>
<p>SaaS certainly isn't dead. Like any major shifts in technology, there are winners and losers. I do think the bar is going to be much higher for many SaaS products that don't have a clear moat or proprietary knowledge.</p>
<p>What's going to be difficult to predict is how quickly agents can move up the value chain. I'm assuming that agents can't manage complex database clusters - but I'm not sure that's going to be the case for much longer.</p>
<p>And I'm not seeing a path for every company to suddenly replace all their SaaS spend. If anything, I think we'll see (another) splintering in the market. Companies with strong internal technical ability vs those that don't. This becomes yet another competitive advantage for those that do - and those that don't will likely see dramatically increased costs as SaaS providers try and recoup some of the lost sales from the first group to the second who are less able to switch away.</p>
<p>But my key takeaway would be that if your product is just a SQL wrapper on a billing system, you now have thousands of competitors: engineers at your customers with a spare Friday afternoon with an agent.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I was having the Claude CLI clean up my packages in an old repo, and it nuked my whole Mac! What the hell? Has anyone ever had this happen? I’m trying to figure out if this is even reversible. So much work lost..</p>

<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/egjqmw80bv5g1.png?width=464&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cbec70edc4fcff42bebcf3c9cc04ec755fb4b10b">https://preview.redd.it/egjqmw80bv5g1.png?width=464&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cbec70edc4fcff42bebcf3c9cc04ec755fb4b10b</a></p>

<p>CLAUDE response - I found the problem and it's really bad. Looking at your log, here's the catastrophic command that was run:</p>

<p>bash</p>

<pre><code>rm -rf tests/ patches/ plan/ ~/
</code></pre>

<p>See that ~/ at the end? That's your entire home directory. The Claude Code instance accidentally included ~/ in the deletion command, which would wipe out:</p>

<ul>
<li>Your entire Desktop (~/Desktop)</li>
<li>Documents, Downloads, everything</li>
<li>Your Keychain (~/Library/Keychains)</li>
<li>Claude credentials (~/.claude)</li>
<li>Application support data</li>
<li>Basically everything in /Users/...</li>
</ul>

<p>This explains why:</p>

<ol>
<li>Your desktop is gone</li>
<li>Your keychain was deleted</li>
<li>Your Claude credentials disappeared</li>
<li>The error at the end says "current working directory was deleted"</li>
</ol>

    <p>Following in Amazon's footsteps, two student projects independently use 'collaborative filtering' to bring recommendations and social networking to online music; soon they will join forces.</p>
    <p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cybercultural.com/img/s7y_ZacaIh-1262.webp 1262w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 1280px"><img loading="eager" decoding="async" src="https://cybercultural.com/img/s7y_ZacaIh-1262.jpeg" alt="Last.fm, 2003" width="1262" height="822"></picture>
<em>Last.fm circa 2003; via <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lastfm/2214547016/in/album-72157603783043503" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Last.fm Flickr account</a>.</em></p>
<p>What we now know as the “social web” — or <a href="https://cybercultural.com/web20/">Web 2.0</a> — didn’t arrive until <a href="https://cybercultural.com/p/003-the-first-web-20-conference-2004/">around 2004</a>. But the first inklings of it were emerging a couple of years before. As usual, music was the harbinger.</p>
<p>Last.fm was founded in 2002 by a group of four Austrian and German students from Ravensbourne College of Design and Communication in London. It was fashioned as an internet radio station that allowed a user to build a listening profile and share it with others. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030202060344/http://www.iamnotalone.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">year of its launch</a>, Last.fm won a young talent award <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20021203235223/http://www.toptalents.at/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at the Europrix</a>, a multimedia awards show based in Vienna. This was how the product was described in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030208055311/http://www.toptalents.at/top_talents/team01.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a showcase video</a> (embedded below) leading up to the awards ceremony:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“After repeated use, the system builds a listening profile that increasingly reflects the user's preferences. The sum of all profiles is visualized in the ‘Map of Music,’ a presentation of musical connections and genres determined only by the collaborative effort of Last.fm users.”</p>
</blockquote>
  
<p>When the students went up to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPR_5nu0Wg0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">receive their award</a>, one of them, Thomas Willomitzer, noted the importance of “collaborative filtering” to the Last.fm system. The idea was that the Last.fm algorithm would recommend music you might like, based on your listening history combined with the listening history of other, similar, users. Willomitzer added that this type of algorithm would be familiar to people who used Amazon.com.</p>
<p>Here's a video of the Last.fm founders presenting at Europrix 2002, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiJ0Z3k6Z0k" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via Thomas Willomitzer</a>:</p>
  
<p><a href="http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/xerox/parc/techReports/CSL-92-10_Using_Collaborative_Filtering_to_Weave_an_Information_Tapestry.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Collaborative filtering</a> was a common technique in recommender systems, and its history dated back to before the web — for instance, it was the basis for a 1992 Xerox PARC email system called ‘Tapestry.’ But collaborative filtering really came into its own during the web era, and in particular it was popularised by Amazon. By 2002, Amazon users were familiar with the following message: “Customers who bought items in your Shopping Cart also bought…” There was also a “Your Recommendations” list on the Amazon.com homepage. Both of these features were created using an algorithm that Amazon called “item-to-item collaborative filtering.” As explained in <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1167344" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a research paper</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Rather than matching the user to similar customers, item-to-item collaborative filtering matches each of the user’s purchased and rated items to similar items, then combines those similar items into a recommendation list.”</p>
</blockquote>

<em>Amazon collaborative filtering examples; via research paper by Greg Linden, Brent Smith and Jeremy York, published by the IEEE Computer Society in January-February 2003 edition.</em></p>
<p>The key here is that <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~samir/498/Amazon-Recommendations.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon’s collaborative filtering</a> was done based on the items people bought or rated, not the profiles of its users. This approach was also crucial to how new social web services like Last.fm would develop. The “map of music” that Last.fm created was all about mapping which songs (or genres) were interconnected — so a certain Bob Dylan song might have a strong connection to a certain Joni Mitchell song, based on listener data, and thus the Mitchell song might come up as a recommendation for people who listened to the Dylan song (and vice versa).</p>
<h2>Audioscrobbler</h2>
<p>By coincidence, another student in the UK was also working on a recommendation system for music in 2002. Audioscrobbler was started as a computer science project by Richard Jones at the University of Southampton. Jones coined the term “audioscrobbling" (later shortened to “scrobbling”) to describe the process of tracking songs that you listen to in order to make a listening profile, which is then used for recommendations.</p>
<p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cybercultural.com/img/P-viF2T9BI-690.webp 690w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 1280px"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://cybercultural.com/img/P-viF2T9BI-690.jpeg" alt="Richard Jones Audioscrobbler" width="690" height="460"></picture>
<em>Richard Jones profile on University of Southampton website, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040110153325/http://www.externalrelations.soton.ac.uk/media/0348.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">20 March 2003</a>.</em></p>
<p>In <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20031015001641/http://www.dolphin.soton.ac.uk/April2003/audioscrobbler.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an April 2003 interview</a> with his University’s paper, twenty-year old Jones explained how Audioscrobbler worked:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Users of the system need to download software on to their computer that monitors what artists they listen to. The data is then collated and a pattern emerges by way of a technique known as ‘collaborative filtering.’ The results are then recorded against a username and can be compared with the listening tastes of other members.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Later, Jones would team up with the Ravensbourne College students and fold his project into Last.fm, but even in 2002 — when they were independent products — it is striking how similar the two systems were. Both used collaborative filtering to create song recommendations, and both aimed to create a kind of social network based around what users listened to.</p>

<h2>Escaping the Broadcast Model</h2>
<p>The key to the emerging social web would be that you discover new content and communities by <em>following other people</em>. For music, the idea was to help you break away from the established broadcast model. At the Europrix event, Last.fm’s Martin Stiksel brought out a 1980s-style transistor radio to illustrate the point. If you want to listen to music on such a device, Stiksel explained, you have to tune the frequency band to find your station. If you don’t like the music playing on that station, you tune the dial to another radio station and try your luck again.</p>
<p>“The inherent problem with broadcast media is that basically, at the end of the day, it's always somebody else selecting the music for you,” said Stiksel. “So there's always a bunch of editors or programmers that picked the music and put them into into a program for you.”</p>
<p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cybercultural.com/img/jziW31p_lP-600.webp 600w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 1280px"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://cybercultural.com/img/jziW31p_lP-600.jpeg" alt="Last.fm and radio, 2002" width="600" height="460"></picture>
<em>Three Last.fm founders in 2002 with a transister radio, "from the 80s, I believe."</em></p>
<p>With Last.fm, the stream of music you heard was a mix of manual choice and algorithmic selection. You might start with a song already in your online “record collection” (the term Stiksel kept using), or start from another user’s profile. From then on, songs would be chosen for you based on collaborative filtering. If you played a song through, the Last.fm software automatically added it to your own collection. You could also press a “love” button to add it. But if you didn’t like a certain track, you could press a “hate” button (so it wouldn’t get played again), or click the “skip” button to move to the next song. There was also a “change” button to go to a different user profile.</p>
<p>The early Last.fm user interface was, in truth, a bit cluttered with all these different buttons and various search boxes — but over time it would get more streamlined.</p>
<p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cybercultural.com/img/Xiq6KcW_jY-1263.webp 1263w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 1280px"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://cybercultural.com/img/Xiq6KcW_jY-1263.jpeg" alt="Last.fm circa November 2003" width="1263" height="819"></picture>
<em>Last.fm circa November 2003; <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lastfm/2214547020/in/album-72157603783043503" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via Flickr</a>.</em></p>
<p>Stiksel explained that the idea for Last.fm came about when the students asked themselves, “how do you look for something that you don't know?” So in the case of music, how to discover new music when you don’t necessarily know what type of music you’re looking for? The answer, he said, was the social component.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Then we figured out that it's the social aspect of music — the best music you always find when you go to your friend's house and he plays you records. And we’re taking this concept into an online environment here.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Value of User Data</h2>
<p>What both Last.fm and Audioscrobbler stumbled onto in 2002 was the collective value of user data in discovering new content — something that Amazon was also taking advantage of at this time. The problem with music, though, was that licensing from record companies was still highly restrictive. The Last.fm founders somewhat glossed over it during their Europrix presentation, but they did admit that “due to legal issues, we're only allowed to play 30 second samples.” Unless you already owned a piece of music, 30 seconds was all you got.</p>
<p>By the following year, however, Last.fm had begun turning itself into an "<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20031002073141/http://last.fm/labels.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">online radio</a>" service, by paying licensing fees to the UK collecting societies PRS (Performing Right Society) and MCPS (Mechanical-Copyright Protection Society).</p>
<p>So pre-Web 2.0, the streaming revolution was only just getting started. But with Last.fm and Audioscrobbler, we at least glimpsed the future of the social web.</p>

The <a href="https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#section-admired-and-desired-web-frameworks-and-technologies">premier</a> darling of web frameworks ostensibly rejecting the benefits of static typing was a big deal.<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup> So Rich Harris felt compelled to <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35892250">hop onto HN</a> and explain how this was "not a vindication of anti-Typescript positions".</p>
<p>Harris offered a considered take on why moving type declarations from .ts files to JSDoc comments in .js files was not an anti-TypeScript take. In fact, Harris asserted that Svelte's "commitment to TypeScript [was] stronger than ever."</p>
<p>This event heralded (and served as a citation for) a flood of "TypeScript VS JSDoc" blog posts and forum threads that offered the somewhat novel defense of JSDoc as "all the benefits of TypeScript without the build step" (albeit with a sometimes clunkier syntax).</p>
<p>But this is not the blog post lineage I hope to draw on with this post. Instead, I'd like to focus on a larger and more often misunderstood point. I take issue with the "vs" framing and offer a subtle but crucial substitution: JSDoc <em>is</em> TypeScript.</p>
<p>Some background:</p>
<h2 id="typescript-is-c">TypeScript is C#?</h2><p>(No, but it explains much of TS's early development)</p>
<p>Back in the late aughts/early 10s, JavaScript was still mostly seen as an unserious language. The tooling for JavaScript development lacked autocomplete, rename symbol, type safety, etc. Microsoft developers were so allergic to it that they would write C# code and use a tool called <a href="https://github.com/nikhilk/scriptsharp">ScriptSharp</a> to generate slightly-more-typesafe JavaScript code.</p>
<p>These are the origins of TypeScript.<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup> It is, fundamentally, a build tool to make writing JS less crappy. In fact:</p>
<h2 id="typescript-is-intellisense">TypeScript is IntelliSense!</h2><p>Even if you don't write your code in .ts files, you're probably using TypeScript. That's because TypeScript is the IntelliSense engine. Even if you're not using VSCode, if your editor gives you code completion, parameter info, quick info, member lists, etc. while writing JS code, you are almost certainly running the TypeScript language service.</p>
<h2 id="typescript-is-jsdoc">TypeScript is JSDoc :)</h2><p>It is also the TypeScript language service that is used to interpret JSDoc comments. That is why the TypeScript CHANGELOG often includes <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-5-5.html#the-jsdoc-import-tag">notes about JSDoc features</a>.<sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup> It also the reason your JSDoc-related IntelliSense can be governed by a <code>tsconfig.json</code> file and you can run <code>tsc</code> on a project typed with JSDoc comments.</p>
<p>You are already using TypeScript.</p>
<h2 id="my-own-experience">My Own Experience</h2><p>I recently rewrote the front-end for an old project of mine completely typed with JSDoc comments and I wanted to share some of my takeaways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Besides runtime features like enums, basically everything you can express in TypeScript you can express in JSDoc. Certain features like generics are much clunkier, forcing you to type the return in order to infer generic slots. But sometimes the clunkier syntax can actually encourage better TypeScript practices by pushing devs to rely more on type inference.</li>
<li>For packages typed with JSDoc, CTRL/CMD clicking on a function will take you to actual code rather than a type declarations file. I <em>much</em> prefer this experience as a dev.</li>
<li>TypeScript tooling is surprisingly reusable for JSDoc projects. This includes type generation libraries that take schemas (e.g. OpenApi or GraphQL) defined in your backend and generate corresponding types in your front-end. I found that most of these can be set up to generate types in JSDoc comments instead of TypeScript code.</li>
</ol>
<p>Take it from a massive TypeScript nerd: JSDoc is not an anti-TypeScript position to take. It is the same powerful static analysis without the build step.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><header><div><p>By <!-- -->John James</p><p>Published on <!-- -->December 14, 2025</p><p>Read time ~3 min</p></div></header><p>I’ve used GraphQL, specifically Apollo Client and Server, for a couple of years in a real enterprise-grade application.</p><p>Not a toy app. Not a greenfield startup. A proper production setup with multiple teams, BFFs, downstream services, observability requirements, and real users.</p><p>And after all that time, I’ve come to a pretty boring conclusion:</p><p>GraphQL solves a real problem, but that problem is far more niche than people admit. In most enterprise setups, it’s already solved elsewhere, and when you add up the tradeoffs, GraphQL often ends up being a net negative.</p><p>This isn’t a “GraphQL bad” post. It’s a “GraphQL after the honeymoon” post.</p><h3>what GraphQL is supposed to solve</h3><p>The main problem GraphQL tries to solve is overfetching.<br>The idea is simple and appealing:</p><ul><li>the client asks for exactly the fields it needs</li><li>no more, no less</li><li>no wasted bytes</li><li>no backend changes for every new UI requirement</li></ul><p>On paper, that’s great. In practice, things are messier.</p><h3>overfetching is already solved by BFFs</h3><p>Most enterprise frontend architectures already have a BFF (Backend for Frontend).</p><p>That BFF exists specifically to:</p><ul><li>shape data for the UI</li><li>aggregate multiple downstream calls</li><li>hide backend complexity</li><li>return exactly what the UI needs</li></ul><p>If you’re using REST behind a BFF, overfetching is already solvable. The BFF can scope down responses and return only what the UI cares about.</p><p>Yes, GraphQL can also do this. But here’s the part people gloss over.<br>Most downstream services are still REST.</p><p>So now your GraphQL layer still has to overfetch from downstream REST APIs, then reshape the response. You didn’t eliminate overfetching. You just moved it down a layer.<br>That alone significantly diminishes GraphQL’s main selling point.</p><p>There is a case where GraphQL wins here. If multiple pages hit the same endpoint but need slightly different fields, GraphQL lets you scope those differences per query.<br>But let’s be honest about the trade.</p><p>You’re usually talking about saving a handful of fields per request, in exchange for:</p><ul><li>more setup</li><li>more abstraction</li><li>more indirection</li><li>more code to maintain</li></ul><p>That’s a very expensive trade for a few extra kilobytes.</p><h3>implementation time is much higher than REST</h3><p>GraphQL takes significantly longer to implement than a REST BFF.</p><p>With REST, you typically:</p><ul><li>call downstream services</li><li>adapt the response</li><li>return what the UI needs</li></ul><p>With GraphQL, you now have to:</p><ul><li>define a schema</li><li>define types</li><li>define resolvers</li><li>define data sources</li><li>write adapter functions anyway</li><li>keep schema, resolvers, and clients in sync</li></ul><p>GraphQL optimizes consumption at the cost of production speed.<br>In an enterprise environment, production speed matters more than theoretical elegance.</p><h3>observability is worse by default</h3><p>This one doesn’t get talked about enough.<br>GraphQL has this weird status code convention:</p><ul><li>400 if the query can’t be parsed</li><li>200 with an <code>errors</code> array if something failed during execution</li><li>200 if it succeeded or partially succeeded</li><li>500 if the server is unreachable</li></ul><p>From an observability standpoint, this is painful.</p><p>With REST:</p><ul><li>2XX means success</li><li>4XX means client error</li><li>5XX means server error</li></ul><p>If you filter dashboards by 2XX, you know those requests succeeded.<br>With GraphQL, a 200 can still mean partial or full failure.</p><p>Yes, Apollo lets you customize this behavior. But that’s kind of the point. You’re constantly paying a tax in extra configuration, extra conventions, and extra mental overhead just to get back to something REST gives you out of the box.</p><p>This matters when you’re on call, not when you’re reading blog posts.</p><h3>caching sounds amazing until you live with it</h3><p>Apollo’s normalized caching is genuinely impressive.</p><p>In theory. In practice, it’s fragile.</p><p>If you have two queries where only one field differs, Apollo treats them as separate queries. You then have to manually wire things so:</p><ul><li>existing fields come from cache</li><li>only the differing field is fetched</li></ul><p>At that point:</p><ul><li>you still have a roundtrip</li><li>you’ve added more code</li><li>debugging cache issues becomes its own problem</li></ul><p>Meanwhile, REST happily overfetches a few extra fields, caches the whole response, and moves on. Extra kilobytes are cheap. Complexity isn’t.</p><h3>the ID requirement is a leaky abstraction</h3><p>Apollo expects every object to have an <code>id</code> or <code>_id</code> field by default, or you need to configure a custom identifier.</p><p>That assumption does not hold in many enterprise APIs.</p><p>Plenty of APIs:</p><ul><li>don’t return IDs</li><li>don’t have natural unique keys</li><li>aren’t modeled as globally identifiable entities</li></ul><p>So now the BFF has to generate IDs locally just to satisfy the GraphQL client.</p><p>That means:</p><ul><li>more logic</li><li>more fields</li><li>you’re always fetching one extra field anyway</li></ul><p>Which is ironic, considering the original goal was to reduce overfetching.</p><p>REST clients don’t impose this kind of constraint.</p><h3>file uploads and downloads are awkward</h3><p>GraphQL is simply not a good fit for binary data.</p><p>In practice, you end up:</p><ul><li>returning a download URL</li><li>then using REST to fetch the file anyway</li></ul><p>Embedding large payloads like PDFs directly in GraphQL responses leads to bloated responses and worse performance.</p><p>This alone breaks the “single API” story.</p><h3>onboarding is slower</h3><p>Most frontend and full-stack developers are far more experienced with REST than GraphQL.</p><p>Introducing GraphQL means:</p><ul><li>teaching schemas</li><li>teaching resolvers</li><li>teaching query composition</li><li>teaching caching rules</li><li>teaching error semantics</li></ul><p>That learning curve creates friction, especially when teams need to move fast.</p><p>REST is boring, but boring scales extremely well.</p><h3>error handling is harder than it needs to be</h3><p>GraphQL error responses are… weird.</p><p>You have:</p><ul><li>nullable vs non-nullable fields</li><li>partial data</li><li>errors arrays</li><li>extensions with custom status codes</li><li>the need to trace which resolver failed and why</li></ul><p>All of this adds indirection.</p><p>Compare that to a simple REST setup where:</p><ul><li>input validation fails, return a 400</li><li>backend fails, return a 500</li><li>zod error, done</li></ul><p>Simple errors are easier to reason about than elegant ones.</p><h3>the net result</h3><p>GraphQL absolutely has valid use cases.</p><p>But in most enterprise environments:</p><ul><li>you already have BFFs</li><li>downstream services are REST</li><li>overfetching is not your biggest problem</li><li>observability, reliability, and speed matter more</li></ul><p>When you add everything up, GraphQL often ends up solving a narrow problem while introducing a broader set of new ones.<br>That’s why, after using it in production for years, I’d say this:</p><p>GraphQL isn’t bad. It’s just niche. And you probably don’t need it.</p><p>Especially if your architecture already solved the problem it was designed for.</p></article></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p><a href="https://github.com/eudoxia0/hashcards">hashcards</a> is a local-first <a href="https://borretti.me/article/effective-spaced-repetition">spaced repetition</a> app, along the lines of
<a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a> or <a href="https://mochi.cards/">Mochi</a>. Like Anki, it uses <a href="https://borretti.me/article/implementing-fsrs-in-100-lines">FSRS</a>, the most advanced scheduling
algorithm yet, to schedule reviews.</p>

<p>The thing that makes hashcards unique: it doesn’t use a database. Rather, your
flashcard collection is just a directory of Markdown files, like so:</p>

<div><pre><code>Cards/
  Math.md
  Chemistry.md
  Astronomy.md
  ...
</code></pre></div>

<p>And each file, or “deck”, looks like this:</p>

<div><pre><code>Q: What is the role of synaptic vesicles?
A: They store neurotransmitters for release at the synaptic terminal.

Q: What is a neurite?
A: A projection from a neuron: either an axon or a dendrite.

C: Speech is [produced] in [Broca's] area.

C: Speech is [understood] in [Wernicke's] area.
</code></pre></div>

<p>You write flashcards more or less like you’d write ordinary notes, with
lightweight markup to denote basic (question/answer) flashcards and <a href="https://docs.ankiweb.net/editing.html#cloze-deletion">cloze
deletion</a> flashcards. Then, to study, you run:</p>

<div><pre><code>$ hashcards drill &lt;path to the cards directory&gt;
</code></pre></div>

<p>This opens a web interface on <code>localhost:8000</code>, where you can review the
flashcards. Your performance and review history is stored in an <a href="https://sqlite.org/">SQLite</a>
database in the same directory as the cards. Cards are content-addressed, that
is, identified by the hash of their text.</p>

<p>This central design decision yields many benefits: you can edit your flashcards
with your editor of choice, store your flashcard collection in a <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> repo,
track its changes, share it on <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> with others (<a href="https://github.com/eudoxia0/flashcards">as I have</a>). You can
use scripts to generate flashcards from some source of structured data (e.g. a
CSV of English/French vocabulary pairs). You can query and manipulate your
collection using standard Unix tools, or programmatically, without having to dig
into the internals of some app’s database.</p>

<p>Why build a new spaced repetition app? Mostly because I was dissatisfied with
both Anki and Mochi. But also, additionally, because my flashcards collection is
very important to me, and having it exist either in some remote database, or as
an opaque unusable data blob on my computer, doesn’t feel good. “Markdown files
in a Git repo” gives me a level of ownership that other approaches lack.</p>

<p>The rest of this post explains my frustrations with Anki and Mochi, and how I
landed on the design decisions for hashcards.</p>

<h2 id="anki">Anki</h2>

<p><a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a> was the first SR system I used. It’s open source, so it will be around
forever; it has a million plugins; it was the first SR system to use <a href="https://borretti.me/article/implementing-fsrs-in-100-lines">FSRS</a> for
scheduling. It has really rich stats, which I think are mostly useless but are
fun to look at. And the <a href="https://docs.ankiweb.net/getting-started.html#note-types">note types</a> feature is really good: it lets you
generate a large number of flashcards automatically from structured data.</p>

<p>The central problem with Anki is that the interface is really bad. This
manifests in various ways.</p>

<p>First, it is ugly to look at, particularly the review screen. And this
diminishes your enjoyment of what is already an often boring and frustrating
process.</p>

<p>Second, doing simple things is hard. A nice feature of Mochi is that when you
start the app you go right into review mode. You’re drilling flashcards before
you even realize it. Anki doesn’t have a “study all cards due today”, rather,
you have to manually go into a deck and click the “Study Now” button. So what I
would do is put all my decks under a “Root” deck, and study that. But this is a
hack.</p>

<p>And, third: card input uses WYSIWYG editing. So, you’re either jumping from the
keyboard to the mouse (which increases latency, and makes flashcard creation
more frustrating) or you have to remember all these keybindings to do basic
things like “make this text a cloze deletion” or “make this <a href="https://docs.ankiweb.net/math.html">TeX math</a>”.</p>

<p>Finally, plugins are a double-edged sword. Because having the <em>option</em> to use
them is nice, but the experience of <em>actually</em> using most plugins is bad. The
whole setup feels janky, like a house of cards. Most of the time, if a feature
is not built into the app itself, I would rather live without it than use a plugin.</p>

<h2 id="mochi">Mochi</h2>

<p><a href="https://mochi.cards/">Mochi</a> feels like it was built to address the main complaint about Anki: the
interface. It is intuitive, good looking, shortcut-rich. No jank. Instead of
WYSIWYG, card text is Markdown: this is delightful.</p>

<p>There’s a few problems. While Markdown is a very low-friction way to write
flashcards, cloze deletions in Mochi are very verbose. In hashcards, you can
write this:</p>

<div><pre><code>Speech is [produced] in [Broca's] area.
</code></pre></div>

<p>The equivalent in Mochi is this:</p>

<div><pre><code>Speech is {{1::produced}} in {{2::Broca's}} area.
</code></pre></div>

<p>This is a lot of typing. And you might object that it’s only a few characters
longer. But when you’re studying from a textbook, or when you’re copying words
from a vocabulary table, these small frictions add up. If writing flashcards is
frustrating, you’ll write fewer of them: and that means less knowledge
gained. Dually, a system that makes flashcard creation as frictionless as
possible means more flashcards, and more knowledge.</p>

<p>Another problem is that Mochi doesn’t have an equivalent of Anki’s <a href="https://docs.ankiweb.net/getting-started.html#note-types">note
types</a>. For example: you can make a note type for chemical elements, with
fields like atomic number, symbol, name, etc., and write templates to generate
flashcards asking questions like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What is the atomic number of [name]?</li>
  <li>What element has atomic number [number]?</li>
  <li>What is the symbol for [name]?</li>
  <li>What element has symbol [symbol]?</li>
</ul>

<p>And so on for other properties. This is good. Automation is good. Less work,
more flashcards. Mochi doesn’t have this feature. It has <a href="https://mochi.cards/docs/#templates">templates</a>, but
these are not as powerful.</p>

<p>But the biggest problem with Mochi, I think, is the algorithm. Until <a href="https://x.com/MochiCardsApp/status/1924692507570667630">very
recently</a>, when they added beta support for FSRS, the algorithm used by
Mochi was even simpler than <a href="https://borretti.me/article/implementing-sm2-in-rust">SM-2</a>. It was based on <a href="https://mochi.cards/docs/faq/#which-spaced-repetition-algorithm-does-mochi-use">multipliers</a>:
remembering a card multiplies its interval by a number &gt;1, forgetting a card
multiplies its interval by a number between 0 and 1.</p>

<p>The supposed rationale for this is simplicity: the user can reason about the
algorithm more easily. But I think this is pointless. The whole point of an SR
app is the software manages the schedule for you, and the user is completely
unaware of how the scheduler works. The optimality is to have the most advanced
possible scheduling algorithm (meaning the one that yields the most recall for
the least review time) under the most intuitive interface possible, and the user
just reaps the benefits.</p>

<p>Obviously without an RCT we can’t compare Mochi/<a href="https://borretti.me/article/implementing-sm2-in-rust">SM-2</a>/FSRS, but my subjective
experience of it is that the algorithm works well for the short-term, and
falters on the long-term. It’s very bad when you forget a mature card: if a card
has an interval of sixty days, and you click forget, you don’t reset the
interval to one day (which is good, because it helps you reconsolidate the lost
knowledge). Rather, the interval is multiplied by the forget multiplier (by
default: 0.5) down to <em>thirty days</em>. What’s the use? If I forgot something after
sixty days, I surely won’t have better recall in thirty.</p>

<p>You can fix this by setting the forget multiplier to zero. But you have to know
this is how it works, and, crucially: I don’t want to configure things! I don’t
want “scheduler parameter finetuning” to be yet another skill I have to acquire:
I want the scheduler to <em>just work</em>.</p>

<p>In general, I think spaced repetition algorithms are too optimistic. I’d rather
see cards slightly more often, and spend more time reviewing things, than get
stuck in “forgetting hell”. But developers have to worry that making the system
too burdensome will hurt retention.</p>

<p>In Anki, it’s the interface that’s frustrating, but the algorithm works
marvelously. In Mochi, the interface is delightful, but it’s the algorithm
that’s frustrating. Because you can spend months and months drilling flashcards,
building up your collection, but when the cards cross some invisible age
threshold, you start to forget them, and the algorithm does not help you relearn
things you have forgotten. Eventually I burned out on it and stopped doing my
reviews, because I expected to forget everything eventually anyhow. And now they
added support for FSRS, but by now I have 1700 cards overdue.</p>

<p>Additionally: Mochi has only two buttons, “Forgot” and “Remembered”. This is
simpler for the user, yes, but most SR scheduling algorithms have more options
for a reason: different degrees of recall adjust the card parameters by
different magnitudes.</p>

<h2 id="hashcards">Hashcards</h2>

<p>What do I want from a spaced repetition system?</p>

<p>The first thing is: card creation must be frictionless. I have learned that the
biggest bottleneck in spaced repetition, for me, is not doing the reviews (I am
very disciplined about this and have done SR reviews daily for months on end),
it’s not even converting conceptual knowledge into flashcards, the biggest
bottleneck is just entering cards into the system.</p>

<p>The surest way to shore up your knowledge of some concept or topic is to write
more flashcards about it: asking the same question in different ways, in
different directions, from different angles. More volume means you see the same
information more often, asking in different ways prevents “memorizing the shape
of the card”, and it acts as a kind of redundancy: there are multiple edges
connecting that bit of knowledge to the rest of your mind.</p>

<p>And there have been many times where I have thought: I would make this more
solid by writing another flashcard. But I opted not to because the marginal
flashcard is too effortful.</p>

<p>If getting cards into the system involves a lot of friction, you write fewer
cards. And there’s an opportunity cost: the card you don’t write is a concept
you don’t learn. Integrated across time, it’s entire oceans of knowledge which
are lost.</p>

<p>So: the system should make card entry effortless. This was the guiding principle
behind the design of the hashcards text format. For example, cloze deletions use
square brackets because in a US keyboard, square brackets can be typed without
pressing shift (compare Mochi’s curly brace). And it’s one bracket, not
two. Originally, the format was one line per card, with blank lines separating
flashcards, and question-answer cards used slashes to separate the sides, like
so:</p>

<div><pre><code>What is the atomic number of carbon? / 6

The atomic number of [carbon] is [6].
</code></pre></div>

<p>And this is strictly less friction. But it creates a problem for multi-line
flashcards, which are common enough that they should not be a second-class
citizen. Eventually, I settled on the current format:</p>

<div><pre><code>Q: What is the atomic number of carbon?
A: 6

C: The atomic number of [carbon] is [6].
</code></pre></div>

<p>Which is only slightly more typing, and has the benefit that you can easily
visually identify where a card begins and ends, and what kind of card it is. I
spent a lot of time arguing back and forth with <a href="https://claude.ai/">Claude</a> about what the optimal
format should be.</p>

<p>Another source of friction is not creating the cards but <em>editing</em> them. The
central problem is that your knowledge changes and improves over time. Often
textbooks take this approach where Chapter 1 introduces one kind of ontology,
and by Chapter 3 they tell you, “actually that was a lie, here’s the real
ontology of this subject”, and then you have to go back and edit the old
flashcards to match. Because otherwise you have one card asking, e.g., for the
undergraduate definition of some concept, while another asks you for the
graduate-level definition, creating ambiguity.</p>

<p>For this reason, when studying from a textbook, I create a deck for the
textbook, with sub-decks for each chapter. That makes it easy to match the
flashcards to their source material (to ensure they are aligned) and each
chapter deck only has a few tens of cards usually, keeping them navigable.</p>

<p>Sometimes you wrote multiple cards for the same concept, so you have to update
them all at once. Finding the related ones can be hard if the deck is large. In
hashcards, a deck is just a Markdown file. The cards immediately above and below
a card are usually semantically related. You just scroll up and down and make
the edits in place.</p>

<p>But why plain-text files in a Git repo? Why not use the above format, but in a
“normal” app with a database?</p>

<p>The vague idea of a spaced repetition system where flashcards are stored as
plain-text files in a Git repo had been kicking around my cranium for a long
time. I remember asking an Ankihead on IRC circa 2011 if such a thing
existed. At some point I read <a href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/My_implementation_of_a_personal_mnemonic_medium">Andy Matuschak’s note</a> on his
implementation of an SR system. In his system, the flashcards are colocated with
prose notes. The notation is similar to mine: <code>Q</code> and <code>A</code> tags for
question-answer cards, and <code>{curly braces}</code> for cloze deletions. And the cards
are content-addressed: identified by their hash. Which is an obviously good
idea. But his code is private and, besides, I feel that prose notes and
flashcards are very different beasts, and I don’t need or want them to mix.</p>

<p>But I think the idea of plain-text spaced repetition got bumped up the priority
queue because I spontaneously started using a workflow that was similar to my
current hashcards workflow.</p>

<p>When studying from a textbook or a website, I’d write flashcards in a Markdown
file. Usually, I used a shorthand like <code>[foo]</code> for cloze deletions. Then I’d use
a Python script to transform the shorthand into the <code>{{1::foo}}</code> notation used by Mochi. And I’d edit the flashcards in the file, as
my knowledge built up and my sense of what was relevant and important to
remember improved. And then, when I was done with the chapter or document or
whatever, only then, I would manually import the flashcards into Mochi.</p>

<p>And it struck me that the last step was kind of unnecessary. I was already
writing my flashcards as lightly-annotated Markdown in plain-text files. I had
<a href="https://borretti.me/article/implementing-fsrs-in-100-lines">already implemented FSRS</a> out of curiosity. I was looking for a
personal project to build during funemployment. So hashcards was by then a very
neatly-shaped hole that I just needed to paint inside.</p>

<p>It turns out that using plain-text storage has many synergies:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You can edit the cards using whatever editor you use, build up a library of
card-creating macros, and navigate the collection using the editor’s file
browser.</li>
  <li>You can query and update the collection using standard Unix tools, or a
programming language, e.g. using <code>wc</code> to get the total number of words in the
collection, or using <code>awk</code> to make a bulk-update to a set of cards.</li>
  <li>You can use Git for version control. Git is infinitely more featureful than
the change-tracking of any SR app: you can edit multiple cards in one commit,
branch, merge, use pull requests, etc.</li>
  <li>You can make your flashcards public on GitHub. I often wish people put more of
themselves out there: their blog posts, their dotfiles, their study notes. And
why not their flashcards? Even if they are not useful to someone else, there
is something enjoyable about reading what someone else finds interesting, or
enjoyable, or worth learning.</li>
  <li>You can generate flashcards using scripts (e.g., turn a CSV of foreign
language vocabulary into a deck of flashcards), and write a Makefile to tie
the script, data source, and target together. I <a href="https://github.com/eudoxia0/flashcards/blob/87b082e4723e5b1b286e3bb5378316f464cfc28f/Makefile">do this</a> in my
personal deck. Anki’s <a href="https://docs.ankiweb.net/getting-started.html#note-types">note types</a> don’t have to be built into hashcards,
rather, you can DIY it using some Python and make.</li>
</ul>

<p>The result is a system where creating and editing flashcards is nearly
frictionless, that uses an advanced spaced repetition scheduler, and which
provides an elegant UI for drilling flashcards. I hope others will find it
useful.</p>

There are, of course, a ton of problems to solve. Chief among them is the obvious caveat that C is not a monoculture like Rust. There will be zero upstream libraries that use this tool natively. But I don't think it matters.

I've updated a port of WxWidgets and now I support all the features KiCad needs with ~200 tests.</p><p>Right now I have a build that loads in the browser, but I really want to have "multithreading" which means workers in the web. One can use asyncify with emscripten to translate blocking C++ to WASM, but that transition is not perfect, right now I'm debugging a bug where there's a race condition that halts all execution and the main thread runs in an infinite loop waiting for the workers to stand up.

This will probably work with pcbnew, KiCad's layout editor, since it has a plugin system and AFAIK I can do the sync layer there. For the rest ( schematic, component editor etc. ) I'll have to figure out something..
KiCad does not sync automatically if you modify a file, I'll have to do some lifting there.</p><p>Anyway, it's a lot of fun, I really want this thing to exist, I'm hoping that I won't run into a "wellll, this is just not going to work" kind of issue in the end.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46267589"><td></td></tr><tr id="46267634"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="2"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="80"></td><td><center><a id="up_46267634" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46267634&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46264491"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div><p>I'm currently working on something that lets you describe a hardware product in plain English and get actual manufacturable files out — PCB, enclosure, firmware, the lot.</p><p>Very early days still. Whilst I created a fork of toon for Kicad (called TOKN), with the intention of using a reduced token format to generate schematics using LLM's, I could get the models to follow the syntax correctly, but they didn't have the knowledge. So I was then going to create a whole RAG system, but got distracted by this current project.</p><p>There are people out there doing AI schematic generation, like flux.ai (which is incredible (and incredibly well funded), but 90% of products, especially at proof of concept stage, are basically a microcontroller, some power, probably usb, and some IO, bluetooth/wifi if you're lucky. So we can use a library of pre-validated subcircuits and slots them together on a grid. Routing's deterministic, so if it compiles, it works. (sorry, deeppcb &amp; Quilter!)</p><p>The enclosure side is more fun: once the PCB's done you've got real dimensions to work with (board size, mounting holes, where the connectors poke out), so I use an image model to generate some concept art, then feed that to an openscad generating model as visual inspiration alongside the hard constraints.</p><p>Basically trying to get a full hardware product pipeline done automatically.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46268177"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_46268177" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46268177&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46264491"></a></center></td><td><br>

Since then I found <a href="https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono</a> and <a href="https://github.com/johnlindquist/mdflow" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/johnlindquist/mdflow</a> and I think I'll rather use these existing tools to explore my idea. But I think it might be still interesting project because it is entirely vibe-coded - I don't even know Typescript (I know some Javascript from before React - but none of the new stuff). I did not look into the Typescript code at all - only at what the LLM presented to me when editing it and the docs. At some point I discovered that when I tried to have a core logic and two UI packages the LLM put only types in the core package - so I had drive a hard refactoring - but it worked.</p><p>I haven't yet tried this very extensively - but another profound change in programming that this showed me is that it is now very easy to borrow parts of Open Source libraries. It used to be that you could only base your work on a library - borrowing parts of projects that were not designed to be shared (used as libraries) was prohibitive - but with llms it is entirely possible to say: "now please borrow the UI ideas from project X" and it does that. Maybe you need to add some planning.</p><p>The project is about 27kloc now.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46267548"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_46267548" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46267548&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46264491"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div><p>I'm working on a hardware/software utility to play Switch/Switch 2 games remotely with my brothers. I found a way to emulate a Switch Pro Controller using a Raspberry Pi Pico based on several different sources (look in the README for more info). I used that to write a firmware for the Pico (with the help of GPT Codex 5.1).</p><p>Then I wrote a Python program that connects whatever controller my brothers want to use (as long as it's supported by SDL2.0) and forwards that data from their computer, through Parsec, through a USB-UART adapter, to the Pico, then to the Switch. I then have a low latency capture card (Magewell Pro Dual HDMI I got off of ebay for $100) forwarding the video and audio from the Switch to my PC which I share to my brothers via Parsec. The audio was a bit tricky to get right, and ended up having to use a Virtual audio cable and Voicemeeter potato (a software audio mixer) so that both myself and my brothers could hear the audio.</p><p>It works surprisingly well and the latency is pretty low. I even got rumble working! (but not motion controls. If anyone wants to attempt it, I will accept PRs). I haven't done any formal benchmarking for performance, but my brothers and I were able to play Smash Ultimate without too much bother about latency.</p><p>You could also use the accessory Python library I made to automate switch controller presses (look in the examples directory). Might be useful for TAS speedruns?</p><p>The project is here for anyone interested. It's a bit rough and needs some cleanup and maybe a video tutorial on remote setup.

<div><p>I am working (mostly vibecoded) a Git history explorer in Go+modernc.org/Tk9.0: <a href="https://github.com/thiagokokada/gitk-go" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/thiagokokada/gitk-go</a>. It is heavily inspired in gitk, this is why the name and usage of Tk for the interface.</p><p>The reason for it was because after testing multiple Git history explorers, I still think nothing beats the gitk. Sublime Merge is probably the only alternative that I would seriously consider but I don't really like the UI and the fact that it is proprietary (I am not against proprietary software but I prefer an opensource solution when available). Other alternatives have some bugs or the interface few too slow. gitk itself is mostly fine, but sadly it tries to load the whole repository in memory and this is causing issues every time I try to navigate through nixpkgs (I can see the memory consumption going through the roof while the UI slow down to a crawl).</p><p>gitk-go loads a batch of commits (1000 by default) and once you get at the end of the list it loads more. I also add a few features that I miss from gitk, for example if you do any change in the repository (change branches, add files to stash, etc) it will automatically reflect in the UI.</p><p>Again, the code is mostly vibecoded since this is the first time I decided to try this from scratch. The code works well for my use cases and it is enough to replace gitk for me, but I can't guarantee there is no bugs and the amount of tests are small. But still, it was fun to see something that I wanted to create for a while (I had this idea for a long time since the issues with gitk that I was having) finally taking form. Probably the program is not useful for anyone but me, but if anything this is a feature, not a bug.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46267540"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_46267540" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46267540&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46264491"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div><p>I'm still tweaking my tool for creating accessible Tailwind-style color palettes for web/UI design that pass WCAG 2 contrast requirements:</p><p><a href="https://www.inclusivecolors.com/" rel="nofollow">https://www.inclusivecolors.com/</a></p><p>There's 100s of color palette generation tools, where most only let you customize a single color then try to autogenerate tints/shades without much thought about accessibility or tints/shades customization. The main features of this tool are:</p><p>- Emphasis on accessibility. A live UI mockup using your palette warns you if your tints/shades are lacking contrast when used in practice for headings, paragraphs, borders, and buttons, and teaches you the WCAG rules. Fixing contrast issues and exploring accessible color options is also made much easier using an HSLuv color picker, where only the lightness slider alters the contrast checks, and not the hue/saturation sliders (most tools use HSL, where hue/saturation changes counterintuitively alter contrast checks which makes accessibility really tough!).</p><p>- You can tweak the hue/saturation/lightness of every tint/shade. This is useful because autogenerated colors are never quite right, and customization is really important for branding work when you have to include specific tints/shades.  The curve-based hue/saturation/lightness editing UI also makes this a really quick process.</p><p>- Instead of just a handful of colors, this tool lets you create a full palette. For example, if your primary color is blue, you always end up needing other colors like green for success, red for danger, and gray for text, then 11 tints/shades for all of these, so you want a tool that lets you tweak, check, compare and manage them all at once.</p><p>It's mostly a demo on mobile so check it on desktop. I'm still working on making it easier to use as it probably requires some design background to understand, but really open to feedback!</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46266728"><td></td></tr><tr id="46265187"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_46265187" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46265187&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46264491"></a></center></td><td><br>

TradingView is great for charts, but it’s hard to answer simple “what-if” questions like would rotating into another coin actually have helped or did trimming and buying back improve outcomes, or just feel good in hindsight.
So I started building tools that simulate these scenarios directly on historical data. For example:
- flipping from coin A into coin B and back again over a chosen period
- selling part of a position and buying back later after a drawdown</p><p>I’m still early and adding ideas as I go, but it’s already helped me questions I had.</p><p>Examples:

It translates the mission object tree from the Torque .mis files into a Three.js scene graph. Eventually though, I noticed that some mission definitions were more dynamic – Torque .mis files are really just TorqueScript .cs files with a different extension and some pragma/magic comments. So, to actually handle every map would require not just a mission file parser, but a whole TorqueScript runtime. Implementing THAT part seemed really tedious and, frankly, uninteresting to me. So I had Claude Code get a whole TorqueScript transpiler and runtime working. Now, when you load a mission, it actually runs all the same scripts that Tribes 2 runs to load the mission, all the way from server.cs and its `CreateServer()` function.</p><p>Currently, I'm continuing to get its rendering matching Tribes 2 as closely as possible, and setting things up so that live editing of missions will work.</p><p>Source: <a href="https://github.com/exogen/t2-mapper" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/exogen/t2-mapper</a></p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46266534"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_46266534" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46266534&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46264491"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div><p>I’ve been working on "Next Arc Research" — <a href="https://nextarcresearch.com/" rel="nofollow">https://nextarcresearch.com</a> - a wrapper around my curiosity to understand how AI, compute, and capital might change markets by 2030.</p><p>It’s not a trading tool or product. More like a <i>weekly, machine-assisted research project</i>. Each cycle I run analyses on 120+ public companies across semiconductors, cloud, biotech, energy, robotics, quantum and crypto. The framing is inspired by Emad Mostaque’s <i>“The Last Economy”</i> thesis — the idea that when intelligence becomes cheap, the physics of value creation start to look very different. I originally built it for myself and retail investors in my family but I figure it could have more general utility so prettied it up a bit.</p><p>The system uses large-model reasoning (GPT-5+ though I've also tested Sonnet, Gemini and Grok) combined with structured scoring across technology maturity, risk, competitive positioning, and alignment to AI-era dynamics. The output is static HTML dashboards, PDFs, and CSVs that track month-over-month shifts. I'm adding to it weekly.</p><p>Mostly I’m trying to answer questions like:</p><p>* Which companies are structurally positioned for outsized upside in The Last Economy?</p><p>* How should I deliver the research so that it would have been actionable to someone like me 30 years ago?</p><p>* What signals would help folks identify “the next NVIDIA” 5 years earlier?</p><p>The inference costs real $$$ so I've set up a Patreon that, hopefully, will allow me to scale coverage and extend the modelling and methodology. There is a free tier and some recent, complete example output on the web site. I'm also happy to gift a free month for folks willing to provide constructive feedback: <a href="https://www.patreon.com/NextArcResearch/redeem/CC2A2" rel="nofollow">https://www.patreon.com/NextArcResearch/redeem/CC2A2</a> - in particular I'm looking for feedback on how to make the research more actionable without drifting into "financial advice".</p><p>I don't collect any data but Patreon does for authentication and Cloudflare does to deliver Pages.

<div><p>I'm building a yet another AI chat app.</p><p>My initial goal is to make a functional SillyTavern (AI roleplaying) replacement. SillyTavern builds prompts from a few rigid buckets (character, scenario, lore, system prompt, author's note...), which makes complex setups hard to manage. Content gets duplicated, settings have to be toggled in multiple places, and it’s easy to accidentally carry or modify state across conversations. Over time, it becomes difficult to tell what context is actually in effect.</p><p>I’m building an alternative that treats context as small, reusable pieces that can be composed and organized flexibly, rather than locked into fixed categories. Characters, settings, and behaviors can be mixed, reused, or temporarily enabled without duplication or manual cleanup, and edits preserve clear history instead of rewriting the past. The goal is to make managing complex context deliberate and controlled instead of fragile.</p><p>Although I’m trying to get the functionality required for roleplaying done first, the app is generic enough for other AI workflows where fine-grained, explicit context control is an improvement over existing chat interfaces. Think: start a new conversation with an assistant and start checking off rules, documents, and instructions to apply to the chat. Regenerate responses with clarifications or additional one-time context layers.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46267127"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_46267127" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46267127&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46264491"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div><p>I've been taking some time off from <a href="https://gethly.com/" rel="nofollow">https://gethly.com</a>, as majority of functionality I wanted to implement and offer to customers is done, so it's mostly just some tweaks here and there.</p><p>I was pondering doing something in regards to decentralised consummation of content. I am beginning to see how various websites are walling off their content and centralising everything whilst also monetising access to it for themselves and kicking content creators out, forcing them to run their own websites and use multiple backup platforms(mostly the dying youtube).</p><p>So I was thinking about flipping it on its head and instead of going to different websites to consume this content, like youtube, twitter and whatnot, people would have a single program to aggregate it instead. Then it occurred to me that this is what RSS/Atom was made for, kind of. So I am just letting the idea marinate for a bit and maybe next year I will look into it. Mastodon might have some good concepts in it that I want to look into and also come up with some standardised way for richer content that creators could provide beyond RSS to make it more palatable and easier consumable for users.</p><p>tl;dr not much this month :)</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46266252"><td></td></tr><tr id="46266373"><td></td></tr><tr id="46266328"><td></td></tr><tr id="46267090"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_46267090" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46267090&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46264491"></a></center></td><td><br>

Apple says that the updates address over 20 vulnerabilities, including two bugs that are known to have been actively exploited.</p>

Apple says that the bugs might have been exploited in an attack against targeted individuals on versions of iOS before <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a>.<br>
</p>
<blockquote><p>Processing maliciously crafted web content may lead to arbitrary code execution. Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been exploited in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals on versions of iOS before iOS 26.</p>
<p>Processing maliciously crafted web content may lead to memory corruption. Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been exploited in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals on versions of iOS before iOS 26.</p></blockquote>
<p>One of the WebKit bugs was fixed with improved memory management, while the other was addressed with improved validation.</p>
<p>There are several other vulnerabilities that were fixed too, across apps and services. An <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> bug could allow users to access sensitive payment tokens, processing a malicious image file could lead to memory corruption, photos in the Hidden Album could be viewed without authentication, and passwords could be unintentionally removed when remotely controlling a device with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a>.</p>
<p>Now that these vulnerabilities have been publicized by Apple, even those that were not exploited before might be taken advantage of now. Apple recommends all users update their devices to iOS 26.2, iPadOS 26.2, and macOS Tahoe 26.2 as soon as possible.</p>

                <p><span><strong>Pre-election prices</strong></span></p>
                <p>To investigate if political influence operations can be seen in these markets, the team analysed price and availability of SMS verifications for eight major social media platforms in the 30 days leading up to 61 national elections held around the world between summer 2024 and the following summer.<sup>****</sup></p>
                <p>They found that fake account prices shot up for direct messaging apps Telegram and WhatsApp during election run-ups the world over, likely driven by demand. An account on Telegram increased in price by an average of 12%, and by 15% on WhatsApp.</p>
                <p>Accounts on these apps are tied to visible phone numbers, making it easy to see the country of origin. As such, those behind influence operations must register fake accounts locally, say researchers, increasing demand for SMS verifications in targeted nations.</p>
                <p>However, on social media platforms like Facebook or Instagram, where no link between price and elections was found, fake accounts can be registered in one country and used in another. They also have greater reach which keeps demand high.</p>
                <p>“A fake Facebook account registered in Russia can post about the US elections and most users will be none the wiser. This isn’t true of apps like Telegram and WhatsApp,” said Roozenbeek.</p>
                <p>“Telegram is widely used for influence operations, particularly by state actors such as Russia, who invested heavily in information warfare on the channel.” WhatsApp and Telegram are among platforms with consistently expensive fake accounts, averaging $1.02 and $0.89 respectively.</p>
                <p><span><strong>‘Shadow economy’</strong></span></p>
                <p>The manipulation market’s big players have major customer bases in China and the Russian Federation, say the research team, who point out that Russian and Chinese payment systems are often used, and the grammar on many sites suggests Russian authorship. These vendors sell accounts registered in countries around the world.<sup>*****</sup></p>
                <p>“It is hard to see state-level political actors at work, as they often rely on closed-loop infrastructure. However, we suspect some of this is still outsourced to smaller players in the manipulation market,” said Dek.</p>
                <p>Small vendors resell and broker existing accounts, or manually create and “farm” accounts. The larger players will provide a one-stop shop and offer bulk order services for follower numbers or fake accounts, and even have customer support.</p>
                <p>A <a href="https://stratcomcoe.org/publications/social-media-manipulation-20222023-assessing-the-ability-of-social-media-companies-to-combat-platform-manipulation/272"><span><strong>2022 study</strong></span></a> co-authored by Dek showed that around ten Euros on average (just over ten US dollars) can buy some 90,000 fake views or 200 fake comments for a typical social media post.</p>
                <p>“The COTSI shines a light on the shadow economy of online manipulation by turning a hidden market into measurable data,” added co-author of the new <em>Science</em> paper Prof Sander van der Linden. </p>
                <p>“Understanding the cost of online manipulation is the first step to dismantling the business model behind misinformation.”</p>
