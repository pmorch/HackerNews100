The
<span>C3</span>
Programming Language
</h2> <p> <!-- Simple, fast, safe, compiled. For developing maintainable software. -->
The Ergonomic, Safe and Familiar Evolution of C

Full C ABI Compatibility
</h3> <p>
C3 fits right into your C/C++ application with full C ABI
            compatibility out of the box: no need for special "C compatible"
            types or functions, no limitations on what C3 features you can use
            from C.
</p> </div> <div> <h3>
Module System
</h3> <p>
A simple and straightforward module system that doesn't get in the
            way, with defaults that makes sense.
</p> </div> <div> <h3>
Operator Overloading
</h3> <p>
C3 empowers you with precise, purpose-built operator overloading — no C++ baggage, just clean, expressive code.
            Ideal for vectors, matrices, and fixed-point math that reads exactly how it should.
</p> </div> </div> <div> <h2>
C3 is an evolution, not a revolution:
<span>the C-like for programmers who like C.</span> </h2> <div><p>
C3 is a programming language that builds on the syntax and semantics of
        the C language, with the goal of evolving it while still retaining
        familiarity for C programmers.</p><p>
Thanks to full ABI compatibility with C, it's possible to mix C and C3 in
        the same project with no effort. As a demonstration, vkQuake was compiled
        with a small portion of the code converted to C3 and compiled with the c3c
        compiler.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://refactoringenglish.com/blog/2025-hn-top-5/">https://refactoringenglish.com/blog/2025-hn-top-5/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46478377">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><article><header></header><p>With 2025 wrapped up, I can finally answer a question I’m curious about every year: who were <a href="https://refactoringenglish.com/tools/hn-popularity/?start=2025-01-01&amp;end=2025-12-31">the most popular bloggers of Hacker News</a>?</p><div><p><strong>Who counts as a blogger?</strong></p><p>I explain more in <a href="https://refactoringenglish.com/tools/hn-popularity/methodology/">my methodology page</a>, but it’s basically anyone who blogs as an individual rather than as part of a company or a team. As an example, <a href="https://jgc.org/">John Graham-Cumming</a> is the CTO of Cloudflare, so I count his <a href="https://refactoringenglish.com/tools/hn-popularity/domain/?d=jgc.org">personal blog</a> but not his posts to the Cloudflare company blog.</p></div><h2 id="1-simon-willison">#1 <a href="https://refactoringenglish.com/tools/hn-popularity/domain/?d=simonwillison.net&amp;start=2025-01-01&amp;end=2025-12-26">Simon Willison</a><a href="#1-simon-willison">🔗</a></h2><p>For the third straight year, Simon Willison was the most popular blogger on Hacker News.</p><p>At first, Simon’s position at #1 feels obvious: he wrote about AI in a year when everyone’s obsessed with AI. But there are tons of AI bloggers, and Simon is the only one who’s popular on HN, so what sets Simon apart?</p><p>First, Simon isn’t selling you anything. Simon writes about LLMs as a power user not as a sales pitch from some startup’s VP of product. He tries every AI tool he can get his hands on with no allegiance to any particular vendor. That allows him to write about how new AI tools fit into the ecosystem at large. It’s like getting restaurant recommendations from someone who eats out 20 times a week as opposed to someone who owns 20 restaurant chains.</p><p>Simon is also one of the most prolific bloggers on Hacker News. In 2025 alone, he wrote over 1,000 blog posts, though only 118 were full-length articles (“only”).</p><p>Simon often finds ideas within walled-garden platforms (e.g., TikTok, Twitter) and simply brings them to the open web, where it’s easier for HN to discuss. Some of his most popular posts were just short quotes or links with a bit of commentary. <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45820872">“I’m worried that they put co-pilot in Excel”</a> is just a quote from a video he watched on TikTok. <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42923870">“A computer can never be held accountable”</a> is Simon summarizing a few tweets.</p><p>Simon has said these types of posts are easy to write yet high in value.</p><blockquote><p>Sharing interesting links with commentary is a low effort, high value way to contribute to internet life at large.</p><p>—Simon Willison, “<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/22/link-blog/">My approach to running a link blog</a>”</p></blockquote><h2 id="2-jeff-geerling">#2 <a href="https://refactoringenglish.com/tools/hn-popularity/domain/?d=jeffgeerling.com&amp;start=2025-01-01&amp;end=2025-12-26">Jeff Geerling</a><a href="#2-jeff-geerling">🔗</a></h2><p>This is Jeff’s most successful year on Hacker News, beating his <a href="https://refactoringenglish.com/tools/hn-popularity/?start=2023-01-01&amp;end=2023-12-31&amp;domain=jeffgeerling.com">#5 finish in 2023</a>.</p><p>The #2 spot was an extremely tight race this year. Jeff’s posts totaled 10,813 upvotes, edging out the #3 blogger by just 9 points (a 0.08% difference). The #4 finisher was just 100 points behind that. Past stories can still accrue upvotes, so this could still flip, but these were the rankings as of midnight on Dec. 31st.</p><p>Jeff is a popular YouTube creator with over 1M subscribers. He covers some of HN’s favorite topics, like Raspberry Pi computers, self-hosted software, and computer hardware. YouTube videos rarely succeed on Hacker News, so when Jeff publishes a new video, he often publishes an accompanying blog post. Jeff isn’t the only YouTuber who does this, but he’s one of the few who does it <em>well</em>.</p><p>I’ve seen other YouTube creators try to repurpose their videos by auto-generating a transcript and calling that a blog post. Jeff approaches his blog more thoughtfully.</p><p>Jeff started out as a blogger, and he still treats his blog readers as first-class citizens. He structures his articles to fit the text medium rather than just lazily scraping dialog from his videos. You can read his post about <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/upgrading-m4-pro-mac-minis-storage-half-price">upgrading storage on his Mac mini</a> and not even realize it’s adapted from a video.</p><h2 id="3-sean-goedecke">#3 <a href="https://refactoringenglish.com/tools/hn-popularity/domain/?d=seangoedecke.com&amp;start=2025-01-01&amp;end=2025-12-26">Sean Goedecke</a><a href="#3-sean-goedecke">🔗</a></h2><p>Sean came out of nowhere as a blogging powerhouse this year. He’d been blogging sporadically since 2020, but he hit a turning point at the end of 2024 with <a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/how-to-ship/">“How I ship projects at big tech companies.”</a> It was one of HN’s top 100 posts of the year and remains <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42111031">Sean’s most popular post on HN</a>.</p><p>After his first success on HN, Sean went from publishing every few months to multiple times per week, becoming a regular fixture on the front page.</p><p>Sean is a Staff Software Engineer at GitHub and previously worked at Zendesk. Like Simon, Sean is extremely prolific. He wrote 140 posts this year. Of those, 47 reached the front page. I’ve had a few years where a lot of my posts reached the front page, but for me that was <a href="https://refactoringenglish.com/tools/hn-popularity/domain/?d=mtlynch.io&amp;start=2020-01-01&amp;end=2020-12-31">about 10 articles</a>. I can’t imagine what it’s like to have a new article on HN almost every week.</p><p>Sean explains his strategy in <a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/on-writing/">“Writing a tech blog people want to read”</a>:</p><blockquote><p>the recipe for a popular post is to have a clear opinion about working in tech that many people disagree with.</p></blockquote><p>I think Sean’s insight is true, but he’s selling his own writing a bit short. To me, Sean’s greatest strength is his ability to explain big tech organizational politics to engineers.</p><p>Most junior to mid-level developers don’t care about company politics. They think of office politics as something that strong technical thinkers shouldn’t have to waste brain cells on. As a result, they can’t understand why <a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/staff-engineer-promotions/">they can’t get promoted</a> or how <a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/bad-code-at-big-companies/">their company’s codebase got so bad</a>. Sean’s posts explain these phenomena in a way that’s clear and intelligible to engineers.</p><p>Sean’s posts are also a good example of how much luck comes into play on Hacker News, especially for less established authors. Sean’s top three posts of the year all flopped on their first submission and didn’t succeed until their second or third try, sometimes months later. Even then, only a third of his posts reached the front page at all.</p><h2 id="4-brian-krebs">#4 <a href="https://refactoringenglish.com/tools/hn-popularity/domain/?d=krebsonsecurity.com&amp;start=2025-01-01&amp;end=2025-12-26">Brian Krebs</a><a href="#4-brian-krebs">🔗</a></h2><p>Brian Krebs is an independent investigative journalist who covers cybercrime. He’s one of HN’s <a href="https://refactoringenglish.com/tools/hn-popularity/">most popular bloggers of all time</a>, second only to <a href="https://refactoringenglish.com/tools/hn-popularity/domain/?d=paulgraham.com">Paul Graham</a>, the creator of HN. For 11 of the last 12 years, Brian has been one of HN’s top 10 bloggers.</p><p>In 2025, Brian mostly stuck to his usual beat of deeply investigated cybersecurity stories, but his <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43529707">second most popular story</a> of the year was a sobering post about the Trump administration’s steps to undermine free speech in the US. It immediately shot to the #1 slot and stayed there for several hours. Unfortunately, too many users flagged the post, and it was moderated off the front page, which is often the fate of political stories on HN.</p><h2 id="5-neal-agarwal">#5 <a href="https://refactoringenglish.com/tools/hn-popularity/domain/?d=neal.fun&amp;start=2025-01-01&amp;end=2025-12-26">Neal Agarwal</a><a href="#5-neal-agarwal">🔗</a></h2><p>Neal’s work isn’t what you might think of as blog posts; they’re more like interactive art. Some of his posts are games that parody the web, while others are straight-faced visual essays about topics he finds interesting.</p><p>This was Neal’s most successful year on HN. Everything he published reached the front page, with about half hitting #1, and the rest peaking at #2. <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42611536">Stimulation Clicker</a> was the 4th most popular post of the entire year.</p><h2 id="other-notes">Other notes<a href="#other-notes">🔗</a></h2><ul><li><a href="https://refactoringenglish.com/tools/hn-popularity/domain/?d=daringfireball.net&amp;start=2025-01-01&amp;end=2025-12-31">John Gruber</a> finished the year in #6 despite wondering aloud back in March <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43489058">whether Hacker News</a> had shadowbanned his blog.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p>Venezuela’s authoritarian government has accused the US of launching a series of attacks against civilian and military targets in the South American country, after explosions rocked its capital, Caracas, before dawn on Saturday.</p><p>In a statement, Venezuela’s government urged citizens to rise up against the assault and said Washington risked plunging Latin America into chaos with “an extremely serious” act of “military aggression”.</p><p>“The entire country must mobilise to defeat this imperialist aggression,” it added.</p><p>US media reported that Donald Trump had ordered the strikes against the South American country.</p><p>Explosions and low-flying aircraft were heard in Caracas in the early hours of Saturday. In its statement, Venezuela’s government confirmed that the city had come under attack, as well as three other states: Miranda, La Guaira and Aragua.</p><p>“The only objective of this attack is to seize control of Venezuela’s strategic resources, in particular its oil and minerals,” it said, calling on the international community to denounce what it called a flagrant violation of international law that put millions of lives at risk.</p><p>The president of neighbouring Colombia, Gustavo Petro, claimed on social media that Venezuela was coming under attack. “Right now they are bombing Caracas … bombing it with missiles,” Petro wrote on X, calling for an immediate emergency session of the UN security council.</p><p>Soon after CBS News reported that Trump had had ordered the attacks – including on military facilities. The White House and Pentagon did not respond to request for comment.</p><p>At least seven explosions were heard about 2am local time and people in various neighbourhoods rushed to the street, the Associated Press reported. “The whole ground shook. This is horrible.

    <p>TL;DR: 2026 is going to be The Year of The Linux Desktop for me. I haven't booted into Windows in over 3 months on my tower and I'm starting to realize that it's not worth wasting the space for. I plan to unify my three SSDs and turn them all into btrfs drives on Fedora.</p>
<p>I've been merely tolerating Windows 11 for a while but recently it's gotten to the point where it's just absolutely intolerable. Somehow Linux on the desktop has gotten so much better by not even doing anything differently. Microsoft has managed to actively sabotage the desktop experience through years of active disregard and spite against their users. They've managed to take some of their most revolutionary technological innovations (the NT kernel's hybrid design allowing it to restart drivers, NTFS, ReFS, WSL, Hyper-V, etc.) then just shat all over them with start menus made with React Native, control-alt-delete menus that are actually just webviews, and forcing Copilot down everyone's throats to the point that I've accidentally gotten stuck in Copilot in a handheld gaming PC and had to hard reboot the device to get out of it. It's as if the internal teams at Microsoft have had decades of lead time in shooting each other in the head with predictable results.</p>
<p>To be honest, I've had enough. I'm going to go with Fedora on my tower and <a href="https://bazzite.gg/">Bazzite</a> (or SteamOS) on my handhelds.</p>
<p>I think that Linux on the desktop is ready for the masses now, not because it's advanced in a huge leap/bound. It's ready for the masses to use because Windows has gotten so much actively worse that continuing to use it is an active detriment to user experience and stability. Not to mention with the price of ram lately, you need every gigabyte you can get and desktop Linux lets you waste less of it on superfluous bullshit that very few people actually want.</p>
<div><p><img alt="Cadey is coffee" loading="lazy" src="https://stickers.xeiaso.net/sticker/cadey/coffee"></p></div>
<p>At the very least, when something goes wrong on Linux you have log messages that can let you know what went wrong so you can search for it.</p>

          <p>Tesla published its final production and delivery numbers this morning, and they make for brutal reading. Sales were down almost 16 percent during the final three months of last year, meaning the company sold 77,343 fewer electric vehicles than it did during <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/01/tesla-sales-fell-for-the-first-time-in-over-a-decade/">the same period in 2024</a>.</p>
<p>For the entire year, the decline looks slightly better with a drop of 8.6 percent year over year. That means Tesla sold 1,636,129 cars in 2025, 153,097 fewer than it managed in 2024. Which in turn is more than it managed to shift in 2023.</p>
<h2>Sales issues</h2>
<p>Contributing factors to the poor sales are legion. The brand still relies on the Models 3 and Y to an overwhelming extent, and other than a mild cosmetic refresh, neither feels fresh or modern compared with competitors from Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>And Elon Musk’s much-hyped Cybertruck—which was supposed to cost less than $40,000 and go into production in 2021, lest anyone forget—has been a disaster, eclipsing the Edsel. Its failure has taken down another company initiative, Tesla’s “in-house battery cell.” It was initially designed specifically for the Cybertruck, although the CEO later claimed it would be used for static storage as well as EVs. But apparently, it has become the victim of a lack of demand. <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/12/29/tesla-4680-battery-supply-chain-collapses-partner-writes-down-dea/">Last week</a>, Electrek reported that Tesla’s South Korean battery material supplier L&amp;F wrote down its $2.9 billion contract with Tesla to just $7,386. A drop of more than 99 percent.</p>
<p>Musk has not dialed back his embrace of the far right, cratering sales in markets like California and Europe, where EV buyers often use their consciences to guide their wallets.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div role="main">
      <article role="main">
        <p>Lots of the CVE world seems to focus on “security bugs” but I’ve found that it
is not all that well known exactly how the Linux kernel security process works.
I gave a
<a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/webinars/demystifying-the-linux-kernel-security-process">talk about this back in 2023</a>
and at other conferences since then, attempting to explain how it works, but I
also thought it would be good to explain this all in writing as it is required
to know this when trying to understand how the Linux kernel CNA issues CVEs.</p>
<p>This is a post in the series about the Linux kernel CVE release process:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.kroah.com/log/blog/2025/12/09/linux-kernel-version-numbers/">Linux kernel versions</a>,
how the Linux kernel releases are numbered.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.kroah.com/log/blog/2025/12/15/tracking-kernel-commits-across-branches/">Tracking kernel commits across branches</a>,
how to keep track of Linux kernel commits as they move from the main release
branch into the different stable releases in an automated way.</li>
<li>Linux kernel security work (this post),
how the Linux kernel security team works to fix reported security bugs.</li>
</ul>
<!---
 - Linux CVE review process
 - Linux CVE assignment tools
 - Other Linux CVE helper tools
 - Linux and the CRA
 - Staying secure and up to date

<h2 id="tldr">tl;dr</h2>
<p>Summary up front for those not wanting to read a wall of text:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Linux kernel <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/security-bugs.html">security team</a>
work to fix reported issues as quickly as possible and get the fixes merged
to public trees, and do not do any announcements anywhere.</li>
<li>The Linux kernel security team and the
<a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/cve.html">CVE team</a>
are different groups of people, all of whom do this work on their own
recognition, not associated with any company.</li>
<li>Only send plain text emails to the kernel security team.</li>
<li>Do not email the kernel security team and expect to get a CVE assigned.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="reactive-not-proactive-security-work">Reactive, not proactive, security work</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/security-bugs.html">Linux kernel security team</a>
is group of Linux kernel developers who are responsible for triaging potential
security bugs that are reported to them, and get them fixed as soon as
possible.  They do this work as “reactive” for security issues, independent of
the great “proactive” kernel security work that the <a href="https://kspp.github.io/">Kernel Self-protection
project</a> has been
<a href="https://docs.kernel.org/security/self-protection.html">doing for the past 10+ years.</a></p>

<p>As can be seen in the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/security-bugs.html">in-kernel documentation</a>
to contact the security team, just email the address in that document the
potential issue that you have found, without using HTML or any binary
attachments, and the developers there will take the report and usually ask
questions and work to resolve the issue if it turns out to actually be a real
security issue.  Many issues reported are not, and so the reporter is told to
send their bug report to the respective mailing list and work on it with the
developers there, in public.</p>
<p>When reporting a bug, just send a simple, plain text email to the security
alias.  Do not send an email that contains a binary attachment as opening
unsolicited binary files is not anything anyone should be doing.  Also do not
use markdown formatting, just plain text.  Also, no encryption is needed, as it
will not work due to the email alias handling (i.e. one address to many
individuals.)  If you are forced to use encryption to report security problems,
please reconsider this policy as it feels counterproductive (UK government,
this means you…)</p>
<p>The members of the security team contain a handful of core kernel developers
that have experience dealing with security bugs, and represent different major
subsystems of the kernel.  They do this work as individuals, and specifically
can NOT tell their employer, or anyone else, anything that is discussed on the
security alias before it is resolved.  This arrangement has allowed the kernel
security team to remain independent and continue to operate across the
different governments that the members operate in, and it looks to become the
normal way project security teams work with the advent of the European Union’s
new CRA law coming into affect which places requirements on response time of
companies that receive notice of potential security issues in their projects.</p>
<h2 id="how-the-fix-happens">How the fix happens</h2>
<p>The way the security team works is when a bug is reported, if the members do
not have experience in that specific subsystem, they drag the maintainers of
that subsystem into the email chain, and work to get the bug resolved.  If a
subsystem has a continued number of bugs reported over time, the maintainer can
be “asked” if they wish to join the alias to help remove the additional “hop”
of bug triage happening.  This is what has caused the alias members to
naturally grow over time to end up representing the major portions of the
kernel with the most issues.</p>
<p>Ideally the bug reporter also provides a working fix for the issue, allowing
them to get the proper credit for the fix but of course that does not always
happen.  If no fix is provided, the developers involve work to resolve the bug
as soon as they can, and when they agree it is resolved, get it merged into the
main kernel branch and the stable kernel releases as soon as possible.</p>
<h2 id="no-embargoes">No embargoes</h2>
<p>As the documentation states, no embargoes longer than 7 days are allowed, once
a working fix is made, as there’s no real reason to hold off on getting a fix
merged at that time.  Only very few changes ever have any embargo at all, as
it’s more bother than it is worth.</p>
<p>Once the bug is fixed in the kernel trees, the developer’s work is finished,
and it is up to the reporter if they wish to “announce” a bugfix or not.  The
kernel security team on their own do not do any reporting or external
communication at all.  Only later, if the fix is warranted to justify a CVE
being assigned, is the commit announced as a security fix, but that work is
done by the kernel CVE team, NOT the kernel security team.</p>

<p>This “do not announce anything” policy has been present in the kernel security
team since the very beginning, and as you can imagine, has caused much
“disagreement” by those outside of the kernel community.  This came up soon
after the kernel security team was established in a

  Umm. What part of "they are just normal bugs" did you have issues with?
  I expressly told you that security bugs should not be marked as such,

  &gt; in other words, it's all the more reason to have the commit say it's

  No.

  &gt; &gt; I'm just saying that why mark things, when the marking have no meaning?
  &gt; &gt; People who believe in them are just _wrong_.
  &gt;
  &gt; what is wrong in particular?

  You have two cases:

  - people think the marking is somehow trustworthy.

    People are WRONG, and are misled by the partial markings, thinking that
    unmarked bugfixes are "less important". They aren't.

  - People don't think it matters

    People are right, and the marking is pointless.
    In either case it's just stupid to mark them. I don't want to do it,
    because I don't want to perpetuate the myth of "security fixes" as a
    separate thing from "plain regular bug fixes".

    They're all fixes. They're all important. As are new features, for that
    matter.

  &gt; when you know that you're about to commit a patch that fixes a security
  &gt; bug, why is it wrong to say so in the commit?

  It's pointless and wrong because it makes people think that other bugs
  aren't potential security fixes.

  What was unclear about that?

reading.</p>
<h2 id="no-one-knows-how-you-use-open-source">No one knows how you use open source</h2>
<p>The primary reason why the kernel does not do any security announcements is
that almost any bugfix at the level of an operating system kernel can be a
“security issue” given the issues involved (memory leaks, denial of service,
information leaks, etc.)  Also, given that Linux is open source, the developers
involved in fixing problems do NOT know how Linux is being used.  A simple
bugfix for a minor thing for one user could be a major system vulnerability fix
for a different user, all depending on how Linux is being used.
<a href="https://blog.isosceles.com/author/ben/">Ben Hawkes</a>
said it best in a wonderful essay about
<a href="https://blog.isosceles.com/what-is-a-good-linux-kernel-bug/">“What is a good Linux kernel bug”</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It’s hard to capture the fact that a bug can be
super serious in one type of deployment, somewhat
important in another, or no big deal at all – and that
the bug can be all of this at the same time.
Vulnerability remediation is hard.”
– Ben Hawkes</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Always remember, kernel developers:</p>
<ul>
<li>do not know your use case.</li>
<li>do not know what code you use.</li>
<li>do not want to know any of this.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, overall, the kernel security bug policy can be boiled down to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fix known bugs as soon as possible.</li>
<li>Get releases out to users as quickly as possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>For those that are always worried “what if a bugfix causes problems”, they
should remember that a fix for a known bug is better than the potential of a
fix causing a future problem as future problems, when found, will be fixed
then.  You never want to have “known bugfixes” not resolved on your system at
any time.  So much so that recent laws will soon be preventing you that being
allowed for many countries.</p>
<h2 id="hardware-security-issues">Hardware security issues</h2>
<p>As history has shown us with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectre_(security_vulnerability)">Spectre</a>
and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meltdown_(security_vulnerability)">Meltdown</a>,
this “no embargo” policy does not always work well when working with problems
that cross operating systems and hardware platforms, possibly requiring
firmware or microcode updates.  Because of this, the kernel developers have
been forced to come up with a
<a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/embargoed-hardware-issues.html">“Hardware Security policy”</a>
to handle these types of issues.</p>
<p>This different workflow involves the creation of a special encrypted and
restricted email list containing just the needed kernel and hardware developers
that are required to get the problem solved.  With this process, embargoes are
grumpily tolerated for now.  Many different hardware bugs have been resolved in
Linux over the years through this process, but as a participant in some of
these efforts, it is clunky, awkward, and often times extremely slow.  The
kernel developers involved really do not like this process, and hopefully this
will be phased out over time as many hardware issues have been resolved in the
past year without having to get this special process involved at all.</p>
<p>Also, due to the CRA timelines, long embargo times will probably not even be
possible for hardware companies to handle.  How that is going to interact with
microcode and firmware updates in the next few years is going to be an
“interesting” thing to watch evolve.</p>
<h2 id="how-this-all-started">How this all started</h2>
<p>Way back in 2005, there was not any “official” way to contact anyone about
kernel security bugs.  It was just an ad-hock group of people that developers
“knew” they could email problems to.  That obviously did not really scale, and
was not helpful for anyone who did not know how the kernel developers worked.
This came to a head in 2005 with
<a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/41E2B181.3060009@rueb.com/">this email from Steve Bergman</a>:</p>

Subject: Proper procedure for reporting possible security vulnerabilities?

There seems to be some confusion in certain quarters as to the proper
procedure for reporting possible kernel security issues.

REPORTING-BUGS says send bug reports to the maintainer of that area of
the kernel. However, what about areas for which a maintainer is not
listed? (e.g. VM) It seems that some take that to mean send it
directly to Linus and if you don't hear something back quickly, release
an exploit to the wild.

So what is the preferred procedure and is it documented somewhere?
Should it be made more prominent?

Thanks for any information,
Steve Bergman

<p>As stated earlier, the kernel security team does not do any sort of
announcements at all, or any public statements anywhere.  They are also not
responsible for assigning CVE ids to any kernel bugfixes, that is a different
team’s responsibility that happens after kernel bugfixes are in public kernel
releases, and almost never before.</p>
<p>Because they do not do any announcements, there is also no “early announcement”
list, despite many companies constantly asking to “join the security
pre-announcement security list” requests we get.</p>
<p>The primary reason there is no pre-announcement list is overall they should
always be considered public and contain leaks.  Otherwise, why would your
government allow them to exist?  Unless the list is for a project that is not
really used by anyone…</p>

        <img src="https://www.madebywindmill.com/tempi/blog/hbfs-bpm/assets/robots.jpg" alt="Robots illustration">

        <p><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=harder+better+faster+stronger+bpm">Google "harder better faster stronger bpm"</a> and Google’s “AI Overview” will tell you:</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>Daft Punk’s “Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger” generally sits around 123 BPM (Beats Per Minute), though some analyses find it slightly higher (like 123.48 BPM) or list different BPMs in remixes/workouts, with exact figures varying slightly by source and version.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Spotify’s metadata database, <a href="https://songbpm.com/@daft-punk/harder-better-faster-stronger">SongBPM</a>, and most other online BPM databases list it at exactly 123.</p>

        <p>But I think our helmet-clad robot friends might have been making a little joke that we’ve apparently all missed. The BPM of Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger is actually 123.45.</p>

        <p>How do I know this? It so happens that for over 10 years I’ve written an app called <a href="https://www.madebywindmill.com/tempi/">Tempi</a> that shows the music BPM in real time, so I know a little bit about the science and algorithms behind music tempo detection.</p>

        <p>Most tempo detection software works basically the same way:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>A specialized algorithm called the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) collects overlapping energy levels at different frequency bands.</li>
            <li>Those levels are refined into well-defined peaks that represent rhythmic events in the track.</li>
            <li>Another algorithm (autocorrelation) looks for patterns, or more accurately <em>periodicity</em>, in those peaks.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>But these patterns are tricky because there’s all kinds of noise, performance inaccuracies, and rhythmic harmonics throwing things off. All that is to say, a) it’s complicated and b) it’s not perfectly accurate.</p>

        <p>When I make changes to my own system of course I need some way to know if it’s getting better or worse, so I have a test library of hundreds of song snippets that I score it against. One of these songs is Daft Punk’s HBFS, and early on I noticed something strange about that track.</p>
        
        <p>Almost all electronic music is synced to a sequencer and so obviously is going to have a very steady tempo. But while the vast majority of electronic music tracks I test have an “integral” tempo – meaning their tempo is exactly some round number like 95, and not a fraction like 95.2 – my software always finds the BPM of HBFS to be somewhere between 123 and 124, but not exactly either. For years I’ve chalked this up to inconsistencies with my system and didn’t think much of it. But lately I’ve made improvements to the system so that it’s much more accurate and it now tells me the BPM of HBFS is 123.4.</p>

        <p>And that got me thinking, “Hmm. Did these guys pick that tempo because they have a sense of humor? And if so, how far would they take it?”</p>

        <p>To get to the bottom of this I needed to establish what the BPM of HBFS really is.</p>
        
        <h3>And that’s actually pretty easy to do…</h3>

        <p>Here’s a Venn diagram showing the overlap between human and computer capabilities in the digital realm:</p>

        <img src="https://www.madebywindmill.com/tempi/blog/hbfs-bpm/assets/venn.png" alt="Venn diagram showing overlap between human and computer capabilities">

        <p>Computers can do almost all “computer-y” things (i.e. things that can be entirely done on a computer) MUCH better, faster, (and stronger?) than humans. But for the time being there remain a few things that humans can do very easily which computers find difficult. Along with counting traffic lights and crosswalks, one of those things is finding the exact BPM of a song. Not an estimate like most software does, but the <em>exact</em> value with extreme precision across the entire song. Anyone with a basic sense of rhythm and an audio app can do this.</p>

        <p>Here’s how:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Open the song in an audio app like Logic, Audition, Ableton, Reaper, ProTools, etc.</li>
            <li>Zoom in on the waveform a little bit so you can see the shape of the beats.</li>
            <li>Find the first obvious beat – meaning it has a well-defined waveform peak – and the last obvious beat. Let’s call these “bookend” beats.</li>
            <li>Measure the exact duration in seconds between the bookend beats.</li>
            <li>Play the song and <em>count</em> all the beats starting at the first bookend beat and ending at the last bookend beat. (If you have an old school calculator, an easy way to do this is type “1+1=” and then just keep tapping “=” to add 1 on each beat.)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Then to get the <em>exact</em> tempo of the track, averaged throughout the entire thing, use this formula:</p>

        <pre><code>bpm = 60 * (number_of_beats - 1) / duration</code></pre>

        <p>Computers have a rough time of this because they don’t really know how to “keep a beat”, and the algorithms that <em>can</em> find the beat do a lot better when they already know the estimated BPM, which is obviously a chicken/egg problem.</p>

        <p>For the first bookend beat in HBFS I used the first beat after the “whooshing” intro, at around 5.58s. The last bookend beat I used the last “work” at about the 3:41.85 mark. (“Never” and “Over” aren’t good candidates because you can’t see their waveform peaks.)</p>

        <p><img src="https://www.madebywindmill.com/tempi/blog/hbfs-bpm/assets/hbfs-first-beat.jpg" alt="Waveform showing the first bookend beat">
            <img src="https://www.madebywindmill.com/tempi/blog/hbfs-bpm/assets/hbfs-final-beat.jpg" alt="Waveform showing the final bookend beat">
        </p>

        <p>That gives exactly 446 beats or 445 intervals.</p>

        <p>I tried this with two different copies of HBFS. The Discovery CD rip I have of the song has a duration between the bookend beats of 216.276, so:</p>

        <pre><code>bpm = 60 * 445 / 216.276 = 123.4499403556</code></pre>

        <p>The “YouTube official audio” track I tested has a duration of 216.282, so:</p>

        <pre><code>bpm = 60 * 445 / 216.282 = 123.4533651445</code></pre>

        <p>The original Discovery CD version has obviously undergone less processing over time than the YouTube version so I tend to think it’s more representative, and it’s <em>very</em> close to 123.45 – only a 0.00005964 difference! But even the more modern YouTube version closely rounds to 123.45.</p>

        <p>So hopefully I’ve put this fact to rest:</p>
        
        <p><b>The BPM of Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger is 123.45.</b></p>
        
        <h2>But…was it intentional?</h2>
        
        <p>The year is 1999 or 2000. Would the gear Daft Punk uses even <em>support</em> fractional BPMs? And if so out to how many decimal places?</p>

        <p>From their 2001 interview with Remix Magazine (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080503064751/http://remixmag.com/mag/remix_robopop/">archive.org</a>) we know that Bangalter says:</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>Our sequencing is done either on an E-mu SP-1200, an Akai MPC, or a PC with Logic Audio software. We do not work on things in just one way.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>And from later interviews we know the Akai MPC was specifically an MPC-3000. (Oh, and that’s <em>Emagic</em>’s Logic, <em>not</em> Apple’s. Apple didn’t acquire Emagic until 2002.)</p>

        <p>Did the E-mu support fractional BPMs? Yes, but only to 1 decimal place:</p>

        <img src="https://www.madebywindmill.com/tempi/blog/hbfs-bpm/assets/e-mu-display.jpg" alt="E-mu SP-1200 display showing tempo">

        <p>The Akai MPC-3000? Yep, also to 1 decimal place:</p>

        <img src="https://www.madebywindmill.com/tempi/blog/hbfs-bpm/assets/akai-display.jpg" alt="Akai MPC-3000 display showing tempo">

        <p>What about Emagic’s Logic?</p>

        <img src="https://www.madebywindmill.com/tempi/blog/hbfs-bpm/assets/logic-tempo.jpg" alt="Emagic Logic tempo display showing 4 decimal places">

        <p>Oooh, look at that. Logic supported BPMs to <em>*4*</em> decimal places.</p>

        <p>But while we know those three sequencers were used on the Discovery album, I’m not sure anyone else knows which one was specifically used on HBFS. I’ve searched and searched and it seems this detail has just never been revealed.</p>

        <p>And to confuse matters more, in a <a href="https://entertainment.time.com/2013/05/21/robocall-a-conversation-with-daft-punk/">2013 interview with Time Magazine</a>, Bangalter says:</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>So we’ve never actually made music with computers! [laughs] Neither Homework nor Discovery nor even Human After All were made with computers.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Was he contradicting himself from 12 years before? Or did he forget? Or maybe it’s a terminology thing?</p>

        <p>That the CD version is <em>so</em> close to exactly 123.45 makes me think this was intentional. And if it was? Well played, robots. You managed to leave a little Easter egg hiding in plain sight for 25 years.</p>
