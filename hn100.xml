<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>EDIT: I have not stated the name of the online marketplace. Assumptions are being made in the comments, which I am neither confirming nor denying.</strong></p>

<p>My entire family was in hospital last week after accidentally consuming poisonous mushrooms.</p>

<p>My wife purchased a book from a major online retailer for my birthday. The book is entitled something similar to: "Mushrooms UK: A Guide to Harvesting Safe and Edible Mushrooms."</p>

<p>It comes with pictures of the mushrooms to help identify each one.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the book in question was not accurate. A closer investigation reveals that the images of mushrooms are AI generated, and we have now found two instances of text where a sentence ends and is followed up with a random questions or fourth-wall breaking statements.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p><em>"In conclusion, morels are delicious mushrooms which can be consumed from August to the end of Summer. Let me know if there is anything else I can help you with."</em></p>

<p>The online retailer have instructed me to return the book and they will refund it. The book has been removed from sale from the online retailer, however, it appears there are dozens more in a similar style.</p>

<p>1.) Should I return this book to the retailer? I'm concerned I would lose any evidence I have if I return it. The purchase has already disappeared from my online account. It simply looks like it doesn't exist anymore. I still have the email.</p>

<p>2.) Are my family entitled to any compensation for my son and my wife's lost time at work? As well as the sickness they experienced?</p>

<p>3.) Can I report the creation of this book to the police as a crime?</p>

<p><strong>Just for clarity: We did not know it was AI-generated when we bought it! This was not disclosed on the website!</strong></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto"><p><em>Engineer’s Codex is a publication about real-world software engineering.</em></p><p>I recently came across a quote by Linus Torvalds (creator of Linux and Git) that  succinctly described a problem I’ve been working on recently:</p><blockquote><p><em>"Bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers worry about data structures and their relationships."</em></p></blockquote><p><span>Right before the above quote, Linus said:</span><br></p><blockquote><p><em>git actually has a simple design, with stable and reasonably well-documented data structures. In fact, I'm a huge proponent of designing your code around the data, rather than the other way around, and I think it's one of the reasons git has been fairly successful […] I will, in fact, claim that the difference between a bad programmer and a good one is whether he considers his code or his data structures more important.</em></p></blockquote><p>Good data structures make code easier to design and maintain. It makes software more reliable, systems more understandable, and code more readable. When designing any software, application logic often follows the data model. Treating the data model as an afterthought results in more work down the line. The inverse is true also - having a well-thought out data model makes migrations and building on top of complex systems easier down the line.</p><p>When I read this quote, I actually was able to recognize countless examples in the past of this. I once worked on a project where we spent quite a while optimizing complex algorithms, only to realize that by restructuring our data, we could eliminate entire classes of problems. We replaced a 500-line function with a 50-line function and a well-designed data structure. Not only was the new code faster, but it was also much easier to understand and maintain.&nbsp;(Of course, then the problem also shifted “down the stack” to where the majority of toil was in restructuring existing data.)</p><p><span>Another relevant quote here is in </span><em>The Art of Unix Programming</em><span>:&nbsp;</span></p><blockquote><p>Rule of Representation: Fold knowledge into data so program logic can be stupid and robust.</p><p>Even the simplest procedural logic is hard for humans to verify, but quite complex data structures are fairly easy to model and reason about. To see this, compare the expressiveness and explanatory power of a diagram of (say) a fifty-node pointer tree with a flowchart of a fifty-line program. Or, compare an array initializer expressing a conversion table with an equivalent switch statement. The difference in transparency and clarity is dramatic. See Rob Pike's Rule 5.</p><p><strong>Data is more tractable than program logic. It follows that where you see a choice between complexity in data structures and complexity in code, choose the former. More: in evolving a design, you should actively seek ways to shift complexity from code to data.</strong></p><p>The Unix community did not originate this insight, but a lot of Unix code displays its influence. The C language's facility at manipulating pointers, in particular, has encouraged the use of dynamically-modified reference structures at all levels of coding from the kernel upward. Simple pointer chases in such structures frequently do duties that implementations in other languages would instead have to embody in more elaborate procedures.</p></blockquote><p><span>The </span><strong>actionable tip here is to start with the data. </strong><span>Try to reduce code complexity through stricter types on your interfaces or databases. Spend extra time thinking through the data structures ahead of time. </span></p><p><span>That’s not to say the </span><em>code isn’t important</em><span>. Obviously, everything is important - but it’s useful to have a strong high-level approach of how data will flow and how different components interact before going deeper into code-related details.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>It’s why one of the </span><em>Senior Engineer (L5)</em><span> requirements (at least for FAANG) generally involves writing higher-level design docs for more complex systems (which includes driving team planning and building good roadmaps for medium-to-large features). </span></p><p><span> from </span></p><p><span> wrote a great piece on the higher level of influence L5s generally have here:</span></p><p><span> from </span></p><p><span> also wrote a great piece about getting to Senior Engineer: </span></p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>Massive banks are now accused of cheating customers billions of dollars in interest payments according to financial reports. </p>



<p>According to a new report by <em>Financial Times</em>, several major Wall Street banks, including <strong><a href="https://franknez.com/wells-fargo-is-now-freezing-bank-accounts-in-new-scandal/">Wells Fargo</a></strong>, Morgan Stanley, and <strong><a href="https://franknez.com/bank-of-america-is-freezing-accounts-in-new-scandal/">Bank of America</a></strong>, are accused of defrauding customers out of billions of dollars in interest payments.</p>



<p>The U.S. <strong>Securities and Exchange Commission</strong> (SEC) is currently investigating these banks to determine whether they intentionally steered clients toward <em>“cash sweep”</em> accounts that provided little to no interest earnings, despite the availability of higher-yielding options.</p>



<p>This alleged practice by the banks would amount to bilking customers out of significant sums of interest income that they should have rightfully earned on their deposits and cash holdings. </p>



<p>The SEC’s probe is aimed at uncovering whether this was a deliberate strategy by the banks to boost their own profits at the expense of their clients.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/de751907-c870-4b8c-b86b-317483f7626f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a> in the Financial Times highlights the concerning allegations of widespread misconduct by some of the largest financial institutions on Wall Street.</p>



<p>If substantiated, this could represent a major scandal involving the potential exploitation of customers through the mismanagement of their cash accounts and interest earnings.</p>



<p>The SEC’s investigation will be crucial in determining the full scope and nature of these alleged practices, as well as any potential enforcement actions or penalties that may be levied against the implicated banks.</p>



<p>The revelations have emerged from new Quarterly filings with the SEC.</p>



<p>In those filings, Wells Fargo says it’s in <em>“resolution talks”</em> with the agency over the issue, Morgan Stanley says the agency began asking questions about it in April and Bank of America confirms it’s currently being scrutinized.</p>



<p>All three banks have declined to comment on the matter.</p>



<p>Other financial firms involved in lawsuits related to cash sweep accounts include LPL Financial and Ameriprise.</p>



<p>LPL Financial says it plans to <em>“vigorously”</em> defend itself against the allegations, while Ameriprise has not released a public statement on the matter.</p>

<p>Massive US banks now prepare for millions to default according to Q2 reports, as institutions increase capital to cover insolvencies.</p>



<p>Big banks such as <strong><a href="https://franknez.com/jpmorgan-is-freezing-customer-bank-accounts-in-new-scandal/">JPMorgan Chase</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://franknez.com/bank-of-america-is-freezing-accounts-in-new-scandal/">Bank of America</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://franknez.com/wells-fargo-is-now-freezing-bank-accounts-in-new-scandal/">Wells Fargo</a></strong> are boosting their financial defenses as they prepare for customer inflow to dwindle, affecting the ability for the average American to pay their bills.</p>



<p>According to the latest Q2 2024 financial reports from major banks, they are significantly increasing the amount of capital they are setting aside to cover potential losses from rising credit card and loan defaults.</p>



<p>Collectively, these banks are allocating billions of dollars into emergency provisions and loan loss reserves to prepare for an anticipated increase in insolvencies and non-performing loans. </p>



<p>This reflects the banks’ growing concerns about the potential for a rise in credit card delinquencies and loan defaults in the coming months.</p>



<p>By bolstering their loss-absorbing capital buffers, the banks are attempting to proactively mitigate the financial risks posed by a potential surge in credit-related delinquencies and insolvencies. </p>



<p>This suggests the banks foresee a deterioration in consumer credit quality and are taking prudent steps to strengthen their balance sheets and resilience against such adverse credit trends.</p>



<p>The significant increase in these emergency loan loss provisions across the banking sector signals that the institutions are bracing for a potential economic downturn that could lead to a rise in loan defaults and credit-related write-offs.</p>



<p>This move underscores the banks’ efforts to position themselves to better withstand any upcoming challenges in the credit markets.</p>



<p>JPMorgan Chase is leading the way, increasing its provisions from $1.88 billion in the first quarter of this year to $3.05 billion – a $1.17 billion jump.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Bank of America has set aside $1.5 billion, up from $1.3 billion in the previous quarter, and Wells Fargo set aside $1.24 billion, up from $938 million in the previous quarter.</p>



<p>The increasing balances show banks are anticipating increasing economic risk in the months ahead as commercial real estate flounders and as consumers pile up a&nbsp;whopping&nbsp;$1.02 trillion in credit card balances, according to <a href="https://newsroom.transunion.com/ciir-q1-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TransUnion</a>.</p>



<p>Delinquency rates across various types of debt are already on the rise, and the New York Federal Reserve&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/news/research/2024/20240514" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">says</a>&nbsp;total US household debt hit $17.69 trillion in the first quarter of this year, an increase of $184 billion from the previous quarter.</p>



<p>The number includes mortgage balances, which rose by $190 billion to $12.44 trillion, and auto loans, which increased by $9 billion to $1.62 trillion.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Recent advances in AI have been significantly driven by the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to solve complex problems in ways that resemble human thinking. However, there is an ongoing debate about the extent to which LLMs are capable of actual reasoning. Central to this debate are two key probabilistic concepts that are essential for connecting causes to their effects: the probability of necessity (PN) and the probability of sufficiency (PS). This paper introduces a framework that is both theoretical and practical, aimed at assessing how effectively LLMs are able to replicate real-world reasoning mechanisms using these probabilistic measures. By viewing LLMs as abstract machines that process information through a natural language interface, we examine the conditions under which it is possible to compute suitable approximations of PN and PS. Our research marks an important step towards gaining a deeper understanding of when LLMs are capable of reasoning, as illustrated by a series of math examples.

<h3>4th Edition Information</h3>
<p>
This page details progress on the 4th edition of the book. The <a href="https://discrete.openmathbooks.org/dmoi3.html">3rd edition</a> remains available.
</p>
</div>
<p>
After many years of development, I am please to announce that the 4th edition of <em>Discrete Mathematics: an Open Introduction</em> is <strong>now available</strong>, here and on <a href="https://runestone.academy/">Runestone Academy</a>.
</p>
<p>
The new edition brings many improvements and a new organization of content. In particular, the book now starts with logic and proofs, then practices those proofs with graph theory. The second half of the book contains material on counting (with a new "application to probability" section) and sequences. Over the last few years, I have found that students have more success with this arrangement. There is also a stronger emphasis on discrte structures, which should make the book more useful for students in computer science, while still focusing on understanding mathematical concepts essential for math majors and future math teachers.
</p>
<p>
There is more interactivity as well. More interactive exercises (which you can give students credit for if you create a course with the book on Runestone Academy; it is completely free for you and your students) and some interactive Sage and Python code to explore some topics.
</p>
<p>
A PDF of the book will be made available by August 15th. There will not be a print edition available until next year, when CRC Press will release it. The online version will remain available and free forever, and the book is still released under a Creative Commons License (but note the new NC-Non Commercial addition to the license).

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>On a steamy June evening, Curtis Eckerman embarks on a mothing expedition in the Bauerle Ranch greenbelt, in far South Austin. Towing a wagon full of supplies, he follows a narrow trail that leads between mesquite trees and into a secluded oak grove suffused with golden late-afternoon light. Eckerman, the chair of the biology department at Austin Community College, parks the wagon and begins to wrap a tree trunk in white cloth. Next he suspends a battery-powered ultraviolet light from a low branch. He’s optimistic we’ll see lots of different moths tonight; it’s been a warm, humid day, conducive to plant growth and, by extension, activity by plant-eating creatures. The oak grove is full of frostweed, persimmon trees, and various grasses, each vital to different moth species. That’s another good sign: a wide variety of plants will draw a variety of moths.</p><p>When he finishes his preparations, it’s about eight o’clock. Moths emerge to eat, mate, and lay eggs once it’s completely dark—and fellow moth-ers will arrive any moment now. Eckerman mops his brow and takes a swig from his water bottle. “Now we just wait.”</p><p>Eckerman is a herpetologist by trade; he says the best job he ever had was catching endangered water snakes in West Texas as an undergraduate research assistant. But he’s always collected insects, and a little over a decade ago, he began photographing them. When he realized he struggled to identify the moths in his pictures simply because there were so many varieties, he dedicated a summer to studying them. These days, he sets a light by his garage door and photographs whatever moths show up, as many as seventy species and thousands of individuals in a single night. He’s now counted 550 species at his own home.&nbsp;</p><p>Eckerman is an ecologist with an interest in biodiversity, as well as in species’ natural histories, behaviors, life cycles, and places in the food chain. Moths are so diverse, he says, that it’s not uncommon to find one that hasn’t been named or described in the scientific literature. No entomologist studies “moths”; out of necessity, they specialize. Travis County has about 1,400 recorded species, the state of Texas more than 4,000. And those are just the ones we know about. Insects are the most diverse group of animals on the planet, and there are likely more undiscovered insect species than known ones—as many as 10 to 20 million species worldwide still left to discover, Rice University biologist Scott Egan told <em>Texas Monthly</em> <a href="https://www.texasmonthly.com/travel/tiger-beetle-rice-university-houstoniana-discovery-new-species/">earlier this year.</a></p><p>The most common type of moths in the U.S. are&nbsp;noctuids, the smaller, grayish-brown moths that congregate around porch lights—“Your stereotypical moth,” Eckerman says. Showier <a href="https://www.texasmonthly.com/travel/hummingbird-moth-texas-yards/">hawk moths</a> are active during the day and often confused with hummingbirds. Silk moths, such as the luna moth, enormous and apple green, don’t have functional mouth parts; their one-to-two-week adult lives are powered by whatever fat they’ve stored as caterpillars. Micromoths—a broad descriptor that can include noctuids and moths in other families—have wingspans under twenty millimeters long, but are worth viewing through a magnifying glass or camera to admire their vivid colors and patterns. They’re one of Eckerman’s favorite groups to photograph because of the “hidden-gem effect,” he says. “It’s the idea that you get to see something that somebody normally doesn’t see.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. You feel like you’re exploring a world that others are not exploring, even though it’s around them all the time.”</p><figure><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="2400" height="1500" alt="Clockwise from top left: Silk Moth/Polyphemus Moth, Hawk Moth/White-lined Sphinx Moth, Micromoth/Leaf Miner Moth, Southern Emerald, Noctuid/Wedgeling Moth" sizes="(max-width: 2400px) 100vw, 2400px" data-src="https://img.texasmonthly.com/2024/08/curtis-eckerman-texas-moths-photos-1.jpg?auto=compress&amp;crop=faces&amp;fit=fit&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1&amp;q=45" data-srcset="https://img.texasmonthly.com/2024/08/curtis-eckerman-texas-moths-photos-1.jpg?auto=compress&amp;crop=faces&amp;fit=scale&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;h=188&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1&amp;q=45&amp;w=300&amp;wpsize=medium 300w, https://img.texasmonthly.com/2024/08/curtis-eckerman-texas-moths-photos-1.jpg?auto=compress&amp;crop=faces&amp;fit=scale&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;h=640&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1&amp;q=45&amp;w=1024&amp;wpsize=large 1024w, https://img.texasmonthly.com/2024/08/curtis-eckerman-texas-moths-photos-1.jpg?auto=compress&amp;crop=faces&amp;fit=scale&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;h=480&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1&amp;q=45&amp;w=768&amp;wpsize=medium_large 768w, https://img.texasmonthly.com/2024/08/curtis-eckerman-texas-moths-photos-1.jpg?auto=compress&amp;crop=faces&amp;fit=scale&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;h=960&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1&amp;q=45&amp;w=1536&amp;wpsize=1536x1536 1536w, https://img.texasmonthly.com/2024/08/curtis-eckerman-texas-moths-photos-1.jpg?auto=compress&amp;crop=faces&amp;fit=scale&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;h=1280&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1&amp;q=45&amp;w=2048&amp;wpsize=2048x2048 2048w, https://img.texasmonthly.com/2024/08/curtis-eckerman-texas-moths-photos-1.jpg?auto=compress&amp;crop=faces&amp;fit=scale&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;h=31&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1&amp;q=45&amp;w=50&amp;wpsize=concierge-thumb 50w, https://img.texasmonthly.com/2024/08/curtis-eckerman-texas-moths-photos-1.jpg?auto=compress&amp;crop=faces&amp;fit=fit&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1&amp;q=45 2400w" data-sizes="auto" src="https://img.texasmonthly.com/2024/08/curtis-eckerman-texas-moths-photos-1.jpg?auto=compress&amp;crop=faces&amp;fit=fit&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1&amp;q=45"><figcaption><span>Clockwise from top left: silk moth, hawk moth, micromoth, southern emerald, and wedgling moth. </span><span>Texas Monthly; Moth Photographs by Curtis Eckerman</span></figcaption></figure><p>Much of Eckerman’s moth self-education comes from the participatory science app iNaturalist. Users take pictures of plants, insects, and other animals they spot in their local areas and upload them with comments (“Anyone know what kind of owl this is?”). Fellow iNaturalists compare notes and help one another identify mystery species. The app also suggests possible identifications with an impressive degree of accuracy. Users can note the location where they saw a given plant or animal, creating a dataset that has helped researchers understand the ranges of particular species. Virtual communities form quickly and move into real life as users go mothing, birding, or herping together. &nbsp;</p><p>Eckerman posted his first moth images to iNaturalist ten years ago, and other users coached him on how to take better photos to make identification easier. He started teaching the students in his Structure and Function of Organisms course at ACC to use iNaturalist to log their own observations. Eckerman has tracked his former students’ engagement with the app via their usernames and found that three years after taking his class, 30 percent are still active.</p><p>Too many Texans are disengaged from the natural wonders around them, he argues, but iNaturalist can help them tune in. “The average student today could tell you all sorts of things about the plains of the Serengeti and interactions between zebra and lions, because National Geographic and Discovery and Disney brought it to us in high definition,” Eckerman says. “But they know far less about what’s in their own backyard than the previous generation, because they’re just not interacting with it.” Over the years, he’s stopped talking about faraway exotic animals in his courses; he instead makes lessons relevant by focusing on local fauna students have actually seen: coyotes, gray foxes, grackles, moths.</p><p>To help his students apply their iNaturalist skills in the field, he organizes mothing expeditions to Pease Park, in Central Austin, and Roy G. Guerrero park, in East Austin. At the latter site, the classes have logged about 350 moth species, including an enormous black witch, longer than a chalkboard eraser and sometimes confused for a bat—it’s the largest noctuid in the continental U.S. Roy G. Guerrero is a much larger park than Pease and more buffered from human activity that would interfere with moths. Still, the Pease Park surveys have turned up more than two hundred species—proving, Eckerman says, that urban parks are important not just as sites of human recreation but also for supporting species diversity. In the spring, Eckerman invited the public to go mothing at the park, part of his ongoing effort to educate the general population about biodiversity and conservation. For impromptu events like the June expedition on the greenbelt, he maintains a “moth-lovers email list” and lets word spread on iNaturalist.</p><p>An hour after sunset, the afternoon buzz of cicadas has given way to the rhythmic rattle of <a href="https://www.texasmonthly.com/travel/welcome-to-hot-katydid-summer/">katydids</a>. A half dozen moth lovers gather in the oak grove and peer at the moths flittering against Eckerman’s sheet, including the <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/224855-Melipotis-indomita" target="_blank">indomitable melipotis</a>, a large brown triangle with a cream-colored V across its wings, and the smaller filbertworm moth, its wings a mottled red with bands of gold.</p><p>Reid Hardin, a biology student at Texas State University, studies the moths before disappearing into the shadows to look for scorpions. Hardin’s into moths—he sometimes sets up a light in his own backyard—but he also scouts out rare plants and various arachnids. iNaturalist has connected him with locals who share his curiosity. Tonight, he and Caleb Helsel, a Westlake High School student who’s into birds, insects, and arachnids, are comparing notes on the pseudoscorpions they’ve turned up at Austin greenbelts. “It’s just always cool to see who else is interested in niche, nerdy stuff,” Hardin says.</p><figure><img decoding="async" width="2400" height="1500" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 2400px) 100vw, 2400px" data-src="https://img.texasmonthly.com/2024/08/curtis-eckerman-texas-moths-photos-3.jpg?auto=compress&amp;crop=faces&amp;fit=fit&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1&amp;q=45" data-srcset="https://img.texasmonthly.com/2024/08/curtis-eckerman-texas-moths-photos-3.jpg?auto=compress&amp;crop=faces&amp;fit=scale&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;h=188&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1&amp;q=45&amp;w=300&amp;wpsize=medium 300w, https://img.texasmonthly.com/2024/08/curtis-eckerman-texas-moths-photos-3.jpg?auto=compress&amp;crop=faces&amp;fit=scale&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;h=640&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1&amp;q=45&amp;w=1024&amp;wpsize=large 1024w, https://img.texasmonthly.com/2024/08/curtis-eckerman-texas-moths-photos-3.jpg?auto=compress&amp;crop=faces&amp;fit=scale&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;h=480&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1&amp;q=45&amp;w=768&amp;wpsize=medium_large 768w, https://img.texasmonthly.com/2024/08/curtis-eckerman-texas-moths-photos-3.jpg?auto=compress&amp;crop=faces&amp;fit=scale&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;h=960&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1&amp;q=45&amp;w=1536&amp;wpsize=1536x1536 1536w, https://img.texasmonthly.com/2024/08/curtis-eckerman-texas-moths-photos-3.jpg?auto=compress&amp;crop=faces&amp;fit=scale&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;h=1280&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1&amp;q=45&amp;w=2048&amp;wpsize=2048x2048 2048w, https://img.texasmonthly.com/2024/08/curtis-eckerman-texas-moths-photos-3.jpg?auto=compress&amp;crop=faces&amp;fit=scale&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;h=31&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1&amp;q=45&amp;w=50&amp;wpsize=concierge-thumb 50w, https://img.texasmonthly.com/2024/08/curtis-eckerman-texas-moths-photos-3.jpg?auto=compress&amp;crop=faces&amp;fit=fit&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1&amp;q=45 2400w" data-sizes="auto" src="https://img.texasmonthly.com/2024/08/curtis-eckerman-texas-moths-photos-3.jpg?auto=compress&amp;crop=faces&amp;fit=fit&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1&amp;q=45"><figcaption><span>Clockwise from top left: filbertworm moth, common buckeye butterfly, eight-spot moth, indomitable melipotis, sculptured moth, and plume moth.</span><span>Texas Monthly; Moth Photographs by Curtis Eckerman</span></figcaption></figure><p>Moths aren’t just pretty to look at; they’re also important pollinators and a major source of food for birds and bats. But moths, like insects overall, are declining in both raw numbers and species diversity. Eckerman says recent studies have shown at least a 30 percent decline in insect abundance around the world over the past few decades. The likely culprits are pesticides and the loss of habitat to urban development. A threat to insects such as moths is a threat to the plants they pollinate and all the creatures above them in the food chain.</p><p>Beyond eschewing pesticides, Texans can create more moth-friendly environments by using a variety of native plants in their yards to offer food. Reducing light pollution helps too; moths are disoriented by artificial light, which can impair reproduction. If moths lay their eggs under the light instead of on a plant that is their food source, the resulting larvae won’t have anything to eat. Turning off lights at night (Eckerman always disassembles his setup at the end of the evening) helps moths find their way to the right plant.</p><p>By 10 p.m., Eckerman’s sheet is littered with diminutive flying insects: micromoths, small beetles, caddis flies, and plant hoppers. He leans in to photograph a tiny moth, using a camera with a macro lens that lets him take clear images at a short distance. To the naked eye, the moth—smaller than a grain of rice—is plain white. But when Eckerman enlarges the image on the viewfinder, he reveals a pattern of buckwheat-colored flecks on cream-hued wings. Eckerman can’t remember its name—he just knows it’s in the <em>Gracillariidae</em> family—but iNaturalist will fill in the details.</p><p>Overall, he says, it’s been a good night for the really small moths, which makes him happy. “Despite there not being all that glamorous moths, this is actually my favorite kind of sheet, with all the tiny things,” he says. “I love seeing the little jewels that you can’t normally see.”</p>

<p>One of my favorite game jams is the legendary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Js13kGames" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Js13kGames competition</a>, where participants have one month to make a web browser game that fits in a 13 kilobyte zip file. To put that into perspective, a floppy disk from the before times could hold 1.44 MB, enough to fit over 100 JS13K games!</p>



<p>In 2021 the contest celebrated its 10th annual event. The theme was “Space” and there were an impressive 223 games submitted. It was my third year participating in the contest. That was a few years ago and I am back now to share with you the story of how my entry was made. Better late then never!</p>


<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" width="240" height="160" src="https://frankforce.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/screenshot3a.png" alt="Space Huggers logo"></figure></div>


<p>My game, “Space Huggers” is a run and gun roguelike platformer with procedurally generated environments and a pixel art style. I was inspired by games like Broforce, Metal Slug, and Contra. The engine was written from scratch in pure JavaScript and has since been open sourced under the name <a href="https://github.com/KilledByAPixel/LittleJS" data-type="URL" data-id="https://github.com/KilledByAPixel/LittleJS" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LittleJS.</a> It’s a great little engine with many nice features packed into a tiny footprint with clean well documented code.</p>



<p>In this post I will explain how my game works and the design process I went through while developing it. We will not go into detail about the code here, but <a href="https://github.com/KilledByAPixel/SpaceHuggers">it’s all available on GitHub</a> for you to check out. Also, there is now an improved version on Newgrounds with some bonus features like medals, a final boss fight, and even support for mobile devices.</p>

<h2>Making Tiny Games</h2>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="281" height="635" src="https://frankforce.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/screen-1.png" alt="my tiny ski game" srcset="https://frankforce.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/screen-1.png 281w, https://frankforce.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/screen-1-133x300.png 133w" sizes="(max-width: 281px) 100vw, 281px"></figure></div>


<p>For several years I’ve been studying the strange art of writing tiny programs. Back in 2019, after a long career in mainstream games, I found myself somewhat burnt out from working with giant code bases. I wanted to get back to basics and try something radically different. So on a whim I decided to make <a href="https://frankforce.com/im-only-making-small-game-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a tiny ski game in C++</a> and found it to be one of the most fun experiences of my career.</p>



<p>Thirsty for more I stumbled across the <a href="https://js1k.com/">JS1k competition</a> which happened to already be in progress. I knew immediately that I needed to participate, so learned JavaScript on the fly. <a href="https://frankforce.com/i-made-7-demos-in-2-weeks-for-js1k/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">After 2 weeks and a few all-nighters, I submitted 6 demos to the contest.</a> It was clear, I was hooked on writing tiny code!</p>



<p>Over the next the few years I honed my JavaScript skills by making games, tools, art, and other experiments. On a website called Dwitter I released over a thousand tiny programs that push the boundaries of a 140 character limitation. I also released a few longform generative art projects using only vanilla JavaScript. All this was drastically different from what I had been doing for the past 20 years while programming in C++ at major game studios, but it fees like I finally discovered my true calling.</p>



<h2>Enter JS13K</h2>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="160" height="160" src="https://frankforce.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/screen2.png" alt="bounce back logo" srcset="https://frankforce.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/screen2.png 160w, https://frankforce.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/screen2-150x150.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 160px) 100vw, 160px"></figure></div>


<p>In subsequent years I’ve entered <a href="https://js13kgames.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">JS13K </a>several times. The first time <a href="https://js13kgames.com/entries/bounce-back" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I received 2nd place with a Bounce Back</a>, my Link’s Awakening homage, which also has <a href="https://frankforce.com/bounce-back-postmortem/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a lengthy writeup.</a> The next year <a href="https://js13kgames.com/entries/notecraft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NoteCraft</a>, my cellular automata music creator, won both the Audio and Innovation categories. That same year I released <a href="https://killedbyapixel.github.io/OS13k/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OS13k</a>, a tiny JavaScript operating system that won the Super Special award given by the organizer of the contest. <a href="https://github.com/KilledByAPixel/OS13k">I open sourced OS13k on GitHub</a> and have continuing adding apps to it. My most recent entry to JS13k was in 2022 when I submitted <a href="https://js13kgames.com/entries/egg-time-rewind" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Egg Time Rewind.</a></p>



<p>This time I wanted to take things to the next level, by building a new game engine suitable for high quality low size games. There are already some tools of this sort available, like <a href="https://straker.github.io/kontra/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kontra </a>and <a href="https://github.com/bitnenfer/tiny-canvas" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tiny-Canvas</a>, but none with extensive feature set I required. So when the contest started on August 13th, my first step was to make the engine before I could begin working on a game.</p>



<h2>Building The Engine</h2>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="150" height="150" src="https://frankforce.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2b-150x150.png" alt="LittleJS Logo"></figure></div>


<p>This primary goal of this engine is to be as small as possible while delivering the most powerful features. Using what I learned from making Bounce Back, I reworked everything to create even tighter and cleaner code. I eventually released the engine on GitHub as <a href="https://github.com/KilledByAPixel/LittleJS">LittleJS</a> with an open source license and still continue to improve it.</p>



<p>At its core, the engine uses an object oriented architecture that’s easy to build games with. For graphics it uses WebGL to render a massive amount of sprites at 60 FPS. The audio system uses <a href="https://killedbyapixel.github.io/ZzFX/">ZzFX </a>to procedurally create stereo sound effects. The input system handles keyboard, mouse, touch, and analog gamepads. I even wrote a small 2D physics system and collision solver.</p>



<p><a href="https://youtu.be/_dXKU0WgAj8?si=fPfn4YgHINchWZVu">I have talked a lot about LittleJS before</a> so we won’t go into details here but it took a long time to get all that working. About half the contest had flown by before I was ready to move on to any real game design or art.</p>



<h2>Game Design</h2>



<p>The run-and-gun genera doesn’t get as much love now as it did when I was growing up. I’m not sure why games like Contra and Metal Slug have declined in popularity. Maybe because first person shooters and metroidvania style games overtook the genre. Still, occasionally there are a few gems that get the formula right. One of my favorites is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broforce" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Broforce by Free Lives.</a></p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="600" height="337" src="https://frankforce.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/002798s008.jpg" alt="broforce screenshot" srcset="https://frankforce.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/002798s008.jpg 600w, https://frankforce.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/002798s008-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"><figcaption>Broforce by Free Lives</figcaption></figure>



<p>The original Broforce came out in 2015 and has since seen many updates and ports to consoles, I highly recommend giving it a go. You may not know that the original Broforce prototype was made in only one weekend for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludum_Dare">Ludum Dare game jam</a> under the title <a href="https://broforce.fandom.com/wiki/Rambros" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rambros</a>. To gather research for my game I spent a few hours playing both Broforce and the original demo while taking copious notes.</p>



<p>I would need to distill this concept down to its core in order to pack as much gameplay as possible into the size limit. I decided to use procedurally generated levels to save space and add replay value. Instead of adding a lot of extra content, I focused on creating fun and polished core gameplay. To give myself an extra challenge, I wanted this game to support up to 4 player cooperative play, a first for JS13K!</p>



<h2>Art and Animation</h2>



<p>Because space is so limited, designing the art requires careful thought and planning. With most modern games, the art takes up a significant portion of the storage space. For this game I wanted to mimic the look of classic 16-bit games, so it uses a pixel art style sprite sheet.</p>



<p>Most tiles are 16×16 pixels in size with a few smaller 8×8 tiles. Some of the tiles are gray so color can be applied at run time. Limiting the number of colors also allows the image to be compressed better. The entire sprite sheet is only a 16 color 128×48 image as seen here…</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="538" height="222" src="https://frankforce.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/tiles1.png" alt="tile sheet used by Space Huggers" srcset="https://frankforce.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/tiles1.png 538w, https://frankforce.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/tiles1-300x124.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 538px) 100vw, 538px"></figure></div>


<p>When designing the sprites for my game I looked at the sprite sheet for Broforce as a guide to help understand the character art. Broforce actually has a ton of sprites and animation frames, but I was able to distill it down to just two frames of animation for everything! This includes standing, running, jumping, climbing ladders, flipping, rolling, and dying. For some of those actions like rolling the sprite is rotated to animate it without requiring any extra art.</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="150" height="150" src="https://frankforce.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/brospritecompare.png" alt="sprite comparison between Space Huggers and Broforce"><figcaption>Sprite comparison</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>In my sprite sheet the heads are separate from the body. That allows the characters to have procedural animation with the body bobbing up and down during the run cycle.</p>



<p>The player’s eyes are also animated procedurally and will randomly blink to make the character seem more alive. When the player dies the sprite closes its eyes and rolls over sideways. It’s kind of dramatic!</p>



<p>The level art is also created using tiles from the sprite sheet with random coloring applied. This includes both the outside ground and enemy bases interiors. Outlines around the level geometry are added procedurally to make the edges stand out and give a more polished look. By combining all these elements together, it is possible to do a lot with a little!</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="589" height="394" src="https://frankforce.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-3-e1723240352650.png" alt="space huggers screenshot showing enemy base structure" srcset="https://frankforce.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-3-e1723240352650.png 589w, https://frankforce.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-3-e1723240352650-300x201.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 589px) 100vw, 589px"></figure>



<h2>Player Design</h2>



<p>For the look of the player character I wanted something alien but humanoid. The colors were chosen to contrast with each other and pop out from the background so the sprite is visible as possible. I always try to make gender neutral player characters so it’s easier for more people to identify with. After experimenting with different concepts I settled on a design only slightly inspired by Greedo from Star Wars. I was surprised how many people called me out on it!</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="400" height="350" src="https://frankforce.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/greedo.png" alt="comparison of player with greedo" srcset="https://frankforce.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/greedo.png 400w, https://frankforce.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/greedo-300x263.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"></figure></div>


<p>The game design for the player was informed by retro platformers like Mario, Contra, and some modern indies like Broforce. Something I love is how these games have single hit kills but also abundant extra lives, it makes for really exciting gameplay. Because my game is essentially an action roguelike, I made sure to supply the player with a variety of abilities to get out of any situation they find themselves stuck in.</p>


<div>
<figure><a href="https://frankforce.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/WkwuVRP.gif"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="256" height="256" src="https://frankforce.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/WkwuVRP.gif" alt=""></a><figcaption>Squaresville for Sifteo Cubes</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The player has a classic platformer movement package including the ability to break blocks and climb walls by jumping. All of the physics code was written from scratch for this game. I used a similar physics solution to <a href="https://youtu.be/nbZyXP7SCEg?si=wpEQrSUgR6VAoeSk">the system I developed in 2013 for Sifteo Cubes.</a> One of the toughest things to implement was the way ladders are interacted with. After the end of the contest I had to submit an emergency fix because of a glitch allowing the player to pass into collision by jumping into a ladder from the wrong angle!</p>



<p>The player also has a multi functional roll ability that provides a boost of speed and brief window of invulnerability. It has many uses including dodging bullets, double jumping, putting out fires, and knocking out enemies. This roll recharges after only a few seconds with a little flash so the player notices that it’s available again.</p>



<p>The primary weapon is a gun that not only kills most enemies in one hit but also destroys objects and level geometry. It has limited range so players will need to get in close to hit anything. For a little extra fun players also has 3 grenades that denotate with a large explosion destroying, pushing away, and lighting everything on fire. It’s a fun way to soften up a room!</p>



<h2>Enemy Design</h2>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="150" height="225" src="https://frankforce.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/08c3af3c6f09112b192408d028bf9649.png" alt="halo game cover"></figure></div>


<p>The enemies all use the same base code as the player, so their AI works more like a bot then a typical videogame enemy. At a high level they send control inputs to the shared character class the same way as the player. This approach allows for interesting and complex combat encounters while reducing how much code is needed.</p>



<p>The pixel art for the enemies was inspired by the Spartans in the Halo series. I thought it would be fun to subvert the concept space marines by making it about aliens fighting to defend their home planets against a military invasion. All of the enemy types use the same sprite but with a different tint and visor color to differentiate them.</p>



<p>There are 5 enemy types, from easiest to most difficult…</p>



<ul>
<li>Recruit (Green) – A bit shorter then normal, hesitant to attack, dies in one hit.</li>



<li>Soldier (Blue) – Average height and ability, takes 2 hits to kill.</li>



<li>Captain (Red) – Can climb walls and jumps more often, takes 3 hits.</li>



<li>Specialist (White) – Jumps and rolls often like ninjas, takes 4 hits.</li>



<li>Demolitions Expert (Purple) – Throws grenades and can’t catch on fire, takes 5 hits!</li>
</ul>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="541" height="211" src="https://frankforce.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/2021-09-18-20_14_38-Space-Huggers2.png" alt="all enemies in space huggers" srcset="https://frankforce.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/2021-09-18-20_14_38-Space-Huggers2.png 541w, https://frankforce.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/2021-09-18-20_14_38-Space-Huggers2-300x117.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 541px) 100vw, 541px"></figure></div>


<p>There is also a small chance of any enemy type being spawned as heavy weapons variation. These mini boss enemies are larger with double health and shoot in fully automatic mode.</p>



<p>The enemy AI uses a pretty complex state machine since they can do all the same actions as the player. In addition to patrol and search behaviors, they will also engage in some surprisingly varied combat maneuvers. Giving each enemy type a unique theme helped inform me about how to design their AI. I love making enemies that can keep the player on their toes!</p>



<h2>Object Design</h2>

<p>One of my favorite things about playing games is causing unexpected chain reactions. This kind of emergent behavior is often facilitated by a fire propagation system, something I’ve implemented in many games before like Psi-Ops which I worked on at Midway Games.</p>



<p>This time I streamlined the design to use only a few objects that combine to create complex behaviors and fun scenarios. Some of these objects are able to catch on fire, and send heat events to nearby objects, eventually catching them on fire. Other objects are able to explode which damages and pushes away nearby objects while also setting more things on fire. There’s even a water barrel that can put out fires!</p>



<p>All of these objects use only 3 sprites: a crate, a barrel, and a rock. By using different tints and additive colors it’s possible to represent many different types of objects…</p>



<ul>
<li>Wooden Crate (Brown) – Burns easily and breaks when fully burnt.</li>



<li>Metal Crate &amp; Barrel (Gray) – Hard to destroy and can’t burn.</li>



<li>Explosive Crate &amp; Barrel (Green) – Burns and explodes after a few seconds.</li>



<li>High Explosive Barrel (Red) – Explodes quicker with a larger radius than normal explosives.</li>



<li>Water Barrel (Blue) – Puts out fires and pushes away objects.</li>



<li>Rock (Grayish) – Heavy and very hard to destroy, can’t burn, and crush enemies.</li>



<li>Lava Rock (Glowing Orange) – Anything it touches is lit on fire!</li>
</ul>

<h2>Extra Game Design</h2>



<p>The only other game object that the player interacts with are checkpoint flags that can be activated just by touching them. This system allows players to respawn closer to the action when they die. The flag also has a special function in co-op multiplayer mode because when a player dies, the remaining players need to get to a checkpoint to respawn their buddies.</p>

<p>The final thing I squeezed into this game was a radar system that appears along the bottom of the screen. It’s a simple but effective way to show where all the enemies are in relation to the player. I added it after experiencing some frustration while tracking down the last few enemies!</p>



<h2>Level Design</h2>



<p>The levels are procedurally generated so they are different for every playthrough. This can be a great way to cut down on file size for JS13K while also giving players an unlimited amount of content to explore. The real trick is generating levels that are interesting and fun for players.</p>



<p>To give structure to the level design, there are enemy bases composed of different rooms that follow a specific set of rules. This includes both the level geometry as well as placement of enemies and objects. It is probably the most complex part of the game and I was very proud of the result with some super interesting procedurally generated levels. This is definitely something I want to experiment more with in the future.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="640" src="https://frankforce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/E_QhwaUX0AI38uL-1024x640.jpg" alt="enemy base" srcset="https://frankforce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/E_QhwaUX0AI38uL-1024x640.jpg 1024w, https://frankforce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/E_QhwaUX0AI38uL-300x188.jpg 300w, https://frankforce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/E_QhwaUX0AI38uL-768x480.jpg 768w, https://frankforce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/E_QhwaUX0AI38uL-1536x960.jpg 1536w, https://frankforce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/E_QhwaUX0AI38uL.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>The bases include some special things like partially transparent windows that allow the background to show through and energy doors that can be shot to break them open. To create extra variation the bases are sometimes made to look like caves and underground mines.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="640" src="https://frankforce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/E_Qh1E-WQAgml31-1024x640.jpg" alt="large enemy base" srcset="https://frankforce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/E_Qh1E-WQAgml31-1024x640.jpg 1024w, https://frankforce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/E_Qh1E-WQAgml31-300x188.jpg 300w, https://frankforce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/E_Qh1E-WQAgml31-768x480.jpg 768w, https://frankforce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/E_Qh1E-WQAgml31-1536x960.jpg 1536w, https://frankforce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/E_Qh1E-WQAgml31.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>The ground around the bases uses a random noise algorithm. A few deep chasms are also created that allow enemies or the player to fall to their doom. Checkpoints are placed across the map at roughly regular intervals.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://frankforce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/screenshot-2021-09-28T123449.993-1024x576.png" alt="very large enemy base" srcset="https://frankforce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/screenshot-2021-09-28T123449.993-1024x576.png 1024w, https://frankforce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/screenshot-2021-09-28T123449.993-300x169.png 300w, https://frankforce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/screenshot-2021-09-28T123449.993-768x432.png 768w, https://frankforce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/screenshot-2021-09-28T123449.993.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<h2>Background Effects</h2>



<p>In the background there’s a layered sky system. The parallax mountainscapes are generated using an algorithm I’ve been working on that creates interesting looking landscapes with just a tiny bit of code. Behind that is a gradient with stars and suns that move in the sky to help emphasize the otherworldly feeling of being on another planet.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="546" src="https://frankforce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/LittleJS-35-1024x546.png" alt="background sky effect" srcset="https://frankforce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/LittleJS-35-1024x546.png 1024w, https://frankforce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/LittleJS-35-300x160.png 300w, https://frankforce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/LittleJS-35-768x409.png 768w, https://frankforce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/LittleJS-35-1536x818.png 1536w, https://frankforce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/LittleJS-35.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>Some levels even have precipitation effects like rain and snow. This is a great way to demonstrate the particle system and collision physics. More importantly it adds a layer of atmosphere to the game that helps each level feel like a more unique and interesting place.</p>



<h2>Sound Design</h2>



<p>All of the audio is played using <a href="https://killedbyapixel.github.io/ZzFX/">my open source sound effect tool ZzFX.</a> It’s a tiny self contained sound effect player that generates audio samples from a set of 20 parameters. I was happy to see that many other JS13K games <a href="https://x.com/KilledByAPixel/status/1445455434542845963">used ZzFX that year including 5 of the top 10 games!</a></p>



<p>In total Space Huggers uses 11 different sound effects and it took a lot of tweaking to get those sounding right. My favorite sound in the game is the footstep sound used by the player.</p>



<p>To achieve an atmospheric sound when there is wind or rain, a quiet noisy effect plays every few seconds, overlapping itself with some randomness. I was inspired to give this a shot after hearing it done in another great JS13K game, <a href="https://js13kgames.com/entries/the-wandering-wraith">The Wandering Wraith by Mateusz Tomczyk.</a></p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="665" src="https://frankforce.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/screenshot-4.png" alt="zzfx editor" srcset="https://frankforce.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/screenshot-4.png 800w, https://frankforce.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/screenshot-4-300x249.png 300w, https://frankforce.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/screenshot-4-768x638.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></figure>



<h2>Making a Build System</h2>



<p>This is the first year that I fully automated my build process and it was well worth the effort. Previously there were too many manual steps necessary to build the final zipped project. This was especially a problem towards the end of the jam, when the size gets near the limit and it becomes necessary to build more often to check the final size.</p>



<p>My build system is nothing fancy. I just made a windows bat file, but in the click of a button it does the everything I need…</p>



<ul>
<li>Combines all js files together.</li>



<li>Runs <a href="https://developers.google.com/closure">Google Closure</a>, Uglify, and <a href="https://github.com/lifthrasiir/roadroller" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roadroller </a>on the code.</li>



<li>Combines the minified code into a single html file.</li>



<li>Zips the html with <a href="https://github.com/fhanau/Efficient-Compression-Tool" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ECT</a>.</li>
</ul>



<p>For projects of this size I don’t do a lot of hand minification but instead rely on tools like Google Closure so the source code can remain clean and easy to work with. Though I’ve found Closure to be the best first pass minifier, running Terser or Uglify seemed to squeeze out a few more bytes. Overall I’ve been very impressed at how good Closure is at removing dead code while minifying everything else.</p>



<p>That same year <a href="https://twitter.com/senokay">Kang Seonghoon</a> introduced a new tool called Roadroller that was a total game changer. It uses a neural network to pack JavaScript code significantly better into a zip file, enough to fit several more kilobytes of code! At first it doesn’t seem possible, but I can assure you, it works like magic. People started joking that JS13K has now become JS15K. This kind of thing really makes me wonder what else will be possible in future years of the contest.</p>



<p>This was my first time using Efficient Compression Tool (ECT) to zip a project. After experimenting with various other options I found it to be the most efficient at both zipping files and compressing images. You’d be surprised how many extra bytes of cruft are in an average zip! For large files it probably doesn’t matter much but for small files like this it can make a huge difference.</p>



<h2>Areas for Improvement</h2>



<p>After submitting the game I already knew there were some things that could have been done better. In general my game was just very thin on content and lacked an overall sense of progression. There was no end to the game or even a proper beginning. While what I had was very fun, it was also super minimal and felt more like a tech demo then a complete game.</p>



<p>One of the biggest features I would have cut is 4 player cooperative gameplay and probably all gamepad support as well. While multiplayer can be a lot of fun, almost no one actually gave it a try which means all that code was just wasted space.</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="651" height="298" src="https://frankforce.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-1.png" alt="Space huggers 4 player mode" srcset="https://frankforce.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-1.png 651w, https://frankforce.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-1-300x137.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 651px) 100vw, 651px"></figure></div>


<p>I wanted to fit in a variety of weapons and upgrades for the player which would have added a lot of fun and variety to the gameplay. These could also have been used by enemies to create more diverse combat scenarios. I chose to cut this not only for space limitations but also because keeping things simple allowed me to polish everything before the deadline.</p>



<p>Unfortunately I was also not able to fit any music, things were just so tight. This is a huge missed opportunity to inject another layer of immersion and I definitely plan to have some kind of soundtrack in my next JS13K game!</p>



<h2>The Results</h2>



<p>Space Huggers did not win JS13K but it did pretty well, placing 8th out of 223 games in total. It also received 2nd place in fun and gameplay categories!</p>



<p><a href="https://medium.com/js13kgames/js13kgames-2021-winners-top-in-criteria-and-expert-picks-cf4a0544fd45">Additionally Space Huggers was picked by 2 experts as their favorite JS13K game!</a> Thanks so much Lee and Christer. Here’s what they had to say…</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“As someone who’s sunk hours into Broforce and loves retro games, Space Huggers checked all the boxes for me. Procedurally generated levels that I can play in my browser?!? SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!” – Lee Reilly</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
<p>“It is an impressive game engine AND an extremely fun game! Most things are one or the other.” – Christer Kaitila</p>

<h2>Newgrounds Enhanced Edition</h2>



<p>After JS13K I took some time to polish up the game a little more and <a href="https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/819609">released it on Newgrounds.</a> I also reworked the length of the game so it can beaten in around 10 minutes. Here are some of the new features I added to this enhanced version…</p>



<ul>
<li>Limited game to 5 levels with the final level being the smallest but most dense.</li>



<li>Final boss that can crash through walls and throws objects at the player.</li>



<li>Intro screen with a music track I composed using FL Studio.</li>



<li>Mobile support with a virtual on screen touch gamepad.</li>



<li>Medals and Scoreboard with the fastest times.</li>



<li>Many other small tweaks and improvements.</li>
</ul>



<p>I am proud to say that the game now has over 100K plays on Newgrounds and maintains a solid 4/5 score with over 600 votes! Also, there are 26 pages of comments from people that have reviewed the game. This feedback was a great way for me to continue improving gameplay while chasing down any remaining bugs.</p>



<p>I want to give a special shoutout to a few amazing players. The first is lewdev who was an early supporter of Space Huggers and is also one of the best players, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nomaLYOo9QA">holding the world record speedrun for a long while.</a> I’d also like to congratulate KyRzYg on Newgrounds for having the current fastest speed run at a lightning fast 7 minutes 29 seconds!</p>



<p>Also a big thank you to <a href="https://wowdotstudios.newgrounds.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WOWdotStudios</a> for sending me the first piece of fan art I’ve ever received, this super cool high resolution art of the player from Space Huggers. You might also recognize it as my profile image on Newgrounds!</p>

  <p><em>This article was originally published in

<p>Millions of Pixel phones have been shipped with remote maintenance software that makes them vulnerable to spyware – but only if the perpetrator has physical access to the device, enters the user's password and knows how to activate the normally invisible and inactive software, according to Google. Under these conditions, an attacker could also install any other software. The remote maintenance software is said to have been installed at Verizon's request since <a href="https://www.heise.de/news/Google-Pixel-und-Pixel-XL-Android-Smartphones-mit-AI-und-der-besten-Kamera-3340555.html?from-en=1">the Pixel phones were launched in 2017</a>. The US mobile operator used the program for a while to demonstrate Pixel phones in its sales outlets.</p>

  <!-- RSPEAK_START -->



<p>Whether Android phones other than Pixel are also affected is still unclear. Active exploitation is not known. The vulnerability was discovered by the "Endpoint Detection and Response" scanner (EDR) <a href="https://iverify.io/blog/iverify-discovers-android-vulnerability-impacting-millions-of-pixel-devices-around-the-world">von iVerify</a> on a customer's cell phone. iVerify, together with the affected customer Palantir and the security company Trail of Bits, was able to trace this back to a hidden Android software package. Even though the software is no longer used, it is still present in the images of Pixel smartphones, <a href="https://x.com/dguido/status/1824120241829355571" rel="external noopener" target="_blank">as Trail of Bits CEO Dan Guido notes on X.</a></p>

<p>In fact, firmware images for the Pixel devices can still be downloaded from Google's official servers, which contain the priv-app directory with the aforementioned Showcase.pkg in product.img, as heise online was able to verify using the <a href="https://dl.google.com/dl/android/aosp/akita-ud2a.231203.054-factory-b3a902d4.zip?hl=de" rel="external noopener" target="_blank">Android 14.0 image for the Pixel 8a</a>.</p>

  





<p>According to iVerify, once activated, the application downloads a configuration file via an insecure connection, which can result in system-level code being executed. The configuration file is retrieved from a domain hosted by AWS over unsecured HTTP, which leaves the configuration and the device vulnerable to malicious code, spyware and data wiping.</p>
<h3 id="nav_patch_not_yet__0">Patch not yet available</h3>
<p>The affected package is pre-installed in the firmware of Pixel devices. By default, the application is not active; however, as it is part of the firmware image, millions of phones could be running this app at system level. Users cannot uninstall Showcase.apk themselves. An update that removes the inactive software is in the works, according to Verizon, and will be made available to "all affected OEM manufacturers". This raises the suspicion that phones other than Pixel phones are also equipped with the insecure application.</p>



<p>According to media reports, Showcase.apk comes from Smith Micro, a company that provides software for remote access, parental control and data erasure. "This is neither an Android platform nor a Pixel vulnerability," <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2024/08/15/new-pixel-warning-as-pixel-9-pixel-9-pro-pixel-9-pro-fold-release/" rel="external noopener" target="_blank">Google told Forbes</a>. The app was developed for a demo function for stores of the US mobile phone provider Verizon, but is no longer in use. Both physical access to the device and the user's password are required to activate the app.</p>
<p>The function is no longer used by Verizon, nor by consumers, a company spokesperson told Forbes. Neither iVerify nor Verizon have found any evidence of the vulnerability being exploited. As a precautionary measure, the demo function will be removed from all devices.</p>
<p>The discovery of Showcase.apk and similar incidents show the need for greater transparency and discussion around third-party apps that are part of the operating system. Incidentally, the problem is not new - nor is it limited to Pixel smartphones: back in 2016, <a href="https://community.verizon.com/t5/Samsung/Note-5-and-Verizon-Store-Demo-Mode/m-p/992275#1454014" rel="external noopener" target="_blank">a person complained to Verizon</a> that a "Verizon store demo mode app" was on his Samsung Galaxy Note 5.</p>

<p>2400 years ago Aristotle found out how to be <strong>happy</strong>.</p>



<p>His <em>Nicomachean Ethics</em> is an operating manual for a <strong>good life</strong>:</p>



<h2><strong>What is good?</strong></h2>



<p>First of all, what makes a thing a <strong>good</strong> thing?&nbsp;A good thing <strong>fulfils</strong> its <strong>unique function</strong>.</p>



<p>A <strong>good knife</strong> is a knife that is good at <strong>cutting</strong>.</p>

<p>A <strong>good eye</strong> is an eye that is good at <strong>seeing</strong>.</p>

<p>Now, what makes a <strong>good human</strong>?&nbsp;To know what a human should be good at, we need to look at <strong>what is unique</strong> about humans: We have a <strong>soul</strong> that <strong>thinks</strong> and <strong>feels</strong>.</p>

<p>So for us to live a <strong>good life</strong> means to have an <strong>excellent soul</strong>. And this excellence reveals itself in a <strong>clear intellect</strong> and a <strong>noble character</strong>.</p>

<p>Let’s have a closer look at both and how we can achieve them:</p>



<h2><strong>1. The virtues of a clear intellect</strong></h2>



<p>Today, we often reduce all our mental abilities to “intelligence”. Aristotle went a bit deeper and identified multiple <strong>theoretical virtues</strong>:</p>



<p><strong>Art</strong> (techne) is the ability to <strong>make things</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Intelligence</strong> (nous) is&nbsp;<strong>intuitive insight </strong>into underlying truths of our world.</p>

<p><strong>Scientific knowledge</strong> (episteme) is our <strong>logical reasoning</strong> about the world.</p>

<p><strong>Prudence</strong> (phronesis) is our ability to make <strong>practical (moral) decisions</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Wisdom</strong> (sophia) is a comprehensive <strong>understanding of deeper truths</strong>.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="288" height="173" data-attachment-id="4593" data-permalink="https://ralphammer.com/aristotle-how-to-live-a-good-life/09_sophia/" data-orig-file="https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/09_Sophia.gif" data-orig-size="288,173" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="09_Sophia" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/09_Sophia.gif" data-large-file="https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/09_Sophia.gif" tabindex="0" role="button" src="https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/09_Sophia.gif" alt="Wisdom"></figure>



<p>These theoretical virtues help us understand what is <strong>true</strong> and <strong>possible</strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And as important as they are, for Aristotle something else is just as vital for a good life: <strong>our character</strong>.</p>



<h2><strong>2. The virtues of a noble character</strong></h2>



<p>A <strong>good character</strong> can <strong>handle emotions</strong> properly.</p>

<p>We do that by finding the <strong>right mean</strong> between <strong>two extremes</strong>:</p>



<p><strong>Courage</strong> is the right mean between cowardice and recklessness.</p>

<p><strong>Temperance</strong> is the right mean between gluttony and abstinence.</p>

<p>This right mean depends on the <strong>person</strong>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We cannot study rules for proper behaviour. Instead,<strong> we must train our character</strong> through <strong>habituation</strong> to find the right mean appropriate to the circumstances.</p>



<h2><strong>Action!</strong></h2>



<p>In a<strong> successful life</strong>, the human soul fulfils its purpose through <strong>virtuous actions</strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Are we born with those virtues?</p>



<p>No. Aristotle says that humans have a <strong>capacity</strong> to be good, but it is up to us to develop our character. This is best achieved through <strong>study</strong> and <strong>habit</strong>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Excellence is not something you are, but something you <strong>do</strong>!</p>



<h2><strong>A good life…</strong></h2>



<p>For Aristotle happiness is achieved through a lifetime of <strong>virtuous activity</strong> of the soul, involving both <strong>intellect</strong> and <strong>character</strong>.</p>

<p>So far so good, you might say—but isn’t happiness about <strong>feeling good</strong>?</p>



<h2><strong>… is a happy life</strong></h2>



<p>Aristotle does not deny that pleasure is fun. Money, fame and food are great and contribute to our happiness!</p>

<p>But these things are <strong>not</strong> essential to a good life.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One might even suffer greatly and still live a virtuous—that is: a good—life. When Aristotle speaks of a “happy” life, he means a <strong>fulfilled</strong> or <strong>flourishing</strong> life rather than a pleasurable one.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Such a virtuous life helps us find our place in the world. It is good simply because it suits our nature. Everything we do should ultimately serve the best we can be: a human soul with a clear intellect and a noble character.</p>

<p>Happiness is not a feeling of pleasure. <strong>Happiness is the pursuit of excellence</strong>.</p>

                    <h2 id="pyscript">Say Hello to PyScript 👋</h2>

                    <p><strong>PyScript</strong> is an <a href="https://github.com/pyscript/pyscript">open source</a> platform for <a href="https://python.org/" target="_blank">Python</a> in the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser" target="_blank">browser</a>.</p>

                    <p>PyScript brings together two of the most vibrant technical ecosystems on the
planet. If <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web" target="_blank">the web</a> and Python
had a baby, you'd get PyScript.</p>

                    <p>At the core of PyScript is a <em>philosophy of digital empowerment</em>. The web is
the world's most ubiquitous computing platform, mature and familiar to billions
of people. Python is one of the
<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-top-programming-languages-2023" target="_blank">world's most popular programming languages</a>.</p>
                    <p>With PyScript, <em>Python runs anywhere there's a
                    browser (<u>which is everywhere</u>)</em>.</p>

                    
                    <ul>
                      <li><strong>Easy</strong>: your apps run in the browser with no complicated installation
                        required.</li>
                      <li><strong>Expressive</strong>: create apps with a powerful, popular and easy to learn
                        language like Python.</li>
                      <li><strong>Scalable</strong>: no need for expensive infrastructure ~ your code runs in
                        your user's browser.</li>
                      <li><strong>Shareable</strong>: applications are just a URL on the web. That's it!</li>
                      <li><strong>Universal</strong>: your code runs anywhere a browser runs... which is
                        <em>everywhere</em>!</li>
                      <li><strong>Secure</strong>: PyScript runs in the world's most battle-tested computing
                        platform, the browser!</li>
                      <li><strong>Powerful</strong>: the best of the web and Python, together at last.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://ishadeed.com/article/css-grid-area/">https://ishadeed.com/article/css-grid-area/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41262691">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>CSS Grid support has been widely available since March 2017 in all major browsers. Yet, here we are in 2024, and I still see few people using the grid template areas feature.</p>
<p>It’s no surprise that many avoid template areas as making sense of the grid is challenging enough. In this interactive article, I aim to shed light on this feature and, hopefully, convince you to use it more often. Once you see the simplicity and power of template areas, you may reach for them much more frequently.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>In the following example, we have a grid layout with three columns.</p>
<pre><code is:raw=""><span>.page</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>display</span><span>:</span> grid<span>;</span>
  <span>grid-template-columns</span><span>:</span> 1fr 1fr 1fr<span>;</span>
  <span>gap</span><span>:</span> 1rem<span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>If I need to position child items within the grid, I need to specify the line number for each item by using <code>grid-column</code>.</p>
<pre><code is:raw=""><span>.item-1</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>grid-column</span><span>:</span> 1 / 3<span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>.item-2</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>grid-column</span><span>:</span> 3 / 4<span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Here is the result.</p>
<astro-island uid="g5GxF" prefix="r1" component-url="/_astro/Basic.CKihaAnq.js" component-export="default" renderer-url="/_astro/client.B2vAWYSt.js" props="{}" ssr="" client="visible" opts="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Basic$5&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:true}" await-children=""><!--astro:end--></astro-island>
<p>At first glance, it seems fine and works as expected. But have you thought about how I came up with the line numbers? I don’t always like to open the DevTools and turn on the line numbers so I can place the items where I need them.</p>
<p>The line numbers look something like this:</p>
<astro-island uid="ZSQifk" prefix="r2" component-url="/_astro/Basic.CKihaAnq.js" component-export="default" renderer-url="/_astro/client.B2vAWYSt.js" props="{&quot;lineNumbers&quot;:[0,true],&quot;itemsHidden&quot;:[0,true]}" ssr="" client="visible" opts="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Basic$5&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:true}" await-children=""><!--astro:end--></astro-island>
<p>You can’t see the line numbers until you inspect the element in the browser DevTools. Let’s take a quick quiz.</p>
<p>Consider the following CSS grid:</p>
<pre><code is:raw=""><span>.page</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>display</span><span>:</span> grid<span>;</span>
  <span>grid-template-columns</span><span>:</span> 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr<span>;</span>
  <span>gap</span><span>:</span> 1rem<span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Write the line numbers needed to place the <strong>second item in the last three columns</strong>.</p>
<p>⚠️ <strong>Don’t open the DevTools, guess it yourself.</strong></p>
<astro-island uid="Z1lCa6I" prefix="r3" component-url="/_astro/BasicQuiz.CFfQJB6l.js" component-export="default" renderer-url="/_astro/client.B2vAWYSt.js" props="{&quot;lineNumbers&quot;:[0,false],&quot;quiz&quot;:[0,true]}" ssr="" client="visible" opts="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Basic$4&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:true}" await-children=""><!--astro:end--></astro-island>
<p>If you guessed it from the first time, it’s great. However, for me, I sometimes miss the correct line number and have to open the DevTools to get it right.</p>
<p>See the below example with the line numbers activated.</p>
<astro-island uid="1YF90B" prefix="r4" component-url="/_astro/BasicQuiz.CFfQJB6l.js" component-export="default" renderer-url="/_astro/client.B2vAWYSt.js" props="{&quot;lineNumbers&quot;:[0,true],&quot;quiz&quot;:[0,true],&quot;controls&quot;:[0,true]}" ssr="" client="visible" opts="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Basic$4&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:true}" await-children=""><!--astro:end--></astro-island>
<p>Looking at the line numbers, it sounds easier, right? I agree too. This can become more challenging if we need to place both the columns and rows.</p>
<p>Let’s take it further.</p>
<p>In the following demo, we have a layout with 5 columns and 2 rows.</p>
<pre><code is:raw=""><span>.page</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>display</span><span>:</span> grid<span>;</span>
  <span>grid-template-columns</span><span>:</span> 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr<span>;</span>
  <span>grid-template-rows</span><span>:</span> 1fr 1fr<span>;</span>
  <span>gap</span><span>:</span> 1rem<span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Can you guess what’s the correct line numbers to place “Item 1” in the first three columns?</p>
<astro-island uid="Z9CIOx" prefix="r5" component-url="/_astro/BasicQuiz2.DaDDwMpV.js" component-export="default" renderer-url="/_astro/client.B2vAWYSt.js" props="{&quot;items&quot;:[0,&quot;item1&quot;],&quot;actions&quot;:[0,true],&quot;lineNumbers&quot;:[0,false]}" ssr="" client="visible" opts="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Basic$3&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:true}" await-children=""><!--astro:end--></astro-island>
<p>Cool, the next step is to position the second item in the last 3 columns. Try to guess the line numbers value.</p>
<astro-island uid="ZAinHB" prefix="r6" component-url="/_astro/BasicQuiz2.DaDDwMpV.js" component-export="default" renderer-url="/_astro/client.B2vAWYSt.js" props="{&quot;items&quot;:[0,&quot;all&quot;],&quot;actions&quot;:[0,true],&quot;lineNumbers&quot;:[0,true]}" ssr="" client="visible" opts="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Basic$3&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:true}" await-children=""><!--astro:end--></astro-island>
<p>Good work! For me, dealing with line numbers is possible only if the DevTools are active. Oftentimes, my brain is handling lots of details while building a layout and “imagining” the line numbers isn’t one of them.</p>
<h2 id="css-named-grid-areas">CSS named grid areas</h2>
<p>In CSS grid, we can name each grid area and reference it throughout the CSS. Let’s take the following basic example.</p>
<h3 id="example-1-basic-problem">Example 1: Basic problem</h3>
<p>We have a two-column grid. I used <code>grid-template-areas</code> to define an area for each item I have.</p>
<pre><code is:raw=""><span>.page</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>display</span><span>:</span> grid<span>;</span>
  <span>grid-template-columns</span><span>:</span> 1fr 1fr<span>;</span>
  <span>grid-template-areas</span><span>:</span> <span>"item1 item2"</span><span>;</span>
  <span>gap</span><span>:</span> 1rem<span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Then, I can map the names of each item, respectively:</p>
<pre><code is:raw=""><span>.item-1</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>grid-area</span><span>:</span> item1<span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>.item-2</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>grid-area</span><span>:</span> item2<span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>By using a <code>grid-area</code>, it’s like mapping each element in the grid to its designated area. In the following example, see how each column is mapped to a grid area name.</p>
<picture> <source srcset="https://ishadeed.com/_astro/grid-area-mapping.CzqJmd_C_Bpty8.webp" type="image/webp"> <img src="https://ishadeed.com/_astro/grid-area-mapping.CzqJmd_C_1Jp2ST.png" alt="" width="1152" height="826" loading="lazy" decoding="async"> </picture>
<p>Don’t worry if it’s still not clear, I will explain it in more detail in the following examples.</p>
<h3 id="example-2-card-layout">Example 2: Card layout</h3>
<p>In the following example, we have a grid of 3 columns.</p>
<pre><code is:raw=""><span>.wrapper</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>display</span><span>:</span> grid<span>;</span>
  <span>grid-template-columns</span><span>:</span> 1fr 1fr 1fr<span>;</span>
  <span>grid-template-areas</span><span>:</span> <span>"featured featured article"</span><span>;</span>
  <span>gap</span><span>:</span> 1rem<span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>I mapped the named grid lines in a way that gives:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 columns for the featured article</li>
<li>1 column for the normal article</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s suppose that we have a card component. We can place the card either in the “featured” or the “article” grid areas.</p>
<p>See the following demo and try to play with the toggles in the <code>grid-area</code>.</p>
<astro-island uid="15sMe" prefix="r7" component-url="/_astro/BasicQuiz3.Bmdsp7ve.js" component-export="default" renderer-url="/_astro/client.B2vAWYSt.js" props="{&quot;items&quot;:[0,&quot;all&quot;],&quot;actions&quot;:[0,true],&quot;lineNumbers&quot;:[0,true]}" ssr="" client="visible" opts="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Basic$2&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:true}" await-children=""><div><p><span>featured</span><span>article</span></p><div><p>Grid template areas</p><p>Ahmad Shadeed</p></div></div><!--astro:end--></astro-island>
<p>Notice how the card changes its position and size? We are changing the line numbers by using the named <code>grid-area</code> only.</p>
<p>In the following sections, I will explain the grid area syntax in detail and then walk you through different examples and use cases.</p>
<h2 id="grid-template-area-rules">Grid template area rules</h2>
<h3 id="the-defined-area-should-be-like-a-rectangle">The defined area should be like a rectangle</h3>
<p>A defined area must have a rectangle-like shape in the code.</p>
<pre><code is:raw=""><span>/* This is invalid */</span>
<span>.layout</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>grid-template-areas</span><span>:</span>
    <span>"header header"</span>
    <span>"sidebar main"</span>
    <span>"header footer"</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>/* This is valid */</span>
<span>.layout</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>grid-template-areas</span><span>:</span>
    <span>"header header"</span>
    <span>"sidebar main"</span>
    <span>"sidebar footer"</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>See the following figure:</p>

<h3 id="all-areas-must-be-defined">All areas must be defined</h3>
<p>When using <code>grid-template-areas</code>, all areas must be defined even if you won’t need them all.</p>
<pre><code is:raw=""><span>/* This is invalid */</span>
<span>.layout</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>grid-template-areas</span><span>:</span>
    <span>"header header"</span>
    <span>"sidebar main"</span>
    <span>"header"</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>/* This is valid */</span>
<span>.layout</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>grid-template-areas</span><span>:</span>
    <span>"header header"</span>
    <span>"sidebar main"</span>
    <span>"sidebar footer"</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<h2 id="grid-template-syntax">Grid template syntax</h2>
<p>To use CSS grid template areas, we need to define the grid areas via <code>grid-template-areas</code> property. The main things you need to know for now:</p>
<ul>
<li>It can take multiple area strings</li>
<li>One string means having a one-dimentional layout (column only)</li>
<li>Multiple area strings means having a multi-dimentional layout (column and rows)</li>
</ul>
<p>What I like about grid areas is that they provide us with a visualization of the grid in CSS.</p>
<h3 id="grid-area-syntax-example-1">Grid area syntax, example 1</h3>
<p>In this example, we have one-dimensional grid with two columns. The first one is fixed and the other is fluid to the available space.</p>
<pre><code is:raw=""><span>.element</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>display</span><span>:</span> grid<span>;</span>
  <span>grid-template-columns</span><span>:</span> 200px 1fr<span>;</span>
  <span>grid-template-areas</span><span>:</span> <span>"aside main"</span><span>;</span>
  <span>gap</span><span>:</span> <span>var</span><span>(</span>--gutter-1<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>See the following figure:</p>
<picture> <source srcset="https://ishadeed.com/_astro/grid-area-mapping-2.CSBgyYJV_Z2lfgb4.webp" type="image/webp"> <img src="https://ishadeed.com/_astro/grid-area-mapping-2.CSBgyYJV_1prVFl.png" alt="" width="1152" height="786" loading="lazy" decoding="async"> </picture>
<p>Once the template areas are defined, we can reference them in CSS and assign each named area to its designated element by using the <code>grid-area</code> property,</p>
<pre><code is:raw=""><span>.aside</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>grid-area</span><span>:</span> aside<span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>.main</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>grid-area</span><span>:</span> main<span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>The above is a basic example that lays the foundation for the article. Keep reading to discover why named areas are powerful in the following examples.</p>
<h3 id="grid-area-syntax-example-2">Grid area syntax, example 2</h3>
<p>Building on the previous example, I need to add a footer to the grid layout. What should we do?</p>
<p>We can add another area string to the <code>grid-template-areas</code>.</p>
<blockquote><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="32" height="33" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 32 33"><g><rect width="32" height="32" y="0.527" fill="#D9BAF7" rx="16"></rect><g stroke="#7D45A7" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="1.5"><path d="M16.25 9.527c-3.5 0-5.25 2.75-5.25 5.25 0 4 3 4.5 3 6v2.25a1 1 0 001 1h2.5a1 1 0 001-1v-2.25c0-1.5 3-2 3-6 0-2.5-1.75-5.25-5.25-5.25z"></path><path d="M14.25 21.527h4"></path></g></g></svg><p>When we define multiple area string values for grid template areas, implicit grid rows are created automatically.</p></blockquote>
<pre><code is:raw=""><span>.element</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>display</span><span>:</span> grid<span>;</span>
  <span>grid-template-columns</span><span>:</span> 200px 1fr<span>;</span>
  <span>grid-template-areas</span><span>:</span> <span>"aside main"</span> <span>"footer footer"</span><span>;</span>
  <span>gap</span><span>:</span> <span>var</span><span>(</span>--gutter-1<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Try to visualize the grid based on the defined areas above. Can you guess it?</p>
<astro-island uid="ZTCBXH" prefix="r8" component-url="/_astro/Syntax1.CyKtt4on.js" component-export="default" renderer-url="/_astro/client.B2vAWYSt.js" props="{&quot;items&quot;:[0,&quot;item1&quot;],&quot;actions&quot;:[0,true],&quot;lineNumbers&quot;:[0,true]}" ssr="" client="visible" opts="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Syntax1$1&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:true}" await-children=""><!--astro:end--></astro-island>
<p>When we add multiple area strings in <code>grid-template-areas</code>, it’s a good practice to stack them into multiple lines as it will help us to visualize them better.</p>
<pre><code is:raw=""><span>.element</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>/* other styles */</span>
  <span>grid-template-areas</span><span>:</span>
    <span>"aside main"</span>
    <span>"footer footer"</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Each area string represents a row in the grid. Imagine it like a table.</p>
<h3 id="grid-area-syntax-example-3">Grid area syntax, example 3</h3>
<p>We can change the layout by just changing the <code>grid-template-areas</code> for the main wrapper. The following CSS is constant, we just need to change the grid area string.</p>
<pre><code is:raw=""><span>.aside</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>grid-area</span><span>:</span> aside<span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>.main</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>grid-area</span><span>:</span> main<span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>.footer</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>grid-area</span><span>:</span> footer<span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>See the following demo and try to change the layout.</p>
<astro-island uid="2kfTeB" prefix="r9" component-url="/_astro/Syntax2.B5LNLt7D.js" component-export="default" renderer-url="/_astro/client.B2vAWYSt.js" props="{&quot;items&quot;:[0,&quot;item1&quot;],&quot;actions&quot;:[0,true],&quot;lineNumbers&quot;:[0,false]}" ssr="" client="visible" opts="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Syntax1&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:true}" await-children=""><div><pre><p><span>.page</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>grid-template-areas</span><span>:</span><span> </span></p><p><span>      </span><span>"aside main"</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>"footer footer"</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></pre></div><!--astro:end--></astro-island>
<p>By changing the <code>grid-template-areas</code> string, the whole layout updates automatically, using the same unique <code>grid-area</code> names (aside, main, footer). <strong>This centralizes layout control, making adjustments easy and efficient</strong>.</p>
<p>In the following example, we can change the UI elements layout by just updating the <code>grid-template-areas</code> string(s).</p>
<p>Try to change the dropdown value and see what happens. Notice how it looks like a mapping for the layout.</p>
<astro-island uid="1Jsk4B" prefix="r10" component-url="/_astro/Syntax3.4Ut3QkxP.js" component-export="default" renderer-url="/_astro/client.B2vAWYSt.js" props="{}" ssr="" client="visible" opts="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Syntax3$1&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:true}" await-children=""><div><div><p>grid-template-areas:</p><p><span>"aside main"</span><span>"footer "</span></p></div><svg width="70" height="16" viewBox="0 0 70 16" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M69.7071 8.7071C70.0976 8.31658 70.0976 7.68341 69.7071 7.29289L63.3431 0.928927C62.9526 0.538402 62.3195 0.538402 61.9289 0.928927C61.5384 1.31945 61.5384 1.95262 61.9289 2.34314L67.5858 7.99999L61.9289 13.6568C61.5384 14.0474 61.5384 14.6805 61.9289 15.0711C62.3195 15.4616 62.9526 15.4616 63.3431 15.0711L69.7071 8.7071ZM8.74228e-08 9L69 8.99999L69 6.99999L-8.74228e-08 7L8.74228e-08 9Z" fill="black"></path></svg></div><!--astro:end--></astro-island>
<h3 id="empty-grid-cells">Empty grid cells</h3>
<p>We can define an empty cell by adding <strong>one or multiple dots</strong>. For example:</p>
<pre><code is:raw=""><span>.element</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>/* other styles */</span>
  <span>grid-template-areas</span><span>:</span>
    <span>"aside main"</span>
    <span>"... footer"</span><span>;</span>

<h2 id="css-grid-named-grid-lines">CSS grid named grid lines</h2>
<h3 id="intro">Intro</h3>
<p>When I first learned about named grid lines, I saw things like the following:</p>

<pre><code is:raw=""><span>.layout</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>grid-template-columns</span><span>:</span>  [full-start] 1fr
                          [content-start] 2fr
                          [content-end] 1fr [full-end]<span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>

<p>I didn’t understand if the <code>*-start</code> or <code>*-end</code> were custom names by the author, or maybe the browser generated them. Generally speaking, this syntax is confusing but it is helpful in some use-cases. I will try to explain it clearly in this section.</p>
<p>In the following example, we have a grid with three columns.</p>
<pre><code is:raw=""><span>.layout</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>display</span><span>:</span> grid<span>;</span>
  <span>grid-template-columns</span><span>:</span> 1fr 2fr 1fr<span>;</span>
  <span>gap</span><span>:</span> 1rem<span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>In grid, the number of lines is equal to the columns plus one. If we have 3 columns, then we will have 4 grid lines.</p>
<p>See the following example:</p>
<astro-island uid="1Mw7C6" prefix="r12" component-url="/_astro/NamedLines.CyV1uxW7.js" component-export="default" renderer-url="/_astro/client.B2vAWYSt.js" props="{&quot;lineNumbers&quot;:[0,true],&quot;itemsHiddenFull&quot;:[0,true]}" ssr="" client="visible" opts="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;NamedLines$1&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:true}" await-children=""><!--astro:end--></astro-island>
<p>Say that we want to position an item from <strong>line 2 to line 3</strong>. We can do that:</p>
<pre><code is:raw=""><span>.item</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>grid-column</span><span>:</span> 2 / 3<span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<astro-island uid="Z1fjRYm" prefix="r13" component-url="/_astro/NamedLines.CyV1uxW7.js" component-export="default" renderer-url="/_astro/client.B2vAWYSt.js" props="{&quot;lineNumbers&quot;:[0,true],&quot;v1&quot;:[0,true]}" ssr="" client="visible" opts="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;NamedLines$1&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:true}" await-children=""><!--astro:end--></astro-island>
<p>With named grid lines, the idea is that <strong>we can name each grid line with a unique name</strong> instead of the default line numbers.</p>

<pre><code is:raw=""><span>.layout</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>/* Before */</span>
  <span>grid-template-columns</span><span>:</span>  1fr
                          2fr
                          1fr<span>;</span>

  <span>/* After */</span>
  <span>grid-template-columns</span><span>:</span>  [full-start] 1fr
                          [content-start] 2fr
                          [content-end] 1fr [full-end]<span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>

<astro-island uid="2rUT0D" prefix="r14" component-url="/_astro/NamedLines.CyV1uxW7.js" component-export="default" renderer-url="/_astro/client.B2vAWYSt.js" props="{&quot;lineNames&quot;:[0,true],&quot;itemsHiddenFull&quot;:[0,true]}" ssr="" client="visible" opts="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;NamedLines$1&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:true}" await-children=""><!--astro:end--></astro-island>

<p>Say that we want to position the item the same as we did in the previous demo, but with named grid lines.</p>
<pre><code is:raw=""><span>.item</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>grid-column</span><span>:</span> content-start / content-end<span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Sounds clearer, right?</p>
<astro-island uid="2uETbu" prefix="r15" component-url="/_astro/NamedLines.CyV1uxW7.js" component-export="default" renderer-url="/_astro/client.B2vAWYSt.js" props="{&quot;lineNames&quot;:[0,true],&quot;v2&quot;:[0,true]}" ssr="" client="visible" opts="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;NamedLines$1&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:true}" await-children=""><!--astro:end--></astro-island>
<p>Maybe we want to place it on one of the sides.</p>
<pre><code is:raw=""><span>.item</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>grid-column</span><span>:</span> full-start / content-end<span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>In the following demo, you can toggle the line numbers on and off. Try it yourself and see what happens.</p>
<astro-island uid="1EMr4k" prefix="r16" component-url="/_astro/NamedLines.CyV1uxW7.js" component-export="default" renderer-url="/_astro/client.B2vAWYSt.js" props="{&quot;lineNames&quot;:[0,true],&quot;v3&quot;:[0,true],&quot;switchLines&quot;:[0,true]}" ssr="" client="visible" opts="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;NamedLines$1&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:true}" await-children=""><!--astro:end--></astro-island>
<p>If it’s still not clear yet, don’t worry. I will explain the concept below in another way.</p>
<h3 id="grid-tracks">Grid tracks</h3>
<p>In CSS grid, we have a term called “track size”, which represents the size of the column or row. See the following example:</p>
<pre><code is:raw=""><span>.layout</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>display</span><span>:</span> grid<span>;</span>
  <span>grid-template-columns</span><span>:</span> 1fr 1fr<span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>The <code>1fr</code> and <code>1fr</code> are track sizes. <strong>With named grid lines, we care about naming the lines around those tracks</strong>.</p>
<blockquote><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="32" height="33" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 32 33"><g><rect width="32" height="32" y="0.527" fill="#D9BAF7" rx="16"></rect><g stroke="#7D45A7" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="1.5"><path d="M16.25 9.527c-3.5 0-5.25 2.75-5.25 5.25 0 4 3 4.5 3 6v2.25a1 1 0 001 1h2.5a1 1 0 001-1v-2.25c0-1.5 3-2 3-6 0-2.5-1.75-5.25-5.25-5.25z"></path><path d="M14.25 21.527h4"></path></g></g></svg><p>Remember that we are naming grid lines.</p></blockquote>
<p>See the following figure:</p>
<picture> <source srcset="https://ishadeed.com/_astro/named-grid-lines-tracks-1.BgbxLpfM_1cO1tG.png" type="image/png"> <img src="https://ishadeed.com/_astro/named-grid-lines-tracks-1.BgbxLpfM_1cO1tG.png" alt="" width="1152" height="758" loading="lazy" decoding="async"> </picture>
<p>Notice how the line numbers are around the tracks. We have two tracks, so we have three lines.</p>
<p>In this example, we have an aside and a main section.</p>

<pre><code is:raw=""><span>.layout</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>display</span><span>:</span> grid<span>;</span>
  <span>grid-template-columns</span><span>:</span>
          [aside-start] 200px [aside-end main-start] 1fr [main-end]<span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>

<p>See the following figure:</p>
<picture> <source srcset="https://ishadeed.com/_astro/named-grid-lines-tracks-2.CcBJqr7g_1fjc3j.png" type="image/png"> <img src="https://ishadeed.com/_astro/named-grid-lines-tracks-2.CcBJqr7g_1fjc3j.png" alt="" width="1152" height="758" loading="lazy" decoding="async"> </picture>
<p>The line name must be written before the track size. Notice that the values between the brackets can share multiple line names. In our example below, the line <code>aside-end</code> is the same as the <code>main-start</code>.</p>
<astro-island uid="Z1eVqms" prefix="r17" component-url="/_astro/NamedLines2.Cve_-f7R.js" component-export="default" renderer-url="/_astro/client.B2vAWYSt.js" props="{&quot;lineNames&quot;:[0,true]}" ssr="" client="visible" opts="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;NamedLines&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:true}" await-children=""><!--astro:end--></astro-island>
<p>What’s great about using named lines like this is that we can position the items like this:</p>
<pre><code is:raw=""><span>.aside</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>grid-column</span><span>:</span> aside-start / aside-end<span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>or this:</p>
<pre><code is:raw=""><span>.aside</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>grid-column</span><span>:</span> aside<span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>When defining the start and end of a line like <code>aside-start</code> and <code>aside-end</code>, this is called implicit line naming. The browser will take them and allow us to use the area (e.g: <code>grid-column: aside</code>);</p>
<p>Also, we can take this further and have two rows instead of one.</p>

<pre><code is:raw=""><span>.layout</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>display</span><span>:</span> grid<span>;</span>
  <span>grid-template-columns</span><span>:</span>
          [aside-start] 200px [aside-end main-start] 1fr [main-end]<span>;</span>
  <span>grid-template-rows</span><span>:</span>
          [aside-start main-start] auto [aside-end main-end footer-start]
          40px [footer-end]<span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>

<blockquote><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="32" height="33" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 32 33"><g><rect width="32" height="32" y="0.527" fill="#D9BAF7" rx="16"></rect><g stroke="#7D45A7" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="1.5"><path d="M16.25 9.527c-3.5 0-5.25 2.75-5.25 5.25 0 4 3 4.5 3 6v2.25a1 1 0 001 1h2.5a1 1 0 001-1v-2.25c0-1.5 3-2 3-6 0-2.5-1.75-5.25-5.25-5.25z"></path><path d="M14.25 21.527h4"></path></g></g></svg><p>Defining the *-start / *-end names for lines will generate an implicit grid areas.</p></blockquote>
<p>As a result, when using the custom indents (<code>[*-start]</code> or <code>[*-end]</code>), it’s the same as the following CSS:</p>

<pre><code is:raw=""><span>.layout</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>display</span><span>:</span> grid<span>;</span>
  <span>grid-template-columns</span><span>:</span> 200px 1fr<span>;</span>
  <span>grid-template-rows</span><span>:</span> auto 40px<span>;</span>
  <span>grid-template-areas</span><span>:</span> <span>"aside main"</span>
                      <span>"footer footer"</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>

<p>Using <code>grid-template-areas</code> is easier for me, but we might need to use line names in some use cases (I will show examples in the use cases section).</p>
<h3 id="named-grid-lines-are-optional">Named grid lines are optional</h3>
<p>It’s not mandatory to name all lines. We can name only the lines we care about the most in our layout.</p>
<p>In this example, I named only the lines for the second column.</p>

<pre><code is:raw=""><span>.layout</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>grid-template-columns</span><span>:</span>  1fr
                          [content-start] 2fr
                          [content-end] 1fr<span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>

<p>Here is an example that shows it in action:</p>
<astro-island uid="Zwln7c" prefix="r18" component-url="/_astro/NamedLines.CyV1uxW7.js" component-export="default" renderer-url="/_astro/client.B2vAWYSt.js" props="{&quot;lineNames&quot;:[0,true],&quot;v2&quot;:[0,true],&quot;switchLines&quot;:[0,true],&quot;optionalLines&quot;:[0,true]}" ssr="" client="visible" opts="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;NamedLines$1&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:true}" await-children=""><div><p>The dimmed line numbers are named.</p></div><!--astro:end--></astro-island>
<h3 id="mixing-line-numbers-and-names">Mixing line numbers and names</h3>
<p>We can mix line numbers and names when placing a grid item. In the following example, I placed the item from line 1 to the line “content-end”.</p>
<pre><code is:raw=""><span>.item</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>grid-column</span><span>:</span> 1 / content-end<span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>See it in action:</p>
<astro-island uid="1yQ42X" prefix="r19" component-url="/_astro/NamedLines.CyV1uxW7.js" component-export="default" renderer-url="/_astro/client.B2vAWYSt.js" props="{&quot;lineNames&quot;:[0,true],&quot;v4&quot;:[0,true],&quot;switchLines&quot;:[0,true],&quot;optionalLines&quot;:[0,true]}" ssr="" client="visible" opts="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;NamedLines$1&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:true}" await-children=""><div><p>The dimmed line numbers are named.</p></div><!--astro:end--></astro-island>
<p>I like this flexibility in CSS grid. Being able to choose whatever the solution or way of working that suits you is a blessing.</p>
<h2 id="use-cases-for-grid-template-areas">Use cases for grid template areas</h2>
<h3 id="reversing-grid-direction">Reversing Grid Direction</h3>
<p>Say that we have a card component and we want to flip the direction of the layout. In flexbox, this is fairly easy as we just need to use <code>flex-direction: row-reverse</code>.</p>
<p>In CSS grid, we need to change each item’s placement in the grid.</p>
<p>Consider the following example.</p>
<pre><code is:raw=""><span>.card</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>--cols</span><span>:</span> 150px 1fr<span>;</span>
  <span>display</span><span>:</span> grid<span>;</span>
  <span>grid-template-columns</span><span>:</span> <span>var</span><span>(</span>--cols<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>.card__thumb</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>grid-column</span><span>:</span> 1 / 2<span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>.card__content</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>grid-column</span><span>:</span> 2 / 3<span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>It looks like this:</p>
<astro-island uid="1KjY9l" prefix="r20" component-url="/_astro/FlipCard.DA1KbYIv.js" component-export="default" renderer-url="/_astro/client.B2vAWYSt.js" props="{}" ssr="" client="visible" opts="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;FlipCard$1&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:true}" await-children=""><div><p><img src="https://ishadeed.com/assets/grid-named-areas/shawarma.jpg" alt=""></p><div><h3>Wandering in nature. Life is cool</h3><p>A bit of desc</p></div></div><!--astro:end--></astro-island>
<p>If we want to flip the layout, we will need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Change the columns definition.</li>
<li>Change the <code>grid-column</code> for each child element.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code is:raw=""><span>.card--flip</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>--cols</span><span>:</span> 1fr 150px<span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>.card__thumb</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>grid-column</span><span>:</span> 2 / 3<span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>.card__content</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>grid-column</span><span>:</span> 1 / 2<span>;</span>
  <span>grid-row</span><span>:</span> 1<span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>And here is the result:</p>
<div><p><img src="https://ishadeed.com/assets/grid-named-areas/shawarma.jpg" alt=""></p><div><h3>Wandering in nature. Life is cool</h3><p>A bit of desc</p></div></div>
<p>We can do better with by using named grid areas. In the current solution, we have to change the <code>grid-column</code> start and end numbers for each child item.</p>
<pre><code is:raw=""><span>.card</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>display</span><span>:</span> grid<span>;</span>
  <span>grid-template-columns</span><span>:</span> 150px 1fr<span>;</span>
  <span>grid-template-areas</span><span>:</span> <span>"thumb content"</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>.card__thumb</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>grid-area</span><span>:</span> thumb<span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>.card__content</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>grid-area</span><span>:</span> content<span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>To flip the layout, all we need to do is:</p>
<pre><code is:raw=""><span>.card--flip</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>grid-template-columns</span><span>:</span> 1fr 150px<span>;</span>
  <span>grid-template-areas</span><span>:</span> <span>"content thumb"</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p><strong>We don’t have to think about the line numbers</strong>. This is an easier naming for the web designer who is building the layout.</p>
<p>Try the following demo:</p>
<astro-island uid="Z1lHivo" prefix="r22" component-url="/_astro/FlipCard.DA1KbYIv.js" component-export="default" renderer-url="/_astro/client.B2vAWYSt.js" props="{&quot;gridArea&quot;:[0,true]}" ssr="" client="visible" opts="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;FlipCard$1&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:true}" await-children=""><div><div><p><img src="https://ishadeed.com/assets/grid-named-areas/shawarma.jpg" alt=""></p><div><h3>Wandering in nature.

<p>We only change the columns and named areas order. Which is easier to edit, using named areas or line numbers?</p>
<p>Even better, we can use the <code>grid-template</code> shorthand property, too.</p>
<pre><code is:raw=""><span>.card--flip</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>grid-template</span><span>:</span> <span>"content image"</span> / 1fr 150px<span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>It’s up to you on using the shorthand or not, but I prefer the longhand version as it’s more clear to scan.</p>

<p>In a header layout, we can use grid areas to define the layout.</p>
<p>In the following design,</p>
<picture> <source srcset="https://ishadeed.com/_astro/header-layout-1.C0A_BFo3_Z1MpCvQ.webp" type="image/webp"> <img src="https://ishadeed.com/_astro/header-layout-1.C0A_BFo3_Z7lbPE.png" alt="" width="1152" height="580" loading="lazy" decoding="async"> </picture>
<p>In CSS, I created a grid with three equal-size columns.</p>
<pre><code is:raw=""><span>.header</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>display</span><span>:</span> grid<span>;</span>
  <span>grid-template-columns</span><span>:</span> 1fr 1fr 1fr<span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>If we want to place them using line numbers, it will be like this:</p>
<pre><code is:raw=""><span>.logo</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>grid-column</span><span>:</span> 1 / 2<span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>.nav</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>grid-column</span><span>:</span> 2 / 3<span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>.actions</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>grid-column</span><span>:</span> 3 / 4<span>;</span>

<p>This works fine. Can we explore how to make it responsive by just using grid areas? First, I need to define each grid area for the child items.</p>

<p>Cool, right?</p>
<h3 id="editorial-layout-example-1">Editorial layout: example 1</h3>
<p>In this example, we have a layout that contains different types of content like a title, text, and an image.</p>
<p>By using CSS grid and <code>grid-areas</code> we can easily define the layout and change it across different viewport sizes.</p>
<p>In this variation, I defined the columns and rows by just using <code>grid-template-areas</code> and the browser will do the rest.</p>
<pre><code is:raw=""><span>.section</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>gap</span><span>:</span> 1rem<span>;</span>

<p>Notice how the “dot” represents an empty space on the left side of the title. That “dot” is called a <strong>null cell token</strong> and is part of the CSS grid spec.</p>

<p>In this example, I took a look at time.com and found out that they are using CSS grid areas to handle the section layout. I will try to explain it in this section with a few modifications.</p>

<p>To focus on the main layout implementation, the following demos will only include the main layout and I won’t explain about coding the inner components as they are out of the scope of the article.</p>
<p>A few things to keep an eye on:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is an empty column on the start and end of the grid, mainly to work as a gap on both sides.</li>
<li>Not sure of the usage of <code>minmax()</code> for both the column and rows. The layout switches to the mobile design very early but I’ll keep them for now.</li>
<li>There is no need for <code>grid-template-rows</code> as we can define them in the grid areas definition.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s build the grid skeleton with grid areas!</p>

<h3 id="threads-app-post">Threads app post</h3>
<p>While reviewing how the CSS is written on <a href="https://ishadeed.com/article/threads-app-css/">Threads app by Meta</a>, I noticed an interesting use of CSS grid.</p>

<p>To place a grid item, the team used line numbers. Here is an example:</p>
<pre><code is:raw=""><span>.postBody</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>grid-column-start</span><span>:</span> 2<span>;</span>
  <span>grid-row-start</span><span>:</span> 2<span>;</span>
  <span>grid-row-end</span><span>:</span> span 3<span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>The post component has multiple variations. We can use <code>grid-template-areas</code> to define each one. For me, this is easier.</p>
<p>Here is how to do it in CSS:</p>
<pre><code is:raw=""><span>.post</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>/* Other styles */</span>
  <span>grid-template-areas</span><span>:</span>
    <span>"avatar header"</span>

    <span>". body"</span>
    <span>". footer"</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>.post--reply</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>grid-template-rows</span><span>:</span> 40px max-content max-content<span>;</span>
  <span>grid-template-areas</span><span>:</span>
    <span>"avatar header"</span>
    <span>"body body"</span>
    <span>"body body"</span>
    <span>"footer footer"</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>.post--nested</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>grid-template-areas</span><span>:</span>
    <span>"avatar header"</span>
    <span>"avatar body"</span>
    <span>"line body"</span>
    <span>"footer footer"</span><span>;</span>

<h3 id="overlapping-items-with-grid-areas">Overlapping items with grid areas</h3>
<p>When using <code>grid-template-areas</code>, we can place items in rectangular shapes. Consider the following example:</p>
<pre><code is:raw=""><span>.layout</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>display</span><span>:</span> grid<span>;</span>
  <span>grid-template-columns</span><span>:</span> 1fr 1fr fr<span>;</span>
  <span>grid-template-areas</span><span>:</span>
    <span>"card tag tag"</span>
    <span>"title title card"</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>In the example, I used <code>card</code> two times. <strong>This is invalid</strong> and will break the grid. The value must be similar to a rectangular shape.</p>
<p>Here is a visual that shows what I mean by a <strong>rectangular shape</strong>.</p>
<picture> <source srcset="https://ishadeed.com/_astro/grid-areas-shape.DKYasFas_162HQ7.webp" type="image/webp"> <img src="https://ishadeed.com/_astro/grid-areas-shape.DKYasFas_27iOAR.png" alt="" width="1152" height="784" loading="lazy" decoding="async"> </picture>
<p>What to do then? Well, we can define a new area name and use it to place both the column and row for the item we need.</p>
<p>See the following example where we have a card component.</p>

<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre>
<p>We can stack the title and the tag over the image by using <code>grid-template-areas</code> as in the following example.</p>
<pre><code is:raw=""><span>.card</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>display</span><span>:</span> grid<span>;</span>
  <span>grid-template-columns</span><span>:</span> auto auto 1fr<span>;</span>
  <span>grid-template-rows</span><span>:</span> auto auto<span>;</span>
  <span>grid-template-areas</span><span>:</span>
    <span>"thumb-1 tag"</span>
    <span>"title thumb-2"</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Notice how I defined <code>thumb-1</code> and <code>thumb-2</code>. I can use them with <code>grid-area</code>.</p>
<pre><code is:raw=""><span>.thumb</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>grid-column</span><span>:</span> thumb-1 / thumb-2<span>;</span>
  <span>grid-row</span><span>:</span> thumb-1 / thumb-2<span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>And I placed both the title and tag in their areas plus made sure they were aligned correctly.</p>
<pre><code is:raw=""><span>.tag</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>grid-area</span><span>:</span> tag<span>;</span>
  <span>align-self</span><span>:</span> start<span>;</span>
  <span>justify-self</span><span>:</span> end<span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>.title</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>grid-area</span><span>:</span> title<span>;</span>
  <span>align-self</span><span>:</span> end<span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Please keep in mind that you will need to manage the stacking order of the child items (if needed). In my case, I didn’t need that as the source order already solved it for me.</p>
<p>Here is the final demo:</p>
<astro-island uid="Z1sMX8x" prefix="r37" component-url="/_astro/Overlapping.BBBEvm0a.js" component-export="default" renderer-url="/_astro/client.B2vAWYSt.js" props="{&quot;overlap&quot;:[0,true]}" ssr="" client="visible" opts="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;ArticleLayout2&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:true}" await-children=""><div><p><img src="https://ishadeed.com/assets/grid-named-areas/bread.jpg" alt=""></p><p><span>Baking</span></p><p><span>Thyme Bread with Cheese and Olives</span></p></div><!--astro:end--></astro-island>
<p>The previous examples were inspired by <a href="https://www.oddbird.net/workshops/cascading-layouts/">Oddbird’s Cascading Layouts</a> page.</p>
<h2 id="conditional-layouts-with-css-has">Conditional layouts with CSS :has()</h2>
<p>We can take grid areas to the next level by combining it with CSS <code>:has()</code> selector. For example, we can change a layout based on the presence of an element.</p>
<p>In this example, I’m changing the layout of a <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code> element based on having a figcaption or not.</p>
<p>Here is the basic CSS:</p>
<pre><code is:raw=""><span>figure</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>display</span><span>:</span> grid<span>;</span>
  <span>grid-template-columns</span><span>:</span> 1fr 1fr 1fr<span>;</span>
  <span>grid-template-areas</span><span>:</span> <span>"img img img"</span><span>;</span>
  <span>gap</span><span>:</span> 0.5rem<span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>img</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>grid-area</span><span>:</span> img<span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>figcaption</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>grid-area</span><span>:</span> caption<span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<astro-island uid="r3imf" prefix="r38" component-url="/_astro/Conditional.D_NQx__K.js" component-export="default" renderer-url="/_astro/client.B2vAWYSt.js" props="{&quot;gridArea&quot;:[0,true]}" ssr="" client="visible" opts="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Conditional&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:true}" await-children=""><div><div><p>Thyme Bread with Cheese and Olives</p><p>Learn how to make this awesome home made bread with just a few steps.

<p>Do you want to learn more? I <a href="https://ishadeed.com/article/css-has-guide/">wrote a complete interactive guide on CSS :has</a>. Also, you can check my <a href="https://ishadeed.com/article/conditional-css-has-nth-last-child/">Conditional CSS with :has and :nth-last-child</a> article.</p>
<h2 id="multilingual-support-ltrrtl">Multilingual support (LTR/RTL)</h2>
<p>It’s worth mentioning that CSS Grid will adjust the layout based on the page direction (LTR or RTL). This means the named grid areas will also follow the page direction.</p>
<p>Toggle the “RTL” checkbox in the demo to see how the layout will flip.</p>
<astro-island uid="WBtiy" prefix="r39" component-url="/_astro/Syntax4.boyQkRFb.js" component-export="default" renderer-url="/_astro/client.B2vAWYSt.js" props="{}" ssr="" client="visible" opts="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Syntax3&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:true}" await-children=""><!--astro:end--></astro-island>
<p>To learn more about writing CSS for RTL layouts, I <a href="https://rtlstyling.com/posts/rtl-styling">wrote a complete guide</a> on that topic called RTL Styling 101.</p>

<p>All the major browsers have good tooling for grid areas (Chrome, Safari, and Firefox). Here is a preview of each browser:</p>
<h3 id="chrome">Chrome</h3>
<ul>
<li>I don’t particularly appreciate that it places the area name at the top left corner. It makes areas overlap.</li>
<li>Not sure about the color overlay. It changed how my design looks like.</li>
</ul>
<picture> <source srcset="https://ishadeed.com/_astro/devtools-chrome.CFnyGMhy_ZTYIMa.webp" type="image/webp"> <img src="https://ishadeed.com/_astro/devtools-chrome.CFnyGMhy_K4GS2.png" alt="" width="1510" height="886" loading="lazy" decoding="async"> </picture>
<h3 id="safari">Safari</h3>
<ul>
<li>The pink outlines help to outline the items clearly.</li>
<li>I like how Safari allows us to see the line names.</li>
</ul>
<picture> <source srcset="https://ishadeed.com/_astro/devtools-safari.aJEvlZm7_LCDwy.webp" type="image/webp"> <img src="https://ishadeed.com/_astro/devtools-safari.aJEvlZm7_2rH5cK.png" alt="" width="1518" height="828" loading="lazy" decoding="async"> </picture>
<p>Here is how Safari shows the line names.</p>
<picture> <source srcset="https://ishadeed.com/_astro/safari-line-names.58Jkc5Rv_14P1Lm.webp" type="image/webp"> <img src="https://ishadeed.com/_astro/safari-line-names.58Jkc5Rv_2cOA78.png" alt="" width="2236" height="744" loading="lazy" decoding="async"> </picture>
<p>While this is useful, the layout might need some enhancements (e.g.: stack the lines instead of showing them next to each other).</p>
<h3 id="firefox">Firefox</h3>
<ul>
<li>The area names are clearer than Chrome and Safari.</li>
<li>I like that it provides an autocomplete list when typing an area name with the custom indents (<code>*-start</code> or <code>*-end</code>).</li>
</ul>
<picture> <source srcset="https://ishadeed.com/_astro/devtools-firefox.ByluX823_1Doedi.webp" type="image/webp"> <img src="https://ishadeed.com/_astro/devtools-firefox.ByluX823_Z2pwMPS.png" alt="" width="1528" height="862" loading="lazy" decoding="async"> </picture>
<p>When editing the <code>grid-area</code> for a child item, Firefox provides a list of all the possible line names.</p>
<picture> <source srcset="https://ishadeed.com/_astro/firefox-hints.D5xlHt5Y_1pCnqC.webp" type="image/webp"> <img src="https://ishadeed.com/_astro/firefox-hints.D5xlHt5Y_PxDt0.png" alt="" width="1275" height="786" loading="lazy" decoding="async"> </picture>
<p>This is great feature that I appreciate in Firefox.</p>
<h2 id="outro">Outro</h2>
<p>Using grid areas is a great way to have a visual of the grid layout in CSS. I can see it helpful for team members who might need to change a layout. I hope that this article was useful to you.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text"><p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/tpecholt/imrad/actions/workflows/cmake.yml/badge.svg"><img src="https://github.com/tpecholt/imrad/actions/workflows/cmake.yml/badge.svg" alt="img"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">ImRAD</h2><a id="user-content-imrad" aria-label="Permalink: ImRAD" href="#imrad"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">ImRAD is a GUI builder for the ImGui library. It generates and parses C++ code which can be directly used in your application.</p>
<p dir="auto">ImRAD runs on Windows, Linux and MacOS.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Features</h2><a id="user-content-features" aria-label="Permalink: Features" href="#features"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">ImRAD is under active development but these are the main features:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">supports designing all kinds of windows</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Floating windows, popups and modal popups. These are ImGui backend independent</li>
<li>MainWindow with GLFW integration. ImRAD generates GLFW calls which will synchronize ImGui window with its OS window (title bar, resizability flags, autosize etc.)</li>
<li>Activity. This is a undecorated window which fills the entire viewport area. Only one activity can be shown at the time. Used mainly for Android apps</li>
<li>contains a GLFW template for generating generic <code>main.cpp</code></li>
<li>contains an android template for generating generic <code>MainActivity.java</code>+<code>manifest</code>+<code>main.cpp</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">supports wide range of widgets</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>basic widgets like <code>Text</code>, <code>Checkbox</code>, <code>Combo</code>, <code>Button</code>, <code>Slider</code>, <code>ColorEdit</code> etc.</li>
<li>container widgets like <code>Child</code>, <code>Table</code>, <code>CollapsingHeader</code>, <code>TreeNode</code>, <code>TabBar</code>,</li>
<li>more exotic widgets such as <code>Splitter</code></li>
<li><code>MenuBar</code> and context menu editing</li>
<li><code>CustomWidget</code> (a placeholder to user code)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">generates layout using <code>SameLine</code>/<code>Spacing</code>/<code>NextColumn</code> instead of absolute positioning</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>this ensures widgets respect item spacing and frame padding in a consistent way</li>
<li>there is a clear relationship between parent - child widget as well as children ordering which is important for container widgets like Table</li>
<li>overlay widgets can be placed on top using relative position to the nearest window corner</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">supports box layout</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>powerful and simple to use layout mechanism implemented on top of ImGui functionality</li>
<li>stretch any sizeable widget in horizontal or vertical direction</li>
<li>insert spacers to achieve alignment</li>
<li>alternatively you can use Table Layout Helper to generate horizontal layout using invisible Table</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">supports property binding</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>class variables can be managed through simple class wizard or from binding dialog</li>
<li>property binding is important because ImGui is immediate mode GUI library so widget states like input text or combobox items must be set at the time of drawing from within the generated code.</li>
<li>using property binding generated UI becomes dynamic and yet it can still be designed at the same time</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">supports generating event handlers and other support code</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>for example modal dialog will generate <code>OpenPopup</code> member function with a lambda callback called when dialog is closed</li>
<li>event handlers allow event handling user code to be separated from the generated part so the designer still works</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">generated code is delimited by comment markers and user is free to add additional code around and continue to use ImRAD at the same time</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>this can be used to call dependent popup Draw calls or to calculate some variables</li>
<li>it is also possible to use <code>CustomWidget</code> which will just call to a user code callback</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">target window style is fully configurable</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>apart from default styles provided by ImGui user can define new style and save it as an INI file under the <code>style</code> folder. Colors, style variables and used fonts can all be configured.</li>
<li>ImRAD will follow style settings when designing your UI</li>
<li>stored style can be loaded in your app by using simple <code>imrad.h</code> function</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">generated code is ready to use in your project and depends only on ImGui library and one accompanying header file (imrad.h)</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>some features such as MainWindow or Image widget require GLFW dependency. Compile your code with <code>IMRAD_WITH_GLFW</code> to activate it</li>
<li>currently Image widget requires stb library as well. Compile your code with <code>IMRAD_WITH_STB</code> or supply your own <code>LoadTextureFromFile()</code></li>
<li>optional support for the popular <code>fmt</code> library can be activated by defining <code>IMRAD_WITH_FMT</code>. This will allow you to use formating flags throughout all string properties</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">ImRAD tracks changes to the opened files so files can be designed in ImRAD and edited in your IDE of choice at the same time</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>maybe the auto-save feature would be useful to have</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
