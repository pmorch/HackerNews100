  <p>“The Netherlands hosts some of the world’s largest internet exchanges. This obliges us to make the best use of these exchanges for our national security. With the Temporary Cyber Act, we will make optimum use of the data carried on our cables to protect The Netherlands against Russian and Chinese hackers” – <a href="https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/actueel/nieuws/2024/03/12/inlichtingendiensten-kunnen-sneller-en-beter-optreden-tegen-cyberdreiging">Dutch government announcement</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I wrote this earlier, but did not publish it then because I wasn’t happy with the post. However, since <a href="https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/actueel/nieuws/2024/03/12/inlichtingendiensten-kunnen-sneller-en-beter-optreden-tegen-cyberdreiging">the new Dutch Intelligence and Security act just passed</a>, it is relevant for an international audience. Earlier, I wrote a piece for <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/dutch-intel-law-about-intel/">about:intel</a>, and in there you can find further discussion in English.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Of specific note, this law vastly expands when the Dutch agencies can perform SIGINT on Dutch Internet Exchanges like the Amsterdam Internet Exchange. These powers extend to any form of communication, including private peering and Private Network Interconnects (PNI). Every cable must be made available for ’exploration’, and it is likely that due to the wording in the new law, any request for such examination will be granted by the commission that rules on these things. Such exploration includes the right to send data to foreign intelligence agencies, including non-European ones.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Secondly, the law also makes it clear that requests for full intercepts should now mostly be judged on technical terms (‘is the request complete’) and with much less emphasis of the merits of full SIGINT. But do read on for the details.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Today, the upper house of Dutch parliament passed a law to reduce (I think) the oversight on the Dutch intelligence and security services, while simultaneously granting them more leeway to execute their powers. <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/resignation-as-intelligence-regulator/">In 2022, I resigned as regulator of the Dutch intelligence and security services because of this attempt</a>. Politico.eu wrote <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/intelligence-watchdog-bert-hubert-netherlands-hacking-cyber-law/">a comprehensive article</a> about it, representing various points of view.</p>
<p>In this page I will try to explain how the new law works and what these changes mean. I also provide some context from the European Court of Human Rights<!-- and the EU Court of Justice-->. This page refers to the just passed version of the proposed legislation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is also a <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/uitleg-over-de-wiv-2/">far longer page in Dutch</a>. This post is an attempt to summarise the changes for an international audience.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="applicability">Applicability</h2>
<p>The Dutch Law on Intelligence and Security Services defines a broad set of powers. It is also a somewhat odd law with a long history.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An English translation of a 2016 draft of the law <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/growth/tools-databases/tris/index.cfm/en/search/?trisaction=search.detail&amp;year=2016&amp;num=188&amp;dLang=EN">can be found on the European Commission website</a>. Note that this is a draft and it definitely differs from <a href="https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0039896">the law that is in force (Dutch)</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A remarkable aspect of the law is that it is universally applicable - it extends as much powers to spy on Dutch people as those from other countries. There are no general protections for people from or in The Netherlands or in the EU. This stands in stark contrast to US legislation which provides some privacy protection to ‘US Persons’, but to no one else.</p>
<p>In addition, the powers can be used around the world - Dutch agencies are free to hack computers anywhere, or to intercept communications anywhere.</p>
<h2 id="interests">Interests</h2>
<p>The services can investigate anything or anyone that gives rise to the suspicion that their activities or goals might be harmful for the survival of the system of democratic rule of law, for security or other important interests of the state. In addition, the services can investigate other countries.</p>
<h2 id="powers">Powers</h2>
<p>The powers granted to the services are broad, but also largely ‘read-only’. The services do not operate drones (unlike the CIA), and they have limited powers to intervene or disturb things, with one exception.</p>
<ul>
<li>Article 40: Observing and following people and objects</li>
<li>Article 41: Operate &amp; instruct agents, who are allowed to break other laws under specific conditions</li>
<li>Article 42: Enter &amp; investigate closed objects and premises</li>
<li>Article 43: Collect, store and match DNA data from people</li>
<li>Article 44: Intercept and investigate physical post and packages</li>
<li>Article 45: Hack ‘automated works’, computers in the very broadest sense of the word</li>
<li>Article 47: Intercept any form of (tele)communications from a specific person, organization of technical identifier</li>
<li>Article 48: Intercept &amp; record whole cables</li>
<li>Article 49: Investigate data recorded under article 48 to find targets or technical identifiers</li>
<li>Article 50: Select part of the data recorded under article 48 for use in intelligence/security investigations</li>
<li>Article 54: Requisitioning data</li>
<li>Article 60: Perform automated analysis and “machine learning” on all data, including 48 data</li>
<li>Article 73: “Undertake measures to protect interests of the services”</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="subjects-of-these-powers">Subjects of these powers</h2>
<p>The law is somewhat unique that all these powers are only tied to the <em>interests</em> the services protect, and not to specific people. So unlike police forces, the services can spy not only on direct targets of investigation, they can also eavesdrop ’non-targets’ (who might know interesting things about targets) or even hack ’third parties’ that could function as a stepping stone to useful information.</p>
<p>Before the services can use their investigatory powers on non-targets or third parties, they do have to explain why this is the only way for an investigation to proceed.</p>
<h2 id="oversight-warrant-process">Oversight, warrant process</h2>
<p>For all of the powers, there must be internal sign-off. Depending on the nature, this sign-off can be mandated to lower ranking employees. The most infringing powers however need to be approved by the relevant minister. Then, the <a href="https://tib-ivd.nl/">ex-ante regulator</a> rules if this permission was obtained lawfully. The minister takes the political decision, the ex-ante regulator verifies this decision. The opinion of the ex-ante regulator is binding.</p>
<p>In addition, there is <a href="https://ctivd.nl/">a non-binding ex-post regulator</a>.</p>
<h2 id="administrative-warrant-extensions">Administrative warrant extensions</h2>
<p>The powers are available for use on people or organizations. If someone turns out to have an additional phone number, or starts using a different phone number, a warrant can administratively be updated with this new information. No new permission process is required. In addition, if a warrant was written to target an organization, if this organization was described well, newly discovered members of the organization can also be added to a warrant administratively.</p>
<p>Crucially, such administrative extensions can not be used to add non-targets or third parties - these can not have been a member of a well described organization.</p>
<h2 id="sigint">SIGINT</h2>
<p>The SIGINT or bulk interception powers are complicated. The intelligence and security law considers that the copying, collecting and storing of data is a lesser infringement than actually looking at the data. This is in line with recent European Court of Human Rights precedents. The infringement of privacy increases at every step of the intelligence process, from collection to storing to selecting relevant communications to exploiting such communications for intelligence/security purposes. Crucially however, merely intercepting and storing data is already an infringement that needs a justification.</p>
<p>Article 48 provides for the collection powers. Services need to describe why a specific cable is interesting, and what they expect to achieve with that data. They must also use a well-targeted cable, one that is expected to best provide the data the services are interested in. There are also some restrictions on traffic with origin and destination in The Netherlands.</p>
<p>Article 49 enables technical analysis of this data to see if it includes interesting targets or subjects. Article 50 meanwhile allows for the selection of communications for dissemination to intelligence teams.</p>
<p>Finally, with specific permission, article 60 allows for the algorithmic analysis of all data intercepted under article 48. It was not found possible to properly limit what “algorithmic analysis” might be, so this was left to the ex-ante regulator to determine. In an adversarial reading, “finding all email from a specific person” might be dressed up as an algorithmic analysis. This means article 60 could be an alternative to article 50, and thus it needs the same level of regulatory scrutiny.</p>
<h2 id="proposed-changes">Proposed changes</h2>
<p>In the proposed additional ‘cyber law’, several things would change:</p>
<ul>
<li>The non-binding ex-post regulator gets binding oversight powers on select capabilities. To actually stop an operation involves a heavyweight procedure which can also be stayed. In addition, the regulator needs a lot of new highly technical staff which has been hard to find.</li>
<li>Hacking operations no longer need to detail plans or technical risks to the regulator. These risks include the leaking of ‘zero days’, or damaging non-target or third party services. In addition, technical risk includes the possibility that the facilities installed by the services could be abused by yet other services or hackers.</li>
<li>Hacking operations no longer need to be tied to specific groups of people or organizations. It will become possible to hack into generic companies, for example to enable the retrieval of phone location data in the future. For such strategic hacks on infrastructure, no technical risks need to be described to the regulator.</li>
<li>Services gain the power to intercept and store any cable for a year, no matter where it leads to, and also store the data for a year. No justification needs to be given for this exploration beyond that there is an interest in figuring out what traffic a cable carries. Data collected under this article may be investigated for a whole year, but (crucially!) not for any other purpose than finding targets. Such exploratory data can be shared with foreign and non-EU intelligence agencies.</li>
<li>In addition, the article 48 powers can now be applied based solely on ‘indications’ what the technical plans are with this data. The regulators are instructed to mostly only study these indications, to the detriment of proportionality, subsidiarity and ‘as targeted as possible’ requirements. The indications are non-binding and the services have the liberty to do other things during the year if they need to. <strong>In effect, regulators do not have a lot left to regulate with this change</strong>.</li>
<li>The administrative permissionless extension of warrants is extended to <em>NON-TARGETS</em>. This means that if a hacker group is being targeted, warrants for eavesdropping, hacking, requisitioning are automatically extended to the <em>victims</em> of those hackers as well. This means that the additional test that used to apply to non-targets is no longer required, and instead, non-targets now get less protection than targets (!).</li>
<li>Algorithmic analysis on bulk intercepted data no longer needs regulatory approval. Since it is not well described what this automated analysis entails, this is a large expansion of powers that are not regulated up front. The European Court of Human Rights argues explicitly that such automated analysis needs safeguards (see below)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="some-context">Some context</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng?i=001-210077">CASE OF BIG BROTHER WATCH AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM</a> - with particular attention to:
<ul>
<li>“330. The Court considers that Article 8 applies at each of the above stages. While the initial interception followed by the immediate discarding of parts of the communications does not constitute a particularly significant interference, the degree of interference with individuals’ Article 8 rights will increase as the bulk interception process progresses. In this regard, the Court has clearly stated that even the mere storing of data relating to the private life of an individual amounts to an interference within the meaning of Article 8 (see Leander v. Sweden, 26 March 1987, § 48, Series A no. 116), and that <strong>the need for safeguards will be all the greater where the protection of personal data undergoing automatic processing is concerned</strong> (see S. and Marper, cited above, § 103). The fact that the stored material is in coded form, intelligible only with the use of computer technology and capable of being interpreted only by a limited number of persons, can have no bearing on that finding (see Amann v. Switzerland [GC], no. 27798/95, § 69, ECHR 2000‑II and S. and Marper, cited above, §§ 67 and 75).”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

   <p>Police in Charleston, S.C., are investigating the death of John Barnett, a former Boeing quality control manager who became a whistleblower when he went public with his concerns about serious safety issues in the company's commercial airplanes.</p>   <p>Barnett's body was found in a vehicle in a Holiday Inn parking lot in Charleston on Saturday, police said. One day earlier, he testified about the string of problems he says he identified at Boeing's plant where he once helped inspect the 787 aircraft before delivery to customers.</p>   
   
   
<!-- END ID="RES1238040111" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>Police said officers were sent to the hotel to conduct a welfare check after people were unable to contact Barnett, who had traveled to Charleston to testify in his lawsuit against Boeing. </p>   <p>"Upon their arrival, officers discovered a male inside a vehicle suffering from a gunshot wound to the head," police said in a statement sent to NPR. "He was pronounced deceased at the scene."</p>   <p>The office of Charleston County Coroner Bobbi Jo O'Neal said that Barnett, who had been living in Louisiana after retiring from Boeing, died "from what appears to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound." </p>   <p>Charleston police said detectives are actively investigating the case and are awaiting a formal cause of death as they try to determine the circumstances surrounding Barnett's death.</p>   <p>Barnett, who spent decades working for Boeing at its plants in Everett, Wash., and North Charleston, S.C., had repeatedly alleged that Boeing's manufacturing practices had declined — and that rather than improve them, he added, managers had pressured workers not to document potential defects and problems. </p>   <p>"We are saddened by Mr. Barnett's passing, and our thoughts are with his family and friends," Boeing said in a statement sent to NPR.</p>   <p>Barnett, 62, made international headlines in April of 2019 when he and other former Boeing employees <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/20/business/boeing-dreamliner-production-problems.html">spoke to The New York Times</a> about what he called shoddy manufacturing problems at Boeing. Barnett accused the company of adopting a culture that prioritized raw numbers and profits over quality — and by extension, passenger safety. </p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RES1238040572" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>"As a quality manager at Boeing, you're the last line of defense before a defect makes it out to the flying public," Barnett told the newspaper. "And I haven't seen a plane out of Charleston yet that I'd put my name on saying it's safe and airworthy."</p>   <p>By the time the article appeared, Barnett had already filed a whistleblower complaint against Boeing, saying that his attempts to raise quality and safety problems had been ignored and that he was punished for continuing to flag them.</p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RES1238041466" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>Barnett filed a whistleblower complaint against Boeing in early 2017; his case against the company was heading toward a trial this June, his family said. </p>   <p>"He was looking forward to having his day in court and hoped that it would force Boeing to change its culture," the family said in a statement shared with NPR by his brother, Rodney Barnett.</p>   <p>The family says Barnett's health declined because of the stresses of taking a stand against his longtime employer.</p>   <p>"He was suffering from PTSD and anxiety attacks as a result of being subjected to the hostile work environment at Boeing," they said, "which we believe led to his death."</p>   
   <p>When John Barnett was interviewed by Ralph Nader <a href="https://www.ralphnaderradiohour.com/p/boeing-787-dreamliner-hundreds-of-fdf#details">in 2019</a>, he said health issues had persisted after he retired from the plane-maker.</p>   <p>"It's taken a serious mental and emotional toll on me," Barnett said — but, he added, the safety of the airplanes rolling off the production line remained his main focus. </p>   <p>"That's what my story is about, is telling my story enough to where the right people get involved to make sure that these airplanes are made correctly," Barnett said. "Because the 787 carries 288 passengers plus crew. So the last thing I want to do is wake up in the morning and see a 787 has gone down" because of one of the problems he identified.  </p>   <p>"I mean, it's just, it keeps me up at night," he said.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The NYPD sent a sweeping subpoena seeking information from the social media account of the president of a New York City police accountability organization in February, records reviewed by Hell Gate show, only to withdraw its subpoena when told they would need to justify the subpoena in court.</p><p>Michael Clancy, better known to friends on and off social media as <a href="https://twitter.com/minkoff_steven/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rabbi</a>, received a notice last month from X, formerly known as Twitter, alerting him to the fact that the NYPD had sent X a subpoena requesting "all records consisting but not limited to all subscriber name(s), Email address(s), Phone number(s), account creation date, IP logs with timestamps (IP address of account logins and logouts), all logs of previous messages sent and received." The subpoena also requested "all videos sent and received, including but not limited to meta-data. exit data about the messages and videos” for the account.</p><p>The notification included a copy of the subpoena, which warned X not to tell Clancy of its existence. "You are not to disclose or notify any customer or third party of the existence of this subpoena or that records were provided pursuant to this subpoena," the document read.</p><p>But X, following its own corporate policy, told Clancy anyway, and suggested he might want to get some legal representation to fight the subpoena, recommending the American Civil Liberties Union. Clancy did just that, and Kathryn Sachs of the New York Civil Liberties Union took up his case. Last Wednesday, Sachs wrote to the NYPD to challenge the administrative subpoena, which the NYPD had sent on its own authority, without any warrant or judicial approval. If the NYPD did not withdraw the subpoena, Sachs told the NYPD, Clancy would go to court with a motion to quash it. Rather than go to court to explain to a judge why the subpoena was necessary, the NYPD wrote back the same afternoon to say that it was withdrawing the subpoena altogether.</p><p>The NYPD subpoena letter cited as its empowering authority <a href="https://codelibrary.amlegal.com/codes/newyorkcity/latest/NYCadmin/0-0-0-25019" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Section 14-137 of the New York City Administrative Code</a>, which gives the NYPD commissioner the power to issue subpoenas. But as Sachs argued in her letter to the NYPD, that doesn't mean the police department can issue warrantless subpoenas for anything they feel like. Sachs cited case law suggesting that the subpoena power is actually restricted to investigations involving current or former officers.</p><p>Under the federal <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2703" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stored Communications Act</a>, authorities who want to subpoena electronic records from a provider either need a court-issued warrant, or, if they're using an administrative subpoena, "prior notice from the governmental entity to the subscriber or customer."</p><p>"This kind of administrative subpoena is not overseen by any court, and is not meant to target people like our client," Sachs told Hell Gate. "If it's left unchecked, it would chill speech from potentially anyone that the NYPD decided to subpoena information about."</p><p>"We don't give that kind of power to police departments without judicial review," said Marty Stolar, a lawyer who has worked on similar cases in the past. "It's got to be a process that's connected to a court if you're going to apply it to the general population. Here, the NYPD is misusing the power of subpoena to compel the production of documents as if they had the right to demand that information from any citizen. And they don't have that right. We have never given it to them."&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://lede-admin.hellgatenyc.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2024/03/Twitter_Subpoena.jpg?w=710" srcset="https://lede-admin.hellgatenyc.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2024/03/Twitter_Subpoena.jpg?w=425&amp;quality=75 425w, https://lede-admin.hellgatenyc.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2024/03/Twitter_Subpoena.jpg?w=850&amp;quality=75 850w, https://lede-admin.hellgatenyc.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2024/03/Twitter_Subpoena.jpg?w=585&amp;quality=75 585w, https://lede-admin.hellgatenyc.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2024/03/Twitter_Subpoena.jpg?w=1170&amp;quality=75 1170w, https://lede-admin.hellgatenyc.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2024/03/Twitter_Subpoena.jpg?w=710&amp;quality=75 710w, https://lede-admin.hellgatenyc.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2024/03/Twitter_Subpoena.jpg?w=1420&amp;quality=75 1420w" sizes="(max-width: 30rem) 425px, (min-width: 30rem) and (max-width: 40rem) 585px, (min-width: 40rem) 710px" loading="lazy"><figcaption>A copy of the NYPD subpoena supplied by X.</figcaption></figure><p>The legal status of the NYPD's use of warrantless subpoenas for social media information isn't as clear as it might be, in part because when the NYPD's use of such subpoenas is challenged, it tends to withdraw the subpoenas rather than engage in a court process that might definitively establish the legality or illegality of its practice.</p><p>In 2020, the department <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/14/nyregion/patriot-act-subpoena-nypd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sent a nearly identical subpoena</a> to Twitter, seeking a broad swath of records for Tina Moore, a New York Post reporter covering the NYPD. When lawyers for the Post threatened to challenge the subpoena in court, the NYPD hastily withdrew it. The incident provoked significant backlash, with free speech advocates, the Post, and groups like the Media Law Resource Center decrying the chilling effect of the subpoena.</p><p>Clancy isn't working as a conventional journalist, but he is involved in the collection and dissemination of information about the NYPD. As president of the Brooklyn chapter of Copwatch Patrol Unit, Clancy receives tips about police conduct, and films police conduct himself. While the withdrawal of the subpoena makes it all but impossible to know what the NYPD's goal was in issuing it, he has his theories. Maybe the police are just trying to rattle him with a shot across the bow. Or maybe the NYPD is trying to find out whether NYPD officers themselves are feeding his organization information about misconduct. "That happens," Clancy told Hell Gate. "For a junior officer who sees misconduct by his superiors, if you take that to Internal Affairs, maybe your boss has a connection there and it winds up being you who gets in trouble. So some cops prefer to take it to Copwatch."</p><p>As a further wrinkle, the NYPD's subpoena letter to X was sent by Michael Yanni, a member of the office of the department's deputy commissioner for legal matters, but used the email address <a href="mailto:intelsubpoenas@nynjhidta.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">intelsubpoenas@nynjhidta.org</a>, a domain affiliated with the <a href="https://www.hidtaprogram.org/ny_nj.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">New York and New Jersey High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area</a> office, a regional and federal joint drug task force. Similarly, the letter from the NYPD notifying NYCLU of the withdrawal of the subpoena was sent from Mallory McGee, an attorney with the NYPD Legal Bureau, using another email attached to the drug task force.</p><p>Why are NYPD lawyers sending out subpoenas for a critic's private information without a warrant? Why are they using federal task force email domains to do it? Why did they withdraw the subpoena rather than defend its legitimacy in court? How many of these warrantless subpoenas have they sent out in the last year? We asked the NYPD these questions, but did not receive a response.</p><p>Clancy, for his part,<strong> </strong>said that he's undaunted, and that the NYPD has no business rummaging through his social media content and metadata.&nbsp;</p><p>"Why would you use a shower curtain and close the bathroom door when you take a shower, if you have nothing to hide?" he asked. "Because it's none of your business, that's why. What the police might want to know and what they have a legal right to know are two different things."</p></div></div>]]></description>

		<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Marking a major investment in Meta’s AI future, we are announcing two 24k GPU clusters. We are sharing details on the hardware, network, storage, design, performance, and software that help us extract high throughput and reliability for various AI workloads. We use this cluster design for Llama 3 training.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>We are strongly committed to open compute and open source. We built these clusters on top of </span><a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2022/10/18/open-source/ocp-summit-2022-grand-teton/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Grand Teton</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.opencompute.org/wiki/Open_Rack/SpecsAndDesigns" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>OpenRack</span></a><span>, and </span><a href="https://pytorch.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>PyTorch</span></a><span> and continue to push open innovation across the industry.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>This announcement is one step in our ambitious infrastructure roadmap. By the end of 2024, we’re aiming to continue to grow our infrastructure build-out that will include 350,000 NVIDIA H100 GPUs as part of a portfolio that will feature compute power equivalent to nearly 600,000 H100s.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>To lead in developing AI means leading investments in hardware infrastructure. Hardware infrastructure plays an important role in AI’s future. Today, we’re sharing details on two versions of our </span><span>24,576-GPU data center scale cluster at Meta. These clusters support our current and next generation AI models, including Llama 3, the successor to</span><a href="https://ai.meta.com/llama/open-innovation-ai-research-community"> <span>Llama 2</span></a><span>, our publicly released LLM, as well as AI research and development across GenAI and other areas .</span></p>
<h2><span>A peek into Meta’s large-scale AI clusters</span></h2>
<p><span>Meta’s long-term vision is to build artificial general intelligence (AGI) that is open and built responsibly so that it can be widely available for everyone to benefit from. As we work towards AGI, we have also worked on scaling our clusters to power this ambition. The progress we make towards AGI creates new products,</span><a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2023/09/introducing-ai-powered-assistants-characters-and-creative-tools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <span>new AI features for our family of apps</span></a><span>, and new AI-centric computing devices.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>While we’ve had a long history of building AI infrastructure, we first shared details on our </span><a href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/ai-rsc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>AI Research SuperCluster (RSC)</span></a><span>, featuring 16,000 NVIDIA A100 GPUs, in 2022. RSC has accelerated our open and responsible AI research by helping us build our first generation of advanced AI models. It played and continues to play an important role in the development of </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13971" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Llama</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09288" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Llama 2</span></a><span>, as well as advanced AI models for applications ranging from computer vision, NLP, and speech recognition, to</span><a href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/emu-text-to-video-generation-image-editing-research/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <span>image generation</span></a><span>, and even</span> <a href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/code-llama-large-language-model-coding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>coding</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Meta-24K-GenAi-Clusters-hero.png?w=1024" alt="" width="1024" height="734" srcset="https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Meta-24K-GenAi-Clusters-hero.png 1999w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Meta-24K-GenAi-Clusters-hero.png?resize=916,656 916w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Meta-24K-GenAi-Clusters-hero.png?resize=768,550 768w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Meta-24K-GenAi-Clusters-hero.png?resize=1024,734 1024w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Meta-24K-GenAi-Clusters-hero.png?resize=1536,1100 1536w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Meta-24K-GenAi-Clusters-hero.png?resize=96,69 96w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Meta-24K-GenAi-Clusters-hero.png?resize=192,138 192w" sizes="(max-width: 992px) 100vw, 62vw"></p>
<h2><span>Under the hood</span></h2>
<p><span>Our newer AI clusters build upon the successes and lessons learned from RSC. We focused on building end-to-end AI systems with a major emphasis on researcher and developer experience and productivity. The efficiency of the high-performance network fabrics within these clusters, some of the key storage decisions, combined with the 24,576 NVIDIA Tensor Core H100 GPUs in each, allow both cluster versions to support models larger and more complex than that could be supported in the RSC and pave the way for advancements in GenAI product development and AI research.</span></p>
<h3><span>Network</span></h3>
<p><span>At Meta, we handle hundreds of trillions of AI model executions per day. Delivering these services at a large scale requires a highly advanced and flexible infrastructure. Custom designing much of our own hardware, software, and network fabrics allows us to optimize the end-to-end experience for our AI researchers while ensuring our data centers operate efficiently.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>With this in mind, we built one cluster with a remote direct memory access (RDMA) over converged Ethernet (RoCE) network fabric solution based on the </span><a href="https://www.arista.com/assets/data/pdf/Datasheets/7800R3-Data-Sheet.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Arista 7800</span></a><span> with </span><a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2021/11/09/data-center-engineering/ocp-summit-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Wedge400</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2021/11/09/data-center-engineering/ocp-summit-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Minipack2</span></a><span> OCP rack switches. The other cluster features an </span><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/networking/quantum2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>NVIDIA Quantum2 InfiniBand</span></a><span> fabric. Both of these solutions interconnect 400 Gbps endpoints. With these two, we are able to assess the suitability and scalability of these </span><a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2023/11/15/networking-traffic/watch-metas-engineers-on-building-network-infrastructure-for-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>different types of interconnect for large-scale training,</span></a><span> giving us more insights that will help inform how we design and build even larger, scaled-up clusters in the future. Through careful co-design of the network, software, and model architectures, we have successfully used both RoCE and InfiniBand clusters for large, GenAI workloads (including our ongoing training of Llama 3 on our RoCE cluster) without any network bottlenecks.</span></p>
<h3><span>Compute</span></h3>
<p><span>Both clusters are built using</span> <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2022/10/18/open-source/ocp-summit-2022-grand-teton/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Grand Teton</span></a><span>, our in-house-designed, open GPU hardware platform that we’ve contributed to the Open Compute Project (OCP). Grand Teton builds on the many generations of AI systems that integrate power, control, compute, and fabric interfaces into a single chassis for better overall performance, signal integrity, and thermal performance. It provides rapid scalability and flexibility in a simplified design, allowing it to be quickly deployed into data center fleets and easily maintained and scaled. Combined with other in-house innovations like our</span> <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2022/10/18/open-source/ocp-summit-2022-grand-teton/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Open Rack</span></a><span> power and rack architecture, Grand Teton allows us to build new clusters in a way that is purpose-built for current and future applications at Meta.</span></p>
<p><span>We have been openly designing our GPU hardware platforms beginning with our </span><a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2015/12/10/ml-applications/facebook-to-open-source-ai-hardware-design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Big Sur platform in 2015</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<h3><span>Storage</span></h3>
<p><span>Storage plays an important role in AI training, and yet is one of the least talked-about aspects. As the GenAI training jobs become more multimodal over time, consuming large amounts of image, video, and text data, the need for data storage grows rapidly. The need to fit all that data storage into a performant, yet power-efficient footprint doesn’t go away though, which makes the problem more interesting.</span></p>
<p><span>Our storage deployment addresses the data and checkpointing needs of the AI clusters via a home-grown Linux Filesystem in Userspace (FUSE) API backed by a version of Meta’s </span><a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/fast21/presentation/pan" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>‘Tectonic’ distributed storage solution</span></a><span> optimized for Flash media. This solution enables thousands of GPUs to save and load checkpoints in a synchronized fashion (a </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thundering_herd_problem#:~:text=In%20computer%20science%2C%20the%20thundering,able%20to%20handle%20the%20event."><span>challenge</span></a><span> for any storage solution) while also providing a flexible and high-throughput exabyte scale storage required for data loading.</span></p>
<p><span>We have also partnered with </span><a href="https://hammerspace.com/software/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Hammerspace</span></a><span> to co-develop and land a parallel network file system (NFS) deployment to meet the developer experience requirements for this AI cluster. Among other benefits, Hammerspace enables engineers to perform interactive debugging for jobs using thousands of GPUs as code changes are immediately accessible to all nodes within the environment. When paired together, the combination of our Tectonic distributed storage solution and Hammerspace enable fast iteration velocity without compromising on scale.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The storage deployments in our GenAI clusters, both Tectonic- and Hammerspace-backed, are based on the </span><a href="https://www.opencompute.org/documents/e1s-expansion-2ou-1s-server-design-specification-pdf"><span>YV3 Sierra Point server platform</span></a><span>, upgraded with the latest high capacity E1.S SSD we can procure in the market today. Aside from the higher SSD capacity, the servers per rack was customized to achieve the right balance of throughput capacity per server, rack count reduction, and associated power efficiency. Utilizing the OCP servers as Lego-like building blocks, our storage layer is able to flexibly scale to future requirements in this cluster as well as in future, bigger AI clusters, while being fault-tolerant to day-to-day Infrastructure maintenance operations.</span></p>
<h3><span>Performance</span></h3>
<p><span>One of the principles we have in building our large-scale AI clusters is to maximize performance and ease of use simultaneously without compromising one for the other. This is an important principle in creating the best-in-class AI models.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As we push the limits of AI systems, the best way we can test our ability to scale-up our designs is to simply build a system, optimize it, and actually test it (while simulators help, they only go so far). In this design journey, we compared the performance seen in our small clusters and with large clusters to see where our bottlenecks are. In the graph below, AllGather collective performance is shown (as normalized bandwidth on a 0-100 scale) when a large number of GPUs are communicating with each other at message sizes where roofline performance is expected.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Our out-of-box performance for large clusters was initially poor and inconsistent, compared to optimized small cluster performance. To address this we made several changes to how our internal job scheduler schedules jobs with network topology awareness – this resulted in latency benefits and minimized the amount of traffic going to upper layers of the network. We also optimized our network routing strategy in combination with NVIDIA Collective Communications Library (NCCL) changes to achieve optimal network utilization. This helped push our large clusters to achieve great and expected performance just as our small clusters.</span></p>

After we optimize the full system (software, network, etc.), we see large cluster performance return to the ideal 90%+ range.</figcaption></figure>
<p><span>In addition to software changes targeting our internal infrastructure, we worked closely with teams authoring training frameworks and models to adapt to our evolving infrastructure. For example, NVIDIA H100 GPUs open the possibility of leveraging new data types such as 8-bit floating point (FP8) for training. Fully utilizing larger clusters required investments in additional parallelization techniques and new storage solutions provided opportunities to highly optimize checkpointing across thousands of ranks to run in hundreds of milliseconds.</span></p>
<p><span>We also recognize debuggability as one of the major challenges in large-scale training. Identifying a problematic GPU that is stalling an entire training job becomes very difficult at a large scale. We’re building tools such as desync debug, or a distributed collective flight recorder, to expose the details of distributed training, and help identify issues in a much faster and easier way</span></p>
<p><span>Finally, we’re continuing to evolve PyTorch, the foundational AI framework powering our AI workloads, to make it ready for tens, or even hundreds, of thousands of GPU training. We have identified multiple bottlenecks for process group initialization, and reduced the startup time from sometimes hours down to minutes.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span>Commitment to open AI innovation</span></h2>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div fs-toc-offsettop="5rem" fs-toc-element="contents" id="w-node-_1f6dfb0a-a2b6-7b6c-63db-a502d9c255db-48ffd991"><p>Deterministic simulation testing is fast becoming the gold standard for how mission critical software is tested. Deterministic simulation testing was first popularized by the <a href="https://www.foundationdb.org/">FoundationDB</a> team who spent 18 months building a deterministic simulation framework for their database before ever letting it write or read data from an actual physical disk. The results speak for themselves: FoundationDB is widely considered to be one of the most robust and well-tested distributed databases, so much so that Kyle Kingsbury (of Jepsen fame) refused to test it because their deterministic simulator already stress tested FoundationDB more than the Jepsen framework ever could.</p><p>The WarpStream team utilized FoundationDB heavily at Datadog when we built <a href="https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/engineering/introducing-husky/">Husky, Datadog’s columnar storage engine for event data</a>. Over the course of our careers, our team has operated (and been on-call for) almost every database on the market: M3DB, etcd, ZooKeeper, Cassandra, Elasticsearch, Redis, MongoDB, MySQL, Postgres, Apache Kafka and more. In our experience, FoundationDB stands in a league of its own in terms of correctness and reliability due to its early investment in deterministic simulation testing.</p><p>A more recent example of a database system that leverages this approach to testing is <a href="https://tigerbeetle.com/">TigerBeetle</a>, a financial transactions database, that uses <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC1B3d9C_sI">deterministic simulation testing</a> to build one of the most robust financial OLTP databases available today.</p><p>When we were designing WarpStream, we knew that it wouldn’t be enough to just replace Apache Kafka with something cheaper and easier to operate. Kafka is the beating heart of many companies most critical infrastructure, and if we were to stand any chance of convincing those organizations to adopt WarpStream, we’d have to compress 12+ years of production hardening into a much shorter time frame. We accelerated this process with our architectural decision to rely on object storage as the <em>only</em> storage in the system, bypassing many of the tricky problems of ensuring data durability, availability, and replication at scale. Still, the fact that WarpStream leverages object storage is only a small part of ensuring the correctness of the overall system.</p><h2>Antithesis</h2><p>When we first heard about Antithesis, we could hardly contain our excitement. Antithesis has created the holy grail for testing distributed systems: a bespoke hypervisor that deterministically simulates an entire set of Docker containers and injects faults, <em>created by the same people who made FoundationDB</em>. For a group of gray-haired distributed systems engineers, seeing Antithesis in action felt like a tribe of cavemen stumbling upon a post-industrial revolution society. As we spoke more to the Antithesis team, an idea began to crystallize: we could use Antithesis to deterministically simulate not only WarpStream, but our entire SaaS!</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/64baaecd9c5c9b1b6c38aa0e/65ef867803ca64e3d2e6587e_YVvFpLKTZhluuelHF7q2V7b9ABUwpO10pOj-_oj82XeYsh-liqTCnQ-1YCQQD3vAgzvuq5eY47zO76jW4YrCTehCmfw91o4UvoFtX2QlfEjJgTb_ZLzxcuB1rleAamm02bEho7kRdWKG0w86QxbWtG8.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>WarpStream was built differently than most traditional database products. It was designed from day one with a true data plane / control plane split. There are two primary components to WarpStream: First, the Agents (data plane) that act as “thick proxies” and expose the Kafka protocol to clients. The Agents also take care of all communication with object storage, layering in batching and caching to improve performance and keep costs low.</p><p>‍<br>Second is the WarpStream control plane which has two major components:</p><ol role="list"><li>The metadata store that tracks cluster metadata and performs remote consensus.</li><li>Our SaaS software that manages different tenants’ metadata stores, API keys, users, accounts, etc.</li></ol><p>The metadata store only has two dependencies:</p><ol role="list"><li>Any cloud KV store&nbsp;</li><li>Object storage</li></ol><p>The SaaS software adds one additional dependency: a traditional SQL database for managing users, organization, API keys, etc. Looking at WarpStream’s minimal dependencies, we thought, why not test its entire customer experience, from initial signup to running Kafka workloads?</p><p>We created a docker-compose file that contains the following components:</p><ol role="list"><li>Several WarpStream Agents</li><li>Several WarpStream Control Plane nodes</li><li>Several Apache Kafka clients</li><li>A KV store</li><li>Postgres</li><li>An object store (<a href="https://docs.localstack.cloud/user-guide/aws/s3/">localstack</a>)</li></ol><p>With the help of the Antithesis team, we wrote a test workload that started all of those services, signed up for a WarpStream account, created a virtual cluster, and then began producing and consuming data. The workload was carefully structured so that we could assert on a variety of different important properties that WarpStream must maintain at all times.</p><p>The test workload consists of multiple producers that are each assigned a unique ID and write records to a small set of topics. These producers synchronously write a few small JSON records that contain the producer’s ID, a counter (a monotonic sequence number for that producer), and a few other properties. We repeat the same components as the record’s key, value, and in a header to ensure we never shuffle those around accidentally. The consumer side of the workload polls all the topics and all the partitions and asserts that:</p><ol role="list"><li>The topic and partition the record was consumed from matches the topic and partition the record was produced to.</li><li>The offsets for each record in each partition are monotonic.</li><li>The sequence numbers for each producer are monotonic, i.e. if we group the records by &lt;Topic, Partition, ProducerID&gt; the sequence number encoded in the record is monotonically increasing.</li></ol><p>The consumers store all of the records for each polling iteration and can assert that a record at offset X in the previous poll still exists in a future poll. This ensures that WarpStream doesn't lose or reorder data as e.g. background compaction runs to reorganize the cluster’s data for more efficient access.</p><p>These assertions address many of the classes of bugs found in previous Jepsen tests of Apache Kafka and other Kafka-compatible systems. For example, prior Jepsen tests have caught bugs like:</p><ol role="list"><li>Loss of previously acknowledged writes. If a write was acknowledged but failed to appear in the output for that topic-partition in the future, assertion 1 or 3 above would fire.</li><li>Violation of producer idempotency (i.e producing duplicate records without the producer itself crashing or restarting).&nbsp; Antithesis automatically tests our Idempotent Producer implementation by disrupting the network between the producer client and the agent or the agent and the control plane, leading to internal retries inside the Kafka client. A duplicate would cause the sequence number from a producer to stay the same or decrease, causing assertion 3 above to fire.</li><li>Records appearing in different topic-partitions than they were originally written to. This is addressed by assertions 1 or 3 above.</li></ol><h2>What’s the big deal?</h2><p>At this point you might be scratching your head a little bit and wondering: “What’s the big deal here? Isn’t this just a really fancy integration test!?”. Yes and no. Before we started using Antithesis, WarpStream already had a pretty robust set of stress tests we called the “correctness tests”.</p><p>These tests do essentially everything we just described, but in a regular CI environment. Our correctness tests even inject faults all over the WarpStream stack using a custom chaos injection library that we wrote. These tests are incredibly powerful, and they caught a <em>lot</em> of bugs. We would go as far as saying that investing deeply in those correctness tests is one of the main reasons that we were able to develop WarpStream as efficiently as we did.</p><p>Just like our existing correctness tests, the Antithesis hypervisor automatically injects faults, latency, thread hangs, and restarts into the workload. However, unlike our correctness tests, the Antithesis hypervisor is <em>really smart</em> and automatically fuzzes the system under test in an intelligent way.</p><p>Antithesis automatically instruments your software to measure code coverage and build statistics about the execution frequency of each code path. This enables Antithesis to detect “interesting” behavior in the test (such as infrequent code paths getting exercised, or rare log messages being emitted).</p><p>When Antithesis detects interesting or rare behavior, it immediately snapshots the state of the entire system before exploring various different execution branches. This means that Antithesis is <em>much</em> better at triggering rare or unlikely behavior in WarpStream than our existing correctness tests were.</p><p>Also, since Antithesis runs the entire software stack in a deterministic simulator, they can actually run the simulation at <em>faster than wall clock time</em>. Similar to FoundationDB, WarpStream makes heavy use of timers and batching to improve performance. Anytime a WarpStream Goroutine does the equivalent of time.Sleep(), the Antithesis hypervisor <em>doesn’t actually have to wait</em>. On top of that, the Antithesis hypervisor explores code branches <em>concurrently</em>. All of this adds up in a meaningful way such that Antithesis can cost effectively compress years of stress testing into a much shorter time frame.</p><p>It’s hard to over-emphasize just how transformative this technology is for building distributed systems. For all intents and purposes, it really does feel like a time-traveler arrived from 20 years in the future and gave us their state of the art software testing technology. Of course, it’s not <em>actually</em> magic. Antithesis is the result of dozens of the smartest software engineers, statisticians, and machine learning experts pouring their heart and souls into the problem of software testing for 5 years straight. But to us mere mortals, it does feel a lot like magic.</p><h2>We found some bugs</h2><p>Let’s look at a few example runs that Antithesis generated for us.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/64baaecd9c5c9b1b6c38aa0e/65f066a2ce79a8d23436120b_antithesis%20report%20final.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Antithesis ran the WarpStream workload for 6 wall clock hours, during which it simulated 280 hours of application time. The graph shows that it took about 160 “application hours” for Antithesis to “stall” and stop discovering new “behaviors” in the WarpStream workload. This means that running the tests for longer than 160 hours has diminishing returns, and instead we should invest in making the test itself more sophisticated if we want to exercise the codebase more. Great feedback for us!</p><p>But think about that for a moment: even after 140 hours of injecting faults, randomizing thread execution, automatically detecting that something interesting / rare had happened and intentionally branching to investigate further, Antithesis was still “discovering” new behaviors in WarpStream. We could hire a 100 distributed systems engineers and make them write integration tests for an entire year, and they probably wouldn’t be able to trigger all the interesting states and behavior that a single Antithesis run covered in 6 hours of wall clock time.</p><p>As just one example of how powerful this is, on the first day we started using Antithesis it caught a data race in our metrics instrumentation library that had been present since the first month of the project.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/64baaecd9c5c9b1b6c38aa0e/65f0668f355b0f7639cbe921_antithesis%20data%20race%20final.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Our correctness tests had run in our regular CI workflows for literally <em>10s of thousands of hours</em> by then, with the Go race detector enabled, and not once ever caught this bug. Antithesis caught this bug in its first 233 seconds of execution.</p><p>A data race in the instrumentation library isn’t that exciting, though. What about an extremely rare data loss bug that is the result of both a network failure and a race condition? That’s more exciting!</p><p>To minimize the number of S3 PUTs that WarpStream users have to pay for, the Agents buffer Kafka Produce requests from many different clients in-memory for ~250ms before combining the batches of data into a single file and flushing it to object storage.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/64baaecd9c5c9b1b6c38aa0e/65ef86782ecf7975e9265e8b_eWyuN7USMfacq1cJSUWU9OuqagABl_7ImESBFKyhTiGiotejnSXeO40xn2oydgktnAU8HJpYK8RowxiR2iy3lZ4aTyiGSV6pJNNJTkHvuc6C9D4v75TnjrZj5JHygYuahZDF9BBnBUvuaz8tZyIZfvg.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>In some scenarios, like if write throughput is high, there will be multiple outstanding files being flushed to object storage concurrently. Once flushing the files succeeds, committing the metadata for the flushed files to the control plane can be batched to reduce networking overhead. This is implemented using a background Goroutine that periodically scans the list of “flushed but not yet committed” files.</p><p>While refactoring the Agent to add speculative retries for flushing files to object storage, we subtly broke the error handling on this path so that, for a very brief window of time, a file which failed to flush would be considered successful and ready to commit to the control plane metadata store. In program order (i.e. the linear flow of the code, ignoring concurrency) this window where the background Goroutine that commits metadata would see the successful file would be nearly impossible to squeeze into. This background Goroutine only polls for successful files every five milliseconds, and the time between the two state transitions in the common case would be less than a microsecond!</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/64baaecd9c5c9b1b6c38aa0e/65ef8757b0bcd3c9f824e5a8_Frame%2042%20(7).png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>This bug is the manifestation of two unlikely events: a file failing to flush and a specific thread interleaving that should be extremely rare in practice. Despite how unlikely these events are to occur together, on a long enough time-scale, this bug would have resulted in data loss at some point.</p><p>Instead, thanks to Antithesis’ powerful fuzzer and fault injector, this rare combination of events happened roughly once per wall clock hour of testing. We’d been running a build with this bug in our staging environment and obviously did not encounter that bug at all, let alone once per hour, as it would’ve immediately been noticed when a future background compaction failed due to the missing file in object storage. We’ve since fixed the regression in the code such that the invalid, temporary state transition cannot occur.</p><h2>Why not Jepsen?</h2><p>The obvious question you might be asking yourself at this point is: Why use Antithesis instead of a traditional Jepsen test? It’s a good question, and one we asked ourselves before embarking on our journey with Antithesis.</p><p>We’re big fans of Jepsen and have consumed almost every published report. However, after speaking with the Antithesis team and spending a few months integrating with it, we feel strongly that deterministic simulation testing with tools like Antithesis is a much more robust and sustainable path forward for the industry. Specifically, we think that the Antithesis’ approach is better than Jepsen’s for a few reasons:</p><ol role="list"><li>The Antithesis technology is more robust, and much more likely to catch bugs than the Jepsen harness. There is simply no other equivalent (that we’re aware of) to Antithesis’ custom hypervisor, and its ability to automatically instrument distributed systems for code coverage and effectively “hunt” for bugs. Yes, the Jepsen framework will inject faults into a running environment in an effort to trigger bugs and edge-case behavior, but this approach is crude in comparison to what Antithesis does.</li><li>Antithesis integrates natively into how our engineers are used to working. The entire test setup is expressed using standard docker-compose files and Docker images, and Antithesis tests are kicked off using Github Actions that push WarpStream images to Antithesis’ docker registry. When we add new functionality, all our engineers have to do is modify the Antithesis workload and kick off an automated CI job. The entire experience and workflow lives right next to our existing codebase, CI, and workflows. Extra bonus: none of our engineers had to learn Clojure.</li><li>Antithesis testing is designed to be a continuous process with accompanying professional services that help you grow and adapt the tests as the scope of your product increases. That means our users get the confidence that every WarpStream release is actively tested with Antithesis, unlike a traditional Jepsen test where the engagement is short-lived and usually only covers a “snapshot” of a system at a static point in time.</li><li>Finally, it would not have been practical to continuously test our entire SaaS platform with Jepsen in the same way that we do with Antithesis. While that may seem like overkill, we think it’s a pretty important point. For example, consider the fact that almost every cloud infrastructure provider has a routing or proxy layer that is responsible for routing customer requests to the correct set of infrastructure that hosts the customer’s resources. A small data race or caching bug in that routing layer could result in exposing one customer’s resources to a different customer. These multi-tenant SaaS layers are never tested in traditional Jepsen testing, but with Antithesis it was actually easier to include these layers in our testing than to specifically exclude them.</li></ol><p>We’re just getting started with Antithesis! Over the coming months we plan to work with the Antithesis team to expand our testing footprint to cover additional functionality like:</p><ol role="list"><li>Multi-region deployments of our SaaS platform.</li><li><a href="https://docs.warpstream.com/warpstream/configuration/deploy/splitting-agent-roles">Multi-role Agent Clusters</a>.</li><li>Injecting and detecting data corruption at the storage and file cache layer using checksums.</li><li>And much more!</li></ol><p>If you’d like to learn more about WarpStream, please <a href="https://www.warpstream.com/contact-us">contact us</a>, or <a href="https://console.warpstream.com/socials/slack">join our Slack!</a></p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><header><h2>A four-day forecast today is as accurate as a one-day forecast 30 years ago.</h2></header><p>Weather forecasts are often seen as just a nice thing to have. Useful when planning a Sunday barbecue, or when we want to know if we’ll need an umbrella for the day. But in many ways weather forecasts are absolutely crucial: they can be a matter of life and death.</p><p>Accurate forecasts can save lives by giving early warnings of storms, heat waves, and disasters. Farmers use them for agricultural management, which can make the difference between a lost harvest or a harvest of plenty. Grid operators rely on accurate forecasts of temperatures for heating and cooling demand, and how much energy they’ll get from wind and solar farms. Pilots and sailors need them to carry people across oceans safely. Accurate information about future weather is often absolutely vital.</p><p>In this article, I look at improvements over time and the global inequalities that need to be closed to protect lives and livelihoods around the world.</p><h2 id="weather-forecasts-have-improved-a-lot">Weather forecasts have improved a lot<a href="#weather-forecasts-have-improved-a-lot"></a></h2><p>Weather forecasting has come a long way. In 650 B.C. the Babylonians would try to predict weather patterns based on cloud patterns and movements. Three centuries later, Aristotle wrote <em>Meteorologica</em>, discussing how phenomena such as rain, hail, hurricanes, and lightning formed. Much of it turned out to be wrong, but it represents one of the first attempts to explain how the weather works in detail.</p><p>It wasn’t until 1859 that the UK’s Meteorological Service (the Met Office) <a href="https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/about-us/who/our-history" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">issued its first</a> weather forecast for shipping. Two years later, it broadcasted its first public weather forecast. While meteorological measurements improved over time, the massive step-change in predictions came with the use of computerized numerical modeling. This didn’t start until a century later, in the 1960s.</p><p>Forecasts have improved a lot since then. We can see this across a range of measurements, and different national meteorological organizations.</p><p>The Met Office <a href="https://blog.metoffice.gov.uk/2023/11/15/why-an-exact-date-weather-forecast-headline-isnt-what-it-seems/#:~:text=Despite%20the%20certainty%20suggested%20in,come%20with%20in%2Dbuilt%20uncertainty." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">says</a> its four-day forecasts are now as accurate as its one-day forecasts were 30 years ago.</p><p>Predictions have gotten much better in the United States, too. We can see this in some of the most important forecasts: the prediction of hurricanes.</p><p>The National Hurricane Center <a href="https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/verification/verify5.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">publishes data</a> on the “track error” of hurricanes and cyclones — the error in <em>where</em> the hurricane hits. This is shown in the chart below, from the 1960s onwards.</p><p>Each line represents the error of forecasts for different time periods in advance. For example, 12 hours before it hits, all the way up to 120 hours (or 5 days) before.</p><p>We can see that this track error — especially for longer-term forecasts — has decreased a lot over time. In the 1970s, a 48-hour forecast had an error between 200 and 400 nautical miles; today this is around 50 nautical miles.</p><p>We can show the same data another way. In the chart below, each line represents the average error for each decade. On the horizontal axis we have the forecast period, again extending from 0 to 120 hours.</p><p>The 72-hour error in the 1960s and 70s was over 400 nautical miles. Today, it’s less than 80 miles.</p><p>Meteorologists can now make pretty accurate predictions of where a hurricane will hit three or four days in advance, which lets cities and communities prepare while preventing unnecessary evacuations that might have been implemented in the past.</p><figure><picture><source srcset="https://ourworldindata.org/images/published/hurricane-forecasting-error_100.png 100w, https://ourworldindata.org/images/published/hurricane-forecasting-error_350.png 350w, https://ourworldindata.org/images/published/hurricane-forecasting-error_850.png 850w, https://ourworldindata.org/images/published/hurricane-forecasting-error_1350.png 1350w, https://ourworldindata.org/images/published/hurricane-forecasting-error_7963.png 7963w" type="image/png" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 95vw, (min-width: 960px) 853px"><img src="https://ourworldindata.org/images/published/hurricane-forecasting-error.png" alt="Line chart showing the reduction in hurricane forecasting errors from the 1960s to the 2020s.

While national weather agencies use much higher-resolution processing to get local forecasts, these global models provide a crucial input into these systems.</p><p>The ECMWF publishes analyses of its errors over time. This is shown in the chart below.<a href="#note-1"><sup>1</sup></a> It shows the difference between the forecast and the actual weather outcome for forecasts 3, 5, 7, and 10 days in advance. The metric used here is the “<a href="https://climate.copernicus.eu/esotc/2022/atmospheric-circulation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">500 hPa geopotential height</a>”, a commonly used meteorological measure of air pressure (which dictates weather patterns).</p><p>The solid line is for the Northern Hemisphere, and the dashed line is for the Southern.</p><p>Three-day forecasts —&nbsp;shown in blue — have been pretty accurate since the 1980s, and have still gotten a lot better over time. Today the accuracy is around 97%.</p><p>The biggest improvements we’ve seen are for longer timeframes. By the early 2000s, 5-day forecasts were “highly accurate” and 7-day forecasts are reaching that threshold today. 10-day forecasts aren’t quite there yet but are getting better.</p><figure><picture><source srcset="https://ourworldindata.org/images/published/improved-weather-forecasting_100.png 100w, https://ourworldindata.org/images/published/improved-weather-forecasting_350.png 350w, https://ourworldindata.org/images/published/improved-weather-forecasting_850.png 850w, https://ourworldindata.org/images/published/improved-weather-forecasting_1350.png 1350w, https://ourworldindata.org/images/published/improved-weather-forecasting_7463.png 7463w" type="image/png" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 95vw, (min-width: 960px) 853px"><img src="https://ourworldindata.org/images/published/improved-weather-forecasting.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="7463" height="NaN"></picture></figure><h2 id="why-have-weather-forecasts-improved">Why have weather forecasts improved?<a href="#why-have-weather-forecasts-improved"></a></h2><p>A few key developments <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aav7274" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">explain these improvements</a>.<a href="#note-2"><sup>2</sup></a></p><p>The first big change is that the data has improved. More extensive and higher-resolution observations can be used as inputs into the weather models. This is because we have more and better satellite data, and because land-based stations are covering many more areas around the globe, and at a higher density. The precision of these instruments has improved, too.</p><p>These observations are then fed into numerical prediction models to forecast the weather. That brings us to the next two developments. The computers on which these models are run have gotten much faster. Faster speeds are crucial: the Met Office now chunks the world into grids of smaller and smaller squares. While they once modeled the world in 90-kilometer-wide squares, they are now down to a grid of 1.5-kilometer squares. That means many more calculations need to be run to get this high-resolution map. The methods to turn the observations into model outputs have also improved. We’ve gone from very simple visions of the world to methods that can capture the complexity of these systems in detail.</p><p>The final crucial factor is how these forecasts are communicated. Not long ago, you could only get daily updates in the daily newspaper. With the rise of radio and TV, you could get a few notices per day. Now, we can get minute-by-minute updates online or on our smartphones.</p><h2 id="low-income-countries-have-much-worse-forecasts-and-often-no-early-warning-systems">Low-income countries have much worse forecasts, and often no early warning systems<a href="#low-income-countries-have-much-worse-forecasts-and-often-no-early-warning-systems"></a></h2><p>At home in Scotland, I can open an app on my phone and get a pretty accurate 5-day forecast within seconds. Unfortunately, this quality of information isn’t available to everyone. There are large differences in weather forecasts across the world, with a large gap between rich and poor.</p><p>As the researchers Manuel Linsenmeier and Jeffrey Shrader report in a <a href="https://ideas.repec.org/p/osf/socarx/7e2jf.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recent paper</a>, a 7-day forecast in a rich country can be more accurate than a one-day forecast in some low-income ones.<a href="#note-3"><sup>3</sup></a></p><p>While national forecasts have improved over time across all income levels, the quality gap today is almost as wide as it was in the 1980s.</p><p>There are a few reasons for this. First, far fewer land-based instruments and radiosondes measure meteorological data in poorer countries. Second, the frequency of reporting is much lower.</p><p>This is unsurprising when we look at the amount of money spent on weather and climate information. In <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.1602632" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a paper</a> published in <em>Science</em>, Lucian Georgeson, Mark Maslin, and Martyn Poessinouw looked at differences in spending across income groups.<a href="#note-4"><sup>4</sup></a> This includes private and public spending on commercial products that fall within the definition of “weather and climate information services”.</p><p>This is shown as the spending <em>per person</em>, and the spending as a share of gross domestic product (GDP) in the chart below.</p><p>Low-income countries spend 15 to 20 times less per person than high-income countries. But given the size of their economies, they actually spend <em>more</em> as a share of GDP.</p><p>This gap is a problem. 60% of workers in low-income countries are <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-of-the-labor-force-employed-in-agriculture?tab=chart&amp;country=Low+income~High+income">employed in agriculture</a>, arguably the most weather-dependent sector. Most <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/africa-yields-problem" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">are small-scale farmers</a>, who are often extremely poor.</p><p>Having accurate weather forecasts can help farmers make better decisions. They can get information on the best time to plant their crops. They know in advance when irrigation will be most needed, or when fertilizers might be at risk of being washed away. They can receive alerts about pest and disease outbreaks so they can either protect their crops when an attack is coming or save pesticides when the risk is low. That means they can use precious resources most efficiently if they have access to accurate weather forecasts. Good weather forecasts are most crucial for the poorest people in the world.</p><p>They’re also crucial for protecting against cyclones, heat waves, flooding, and storm surges. Having accurate forecasts several days in advance allows cities and communities to prepare. Housing can be protected, and emergency services can be on standby to help with the recovery.</p><p>But accurate forecasts alone don’t solve the problem: they’re only useful if they are disseminated to people so they can respond. Many of the deadliest disasters over the last few decades <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212096322000687" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">were accurately forecasted</a> ahead of time. The common failure was poor communication.<a href="#note-5"><sup>5</sup></a></p><p>Improving forecasts is the foundation. But these also need to be incorporated into effective early warning systems. The World Meteorological Organization <a href="https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/099050123155016375/pdf/P1765160197f400b80947e0af8c48049151.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">estimates that</a> around one-third of the world — predominantly the poorest countries — do not have them.</p><h2 id="improving-forecasts-especially-in-low-income-countries-is-underrated">Improving forecasts — especially in low-income countries — is underrated<a href="#improving-forecasts-especially-in-low-income-countries-is-underrated"></a></h2><p>After the big progress in recent decades, we take good weather forecasting and dissemination for granted in large parts of the world. Making this available to everyone would make a difference.</p><p>This will be even more important as climate change increases the risks of weather-related disasters. It is ultimately the poorest, who are the more vulnerable, who will suffer the worst consequences. Better forecasts are key to good climate change adaptation.</p><p>Proper investment and financial support will be essential to close the gaps.</p><p>There also emerging technologies that could accelerate this. A <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06185-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recent paper</a> published in <em>Nature </em>documented a new <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/artificial-intelligence" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">artificial intelligence (AI)</a> system — Pangu-Weather — that can perform forecasts as accurately (or better) than leading meteorological agencies up to 10,000 times faster.<a href="#note-6"><sup>6</sup></a> It was trained on 39 years of historical data. The speed of these forecasts would make them much cheaper to run and could provide much better results for countries with limited budgets.</p><p>Faster and more efficient technologies can also fill the gaps where land-based weather stations aren’t available. Sensor-carrying drones can run surveys over specific areas to build higher-resolution maps. With lower-cost and more efficient ways of turning that into forecasts, mobile technologies can disseminate this information quickly. Some companies are already sending messages to farmers in low-income countries to advise them on the best time to plant their crops.</p><p>This innovation is crucial to making countries more resilient to weather today. But it’s also essential in a world where weather is likely to get more extreme.</p><div><h4>Acknowledgements</h4><p>Many thanks to Max Roser and Edouard Mathieu for their valuable feedback and comments on this article.</p></div><div><h3 id="article-endnotes">Endnotes</h3><ol><li id="note-1"><p>These charts are sourced from the following sources: Alley, R.

																			<div><p>We’re providing more flexibility for developers who distribute apps in the European Union (EU), including introducing a new way to distribute apps directly from a developer’s website.</p><h3>More flexibility</h3><p>Developers who’ve agreed to the Alternative Terms Addendum for Apps in the EU have new options for their apps in the EU:</p><ul>
<li>Alternative app marketplaces. Marketplaces can choose to offer a catalog of apps solely from the developer of the marketplace.</li>
<li>Linking out to purchase. When directing users to complete a transaction for digital goods or services on an external webpage, developers can choose how to design promotions, discounts, and other deals. The Apple-provided design templates, which are optimized for key purchase and promotional use cases, are now optional. </li>
</ul><h3>Distributing directly from your website</h3><p>Web Distribution, available with a software update later this spring, will let authorized developers distribute their iOS apps to EU users directly from a website owned by the developer.

As of today, Apple is allowing third-party app stores to offer apps solely from their own catalog. For example, a games studio could create an app store on iOS that exclusively offers their own games.</p>
<p>When directing users to complete a transaction on their website, developers can also now choose how to design their in-app promotions, discounts, and deals. Apple's templates for designing these links out to websites are optional as of today.</p>
<p>In addition, developers will soon be able to distribute apps directly from their websites, providing they meet Apple's specific criteria, such as being a member of the Apple Developer Program for two continuous years or more and having an app with more than one million first installs on iOS in the EU in the prior year, and commit to ongoing requirements, such as publishing transparent data collection policies. Apps distributed in this way must meet Apple's notarization requirements like all other iOS apps and can only be installed from a web domain registered in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> Connect.</p>
<p>Authorized developers will gain access to APIs to facilitate app distribution from the web, integration with system functionality, back up and restore, and more. Web distribution will become available following a software update later in the spring – allowing app downloads directly from a website for the first time on iOS. </p>
<p>The latest changes are part of Apple's Digital Markets Act (DMA) compliance plan and only apply within the European Union.</p>

            <pubDate>Tue, 12 Mar 2024 12:00:13 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2024-01-27-sourcehut-no-more/">https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2024-01-27-sourcehut-no-more/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39678491">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
          🏆 I provide private lessons on Emacs, Linux, and Life in
          general: <a href="https://protesilaos.com/coach/">https://protesilaos.com/coach/</a>.
          Lessons continue <strong>throughout the year</strong>.
        </p><article>

	

	<div>
		<p>On 2022-04-07 I moved all my Emacs projects from GitLab to SourceHut:
<a href="https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2022-04-07-all-emacs-projects-sourcehut/">https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2022-04-07-all-emacs-projects-sourcehut/</a>.
I am now undoing that decision. My code is on GitLab and GitHub, with
the latter as the de facto primary source.</p>

<p>Why the change:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The SourceHut web interface does not show any kind of indication
that a message has an attachment. Last time I tried it, I had to
download an mbox file and extract the patch from there. This was
helped by the fact that I knew what I was searching for, but the
experience was not pleasant anyway.</li>
  <li>Many users are reluctant to subscribe to my project’s mailing list
and instead email me directly. This is fine, as I do get the work
done eventually, but it beats the point of having a public inbox if
I am the only one who reads those messages anyway.</li>
  <li>Personal emails for package maintenance make it more difficult for
me to apply filters. I cannot easily go from “personal” to
“packages” and thus have trouble prioritising tasks.</li>
  <li>Users replying to mailing list threads frequently do not “reply to
all”, so the filter I have for SourceHut lists does not apply and my
inbox is noisy again.</li>
  <li>Coordinating work between my “official” SourceHut-based repository
and the de facto GitHub one is a problem, because a user on one may
not be aware of what a user on the other is doing.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are other papercuts as well, but I understand SourceHut is still
in “alpha”, so I will not list them here.</p>

<h2>What happens to the Git repositories on SourceHut?</h2>

<p>I am no longer updating them and plan to delete them in the near
future.</p>

<h2>What about the mailing lists?</h2>

<p>I will continue to reply to messages sent there, but I will eventually
ask people to use other media. If you do not want to use a Git forge
to report an issue or send a patch, then do it via my personal email:
<a href="https://protesilaos.com/contact">https://protesilaos.com/contact</a>.</p>

<h2>Will you host your own Git server?</h2>

<p>I want to do this at some point because I am mindful of the issues
with proprietary Git forges. But this is a task that requires
knowledge and resources. So it will not happen soon.</p>

      <p>Do you often append "reddit" or "wiki" to your Google search queries? <br>
Seek out human discourse on specific websites,
when search engines were invented to do it for you?
Worry not, for soon search engines will be useless.</p>
<p>If you searched Google for a movie review in 2005, you'd get a review.
Today, you get paid search results, ads, third-party cookies,
trackers, newsletter prompts, notification requests, and,
if you're lucky – a movie review.
No matter what you search for, SEO-hacked content farms will blot out the sun.<sup><a href="#fn-1" id="fnref-1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>The average essay is written not to be read, but to be found—by a search engine,
that is—so it can monetize every fiber of your eyeballs.
Keep you scrolling, clicking, and sharing.
Like this article? Maybe you'll like this e-book too.
It's free! (Just enter your email ;)).</p>
<p>The internet continues to grow in volume, but shrink in diversity.
As if everything has moved to a few select apps,
which then <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/17/24075670/reddit-ai-training-license-deal-user-content">sell our words</a> to AI slot machines.
Images on Instagram, videos on YouTube, and discussions on Reddit.
Dare to venture out of this bubble,
and you'll be pelted with SEO spam by content farms squabbling over search ranks and impressions.</p>
<p>But do you know what's worse than SEO spam?</p>
<h2 id="ai-generated-seo-spam-">AI generated SEO spam. <br></h2>
<p>With services that <a href="https://injuly.in/assets/img/darker-internet/seo-heist.webp">generate thousands of articles</a>,
post them on multiple websites,
then create fake profiles to market them<sup><a href="#fn-2" id="fnref-2">2</a></sup>;
the phrase "As an AI language model" now turns up on LinkedIn, Amazon, Twitter,
and even Google scholar.
In a matter of weeks, LLMs can generate more text than has ever been written in human history.
Every passing day, humans grow farther apart, and bots fill the void in between.</p>
<p>This steady decline hearkens me back to my early teenage years –
when I was an active user of several RTS video-game forums.
At the time, the internet was smaller and fostered organic growth.
Smaller websites were easier to find, game mods and fanfics weren't subreddits, and personal pages didn't live on Substack or Medium<sup><a href="#fn-3" id="fnref-3">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>When I'm older, I expect to surf an internet that will have exploded with AI content,
like the big bang leaving <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_forest_hypothesis">a dark forest</a> behind<sup><a href="#fn-4" id="fnref-4">4</a></sup>.
Online TV shows and webtoons with unending episodes generated on the fly,
digital journals overflowing with articles, and chat apps with AI companions to ease loneliness.
Human interaction will stay burrowed underground, in the tight confines of small and heavily moderated groups.</p>
<p>For the past few years, I've been holed up in small discord servers –
the only place where I expect to freely interact with meaningful messages that aren't marketing posts in disguise.
And if you too have been hiding in telegram groups and mailing lists  – good, don't leave.
It's dark outside.</p>

<!-- cache hit 206:single/related:346c4fe386f45703755c78b2601a96d9 --><!-- empty -->
<p>On October 19, 1989, at 12:29 UT, a monstrous X13 class solar flare triggered a geomagnetic storm so strong that auroras lit up the skies in Japan, America, Australia, and even Germany the following day. Had you been flying around the Moon at that time, you would have absorbed well over 6 Sieverts of radiation—a dose that would most likely kill you within a month or so.</p>
<p>This is why the Orion spacecraft that is supposed to take humans on a Moon fly-by mission this year has a heavily shielded storm shelter for the crew. But shelters like that aren’t sufficient for a flight to Mars—Orion’s shield is designed for a 30-day mission.</p>
<p>To obtain protection comparable to what we enjoy on Earth would require hundreds of tons of material, and that's simply not possible in orbit. The primary alternative—using active shields that deflect charged particles just like the Earth’s magnetic field does—was first proposed in the 1960s. Today, we’re finally close to making it work.</p>
<h2>Deep-space radiation</h2>
<p>Space radiation comes in two different flavors. Solar events like flares or coronal mass ejections can cause very high fluxes of charged particles (mostly protons). They're nasty when you have no shelter but are relatively easy to shield against since solar protons are mostly low energy. The majority of solar particle events flux is between 30 Mega-electronVolts to 100 MeV and could be stopped by Orion-like shelters.</p>
<p>Then there are galactic cosmic rays: particles coming from outside the Solar System, set in motion by faraway supernovas or neutron stars. These are relatively rare but are coming at you all the time from all directions. They also have high energies, starting at 200 MeV and going to several GeVs, which makes them extremely penetrating. Thick masses don’t provide much shielding against them. When high-energy cosmic ray particles hit thin shields, they produce many lower-energy particles—you’d be better off with no shield at all.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>The particles with energies between 70 MeV and 500 MeV are responsible for 95 percent of the radiation dose that astronauts get in space. On short flights, solar storms are the main concern because they can be quite violent and do lots of damage very quickly. The longer you fly, though, GCRs become more of an issue because their dose accumulates over time, and they can go through pretty much everything we try to put in their way.</p>
<h2>What keeps us safe at home</h2>
<p>The reason nearly none of this radiation can reach us is that Earth has a natural, multi-stage shielding system. It begins with its magnetic field, which deflects most of the incoming particles toward the poles. A charged particle in a magnetic field follows a curve—the stronger the field, the tighter the curve. Earth’s magnetic field is very weak and barely bends incoming particles, but it is huge, extending thousands of kilometers into space.</p>
<p>Anything that makes it through the magnetic field runs into the atmosphere, which, when it comes to shielding, is the equivalent of an aluminum wall that's 3 meters thick. Finally, there is the planet itself, which essentially cuts the radiation in half since you always have 6.5 billion trillion tons of rock shielding you from the bottom.</p>
<p>To put that in perspective, the Apollo crew module had on average 5 grams of mass per square centimeter standing between the crew and radiation. A typical ISS module has twice that, about 10 g/cm2. The Orion shelter has 35–45 g/cm2, depending on where you sit exactly, and it weighs 36 tons. On Earth, the atmosphere alone gives you 810 g/cm2—roughly 20 times more than our best shielded spaceships.</p>
<p>The two options are to add more mass—which gets expensive quickly—or to shorten the length of the mission, which isn’t always possible. So solving radiation with passive mass won't cut it for longer missions, even using the best shielding materials like polyethylene or water. This is why making a miniaturized, portable version of the Earth’s magnetic field was on the table from the first days of space exploration. Unfortunately, we discovered it was far easier said than done.</p>

            <pubDate>Tue, 12 Mar 2024 07:31:06 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://bevyengine.org/news/bevy-foundation/">https://bevyengine.org/news/bevy-foundation/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39677009">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It is with excitement that I unveil to the world ...</p>
<p><img src="https://bevyengine.org/news/bevy-foundation/bevy_foundation.svg" alt="Bevy Foundation Logo"></p><p>The <a href="https://bevyengine.org/foundation"><strong>Bevy Foundation</strong></a> is the next step in our journey to build a world class free and open source game engine. <strong>Bevy Foundation</strong> is a non-profit organization formed in Washington State, with a pending federal 501(c)(3) tax-exemption application (more on this later).</p>
<p>This is a big step for us and it was not taken lightly. This will be a long blog post, so I'll cover the highlights here:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Bevy Foundation</strong> is largely a legal formalization of the leadership and operational structure we have already been using. The "Bevy leadership" that you know (and hopefully trust) is also at the helm of <strong>Bevy Foundation</strong>. The biggest difference is that power is distributed more evenly.</li>
<li>Nothing is fundamentally changing about how we build and release Bevy as free and open source software. This is <em>not</em> a business model rug-pull. It is a legal formalization of our mission to build and release Bevy as free and open source software to members of the general public (you!).</li>
<li>You can now <a href="https://bevyengine.org/donate">donate to the Bevy Foundation</a> to support us!</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="some-history">Some History
<a href="#some-history">#</a>
</h2>
<p>We have come such a long way since I first released Bevy to the world in 2020. What was once a one person side project is now built by hundreds of people and used by thousands (we recently broke a million downloads!). Bevy is the most popular, most used game engine built in Rust, and the second most popular open source game engine on GitHub.</p>
<p>I (Carter / @cart) am still Bevy's Project Lead, but I no longer make all of the decisions. For years now <a href="https://bevyengine.org/community/people">The Bevy Organization</a> has delegated decision making authority across members of the Bevy community. We have 5 excellent Maintainers and even more Subject Matter Experts that were each pivotal in making Bevy what it is today.</p>
<p>As we have grown, we have accumulated what I will call "organizational debt":</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Funding Bevy Has Been A Popularity Contest</strong>: For years, our donate button linked directly to my GitHub sponsors page. This was acceptable early on when I was the only one spending significant time on the project, but that is no longer the case. Last year, we replaced that with a page that any Bevy Organization member could list themselves on. While fairer than the "everything goes to @cart" model, it resulted in funding being a "popularity contest". And unfortunately, given how attached my name is to the project, in practice I still received the majority of the sponsorships. Presenting donors with the task of picking someone to back also deeply complicated the donation process, which likely turned some donors off. We need a simple, centralized donation model where we can direct funds fairly to the areas of the project that need them the most.</li>
<li><strong>We Lacked "Organizational Legitimacy"</strong>: We would like to attract the attention (and funding) of people and companies serious about gamedev. An informal collective of Bevy developers (each asking for support individually) lacks the legitimacy required to attract some entities. We need to be able to present a centralized and transparent view of our operations, with accountable and professional people at the helm.</li>
<li><strong>Carter Held (And Owned) The Keys</strong>: Up until this point, I have owned Bevy-related intellectual property such as the copyright for the Bevy logo. I also owned the <code>bevyengine.org</code> domain name and had exclusive administrative control over most of our infrastructure and communities. I have had absolute authority over all aspects of the project since its inception. Yes, I have delegated, but it all stemmed from me at the root. This had its efficiencies, but it is no longer sustainable for me or ethically sound when there are <em>so many</em> others that deserve actual <em>legal</em> say over how the project is run. There is also the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor">"bus factor"</a> to consider. If something were to happen to me, some aspects of the Bevy project would be lost forever.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bevy needs a structure that lets us work together: a legal entity that embodies our goals and principles, where responsibility and decision making are all shared.</p>

<a href="#introducing-the-bevy-foundation">#</a>
</h2>
<h3 id="our-mission">Our Mission
<a href="#our-mission">#</a>
</h3>
<p>To quote our 501(c)(3) application:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our mission is to promote, protect, and advance the free and open source Bevy Engine and related open source projects. We coordinate and promote its continued maintenance and development, educate and train members of the general public in its usage, and conduct research and development to advance the state of the art of creating real-time applications and simulations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In short: <strong>we exist to develop Bevy and teach people how to use it</strong>!</p>
<h3 id="legal-status">Legal Status
<a href="#legal-status">#</a>
</h3>
<p><a href="https://bevyengine.org/foundation"><strong>Bevy Foundation</strong></a> is a non-profit incorporated in Washington State. This means that the money we raise <a href="https://dor.wa.gov/education/industry-guides/nonprofit-organizations#Fundraising">cannot be used to benefit our members, officers, or directors, except as compensation for services rendered</a>. We do not have "owners" or "shareholders". We are formed exclusively to accomplish our mission as stated above as a public benefit.</p>
<h3 id="federal-501-c-3-application">Federal 501(c)(3) Application
<a href="#federal-501-c-3-application">#</a>
</h3>
<p>We have also applied for a federal 501(c)(3) non-profit public charity designation.</p>
<p>If our 501(c)(3) application is accepted, this status will exempt us from federal income tax and allow donors in the United States to deduct their donations on their federal taxes.</p>
<p>Note that the 501(c)(3) application has not yet been approved, and there has been an increasing number of denials for technology-oriented charities. The experts we have talked to have told us not to get our hopes up.</p>
<p>If we are denied, our default strategy will be to continue operating as a state-only charity and pay federal taxes. As long as we spend most of the donations we receive, the taxes shouldn't be too painful. We may also consider other designations, such as 501(c)(6), but we are cautious about that designation. We want to focus on the members of the Bevy community as people, not through the lens of their commercial interests.</p>
<p>If tax-deductibility is important to you, <em>please do not donate until we receive a determination</em>. But also note that if our application is accepted, donations made <em>prior</em> to our acceptance will <em>retroactively</em> be tax-deductible! Neat!</p>
<h3 id="the-board-of-directors">The Board of Directors
<a href="#the-board-of-directors">#</a>
</h3>
<p>We are run by the <strong>Bevy Foundation</strong> Board of Directors. All actions taken by <strong>Bevy Foundation</strong> are determined by a vote of the board.</p>
<p>The current Board of Directors is: Carter Anderson (@cart), Alice Cecile (@alice-i-cecile), François Mockers (@mockersf), Robert Swain (@superdump), and James Liu (@james7132).</p>
<p>I have been elected President of the board and Alice has been elected Secretary. For logistical reasons, I have also been elected interim Treasurer to get our initial financial situation spun up. It makes sense for a US-based board member to set up things like bank accounts for a US-based organization. But we would like to pass off the role of Treasurer as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>You may notice that every member of the board is an active Bevy Maintainer. This is not a coincidence. We believe that people <em>actually developing the project</em> should be at the helm. There is currently no way to buy a board seat. We have no plans to hire "professional board members" that aren't in the thick of it. For now we plan to stick to the Maintainer == Board Member policy. Functionally, new Board Members are selected via an election of the current board. "Board Member" is currently not a paid position.</p>
<p>Note that I am using the phrasing "currently" and "for now" in some places above because I am <em>no longer capable of making absolute statements about the future of the project</em>. I am a board member, which gives me a vote. And as President I have been given some authority by the board to manage our operations. But I must follow the resolutions of the board and I <em>can</em> be voted out. This is a good thing I promise! It means that the project can exist without me. And if I am no longer fulfilling my duties to the satisfaction of the board, I probably <em>should</em> be ousted.</p>
<p>This is a leap of faith, but one that has been carefully measured over the course of years. I have worked with the other maintainers (now board members) for a long time now and I trust them ... both with the future of Bevy and with my job.</p>
<h3 id="bylaws">Bylaws
<a href="#bylaws">#</a>
</h3>
<p>We have adopted public <a href="https://bevyengine.org/foundation/bylaws">Bylaws</a> that govern how we operate. They determine how we are structured, the roles in the organization, how meetings and voting take place, a conflict of interest policy, and more. Note these are largely borrowed from the standard legal boilerplate (and they exist for a legal purpose), so they're stiffer than our normal style.</p>
<h3 id="transparency">Transparency
<a href="#transparency">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Our goal is to make the operations of <strong>Bevy Foundation</strong> as transparent as possible. We make the following public:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://bevyengine.org/foundation/bylaws"><strong>Bylaws</strong></a>: The operational rules we have adopted</li>

<p>We will strive to be approachable and accountable for our actions, and we will continue to make our technical decisions in public with the input of the community. You know who we are and where to find us!</p>
<h2 id="our-plans">Our Plans
<a href="#our-plans">#</a>
</h2>
<p><strong>Bevy Foundation</strong> will direct the majority of its funding to fueling Bevy development.</p>
<h3 id="short-term-bring-alice-on-full-time">Short Term: Bring Alice on full-time
<a href="#short-term-bring-alice-on-full-time">#</a>
</h3>
<p>We have exactly one focus for the short term: bring Alice on full-time. For years, Alice has dedicated <em>significant</em> time to the project as a Maintainer. She has been our primary project manager: wrangling issues, <a href="https://mastodon.social/deck/tags/bevymergetrain">keeping the merge train running</a>, connecting developers to the right parts of the project, and doing the work that ensures we can harness and enable our ever increasing developer community. Not to mention her extensive technical contributions and documentation work!</p>
<p>If you have participated in Bevy's development, you are probably intimately aware of two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Project management is our bottleneck.</li>
<li>Alice is a world-class project manager.</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition to performing the general "project management" role, Alice has the following specific priorities when she starts full-time:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The New Bevy Book</strong>: The new Bevy Book aims to be a complete, always up-to-date, and constantly improving guide to using Bevy. Alice has already contributed content and helped facilitate the book's production. If she joins full-time, she will work to finish it, in addition to helping others contribute.</li>
<li><strong>Coordinating the Development of ECS Relations</strong>: Relations are an ECS feature that enable connecting entities to each other via special components called Relations. These are an often-requested feature that will make a number of scenarios (such as parent-child relationships) much nicer. Alice will work to coordinate this effort and fill in functionality gaps.</li>
<li><strong>Building an Action System for Input Devices</strong>: Bevy sorely needs an official way to define "input actions", which are then mapped (and remapped) to inputs from one or more input devices (for example: a <code>Jump</code> action that is mapped to the "A" button on controllers and "Spacebar" on keyboards). Alice built <a href="https://github.com/leafwing-studios/leafwing-input-manager"><code>leafwing-input-manager</code></a>, which is a popular third-party Bevy plugin that does exactly that. Alice plans on taking the lessons learned there to build a proper first-party solution to this problem.</li>
</ol>
<p>Alice deserves to be paid for her work, and Bevy needs her full-time. Our goal for the <strong>Bevy Foundation</strong> is to pay reasonably competitive, roughly market rate salaries. Therefore, our first goal is to pay Alice a salary of $150,000 a year.</p>
<p>We all believe Alice is worth at least that much, but given that funds will take time to build up, Alice has agreed to take a pay cut while things spin up.</p>
<h4 id="what-about-carter">What about Carter?
<a href="#what-about-carter">#</a>
</h4>
<p>Some may ask why I (Carter), the creator and Project Lead of Bevy, am not the first to be paid by the <strong>Bevy Foundation</strong>. Thats easy: I already currently have enough support from my current sponsors to live on, and I have historically received the lion's share of sponsorships. The scales have been tilted in my favor for too long. Prioritizing Alice is the only fair choice, and also happens to be what is best for Bevy right now.</p>
<p>I suspect my current sponsors will transition to the <strong>Bevy Foundation</strong> over time (and I encourage them to do so!). As this happens there will likely be an inflection point where Alice is making more than me. When we hit that point, we will sort out a balancing strategy until we are both paid our target wages.</p>
<p>Note if we receive 501(c)(3) status (see the 501(c)(3) section above), we are allowed to pay competitive wages, but we can't pay <em>excessive</em> wages (nor are we <em>interested in doing so</em>). Once Alice and Carter are paid reasonable wages, we will shift our financial focus elsewhere.</p>
<h3 id="future-plans">Future Plans
<a href="#future-plans">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Our focus will always be on funding more Bevy developers, both full-time and part-time. We will likely explore targeted one time grants for specific efforts.</p>
<p>Later down the line, we will likely explore the development of a Bevy Asset store where the community can list and sell Bevy-compatible assets.</p>
<p>We would also like to re-introduce a Bevy Merch store. While we don't think this is an ideal fundraising strategy, we think it will be a fun way for the Bevy community to show their pride!</p>
<p>When we consider future programs, we will ask the questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is this compatible with the Bevy Foundation's mission?</li>
<li>Is this in the best interest of the Bevy community and the general public?</li>
<li>Will this compromise the integrity of Bevy as a free and open source offering in any way?</li>
<li>Will this change our incentives in a way that risks changing our answers to (1), (2), or (3)?</li>
<li>If we are monetizing something, are we doing it in an ethical way?</li>
</ol>
<p>Know that we exist <em>for the benefit of the Bevy community and the general public</em> and we will try our utmost to never compromise that.</p>
<h2 id="a-new-era">A New Era
<a href="#a-new-era">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The <strong>Bevy Foundation</strong> is both an accomplishment, as the culmination of months of work and research, and a Foundation, on top of which we will build the future of Bevy. We are building technology that will enrich the lives of everyone as a common, publicly available good. Game development is currently an industry of rent seekers and gatekeepers. I believe that a better world can exist: one where we collectively build tools <em>for each other</em> in the open. Bevy is ideologically and technologically a rethinking of what this industry should be.</p>
<p>I am deeply proud of what we have accomplished so far and I can't wait for what this new Bevy era will bring.</p>
<h2 id="we-need-your-support">We Need Your Support!
<a href="#we-need-your-support">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Bevy will always be free and open source. However our plans for Bevy's future are grand ... they will require significant financial support. Please consider donating if you enjoy using Bevy and believe in our mission.</p>
<p>If we receive 501(c)(3) public charity status, to maintain that status we will require a significant portion of our funds to come from individual people (not just companies). Your contribution matters!</p>
<p>If you are already supporting us through individual sponsorships, consider switching your donation to <strong>Bevy Foundation</strong>, as that will make it easier for us to direct your contribution to the areas that need it most.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>Recently, I got a new laptop and had to set it up so I could start using it. But I wasn't really in the mood to go through the same old steps which I had explained in this <a href="https://copyninja.in/blog/live_install_debian.html">post earlier</a>. I was complaining about this to my colleague, and there came the suggestion of why not copy the entire disk to the new laptop. Though it sounded like an interesting idea to me, I had my doubts, so here is what I told him in return.</p><ol><li>I don't have the tools to open my old laptop and connect the new disk over USB to my new laptop.</li><li>I use full disk encryption, and my old laptop has a 512GB disk, whereas the new laptop has a 1TB NVME, and I'm not so familiar with resizing LUKS.</li></ol><p>He promptly suggested both could be done. For step 1, just expose the disk using NVME over TCP and connect it over the network and do a full disk copy, and the rest is pretty simple to achieve. In short, he suggested the following:</p><ol><li>Export the disk using nvmet-tcp from the old laptop.</li><li>Do a disk copy to the new laptop.</li><li>Resize the partition to use the full 1TB.</li><li>Resize LUKS.</li><li>Finally, resize the BTRFS root disk.</li></ol><div id="exporting-disk-over-nvme-tcp"><h2>Exporting Disk over NVME TCP</h2><p>The easiest way suggested by my colleague to do this is using <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd-storagetm.service.html">systemd-storagetm.service</a>. This service can be invoked by simply booting into <em>storage-target-mode.target</em> by specifying <em>rd.systemd.unit=storage-target-mode.target</em>. But he suggested not to use this as I need to tweak the dracut initrd image to involve network services as well as configuring WiFi from this mode is a painful thing to do.</p><p>So alternatively, I simply booted both my laptops with GRML rescue CD. And the following step was done to export the NVME disk on my current laptop using the nvmet-tcp module of Linux:</p><div><pre><span></span>modprobe<span> </span>nvemt-tcp

ln<span> </span>-s<span> </span><span>"../../subsystems/testnqn"</span><span> </span>/sys/kernel/config/nvmet/ports/0/subsystems/testnqn
</pre></div><p>These steps ensure that the device is now exported using NVME over TCP. The next step is to detect this on the new laptop and connect the device:</p><div><pre><span></span>nvme<span> </span>discover<span> </span>-t<span> </span>tcp<span> </span>-a<span> </span>&lt;ip&gt;<span> </span>-s<span> </span><span>4420</span>

</pre></div><p>Finally, <tt>nvme list</tt> shows the device which is connected to the new laptop, and we can proceed with the next step, which is to do the disk copy.</p></div><div id="copying-the-disk"><h2>Copying the Disk</h2><p>I simply used the <tt>dd</tt> command to copy the root disk to my new laptop. Since the new laptop didn't have an Ethernet port, I had to rely only on WiFi, and it took about 7 and a half hours to copy the entire 512GB to the new laptop. The speed at which I was copying was about 18-20MB/s. The other option would have been to create an initial partition and file system and do an rsync of the root disk or use BTRFS itself for file system transfer.</p><div><pre><span></span>dd<span> </span><span>if</span><span>=</span>/dev/nvme2n1<span> </span><span>of</span><span>=</span>/dev/nvme0n1<span> </span><span>status</span><span>=</span>progress<span> </span><span>bs</span><span>=</span>40M

Next, I had to install <tt><span>cloud-guest-utils</span></tt> to get <tt>growpart</tt> to fix the second partition, and the following command extended the partition to the full 1TB:</p><p>Next, I used <tt><span>cryptsetup-resize</span></tt> to increase the LUKS container size.</p><div><pre><span></span>cryptsetup<span> </span>luksOpen<span> </span>/dev/nvme0n1p2<span> </span>ENC

</pre></div><p>Finally, I rebooted into the disk, and everything worked fine. After logging into the system, I resized the BTRFS file system. BTRFS requires the system to be mounted for resize, so I could not attempt it in live boot.</p><div><pre><span></span>btfs<span> </span>fielsystem<span> </span>resize<span> </span>max<span> </span>/
</pre></div></div><div id="conclussion"><h2>Conclussion</h2><p>The only benefit of this entire process is that I have a new laptop, but I still feel like I'm using my existing laptop. Typically, setting up a new laptop takes about a week or two to completely get adjusted, but in this case, that entire time is saved.</p><p>An added benefit is that I learned how to export disks using NVME over TCP, thanks to my colleague. This new knowledge adds to the value of the experience.</p></div></div></div>]]></description>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong><em>Scope.</em></strong><em> To talk about C++’s current safety problems and solutions well, I need to include the context of the broad landscape of security and safety threats facing all software. I chair the ISO C++ standards committee and I work for Microsoft, but these are my personal opinions and I hope they will invite more dialog across programming language and security communities.</em></em></p>



<p><strong><em>Acknowledgments. </em></strong><em>Many thanks to people from the C, C++, C#, Python, Rust, MITRE, and other language and security communities whose feedback on drafts of this material has been invaluable, including: Jean-François Bastien, Joe Bialek, Andrew Lilley Brinker, Jonathan Caves, Gabriel Dos Reis, Daniel Frampton, Tanveer Gani, Daniel Griffing, Russell Hadley, Mark Hall, Tom Honermann, Michael Howard, Marian Luparu, Ulzii Luvsanbat, Rico Mariani, Chris McKinsey, Bogdan Mihalcea, Roger Orr, Robert Seacord, Bjarne Stroustrup, Mads Torgersen, Guido van Rossum, Roy Williams, Michael Wong.</em></p>



<p><strong><em>Terminology <em>(see </em><a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/76517.html"><em>ISO/IEC 23643:2020</em></a><em>)</em>.</em></strong><em> “<strong>Software security</strong>” (or “cybersecurity” or similar) means making software able to protect its assets from a malicious attacker. “<strong>Software safety</strong>” (or “life safety” or similar) means making software free from unacceptable risk of causing unintended harm to humans, property, or the environment.  “<strong>Programming language safety</strong>” means a language’s (including its standard libraries’) static and dynamic guarantees, including but not limited to type and memory safety, which helps us make our software both more secure and more safe. When I say <strong>“safety”</strong> unqualified here, I mean programming language safety, which benefits both software security and software safety.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>We must make our software infrastructure more secure against the rise in cyberattacks (such as on power grids, hospitals, and banks), and safer against accidental failures with the increased use of software in life-critical systems (such as autonomous vehicles and autonomous weapons).</p>



<p>The past two years in particular have seen extra attention on programming language safety as a way to help build more-secure and -safe software; on the real benefits of memory-safe languages (MSLs); and that C and C++ language safety needs to improve — I agree.</p>



<p>But there have been misconceptions, too, including focusing too narrowly on programming language safety as our industry’s primary security and safety problem — it isn’t. Many of the most damaging recent security breaches happened to code written in MSLs (e.g., <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/apache-log4j-vulnerability-guidance">Log4j</a>) or had nothing to do with programming languages (e.g., <a href="https://blog.aquasec.com/the-ticking-supply-chain-attack-bomb-of-exposed-kubernetes-secrets">Kubernetes Secrets stored on public GitHub repos</a>).</p>



<p>In that context, I’ll focus on C++ and try to:</p>

<ul>
<li>highlight what needs attention (what C++’s problem “is”), and how we can get there by building on solutions already underway;</li>



<li>address some common misconceptions (what C++’s problem “isn’t”), including practical considerations of MSLs; and</li>



<li>leave a call to action for programmers using all &nbsp;languages.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> I don’t want C++ to limit what I can express efficiently. I just want C++ to let me enforce our already-well-known safety rules and best practices by default, and make me opt out explicitly if that’s what I want. Then I can still use fully modern C++… just nicer.</p>



<p>Let’s dig in.</p>



<h2>The immediate problem “is” that it’s Too Easy By Default™ to write security and safety vulnerabilities in C++ that would have been caught by stricter enforcement of known rules for <em>type, bounds, initialization, </em>and<em> lifetime</em> language safety</h2>

<p><strong>In C++, we need to start with improving these four categories. </strong>These are the main four sources of improvement provided by all the MSLs that NIST/NSA/CISA/etc. recommend using instead of C++ (<a href="https://media.defense.gov/2023/Dec/06/2003352724/-1/-1/0/THE-CASE-FOR-MEMORY-SAFE-ROADMAPS-TLP-CLEAR.PDF">example</a>), so by definition addressing these four would address the immediate NIST/NSA/CISA/etc. issues with C++. (More on this under “The problem ‘isn’t’… (1)” below.)</p>



<p>And in all recent years including 2023 (see figures 1’s four highlighted rows, and figure 2), these four constitute the bulk of those oft-quoted 70% of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures">CVEs</a> (Common [Security] Vulnerabilities and Exposures) related to language memory unsafety. (However, that “70% of language memory unsafety CVEs” is misleading; for example, in figure 1, most of <a href="https://cwe.mitre.org/top25/archive/2023/2023_top25_list.html#tableView">MITRE’s 2023 “most dangerous weaknesses”</a> did not involve language safety and so are outside that denominator. More on this under “The problem ‘isn’t’… (3)” below.)</p>

<p><strong>The C++ guidance literature already broadly agrees on safety rules in those categories. </strong>It’s true that there is some conflicting guidance literature, particularly in environments that ban exceptions or run-time type support and so use some alternative rules. But there is consensus on core safety rules, such as banning unsafe casts, uninitialized variables, and out-of-bounds accesses (see Appendix).</p>



<p><strong><strong>C++ should provide a way to enforce them by default, and require explicit opt-out where needed.</strong></strong> We can and do write “good” code and secure applications in C++. But it’s easy even for experienced C++ developers to accidentally write “bad” code and security vulnerabilities that C++ silently accepts, and that would be rejected as safety violations in other languages. We need the standard language to help more by enforcing the known best practices, rather than relying on additional nonstandard tools to recommend them.</p>



<p><strong>These are not the only four aspects of language safety we should address.</strong> They are just the immediate ones, a set of clear low-hanging fruit where there is both a clear need and clear way to improve (see Appendix).</p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong><em> And safety categories are of course interrelated. For example, full type safety (that an accessed object is a valid object of its type) requires eliminating out-of-bounds accesses to unallocated objects. But, conversely, full bounds safety (that accessed memory is inside allocated bounds) similarly requires eliminating type-unsafe downcasts to larger derived-type objects that would appear to extend beyond the actual allocation.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p><strong>Software safety is also important.</strong> Cyberattacks are urgent, so it’s natural that recent discussions have focused more on security and CVEs first. But as we specify and evolve default language safety rules, we must also include our stakeholders who care deeply about functional safety issues that are not reflected in the major CVE buckets but are just as harmful to life and property when left in code. Programming language safety helps both software security and software safety, and we should start somewhere, so let’s start (but not end) with the known pain points of security CVEs.</p>



<h3>In those four buckets, a 10-50x improvement (90-98% reduction) is sufficient</h3>



<p><strong>If there were 90-98% fewer C++ type/bounds/initialization/lifetime vulnerabilities we wouldn’t be having this discussion.</strong> All languages have CVEs, C++ just has more (and C still more); so far in 2024, <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=rust">Rust has 6 CVEs</a>, and <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=c++">C and C++ combined have 61 CVEs</a>. So zero isn’t the goal; something like a 90% reduction is necessary, and a 98% reduction is sufficient, to achieve security parity with the levels of language safety provided by MSLs… and has the strong benefit that I believe it can be achieved with <em>perfect backward link compatibility</em> (i.e., without changing C++’s object model, and its lifetime model which does not depend on universal tracing garbage collection and is not limited to tree-based data structures) which is essential to our being able to adopt the improvements in existing C++ projects as easily as we can adopt other new editions of C++. — After that, we can pursue additional improvements to other buckets, such as thread safety and overflow safety.</p>



<p>Aiming for 100%, or zero CVEs in those four buckets, would be a mistake:</p>



<ul>
<li>100% is not necessary because none of the MSLs we’re being told to use instead are there either. More on this in “The problem ‘isn’t’… (2)” below.</li>



<li>100% is not sufficient because many cyberattacks exploit security weaknesses other than memory safety.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>And getting that last 2% would be too costly</strong>, because it would require giving up on link compatibility and seamless interoperability (or “interop”) with today’s C++ code. For example, Rust’s object model and borrow checker deliver great guarantees, but require fundamental incompatibility with C++ and so make interop hard beyond the usual C interop level. One reason is that Rust’s safe language pointers are limited to expressing tree-shaped data structures that have no cycles; that unique ownership is essential to having great language-enforced aliasing guarantees, but it also requires programmers to use ‘something else’ for anything more complex than a tree (e.g., using Rc, or using integer indexes as ersatz pointers); it’s not just about <a href="https://rust-unofficial.github.io/too-many-lists/">linked lists</a> but those are a simple well-known illustrative example.</p>



<p>If we can get a 98% improvement and still have fully compatible interop with existing C++, that would be a holy grail worth serious investment.</p>



<h3>A 98% reduction across those four categories is achievable in new/updated C++ code, and partially in existing code</h3>



<p>Since at least 2014, Bjarne Stroustrup has advocated addressing safety in C++ via a “subset of a superset”: That is, first “superset” to add essential items not available in C++14, then “subset” to exclude the unsafe constructs that now all have replacements.</p>



<p><strong>As of C++20, I believe we have achieved the “superset,” notably by standardizing </strong><strong>span</strong><strong>, </strong><strong>string_view</strong><strong>, concepts, and bounds-aware ranges. </strong>We may still want a handful more features, such as a null-terminated zstring_view, but the major additions already exist.</p>



<p><strong>Now we should “subset”: Enable C++ programmers to enforce best practices around type and memory safety, by default, in new code and code they can update to confirm to the subset.</strong> Enabling safety rules by default would not limit the language’s power but would require explicit opt-outs for non-standard practices, thereby reducing inadvertent risks. And it could be evolved over time, which is important because C++ is a living language and adversaries will keep changing their attacks.</p>



<p>ISO C++ evolution is already pursuing <a href="https://open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG21/docs/papers/2023/p2816r0.pdf">Safety Profiles for C++</a>. The suggestions in the Appendix are refinements to that, to demonstrate specific enforcements and to try to maximize their adoptability and useful impact. For example, everyone agrees that many safety bugs will require code changes to fix. However, how many safety bugs could be fixed without manual source code changes, so that just recompiling existing code with safety profiles enabled delivers some safety benefits? For example, we could by default inject a call-site bounds check 0 &lt;= b &lt; a.size() on every subscript expression a[b] when a.size() exists and a is a contiguous container, without requiring any source code changes and without upgrading to a new internally bounds-checked container library; that checking would Just Work out of the box with every contiguous C++ standard container, span, string_view, and third-party custom container with no library updates needed (including therefore also no concern about ABI breakage).</p>



<p><strong>Rules like those summarized in the Appendix would have prevented (at compile time, test time or run time) most of the past CVEs I’ve reviewed in the type, bounds, and initialization categories, and would have prevented many of the lifetime CVEs. </strong>I estimate a roughly 98% reduction in those categories is achievable in a well-defined and standardized way for C++ to enable safety rules by default and retains perfect backward link compatibility.&nbsp;See the Appendix for a more detailed description.</p>



<p><strong>We can and should emphasize adoptability and benefit also for C++ code that cannot easily be changed. </strong>Any code change to conform to safety rules carries a cost; worse, not all code can be easily updated to conform to safety rules (e.g., it’s old and not understood, it belongs to a third party that won’t allow updates, it belongs to a shared project that won’t take upstream changes and can’t easily be forked). That’s why above (and in the Appendix) I stress that C++ should seriously try to deliver as many of the safety improvements as practical without requiring manual source code changes, notably by automatically making existing code do the right thing when that is clear (e.g., the bounds checks mentioned above, or emitting static_cast pointer downcasts as effectively dynamic_cast without requiring the code to be changed), and by offering automated fixits that the programmer can choose to apply (e.g., to change the source for static_cast pointer downcasts to actually say dynamic_cast). Even though in many cases a programmer will need to thoughtfully update code to replace inherently unsafe constructs that can’t be automatically fixed, I believe for some percentage of cases we can deliver safety improvements by just recompiling existing code in the safety-rules-by-default mode, and we should try because it’s essential to maximizing safety profiles’ adoptability and impact.</p>



<h2>What the problem “isn’t”: Some common misconceptions</h2>



<h3>(1) The problem “isn’t” defining what we mean by “C++’s most urgent language safety problem.” We know the four kinds of safety that most urgently need to be improved: type, bounds, initialization, and lifetime safety.</h3>



<p>We know these four are the low-hanging fruit (see “The problem ‘is’…” above). It’s true that these are just four of perhaps two dozen kinds of “safety” categories, including ones like safe integer arithmetic. But:</p>



<ul>
<li>Most of the others are either much smaller sources of problems, or are primarily important because they contribute to those four main categories. For example, the integer overflows we care most about are indexes and sizes, which fall under bounds safety.</li>



<li>Most MSLs don’t address making these safe by default either, typically due to the checking cost. But all languages (including C++) usually have libraries and tools to address them. For example, Microsoft ships a <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/safeint/safeint-library?view=msvc-170">SafeInt library</a> for C++ to handle integer overflows, which is opt-in. C# has a <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/statements/checked-and-unchecked">checked arithmetic language feature</a> to handle integer overflows, which is opt-in. Python’s built-in integers are overflow-safe by default because they automatically expand; however, the popular NumPy fixed-size integer types do not check for overflow by default and require using checked functions, which is opt-in.</li>
</ul>



<p>Thread safety is obviously important too, and I’m not ignoring it. I’m just pointing out that it is not one of the top target buckets: Most of the MSLs that NIST/NSA/CISA/etc. recommend over C++ (except uniquely Rust, and to a lesser extent Python) address thread safety impact on <em>user</em> <em>data</em> corruption about as well as C++. The main improvement MSLs give is that a program data race will not corrupt the language’s own <em>virtual machine</em> (whereas in C++ a data race is currently all-bets-are-off undefined behavior). Some languages do give some additional protection, such as that Python guarantees two racing threads cannot see a torn write of an integer and reduces other possible interleavings because of the global interpreter lock (GIL).</p>



<h3>(2) The problem “isn’t” that C++ code is not formally provably safe.</h3>



<p>Yes, C++ code makes it too easy to write silently-unsafe code by default (see “The problem ‘is’…” above).</p>



<p>But I’ve seen some people claim we need to require languages to be formally provably safe, and that would be a bridge too far. Much to the chagrin of CS theorists, mainstream commercial programming languages aren’t formally provably safe. Consider some examples:</p>



<ul>
<li>None of the widely-used languages we view as MSLs (except uniquely Rust) claim to be thread-safe and race-free by construction, as covered in the previous section. Yet we still call C#, Go, Java, Python, and similar languages “safe.” Therefore, formally guaranteeing thread safety properties can’t be a requirement to be considered a sufficiently safe language.</li>



<li>That’s because a language’s choice of safety guarantees is a tradeoff: For example, in Rust, safe code uses tree-based dynamic data structures only. This feature lets Rust deliver stronger thread safety guarantees than other safe languages, because it can more easily reason about and control aliasing. However, this same feature also requires Rust programs to use unsafe code more often to represent common data structures that do not require unsafe code to represent in other MSLs such as C# or Java, and so <a href="https://thenewstack.io/unsafe-rust-in-the-wild/">30% to 50% of Rust crates use unsafe code</a>, compared for example to <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2814270.2814313">25% of Java libraries</a>.</li>



<li>C#, Java, and other MSLs still have use-before-initialized and use-after-destroyed type safety problems too: They guarantee not accessing <em>memory</em> outside its allocated lifetime, but <em>object</em> lifetime is a subset of memory lifetime (objects are constructed after, and destroyed/disposed before, the raw memory is allocated and deallocated; before construction and after dispose, the memory is allocated but contains “raw bits” that likely don’t represent a valid object of its type). <strong>If you doubt, please run (don’t walk) and ask ChatGPT</strong> about Java and C# problems with: access-unconstructed-object bugs (e.g., in those languages, any virtual call in a constructor is “deep” and executes in a derived object before the derived object’s state is initialized); use-after-dispose bugs; “resurrection” bugs; and why those languages tell people never to use their finalizers. Yet these are great languages and we rightly consider them safe languages. Therefore, formally guaranteeing no-use-before-initialized and no-use-after-dispose can’t be a requirement to be considered a sufficiently safe language.</li>



<li>Rust, Go, and other languages <a href="https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/sanitizers.html">support sanitizers</a> too, including ThreadSanitizer and <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/miri">undefined behavior sanitizers</a>, and related tools like fuzzers. Sanitizers are known to be still needed as a complement to language safety, and not only for when programmers use ‘unsafe’ code; furthermore, they go beyond finding memory safety issues. The uses of Rust at scale that I know of also enforce use of sanitizers. So using sanitizers can’t be an indicator that a language is unsafe — we should use the supported sanitizers for code written in any language.</li>
</ul>



<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> “Use your sanitizers” does not mean to use all of them all the time. Some sanitizers conflict with each other, so you can only use those one at a time. Some sanitizers are expensive, so they should only be run periodically. Some sanitizers should not be run in production, including because their presence can create new security vulnerabilities.</p>
</blockquote>



<h3>(3) The problem “isn’t” that moving the world’s C and C++ code to memory-safe languages (MSLs) would eliminate 70% of security vulnerabilities.</h3>



<p>MSLs are wonderful! They just aren’t a silver bullet.</p>



<p><a href="https://alexgaynor.net/2020/may/27/science-on-memory-unsafety-and-security/">An oft-quoted number</a> is that “70%” of <em>programming language-caused</em> CVEs (reported security vulnerabilities) in C and C++ code are due to language safety problems. That number is true and repeatable, but has been badly misinterpreted in the press: No security expert I know believes that if we could wave a magic wand and instantly transform all the world’s code to MSLs, that we’d have 70% fewer CVEs, data breaches, and ransomware attacks. (For example, see <a href="https://www.horizon3.ai/analysis-of-2023s-known-exploited-vulnerabilities/">this February 2024 example analysis paper</a>.)</p>



<p>Consider some reasons.</p>



<ul>
<li>That 70% is of the <em>subset</em> of security CVEs that can be addressed by programming language safety. See figure 1 again: Most of 2023’s top 10 “most dangerous software weaknesses” were not related to memory safety. Many of 2023’s largest data breaches and other cyberattacks and cybercrime had nothing to do with programming languages at all. In 2023, attackers reduced their use of malware because software is getting hardened and endpoint protection is effective (<a href="https://www.crn.com/news/security/10-major-cyberattacks-and-data-breaches-in-2023">CRN</a>), and attackers go after the slowest animal in the herd. Most of the issues listed in <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2021/NIST.IR.8397.pdf">NISTIR-8397</a> affect all languages equally, as they go beyond memory safety (e.g., <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/apache-log4j-vulnerability-guidance">Log4j</a>) or even programming languages (e.g., automated testing, hardcoded secrets, enabling OS protections, string/SQL injections, software bills of materials). For more detail see the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/code-quality/build-reliable-secure-programs?view=msvc-170">Microsoft response to NISTIR-8397</a>, for which I was the editor. (More on this in the Call to Action.)</li>



<li>MSLs get CVEs too, though definitely fewer (again, e.g., <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/apache-log4j-vulnerability-guidance">Log4j</a>). For example, see <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=rust">MITRE list of Rust CVEs</a>, including six so far in 2024. And all programs use unsafe code; for example, see the <em>Conclusions</em> section of <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344892072_On_the_use_of_C_Unsafe_Code_Context_An_Empirical_Study_of_Stack_Overflow">Firouzi et al.</a>’s study of uses of C#’s unsafe on StackOverflow and prevalence of vulnerabilities, and that all programs eventually call trusted native libraries or operating system code.</li>



<li>Saying the quiet part out loud: CVEs are known to be an imprecise metric. We use it because it’s the metric we have, at least for security vulnerabilities, but we should use it with care. This may surprise you, as it did me, because we hear a lot about CVEs. But whenever I’ve suggested improvements for C++ and measuring “success” via a reduction in CVEs (including in this essay), security experts insist to me that CVEs aren’t a great metric to use… including the same experts who had previously quoted the 70% CVE number to me. — Reasons why CVEs aren’t a great metric include that CVEs are self-reported and often self-selected, and not all are equally exploitable; but there can be pressure to report a bug as a vulnerability even if there’s no reasonable exploit because of the benefits of getting one’s name on a CVE. In August 2023, the <a href="https://www.cve.org/Media/News/item/news/2023/08/29/Python-Software-Foundation-Added-as-CNA">Python Software Foundation became a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA)</a> for Python and pip distributions, and now has more control over Python and pip CVEs. The C++ community has not done so.</li>



<li>CVEs target only software security vulnerabilities (cyberattacks and intrusions), and we also need to consider software safety (life-critical systems and unintended harm to humans).</li>
</ul>



<h3>(4) The problem “isn’t” that C++ programmers aren’t trying hard enough / using the existing tools well enough. The challenge is making it easier to enable them.</h3>



<p>Today, the mitigations and tools we do have for C++ code are an uneven mix, and all are off-by-default:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Kind.</strong> They are a mix of static tools, dynamic tools, compiler switches, libraries, and language features.</li>



<li><strong>Acquisition.</strong> They are acquired in a mix of ways: in-the-box in the C++ compiler, optional downloads, third-party products, and some you need to google around to discover.</li>



<li><strong>Accuracy.</strong> Existing rulesets mix rules with low and high false positives. The latter are effectively unadoptable by programmers, and their presence makes it difficult to “just adopt this whole set of rules.”</li>



<li><strong>Determinism.</strong> Some rules, such as ones that rely on interprocedural analysis of full call trees, are inherently nondeterministic (because an implementation gives up when fully evaluating a case exceeds the space and time available; a.k.a. “best effort” analysis). This means that two implementations of the identical rule can give different answers for identical code (and therefore nondeterministic rules are also not portable, see below).</li>



<li><strong>Efficiency.</strong> Existing rulesets mix rules with low and high (and sometimes impossible) cost to diagnose. The rules that are not efficient enough to implement in the compiler will always be relegated to optional standalone tools.</li>



<li><strong>Portability.</strong> Not all rules are supported by all vendors. “Conforms to ISO/IEC 14882 (Standard C++)” is the only thing every C++ tool vendor supports portably.</li>
</ul>



<p>To address all these points, I think we need the C++ standard to specify a mode of well-agreed and low-or-zero-false-positive deterministic rules that are sufficiently low-cost to implement in-the-box at build time.</p>

<p>As an industry generally, we must make a major improvement in programming language memory safety — and we will.</p>



<p>In C++ specifically, we should first target the four key safety categories that are our perennial empirical attack points (type, bounds, initialization, and lifetime safety), and drive vulnerabilities in these four areas down to the noise for new/updated C++ code — and we can.</p>



<p>But we must also recognize that programming language safety is not a silver bullet to achieve cybersecurity and software safety. It’s one battle (not even the biggest) in a long war: Whenever we harden one part of our systems and make that more expensive to attack, attackers always switch to the next slowest animal in the herd. Many of 2023’s worst data breaches did not involve malware, but were caused by inadequately stored credentials (e.g., <a href="https://blog.aquasec.com/the-ticking-supply-chain-attack-bomb-of-exposed-kubernetes-secrets">Kubernetes Secrets</a> on public GitHub repos), misconfigured servers (e.g., <a href="https://cybernews.com/security/darkbeam-data-leak/#google_vignette">DarkBeam</a>, <a href="https://cybernews.com/security/kidsecurity-parental-control-data-leak/">Kid Security</a>), lack of testing, supply chain vulnerabilities, social engineering, and other problems that are independent of programming languages. <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/pdfs/The-Continued-Threat-to-Personal-Data-Key-Factors-Behind-the-2023-Increase.pdf">Apple’s white paper</a> about 2023’s rise in cybercrime emphasizes improving the handling, not of program code, but of the data: “it’s imperative that organizations consider limiting the amount of personal data they store in readable format while making a greater effort to protect the sensitive consumer data that they do store [including by using] end-to-end [E2E] encryption.”</p>



<p>No matter what programming language we use, security hygiene is essential:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Do</strong> use your language’s static analyzers and sanitizers. Never pretend using static analyzers and sanitizers is unnecessary “because I’m using a safe language.” If you’re using C++, Go, or Rust, then use those languages’ supported analyzers and sanitizers. If you’re a manager, don’t allow your product to be shipped without using these tools. (Again: This doesn’t mean running all sanitizers all the time; some sanitizers conflict and so can’t be used at the same time, some are expensive and so should be used periodically, and some should be run only in testing and never in production including because their presence can create new security vulnerabilities.)</li>



<li><strong>Do</strong> keep all your tools updated. Regular patching is not just for iOS and Windows, but also for your compilers, libraries, and IDEs.</li>



<li><strong>Do</strong> secure your software supply chain. <strong>Do</strong> use package management for library dependencies. <strong>Do</strong> track a software bill of materials for your projects.</li>



<li><strong>Don’t</strong> store secrets in code. (Or, for goodness’ sake, on GitHub!)</li>



<li><strong>Do</strong> configure your servers correctly, especially public Internet-facing ones. (Turn authentication on! Change the default password!)</li>



<li><strong>Do</strong> keep non-public data encrypted, both when at rest (on disk) and when in motion (ideally E2E… and oppose proposed legislation that tries to neuter E2E encryption with ‘backdoors only good guys will use’ because there’s no such thing).</li>



<li><strong>Do</strong> keep investing long-term in keeping your threat modeling current, so that you can stay adaptive as your adversaries keep trying different attack methods.</li>

<p>We need to improve software security and software safety across the industry, especially by improving programming language safety in C and C++, and in C++ a 98% improvement in the four most common problem areas is achievable in the medium term. But if we focus on programming language safety alone, we may find ourselves fighting yesterday’s war and missing larger past and future security dangers that affect software written in any language.</p>



<p>Sadly, there are too many bad actors. For the foreseeable future, our software and data will continue to be under attack, written in any language and stored anywhere. But we can defend our programs and systems, and we will.</p>



<p>Be well, and may we all keep working to have a safer and more secure 2024.</p>

<h2>Appendix: Illustrating why a 98% reduction is feasible</h2>



<p>This Appendix exists to support why I think a 98% reduction in type/bounds/initialization/lifetime CVEs in C++ code is believable. This is not a formal proposal, but an overview of concrete ways to achieve such an improvement it in new and updatable code, and ways to even get some fraction of that improvement in existing code we cannot update but can recompile. These notes are aligned with the proposals currently being pursued in the ISO C++ safety subgroup, and if they pan out as I expect in ongoing discussions and experiments, then I intend to write further details about them in a future paper.</p>



<p>There are runtime and code size overheads to some of the suggestions in all four buckets, notably checking bounds and casts. But there is no reason to think those overheads need to be inherently worse in C++ than other languages, and we can make them on by default and still provide a way to opt out to regain full performance where needed.</p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> For example, bounds checking can cause a major impact on some hot loops, when using a compiler whose optimizer does not hoist bounds checks; not only can the loops incur redundant checking, but they also may not get other optimizations such as not being vectorized. This is why making bounds-checking on by default is good, but all performance-oriented languages also need to provide a way to say “trust me” and explicitly opt out of bounds checking tactically where needed.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This appendix refers to the “profiles” in the <a href="https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#S-profile">C++ Core Guidelines safety profiles</a>, a set of about two dozen enforceable rules for type and memory safety of which I am a coauthor. I refer to them only as examples, to show “what” already-known rules exist that we can enforce, to support that my claimed improvement is possible. They are broadly consistent with rules in other sources, such as: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/C-Programming-Language-4th/dp/0321563840"><em>The C++ Programming Language</em></a>’s advice on type safety; <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Coding-Standards-Rules-Guidelines-Practices/dp/0321113586"><em>C++ Coding Standards</em></a>’ section on type safety; the <a href="https://www.stroustrup.com/JSF-AV-rules.pdf"><em>Joint Strike Fighter Coding Standards</em></a>; <a href="https://www.perforce.com/resources/qac/high-integrity-cpp-coding-standard">High Integrity C++</a>; the <a href="https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#S-profile">C++ Core Guidelines section on safety profiles</a> (a small enforceable set of safety rules); and the <a href="https://forum.misra.org.uk/thread-1668.html">recently-released MISRA C++:2023</a>.</p>



<p>The best way for “how” to let the programmer control enabling those rules (e.g., via source code annotations, compiler switches, and/or something else) is an orthogonal UX issue that is now being actively discussed in the C++ standards committee and community.</p>



<h3>Type safety</h3>



<p><strong>Enforce the </strong><a href="https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#SS-type"><strong>Pro.Type safety profile</strong></a><strong> by default.</strong> That includes either banning or checking all unsafe casts and conversions (e.g., static_cast pointer downcasts, reinterpret_cast), including implicit unsafe type punning via C union and vararg.</p>



<p>However, these rules haven’t yet been systematically enforced in the industry. For example, in recent years I’ve painfully observed a significant set of type safety-caused security vulnerabilities whose root cause was that code used static_cast instead of dynamic_cast for pointer downcasts, and “C++” gets blamed even when the actual problem was failure to follow the well-publicized guidance to use the language’s existing safe recommended feature. It’s time for a standardized C++ mode that enforces these rules by default.</p>



<blockquote>
<p><a><strong><em>Note:</em></strong></a><em> On some platforms and for some applications, </em><em>dynamic_cast</em><em> has problematic space and time overheads that hinder its use. Many implementations bundle </em><em>dynamic_cast</em><em> indivisibly with all C++ run-time typing (RTTI) features (e.g., </em><em>typeid</em><em>), and so require storing full potentially-heavyweight RTTI data even though </em><em>dynamic_cast</em><em> needs only a small subset. Some implementations also use needlessly inefficient algorithms for </em><em>dynamic_cast</em><em> itself. So the standard must encourage (and, if possible, enforce for conformance, such as by setting algorithmic complexity requirements) that </em><em>dynamic_cast</em><em> implementations be more efficient and decoupled from other RTTI overheads, so that programmers do not have a legitimate performance reason not to use the safe feature. That decoupling could require an ABI break; if that is unacceptable, the standard must provide an alternative lightweight facility such as a </em><em>fast_dynamic_cast</em><em> that is separate from (other) RTTI and performs the dynamic cast with minimum space and time cost.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<h3>Bounds safety</h3>



<p><strong>Enforce the </strong><a href="https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#probounds-bounds-safety-profile"><strong>Pro.Bounds safety profile</strong></a><strong> by default, and guarantee bounds checking.</strong> We should additionally guarantee that:</p>



<ul>
<li>Pointer arithmetic is banned (use std::span instead); this enforces that a pointer refers to a single object. Array-to-pointer decay, if allowed, will point to only the first object in the array.</li>



<li>Only bounds-checked iterator arithmetic is allowed (also, prefer ranges instead).</li>



<li>All subscript operations are bounds-checked at the call site, by having the compiler inject an automatic subscript bounds check on every expression of the form a[b], where a is a contiguous sequence with a size/ssize function and b is an integral index. When a violation happens, the action taken can be customized using a global bounds violation handler; some programs will want to terminate (the default), others will want to log-and-continue, throw an exception, integrate with a project-specific critical fault infrastructure.</li>
</ul>



<p>Importantly, the latter explicitly avoids implementing bounds-checking intrusively for each individual container/range/view type. Implementing bounds-checking non-intrusively and automatically at the call site makes full bounds checking available for every existing standard and user-written container/range/view type out of the box: Every subscript into a vector, span, deque, or similar existing type in third-party and company-internal libraries would be usable in checked mode without any need for a library upgrade.</p>



<p>It’s important to add automatic call-site checking now before libraries continue adding more subscript bounds checking in each library, so that we avoid duplicating checks at the call site and in the callee. As a counterexample, C# took many years to get rid of duplicate caller-and-callee checking, but succeeded and .NET Core addresses this better now; we can avoid most of that duplicate-check-elimination optimization work by offering automatic call-site checking sooner.</p>



<p>Language constructs like the range-for loop are already safe by construction and need no checks.</p>



<p>In cases where bounds checking incurs a performance impact, code can still explicitly opt out of the bounds check in just those paths to retain full performance and still have full bounds checking in the rest of the application.</p>



<h3>Initialization safety</h3>



<p><strong>Enforce initialization-before-use by default.</strong> That’s pretty easy to statically guarantee, except for some cases of the unused parts of lazily constructed array/vector storage. Two simple alternatives we could enforce are (either is sufficient):</p>



<ul>
<li>Initialize-at-declaration as required by <a href="https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#SS-type">Pro.Type</a> and <a href="https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#Res-always">ES.20</a>; and possibly zero-initialize data by default as currently proposed in <a href="https://wg21.link/p2723">P2723</a>. These two are good but with some drawbacks; both have some performance costs for cases that require ‘dummy’ writes that are never used but hard for optimizers to eliminate, and the latter has some correctness costs because it ‘fixing’ some uninitialized cases where zero is a valid value but masks others for which zero is not a valid initializer and so the behavior is still wrong, but because a zero has been jammed in it’s harder for sanitizers to detect.</li>



<li>Guaranteed initialization-before-use, similar to what Ada and C# successfully do. This is still simple to use, but can be more efficient because it avoids the need for artificial ‘dummy’ writes, and can be more flexible because it allows alternative constructors to be used for the same object on different paths. For details, see: <a href="https://youtu.be/ELeZAKCN4tY?si=HKzgS8CUBdGREDAN&amp;t=4305">example diagnostic</a>; <a href="https://youtu.be/ELeZAKCN4tY?si=MnhZGU5xoRhTGF_V&amp;t=4556">definite-first-use rules</a>.</li>
</ul>



<h3>Lifetime safety</h3>



<p><strong>Enforce the </strong><a href="https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#SS-type"><strong>Pro.Lifetime safety profile</strong></a><strong> by default, ban manual allocation by default, and guarantee null checking.</strong> The Lifetime profile is a static analysis that diagnoses many common sources of dangling and use-after-free, including for iterators and views (not just raw pointers and references), in a way that is efficient enough to run during compilation. It can be used as a basis to iterate on and further improve. And we should additionally guarantee that:</p>



<ul>
<li>All manual memory management is banned by default (new, delete, malloc, and free). Corollary: ‘Owning’ raw pointers are banned by default, since they require delete or free. Use RAII instead, such as by calling make_unique or make_shared.</li>



<li>All dereferences are null-checked. The compiler injects an automatic check on every expression of the form *p or p-&gt; where p can be compared to nullptr to null-check all dereferences at the call site (similar to bounds checks above). When a violation happens, the action taken can be customized using a global null violation handler; some programs will want to terminate (the default), others will want to log-and-continue, throw an exception, integrate with a project-specific critical fault infrastructure.</li>
</ul>



<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The compiler could choose to not emit this check (and not perform optimizations that benefit from the check) when targeting platforms that already trap null dereferences, such as platforms that mark low memory pages as unaddressable. Some C++ features, such as delete, have always done call-site null checking.</p>
</blockquote>



<h3>Reducing undefined behavior and semantic bugs</h3>



<p><strong>Tactically, reduce some undefined behavior (UB) and other semantic bugs (pitfalls), for cases where we can automatically diagnose or even fix well-known antipatterns.</strong> Not all UB is bad; any performance-oriented language needs some. But we know there is low-hanging fruit where the programmer’s intent is clear and any UB or pitfall is a definite bug, so we can do one of two things:</p>



<p><strong>(A – Good) Make the pitfall a diagnosed error, with zero false positives — every violation is a real bug.</strong> Two examples mentioned above are to automatically check a[b] to be in bounds and *p and p-&gt; to be non-null.</p>



<p><strong>(B – Ideal) Make the code actually do what the programmer intended, with zero false positives — i.e., fix it by just recompiling.</strong> An example, discussed at the most recent ISO C++ November 2023 meeting, is to default to an implicit <a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2023/p2973r0.html">return *this;</a> when the programmer writes an assignment operator for their type C that returns a C&amp; (note: the same type), but forgets to write a return statement. Today, that is undefined behavior. Yet it’s clear that the programmer meant return *this; — nothing else can be valid. If we make return *this; be the default, all the existing code that accidentally omits the return is not just “no longer UB,” but is guaranteed to do the right and intended thing.</p>



<p><strong>An example of both (A) and (B)</strong> is to support <a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p0893r1.html">chained comparisons</a>, that makes the mathematically valid chains work correctly and rejects the mathematically invalid ones at compile time. Real-world code does write such chains by accident (see: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/8889522/2069064">[a]</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/5939077/2069064">[b]</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/14433884/2069064">[c]</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/46806239/2069064">[d]</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/25965157/2069064">[e]</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/38643022/2069064">[f]</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/45385837/2069064">[g]</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/20989496/2069064">[h]</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/35564553/2069064">[i]</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/42335710/2069064">[j]</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/37470518/2069064">[k]</a>).</p>



<ul>
<li>For (A): We can reject all mathematically invalid chains like a != b &gt; c at compile time. This automatically diagnoses bugs in existing code that tries to do such nonsense chains, with perfect accuracy.</li>



<li>For (B): We can fix all existing code that writes would-be-correct chains like 0 &lt;= index &lt; max. Today those silently compile but are completely wrong, and we can make them mean the right thing. This automatically fixes those bugs, just by recompiling the existing code.</li>
</ul>



<p>These examples are not exhaustive. We should review the list of UB in the standard for a more thorough list of cases we can automatically fix (ideally) or diagnose.</p>



<h3>Summarizing: Better defaults for C++</h3>



<p>C++ could enable turning safety rules on by default that would make code:</p>



<ul>
<li>fully type-safe,</li>



<li>fully bounds-safe,</li>



<li>fully initialization-safe,</li>
</ul>



<p>and for lifetime safety, which is the hardest of the four, and where I would expect the remaining vulnerabilities in these categories would mostly lie:</p>



<ul>
<li>fully null-safe,</li>



<li>fully free of owning raw pointers,</li>



<li>with lifetime-safety static analysis that diagnoses most common pointer/iterator/view lifetime errors;</li>
</ul>



<p>and, finally:</p>



<ul>
<li>with less undefined behavior including by automatically fixing existing bugs just by recompiling code with safety enabled by default.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>All of this is efficiently implementable and has been implemented.</strong> Most of the Lifetime rules have been implemented in Visual Studio and CLion, and I’m prototyping a proof-of-concept mode of C++ that includes all of the other above language safeties on-by-default in my <a href="https://github.com/hsutter/cppfront/">cppfront compiler</a>, as well as other safety improvements including an implementation of the current proposal for ISO C++ contracts. I haven’t yet used the prototype at scale. However, I can report that the first major change request I received from early users was to change the bounds checking and null checking from opt-in (off by default) to opt-out (on by default).</p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong><em> Please don’t be distracted by that cppfront uses an experimental alternate syntax for C++. That’s because I’m additionally trying to see if we can reach a second orthogonal goal: to make the C++ language itself simpler, and eliminate the need to teach ~90% of the C++ guidance literature related to language complexity and quirks. This essay’s language safety improvements are orthogonal to that, however, and can be applied equally to today’s C++ syntax.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<h3>Solutions need to distinguish between (A) “solution for new-or-updatable code” and (B) “solution for existing code.”</h3>



<p><strong>(A) A “solution for new-or-updatable code” means that to help existing code we have to change/rewrite our code.</strong> This includes not only “(re)write in C#/Rust/Go/Python/…,” but also “annotate your code with <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/code-quality/understanding-sal?view=msvc-170">SAL</a>” or “change your code to use std::span.”</p>



<p>One of the costs of (A) is that anytime we write/change code to fix bugs, we also introduce new bugs; change is never free. We need to recognize that changing our code to use std::span often means non-trivially rewriting parts of it which can also create other bugs. Even annotating our code means writing annotations that can have bugs (this is a common experience in the annotation languages I’ve seen used at scale, such as SAL). All these are significant adoption barriers.</p>



<p>Actually switching to another language means losing a mature ecosystem. C++ is the well-trod path: It’s taught, people know it, the tools exist, interop works, and current regulations have an industry around C++ (such as for functional safety). It takes another decade at least for another language to become the well-trod path, whereas a better C++, and its benefits to the industry broadly, can be here much sooner.</p>



<p><strong>(B) A “solution for existing code” emphasizes the adoptability benefits of not having to make manual code changes.</strong> It includes anything that makes existing code more secure with “just a recompile” (i.e., no binary/ABI/link issues; e.g., ASAN, compiler switches to enable stack checks, static analysis that produces only true positives, or a reliable automated code modernizer).</p>



<p>We will still need (B) no matter how successful new languages or new C++ types/annotations are. And (B) has the strong benefit that it is easier to adopt. Getting to a 98% reduction in CVEs will require both (A) and (B), but if we can deliver even a 30% reduction using just (B) that will be a major benefit for adoption and effective impact in large existing code bases that are hard to change.</p>



<p>Consider how the ideas earlier in this appendix map onto (A) and (B):</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td>In C++, by default enforce …</td><td><strong>(A) Solution for new/updated code (can require code changes — no link/binary changes)</strong></td><td><strong>(B) Solution for existing code (requires recompile only — no manual code changes, no link/binary changes)</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Type safety</strong></td><td>Ban all inherently unsafe casts and conversions</td><td>Make unsafe casts and conversions with a safe alternative do the safe thing</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Bounds safety</strong></td><td>Ban pointer arithmetic Ban unchecked iterator arithmetic</td><td>Check in-bounds for all allowed iterator arithmetic Check in-bounds for all subscript operations</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Initialization safety</strong></td><td>Require all variables to be initialized (either at declaration, or before first use)</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Lifetime safety</strong></td><td>Statically diagnose many common pointer/iterator lifetime error cases</td><td>Check not-null for all pointer dereferences</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Less undefined behavior</strong></td><td>Statically diagnose known UB/bug cases, to error on actual bugs in existing code with just a recompile and zero false positives:<br>Ban mathematically invalid comparison chains<br>(add additional cases from UB Annex review)</td><td>Automatically fix known UB/bug cases, to make current bugs in existing code be actually correct with just a recompile and zero false positives: <br>Define mathematically valid comparison chains<br>Default return *this; for C assignment operators that return C&amp;<br>(add additional cases from UB Annex review)</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>By prioritizing adoptability, we can get at least some of the safety benefits just by recompiling existing code, and make the total improvement easier to deploy even when code updates are required. I think that makes it a valuable strategy to pursue.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>We introduce the first model-stealing attack that extracts precise, nontrivial information from black-box production language models like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Google's PaLM-2. Specifically, our attack recovers the embedding projection layer (up to symmetries) of a transformer model, given typical API access. For under \$20 USD, our attack extracts the entire projection matrix of OpenAI's Ada and Babbage language models. We thereby confirm, for the first time, that these black-box models have a hidden dimension of 1024 and 2048, respectively. We also recover the exact hidden dimension size of the gpt-3.5-turbo model, and estimate it would cost under \$2,000 in queries to recover the entire projection matrix. We conclude with potential defenses and mitigations, and discuss the implications of possible future work that could extend our attack.

            <span>Abstract:</span>Cosine-similarity is the cosine of the angle between two vectors, or equivalently the dot product between their normalizations. A popular application is to quantify semantic similarity between high-dimensional objects by applying cosine-similarity to a learned low-dimensional feature embedding. This can work better but sometimes also worse than the unnormalized dot-product between embedded vectors in practice. To gain insight into this empirical observation, we study embeddings derived from regularized linear models, where closed-form solutions facilitate analytical insights. We derive analytically how cosine-similarity can yield arbitrary and therefore meaningless `similarities.' For some linear models the similarities are not even unique, while for others they are implicitly controlled by the regularization. We discuss implications beyond linear models: a combination of different regularizations are employed when learning deep models; these have implicit and unintended effects when taking cosine-similarities of the resulting embeddings, rendering results opaque and possibly arbitrary. Based on these insights, we caution against blindly using cosine-similarity and outline alternatives.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p><a href="https://jacobian.org/series/estimation/">Estimating Software Projects</a>:</p><p>In a management group, someone asked for resources on teaching planning. I shared a link to <a href="https://jacobian.org/series/estimation/">this series on estimation</a>, but quickly they came back and told me that there was something missing. The previous parts in this series assume you’re starting with a clearly defined task list, but the people this manager is teach aren’t there yet. They need help with an earlier step: “breaking down” a project into a clearly defined set of tasks.</p><p>I’ve not previously written about how to break down a task list because, to me, it largely feels intuitive. Prior to writing what follows, I think I would describe my process as: “think about the project and then write down the task list.” But that’s a deeply unsatisfying, <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/how-to-draw-an-owl">“just draw the rest of the owl”</a> sort of answer.</p><p>So here I’ll fill that gap, and dig into what’s going on when I break down a project into constitute tasks. I’ll start by <a href="#example">working through an example</a>, showing how do it, and then step back and <a href="#what-just-happened">explain the steps I took</a>. But if you want to skip the scenic route, you can skip to the end where I’ve <a href="#tldr">summarized the process</a>.</p><h2 id="example">Breaking down tasks - by example</h2><p>I’m building a personal streak tracker, tracking days I do some sort of outdoor activity. I want something similar to the <a href="https://streaksapp.com/">Streaks</a> app, except with different options for outdoor activities (running, biking, skiing, etc.), and I want to incorporate the <a href="https://blog.duolingo.com/how-duolingo-streak-builds-habit/">“streak freeze” feature from Duolingo</a>.</p><h3 id="iteration-1">Iteration 1</h3><p>I often start with a sketch. Having a visual mockup of what I’m going to build is a great starting point. The final result rarely ends up looking like this, but it’s a good way of articulating all the features I want in an easy-to-understand format.</p><figure><a href="https://jacobian.org/2024/mar/11/breaking-down-tasks/mockup.excalidraw.png"><img src="https://jacobian.org/2024/mar/11/breaking-down-tasks/mockup.excalidraw.png" alt="A mockup of the tracker interface, showing a week of activities tracked, a currently active streak, and the freeze features."></a></figure><p>Is this sufficiently “broken down”? If it’s just me, if it’s just a personal project – probably yes! For a personal project like this I’ll just sit down and start writing code now. But this is essentially just a one-step task: “build this picture”. If I’m going to delegate some of this work, or if I need to estimate how long this’ll take, I need more granularity. So I’ll continue.</p><h3 id="iteration-2">Iteration 2</h3><p>The next step is to expand my single-step “build this” task into its constituent pieces. I’ll think through and plan the the steps I’d need to go through to get this done. I’ll try to account for dependancies – which tasks need to come before other tasks – but I’m not worried about size or scope of the steps yet, just rough list. Here’s my first attempt:</p><ol><li>Model the data</li><li>Calendar view, showing days of the current week</li><li>Interactive calendar: click an icon records an activity and marks the day as “completed” for streak tracking.</li><li>Calculate and show the length of the current streak</li><li>Implement streak freezes</li></ol><p>To keep this blog post simple, I’m ignoring deployment and other operational steps like setting up a database, etc. I’m also mostly collapsing front-end and back-end development into single steps like “build calendar view”. In a real project, especially a multi-person one, I’d have separate line items for deployment, front/backend tasks, etc., but that would quickly get more complex than I want to get for this example.</p><p>Ok, is <em>this</em> sufficiently “broken down”? For some purposes, maybe: I can probably produce an accurate-enough estimation of time for each step, and if I’m working with a sufficiantly-aligned and autonomous team there might be enough detail here to delegate tasks. But there’s still a good deal of uncertainty. I don’t have clear view of how freezes will be accumulated and tracked, so step 5 is a bit vague. I also don’t have anything about past history in here, adding/removing activity types, and other potential rabbit holes. Those make estimates uncertain, and mean that if I delegate a task I might not get the result I was picturing. So, I’ll continue by breaking things down even further, and add more detail.</p><h3 id="iteration-3">Iteration 3</h3><p>I’ll continue the same process of taking a “big” step, and breaking it down into constitution pieces, added detail as I go:</p><ol><li><strong>Model the data:</strong><ol><li>activity types: run/bike/ski/climb/etc. (hardcoded list of types is fine)</li><li>recorded activities: date, type</li><li>freezes: date earned, date spent</li><li>streaks: date started, date ended, stats on count of different activity types during the streak (no need for calculation, that can come later)</li></ol></li><li><strong>Static calendar view:</strong><ol><li>Weekly view: shows days of the current week, recorded activities or spent freezes on that day</li><li>Index (home page) view: shows the current week</li><li>Monthly view: show a whole month - no individual activity types, just recorded/not recorded</li><li>Browsing: browse backwards/forwards on the week and month views, and allow switching between weeks and months.</li><li>“Go to date” quick entry box - don’t get fancy, no fuzzy date input, can use the html5 date widget for now</li></ol></li><li><strong>Dynamic week calendar view</strong> (no dynamic entry on monthly views):<ol><li>clicking an activity type on a day records that day as completed</li></ol></li><li><strong>Streak calculation and display:</strong><ol><li>Streak calculation: walk activity history and calculate streaks — start date, end date, stats (e.g. “14 days: 9 runs, 3 bikes, 1 climb, 1 freeze”)</li><li>Streak display: show current streak in the UI. No functionality for viewing past streaks yet</li><li>Recording an activity in the UI recalculates streaks</li></ol></li><li><strong>Streak freezes:</strong><ol><li>When calculating streaks, a streak of X days (without a freeze) accumulates a streak freeze. X can be hardcoded, make up a number for now (roll a die, whatever). Freezes “roll over”: if 3 freezes are accumulated during Streak A, one is spent, and then the streak ends, you still have 2 freezes available to use on Streak B.</li><li>Prevent “double accumulation” when recalculating streaks - make sure that if you go back in time and update an activity, causing streak recalculation, you don’t re-earn streaks.</li><li>Add freezes to the UI: spend a freeze on a day to extend the streak, and display the number of accumulated freezes in the UI.</li></ol></li></ol><p>How about now — is this sufficiently broken down? Again the answer is contextual. I think for most engineers and most teams it is: we have clear steps, clear definitions of done, and have carefully avoided all the potential rabbit holes I can think of. I can imagine situations (junior developers, mission-critical projects with intense oversight/scrutiny) where even <em>more</em> detail might be necessary. But for the purposes of this example, let’s call this done.</p><h2 id="what-just-happened">What just happened?</h2><p>Fundamentally, what I showed is an interactive process of breaking down tasks:</p><ol><li>Start with a list of tasks – or just one big project!</li><li>Think through the steps you’d need to take to accomplish that task, and write them down. Don’t worry about completeness or accuracy or depth, each pass just needs to expand, even slightly, on the previous one.</li><li>Is every task on your new list sufficiently defined? (I’ll define “sufficiently” in a minute.) If not, GOTO 1.</li></ol><p>This algorithm is simple, but it makes some assumptions. Remember, the context here is someone who’s never done this sort of thing before, and is pretty new to software development overall. So we need to define a couple of key terms:</p><h3 id="whats-a-task">What’s a “task”?</h3><p>Merriam-Websters defines task as … haha no, just kidding. I can do better than that.</p><p>Many people – me included – have an intuitive understanding of what “task” means, but when asked to define it, we struggle to articulate it out loud. For the purposes of talking about software development and project estimation, I think this definition is best:</p><dl><dt>Task</dt><dd>A sufficiently defined, complete piece of work that delivers change.</dd></dl><ul><li><em>Sufficiently defined</em> because tasks need some sort of clear outline of what’s required; “work on stuff” isn’t a task. More on this in a minute.</li><li><em>Complete</em> because a task needs to encompass all of the work required. The “cut down tree” task isn’t complete if you’ve only fetched the chainsaw.</li><li><em>Delivers change</em> because, in a work context, a task only “matters” if something is different because of the work.</li></ul><p>For the purposes of estimation, we need to go a little deeper into what “defined” means. In order for a task to be “sufficiently defined”, it needs to have “enough” detail – but the definition of “enough” is going to differ based on context. As I explored above, if it’s just me, a simple sketch is “sufficiently defined”, but in other contexts we need more detail. Still, although there isn’t one globally-applicable definition of “sufficiently defined”, I think there is a common-enough definition to be useful as a starting point.</p><h3 id="sufficiantly-defined">What is “sufficiently defined”?</h3><p><strong>A task is sufficiently defined if the person working on the task<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> can answer “yes” to these questions:</strong></p><ul><li>Do I understand what change is desired?</li><li>Do I understand what “done” will look like?</li><li>Can I define <em>all</em> the steps I would take to get to “done”? E.g., could I write down a TODO list for this task, and would it be complete?</li><li>Assuming no blockers or dependancies, do I have all the information I need to start this task right now?</li></ul><p>If the person working on the task, within the context of their workplace and their skillset, can’t answer “yes” to all these questions, then the task isn’t sufficiently broken down, and you should repeat the breaking-down algorithm until you can answer “yes” to these questions for all tasks on the list.</p><p>Now, there are going to be situations where you <em>can’t</em> decompose tasks further, or add more context, because of unknowns. Fixing bugs is often like this: you know what the change is (no more bug), you know what “done” looks like (bug is fixed), but you can’t know all the steps. There are techniques you can employ in these situations – <a href="https://jacobian.org/2021/oct/20/simple-pm-tricks/#timeboxing">timeboxing</a> is my favorite – but a deep discussion here is out of scope.</p><h2 id="this-is-a-skill-and-it-takes-practice">This is a skill, and it takes practice</h2><p>It’s important to point out at this point that this is a skill, and it takes practice to develop to the point where it’s easy. If you’re new to this kind of thinking, you’ll probably find it doesn’t come particularly easy – and that’s normal.</p><p>Take, for example, what I did above in <a href="#iteration-2">iteration 2</a>: how did I know, or how did I decide, that “model data” was going to be the first step? Why wasn’t step 1 “design the interface”, or “write the streak calculation algorithm”, or anything else?</p><p>The answer is deeply unsatisfying to people new to this kind of work: it was largely intuitive. I know, for decades of experience writing software, that when I’m working on tools like this, things go better when I model data first. I also know that I’ll be using Django, which has better affordances for a model-data-first workflow. There’s no algorithm here: I’m essentially pattern-matching this project against all the other projects I’ve worked on or seen, and, based on that experience, intuiting the right steps in the right order. Which means, of course, if you <em>haven’t</em> seen a bunch of projects like this one, it can be incredibly difficult to know where to start!</p><p>There are no shortcuts here; the only way to learn is by doing. Which means, to circle all the way back to the discussion that inspired this piece: the best thing this manager can do to help her team get better here is give them safe opportunities to try it out.

<p dir="auto">Transformer Debugger (TDB) is a tool developed by OpenAI's <a href="https://openai.com/blog/introducing-superalignment" rel="nofollow">Superalignment
team</a> with the goal of
supporting investigations into specific behaviors of small language models. The tool combines
<a href="https://openai.com/research/language-models-can-explain-neurons-in-language-models" rel="nofollow">automated interpretability</a>
techniques with <a href="https://transformer-circuits.pub/2023/monosemantic-features" rel="nofollow">sparse autoencoders</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">TDB enables rapid exploration before needing to write code, with the ability to intervene in the
forward pass and see how it affects a particular behavior. It can be used to answer questions like,
"Why does the model output token A instead of token B for this prompt?" or "Why does attention head
H to attend to token T for this prompt?" It does so by identifying specific components (neurons,
attention heads, autoencoder latents) that contribute to the behavior, showing automatically
generated explanations of what causes those components to activate most strongly, and tracing
connections between components to help discover circuits.</p>
<p dir="auto">These videos give an overview of TDB and show how it can be used to investigate <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00593" rel="nofollow">indirect object
identification in GPT-2 small</a>:</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-c771f4d65dbb1013d3af">
  <p>When the global pandemic was first announced, it was a bewildering feeling. It was scary, and yet, somehow thrilling—a novel experience, to say the least.</p><p>So throughout the rest of the year—and setting aside traumas and deaths—we got to enjoy the slower pace of remote living. But now, almost a year later, the mental, emotional, and physical toll has surfaced. We’ve absorbed the knocks, and now, we’re just plain and simply, tired. </p><p>When the new year kicked in, I thought that taking a break from my creative writing to “live a little more” would energize me—it didn’t. I felt lethargic instead. I felt a void inside myself that was snowballing by the day.</p><p>If you find yourself growing more weary and anxious about the future, <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07421656.2016.1166832?journalCode=uart20#.V2GKm-YrI6g" target="_blank">scientific research</a> indicates that regardless of your artistic experience or talent, just a 45-minute session of focused creative activity significantly lowers the cortisol levels in your body, and thus, reduces your overall stress.</p><p>In other words, a small dose of daily creativity is good for us. It can help us become more present, less anxious, and much more fulfilled. And as I continue to learn more about the mental health benefits of creativity, I realize now how the simple habit of writing every day has boosted my self-esteem, given me a sense of purpose, and formed a buffer for emotional release. </p><h2>The Problem with Too Much Consumption</h2><p>In this 21st century, there’s so much you could do to fill all the hours in your day. You can binge-watch anything on demand. You can order a bunch of stuff and have them arrive at your doorstep on the same day. You can spend countless hours scrolling on your phone, at the mercy of an algorithm, and you’d only scratch less than 1% of the social entertainment that’s at your disposal. </p><p>Extrapolate that across the next week, month, and years, and you begin to see why some people can fall into the trap of endless consumption and inactivity.  </p><p>Look, life is meant to be lived and enjoyed, but that’s not the ultimate purpose of life. What’s the purpose? Your purpose is just to be alive and do what good you can with it. Your purpose is to keep growing and evolving. It’s as simple as that.</p><p>I think Ralph Waldo Emerson captured it well:</p><blockquote><p><em>“The purpose of life is not to be happy. It is to be useful, to be honorable, to be compassionate, to have it make some difference that you have lived and lived well.”</em></p></blockquote><p>As you make yourself useful by enjoying the process of adding more arsenal to your realm of knowledge and skills, so that you can put them to good use and contribute threads to the fabric of society, happiness simply becomes a byproduct of that journey. <a href="https://medium.com/mind-cafe/10-daily-habits-of-truly-happy-people-9efd3d8bd2eb?sk=3e4e69b02620d4bcf0a6e7b6e5ea8216&amp;source=friends_link" target="_blank"><em>Happiness becomes the way.</em></a></p><p>The problem with too much consumption, however, is that it can leave us feeling utterly empty inside. Ironically, it creates something:<em> One big void. </em></p><p>You start to feel stuck, not knowing what to do with your life. You lose agency over your habits, you lose control over your emotions, and eventually, this loss in energy translates into zero productivity.</p><p><strong>Too much consumption leads to a life of escapism. </strong>Instead of learning how to sit with your emotions or exploring what’s inside of you and self-expressing yourself through art, you seek an escape that would make you forget.</p><p>Another problem with consumption is that it can give you a false illusion that you’re doing something. Spending hours watching fitness videos will not help you become fit. You’ve got to get up and move to do so. Spending hours watching cooking shows won’t make you a better cook—cooking will.  </p><p>With that in mind, you’ve got to make a decision: <em>Do you want to define your life by self-expressive creation or mindless consumption? By selflessly giving or selfishly taking? </em>As Martin Luther King Jr. once said: “Every man must decide whether he will walk in the light of creative altruism or in the darkness of destructive selfishness.” </p><h2>Creativity is Your Duty, But it Can Also Be a Therapeutic Tool</h2><p>Art is the most beautiful form of human expression. Whether it be through prose, science, technology, innovation, visual arts, or illustration, the sheer act of living in a state of wonder and creation is what makes us human. </p><p>When we create, we enter a state of flow, and flow is what psychologist Mihály Csíkszentmihály defines as a state of complete immersion in an activity for its own sake. In his book, <em>Flow: The psychology of optimal experience, </em>he writes:</p><blockquote><p><em>“Flow is a state in which people are so involved in an activity that nothing else seems to matter; the experience is so enjoyable that people will continue to do it even at great cost, for the sheer sake of doing it.”</em></p></blockquote><p>There’s a distinct word here that I should highlight. Notice how he says enjoyable and not pleasurable because they’re two different things.</p><p>Activities like eating, drinking, sleeping, and watching entertainment, are examples of pleasurable experiences. They’re passive and transient in nature. Enjoyable experiences, on the other hand, are active. Think of sports, writing, and art—they demand you to show up to it and be fully immersed in it. </p><p>In other words: <strong><em>Pleasurable experiences are rooted in consumption. Enjoyable experiences are rooted in creation.</em></strong></p><p>And this relates to what Rabindranath Tagore, the Bengali poet, philosopher, and the first non-European to win the Nobel Prize, wrote somewhere between the 19th and 20th century:</p><blockquote><p><em>“I slept and dreamt that life was joy.&nbsp;<br>I awoke and saw that life was duty.&nbsp;<br>I worked—and behold, duty was joy.”</em></p></blockquote><p><em>Work is duty and “duty is joy.” </em></p><p>That’s one great mantra to live by. Duty is not pleasure; duty is joy. <em>Duty is not consumption; duty is creation. </em>And since creativity is a form of work and work is a duty, then creativity is a duty—a joy. </p><p>When I sit down on my chair to write, I face a lot of resistance, but I insist on carrying myself through because the simple practice of plucking thoughts from the garden of my mind and glazing them in words gives me a sense of peace and calm. It arms me with joy. Hours flash by in minutes. The focus drifts me away from my worries of the future and returns me to the present. </p><p>And after I walk away from my desk, the knowledge that I just painted an entire white page with black ink—<em>that I’ve done something good today</em>—graces me with the freedom to feel fulfilled. </p><p>Writing is my art of choice, and it helps me make sense of my life, but <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2804629/" target="_blank">as this published study</a> on the connection between art and healing demonstrates, any form of art can help you improve your mental and emotional wellbeing. </p><p>When you focus on one activity and become fully absorbed by it, your heart rate slows and your breath deepens. This immersive nature of being creative helps you control what thoughts you pay attention to. In a way, creative work transforms into a form of meditation.</p><p>But what makes it all worthwhile? The sense of accomplishment you feel by the end of it. Even if no one else checks out your work, it’ll still help you see yourself in a new light and earn your own appreciation. The artistic process of self-express helps you understand yourself better. And if you ask me, that’s the single most potent benefit of having your own creative outlet.</p><p>In fact, that’s why in the field of psychotherapy, they utilize the creative process to help people explore self-expression and, in doing so, find new ways to gain personal insight and develop more robust coping skills. It’s called <a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-art-therapy-2795755" target="_blank">art therapy</a>. </p><h2>How to Tip The Scale Toward Creation</h2><p>In her book, Big Magic, Elizabeth Gilbert writes that “a creative life is an amplified life. It’s a bigger life, a happier life, an expanded life, and a hell of a lot more interesting life. Living in this manner—continually and stubbornly bringing forth the jewels that are hidden within you—is a fine art, in and of itself.” I love that, and I couldn’t agree more.</p><p>Truth is, it doesn't take much to live a creative life. You don’t need to quit your job. You don’t need to move to a new place to feel inspired. You don’t need to sign-up for a $1,000 course to learn how to to make art.</p><p><em>You just need to start. </em></p><p><em>And you just need to tip the scale toward creation.</em></p><p>Here’s a simple 3-step strategy to help you get started:</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Choose something you enjoy. </strong>Not something that gives you pleasure—something you enjoy. Something that pulls you in. Whether it be writing, drawing, designing, knitting, or baking, you’re only able to enter a state of flow when you do something for its own sake rather than an extrinsic reward. When the work <strong><em>is</em></strong> the reward—that’s what it means to enjoy it. </p></li><li><p><strong>Block time for it, show up to it and say “no” to protect it. </strong>Set aside an<strong> </strong>hour a day for creativity. Switch off your phone. Create an interruption-free space. Say no to whatever or whoever pulls you in another direction. And if you can’t commit to a daily practice, can you do it twice per week?</p></li><li><p><strong>Leave your judgment at the door and replace it with self-compassion. </strong>Seriously. Remember that growth is a process. Good things take time to bloom. What keeps you growing, however, is your ability to suspend your critical judgment, honor your creative work, and be compassionate with yourself. <a href="https://www.omaritani.com/blog/capability-and-mindset" target="_blank">You’re more capable than you think</a>.</p></li></ol><h2>A New Mantra to Live By</h2><p>Scottish novelist Robert Louis Stevenson once these words:</p><blockquote><p><em>"Don't judge each day by the harvest you reap but by the seeds that you plant." </em></p></blockquote><p>In other words, don’t judge each day by what you consume but by what you create. <em>Create more, consume less. </em>That’s a good mantra to live by. </p><p>I won't judge each day by what I consume, but by what I create.</p><p>I think you should too.</p>

The admission figures for the fall of 1973 showed that men applying were more likely than women to be admitted, and the difference was so large that it was unlikely to be due to chance.<sup id="cite_ref-freedman_15-0"><a href="#cite_note-freedman-15">[15]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Bickel_16-0"><a href="#cite_note-Bickel-16">[16]</a></sup>

<p>However, when taking into account the information about departments being applied to, the different rejection percentages reveal the different difficulty of getting into the department, and at the same time it showed that women tended to apply to more competitive departments with lower rates of admission, even among qualified applicants (such as in the English department), whereas men tended to apply to less competitive departments with higher rates of admission (such as in the engineering department). The pooled and corrected data showed a "small but statistically significant bias in favor of women".<sup id="cite_ref-Bickel_16-1"><a href="#cite_note-Bickel-16">[16]</a></sup>

<p>Another example comes from a real-life medical study<sup id="cite_ref-17"><a href="#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup> comparing the success rates of two treatments for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_stone" title="Kidney stone">kidney stones</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-KidneyParadox_18-0"><a href="#cite_note-KidneyParadox-18">[18]</a></sup> The table below shows the success rates (the term <i>success rate</i> here actually means the success proportion) and numbers of treatments for treatments involving both small and large kidney stones, where Treatment A includes open surgical procedures and Treatment B includes closed surgical procedures. The numbers in parentheses indicate the number of success cases over the total size of the group.

<p>The paradoxical conclusion is that treatment A is more effective when used on small stones, and also when used on large stones, yet treatment B appears to be more effective when considering both sizes at the same time. In this example, the "lurking" variable (or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding" title="Confounding">confounding variable</a>) causing the paradox is the size of the stones, which was not previously known to researchers to be important until its effects were included.
</p><p>Which treatment is considered better is determined by which success ratio (successes/total) is larger. The reversal of the inequality between the two ratios when considering the combined data, which creates Simpson's paradox, happens because two effects occur together:
</p>
<ol><li>The sizes of the groups, which are combined when the lurking variable is ignored, are very different. Doctors tend to give cases with large stones the better treatment A, and the cases with small stones the inferior treatment B. Therefore, the totals are dominated by groups 3 and 2, and not by the two much smaller groups 1 and 4.</li>
<li>The lurking variable, stone size, has a large effect on the ratios; i.e., the success rate is more strongly influenced by the severity of the case than by the choice of treatment. Therefore, the group of patients with large stones using treatment A (group 3) does worse than the group with small stones, even if the latter used the inferior treatment B (group 2).</li></ol>
<p>Based on these effects, the paradoxical result is seen to arise because the effect of the size of the stones overwhelms the benefits of the better treatment (A). In short, the less effective treatment B appeared to be more effective because it was applied more frequently to the small stones cases, which were easier to treat.<sup id="cite_ref-KidneyParadox_18-1"><a href="#cite_note-KidneyParadox-18">[18]</a></sup>

<p>A common example of Simpson's paradox involves the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)" title="Batting average (baseball)">batting averages</a> of players in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_baseball" title="Professional baseball">professional baseball</a>.

<p>Simpson's reversal can also arise in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation" title="Correlation">correlations</a>,  in which two variables appear to have (say) a positive correlation towards one another, when in fact they have a negative correlation, the reversal having been brought about by a "lurking" confounder.  Berman et al.<sup id="cite_ref-22"><a href="#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup> give an example from economics, where a dataset suggests overall demand is positively correlated with price (that is, higher prices lead to <i>more</i> demand), in contradiction of expectation.   Analysis reveals time to be the confounding variable: plotting both price and demand against time reveals the expected negative correlation over various periods, which then reverses to become positive if the influence of time is ignored by simply plotting demand against price.

<p>Psychological interest in Simpson's paradox seeks to explain why people deem sign reversal to be impossible at first, offended by the idea that an action preferred both under one condition and under its negation should be rejected when the condition is unknown. The question is where people get this strong <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intuition" title="Intuition">intuition</a> from, and how it is encoded in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind" title="Mind">mind</a>.
</p><p>Simpson's paradox demonstrates that this intuition cannot be derived from either <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_logic" title="Classical logic">classical logic</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_calculus" title="Probability calculus">probability calculus</a> alone, and thus led <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosopher" title="Philosopher">philosophers</a> to speculate that it is supported by an innate causal logic that guides people in reasoning about actions and their consequences.<sup id="cite_ref-pearl_4-2"><a href="#cite_note-pearl-4">[4]</a></sup> Savage's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sure-thing_principle" title="Sure-thing principle">sure-thing principle</a><sup id="cite_ref-blyth-72_12-1"><a href="#cite_note-blyth-72-12">[12]</a></sup> is an example of what such logic may entail. A qualified version of Savage's sure thing principle can indeed be derived from Pearl's <i>do</i>-calculus<sup id="cite_ref-pearl_4-3"><a href="#cite_note-pearl-4">[4]</a></sup> and reads: "An action <i>A</i> that increases the probability of an event <i>B</i> in each subpopulation <i>C<sub>i</sub></i> of <i>C</i> must also increase the probability of <i>B</i> in the population as a whole, provided that the action does not change the distribution of the subpopulations." This suggests that knowledge about actions and consequences is stored in a form resembling Causal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_Networks" title="Bayesian Networks">Bayesian Networks</a>.

<p>A paper by Pavlides and Perlman presents a proof, due to Hadjicostas, that in a random 2 × 2 × 2 table with uniform distribution, Simpson's paradox will occur with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability" title="Probability">probability</a> of exactly <span><span>1</span>⁄<span>60</span></span>.<sup id="cite_ref-23"><a href="#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup> A study by Kock suggests that the probability that Simpson's paradox would occur at random in path models (i.e., models generated by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_analysis_(statistics)" title="Path analysis (statistics)">path analysis</a>) with two predictors and one criterion variable is approximately 12.8 percent; slightly higher than 1 occurrence per 8 path models.<sup id="cite_ref-24"><a href="#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup>

<p>A second, less well-known paradox was also discussed in Simpson's 1951 paper. It can occur when the "sensible interpretation" is not necessarily found in the separated data, like in the Kidney Stone example, but can instead reside in the combined data. Whether the partitioned or combined form of the data should be used hinges on the process giving rise to the data, meaning the correct interpretation of the data cannot always be determined by simply observing the tables.<sup id="cite_ref-25"><a href="#cite_note-25">[25]</a></sup>
</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judea_Pearl" title="Judea Pearl">Judea Pearl</a> has shown that, in order for the partitioned data to represent the correct causal relationships between any two variables, <span><img src="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab" aria-hidden="true" alt="{\displaystyle X}"></span> and <span><img src="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/961d67d6b454b4df2301ac571808a3538b3a6d3f" aria-hidden="true" alt="{\displaystyle Y}"></span>, the partitioning variables must satisfy a graphical condition called "back-door criterion":<sup id="cite_ref-26"><a href="#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-27"><a href="#cite_note-27">[27]</a></sup>
</p>
<ol><li>They must block all spurious paths between <span><img src="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab" aria-hidden="true" alt="{\displaystyle X}"></span> and <span><img src="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/961d67d6b454b4df2301ac571808a3538b3a6d3f" aria-hidden="true" alt="{\displaystyle Y}"></span></li>

<p>This criterion provides an algorithmic solution to Simpson's second paradox, and explains why the correct interpretation cannot be determined by data alone; two different graphs, both compatible with the data, may dictate two different back-door criteria.
</p><p>When the back-door criterion is satisfied by a set <i>Z</i> of covariates, the adjustment formula (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding" title="Confounding">Confounding</a>) gives the correct causal effect of <i>X</i> on <i>Y</i>. If no such set exists, Pearl's <i>do</i>-calculus can be invoked to discover other ways of estimating the causal effect.<sup id="cite_ref-pearl_4-4"><a href="#cite_note-pearl-4">[4]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-pearl-bow_28-0"><a href="#cite_note-pearl-bow-28">[28]</a></sup> The completeness of <i>do</i>-calculus <sup id="cite_ref-29"><a href="#cite_note-29">[29]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-pearl-bow_28-1"><a href="#cite_note-pearl-bow-28">[28]</a></sup> can be viewed as offering a complete resolution of the Simpson's paradox.

<h2><span id="Criticism">Criticism</span><span><span>[</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Simpson%27s_paradox&amp;action=edit&amp;section=10" title="Edit section: Criticism"><span>edit</span></a><span>]</span></span></h2>
<p>One criticism is that the paradox is not really a paradox at all, but rather a failure to properly account for confounding variables or to consider causal relationships between variables.<sup id="cite_ref-30"><a href="#cite_note-30">[30]</a></sup>
</p><p>Another criticism of the apparent Simpson's paradox is that it may be a result of the specific way that data is stratified or grouped. The phenomenon may disappear or even reverse if the data is stratified differently or if different confounding variables are considered. Simpson's example actually highlighted a phenomenon called noncollapsibility,<sup id="cite_ref-31"><a href="#cite_note-31">[31]</a></sup> which occurs when subgroups with high proportions do not make simple averages when combined. This suggests that the paradox may not be a universal phenomenon, but rather a specific instance of a more general statistical issue.
</p><p>Critics of the apparent Simpson's paradox also argue that the focus on the paradox may distract from more important statistical issues, such as the need for careful consideration of confounding variables and causal relationships when interpreting data.<sup id="cite_ref-32"><a href="#cite_note-32">[32]</a></sup>
</p><p>Despite these criticisms, the apparent Simpson's paradox remains a popular and intriguing topic in statistics and data analysis. It continues to be studied and debated by researchers and practitioners in a wide range of fields, and it serves as a valuable reminder of the importance of careful statistical analysis and the potential pitfalls of simplistic interpretations of data.
