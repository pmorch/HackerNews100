    </div><p>A new pathway that is used by cancer cells to infiltrate the brain has been discovered by a team of Canadian and American research groups led by the Singh Lab at McMaster University. The research also reveals a new therapy that shows promise in blocking and killing these tumors.</p>

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    <p>The research, published in <i>Nature Medicine</i> on Aug. 2, 2024, offers new hope and potential treatments for glioblastoma, the most aggressive form of brain cancer.</p>
<p>With existing treatments like surgery, <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/radiation+therapy/" rel="tag">radiation therapy</a> and chemotherapy, the tumors often return, and patient survival is limited to only a few months. With this new treatment, the returning cancer cells were destroyed at least 50% of the time in two of the three diseases tested in preclinical animal models.</p>
<p>To discover the pathway cancer cells use to infiltrate the brain, researchers used large-scale gene editing technology to compare gene dependencies in glioblastoma when it was initially diagnosed and after it returned following standard treatments. By doing this, researchers discovered a new pathway used for axonal guidance—a signaling axis that helps establish normal brain architecture—that can become overrun by cancer cells.</p>
<p>"In glioblastoma, we believe that the tumor hijacks this signaling pathway and uses it to invade and infiltrate the brain," says co-senior author Sheila Singh, professor with McMaster's Department of Surgery and director of the Center for Discovery in Cancer Research. The research was also co-led by Jason Moffat, head of the Genetics and Genome Biology program at The Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids).</p>
<p>"If we can block this pathway, the hope is that we can block the invasive spread of glioblastoma and kill tumor cells that cannot be removed surgically," says Singh.</p>

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                <h2>Promising new therapeutic</h2>
<p>To stop the invasion of cancer cells, researchers targeted the hijacked signaling pathway using different strategies including a drug developed by John Lazo's group at the University of Virginia, and also by developing a <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/new+therapy/" rel="tag">new therapy</a> with help from Kevin Henry and Martin Rossotti at the National Research Council Canada using CAR T cells to target the pathway in the brain.</p>
<p>They honed in on a protein called Roundabout Guidance Receptor 1 (ROBO1) that helps guide certain cells, similar to a GPS.</p>
<p>"We created a type of cell therapy where cells are taken from a patient, edited and then put back in with a new function. In this case, the CAR T cells were genetically edited to have the knowledge and ability to go and find ROBO1 on <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/tumor+cells/" rel="tag">tumor cells</a> in animal models," says lead author Chirayu Chokshi, a former Ph.D. student who worked alongside Singh at McMaster University.</p>
<p>Singh and Chokshi say the treatment can also apply to other invasive brain cancers. In the study, researchers examined models for three different types of cancer including adult glioblastoma, adult lung-to-brain metastasis, and pediatric medulloblastoma. In all three models, treatment led to a doubling of survival time. In two of the three diseases, it led to tumor eradication in at least 50% of the mice.</p>

                                                                                                                                            <p>"In this study, we present a new CAR T therapy that is showing very promising preclinical results in multiple malignant <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/brain/" rel="tag">brain</a> cancer models, including recurrent glioblastoma. We believe our new CAR T therapy is poised for further development and clinical trials," Singh says.</p>
<p>Work on the study was performed with samples derived from patients treated by neurosurgeons with Hamilton Health Sciences. Proteomics discovery which helped to elucidate the new glioblastoma targets was done in collaboration with Thomas Kilinger at Princess Margaret Cancer Center and University of Toronto.</p>
<p>The research was made possible through collaboration with the National Research Council Canada, University of Virginia, University of Pittsburgh and the Princess Margaret Cancer Center.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-111834">
				
				<p> July 24th, 2024 by admin </p>			
				<p>It’s been 2 years since I worked full time in kdb+ but people seem to always want to talk to me about kdb+ and where I think it’s going, so to save rehashing the same debates I’m going to put it here and refer to it in future. Please leave a comment if you want and I will reply.</p>
<p>Let’s first look at the use cases for kdb+, then consider the alternatives, then which I think will win for each use-case and why.</p>
<h2>Use Cases</h2>
<p>A. <strong>Historical market data storage and analysis</strong>. – e.g. MS Horizon, Citi CloudKDB, UBS Krypton (3 I worked on).<br>
B. <strong>Local quant analysis</strong> – e.g. Liquidity analysis, PnL analysis, profitability per client.<br>
C. <strong>Real-time Streaming Calcuation Engines</strong> – e.g. Streaming VWAP, Streaming TCA…<br>
D. <strong>Distributed Computing</strong> – e.g. Margin calculations for stock portfolios or risk analysis. Spread data out, perform costly calcs, recombine.</p>
<h2>Alternatives</h2>
<h3>Historical Market Data – kdb+ Alternatives</h3>
<p>A large number of users want to query big data to get minute bars, perform asof joins or more advanced time-series analysis.</p>
<ul>
<li>New Database Technologies – Clickhouse, QuestDB.</li>
<li>Cloud Vendors – Bigquery / redshift</li>
<li>Market Data as a Service</li>
</ul>
<p>Let me tell you three secrets, 1. Most users don’t need the “speed” of kdb+. 2. Most internal bank platforms don’t fully unleash the speed of kdb+. 3. The competitors are now fast enough. I mean clickbench are <a href="https://www.timestored.com/data/time-series-database-benchmarks">totally transparent on benchmarking.</a>.</p>
<p><b>Likely Outcome: – Kdb+ can hold their existing clients</b> but haven’t and won’t get the 2nd tier firms as they either want cloud native or something else. The previous major customers for this had to invest heavily to build their own platform. As far as I’m hearing the kdb cloud platform still needs work.</p>
<h3>Local Quant Analysis – Alternatives</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Python </strong>– with DuckDB</li>
<li><strong>Python </strong>– with Polars</li>
<li><strong>Python </strong>– with PyKX</li>
<li><strong>Python </strong>– with dataframe/modin/….</li>
</ul>
<p>Now I’m exaggerating slightly but the local quant analysis game is over and everyone has realised Python has won. The only question is who will provide the speedy add-on. In one corner we have widely popular free community tools that know how to generate interest at huge scale, are fast and well funded. In the other we have a niche company that never spread outside finance, wants to charge $300K to get started and has an exotic syntax.</p>
<p><b>Likely Outcome: DuckDB or Polars</b>. Why? It’s free. People at Uni will start with it and not change. Any sensible quant currently in a firm will want to use a free tool so that they are guaranteed to be able to use similar analytics at their next firm. WIthout that ability they can only go places that have kdb+ else face losing a large percentage of their skillset.</p>
<h4>Real-time Streaming / Distributed Computing</h4>
<p>These were always the less popular cases for kdb+ and never the ones that “won” the contract. The ironic thing is, combining streaming with historical data in one model is kdbs largest strength. However the few times I’ve seen it done, it’s either taken someone very experienced and skillful or it has become a mess. These messes have been so bad it’s put other parts of the firm off adopting kdb+ for other use cases.</p>
<p><b>Likely Outcome: Unsure which will win but not kdb+</b>. Kafka has won mindshare and is deployed at scale but flink/risingwave etc. are upcoming stars.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Kdb+ is an absolutely amazing technology but it’s about the same amazing today as it was 15 years ago when I started. In that time the world has moved on. <b>The best open source companies have stolen the best kdb+ ideas<b>:</b></b></p>
<ul>
<li>Parquet/Iceberg is basically kdb+ on disk format for optimized column storage.</li>
<li>Apache Arrow – in-memory format is kdb+ in memory column format.</li>
<li>Even Kafka log/replay/ksql concept could be viewed as similar to a tplog viewed from a certain angle.</li>
<li>QuestDB / DuckDB / Clickhouse all have asof joins</li>
</ul>
<p>Not only have the competitors learnt and taken the best parts of kdb+ but they have standardised on them. e.g. Snowflake, Dremio, Confluent, Databricks are all going to support Apache Iceberg/parquet. QuestDB / DuckDB / Python are all going to natively support parquet. This means in comparisons <b>it’s no longer KX against one competitor, it’s KX against many competitors at once</b>. If your data is parquet, you can run any of them against your data.</p>
<p>As many at KX would agree I’ve talked to them for years on issues around this and to be fair they have changed but they are not changing quick enough.<br>
They need to do four things:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Get a free version out there that can be used for many things</b> and have an easy reasonable license for customers with less money to use.</li>
<li><b>Focus on making the core product great.</b> – For years we had Delta this and now it’s kdb.ai. In the meantime mongodb/influxdb won huge contracts with a good database alone.</li>
<li><b>Reduce the steep learning curve</b>. Make kdb+ easier to learn by even changing the language and technology if need be.</li>
<li><b>You must become more popular else it’s a slow death</b></li>
</ol>
<p>This is focussing on the core tech product.<br>
Looking more widely at their financials and other huge costs/initiatives such as AI and massive marketing spending, wider changes at the firm should also be considered.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">
                
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>This article focuses on tasks that application programmers are likely to encounter, particularly in web applications, such as: </p>
<ul>
<li>Reading and writing text files</li>
<li>Reading text, images, JSON from the web</li>
<li>Visiting files in a directory</li>
<li>Reading a ZIP file</li>
<li>Creating a temporary file or directory</li>
</ul>
<p>The Java API supports many other tasks, which are explained in detail in the <a href="https://dev.java/learn/java-io/">Java I/O API tutorial</a>.</p>
<p>This article focuses on API improvements since Java 8. In particular:</p>
<ul>
<li>UTF-8 is the default for I/O since Java 18 (since <a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/400" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JEP 400: UTF-8 by Default</a>)</li>
<li>The <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/docs/api/java.base/java/nio/file/Files.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>java.nio.file.Files</code></a> class, which first appeared in Java 7, added useful methods in Java 8, 11, and 12</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/docs/api/java.base/java/io/InputStream.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>java.io.InputStream</code></a> gained useful methods in Java 9, 11, and 12</li>
<li>The <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/docs/api/java.base/java/io/File.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>java.io.File</code></a> and <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/docs/api/java.base/java/io/BufferedReader.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>java.io.BufferedReader</code></a> classes are now thoroughly obsolete, even though they appear frequently in web searches and AI chats.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="reading-text-files">Reading Text Files</h2>
<p>You can read a text file into a string like this:</p>
<pre><code>String content = Files.readString(path);
</code></pre>
<p>Here, <code>path</code> is an instance of <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/docs/api/java.base/java/nio/file/Path.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>java.nio.Path</code></a>, obtained like this:</p>
<pre><code>var path = Path.of("/usr/share/dict/words");
</code></pre>
<p>Before Java 18, you were strongly encouraged to specify the character encoding with any file operations that read or write strings. Nowadays, by far the most common character encoding is UTF-8, but for backwards compatibility, Java used the "platform encoding", which can be a legacy encoding on Windows. To ensure portability, text I/O operations needed parameters <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/docs/api/java.base/java/nio/charset/StandardCharsets.html#UTF_8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>StandardCharsets.UTF_8</code></a>. This is no longer necessary.</p>
<p>If you want the file as a sequence of lines, call</p>
<pre><code>List&lt;String&gt; lines = Files.readAllLines(path);
</code></pre>
<p>If the file is large, process the lines lazily as a <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/docs/api/java.base/java/util/stream/Stream.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>Stream&lt;String&gt;</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>try (Stream&lt;String&gt; lines = Files.lines(path)) {
    . . .
}
</code></pre>
<p>Also use <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/docs/api/java.base/java/nio/file/Files.html#lines(java.nio.file.Path)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>Files.lines</code></a> if you can naturally process lines with stream operations (such as <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/docs/api/java.base/java/util/stream/Stream.html#map(java.util.function.Function)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>map</code></a>, <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/docs/api/java.base/java/util/stream/Stream.html#filter(java.util.function.Predicate)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>filter</code></a>). Note that the stream returned by <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/docs/api/java.base/java/nio/file/Files.html#lines(java.nio.file.Path)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>Files.lines</code></a> needs to be closed. To ensure that this happens, use a <em>try-with-resources</em> statement, as in the preceding code snippet.</p>
<p>There is no longer a good reason to use the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/docs/api/java.base/java/io/BufferedReader.html#readLine()" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>readLine</code></a> method of <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/docs/api/java.base/java/io/BufferedReader.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>java.io.BufferedReader</code></a>.</p>
<p>To split your input into something else than lines, use a <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Scanner.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>java.util.Scanner</code></a>. For example, here is how you can read words, separated by non-letters:</p>
<pre><code>Stream&lt;String&gt; tokens = new Scanner(path).useDelimiter("\\PL+").tokens();
</code></pre>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Scanner.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>Scanner</code></a> class also has methods for reading numbers, but it is generally simpler to read the input as one string per line, or a single string, and then parse it. </p>
<p>Be careful when parsing numbers from text files, since their format may be locale-dependent. For example, the input <code>100.000</code> is 100.0 in the US locale but 100000.0 in the German locale. Use <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/docs/api/java.base/java/text/NumberFormat.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>java.text.NumberFormat</code></a> for locale-specific parsing. Alternatively, you may be able to use <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Integer.html#parseInt(java.lang.String)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>Integer.parseInt</code></a>/<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Double.html#parseDouble(java.lang.String)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>Double.parseDouble</code></a>.</p>

<h2 id="writing-text-files">Writing Text Files</h2>
<p>You can write a string to a text file with a single call:</p>
<pre><code>String content = . . .;
Files.writeString(path, content);
</code></pre>
<p>If you have a list of lines rather than a single string, use:</p>
<pre><code>List&lt;String&gt; lines = . . .;
Files.write(path, lines);
</code></pre>
<p>For more general output, use a <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/docs/api/java.base/java/io/PrintWriter.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>PrintWriter</code></a> if you want to use the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/docs/api/java.base/java/io/PrintWriter.html#printf(java.lang.String,java.lang.Object...)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>printf</code></a> method:</p>
<pre><code>var writer = new PrintWriter(path.toFile());
writer.printf(locale, "Hello, %s, next year you'll be %d years old!%n", name, age + 1);
</code></pre>
<p>Note that <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/docs/api/java.base/java/io/PrintWriter.html#printf(java.lang.String,java.lang.Object...)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>printf</code></a> is locale-specific. When writing numbers, be sure to write them in the appropriate format. Instead of using <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/docs/api/java.base/java/io/PrintWriter.html#printf(java.lang.String,java.lang.Object...)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>printf</code></a>, consider <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/docs/api/java.base/java/text/NumberFormat.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>java.text.NumberFormat</code></a> or <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Integer.html#toString()" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>Integer.toString</code></a>/<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Double.html#Double.html#toString(double)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>Double.toString</code></a>.</p>
<p>Weirdly enough, as of Java 21, there is no <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/docs/api/java.base/java/io/PrintWriter.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>PrintWriter</code></a> constructor with a <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/docs/api/java.base/java/nio/file/Path.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>Path</code></a> parameter.</p>
<p>If you don't use <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/docs/api/java.base/java/io/PrintWriter.html#printf(java.lang.String,java.lang.Object...)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>printf</code></a>, you can use the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/docs/api/java.base/java/io/BufferedWriter.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>BufferedWriter</code></a> class and write strings with the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/docs/api/java.base/java/io/BufferedWriter.html#write(int)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>write</code></a> method. </p>
<pre><code>var writer = Files.newBufferedWriter(path);
writer.write(line); // Does not write a line separator
writer.newLine(); 
</code></pre>
<p>Remember to close the <code>writer</code> when you are done.</p>

<h2 id="reading-from-an-input-stream">Reading From an Input Stream</h2>
<p>Perhaps the most common reason to use a stream is to read something from a web site.</p>
<p>If you need to set request headers or read response headers, use the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/docs/api/java.net.http/java/net/http/HttpClient.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>HttpClient</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>HttpClient client = HttpClient.newBuilder().build();
HttpRequest request = HttpRequest.newBuilder()
    .uri(URI.create("https://horstmann.com/index.html"))
    .GET()
    .build();
HttpResponse&lt;String&gt; response = client.send(request, HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofString());
String result = response.body();
</code></pre>
<p>That is overkill if all you want is the data. Instead, use:</p>
<pre><code>InputStream in = new URI("https://horstmann.com/index.html").toURL().openStream();
</code></pre>
<p>Then read the data into a byte array and optionally turn them into a string:</p>
<pre><code>byte[] bytes = in.readAllBytes();
String result = new String(bytes);
</code></pre>
<p>Or transfer the data to an output stream:</p>
<pre><code>OutputStream out = Files.newOutputStream(path);
in.transferTo(out);
</code></pre>
<p>Note that no loop is required if you simply want to read all bytes of an input stream. </p>
<p>But do you really need an input stream? Many APIs give you the option to read from a file or URL. </p>
<p>Your favorite JSON library is likely to have methods for reading from a file or URL. For example, with <a href="https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-jr">Jackson jr</a>:</p>
<pre><code>URL url = new URI("https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random").toURL();
Map&lt;String, Object&gt; result = JSON.std.mapFrom(url);
</code></pre>
<p>Here is how to read the dog image from the preceding call:</p>
<pre><code>URL url = new URI(result.get("message").toString()).toURL();
BufferedImage img = javax.imageio.ImageIO.read(url);
</code></pre>
<p>This is better than passing an input stream to the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/docs/api/java.desktop/javax/imageio/ImageIO.html#read(java.net.URL)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>read</code></a> method, because the library can use additional information from the URL to determine the image type.</p>

<h2 id="the-files-api">The Files API</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/docs/api/java.base/java/nio/file/Files.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>java.nio.file.Files</code></a> class provides a comprehensive set of file operations, such as creating, copying, moving, and deleting files and directories. The <a href="https://dev.java/learn/java-io/file-system/">File System Basics</a> tutorial provides a thorough description. In this section, I highlight a few common tasks.</p>
<h3 id="traversing-entries-in-directories-and-subdirectories">Traversing Entries in Directories and Subdirectories</h3>
<p>For most situations you can use one of two methods. The <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/docs/api/java.base/java/nio/file/Files.html#list(java.nio.file.Path)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>Files.list</code></a> method visits all entries (files, subdirectories, symbolic links) of a directory.</p>
<pre><code>try (Stream&lt;Path&gt; entries = Files.list(pathToDirectory)) {
    . . .
}
</code></pre>
<p>Use a <em>try-with-resources</em> statement to ensure that the stream object, which keeps track of the iteration, will be closed.</p>
<p>If you also want to visit the entries of descendant directories, instead use the method <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/docs/api/java.base/java/nio/file/Files.html#walk(java.nio.file.Path,java.nio.file.FileVisitOption...)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>Files.walk</code></a></p>
<pre><code>Stream&lt;Path&gt; entries = Files.walk(pathToDirectory);
</code></pre>
<p>Then simply use stream methods to home in on the entries that you are interested in, and to collect the results:</p>
<pre><code>try (Stream&lt;Path&gt; entries = Files.walk(pathToDirectory)) {
    List&lt;Path&gt; htmlFiles = entries.filter(p -&gt; p.toString().endsWith("html")).toList();
    . . .
}
</code></pre>
<p>Here are the other methods for traversing directory entries:</p>
<ul>
<li>An overloaded version of <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/docs/api/java.base/java/nio/file/Files.html#walk(java.nio.file.Path,int,java.nio.file.FileVisitOption...)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>Files.walk</code></a> lets you limit the depth of the traversed tree.</li>
<li>Two <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/docs/api/java.base/java/nio/file/Files.html#walkFileTree(java.nio.file.Path,java.nio.file.FileVisitor)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>Files.walkFileTree</code></a> methods provide more control over the iteration process, by notifying a <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/docs/api/java.base/java/nio/file/FileVisitor.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>FileVisitor</code></a> when a directory is visited for the first and last time. This can be occasionally useful, in particularly for emptying and deleting a tree of directories. See the tutorial <a href="https://dev.java/learn/java-io/file-system/walking-tree/">Walking the File Tree</a> for details. Unless you need this control, use the simpler <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/docs/api/java.base/java/nio/file/Files.html#walk(java.nio.file.Path,java.nio.file.FileVisitOption...)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>Files.walk</code></a> method.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/docs/api/java.base/java/nio/file/Files.html#find(java.nio.file.Path,int,java.util.function.BiPredicate,java.nio.file.FileVisitOption...)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>Files.find</code></a> method is just like <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/docs/api/java.base/java/nio/file/Files.html#walk(java.nio.file.Path,java.nio.file.FileVisitOption...)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>Files.walk</code></a>, but you provide a filter that inspects each path and its <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/docs/api/java.base/java/nio/file/attribute/BasicFileAttributes.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>BasicFileAttributes</code></a>. This is slightly more efficient than reading the attributes separately for each file.</li>
<li>Two <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/docs/api/java.base/java/nio/file/Files.html#newDirectoryStream(java.nio.file.Path)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>Files.newDirectoryStream(Path)</code></a> methods yields <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/docs/api/java.base/java/nio/file/DirectoryStream.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>DirectoryStream</code></a> instances, which can be used in enhanced <code>for</code> loops. There is no advantage over using <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/docs/api/java.base/java/nio/file/Files.html#list(java.nio.file.Path)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>Files.list</code></a>. </li>
<li>The legacy <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/docs/api/java.base/java/io/File.html#list()" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>File.list</code></a> or <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/docs/api/java.base/java/io/File.html#listFiles()" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>File.listFiles</code></a> methods return file names or <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/docs/api/java.base/java/io/File.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>File</code></a> objects. These are now obsolete.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="working-with-zip-files">Working with ZIP Files</h3>
<p>Ever since Java 1.1, the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/docs/api/java.base/java/util/zip/ZipInputStream.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>ZipInputStream</code></a> and <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/docs/api/java.base/java/util/zip/ZipOutputStream.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>ZipOutputStream</code></a> classes provide an API for processing ZIP files. But the API is a bit clunky. Java 8 introduced a much nicer <em>ZIP file system</em>:</p>
<pre><code>try (FileSystem fs = FileSystems.newFileSystem(pathToZipFile)) {
    . . .
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <em>try-with-resources</em> statement ensures that the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/AutoCloseable.html#close()" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>close</code></a> method is called after the ZIP file operations. That method updates the ZIP file to reflect any changes in the file system.</p>
<p>You can then use the methods of the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/docs/api/java.base/java/nio/file/Files.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>Files</code></a> class. Here we get a list of all files in the ZIP file:</p>
<pre><code>try (Stream&lt;Path&gt; entries = Files.walk(fs.getPath("/"))) {
    List&lt;Path&gt; filesInZip = entries.filter(Files::isRegularFile).toList();
}
</code></pre>
<p>To read the file contents, just use <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/docs/api/java.base/java/nio/file/Files.html#readString(java.nio.file.Path)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>Files.readString</code></a> or <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/docs/api/java.base/java/nio/file/Files.html#readAllBytes(java.nio.file.Path)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>Files.readAllBytes</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>String contents = Files.readString(fs.getPath("/LICENSE"));
</code></pre>
<p>You can remove files with <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/docs/api/java.base/java/nio/file/Files.html#delete(java.nio.file.Path)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>Files.delete</code></a>. To add or replace files, simply use <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/docs/api/java.base/java/nio/file/Files.html#writeString(java.nio.file.Path,java.lang.CharSequence,java.nio.file.OpenOption...)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>Files.writeString</code></a> or <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/docs/api/java.base/java/nio/file/Files.html#write(java.nio.file.Path,byte%5B%5D,java.nio.file.OpenOption...)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>Files.write</code></a>.</p>
<h3 id="creating-temporary-files-and-directories">Creating Temporary Files and Directories</h3>
<p>Fairly often, I need to collect user input, produce files, and run an external process. Then I use temporary files, which are gone after the next reboot, or a temporary directory that I erase after the process has completed.</p>
<p>I use the two methods <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/docs/api/java.base/java/nio/file/Files.html#createTempFile(java.lang.String,java.lang.String,java.nio.file.attribute.FileAttribute...)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>Files.createTempFile</code></a> and <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/docs/api/java.base/java/nio/file/Files.html#createTempDirectory(java.nio.file.Path,java.lang.String,java.nio.file.attribute.FileAttribute...)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>Files.createTempDirectory</code></a> for that. </p>
<pre><code>Path filePath = Files.createTempFile("myapp", ".txt");
Path dirPath = Files.createTempDirectory("myapp");
</code></pre>
<p>This creates a temporary file or directory in a suitable location (<code>/tmp</code> in Linux) with the given prefix and, for a file, suffix.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Web searches and AI chats can suggest needlessly complex code for common I/O operations. There are often better alternatives:</p>
<ol>
<li>You don't need a loop to read or write strings or byte arrays.</li>
<li>You may not even need a stream, reader or writer.</li>
<li>Become familiar with the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/docs/api/java.base/java/nio/file/Files.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>Files</code></a> methods for creating, copying, moving, and deleting files and directories.</li>
<li>Use <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/docs/api/java.base/java/nio/file/Files.html#list(java.nio.file.Path)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>Files.list</code></a> or <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/docs/api/java.base/java/nio/file/Files.html#walk(java.nio.file.Path,java.nio.file.FileVisitOption...)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>Files.walk</code></a> to traverse directory entries.</li>
<li>Use a ZIP file system for processing ZIP files.</li>
<li>Stay away from the legacy <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/docs/api/java.base/java/io/File.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>File</code></a> class.</li>
</ol>

<a href="https://github.com/jart/sectorlisp">SectorLISP</a> now supports
garbage collection. This is the first time that a high-level garbage
collected programming language has been optimized to fit inside the
512-byte boot sector of a floppy disk. Since we only needed 436 bytes,
that means LISP has now outdistanced
<a href="https://github.com/cesarblum/sectorforth">FORTH</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/nanochess/bootBASIC">BASIC</a> to be
the tiniest programming language in the world.

</p><p>
SectorLISP consists of 223 lines of assembly. It provides a LISP system
that's powerful enough to let you write your own LISP interpreter in
just 40 lines of LISP. It's compatible with all PC models dating back to
1981 which have at least 64kb of RAM. This isn't a toy because
<a href="https://justine.lol/sectorlisp2/proof.html">SectorLISP can run the proof assistant</a> that was
included in LISP 1.5. We achieved the small file size thanks to 20/20
hindsight and an unbiased approach of <em>maximum austerity</em>. The
goal of this project has been to have fun building a kit that optimizes
for file size at the expense of everything else, which means SectorLISP
has more in common with a game
like <a href="https://www.decisionproblem.com/paperclips/">Universal
Paperclips</a> than a talking paperclip like
<a href="https://justine.lol/sectorlisp2/clippy.png">Clippy</a>.

</p><p>
This is a follow-up to a previous announcement made in October
that <a href="https://justine.lol/sectorlisp/">SectorLISP now fits in
one sector</a>. There's been many changes over the past few months that
made it possible to shave away another hundred bytes from the i8086
assembly implementation. It left plenty of room to add a 40 byte garbage
collector. This blog post will tell the story of how our low-level
<a href="#listing">assembly listing</a> evolved, using a plain and
simple C / JavaScript / Thompson Shell polyglot.

The .bin floppy disk boot sectors can be emulated using
<a href="https://justine.lol/blinkenlights/">Blinkenlights</a> or QEMU, or you can watch
the video below.

</p><pre>curl --compressed https://justine.lol/sectorlisp2/blinkenlights.com &gt;blinkenlights.com
curl https://justine.lol/sectorlisp2/sectorlisp-friendly.bin &gt;sectorlisp-friendly.bin
chmod +x blinkenlights.com
./blinkenlights.com -rt sectorlisp-friendly.bin  <span># then press 'c'</span>
qemu-system-i386 -nographic -fda sectorlisp-friendly.bin
</pre>

<p>
The .com file is slightly larger but it runs on seven operating systems.
It's the same as the JS simulator below.

</p><pre>curl https://justine.lol/sectorlisp2/lisp.com &gt;lisp.com
chmod +x lisp.com
./lisp.com

See the <a href="#listing">assembly listing</a> listing section. You can
build the simulator on your UNIX system if <code>cc</code> is installed:

Building from source means you get a better command line interface. The
shell script above will curl a GNU Readline replacement we wrote called
<a href="https://github.com/jart/bestline">Bestline</a> from this same
domain (justine.lol) to make sure you have the latest copy, because
we've been slowly but steadily recreating support for Emacs' famous
Paredit-style editing features.

You can use SectorLISP from the comfort of your browser. The C /
JavaScript source code is intended to roughly model the behavior of
SectorLISP on bare metal. Since maximum austerity leaves a bad
impression for developers getting started, this simulator is from the
<a href="https://github.com/jart/sectorlisp/tree/friendly">friendly
branch</a> which uses an extended 509 byte implementation that'll be a
much better friend for you, since it prints errors on undefined behavior
and lets you <code>DEFINE</code> persistent bindings.

<p>
  Jim Leonard was able to confirm for us that SectorLISP does in fact
  run on the original hardware, or more specifically, the IBM PC model
  5150. That was quite thrilling to learn, since SectorLISP was largely
  written <em>a priori</em> using a emulator on Linux that we created.

</p><p>
  <a href="https://youtu.be/xD14SLU2u2k" target="_blank">

      <source srcset="https://worker.jart.workers.dev/sectorlisp2/tinylisp.avif" type="image/avif">

      <img width="960" height="540" src="https://worker.jart.workers.dev/sectorlisp2/tinylisp.png" alt="[YouTube Video of SectorLISP running on IBM PC 5150]">

</p><p>
  His video provides more background on what boot sectors are. He talks
  about similar projects that have been created in the past, such as
  Oscar Toledo's pioneering work. Then, towards the end of the video,
  you get to watch SectorLISP actually running on one of the finest
  computers ever sold, which has been preserved in perfect quality.

</p><p>
  For example, you can hear the thunk of the power switch on the IBM PC.
  It's about as pleasing to hear as the thud sound an expensive German
  car like a Mercedes makes when you close the door. But the most
  pleasing of all is the vintage Model F mechanical keyboard, which to
  this day remains quite possibly the greatest and most respected
  mechanical keyboard of all time. No keyboard exists in the world
  that's superior in quality to those sold with the original IBM PC,
  except for the tenkeyless version of the
  <a href="https://justine.lol/sectorlisp2/modelf-apl.jpg">Model F with APL legends</a> on the keycaps,
  or better yet, the <a href="https://youtu.be/hNRH1ULmbNA">IBM 3278
  Beam Spring</a> keyboard for which the Model F was intended to be a
  more economical replacement.

</p><h2 id="emulation"><a href="#emulation">Emulation</a></h2>

<p>
Here's a demo of SectorLISP v2 booting from BIOS in
<a href="https://justine.lol/blinkenlights/">Blinkenlights</a> and running the
metacircular evaluator, i.e. LISP written in LISP. If you compare this
video to the one from the
<a href="https://justine.lol/sectorlisp/">previous blog post</a>
you'll see how the new garbage collector has dramatically changed the
personality of the software, in terms of how it uses physical memory.
The WRITE memory panel in particular dances more, and shows how its
heap allocations behave very similar to a stack. You can also use
SectorLISP v1.o online in a PC browser emulator by visiting
<a href="https://copy.sh/v86/?profile=sectorlisp">copy.sh/v86/</a>.

</p>

<p>
If you're looking for something more modern, the multiplatform lisp.com
executable also runs on bare metal. Here's a Blinkenlights demo of it
booting from BIOS in 16-bit real mode. It then bootstraps itself into
32-bit mode so it can load itself off disk into memory. The final stage
of bootstrapping <a href="https://justine.lol/sectorlisp2/inverted.jpg">inverts the physical memory</a>,
in a similar manner to the Linux Kernel, which enables it to run in
64-bit long mode. Once it's reached the zenith of computing modernity,
it displays a LISP REPL via the serial port.

</p>

<p>
Keep in mind that the LISP operating system above that's fast-forwarding
its way through history, is actually just the
<a href="https://justine.lol/sectorlisp2/lisp.js">JavaScript source code</a> built with
<a href="https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan">Cosmopolitan Libc</a>.
Although we tuned it in <a href="https://justine.lol/sectorlisp2/lisp.c">lisp.c</a> for a slight
performance nudge when compiled with GCC.

<p>
The most important trick to implementing LISP is to redefine
<code>NULL</code>.

</p><pre><span>function</span> Set(i, x) {
  M[Null + i] = x;
}

<span>function</span> Get(i) {
  <span>return</span> M[Null + i];
}
</pre>

<p>
LISP has two types of memory: atoms and cons cells. We store them in two
adjacent stacks that grow outward from <code>NULL</code>.

</p><p>
  Positive addresses are used to intern strings. Interning is good for
  storing symbols (which LISP calls atoms) since it lets us test string
  equality by comparing unique addresses. First among atoms
  is <code>NIL</code> which the assembly encodes as
  a <code>NUL</code>-terminated string residing at the
  <code>NULL</code> address.

</p><p>
  Negative addresses are used to store <code>Pair&lt;int&gt;</code>
  tuples, which LISP calls cons cells. These are used to chain atoms
  together into data structures such as lists and binary trees. First
  among cons cells is the empty list <code>()</code> which is stored at
  negative <code>NULL</code> and therefore equal to <code>NIL</code>.
  This multifacted nature of <code>NIL</code> serves as evidence of how
  LISP's design lends itself to symmetrical partitioning of memory, even
  if the underlying machine arithmetic doesn't support signed zero.
  Negative memory then grows down as <code>CONS</code> is called, which
  returns tuples indexed by <code>CAR</code> and <code>CDR</code>.

</p><table>
<tbody><tr><td>
<pre><span>function</span> Cons(car, cdr) {
  Set(--cx, cdr);
  Set(--cx, car);
  <span>return</span> cx;
}
</pre>
</td><td>
<pre><span>function</span> Car(x) {
  <span>return</span> Get(x);
}

<span>function</span> Cdr(x) {
  <span>return</span> Get(x + 1);
}
</pre>
</td></tr></tbody></table>

<p>
The assembly version does things the same way with the slight difference
that cons cells grow up from <code>INT_MIN</code> rather than growing
down from zero. Doing that made the code smaller, but it also lets us
make the claim that it runs on the stock configuration of the first IBM
PC, which shipped with 64kb of RAM. It's because
rebasing <code>NULL</code> on the boot address <code>0x7c00</code> gives
negative memory a legal range of <code>-0x8000</code>
to <code>-0x7c00</code> since only <code>0x10000</code> bytes of linear
memory exist. Working within the constraints of an old computer like
i8086 that required us to confront unfamiliar concepts like negative
memory is what helped the most elegant approach for C and JavaScript to
become clear.

</p><table class="page">
<tbody><tr><td>
<pre><span>function</span> ReadList() {
  <span>var</span> x = Read();
  <span>if</span> (x &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; Get(t) == Ord(<span>')'</span>)) {
    <span>return</span> -0;
  } <span>else</span> {
    <span>return</span> Cons(x, ReadList(t));
  }
}
</pre>
</td><td>
<pre><span>function</span> Print(x) {
  <span>if</span> (1./x &lt; 0) {
    PrintList(x);
  } <span>else</span> {
    PrintAtom(x);
  }
}
</pre>
</td></tr></tbody></table>

<p>
One advantage of JavaScript is that it uses a sign-magnitude encoding
similar to the IBM 704 computer for which LISP was designed. That means
we can tell <code>()</code> apart from <code>NIL</code> in
our <code>Read</code> and <code>Print</code> code, even
though <code>Eval</code> doesn't care about signed zeroes. The divide by
zero hack can test for cons cells including <code>()</code>
because <code>1/-0 = -Infinity</code> and <code>-Infinity &lt; 0</code>.
C environments with integral two's complement arithmetic will simply
normalize <code>()</code> to <code>NIL</code> and the floating point
operations can be optimized away automatically
using <code>-ffast-math</code>.

LISP evaluation works by recursively calling <code>Apply</code> to
transform the first element of a list into a lambda. It zips the
arguments with their parameters into the environment variables, and runs
the code contained in the function.

</p><pre>Eval(code=(SECOND ARG1 ARG2),
     vars={SECOND=(LAMBDA (X Y) Y), ARG1=FOO, ARG2=BAR}) →
  Apply(code=((LAMBDA (X Y) Y) FOO BAR),
        vars={SECOND=(LAMBDA (X Y) Y), ARG1=FOO, ARG2=BAR}) →
    Eval(code=Y,
         vars={X=FOO, Y=BAR, SECOND=(LAMBDA (X Y) Y), ARG1=FOO, ARG2=BAR}) →
BAR

John McCarthy discovered an elegant self-defining way to compute the
above steps, more commonly known as the metacircular evaluator. Alan Kay
once described this code as the "Maxwell's equations of software".
Here are those equations as implemented by SectorLISP:

The code above is from <a href="https://justine.lol/sectorlisp2/lisp.js">lisp.js</a>. What makes our
Rosetta Stone possible is that C was designed to use <code>int</code> as
an implicit default type, and compilers maintained backwards
compatibility ever since. Traditional C may as well be Sanskrit since it
can't be a coincidence that the languages with the most gravitas seem to
share this as their common subset. It's unfortunate the C standards
committee intends to remove support for K&amp;R syntax, because it
implements LISP so well. Let's compare the code above to John McCarthy's
original 1950's paper which used M-expression notation:

</p><pre class="page">eval[e; a] = [
  atom[e] → assoc[e; a];
  atom[car[e]] → [
    eq[car[e]; QUOTE] → cadr[e];
    eq[car[e]; ATOM]  → atom[eval[cadr[e]; a]];
    eq[car[e]; EQ]    → [eval[cadr[e]; a] = eval[caddr[e]; a]];
    eq[car[e]; COND]  → evcon[cdr[e]; a];
    eq[car[e]; CAR]   → car[eval[cadr[e]; a]];
    eq[car[e]; CDR]   → cdr[eval[cadr[e]; a]];
    eq[car[e]; CONS]  → cons[eval[cadr[e]; a]; eval[caddr[e]; a]];
    T                 → eval[cons[assoc[car[e]; a]; evlis[cdr[e]; a]]; a]
  ];
  eq[caar[e]; LAMBDA] →
    eval[caddar[e]; append[pair[cadar[e]; evlis[cdr[e]; a]; a]]]
]
</pre>

<p>
It's a good thing that C wasn't designed until the 1970's since
otherwise JMC might never have discovered LISP. Or maybe the semicolons,
equals sign, and brackets that behave
like <code>switch</code>, <code>PROGN</code>, and <code>COND</code>
suggest the existence of a lost language that both Ritchie and JMC were
fortunate enough to use. It's unlikely, but it'd explain why he felt so
unhappy working with IBM on FORTRAN since it would be like asking a Rust
developer to fix Visual Basic 6. IBM likely knew he was uniquely
qualified to help them, but they didn't accept any of his proposals,
rejecting his asks for features like recursion as unnecessary. LISP
happened as a result. It was a big opportunity loss for both the IBM PC
and JMC himself, since he could have been Bill Gates if the two had
found a way to work together.

</p><h2 class="page" id="garbage"><a href="#garbage">Garbage Collection</a></h2>

<p>
SectorLISP uses what we call an ABC garbage collector and it took only
40 bytes of assembly. It works by saving the position of the cons stack
before and after evaluation. Those values are called A and B. It then
decreases the cx cons stack pointer further by recursively copying the
<code>Eval</code> result. The new stack position is called C. The memory
between B and C is then copied up to A. Once that happens, the new cons
stack position becomes A - B + C. The purpose of this operation is to
discard all the cons cells that got created which aren't part of the
result, because we know for certain they can't be accessed anymore
(assuming functions aren't added which mutate cells).

<p>
Fast immediate garbage collection with zero memory overhead and perfect
heap defragmentation is as easy as ABC when your language guarantees
data structures are acyclic. The trick is to not copy anything above A,
since that memory space consists of cons cells owned by calling
functions as well as interned atoms, which should be ignored. That way
overlaps aren't possible. Thus a GC cycle can't increase memory usage.

</p><h2 class="page" id="initialization"><a href="#initialization">Initialization</a></h2>

<p>
In order to bootstrap LISP one must first bootstrap its builtin atoms.
In C you might do that using a for loop which copies chars from a string
to the memory array. However the assembly implementation doesn't need to
do anything.

<p>
x86 processors have a feature that lets us literally
redefine <code>NULL</code> to be the address to which our program is
loaded by the BIOS. It's a privilege that's normally reserved only for
operating systems. The trick we use here is to treat the program image
itself as a set of entries in the interned strings table.

</p><p>
One problem that arises is that the BIOS asks the CPU to execute the
ASCII strings at the beginning of the image. By sheer luck we learned
<code>NIL</code> and <code>T</code> could be safely decoded without
side-effects. Had that not been the case, we'd've needed to choose a
different terminator than <code>NUL</code> which would have made the
program file larger.

One thing you may be wondering about the above sector, is what's the
point of making it smaller than 512 bytes if you have to pad it to 512
bytes anyway to include the U¬ (AA55h) boot signature? The answer is
that we simply learned more about LISP by doing it. But it's also
because that signature wasn't part of the original PC design. It was
actually added by Microsoft to later models, similar to the more
recently introduced requirements that the Linux Kernel be distributed as
a Windows executable. The IBM PC XT will happily load and run the 436
byte version and it's a nice design.

</p><h2 class="page" id="overlapping"><a href="#overlapping">Overlapping Functions</a></h2>

<p>
If high-level programming languages like C are the Ice Hotel and
assembly is the tip of the iceberg, then the hidden dimension of
complexity lurking beneath would be Intel's variable length encoding.
This is where boot sectors get esoteric real fast, since tools can't
easily visualize it. for example, consider the following:

Similar to how a Chess game may unfold very differently if a piece is
moved to an unintended adjacent square, an x86 program can take on an
entirely different meaning if the instruction pointer becomes off by
one. We were able to use this to our advantage, since that lets us code
functions in such a way that they overlap with one another.

<p>
It takes about 10 milliseconds on a 4.77mhz IBM PC to run to run a LISP
program wrapped inside John McCarthy's metacircular evaluator. However
an obvious bottleneck exists with the interning algorithm which takes
upwards of 50 milliseconds during the <code>Read</code> operation. Even
on a forty year old computer, fifty milliseconds of latency is quite
sluggish in terms of performance; so let's fix that.

</p><p>
Tinier solutions are usually better ones, but that's not always the
case. The assembly version of our <code>Intern</code> function has an
obvious scalability bottleneck since it saves space by using a
double-nul-terminated list. The simplest way to improve that is to
redefine positive memory to be a hash table containing linked lists of
characters.

<p>
The trick here is to find a hash function so that <code>NIL</code>
interns at the <code>NULL</code> position and <code>T</code> interns at
1. That's what lets our <code>Apply</code> code be more elegant. In the
above example, the magic numbers (3083, 3191, 4) were chosen under the
assumption that Null is 040000. If it were a different two-power like
0400000, then the magnums would be (60611, 20485, 0). If you wish to
dive deeper then take a look at

One of the known issues with recursive functions is that they have
suboptimal performance without the aid of a tail call optimizer that can
do copy elision. This can have a negative impact on the performance of
the ABC Garbage Collector in list building functions such as the one
above. Blinkenlights is good at spotting scalability problems early.

The canonical workaround to this kind of problem is to use binary trees
instead of lists for big data, since binary trees will reduce the the

One thing profiling reveals is that LISP spends most of its time inside
<code>Assoc</code> looking up variables, because recursive functions
repeatedly append the same variables to the dynamically-scoped
<code>a</code> list. One low-hanging fruit optimization that's much
easier than implementing a tail-call optimizer is simply tuning
<code>Pairlis</code> to peel away repeated variables.

</p><pre><span>function</span> Peel(x, a) {
  <span>return</span> a &amp;&amp; x == Car(Car(a)) ? Cdr(a) : a;
}

<span>function</span> Pairlis(x, y, a) {
  <span>return</span> x ? Cons(Cons(Car(x), Car(y)),
                  Pairlis(Cdr(x), Cdr(y),
                          Peel(Car(x), a))) : a;
}
</pre>

<p>
The above optimization allows SectorLISP to outperform Emacs, based on a
benchmark of the "Triple LISP" example available under the Simulator
Load button. See <a href="https://justine.lol/sectorlisp2/eval4.lisp">eval4.lisp</a> for the Emacs Lisp
translation. Emacs takes 2,187µs to run that, whereas SectorLISP takes
1580µs. This hack also helped reduce JavaScript latency from ~30ms to
~15ms.

<p>
LISP 1.5 is a real trickster compared to modern LISP implementations
because it clandestinely maps <code>T</code> to <code>*TRUE*</code> the
latter of which is the true truth, since it's what builtin predicates
like <code>ATOM</code> and <code>EQ</code> actually return. It figures
they would quote someone who was tormenting Hector's widow since that
design probably tormented many MIT students. LISP 1.5 also jealously
guards its definition of truth, and will throw a constant error if you
try to change it.

</p><p>
A Latin phrase that better describes SectorLISP is <span lang="la" aria-label="NIHIL NUMQUAM PERIT"> NIHIL NVMQVAM PERIT</span>
or in English <em>what is dead may never die</em>. What it means is
that <code>NIL</code> is the only atom SectorLISP won't let you
redefine. You can however define <code>T</code> to have any meaning you
wish, or use it as a variable name, since it's just an atom, and
anything that isn't <code>NIL</code> is considered true by
<code>EVCON</code>. From a programming perspective, this means you'd
need to use something like <code>(QUOTE T)</code> rather
than <code>T</code> in the default clauses of your <code>COND</code>
statements, unless you map <code>T</code> to <code>T</code>.

</p><p>
We chose this model simply because it's what made the file size tinier.
So it actually can be a good idea to have a less permissive design which
prevents <code>T</code> from perishing, because making that a builtin
feature of <code>Eval</code> alone can improve the performance of the
arithmetic code below by ten percent.

</p><h2 class="page" id="arithmetic"><a href="#arithmetic">Arithmetic</a></h2>

<p>
SectorLISP doesn't support numbers; but that's OK, since Arabic numerals
are after all just a sequence of digits, and digits are symbols. Since
SectorLISP does support sequences and symbols, you can use LISP's
preschool math to implement elementary maths like arithmetic. All you
need is a few lines of code. The simplest way we could model unsigned
integers is by using lists and then switching the Arabic right-to-left
ordering to be left-to-right instead (i.e. little endian). We'll then
define
<code>NIL</code> as 0, and anything that isn't
<code>NIL</code> shall be 1. For example, a number such as ten
(or <code>0b1010</code> in binary) could then be encoded as <code>(NIL T
NIL T)</code>. Now that we've defined how our LISP numbers look, we can
implement recursive functions that operate on them.

The above code iterates over two lists of bits and then applies the full
adder schematic. The nice thing about this code is it supports arbitrary
precision. The Googlepedia solution to this kind of problem is to use
Church numerals; but since Church encoding requires an amount of memory
equal to the numbers themselves, that means we wouldn't be able to have
numbers larger than 8192 on the IBM PC XT. That might be fine for
proving theorems, but how would you like to own a 13-bit computer?
SectorLISP instead unleashes your oldskool 16-bit CPU, enabling it to
perform 64-bit and even 128-bit computations.

</p><p class="page">
Since microoptimizations are very highly prized in arithmetic, one way
we might do that with SectorLISP by using builtins more and taking
advantage of friendly branch features, such as dot cons literals which
let us remove a <code>CAR</code> call. The friendly branch also defines
<code>CAR</code> and <code>CDR</code> the modern way which means we
don't need to define <code>HEAD</code> and <code>TAIL</code> plus it
obfuscates the need for a wrapper. If we combine those techniques with a
builtin tautology atom then this new definition should triple addition
performance with a nice raw quality that self-documents the truth table.

<p>
Another interesting thing about our arithmetic model is how the loose
typing of truthiness means that S-expressions in general could be seen
as having numeric values, almost like Hebrew numerals. We haven't
imagined a use case for it yet, but let us know if you do, since that
could be very cool.

</p><h2 class="page" id="calculus"><a href="#calculus">Calculus</a></h2>

<p>
Arithmetic in SectorLISP is very elegant, but unfortunately the numbers
themselves aren't that readable unless you write a radix converter and
reverse the lists. So calculus and algebra are usually better use cases
for LISP since their inputs and outputs are already symbolic sequences
and LISP is a symbolic language. Here's an example of how you can use
SectorLISP to perform symbolic differentiation with support for the most
common mathematical operators.

<p>
Once again we see LISP's ability to not only compute, but elegantly
explain complex topics too, such as derivatives. LISP obviously knows
nothing about the meaning of the symbols you choose, such
as <code>COS</code> or <code>0</code> even though it's able to
manipulate them for you at a high level. For that reason, some of the
expressions it outputs, e.g. <code>(ADD 1 0)</code> can obviously be
simplified. LISP is good at doing that too. As a language, LISP is
popular for implementing computer algebra systems as well as compilers,
since simplified math is usually faster math. For example, GCC actually
uses a dialect of LISP internally for exactly this purpose. So even if
your experience has been focused on writing C and C++ in Vim, you may
already be a LISP user enjoying the benefits, from a certain point of
view.

</p><h2 class="page" id="universality"><a href="#universality">Universality</a></h2>

<p>
The strangest thing that became apparent in our quest to demo a language
that's based on the lambda calculus is that the lambda keyword itself is
superfluous. That's not to imply LISP doesn't have lambdas, but rather
that it's such a powerful concept that it needn't be named.
<code>Apply</code> is able to check for lambdas
using <code>f&lt;0</code> and then ignores <code>Car(f)</code>. We could
have saved 2 bytes by dropping the <code>LAMBDA</code> keyword
(e.g. <code>(((X) X) (QUOTE ARG))</code> instead of <code>((LAMBDA (X)
X) (QUOTE ARG))</code>) but we left things alone, since it's an obvious
focal point for language revision schemes. It also makes SectorLISP
itself more flexible in terms of syntax. For example, you could
say <code>((FUNCTION (X) X) (QUOTE ARG))</code> or <code>((LOL (X) X)
(QUOTE ARG))</code> and it would mean the same thing. In the friendly
branch, you can also say <code>(DEFINE IDENTITY AS (X) X)</code> rather
than <code>(DEFINE IDENTITY . (LAMBDA (X) X))</code>.

</p><p>
The same concept also applies to <code>COND</code> which can be removed
if we treat the <code>LAMBDA</code> body as an
implicit <code>COND</code>. But it'd only save us 11 bytes. That's too
big a tradeoff for the glory of 425 bytes, which can be viewed in the
<a href="https://github.com/jart/sectorlisp/commit/2a00af296b3e8aff8092652b0350451c4f0be316">reform
branch</a>. Reforming the LISP language has never been our goal, because
it should be your goal. For example, here's how LISP could be defined
using only six builtins, which we'll call
<code>LINK</code>, <code>HEAD</code>, <code>TAIL</code>, 
<code>EQ</code>, <code>ATOM</code>, and <code>Q</code>.

The code above is a LISP within a LISP within a LISP: three levels. You
can use this technique to implement missing features like macros. It
also becomes clear that LISP is a king of kings among programming
languages, since if a language can succinctly implement itself, then it
can also let you easily build any other domain-specific language too (so
long as they also use parenthesis notation). One such DSL we could build
is for a Turing machine, which in this case has been configured to
compute <code>popcount(r) % 2 == 1</code>.

</p><h2 class="page" id="polyglots"><a href="#polyglots">Polyglots</a></h2>

<p>
While knowledge of the technique existed, no one's published software
before that polyglots C and JavaScript, so it's worth going into further
detail on how that works. Language polyglots are similar in spirit to
how a lady or gentleman might choose a communications style that focuses
on a subset of rhetoric all groups feel comfortable hearing. The code
examples in this blog post operate by that same principle, since they're
designed to run in the most popular programming environments. It's the
same technique that was used for <a href="https://justine.lol/ape.html">Actually Portable
Executable</a> which lets us build binaries that run on seven operating
systems.

</p><p>
There's nothing extraordinary about having a coding style that focuses
on what different programmers share in common. It's the initial process
of determining what that software consensus is that's difficult, since
it requires one to not only understand of the requirements of modern
systems, but also undergo an archaeological voyage reading tomes of
legacy code like a librarian in order to understand their phylogenesis.
The results end up being very easy:

</p><pre><span>// plain simple executable code that</span>
<span>// helps c / js communities use lisp</span>
<span>function</span> Apply(f, x, a) {
  <span>if</span> (f &lt; 0)      <span>return</span> Eval(Car(Cdr(Cdr(f))), Pairlis(Car(Cdr(f)), x, a));
  <span>if</span> (f == kEq)   <span>return</span> Car(x) == Car(Cdr(x));
  <span>if</span> (f == kCons) <span>return</span> Cons(Car(x), Car(Cdr(x)));
  <span>if</span> (f == kAtom) <span>return</span> Car(x) &gt;= 0;
  <span>if</span> (f == kCar)  <span>return</span> Car(Car(x));
  <span>if</span> (f == kCdr)  <span>return</span> Cdr(Car(x));
  <span>return</span> Apply(Assoc(f, a), x, a);
}

But not every line of code can be made a good citizen of multiple
languages. We need workarounds for code that's platform specific.

inspired another recent paper called

SectorLISP uses which is similar in spirit (but not intent) is the
PARAGRAPH SEPARATOR (u2029) which
<a href="https://262.ecma-international.org/12.0/#sec-line-terminators">ECMA-262
2021 §12.3</a> defines as a line terminator, whereas ANSI C and nearly
everything else does not.

</p><pre><span>javascript syntax highlighting</span><span>//¶</span><span>`
<em>... C only code goes here ...</em>
//`</span>
</pre>

<p>
It works by sneaking multiline JavaScript strings into C comments, to
serve as a cross-language <code>#ifdef</code> statement. That lets us
ask JavaScript to ignore small portions of code that are only meant for
C compilers. If we wish to ask C to ignore code that's intended only for
JavaScript, then the technique can be used as follows:

</p><pre><span>c syntax highlighting</span><span>//¶`</span>
<span>#if</span> 0
<span>//`</span>
<em>... JavaScript only code goes here ...</em>
<span>//¶`</span>
<span>#endif</span>
<span>//`</span>
</pre>

<p>
It should be a requirement for C projects that call themselves portable.
Codebases like Zlib / InfoZIP use a notorious number
of <code>#ifdef</code> statements to bring the benefits of support for
the DEFLATE algorithm to platforms like VAX, QDOS, Amiga, IBM
System/360, and possibly even those IBM Series/1 minicomputers. If we go
to great lengths using ifdefs to maintain rare platforms, then why
shouldn't we use polyglot ifdefs to support the most popular platform
too? There's wisdom in a LISP that's fits on floppy disks if we consider
that a U.S. nuclear weapons agency got hacked immediately after they
stopped using them<sup><a href="#footnote6">6</a></sup>. They should
have considered LISP instead since it has all the qualities of the old
technologies while continuing to be ahead of its time, even after all
these years.

</p><p>
Please note the PARAGRAPH SEPARATOR (u2029) is normally invisible so
it's been typeset above as PILCROW SIGN (u00b6). Since creative uses of
technology have a tendency to reveal bugs, it should be noted that,
thanks to the limitless configurability of LISP, you'll always have a
safer space for programming since you can tune your Emacs editor as
follows:

SectorLISP is non-revisionist because if we'd gone down the path of
changing the definition of LISP, then it'd've taken us to a place where
lists become tape and then you've got an ASCII Turing machine like
Brainfuck, which can be implemented with only
<a href="https://github.com/jart/sectorlisp/blob/friendly/brainfuck.S">99
bytes</a>. It may be capable of computing everything that's computable,
but can we really call gibberish a programming language?

</p><pre><span>Hello World in Brainf*#k</span>
++++++++[&gt;++++
 [&gt;++&gt;+++&gt;+++&gt;+&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;-]
 &gt;+&gt;+&gt;-&gt;&gt;+[&lt;]&lt;-]
&gt;&gt;.        &gt;---.   +++++++..
+++.       &gt;&gt;.     &lt;-.
&lt;.         +++.    ------.
--------.  &gt;&gt;+.    &gt;++.
</pre>

<p>
If that were the goal, we'd be better served by simply not having an
abstraction layer at all. For example, it's possible in 23 bytes to have
a universal language on x86 simply by exposing the x86 machine language.
If you compile the program below and load it into Blinkenlights then you
can copy and paste the gibberish string for Hello World and it'll print
"hello world". If you can chord then you can type the binary into your
IBM PC with the Model F keyboard too.

Languages like Brainfuck were known in JMC's time, but it was the human
quality of his research that made LISP so attractive. Universal
languages are common enough that one of the biggest challenges in
securing protocols and file formats is demonstrating that they're not
accidentally a Turing machine. For example, the UNICODE stack machine
characters above flirt dangerously close with Turing's thesis. Even
Conway's <a href="https://justine.lol/apelife/">Game of Life</a> was proven to be Turing
complete. On the other hand, LISP is a tool that people want to use.
It's always commanded respect and some companies have built veritable
empires using it. That's why it's such a great find that, thanks to the
simplicity and generality of its original formulas, we were able to
implement LISP in nearly the same number of bytes as Brainfuck.

</p><p>

</p><p>
It might be possible to create something even smaller than Brainfuck.
Computer science provides some clues as to what the tiniest esoteric
boot sector language might be. For example, Marvin Minsky discovered a
7-state 4-symbol universal Turing machine in 1962. The chart above is
from Turlough Neary's PhD thesis which shows a tradeoff between
minimizing symbols and states. If we could find some way to get the
rules for one of these tiny Turing machines to neatly map onto a bitwise
arithmetic hack, similar to the <code>(B11 | r0) &amp; r1 &amp;
~r2</code> <a href="https://justine.lol/sectorlisp2/LifeInTheFastLane.pdf">trick</a> that Browne and
Tavener discovered for Conway's Game of Life, like a NAND gate, then we
might create an esoteric boot sector language so tiny in scale and
austere in its definition that its parsimoniousness would never be
challenged.

Tiny code contests have historically focused on the source code. What
makes that problematic is how it incentivizes obfuscation. On the other
hand, optimizing for binary size usually results in the source code
becoming more elegant. In order to make program files tinier, one must
choose data structures and design patterns that are harmonious with the
way computers work. Doing that requires us to better understand the
nature of the problem.

</p><p>
Is it better to help maintain the largest piece of software in the world
when you can create the tiniest one instead? There's more combinations
in a 512-byte boot sector than there are positions on a Go board. The
fact that people are still publicly developing new boot sector programs
for a forty year old computer should speak for itself. Demoscene is a
relative newcomer compared to Go and Chess, but it could potentially be
a more enjoyable competitive mind sport since Kolmogorov complexity is
AI-hard.

</p><p>
While code golfing is fun, the goal of any technology is to help us
better understand nature and to improve upon the human condition. The
way tinier software conventionally does this is by letting us have more
instances of it at scale. The same is true of nature where the tiniest
creatures are the most predominant. They're called phages and there's
10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 of these guys on earth. The
tiniest phage in the world that's listed in the European Nucleotide
Archive goes by the name Leuconostoc Phage L5 and it has a complete
genome size of 631 bytes. So by the standards of our game, we could say
that LISP has now outdistanced nature too. This of course isn't meant to
imply that smaller is necessarily better. For example, ring tailed
lemurs have a binary footprint of 537
megs<sup><a href="#footnote12">12</a></sup> similar to Racket's 500mb
install size. They're both quite adorable, but certainly not simple.

John McCarthy may have lost out on the opportunity to be the father of
the personal computing software revolution, but there's still a chance
for his ideas to lead the second. The tools for natural engineering
became cheap and open source in recent years. Many people are scrambling
to be the next Monsanto, but what we actually want is the next Linux,
Apple, and Microsoft. We need a tool that can abstract genetics and
proteins in the smallest way possible, similar to how SectorLISP
currently offers the service of abstracting gritty assembly in the
fewest commands. For example one might edit a tiny symbiotic bacteria
like Candidatus Carsonella Ruddii (40,000 bytes) to be a platform for
running LISP programs that would be delivered by printed phages. In
fact, someone might have even figured it out already. It's been public
knowledge for fifty years people can build recombinant organisms, like
the gap between iPhone and SIGSALY. Crispr can be programmed in XML. If
it can be done with LISP instead then we must use it.

SectorLISP started as an experiment in the
<a href="https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan">Cosmopolitan</a> repo where
<a href="https://github.com/jart">Justine Tunney</a> used sed to get
code built by a Linux x86_64 compiler to run in 16-bit mode. Its
original size was 948 bytes, which was gradually reduced with help
from <a href="https://github.com/ilyakurdyukov">Ilya Kurdyukov</a> at
BaseALT and <a href="https://github.com/swolchok">Scott Wolchok</a> at
Facebook. <a href="https://github.com/agreppin">Alain Greppin</a> did a
rewrite after having the brilliant insight of using Steve Russel's
coding techniques from the LISP 1.5 manual which finally let us fit
SectorLISP in one sector.
<a href="https://github.com/peterferrie">Peter Ferrie</a> at Amazon and
Justine reduced SectorLISP further, by another 110 bytes. The ABC
garbage collector was designed and implemented by Justine. The 99 byte
Brainfuck implementation was written by Peter and Justine. The musical
track is an instrumental recording of Das Model by Kraftwerk from 1978.

Marc Feeley and Samuel Yvon recently wrote a paper on
a <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3486606.3486783">Small
Scheme VM, Compiler, and REPL</a> which cites SectorLISP. Rather than
targeting the legacy sector size of 512 bytes, they targeted the modern
4096-byte page size. That enabled them to offer a great deal more value
in a comparatively tiny size, such as a bytecode compiler, which helps
illuminates Gosling's original intentions for Java.

  The announcement that the U.S. nuclear arsenal no longer relies on

  The U.S. National Nuclear Security Administration is believed to have
  been breached by the transitive property because they granted a vendor
  named SolarWinds the ability to remotely manage their systems and
  SolarWinds got hacked, according to Natasha Bertrand and Eric Wolff at
  Politico on December 17<sup>th</sup>, 2020

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://v2.tauri.app/blog/tauri-2-0-0-release-candidate/">https://v2.tauri.app/blog/tauri-2-0-0-release-candidate/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41141962">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>   <p>We are very proud to finally announce the first release candidate for the new major version of Tauri.</p>
<p>After over half a year of beta versions, following over a year of alpha versions we are finally at the point where we consider Tauri 2 stabilized and do no longer expect breaking changes.</p>
<p>We want to use a comparably short release candidate time frame to focus on our documentation and important bug fixes, which have been reported by our awesome community and working group members.</p>
<p>A simplified <a href="#too-long-didnt-read">TL;DR</a> can be found at the end of this post.</p>
<h2 id="the-road-to-stable-and-beyond"><a aria-hidden="" tabindex="-1" href="#the-road-to-stable-and-beyond">The Road to Stable and Beyond</a></h2>
<p>With this release candidate we want to communicate our expectations and timeline for the stable release.</p>
<p>We have been asked countless times “<em>Wen Tauri 2.0?</em>” and always gave broad answers. Especially in open source projects overpromising can be a quick way to burn out developers and maintainers or lead to angry comments from disappointed adopters.</p>
<p>This is one of the reasons for the long alpha and beta stage and why we waited with the release candidate, as we strive to get things right and simple to use.</p>
<p>Another reason is that we made the mistake of overpromising this major version with “<em>mobile as a first class citizen</em>” and realized over the past months that we
can only build the foundation for mobile on our own and need to iterate on this together with the community and our adopters to get it right.</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean that mobile is broken and unsupported. We have mobile plugins in our official plugin repository and have seen developers who have built cool apps on Android and iOS with Tauri.</p>
<p>Our partner <a href="https://crabnebula.dev/">CrabNebula</a> also provided us with feedback on how easy (or complicated) the developer experience was when they built or supported mobile applications for customers. They even contributed multiple mobile plugins (<a href="https://github.com/tauri-apps/plugins-workspace/tree/v2/plugins/nfc">NFC</a>, <a href="https://github.com/tauri-apps/plugins-workspace/tree/v2/plugins/barcode-scanner">Barcode Scanner</a>, <a href="https://github.com/tauri-apps/plugins-workspace/tree/v2/plugins/biometric">Biometric</a>, <a href="https://github.com/tauri-apps/plugins-workspace/tree/feat/haptics/plugins/haptics">Haptics</a>, <a href="https://github.com/tauri-apps/plugins-workspace/tree/feat/geolocation/plugins/geolocation">Geolocation</a>) as part of their work.</p>
<p>We see improvements to be made in the development experience for mobile and we acknowledge that not all of our desktop features and plugins are ported or available on mobile yet.</p>
<p>This causes us to say that we don’t want to raise expectations that Tauri 2.0 will be <em>the</em> “<em>mobile as a first class citizen</em>” release but we want to make clear that you can develop production ready mobile applications with Tauri <strong>NOW</strong>.</p>
<p>What you can expect from stable after this release candidate is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clearer and comprehensive documentation</li>
<li>Less critical bugs preventing productive usage</li>
</ul>
<p>We plan to release the stable version for 2.0 in the end of August. This will, at the time of writing, allow for a ~4 week release candidate cycle.</p>
<p>After the stable release our focus will be shifting to providing feature parity wherever possible and to improve the development process for mobile. This will happen in minor releases of Tauri.</p>
<p>Feature parity and plugin development will be aligned with major versions of Tauri but will be mostly independent from Tauri core features and happen in our <a href="https://github.com/tauri-apps/plugins-workspace">plugin-workspace</a> repository.</p>
<p>Developer experience is a very important topic for us. If you have improvement suggestions or want to improve the status quo on your own please do not hesitate to reach out with PRs, issues or friendly conversations on our discord server.</p>
<h2 id="breaking-changes"><a aria-hidden="" tabindex="-1" href="#breaking-changes">Breaking Changes</a></h2>
<p>Before we enter the “<em>no more breaking changes</em>” expectation phase we discussed and planned some from our perspective necessary breaking changes a while ago.</p>
<p>These changes affect a lot of developers, so we wanted to bundle them and make it as painless as possible to upgrade from the latest beta to release candidate or stable.</p>
<p>For app developers we have breaking changes in how core plugins are referenced in the permissions.</p>
<p>You should be able to automatically migrate from the latest beta to release candidate. For this to succeed you must be sure to be on the latest (RC not beta) version of the Tauri <a href="https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/releases?q=tauri-cli&amp;expanded=false">CLI</a>.</p>

<p>Otherwise please read the detailed section <a href="#tauri-core-plugins">below</a> explaining the changes and how to manually migrate.</p>
<p>For downstream consumers of Tauri as a library or app developers fiddling with the internals of Tauri we have a bigger <a href="#rust-api-surface-refactor">refactor</a> you should check out.</p>
<h3 id="tauri-core-plugins"><a aria-hidden="" tabindex="-1" href="#tauri-core-plugins">Tauri Core Plugins</a></h3>
<p>With Tauri 2.0 we migrated most of the 1.x core functionality into separate plugins, which allows us to iterate on these independently of Tauri’s core and lowers the barrier for first contributors on functionality.</p>
<p>This migration also included keeping some functionality inside Tauri as pseudo plugins. Fully qualified plugins need to implement the <a href="https://docs.rs/tauri/2.0.0-rc/tauri/plugin/trait.Plugin.html"><code dir="auto">Plugin Trait</code></a> and need to be individual crates following the <code dir="auto">tauri-plugin-&lt;plugin name&gt;</code> naming scheme. For core plugins, the second condition was not possible as we would have circular dependencies on Tauri. So we created pseudo plugins, which are always initialized by Tauri itself and only implement the plugin trait. These are for example <code dir="auto">window</code>, <code dir="auto">path</code> or <code dir="auto">webview</code>. Right now these are allowed in the <a href="https://v2.tauri.app/security/capabilities/">capabilities</a> of your Tauri application in the following way:</p>
<div><figure><pre data-language="json"><code><div><p><span>...</span></p></div><div><p><span>"</span><span>permissions</span><span>"</span><span>: [</span></p></div><div><p><span>    </span><span>"</span><span>path:default</span><span>"</span><span>,</span></p></div><div><p><span>    </span><span>"</span><span>event:default</span><span>"</span><span>,</span></p></div><div><p><span>    </span><span>"</span><span>window:default</span><span>"</span><span>,</span></p></div><div><p><span>    </span><span>"</span><span>app:default</span><span>"</span><span>,</span></p></div><div><p><span>    </span><span>"</span><span>image:default</span><span>"</span><span>,</span></p></div><div><p><span>    </span><span>"</span><span>resources:default</span><span>"</span><span>,</span></p></div><div><p><span>    </span><span>"</span><span>menu:default</span><span>"</span><span>,</span></p></div><div><p><span>    </span><span>"</span><span>tray:default</span><span>"</span></p></div><div><p><span>]</span></p></div><div><p><span>...</span></p></div></code></pre></figure></div>
<p>This has multiple problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any plugin crate which has a colliding name will break our build process (e.g. <code dir="auto">tauri-plugin-window</code> crate) and our cli for adding plugins (e.g. <code dir="auto">cargo tauri add window</code>)</li>
<li>We can’t use any core pseudo plugin naming that is already used by existing plugins (e.g. if we would ever want to create<code dir="auto">tauri-plugin-mobile-core</code> and it is already used we will encounter the first problem)</li>
<li>It is unclear for developers what is a core plugin and what is a dedicated plugin when looking at capabilities</li>
</ul>
<p>Our approach is to use a fixed namespace for core plugins, which is documented and enforced by the Tauri core. All plugins starting with <code dir="auto">core:</code> or the plugin name <code dir="auto">core</code> are now considered core pseudo plugins and will only be initialized if they are in the Tauri codebase.</p>
<p>This will cause a breaking change to all capabilites enabling Tauri core features. The above example will be changed to look like this:</p>
<div><figure><pre data-language="json"><code><div><p><span>...</span></p></div><div><p><span>"</span><span>permissions</span><span>"</span><span>: [</span></p></div><div><p><span>    </span><span>"</span><span>core:path:default</span><span>"</span><span>,</span></p></div><div><p><span>    </span><span>"</span><span>core:event:default</span><span>"</span><span>,</span></p></div><div><p><span>    </span><span>"</span><span>core:window:default</span><span>"</span><span>,</span></p></div><div><p><span>    </span><span>"</span><span>core:app:default</span><span>"</span><span>,</span></p></div><div><p><span>    </span><span>"</span><span>core:image:default</span><span>"</span><span>,</span></p></div><div><p><span>    </span><span>"</span><span>core:resources:default</span><span>"</span><span>,</span></p></div><div><p><span>    </span><span>"</span><span>core:menu:default</span><span>"</span><span>,</span></p></div><div><p><span>    </span><span>"</span><span>core:tray:default</span><span>"</span></p></div><div><p><span>]</span></p></div><div><p><span>...</span></p></div></code></pre></figure></div>
<p>We also added a new special <code dir="auto">core:default</code> permission set which will contain all default permissions of all core plugins, so you can simplify the permissions boilerplate in your capabilities config.</p>
<div><figure><pre data-language="json"><code><div><p><span>...</span></p></div><div><p><span>"</span><span>permissions</span><span>"</span><span>: [</span></p></div><div><p><span>    </span><span>"</span><span>core:default</span><span>"</span></p></div><div><p><span>]</span></p></div><div><p><span>...</span></p></div></code></pre></figure></div>
<p>We consider the core default exposure to be reasonably secure and safe to enable by default, with limited impact in case of a compromised frontend.</p>
<p>To migrate from the latest beta version you need to prepend all core permission identifiers in your capabilities with <code dir="auto">core:</code> or switch to the <code dir="auto">core:default</code> permission and remove old core plugin identifiers.</p>
<h3 id="development-server-for-mobile"><a aria-hidden="" tabindex="-1" href="#development-server-for-mobile">Development Server for Mobile</a></h3>
<p>We introduced changes to the network exposure of the built-in development server <a href="https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/pull/10437">PR #10437</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/pull/10456">PR #10456</a>.
With the changes shipped in the 2.0.0-rc.0 release of the Tauri CLI, we can connect to your development server running on localhost when targetting
Android and iOS (previously this was only possible when developing a desktop application).</p>
<p>This means you no longer need to expose your development server on the public network.</p>


<h3 id="rust-api-surface-refactor"><a aria-hidden="" tabindex="-1" href="#rust-api-surface-refactor">Rust API Surface Refactor</a></h3>
<p>With a coordinated effort between multiple working group members we partially changed our Rust API exposure. This affects only consumers of our Rust API and should have no breaking change impact for Tauri application developers.</p>
<p>This was motivated by a recent security advisory <a href="https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/security/advisories/GHSA-57fm-592m-34r7">CVE-2024-35222</a>, as the fix needed to introduce additional fields to a structure that was directly publicly exposed and caused breaking changes to some projects and internal usage.</p>
<p>We concluded that this overexposure will hinder us in the future and will cause unnecessary breaking changes, so we decided that going from beta to RC will be the last chance for us to implement this until we start down the road of Tauri 3.0.</p>
<p>We reduced the amount of publicly exposed components, which are meant for internal use. Additionally, we made our publicly exposed structures either non-exhaustive or transformed them into exposing builder patterns or constructors. In some cases we added a new <code dir="auto">extend</code> field to allow dynamic additions in the future. Finally, we made sure to document which modules of Tauri are considered unstable.</p>
<p>This will help us to provide (security) fixes or changes without breaking interfaces that are considered stable.</p>
<p>Please take a closer look at the introduced and discussed changes in the <a href="https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/pull/10158">#10158</a> pull request.</p>
<h2 id="external-security-audit"><a aria-hidden="" tabindex="-1" href="#external-security-audit">External Security Audit</a></h2>

<p>We have been quiet on this front for some time as we have been busy fixing and discussing issues discovered during the beta versions.</p>
<p>We never marketed version 2 beta releases as production ready but were aware of some apps deployed into production. This caused us to announce and distribute a security patch for one of the findings (<a href="https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/security/advisories/GHSA-57fm-592m-34r7">CVE-2024-35222</a>) which was also independently discovered by a Tauri community member.</p>
<p>All other findings were fixed in multiple beta versions but we did not create advisories for these. We concluded a full heads up could wait until the release candidate, as the findings mainly affect the development phase or have no critical severity.</p>
<p>With the release candidate we will add the full report to our repository. Please take your time to read the report and learn more about the awesome work of <a href="https://github.com/gronke">@gronke</a> and <a href="https://github.com/pcwizz">@pcwizz</a> from <a href="https://www.radicallyopensecurity.com/">RadicallyOpenSecurity</a>.</p>
<p>The whole audit was funded by the great folks at <a href="https://nlnet.nl/">NLNet</a> and we are super grateful to be in the privileged position to get fully funded external security audits.</p>
<h2 id="call-to-action"><a aria-hidden="" tabindex="-1" href="#call-to-action">Call to Action</a></h2>
<p>All of the above topics share a common theme. These would not have been possible without the continuous support of the community, our working group and other movements working towards improving the status quo.</p>
<p>Before we are going to release Tauri 2.0 we want to make sure that your voices are heard, your PRs are acknowledged and the documentation is helpful for <strong>YOU</strong> so that you can build the next generation of cross platform apps.</p>
<p>Currently we have over 30 people in our working group on Github but even more involved in our <a href="https://discord.gg/tauri">Discord</a>. These awesome people are mostly working on Tauri in their free time with very few exceptions. We currently see a number of issues, PRs and discussions being unsolved and open for longer than we would like to.</p>
<p>To improve this situation we ask <strong>YOU</strong> to get involved into the Tauri project.We have all kinds of situations where we are able to accept event the tiniest contribution.</p>
<p>If you are familiar with Tauri and have used it already during your journey, please take your time to check out the <a href="https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/discussions">Github Discussions</a>, <a href="https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues">Github Issues</a> and our <a href="">Discord Support</a>. Maybe you have already solved the issues your fellow newcomers to Tauri are experiencing right now.</p>
<p>If you think that some of these problems you have seen are generic and should be documented somewhere we probably have the perfect place for it in our official <a href="https://v2.tauri.app/">documentation</a>.</p>
<p>To contribute improvements or additions we are open for PRs in the <a href="https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri-docs">tauri-docs</a> repository. Please make sure you’ve read the <a href="https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri-docs/blob/v2/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md">guidelines</a> for contribution though.</p>
<p>If you are in the position to understand and translate the current documentation into your native language we appreciate <a href="https://v2.tauri.app/contribute/translate-status">content translations</a> to our documentation.</p>
<p>If you have followed our project for a while but never made a contribution we would be happy to understand what has prevented you from doing so and how we could improve this.

  <p><strong>Meta’s Canadian news ban: one year in, there’s a dramatic decline in news reach and social media presence with minimal public awareness</strong></p><p>On August 1, 2023, in response to Bill C-18, Meta blocked Canadians from viewing, accessing, and sharing news article links on its platforms. Over the past 12 months, our team of researchers has closely monitored the effects of the ban particularly on Canadian news organizations and how Canadians engage with news and political content online.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://ranunculus-grey-r4hj.squarespace.com/s/Meta-News-Ban-Report2.pdf" target="_blank">“<em>Old News, New Reality: A Year of Meta's News Ban in Canada</em>”</a> is the first data-informed analysis on what happened in Canada after Meta banned access to news on its platforms for Canadians. Our researchers found that the decision to block Canadian users from seeing news on two of our most prevalent social media platforms shifted the flow of information online and the relationship between the news, social media, and Canadians.&nbsp;</p><p>“Nearly half of the reach of Canadian news on social media disappeared overnight after the ban and 200 news outlets went completely dark on socials,” said Aengus Bridgman, Director of the Media Ecosystem Observatory, “and equally concerning is that Canadians barely noticed.”</p><p><strong>Key Results of the Meta News Ban:&nbsp;</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Almost half of news media engagement has disappeared -</strong> Canadian news outlets have lost 85% of their engagement on Facebook and Instagram. This loss has not been compensated by increases on other social media platforms, resulting in an overall decrease of 43% in engagement.</p></li></ul><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Almost one third of local news outlets are now inactive </strong>- The ban has reshaped the media landscape in Canada, with 212 or approximately 30% of local news outlets in Canada previously active on social media now inactive.</p></li><li><p><strong>Three quarters of the Canadian public are unaware of the ban </strong>- Only 22% of Canadians know that news is banned on Facebook and Instagram. Even among users of the platforms and those who say they get news from the platform, a majority do not know about the ban.</p></li><li><p><strong>News is still being shared on Facebook and Instagram </strong>-<strong> </strong>Despite the ban, news organization content is still available on Meta platforms through work-around strategies like screengrabs, with 36% of Canadian users reporting encountering news or links to news on Facebook or Instagram. This arguably should make Meta subject to the requirements of the Online News Act.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Less news is being consumed by Canadians</strong> - Overall, Canadians are simply seeing less news online - an estimated reduction of 11 million views per day across Instagram and Facebook - due to the ban. Canadians continue to learn about politics and current events through Facebook and Instagram, but through a more biased and less factual lens than before and many Canadians do not even realize the shift has occurred. They do not appear to be seeking news elsewhere.</p></li></ul><p>This Brief is produced as part of a series by the Media Ecosystem Observatory intended to benchmark the health of the Canadian Information ecosystem, political discourses, and the attitudes and behaviors of Canadians.</p><p><strong>For media inquiries, please contact:</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Isabelle Corriveau</p><p><a href="mailto:isabelle.corriveau2@mcgill.ca"><span>isabelle.corriveau2@mcgill.ca</span></a></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p id="speakable-summary">In a big move, Character.AI co-founder and CEO Noam Shazeer is returning to Google after leaving the company in October 2021 to found the a16z-backed chatbot startup. In his previous stint, Shazeer spearheaded the team of researchers that built&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/lamda/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LaMDA</a>&nbsp;(Language Model for Dialogue Applications), a language model that&nbsp;was used for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/googles-lamda-makes-conversations-with-ais-more-conversational/">conversational AI tools</a>.</p>

<p>Character.AI co-founder Daniel De Freitas is also joining Google with some other employees from the startup. Dominic Perella, Character.AI’s general counsel, is becoming an interim CEO at the startup. The company noted that most of the staff is staying at Character.AI.</p>

	
	


<p>Google is also signing a non-exclusive agreement with Character.AI to use its tech.</p>

<p>“I am super excited to return to Google and work as part of the Google DeepMind team. I am so proud of everything we built at&nbsp;Character.AI&nbsp;over the last 3 years. I am confident that the funds from the non-exclusive Google licensing agreement, together with the incredible Character.AI&nbsp;team, positions&nbsp;Character.AI&nbsp;for continued success in the future,” Shazeer said in a statement given to TechCrunch.</p>

<p>Google said that Shazeer is joining the DeepMind research team but didn’t specify his or De Freitas’s exact roles.</p>

<p>“We’re particularly thrilled to welcome back Noam, a preeminent researcher in machine learning,&nbsp;who is joining Google DeepMind’s research team, along with a small number of his colleagues,” Google said in a statement. “This agreement will provide increased funding for Character.AI to continue growing and to focus on building personalized AI products for users around the world,” a Google spokesperson said.</p>

<p>Character.AI has raised over $150 million in funding, largely from a16z.</p>


	
	


<p>“When Noam and Daniel started&nbsp;<a href="http://character.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Character.AI</a>, our goal of personalized superintelligence required a full stack approach. We had to pre-train models, post-train them to power the experiences that make&nbsp;<a href="http://character.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Character.AI</a>&nbsp;special, and build a product platform with the ability to reach users globally,” Character AI mentioned in its <a href="https://blog.character.ai/our-next-phase-of-growth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog</a> announcing the move.</p>

	
	


<p>“Over the past two years, however, the landscape has shifted; many more pre-trained models are now available. Given these changes, we see an advantage in making greater use of third-party LLMs alongside our own. This allows us to devote even more resources to post-training and creating new product experiences for our growing user base.”</p>

<p>There is a possibility that different regulatory bodies, such as the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), and the Department of Justice (DoJ) in the U.S. and the EU will scrutinize these reverse acqui-hires closely. Last month. the U.K’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/66964b6fce1fd0da7b59260c/Commencement_notice.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">issued a notice</a> saying that it is looking into Microsoft hiring key people from Inflection AI to understand if the tech giant is trying to avoid regulatory oversight. The FTC opened <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/ftc-opens-antitrust-probe-of-microsoft-ai-deal-29b5169a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a similar investigation in June</a> to look into Microsoft’s $650 million deal.</p>

<p>This is the result of <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/migrate/mv2-deprecation-timeline" rel="nofollow">Manifest v2 support</a> being deprecated in favor of <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/migrate/what-is-mv3" rel="nofollow">Manifest v3</a>.</p>
<p>uBO is a Manifest v2 extension, hence the warning in your Google Chrome browser. There is no Manifest v3 version of uBO, hence the browser will suggest alternative extensions as a replacement for uBO:</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uBOL-home">uBO Lite (uBOL)</a> is a pared-down version of uBO with a best effort at converting filter lists used by uBO into a Manifest v3-compliant approach, with a focus on reliability and efficiency as has been the case with uBO since first published in June 2014.</p>
<p>However the focus on reliability and efficiency in a Manifest v3 environment meant having to sacrifice many features beyond those not possible within a Manifest v3 framework.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uBOL-home/wiki/Frequently-asked-questions-(FAQ)">official uBOL FAQ webpage</a> for more details about how uBOL compares to uBO.</p>
<p>Manifest v2 uBO will not be automatically replaced by Manifest v3 uBOL. uBOL is too different from uBO for it to silently replace uBO -- you will have to explicitly make a choice as to which extension should replace uBO according to your own prerogatives.</p>
<p>Ultimately whether uBOL is an acceptable alternative to uBO is up to you, it's not a choice that will be made for you.</p>
<p><h3>Will development of uBO continue?</h3><a id="user-content-will-development-of-ubo-continue" aria-label="Permalink: Will development of uBO continue?" href="#will-development-of-ubo-continue"></a></p>
<p>Yes, there are other browsers which are not deprecating Manifest v2.</p>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Usage</h2><a id="user-content-usage" aria-label="Permalink: Usage" href="#usage"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Check out our <a href="https://rustpython.github.io/demo/" rel="nofollow">online demo</a> running on WebAssembly.</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">RustPython requires Rust latest stable version (e.g 1.67.1 at February 7th 2023). If you don't
currently have Rust installed on your system you can do so by following the instructions at <a href="https://rustup.rs/" rel="nofollow">rustup.rs</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">To check the version of Rust you're currently running, use <code>rustc --version</code>. If you wish to update,
<code>rustup update stable</code> will update your Rust installation to the most recent stable release.</p>
<p dir="auto">To build RustPython locally, first, clone the source code:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="git clone https://github.com/RustPython/RustPython"><pre>git clone https://github.com/RustPython/RustPython</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Then you can change into the RustPython directory and run the demo (Note: <code>--release</code> is
needed to prevent stack overflow on Windows):</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ cd RustPython
$ cargo run --release demo_closures.py
Hello, RustPython!"><pre>$ <span>cd</span> RustPython
$ cargo run --release demo_closures.py
Hello, RustPython<span>!</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Or use the interactive shell:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ cargo run --release
Welcome to rustpython
>>>>> 2+2
4"><pre>$ cargo run --release
Welcome to rustpython
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2+2
4</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">NOTE: For windows users, please set <code>RUSTPYTHONPATH</code> environment variable as <code>Lib</code> path in project directory.
(e.g. When RustPython directory is <code>C:\RustPython</code>, set <code>RUSTPYTHONPATH</code> as <code>C:\RustPython\Lib</code>)</p>
<p dir="auto">You can also install and run RustPython with the following:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ cargo install --git https://github.com/RustPython/RustPython
$ rustpython
Welcome to the magnificent Rust Python interpreter
>>>>>"><pre>$ cargo install --git https://github.com/RustPython/RustPython
$ rustpython
Welcome to the magnificent Rust Python interpreter
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">If you'd like to make https requests, you can enable the <code>ssl</code> feature, which
also lets you install the <code>pip</code> package manager. Note that on Windows, you may
need to install OpenSSL, or you can enable the <code>ssl-vendor</code> feature instead,
which compiles OpenSSL for you but requires a C compiler, perl, and <code>make</code>.
OpenSSL version 3 is expected and tested in CI. Older versions may not work.</p>
<p dir="auto">Once you've installed rustpython with SSL support, you can install pip by
running:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="cargo install --git https://github.com/RustPython/RustPython --features ssl
rustpython --install-pip"><pre>cargo install --git https://github.com/RustPython/RustPython --features ssl
rustpython --install-pip</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">You can also install RustPython through the <code>conda</code> package manager, though
this isn't officially supported and may be out of date:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="conda install rustpython -c conda-forge

<p dir="auto">You can read the <a href="https://docs.rs/rustpython" rel="nofollow">online documentation</a> for the
latest release, or the <a href="https://rustpython.github.io/docs/" rel="nofollow">user guide</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">You can also generate documentation locally by running:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="cargo doc # Including documentation for all dependencies
cargo doc --no-deps --all # Excluding all dependencies"><pre>cargo doc <span><span>#</span> Including documentation for all dependencies</span>
cargo doc --no-deps --all <span><span>#</span> Excluding all dependencies</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Documentation HTML files can then be found in the <code>target/doc</code> directory or you can append <code>--open</code> to the previous commands to
have the documentation open automatically on your default browser.</p>

<p dir="auto">Contributions are more than welcome, and in many cases we are happy to guide
contributors through PRs or on Discord. Please refer to the
<a href="https://github.com/RustPython/RustPython/blob/main/DEVELOPMENT.md">development guide</a> as well for tips on developments.</p>
<p dir="auto">With that in mind, please note this project is maintained by volunteers, some of
the best ways to get started are below:</p>
<p dir="auto">Most tasks are listed in the
<a href="https://github.com/RustPython/RustPython/issues">issue tracker</a>. Check issues
labeled with <a href="https://github.com/RustPython/RustPython/issues?q=label%3A%22good+first+issue%22+is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+">good first issue</a> if you wish to start coding.</p>
<p dir="auto">To enhance CPython compatibility, try to increase unittest coverage by checking this article: <a href="https://rustpython.github.io/guideline/2020/04/04/how-to-contribute-by-cpython-unittest.html" rel="nofollow">How to contribute to RustPython by CPython unittest</a></p>
<p dir="auto">Another approach is to checkout the source code: builtin functions and object
methods are often the simplest and easiest way to contribute.</p>
<p dir="auto">You can also simply run <code>./whats_left.py</code> to assist in finding any unimplemented

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto"><p><strong>Intro from Zach Rausch and Jon Haidt:</strong></p><p><span>Today, we publish our third post on what we now call the “first act” of </span><em>The Anxious Generation</em><span>: the loss of community. (The second act is the loss of the play-based childhood. The third act is the rise of the phone-based childhood.) In our </span><a href="https://www.afterbabel.com/p/community-based-childhood" rel="">first post,</a><span> Zach discussed Robert Putnam’s essential work on the decline of social capital and trust, which happened in part because new individualizing technologies (such as television) emerged and participation in local and communal activities waned. As communities weakened and trust eroded, so did the play-based childhood.</span></p><p><span>In the </span><a href="https://www.afterbabel.com/p/neighborhoods-that-nurture-why-thehttps://www.afterbabel.com/p/neighborhoods-that-nurture-why-thehttps://www.afterbabel.com/p/neighborhoods-that-nurture-why-the" rel="">second post</a><span>, we featured an essay by </span><a href="https://sethkaplan.org/" rel="">Seth Kaplan</a><span>, author and lecturer at Johns Hopkins who studies fragile states. In it, he argued that to restore the play-based childhood, we must first rebuild strong in-person local communities. In this post, Seth takes his argument one step further, asserting that the upstream cause of the youth mental health crisis is the loss of community. As we are offered new virtual ways to connect with one another, Seth contends that we are only growing further apart.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>We note that the first generation to move its social life onto social media platforms immediately became the </span><a href="https://www.afterbabel.com/p/arent-you-lonely" rel="">loneliest generation</a><span> on record. There is a spectrum of approaches that we as a society can take to address the crushing loneliness of Gen Z and Gen Alpha. On one end is doubling down on technology, typified by the recent introduction of the </span><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/friend-ai-pendant/" rel="">creepy AI “friend” orb</a><span>, which young people can wear around their necks so that they always have a “friend” to talk with. On the other end is to focus on strengthening the real-world human communities and neighborhoods we live in. Seth advocates for the latter and provides us with a roadmap to get there.</span></p><p><strong>— Zach and Jon</strong></p><p><span>Jonathan Haidt and Zach Rausch </span><a href="https://www.afterbabel.com/p/community-based-childhood" rel="">argue</a><span> that the loss of community is one of three factors behind the deterioration in youth mental health, along with the decline of play and the emergence of phone-mediated childhood. But in this article, I argue that it’s actually the </span><em>dominant factor</em><span> since it is upstream from the other two.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The rapid spread of smartphones in the early 2010s triggered the dramatic uptick in mental distress among youth, but this happened especially in places where the social system supporting them was already hollowed out. As </span><a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/06/06/opinion/religious-teens-mental-health/" rel="">Rausch writes</a><span>, kids who live in well-rooted “real-world communities … spending more time engaging in their local community –</span><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1moM3e_dcajEJzDR_uBK1mIs3hZ8vFZJ4MfUx7NZIx3I/edit#gid=809472783&amp;range=B35" rel=""> attending religious services, working, spending more time with trusted adults</a><span>, and spending more</span><a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-generations-jean-m-twenge/18698850?ean=9781982181611" rel=""> time</a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/19/podcasts/transcript-ezra-klein-interviews-jean-twenge.html" rel=""> with their friends</a><span> in person” — are less likely to experience the harms of the phone-based childhood. Where community is strong, the impact has been softened.</span></p><p>In this post, I argue that kids need real-world community to thrive and that the weakening (and even breakdown) of neighborhood communities across many countries explains many of the problems facing youth today—from screen addiction and the decline in mental health to rising drug addiction and growing loneliness.</p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.afterbabel.com/p/the-upstream-cause-of-the-youth-mental?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://www.afterbabel.com/p/the-upstream-cause-of-the-youth-mental?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p><p>The term “community” is often used, but its meaning is rarely articulated. It is sometimes conflated with a “sense of community,” which can be produced by working with a dedicated group of volunteers or in a close-knit organization. But, an actual community is more permanent and is much harder to create. A prototypical community consists of most or all of the following:</p><ul><li><p><span>A web of overlapping, affect-laden </span><strong>associations and relationships</strong><span> that crisscross and reinforce each other;</span></p></li><li><p><span>A set of </span><strong>shared values, norms, and goals</strong><span>—a common culture that unifies and constrains;</span></p></li><li><p><span>A </span><strong>common identity</strong><span>, ideally based on a common history and narrative and recognition of mutual interdependence;</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Shared rituals</strong><span> that celebrate the group, its past, and future;</span></p></li><li><p><span>High levels of </span><strong>trust</strong><span>;</span></p></li><li><p><span>High levels of </span><strong>commitment</strong><span>, with limited options for (or high costs to) exit;</span></p></li><li><p><span>Recognition of and respect for common </span><strong>authority</strong><span> figures who guide the group’s decision-making;</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Keystone actors and institutions</strong><span> that bridge and bond different members together;</span></p></li><li><p><span>A </span><strong>diverse range of skills and personalities</strong><span> that can contribute complementary things of value (e.g., money, time, expertise) to the group;</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Role models</strong><span> who exhibit the cultural behaviors that the group should ideally replicate or at least aspire to;</span></p></li><li><p><span>Exhibiting a high degree of </span><strong>inclusiveness</strong><span> by actively seeking to encompass every member who shares the same identity or location;</span></p></li><li><p><span>Capacity to strongly encourage through moral suasion certain </span><strong>norms</strong><span> of conduct and, if necessary, sanction misconduct.</span></p></li></ul><p>As we can see from this list, a community requires a commitment to a certain social order—and usually to a place—that, by definition, must constrain some choices. In return for security, support, and belonging, members surrender some of their freedom. This explains why creating community in America today is so difficult—few want to compromise their ability to make choices. This is especially true among those with the resources and/or capacity to relocate as soon as a better opportunity beckons—the very people whose leadership and role-modeling communities can ill afford to lose.</p><p>Much of a child’s learning and formation is absorbed from the environment rather than directly taught by adults; behavior is better shaped by modeling than by lecturing. The institutions (e.g., schools, churches, and parents’ groups) and norms (e.g., regular family dinners, neighborhood play dates, and the expectation that adults will monitor streets) around us shape our kids' lives in ways we sometimes fail to consider because they are subtle. These institutions and norms determine the strength of families, interfamily networks, neighborhood relationships, and communal support systems. They shape each kid’s attitudes toward relationships, technology, and life goals. For example, when adults and older kids in my neighborhood model kindness, generosity, and responsibility to one another, my kids learn that these are the norms we should all aspire to in a way that no textbook or teacher (or parent) can instruct. When my religious neighborhood turns off technology for one day a week—on Shabbat—we are showing our kids that embodied relationships and interaction are more important than our phones and virtual networks. These institutions and the norms thus have an enormous influence on the choices parents and kids make every day, and on how vulnerable the latter are to various challenges like smartphones, drug use, and gang involvement.</p><p><span>As I documented in a</span><a href="https://www.afterbabel.com/p/neighborhoods-that-nurture-why-the" rel=""> previous essay at After Babel</a><span>, unsupervised, child-directed play was in decline long before kids had smartphones. Why? Because place-based institutions and the communities they support were in decline. Instead of spending time with peers in the neighborhood (the norm for millennia because we all lived in place-based communities), </span><a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Generations/Jean-M-Twenge/9781982181611" rel="">kids</a><span> were already spending much of their time outside of school </span><a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-free-time-became-screen-time/" rel="">at home</a><span> with </span><a href="https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/ppm-ppm0000203.pdf" rel="">televisions</a><span>, computers, or video games. More affluent children had many of their activities organized for them by their parents, putting them in a variety of highly structured functional groups with different kids rather than repeatedly playing freely with their neighbors. This oversupervision or “coddling”—the subject of the</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Coddling-American-Mind-Intentions-Generation/dp/0735224919/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.yyb49J53TZs_9w5jNGcgLCRAqGuBAc-b28AzzCCPcsdxUKlU_TTJtUu4ssi1UOK-WbEB2boDybMiuYFlsaHtpf5fZhrhsQjKSbr3NdpP-QJHw85Obxf-EpRKFsbvY1C13wwU1CWYisHPXsVTT6eCefQrwype6OZ3wttmy5GEKw5s9gR6jCboJyrP_msts2KJo9sOHHqSx1AVF_962RtI8wUPc1H3AR0mw_slivFqgoGkdUpSnDp_5sb68zWnZ2ECULJV5wZDAJ2cqz4oFkxS1m87_InfwIfk7lyZEZQcw2U.XhGIGJzOKGa_whWg772-29bt_1jJpTMutfhGOVxbwOI&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;hvadid=598729490318&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvlocphy=9007807&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvqmt=e&amp;hvrand=11718848189838980715&amp;hvtargid=kwd-280547986705&amp;hydadcr=22569_13531285&amp;keywords=coddling+of+the+american+mind&amp;qid=1717532774&amp;sr=8-1" rel=""> 2018 book</a><span> co-authored by Greg Lukianoff and Jon—made the attractions of smartphones and social media even more appealing.

We can video chat with hundreds of people simultaneously from far-flung locations. We can pursue learning largely untethered from any physical space. Based on all of this, it would be easy to assume that place doesn’t matter.</span></p><p>I disagree. Physical place actually matters far more than we realize, especially as our lives become ever more placeless.</p><p><span>As Jon writes in </span><em>The Anxious Generation</em><span>, only real-world (place-based) social relationships and interactions have the four features that have characterized human interactions for millions of years. Such interactions are embodied, they are&nbsp; synchronous, they involve one-to-one or one-to-several communications, and they have a high bar for entry and exit. In contrast, virtual interactions are typically disembodied and asynchronous, involve one-to-many communications, and have a low bar for entry and exit. The challenge today is that smartphones and other digital devices bring so many interesting experiences to children and adolescents that they cause a serious problem: </span><em>They reduce interest in all non-screen-based forms of experience</em><span>. Virtual networks are not only insufficient replacements for communities, but their proliferation makes the establishment of communities more difficult.</span></p><p>Community—and the relational security blanket it provides—is essential to the health and well-being of our children. Yet, over the last two generations, the U.S. has moved from a “townshipped” society in which neighbors regularly communicated and collaborated with each other through a host of place-based institutions to a “networked” and technologically-driven one in which local neighborhoods, schools, churches, and civic organizations are less important, and therefore they have weakened over time.&nbsp;</p><p><span>“The Quest for Community,”</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Quest-Community-Background-Essential-Conservative/dp/1935191500" rel=""> in the words of Robert Nisbet</a><span>, continues unabated, but today, the term “community” is often used in ways that are aspirational and limitless (e.g., </span><a href="https://creators.facebook.com/tools/groups/?locale=en_US" rel="">many</a><span> </span><a href="https://bubble.io/community" rel="">online</a><span> </span><a href="https://training.thinkific.com/courses/thriving-communities" rel="">advertisements</a><span> </span><a href="https://www.disco.co/academy" rel="">for</a><span> </span><a href="https://community.sephora.com/" rel="">new</a><span> social networks)—quite different from the original meaning of the term. Indeed, it’s a good example of “term inflation” — the stretching of a good idea to promote values and goals quite different from what is meant.</span></p><p>Why? Perhaps fewer individuals have any experience of what community really means. Young people are marketed to and formed by the twin pursuits of convenience and choice while simultaneously being told that a person’s chief purpose is to express themselves (usually through consumption). This vision of the good life is part of the next generation’s socialization. It feels “natural” to them, and yet it does little to prepare them for the demands and delights of membership in a community.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Community differs significantly from friendships, social networks, or what is experienced online. Whereas communities offer mutual support in times of good and bad and are bolstered by robust institutions and norms encouraging frequent, positive interactions, care and concern for one another, and ample opportunities to work together towards common goals, the alternatives typically fall short on these elements.&nbsp;</p><p><span>While one-to-one relationships, a string of individual 1:1 relationships, or participation in an online group can provide some benefits—including a </span><em>feeling</em><span> of connection—they fall far short of actually producing community, which requires overlapping institutions and activities, things that are very hard to achieve if you don’t share a physical place with one another.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Virtual groups are transitory and thin rather than permanent and thick. They cannot provide the dense web of supportive social ties that act like a security blanket when in need or the breadth of informal supportive daily interactions that are the lifeblood of a true community. Most online networks, for example, are instrumental, serving to connect people with a common history or interest or need together, as with </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/1629740080681586" rel="">Facebook</a><span> or </span><a href="https://discord.com/creators/community-server-features-every-creator-should-know-about" rel="">Discord</a><span> Groups. They offer a stream of messages and connections, useful information, entertainment, and sometimes notes of support — from known and unknown people.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Some of these sell themselves as online communities — </span><a href="https://networkconference.netstudies.org/2018OUA/2018/04/23/community-hashtags-generate-a-sense-of-belonging/" rel="">think of</a><span> </span><a href="https://www.sanctuarymg.com/academy/social-media/hashtags-build-social-community/" rel="">the</a><span> </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/finding-your-community-hashtags-reboostlive/" rel="">concept</a><span> </span><a href="https://www.sarahbeststrategy.com/blog/using-hashtags-to-increase-social-media-engagement#:~:text=Community%20hashtags%20are%20hashtags%20that,build%20community%2C%20and%20gain%20followers." rel="">of</a><span> “finding or creating community” through hashtags — where users find photos and videos of other people who share like-minded views (and then they like, comment, and share those photos and videos). But these fall far short of the meaning of community. On the net, online groups are more transactional, engendering little sense of mutual responsibility, and not necessarily useful when you need help nor protective when you are vulnerable. The norms of mutual support are significantly weakened and there is little of the sense of common destiny that a place-based community produces. Who would you rather call when in trouble - a real person you see regularly down the block from you or someone online who you have never met in person?&nbsp;</span></p><p>It’s worth noting that online communities are also voluntary, with many being platforms built for expression or personal advancement. Few provide the diversity of personalities, experiences, income levels, and outlooks that were common in most neighborhoods a few decades ago. Few provide the incentives to earn recognition through the force of character rather than a performative act about oneself. Few provide multifaceted psychological and practical support when needed for members who feel vulnerable or fall into practical difficulties.&nbsp;</p><p><span>None of this is to say that online networks and relationships don’t have significant value. In some cases, the virtual world can enhance pre-existing real-world relationships and groups. In others, it can connect people who would never meet otherwise. My point, however, is that we need to recognize that they are not sufficient </span><em>replacements</em><span> for what real-world in-person relationships and communities offer and that we should have a clear view of the limitations, which are significant.</span></p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.afterbabel.com/p/the-upstream-cause-of-the-youth-mental/comments&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Leave a comment&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://www.afterbabel.com/p/the-upstream-cause-of-the-youth-mental/comments" rel=""><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p><p>I moved to my current neighborhood, Kemp Mill, just north of Washington, D.C., 12 years ago to raise a family and (mostly) put an end to my nomadic wanderings. It offered something that few neighborhoods could—a real community with high levels of hospitality and social trust. It is as institutionally thick as any place I have been in America, with these institutions nurturing the deep social ties and tight web of associations that bind us together and enhance our lives in countless invisible ways. The benefits of such ties are apparent every time we face a difficulty—whether it involves safety, technology, or a pandemic.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5f593ba2-1ee3-42e3-8117-2caddb18f1cf_1074x624.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5f593ba2-1ee3-42e3-8117-2caddb18f1cf_1074x624.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5f593ba2-1ee3-42e3-8117-2caddb18f1cf_1074x624.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5f593ba2-1ee3-42e3-8117-2caddb18f1cf_1074x624.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5f593ba2-1ee3-42e3-8117-2caddb18f1cf_1074x624.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5f593ba2-1ee3-42e3-8117-2caddb18f1cf_1074x624.png" width="1074" height="624" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5f593ba2-1ee3-42e3-8117-2caddb18f1cf_1074x624.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:624,&quot;width&quot;:1074,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1321653,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5f593ba2-1ee3-42e3-8117-2caddb18f1cf_1074x624.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5f593ba2-1ee3-42e3-8117-2caddb18f1cf_1074x624.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5f593ba2-1ee3-42e3-8117-2caddb18f1cf_1074x624.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5f593ba2-1ee3-42e3-8117-2caddb18f1cf_1074x624.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption><em><strong>Images. </strong><span>The</span><strong> </strong><span>Kemp Mill neighborhood. Bake sales, kids playing, and presents from neighbors.</span></em></figcaption></figure></div><p>When COVID-19 struck Kemp Mill, we found that our in-person networks had prepared us to weather such a challenge. A large number of volunteers appeared, ready to distribute food, masks, and medicine to the homebound and set up outdoor pods for kids to play. While many schools around the country went virtual for extended periods of time, ours made every effort to reopen within months by leveraging the medical talent in the neighborhood to develop nuanced procedures to safeguard everyone. Streams of volunteers supplemented what school staff could manage. Meanwhile, synagogues organized new virtual activities for kids and shifted their many programs for adults online. Neighbors hosted social gatherings in their front yards and encouraged kids to spend time together in the back yards. In sum, neighborliness and helpfulness were the default behavior. While I often hear about the negative aftereffects of COVID when meeting educators and parents elsewhere, I do not hear the same complaints from the families in our school.</p><p>I am thus not worried about social media’s impact on my kids. As a strong kids-centered community, we do not need the government’s help to restrict kids’ use of social media. Our school and the parents of our children’s classmates already carefully monitor what information children consume. Youth get their phones at a later age than elsewhere in America, and our schools do not allow them anywhere near a classroom. Moreover, most receive older-style cell phones that cannot access social media. My kids are active readers, borrowing books from the local library and subscribing to compelling magazines and book subscriptions. And they regularly spend joyful time with their classmates and neighboring kids, going hours and hours together talking, playing board games and cards, singing, competing in sports, or just walking around—with no phones in sight. In observing our faith, our whole community also regularly spends time (on the Sabbath and major holidays) with no access to any media at all. Parents model that they too know how to set their phones aside and attend to real community, in space and time.</p><p><strong>If you are a parent and want to join or build a community to enmesh your kids in, what can you do? Here are a few ideas to get started.</strong></p><p><span>First, you can select a place to live based on its </span><em>social</em><span> wealth. When my wife and I were ready to have kids, we were determined to find a supportive community to live in. We spent a year checking out half a dozen options between New York City (where we lived) and Washington, D.C. (where I was doing more work). In most cases, we visited, stayed overnight, met lots of people, and asked lots of questions. In the end, we chose the D.C. suburb where I live now—a warm, welcoming, and institutionally rich place.</span></p><p><span>Second, consider how you can befriend neighbors and other parents in your immediate vicinity. Try the </span><a href="https://neighboringmovement.org/" rel="">8 Front Door Challenge</a><span>, which helps you plan and host a Get-Together with neighbors closest to you. Participate in organizations or activities in your neighborhood. Spend time in places where people congregate locally. Organize </span><a href="https://www.edmonton.ca/residential_neighbourhoods/neighbourhoods/block-parties-play-streets" rel="">a block party or play street</a><span>. Create a </span><a href="https://www.edmonton.ca/sites/default/files/public-files/Creating_Neighbourly_Block_2.pdf?cb=1720545079" rel="">neighborly block</a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Third, leverage local institutions to build neighborhood community. Schools are best placed for this because of their direct ties to local families and kids, but libraries, local businesses, houses of worship, and any other entity with strong ties to your locale can play an important role. A parents’ group based on the families from the schools in your neighborhood would not only build stronger ties between families but also provide a platform to organize activities where residents get to know each other and develop a stronger sense of mutual support and trust. Working with the local library to organize activities in or geared towards your specific neighborhood would create an opportunity for residents to meet one another. A church, synagogue, or mosque could more proactively embrace the neighborhood, as members of </span><a href="https://www.parishcollective.org/" rel="">Parish Collective</a><span> do. As for businesses, many have an active interest in building social ties with neighbors. Might they want to hold events, contribute to building community, or invest in some way to strengthen local relationships among neighbors? In general, it’s always easier if you find allies among your neighbors, build partnerships with existing institutions, and leverage the assets (cultural, environmental, educational, economic, etc.) you already have locally. Think incrementally, building momentum step by step rather than thinking there is a magic bullet.</span></p><p><span>While it is important to</span><a href="https://conversationswithtyler.com/episodes/jonathan-haidt-anxious-generation/" rel=""> debate</a><span> youth use of social media, and whether the government should regulate it, what is missing from this discussion is the strength of “the little society” that kids inhabit daily. There are real tradeoffs in using social media, and external factors heavily impact the mix and balance between the positives and negatives involved. As Zach</span><a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/06/06/opinion/religious-teens-mental-health/" rel=""> writes</a><span>, kids “</span><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1moM3e_dcajEJzDR_uBK1mIs3hZ8vFZJ4MfUx7NZIx3I/edit#gid=1666441069" rel="">rooted</a><a href="https://publicsquaremag.org/dialogue/persuasion/belonging-and-believing-in-conservative-and-liberal-religion/" rel=""> in their</a><span> real-world communities” are “</span><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1moM3e_dcajEJzDR_uBK1mIs3hZ8vFZJ4MfUx7NZIx3I/edit#gid=1666441069" rel="">less likely</a><span> to move their lives so deeply into the virtual world.” Instead, they “continue to spend more time with friends and trusted adults in person. They are, therefore, less likely to become anxious and depressed when they trade in their flip phones for smartphones, and they are also better able to find social support, which may make online harms less painful.”</span></p><p>What matters for our kids is not online connections, but in-person relationships; not just individual friendships but the strength and abundance of neighborhood institutions. Robust communities will foster hundreds of relationships and dozens of place-based institutions engendering trust, fraternity, mutual support, and stewardship. These will shape how we raise our kids and how they will, in turn, raise their own.</p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.afterbabel.com/p/the-upstream-cause-of-the-youth-mental?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://www.afterbabel.com/p/the-upstream-cause-of-the-youth-mental?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Two years ago, Sarah Shomstein realized she didn’t have a mind’s eye. The vision scientist was sitting in a seminar room, listening to a scientific talk, when the presenter asked the audience to imagine an apple. Shomstein closed her eyes and did so. Then, the presenter asked the crowd to open their eyes and rate how vividly they saw the apple in their mind.</p>
<p>Saw the apple? Shomstein was confused. She didn’t actually <em>see</em> an apple. She could think about an apple: its taste, its shape, its color, the way light might hit it. But she didn’t see it. Behind her eyes, “it was completely black,” Shomstein recalled. And yet, “I imagined an apple.” Most of her colleagues reacted differently. They reported actually seeing an apple, some vividly and some faintly, floating like a hologram in front of them.</p>
<p>In that moment, Shomstein, who’s spent years <a href="https://psychology.columbian.gwu.edu/sarah-shomstein">researching perception</a> at George Washington University, realized she experienced the world differently than others. She is part of a subset of people — thought to be about 1% to 4% of the general population — who lack mental imagery, a phenomenon known as aphantasia. Though it was described more than 140 years ago, the term “aphantasia” was coined only in 2015. It immediately drew the attention of anyone interested in how the imagination works.</p>

<p>That included neuroscientists. So far, they’re finding that aphantasia is not a disorder — it’s a different way of experiencing the world. Early studies have suggested that differences in the connections between brain regions involved in vision, memory and decision-making could explain variations in people’s ability to form mental images. Because many people with aphantasia dream in images and can recognize objects and faces, it seems likely that their minds store visual information — they just can’t access it voluntarily or can’t use it to generate the experience of imagery.</p>
<p>That’s just one explanation for aphantasia. In reality, people’s subjective experiences vary dramatically, and it’s possible that different subsets of aphantasics have their own neural explanations. Aphantasia and hyperphantasia, the opposite phenomenon in which people report mental imagery as vivid as reality, are in fact two ends of a spectrum, sandwiching an infinite range of internal experiences between them.</p>
<p>“We think we know what we mean when we talk about what mental imagery is,” said <a href="https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/74410-nadine-dijkstra">Nadine Dijkstra</a>, a postdoctoral researcher at University College London who studies perception. “But then when you really dig into it, everybody experiences something wildly different.”</p>
<p>That makes studying aphantasia, hyperphantasia and other internal experiences difficult — but far from unimaginable.</p>
<h2><strong>The Mind’s Eye</strong></h2>
<p>The brain’s process for creating mental images can be described as perception in reverse.</p>
<p>When we perceive something in front of us, “we try to infer meaning from an image,” Dijkstra said. Electromagnetic waves enter our eyes, are translated into neural signals and then flow to the back of the brain, where they’re processed in the visual cortex. The information then flows forward toward the front of the brain into memory or semantic regions — a pipeline that ends with us knowing we are looking at a cat or a cup of coffee.</p>
<p>“During imagination, we basically do the opposite,” Dijkstra said. You start with knowing what you want to imagine, like a cat, and information flows from the brain’s memory and semantic regions to the visual cortex, where the image is sketched. However, that’s a working model of visual imagination; there’s still much that is not known about the process, such as where mental imagery begins and the exact role of the visual cortex.</p>

<p>These processes were even less defined in 2003, when an articulate and bright 60-year-old man walked into <a href="https://psychology.exeter.ac.uk/people/profile/index.php?web_id=adam_zeman">Adam Zeman</a>’s office. Zeman, a neurologist at the universities of Edinburgh and Exeter who studies visual imagery, listened as the patient recounted how, following a cardiac procedure, he could no longer conjure mental images. Before, when he read a novel, he could see the characters and the scenes. When he lost something, he could visualize where it might be. After his procedure, his mental stage was empty.</p>
<p>At the time, evidence was accumulating that the visual cortex activates when people imagine or perceive something. Zeman wondered whether his patient’s visual cortex had become somehow deactivated. He had the patient, Jim Campbell, lie down in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) machine, which measures blood flow in the brain as a proxy for neural activity. Zeman showed Campbell pictures of famous people and then asked him to imagine them. In the scans, Campbell’s visual cortex lit up only when he saw the photos. In a 2010 <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2009.08.024">case study</a>, Zeman described him as having “blind imagination.”</p>
<p>After <em>Discover </em>magazine covered the case study, Zeman heard from an additional 20 or so people who said that they, like Campbell, couldn’t visualize images in their minds. Unlike Campbell, however, these people hadn’t lost the ability. They never had it in the first place.</p>

<p>Apparently, this was a somewhat common experience. In 2015, Zeman consulted a classicist friend to come up with a name for it. The classicist suggested adapting Aristotle’s word “phantasia,” for “mind’s eye,” to describe the phenomenon, and the term “aphantasia” was born. Soon after Zeman’s team reported the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cortex.2015.05.019">shiny new term</a>, <em>The New York Times</em> published <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/23/science/aphantasia-minds-eye-blind.html">a story</a> about aphantasia, triggering a fresh flood of interest. Zeman has now received more than 17,000 emails from people wanting to learn more about their vivid mind’s eye, or lack thereof.</p>
<p>“Creating the terms turned out to be an unexpectedly good trick to attract a lot of interest,” Zeman said.</p>
<p>At dinner tables around the world, friends and family discussed whether they could imagine an apple. Philosophers used aphantasia as an excuse to probe explanations for the mind. <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/research/az/cspe/engagement/extreme-imagination/online-exhibition/">Art exhibitions</a> displayed works created by people with these extremes in visualization.</p>
<p>And scientists dreamed up new ways to study aphantasia as a window into how imagination works.</p>
<h2><strong>Making Connections</strong></h2>
<p>Studying aphantasia wasn’t easy. How do you measure someone else’s inner reality? For years, research “focused on showing that the condition exists,” Shomstein said.</p>
<p>Early studies relied on reports from participants — and they still do. The most famous test is called the <a href="https://aphantasia.com/study/vviq/">Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire</a>, created in 1973 to study the strength of mental imagery, long before aphantasia was named. However, such tests rely on introspection and self-reported experience, which made some neuroscientists doubt that aphantasia was real. Could reported differences in visual imagery be a language disconnect, given the ambiguity in how we describe our inner worlds?</p>

<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Q</strong>: Why is it called "ell"?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>A</strong>: "ell" is a combination of shell and LLM. It is a shell script to use LLM backends. "shellm" was once considered, but it was dropped because it could be misunderstood as "she llm". "ell" is shorter, easy to type and easy to remember. It does not conflict with any active software. Note that the name "shell" of shell scripts is because it is the outer layer of the operating system exposed to the user. It doesn't indicate that it is a CLI or GUI. Unfortunately it cannot be shortened to "L" which has the same pronunciation because that would conflict with too many things.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Q</strong>: Why is it written in Bash?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>A</strong>: Because Bash is the most common shell on Unix-like systems and there is just no need to use a more complex language for this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Q</strong>: What is the difference between ell and other similar projects?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>A</strong>: ell is written in almost pure Bash, which makes it very lightweight and easy to install. It is also very easy to extend and modify. It is pipe friendly, which means it is designed to be used in combination with other tools.</p>

<p><img width="450" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/astronomical/neutron_star_quark_core.jpg">
</p>
<p>Wow — evidence that very massive neutron stars may have cores made of deconfined quark matter!   The idea of a ‘quark star’ is not new, but I didn’t know it was a serious possibility.</p>
<p>An ordinary neutron star has a core made mostly of densely packed neutrons.  A matchbox-sized chunk of this stuff weighs about 3 billion tonnes.   But if you squeeze this stuff hard enough, eventually the neutrons break.  Each neutron consists of 3 quarks held together by gluons.  So when the neutrons break you get ‘quark matter’ — a sea of quarks and gluons, no longer confined in neutrons.</p>
<p>We’ve made something similar here on Earth: at CERN and Brookhaven, physicists smack atomic nuclei at each other so hard that the protons and neutrons break and momentarily form a ‘quark-gluon plasma’.   But the conditions in a neutron star core are different: cooler, but more pressure — and not just temporary.</p>
<p>This new paper tries to take the measured properties of massive neutron stars and see if they fit a model where the inner core is made of deconfined quark matter:</p>
<p>• Eemeli Annala, Tyler Gorda, Joonas Hirvonen, Oleg Komoltsev, Aleksi Kurkela, Joonas Nättilä and Aleksi Vuorinen, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11356">Strongly interacting matter exhibits deconfined behavior in massive neutron stars</a>, <i>Nature Communications</i> <b>14</b> (2023), 8451.</p>
<p>They say it does with about 80% probability!   I’d take this with a big grain of salt, but it’s an exciting possibility.   It’s not every day we find quintillions of tonnes of a new state of matter.</p>
<p>For me, the coolest part is that deconfined quark matter may have an extra symmetry, called ‘conformal symmetry’.  This means that if you zoom in on it, it looks almost the same.   An atom looks like a blob with some specific size.   So does a neutron.   But a system with conformal symmetry is just a blur spread out everywhere — and if you zoom in or zoom out, you see something very similar.  This is crazy.</p>
<p>We see matter with conformal symmetry elsewhere too, like at ‘critical points’.   As you know, when you heat water it boils.  There’s a sharp divide between liquid and gas.   But as you keep boosting the pressure, the boiling point increases.  And at 647 degrees kelvin and 220 times ordinary atmospheric pressure something weird happens: the distinction between liquid and gas ends!    This is called a ‘critical point’.</p>
<p><img width="450" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/chemical/water_phase_diagram.png">
</p>
<p>Right at the critical point, water looks weird.  It look like a blur of droplets floating in gas.  But if you look at any droplet you’ll see it’s full of bubbles of gas.  And if you look in any of these bubbles you see it’s full of droplets.   As you keep zooming in, you keep seeing basically the same thing…. droplets of liquid in gas, bubbles of gas in liquid…. until you get down to the scale of atoms.  So we say this stuff has ‘conformal symmetry’.</p>
<p>The math of this is incredibly cool: it’s called ‘conformal field theory’, and a lot of mathematicians and physicists study it.   So it would be really neat if extremely heavy neutron stars turn out to be made of deconfined quark matter with conformal symmetry… or even just <i>approximate</i> conformal symmetry.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="mxmain"><p><a href="https://mitxela.com/projects/hardware"><img onload="this.style.opacity=1;" src="https://mitxela.com/img/titles/mitxela_dot_com-65.png" title="Back to Hardware" alt="Back to Hardware"></a></p><p>31 Jul 2024<br><b>Progress: Complete</b></p><p>
Is it possible to add optical wireless communication to a circuit, without adding any more components to it? Let's find out.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/lightcomm/ledbanner2.jpg" alt="Closeup of surface mount LEDs"></p><h3>Preamble</h3><p>
I don't have much amateur radio experience (none at all, specifically) but I do enjoy chatting to various folks who've delved into the deepest niches of the subject. Regular amateur radio is too mainstream, see, so many enthusiasts carve out their own subcategories.</p><p>

A comedic example, parked nicely on the thinnest wedge of the venn diagram, is the HamFurs – people who do amateur radio while wearing fur suits. While it isn't my cup of tea, I love that such a group exists. They seemed like nice people when I chatted to them.</p><p>

Most subcategories do relate to radio in some way though. Some years ago I talked at length with a guy doing AmSat (amateur satellite tracking). He was listening to a very high frequency signal, I think it was 40GHz, and I specifically remember the antenna looked like a plastic disk. At such frequencies, the waves can be focused the way a lens focuses light.</p><p>

Another niche I was only recently alerted to is the Nanowave group. The goal here is to communicate in the hundreds of terahertz range, i.e. visible light. That might sound a bit dull, given the existence of infrared remotes, and the ubiquitiy of optical fibres, but the aim with nanowave is non-line-of-sight communication over many miles via <i>cloud bounce</i>.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/lightcomm/cloudbounce.jpg" alt="Cloud bounce diagram"></p><p>

The light shined on the clouds isn't visible to the naked eye, but by clever modulation and even cleverer signal recovery algorithms, surprisingly large distances have been achieved. A neat thing about it is that you don't even need a license!</p><p>

Many GPS modules, even cheap ones, can track signals at ludicrously low signal levels. I have some here that can track satellites at a received signal strength of -167dBm. It's hard to believe power levels could even go that low. This is managed partly by the way the signals are modulated, they have a high symbol rate (1Mbps) but a very low data rate (50bps). A similar performing ham radio technology is WSPR, which can recover signals from far below the noise floor.</p><p>

I guess I enjoy the idea of taking this sort of technology and applying it to the pointless, yet fascinating, challenge of light communication via cloud bounce. However, I'm rambling, and today's project doesn't really have much to do with this, except for the relevant fact that we're communicating with light.</p><h3>A light amplifier</h3><p>
Recall my attempts at an <a href="https://mitxela.com/projects/automatic_led">automatic LED</a>. There I used an STM32 and some hackery to automatically dim an LED based on ambient light levels. It's no secret that LEDs can work as light sensors, the main problem is that they're just not very good at it.</p><p>

When we talk about light communication, there's a definite appeal to using the same component as both transmitter and receiver. For one, the optical alignment for bidirectional signalling is going to be perfect. But the primary appeal to me is the reduced component count.</p><p>

I've produced a few different pieces of LED jewellery, and one of the tricky problems is giving the right level of control over the flashing patterns. Sensors can be used for reactive patterns (microphones, or temperature/heartbeat etc) but often we want to provide a way for the wearer to directly control it. The simplest option is a small switch to cycle through modes. Adding a bluetooth antenna is not impossible, possibly even using the chassis as the antenna, though in the case of the <a href="https://mitxela.com/projects/scaffold">industrial piercing</a> the chassis was used as one of the connections to the battery. I considered a hall sensor, which could be very small, responding perhaps to a magnet embedded in another bit of jewellery, but at the end of the project I felt like the best direction to go in would probably be an infrared receiver.</p><p>

Infrared is arguably nanowave comms, and TV remotes generally have very good performance, so let's talk a little about how they work. An infrared LED produces light at say, 1μm wavelength, or about 300THz. In a sense, this is our carrier frequency, and the infrared receiver has a filter window over it, which blocks light that isn't in the vicinity of this wavelength.</p><p>

But the IR signal is modulated with another carrier signal, this time in the kilohertz range (usually 38kHz, but it varies). There are a few reasons for this, one is that directly modulating the light frequency is technically difficult, but turning an LED on and off at kilohertz speeds is easy. Another reason is that the receiver is going to have a response time based on its capacitance. The IR LED could be modulated at many megahertz, but decoding this is going to need a high bandwidth sensor (expensive). To keep costs down, in consumer IR these kilohertz frequencies are used.</p><p>

The primary reason for the kilohertz carrier is for noise immunity. In addition to the IR filter window, we can bandpass filter for the kilohertz carrier. There is a lot of stray IR light in the world, but natural sources of light aren't going to be modulated in a way that gets through this filter.</p><p>

Finally this double-carrier is modulated with the data to be transmitted, usually with simple on/off keying, giving us a data rate of maybe 100 bits per second.</p><p>

Decoding the IR signal has a few important steps. It is extremely unusual to roll your own demodulator, there are plenty of parts available which are a single component with sensor and demodulated output. Here's a block diagram from the datasheet of one of them:</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/lightcomm/ir-demodulation.png" alt="IR demodulation block diagram"></p><p>

The input stage is a transimpedance amplifier, the PIN diode is used for its low capacitance. </p><p>

The AGC is probably the most important part to get reliable operation over a wide range of distances. While the PIN diode is a much better light sensor than trying to use an LED, there will only be a certain range of light levels where it functions correctly. Too much light and the output will saturate, too little and we won't have a signal. The AGC, automatic gain control, adjusts the gain to give us the maximum dynamic range.</p><p>

Most IR receivers are physically large, the very smallest ones I could find are Vishay TSOP574... series, which are surface mount in a 4x4mm package. That is very small, and I will probably try and work one into some jewellery at some point, but it's still a lot bigger (and more power hungry) than a single LED. We're not going to be able to make anything nearly as good on our own, but can we make something <i>good enough</i>?</p><h3>Op-amp on the CH32V003</h3>
<p><img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/lightcomm/ch32v003_1.jpg" alt="Bare ch32v003 chips"></p><p>

The CH32V series is the RISC-V line of CH32 parts. The CH32F parts that came first are essentially clones of the STM32F series and many features of the CH32V are directly inspired by them. I have been playing around with the CH32V003, an exceptionally cheap microcontroller, and much like many of the STM32 parts, one of its peripherals is a general purpose op-amp. I decided to have a play around with it.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/lightcomm/ch32v003f4p6.png" alt="CH32V003F4U6 pinout with OPA pins highlighted"></p><p>

There is very little documentation on the built-in op-amp, presumably because there is very little to it. Just three bits within the Extended Control Register (EXTEND_CTR), to enable it and toggle whether the alternate pins are used. Within the system block diagram we can see the opamp is connected to those pins I've highlighted in green above, and also potentially to the ADC and TIM2.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/lightcomm/system_diagram_crop.png" alt="Part of the system block diagram from the CH32V003 reference manual"></p><p>

I'm not sure if there's an internal connection between the op-amp output and the ADC, but both are connected to PD4, which is analog channel 7. The output voltage is of course exposed on PD4, since you wouldn't be able to build a negative feedback loop without it. I have not looked into using it as a comparator (open loop) and whether you could use PD4 for something else in that case.</p><p>

The final bit of info is some electrical characteristics listed in the datasheet (not reference manual). </p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/lightcomm/opa-characteristics.png" alt="OPA characteristics table from datasheet"></p><p>

Looks a lot like an op-amp. The output is rail-to-rail, which we would hope for, if we're planning to run this from 3V.</p><p>

The reason using the built-in op-amp for this is so appealing is that it can be switched in and out of the circuit, the same way the pins can be reconfigured as GPIO. The bare minimum we need to add for a transimpedance amplifier is a single feedback resistor. Our first attempt looks like this:</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/lightcomm/schematic1.png" alt="Initial schematic"></p><p>

The non-inverting input of the opamp needs to be held at a fixed voltage for the thing to work. I initially tried simply configuring PA2 as an output, but I wasn't convinced this worked correctly. We could tie it to ground (or VDD) but it's much more preferable to have software control of the connection, so I wired it to the neighbouring PD0. </p><p>

When detecting light, the LED can optionally be reverse biased, which improves response time, but our concern is more about voltage levels and saturation at the output. The supply voltage is between 3V and ground. If we've wired up the circuit so as to produce a negative voltage output we won't get any output at all. By setting the cathode to VDD (i.e. PD0 high) we bring the output into a usable range.</p><p>

To illuminate the LED, we set PA1 and PA2 to outputs, with PA1 high and PA2 low. You'll notice there's no current limiting resistor there. I frequently wire LEDs up to microcontrollers without limiting resistors, the "on" resistance of the output FETs means the current is predictable and usually tolerable. Even if this current is higher than we'd like, we can just drop the duty cycle.</p><p>

Here's a picture of my first board (that doesn't exactly match the schematic above, but I played around with various different configurations):</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/lightcomm/devboard1.jpg" alt="Test circuit with resistor and LED"></p><h3>First results</h3><p>
The feedback resistor sets the gain on the amplifier. I started with 1MΩ, then 10MΩ and 22MΩ (biggest value I had to hand).</p><p>

I configured the ADC to spit out values over the debug connection and shined a torch on the creation.</p><p>

It certainly isn't the most sensitive detector in existence, but at the highest gain the effect of shining a torch on it is quite obvious up to about 20cm (eight inches) away. One very noticeable thing is that the through-mount LED is extremely sensitive to direction. I suspect this is a physical effect with how light interacts with the crystal structure. If it's on-axis the sensitivity is quite high, but even slightly off-axis and it drops to piss-poor.</p><p>

I switched out the LED for a surface mount one. At the very least, problems with acceptance angle and focusing shouldn't matter here, as the plastic moulding is flat and in close proximity to the LED crystal. Subjectively, this does feel a lot less sensitive to incidence angle.</p><p>

Overall, for the cost of adding just a single resistor, getting a light sensor that can detect a signal over a few inches still feels like a win. It's possible we can up the gain further still. Ideally, we'd have adjustable gain, which would let us do our own AGC if the thing does get swamped by too much light. </p><p>

One option is using the alternate pins of the opamp to have two distinct gain levels. Another option, if we have multiple LEDs in the circuit, is connecting them in parallel to boost the signal. If the circuit has a matrix of LEDs (likely) then we could potentially wire a whole row of them up to the circuit. The column drivers could selectively be biased, to control which LEDs are part of the amplifier circuit.</p><p>

Before we get ahead of ourselves, let's try and get some communication going over this channel.</p><h3>Second board, and more boards</h3><p>
For communication we'll need two circuits, so I wired up another CH32V003 with an LED and a resistor.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/lightcomm/devboard2.jpg" alt="Second test circuit with resistor and LED"></p><p>

I initially wired it up incorrectly. This is on one of my own 0.4mm QFN breakout boards but the snag is that the pinout of the different CH32V003 packages aren't the same.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/lightcomm/ch32v003f4u6.png" alt="CH32V003F4U6 pinout"></p><p>

I was getting a bit sick of wiring up that same three-pin header each time too, so this pushed me over the edge to make yet another breakout board, this time explicitly for the CH32V003. While the pinouts between the packages are not the same, the internal die is, so the <i>order</i> of the pins around the packages match. With some creative thinking, it's just possible to construct a single footprint that supports both packages.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/lightcomm/dualdevboards.jpg" alt="CH32V003 dev boards with dual footprint"></p><p>

This means we can label the pins semantically instead of by number and we're less likely to make mistakes. I also put a couple of capacitor footprints on there just in case.</p><p>

With that narrative diversion complete, let's jump back into the light comms stuff.</p><h3>Reception logic</h3><p>
I now had one board blinking its LED and the other board detecting it. I made sure both LEDs were the same wavelength, which happened to be a nice orange colour. It's possible that different colour LEDs have different sensitivity. I would imagine blue or white LEDs would behave worse, as the phosphors emit light at a longer wavelength than the bandgap. I have not actually investigated yet though.</p><p>

The ADC reads <code>0x3FF</code> when the circuit is in the "dark" although it doesn't seem at all sensitive to the room lights. When the other LED faces it, the reading dips and eventually gets to zero when the two LEDs are almost touching. In this setup, with the surface mount LEDs, the largest distance a signal can reliably be detected is maybe three inches.</p><p>

The CH32V003 has no floating point unit or even a hardware multiplier, but it does run at 48MHz so there's a fair amount we can do. The initial plan was to do something like this:</p><ul>
<li>Sample the ADC at, say, four or eight times the carrier frequency
</li><li>Perform a moving average filter (just additions and shifts) and subtract this from the signal, to remove the DC offset
</li><li>Threshold the signal into a binary stream
</li><li>Within a moving window, hunt for our carrier frequency. Similar to how one might approach a phase-locked loop. The presence (or absence) of the carrier represents our output data stream.
</li></ul><p>

It certainly should be possible to achieve as good a performance as an off-the-shelf demodulator, if the sensor is sufficiently sensitive, and the dynamic range is available. However, when the output flatlines at anything over six inches away, all that filtering for noise immunity does seem somewhat pointless. Again, it may be possible to up the gain further, perhaps 100M or 1GΩ as the feedback resistor, but this probably isn't going to help. The open loop gain is stated as 105dB which is about 1.8x10<sup>5</sup>. There's only so much we can do with a single opamp. I did try the circuit with no feedback resistor at all, and the output was consistently zero, so whatever leakage currents we have, they aren't in a useful direction.</p><p>

The point I'm getting at is if the boards have to be so close together for it to work, why even bother with analog signal recovery? We can forget the ADC and let the GPIO input be a simple threshold of signal/no-signal. The analog reading drops to a logic-low level when the two LEDs are about 1cm apart. In this case, there is pretty much zero chance of ambient light affecting things. Even in direct sunlight I think one circuit board is going to shadow the other.</p><p>

I slightly rewired the circuits to connect up the existing UART hardware. This requires a couple of jump wires but the component count is still just one LED, one resistor, and the CH32V003.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/lightcomm/schematic2.png" alt="Schematic with UART TX/RX wired up"></p><p>

The ADC can be disabled or ignored. In reception mode, the op-amp produces a signal on PD4 which is then directly connected to the UART RX pin, on PD6. The output signal is high when in the dark, and drops low when light shines on the LED. UART reception is idle-high and the start condition is low, so this works perfectly to automatically wait for reception.</p><p>

In transmit mode, PA1 is high and PA2 is floating. UART TX on PD5 is idle-high, active-low, so when the UART signal drops low the LED will illuminate.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/lightcomm/devboard3.jpg" alt="Both dev boards with SMD LEDs and 22M resistors"></p><p>

With this hardware arrangement, we can simply use the UART hardware to transmit and receive as if there was a physical connection between the boards. On condition they are within 1cm of each other of course.</p><p>

With the two LEDs sufficiently close, the message gets through intact, so this seems like a comfortable speed. It also ties in nicely with the consumer IR frequencies being around 40kHz.</p><p>

One of the ideas I had been working towards here was to use the UART hardware for our secondary carrier. We could transmit only bytes of <code>0b10101010</code> which would form a pulse train similar to the consumer IR transmitters. The receiver would have to throw away any bytes that aren't <code>0x55</code> or <code>0xAA</code> and the data would be based on the timings between bytes. While this probably would give us a lot of noise immunity (and decimate our data rate) given the integrity of the messages above it doesn't really seem worth it. A better option would be to simply construct a packet format with a lot of redundancy and error checking. Perhaps send the same data again but with all the bits inverted, and then a checksum.</p><p>

As it is quite short, I think I'll post the full source code for the above experiment here, but don't go away – the story continues after the break.</p><pre><span>#include "ch32v003fun.h"

A note about baudrate setting. The formula to get the correct BRR value is a little involved, as it includes a bitfield for a fractional divider. In the ch32v003fun header there's a five-stage macro to calculate it, which originally I just dropped in, then output the calculation with a <code>#pragma message</code> for my own info.</p><p>

As I write this up I figured it's really not that much trouble to make a spreadsheet print out the numbers. They should have stuck something like this in the datasheet. Assuming your clock speed is 48MHz, here are the USART_BRR values for common baud rates:</p><table>

</tbody></table><h3>Light bootloader for OTA updates</h3><p>
Consider a couple of recent projects, the <a href="https://mitxela.com/projects/badge">badge</a> and the <a href="https://mitxela.com/projects/ledstud">LED matrix earrings</a>, both of which use a CH32V003 and a matrix of LEDs. If I want to change what they display, the only option is to reprogram the chip, which is quite tricky for the earrings. Even the badge is awkward to update. If I hand them out to people, it would be nice if they could change what it does.</p><p>

So an admirable goal would be to use this light comm idea to update the animation patterns. I think the first question is whether this should use a dedicated device (a programming circuit, perhaps within a charging case) or generic light, say, from a phone. The circuit definitely responds to the torch light from my phone, but I don't think we can modulate that from an app (or can we? see below). Blinking the screen is going to be very limited in data rate, but I suppose it's an option. Another disadvantage to that is that it's unidirectional which could make the process even more tedious.</p><p>

The second question is whether to do a full bootloader or merely update a data segment. The CH32V003 has 2kB of SRAM and 16kB of flash memory. It also has a separate 2kB of flash memory as a bootloader segment. From the factory, a system bootloader is present there which can be dumped, but it can also be erased and filled with your own bootloader. The code on the earrings is very short, maybe 1kB, but there's about 10kB of animation data too. We could dedicate an area of memory, say the last 14kB, to be data segments and rewrite these as we wish. The first 2kB would be left alone so there's no risk of corrupting the code and ending in an unrecoverable state. But this wouldn't allow us to add new modes.</p><p>

Alternatively, we could write a proper bootloader that replaces the whole flash memory, but then we run the risk of partial or failed updates leaving the thing in a non-working state. There are plenty of workarounds, such as splitting the memory in half and always keeping a full copy of a working firmware image. A lot of the techniques target complex applications (say, you have a networking stack that wouldn't fit into the bootloader segment) and are probably overkill here.</p><p>

In the case of the badge, perhaps all it needs is the ability to change what text is displayed, which would be a few hundred bytes at most.</p><p>

Let us investigate the schematic for the badge.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/lightcomm/badge-sch2.png" alt="Badge schematic"></p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/lightcomm/badge-sch1.png" alt="Badge matrix schematic"></p><p>

Evidently I did not design it with this in mind, but we got lucky. There was only a 50% chance of having a row of LED anodes on PA1. It's labelled column 6. The output of the opamp is on PD4, or column 3, and the noninverting input is on column 7.</p><p>

Obviously we could redesign the schematic of the badge if it comes to it, but I would really love to add this power to the existing badge by doing nothing more than adding one resistor.</p><p>

Looking at the alternate pins for the op-amp, we can reconfigure the noninverting input to be on PD7, that is, NRST. Fantastic, as that pin is only used for the switch. The reset pin isn't used for debugging, and it's possible to reconfigure it to be generic IO. We need the noninverting input to be held at VCC. I already ruled out configuring it as an output, but what I found does work is enabling the pullup resistor. The op-amp should draw no current, so the pullup should keep it firmly at VCC. As a bonus, it doesn't short the chip out if you press the button. I tested both configurations: as a GPIO with pullup, or just as a reset pin with automatic internal pullup. Both work fine.</p><p>

I dug out the dev board for the badge, and added our high value resistor between PD4 and PA1. Setting all of the cathode pins output high puts eight LEDs into our amplifier circuit in parallel.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/lightcomm/badgedev1.jpg" alt="Badge dev board with 22M resistor"></p><p>

(Ignore the small black wire just above the resistor, it's only connected at one end.)</p><p>

I loaded up my simple program to dump ADC values to the terminal and it took me a moment to figure out what was going on. If I shine the torch on the whole matrix, I don't get much of a reading, but as I sweep the torch over the matrix it responds quite significantly. This is because we have rows of LEDs connected to both ends of our amplifier. One of the rows is directly connected to the op-amp output, so any induced current is going to directly counteract our reading. I added some black tape over the LEDs that we don't care about:</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/lightcomm/badgedev2.jpg" alt="Badge dev board with black tape"></p><p>

Suddenly the thing sprang to life, with dare I say, about eight times the sensitivity of the original circuit. I mean it's not going to win any awards but I can wave my phone torch and see the reading change up to about an arm's length away.</p><p>

One row of LEDs is connected to PD4, the op-amp output. I unsoldered this connection and tried it without the tape. The reading became quite noisy, and still improved when I put the tape back on, so I think it's more than a single row of LEDs causing problems. Without significantly rewiring the circuit I'm not sure how we can get perfect sensitivity. As a compromise, we can use the alternate pin for the op-amp inverting input, which means the light-sensitive row is now at the edge of the matrix on column 8.</p><p>

Without the tape, it's not too hard to aim a torch on half the matrix and get a clear reading. Hmm.</p><h3>Light (very light) transmissions</h3><p>
I made a small program that I could run on a smartphone to flash a thin rectangle of the display. The idea is that we could ask the user to place the badge face flat on the screen, within a designated rectangle, and the screen would flash only in the region of the sensitive LEDs.</p><p>

Results were mixed. The phone screen needs to be on the highest brightness and the "night light" (blue light filter) disabled.</p><p>

The biggest problem is that the capacitive touch screen is interacting with our measurement. When the circuit is held a few millimetres away from the screen, it reads fine, but if it's in direct contact the reading goes haywire. Perhaps using a desktop monitor instead would give better results. Overall, I wasn't too convinced this was a reliable way to update the thing.</p><p>

I did some research and it transpires that controlling the smartphone torch from userspace is possible. Not just possible, but possible from javascript, at least on Android. The method is to request access to the camera, and then deep within the constraints there is a means to control the torch.</p><p>

I made a program to blink the torch as fast as we can, and yes, it technically modulates. The shortest pulse possible was about 30ms, but it's extremely unreliable. The latency of updating it is bad, but the jitter is absolutely atrocious. Testing this on a Pixel 6a, every few seconds there's about 150ms of jitter. Part of this is because it's javascript, part of it is the OS and how they probably never expected anyone to want to do this.</p><p>

If we can cope with a very low bitrate, at least it's easy to point the torch at half the badge and get a nice clean signal.</p><p>

In javascript, I wrote the simplest program to transmit uart by blinking the torch at a glacial pace. The bit period is 200ms, so our baud is 5, or one byte every two seconds.</p><p>

On the receive end, I wrote a software uart receiver. Even if we could configure the hardware uart to run that slowly, it's connected to the wrong part of the matrix.</p><p>

Any faster than 5bps and it seems to regularly corrupt the data. Recovering from a frame error is quite tedious, perhaps it's worth adding delays between bytes to give it more chance to resync. However, the fact is, I now had "wireless" transmission from a smartphone to the badge.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/lightcomm/phone-torch.jpg" alt="A re-enactment of shining the phone torch onto badge dev board"></p><p>

It crossed my mind to use morse code. This would honestly be faster as an encoding, but it's limited as there's no case sensitivity. The encode/decode is also more effort than the simplicity of uart (which is just start/stop bits around the data). As we're sending ascii I reduced the uart to 7-bit packets, which gives us a 10% speedup in transmission.</p><p>

The javascript program necessitates access to the phone's camera, so the possibility of bidirectional communication is not off the table. The fact we have to angle the torch at only half the matrix makes this a little less convenient though.</p><h3>Optimisation ad infinitum</h3><p>
Hold on to your hats, because things are about to get exciting.</p><p>

To reduce the influence of the other LEDs, I dropped the gain of the amplifier, swapping the feedback resistor with a 1M. I confirmed it still worked, but the effects of doing this led me to poke around some more. After thinking about it for a bit, I got rid of the resistor entirely. This puts us into open-loop configuration, which is dangerous territory as it's usually highly dependent on random manufacturing differences, but the results this time were quite unexpected. It turns out that the feedback resistor had been suppressing a more dominant effect.</p><p>

The columns of LEDs feed their tiny current into both ends of the amplifier. Without the feedback resistor, this turns into an <i>optical differential amplifier</i>. Essentially a comparator, with the output determined by which column is more illuminated.</p><p>

Forget shining a torch a few inches away, the badge suddenly became sensitive enough to notice the shadow of my waving hand from the other side of the room. What's more, because it's a differential input, it's automatically compensating for ambient light levels. I took the board outside and in direct sunlight I get a clear signal as I cast a shadow across the badge. Despite being open-loop, it's not really behaving like a comparator, there's a very clear analog region while the face of the badge is evenly illuminated. Indoors, I can focus the beam of my torch from many metres away, and the output jumps from <code>0</code> to <code>0x3FF</code> as it illuminates one side or the other.</p><p>

Possibly the most pleasing aspect of all this is that we've eliminated the one extra component. That is, we've achieved a very sensitive optical differential amplifier on the badge with <b>no hardware changes at all</b>.</p><p>

This differential mode is much more immune to noise, so flashing a message using the screen of a phone is now easy and reliable, with the effects of the capacitive touch screen drowned out. Compared to the jitter of the torch, the 60Hz refresh rate is very reliable, so data rates can be (comparatively) higher.</p><p>

I don't fully understand what's causing this circuit to behave so well. With the feedback resistor in place, we had something like this:</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/lightcomm/schematic3.png" alt="Schematic with LEDs at input and output of op-amp"></p><p>

The non-inverting input is wired to the reset pin, with its internal pullup of about 50K keeping it at VDD. The input is presumed to draw no current. Both the output and the inverting input have a column of eight LEDs connected, with their cathodes at VDD.</p><p>

With the 1M resistor removed, its behaviour as a differential amplifier is quite confusing. One possible factor is that all of the GPIO pins have ESD protection diodes. The legs of the LEDs are held at VDD via the GPIO output FETs, but if current is generated it would leak back to the actual VDD rail via the diodes. It's possible this leakage is the source of our signal. The bandgap of the ESD diodes will be smaller than the LEDs. The op-amp itself is also powered from VDD, and the output can reach to within a few millivolts of the rails.</p><p>

Every GPIO pin has ESD diodes, which is a lot of diodes, and I tried sketching out which ones might be forming the relevant current paths, but I couldn't come up with anything that fully explained what's going on. I'm convinced that there are more than two columns of LEDs affecting the output, so maybe it's something like this:</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/lightcomm/schematic4.png" alt="Schematic showing effect of ESD protection diodes"></p><p>

The problem with the above, if that is what's going on, is that it doesn't explain why the output is so well balanced. When the matrix is evenly illuminated, the output smoothly hovers around the 50% mark.</p><p>

Various assumptions we have about ideal op-amps no longer apply; the inputs most likely do draw some current. The "50K" pullup is unlikely to be a real resistor, but a transistor mirroring a reference current, which may behave oddly if the supply is fluctuating. I think the most useful thing to do would be to try this on various batches of CH32V003 chips to see what the variation is between them. Unfortunately, right now I've only got one badge left as I've given the others away. I shall have to make some more.</p><h3>To the badge</h3><p>
Somewhat daunted by the task of writing a full bootloader with error correction using the differential optical protocol, after writing the above text I got distracted.</p><p>

Four months later and I remembered that I never actually ported the code onto the real badge. The only feature we actually need to show it off is to change the text that scrolls. That can be stored in RAM, which on the badge is battery-backed so it will persist through "off" mode until the battery is taken out. I hastily mashed the opamp code into the badge repo and delcared a <code>no_init</code> text buffer. The reset pin was configured as GPIO, and interrupts and events were used to recreate the old mode-switching behaviour, along with a long-press to enable programming mode.</p><p>

This was then flashed onto the badge using the tiny exposed SWD pin, possibly for the last time.</p><p>

I was somewhat apprehensive, because I don't fully understand the effect, so it's possible that running the code on a different board would simply not work, but to my relief it seems to work brilliantly. I'm even tempted to turn up the data rate a bit, though with a buffer of only up to 128 characters it's not like the slow bitrate is a problem.</p><p>

Here's a video of it in action:</p><p>

<iframe width="704" height="396" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IHD3ji-F600" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>

One huge improvement would be to swap out the plain UART with some type of polarity-agnostic line coding. Manchester encoding only cares about transitions, not absolute levels. The reason I say this is that programming the badge will only work in one orientation. If you rotate the badge 180 degrees, it just produces a bunch of frame errors.</p><p>

Moving forwards, it would be cool to have the regular modes periodically check for a signal, so it could enter programming mode without needing a button press. That would allow the matrix earrings to be updated this way too.</p><p>

The next step, if we wanted to take it, is write the proper bootloader enabling updates of the whole flash memory.</p><p>

I also think there's scope for some kind of badge game, if a bunch of people had them at an event. The badges could talk to one another when faced directly at each other, so perhaps you could go around an event and collect as many tokens from other badges as possible.</p><div><p>

Anyway, this page is now far longer than I anticipated. The changes to the badge code were pushed to a new branch called <a href="https://github.com/mitxela/badge/tree/programmable">programmable</a> and need the reset pin to be reconfigured as GPIO. The transmit program is in there too, but can also be found <a href="https://mitxela.com/projects/lightcomm/transmit">here</a>.</p></div><nav>
