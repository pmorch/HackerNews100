<p>I am grateful to the journalist Tom Webb, who specialises in data protection, for alerting me to <a href="https://bills.parliament.uk/Publications/57084/Documents/5415" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an amendment to the Data (Use and Access) Bill</a>, currently going through the House of Lords.</p>



<p>It concerns the legal presumption that “mechanical instruments” (which seems to be taken to include computer networks) are working properly if they look to the user like they’re working properly. This has come in for quite a kicking in recent years. I was <a href="http://becarefulwhatyouwishfornickwallis.blogspot.com/2013/08/post-office-2nd-sight-report-into.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first alerted to it in 2013</a> by the barrister Stephen Mason. </p>



<p>Mason has spent longer than a decade telling anyone who will listen it is a deeply flawed legal presumption. <a href="https://read.uolpress.co.uk/read/3a219939-14d3-45c9-9fe0-9b42298ac587/section/0f113452-78ad-4c82-b28f-08cff1877036" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Here he sets out his reasoning</a>. Mason has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/jan/12/update-law-on-computer-evidence-to-avoid-horizon-repeat-ministers-urged" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">won some influential supporters</a> along the way, including Lord (James) Arbuthnot who has also spent longer than a decade campaigning on behalf of Subpostmasters affected by the Post Office scandal.</p>



<p>Although the “mechanical instruments” presumption has never, to the best of my knowledge, been quoted in any civil or criminal proceedings involving a Subpostmaster, it has been said to effectively reverse the burden of proof on anyone who might be convicted using digital evidence. </p>



<p>The logic being if the courts are going to assume a computer was working fine at the time an offence allegedly occurred because it looked like it was working fine, it is then down to the defendant to prove that it was <em>not</em> working fine. This can be extremely difficult to do (per the Seema Misra/Lee Castleton cases).  </p>



<p><a href="https://bills.parliament.uk/Publications/57084/Documents/5415" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">This is the amendment proposed</a> by Lord Arbuthnot and others. I am grateful to Tom for bringing it to my attention. It says:</p>



<p>After Clause 132, insert the following new Clause – </p>



<p>“<strong>Reliability of computer-based evidence</strong></p>



<p>(1) Electronic evidence produced by or derived from a computer, device or computer system (separately or together “system”) is admissible as evidence in any proceedings –</p>



<p>(a) where that electronic evidence and the reliability of the system that produced it or from which it is derived are not challenged;<br>(b) where the court is satisfied that the reliability of the system cannot reasonably be challenged;<br>(c) where the court is satisfied that the electronic evidence is derived from a reliable system.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="498" src="https://www.postofficescandal.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/20210423-Lord-Arbuthnot-outside-RCJ-1024x498.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.postofficescandal.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/20210423-Lord-Arbuthnot-outside-RCJ-1024x498.jpg 1024w, https://www.postofficescandal.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/20210423-Lord-Arbuthnot-outside-RCJ-300x146.jpg 300w, https://www.postofficescandal.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/20210423-Lord-Arbuthnot-outside-RCJ-768x373.jpg 768w, https://www.postofficescandal.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/20210423-Lord-Arbuthnot-outside-RCJ-1536x747.jpg 1536w, https://www.postofficescandal.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/20210423-Lord-Arbuthnot-outside-RCJ-2048x996.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>James Arbuthnot</figcaption></figure>



<p>(2) Rules of Court must provide that electronic evidence sought to be relied upon by a party in any proceedings may be challenged by another party as to its admissibility.</p>



<p>(3) For the purposes of subsection (1)(b), Rules of Court must provide for the circumstances in which the Court may be satisfied that the admissibility of electronic evidence cannot reasonably be challenged.</p>



<p>(4) When determining whether a system is reliable for the purposes of subsection (1)(c) the matters that may be taken into account include –</p>



<p>(a) any instructions or rules of the system that apply to its operation;<br>(b) any measures taken to secure the integrity of data held on the system;<br>(c) any measures taken to prevent unauthorised access to and use of the system;<br>(d) the security of the hardware and software used by the system;<br>(e) any measures taken to monitor and assess the reliability of the system by the system controller or operator including steps taken to fix errors or address unexpected outcomes including the regularity of and extent of any audit of the system by an independent body;<br>(f) any assessment of the reliability of the system made by a body with supervisory or regulatory functions;<br>(g) the provisions of any scheme or industry standard that apply in relation<br>to the system.</p>



<p>(5) For the purposes of this section – </p>



<p>“<em>computer</em>” means any device capable of performing mathematical or logical instructions;<br>“<em>device</em>” means any apparatus or tool operating alone or connected to other apparatus or tools, that processes information or data in electronic form;<br>“<em>electronic evidence</em>” means evidence derived from data contained in or produced by any device the functioning of which depends on a software program or from data stored on a computer, device or computer system or communicated over a networked computer system.”</p>



<p><em><strong>Member’s explanatory statement</strong><br>This amendment overturns the current legal assumption that evidence from computers is always reliable which has contributed to miscarriages of justice including the Horizon Scandal. It enables courts to ask questions of those submitting computer evidence about its reliability.</em></p>

<p>Following a public vote in which more than 37,000 people had their say, we’re pleased to announce that the Oxford Word of the Year for 2024 is ‘brain rot’.</p>
<p>Our language experts created a shortlist of six words to reflect the moods and conversations that have helped shape the past year. After two weeks of public voting and widespread conversation, our experts came together to consider the public’s input, voting results, and our language data, before declaring ‘brain rot’ as the definitive Word of the Year for 2024.</p>

<div data-aos="fade-up" id="block_4c972f2c674656b1ba770666f7af4238">
                <div data-aos="fade-up">
            <h3><strong>Why ‘brain rot’?</strong></h3>
<p>‘Brain rot’ is defined as “the supposed deterioration of a person’s mental or intellectual state, especially viewed as the result of overconsumption of material (now particularly online content) considered to be trivial or unchallenging. Also: something characterized as likely to lead to such deterioration”.</p>
<p>Our experts noticed that ‘brain rot’ gained new prominence this year as a term used to capture concerns about the impact of consuming excessive amounts of low-quality online content, especially on social media. The term increased in usage frequency by 230% between 2023 and 2024.</p>
<p>The first recorded use of ‘brain rot’ was found in 1854 in Henry David Thoreau’s book <em>Walden</em>, which reports his experiences of living a simple lifestyle in the natural world. As part of his conclusions, Thoreau criticizes society’s tendency to devalue complex ideas, or those that can be interpreted in multiple ways, in favour of simple ones, and sees this as indicative of a general decline in mental and intellectual effort: <em>“While England endeavours to cure the potato rot, will not any endeavour to cure the brain-rot – which prevails so much more widely and fatally?”</em></p>

                                    </p>
            </div>







<p>The term has taken on new significance in the digital age, especially over the past 12 months. Initially gaining traction on social media platform—particularly on TikTok among Gen Z and Gen Alpha communities—’brain rot’ is now seeing more widespread use, such as in mainstream journalism, amidst societal concerns about the negative impact of overconsuming online content.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2024, ‘brain rot’ is used to describe both the cause and effect of this, referring to low-quality, low-value content found on social media and the internet, as well as the subsequent negative impact that consuming this type of content is perceived to have on an individual or society.</p>



<p>It has also been used more specifically and consistently in reference to online culture. Often used in a humorous or self-deprecating manner by online communities, it is strongly associated with certain types of content—including creator Alexey Gerasimov’s viral <em>Skibidi Toilet</em> video series, featuring humanoid toilets, and user-generated ‘only in Ohio’ memes, which reference bizarre incidents in the state. This content has given rise to emerging ‘brain rot language’—such as ‘skibidi’, meaning something nonsensical, and ‘Ohio’, meaning something embarrassing or weird—which reflects a growing trend of words originating in viral online culture before spreading offline into the ‘real world’.</p>



<p>Now also gaining momentum is a broader, more serious conversation about the potential negative impact that excessively consuming this content might have on mental health, particularly in children and young people. Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.newportinstitute.com/resources/co-occurring-disorders/brain-rot/#:~:text=Brain%20rot%20is%20a%20condition,negative%20and%20distressing%20news%20online." target="_blank" rel="noopener">a mental health centre</a> in the US even published advice online about how to recognize and avoid ‘brain rot’.</p>



<p>Speaking about this year’s selection process and the 2024 winner, Casper Grathwohl, President of Oxford Languages, said:</p>



<p><em>“It’s been insightful and deeply moving to see language lovers all over the world participate and help us select the Oxford Word of the Year 2024.</em></p>



<p><em>“Looking back at the Oxford Word of the Year over the past two decades, you can see society’s growing preoccupation with how our virtual lives are evolving, the way internet culture is permeating so much of who we are and what we talk about. Last year’s winning word, ‘rizz’, was an interesting example of how language is increasingly formed, shaped, and shared within online communities. ‘Brain rot’ speaks to one of the perceived dangers of virtual life, and how we are using our free time. It feels like a rightful next chapter in the cultural conversation about humanity and technology. It’s not surprising that so many voters embraced the term, endorsing it as our choice this year.</em></p>



<p><em>“I find it fascinating that the term ‘brain rot’ has been adopted by Gen Z and Gen Alpha, those communities largely responsible for the use and creation of the digital content the term refers to. These communities have amplified the expression through social media channels, the very place said to cause ‘brain rot’. It demonstrates a somewhat cheeky self-awareness in the younger generations about the harmful impact of social media that they’ve inherited.”</em></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Throughout my career, I have found git submodules to be a pain. Because I did not understand them, I kept getting myself into frustrating situations.</p>

<p>So, I finally sat down and learned how git tracks submodules. Turns out, it’s not complex at all. It’s just different from how git tracks regular files. It’s just one more thing you have to learn.</p>

<p>In this article, I’ll explain exactly what I needed to know in order to work with submodules without inflicting self-damage.</p>

<p>(This article doesn’t discuss whether submodules are good/bad, or if you should use them or not – a valid discussion, but out of scope.)</p>

<h2 id="the-lay-of-the-land">The lay of the land</h2>
<p>This article will make more sense if we use concrete examples.</p>

<p>Allow me to describe a toy webapp we’re building. Call this repo <code>webapp</code>. Here are the contents of the repo.</p>
<div><pre><code>$ [/webapp] ls

.git/
README.md
tests/
</code></pre></div>

<p>Say you want to import some library. It lives in its own repo, <code>library</code>.</p>
<div><pre><code>$ [/library] ls

.git/
README.md
my_cool_functions.py
</code></pre></div>

<p>Shortly, I’ll explain how submodules work. But, first, let me dramatically re-enact something that has happened to me multiple times. This is what it looks like to use submodules without understanding them.</p>

<h2 id="a-day-in-the-life-of-someone-who-doesnt-understand-submodules">A day in the life of someone who doesn’t understand submodules</h2>
<p>Ah, 2012. What a time to be a “full-stack engineer”! I wonder what contributions await me on the main branch!</p>

<p>(For the sake of readability, in this article, instead of using real commit SHAs, I’m going to use fake descriptive ones.)</p>

<p>Let’s pull to make sure I’m up-to-date with the remote.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>[</span>/webapp] git pull

<p>After I pull, I like to confirm that my working tree is clean.</p>

<div><pre><code>$ [/webapp] git st

## main...origin/main
 M library
</code></pre></div>

<p>What’s this? I’ve made modifications to <code>library</code>? I never touch that directory.</p>

<p>It’s weird that I’ve modified a <em>directory</em>. Usually git just says I’ve modified a specific <em>file</em>.</p>

<p>Well, what does <code>git diff</code> have to say?</p>

<div><pre><code>$ [/webapp] git diff

diff --git a/library b/library

--- a/library

-Subproject commit library_new_commit_sha
+Subproject commit library_old_commit_sha
</code></pre></div>

<p>Apparently, I deleted <code>Subproject commit library_new_commit_sha</code> and added <code>Subproject commit library_old_commit_sha</code>.</p>

<p>Surely I didn’t do that. That’s weird, let me do a hard reset.</p>

<div><pre><code>$ [/webapp] git reset --hard origin/main

HEAD is now at webapp_new_commit_sha point submodule to newest commit
</code></pre></div>

<p>Did it make the git diff go away?</p>

<div><pre><code>$ [/webapp] git st

## main...origin/main
 M library
</code></pre></div>

<p>It did not! I am really confused now!</p>

<p>Well, the usual way I make local modifications go away is <code>git reset --hard</code>, and that didn’t work. The other way is to commit the changes.</p>

<p>(Sometimes, people don’t even notice the diff above, and accidentally do this.)</p>

<p><strong>My future self</strong>: <em>Don’t do it! If you <code>git add</code> that change, you’ll be rolling back a change someone else made!</em></p>

<p>What’s going on, of course, is that <code>library</code> is a submodule, and you have to do special stuff to deal with them.</p>

<p>Let’s dive into submodules.</p>

<h2 id="whats-a-submodule">What’s a submodule?</h2>
<p>A git submodule is a full repo that’s been nested inside another repo. Any repo can be a submodule of another.</p>

<p>So, <code>library</code> is a full repo that has been nested inside <code>webapp</code> as a submodule.</p>

<p>That doesn’t seem so confusing, does it? However, there are two important, and tricky, facts about submodules. These facts are why so many people trip up on submodules.</p>

<h3 id="1-a-submodule-is-always-pinned-to-a-specific-commit">1. A submodule is always pinned to a specific commit</h3>
<p>You know how package managers let you be  fuzzy when specifying a package version (“get me any version of <code>requests</code> so long as it’s 2.x.x”), or to pin an exact version (“use <code>requests</code> 2.31.0 exactly”)?</p>

<p>Submodules can <em>only</em> be pinned to a specific commit. This is because a submodule isn’t a package; it’s code that you have embedded in another repo, and git wants you to be precise.</p>

<p>We’ll see exactly how this pinning works shortly.</p>

<h3 id="2-git-does-not-automatically-download-or-update-submodules">2. git does not automatically download or update submodules</h3>
<p>If you clone <code>webapp</code> afresh, git <em>will not</em> automatically download <code>library</code> for you (unless you clone using <code>git clone --recursive</code>)</p>

<p>Similarly, if a collaborator pins <code>webapp</code> to a new commit of <code>library</code>, and you <code>git pull</code> <code>webapp</code>, git <em>will not</em> automatically update <code>library</code> for you.</p>

<p>This is actually what’s happening in the dramatic re-enactment above. Let me rewind a little bit to show what happened.</p>

<h2 id="what-happens-when-someone-updates-a-submodule">What happens when someone updates a submodule?</h2>
<p>In the beginning, <code>webapp</code> pointed to <code>webapp_old_commit_sha</code>, which pinned <code>library</code> to <code>library_old_commit_sha</code>.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.cyberdemon.org/assets/submodules1.png" alt="Hand-drawn diagram of two git repositories, webapp and library. It shows that the old_sha commit of the webapp repo points to the old_sha commit of the library repo. The old_sha commit of the webapp repo has a purple border around it, saying 'HEAD'. The old_sha commit of the library repo also has a purple border around it, saying 'HEAD'."></p>

<p>(Think of <code>HEAD</code> as “current commit”.)</p>

<p>Then, my collaborator made changes to <code>library</code>. Remember, <code>library</code> is a full repo, so after they did their work, they did what you always do after you make changes: they committed and pushed the new commit, <code>library_new_commit_sha</code>.</p>

<p>They weren’t done, though. <code>webapp</code> must point to a specific commit of <code>library</code>, so in order to use <code>library_new_commit_sha</code>, my collaborator then pushed a new commit to <code>webpapp</code>, <code>webapp_new_commit_sha</code>, which points to <code>library_new_commit_sha</code>.</p>

<p>Here’s the thing, though! <em>git does not automatically update submodules</em>, so <code>library</code> still points to <code>library_old_commit_sha</code>.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.cyberdemon.org/assets/submodules2.png" alt="Hand-drawn diagram of two git repositories, webapp and library. It shows that the old_sha commit of the webapp repo points to the old_sha commit of the library repo. The new_sha commit of the webapp repo points to the new_sha of the library repo. The new_sha commit of the webapp repo has a purple border around it, saying 'HEAD'. The old_sha commit of the library repo has a purple border around it, saying 'HEAD'. A red arrow points to the purple border around old_sha in the library repo. The red arrow is linked to a speech bubble which says, 'library still points at old_sha!'"></p>

<p>I think this will be a lot less confusing if we look at exactly how git tracks submodules.</p>

<p>The latest commit of <code>webapp</code> is <code>webapp_new_commit_sha</code>. Let’s inspect that commit.</p>

<p>A commit is just a file on disk. However, it’s optimized/compressed, so we use a built-in utility to view it. Here’s what the commit stores.</p>
<div><pre><code>$ [/webapp] git cat-file -p `webapp_new_commit_sha`

tree 92018fc6ac6e71ea3dfb57e2fab9d3fe23b6fdf4
parent webapp_old_commit_sha

committer Dmitry Mazin &lt;dm@cyberdemon.org&gt; 1708717288 +0000

point submodule to newest commit
</code></pre></div>

<p>What we care about is <code>tree 92018fc6ac6e71ea3dfb57e2fab9d3fe23b6fdf4</code>. The <em>tree</em> object represents the directory listing of your repo. When you think trees, think directories.</p>

<p>Let’s inspect the tree object.</p>
<div><pre><code>$ [/webapp] git cat-file -p 92018fc6ac6e71ea3dfb57e2fab9d3fe23b6fdf4

100644 blob     6feaf03c7a9c805ff734a90a245a417e6a6c099b    .gitmodules
100644 blob     a72832b303c4d4f1833da79fc8a566e8a0eb37af    README.md
040000 tree     a425c23ded8892f901dee7fbc8d4c5714bdcc40d    tests
160000 commit   library_new_commit_sha                      library
</code></pre></div>

<p>Note how <code>tests</code> is a <code>tree</code> (just like directories can hold directories, trees can point to trees).</p>

<p>But <code>library</code> is a… commit?!</p>

<div><pre><code>160000 commit   library_new_commit_sha                      library
</code></pre></div>

<p>That weirdness, right there, is precisely how git knows <code>library</code> points to <code>library_new_commit_sha</code>.</p>

<p>In other words, the way git implements submodules is by doing a weird trick where a tree points to a <em>commit</em>.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.cyberdemon.org/assets/submodules3.png" alt="Hand-drawn diagram showing the text 'webapp_new_commit_sha' connected, via arrow, to 'tree a425' which is itself connected, via arrow, to 'library_new_commit_sha'"></p>

<p>Let’s use this knowledge to understand the <code>git diff</code> from earlier.</p>

<h2 id="understanding-git-diff">Understanding git diff</h2>
<p>Here’s the diff again.</p>

<div><pre><code>$ [/webapp] git diff

diff --git a/library b/library
index library_old_commit_sha..library_new_commit_sha 160000
--- a/library
+++ b/library
@@ -1 +1 @@
-Subproject commit library_new_commit_sha
+Subproject commit library_old_commit_sha
</code></pre></div>

<p>It’s confusing that it’s saying that <strong>I</strong> modified <code>library</code>. I didn’t modify it, someone else did!</p>

<p>Usually, I think of <code>git diff</code> as “here are the changes I have made”. But this isn’t exactly correct.</p>

<p>When you invoke <code>git diff</code>, you’re asking git to tell you the difference between your working tree (that is, your unstaged, uncommitted local changes) and the most recent commit of your branch (<code>webapp_new_commit_sha</code>).</p>

<p>When you look at it that way, the above git diff starts to make sense. In <code>webapp_new_commit_sha</code>, <code>library</code> points to <code>library_new_commit_sha</code>, but in our working tree, <code>library</code> still points to <code>library_old_commit_sha</code>.</p>

<p>git has no idea which change happened first. It only knows that your working tree is different from the commit. And, so it tells you: <code>library_new_commit_sha</code> is saying that library should point to <code>library_new_commit_sha</code>, but it doesn’t.</p>

<p>Understanding the above took the pain out of submodules for me. However, I still haven’t told you how to update a submodule.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-update-a-submodule">How to update a submodule</h2>
<p>We now understand that we need to point <code>library</code> to <code>library_new_commit_sha</code>. How?</p>

<p>Because <code>library</code> is a full repo, I could just <code>cd</code> into it and literally check out that commit:</p>
<div><pre><code>$ [/webapp] cd library

$ [/library] git checkout library_new_commit_sha

Previous HEAD position was library_old_commit_sha README
HEAD is now at library_new_commit_sha add some cool functions
</code></pre></div>

<p>If we go back into <code>webapp</code>, we’ll see that <code>git st</code>/<code>git diff</code> finally look clean.</p>

<div><pre><code>$ [/webapp] git st

## main...origin/main
# (no output)

$ [/webapp] git diff

# (no output)
</code></pre></div>

<p>However, you don’t actually need to do the above.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-really-update-a-submodule">How to really update a submodule</h2>
<p>From <code>webapp</code>, we can invoke <code>git submodule update</code>. This updates <em>all</em> of a repo’s submodules.</p>

<p>People often use certain flags with <code>git submodule update</code>, so let’s understand them.</p>

<h3 id="initialize-a-submodule-git-submodule-update---init">Initialize a submodule: <code>git submodule update --init</code></h3>
<p>Remember how I said that if you <code>git clone webapp</code>, git won’t actually download the contents of <code>library</code>?</p>

<p>What you’re supposed to do is, after cloning webapp:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Run <code>git submodule init</code> to initialize the submodules. This doesn’t actually download them, though 🙃️.</li>
  <li>Run <code>git submodule update</code> to actually pull the submodules.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is kind of a silly dance, so git lets you just do <code>git submodule update --init</code>. This initializes any submodules and updates them in one step. I <em>always</em> pass <code>--init</code> because there is no harm in doing so.</p>

<p>You can skip <code>--init</code> by cloning with <code>--recursive</code>: that is, you could have done <code>git clone webapp --recursive</code>. I never remember to do this, though. Plus, you end up having to do <code>git update submodule</code> anyway.</p>

<h3 id="update-submodules-of-submodules-git-submodule-update---recursive">Update submodules of submodules: <code>git submodule update --recursive</code></h3>
<p>Submodules can nest other submodules. Yeah.</p>

<p>So, to take care of updating submodules <em>all the way down</em>, pretty much just always pass <code>--recursive</code> to <code>git submodule update</code>.</p>

<p><strong>So, the command I always end up using is <code>git submodule update --init --recursive</code>.</strong></p>

<h3 id="make-git-automatically-update-submodules-git-config-submodulerecurse-true">Make git automatically update submodules: <code>git config submodule.recurse true</code></h3>
<p><code>submodule.recurse true</code> makes submodules automatically update when you <code>git pull</code>, <code>git checkout</code>, etc. In other words, it makes submodules automatically point to whatever they are supposed to point to. It’s only available in git 2.14 and newer.</p>

<p>That makes running <code>git submodule update</code> unnecessary.</p>

<p>I don’t use this setting, because I’m not sure if there are drawbacks or not. Plus, I work on submodules enough that I think it could cause conflicts. Let me know if you’re aware of shortcomings, or if you’ve been using this setting forever without issue!</p>

<p>This setting definitely does <em>not</em> apply to <code>git clone</code>. So you still need to do <code>git clone --recursive</code> or init/update submodules using the commands above.</p>

<h2 id="recap">Recap</h2>
<p>I think I can summarize submodules pretty simply.</p>

<p>It’s possible to embed a repo within another repo. This is called a submodule.</p>

<p>Each commit of the outer repo always specifies an <em>exact</em> commit that submodule. This is done by the <code>outer commit -&gt; tree -&gt; submodule commit</code> link.</p>

<p>When you check out commits, git doesn’t automatically update submodules for you. You have to do that using <code>git submodule update</code>.</p>

<p>And there we have it!</p>

<h2 id="further-topics-in-submodules">Further topics in submodules</h2>
<p>The above is enough to hopefully take the confusion out of submodules. However, there are more common commands and configs that I’d like to explain.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-add-a-submodule-git-submodule-add">How to add a submodule: <code>git submodule add</code></h3>
<p>Let’s say that I start <code>webapp</code> fresh, and I have not added <code>library</code> to it yet.</p>

<p>To add <code>library</code>, I’d do <code>git submodule add https://github.com/dmazin/library.git library</code>.</p>

<p>This will add (or update) the <code>.gitmodules</code> file of <code>webapp</code>, download <code>library</code>, and point <code>webapp</code> at the latest commit of <code>library</code>.</p>

<p>Remember, this actually modifies <code>webapp</code>, so you need to commit after that. But you thankfully don’t need to do <code>git submodule update</code> after doing <code>git submodule add</code> or anything.</p>

<h3 id="what-do-i-do-after-ive-modified-a-submodule">What do I do after I’ve modified a submodule?</h3>
<p>Remember that <code>library</code> is a full repo, so if you want to make changes to it, you can. Just make changes and commit them to the main branch.</p>

<p>But how do you make <code>webapp</code> point at the new commit? There are a couple ways.</p>

<h4 id="without-a-command">Without a command</h4>
<p>You can go into <code>webapp</code>, then <code>cd library</code>, and just do <code>git pull</code> in there. When you <code>cd</code> back into <code>webapp</code>, if you <code>git diff</code> you’ll see that <code>webapp</code> points to the newest branch of <code>library</code>. You can commit that.</p>

<h4 id="using-git-submodule-update---remote----library">Using <code>git submodule update --remote -- library</code></h4>
<p>This tells git “make the submodule point to the latest remote commit”. Since you have pushed the latest commit of library to library’s remote, this will make <code>webapp</code> point to that commit.</p>

<p>But note that <code>git submodule update --remote</code> will do this to <em>all</em> your submodules. You likely do not want that.</p>

<p>For that reason, you have to do <code>git submodule update --remote -- library</code> to limit this to library only. (If you’re thrown off by the fact that you have to do <code>-- library</code> – yeah, it’s kind of weird.)</p>

<p>Because <code>--remote</code> might accidentally update all the submodules, honestly I usually do the “without a command” method.</p>

<h3 id="the-gitmodules-file">The .gitmodules file</h3>
<p>How does git know where to download <code>library</code> from?
git uses a file called <code>.gitmodules</code> to track the basic facts of a submodule, like the repo URL.</p>

<div><pre><code>$ [/webapp] cat .gitmodules

[submodule "library"]
        path = library
        url = https://github.com/dmazin/library.git
</code></pre></div>

<p>The nice thing about <code>.gitmodules</code> is that it’s a regular file, tracked the regular way in git. That makes it not confusing.</p>

<p>(What I don’t understand is, why git didn’t just put the submodule commit right in .gitmodules? The commits of <code>webapp</code> would <em>still</em> be able to specify exact commits of <code>library</code> to use. What am I missing?)</p>

<h3 id="making-submodules-use-branches-other-than-main">Making submodules use branches other than main</h3>
<p>If you want to, you can make <code>library</code> track whatever branch you want. Otherwise, it defaults to whatever the “main” branch is.</p>

<div><pre><code>[submodule "library"]
        path = library
        url = https://github.com/dmazin/library.git
        branch = staging
</code></pre></div>

<p>Thanks for reading!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
<p>The message appears in <code>sudo</code>’s revision control (in its current guise) <a href="https://www.sudo.ws/repos/sudo/rev/c101e9572d7f" rel="noreferrer">in June 1993</a>, in the University of Colorado version of <code>sudo</code>, in a slightly shorter form:</p>

<pre><code>We trust you have received the usual lecture from the local Systems
Administrator. It usually boils down to these two things:

        #1) Respect the privacy of others.
        #2) Think before you type.
</code></pre>

<p>This initial commit also introduced <code>sudo</code>’s <a href="https://xkcd.com/838/" rel="noreferrer">other famous message</a>, “This incident will be reported.”</p>

<p>The author of the commit is Todd C. Miller, the maintainer of CU <code>sudo</code> (now plain <code>sudo</code>, still maintained by Todd), but the source code predates the commit; and while the source mentions Jeff Nieusma, the messages <a href="https://www.quora.com/Who-wrote-the-message-that-comes-up-when-you-use-sudo-for-the-first-time/answer/Brian-Bi" rel="noreferrer">predate his involvement too</a> and their author is presumably either Bob Coggeshall or Evi Nemeth (see also “<a href="https://www.sudo.ws/history.html" rel="noreferrer">A Brief History of Sudo</a>”). The source history doesn’t suggest any particular background to the change. The message is typical of warning messages which were displayed when logging in to academic systems at the time.</p>

<p><code>sudo</code> was published in the <em>UNIX System Administration Handbook</em>, written by  Evi Nemeth, Garth Snyder, and Scott Seebass; <a href="https://archive.org/details/isbn_0139334416/page/468" rel="noreferrer">the version published in the first edition</a> doesn’t include a warning in the program itself, but the authors mention that users who were granted <code>sudo</code> access were sent a (lengthy) email reminding them of the responsibilities associated with that privilege.</p>

<p>The third item was <a href="https://www.sudo.ws/repos/sudo/rev/ebd5a76ccd7e" rel="noreferrer">added in January 2004</a>, with a more interesting commit message:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Add Stan Lee / Uncle Ben quote to the lecture from RedHat</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Said quote (which, as <a href="https://retrocomputing.stackexchange.com/users/4147/tommy">Tommy</a> <a href="https://retrocomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/12521/when-was-the-famous-sudo-warning-introduced-under-what-background-by-whom#comment39312_12522">points out</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/With_great_power_comes_great_responsibility" rel="noreferrer">wasn’t coined by Stan Lee</a>) was added to Red Hat’s <code>sudo</code> package as a patch on top of version 1.6.6, in June 2002.</p>

<hr>

<p>Historical artifacts: <a href="https://archive.org/download/usenet-net/net.sources.mbox.zip" rel="noreferrer">these <code>net.sources</code> archives</a> contain two versions of <code>sudo</code>, posted by Cliff Spencer and Don Gworek in December 1985 (also available in the UTZOO tapes); <a href="https://archive.org/download/utzoo-wiseman-usenet-archive/news061f1.tgz" rel="noreferrer">this <code>unix-pc.sources</code> archive</a> contains a different implementation by Lenny Tropiano.</p>

	<li><strong>Xi’an Scout Unlocked</strong>! The Khartu is the light attack craft of the Xi’An military. Contrary to Human ship design, the Khartu doesn’t have a traditional main thruster, instead featuring an array of maneuvering thrusters on articulated rigs. This design allows for incredible agility, making them the bane of <span>UEE</span> pilots, who bestowed the nickname ‘Quark’ because when all of the thrusters are firing, the ship looks like a spark flying through space. The Xi’an Aopoa corporation also manufactures an export model, the Khartu-al, for sale to human civilians as a dedicated scout/explorer. The export model features the same Xi’an maneuvering rig, but control surfaces modified for human use and a more limited armament. (Designer: Aopoa)</li>

	<li><strong>Enhanced Alpha</strong> – We will use additional funding to build a wider alpha test than we had originally intended for the first phase of Star Citizen’s launch. The initial plan was to first launch servers in North America and then expand to areas such as Europe and Australia to decrease latency in these areas, perfecting the game as we improve the experience around the world. This funding will allow us to invest in a wider infrastructure for our early testing, spinning up remote servers earlier. Hitting this goal will also allow us to increase the number of remaining alpha slots. Extra alpha slots not only means more Star Citizens will travel the ‘verse at launch, but that we will receive more feedback and more stress testing. This in turn will allow us to better balance and enhance the Star Citizen experience!</li>

	<li><strong>Drake Herald</strong> – Knowledge is power, and one of the most valuable commodities is pure information: the 1s and 0s behind everything from <span>UEC</span> ledgers to Citizenship ratings. Whether it’s colonists struggling to stay in contact with the <span>UEE</span>’s central worlds or criminals trading in illicit data, there will always be a need to securely move data. The Drake Herald, small, armored ship, is designed to fit that need and safely get that information from Point A to Point B. Featuring a powerful central engine (for high speed transit and generating the power needed for effective data encryption/containment), advanced encryption software and an armored computer core, the Herald is unique among personal spacecraft in that it is designed to be easily ‘cleaned’ when in danger of capture. The Herald includes an array of heavy duty internal options for data protection, including redundant power subsystems and <span>EMP</span> shielding, and a high-powered broadcast array for data transmission.</li>

	<li><strong>Cano System</strong> is home to a G-Type Main Sequence Star that’s almost identical to Earth’s. Of the four planets in the system, only one is inhabited: Carteyna. Located on the edge of habitable zone, Carteyna is a classic waterworld. Fortunately, its planetary axis constantly keeps the northern hemisphere away from the sun, which allowed for the water to freeze into the landmasses used as the initial landing zones in 2587. Multiple attempts have been made to try to convert the thick atmosphere into something breathable, but the process never seemed to stick. In fact, over the years, every time there’s a new technological development in geo-engineering, they test it out here on Carteyna only to yield the same result. Almost fifty years ago, scientists discovered microscopic organisms in the very early phases of life in the depths of the oceans. This caused a massive uproar throughout the <span>UEE</span> at the prospect that they had been attempting to terraform a developing world. Carteyna was immediately placed under the Fair Chance Act. Unfortunately, Humans had been living here for almost over three hundred years and the families that had been here for generations felt that they had earned rights as residents. After years of debate in the political and scientific community, the population was allowed to stay, but only under certain conditions: future terraforming attempts have been outlawed and the Human population has been consolidated to a single arcology to minimize their impact on their environment and the development of whatever species is growing in the deep.</li>

The object, once thought to be a single massive star, is actually a trinary star consisting of two white dwarfs and an active pulsar orbiting one another. Because of the complex gravitic factors at work, it is now believed that a jump point leading to the system likely exists in or near explored human space. Beyond the bizarre stellar makeup, the composition of the system is all but unknown. Could planets exist in this carefully balanced web? What else might have been drawn there?

Even the most jaded NavJumpers can’t help entertaining the possibilities for scientific understanding or new species or even a new home that could await them on the other side of a new jump point. The discovery of Kabal was certainly something new. By all outward appearances, the system seemed empty. It was only during when a <span>UEE</span> Surveying team began to assess Kabal <span>III</span>, did they find something disturbing; old uninhabited Tevarin cities. How could an entire Tevarin system escape detection all these years? Did the Tevarin that were assimilated into the <span>UEE</span> know about it? How was it kept a secret? The questions multiplied when a detachment of Marines, sent to secure the planet ended up discovering a cache of old Tevarin war machines. Among the rows and rows of weapons, they made an even more disturbing discovery; some of the technology was made in the last ten years…</li>

	<li><strong>Oretani System</strong> – Oretani was just one of many systems that were being discovered during the rapid Expansion era of the 25th century. The surveyors noticed nothing in the system’s six worlds of immediate importance. Only one planet seemed to be a viable candidate for terraforming. The terraforming Corp that won the bid sent a mid-level team (and their families) into the system to start processing when the only jump point into the system collapsed. Scientists scrambled to figure out a solution, but it was the first time an incident like this had occurred. As years stretched into decades, people studied the area around the former jump point, hoping for a sign that it had reopened, but after time they gave up. After all this time, Oretani is only ever debated among select number of historians. Most believe that without support, the initial terraformers probably died out, but no one really knows what to expect on the other side if that jump point ever reopens.</li>

	<li><strong>Anvil Aerospace Crucible</strong> – A so-called “flying toolbox,” the Crucible is the ship you want on your side when you suffer an asteroid collision or survive a pirate attack! Structurally, the Crucible consists of a cockpit, drive unit and workshop. The Crucible’s workshop is versatile: it can be used as a base for conducting <span>EVA</span> repairs (complete with requisite tool storage) or it can use magnetic grapplers to attach directly to a ship hull. In this situation, the workshop actually opens to space and allows a repair crew direct access to a damaged ship. The workshop can either maintain artificial gravity or allow for zero-g repair operations, depending on the needs of the mission. The Crucible’s cockpit is also outfitted with an array of repair tools, including dual purpose mounts that can exchange weapons for tractor beams and remote manipulator arms. The Crucible is also part of a larger planned repair system. For larger project, independent sections of support struts and drive units, called the Miller <span>ERS</span> (External Repair Structure), can be locked together to form a sort of scaffolding around a damaged starship, the next best thing to an orbital drydock. A standard <span>ERS</span> unit includes a small drive, thrusters, magnetic attach points and modular hardpoints for mounting tractor beams, repair tools or weapons. <span>ERS</span> segments each have a code defining their shape (P1 = Straight section, P2= Left turn, P3 = Right turn, etc.) with the multiple layouts allowing extensive zero-gravity construction as necessary. In the case of damaged capital ships, like the Navy’s Bengal carriers, hundreds of <span>ERS</span> units might be formed into a latticework serviced by a dozen or more Crucibles.</li>

	<li><strong>Aegis Vanguard-class Twin-Engine Deep Space Fighter</strong> – Strike hard from a distance! The Vanguard, a recent design from Aegis, has quickly become Earth’s premier deep space fighter. Deep space fighters are typically used to pursue engagements in outlying areas when support from a carrier is not available. Vanguards are usually flown by ground- and station-based naval forces, and are widely used by militia squadrons. Specifically designed to operate from planetary bases and engage targets up to a star system’s distance, the fighter trades some maneuverability for an extended supply of fuel and munitions as well as basic survival accommodations for a pilot and radar operator. The Vanguard’s <span>RIO</span> operates a turret, the ship’s missile loadout (optionally) and its highly advanced sensor suite. This distinct scanning array gives the ‘Dog a particular advantage when fighting in and around an obstacle such as an asteroid field or nebula! Finally, the Vanguard is known to be an extraordinarily sturdy spacecraft, with multiple backup systems not commonly found in single-seat ships; stories of Vanguards limping back to base with a single engine and half their fuselage exposed to vacuum have become common as the battle against the Vanduul has heated up.</li>

With the recent discovery of the lost Tevarin planet in Kabal System, Espera’s engineers were given unmitigated access to examine the preserved ships found in several of the caches, before meticulously recreating the design choices. The Prowler’s effectiveness as a rapid personnel deployment vehicle was mainly due to its silence. The boarding was constructed using a variety of techniques to minimize its signatures and get close to unsuspecting vessels before quickly deploying their boarders via <span>EVA</span>. With the updated Prowler model, you will find the perfect fusion of two culture: the elegance and effectiveness of the Tevarin war machine combined with the reliability of modern <span>UEE</span> technology. (While lacking some of the upgrades of the modern version, vintage Tevarin-built Prowlers restored for modern spaceflight are prized by owners lucky enough to locate them.)</li>

This new goal, a massive undertaking, is going to be of interest. We are looking to overhaul any suitable ships (including the Cutlass, Avenger, Retaliator and Redeemer) to allow many modular components to be available as swap-outs. For example: if you have purchased a Redeemer, then using the new system you would have a variety of new modules available to refit the ship, internal and external, to suit your play requirements. If you wanted to make it a Bounty Hunter ship, you could buy a “Stasis Chamber module” for the lower deck and you would be able to capture and store fugitives to be delivered for their bounties at your leisure. You could configure the upper deck to be outfitted with a “long range communication suite” allowing you to keep in touch with your “Infoagent” even when in deep space. Fed up of Bounty hunting? Swap in a larger cargo module in the lower deck to make that profitable run you have been planning for a while, or add the Explorer Module with deployable vehicle for some planetside recon. Manufacturers will still be offering pre-configured variants, but should you be looking to adapt a hull to suit a certain task then your ship has come in (and is now ready for modification!)</li>

<h2>
<a name="differences"></a>How is college mathematics different from high
school math?</h2>
In high school mathematics much of your time was spent learning algorithms
and manipulative techniques which you were expected to be able to apply
in certain well-defined situations. This limitation of material and expectations
for your performance has probably led you to develop study habits which
were appropriate for high school mathematics but may be insufficient for
college mathematics. This can be a source of much frustration for you and
for your instructors. My object in writing this essay is to help ease this
frustration by describing some study strategies which may help you channel
your abilities and energies in a productive direction.
<p>The first major difference between high school mathematics and college
mathematics is the amount of emphasis on what the student would call theory---the
precise statement of definitions and theorems and the logical processes
by which those theorems are established. To the mathematician this material,
together with examples showing why the definitions chosen are the correct
ones and how the theorems can be put to practical use, is the essence of
mathematics. A course description using the term ``rigorous'' indicates
that considerable care will be taken in the statement of definitions and
theorems and that proofs will be given for the theorems rather than just
plausibility arguments. If your approach is to go straight to the problems
with only cursory reading of the ``theory'' this aspect of college math
will cause difficulties for you.
</p><p>The second difference between college mathematics and high school mathematics
comes in the approach to technique and application problems. In high school
you studied one technique at a time---a problem set or unit might deal,
for instance, with solution of quadratic equations by factoring or by use
of the quadratic formula, but it wouldn't teach both and ask you to decide
which was the better approach for particular problems. To be sure, you
learn individual techniques well in this approach, but you are unlikely
to learn how to attack a problem for which you are not told what technique
to use or which is not exactly like other applications you have seen. College
mathematics will offer many techniques which can be applied for a particular
type of problem---individual problems may have many possible approaches,
some of which work better than others. Part of the task of working such
a problem lies in choosing the appropriate technique. This requires study
habits which develop judgment as well as technical competence.
</p><p>We will take up the problem of how to study mathematics by considering
specific aspects individually. First we will consider definitions---first
because they form the foundation for any part of mathematics and are essential
for understanding theorems. Then we'll take up theorems, lemmas, propositions,
and corollaries and how to study the way the subject fits together. The
subject of proofs, how to decipher them and why we need them, comes next.
And finally, we will discuss development of judgment in problem solving.
<br><a href="#top">To contents</a>
</p><h2>
<a name="definitions"></a>What should you do with a definition?</h2>
A definition in mathematics is a precise statement delineating and naming
a concept by relating it to previously defined concepts or such undefined
concepts as ``number'' or ``set.'' Careful definitions are necessary so
that we know exactly what we are talking about. Unfortunately, for many
of the concepts in undergraduate mathematics the definition is rather difficult
to understand, so often at low levels an intuitive feeling for the meaning
of a term is all that is given or required. This intuitive feeling, while
necessary, is not sufficient at the college level. This means that you
need to grapple with and master the formal statement of definitions and
their meanings. How do you do it?
<h3>
Step 1. Make sure you understand what the definition says.</h3>
This sounds obvious, but it can cause some difficulties, particularly for
definitions with complicated logical structure (like the definition of
the limit of a function at a point in its domain). Definitions are not
a good place to practice your speed reading. In general there are no wasted
words or extraneous symbols in established definitions and the easily overlooked
small words like <i>and, or, if ... then, for all,</i> and <i>there is</i>
are your clues to the logical structure of the definition.
<p>First determine what general class of things is being talked about:
the definition of a polynomial describes a particular kind of algebraic
expression; the definition of a continuous function specifies a kind of
function; the definition of a basis for a vector space specifies a kind
of set of vectors.
</p><p>Next decipher the logical structure of the definition. What do you have
to do to show that a member of your general class of things satisfies the
definition: what do you have to do to show that an expression is a polynomial,
or a function is continuous, or a set of vectors is a basis.
</p><h3>
Step 2. Determine the scope of the definition with examples.</h3>
Most definitions have standard examples that go with them. While these
are useful, they may lead you to expect that all examples look like the
standard example. To understand a definition you should make up your own
examples: find three examples that do satisfy the definition but which
are as different as possible from each other; find two examples of items
in the general class described by the definition which do not satisfy it.
Prove that your five examples do what you think they do---such proofs are
usually short, follow the structure of the definition quite closely, and
help immensely in understanding the definition. These examples should be
neatly written up so that you can refer to them later. Your own examples
will have more meaning for you than mine or the book's when it comes time
to review.
<h3>
Step 3. Memorize the exact wording of the definition.</h3>
This step may sound petty, but the use of definitions demands knowledge
of exactly what they say. For this reason you can count on being asked
for the statement of any definition on an exam. The importance of precise
wording should have been made clear by your examples in step 2 and it certainly
is essential in the proof of theorems.
<p>Solid knowledge of definitions is more than a third of the battle. Time
spent gaining such knowledge is not wasted.
<br><a href="#top">To contents</a>
</p><h2>
<a name="theorems"></a>Theorems, Propositions, Lemmas, and Corollaries</h2>
Occasionally definitions are useful in and of themselves, but usually we
need to relate them to each other and to general problems before they can
be made to work for us. This is the role of theory.
<p>The relative importance and the intended use of statements which are
then proved is hinted at by the names they are given. Theorems are usually
important results which show how to make concepts solve problems or give
major insights into the workings of the subject. They often have involved
and deep proofs. Propositions give smaller results, often relating different
definitions to each other or giving alternate forms of the definition.
Proofs of propositions are usually less complex than the proofs of theorems.
Lemmas are technical results used in the proofs of theorems. Often it is
found that the same trick is used several times in one proof or in the
proof of several theorems. When this happens the trick is isolated in a
lemma so that its proof will not have to be repeated every time it is used.
This often makes the proofs of theorems shorter and, one hopes, more lucid.
Corollaries are immediate consequences of theorems either giving special
cases or highlighting the interest and importance of the theorem. If the
author or instructor has been careful (not all authors and instructors
are) with the use of these labels, they will help you figure out what is
important in the subject.
</p><p>The steps to understanding and mastering a theorem follow the same lines
as the steps to understanding a definition.
</p><h3>
Step 1. Make sure you understand what the theorem says.</h3>
Part of this is a vocabulary problem. Theorems use terms which have been
given precise meanings by definitions. So you may need to review the definitions
to understand the words in a theorem.
<p>Next you need to understand the logical structure of the theorem: what
are the hypotheses and what are the conclusions? If you have several hypotheses,
must they all be satisfied (that is, do they have an&nbsp; <b><i>and</i></b>
between them) or will it suffice to have only some of them (an&nbsp; <b><i>or</i></b>
between them)? In most cases theorems require that all of their hypotheses
be satisfied. A theorem tells you nothing about a situation which does
not satisfy the hypothesis. The hypothesis tells you what you must show
in order for the theorem to apply to a particular case. The conclusions
tell you what the theorem tells you about each case.
</p><h3>
Step 2. Determine how the theorem is used.</h3>
This involves finding examples of problems for which the theorem gives
a technique for finding the answer. Make up your own problems and show
how the theorem helps with them. Again writing this down will help solidify
the theorem in your mind and make it easier to review.
<h3>
Step 3. Find out what the hypotheses are doing there.</h3>
This is a little tricky and is probably more important in advanced courses
than in beginning courses. What you do is find examples (either your own
or someone else's) to show that if individual hypotheses are omitted the
conclusion can be false. For instance, in calculus many theorems have a
hypothesis that the functions involved be continuous; why does the theorem
fail if this hypothesis is left out? Usually an example will make this
clearer than an examination of how the hypothesis was used in the proof
will. A catalog of such examples can be very useful. See for instance the
books Counterexamples in Analysis and Counterexamples in Topology.
<p>In some cases a hypothesis is included just because it makes an otherwise
complicated proof easy. This means that you may not be able to find examples
which illustrate that each hypothesis is essential.
</p><h3>
Step 4. Memorize the statement of the theorem.</h3>
If you are going to use a theorem you need to know exactly what it says.
Pay particular attention to hypotheses. We will take up proofs later, but
for now let me note that it is not a good idea to try to memorize the proof
of a theorem. What you want to do is understand the proof well enough that
you can prove the theorem yourself.

<h2>
<a name="fit"></a>Fitting the subject together</h2>
Mathematics is not a collection of miscellaneous techniques but rather
a way of thinking---a unified subject. Part of the task of studying mathematics
is getting the various definitions and theorems properly related to each
other. This is particularly important at the end of a course, but it will
help you make sense of the content and organization of a subject if you
keep the overall organization in mind as you go along. There are two techniques
I know of which help with this process: working backwards and definition-theorem
outlines.
<h3>
Step 1. Working backwards</h3>
In general there is very little difficulty recognizing a major result when
you get to it. A good way of seeing how a subject works is to examine the
proof of a major result and see what previous results were used in it.
Then trace these results back to earlier results used to prove them. Eventually
you will work your way back to definitions (unless there are theorems given
without proof---in calculus, for instance, the proof of the intermediate
value theorem is often omitted because it requires a deeper understanding
of the real numbers than is usually available at the beginning of calculus
1). This information can be put into a sort of genealogy chart for results
which helps you see at a glance how the results fit together. It helps
to have descriptive names for your theorems and lemmas. Such a chart might
look sort of like this:
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
Mean Value Theorem
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rolle's Theorem
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Candidate Lemma
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meaning of the sign of the derivative
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Definition of derivative
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Definition of max and min
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Existence&nbsp; of&nbsp; max&nbsp; and&nbsp; min&nbsp;&nbsp; for&nbsp; continuous&nbsp; functions&nbsp; on [a, b]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Definition of max and min
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Definition of closed interval
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Least upper bound axiom
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Definition of continuity</pre>
With such a road map through the theory you should be able to tell how
you got where you are, if not where you are headed.
<h3>
Step 2. Make a definition-theorem outline.</h3>
After you have worked backwards to the definitions for each of your major
theorems in a section you should have a good idea of which results are
needed before others can be proved. Some definitions will not make sense
until certain theorems are proved (dimension of a vector space is an example:
you can't give a number a name until you know you are talking about a unique
number, and that requires a theorem). A definition theorem outline is an
arrangement of the results in an order so that each result is introduced
before it is needed in a proof. It should contain the precise statements
of all definitions and theorems and a sketch of the proof of each theorem.
A sketch of a proof will show which earlier results were used and how they
were combined. It will usually omit calculations simplifying forms of expressions
and routine checks that hypotheses are satisfied. This outline is both
a good way to start a review and a useful thing to have to refer to.
<br><a href="#top">To contents</a>
<h2>
<a name="proofs"></a>How to make sense of a proof</h2>
College level mathematics demands that the student work through (or at
least sit through) many proofs. This is often unpopular, I think largely
because it is hard work to follow a proof, hard work of an unfamiliar kind.
Proof is largely absent or at most optional in high school math; it is
neither absent nor optional in college mathematics.
<h3>
Step 1. Make sure you know what the theorem says.</h3>
If you have the hypotheses mixed up with the conclusions you will not know
what assumptions may be made nor will you know what conclusion you are
trying to reach.
<h3>
Step 2. Make a general outline of the proof.</h3>
This is what you would do in a definition theorem outline. See what the
previous results used are and find out what the basic strategy of the proof
is. On this pass through omit the details, else you miss the direction
of the road by too close examination of the bricks in the pavement.
<p>Most theorems have the form of implications: if the hypotheses are true,
then the conclusion follows. The easiest structure for a proof to use is
to assume the hypotheses and combine them, using previous results, to reach
the conclusion through a chain of implications. Some proofs use other strategies:
contrapositive argument, reductio ad absurdum, mathematical induction,
perhaps even Zorn's lemma (a form of the axiom of choice). The more complicated
kinds of proofs will need to be discussed in class.
</p><h3>
Step 3. Fill in all of the details.</h3>
Once you understand the strategy of the proof concentrate on its tactics.
Almost all expositions of proofs in undergraduate mathematics textbooks
(and all expositions at higher levels) leave out many routine steps. An
expression will be simplified without showing exactly how to get from one
line to the next. Fill in these details. A theorem will be quoted and applied
without explicitly checking all of its hypotheses. Check them. Some parts
of the proof will be outlined with the details left to the reader. Put
in those details. When you finish you should know why each step follows
from what came before. You may not see how anyone could have thought to
do the proof that way, but you should be able to see that it is correct.
<h4>
Why bother with proofs at all?</h4>
For the mathematics major this question is easy to answer---a large portion
of mathematics consists of proofs. The mathematician enjoys the logical
puzzle which must be solved to find a proof and obtains aesthetic satisfaction
from elegance in proofs. The student who wants to major in mathematics
should do so because of ability in deciphering and producing proofs and
enjoyment derived from proof well done. The major should also have skill
in solving problems and finding applications as well.
<p>But many of you will say ``I'm not a math major; I want applications
so that I can use tools from mathematics in my field'' or ``I'm just taking
this course because it's a requirement in my major and I sort of liked
math in high school.'' Why should you learn about proof?
</p><p>The applications you meet in other fields are not likely to look exactly
like the math textbook applications, which are chosen for their appeal
to a traditional audience (largely engineers) and for their representative
character. Other applications work similarly, though not exactly the same
way. This means that you need to learn how to apply the concepts in your
math courses to situations not discussed in those courses. (There is no
way that a course could discuss every possible known application: about
500 papers appear every two weeks with applications, and those are just
the applications published in the ``mathematical'' literature!) To do so
you need the best possible understanding of the mathematics you want to
apply. Certainly this means that you need to know the hypotheses of theorems
so that you don't apply them where they won't work. It is helpful to know
the proof so that you can see how to circumvent the failed hypothesis if
necessary. One of the major pitfalls of applied mathematics, particularly
as practiced by nonmathematicians, is the danger of conveniently overlooking
the assumptions of a mathematical model. (Mathematicians trying to do applied
mathematics are more likely to fall into the trap of making models which
have no relationship to reality.)
</p><p>Many applications consist of recognizing the definition of a mathematical
concept phrased in the terms of another discipline---the more familiar
you are with the definition, the more likely you are to be able to recognize
the disguised version elsewhere. The nuances of definitions are made most
clear in the proofs of propositions relating definitions and pointing out
unexpected equivalent variants, some of which may look more like a situation
in another discipline than the precise form used in your math class.
</p><p>Arguments for theory as an aid to application rest on an obvious premise:
it is much easier to apply something you understand thoroughly. This is,
however, a better argument for care in learning the statements of theorems
than it is for spending time understanding proofs. The best justification
for the inclusion of proof in math classes is more philosophical:
</p><p><b><span color="#FF0000"><span size="+2">Proof is the ultimate test of
validity in mathematics.</span></span></b><span color="#FF0000"><span size="+2"></span></span>
</p><p>Once one accepts the logical processes involved in a proof no further
observation or change in fashion will change the validity of a mathematical
result. No other discipline has such an immutable criterion for validity.
</p><p>The major benefit derived from an education is the ability to think
clearly and make considered judgment. Each discipline should teach a body
of material, appropriate modes of thought in dealing with that material,
and a means for determining the validity of the conclusions reached. A
chemistry curriculum with no lab work would be seriously deficient since
experiment is the test of validity in science. Similarly mathematics without
proof is severely deficient, indeed it is not mathematics.

</p><h2>
<a name="technique"></a>Developing technique</h2>
About a third to a half of any math course deals with technique---the process
of making theorems work for you in specific situations rather than in the
general setting in which they are usually stated. Sometimes this is fairly
easy: many proofs give explicit constructions which you follow for the
special case. In these situations the only problems are with algebraic
and trigonometric manipulations and keeping track of where you are in the
process. In other situations (technique of integration is a good example)
there are lots of approaches which might apply to a given problem and several
tricks which might be used to make the problem more tractable. For these
you need to develop judgment.
<h3>
Step 1. Read through the theorems and examples.</h3>
Some students make the whole process of learning how to do problems more
difficult by acting like it had no connection with the other material in
the course. Often problems follow a pattern which is given explicitly in
the proof of the major theorem they follow. Knowing the general pattern
in advance is easier than trying to find it by trial and error.
<h3>
Step 2. Work enough problems to master the technique.</h3>
At this stage you should work enough problems so that the single technique
which the problems illustrate is firmly in your mind. Since you have ultimate
responsibility for your education, you should take the initiative to work
enough problems for your own practice needs. This may well be more problems
than are assigned to be turned in.
<h3>
Step 3. Work a few problems in as many different ways as possible.</h3>
Too often the practice obtained in step 2 leads the student to think that
there is only one approach to each problem. Sometimes one approach is easy
and another is complicated, but often several different attacks will work
equally well. Complicated approaches give the student practice in solving
problems which take more than one step and more than one technique.
<h3>
Step 4. Make yourself a set of randomly chosen problems.</h3>
One difficulty with learning many techniques to solve a particular kind
of problem is that you have to figure out which technique to use before
you can get to work on a solution. This is exacerbated by the tendency
for problems to be grouped so that the appropriate technique to use is
the one which immediately preceded the problem set. Putting two or three
problems from each of the problem sets in a chapter on technique on 3 by
5 cards and then shuffling the cards will give you a set of problems on
which to practice deciding which technique to use.

<h2>
<a name="final"></a>A few final suggestions</h2>
Mathematical prose has a very low redundancy rate and mathematics is a
very cumulative subject. Pay close attention as you read---once introduced,
a concept is rarely repeated and it will be assumed later. Allow yourself
adequate time to read the book before starting the problems.
<p>Few students write fast enough to get complete and readable notes in
class. For this reason it is useful to go back over your class notes shortly
after each class and make a complete, clean copy with all of the definitions
and theorems clearly stated. This practice will also help you identify
parts you don't understand so you can ask your professor about them in
a timely fashion.
</p><p>Do not let yourself fall behind. Mathematics requires precision, habits
of clear thought, and practice. Cramming for an exam will not only fail
to produce the desired result on the exam, it will also reinforce a bad
habit---that of trying to do mathematics by memorization rather than understanding.
A good night's sleep and a clear head will serve you better than last minute
memorization.

However, Watson’s explanation, which he adapted from his colleague, Francis Crick, is profoundly misleading.</span></p><p>In 1956, Crick was working on a lecture that would bring together what was then known about the “flow of information” between DNA, RNA, and protein in cells. Crick formalized his ideas in what he called the Central Dogma, and his original conception of information flow within cells was both richer and more complex than Watson’s reductive and erroneous presentation.</p><p><span>Crick was aware of at least four kinds of information transfers, all of which had been observed in biochemical studies by researchers at that time. These were: DNA → DNA (DNA replication), DNA → RNA (called transcription), RNA → protein (called translation) and RNA → RNA (a mechanism by which some viruses copy themselves).

If this were true, however, it would mean that RNA was not always involved in protein synthesis, even though every study at that time suggested it was. Crick therefore concluded that this kind of information flow was highly unlikely, though not impossible.</p><p>Crick also theorized that RNA → DNA&nbsp;was chemically possible, simply because it was the reverse of transcription and both types of molecules were chemically similar to each other. Still, Crick could not imagine any biological function for this so-called “reverse transcription,” so he portrayed this information flow as a dotted line in his diagram.</p><p><span>The most significant part of Crick’s idea — and the part that Watson ignored in his oversimplification — was that there are three flows of information that </span><em>cannot occur</em><span>, due both to lack of experimental evidence and any plausible biochemical mechanisms. These were protein → protein, protein → RNA and, above all, protein → DNA.</span></p><p><span>In other words, in Crick’s schema, information within the cell only flows </span><em>from</em><span> nucleic acids </span><em>to</em><span> proteins, and never the other way around. Crick’s “Central Dogma” could therefore be described in a single line: “Once information has got into a protein it can’t get out again.” This negative statement — that some transfers of information seem to be impossible — was the essential part of Crick’s idea.</span></p><p>Crick’s hypothesis also carried an unstated evolutionary implication; namely, that whatever might happen to an organism’s proteins during its lifetime, those changes cannot alter its DNA sequence. In other words, organisms cannot use proteins to transmit characteristics they have acquired during their lifetime to their offspring.</p><p>Despite the overarching simplicity of Crick’s idea, scientists, students, and journalists have struggled to grasp its precise meaning over the years. While there are many reasons for this confusion, a large part stems from the fact that Watson’s simplified version of the Central Dogma has been contradicted by a number of experimental results. We now know, for instance, that information in RNA can indeed be “reversed” back into DNA. We have also come to realize that Crick erred by naming his idea a “dogma” in the first place.</p><p>The Central Dogma is not actually a dogma — defined as “a belief that is laid down by an authority and cannot be challenged.” That would be antithetical to the scientific method itself, which uses experimental results, rather than the proclamation of an authority, as the basis for knowledge.</p><p><span>So it was that Crick’s chosen name was quickly criticized by his contemporaries. French geneticist Jacques Monod, for instance, said that Crick “did not appear to understand the correct use of the word,” as Crick recalled in his memoir, </span><em>What Mad Pursuit</em><span>. Crick later explained that he called his idea a “dogma” because he was using “the word in the way [he himself] thought about it, not as most of the rest of the world does, and simply applied it to a grand hypothesis that, however plausible, had little direct experimental support.”</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1-152197362" href="https://www.asimov.press/p/crick#footnote-1-152197362" target="_self" rel="">1</a></span></p><p><span>Crick </span><a href="https://wellcomecollection.org/works/bgjq32em/items?canvas=76" rel="">later acknowledged</a><span> that he should have called his idea “the central hypothesis,” but he had already used the term “hypothesis” to describe another aspect of his vision of protein synthesis and did not want to repeat himself.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2-152197362" href="https://www.asimov.press/p/crick#footnote-2-152197362" target="_self" rel="">2</a></span></p><p>Apart from its name, students are often confused about the Central Dogma (or, at least, Watson’s version of it) because experimental evidence has repeatedly shown that the information in a cell doesn’t only flow from DNA → RNA → protein.</p><p><span>In 1970, for example, several different research teams simultaneously discovered reverse transcriptase, a viral enzyme that creates DNA from an RNA template. One of those researchers, Howard Temin, first proposed the existence of such an enzyme in 1962 to explain the behavior of RNA viruses that infect chickens, called the </span><em>Rous sarcoma </em><span>virus. Temin showed that inhibition of DNA synthesis stopped the reproduction of this RNA virus, suggesting it somehow turned its RNA into DNA.</span></p><p><span>Upon the discovery of reverse transcriptase, the scientific journal </span><em>Nature </em><span>published an editorial entitled, “</span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/2261198a0" rel="">Central Dogma Reversed</a><span>,”&nbsp;claiming it struck a major blow to the Central Dogma.</span></p><p><span>Unhappy with the editorial’s title, Crick </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/227561a0" rel="">published a rebuttal</a><span> insisting that he never claimed that the flow of information went solely from DNA → RNA → protein or that the transfer RNA → DNA could not occur.</span></p><p><span>In 1964, for example, in answer to a question after one of his lectures, Crick insisted that the Central Dogma </span><a href="https://wellcomecollection.org/works/xbbd8qbk/items?canvas=18" rel="">did not say</a><span> that you cannot go from RNA to DNA. The Central Dogma, Crick explained in his editorial, was “a negative statement, saying that transfers from proteins did not exist.” To clarify his point, he redrew the diagram he had first created in 1956.</span></p><p>But by 1970, Crick began to wonder whether prion diseases — such as scrapie, mad cow disease, or Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease — might be an actual exception to the Central Dogma.</p><p><span>Stanley Prusiner, a neurologist and biochemist at the University of California, San Francisco, first coined the term “prion” in 1982. At the time, Prusiner suspected prion diseases were caused by pathological proteins that triggered cells to make </span><em>new</em><span> prion proteins, a process which would be in direct contradiction to Crick’s hypothesis. But Prusiner had no decisive evidence for this idea.</span></p><p>After a great deal of research over the subsequent decades, it was eventually shown in the early 2000s that prion diseases like scrapie or human Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, or similar conditions in plants and fungi, all involve a misfolded, pathological protein. Specifically, prion proteins do not change the sequence of amino acids; they instead transmit their pathological shape to otherwise “healthy” proteins, causing them to misfold in the same way. Prion diseases do not alter the validity of the Central Dogma because they don’t alter any genetic sequences.</p><p><span>In other cases, researchers have </span><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/jez.2465" rel="">pointed to epigenetics</a><span> as a possible exception to Crick’s Central Dogma, arguing that changes in gene expression are transmitted across the generations and thus provide an additional, non-nucleic source of information. But still, epigenetics does not violate Crick’s Central Dogma.</span></p><p>During an organism’s life, environmental conditions cause certain genes to get switched on or off. This often occurs through a process known as methylation, in which the cell adds a methyl group to a cytosine base in a DNA sequence. As a result, the cell no longer transcribes the gene.</p><p>These effects occur most frequently in somatic cells — the cells that make up the body of the organism. If epigenetic marks occur in sex cells, they are wiped clean prior to egg and sperm formation. Then, once the sperm and eggs have fully formed, methylation patterns are re-established in each type of cell, meaning that the acquired genetic regulation is reset to baseline in the offspring.</p><p><span>Sometimes, these regulatory effects are </span><a href="https://febs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/1873-3468.14210" rel="">transmitted to the next generation</a><span> through the activity of small RNA molecules, which can interact with messenger RNAs or proteins to control gene expression. This occurs frequently in plants but is much rarer in animals, which have separate lineages for their somatic and reproductive cells. A widely-studied exception to this is the nematode </span><em>C. elegans</em><span>, where RNAs and other molecules can alter inheritance patterns.</span></p><p>No matter how striking, though, none of these examples violate Crick’s Central Dogma; the genetic information remains intact and the epigenetic tags are always temporary, disappearing after at most a few generations.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F20a19299-a835-4085-aebf-db0decf767d3_6795x7056.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F20a19299-a835-4085-aebf-db0decf767d3_6795x7056.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F20a19299-a835-4085-aebf-db0decf767d3_6795x7056.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F20a19299-a835-4085-aebf-db0decf767d3_6795x7056.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F20a19299-a835-4085-aebf-db0decf767d3_6795x7056.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F20a19299-a835-4085-aebf-db0decf767d3_6795x7056.jpeg" width="1456" height="1512" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/20a19299-a835-4085-aebf-db0decf767d3_6795x7056.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1512,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:4979730,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F20a19299-a835-4085-aebf-db0decf767d3_6795x7056.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F20a19299-a835-4085-aebf-db0decf767d3_6795x7056.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F20a19299-a835-4085-aebf-db0decf767d3_6795x7056.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F20a19299-a835-4085-aebf-db0decf767d3_6795x7056.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Francis Crick lecturing American students in 1977.</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>Epigenetic tags </span><em>do </em><span>change where and when genes are transcribed, and for how long.

[…] For example, the activating enzymes, the transfer RNA and the ribosomes are necessary for protein synthesis, and also define the genetic code, but they are not the sequence information itself, which resides in the mRNA.</p></blockquote><p><span>In other words, enzymes can modify proteins in the cell </span><em>after</em><span> they have been synthesized, so not every amino acid in a protein is specified in the genome. DNA does not contain all the information in a cell, but Crick’s original hypothesis remains true: “Once information has got into a protein it can’t get out again.”</span></p><p>Throughout his life, Crick often rebuked those who misinterpreted his ideas — even when the person doing the misinterpreting was a Nobel Prize-winning scientist.</p><p><span>In 2003, near the end of his life, Crick heard that Phil Sharp (1993 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine) was planning to mark the 50</span><sup>th</sup><span> anniversary of the double helix’s discovery by giving a talk on exceptions to the Central Dogma. </span><a href="https://wellcomecollection.org/works/fsz23wdp/items" rel="">Crick fired off a sharp letter</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p>As far as I know there are no exceptions to the Central Dogma. 	However, there are to Jim Watson’s incorrect version of it. His version is simply DNA → RNA → protein. This is not the Central Dogma. The Central Dogma says, in simple terms, that reverse translation, from protein to nucleic acid, never occurs […] it was pointed out to me that Jim had used the term Central Dogma incorrectly. He still continues to do so. If, as I suggest, you intend to discuss Jim’s version, I strongly suggest you call it ‘Watson’s Dogma.’</p></blockquote><p>Despite his fiery letter, Crick was not opposed to thinking through ways to break the Central Dogma. In 2002, he came up with a proposal to use genetic engineering to do precisely that.</p><p><span>Crick’s idea relied upon the fact that the genetic code is redundant. Each amino acid in a protein is encoded in DNA or RNA by a sequence of </span><em>three bases</em><span>, called a codon.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3-152197362" href="https://www.asimov.press/p/crick#footnote-3-152197362" target="_self" rel="">3</a></span><span> Many amino acids are encoded by several different codons, whereas just two amino acids are encoded by a single codon. For example, the codons UUA, UUG, CUU, CUC, CUA, and CUG all encode the amino acid leucine. The amino acid tryptophan, however, is encoded only by UGG. Therefore, two proteins with identical amino acid sequences could be encoded by distinct nucleic acid sequences.</span></p><p><a href="https://wellcomecollection.org/works/bgjq32em/items?canvas=76" rel="">Crick suggested that this redundancy might have made it possible</a><span> to overcome the Central Dogma and pass information from a protein back into the genome:</span></p><blockquote><p>Obviously one cannot easily translate backwards to the exact original nucleic acid sequence. But Nature might have devised a mechanism in which only one codon, for each amino acid, was used to translate backwards. This would have given, to a good approximation, a new nucleic acid sequence that when translated forward again would give the identical protein.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Recent advances in gene-editing now offer a method by which to test this theory. </p><p><span>Imagine that there are two different forms of an enzyme, A and B, each of which acts upon a different substrate. Now, imagine that the two enzymes differ by a single amino acid. It is possible to engineer a microbe such that the DNA encoding enzyme A could be </span><em>altered </em><span>to encode enzyme B depending upon which substrate is in the environment.</span></p><p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature17946" rel="">Base editing</a><span>, a gene-editing tool first reported in 2016, can be used to swap individual base pairs in the genome. One could presumably use base editing to change a single base pair in the gene for enzyme A, thus turning it into a gene encoding enzyme B. If the base editing tool was made in such a way that it’s only active when a particular substrate is in the environment, then the cells would </span><em>conditionally alter</em><span> their genomes based on “experience.” In other words, for such a system, information would flow from the outside world into the nucleic acids, </span><em>thus breaching the Central Dogma</em><span>.</span></p><p>This little thought experiment tells us two things. Firstly, it reinforces the conclusion that the Central Dogma is simply a description of existing transfers of information used by life. There is nothing magic about it.</p><p><span>But second, it raises the question of why biology has not evolved to alter DNA to swap between two forms of a protein.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-4-152197362" href="https://www.asimov.press/p/crick#footnote-4-152197362" target="_self" rel="">4</a></span><span> The answer, I think, is relatively simple: changing DNA is a relatively slow and “permanent” way to respond to an environmental shift. If the environment suddenly changes again, the cell might die before it can alter its DNA to respond.</span></p><p>A much safer solution, therefore, is for a cell to have both enzymes A and B encoded in DNA, with the expression of each being controlled by a system that detects the substrate in the environment. That is pretty much exactly what happens in many microbes; gene regulation responds to environmental stimuli. Rather than changing DNA, organisms keep copies of genes that are only expressed under certain circumstances.</p><p>This highlights two points: DNA is metabolically cheap to make, even if it does nothing (which explains why our DNA is full of meaningless repetitive sequences) and, to paraphrase the words of the French molecular biologist François Jacob, evolution does not design, it tinkers. Better to have a conditional expression system, with genes that are only rarely required, rather than continually rewriting DNA in response to changing environmental conditions.</p><p>From this point of view, breaching the Central Dogma is not only biochemically complicated but rather pointless. Nature has found a workaround that enables organisms to respond to changing environments without changing their DNA.</p><p>Understanding the precise nature of Crick’s Central Dogma is important because it not only explains how protein synthesis occurs but also reveals something profound about the origin of the variation in organisms that can be sifted and transmitted through natural selection.</p><p>So even if scientists one day create cells — or discover new lifeforms — that contradict the Central Dogma, their discovery will not cause the complex edifice of modern molecular biology to come tumbling down. After all, Crick’s idea was never a “dogma” at all, but rather a powerful hypothesis about the fundamental mechanisms that explain how information flows through life.</p><p><strong>Matthew Cobb </strong><span>is a Professor Emeritus in the School of Biological Sciences at the University of Manchester.

            <span>Abstract:</span>The capabilities and limitations of Large Language Models have been sketched out in great detail in recent years, providing an intriguing yet conflicting picture. On the one hand, LLMs demonstrate a general ability to solve problems. On the other hand, they show surprising reasoning gaps when compared to humans, casting doubt on the robustness of their generalisation strategies. The sheer volume of data used in the design of LLMs has precluded us from applying the method traditionally used to measure generalisation: train-test set separation. To overcome this, we study what kind of generalisation strategies LLMs employ when performing reasoning tasks by investigating the pretraining data they rely on. For two models of different sizes (7B and 35B) and 2.5B of their pretraining tokens, we identify what documents influence the model outputs for three simple mathematical reasoning tasks and contrast this to the data that are influential for answering factual questions. We find that, while the models rely on mostly distinct sets of data for each factual question, a document often has a similar influence across different reasoning questions within the same task, indicating the presence of procedural knowledge. We further find that the answers to factual questions often show up in the most influential data. However, for reasoning questions the answers usually do not show up as highly influential, nor do the answers to the intermediate reasoning steps. When we characterise the top ranked documents for the reasoning questions qualitatively, we confirm that the influential documents often contain procedural knowledge, like demonstrating how to obtain a solution using formulae or code. Our findings indicate that the approach to reasoning the models use is unlike retrieval, and more like a generalisable strategy that synthesises procedural knowledge from documents doing a similar form of reasoning.
