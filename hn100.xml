<p>The W3C has a page with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/History/1989/proposal.html">original WWW proposal</a> from Tim Berners-Lee. One of the downloads says&nbsp;</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.w3.org/History/1989/proposal">The original document file (I think - I can't test it)</a></li></ul><p><span>The "I can't test it" made me sad. There are two other files (an RTF version and an HTML version generated in 1998 from the original file). But can we open the original document?</span></p><p><span>The original document is 68,608 bytes and <span>file</span> on my Mac says it's a&nbsp;<span>Microsoft Word for Macintosh 4.0</span><span> file</span>. That matches with TBL's note on the W3C page saying: "A hand conversion to HTML of the original MacWord (or Word for Mac?) document written in March 1989 and later redistributed unchanged apart from the date added in May 1990."&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Microsoft Office for Mac came out in 1989 with System 6.0. That was Microsoft Word 4.0 so we're looking for compatibility with Microsoft Word for Macintosh 4.0. Let's see what modern software can open this. What I really want to be able to do is open it and convert it to, say, PDF with high fidelity.</span></p><h2><span>Microsoft Word</span></h2><p><span>Let's begin with Microsoft Word itself. I uploaded the file to Microsoft OneDrive with the extension .doc and clicked on it to open it in Microsoft Word.</span></p><div><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEivCGzwNqeNyN4mZPNF593LeO14xECSZPabgJK43_trMY-NNlDrGrUYeGPAQ11lVk4vmh8o9U05sPW7xIYx1vDLIGDQWHFo9x6gEwqkvA3JzPkmLhyVS8HGHSCRXqH-yQXFo3Q9qxsje_rF5Vuzzm1YfxlIU2mlCXEvjDJ1ebeSl8G6gDD9zJ7iRA/s1358/proposal-1.png"><img data-original-height="524" data-original-width="1358" height="246" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEivCGzwNqeNyN4mZPNF593LeO14xECSZPabgJK43_trMY-NNlDrGrUYeGPAQ11lVk4vmh8o9U05sPW7xIYx1vDLIGDQWHFo9x6gEwqkvA3JzPkmLhyVS8HGHSCRXqH-yQXFo3Q9qxsje_rF5Vuzzm1YfxlIU2mlCXEvjDJ1ebeSl8G6gDD9zJ7iRA/w640-h246/proposal-1.png" width="640"></a></p><h2>Apple Pages</h2><p>I switched to the Mac and hoped that Apple Pages might understand an old Microsoft Word for Macintosh file.

The LibreOffice imported version has 24 pages.&nbsp;</p><p>To get an overview of what's different I created a PDF from the LibreOffice version and then looked at it and the CERN PDF in the contact sheet version in Apple Preview.</p><p>Here's the CERN PDF:</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgtmLx2yw7hBNA1hZ0YGxlcvJee0qSv5IoSm6ytWun-nEFw7z-5yWT0Ckc7pzcW6SGZl72nM-jYZUbV5ZUhUlfrGjYWcmz6HVD_p6XI1bEegfQucRbHhjfaPwnlz4mH_V-ANzeCzsMNDX8Fr5vsBpTi8oY1M-zCB26mlpsvCwdUzWXGi9mSNUfBrg/s2444/proposal-5.png"><img data-original-height="700" data-original-width="2444" height="184" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgtmLx2yw7hBNA1hZ0YGxlcvJee0qSv5IoSm6ytWun-nEFw7z-5yWT0Ckc7pzcW6SGZl72nM-jYZUbV5ZUhUlfrGjYWcmz6HVD_p6XI1bEegfQucRbHhjfaPwnlz4mH_V-ANzeCzsMNDX8Fr5vsBpTi8oY1M-zCB26mlpsvCwdUzWXGi9mSNUfBrg/w640-h184/proposal-5.png" width="640"></a></p><p>Here's the LibreOffice-generated PDF:</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhKTElIxIWy-jOHKCzOuLo8pd1rk_9ChaGL93vgNMElSsu9eRgIh_LHJ3yDVXzOvHFfF5iDEwRoPMH_Dyeuk1HNcB5K6wZOKu229VWK7kNpvpgGMXF7oekB5C-O4sRxK9fRPFTxSqEj8u3fUH7t9p8Un9on_hKu8sh0vliaQ98GRtp-TYRrrQ2PYQ/s2444/proposal-6.png"><img data-original-height="1052" data-original-width="2444" height="276" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhKTElIxIWy-jOHKCzOuLo8pd1rk_9ChaGL93vgNMElSsu9eRgIh_LHJ3yDVXzOvHFfF5iDEwRoPMH_Dyeuk1HNcB5K6wZOKu229VWK7kNpvpgGMXF7oekB5C-O4sRxK9fRPFTxSqEj8u3fUH7t9p8Un9on_hKu8sh0vliaQ98GRtp-TYRrrQ2PYQ/w640-h276/proposal-6.png" width="640"></a></p><p>Things that are different:</p><p>1. The right-hand margin is missing in the LibreOffice version.</p><p>2. The LibreOffice version is using 14 pt vs. 12 pt for most of the text.</p><p>3. The LibreOffice version has turned headers with TBL's initials in them into footers.</p><p>4. The page breaks look in the right places (see how the images are correctly placed towards the end); thus it's probably the font size that's the biggest problem.</p><p>5. There CERN PDF has a space under the heading and the LibreOffice version does not.</p><h2>Emulation</h2><p>To make sure that I knew what the actual original document looked like I decided to use <a href="https://infinitemac.org/1990/System%206.0.5">Infinite Mac</a> to boot a 1990-era Macintosh and run actual Word for Macintosh 4.0 on the original document.</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiijOiXeCEF_J1oTZBDun1YT3lye7507nTXRpEAUjYW6CQOVFhI6Qb1jGJhDgAJeOEA1BwmDFLqPYnq25JSXaK5zw2oZOFBTvZiVqmNfhf8Vfp4UYQ_HwJzIKuC_a3kAfvGNhR3U6rSlB77KUFilVUX2lVL7SKnnaQU4ZHkwilImtVFGqKak4kG1w/s1411/proposal-9.png"><img data-original-height="1081" data-original-width="1411" height="490" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiijOiXeCEF_J1oTZBDun1YT3lye7507nTXRpEAUjYW6CQOVFhI6Qb1jGJhDgAJeOEA1BwmDFLqPYnq25JSXaK5zw2oZOFBTvZiVqmNfhf8Vfp4UYQ_HwJzIKuC_a3kAfvGNhR3U6rSlB77KUFilVUX2lVL7SKnnaQU4ZHkwilImtVFGqKak4kG1w/w640-h490/proposal-9.png" width="640"></a></p><p>That way I can see actual fonts, font sizes and layout to confirm how the document should have looked. And that's where it became obvious that the original document on the original Mac and the CERN PDF are quite different. The CERN PDF has 20 pages. On the Mac running Word for Macintosh 4.0 with A4 paper it has 22 pages. So I decided to aim to get us close to the original document on the Mac.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjM3_thqxV_ZB-VqLJRytn7oA8LbAMlQ2a3kRZrubYhWt4M8ns2R-3nHFXFG-367BDUJQkHtLO6oqFNrZWGXhwlQfarVp_ih1SDBgBWsWGBKqKmZUYD51WLmLIGCQ1no0EcAPeTidkHBb52Y-EY7AXYnBX9nll33G7FuZofLN9XgpD0bWak-T1ONQ/s1389/proposal-10.png"><img data-original-height="1062" data-original-width="1389" height="490" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjM3_thqxV_ZB-VqLJRytn7oA8LbAMlQ2a3kRZrubYhWt4M8ns2R-3nHFXFG-367BDUJQkHtLO6oqFNrZWGXhwlQfarVp_ih1SDBgBWsWGBKqKmZUYD51WLmLIGCQ1no0EcAPeTidkHBb52Y-EY7AXYnBX9nll33G7FuZofLN9XgpD0bWak-T1ONQ/w640-h490/proposal-10.png" width="640"></a></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p><span>So... set to A4 paper and set right margin to same size as left margin.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/02/13/tesla_cybertruck_rust/">https://www.theregister.com/2024/02/13/tesla_cybertruck_rust/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39357595">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>It's only been a few months since Tesla's long-awaited Cybertruck made its way to those at the front of the queue, but the arrival has been tarnished for some.</p>
<p>CEO Elon Musk first unveiled the electric pickup model <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2019/11/22/smashing_tesla_cybertruck/">back in 2019</a>, claiming that its "ultra-hard stainless steel" body and "transparent metal" glass were "literally bulletproof."</p>
<p>Though beset with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/17/first_tesla_cybertrunk/">production issues</a> and missing its speculative 2021-22 release, its unique polygonal design – as with anything Tesla and Musk-related – attracted legions of devotees eager to get their hands on the steering wheel.</p>

    

<p>This unique design isn't without shortfalls, at least according to reports in the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.cybertruckownersclub.com/">Cybertruck Owners Club</a> forum. A trending thread titled "<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cybertruckownersclub.com/forum/threads/rust-spots-corrosion-is-the-norm.11988/">Rust Spots/Corrosion is the Norm</a>" from a user going by "Raxar" states:</p>

<p>This, as you might expect, provoked a strong reaction from the faithful. "Liar. Is this fun for you?" one asked, while another incorrectly riposted: "If it 'rusts', it's not stainless steel." This is a common misconception. Stainless steel is resistant to rust, but not completely immune.</p>
<p>Members pondered whether orange stains could be caused by "rail dust" from certain vehicles being delivered via train, yet Raxar <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.cybertruckownersclub.com/forum/threads/rust-spots-corrosion-is-the-norm.11988/post-240328">posted some images</a> of his Cybertruck's body after driving it for "2 days in rain."</p>

        


        

<p>The tiny specks may not seem like a big deal, but given that the Cybertruck price went from $40,000 in 2019 to $60,000 in 2023, we understand why owners might want their cars to appear pristine at all times.</p>
<p>In a <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.cybertruckownersclub.com/forum/threads/cybertruck-spots-corrosion.12242/">separate thread</a>, another user, vertigo3pc, reported that "corrosion was forming on the metal" of his brand-new Cybertruck after 11 days in the "LA rain," leading some to worry that the steel body was becoming contaminated during production.</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/01/24/tesla_cybertruck_offroading_video/">Tesla Cybertruck gets cyberstuck during off-roading expedition</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/12/19/musk_says_boat_mod_package/">Musk floats idea of boat mod for Cybertruck</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/15/tesla_reverses_course_on_cybertruck/">Tesla Cybertruck no-resale clause vanishes faster than a Model S in Ludicrous Mode</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/13/want_a_cybertruck_then_youre/">Want a Cybertruck? You're stuck with it for a year, says Tesla</a></li>
</ul>
<p>However, corrosion reports may stem from owners believing that "ultra-hard stainless steel" doesn't require much care. Tesla, it appears, would vehemently disagree.</p>
<p>Another thread from January <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.cybertruckownersclub.com/forum/threads/cybertruck-corrosion-per-owner-manual.11445/">included a screenshot of Cybertruck's maintenance documentation</a>, where it is said that the car does not have a clear coat. Clear coat is the outermost layer of transparent paint that serves as a protective barrier, preventing UV radiation and weather from damaging the colored paint layer. Clear coat also takes abrasions that might otherwise scratch the paint job.</p>

        

<p>The user warns: "The Cybertruck's exterior is susceptible to corrosion, as acknowledged in the manual. Once the oxide barrier is compromised, corrosion initiates. The manual advises prompt removal of corrosive substances, emphasizing not to wait until the Cybertruck is scheduled for a full wash."</p>
<p>The documentation says: "To prevent damage to the exterior, immediately remove corrosive substances (such as grease, oil, bird droppings, tree resin, dead insects, tar spots, road salt, industrial fallout, etc.). Do not wait until Cybertruck is due for a complete wash. If necessary use denatured alcohol to remove tar spots and stubborn grease stains, then immediately wash the area with water and a mild, non-detergent soap to remove the alcohol."</p>
<p>It sounds like a lot of work if even a five-minute dash for milk might result in a midge besmirching the body. Tesla explicitly states: "The stainless steel exterior of Cybertruck is more resistant to dents and dings than most other vehicles. However, Cybertruck does not have a clear coat on the surface of the exterior body panels, meaning any scratches that appear are in the stainless steel panels themselves."</p>

        

<p><em>The Register</em> asked Tesla whether it agreed with the description of Cybertruck corrosion as the "norm," and if not, what the company expected to cause the spots documented. We will update the article if a response is forthcoming. ®</p>

        </header>
        <p>It’s pretty weird for a startup to remain in stealth for over five years. People ask me why we did that, and my answer is always the same: “We wanted to build something awesome before releasing it out into the wild, and we were lucky enough to be able to do that under the radar while also attracting great hires, finding early customers, and working with investors.” All the same, it’s an unnatural thing for a startup to do. A lot of muscles end up atrophying, including those you use to talk to the world.   Fortunately, we’re going to get a lot of practice at it now, because in those five years we’ve built a lot of stuff – way more than I can tell you about right now. But I can tell you the first part of it.</p>
<h4>Why We Built This</h4>
<p>Some of you have heard of our last company, FoundationDB. At first glance, Antithesis couldn’t be more different from FoundationDB, but it’s also a continuation of that story in a funny sort of way. When we sat down in 2010 to build a scalable, fault-tolerant distributed database with ACID transactions, most people didn’t even think it was possible.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">[1]</a></sup> We were agnostic as to whether it was possible or impossible, but we were certain that even under the best circumstances, it would be very hard. And the part that seemed hardest was how on earth you could test or validate such a thing, and how you could gain confidence in its correctness.</p>
<p>The fundamental problem of software testing—you might say the fundamental problem of software <em>development</em>—is that software has to handle many situations that the developer has never thought of or will never anticipate. This limits the value of testing, because if you had the foresight to write a test for a particular case, then you probably had the foresight to make the code handle that case too. This makes conventional testing great for catching regressions, but really terrible at catching all the “unknown unknowns” that life, the universe, and your endlessly creative users will throw at you.</p>
<p>
    <img alt="solving the wrong problem" src="https://antithesis.com/blog/is_something_bugging_you/images/wrong%20problem.jpeg">
</p>
<p>This isn’t unique to distributed databases: every kind of software has this problem, but a distributed storage system really turns it up to 11. Now you’ve got concurrency, both within each machine and between machines. You’ve got networks, which always seem to be delaying or reordering packets at the worst possible moments, and disks, which are just waiting for you to look away so they can start vomiting all over your data. And then you’ve got all the stuff that can <em>really</em> go wrong—machine failures and power outages and datacenters catching fire and, oh yeah, well-meaning human beings panicking and accidentally making things worse. What’s especially hard about these failure modes is that they’re <em>non-deterministic</em>—you can easily have a catastrophic bug that’s exquisitely dependent on the precise ordering of events across multiple machines in a cluster. Even if your tests find it once, they may never find it again (but don’t worry, your customers will find it for you). And here we were, trying to make a software system that would behave <em>perfectly</em> and maintain its ACID guarantees in the face of all of this. How were we going to do that?</p>
<p>So we did something crazy, which turned out to be the best decision we made in the whole history of the company. Before we even started writing the database, we first wrote a fully-deterministic event-based network simulation that our database could plug into. This system let us simulate an entire cluster of interacting database processes, all within a single-threaded, single-process application, and all driven by the same random number generator. We could run this virtual cluster, inject network faults, kill machines, simulate whatever crazy behavior we wanted, and see how it reacted. Best of all, if one particular simulation run found a bug in our application logic, we could run it over and over again with the same random seed, and the exact same series of events would happen in the exact same order. That meant that even for the weirdest and rarest bugs, we got infinity “tries” at figuring it out, and could add logging, or do whatever else we needed to do to track it down. I gave a talk about this at Strangeloop in 2014, which you can watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fFDFbi3toc">here</a>.</p>
<p>Anyway, we did this for a while and found all of the bugs in the database. I know, I know, that’s an insane thing to say. It’s kind of true though. In the entire history of the company, I think we only ever had one or two bugs reported by a customer. <em>Ever</em>. Kyle Kingsbury aka “aphyr” didn’t even bother testing it with Jepsen, because he didn’t think he’d find anything.</p>
<p>
    <img alt="aphyr-twitter-fdb" src="https://antithesis.com/blog/is_something_bugging_you/images/aphyr_twitter_fdb.png">
</p>
<p>It was a good database. But actually, this is not the cool part of the story.</p>
<p>Here is the cool part of the story. The cool part is what happened after we found all the bugs in the database. You see, once you’ve found all the bugs in something, and you have very powerful tests which can find any new ones, programming feels completely different. I’ve only gotten to do this a few times in my career, and it’s hard to convey the feeling in words, but I have to try. It’s like being half of a cyborg, or having a jetpack, or something. You write code, and then you ask the computer if the code is correct, and if not then you try again. Can you imagine having a genie, or an oracle, which just <em>tells you</em> whether you did something wrong? The closest comparison I have is the way some people talk about programming in Haskell or in Rust, where after half an hour of siege warfare against the compiler, it agrees to build something, and you can be confident that it won’t have certain kinds of bugs. But there’s a limit to what a compiler can tell you. I love me a powerful type system, but it’s not the same as actually running your software in thousands and thousands of crazy situations you’d never dreamed of.</p>
<p>At FoundationDB, once we hit the point of having ~zero bugs and confidence that any new ones would be found immediately, we entered into this blessed condition and we flew. Programming in this state is like living life surrounded by a force field that protects you from all harm. Suddenly, you feel like you can take risks. We did crazy stuff. We deleted all of our dependencies (including Zookeeper) because they had bugs, and wrote our own Paxos implementation in very little time and it <a href="https://www.foundationdb.org/files/fdb-paper.pdf">had no bugs</a>. We rewrote the entire transaction processing subsystem of our database to make it <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8729420">faster and more scalable</a> – a bonkers thing to do btw – and the project was shockingly not a debacle, and oh yeah it had no bugs. We had built this sophisticated testing system to make our database more solid, but to our shock that wasn’t the biggest effect it had. The biggest effect was that it gave our tiny engineering team the productivity of a team 50x its size.</p>
<p>In 2015, Apple acquired FoundationDB and began using it as the “underpinning of their cloud infrastructure” (that’s a <a href="https://www.foundationdb.org/files/fdb-paper.pdf">direct quotation</a> from Apple, so they can’t sue me), and then <a href="https://github.com/apple/foundationdb">open sourced</a> it a few years later. As our team began to disperse throughout other big tech companies, we were shocked to find that even in these sophisticated organizations, nothing like FoundationDB's deterministic simulation testing existed. The near-impossibility of anticipating unintended system impacts meant that changes to their backend systems happened at a snail's pace, and diagnosing and fixing production bugs consumed months of extremely valuable time from some of their most senior engineers.</p>
<p>So I called up my friend and former boss Dave Scherer (FoundationDB’s chief architect), and told him: “There’s a $100 bill lying on the sidewalk here man.” Of course, economic theory will tell you that those don’t exist. There’s always a catch, always some horrible reason that the pot of gold is surrounded by corpses. But starting a company is about banishing that thought and telling yourself that when you reach the pit full of poisonous spikes, you’ll figure something out. So in 2018, we started Antithesis with the goal of bringing the superpower of FoundationDB-style deterministic autonomous testing to everybody else.</p>
<p>
    <img alt="poison-spikes" src="https://antithesis.com/blog/is_something_bugging_you/images/poison%20spikes.png">
</p>
<h4>What We've Built</h4>
<p>Sure enough, the $100 bill is surrounded by an entire <em>field</em> of poisonous spike-pits, nay, a <em>continent</em> of them. Here’s an obvious one: how do you take an arbitrary piece of software, which is probably doing stuff like spawning threads, checking the time, asking the kernel for random numbers, and talking to other software over a network, and make it deterministic? At FoundationDB we had the benefit of a green-field project that we knew we wanted to test this way, and we had no dependencies (or at least, we didn’t once we’d deleted them all). But any new software development methodology that requires everybody to rewrite everything from scratch isn’t going to get very far. We thought about this and decided to just go all out and write a hypervisor which emulates a deterministic <em>computer</em>. Consequently, we can force anything inside it to be deterministic. That meant learning lots of fun new things about how Intel CPUs handle extended page tables and other related horrors. It’s a story for another time, but it’s a good example of the kind of poisonous spike-pit we’ve gotten to explore (and it’s far from the worst one!).<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Anyway, we’ve built a platform that takes your software and hunts for bugs in it. When it finds one, that bug is always perfectly reproducible, no matter what crazy thing your software was doing–even if it involves multiple services communicating across a network. Also, once we’ve found a bug, we can bring some relatively space-age and insane debugging capabilities to bear on it. The platform is designed to be able to someday find many kinds of bugs in many kinds of software, but for now, we’re focused solely on distributed systems reliability / fault tolerance testing, because it’s an area where we already know what we’re doing.</p>
<p>Over the past several years we’ve partnered with engineering teams at a bunch of organizations with big and complicated systems whose reliability they consider critical. We’ve worked with <a href="https://antithesis.com/case_studies/mongodb_productivity">MongoDB for several years</a>, helping them test their core server software as well as their WiredTiger storage engine. We began working with the Ethereum Foundation about a year ahead of the Merge in order to <a href="https://antithesis.com/case_studies/ethereum_merge">help them test it</a>, and continue working with them today. And we’re working with Palantir—but when I told them I was writing this blog post they just glared at me and said “no comment”, so that’s all I can say about that.</p>
<p>Initially, these customers thought of Antithesis as a “special forces” tool that primarily helped them find and replicate their most elusive and dangerous bugs. But as our platform has become more mature and interactive, we’ve shifted to being an “always on” service that continuously tests the most recent builds of their software, thus shortening the time from bug introduction to bug discovery. When building FoundationDB, we found that this made diagnosing and fixing bugs dramatically easier, increasing our efficiency and improving our software quality. Our customers are seeing this effect now, and we’re excited to help many more of you reach the ~zero bugs promised land in the years to come.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="">



        <p>Mathematics teacher <a href="https://github.com/sarah11918"><u>Sarah Rainsberger</u></a> wasn’t planning to become an open source contributor when she started rebuilding her choir’s website. She just wanted to learn JavaScript and web development for fun. “I wasn't a programmer, but I often found I was the only remotely technical person in a group,” she explained. “That’s how I ended up building the choir website in the first place.”</p>
<p>
She settled on using the front-end framework <a href="https://github.com/withastro/astro"><u>Astro</u></a>, which was brand new at the time. It had fewer resources for learners than more established frameworks, but she thought following along as the project grew would be a good way to learn. She soon found herself contributing a small piece of code—a configuration file—to the project. Then, as the project grew, Rainsberger became increasingly involved with the community, fielding questions and supporting new Astro users. “I wasn’t the person who knew the most about the inner workings of the project, but I knew how to explain stuff and guide people through the learning process,” she says. “And I knew who to ask when there was something I didn’t know.”</p>

<p>Today, Rainsberger is part of Astro’s core maintainer group. But she still isn’t particularly involved in the codebase, even as she’s deepened her web development skills. As the documentation lead, she spends her time helping others learn the ins and outs of Astro.</p>

<p>When we think about “contributors” in open source, all too often we think of those who write code, whether that's adding features or fixing bugs. But open source projects are more than just code. Much of the work that goes into open source is the type of work Rainsberger does.</p>

<p>“The things you need for a successful open source project overlap with what you need for a successful commercial product,” says <a href="https://github.com/geekygirldawn"><u>Dawn Foster</u></a>, an open source community manager currently working as director of open source community strategy at VMware. “That includes documentation, localization, marketing, graphic design, testing, community management, and release management.”</p>

<p>It’s difficult to overstate how important non-code contributions are to open source. “Even if you write an amazing program, no one will use it if you don’t explain what it does and how to use it,” says <a href="https://github.com/nate-double-u"><u>Nate Waddington</u></a>, a developer advocate at the Cloud Native Computing Foundation with a background in design. A very simple project might just need a README, but the more complex the project, the more documentation, tutorials, and support are needed to make the code useful. Easy-to-source documentation boosts productivity by about 50% in both open source and enterprise software projects, according to the <a href="https://octoverse.github.com/2021/"><u>2021 State of the Octoverse</u></a> report. Graphic design, branding, and outreach, meanwhile, help signal the health and seriousness of a project that other projects or companies might leverage as dependencies.</p>

<p>While there are plenty of opportunities for non-technical folks to contribute to open source, non-code contributions aren’t necessarily non-technical. Certain testing, documentation, and support tasks might require deep knowledge of a codebase. As more and more people seek to contribute to open source to advance their careers, give back to the community, or both, it’s important to remember that these non-code contributions are crucial to open source and provide plenty of opportunities to develop technical and non-technical skills alike.</p>



<h3><b>Why YOU should make non-code contributions</b></h3>

<p>Adding features or fixing bugs might sound more glamorous than localizing documentation, providing support, or filing reproducible bug reports—especially if your goal is to use open source contributions as a path toward employment. But making non-code contributions can be just as rewarding, as Rainsberger’s experience demonstrates.</p>
<p>
If you’re interested in technical communications, graphic design, user experience design, or other roles that don’t involve programming, open source provides an opportunity to build a portfolio. However, programmers also benefit from sharpening their non-code skills, particularly in writing and communication. Plus, experience in writing, support, or community organizing can help you pivot into roles like developer relations or product management.</p>

<p>There are opportunities for people of any skill level to get involved. “You don’t need a computer science degree, or an English degree for that matter, to write documentation,” Waddington says. “Even if you’re not a strong writer, you have to start somewhere.”</p>
<p>Besides, it’s hard to make meaningful code contributions until you have a thorough understanding of a project. “Feature requests are fundamentally a different mindset for contributions,” <a href="https://github.com/wntrblm"><u>Winterbloom</u></a> founder Thea Flowers said in <a href="https://github.blog/2023-05-03-more-than-meets-the-pull-request-maintainers-talk-contributions/"><u>a recent contributor relations Q&amp;A with The ReadME Project</u></a>. “The other contributions are really like patching up a wall or repainting a fence, but a feature request is like building a new shed in your backyard. You’ve got to really think about it a bit.” Even what appears to be a small bug fix can have big ramifications.</p>

<p>“Only five percent of the effort to actually get something shipped is writing the code for it,” <a href="https://github.com/benbjohnson/litestream"><u>Litestream</u></a> maintainer <a href="https://github.com/benbjohnson"><u>Ben Johnson</u></a> said in our <a href="https://github.com/readme/featured/how-open-is-open-source"><u>article on different levels of openness for contributions</u></a>. “It’s the years of maintenance afterwards, fixing bugs, writing documentation, making tutorials, and all this other stuff. That’s the hard part.” In an informal social media poll in April, The ReadME Project asked maintainers what type of open source contribution they would want if they had to choose only one type from now on. Although code was the most popular answer, with 62.2% of the vote, more than one-third of respondents would prefer documentation, design, or testing.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/msaroufim"><u>Mark Saroufim</u></a>, an AI engineer at Meta who helps maintain <a href="https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch"><u>PyTorch</u></a>, recommends reading the documentation for a project you might want to get involved in and fixing any parts that are outdated or broken as a good starting point. Prolific open source maintainer <a href="https://github.com/readme/stories/jordan-harband"><u>Jordan Harband</u></a> explained in the Q&amp;A that newcomers are often better at recognizing issues with existing documentation or spotting areas that lack documentation, specifically because they’re not already experts with a particular project. “Any documentation I write will inevitably be tainted by my already knowing how it works,” he said.
Likewise, reading and responding to other people’s questions will help you deepen your knowledge, get to know the maintainers, and learn a project’s build process. “It gives you x-ray vision into a project,” Saroufim says.</p>
<p>
Even after you’ve transitioned to making code contributions, there are plenty of reasons to keep working on the non-code side. “If you don’t want to work on non-code tasks forever, by all means, don’t,” Saroufim says. “But many of the best, most productive engineers at PyTorch are also active in support.” Providing support helps maintainers learn where users struggle and what features users really want and need, and, in turn, develop better software.
</p>
<p>Sustained community involvement is also a better way to make a name for yourself in open source than one-off code contributions, and there are often more long-term opportunities to help out with a project in non-coding tasks. Rainsberger’s experience is proof of that. Her Chromebook contributions were valuable, but what made her a core contributor was her active involvement in the community.</p>

<p>“The relationships and trust you build are important from a career standpoint,” says Foster. “You will stand out more by consistently being helpful in a community’s Slack or Discord or by helping organize events like community meetups.”</p>

<h3><b>Finding and appreciating non-code contributors</b></h3>

<p>The importance of non-code contributions is clear, but how can maintainers find people to pitch in? Ideally, contributors will follow Waddington’s advice and jump in without waiting for someone to tell them what to do. However, the opposite advice applies to maintainers: If they want contributions, the best thing to do is to ask people to do specific things. “I search Twitter and if I see someone tweeting about something missing or incorrect in the docs I ask them if they’re interested in fixing it,” said Rainsberger. “It’s a simple way to get the docs fixed and to give people an opportunity to get involved.”
</p>
<p>Flowers recommends building a community on a chat platform like Discord, Gitter, or Slack to make it easier for people to get involved informally with a project. “It makes people feel less hesitant to ask quick questions,” she said. “A lot of people are intimidated to ask questions on repositories.” Also, people outside a project’s core team might be more willing to pipe up with an answer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Maintainers should also file issues and tag them with “Help Wanted” and, when appropriate, “Good First Issue.” The State of the Octoverse report found that projects with about 25% of their issues marked with the “Help Wanted” tag saw 13% more contributors than those without, and those with 40% of issues tagged as “Good First Issues” saw 21% more new contributors than those without.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Projects can also participate in programs like <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/"><u>Summer of Code</u></a>, <a href="https://hacktoberfest.com/"><u>Hacktoberfest</u></a>, and <a href="https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs"><u>Season of Docs</u></a>. Astro focused specifically on non-code contributions at Hacktoberfest 2022. “It was phenomenal. We had so much activity; it was really nice to help so many people make their first PR to open source,” Rainsberger says.</p>

<p>But just asking for help isn’t always enough. Depending on the size and complexity of your project, contributors may need additional onboarding and orientation. Mentorship is perhaps the best way to set contributors up for success. The 2021 State of the Octoverse report found that mentorship increased productivity in open source projects by 46% and tripled the chances of having a healthy culture. “Having a dedicated person who engages with new community members helps them overcome hurdles and stay involved with the project,” <a href="https://github.com/GeorgLink"><u>Georg Link</u></a>, co-founder of open source health metrics organization <a href="https://github.com/chaoss"><u>CHAOSS</u></a>, told The ReadME Project for our <a href="https://github.com/readme/featured/contributor-onboarding"><u>article on onboarding contributors</u></a>. Mentorship is time-consuming and can take maintainers away from other tasks, but the time investment usually pays off in the long run. New contributors can take on increasingly important tasks and even become mentors themselves.
</p>
<p>It’s also crucial to elevate and appreciate non-code contributors. This not only helps keep current contributors motivated but also helps attract new contributors. “We try to give lots of opportunities for people to feel valued and publicly recognized,” Rainsberger says. Early on, the Astro project required someone to make “significant code contributions” to become a “core contributor.” That language has since changed to include non-code contributions when considering promoting people to core contributor status.</p>

<p>Non-code contributors are also included in the project’s other forms of recognition, such as badges that contributors can display on their GitHub profiles to highlight accomplishments within the project. To help ensure everyone gets their fair share of credit, Astro includes detailed instructions on specifying co-authorship on pull requests. Additionally, the GitHub avatar of every contributor is on the first page of the project’s documentation. For a more tangible reward, the project distributes funds raised on Open Collective to contributors once per quarter.
</p>
<p>It’s time for everyone to recognize the role that documentation, support, and other non-code contributions play in making open source viable. It’s never too late or too early to make your own contributions to your favorite projects.</p>

<p>A collection of philosopher <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/locke/">John Locke</a>‘s<a href="https://archives.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/repositories/2/resources/9195"> papers at the Bodleian Library</a> includes letters, accounts, poetry, notes on medicine and books, and recipes. When David Armitage posted this recipe for pancakes in the Bodleian collection on <a href="https://twitter.com/DavidRArmitage/status/1420686951829618688?s=20">Twitter</a>, I knew that I wanted to try it. These rich, nutmeg-scented pancakes are absolutely delicious.&nbsp;(Many thanks to Rhae Lynn Barnes and the other readers who immediately sent this recipe my way.)</p>


<p>In <a href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015005394641&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=22">Philip Long’s catalog</a> of the collection at the Bodleian, he notes that this recipe, and a few others, were written by Locke: “A collection of twelve recipes dated 1675-94, of which three (fols. 85, 89, 91) are in Locke’s hand” (2). The next time I visit Oxford for research, I will be excited to see this recipe as well as the eleven others in this set of miscellaneous papers.</p>

<p>pancakes<br>
Take sweet cream 3/4 + pint. Flower a<br>
quarter of a pound. Eggs <del>four</del> 7 leave out <del>two</del> 4 of<br>
the whites. Beat the Eggs very well. Then put in<br>
the flower, beat it a quarter of an hower. Then<br>
put in six spoonfulls of the Cream, beat it a litle<br>
Take new sweet butter half a pound. Melt it to oyle, &amp;<br>
take off the skum, power in all the clear by degrees<br>
beating it all the time. Then put in the rest of<br>
y<em>ou</em>r cream. beat it well. Half a grated nutmeg<br>
&amp; litle orangeflower water. Frie it without butter.<br>
This is the right way</p>
<p>From the start, I was intrigued by the cross-outs and other notes in the recipe. It appears that it was first drafted (or prepared) using significantly fewer eggs. The modifier “new” was added before “sweet butter” at some point. Locke may have written the final note “This is the right way” as part of the initial draft or after the recipe was prepared. Locke was attentive to the details of separating and whisking eggs as well as adding just the right amount of orange blossom water (“litle”) and nutmeg (“Half a grated nutmeg”) – an exceptional, expensive amount.</p>

<p>Like the other seventeenth- and eighteenth-century <a href="https://rarecooking.com/2016/02/09/pancakes-two-ways/">pancakes</a> that I’ve tried, these fall somewhere between crêpes and American pancakes: They’re a bit fluffier and fattier than a classic French crêpe and have far less rise than my favorite American breakfast version. My spouse, Joseph, described Locke’s pancakes as somewhere between a classic English pancake and a Scotch pancake (or Scottish pancake).</p>
<p>Many of the commenters on Twitter balked at the instruction to beat the eggs and flour for a “quarter of an hower.” These extended mixing times, however, are common in early modern recipes. While I did prepare my version using a hand-held mixer to ensure thorough beating, I did reduce the mixing time to avoid <a href="https://www.bonappetit.com/test-kitchen/common-mistakes/article/10-pancake-common-mistakes-avoid">over-mixing</a> which can lead to&nbsp;a chewy pancake. From what I know about historical and contemporary flour milling, this would not have been a concern for Locke or his cook.</p>

<p><strong>Updated Recipe</strong></p>
<p><em>Makes approximately 10 8-inch pancakes</em></p>
<p>1 cup butter (2 sticks, 1/2 lb, 226g)<br>
3 whole eggs plus 4 additional egg yolks<br>
1 cup flour (1/4 lb, 113g)<br>
1 1/2 cups heavy cream<br>
1 Tablespoon orange blossom water<br>
half a nutmeg, grated</p>
<p>First, melt the butter. Set it aside.</p>
<p>Put the whole eggs and egg yolks in a large bowl. Beat with a whisk or hand-held mixer until well combined.</p>
<p>Add the flour and beat until smooth and completely combined. Add 6 Tablespoons of the cream to the egg flour mixture and mix until combined. While stirring or beating, pour in the melted butter.&nbsp;Add the remaining cream and orange blossom water and stir to combine. Grate 1/2 a nutmeg and stir into batter.</p>
<p>Heat a frying pan or skillet on a high heat until a drop of water skitters across the surface. Lower the heat to medium.</p>
<p>Pour approximately half a cup of batter into the center of the pan and spread by swirling the pan to create an 8-inch pancake. Cook for 1 minute or until the edges of the pancake lift and appear lacy and the middle looks mostly set. Flip the pancake and cook for an additional 30 seconds.</p>
<p>Repeat until your batter is gone. Serve the pancakes immediately.</p>

<p><strong>The Results</strong></p>
<p>Between the rich dairy and the fragrant nutmeg, these pancakes made for a decadent breakfast. When Locke wrote down, and perhaps prepared this recipe, the eggs, cream, butter, and flour would all have been ingredients ready to hand in many households. The addition of so much nutmeg and a dash of orange blossom water elevates this specific pancake recipe to a special treat.</p>
<p>I certainly enjoyed sitting down with a plate of pancakes drizzled with a little bit of honey, a cup of coffee, and an old, heavily annotated copy of Locke that I read for a class that I took more than a decade ago. If you make these pancakes on a future winter morning or as part of your holiday vacation, be sure to let me know.</p>

<p>Note that all the examples in this website are generated with the same model that can generate both <strong>variable-length music and sound effects</strong> at 44.1kHz stereo. We append “high-quality, stereo” to our sound effects prompts because it is generally helpful.</p>

<p><strong>Prompt</strong>: This song contains someone strumming a melody on a mandolin while more people are whistling along. Then a mandolin, an e-bass and an acoustic guitar are playing a short melody in a lower key before breaking into the next part along with flutes and percussions. This song may be played outside by musicians performing.</p>

<p><strong>Prompt</strong>: The commercial music features a groovy piano melody played over snare rolls in the first half of the loop. Right after, there is a drop that consists of a punchy “4 on the floor” kick pattern, shimmering hi hats, claps, groovy piano and wide synth lead melody. It sounds happy, fun, euphoric and exciting.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last week<a href="https://www.thewrap.com/coyote-vs-acme-update-offers-warner-bros/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> an excellent report on The Wrap revealed that</a>, despite initially walking back its decision, Warner Bros. is indeed intent on throwing <em>Coyote vs Acme</em>--a funded, shot and completed motion picture--in the trash. Not because it sucks, but to save some money on taxes.</p><p>It's not the first time this has happened recently--"content" ranging<a href="https://gizmodo.com/disney-streaming-cuts-tax-writeoffs-1850502594" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> from Disney TV shows</a> to a <em>Batgirl </em>movie has met with the same fate--but this one stung a little more. Disney and HBO removing TV shows that people had already had a chance to see was one thing, and <em>Batgirl</em><a href="https://www.nme.com/en_au/news/film/batgirl-movie-so-bad-not-releasable-says-dc-studios-3390857#:~:text='Batgirl'%20movie%20was%20so%20bad%20it%20was%20%E2%80%9Cnot,releasable%E2%80%9D%2C%20says%20DC%20Studios%20boss&amp;text=Leslie%20Grace%20as%20'Batgirl'%20CREDIT,Grace%2C%20Brandon%20Fraser%20and%20J.K." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em> </em>was reportedly also very bad</a>, which was another.</p><p>But <em>Coyote vs Acme</em> has been seen by <em>nobody</em>. The movie--directed by Dave Green, written by <em>May December's</em> Samy Burch, produced by (among others) James Gunn and starring characters that define Warner Bros.' entire existence--was paid for, is finished, is ready to be seen, and now it stands a very real chance of being deleted forever, just to save a company some money.</p><p>It's an incredibly dystopian situation we all find ourselves in, where art is only made to be fed into a woodchipper to serve shareholders, and it's one<a href="https://www.looper.com/1161829/hollywood-creatives-are-breathing-fire-over-the-current-trend-of-tv-tax-write-offs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> that's been covered extensively elsewhere</a>, so I'm not going to get into the reeds over the politics and economics of the decision here.</p><p>What I am going to say, though, is that if you work at Warner Bros., or anywhere related to Warner Bros., and you have any access to this movie whatsoever, it's your moral imperative to leak it to the world before it's too late.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Topline</h2>
<p>Nvidia’s market value surpassed those of fellow technology titans Amazon and Alphabet on Monday, an almost unbelievable feat accomplished as Nvidia’s stock more than quadrupled over the last 15 months as investors bought into Nvidia’s market-leading<strong> </strong>position in artificial intelligence.</p>
<figure role="presentation"><figcaption><fbs-accordion current="-1"><p>Nvidia stock's 17,000% runup over the last 10 years is far and away the best of any S&amp;P 500 <span data-ga-track="caption expand">... [+]</span><span> constituent.</span></p></fbs-accordion><small>Getty Images</small></figcaption></figure> 

<h2>Key Facts</h2>
<div>
 <div>
  <p>Shares of Nvidia rose nearly 3% to an record high of over $740, bringing its market capitalization to $1.83 trillion, narrowly surpassing Alphabet’s $1.82 trillion and Amazon’s $1.8 trillion.</p>
  
 </div>
 <div>
  <p>The symbolic passing of the torch caps Nvidia’s remarkable journey as Wall Street flooded into the stock amid the AI boom.</p>
  
 </div>
 <div>
  <p>Nvidia’s market cap sat below $300 billion as recently as October 2022, just before the AI wave began to crest, lagging far behind Amazon and Alphabet’s above $1 trillion valuations at the time.</p>
  
  
 </div>
 <p>Nvidia is now the fourth most-valuable public company in the world, trailing only Microsoft ($3.1 trillion), Apple ($2.9 trillion) and Saudi Aramco ($2 trillion).</p>
</div>


<h2>Key Background</h2>
<p>Nvidia is by far the most prominent producer of the semiconductor chip technology powering generative AI. Investors have been impressed not just by the potential for Nvidia to capitalize on the growing interest and corporate spending in AI, but also by its already exploding results. Nvidia’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) expanded by more than 500% last quarter on a year-over-year basis thanks to runaway growth in its AI unit, far stronger than Amazon and Alphabet’s robust 20% or more earnings growth during the comparable period. Nvidia’s gross revenue and profits are less eye-popping than its trillion-dollar company peers – its $9.2 billion profit last quarter was far smaller than Apple’s and Microsoft’s over $22 billion profits during the comparable stretch – but analysts expect Nvidia’s financials to soon close the gap. Nvidia remains among the most popular stocks on Wall Street even after its more than 50% run-up this year, and is a top pick for analysts at both Goldman Sachs and Bank of America, each of which has an $800 price target for Nvidia, implying 8% further upside for the stock.</p>
<h2>Surprising Fact</h2>
<p>Nvidia stock’s 17,000% gain over the last decade is by far the best return of any stock on the S&amp;P 500, nearly tripling the return of silver medalist and fellow chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices. A $1,000 investment in Nvidia a decade ago would now be worth about $175,000.</p>
<h2>What To Watch For</h2>
<p>Nvidia will report earnings next Wednesday for its fiscal quarter ending last month. Analysts project the company to report its third consecutive quarter of record sales and profits.</p>

            Thick roots tumble across a dilapidated house, the snake-like trunks of a banyan tree framing where the front door once stood. Its walls have been hollowed by decades of typhoons, monsoons and summer humidity, now little more than loose, moss-covered stones and mortar dust. Vines tease through cracks in the foundations and fallen leaves litter the rotten floorboards.

            This scene wouldn’t look out of place deep in the Malaysian rainforest or the verdant foothills of India. But photographer Stefan Irvine snapped these pictures just a stone’s throw from one of the most densely populated cities in the world, a global metropolis of steely skyscrapers and gridlocked traffic.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clsjne83700083b6hjnef25q1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            Irvine, who has lived in <a href="https://www.cnn.com/world/asia/hong-kong">Hong Kong</a> since 2002, first stumbled across the city’s abandoned villages in 2012 while visiting a friend in the New Territories, a vast area to the city’s north. Accounting for over 85% of Hong Kong’s territory, the district is characterized by steep mountains, long stretches of rugged coastline and tree-covered country parks.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clsjne9e7000a3b6hgs4ltkyv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            “It made me question, ‘Why (were) so many of these places vacant in a place like Hong Kong, where the property prices are the highest in the world?’” Irvine recalled. Over the next 12 years, the London-born photographer explored more of these abandoned villages, documenting what would become the subject of his new book, “<a href="https://www.stefanirvine.photo/book/abandoned-villages-of-hong-kong-stefan-irvine" target="_blank">Abandoned Villages of Hong Kong</a>.”
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clsjne9e7000b3b6haxqe9sq6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            “It’s opened my eyes to a different aspect of Hong Kong,” said Irvine. “That’s what I’m hoping the project will do for other people as well.”

            Although Irvine took the first image for the project — an abandoned home with plants spilling out onto the road through a yellow door frame — in 2012, it wasn’t until 2019 that he began actively hunting down locations to photograph.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clsjngadu000j3b6h8v67ixly@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            “These villages have existed in Hong Kong for hundreds of years, way before the colonial period,” explained Irvine. In the 1950s and ‘60s, as Hong Kong grew as an industrial hub, many people migrated to the rapidly expanding urban centers for better working opportunities. “It’s hard farming and fishing out there in these remote areas, so a lot of people moved to the city to work in the factories,” he added.
    </p>

  


    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clsjngadu000k3b6hmc50phpk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            Through library research, the 48-year-old photographer found people who grew up in the villages or had relatives who lived there. In the book, he included essays from two women connected to the village: one whose father grew up in Wong Chuk Shan village, now completely overgrown, and another who spent several years of her childhood in Lai Chi Wo village, on the northeast coast of Hong Kong in the 1970s.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clsjngadu000l3b6hbh7vyacj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            “Now she lives in the UK with her own family, but she comes back to visit HK every few years, and still feels a deep sense of connection with Lai Chi Wo,” Irvine said of the latter woman, adding: “You can tell they feel an intense bond with their ancestors and with the village itself.”
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clsjngadu000m3b6h5zvravrd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            While many of the villages emptied out slowly over decades, Irvine found some homes that appeared to have been “abandoned pretty rapidly,” with personal items and furniture left behind.
    </p>

            “There were calendars on the wall, school certificates in drawers — it’s quite poignant,” said Irvine.
    </p>

            “I think a lot of people left with the intention of coming back one day, or maybe retiring back in the village. But if you don’t maintain these properties, eventually they’ll succumb to nature. Termites will start to burrow their way into the wooden beams. If one of those collapses, then the seeds can fall in from trees and plants, and then they really take over.”
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clsjnl5k4000t3b6hqc4bwpvx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            Rotting floorboards and unstable masonry made some of the building dangerous to explore. For Irvine, the biggest risk was posed by territorial village dogs that often became aggressive as he walked through remote areas. “I started the habit of carrying dog biscuits in my camera bag when I went out to these places,” he said.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clsjnl5k4000u3b6h6swjleh2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            The project took Irvine to the furthest reaches of the city, using minibuses and ferries to access isolated towns and islands. One adventure saw him embark on a six-hour round trip to Tung Ping Chau, a far-flung island closer to the Chinese mainland than to Hong Kong. Once a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.geopark.gov.hk/en/discover/attractions/tung-ping-chau" target="_blank">thriving fishing and farming community</a>, most residents left the island in the 1960s to make a living in the city. Irvine ended up using just one image from the trip in his book — but the trip was “totally worth it,” he said.

            “I would hike for about an hour into the wilderness to find a beautiful old village and I assumed there would be nobody there — and then around the corner would be someone with a wheelbarrow on their way to plant vegetables or something. So that was a bit of a shock,” he said.
    </p>

            Two of his favorite locations to shoot —&nbsp;Luk Keng, a coastal area near the border with Shenzhen in mainland China, and Lai Chi Wo, a remote 400-year-old Hakka village accessible only by boat or a two-hour hike through the forest —&nbsp;are both still home to small communities.

            “Lai Chi Wo is quite interesting because (Hong Kong’s) government has realized the heritage value in this village and they’ve invested a substantial amount of money to revitalize some of the old buildings,” said Irvine. “They want to encourage young people to go out there and stay overnight and to experience a different side of Hong Kong.”
    </p>

            Irvine found other deserted villages that were also being revitalized for tourism. Yim Tin Tsai, a former catholic missionary outpost and salt farming community, is completely abandoned — but every summer, it hosts an art installation and festival.

            “People take a little sampan (a flat-bottomed boat) across the water, it’s 15 minutes away from (the coast), and they can interact with these art installations that use some of the abandoned sites to great effect,” Irvine said.

            Irvine believes there is a growing sentimentality and nostalgia among Hong Kong’s people “to save and relish their built heritage.” These rural sites are a key part of that, he said, adding: “I think it’s of great value to people and their sense of identity.”

            Hong Kong is one of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wwf.org.hk/en/biodiversity/" target="_blank">most biodiverse cities&nbsp;</a>in the world, and its villages, which were often built around natural features and relied on the land, are a microcosm of that.

<p><b>Visual calculus</b>, invented by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mamikon_Mnatsakanian" title="Mamikon Mnatsakanian">Mamikon Mnatsakanian</a> (known as Mamikon), is an approach to solving a variety of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral" title="Integral">integral calculus</a> problems.<sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> Many problems that would otherwise seem quite difficult yield to the method with hardly a line of calculation. Mamikon collaborated with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Apostol" title="Tom Apostol">Tom Apostol</a> on the 2013 book <i>New Horizons in Geometry</i> describing the subject.

<p>Mamikon devised his method in 1959 while an undergraduate, first applying it to a well-known geometry problem: find the area of a ring (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annulus_(mathematics)" title="Annulus (mathematics)">annulus</a>), given the length of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_(geometry)" title="Chord (geometry)">chord</a> tangent to the inner circumference. Perhaps surprisingly, no additional information is needed; the solution does not depend on the ring's inner and outer dimensions.
</p><p>The traditional approach involves algebra and application of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem" title="Pythagorean theorem">Pythagorean theorem</a>. Mamikon's method, however, envisions an alternate construction of the ring: first the inner circle alone is drawn, then a constant-length tangent is made to travel along its circumference, "sweeping out" the ring as it goes.
</p><p>Now if all the (constant-length) tangents used in constructing the ring are translated so that their points of tangency coincide, the result is a circular disk of known radius (and easily computed area). Indeed, since the inner circle's radius is irrelevant, one could just as well have started with a circle of radius zero (a point)—and sweeping out a ring around a circle of zero radius is indistinguishable from simply rotating a line segment about one of its endpoints and sweeping out a disk.
</p><p>Mamikon's insight was to recognize the equivalence of the two constructions; and because they are equivalent, they yield equal areas. Moreover, the two starting curves need not be circular—a finding not easily proven by more traditional geometric methods. This yields <b>Mamikon's theorem</b>:
</p>
<dl><dd><i>The area of a tangent sweep is equal to the area of its tangent cluster, regardless of the shape of the original curve.</i></dd></dl>

<p>The area of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycloid" title="Cycloid">cycloid</a> can be calculated by considering the area between it and an enclosing rectangle. These tangents can all be clustered to form a circle. If the circle generating the cycloid has radius <span><i>r</i></span> then this circle also has radius <span><i>r</i></span> and area <span>π<i>r</i><sup>2</sup></span>. The area of the rectangle is <span>2<i>r</i> × 2π<i>r</i> = 4π<i>r</i><sup>2</sup></span>. Therefore the area of the cycloid is <span>3π<i>r</i><sup>2</sup></span>: it is 3 times the area of the generating circle.
</p><p>The tangent cluster can be seen to be a circle because the cycloid is generated by a circle and the tangent to the cycloid will be at right angle to the line from the generating point to the rolling point. Thus the tangent and the line to the contact point form a right-angled triangle in the generating circle. This means that clustered together the tangents will describe the shape of the generating circle.<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Feb.  12, 2024, 10:57 a.m.</p><p>“Owning our own work, and being beholden to no one but our readers and colleagues — as opposed to say, investors, venture capitalists, or out-of-touch executives — feels like the future.”</p><div id="content_div-222281">


<p>Until January, most stories from <a href="https://www.404media.co/">404 Media</a> were available to read for free. But after the four cofounders <a href="https://www.404media.co/why-404-media-needs-your-email-address/">discovered</a> — through their own reporting — that their stories were being scraped, paraphrased by AI text “spinners,” and published on other websites, they decided to start requiring readers to provide their email addresses to access stories, and they explained why.</p>
<p>“We see how Google is degrading in quality. We see how AI content mills are digesting our stories and gaming the system to get more views than our original reporting they’re ripping off,” cofounder <a href="https://twitter.com/emanuelmaiberg">Emanuel Maiberg</a> told me an email. “It’s important to us, and we think it’s important to our readers to know why we’re doing what we’re doing, but it’s also in the public interest to know what Google, AI, content mills, etc. are doing to the general health of the information environment.”</p>
<p>These are the types of stories, with that level of transparency, that 404 Media was founded to report, cofounder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jason-koebler-51339114/">Jason Koebler</a> said. It <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/22/business/media/404-media-vice-motherboard.html">launched</a> last August as a news outlet covering the impacts of technology on users in ways that are accessible, transparent, and relatable.</p>
<p>“Our goal is to find niche communities and see what they care about, what they’re happy and excited about, and what they’re really upset about,” Koebler said. “We want the communities that we’re writing about to read these articles and be like, ‘Okay, they got it right.’ But we don’t want to be so insular that only those people are interested.”</p>
<p>404 Media’s founders and co-owners —&nbsp;a staff of four —&nbsp;all come from <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/section/tech">Motherboard</a>, Vice’s tech vertical: Former Motherboard editor-in-chief <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jason-koebler-51339114/">Koebler</a>, former Motherboard executive editor <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/emanuel-maiberg-0b777a25/">&nbsp;Maiberg</a>, and former Motherboard staff writers <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/samleecole/">Sam Cole</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joseph-cox-2ba467173/">Joseph Cox</a>. Koebler said they decided to launch 404 Media after years of experiencing the financial ups and downs in the news industry —&nbsp;and seeing what independent publications like Defector <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2023/11/good-blogs-are-good-for-business-and-other-lessons-from-defectors-third-year/">have been able to accomplish</a>. (Vice <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/15/business/media/vice-bankruptcy.html">filed for bankruptcy</a> last May and was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/jun/22/vice-media-acquired-fortress-investment-group">sold to Fortress Investment Group</a> for $350 million in June; Motherboard <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/section/tech">still exists</a>.)</p>
<p>“There are so many things that big digital media companies waste money on, like consultants, software, offices,” Koebler said. Vice, in his view, “wasn’t able to consistently invest in new hires and in the journalism in a way that felt sustainable. We wanted to start a new company and basically strip it to its essentials.”</p>
<p>The four cofounders each own 25% of the company, and at launch each put in $1,000 to cover initial costs. Koebler declined to share current revenue numbers, but said the company is profitable (and that everyone’s been able to pay themselves back the money they initially put in).</p>
<p>“It’s hard to look around at the environment we’re working in, which we all love and are in because we love it, and think the status quo is functioning in anything close to a sustainable way,” Cole said. “Owning our own work, and being beholden to no one but our readers and colleagues — as opposed to say, investors, venture capitalists, or out-of-touch executives — feels like the future.”</p>
<p>Recent stories include the New Jersey government <a href="https://www.404media.co/new-jersey-used-covid-relief-funds-to-buy-banned-dahua-chinese-surveillance-cameras/">using COVID-19 relief funding to buy banned surveillance cameras</a>; why advertisers <a href="https://www.404media.co/advertisers-dont-want-sites-like-jezebel-to-exist/">don’t want publications like Jezebel to exist</a>; and why <a href="https://www.404media.co/wickr-closed-down-is-dead/">Amazon Web Services shut down the Wickr app</a>. 404 Media also has a publishing partnership with <a href="https://www.courtwatch.news/">Court Watch</a>: writer Seamus Hughes shares documents with the team, they write stories up with him or separately, and both publications get to publish the story.</p>
<p>“The most personal thing I’ve written for 404 Media so far has been <a title="https://www.404media.co/egg-freezing-experience-cost-side-effects/" href="https://www.404media.co/egg-freezing-experience-cost-side-effects/">about freezing my eggs</a>,” Cole said. “So much of how we move through the world, plan our futures, and access care is influenced by technology, and a lot of it is obvious. But this was such a human, messy, emotional experience for me that it was an interesting experiment to look at it through that lens.”</p>
<p>404’s revenue streams are <a href="https://www.404media.co/advertise-with-404-media/">advertising</a>, podcast ads, donations, <a href="https://404media.myshopify.com/">merchandise</a>, and <a href="https://www.404media.co/faq/">paid subscriptions</a>. Paid subscriptions, which start at <a href="https://www.404media.co/">$100 per year</a>, include access to events like <a href="https://www.404media.co/404-medias-first-foia-forum/">FOIA forums</a>, where the staff teaches participants how to file records requests. (More than 40 people attended the first forum.) 404 Media is also in the early stages of turning some of its feature stories into podcasts and documentaries. Koebler said that direct ad sponsorships — something he worked on for Motherboard — are working, too.</p>
<p>“We went into this being like, ‘We’ll have subscribers and we’ll have ads and hopefully that will work.’ And what we’re finding is that, yes, that is working, but then there’s also all these other little ways that you can make small amounts of money, like selling merch,” Koebler said. “We’re on Apple News now and in the process of enabling monetization there…I suspect that when we turn it on, we’ll be making $20 to $100 per month, which is very little money but as we grow, all of those things start to add up.”</p>
<p>The 404 team DIYs as much as possible. They pay for hosting through Ghost and set up litigation insurance, for example, but everyone makes their own art for stories instead of paying for agency photos. (The reporters are also the merch models). Everyone works from home, so they don’t have an office and don’t plan on getting one anytime soon. The team communicates through a free Slack channel. Koebler mails out merchandise from his garage in Los Angeles. Every month, the team meets (virtually) to decide how much they can pay themselves. (The number changes each month, but everyone gets paid the same amount.)</p>
<p>The focus is now on growing the audience in ways that feel authentic. “It’s imperative that we be on TikTok and Instagram in a way that’s feels native there,” Koebler said. “We sort of launched [on every platform] and then we scaled back slightly in terms of what we’re focusing on. We will always focus on the reporting and the stories. Getting it out to other places is a priority of ours, but if there’s not enough time in the day, we’re not going to work 20-hour days just so we can have, like, a good TikTok.”</p>
<p>“My first journalism job was at a small-town newspaper, where we didn’t even have a real digital presence, and I was interacting with sources who were also my neighbors, people I saw at the farmer’s market or the coffee shop, and they could come to the newsroom and see the newspaper getting printed,” Cole said. “That’s the kind of connection I think we want to have with our readers and subscribers. Come see how it’s made, and let us meet you where you are.”</p>
<p>The paywall will continue to evolve as the internet changes and the business grow. Right now, almost every story is free to read when it’s first published, but 404 Media is starting to put older stories behind the paywall. (FOIA reporting is an exception and “will always be free because it’s based on public documents that everyone has a right to access,” Maiberg said. Those stories often include an ask at the top for readers to subscribe or donate.)</p>
<p>One thing that will remain: The mix of in-depth investigations and shorter, voice-y blog posts. “Some viral news stories get a ton of eyeballs and a very low percentage of conversions to paid subscribers, and some deep, long investigations don’t get many eyeballs at all, but a much higher percentage of people who read those articles convert [to subscribers],” Maiberg said.</p>
<p>“At Vice, if we wrote a big investigation and not many people read it, that was kind of painful…it felt like shouting into the void,” he added. “Here, if we publish an investigation that reaches a small audience, but that audience really engages and pays for our work, it feels very good and productive.”</p>

<p>I used to be a much more conscientious scholar than I am now. I would encounter a journal article or book that was relevant to my interests but forbiddingly technical (or, if the author was a philosopher, just forbiddingly badly written, convoluted, and jargon packed), and I would beat my head against it for hours and hours, running down and checking out all the references—​a time-​consuming library job in the old days before internet links. I made it something of a point of honor to arrive at a state of confident understanding; I kept at it until I <em>owned</em> that argument. Now I give such candidates for my attention a quick skim, remembering that life is short and if this novelty is worth understanding, somebody I trust will soon explain it to me in terms I can readily digest. These days I almost always outsource the hard work of comprehension when I encounter difficulties, and the policy works wonders—​for me.</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/16880/9780393868050" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img loading="lazy" width="200" height="300" src="https://behavioralscientist.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ibt-200x300.png" alt="" srcset="https://behavioralscientist.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ibt-200x300.png 200w, https://behavioralscientist.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ibt-684x1024.png 684w, https://behavioralscientist.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ibt-768x1151.png 768w, https://behavioralscientist.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ibt.png 801w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px"></a></figure></div>



<p>Distributed understanding is a real phenomenon, but you have to get yourself into a community of communicators that can effectively summon the relevant expertise. I don’t know if other philosophers have the same policy; many of them seem to me to spend their whole careers working largely alone and grappling with a few narrow issues, voluntarily giving themselves tunnel vision. Perhaps, I think, they cannot do otherwise, given their training. After all, many scientists are in similar trenches. I once asked a promising young neuroscientist, after I’d spent hours watching him run experiments on monkeys with chronically implanted electrodes, what he thought the implications of his research might be, and his answer was “Oh Dan, I don’t have time to think!”</p>



<p>All my early due diligence was probably good for me. It got me to confront the difficulty of the questions, seeing with my own eyes the pitfalls that trap many very smart and conscientious thinkers. This injected a small dose of modesty into my growing confidence that I had found—​and partly invented—​a prodigious explanation-​device that reliably devoured difficulties, day after day. The insights (if that is what they were) that I had struggled so hard to capture in my dissertation and my first book have matured and multiplied, generating answers to questions, solutions to problems, rebuttals to objections, and—​most important—​suggestions for further questions to ask with gratifying consilience. I just turn the crank and out they pour, falling into place like the last pieces in a jigsaw puzzle. Perhaps my whole perspective is a colossal mistake—​some of my critics think so—​and perhaps its abundant fruits are chimeras.</p>



<p><em>What if I’m wrong?</em> Good thinkers frequently ask themselves this question, the way good doctors frequently check their practices against the Hippocratic oath they swore, and not just as a formulaic ritual.</p>



<blockquote><p><strong><em>What if I’m wrong?</em> Good thinkers frequently ask themselves this question, the way good doctors frequently check their practices against the Hippocratic oath they swore.</strong></p></blockquote>



<p>My favorite chapter of Mark Twain’s <em>Adventures of Tom Sawyer</em> tells of Tom’s brilliant stunt of getting his friends to pay him for the privilege of whitewashing the fence in front of his house, not just saving him a chore but enriching him. This inspired me to adopt the same strategy with my books: I invite Tufts students to help me write my books by sharing the penultimate draft with them in a seminar, where they are all encouraged to point out errors, challenge arguments, demand more clarity, and in general complain about anything that strikes them as amiss. They don’t get paid for this excellent editorial service—​in fact they are paying one of the highest rates of tuition in the country—​but they do get thanked in the preface by name, and they get an autographed copy of the book when it’s published. I believe everyone involved has been quite content with this arrangement.</p>



<p>I particularly cherish the intrepid naysayers who force me to expand, revise, or drop what I had thought were good points. Students often come to my office to discuss their term-​paper projects in my courses, and a familiar combination of ambition and anxiety is the enthusiastic student who has a Big Idea—​a Refutation of some well-​regarded claim of mine or of some other writer we have read. They’re itching to go for it, but <em>“What if I’m wrong?”</em> I have some not-​quite-​foolproof advice: take courage and set out to write up the Great Discovery; if after many hours of red-​hot thinking and writing you discover to your dismay a fatal flaw, something that you overlooked or underestimated, all is not lost. Go back to the first paragraph and write something along the lines of “It is tempting to think that . . . , because there seems to be a powerful argument to the effect that . . . , but as we shall see, this is an error.” Then make a few minor adjustments to the rest of the paper, pointing carefully to the error that you almost made, and you’re ready to submit it. If your Big Idea was tempting to you, it might well be tempting to others. Showing the field that this is a cul-​de-​sac to be avoided is a genuine contribution. The same strategy, writ large, is good advice for a whole career. Try your Big Hunch out on a few knowledgeable people; if nobody can knock it down right away, then take a leap, make a major investment of your time (bearing in mind the large cost of lost opportunities if you make a bad choice) and hope for the best. You may at least be able to salvage a definitive refutation of your hunch, all the more credible for having been composed by somebody who was initially a partisan.</p>

Go back to the first paragraph and write something along the lines of “It is tempting to think that  . . . ”</strong></p></blockquote>



<p>The Discovery Institute is the well-​funded propaganda site for Intelligent Design, as creationism is now called. I have often scoffed publicly at the dismal ratio of propaganda to peer-​reviewed science in its output and urged its directors to put their money into some real science that might, conceivably, prove them right. So when they announced in 2005 that they were setting up a serious research facility, the Biologic Institute, to do experiments aiming to refute the theory of evolution by natural selection, they asked me to express my opinion of this innovation. I wrote back that I applauded this move, since there are scads of unasked questions in evolutionary biology that are neglected by biologists simply because they’re sure they already know the answer: How did species X with feature Y come to be? It evolved, of course, but we don’t know the details. Nobody wants to sic a graduate student or postdoc on any of those questions, because the reaction among the influential workers in the field to the results would be along the lines of “Ho hum, what else is new?”—not a good way to start a career. If, however, the Biologic Institute wants to fund young scientists who are passionately committed to disproving evolution, this will harness their energy and training without our having any scruples about encouraging them to waste their precious time. They will see themselves as crusaders on a divine mission, and what could be more glorious than that? They will try to find hidden among these unasked questions embarrassing examples of “irreducible complexity” that couldn’t have evolved gradually. They will eventually discover that they’re wrong, and we will have yet further examples of evolution’s devious paths. In my terminology, their dogged search for skyhooks will uncover heretofore unimagined cranes. And precisely because their conclusions will be the opposite of what they hoped to discover, we will take them seriously. Good theories thrive on serious attempts to refute them that fail in instructive ways.</p>



<p>What, though, if <em>my</em> supposed insights are just generated by a prodigiously fertile mistake? It’s worth remembering that this has happened before, on a cosmic scale. Descartes wrote his retrospectively preposterous books—​<em>Le Monde</em> (eventually published in full in 1667) and <em>Principia Philosophiae</em> (1644)—presenting the first detailed TOE (theory of everything). He had deduced (he claimed) the truth about everything under the sun and beyond the sun, including starlight and planets, tides, volcanoes, magnets, and much, much more, most of it dead wrong. It was Newton’s majestic <em>Principia</em> (1687) that decisively refuted Descartes. Descartes’s theory of everything is, even in hindsight, remarkably coherent and persuasive. It is hard to imagine a <em>different</em> equally coherent and equally false theory! He was wrong, and so of course I may well be wrong, but enough other thinkers I respect have come to see things my way that when I ask myself, “What if <em>we</em> are wrong?” I can keep this skeptical murmur safely simmering on a back burner.</p>

	<div>
		<p><em>By Maciej Domanski, Travis Peters, and David Pokora</em></p>
<p>We identified 10 security vulnerabilities within the <a href="https://github.com/greenpau/caddy-security" target="_blank" rel="noopener">caddy-security plugin</a> for the <a href="https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Caddy</a> web server that could enable a variety of high-severity attacks in web applications, including client-side code execution, OAuth replay attacks, and unauthorized access to resources.</p>
<p>During our evaluation, Caddy was deployed as a reverse proxy to provide access to several of our internal services. We explored a plugin configuration that would allow us to handle authentication and authorization with our Google SSO so that we didn’t have to implement this on a per-app basis.</p>
<p>In this blog post, we will briefly explore the security vulnerabilities we identified in the caddy-security plugin and discuss their potential impact. As with our typical security assessments, for each issue we identified, we present a recommendation for immediately fixing the issue, as well as long-term, more strategic advice for preventing similar issues and improving the overall security posture.</p>
<p>As security experts, our goal is not only to identify vulnerabilities in specific software but also to contribute to the larger community by sharing our recommendations for fixing these problems. We believe that these recommendations can help developers overcome similar challenges in other SSO systems and improve their security.</p>
<h2>Caddy Background</h2>
<p><a href="https://caddyserver.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Caddy</a> (a.k.a. Caddy Server or Caddy 2) is a modern, open-source web server written in Golang that is designed to be easy to use and highly configurable. Caddy is built to streamline the process of hosting web applications while prioritizing security and performance. It aims to reduce the complexity associated with configuring and deploying web servers.</p>
<p>The caddy-security plugin is a middleware plugin for the Caddy web server. It provides various security-related functionalities to enhance the overall security posture of web applications. Some of the key features offered by the caddy-security plugin include an authentication plugin for implementing Form-Based, Basic, Local, LDAP, OpenID Connect, OAuth 2.0, SAML Authentication, and an authorization plugin for HTTP request authorization based on JWT/PASETO tokens.</p>
<h2>Findings</h2>
<h3>Issue #1: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)</h3>
<p><em>Severity: High</em></p>
<p>Reflected XSS occurs when an application includes untrusted data in the HTML response sent to the user’s browser. In this case, the provided <code>/admin%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.domain)%3C/script%3E/admin/login</code> or <code>/settings/mfa/delete/&lt;img%20src=x%20onerror=alert(document.domain)&gt;</code> API calls trigger an alert. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the target user’s browser, potentially leading to further attacks such as session hijacking.</p>
<p>To immediately address this issue, strategically treat all string values as potentially untrustworthy, regardless of their source, and escape them properly (using the <code>safehtml/template</code> package that generates output-safe HTML).</p>
<p>In addition to that remediation, we also suggest a few different ways to improve defense in depth:</p>
<ul>
<li>Extend unit tests with potentially malicious XSS payloads. Refer to the <a href="https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/cheat-sheet" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cross-site scripting (XSS) cheat sheet</a> for various attack vectors.</li>
<li>Consider using the Active Scanner from Burp Suite Professional in a testing environment for all API calls. Additionally, use the <a href="https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/automated-scanning/live-tasks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scanning with a live task</a> strategy to have underlying requests scanned automatically when interacting with the web interface.</li>
<li>Expand the caddy-security documentation to promote security headers—especially the Content Security Policy (CSP) header that controls which resources can be loaded by the browser, limiting the impact of potential XSS attacks.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Issue #2: Insecure Randomness</h3>
<p><em>Severity: High</em></p>
<p>The caddy-security plugin uses the <code>math/rand</code> Golang library with a seed based on the Unix timestamp to generate strings for three security-critical contexts in the application, which could possibly be predicted via a brute-force search. Attackers could use the potentially predictable nonce value used for authentication purposes in the OAuth flow to conduct OAuth replay attacks. In addition, insecure randomness is used while generating multifactor authentication (MFA) secrets and creating API keys in the database package.</p>
<p>To immediately mitigate this vulnerability, use a cryptographically secure random number generator for generating the random strings. Golang’s library <code>crypto/rand</code> is designed for secure random number generation.</p>
<p>In addition to that fix, we recommend considering the following long-term recommendations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Review the application for other instances where the <code>math/rand</code> package is used for secure context. Create secure wrapping functions and use them throughout the code to serve a cryptographically secure string with the requested length.</li>
<li>Avoid duplicating code. Having a single function, such as <code>secureRandomString</code>, rather than multiple duplicate functions makes it easier to audit and verify the system’s security. It also prevents future changes to the codebase from reintroducing issues.</li>
<li>Implement Semgrep in the CI/CD. The <code>math-random-used</code> Semgrep rule will catch instances where <code>math/rand</code> is used. Refer to our <a href="https://appsec.guide/docs/static-analysis/semgrep/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Testing Handbook on Semgrep</a> for more information.</li>
<li>Read textbooks such as <em>Real World Cryptography</em>, as it is a great resource for practical cryptographic considerations.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Issue #3: IP Spoofing via X-Forwarded-For Header</h3>
<p><em>Severity: Medium</em></p>
<p>By manipulating the <code>X-Forwarded-For</code> header, an attacker can spoof an IP address used in the user <code>identity</code> module (<code>/whoami</code> API endpoint). This could lead to unauthorized access if the system trusts this spoofed IP address.</p>
<p>To resolve this vulnerability, reimplement the application to not rely on user-provided headers when obtaining a user’s IP address. If user-provided headers are required (e.g., <code>X-Forwarded-For</code> for logging purposes), ensure the header is properly validated (i.e., the value is consistent with IP address format through regular expression) or sanitized (to avoid <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/CRLF_Injection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CRLF log injection attacks</a>, for example).</p>
<p>In addition to this immediate fix, we recommend considering these long-term recommendations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Implement appropriate checks for potential IP spoofing and <code>X-</code> headers on the unit testing level. Consider <a href="https://book.hacktricks.xyz/network-services-pentesting/pentesting-web/special-http-headers#headers-to-change-location" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other headers that can rewrite IP sources</a>.</li>
<li>Cover the IP spoofing scenarios and user-provided header processing in Golang’s native fuzz tests.</li>
<li>Use the dynamic testing approach with Burp Suite Professional and the <a href="https://portswigger.net/bappstore/17d2949a985c4b7ca092728dba871943" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Param Miner</a> extension to identify the processing of hidden headers.</li>
<li>Expand the caddy-security documentation to increase user awareness of this type of threat; show an example of misconfiguration, how to resolve, and how to test it.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Issue #4: Referer-Based Header XSS</h3>
<p><em>Severity: Medium</em></p>
<p>An XSS vulnerability can be triggered by rewriting the <code>Referer</code> header. Although the <code>Referer</code> header is sanitized by escaping some characters that can allow XSS (e.g., [<code>&amp;</code>], [<code>&lt;</code>], [<code>&gt;</code>], [<code>"</code>], [<code>'</code>]), it does not account for the attack based on the JavaScript URL scheme (e.g., <code>javascript:alert(document.domain)//</code> payload). Exploiting this vulnerability may not be trivial, but it could lead to the execution of malicious scripts in the context of the target user’s browser, compromising user sessions.</p>
<p>The mitigation for this issue is identical to issue #1.</p>
<h3>Issue #5: Open Redirection Vulnerability</h3>
<p><em>Severity: Medium</em></p>
<p>When a logged-in user clicks on a specially crafted link with a <code>redirect_url</code> parameter, the user can be redirected to an external website. The user must take an action, such as clicking on a portal button or using the browser’s back button, to trigger the redirection. This could lead to phishing attacks, where an attacker tricks users into visiting a malicious website by crafting a convincing URL.</p>
<p>To mitigate this vulnerability, perform proper <code>redirect_url</code> parameter validation to ensure that the redirection URLs are allowed only within the same domain or from trusted sources.</p>
<p>In addition, we also recommend the following long-term fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Implement robust unit tests with different bypassing scenarios of <code>redirect_url</code> parameter validation. Refer to the potential <a href="https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/ssrf-server-side-request-forgery/url-format-bypass" target="_blank" rel="noopener">URL Format Bypasses</a>. Keep in mind that different components can use different URI parsers, which can lead to <a href="https://snyk.io/blog/url-confusion-vulnerabilities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">parsing confusion</a>.</li>
<li>Use Burp Suite Professional with a scanner with both these settings enabled:
<ul>
<li>Audit coverage – maximum: to use the most extensive set of payload variations and insertion point options</li>
<li>Audit coverage – thorough: to try more payload variations</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Issue #6: X-Forwarded-Host Header Manipulation</h3>
<p><em>Severity: Medium</em></p>
<p>The caddy-security plugin processes the <code>X-Forwarded-Host</code> header, which could lead to various security vulnerabilities (web cache poisoning, business logic flaws, routing-based server-side request forgery [SSRF], and classic server-side vulnerabilities). Additionally, the caddy-security plugin generates QR codes based on this header, which extends the attack surface.</p>
<p>To mitigate this issue, do not rely on the <code>Host</code> and <code>X-Forwarded-Host</code> headers in the caddy-security plugin logic. Instead, use the current domain manually specified in the configuration file to generate a QR code.</p>
<p>In addition, we recommend the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use Burp Suite Professional with the Param Miner extension to identify the processing of hidden headers.</li>
<li>Extend the caddy-security documentation to increase user awareness of the <a href="https://portswigger.net/web-security/host-header/exploiting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HTTP <code>Host</code> header attacks</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Issue #7: X-Forwarded-Proto Header Manipulation</h3>
<p><em>Severity: Low</em></p>
<p>The processing of the <code>X-Forwarded-Proto</code> header results in redirection to the injected protocol. While this scenario may have limited impact, improper handling of such headers could result in unpredictable security risks, such as bypass of security mechanisms or confusion in handling TLS.</p>
<p>To address this issue, do not rely on the <code>X-Forwarded-Proto</code> header. If it is required, validate the value of the <code>X-Forwarded-Proto</code> header against an allowlist of accepted protocols (e.g., HTTP/HTTPS) and reject unexpected values.</p>
<p>In addition, consider the long-term recommendations from issue #3.</p>
<h3>Issue #8: 2FA Bypass by Brute-Forcing Verification Codes</h3>
<p><em>Severity: Low</em></p>
<p>The current implementation of the application’s two-factor authentication (2FA) lacks sufficient protection against brute-force attacks. Although the application blocks the user after several failed attempts to provide 2FA codes, attackers can bypass this blocking mechanism by automating the application’s full multistep 2FA process.</p>
<p>To address this issue effectively, enforce a minimum six-digit code length in the MFA configuration. Additionally, to reduce the risk of automated brute-forcing, implement an account locking mechanism that triggers after a specified number of invalid 2FA code attempts. Finally, enforce reauthentication for critical actions involving sensitive account information or security settings. For actions such as changing passwords or disabling 2FA, users should be required to reauthenticate, either with their password or a 2FA token. An exception can be made for reauthentication if the user has logged in within the last 10 minutes. Check out <a href="https://blog.trailofbits.com/2019/06/20/getting-2fa-right-in-2019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Getting 2FA Right in 2019</a> at the Trail of Bits Blog for more information.</p>
<h3>Issue #9: Lack of User Session Invalidation on Logout</h3>
<p><em>Severity: Low</em></p>
<p>The caddy-security plugin lacks proper user session invalidation upon clicking the “Sign Out” button; user sessions remain valid even after requests are sent to <code>/logout</code> and <code>/oauth2/google/logout</code>. Attackers who gain access to an active but supposedly logged-out session can perform unauthorized actions on behalf of the user.</p>
<p>To address this issue, review the sign-out process to identify the cause of the unexpected behavior. Ensure that the <code>/oauth2/google/logout</code> endpoint correctly terminates the user session and invalidates the associated tokens.</p>
<p>For more defense in depth, use the <a href="https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS/blob/master/4.0/en/0x12-V3-Session-management.md#v3-session-management" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (V3 Session Management)</a> to check whether the implementation handles sessions securely.</p>
<h3>Issue #10: Multiple Panics when Parsing Caddyfile</h3>
<p><em>Severity: Low</em></p>
<p>Multiple parsing functions do not validate whether their input values are <code>nil</code> before attempting to access elements, which can lead to a panic (<code>index</code> <code>out</code> <code>of</code> <code>range</code>). Panics during the parsing of a Caddyfile may not be perceived as immediate vulnerabilities, but they could indicate improperly enforced security controls (e.g., insufficient data validation), which could lead to issues in other code paths.</p>
<p>To address these issues, integrate <code>nil</code> checks for input values before element access across all relevant functions.</p>
<p>To prevent similar issues of this type, add Golang’s native fuzz tests for Caddyfile parsing functions.</p>
<h2>Golang Security for the Community</h2>
<p>We <em>love</em> writing and reviewing Golang codebases at Trail of Bits. Indeed, we are constantly working on Golang-related <a href="https://appsec.guide/docs/static-analysis/semgrep/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Semgrep) resources</a>, <a href="https://github.com/trailofbits/semgrep-rules/tree/main/go" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rules</a>, and <a href="https://blog.trailofbits.com/?s=go&amp;submit=Search" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog posts</a> and look forward to any opportunity to take on pet audits (like this) and <a href="https://github.com/trailofbits/publications#security-reviews">client projects</a> where we examine Golang codebases.</p>
<p>Our aim in publishing our findings is to help protect others who may consider implementing a solution similar to the one we explored and to help them make informed decisions about their security infrastructure.</p>
<p>If you’re actively implementing a codebase in Golang or have questions, concerns, or other recommendations on open-source software you think we should look at, please <a href="https://www.trailofbits.com/contact/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contact us</a>.</p>

<p>On January 29, Amazon started showing <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/09/amazon-jacks-up-price-of-ad-free-prime-video-by-2-99-starting-in-2024/">ads to Prime Video subscribers</a> in the US unless they pay an additional $2.99 per month. But this wasn't the only change to the service. Those who don't pay up also lose features; their accounts no longer support Dolby Vision or Dolby Atmos.</p>
<p>As noticed by German tech outlet <a href="https://www.4kfilme.de/amazon-prime-video-entfernt-dolby-atmos-und-dolby-vision-im-werbefinanzierten-abo/">4K Filme</a> on Sunday, Prime Video users who choose to sit through ads can no longer use Dolby Vision or Atmos while streaming. Ad-tier subscribers are limited to HDR10+ and Dolby Digital 5.1.</p>
<p>4K Filme confirmed that this was the case on TVs from both LG and Sony; <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnarcher/2024/02/11/amazon-prime-videos-new-ads-based-subscription-has-a-surprise/?sh=b2396657cd51">Forbes</a> also confirmed the news using a <a href="https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65c8ed7ffc888dc89a418c08/AmazonStoryJackRyanPics/960x0.jpg?format=jpg&amp;width=1440">TCL TV</a>.</p>
<p>"In the ads-free account, the TV throws up its own confirmation boxes to say that the show is playing in Dolby Vision HDR and Dolby Atmos. In the basic, with-ads account, however, the TV’s Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos pop-up boxes remain stubbornly absent," Forbes said.</p>
<p>Amazon hasn't explained its reasoning for the feature removal, but it may be trying to cut back on licensing fees paid to Dolby Laboratories. Amazon may also hope to push HDR10+, a Dolby Vision competitor that's free and open. It also remains possible that we could one day see the return of Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos to the ad tier through a refreshed licensing agreement.</p>
<p>Amazon has had a back-and-forth history with supporting Dolby features. In 2016, it first made Dolby Vision available on Prime Video. In 2017, though, Prime Video stopped supporting the format in favor of HDR10+. Amazon announced the HDR10+ format alongside Samsung, and it subsequently made the entire Prime Video library available in HDR10+. But in 2022, Prime Video started offering content like <em><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/08/amazon-tries-to-take-over-pirate-sites-that-sold-dvd-copies-of-rings-of-power/">The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power</a></em> in Dolby Vision once again.</p>                                            
                                                        
<h2>Amazon wasn’t upfront about removals</h2>
<p>Amazon announced in September 2023 that it would run ads on Prime Video accounts in 2024; in December, Amazon confirmed that the ads would start <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2023/12/youll-be-paying-extra-for-ad-free-prime-video-come-january/">running on January 29</a> unless subscribers paid extra. In the interim, Amazon failed to mention that it was also removing support for Dolby Vision and Atmos from the ad-supported tier.</p>
<p>Forbes first reported on Prime Video's ad-based tier not supporting Dolby Vision and Atmos by assuming that it was a technical error. Not until after Forbes published its article did Amazon officially confirm the changes. That's not how people subscribing to a tech giant's service expect to learn about a diminishing of their current plan.</p>
<p>It also seems that Amazon's removal of the Dolby features has been done in such a way that it could lead some users to think they're getting Dolby Vision and Atmos support even when they're not.</p>
<p>As Forbes' John Archer reported, "To add a bit of confusion to the mix, on the TCL TV I used, the Prime Video header information for the<em> Jack Ryan</em> show that appears on the with-ads basic account shows Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos among the supported technical features—yet when you start to play the episode, neither feature is delivered to the TV."</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/02/new-streaming-app-from-fox-disney-wbd-is-about-more-than-sports/">streaming services</a> overtake traditional media, many customers are growing increasingly discouraged by how the industry seems to be evolving into something strongly reminiscent of cable. While there are some aspects of old-school TV <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24070601/super-bowl-streaming-delay-spoilers">worth emulating</a>, others—like confusing plans that don’t make it clear what you get with each package—are not.</p>
<p>Amazon didn't respond to questions Ars Technica sent in time for publication, but we'll update this story if we hear back.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.amorphousdata.com/blog/time-series-vs-regression">https://www.amorphousdata.com/blog/time-series-vs-regression</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39350866">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The application of historical data for predicting future outcomes is pivotal across various domains, encompassing revenue projections, weather forecasts, stock market trends, sports predictions, and beyond. This dependence on predictive analytics relies on extracting valuable insights from historical data, addressing diverse forecasting challenges.</p>
<p>To predict future outcomes, a predictive model is built from historical data.  Over the past few years, I’ve built dozens of predictive models using a range of techniques, from simple to complex, and from spreadsheets to machine learning. In this post, I’ll discuss the general strategies employed to build predictive models. (If you’re a data scientist, you might scoff at how I’m defining things because you’ve read <a href="https://otexts.com/fpp3/">Forecasting: Principles and Practice</a> backwards and forwards. That’s OK. The book is great!)</p>
<h2 id="time-series-forecasting">Time series forecasting</h2>
<p>Time series data is data that is collected or recorded sequentially over time. Each data point in a time series dataset is associated with a timestamp. Time series forecasting is a crucial analytical approach applied to such data, aiming to predict future values or trends based on the historical patterns observed. By leveraging the temporal order of the data, time series forecasting methods can capture and analyze trends, seasonality, and other recurring patterns to make informed predictions about future developments.</p>
<p>Imagine we are forecasting electricity ⚡ demand for a town using a Simple Moving Average (SMA). We observe the electricity usage for the past 30 days, and each day, we calculate the average demand over that period. For instance, on day one, we take the average of the demand over the last 30 days. The next day, we recalculate the average by incorporating the newest day’s data and excluding the oldest. This dynamic approach allows us to consider recent trends and fluctuations in electricity demand. If, over the past 30 days, the demand has fluctuated between 3.4 MwH/day and 3.6 MwH/day, our SMA forecast for the next day would be a more adaptive estimate, considering the evolving pattern of demand over time.</p>
<p>Most people have likely used SMA to do time series forecasting, without necessarily using the term SMA. The benefit of SMA is that it creates a simple and intuitive predictive model, making it accessible for quick estimations and general trend observations. However, the tradeoffs of SMA are notable. SMA tends to smooth out extreme fluctuations, making it less responsive to sudden changes or outliers in the data. Additionally, it may lag behind abrupt shifts in the underlying pattern of the time series.</p>
<p>To address these problems, most forecasters end up using a more sophisticated strategy. Exponential Moving Average (EMA), which assigns different weights to recent data points, giving more importance to the most recent observations. This makes EMA more responsive to changes compared to SMA. Autoregressive integrated moving average (<a href="https://otexts.com/fpp3/arima.html">ARIMA</a>) is another popular strategy that works particularly well on time series data that has seasonality trends.</p>
<h2 id="regression-analysis">Regression analysis</h2>
<p>Regression analysis also relies on historical data, but it differs in its approach and objectives. In this method, the emphasis is on establishing a mathematical relationship between the input variables and the corresponding output variable. Unlike time series forecasting, where the primary goal is to predict future values based on temporal patterns, supervised regression aims to understand and quantify the relationships between variables. Through the training of a regression model on historical data, the algorithm learns to generalize and predict outcomes for new, unseen data points.</p>
<p>Again, using the electrical ⚡ demand forecasting scenario, instead of using SMA to predict the demand, we could use regression analysis to look at independent variables such as the daily temperature and day of the week. We could then build a predictive model where the historical electrical demand serves as the dependent variable, and daily temperature and day of the week act as predictors. This approach allows us to capture not only the historical patterns but also the influence of external factors on electricity consumption. For instance, the model might reveal that higher temperatures are associated with increased demand for cooling systems, or that certain days of the week exhibit distinct usage patterns. By considering these variables, regression analysis provides a more nuanced and context-specific prediction, enhancing the accuracy and interpretability of our forecasting model for electrical demand.</p>
<p>Regression analysis is not a free lunch, however. In addition to greater complexity, regression analysis is heavily dependent on the selected independent variables and how each of these variables is encoded. This process is typically called “feature engineering”, and is part art and part science. Choices on including or excluding certain variables, and how they are translated into numerical parameters, can significantly impact the model’s performance.</p>
<h2 id="time-series-forecasting-with-covariates">Time series forecasting with covariates</h2>
<p>Time series forecasting with covariates combines elements of regression analysis with time series forecasting. In this approach, the traditional time series models is enhanced by incorporating additional independent variables, known as covariates or exogenous variables. These covariates may include external factors such as economic indicators, environmental conditions, or other relevant variables that influence the time series behavior. By integrating these covariates into the forecasting model, practitioners can capture more nuanced relationships and improve the accuracy of predictions, especially in situations where external factors play a significant role in shaping the time series patterns.</p>
<p>Using the electrical ⚡ demand forecasting scenario, we first compute the historical SMA (e.g., a 30 day moving average) over the course of a year. We then examine the correlation between the SMA values and temperature, and calculate an adjustment factor to the SMA values based on temperature. Our final predictive model then takes historical consumption data, computes the 30 day moving average, and applies an adjustment factor to the SMA based on forecasted temperature.</p>
<p>While adding covariates to a time series forecast can improve accuracy, the feature engineering required for a successful model is even more complex and requires additional experimentation. Each independent variable needs to be mapped to the same time series. For example, temperature varies over the course of the day, so should we use the temperature at noon? The average temperature for a day? In addition, the dynamic nature of data demands continuous updates and adjustments to the predictive model to account for changing patterns and relationships.</p>
<h2 id="other-strategies-for-predictive-models">Other strategies for predictive models</h2>
<p>There are other techniques for building predictive models from historical data. These include <a href="https://facebook.github.io/prophet/">Facebook Prophet</a> and various forms of deep learning models (e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_short-term_memory">LSTMs</a>, a type of neural network, are a popular architecture for time series forecasting). In general, these strategies, while exciting, require significant engineering to outperform standard regression analysis or ARIMA forecasting techniques. That said, in cases where accuracy truly matters, ensemble approaches that combine multiple techniques can produce superior results. Uber used a <a href="https://www.uber.com/blog/m4-forecasting-competition/">hybrid exponential smoothing combined with a neural network</a> model to predict driver supply and demand with very strong results.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>When I started building predictive models, I frequently conflated time series forecasting and regression analysis. I realized that this was because both of these approaches predict a numerical output … but that’s where the similarities end. Understanding these different strategies, and how they apply to your data, is the first step to unlocking the power of predictive models.</p>
<p>In my next article, I’ll talk about applying these different strategies to B2B analytics. In the meantime, if you have a bunch of B2B data that you want to analyze and don’t know where to start, please send an email to <a href="mailto:info@amorphousdata.com">info@amorphousdata.com</a> 😀.</p>

My five year old daughter came home from kindergarten a few months ago, and told my partner and I that math was stupid (!). We have since been working (so far successfully) to make her more excited about all things math, and more proud of her math accomplishments. One success we've had is that she is now very interested in fractals in general, and in particular enjoys watching deep zoom videos into [Mandelbrot](https://youtu.be/8cgp2WNNKmQ?si=PD7W2q4qDNY9AgzD) and [Mandelbulb](https://youtu.be/BLmAV6O_ea0?si=4iyAFMgzde0mTmsq) fractal sets, and eating [romanesco broccoli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanesco_broccoli). 
My daughter's interest has made me think a lot about fractals, and about the ways in which fractals relate to a passion of mine, which is artificial neural networks. 

I've realized that there are similarities between the way in which many fractals are generated, and the way in which we train neural networks. 
Both involve repeatedly applying a function to its own output. 
In both cases, that function has hyperparameters that control its behavior. 
In both cases the repeated function application can produce outputs that either diverge to infinity or remain happily bounded depending on those hyperparameters. 
Fractals are often defined by the boundary between hyperparameters where function iteration diverges or remains bounded.

Motivated by these similarities, I looked for fractal structure in the hyperparameter lanscapes of neural network training. And I found it! The boundary between hyperparameters for which neural network training succeeds or fails has (gorgeous, organic) fractal structure. Details, and beautiful videos, below.
  
For a more technical presentation, see the short paper [*The boundary of neural network trainability is fractal*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06184).

# Neural network training and hyperparameters

In order to train an artificial neural network, we iteratively update its parameters to make it perform better. We often do this by performing [gradient descent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent) steps on a loss function. The loss function is a measure of the neural network's performance. By descending the loss by gradient descent, we find values of the parameters for which the neural network performs well.

Training depends on *hyperparameters*, which specify details about how parameter update steps should be performed and how the network should be initialized. For instance, one common hyperparameter is the learning rate, which sets the magnitude of the update we make to the model’s parameters at every training step.

If the learning rate is too large, then the parameter update steps are too large. This causes the parameters to diverge (grow towards infinity) during training, and as a result causes the training loss to become very bad. If the learning rate is too small, the training steps are too short, and it takes a very large number of training steps to train the neural network. Requiring a very large number of training steps makes training slow and expensive. In practice, we often want to make the learning rate as large as possible, without making it so large that the parameters diverge.

# Visualizing the hyperparameter landscape

We can visualize how adjusting hyperparameters (like the learning rate) affects how quickly a neural network either trains or diverges. In the following image, each pixel corresponds to training the same neural network from the same initialization on the same data -- but with *different hyperparameters*. Blue-green colors mean that training *converged* for those hyperparameters, and the network successfully trained. Red-yellow colors mean that training *diverged* for those hyperparameters. The paler the color the faster the convergence or divergence

The neural network I used in this experiment is small and simple; it consists of an input layer, a $\operatorname{tanh}$ nonlinearity, and an output layer[^netdetails]. In the image, the x-coordinate changes the learning rate for the input layer’s parameters, and the y-coordinate changes the learning rate for the output layer’s parameters.

![Figure [p_ml]: **Hyperparameter landscape: A visualization of how neural network training success depends on learning rate hyperparameters.** Each pixel corresponds to a training run with the specified input and output layer learning rates. Training runs shown in blue-green converged, while training runs shown in red-yellow diverged.[^saturation] Hyperparameters leading to the best performance (lightest blue-green) are typically very close to hyperparameters for which training diverges, so the boundary region is of particular interest.](/assets/fractal/zoom_sequence_width-16_depth-2_datasetparamratio-1.0_minibatch-None_nonlinearity-tanh_phasespace-lr_vs_lr_step-0.png width="444px" border="1")

The best performing hyperparameters -- those that are shown with the palest blue-green shade, and for which the neural network trains the most quickly -- are near the boundary between hyperparameters for which training converges and for which it diverges. This is a general property. The best hyperparameters for neural network training are usually very near the edge of stability. For instance, as suggested above, the best learning rate in a grid search is typically the largest learning rate for which training converges rather than diverges.

# The boundary of neural network trainability is fractal

Because it is where we find the best hyperparameters, the boundary between hyperparameters that lead to converging or diverging training is of particular interest to us. Let’s take a closer look at it. Play the following video (I recommend playing it full screen, and increasing the playback resolution):

<p>
    <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/903855670?h=ca2b077023&amp;badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="1" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" title="0"></iframe>
</p>

As we zoom into the boundary between hyperparameter configurations where training succeeds (blue) and fails (red), we find intricate structure at every scale. The boundary of neural network trainability is fractal! 
<big>🤯</big> (If you watched the video to the end, you saw it turn blocky in the last frames. During network training I used the $\operatorname{float64}$ numeric type, which stores numbers with around 16 decimal digits of precision. The blockiness is what happens when we zoom in so far that we need more than 16 digits of precision to tell pixels apart.)

This behavior is general. We see fractals if we change the data, change the architecture, or change the hyperparameters we look at. The fractals look qualitatively different for different choices though. Network and training design decisions also have artistic consequences! 

![Figure [paper]: **Neural network training produces fractals in all of the experimental configurations I tried.** The figure is taken from the [companion paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06184), and shows a region of the fractal resulting from each experimental condition. Experimental conditions changed the nonlinearity in the network, changed the dataset size, changed between minibatch and full batch training, and changed the hyperparameters we look at.](/assets/fractal/fractal_tiles_midres.png width="444px" border="1")

Here are the remaining fractal zoom videos for the diverse configurations summarized in Figure [paper]. You can find code for these experiments in [this colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Sohl-Dickstein/fractal/blob/main/the_boundary_of_neural_network_trainability_is_fractal.ipynb)[^beware].

- **Changing the activation function to the identity function:** i.e. the network is a deep linear network, with no nonlinearity.

- **Change the activation function to $\operatorname{ReLU}$:** This is a neat fractal, since the piecewise linear structure of the $\operatorname{ReLU}$ is visually apparent in the straight lines dividing regions of the fractal.

- **Train with a dataset size of 1:** i.e. only train on a single datapoint. Other experiments have a number of training datapoints which is the same as the free parameter count of the model.

</p>
  
- **Look at different hyperparameters:** I add a hyperparameter which sets the mean value of the neural network weights at initialization. I visualize training success in terms of this weight initialization hyperparameter (*x-axis*) and a single learning rate hyperparameter (*y-axis*). Other experiments visualize training success in terms of learning rate hyperparameters for each layer. This fractal is **extra pretty** -- I like how it goes through cycles where what seems like noise is resolved to be structure at a higher resolution.

# This isn’t so strange after all

Now that I’ve shown you something surprising and beautiful, let me tell you why we should have expected it all along. In an academic paper I would put this section first, and tell the story as if I knew fractals would be there -- but of course I didn't know what I would find until I ran the experiment!

## Fractals result from repeated iteration of a function

One common way to make a fractal is to iterate a function repeatedly, and identify boundaries where the behavior of the iterated function changes. We can refer to these boundaries as bifurcation boundaries of the iterated function; the dynamics bifurcate at this boundary, in that function iteration leads to dramatically different sequences on either side of the boundary.

For instance, to generate the Mandelbrot set, we iterate the function $f( z; c ) = z^2 + c$ over and over again. The Mandelbrot fractal is the bifurcation boundary between the values of $c$ in the complex plane for which this iterated function diverges, and for which it remains bounded. The parameter $c$ is a (hyper)parameter of the function $f( z; c )$, similarly to how learning rates are hyperparameters for neural network training.

![Figure [mandelbrot fractal]: **The Mandelbrot fractal is generated by iterating a simple function, similar to the way in which update steps are iterated when training a neural network.** 
The image is color coded by whether iterations started at a point diverge (red-yellow colors) or remain bounded (blue-green colors). 
The boundary between the diverging and bounded regions is fractal. 
This image was generated by [this colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Sohl-Dickstein/fractal/blob/main/the_boundary_of_neural_network_trainability_is_fractal.ipynb).](/assets/fractal/mandelbrot_midres.png width="444px" border="1")

Other examples of fractals which are formed by bifurcation boundaries include [magnet fractals](https://paulbourke.net/fractals/magnet/), [Lyapunov fractals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyapunov_fractal), the [quadratic Julia set](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/JuliaSet.html), and the [Burning Ship fractal](Burning Ship fractal).

## Fractals can result from optimization

One particularly relevant class of bifurcation fractals are [Newton fractals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton_fractal). These are generated by iterating Newton's method to find the roots of a polynomial. 
[Newton's method is an optimization algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method_in_optimization). Newton fractals are thus a proof of principle that fractals can result from iterating steps of an optimization algorithm.

![Figure [newton fractal]: **Newton fractals, like the one shown, are formed by iterating Newton's method to find roots of a polynomial, and color coding initial conditions by the specific root the iterates converge to.** Newton fractals are a proof of principle that optimization can generate a fractal, since Newton's method is an optimization procedure. They motivate the idea of fractal behavior resulting from training (i.e. optimizing) a neural network.](/assets/fractal/Julia_set_for_the_rational_function.png width="444px" border="1")

## Artificial neural networks are trained by repeatedly iterating a function

When we train a neural network by iterating steps of gradient descent, we are iterating a fixed function, the same as for Mandelbrot, Newton, and other fractals. 
Like for Newton fractals, this fixed function corresponds to an optimization algorithm. 
Specifically, when we train a neural network using steepest gradient descent with a constant learning rate, we iterate the fixed function
$f(\theta; \eta ) = \theta( \eta ) - \eta\, g( \theta )$.
Here $\eta$ is the learning rate hyperparameter, $\theta$ are the parameters of the neural network, and $g( \theta )$ is the gradient of the loss function.

There are many differences between neural network training and traditional fractal generation. The fractals I just discussed all involve iterating a function of a single (complex valued) number. 
The equation definining the iterated function is short and simple, and takes less than a line of text to write down. 
On the other hand, neural network training iterates a function for all the parameters in the neural network. Some neural networks have trillions of parameters, which means the input and output of the iterated function is described with *trillions* of numbers, one for each parameter. The equation for a neural network training update is similarly far more complex than the function which is iterated for traditional fractals; it would require many lines, or possibly many pages, to write down the parameter update equations for a large neural network.

Nonetheless, training a neural network can be seen as a scaled up version of the type of iterative process that generates traditional fractals. 
We should not be surprised that it produces fractals in a similar way to simpler iterative processes.[^symmetry]

# Closing thoughts

## Meta-learning is hard

Meta-learning is a research area that I believe will transform AI over the next several years. In meta-learning we *learn* aspects of AI pipelines which are traditionally hand designed. For instance, we might meta-train functions to 
initialize, 
[optimize](https://github.com/google/learned_optimization/tree/main/learned_optimization/research/general_lopt), 
or regularize neural networks. If deep learning has taught us one thing, it's that with enough compute and data, trained neural networks can outperform and replace hand-designed heuristics; in meta-learning, we apply the same lesson to replace the hand-designed heuristics we use to train the neural networks themselves. 
Meta-learning is the reason I became interested in hyperparameter landscapes.

The fractal hyperparameter landscapes we saw above help us understand some of the challenges we face in meta-learning.
The process of meta-training usually involves optimizing hyperparameters (or meta-parameters) by gradient descent. 
The loss function we perform meta-gradient-descent on is called the meta-loss. 
The fractal landscapes we have been visualizing are also meta-loss landscapes; we are visually how well training succeeds (or fails) as we change hyperparameters. 
In practice, we often find the meta-loss atrocious to work with. It is often *chaotic* in the hyperparameters, which makes it [very difficult to descend](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.10180)[^meta-descent]. 
Our results suggest a more nuanced and also more general perspective; meta-loss landscapes are chaotic because they are fractal. At every length scale, small changes in the hyperparameters can lead to large changes in training dynamics.

![Figure [meta landscape]: **Chaotic meta-loss landscapes make meta-learning challenging.** The image shows an example meta-loss landscape for a learned optimizer, with darker colors corresponding to better meta-loss. The two axes correspond to two of the meta-parameters of the learned optimizer (similar to the visualization in Figure [p_ml], where axes correspond to two hyperparameters). See [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.10180) for details. This meta-loss landscape is difficult to meta-train on, since steepest gradient descent will become stuck in valleys or local minima, and because the gradients of the rapidly changing meta-loss function are exceptionally high variance.](/assets/fractal/meta-loss-landscape.png width="444px" border="1")

## Fractals are beautiful and relaxing

Recent AI projects I have collaborated on have felt freighted with historical significance. We are building tools that will change people's lives, and maybe bend the arc of history, for both [better and worse](/2023/09/10/diversity-ai-risk.html). This is incredibly exciting! But it is often also stressful.

This project on the other hand ... was just fun. I started the project because my daughter thought fractals were mesmerizing, and I think the final results are gorgeous. I hope you enjoy it in the same spirit!

[^netdetails]: </p><p>In more detail, the baseline neural network architecture, design, and training configuration is as follows:

- Two layer fully connected neural network, with 16 units in the input and hidden layers, and with no bias parameters. The only parameters are the input layer weight matrix, and the output layer weight matrix.
- $\operatorname{tanh}$ nonlinearity in the single hidden layer
- Mean square error loss
- Fixed random training dataset, with number of datapoints the same as the number of free parameters in the network
- Full batch steepest descent training, with a constant learning rate
- **A different learning rate for each layer.** That is rather than training the input and output layer weight matrices with the same learning rate, each weight matrix has its own learning rate hyperparameter.

All experiments change one aspect of this configuration, except for the baseline experiment, which follows this configuration without change. If you want even more detail, see the [arXiv note](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06184) or the [colab notebook I used for all experiments](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Sohl-Dickstein/fractal/blob/main/the_boundary_of_neural_network_trainability_is_fractal.ipynb).
</p>

[^saturation]: The discerning reader may have noticed that training diverges when the output learning rate is made large, but that if the input learning rate is made large, performance worsens but nothing diverges. This is due to the $\operatorname{tanh}$ nonlinearity saturating. When the input learning rate is large, the input weights become large, the hidden layer pre-activations become large, and the $\operatorname{tanh}$ units saturate (their outpus grow very close to either -1 or 1). The output layer can still train on the (essentially frozen) $[-1, 1]$ activations from the first layer, and so some learning can still occur.

[^beware]: Like the fractals, the research code in the colab has vibes of layered organic complexity ... user beware!

[^symmetry]: Many fractals are generated by iterating simple functions, such as low order polynomials, or ratios of low order polynomials. Iterating these simple functions often generates simple symmetries, that are visually obvious when looking at the resulting fractals. The fractals resulting from neural networks are more organic, with fewer visually obvious symmetries. This is likely due to the higher complexity of the iterated functions themselves, as well as the many random parameters in the function definitions, stemming from the random initialization of the neural network and random training data.

[^meta-descent]: My collaborators and I have done more research into how to optimize a chaotic meta-loss. Especially see the papers: [*Unbiased Gradient Estimation in Unrolled Computation Graphs with Persistent Evolution Strategies*](https://icml.cc/virtual/2021/poster/10175), and [*Variance-Reduced Gradient Estimation via Noise-Reuse in Online Evolution Strategies*](https://openreview.net/forum?id=VhbV56AJNt).

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>The FCC's updated reporting requirements mean telcos in America will have just seven days to officially disclose that a criminal has broken into their systems.</p>
<p>After releasing a <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/02/12/2024-01667/data-breach-reporting-requirements" rel="nofollow">proposed</a> rule in early January and giving the industry 30 days to respond, the FCC's <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/02/12/2024-01667/data-breach-reporting-requirements" rel="nofollow">final rule</a> was published today. It solidifies what the agency proposed a little more than a month ago, and what was teased in early 2022 when FCC chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/01/13/fcc_data_rules/">drafted initial changes</a> to the commission's 16-year old security "breach" reporting duties.</p>
<p>Along with requiring that attacks are reported to the FCC within seven days of a telco discovering them, the same deadline now exists to report any data leaks to the FBI and US Secret Service as well. As the FCC planned, the new rule also eliminates the mandatory seven-day waiting period for reporting break-ins to consumers.</p>

    

<p>The FCC now "requires carriers to notify customers of breaches of covered data without unreasonable delay … and in no case more than 30 days following reasonable determination of a breach."&nbsp;</p>

        


        

<p>"Reasonable determination" of a data blurt is further defined as "when the carrier has information indicating that it is more likely than not that there was a breach" and "does not mean reaching a conclusion regarding every fact surrounding a data security incident that may constitute a breach."</p>
<p>In other words, if customers are affected then they had better be notified post-haste.</p>

        

<p>The FCC has additionally extended the scope of data exposure types that telecom customers must be notified of. Prior to the passage of the new rule customers only had to be told if Customer proprietary network information (CPNI) was exposed to the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>CPNI, for those unfamiliar, is all the data a cellular carrier retains about phone calls and service agreements - i.e., the data that appears on a bill. Personal identifiable information (PII) wasn't included in previous reporting requirements, meaning carriers whose customer records were exposed, didn't have to tell customers if CPNI wasn't accessed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Without an FCC rule requiring breach notifications for the above categories of PII, there would be no requirement in Federal law that telecommunications carriers report non-CPNI breaches to their customers," the FCC said of the new rule.&nbsp;</p>

        

<p>Starting now, names, government ID numbers, data used for authentication purposes, email addresses/passwords and biometric data is all included in the FCC's reporting requirements. Dissociated data, if linkable to an individual using other data criminals accessed during a break-in, has to be reported as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new rules add an exception for customer notifications as well. If a carrier can "determine that no harm to customers is reasonably likely to occur," then it doesn't have to inform subscribers of the incident.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Along with increased reporting rules for the content of data leaks, the new rule also expands the FCC's definition of "breach" to include "inadvertent access, use or disclosure of customer information."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Inadvertent, much like the exposure of 63k employee records <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/02/06/verizon_internal_privacy_breach/">Verizon reported</a> last week.</p>
<p>Luckily for Verizon it won't have to worry about falling foul of the new rules, which don't go into effect until March 13.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Telecom relay service providers, which provide assistance for hearing-impaired phone users, will be covered under the new rule as well.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Here a breach, there a breach, everywhere a breach report</h3>
<p>The FCC's updated directive is the latest in a string of federal agency breach reporting requirements, with rules passed by the <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/10/31/ftc_30_day_breach_disclosure/">FTC</a> and <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/26/sec_reporting_security/">SEC</a> set to go into effect later this year, and federal contractors getting their own set of <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/02/08/us_tech_industry_changes/">newly-proposed IT security breach reporting rules</a> too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As has been the case with those other rules, the FCC's requirements, when formally proposed last month, ran up against opposition.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/01/18/cyber_safety_review_board_rethink/">Future of America's Cyber Safety Review Board hangs in balance amid calls for rethink</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/02/02/ftc_blackbaud_settlement/">Blackbaud settles with FTC after that IT breach exposed millions of people's info</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/02/12/infosec_news_roundup/">Mon Dieu! Nearly half the French population have data nabbed in massive breach</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/04/11/in_brief_security/">40% of IT security pros say they've been told not to report a data leak</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Per the FCC, the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association raised an objection on several grounds, including that the FCC rule would create a system of dual jurisdiction between the FCC and FTC once the latter's rule goes into effect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As has been the case with objections raised to the wide and varying data leak reporting requirements now enacted by the US federal government, the FCC said it finds industry objections "unpersuasive."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Congress has even raised objections to some of the new reporting rules, with bills <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/02/01/senate_resolution_to_undo_sec/">introduced</a> in the House and Senate to overturn the SEC's four-day reporting deadline for data break-ins that could have a "material" effect on a company's finances and, by extension, its investors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The feds were generally dismissive of the complaints, with the Biden administration saying it would veto any attempts to undo the SEC's reporting rules.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Industry figures, and congressional representatives, have pointed to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency's <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/topics/cyber-threats-and-advisories/information-sharing/cyber-incident-reporting-critical-infrastructure-act-2022-circia" rel="nofollow">forthcoming</a> rules for security breach requirements as a potential inter-agency standard. It's not clear whether CISA's rules, a draft of which is expected to be published next month, will harmonize standards or otherwise eliminate the need for companies covered under multiple rules to make multiple reports.&nbsp;®</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>(InvestigateTV) — It’s been one year since <a href="https://www.cleveland19.com/2024/02/01/east-palestine-1-year-later-part-1-crisis-starts-with-spark/">a train derailment in Ohio</a> thrust the issue of rail safety back into the national spotlight. Congressional lawmakers immediately introduced legislation designed to protect Americans and hold rail companies accountable. But the longest-serving woman in Congressional history says little has changed since the disaster.</p><p><a href="https://kaptur.house.gov/">U.S. Representative Marcy Kaptur</a>, D-Ohio, talked with InvestigateTV on Capitol Hill in advance of the February 3rd anniversary of the <a href="https://www.cleveland19.com/news/derailed-east-palestine/">crisis in East Palestine</a>, saying of the rail industry, “It’s like they’re a power unto themselves. And they’re very, very - in my opinion - destructive to the country in the way they’re behaving.”</p><p>Kaptur, who’s held Congressional office since 1983, pulled no punches as she talked about the ripple effects of the massive incident that forced the evacuation of more than 1,000 people last February. The evacuation came after a Norfolk Southern train carrying hazardous materials derailed in eastern Ohio near the Pennsylvania border, with toxic chemicals contaminating the air, water, and soil all around the area.</p><figure><p><img alt="A photo from the NTSB investigative file shows the aftermath of a massive 2023 train..." loading="lazy" src="https://gray-wlbt-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/LSZAOIG64FGQNNTF6HFUERCXEQ.jpg?auth=9481a340eb1edd3339d29b73f7b1bfead78386d8e5c9c57e6815b30d0df8bb0b&amp;width=980&amp;height=551&amp;smart=true" width="980" height="551" srcset="https://gray-wlbt-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/LSZAOIG64FGQNNTF6HFUERCXEQ.jpg?auth=9481a340eb1edd3339d29b73f7b1bfead78386d8e5c9c57e6815b30d0df8bb0b&amp;width=540&amp;height=303&amp;smart=true 540w, https://gray-wlbt-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/LSZAOIG64FGQNNTF6HFUERCXEQ.jpg?auth=9481a340eb1edd3339d29b73f7b1bfead78386d8e5c9c57e6815b30d0df8bb0b&amp;width=720&amp;height=404&amp;smart=true 720w, https://gray-wlbt-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/LSZAOIG64FGQNNTF6HFUERCXEQ.jpg?auth=9481a340eb1edd3339d29b73f7b1bfead78386d8e5c9c57e6815b30d0df8bb0b&amp;width=980&amp;height=551&amp;smart=true 980w, https://gray-wlbt-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/LSZAOIG64FGQNNTF6HFUERCXEQ.jpg?auth=9481a340eb1edd3339d29b73f7b1bfead78386d8e5c9c57e6815b30d0df8bb0b&amp;width=1300&amp;height=730&amp;smart=true 1300w"></p><figcaption><span>A photo from the NTSB investigative file shows the aftermath of a massive 2023 train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio</span><span>(NTSB)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Within weeks congressional lawmakers proposed bipartisan <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/576/all-info">bills in the Senate</a> and <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/1674">House</a> designed to improve rail safety.

Both Brown and Kaptur said lobbying groups and major rail companies continue to oppose the legislation, with the industry putting profits over public safety.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.aar.org/">Association of American Railroads</a>, the lobbying group representing the nation’s major rail companies, told InvestigateTV in a written statement, “Railroads and policymakers share the same goal of making the rail network even safer. The industry is dedicated to advancing safety through our own initiatives and in collaboration with policymakers. Despite some allegations, railroads have never been opposed to the Railway Safety Act (RSA) and have had open, productive conversations with policymakers including Rep. Kaptur’s staff.”</p><p>Although the railroad lobby has repeatedly been unavailable for on-camera interviews with InvestigateTV, the organization has been clear in <a href="https://www.aar.org/news/aar-statement-on-senate-commerce-rail-safety-act-vote/">materials on its website</a> that it sees challenges in the legislation, specifically with the proposed crew staffing mandates and inspection requirements.</p><p>“They don’t think that they need anybody but themselves,” Kaptur said. “And look at the country.

The organization also pointed to a <a href="https://www.railwayage.com/freight/class-i/promises-made-promises-kept/?RAchannel=home">number of steps</a> it says the rail industry has independently taken to improve safety in the wake of the East Palestine disaster, including training thousands of first responders in communities across the country and doubling the number of people who can access a specialized system that gives real-time information about what rail cars are carrying.</p><p><i>Copyright 2024 Gray Media Group, Inc.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://stefano-garzarella.github.io/posts/2024-02-12-vdpa-blk/">https://stefano-garzarella.github.io/posts/2024-02-12-vdpa-blk/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39348997">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div role="main">
      <article role="main">
        <p>A <em>vDPA device</em> is a type of device that follows the <strong><a href="https://docs.oasis-open.org/virtio/virtio/v1.3/virtio-v1.3.html">virtio specification</a>
for its datapath</strong> but has a <strong>vendor-specific control path</strong>.</p>
<p>vDPA devices can be both physically located on the hardware or emulated by
software.</p>
<p><img src="https://stefano-garzarella.github.io/img/vdpa_overview.png" alt="vDPA overview"></p>
<p>A small vDPA parent driver in the host kernel is required only for the control
path. The main advantage is the <strong>unified software stack</strong> for all vDPA
devices:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>vhost interface</em> (vhost-vdpa) for userspace or guest virtio driver, like a
VM running in QEMU</li>
<li><em>virtio interface</em> (virtio-vdpa) for bare-metal or containerized applications
running in the host</li>
<li><em>management interface</em> (vdpa netlink) for instantiating devices and
configuring virtio parameters</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="useful-resources">Useful Resources</h3>
<p>Many blog posts and talks have been published in recent years that can help you
better understand vDPA and the use cases. On <a href="https://vdpa-dev.gitlab.io/">vdpa-dev.gitlab.io</a>
we collected some of them; I suggest you at least explore the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/introduction-vdpa-kernel-framework">Introduction to vDPA kernel framework</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/introducing-vduse-software-defined-datapath-virtio">Introducing VDUSE: a software-defined datapath for virtio</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Most of the work in vDPA has been driven by network devices, but in recent years,
we have also developed support for block devices.</p>
<p>The main use case is definitely leveraging the hardware to directly emulate the
virtio-blk device and support different network backends such as Ceph RBD or
iSCSI. This is the goal of some SmartNICs or DPUs, which are able to emulate
virtio-net devices of course, but also virtio-blk for network storage.</p>
<p>The abstraction provided by vDPA also makes software accelerators possible,
similar to existing vhost or vhost-user devices.
<a href="https://kvmforum2021.sched.com/event/ke3a/vdpa-blk-unified-hardware-and-software-offload-for-virtio-blk-stefano-garzarella-red-hat">We discussed about that at KVM Forum 2021</a>.</p>
<p>We talked about the fast path and the slow path in that talk. When QEMU needs
to handle requests, like supporting live migration or executing I/O throttling,
it uses the slow path. During the slow path, the device exposed to the guest is
emulated in QEMU. QEMU intercepts the requests and forwards them to the vDPA
device by taking advantage of the driver implemented in libblkio.
On the other hand, when QEMU doesn’t need to intervene, the fast path comes
into play. In this case, the vDPA device can be directly exposed to the guest,
bypassing QEMU’s emulation.</p>
<p><a href="https://gitlab.com/libblkio/libblkio">libblkio</a> exposes common API for accessing
block devices in userspace. It supports several drivers. We will focus more
on <code>virtio-blk-vhost-vdpa</code> driver, which is used by <code>virtio-blk-vhost-vdpa</code>
block device in QEMU. It only supports slow path for now, but in the future
it should be able to switch to fast path automatically. Since QEMU 7.2, it
supports libblkio drivers, so you can use the following options to attach a
vDPA block device to a VM:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>   -blockdev node-name<span>=</span>drive_src1,driver<span>=</span>virtio-blk-vhost-vdpa,path<span>=</span>/dev/vhost-vdpa-0,cache.direct<span>=</span>on <span>\
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span>   -device virtio-blk-pci,id<span>=</span>src1,bootindex<span>=</span>2,drive<span>=</span>drive_src1 <span>\
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>Anyway, to fully leverage the performance of a vDPA hardware device, we can
always use the generic <code>vhost-vdpa-device-pci</code> device offered by QEMU that
supports any vDPA device and exposes it directly to the guest. Of course,
QEMU is not able to intercept requests in this scenario and therefore some
features offered by its block layer (e.g. live migration, disk format, etc.)
are not supported. Since QEMU 8.0, you can use the following options to attach
a generic vDPA device to a VM:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>    -device vhost-vdpa-device-pci,vhostdev1<span>=</span>/dev/vhost-vdpa-0
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>At KVM Forum 2022, <a href="https://kvmforum2022.sched.com/event/15jLs/introducing-the-libblkio-high-performance-block-io-api-stefan-hajnoczi-alberto-faria-red-hat">Alberto Faria and Stefan Hajnoczi introduced libblkio</a>,

<h2 id="software-devices">Software devices</h2>
<p>One of the significant benefits of vDPA is its strong abstraction, enabling
the implementation of virtio devices in both hardware and software—whether in
the kernel or user space. This unification under a single framework, where
devices appear identical for QEMU facilitates the seamless integration of
hardware and software components.</p>
<h3 id="kernel-devices">Kernel devices</h3>
<p>Regarding in-kernel devices, starting from Linux v5.13, there exists a simple
simulator designed for development and debugging purposes. It is available
through the <code>vdpa-sim-blk</code> kernel module, which emulates a 128 MB ramdisk.
As highlighted in the presentation at KVM Forum 2021, a future device in the
kernel (similar to the repeatedly proposed but never merged <code>vhost-blk</code>)
could potentially offer excellent performance. Such a device could be used
as an alternative when hardware is unavailable, for instance, facilitating
live migration in any system, regardless of whether the destination system
features a SmartNIC/DPU or not.</p>
<h3 id="user-space-devices">User space devices</h3>
<p>Instead, regarding user space, we can use VDUSE. QSD supports it and thus
allows us to export any disk image supported by QEMU, such as a vDPA device
in this way:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>qemu-storage-daemon <span>\
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span>    --blockdev file,filename<span>=</span>/path/to/disk.qcow2,node-name<span>=</span>file <span>\
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span>    --blockdev qcow2,file<span>=</span>file,node-name<span>=</span>qcow2 <span>\
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span>    --export <span>type</span><span>=</span>vduse-blk,id<span>=</span>vduse0,name<span>=</span>vduse0,node-name<span>=</span>qcow2,writable<span>=</span>on
</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>As mentioned in the introduction, vDPA supports different buses such as
<code>vhost-vdpa</code> and <code>virtio-vdpa</code>. This flexibility enables the utilization of
vDPA devices with virtual machines or user space drivers (e.g., libblkio)
through the <code>vhost-vdpa</code> bus. Additionally, it allows interaction with
applications running directly on the host or within containers via the
<code>virtio-vdpa</code> bus.</p>
<p>The <code>vdpa</code> tool in iproute2 facilitates the management of vdpa devices
through netlink, enabling the allocation and deallocation of these devices.</p>
<p>Starting with Linux 5.17, vDPA drivers support <code>driver_ovveride</code>. This
enhancement allows dynamic reconfiguration during runtime, permitting the
migration of a device from one bus to another in this way:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span><span># load vdpa buses</span>
</span></span><span><span>$ modprobe -a virtio-vdpa vhost-vdpa
</span></span><span><span><span># load vdpa-blk in-kernel simulator</span>
</span></span><span><span>$ modprobe vdpa-sim-blk
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span># instantiate a new vdpasim_blk device called `vdpa0`</span>
</span></span><span><span>$ vdpa dev add mgmtdev vdpasim_blk name vdpa0
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span># `vdpa0` is attached to the first vDPA bus driver loaded</span>
</span></span><span><span>$ driverctl -b vdpa list-devices
</span></span><span><span>vdpa0 virtio_vdpa
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span># change the `vdpa0` bus to `vhost-vdpa`</span>
</span></span><span><span>$ driverctl -b vdpa set-override vdpa0 vhost_vdpa
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span># `vdpa0` is now attached to the `vhost-vdpa` bus</span>
</span></span><span><span>$ driverctl -b vdpa list-devices
</span></span><span><span>vdpa0 vhost_vdpa <span>[</span>*<span>]</span>
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span># Note: driverctl(8) integrates with udev so the binding is preserved.</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>
<p>Below are several examples on how to use <em>VDUSE</em> and the <em>QEMU Storage Daemon</em>
with VMs (<code>QEMU</code>) or Containers (<code>podman</code>).
These steps are easily adaptable to any hardware that supports virtio-blk
devices via vDPA.</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Introduction</h2>
<p dir="auto">While large language models (LLMs) have been successfully applied to various tasks, they still face challenges with hallucinations, especially for specialized knowledge. We propose GeneGPT, a novel approach to address this challenge by teaching LLMs to exploit biomedical tools, specifically NCBI Web APIs, for answering information-seeking questions. Our approach utilizes in-context learning, coupled with a novel decoding algorithm that can identify and execute API calls. Empirical results show that GeneGPT achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on eight GeneTuring tasks with an average score of 0.83, largely surpassing previous SOTA (0.44 by New Bing), biomedical LLMs such as BioGPT (0.04), and ChatGPT (0.12). Further analyses suggest that: Firstly, API demonstrations are more effective than documentations for in-context tool learning; Secondly, GeneGPT can generalize to longer chains of API calls and answer multi-hop questions; Lastly, the unique and task-specific errors made by GeneGPT provide valuable insights for future improvements. Our results underline the potential of integrating domain-specific tools with LLMs for improved access and accuracy in specialized knowledge areas.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Requirements</h2>
<p dir="auto">The code has been tested with Python 3.9.13. Please first install the required packages by:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="pip install -r requirements.txt"><pre>pip install -r requirements.txt</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">You also need an OpenAI API key to run GeneGPT with Codex. Replace the placeholder with your key in <code>config.py</code>:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ cat config.py 
API_KEY = 'YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY'"><pre>$ cat config.py 
API_KEY = <span><span>'</span>YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY<span>'</span></span></pre></div>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Using GeneGPT</h2>
<p dir="auto">After setting up the environment, one can run GeneGPT on GeneTuring by:</p>

<p dir="auto">where <code>111111</code> denotes that all Documentations (Dc.1-2) and Demonstractions (Dm.1-4) are used.</p>
<p dir="auto">To run GeneGPT-slim, simply use:</p>

<p dir="auto">which will only use the Dm.1 and Dm.4 for in-context learning.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Evaluating GeneGPT</h2>
<p dir="auto">One can evaluate the results by running:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="python evaluate.py ${RESULT_DIRECTORY}"><pre>python evaluate.py <span>${RESULT_DIRECTORY}</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">For example, we also put our experimental results in <code>geneturing_results</code> and <code>geneturing_results</code>. By running:</p>
