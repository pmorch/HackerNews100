<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                        <h5><span>Update</span></h5>
<div><p>After evaluating the impact and community feedback, the Bitnami team has postponed the deletion of the Bitnami public catalog (<code>docker.io/bitnami</code>) until <strong>September 29th</strong>&nbsp;to give users more time to adapt to the upcoming changes.</p><p>To raise awareness before the registry deletion, we will run a series of <strong>brownouts</strong>&nbsp;over the coming weeks. During each brownout, a set of 10 container images from <code>docker.io/bitnami</code> will be temporarily unavailable for 24 hours. The scheduled brownouts are:</p></div>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>August 28, 08:00 UTC → August 29, 08:00 UTC</li>
<li>September 2, 08:00 UTC → September 3, 08:00 UTC</li>
<li>September 17, 08:00 UTC → September 18, 08:00 UTC</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div><p>The list of affected applications will be published on the day of each brownout via our usual channels.</p><p>As previously announced, since August 28th, we have not published new Bitnami container images or Helm charts to Docker Hub in OCI format. The source code for containers and Helm charts remains available on GitHub under the Apache 2.0 license.</p></div>

<h3>What's changing?</h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Starting August 28th, Bitnami will be archiving its OCI registry of charts and images to a new location, Bitnami Legacy, to make room for the new secure, hardened images that will eventually reside in the main Bitnami registry. Users who are currently pulling these images will need to update their pipelines, internal mirrors, and Kubernetes clusters to pull from a new location before that time. A couple of options users have:&nbsp;</span><b></b></p>
<ol>
<li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><span>Switch to <a href="https://bitnami.com/">Bitnami Secure Images</a>&nbsp;</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><span>Switch to the Bitnami Legacy Registry</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr"><span>To retain existing functionality and maintain continuity of systems relying on Bitnami, we recommend switching to Bitnami Secure Images. In addition to a less disruptive transition, BSI helps strengthen your security and compliance posture by adopting the higher-quality images offered as part of BSI.&nbsp;</span><span></span><span></span></p>
<h3><img src="https://higherlogicdownload.s3.amazonaws.com/BROADCOM/MessageImages/88c9a7ee7d0647ab8f9caeda7b7be182.jpg" data-mce-hlimagekey="8b88f117-8eed-9f63-7dbf-6c35ae10a91b" data-mce-hlselector="#MainCopy_ctl04_tmceEditor_TinyMCEContent" width="951" height="193"></h3>

<h3>Switching to Bitnami Secure Images (BSI)</h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span>While some BSI images will be free, they are only for use in development/testing purposes, and a commercial subscription is recommended for access to the entire catalog, as well as stable tags, long-term support versions, and more.&nbsp;</span><b></b></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Though a BSI subscription provides customers with the entire Bitnami Debian-based image catalog (which will continue to receive updates), we recommend users upgrade and start using the hardened Photon Linux-based images instead. These are designed to be replacement images for any of the Debian images and work with the same Helm charts.&nbsp;</span><b></b></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The Photon images provide many other benefits not previously available to users of Debian images, including:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><span>Drastically reduced CVE count (e.g., 100+ CVEs to in some cases 0)</span></p>

</li>
<li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><span>More advanced Helm charts are not available on Docker Hub, such as Bitnami’s “distroless charts” which offer an 83% smaller attack surface (by MB).</span></p>

</li>
<li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><span>Images and Helm charts are delivered to a private and secure OCI registry dedicated to each customer instead of relying on a public registry with rate limits like Docker Hub.</span></p>

</li>
</ul>
<h3>Switching to Bitnami Legacy Registry</h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Another option for users of Bitnami today is to switch to the historic archive registry called Bitnami Legacy. This is unsupported software that is being made available, at users' own risk, while they make plans for alternatives. As such, this is a temporary solution, and we do not plan to keep this registry around for long. It will quickly begin to accumulate vulnerabilities that are not patched and atrophy as any software frozen in time does. If this is your choice, </span><span>we strongly recommend copying the images you are using to your own registry; again, this should be considered a temporary solution. </span><span>While we think there are many better options to make before the August 28th change, this is an option of last resort for those who need more time.&nbsp;</span><span></span></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span>Why is it a good time to consider upgrading your security and compliance for open source?&nbsp;</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span>So why do all the work now to change what’s maybe been working and update the type of open source images you use? We get it, no one likes change. But the reality is the landscape of open source is changing all around us. For example, from 2019-2023, the number of malicious packages discovered has risen to more than 245,000 according to Sonatype. That’s 2x all the previous years combined. The implication is that bad actors are finding increasing opportunities to exploit open source software that is running in every major software organization around the world. Meanwhile, with the growth of AI and MCP models, open source consumption is only going to increase. So the risk profile tides are quickly rising around us, and having a better boat to be prepared for the impacts of this change is the only responsible response.&nbsp;</span><span><b></b></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>In addition, the </span><a href="https://www.european-cyber-resilience-act.com/#:~:text=The%20Cyber%20Resilience%20Act%20is,throughout%20a%20product's%20life%20cycle." target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Cyber Resilience Act in the EU</span></a><span> creates an impending obligation for many organizations doing business there to provide guarantees about the open source software they use in their organization. It could soon be a liability to use open source that doesn’t have the required documentation to prove it’s been sourced from a safe place and hasn’t been tampered with.&nbsp;</span><span><b></b></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>This is why the launch of Bitnami Secure Images is so timely. BSI is making it easier than ever for organizations to responsibly prepare for what the future of open source software in our modern world looks like. As with many things, what started out simple has become increasingly complex and requires more care to navigate. Furthermore, BSI has one of the lowest TCOs in the industry, enabling more organizations than ever before to afford cutting-edge supply chain security. BSI is effectively democratizing security and compliance for open source so that it doesn’t require million-dollar contracts from vendors with sky-high valuations.&nbsp;</span><span></span></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span>What are Competitors trying to claim about Bitnami?&nbsp;</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span>It’s also a great time for the competition to try and steer the narrative about Bitnami. Some have claimed that Bitnami is “pulling their free container images and Helm charts from public access”. However, if we look a little more closely at the changes Bitnami has announced, this statement is inaccurate. For one, Bitnami Helm charts continue to be an open source project, under Apache 2, freely available to the public on GitHub.&nbsp;</span><b></b></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Second, what is actually changing is the built OCI artifacts. Essentially, Bitnami has been the Jenkins of the internet for many years, but this has become unsustainable. Operating a build pipeline and OCI registry for the general public is very expensive. Just ask those same competitors throwing shade at Bitnami why they have never offered to make their charts or images publicly available at the same scale Bitnami has?</span><b></b></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>So users can continue to freely access the Helm chart source (as well as the Debian images). However, in order to sustain and support the dedicated team of engineers who maintain and build new charts and images, a subscription will be required if an organization needs the images and charts built and hosted in an OCI registry for them. And to reiterate the above again, organizations that choose this path are simultaneously upgrading their security posture and improving their OSS strategy.</span><span></span></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span>How do the changes on August 28th work?</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The changes to the Bitnami repo are slated to begin on Aug 28th. They will not all be at once. Over a multi-week period, the images will be cleaned up from the registry to make room for the new ones. This is being done gradually to minimize the disruptions. However, we can’t be precise about which image will be removed at what time due to the complexity of the 84TB of OCI content that the engineering team will be dealing with. Therefore, it’s best to assume starting Aug 28th, every image used in a key business function should be addressed with an alternate registry.&nbsp;</span><span><b></b></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>We’re making room in the mainline Bitnami registry so we can populate it with the free tier of Bitnami Secure Images. These hardened Photon have the same names as the Debian images, so they can’t occupy the same registry. And we want new adopters of Bitnami to start with the secure images going forward, as we believe this is the future of open-source software on the internet. In </span><a href="https://github.com/bitnami/charts/issues/35164" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>this FAQ</span></a>,<span> you can find more information about all the details of the upcoming changes.</span></p>

Kennedy Jr. </span></p><p>Here are the emails that each of the officials sent to their CDC colleagues by Dr. Deb Houry, Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, and Dr. Daniel Jernigan. </p><p><strong>Dr. Deb Houry, Deputy Director for Program and Science/Chief Medical Officer:</strong></p><p>“Over the past decade, I have had the honor of working for six CDC directors, from both Republican and Democratic administrations. To me, these leaders and my colleagues were not “Red” or “Blue,” but red, white, and blue—united in the shared purpose of protecting health and saving lives in our beloved country and globally. I have served during this time in various leadership roles, including as CDC’s senior-most career leader and lead for the transition as the current administration assumed office.</p><p>I’ve always been proud to be part of an institution that is committed to using science and data to drive our life-saving work and inform our messaging. We have worked tirelessly to enhance openness through public-facing data dashboards, providing real-time access to trends for conditions such as mpox, H5N1, measles, and overdose deaths, allowing the public to make informed decisions. Additionally, I have witnessed the rapid translation of science into action, with some Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Reports (MMWRs) being published within a week of an outbreak.</p><p>For the good of the nation and the world, the science at CDC should never be censored or subject to political pauses or interpretations. Vaccines save lives—this is an indisputable, well-established, scientific fact. Informed consent and shared decision-making must focus not only on the risks but also on the true, life-saving benefits that vaccines provide to individuals and communities. It is, of course, important to question, analyze, and review research and surveillance, but this must be done by experts with the right skills and experience, without bias, and considering the full weight of scientific evidence. Recently, the overstating of risks and the rise of misinformation have cost lives, as demonstrated by the highest number of U.S. measles cases in 30 years and the violent attack on our agency.</p><p>CDC must continue its work on all diseases, including noncommunicable health conditions, which include many of the leading causes of death in the US. I have seen the value of integrating these efforts with those of other CDC programs, as we did with the Zika virus. Integrating expertise from across the agency is critical to our effectiveness in addressing novel and emerging diseases. CDC has proven its value in addressing conditions like hypertension, diabetes, cancer, overdose, and mental health issues, as evidenced by the progress in reducing overdose deaths this year. However, proposed budget cuts and reorganization plans will negatively impact CDC's ability to address these conditions, worsening the nation's health.</p><p>I love this agency. Nevertheless, I have submitted my resignation today. I am committed to protecting the public’s health, but the ongoing changes prevent me from continuing in my job as a leader of the agency. This is a heartbreaking decision that I make with a heavy heart.</p><p>To the CDC staff, you are the reason I stayed and showed up each day during difficult times. I have done my best to provide support so that you can continue your critical work. Thank you for your continued commitment to our mission and the work you do every day.</p><p>As I move on to the next phase of my career, I will continue to advocate for the values that have always driven my work—science, data, and evidence-based solutions to public health challenges. I have been privileged to contribute to the CDC’s mission in many roles, including as Chief Medical Officer, and I am deeply grateful to have had the opportunity to serve alongside you.</p><p>Deb Houry, MD, MPH.”</p><p><strong>Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, Director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (two emails, one to colleagues, and a longer formal resignation):</strong></p><p>“It has been a great pleasure to serve in the role of Director of NCIRD. I wish I could say more in person, but wanted to make sure that you all have heard from me directly that I have submitted my resignation. I am not able to serve in this role any longer because of the ongoing weaponizing of public health. You are the best team I have ever worked with, and you continue to shine despite this dark cloud over the agency and our profession.</p><p>Please take care of yourself and your teams and make the right decisions for yourselves. I will send a longer email to our Center this evening or in the morning.</p><p>Demetre Daskalakis.”</p><p><em><span>And here is Dr. Daskalakis’s formal resignation letter to Dr. Houry, </span><a href="https://x.com/dr_demetre/status/1960843433473376602" rel="">posted</a><span> on X/Twitter:</span></em></p><p>“Dear Dr. Houry, I am writing to formally resign from my position as Director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), effective August 28, 2025, close of business. I am happy to stay on for two weeks to provide transition, if requested. This decision has not come easily, as I deeply value the work that the CDC does in safeguarding public health and am proud of my contributions to that critical mission. However, after much contemplation and reflection on recent developments and perspectives brought to light by Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., I find that the views he and his staff have shared challenge my ability to continue in my current role at the agency and in the service of the health of the American people. Enough is enough. While I hold immense respect for the institution and my colleagues, I believe that it is imperative to align my professional responsibilities to my system of ethics and my understanding of the science of infectious disease, immunology, and my promise to serve the American people. This step is necessary to ensure that I can contribute effectively in a capacity that allows me to remain true to my principles. I am unable to serve in an environment that treats CDC as a tool to generate policies and materials that do not reflect scientific reality and are designed to hurt rather than to improve the public’s health. The recent change in the adult and children’s immunization schedule threaten the lives of the youngest Americans and pregnant people. The data analyses that supported this decision have never been shared with CDC despite my respectful requests to HHS and other leadership. This lack of meaningful engagement was further compounded by a “frequently asked questions” document written to support the Secretary’s directive that was circulated by HHS without input from CDC subject matter experts and that cited studies that did not support the conclusions that were attributed to these authors. Having worked in local and national public health for years, I have never experienced such radical non-transparency, nor have I seen such unskilled manipulation of data to achieve a political end rather than the good of the American people. It is untenable to serve in an organization that is not afforded the opportunity to discuss decisions of scientific and public health importance released under the moniker of CDC. The lack of communication by HHS and other CDC political leadership that culminates in social media posts announcing major policy changes without prior notice demonstrate a disregard of normal communication channels and common sense. Having to retrofit analyses and policy actions to match inadequately thought-out announcements in poorly scripted videos or page long X posts should not be how organizations responsible for the health of people should function. Some examples include the announcement of the change in the COVID-19 recommendations for children and pregnant people, the firing of scientists from ACIP by X post and an op-ed rather than direct communication with these valuable experts, the announcement of new ACIP members by X before onboarding and vetting have completed, and the release of term of reference for an ACIP workgroup that ignored all feedback from career staff at CDC. The recent term of reference for the COVID vaccine work group created by this ACIP puts people of dubious intent and more dubious scientific rigor in charge of recommending vaccine policy to a director hamstrung and sidelined by an authoritarian leader. Their desire to please a political base will result in death and disability of vulnerable children and adults. Their base should be the people they serve not a political voting bloc. I have always been first to challenge scientific and public health dogma in my career and was excited by the opportunity to do so again. I was optimistic that there would be an opportunity to brief the Secretary about key topics such as measles, avian influenza, and the highly coordinated approach to the respiratory virus season. Such briefings would allow exchange of ideas and a shared path to support the vision of “Making America Healthy Again.” We are seven months into the new administration, and no CDC subject matter expert from my Center has ever briefed the Secretary. I am not sure who the Secretary is listening to, but it is quite certainly not to us. Unvetted and conflicted outside organizations seem to be the sources HHS use over the gold standard science of CDC and other reputable sources. At a hearing, Secretary Kennedy said that Americans should not take medical advice from him. To the contrary, an appropriately briefed and inquisitive Secretary should be a source of health information for the people he serves. As it stands now, I must agree with him, that he should not be considered a source of accurate information. The intentional eroding of trust in low-risk vaccines favoring natural infection and unproven remedies will bring us to a pre-vaccine era where only the strong will survive and many if not all will suffer. I believe in nutrition and exercise. I believe in making our food supply healthier, and I also believe in using vaccines to prevent death and disability. Eugenics plays prominently in the rhetoric being generated and is derivative of a legacy that good medicine and science should continue to shun. The recent shooting at CDC is not why I am resigning. My grandfather, who I am named after, stood up to fascist forces in Greece and lost his life doing so. I am resigning to make him and his legacy proud. I am resigning because of the cowardice of a leader that cannot admit that HIS and his minions’ words over decades created an environment where violence like this can occur. I reject his and his colleagues’ thoughts and prayers, and advise they direct those to people that they have not actively harmed. For decades, I have been a trusted voice for the LGBTQ community when it comes to critical health topics. I must also cite the recklessness of the administration in their efforts to erase transgender populations, cease critical domestic and international HIV programming, and terminate key research to support equity as part of my decision. Public health is not merely about the health of the individual, but it is about the health of the community, the nation, the world. The nation’s health security is at risk and is in the hands of people focusing on ideological self-interest. I want to express my heartfelt gratitude for the opportunities for growth, learning, and collaboration that I have been afforded during my time at the CDC. It has been a privilege to work alongside such dedicated professionals who are committed to improving the health and well-being of communities across the nation even when under attack from within both physically and psychologically. Thank you once again for the support and guidance I have received from you and previous CDC leadership throughout my tenure. I wish the CDC continued success in its vital mission and that HHS reverse its dangerous course to dismantle public health as a practice and as an institution. If they continue the current path, they risk our personal well-being and the security of the United States. </p><p>Sincerely, Demetre C. Daskalakis MD MPH (he/his/him)”</p><p><strong>Dr. Daniel Jernigan, National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases:</strong></p><p>Colleagues: I wanted to let you know directly that I have submitted my resignation as Director of the National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases effective tomorrow. This was a very difficult decision for me. I have had the incredible opportunity to serve the American people doing meaningful and impactful work for over 30 years.</p><p>Since 1994, I have worked at CDC with some of the most intelligent, driven, and compassionate people, working to detect, control, and prevent infectious diseases. These efforts have had significant impact mitigating illness, preventing deaths, and improving the lives of millions of people.</p><p>I believe strongly in the mission of public health and the leadership that CDC has given for almost 80 years; however, given the current context in the Department, I feel it is best for me to offer my resignation.</p><p>I am so grateful for being able to work with all of you and know that you will continue doing the highest level of science and public health.</p><p>Thanks</p><p>Dan.”</p><p><span>The news of these resignations set off a firestorm in public health circles. </span><em>This is not normal. </em><span>There had been speculation that this particular trio of leaders would resign depending on how the September meeting of Secretary Kennedy’s newly-installed CDC Advisory Commitee on Immunization Practices went. There has been mounting fear that Secretary Kennedy will attempt to link vaccines to autism in a forthcoming HHS report, and that ACIP will be expected to remove many of its recommendations, some decades old, that have protected American children from death and severe illness from preventable diseases. But news of Monarez’s ouster meant that the writing was on the wall, moving these resignations up by weeks. </span></p><p>Frankly, the very future of the CDC is unknown. Thousands of good scientists and other agency officials remain. But without these key leaders—non-partisan career officials widely respected both internally and beyond—the agency is genuinely at risk of losing its ability to carry out its core mission. That’s not because any three people, (regardless of how experienced or respected they may be) are irreplaceable, but, rather, for what their departures portend. Other leaders and career scientists may also soon exit or be forced out. At some point, core mission activities that keep us safe will be at risk of being unfulfilled. </p><p>When these losses will translate to decreased safety to Americans that is noticeable is an open question.

<h2>
Joe Gebbia has no business designing government services.
</h2>
<p>
President Trump’s appointment of AirBnB co-founder Joe Gebbia as “Chief Design Officer” of the United States is a sickening travesty. It not only proves a fundamental misunderstanding of both design and governance, but an unbound commitment to corruption.
</p>
<p>
Gebbia’s directive to make government services “as satisfying to use as the Apple Store” within three years might serve as an appealing soundbite, but it quickly collapses under the slightest scrutiny: why? how? with what design army? The creation of the so-called National Design Studio and Gebbia’s appointment as its chief should raise serious questions about credentials, institutional destruction, and continued corruption.
</p>
<h2>
Design by Regulatory Arbitrage
</h2>
<p>
Gebbia’s reputation in design rests on a shaky foundation. AirBnB’s present dominance isn’t the product of real innovation. He and his friends stumbled upon an idea after listing their apartment on Craigslist for under-the-table sublease during a popular conference. They realized money could be made, and built a website to let other people do the same thing, through them, not Craig. Good on them, but renting a space is regulated differently than selling a used couch for many good reasons. What you could once attribute to the same quaint naivety of setting up a lemonade stand, you can no longer. The people who funded them knew better, and eventually, so did they.
</p>
<p>
What AirBnB does today is no different, other than the legitimization that comes with lots of capital and a slick app. But let’s be clear: The innovation was never about design, it was about collusion: spend enough to ensure that regulatory enforcement costs more; spin enough to make theft look heroic. With Y-Combinator as a launchpad, the company rapidly built its business by systematically ignoring well-established regulations in hospitality and real estate. This sounds like a perfect match for the Trump Administration, and it’s why I cannot take any of Gebbia’s commitments now at face value. His formative business experience taught him to break existing systems rather than designing better ones, and for that he was rewarded beyond anyone’s wildest imaginations.
</p>
<p>
True design requires understanding constraints, working within complex systems, and serving users’ actual needs rather than exploiting regulatory gaps. Gebbia’s track record suggests a fundamentally different approach — one that prioritizes disruption over responsibility and profit over genuine public service. I’m not sure he can differentiate between entitlement and expertise, self and service, commerce and civics.
</p>
<h2>
Institutional Vandalism
</h2>
<p>
The hubris of this appointment becomes clearer when viewed alongside the recent dismantling of <span>18F</span>, the federal government’s existing design services office. Less than a year ago, Trump and Elon Musk’s <span>DOGE</span> initiative completely eviscerated this team, which was modeled after the <span>UK</span>’s Government Digital Service and comprised hundreds of design practitioners with deep expertise in government systems. Many of us likely knew someone at <span>18F</span>. We knew how much value they offered the country. The people in charge didn’t understand what they did and didn’t care.
</p>
<p>
In other words, we were already doing what Gebbia claims he’ll accomplish in three years. The <span>18F</span> team had years of experience navigating federal bureaucracy, understanding regulatory constraints, and working within existing governmental structures—precisely the institutional knowledge required for meaningful reform.
</p>
<p>
Now we’re expected to believe that dismantling this expertise and starting over with political appointees represents progress. Will Gebbia simply rehire the <span>18F</span> professionals who were just laid off? If so, why destroy the institutional knowledge in the first place? If not, how does beginning from scratch improve upon what already existed? It doesn’t and it won’t. This appointment has more in common with Trump’s previous appointment of his son-in-law to “solve the conflict in the Middle East,” which resulted in no such thing unless meetings about hotels and real estate counts.
</p>
<p>
Gebbia knows as much about this job as Kushner did about diplomacy, which is nothing. Despite years in “design,” I suspect Gebbia knows little of anything about it, or user experience, or public service. His expertise is in drawing attention while letting robbers in the back door.
</p>
<h2>
Impossible Promises, Probable Corruption
</h2>
<p>
The timeline alone reveals the proposal’s fundamental unseriousness. Gebbia promises to reform not just the often-cited 26,000 federal websites, but all government services—physical and digital—within three years. Anyone with experience in government systems or even just run-of-the-mill website design knows this is absurd. The <span>UK</span>’s Government Digital Service, working with a much smaller governmental structure, required over a decade to achieve significant results.
</p>
<p>
But three years is plenty of time for something else entirely: securing contracts, regulatory concessions, and other agreements that benefit private interests. Gebbia may no longer run AirBnB day-to-day, but his wealth remains tied to the company. His conspicuous emergence as a Trump supporter just before the 2024 election suggests motivations beyond public service.
</p>
<p>
Trump has consistently demonstrated his willingness to use government power to benefit his businesses and those of his collaborators. There’s a growing list of “business-minded” men granted unfettered access and authority over sweeping government initiatives under Trump who have achieved nothing other than self-enrichment. AirBnB has already disrupted hospitality; their next expansion will likely require the kind of regulatory flexibility that only comes from having allies in high government positions. Now they’ve got a man on the inside.
</p>
<h2>
The Pattern of Capture
</h2>
<p>
This appointment fits a broader pattern of regulatory capture, where industries gain control over the agencies meant to oversee them. Gebbia’s role ostensibly focuses on improving government services, but it also positions him to influence regulations that could significantly impact AirBnB’s business model and expansion plans.
</p>
<p>
The company has spent years fighting local zoning laws, housing regulations, and taxation requirements. Having a co-founder in a high-level government design role—with access to federal agencies and regulatory processes—creates obvious conflicts of interest that extend far beyond website optimization.
</p>
<h2>
Beyond Personal Grievances
</h2>
<p>
<i>Full disclosure: I attended college with Joe Gebbia and quickly formed negative impressions of his character that subsequent events have only reinforced.</i>
</p>
<p>
While personal history colors perspective, the substantive concerns about this appointment stand independently: the mismatch between promised expertise and demonstrated capabilities, the destruction of existing institutional knowledge, the unrealistic timeline claims, and the predictable potential for conflicts of interest.
</p>
<p>
Government design reform is important work that requires deep expertise, institutional knowledge, and genuine commitment to public service. It deserves leaders with proven track records in complex systems design, not entrepreneurs whose primary experience involves circumventing existing regulations for private gain.
</p>
<p>
The American people deserve government services that work better. But interacting with government could not –&nbsp;and should not — be more different from buying something at the Apple Store. One is an interface layer upon society –&nbsp;an ecosystem of its own that is irreducible to a point and inextricable from the physical and philosophical world in which it exists. The other is a store. To model one after the other is the sort of idiocy we should expect from people who either understand little to nothing about how either thing should work or just don’t care. I suspect it’s both.

<div xmlns:plos="http://plos.org"><h2>Abstract</h2><div><p>The popularity of breathwork as a therapeutic tool for psychological distress is rapidly expanding. Breathwork practices that increase ventilatory rate or depth, facilitated by music, can evoke subjective experiential states analogous to altered states of consciousness (ASCs) evoked by psychedelic substances. These states include components such as euphoria, bliss, and perceptual differences. However, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the profound subjective effects of high ventilation breathwork (HVB) remain largely unknown and unexplored. In this study, we investigated the neurobiological substrates of ASCs induced by HVB in experienced practitioners. We demonstrate that the intensity of ASCs evoked by HVB was proportional to cardiovascular sympathetic activation and to haemodynamic alterations in cerebral perfusion within clusters spanning the left operculum/posterior insula and right amygdala/anterior hippocampus; regions implicated in respiratory interoceptive representation and the processing of emotional memories, respectively. These observed regional cerebral effects may underlie pivotal mental experiences that mediate positive therapeutic outcomes of HVB.</p>

<div xmlns:plos="http://plos.org" id="section1"><h2>Introduction</h2><p>High ventilation breathwork (HVB) encompasses contemplative and therapeutic practices, including Conscious Connected Breathing or Holotropic Breathwork, in which a controlled pattern of volitional breathing increases the rate or depth of ventilation and is typically accompanied by evocative music. Despite their distinct historical roots and delivery modalities, these different HVB practices share a purported ability to elicit acute extraordinary alterations in subjective experience that closely resemble the qualia of altered states of consciousness (ASCs) induced by psychedelic substances [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref001">1</a>–<a href="#pone.0329411.ref003">3</a>]. Converging evidence demonstrates the potential value of psychedelic treatments for specific difficult-to-treat psychiatric and physiological conditions [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref004">4</a>–<a href="#pone.0329411.ref007">7</a>]. The induction of ASCs is suggested to be critical to the therapeutic action of psychedelic substances [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref008">8</a>–<a href="#pone.0329411.ref010">10</a>], for which HVB might therefore offer a non-pharmacological alternative, with fewer legal and ethical restrictions to large-scale adoption in clinical treatment. In line with this, the popularity of HVB as a therapeutic tool for psychological distress is rapidly expanding, indexed by an increased number of scientific investigations, see [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref011">11</a>,<a href="#pone.0329411.ref012">12</a>] for more details.</p>
<p>The therapeutic potential of HVB practices is suggested by a long cultural tradition of use to relieve symptoms of psychological distress [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref011">11</a>,<a href="#pone.0329411.ref013">13</a>] and by emerging preliminary evidence of clinical efficacy from controlled trials in affective and trauma-related disorders [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref014">14</a>]. Prolonged hyperventilation/HVB reportedly elicits a wide range of effects on subjective experience that include emotional and psychedelic-like phenomena (ASCs), which range from panic-like sensations to feelings of awe and dissociative symptoms [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref011">11</a>]. The 5D-ASC questionnaire is popularly used in ASC research to retrospectively assess such states [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref015">15</a>]. A key dimension of this scale is ‘Oceanic Boundlessness’ (OBN); a term coined by Freud in 1920 [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref016">16</a>] which describes a set of related feelings including ‘spiritual experience, insightfulness, blissful state, positively experienced depersonalization, and the experience of unity’ [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref017">17</a>]. OBN is considered as a defining aspect of ASCs evoked by psychedelic substances, such as psilocybin. However, the neurobiological mechanisms and subjective experience underlying ASCs induced by HVB have not been studied extensively and remain elusive.</p>
<p>First, we characterised the subjective experience of HVB to capture the nature and intensity of evoked experiential phenomena. From these data, we aimed to assess whether these effects could be reliably reproduced in controlled experimental settings in comparison to a remote – and more ecologically valid – condition. These findings informed the choice of the ASC variable, OBN, which was ultimately selected as the most widely reported experiential phenomena to identify the critical neurobiological effects of HVB.</p>
<p>Then we examined the effects of HVB performed by experienced breathwork practitioners in different experimental settings, and investigated peripheral and central neurophysiological mechanisms underpinning ASCs engendered by HVB. The neurobiological endpoints were selected based on well-characterised neurophysiological effects of hyperventilation (reviewed in [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref011">11</a>]). Hyperventilation acutely reduces regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) through interacting effects of hypocapnia, cerebral alkalosis and hypoxia, resulting in transient perturbation of neurometabolic homeostasis. Further, hyperventilation evokes allostatic changes in action-ready bodily arousal, mediated via the autonomic nervous system via the dominance of sympathetic over parasympathetic drive to the heart and blood vessels. In characterising the neurobiological effects of HVB and associated ASCs, we therefore focused our measurements on two robust indices of neurometabolic and autonomic nervous control: rCBF and heart rate variability (HRV).</p>
<p>To our knowledge, no studies have previously reported the relationship between the intensity of ASCs and changes in rCBF induced by HVB practices. Since we could not base our prediction of the regional specificity of such correlations on previous knowledge, we preferred to adopt a whole brain voxelwise exploratory approach. Also, as observations reported on the effects of psychedelics on autonomic nervous system activity have been contrasting [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref018">18</a>,<a href="#pone.0329411.ref019">19</a>], we could not make precise predictions on the direction of association between HRV and ASCs.</p>
<p>Our study was designed to address different objectives through three inter-related experiments: (please see the methods for more details), in 1) HVB was conducted over an online video-conferencing platform with a breathwork facilitator (REMOTE setting). The aim was to characterise the subjective response to remote HVB in a home setting, and inform the choice of the ASC domain to be used as subjective endpoint. In 2), we used pseudo-continuous arterial spin labelling (pCASL) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain during HVB to identify the relationship between neural haemodynamic effects of HVB and subjective measures (MRI setting). In 3) HVB was performed in a psychophysiology lab to characterise the relationship between the psychophysiological effects of HVB (autonomic alterations, see ‘psychophysiological session 3’ for more information) and subjective measures (LAB setting).</p>

<div xmlns:plos="http://plos.org" id="section2"><h2>Materials and methods</h2>
<div id="section1"><h3>Ethics statement</h3>
<p>This research was approved by the Research Governance and Ethics Committee (RGEC) in Brighton and Sussex Medical School (BSMS) as ERA/BSMS9AN4/2/2. Recruitment began on 24/11/2021 and ended on 03/03/2022. Participants provided written informed consent before participating.</p>
</div>

<div id="section2"><h3>Participants</h3>
<p>Physically and psychiatrically healthy participants aged 18–65 years old were recruited from the local area through advertisements and flyers distributed at breathwork events, in yoga/meditation centres, and on social media. Participants were eligible to take part if they had either 10 or more experiences of fast-paced breathwork or at least 6 months of any HVB practice (as defined in [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref011">11</a>]). They were screened online for eligibility and excluded if they were pregnant, currently experiencing any psychiatric condition (assessed using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) to ensure absence of DSM-V listed disorders) [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref020">20</a>]. Additional exclusion criteria included a history of epileptic seizures, panic disorder, or syncope in prior HVB, current neurological, musculoskeletal, respiratory, or cardiovascular disease, current pharmacological treatment, and contraindications to MRI.</p>
<p>Participants and were financially compensated £10 per hour for their time and up to £10 in travel expenses.</p>
</div>

<div id="section3"><h3>Breathwork modality and subjective measures</h3>
<p>HVB consisted of cyclic breathing without pausing, accompanied by progressively evocative music. This aimed to reproduce the experience of Conscious Connected Breathing, a widely adopted HVB practice typically led by a trained breathwork facilitator. In the online experimental session, instructions were provided by a breathwork facilitator (DB) who hosted the group of online participants. For the LAB and MRI setting, pre-recorded instructions by the same facilitator were delivered to participants. Specific details on breathwork instructions are presented in the supplementary index (<a href="#pone.0329411.s001">S1 Appendix</a>).</p>
</div>

<div id="section4"><h3>Questionnaires</h3>
<p>Self-reported measures were consistent across the three conditions and administered online via Qualtrics (Qualtrics, Provo, UT) [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref021">21</a>] within 30 minutes post-HVB. The selected questionnaires assessed: 1) Affect (Positive and Negative Affect Schedule – Expanded Form, PANAS-X [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref022">22</a>]); 2) Panic–like symptoms (Panic Symptoms List, PSL [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref023">23</a>]), 3) Fear and discomfort (Visual Analogue Scales (VAS) [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref024">24</a>]), and 4) Symptoms of ASCs (5-Dimensional Altered States of Consciousness Rating Scale, 5D-ASC [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref015">15</a>]).</p>
<p>Pre-session questionnaires included the VAS (scored from “0 – <em><em>no fear and discomfort”</em></em> to “100 – <em><em>complete fear and discomfort”</em></em>) [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref024">24</a>] and the PANAS-X, which measured affect using 60 items rated on a 5-point Likert scale from “<em><em>1 – very slightly or not at all</em></em>” to “<em><em>5 – extremely</em></em>” [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref025">25</a>].</p>
<p>Post-session questionnaires included the VAS and PANAS-X again, as well as the 5D-ASC, which retrospectively assessed ASCs using 94 items rated via VAS [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref017">17</a>]. Questions and responses were grouped into 3 broad subscales: oceanic boundlessness (OBN) as previously mentioned, visionary restructuralisation (VRS) to examine the effect of the HVB on vision, and Dread of Ego Dissolution (DED) which captures the anxiety-inducing effects of the experience related to the idea of the dissolution of the self [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref015">15</a>]. The PSL, a 13-item tool used to evaluate panic symptomatology, required participants to rate each item on a five-point scale from “<em><em>0 – not at all</em></em>” to “<em><em>4 – extremely severe</em></em>”.</p>
<p>The PSL and VAS for fear/discomfort were scored based on [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref024">24</a>]: a significant panic attack was indicated by an increase in VAS fear by 50 points and 4 or more items rated above mild in the PSL (mild = 2).</p>
</div>

<div id="section5"><h3>Online experimental session 1 (REMOTE)</h3>
<p>The session was conducted remotely via an online video-conferencing platform (Zoom). Preparatory information was sent to participants after screening and enrolment, including the platform link, instructions, and pre- and post-session questionnaires.</p>
<p>Participants received instructions on camera setup and were assigned personal participant numbers. They were instructed to be in a private room to avoid interruptions and to position their cameras to capture their chest and stomach for observation of full-body, continuous breaths. A breathwork facilitator remotely guided groups of participants through the 30-minute online breathwork session. Members of the research team were present online to ensure session consistency and to monitor participant engagement in HVB practice. No group experience-sharing (integration) followed the breathwork sessions to avoid memory and experience merging. Instead, participants self-integrated (processed) their session by completing retrospective questionnaires that explored the qualia of the experience within 30 minutes of concluding the session.</p>
</div>

<div id="section6"><h3>Neuroimaging experimental session 2 (MRI)</h3>
<p>Each participant in the neuroimaging session was scanned on a Siemens Prisma 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner fitted with a 32-channel head coil. High-resolution structural scans were obtained during rest using a 3D T1-weighted magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo (T1 MPRAGE) sequence (repetition time (TR) = 2300 ms, echo time (TE) = 2.19 ms, flip angle = 9°, matrix = 256 × 256, voxel size = 1.0 × 1.0 × 1.0 mm3, GRAPPA acceleration factor = 2; total acquisition time (TA) = 5m 30s). Additionally, twenty control and label images were acquired per condition using a pCASL with background suppression following the parameter recommendation of the consensus paper [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref026">26</a>]: label duration = 2000ms, post-labelling delay (PLD) = 1800ms, TR = 5000 ms, TE = 14 ms, voxel size = 3.4 × 3.4 × 6.0 mm3, TA = 3m 22s), was acquired. A proton density (M<sub>0</sub>) image was acquired using the same readout and TR as the control and label images to estimate pcASL CBF.</p>
<p><a href="#pone-0329411-g001">Fig 1</a> is a schematic presentation of the MRI experimental design. Recorded instructions (see <a href="#pone.0329411.s001">S1 Appendix</a>) guided participants to breathe through three phases: BASELINE, START, and SUSTAINED HVB. BASELINE consisted of breathing at a normal rate for 20 minutes. Participants were asked to gradually increase their ventilation rate and/or depth via recorded instructions (START HVB) for approximately 6 minutes. The SUSTAINED HVB phase started after at least 5 minutes of START HVB and once end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> (EtCO<sub>2</sub>), measured via nasal cannula connected to a capnograph (MICROCAP®, Oridion Medical LTD), was stable at levels ≤20 mmHg (from a typical value of 35–40 mmHg), and was maintained for a further ~20-minutes.</p>

<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0329411.g001">
              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0329411.g001</a></p></div><p>Scans were performed during BASELINE (10 minutes after the scan start), at the start of HVB (immediately after initiating HVB), and during SUSTAINED HVB (after at least 6 minutes of uninterrupted breathwork).</p>
<p>SPM12 [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref027">27</a>] and custom written Matlab (The MathWorks Inc., Natick, Massachusetts) scripts were used for image processing and statistics. Rigid-body motion correction was used to realign labelled and control images, and perfusion weighted images were calculated for the realigned control-labelled pairs by subtracting the labelled image from the control. The mean perfusion weighted images were then used to estimate CBF using the one-compartment model [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref026">26</a>] and processed to obtain partial volume-corrected [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref028">28</a>], tissue-specific (i.e., grey matter (GM) and white matter (WM)) CBF images independently. The pcASL CBF images were normalized maps in MNI space using SPM12 [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref027">27</a>]. Participants with prominent arterial transit artifacts in the CBF images, evident by the presence of strong arterial signals upon visual inspection, were excluded from the study.</p>
</div>

<div id="section7"><h3>Psychophysiological session 3 (LAB)</h3>
<p>Participants in the psychophysiology study attended the psychophysiology lab at the Trafford Centre for Medical Research at BSMS. To measure beat-to-beat heart rate (HR) and HRV (computed as the root mean square of successive differences, RMSSD) [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref029">29</a>], an electrocardiograph (Firstbeat Bodyguard 2 device) was applied to the torso [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref028">28</a>]. To measure EtCO<sub>2</sub>, the participant was fitted with a nasal cannula connected to a capnograph (MICROCAP®, Oridion Medical LTD). Following a BASELINE period during which the participant was instructed to breathe as normal to relaxing music for 10 minutes, the participant was instructed to perform HVB (see supplementary index for more information). This began as a 5-minute warm-up (START HVB) where the participant performed HVB to lower their EtCO<sub>2</sub> to ≤20 mmHg, followed by 25-minutes of HVB (SUSTAINED HVB) where EtCO<sub>2</sub> was maintained ≤20 mmHg, aided by recorded instructions from a trained breathwork facilitator. For analyses, the HVB period was defined as starting once EtCO<sub>2</sub> was stable below 20 mmHg and was subsequently recorded for 20 minutes. The recovery period began immediately after HVB was terminated, and participants resumed their normal breathing. Participants completed retrospective questionnaires within 30 minutes of the session’s conclusion.</p>

<div id="section1"><h4>Data analysis and statistics.</h4><p><strong>Objective 1:</strong> To characterize the subjective response to HVB across different settings (REMOTE, LAB, MRI), we compared affective responses (PANAS-X scores clustered into positive and negative domains), panic-like symptoms (VAS fear/discomfort and PSL) and ASCs. For the 5D-ASC, the percentage maximum score was calculated per participant and dimension [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref030">30</a>]. Data were compared across the three experiments to test for differences in self-reported effects. A linear mixed-effects model (LMM) was used to examine the effects of setting on the mean responses within each dimension of the 5D-ASC and for the PSL, accounting for subject-specific variability as a random effect using the lmer package in R; [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref031">31</a>]. We used the likelihood ratio test to compare a full model with a fixed effect of setting and a random effect of subject to a reduced model with only a random effect of subject [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref031">31</a>]. Post-hoc tests were performed using the emmeans package in R [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref032">32</a>], adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Tukey method.</p>
<p>For the PANAS-X and VAS, we used an LMM analysis to examine the effects of HVB (pre- versus post-) on setting and the type of question (positive versus negative affect for PANAS; discomfort versus fear for VAS), accounting for subject-specific variability as a random effect. We explored two-way interactions between all the variables and post-hoc tests using the same methods as the previous analyses [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref032">32</a>].</p>
<p><strong>Objective 2:</strong> In order to test the correlations between HVB-induced ASCs and rCBF effects, two contrasts between HVB time points (see MRI experimental design in <a href="#pone-0329411-g001">Fig 1</a>) were studied using paired-samples t-tests in SPM12 [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref027">27</a>]: contrast 1) between BASELINE and START HVB grey matter CBF; contrast 2) between BASELINE and SUSTAINED HVB grey matter CBF. Following this, voxel-wise maps of changes in pcASL rCBF (ΔrCBF) were calculated for the contrasts between BASELINE versus SUSTAINED HVB, and START versus SUSTAINED HVB. These ΔrCBF maps were then used for voxelwise correlation analysis with the OBN score, selected as the highest-rated 5D-ASC dimension. Voxel clusters were considered significant at a cluster-forming threshold of p &lt; 0.001, corrected for multiple comparisons using family-wise error (FWE) correction, with a significance level of p &lt; 0.05.</p>
<p><strong>Objective 3:</strong> To investigate changes in cardiac autonomic drive during HVB and their relationship to the intensity of ASCs, we calculated change in HRV (ΔRMSSD) and HR. Heartbeat timing data were imported from the Firstbeat Bodyguard device into Kubios 3.5.0 HRV scientific 4.1.0 for processing. Raw data contained substantial noise from chest movement. After an initial phase of artefact removal, interbeat interval (IBI) data were smoothed using an automatic noise detection filter at a medium threshold [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref033">33</a>]. A repeated measures ANCOVA with contrasts for different orders of an equation was conducted using HRV and OBN (5D-ASC selected from objective 1) as covariates to explain HRV variance over time, with polynomial contrast applied to identify linear and complex patterns, allowing us to characterise dynamic trends in HRV responses to HVB.</p>

<div xmlns:plos="http://plos.org" id="section3"><h2>Results</h2><p>Self-reported data from 42 participants were analysed, comprising 31 unique individuals. Study participants enrolled in one to three experimental sessions: n = 15 (age 42.9 ± 12.6 years, 5 females) for the online experimental session; n = 8 (age 41 ± 13.02 years, 2 females) for the session conducted within the psychophysiology lab; and n = 19 (age 43.7 ± 11.9; 7 females) for the MRI experimental session. There were different participants in each condition (3 repeated all conditions, 5 participants participated in 2 conditions, see <a href="#pone.0329411.s005">S1 Fig</a> for key subjective effects of repeated participants). No adverse events, including panic attacks, were reported across all experimental settings.</p>

<div id="section1"><h3>Subjective effect results</h3>
<p>Generally, measures of fear and discomfort were low in all conditions (<a href="#pone-0329411-g002">Fig 2</a>, panel C). LMM analyses identified only a significant two-way interaction between HVB and question type (fear and discomfort), with post-hoc tests showing a significant increase in discomfort post-HVB. These results indicate that perceived discomfort increased during HVB, while perceived fear remained stable across settings.</p>

<div id="section2"><h3>MRI results</h3>
<p>Datasets from 13 participants (mean age 43.7 ± 11.9; 7 female) were included in the analysis. Voxel clusters showing statistically significant CBF reductions occupied 12% and 28.5% of global grey matter volume at START and SUSTAINED HVB, respectively. Global CBF was reduced by 30.5% during START (36.2 ± 12.4 ml/100g/min) and 41.6% during SUSTAINED HVB (30.5 ± 8.5 ml/100g/min) relative to BASELINE (52.2 ± 8.2 ml/100g/min).</p>
<p>We first identified a region of cortex where HVB-evoked reduction in perfusion (ΔrCBF from BASELINE to SUSTAINED) correlated with the magnitude of ASC in the OBN dimension. This cluster encompassed left parietal operculum/posterior insula (PO/INS) (<a href="#pone-0329411-g003">Fig 3</a>). Here, rCBF in PO/INS was reduced by 7.7% during the START period of HVB (43.7 ± 10 ml/100g/min) and 18.9% during SUSTAINED HVB (38.4 ± 12.7 ml/100g/min) relative to BASELINE (52.2 ± 8.2 ml/100g/min).</p>

<div xmlns:plos="http://plos.org" id="section4"><h2>Discussion</h2><p>Our study is the first that aims to characterise the relationship between the intensity of ASCs induced by HVB practices and associated central and autonomic nervous system effects, via changes in pcASL rCBF and HRV, respectively. Our findings identified significant correlations that might indicate possible neurobiological substrates of HVB-evoked ASCs, accompanied by music. First, our findings demonstrated that the experience of HVB can be safely reproduced across different experimental settings. The pattern of self-reported experiences elicited within the MRI scanner and psychophysiology lab were analogous to those experienced at home (a more natural and comfortable environment).</p>
<p>During all experimental sessions, participants reported a trend-level reduction in ratings of fear and negative emotions. Additionally, no adverse reactions or panic attacks were experienced by any participants. However, there was a mild increase in discomfort ratings and mild panic-like symptoms were reported during the MRI session – although these were not associated to increased anxiety or panic attacks and might have been evoked by the physical constraints of being inside the MRI chamber. This experience conflicts typical breathwork practice. The observed increase in physical discomfort alongside reductions in fear and negative affect may reflect a hormetic effect, whereby transient physiological or emotional stressors promote longer-term psychological resilience [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref035">35</a>,<a href="#pone.0329411.ref036">36</a>].</p>
<p>Across participants and experimental settings, HVB reliably enhanced ASCs dominated by OBN, which is considered as a defining aspect of ASCs evoked by psychedelic substances, such as psilocybin. Although differences in OBN scores across conditions were not statistically significant, participants in the LAB condition reported noticeably higher scores compared to MRI and REMOTE sessions. This trend suggests that the in-person experience and controlled, quiet environment of the LAB may have enhanced the immersive and evocative qualities of the breathwork experience. In contrast, the MRI setting—despite also involving in-person contact —may have been less conducive due to scanner noise and physical constraints. Finally, the REMOTE condition, which involved no in-person interaction and took place in participants varied home environments, received the lowest OBN ratings. These findings point to the importance of ‘set and setting’, e.g., [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref037">37</a>], a concept well-established in psychedelic research in shaping ASCs and subjective response. These results may indicate that physical context and interpersonal presence play a critical role in breathwork outcomes.</p>
<p>Interestingly, OBN is reportedly the most accurate predictor of antidepressant actions of psychedelic substances [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref009">9</a>,<a href="#pone.0329411.ref038">38</a>–<a href="#pone.0329411.ref040">40</a>]. In the present study, the magnitude of the OBN experience induced by HVB was comparable to that elicited by serotonergic psychedelic substances, including psilocybin and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref041">41</a>,<a href="#pone.0329411.ref042">42</a>], reinforcing observations of other breathwork studies [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref001">1</a>,<a href="#pone.0329411.ref002">2</a>].</p>
<p>Fast-paced hyperventilation induces cardiovascular sympathetic activation (with relative cardiovagal parasympathetic withdrawal) and cerebral vasoconstriction, the latter is a consequence of respiratory alkalosis, resulting from reduced plasma CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sup>+</sup>, which elevates blood pH [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref043">43</a>]. Ergo, we focused our analysis on correlations between OBN and changes in HRV (for which decreases capture pro-sympathetic shifts in cardiac autonomic balance) and CBF (where regional reductions reflect cerebrovascular vasoconstriction). Importantly, decreased EtCO<sub>2</sub> is implicated as a critical factor in catalysing stronger, deeper ASCs during breathwork and may predict subacute psychological and physiological outcomes [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref002">2</a>,<a href="#pone.0329411.ref044">44</a>].</p>
<p>Our experiments identified that HVB engendered substantive time-dependent decreases in pcASL CBF. The reduction of rCBF relative to BASELINE in a cluster localized within left posterior insula and left parietal operculum predicted the intensity of OBN. This region encompasses primary interoceptive cortex and represents the state of cardiorespiratory arousal, and is consequently engaged in higher-order respiratory control. Correspondingly, neural activity here is enhanced by chemo-stimulated increases in ventilation [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref045">45</a>]. More broadly, this insular-parietal region supports the integration of somatosensory information as well as the cortical representation of afferent respiratory and bodily signals [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref046">46</a>], for example in the emergence of conscious motor intentions [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref047">47</a>]. It is also implicated in high-level integrative processes which merge external and internal stimuli [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref048">48</a>,<a href="#pone.0329411.ref049">49</a>] that contribute to a coherent, embodied representation of self [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref050">50</a>].</p>
<p>These roles are relevant to the interpretations of our finding that rCBF reductions within the PO/INS during SUSTAINED HVB predicted the intensity of self-reported OBN experience. The construct of OBN is closely related to feelings of depersonalization, sense of unity and blissful state [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref016">16</a>], and our findings align with the notion that abnormal integration of signals in the posterior insula cortex can result in abnormal body ownership. Studies on ecstatic epilepsy, a rare focal epilepsy, show that the insula is involved in ASC-like experiences, including “heightened self-awareness, mental clarity and unity with everything that exists, accompanied by a sense of bliss and physical well-being” [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref051">51</a>]. These overlap with the OBN construct, as assessed in the 5D-ASC [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref015">15</a>]. Picard and Craig [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref052">52</a>] hypothesised the involvement of the insula in the genesis of ecstatic epilepsy given its role in interoception and self-consciousness, confirmed by intracerebral electrode recordings [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref053">53</a>]. Seizures in the mesiotemporal region propagated to the dorsal anterior insula coincide with ecstatic symptoms [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref054">54</a>] and stimulation of the mid-dorsal insula region evoked experiences akin to oceanic psychedelic effects [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref055">55</a>]. The interruption of interoceptive predictive coding during anterior insula seizures may underlie the ecstatic experience, emphasizing its pivotal role in mystical and psychedelic states [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref051">51</a>,<a href="#pone.0329411.ref052">52</a>].</p>
<p>We then ran an exploratory subsequent analysis (<a href="#pone-0329411-g005">Fig 5</a>) to explore the correlations between sub-dimensions of the 11D-ASC relevant to OBN [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref017">17</a>], namely ‘disembodiment’, ‘unity’ and ‘bliss’, and CBF reductions induced by HVB relative to BASELINE. We found that scores of ‘unity’ and ‘bliss’, but not ‘disembodiment’ were associated with CBF reductions (see <a href="#pone.0329411.s002">S1</a>-<a href="#pone.0329411.s004">S3 Tables</a> for details), which concurs with the notion discussed above, specifically pointing to an involvement of the insula in the genesis of blissful feelings. Of note, 5-HT2A– targeting compounds such as psilocybin, renowned for therapeutic utility, are known to induce CBF decreases in different brain regions that correlate with the intensity of psychedelic experiences [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref056">56</a>]. Studies found reduced CBF in the insula following psilocybin administration, though it was not linked to the subjective effects assessed via the 5D-ASC [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref057">57</a>].</p>
<p>CBF reductions occur rapidly following decreased EtCO<sub>2</sub> and can be reliably detected in response to very brief periods of hyperventilation. Conversely, the profound experiential changes in emotion and thought processes tend to emerge gradually, and correspondingly psychedelic phenomenology appears contingent on the length of the breathwork session [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref058">58</a>]. Our investigation therefore compared HVB-evoked effects during late (SUSTAINED) and early (START) phases of HVB to focus specifically on the haemodynamic changes that occurred once the subjective effects had emerged. By contrasting the START and SUSTAINED phases of hyperventilation, we identified a region of right amygdala/anterior hippocampus, where the intensity of subjective experience (OBN as a covariate) positively correlated with CBF changes. Here, increased rCBF predicted the most intense OBN experience, despite the global reduction in CBF. One possible explanation is that this amygdalo-hippocampal CBF increase reflected increased regional neural activation associated with emergent expression of intense subjective effects. These regions are well established as being specialized for emotion (amygdala) and memory (hippocampus) processing. Their reciprocal interactions enable the formation of episodic representations, integrating the emotional significance and interpretation of memories [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref059">59</a>]. Interestingly, increased right amygdala blood-oxygen level-dependent responses to emotional faces in functional MRI (fMRI) have been identified in patients with treatment-resistant depression following administration of psilocybin, predictive of clinical improvements at 1 week. The authors posit that this indicates psilocybin aids individuals’ ability to confront, reappraise, and improve emotional responsiveness [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref060">60</a>]. Though speculative, these findings may indicate that HVB facilitates the processing of emotionally salient memories, which is proposed to be an essential therapeutic element in psychedelic-assisted psychotherapies [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref061">61</a>,<a href="#pone.0329411.ref062">62</a>], consistent with promising results from clinical trials of HVB applied as a therapy for patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref063">63</a>]. Our finding of increased CBF in the hippocampal region also indicates that a single session of intense hyperventilation selectively alters perfusion to the hippocampus, similar to the effects observed after 20 minutes of hypocapnia-inducing moderate exercise [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref064">64</a>]. This finding was interpreted as indicative of short-term metabolic adaptation to the high energy demands of hippocampal neurons, rather than reflecting the effects of mechanical vascular changes [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref064">64</a>].</p>
<p>HRV is a physiological index of the balance of sympathetic and parasympathetic influences on the heart. The observed reduction in HRV reflects sympathetic activation and withdrawal of parasympathetic drive [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref065">65</a>–<a href="#pone.0329411.ref067">67</a>], consistent with an action-ready state of psychophysiological engagement. As previously described, OBN characteristically entails a deeply felt positive mood linked to the experience of unity with the self and the world, and in its extreme, is experienced as a mystical or religious experience [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref017">17</a>]. Our finding that OBN ratings were related to changes in HRV over time echoes observations from other relevant modalities of ASC induction, such as self-induced cognitive trance [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref068">68</a>] or 5-HT agonists, such as LSD [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref018">18</a>,<a href="#pone.0329411.ref069">69</a>–<a href="#pone.0329411.ref071">71</a>] or N,N-Dimethyltryptamine (DMT) [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref072">72</a>,<a href="#pone.0329411.ref073">73</a>]. Nevertheless, the observed association with a positive mood contrasts the wide acceptance of reduced HRV as an index of stress and negative affective states. During HVB, the physiological state of the body exceeds typical homeostatic boundaries, and the autonomic correlates of this may reinforce a dissociative psychological state of positive affect in line with the premise of hormesis, see [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref011">11</a>] for more.</p>
<p>This exploratory work is preliminary and limited by a small sample size and a lack of an independent control condition that may, in our neuroimaging session, have prevented us from separating the contributions of haemodynamic effects secondary to CO<sub>2</sub> changes from neural activation. We also acknowledge the possibility that our whole brain voxelwise approach has led to reduced sensitivity to detect significant correlations relative to an a priori region of interest (ROI) approach. In addition, from a methodological perspective, it may be argued that the lack of control group exposed only to music may prevent dissociation of the effects of auditory stimuli (the ambient track) and the effects of HVB. Listening to upbeat music does stimulate ventilation and this should be controlled in the future. Helpful input from lived experience populations indicates that music is a powerful support to therapeutic applications of HVB. In choosing our design, we elected not to “dissect” the music component from HVB, as we preferred to consider HVB as a contemplative practice accompanied by music as a whole – and to test it in its entirety [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref074">74</a>]. Importantly, both studies [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref002">2</a>,<a href="#pone.0329411.ref075">75</a>] have dissected the effect of music and breathwork, and elucidate that music is not the main factor in triggering ASCs. This reveals that music alone is unlikely to engender significant ASCs of the magnitude reported in this research. It is also argued that the reductionist approach of breaking down a contemplative practice to dissect an “active ingredient” is less preferable than testing a practice in its entirety [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref074">74</a>]. Conjointly, psychedelic therapy sessions do not adhere to one specific psychotherapeutic model, though one consistent feature of the experience is listening to music. During psychedelic therapy sessions, patients are urged to centre their attention inwardly whilst supine and listening to a carefully selected playlist. It is suggested that music can help facilitate therapeutic experiences. As such, we are looking for CBF changes that correspond with ASCs, induced by HVB with music. We elected to proceed to treat the experience as whole, hence no control for music. More hypothesis-driven work is certainly required within the neuroscience of breathwork.</p>
<p>Furthermore, our study focused on experienced HVB practitioners and therefore our results may not be generalisable; though this is also a strength as it ensured our practitioners were able to reach the desired state without adverse outcomes. Additionally, we were unable to directly assess relevant mechanisms of therapeutic actions, as our subjective measures did not include clinical parameters relevant to traumatic memories or other forms of psychological distress. Moreover, ASCs initiated by breathwork are inherently dynamic, thus dynamic phenomenological tools, such as those employed by Lewis-Healey et al., [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref058">58</a>] may be more sensitive and informative.</p>
<p>Our imaging approach was also limited by the absence of correction for physiological noise caused by cardiac and respiratory fluctuations. This is crucial for most physiological fMRI applications for reducing signal artifacts. However, physiological fluctuations (including respiratory frequency and volume changes) can still introduce signal variations in ASL data, but we believe that our approach remains robust. Our analysis inherently averages over multiple cardiac cycles, which helps mitigate the effects of physiological noise on CBF quantification, and although respiration-induced signal changes are observed in some pcASL studies, they are largely associated with motion rather than direct vascular effects [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref076">76</a>]. This does not fully eliminate the influence of an overall increase in HR, respiratory rate, or other physiological parameters during changes in breathing conditions—factors that may also impact labelling efficiency and arterial transit times. These considerations are relevant not only to our study, but to other ASL studies where complex, interconnected factors can influence ASL signal and CBF. Practical constraints limit the extent to which additional physiological measurements can be incorporated, particularly in a study as complex as ours. These constraints include scanning time and the potential stress on participants. Furthermore, measuring CBF at the start of the SUSTAINED HVB rather than at the end or during is not ideal, yet, it may capture the physiological ‘trigger condition’ for entry into ASCs, which can continue irrespective of specific physiological threshold conditions, see [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref002">2</a>] for more.</p>
<p>A further key reason for choosing not to adopt a method of correction for EtCO<sub>2</sub> was a high risk of regressing out our primary signal of interest. One plausible mechanistic hypothesis inspiring our work is that ASCs evoked by HVB practices directly result from alterations in EtCO<sub>2</sub> and the resulting cerebral pH, causing downstream effects on neuronal function [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref011">11</a>]. Therefore, CO<sub>2</sub> related physiological signals are likely correlated with experimental effects that were the focus of our investigation, in line with recent work by others [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref002">2</a>] and regressing out these signals would severely impact our sensitivity to study the relationship between haemodynamic effects and ASCs. An additional reason is that our measures of EtCO<sub>2</sub> (collected by nasal cannula and capnograph) have been occasionally incomplete during the end of HVB sessions when EtCO<sub>2</sub> levels had reached particularly low levels, and we felt that application of correction methods using incomplete physiological data would have risked introducing major artifacts.</p>
<p>Additionally, we observed prominent arterial transit time (ATT) artifacts in 6 out of 19 participants. These artifacts were characterized by strong arterial signals in the CBF images, which led to their exclusion from the analysis. ATT artifacts can significantly impact the accuracy of perfusion measurements, as they indicate that labelled blood has not yet reached the capillary beds. To address this issue in future research, capturing blood flow dynamics at different delay times through a multi-PLD ASL protocol would reduce the impact of ATT artifacts and increase precision of assessment of cerebral perfusion.</p>

<div xmlns:plos="http://plos.org" id="section5"><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>In conclusion, our exploratory experiments suggest that circuitries supporting the integration of interoceptive representations and processing of affective memories are putative neurobiological substrates of HVB-induced ASCs. Our findings indicate directions for future research towards a better understanding of HVB and ultimately harnessing such practices for future therapeutic applications.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Within five days of ChatGPT’s release in 2022, the artificial intelligence chatbot gained more than a million users. Today, more than half of all adults under age 30 and nearly half of adults ages 30-49 say they’ve used it, according to Pew Research Center.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00238">Their work</a>, “Model Misalignment and Language Change: Traces of AI-Associated Language in Unscripted Spoken English,” is the first peer-reviewed research to analyze whether the conversational human language system is changing in the wake of the widespread adoption of chat-based large language models like ChatGPT. It was accepted into the eighth Conference on AI, Ethics, and Society, hosted by the Association for the Advancement of AI and Association for Computing Machinery, which will be held in October. The study will be published in AIES Proceedings as part of the conference.</p><div><p>“This research focuses on a central issue in the discourse surrounding AI and language: are these language changes happening because we’re using a tool and repeating what it suggested or is language changing because AI is influencing the human language system?” said assistant professor of computational linguistics and principal investigator Tom Juzek. “By analyzing lexical trends before and after ChatGPT was released in 2022, we found a convergence between human word choices and LLM-associated patterns with AI buzzwords.”</p> <p>While rapid increases in the use of certain words — like Omicron — do occur, these increases are typically due to real-world events. Recent large-scale upticks in the use of words like “delve” and “intricate” in certain fields, especially education and academic writing, are attributed to the widespread introduction of LLMs with a chat function, like ChatGPT, that overuses those buzzwords.</p> <p>“The changes we are seeing in spoken language are pretty remarkable, especially when compared to historical trends,” Juzek said. “What stands out is the breadth of change: so many words are showing notable increases over a relatively short period. Given that these are all words typically overused by AI, it seems plausible to conjecture a link.”</p> <p>Words including “surpass,” “boast,” “meticulous,” “strategically,” and “garner” have also seen considerable increases in usage since the release of ChatGPT. While these words are often used in a formal or academic tone, which makes them less common in unscripted, spoken language, researchers found that nearly three-quarters of these target words showed increased usage with some more than doubling in frequency.</p> <figure id="attachment_117600" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-117600"><img decoding="async" src="https://news.fsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chatGPTGroup.jpg" alt="" width="1613" height="1075" srcset="https://news.fsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chatGPTGroup.jpg 1613w, https://news.fsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chatGPTGroup-512x341.jpg 512w, https://news.fsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chatGPTGroup-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://news.fsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chatGPTGroup-768x512.jpg 768w, https://news.fsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chatGPTGroup-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://news.fsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chatGPTGroup-900x600.jpg 900w, https://news.fsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chatGPTGroup-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1613px) 100vw, 1613px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-117600">From left: Bryce Anderson, Riley Galpin and Tom Juzek. Photo by Devin Bittner/FSU College of Arts and Sciences.</figcaption></figure> <p>The team, including Bryce Anderson, a rising senior majoring in computer science, and Riley Galpin, a rising junior double-majoring in computer science and pure mathematics, analyzed 22.1 million words from unscripted and spontaneous spoken language including conversational podcasts on science and technology. Post-ChatGPT, researchers noted a measurable increase in the use of AI-associated buzzwords but not their synonymous counterparts. For example, the AI buzzword “underscore” saw considerable increase in usage while its synonym “accentuate” did not. <span data-teams="true">FSU researchers said this suggests we’re not just using AI; AI buzzwords are turning up in how people talk, raising concerns about a possible “seep-in effect.”</span></p> <p>“Language is the most powerful medium of communication that humanity has and understanding how AI will affect this medium is fundamentally important and timely,” said Anderson, the paper’s lead author. “My motivation to pursue this research stems from seeing AI push the limits of what’s possible in major industries and realizing that this influence isn’t just limited to tool usage — it can condition societal aspects, including how we use language.”</p> <p>This research builds upon the group’s previous research into the impact AI has on the domain of written scientific English, which revealed large-scale structural changes AI has had on scientific writing. Galpin presented the research on written language at the 38th International Florida AI Research Society Conference in May, and Anderson will join Juzek in presenting the team’s new research on spoken language at the AIES Conference in October.</p> <p>“Our research highlights many important ethical questions,” Galpin said. “With the ability of LLMs to influence human language comes larger questions about how model biases and misalignment, or differences in behavior in LLMs, may begin to influence human behaviors.”</p> <p>This research was conducted as part of FSU’s <a href="https://cre.fsu.edu/undergradresearch/urop">Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program</a>, which provides high-achieving undergraduates an opportunity to explore their research interests alongside a faculty member.</p> <p>“I look forward to future research in this area,” Juzek said. “While this is a critical development in understanding AI’s role in language change, a big open question for future work is whether AI is amplifying conventional patterns of language change or directly driving them.”</p> <p>To learn more about research conducted in the Department of Modern Languages and Linguistics, visit <a href="https://mll.fsu.edu/">mll.fsu.edu</a>.</p></div></div>]]></description>

"So a lot of fast progress there."</p><p>At the meeting, employees asked Welle and other executives about job security, "internal barriers" and Google's culture after several recent rounds of layoffs,&nbsp;<a href="https://carbon.cnbc.com/108157385" target="_blank">buyouts</a>&nbsp;and reorganizations.</p><p>Welle said the idea is to reduce bureaucracy and run the company more efficiently.</p><p>"When we look across our entire leadership population, that's mangers, directors and VPs, we want them to be a smaller percentage of our overall workforce over time," he said.</p><p>The 35% reduction refers to the number of managers who oversee fewer than three people, according to a person familiar with the matter. Many of those managers stayed with the company as individual contributors, said the person, who asked not to be named because the details are private.</p><p>Google CEO <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/sundar-pichai/">Sundar Pichai</a> weighed in at the meeting, reiterating the need for the company "to be more efficient as we scale up so we don't solve everything with headcount."</p><p>Google eliminated about 6% of its workforce in 2023, and has implemented cuts in various divisions since then. Alphabet finance chief Anat Ashkenazi, who joined the company last year, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/29/google-cfo-says-company-can-push-a-little-further-in-cost-savings.html">said</a> in October that she would push cost cuts "a little further."

            <pubDate>Wed, 27 Aug 2025 20:03:01 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://dw-news.dreamwidth.org/44429.html">https://dw-news.dreamwidth.org/44429.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45044440">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I'll start with the tl;dr summary to make sure everyone sees it and then explain further: As of <strong>September 1</strong>, we will temporarily be forced to <strong>block access to Dreamwidth from all IP addresses that geolocate to Mississippi</strong> for legal reasons. This block will need to continue until we either win the legal case entirely, or the district court issues another injunction preventing Mississippi from enforcing their social media age verification and parental consent law against us. </p>

<p>Mississippi residents, we are so, so sorry. We really don't want to do this, but the legal fight we and Netchoice have been fighting for you had a temporary setback last week. We genuinely and honestly believe that we're going to win it in the end, but the Fifth Circuit appellate court said that the district judge was wrong to issue <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mssd.125118/gov.uscourts.mssd.125118.59.0.pdf">the preliminary injunction</a> back in June that would have maintained the status quo and prevented the state from enforcing <a href="https://legiscan.com/MS/bill/HB1126/2024">the law</a> requiring any social media website (which is very broadly defined, and which we definitely qualify as) to deanonymize and age-verify all users and obtain parental permission from the parent of anyone under 18 who wants to open an account. </p>

<p>Netchoice took that appellate ruling up to the Supreme Court, who declined to overrule the Fifth Circuit with no explanation -- except for Justice Kavanaugh agreeing that we are likely to win the fight in the end, but saying that it's no big deal to let the state enforce the law in the meantime. </p>

<p>Needless to say, it's a big deal to let the state enforce the law in the meantime. The Mississippi law is a breathtaking state overreach: it forces us to verify the identity and age of every person who accesses Dreamwidth from the state of Mississippi and determine who's under the age of 18 by collecting identity documents, to <em>save</em> that highly personal and sensitive information, and then to obtain a permission slip from those users' parents to allow them to finish creating an account. It also forces us to change our moderation policies and stop anyone under 18 from accessing a wide variety of legal and beneficial speech because the state of Mississippi doesn't like it -- which, given the way Dreamwidth works, would mean blocking people from talking about those things at all. (And if you think you know exactly what kind of content the state of Mississippi doesn't like, you're absolutely right.)</p>

<p>Needless to say, we don't want to do that, either. Even if we wanted to, though, we can't: the resources it would take for us to build the systems that would let us do it are well beyond our capacity. You can read <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/8zy9o2f2amk3gsvai4c2v/Paolucci-Declaration-NC-v-Fitch.pdf?rlkey=ppn4oun27q002jsxdwpzdav5t&amp;e=1&amp;dl=0">the sworn declaration</a> I provided to the court for some examples of how unworkable these requirements are in practice. (That isn't even everything! The lawyers gave me a page limit!) </p>

<p>Unfortunately, the penalties for failing to comply with the Mississippi law are incredibly steep: fines of $10,000 per user from Mississippi who we don't have identity documents verifying age for, per incident -- which means every time someone from Mississippi loaded Dreamwidth, we'd potentially owe Mississippi $10,000. Even a single $10,000 fine would be rough for us, but the per-user, per-incident nature of the actual fine structure is an existential threat. And because we're part of the organization suing Mississippi over it, and were explicitly named in the now-overturned preliminary injunction, we think the risk of the state deciding to engage in retaliatory prosecution while the full legal challenge continues to work its way through the courts is a lot higher than we're comfortable with. Mississippi has been itching to issue those fines for a while, and while normally we wouldn't worry much because we're a small and obscure site, the fact that we've been yelling at them in court about the law being unconstitutional means the chance of them lumping us in with the big social media giants and trying to fine us is just too high for us to want to risk it. (The excellent lawyers we've been working with are Netchoice's lawyers, not ours!)</p>

<p>All of this means we've made the <em>extremely</em> painful decision that our only possible option for the time being is to block Mississippi IP addresses from accessing Dreamwidth, until we win the case. (And I repeat: I am absolutely <em>incredibly</em> confident we'll win the case. And apparently Justice Kavanaugh agrees!) I repeat: I am so, so sorry. This is the last thing we wanted to do, and I've been fighting my ass off for the last three years to prevent it. But, as everyone who follows the legal system knows, the Fifth Circuit is gonna do what it's gonna do, whether or not what they want to do has any relationship to the actual law.</p>

<p>We don't collect geolocation information ourselves, and we have no idea which of our users are residents of Mississippi. (We also don't <em>want</em> to know that, unless you choose to tell us.) Because of that, and because access to highly accurate geolocation databases is extremely expensive, our only option is to use our network provider's geolocation-based blocking to prevent connections from IP addresses they identify as being from Mississippi from even reaching Dreamwidth in the first place. I have no idea how accurate their geolocation is, and it's possible that some people not in Mississippi might also be affected by this block. (The inaccuracy of geolocation is only, like, the 27th most important reason on the list of "why this law is practically impossible for any site to comply with, much less a tiny site like us".)</p>

<p>If your IP address is identified as coming from Mississippi, beginning on September 1, you'll see a shorter, simpler version of this message and be unable to proceed to the site itself. If you would otherwise be affected, but you have a VPN or proxy service that masks your IP address and changes where your connection appears to come from, you won't get the block message, and you can keep using Dreamwidth the way you usually would.</p>

<p>On a completely unrelated note while I have you all here, have I mentioned lately that I really like <a href="https://protonvpn.com/">ProtonVPN's</a> service, privacy practices, and pricing? They also have a free tier available that, although limited to one device, has no ads or data caps and doesn't log your activity, unlike most of the free VPN services out there. VPNs are an excellent privacy and security tool that every user of the internet should be familiar with! We aren't affiliated with Proton and we don't get any kickbacks if you sign up with them, but I'm a satisfied customer and I wanted to take this chance to let you know that.</p>

<p>Again, we're so incredibly sorry to have to make this announcement, and I personally promise you that I will continue to fight this law, and all of the others like it that various states are passing, with every inch of the New Jersey-bred stubborn fightiness you've come to know and love over the last 16 years. The instant we think it's less legally risky for us to allow connections from Mississippi IP addresses, we'll undo the block and let you know.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I am an AI hater. This is considered rude, but I do not care, because I am a hater.</p>

<p>To speak politely about AI, you put disclaimers before criticism: of course I’m not against it entirely; perhaps in a few years when; maybe for other purposes, but. You are supposed to debate how and when it should be used. You are supposed to take for granted that it must be useful somewhere, to someone, for something, eventually. People who are rich and smart and respected are saying so, and it would be arrogant to disagree with such people.</p>

<p>But I am a hater, which is a kind of integrity. It means I am willing to disagree with anyone, even if it is rude. “But I only use it to–” “Actually if you just—” “The new models–” “I was making fun–” Stop. You’re embarrassing yourself. I am embarrassed for you.</p>

<p>Critics have already written thoroughly about the <a href="https://www.teenvogue.com/story/chatgpt-is-everywhere-environmental-costs-oped">environmental</a> <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy8gy7lv448o">harms</a>, the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ai-artificial-intelligence-health-business-90020cdf5fa16c79ca2e5b6c4c9bbb14">reinforcement</a> of <a href="https://www.noemamag.com/the-exploited-labor-behind-artificial-intelligence/">bias</a> and generation of <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/07/09/nx-s1-5462609/grok-elon-musk-antisemitic-racist-content">racist output</a>, the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-12/ai-eroded-doctors-ability-to-spot-cancer-within-months-in-study?embedded-checkout=true">cognitive harms</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/26/technology/chatgpt-openai-suicide.html">AI supported suicides</a>, the problems with <a href="https://www.404media.co/deepfake-harassment-ohio-undress-clothoff-nudify-apps/">consent</a> and <a href="https://jskfellows.stanford.edu/theft-is-not-fair-use-474e11f0d063">copyright</a>, the way AI tech companies further the <a href="https://karendhao.com/">patterns of empire</a>, how <a href="https://thecon.ai/">it’s a con</a> that enables <a href="https://voiceofsandiego.org/2025/04/14/as-bot-students-continue-to-flood-in-community-colleges-struggle-to-respond/">fraud</a> and <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/10/04/1080801/generative-ai-boosting-disinformation-and-propaganda-freedom-house/">disinformation</a> and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/fbi-says-artificial-intelligence-being-used-sextortion-harassment-2023-06-07/">harassment</a> and <a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/privacy-technology/machine-surveillance-is-being-super-charged-by-large-ai-models">surveillance</a>, the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/millions-of-workers-are-training-ai-models-for-pennies/">exploitation of workers</a>, as an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/688679/amazon-ceo-andy-jassy-ai-efficiency">excuse to fire workers</a> and de-skill work, how they <a href="https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/illusion-of-thinking">don’t actually reason</a> and probability and association are <a href="https://thegradient.pub/machine-learning-wont-solve-the-natural-language-understanding-challenge/">inadequate to the goal of intelligence</a>, how people think it makes them faster when it <a href="https://metr.org/blog/2025-07-10-early-2025-ai-experienced-os-dev-study/">makes them slower</a>, how it is inherently mediocre and fundamentally conservative, how it is at its core a <a href="https://newsocialist.org.uk/transmissions/ai-the-new-aesthetics-of-fascism/">fascist technology</a> rooted in the <a href="https://aworkinglibrary.com/writing/toolmen">ideology of supremacy</a>, defined not by its technical features but <a href="https://ali-alkhatib.com/blog/defining-ai">by its political ones</a>.</p>

<p>But I am more than a critic: I am a hater. I am not here to make a careful comprehensive argument, because people have already done that. If you’re pushing slop or eating it, you wouldn’t read it anyway. You’d ask a bot for a summary and forget what it told you, then proceed with your day, unchanged by words you did not read and ideas you did not consider.</p>

<p>I am here to be rude, because this is a rude technology, and it deserves a rude response. Miyazaki said, “<a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/insult-life-itself-studio-ghiblis-193724631.html">I strongly feel that this is an insult to life itself.</a>” Scam Altman said we can <a href="https://fight.fudgie.org/search/show/tpw/episode/20250723_Wed#line3691">surround the solar system with a Dyson Sphere</a> to hold data centers. Miyazaki is right, and Altman is wrong. Miyazaki tells stories that blend the ordinary and the fantastic in ways people find deeply meaningful. Altman tells lies for money.</p>

<p>And I’m glad they’re lies. Because the makers of AI aren’t damned by their failures, they’re damned by their goals. They want to build a genie to grant them wishes, and their wish is that nobody ever has to make art again. They want to create a new kind of mind, so they can force it into mindless servitude. Their dream is to invent new forms of life to enslave.</p>

<p>And to what end? In a kind of nihilistic symmetry, their dream of the perfect slave machine drains the life of those who use it as well as those who turn the gears. What is life but what we choose, who we know, what we experience? Incoherent empty men want to sell me the chance to stop reading and writing and thinking, to stop caring for my kids or talking to my parents, to stop choosing what I do or knowing why I do it. Blissful ignorance and total isolation, warm in the womb of the algorithm, nourished by hungry machines.</p>

<p>And even as it consumes those who use it, even as the scammers become their own marks, even as it is sustained by exploited workers slotted in as human filters for algorithmic abuse – some people want to have a little, as a treat. As a joke. Just to make fun of it, just for the busywork, because it’s good enough, right? You understand.</p>

<p>I do understand: you want permission. There’s a machine in the corner wrapped in human skin that makes things out of shit and blood to look like whatever you want (as long as you don’t look too closely). You gave one to your teacher and they didn’t notice. Your boss told you to use it after they laid off half the team and it was fine. You fed one to your kids and they liked it. You want to know you can use it sometimes without me thinking less of you. You don’t need me to believe it’s useful, you just want me to be polite about it.</p>

<p>But I am a hater, and I will not be polite. The machine is disgusting and we should break it. The people who build it are vapid shit-eating cannibals glorifying ignorance. I strongly feel that this is an insult to life itself.</p>

<p>I became a hater by doing precisely those things AI cannot do: reading and understanding human language; thinking and reasoning about ideas; considering the meaning of my words and their context; loving people, making art, living in my body with its flaws and feelings and life. AI cannot be a hater, because AI does not feel, or know, or care. Only humans can be haters. I celebrate my humanity.</p>

                                -                                A failure of security systems at PayPal is currently causing concern for numerous German banks and private customers. A vast number of payments are reportedly being blocked, with merchants waiting on funds in the billions.

                                                                                    <p>                The US payment service provider PayPal has been quite popular in Germany for years. However, currently both private customers and banks are grappling with a problem. According to the "Süddeutsche Zeitung" (SZ), certain security systems at PayPal have reportedly failed. These are the systems designed to filter out fraudulent transactions. As a result, various German banks are said to have blocked payments from PayPal as early as Monday. The SZ estimated the amount involved to be more than ten billion euros.</p>
                            	<h3>PayPal security systems down - direct debits submitted unchecked</h3>
                                                        <p>PayPal is regularly exploited by fraudsters to get hold of citizens' money. The payment service's security systems are supposed to check and prevent such activity. However, these systems reportedly failed at the end of last week, causing PayPal to submit direct debits without verification.</p>
                        	    	            
                            
                                                                    <p>Portals like "Netzwelt" also report disruptions with the payment service. The blog "Cashys Blog" mentioned technical issues over the weekend. For days, customers have allegedly experienced difficulties processing transactions. Payments via direct debit are primarily being rejected, despite the accounts reportedly having sufficient funds.</p>
                                                        <p>However, this might not be directly related to the PayPal disruption but rather due to the banks' reactions. According to the "Süddeutsche Zeitung," banks noticed the unusually high volume of direct debits from PayPal on Monday, which appeared suspicious or fraudulent.</p>
                                                        <h3>Banks halted all PayPal transactions</h3>
                                                        <p>To prevent a potentially multimillion-euro fraud, several banks reportedly temporarily halted all PayPal transactions.</p>
                                                        <p>According to information from the "Süddeutsche Zeitung" (SZ), these banks include "Bayerische Landesbank", "Hessische Landesbank", and "DZ-Bank".</p>
                        	    	            
                                                                    <p>As a result, numerous merchants did not receive their funds. The newspaper reports that the banks may have frozen more than ten billion euros. As stated by the news agency News5, not only online shop payments were affected; customers are currently experiencing difficulties using PayPal at supermarket checkouts and in retail stores as well.</p>
                                                        <p>According to PayPal, it was a "temporary service disruption." The company's site states: "Over the weekend, there was a temporary service interruption that led to delays in transactions for a small number of accounts. The issue has since been resolved."</p>
                                                        <p>Even though PayPal claims to have fixed the problem, the effects of the outage are still noticeably impacting merchants and consumers, as reported by News5. PayPal lists several services as "under maintenance" on its status page. When payments will resume smoothly remains unclear.</p>
                                                        <h3>PayPal security systems down - impact across Europe</h3>
                                                        <p>According to information from the German Press Agency (dpa), the incident has been confirmed by the German Savings Banks and Giro Association (DSGV). In recent days, there have been "incidents involving unauthorized direct debits from PayPal affecting various financial institutions," the association stated. "These incidents had a significant impact on payment transactions throughout Europe, particularly in Germany. This was noticeable to customers of the Savings Banks Finance Group institutions for several hours last Monday."</p>
                        	    	            
                                                                    <p>Consumer advocates recommend that PayPal customers check their accounts for unauthorized debits.</p>
                                                        <p>Focus Online also reports on a major update that PayPal has presumably been implementing since August 25. Whether there is a connection between the disruption and the planned update remains unclear at this time.</p>
                                                        <p>PayPal is by far the most important online payment service in the German market, accounting for just under 30 percent of online purchases.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page">
<h2>GMP damaging Zen 5 CPUs?</h2>


<h3>Background</h3>

<p> We have fried two Ryzen 9950X CPUs in a few months by running GMP tests.
This is not expected, of course.  In this page, we provide as much information
as possible to help analysing the problem.
</p>
<p>
What causes these CPUs to die while running GMP is unknown to us.  While
similar, it is not the widely reported Asrock motherboard problem, as the
motherboards we use are of a different make (see below).  It might be that the
Zen 5 CPUs pull more power than specified when running GMP, or it might be that
our cooling solutions are inadequate.
</p>
<p>
The 1st failure happened in late winter 2025 (February IIRC).  The system was
located in a dedicated room in a flat in Stockholm, Sweden.  The ambient
temperature in the room was low, less than 20°C.
</p>
<p>
The 2nd failure happened 2025-08-24 in a dedicated computer room, with ambient
temperature just over 20°C.
</p>
<p>

After both failures, we took out the CPUs and found a discoloured area of
perhaps 25mm² on the pin side.  Here are two picture from different angles of the 2nd CPU:
</p>
<img src="https://gmplib.org/cpu-backside.jpg">
<img src="https://gmplib.org/cpu-backside2.jpg">

<p>
We use a Noctua cooling solution for both systems. For the 1st system, we
mounted the heat sink centred.  For the 2nd system, we followed Noctua's advice
of mounting things offset towards what they claim to be the hotter side of the
CPU.  Below is a picture of the 2nd system without the heat sink which shows
that offset.  Note the brackets and their pins, those pins are where the heat
sink's pressure gets centred.  Also note how the thermal paste has been
squeezed away from that part, but is quite thick towards the left.
</p>

<img src="https://gmplib.org/mbd.jpg">
<p>
Here is a closeup on the heat sink, indicating how the off-centre mounting
squeezed the paste to one end.
</p>

<p>
This is the cleaned front side of the CPU.  Nothing much to see here, the visible damage is on its back.

<a name="REASONING"></a>
<h3>Reasoning</h3>
<p>
  We really don't know what is wrong here.  Let us list some observations and
  thoughts:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> The ambient temperature was in both cases quite low.

  </li><li> These are supposedly top-quality motherboard (We've had about 50 ASUS
  motherboard over the years, and only had one failure).

  </li><li> The offset mounting does not look right to us.  But this is how things
  are supposed to be done.

  </li><li> It is possible that we caused the 2nd CPU failure by inadequate mounting
  of the heat sink.  It surely seems bizarre to have the thermal paste squeezed
  like shown on the pictures above!

  </li><li> But note that the 1st failure happened with a more centred heat sink.
  We only made the off-centre mounting for the 2nd system as to minimise the
  risk of a repeated system failure.

  </li><li> The so-called TDP of the Ryzen 9950X is 170W.  The used heat sinks are
  specified to dissipate 165W, so that seems tight.  We have extra fans in the
  cases and a low ambient temperature, making these 5W seem negligible.  But of
  course, this is not completely kosher.

  </li><li> We have a sister system for the 9950X, a 7950X which is similarly
  configured and built.  That system actually seems to run slightly hotter, but
  it has been stable for a long time (under the same crazy load!).

  </li><li> The systems were under maximal load at the time their CPUs died, running
  very tight handcrafted asm loops sustaining one MULX per cycle.  That might
  be a "hot" instruction.

  </li><li> Did the CPUs die of heat stroke? Modern CPUs measure their temperature
  and clock down if they get too hot, don't they?

  </li><li> We don't overclock or overvolt or play other teen games with our
  hardware.

  </li><li> The extremely thin layer of thermal paste which resulted from the
  off-centre heat sink mount, might seem fine.  We however suspect that there
  might be a problem, as when the system heats and cools, things bend a little.
  With a remaining layer of thermal paste, such bending will not create any
  void as the paste's elasticity will maintain some contact.  When the thermal
  paste is squeezed away as with the suggested Noctua mounting, an
  ever-so-slight void between the CPU and the heat sink might be created.

  </li><li> Neither of the 9950X CPUs died immediately, instead they died the exact
  same way after a couple of months at high load.  This seems to suggest a
  gradual but predictable degradation.
</li></ul>

I was doing it in VisualWorks Smalltalk, he was doing his in straight C and X Windows. Competition aside, both of us built multi window complex graphical design tools that front ended heavy duty simulators, managed various batch jobs, tons of IO, parsing, and lots of color graphic drawing (mine was for fuel assembly (pin and axial enrichments) design, and his was for core layout (where the assemblies go during each reload)). The graphics were simpler (no antialiasing, any alpha we did with clever dithering tricks, not much in the way of animations, though we did each roll some). Both even stored /retrieved into a sort of database (a homegrown data versioning system). But... it was just one of each us for each "app".</p><p>Sadly, all Ux development seems orders of more magnitude complicated and beuqacratic now days.

                    Under EU law, Apple is required to give its users more freedom to install apps that are not listed in the official App Store. This allows for easier access to software that's typically prohibited by Apple, including the popular iTorrent BitTorrent client. The iTorrent client built a steady user base over the past year, but that came to an abrupt end when Apple decided to revoke the developer's alternative distribution rights. 
        </p>

In the EU, however, these types of apps have been available for more than a year through third-party app stores. </p>
<p>This breakthrough was a direct result of the EU’s Digital Markets Act (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Markets_Act">DMA</a>) that went into effect last year, requiring Apple to allow apps to be installed through third-party stores.</p>
<p><a href="https://altstore.io/">AltStore Pal</a> is one of the most popular altstores in the EU. Soon after it launched, two torrent clients were <a href="https://tweakers.net/nieuws/224724/eerste-ios-torrentclients-komen-beschikbaar-voor-europese-iphone-gebruikers.html">made available</a>: iTorrent and qBitControl. This was a notable milestone that AltStore actively <a href="https://www.threads.com/@altstoreio/post/C90CNunJIY8/">promoted</a> on social media.</p>

<p>AltStore PAL assured its users that these apps were put through a vetting process to ensure that they are secure. And indeed, in the months that followed, many people installed and used the torrent clients without problems. </p>
<h2>Apple Bars iTorrent Distribution</h2>
<p>While alternative app stores operate independently and are required by EU law, Apple is still in a position to exert some control. This became apparent a few weeks ago, when <a href="https://github.com/XITRIX/iTorrent">iTorrent</a> users suddenly ran into trouble when installing the app. </p>
<p>In July, several users <a href="https://github.com/XITRIX/iTorrent/issues/401">complained</a> that they were unable to download iTorrent from AltStore PAL. Initially the cause of the problem was unclear but the app’s developer, XITRIX, later confirmed that Apple itself had stepped in.</p>
<p>Apparently, Apple had revoked the developer’s “alternative distribution” right, which is required to publish apps in alternative stores, including AltStore PAL.</p>
<center><em>Rights revoked</em></center><br><center><picture loading="lazy" decoding="async">

</center>
<p>Given Apple’s <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/apple-bans-bittorrent-software-090511/">long history</a> of <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/apple-boots-bittorrent-app-from-iphone-store-101006/">banning</a> torrent apps from its own store, it’s tempting to conclude that the company stepped in for the same reason here. For now, however, there’s no confirmation that’s indeed the case.</p>
<h2>Developer Responds</h2>
<p>Speaking directly with TorrentFreak, iTorrent developer Daniil Vinogradov (XITRIX) says that Apple did not reach out to him regarding the revocation of his alternative EU distribution rights. </p>
<p>Soon after the issues appeared, Vinogradov sent a support request to Apple seeking clarification, but that wasn’t helpful either. Instead, Apple responded with a generic message related to App Store issues. </p>
<p>After another follow-up last week, Apple informed the developer that their escalation team is looking into it, but nothing further. “I still have no idea if it was my fault or Apple’s, and their responses make no sense,” Vinogradov says. </p>
<h2>AltStore in the Dark, Apple remains quiet</h2>
<p>AltStore PAL is not responsible for the issues, but it has also sprung into action. Co-founder Shane Gill informs TorrentFreak that they requested clarification from Apple but are still in the dark about the company’s reasons to intervene. </p>
<p>“I can confirm that we are in communication with Apple about this issue. We’ve told them what’s going wrong, and they said they’re looking into it, but we haven’t gotten any further information as of yet,” Gill says.</p>
<p>For now, there is no evidence that the ‘BitTorrent’ link is the cause of the problem. According to Gill, Apple has never provided AltStore with any guidelines or warnings on specific app categories.</p>
<p>Apple has not responded publicly yet either. When we reached out, the company asked us to call them, but our call went unanswered. The same applies to the follow-up requests we sent via email over the past few days.</p>
<p>While there may be a perfectly logical explanation for iTorrent’s revoked rights, Apple’s handling of the matter so far only fuels speculation. Some might even argue that the lack of transparency in revoking distribution rights violates the letter or the spirit of the EU’s Digital Markets Act. </p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                
                <p>I first ran into Forth about 20 years ago when reading a book about
<a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-embedded-hardware/0596007558/">designing embedded hardware</a>.
The reason I got the book back then was to actually learn more about the HW
aspects, so having skimmed the Forth chapter I just registered an "oh, this is neat"
mental note and moved on with my life. Over the last two decades I
heard about Forth a few more times here and there, such as that time when
<a href="https://factorcode.org/">Factor</a> was talked about for a brief period, maybe
10-12 years ago or so.</p>
<p>It always occupied a slot in the "weird language" category inside my brain, and
I never paid it much attention. Until June this year, when a couple of factors
combined fortuitously:</p>
<ul>
<li>After spending much of the <a href="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/archives/2025">earlier part of 2025</a>
exploring the inner workings
of LLMs and digging in random mathy and algorithmic topics, I had an itch
to just write some code.</li>
<li>I somehow found <a href="https://ratfactor.com/forth/the_programming_language_that_writes_itself.html">Dave Gauer's page about Forth</a>
and also the one on <a href="https://ratfactor.com/forth/implementing">Implementing a Forth</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>And something clicked. I'm going to implement a Forth, because... why not?</p>
<p>So I spent much of my free hacking time over the past two months learning
about Forth and implementing <em>two</em> of them.</p>
<div id="forth-the-user-level-and-the-hacker-level">
<h2>Forth: the user level and the hacker level</h2>
<p>It's useful to think of Forth (at least <a href="https://forth-standard.org/">standard Forth</a>,
not offshoots like Factor) as having two different "levels":</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>User</strong> level: you just want to use the language to write programs. Maybe
you're indeed bringing up new hardware, and find Forth a useful
calculator + REPL + script language. You don't care about Forth's
implementation or its soul, you just want to complete your task.</li>
<li><strong>Hacker</strong> level: you're interested in the deeper soul of Forth. Isn't it
amazing that even control flow constructs like <tt><span>IF...THEN</span></tt> or loops like
<tt><span>BEGIN...UNTIL</span></tt> are just Forth words, and if you wanted, you could implement
your own control flow constructs and have them be first-class citizens, as
seamless and efficient as the standard ones?</li>
</ol>
<p>Another way to look at it (useful if you belong to a certain crowd) is that
user-level Forth is like Lisp without macros, and hacker-level Forth has macros
enabled. Lisp can still be great and useful without macros, but macros take
it to an entire new level and also unlock the deeper soul of the language.</p>
<p>This distinction will be important when discussing my Forth implementations
below.</p>
</div>
<div id="goforth-and-ctil">
<h2>goforth and ctil</h2>
<p><img alt="Logo of goforth" src="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/images/pages/goforth-logo-sm.png"></p><p>There's a certain way Forth is supposed to be implemented; this is how it was
originally designed, and if you get closer to the hacker level, it
becomes apparent that you're pretty much required to implement it this way -
otherwise supporting all of the language's standard words will be very
difficult. I'm talking about the classical approach of a linked dictionary,
where a word is represented as a "threaded" list <a href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-reference-1">[1]</a>, and this dictionary is
available for user code to augment and modify. Thus, much of the Forth
implementation can be written in Forth itself.</p>
<p>The first implementation I tried is stubbornly different. Can we just make a
pure interpreter? This is what <a href="https://github.com/eliben/goforth">goforth</a>
is trying to explore (the Go implementation located in the root directory of
that repository). Many built-in words are supported - definitely enough to
write useful programs - and compilation
(the definition of new Forth words using <tt>: word ... ;</tt>) is implemented by
storing the actual string following the word name in the dictionary, so it can
be interpreted when the word is invoked.</p>
<p>This was an interesting approach and in some sense, it "works". For the user
level of Forth, this is perfectly usable (albeit slow). However, it's
insufficient for the hacker level, because the host language interpreter (the
one in Go) has all the control, so it's impossible to implement <tt><span>IF...THEN</span></tt> in
Forth, for example (it has to be implemented in the host language).</p>
<p>That was a fun way to get a deeper sense of what Forth is about, but I did want
to implement the hacker level as well, so the second implementation -
<a href="https://github.com/eliben/goforth/tree/main/ctil">ctil</a> - does just that.
It's inspired by the <a href="http://git.annexia.org/?p=jonesforth.git">jonesforth</a>
assembly implementation, but done in C instead <a href="#footnote-2" id="footnote-reference-2">[2]</a>.</p>
<p>ctil actually lets us implement major parts of Forth in Forth itself. For
example, <tt>variable</tt>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>variable</span><span> </span><span>create</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span> </span><span>cells</span><span> </span><span>allot</span><span> </span><span>;</span><span></span>
</pre></div>
<p>Conditionals:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>\ IF, ELSE, THEN work together to compile to lower-level branches.</span><span></span>
<span>\</span><span></span>
<span>\ IF ... THEN compiles to:</span><span></span>
<span>\   0BRANCH OFFSET true-part rest</span><span></span>
<span>\ where OFFSET is the offset of rest</span><span></span>
<span>\</span><span></span>
<span>\ IF ... ELSE ... THEN compiles to :</span><span></span>
<span>\   0BRANCH OFFSET true-part BRANCH OFFSET2 false-part rest</span><span></span>
<span>\ where OFFSET is the offset of false-part and OFFSET2 is the offset of rest</span><span></span>
<span>:</span><span> </span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>immediate</span><span></span>
<span>  </span><span>'</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>branch</span><span> </span><span>,</span><span></span>
<span>  </span><span>here</span><span></span>
<span>  </span><span>0</span><span> </span><span>,</span><span></span>
<span>  </span><span>;</span><span></span>

<span>:</span><span> </span><span>then</span><span> </span><span>immediate</span><span></span>
<span>  </span><span>dup</span><span></span>
<span>  </span><span>here</span><span> </span><span>swap</span><span> </span><span>-</span><span></span>
<span>  </span><span>swap</span><span></span>
<span>  </span><span>!</span><span> </span><span>;</span><span></span>

<span>:</span><span> </span><span>else</span><span> </span><span>immediate</span><span></span>
<span>  </span><span>'</span><span> </span><span>branch</span><span> </span><span>,</span><span></span>
<span>  </span><span>here</span><span></span>
<span>  </span><span>0</span><span> </span><span>,</span><span></span>
<span>  </span><span>swap</span><span></span>
<span>  </span><span>dup</span><span></span>
<span>  </span><span>here</span><span> </span><span>swap</span><span> </span><span>-</span><span></span>
<span>  </span><span>swap</span><span></span>
<span>  </span><span>!</span><span> </span><span>;</span><span></span>
</pre></div>
<p>These are actual examples of ctil's "prelude" - a Forth file loaded before any
user code. If you understand Forth, this code is actually rather mind-blowing.
We compile <tt>IF</tt> and the other words by directly laying our their low-level
representation in memory, and different words communicate with each other
using the data stack <em>during compilation</em>.</p>
</div>
<div id="thoughts-on-forth-itself">
<h2>Thoughts on Forth itself</h2>
<p>Forth made perfect sense in the historic context in which it was created in
the early 1970s. Imagine having some HW connected to your computer (a telescope
in the case of Forth's creator), and you have to interact with it. In terms
of languages at your disposal - you don't have much, even BASIC wasn't invented
yet. Perhaps your machine still didn't have a C compiler ported to it; C
compilers aren't simple, and C isn't very great for exploratory scripting
anyway. So you mostly just have your assembly language and whatever you build
on top.</p>
<p>Forth is easy to implement in assembly and it gives you a much higher-level
language; you can use it as a calculator, as a REPL, and as a DSL for pretty
much anything due to its composable nature.</p>
<p>Forth certainly has interesting aspects; it's a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concatenative_programming_language">concatenative language</a>,
and thus inherently <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacit_programming">point-free</a>.
A classical example is that instead of writing the following in a more
traditional syntax:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>eat(bake(prove(mix(ingredients))))
</pre></div>
<p>You just write this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>ingredients mix prove bake eat
</pre></div>
<p>There is no need to explicitly pass parameters, or to explicitly return results.
Everything happens implicitly on the stack.</p>
<p>This is useful for REPL-style programming where you use your language not
necessarily for writing large programs, but more for interactive instructions to
various HW devices. This dearth of syntax is also what makes Forth simple
to implement.</p>
<p>All that said, in my mind Forth is firmly in the "weird language" category;
it's instructive to learn and to implement, but I wouldn't actually use it
for anything real these days. The stack-based programming model is cool for
very terse point-free programs, but it's not particularly readable and hard
to reason about without extensive comments, in my experience.</p>
<p>Consider the implementation of a pretty standard Forth word: <tt>+!</tt>. It expects
and address at the top of stack, and an addend below it. It adds the addend to
the value stored at that address. Here's a Forth implementation from
ctil's prelude:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>+!</span><span>        </span><span>( addend addr -- )</span><span></span>
<span>  </span><span>tuck</span><span>      </span><span>( addr addend addr )</span><span></span>
<span>  </span><span>@</span><span>         </span><span>( addr addend value-at-addr )</span><span></span>
<span>  </span><span>+</span><span>         </span><span>( addr updated-value )</span><span></span>
<span>  </span><span>swap</span><span>      </span><span>( updated-value addr )</span><span></span>
<span>  </span><span>!</span><span> </span><span>;</span><span></span>
</pre></div>
<p>Look at that stack wrangling! It's really hard to follow what goes where without
the detailed comments showing the stack layout on the right of each instruction
(a common practice for Forth programs). Sure, we can create additional words
that would make this simpler, but that just increases the lexicon of words to
know.</p>
<p>My point is, there's fundamental difficulty here. When you see this C code:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>int</span><span> </span><span>func</span><span>(</span><span>int</span><span> </span><span>a</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>int</span><span> </span><span>b</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span>
<span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>foo</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>bar</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>));</span><span></span>
<span>}</span><span></span>
</pre></div>
<p>Even without any documentation, you can immediately know several important
things:</p>
<ul>
<li><tt>bar</tt> has one parameter and one return value</li>
<li><tt>foo</tt> has two parameters and one return value</li>
<li><tt>func</tt> also has two parameters and one return value</li>
<li>It's immediately obvious how the various values flow from one function call
to the next.</li>
</ul>
<p>Written in Forth <a href="#footnote-3" id="footnote-reference-3">[3]</a>:</p>

<p>How can you know the arity of the functions without adding explicit comments?
Sure, if you have a handful of words like <tt>bar</tt> and <tt>foo</tt> you know like the
back of your hand, this is easy. But imagine reading a large, unfamiliar code
base full of code like this and trying to comprehend it.</p>

pleasantly challenging hump of understanding to overcome, and you gain valuable
insights into stack machines, interpretation vs. compilation and mixing these
levels of abstraction in cool ways.</p>
<p>Also, implementing programming languages
from scratch is fun! It's hard to beat the feeling of getting to interact with
your implementation for the first time, and then iterating on improving it
and making it more featureful. <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=One+More+Turn+Syndrome">Just one more word</a>!</p>

peak performance.</p>
<p>But where's the fun in doing things the way they were supposed to be
done? Besides, jonesforth is already a perfectly fine Forth implementation
in assembly, so I wouldn't have learned much by just copying it.</p>
<p>I had a lot of fun coding in C for this one; it's been a while since I
last wrote non-trivial amounts of C, and I found it very enjoyable.</p>

Once again, SpaceX aimed to perform several experiments with Super Heavy, including a fuel-conserving controlled flip during descent and a landing burn that featured "unique engine configurations," according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.spacex.com/launches/starship-flight-10" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.spacex.com/launches/starship-flight-10" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">company mission preview</a>.</p><p>That all seemed to go according to plan today, as did Super Heavy's final move: It made a controlled splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico about seven minutes after launch, just as SpaceX drew it up.</p><p>Ship came through today as well — and it had considerably more work to do. The upper stage separated from Super Heavy on time and achieved its desired suborbital trajectory. The, during a five-minute stretch that began about 20 minutes after launch, Ship deployed eight dummy versions of SpaceX's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.space.com/spacex-starlink-satellites.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.space.com/spacex-starlink-satellites.html">Starlink</a> internet satellites, a critical capability it tried but failed to demonstrate on all three of this year's previous Starship flights.</p><p>"Just a reminder, we're on a suborbital trajectory," SpaceX spokesperson Dan Huot said during live commentary. "These satellites on that exact same suborbital trajectory, they're going to burn up entirely."</p><p>And there will be many satellite deployments from Ship in the future, if all goes to plan: SpaceX is counting on Starship to finish building out its Starlink megaconstellation, which is already the biggest satellite network ever assembled. The giant rocket should carry at least 60 Starlinks at a time, Huot said.</p><p id="68e9928b-16f9-4cc8-80ac-a10167443cce">Then, about 38 minutes into the flight, Ship briefly ignited one of its engines. This was another big milestone for SpaceX; such in-space re-lights will be needed on operational Starship flights, to help power the vehicles to their distant destinations and to guide them down to Earth for safe touchdowns and reuse.</p><p>"Looks like we confirmed the relight of one of those center raptor engines second time we've done that," Lee said during live commentary. "Super exciting. Huge congrats to the team on this milestone."</p><p>"That was a cool light show," Huot added.</p><figure data-bordeaux-image-check="" id="307469cf-fbdd-4ab4-aa20-96cf6a089484"><div><p> <picture data-new-v2-image="true">

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://zed.dev/blog/bring-your-own-agent-to-zed">https://zed.dev/blog/bring-your-own-agent-to-zed</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45038710">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>You can now interact with third-party agents directly within Zed. To make this possible, we created the <a href="http://agentclientprotocol.com/">Agent Client Protocol (ACP)</a>, and we've partnered with Google to integrate <a href="https://cloud.google.com/gemini/docs/codeassist/gemini-cli">Gemini CLI</a> as the initial reference implementation.</p>
<p>Because software developers rely on diverse tools in a variety of different tech stacks, we see room for multiple agents competing to solve problems in different domains. Just as the Language Server Protocol unbundled language intelligence from monolithic IDEs, our goal with the Agent Client Protocol is to enable you to switch between multiple agents without switching your editor. If you're an agent developer, we're also giving you a fast and convenient user interface inside an IDE, so you can focus on building the best possible agent rather than forking VS Code.</p>
<h2 id="gemini-cli-in-zed"><a href="#gemini-cli-in-zed" aria-label="Copy heading link"><span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="10" height="10" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><line x1="4" x2="20" y1="9" y2="9"></line><line x1="4" x2="20" y1="15" y2="15"></line><line x1="10" x2="8" y1="3" y2="21"></line><line x1="16" x2="14" y1="3" y2="21"></line></svg></span><span>Gemini CLI in Zed</span></a></h2>
<p><figure><video src="https://customer-snccc0j9v3kfzkif.cloudflarestream.com/da3716b5effeea5452db7928145f3540/downloads/default.mp4" width="3840" height="2160" poster="https://zed.dev/img/post/extensible-agents/video-poster.webp" controls=""></video><figcaption>A walkthrough of Gemini CLI in Zed.</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>After shipping agentic editing earlier this year, the next big task on our roadmap was making that experience extensible. As luck would have it, that's around the time when Google decided to reach out. The Gemini CLI team was having a great experience using their agent in Zed's integrated terminal, and they wanted to explore what deeper integration could look like. As an open-source project with a ton of early traction, Gemini CLI seemed like a perfect way to drive the design of extensible agents in Zed with a concrete use case.</p>
<p>Command-line agents are cool because their simplicity makes them easy to run anywhere—including as a subprocess of another application. Zed was already running Gemini CLI inside our embedded terminal emulator, but we needed a more structured way of communicating than ANSI escape codes. So we defined a minimal set of JSON-RPC endpoints to relay user requests to the agent and render its responses. The result is the Agent Client Protocol, a lean framework that lets any client talk to any agent, as long as they follow the schema.</p>
<p>By running the same Gemini CLI as a subprocess speaking ACP, we surface the same underlying capabilities of the terminal-based experience, but tightly integrated into an environment that's purpose-built for software development. This unlocks features that are difficult to achieve outside of an editor, such as real-time edit visualization, multi-buffer reviews, and fluid navigation between code and agent interactions.</p>
<h2 id="introducing-the-agent-client-protocol"><a href="#introducing-the-agent-client-protocol" aria-label="Copy heading link"><span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="10" height="10" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><line x1="4" x2="20" y1="9" y2="9"></line><line x1="4" x2="20" y1="15" y2="15"></line><line x1="10" x2="8" y1="3" y2="21"></line><line x1="16" x2="14" y1="3" y2="21"></line></svg></span><span>Introducing the Agent Client Protocol</span></a></h2>
<div><figure><img src="https://zed.dev/img/acp/banner-dark.webp" alt="The Agent Client Protocol logo."><figcaption>The Agent Client Protocol logo.</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>ACP lets developers choose the tools that work best for their workflow. Any agent that speaks ACP can plug into a powerful UI, where the user can follow the agent around the codebase as it works, control its access to tools and MCP servers, and review all of its changes in a multi-buffer with full syntax highlighting and language server support. When you interact with third-party agents, nothing touches our servers, and we don't have access to your code. As with all Zed features and services, we never store or train on your data without your explicit consent.</p>
<p>The protocol is open-source under the Apache license; any agent can implement it, potentially building on Gemini CLI's implementation as a starting point. The protocol is also open for other clients to adopt, and we really hope to see uptake from other editors. That's why we worked with Oli Morris of <a href="https://github.com/olimorris/codecompanion.nvim">Code Companion</a> to bring support for ACP-compatible agents to Neovim users.</p>
<p>We have also updated Zed’s own in-process agent to use the same code paths as third-party agents, ensuring that any UI primitives we develop for our own agent can also be made available to external agents. Cleanly separating UI from the core of our agent has already improved our shipping velocity, and we're excited for you to try the new experience. Check out <a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/zed">the source code</a>, or <a href="https://zed.dev/download">download Zed to try it yourself</a>.</p>

<p>We believe the best tools come from openness. Just as the Language Server Protocol opened up IDEs to specialized tools, ACP creates space for an ecosystem of agents tailored to every developer's workflow. We appreciate Google’s open approach with Gemini CLI, which made this collaboration possible, and we're committed to the same. We intend to maintain enough control over the Agent Client Protocol to continue to push it forward quickly, while also evolving and versioning it carefully to encourage an ecosystem of agents and clients to develop.</p>
<p>We welcome contributions and feedback on ACP. We hope to see a lot more agents in Zed. We also hope to see other editors adopt the protocol. We're excited to see how our community experiments, innovates, and builds what's next in Zed.</p><hr><div><h3 id="looking-for-a-better-editor">Looking for a better editor?</h3>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
  <p>Most research on programming language performance asks a variation of a single question: how can we make some specific program faster?
Sometimes we may even investigate how we can use less memory.
This means a lot of research focuses solely on reducing the amount of resources needed to achieve some computational goal.</p>

<p>So, why on earth might we be interested in slowing down programs then?</p>

<h2 id="slowing-down-programs-is-surprisingly-useful">Slowing Down Programs is Surprisingly Useful!</h2>

<p>Making programs slower can be useful to find race conditions,
to simulate speedups, and to assess how accurate profilers are.</p>

<p>To detect race conditions,
we may want to use an approach similar to fuzzing.
Instead of exploring a program’s implementation
by varying its input,
we can explore different instruction interleavings, thread or event schedules,
by slowing down program parts to change timings.
This approach allows us to identify concurrency bugs
and is used by <a href="https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/osdi08/tech/full_papers/musuvathi/musuvathi.pdf">CHESS</a>, <a href="https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~shanlu/paper/eurosys23.pdf">WAFFLE</a>, and <a href="https://drops.dagstuhl.de/storage/00lipics/lipics-vol333-ecoop2025/LIPIcs.ECOOP.2025.9/LIPIcs.ECOOP.2025.9.pdf">NACD</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/plasma-umass/coz">Coz profiler</a> is an example of how slowing down programs can be used to simulate speedup.
With Coz, we can estimate whether an optimization is beneficial
before implementing it.
Coz simulates it by slowing down <em>all other</em> program parts.
The part we think might be optimizable stays at the same speed
it was before, but is now <em>virtually sped up</em>, which allows us to see
whether it gives enough of a benefit to justify a perhaps lengthy optimization project.</p>

<p>And, as mentioned before, we can also use it to assess how accurate profilers are.
Though, I’ll leave this for the next blog posts. :)</p>

<p>The current approaches to slowing down programs for these use cases are
rather coarse-grained though. Race detection often adapts the scheduler or uses, for example, APIs such as <code>Thread.sleep()</code>.
Similarly, Coz pauses the execution of the other threads.
<a href="https://plv.colorado.edu/papers/mytkowicz-pldi10.pdf">Work</a> on measuring whether profilers give actionable results,
inserts bytecodes into Java programs to compute Fibonacci numbers.</p>

<p>By using more fine-grained slowdowns,
we think we could make race detection, speedup estimation, and profiler accuracy assessments more precise. Thus, we looked into inserting slowdown instructions into basic blocks.</p>

<h2 id="which-x86-instructions-allow-us-to-consistently-slow-down-basic-blocks">Which x86 Instructions Allow us to Consistently Slow Down Basic Blocks?</h2>

<p>Let’s assume we run on some x86 processor, and we are looking at programs
from the perspective of processors.</p>

<p>When running a benchmark like <a href="https://github.com/smarr/are-we-fast-yet/blob/master/benchmarks/Java/src/Towers.java#L74">Towers</a>,
the OpenJDK’s HotSpot JVM may compile it to x86 instructions like this:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="nasm"><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

</pre></td><td><pre><span>mov</span> <span>dword</span> <span>ptr</span> <span>[</span><span>rsp</span><span>+</span><span>0x18</span><span>],</span> <span>r8d</span>
<span>mov</span> <span>dword</span> <span>ptr</span> <span>[</span><span>rsp</span><span>],</span> <span>ecx</span>
<span>mov</span> <span>qword</span> <span>ptr</span> <span>[</span><span>rsp</span><span>+</span><span>0x20</span><span>],</span> <span>rsi</span>
<span>mov</span> <span>ebx</span><span>,</span> <span>dword</span> <span>ptr</span> <span>[</span><span>rsi</span><span>+</span><span>0x10</span><span>]</span>
<span>mov</span> <span>r9d</span><span>,</span> <span>edx</span>
<span>cmp</span> <span>edx</span><span>,</span> <span>0x1</span>
<span>jnz</span> <span>0</span><span>x...</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>Bl</span><span>ock</span> <span>55</span><span>&gt;</span>	
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></figure>

<p>This is one of the basic blocks produced by HotSpot’s C2 compiler.
For our purposes, it suffices to see that there are some memory accesses
with the <code>mov</code> instructions, and we end up checking whether the <code>edx</code> register
contains the value 1. If that’s not the case, we jump to Block 55.
Otherwise, execution continues in the next basic block.
A key property of a basic block is that there’s no control flow inside of it,
which means once it starts executing, all of its instructions will execute.</p>

<p>Though, how can we slow it down?</p>

<p>x86 has many many different instructions one could try to insert into the block,
which each will probably consume CPU cycles.
However, modern CPUs try to execute as many instructions
as possible at the same time using out-of-order execution.
This means, instructions in our basic block
that do not directly depend on each other
might be executed at the same time.
For instance, the first three <code>mov</code> instructions access neither the same register
nor memory location. This means the order in which they are executed here does not matter.
Though, which optimizations CPUs apply depends on the program and the specific CPU generation,
or rather microarchitecture.</p>

<p>To find suitable instructions to slow down basic blocks,
we experimented only on an Intel Core i5-10600 CPU,
which has the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_Lake">Comet Lake-S microarchitecture</a>.
On other microarchitectures, things can be very different.</p>

<p>For the slowdown that we want, 
we can use <code>nop</code> or <code>mov regX, regX</code> instructions on Comet Lake-S.
This <code>mov</code> would move the value from register <code>X</code> to itself, so basically does nothing.
These two instructions give us a slowdown
that is small enough to slow down most blocks accurately to a desired target speed,
and the slowdown seems to affect only the specific block it is meant for.</p>

<p>Our basic block from earlier would then perhaps end up with <code>nop</code> instructions
interleaved after each instruction.
In practice, the number of instructions we need to insert
depends on how much time a basic block takes in the program.
Though, for illustration, it might look like this:</p>

</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></figure>

<p>We tried six different candidates, including a <code>push</code>-<code>pop</code> sequence, to get a better impression
of how Comet Lake-S deals with them.
For more details of how and what we tried, please have a look at our <a href="#paper">short paper below</a>, which we will present at the <a href="https://conf.researchr.org/home/icfp-splash-2025/vmil-2025#event-overview">VMIL workshop</a>.</p>

<p>When inserting these instructions into basic blocks,
so that each individual basic block
takes about twice as much time as before,
we end up with a program that indeed is overall twice as slow, as one would hope.
Even better, when we look at the Towers benchmark with the <a href="https://github.com/async-profiler/async-profiler">async-profiler</a> for HotSpot, and compare the proportions of run time it
attributes to each method, the slowed-down and the normal version
match almost perfectly, as <a href="#fig1">illustrated below</a>.
The same is not true for the other candidates we looked at.</p>

<figure id="fig1">

<figcaption><strong>Figure 1:</strong> A scatter plot per slowdown instruction with the median run-time percentage for the top six Java methods of Towers. The <em>X=Y</em> diagonal indicates that a method’s run‐time percentage remains the same with and without slowdown.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The paper has a few more details, including a more detailed analysis
of the slowdown each candidate introduces,
how precise the slowdown is for all basic blocks
in the benchmark, and whether it makes a difference when we put the slowdown
all at the beginning, interleaved, or at the end.</p>

<p>Of course, this work is merely a stepping stone to more interesting things,
which I will look at in a bit more detail in the next post.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Slowing down programs has surprisingly many use cases: it helps finding race conditions, enables speedup estimation, and allows us to assess a profiler’s accuracy. Yet, slowing down a program is complicated because today’s CPUs and runtime systems can optimize execution on the fly, making it challenging to preserve a program’s performance behavior to avoid introducing bias.</p>

<p>We evaluate six x86 instruction candidates for controlled and fine-grained slowdown including NOP, MOV, and PAUSE. We tested each candidate’s ability to achieve an overhead of 100%, to maintain the profiler-observable performance behavior, and whether slowdown placement within basic blocks influences results. On an Intel Core i5-10600, our experiments suggest that only NOP and MOV instructions are suitable. We believe these experiments can guide future research on advanced developer tooling that utilizes fine-granular slowdown at the machine-code level.</p>

	<h2>Harness the Power and Simplicity of Plain Text</h2>

	<p>
		Plain text has been around for decades and it's here to stay. <strong>Monodraw</strong> allows you to easily create text-based art (like diagrams, layouts, flow charts) and visually represent algorithms, data structures, binary formats and more. Because it's all just text, it can be easily embedded almost anywhere. Of course, exporting as images is also supported (PNG and SVG).
	</p>

        <h2><img src="https://monodraw.helftone.com/static/images/diagram-icon.png" width="44px"> Diagrams</h2>
        <p>
          A picture is worth a thousand words. A diagram is probably worth twice as much. Enhance your technical <a href="https://github.com/dguerri/vagrant-ansible-openstack#architecture---network-diagram">documentation</a> (code, specs) with easy to comprehend textual art. Visualisation of data structures, algorithms and data formats plays a crucial role in understanding. You will be reading the code more often than writing it, so why not make it much easier to grasp.

          Combine the simplicity of plain text with the power of mind mapping. Monodraw gives you the freedom to manage your textual data exactly the way you want. Move text around anywhere in the infinite canvas – no need to be constrained by the linear structure of a text file.

    <div><p>
      Monodraw is designed for the Mac from the ground up – everything from the text layout engine to the interface is made to take advantage of macOS. Like all native apps, it just works the way you expect. When you make a mistake, undo is always ready to come to the rescue. Exporting your text art could not get any easier – just copy and paste it into your favourite text editor. </p><p><a href="http://blog.helftone.com/ascii-art-unicode/">Not displaying correctly?</a></p></div>

<h3 dir="auto">Body</h3>
<p dir="auto">Over the past few months, Github has been getting slower and slower on Safari. It has now reached a point where it is unusable.</p>
<p dir="auto">Displaying any pull request with more than a thousand lines changed or even browsing any file with a thousand or more lines of code is fully broken.</p>
<p dir="auto">What happens:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>In Activity Monitor, the rendering process is running at 100%.</li>
<li>Rendering the page is so slow, Safari displays blank space when scrolling up and down.</li>
<li>Any interactive features like search is so slow it doesn't work.</li>
<li>Pull request review is extremely painful (scrolling back and forth is impossible to do quickly, posting comments is extremely slow, even checking the "Viewed" checkbox sometimes takes several seconds, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">I have a 16-inch MacBook Pro with a 16-cores Apple M4 Max and 48GB of RAM, using it plugged in with performance mode enabled. It's one of the most powerful laptop on the market today. Github is the only website I know that doesn't run on it.</p>
<p dir="auto">This is Safari specific, Google Chrome on the same machine performs way better (although it still struggles with very large pull requests).</p>
