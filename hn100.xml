<!-- cache hit 939:single/related:2baac0613a1284f273d3f0fa2635848a --><!-- empty -->
<p>The Federal Communications Commission today voted to move ahead with a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/09/fcc-details-plan-to-restore-the-net-neutrality-rules-repealed-by-ajit-pai/">plan</a> that would restore net neutrality rules and common-carrier regulation of Internet service providers.</p>
<p>In a 3-2 party-line vote, the FCC approved Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel's <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-397309A1.pdf">Notice of Proposed Rulemaking</a> (NPRM), which seeks public comment on the broadband regulation plan. The comment period will officially open after the proposal is published in the Federal Register, but the docket is already active and can be <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/search/search-filings/results?q=(proceedings.name:(%2223-320%22))">found here</a>.</p>
<p>The proposal would reclassify broadband as a telecommunications service, a designation that allows the FCC to regulate ISPs under the common-carrier provisions in Title II of the Communications Act. The plan is essentially the same as what the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/02/fcc-votes-for-net-neutrality-a-ban-on-paid-fast-lanes-and-title-ii/">FCC did in 2015</a> when it used Title II to prohibit fixed and mobile Internet providers from blocking or throttling traffic or giving priority to Web services in exchange for payment.</p>
<p>The Obama-era net neutrality rules were eliminated during Trump's presidency when then-Chairman Ajit Pai <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/12/goodbye-net-neutrality-ajit-pais-fcc-votes-to-allow-blocking-and-throttling/">led a repeal</a> that reclassified broadband as an information service, returning it to the less strict regulatory regime of Title I. The current FCC likely would have acted much sooner but there was a 2-2 deadlock until last month when the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/09/senate-confirms-biden-fcc-nominee-finally-giving-democrats-a-3-2-majority/">Senate confirmed</a> Biden nominee Anna Gomez to fill the empty spot.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>After the comment period, the FCC is likely to finalize the rulemaking and put the 2015 rules back in place. The broadband industry will likely then sue the FCC in an attempt to nullify the rulemaking.</p>
<h2>Chair: Broadband needs “expert agency”</h2>
<p>"Today, there is no expert agency ensuring that the Internet is fast, open, and fair... Today, we begin a process to make this right. We propose to reinstate enforceable, bright-line rules to prevent blocking, throttling, and paid prioritization," Rosenworcel said at the commission meeting.</p>
<p>Title II regulation isn't just about net neutrality, Rosenworcel said, arguing that the reclassification will give the FCC more authority to protect national security on broadband networks. "When we stripped state-affiliated companies from China of their authority to operate in the United States, that action did not extend to broadband services, thanks to the retreat from Title II. This is a national security loophole that needs to be addressed," she said.</p>
<p>Without Title II, the FCC has "limited authority to incorporate updated cybersecurity standards into our network policies," she said. The same is true of protecting privacy on broadband networks, she said.</p>
<p>"The law requires telecommunications providers to protect the confidentiality of the proprietary information of their customers," Rosenworcel said. "That means that these providers cannot sell your location data, among other sensitive information. Those privacy protections currently extend to voice customers but not broadband subscribers. Does that really make sense? Do we want our broadband providers selling what we do online? Scraping our service for a payday from new artificial intelligence models? Doing any of this without our permission?"</p>
<p>Disputing claims that the FCC is overstepping its authority, Rosenworcel said the "rules are legally sustainable because they track those that were upheld in court in 2016—from front to back."</p>

        <p>By analyzing fossilized dental plaque, scientists have found new evidence that early Europeans ate seaweed and other aquatic plants.</p>

<p>Today, dental hygienists diligently scrape plaque and tartar off our teeth during regular cleanings. But before modern dentisty, this debris simply built up on early humans’ teeth and gums.</p>

<p>Fortunately for archaeologists, some of that plaque has survived for thousands of years.</p>

<p>In a study published this week in the journal&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-41671-2"><em>Nature Communications</em></a>, researchers analyzed samples of preserved dental plaque from the remains of 74 early humans unearthed at 28 European archaeological sites. Some of the teeth were around 2,000 years old, while others were more than 8,000 years old, reports <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/17/europe/early-europeans-seaweed-dental-plaque-scn/index.html">CNN</a>’s Katie Hunt.</p>

<p>They found the chemical biomarkers of seaweed and aquatic plants in 26 samples, which suggests that early humans were eating—or, at the very least, chewing—these bounties from the sea. More specifically, they detected red, green and brown seaweed, as well as pondweed and a relative of the water lily.</p>

<p>The results indicate humans were eating aquatic plants as early as the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Mesolithic">Mesolithic</a> period, through the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Neolithic">Neolithic</a> period and into the early&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Middle-Ages">Middle Ages</a>. That timespan is significant, as archaeologists had long assumed that the introduction of farming during the Neolithic era meant that early humans largely abandoned such foods from the sea, according to a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1004513?">statement</a> from the researchers.</p>

<p>Additionally, aquatic plants weren’t only a coastal menu specialty. The researchers also found evidence in teeth from a site in southeast Spain located nearly 50 miles from the water.</p>

<p>How early humans prepared these aquatic plants is unclear—did they eat them raw or cook them? Scientists also don’t know how much of their diets consisted of aquatic plants, as the biomarkers of other types of plants “tend to survive less well in archaeological contexts compared to algae,” study co-author&nbsp;<a href="https://www.york.ac.uk/archaeology/people/research-staff/stephen-buckley/">Stephen Buckley</a>, an archaeologist at England’s University of York, tells CNN.</p>

<p>“We don’t necessarily get a full picture of all foods consumed, which can depend on prevailing environmental conditions,” he adds.</p>

<p>The team thinks early humans may have understood the nutritional benefits of seaweed and aquatic plants—just as we do now. These days, seaweed has&nbsp;<a href="https://fortune.com/2022/11/07/the-seaweed-superfood-revolution-could-end-world-hunger-and-save-the-planet/">been called a “superfood,”</a> thanks to its abundance, rapid growth and vitamin and mineral content.</p>

<p>“Seaweed is great,” says study co-author&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/humanities/staff/karenhardy/">Karen Hardy</a>, an archaeologist at the University of Glasgow, to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2397961-people-around-europe-have-eaten-seaweed-for-thousands-of-years/"><em>New Scientist</em></a>’s Chen Ly. “It’s available, it’s nutritious, it’s local, it’s renewable.”</p>

<p>It’s also environmentally friendly and may help halt human-caused climate change by “absorbing carbon emissions, regenerating marine ecosystems, creating biofuel and renewable plastics as well as generating marine protein,” as&nbsp;<a href="https://time.com/5848994/seaweed-climate-change-solution/"><em>Time</em></a>’s Mélissa Godin wrote in 2020.</p>

<p>The researchers hope their findings will encourage more people to start adding seaweed and aquatic plants to their diets.</p>

<p>“It would be a wonderful thing to think that people actually connected in and thought, ‘Well, if we ate it before, we can start eating it again,’” Hardy tells the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/oct/17/seaweed-was-common-food-in-europe-for-thousands-of-years-researchers-find"><em>Guardian</em></a>’s Nicola Davis.</p>

<p>In 2015, researchers reported a surprising discovery that stoked industry-wide security concerns—an attack called RowHammer that could corrupt, modify, or steal sensitive data when a simple user-level application repeatedly accessed certain regions of DDR memory chips. In the coming years, memory chipmakers scrambled to develop defenses that prevented the attack, mainly by limiting the number of times programs could open and close the targeted chip regions in a given time.</p>
<p>Recently, researchers devised a new method for creating the same types of RowHammer-induced bitflips even on a newer generation of chips, known as DDR4, that have the RowHammer mitigations built into them. Known as RowPress, the new attack works not by “hammering” carefully selected regions repeatedly, but instead by leaving them open for longer periods than normal. Bitflips refer to the phenomenon of bits represented as ones change to zeros and vice versa.</p>
<p>Further amplifying the vulnerability of DDR4 chips to read-disturbance attacks—the generic term for inducing bitflips through abnormal accesses to memory chips—RowPress bitflips can be enhanced by combining them with RowHammer accesses. Curiously, raising the temperature of the chip also intensifies the effect.</p>
<p>“We demonstrate a proof of concept RowPress program that can cause bitflips in a real system that already employs protections against RowHammer,” Onur Mutlu, a professor at ETH Zürich and a co-author of a recently published paper titled <a href="https://people.inf.ethz.ch/omutlu/pub/RowPress_isca23.pdf">RowPress: Amplifying Read Disturbance in Modern DRAM Chips</a>, wrote in an email. “Note that this is not in itself an attack. It simply shows that bitflips are possible and plenty, which can easily form the basis of an attack. As many prior works in security have shown, once you can induce a bitflip, you can use that bitflip for various attacks.”</p>                                            
                                                        
<h2>DIMMs, bits, and cosmic rays</h2>
<p>The basic building block of DRAM (dynamic random access memory) is a storage cell. Each cell comprises a capacitor and a transistor and stores a single bit of data. When a bit is put into a memory cell, the transistor is used to charge or discharge the capacitor. A charged capacitor is represented with a 1, while a discharged capacitor is represented with a 0. Most often, DRAM cells are organized into a rectangular array of rows and columns.</p>

<p>These rows and columns are arranged into ranks and banks to form what’s known as the dual in-line memory module. Better known as a DIMM, this rectangular stick plugs into the computer motherboard. When a computer accesses a chunk of memory, it opens the rows to the cells storing the desired data and transfers it to the CPU.</p>

<p>Bitflips have long been known as a rare, naturally occurring phenomenon. They occur when an unexpected flow of electrons within a transistor’s gates changes the voltage between the source, or the part of the circuit where flow originates, and the sink, where the flow is received. During a 2003 election in Belgium, cosmic rays from outer space are widely believed to have caused bitflips that gave a political candidate an <a href="https://radiolab.org/podcast/bit-flip">additional 4,096 votes</a> before being corrected. (The number 4,096, which can also be expressed as 2<sup>12</sup>, suggests there was a bitflip in the 12th bit.)</p>
<p>Then, in 2014, discovered a previously unknown way to <a href="https://users.ece.cmu.edu/%7Eyoonguk/papers/kim-isca14.pdf">artificially induce bitflips</a> at will. When a computer repeatedly hammered a DRAM row, they found they could induce bitflips in adjacent rows. In RowHammer parlance, the row that gets hammered is known as the aggressor row. The row where bits are flipped is known as the victim row.</p>

                                  <p>Peter Thiel has worn many hats over the years: Silicon Valley founder, Trump megadonor, cryptocurrency booster, democracy skeptic.</p><p>But there is yet another facet to Thiel, one that has remained secret until now: FBI informant.</p><p>In the summer of 2021, Insider has learned, Thiel began providing information as a "confidential human source," or CHS, to Johnathan Buma, a Los Angeles-based FBI agent who specializes in investigating political corruption and foreign-influence campaigns.&nbsp;</p><p>Charles Johnson, a longtime associate of Thiel's and a notorious figure in the far-right movement that Thiel has subsidized for a decade, told Insider in a statement that he helped recruit the billionaire as an informant by introducing him to Buma.</p><p>A source with knowledge of Thiel's relationship to the FBI, whose identity is known to Insider but who insisted on anonymity, corroborated Johnson's account, telling Insider that Johnson brokered a relationship between Thiel and Buma. Insider was able to confirm through an additional source that the FBI added Thiel to its formal roster of registered informants.</p><p>Another source close to Thiel told Insider that while they could not confirm that Thiel was a CHS, Thiel did speak to Buma occasionally. The source said that any assistance Thiel might have provided to the FBI should be understood as part of Thiel's gradual distancing of himself from Trump and the broader MAGA movement, which has vigorously criticized the FBI and other federal law-enforcement agencies.</p><h2><strong>Valuable information on a recurring basis</strong></h2><p>The FBI maintains a vast network of informants to keep tabs on organized crime, terrorist threats, extremist groups, and other criminal and intelligence targets. These sources, according to the bureau's <a href="https://vault.fbi.gov/confidential-human-source-policy-guide-1018pg/confidential-human-source-policy-guide-1018pg-part-01-of-01" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-analytics-product-module="body_link">Confidential Human Source Policy Guide</a>, are more than casual tipsters.&nbsp;</p><p>Confidential human sources enter "into a relationship with the FBI, and that relationship will forever affect the life of that individual," the guide says. "[They] will be either an 'FBI source' or a 'former FBI source' and, in turn, his or her conduct or misconduct will reflect upon the FBI." As such, the process for recruiting and maintaining such sources is highly regulated, requiring multiple layers of approval. Only people who are able to provide "valuable information … on a recurring basis" are granted CHS status, according to the policy.</p><figure data-type="img" data-e2e-name="image-figure-image" data-media-container="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject">

The information he passed on about foreign contacts and Silicon Valley intrigue was reviewed and "validated," or cross-checked against other sources, by his case agents and their colleagues.</p><p>Thiel did not respond to multiple requests for comment. A Thiel spokesperson stopped responding to inquiries after being told that Insider was reporting on Thiel's relationship with the FBI.&nbsp;</p><p>The FBI's national press office and Scott Horton, an attorney who represents Johnathan Buma, both declined to comment.</p><h2><strong>No reporting on political ties</strong></h2><p>Thiel is a citizen of Germany, the United States, and New Zealand; as of last year,&nbsp; he was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/15/technology/peter-thiel-malta-citizenship.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-product-module="body_link">reportedly in the process</a> of acquiring yet another passport, from Malta. In 2016, he donated $1.25 million to Trump's campaign and endorsed him from the stage at the Republican National Convention. After Trump won, Thiel served on his transition team.</p><p>Johnson, who said that he was also an informant for Buma, told Insider that he believes that Thiel's reporting to the FBI was largely limited to foreign contacts and attempts by foreign governments to penetrate Silicon Valley. Thiel has <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/15/peter-thiel-reportedly-says-the-fbi-and-cia-should-investigate-google.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-product-module="body_link">publicly called on the FBI to investigate Google's ties to the Chinese government</a>.</p><p>Thiel, Johnson said, was directed by the FBI not to report on his interactions with Donald Trump or other US political figures.</p><p>Many of the politicians that Thiel has bankrolled — including Trump, Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio, and Blake Masters, a former Arizona senatorial candidate — have repeatedly attacked the bureau and its leadership in public. In 2022, Vance, whose campaign and affiliated PACs received a total of $15 million from Thiel, falsely claimed that the FBI had <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/jd-vance-falsely-claims-fbi-illegally-wiretapped-trump-ohio-rally-2022-4" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">illegally wiretapped Trump's phone</a>.

(Most but not all of Thiel's donations occurred in early 2021, before the launch of Vance's campaign and the many false claims he made over the course of the race.)</p><figure data-type="img" data-e2e-name="image-figure-image" data-media-container="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject">

            <pubDate>Thu, 19 Oct 2023 10:01:36 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/10/19/north_korea_fake_freelance_avoidance/">https://www.theregister.com/2023/10/19/north_korea_fake_freelance_avoidance/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37940713">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>US and South Korean authorities have updated their guidance on how to avoid hiring North Korean agents seeking work as freelance IT practitioners.</p>
<p>Thousands of North Korean techies are <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/05/17/fbi_korea_freelancers/">thought</a> to prowl the world’s freelance platforms seeking work outside the Republic. Kim Jong Un’s regime uses the workers to earn hard currency, and infiltrate organizations they work for to steal secrets and plant malware. The FBI has previously warned employers to watch for suspicious behavior such as logging in from multiple IP addresses, working odd hours, and inconsistencies in name spellings across different online platforms.</p>
<p>The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/Y2023/PSA231018">updated advice</a> adds other indicators that freelancer you are thinking about hiring could be a North Korean plant, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Repeated requests for prepayment followed by “anger or aggression when the request is denied”;</li>

<li>Threats to release proprietary source codes if additional payments are not made;</li>

<li>Using a freight forwarder’s address as the destination for a company laptop rather than a home address, and changing that address frequently;</li>

<li>Evading in-person meetings or requests for drug tests;</li>

<li>Changing payment methods or accounts on freelance-finder platforms;</li>

<li>Having multiple online profiles for the same identity with different pictures, or online profiles with no picture.</li>
</ul>
<p>The updated guidance suggests requiring recruitment companies to document their background checking processes, to be sure that they can screen out North Korean stooges. Conducting your own due diligence on workers suggested by recruiters is also recommended.</p>
<p>Another piece of advice recommends you should “Keep records, including recordings of video interviews, of all interactions with potential employees.” North Korean freelancers, per previous advice, will be shy of video interviews.</p>

    

<p>The agencies also recommend technological measures including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Preventing use of remote desktop protocol on all company devices and prohibit using remote desktop applications for work;</li>

<li>Locking down all administrative permissions;</li>

<li>Installing insider threat monitoring software on company devices;</li>

<li>Regularly geo-locating company laptops to verify they match the logins of employees' addresses;</li>

<li>Requiring freelancers to shut off commercial VPNs when accessing company networks;</li>

<li>Adopting zero-trust and need-to-know policies;</li>

<li>Avoid granting access to proprietary information, if possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>Plenty of that is solid advice for any IT shop under any circumstances.</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/10/05/north_korea_phishing_attack_on_south/">South Korea accuses North of Phish and Ships attack</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/10/04/lazarus_group_lightlesscan_malware_upgrade/">North Korea's Lazarus Group upgrades its main malware</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/05/09/upwork_chatgpt_problem/">When you try to hire a freelancer to write SQL and all you get is incorrect AI garbage</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/03/08/plutus_payroll_guilty_verdict/">Aussie tech worker payroll scheme operators found guilty of tax fraud</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The advice was published a day after the US Justice department <a target="_blank" href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-court-authorized-action-disrupt-illicit-revenue-generation">announced</a> the seizure of 17 website domains used by North Korean information technology workers in a scheme to defraud US and foreign businesses, evade sanctions, and fund the development of the North’s weapons program.</p>
<p>US authorities have previously seized $1.5 million of revenue generated by those sites.</p>

        


        

<p>North Korea has “flooded the global marketplace with ill-intentioned information technology workers,” said Special Agent in Charge Jay Greenberg of the FBI St. Louis Division.</p>
<p>“This scheme is so prevalent that companies must be vigilant to verify whom they're hiring. At a minimum, the FBI recommends that employers take additional proactive steps with remote IT workers to make it harder for bad actors to hide their identities. Without due diligence, companies risk losing money or being compromised by insider threats they unknowingly invited inside their systems.”</p>
<h3>Check Chinese professors, too</h3>
<p>The updated advice was issued the day after the nations of the Five Eyes alliance – Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the UK and the USA – <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/10/18/five_eyes_china_espionage/">warned</a> at a summit that China’s industrial espionage efforts have again increased.</p>
<p>As part of the Five Eyes announcement, Mike Burgess, director-general of security at the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, revealed that the agency recently detected and disrupted a Chinese operation involving a visiting professor who came to work at an unnamed Australian research institution but was first recruited by Chinese intelligence.</p>

        

<p>“The spymasters gave him money and a shopping list of intelligence requirements and sent him to Australia,” Burgess <a target="_blank" href="https://www.asio.gov.au/media-statement-emerging-technology-and-securing-innovation-summit">revealed</a>.</p>
<p>“The academic set his Australian students research assignments that specifically covered many of the intelligence requirements," he recounted.</p>
<p>“ASIO intervened and removed the professor from the country before any harm could be done,” Burgess said, adding “This sort of thing happens every day in Australia, just as it happens in all our countries.” ®</p>

<p dir="auto"><strong>Is the code as good as GitHub Copilot?</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">For simple line completions yes. For simple function completions, mostly. For complex functions... maybe.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Is it as fast as GitHub Copilot?</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">On my Macbook Pro with an Apple M2 Max, the 7b models are roughly as fast. The 34b models are not. Please consider this repo a demonstration of a very inefficient implementation. I'm sure we can make it faster; please do submit a pull request if you'd like to help. For example, I think we need debouncer because sometimes llama.cpp/GGML isn't fast at interrupting itself when a newer request comes in.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Can this be packaged as a simple Mac app?</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Yes!, I'm sure it can be, I just haven't had the time. Please do submit a pull request if you're into that sort of thing!</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Should there be a meta-model that routes to a 1b for autocomplete, 7b for more complex autocomplete, and a 34b for program completion?</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Hmm, that seems like an interesting idea.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>OK, but in summary, is it good?</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Only if your network is bad. I don't think it's competitive if you have fast Internet. But it sure is awesome on airplanes and while tethering!</p>

<p>I’m a full-time instructor in Python and Pandas, teaching in-person courses at companies around the world (e.g., Apple and Cisco) and with a growing host of online products, including <a href="https://store.lerner.co.il/">video courses</a> and a <a href="https://bambooweekly.com/">paid newsletter with weekly Pandas exercises</a>. Like many online entrepreneurs, I’ve experimented with a host of different products over the years, some free and some paid. And like many other online entrepreneurs, I’ve had some hit products and some real duds. </p>

<p>A number of years ago, I decided to advertise some of my products on Facebook. I ran a bunch of ads, none of which were particularly successful, mostly because I didn’t put a lot of effort into them. I decided to try other things, and basically forgot about my advertising account.</p>



<p>It was only a year or so ago that I thought that maybe, just maybe, I should do some advertising on Facebook (now Meta). I went to my advertising page, and was a bit surprised to see that my account had been suspended for violating Meta’s advertising rules. I decided that this was weird, but didn’t think about it too much more, and went on to do other, more productive things.</p>



<p>Just a few months ago, I again visited my ad management page, and again saw the notice that I was not allowed to advertise because I had violated their rules. This time, for whatever reason, I decided that I was going to look into this further. I didn’t see any indication of what rules I had broken, and I knew for a fact that I hadn’t done anything other than advertise courses in Python and Pandas. I didn’t quite know what to do, but there was a button marked, “Click here to appeal.” So I clicked it, assuming that someone at Meta would reach out to me, saying, “Whoops!”</p>



<p>Nope: About 30 minutes later, I got e-mail from Meta saying that they had reviewed my case, I had definitely violated their policy, and now I was <em><strong>banned for life</strong></em> from ever advertising on a Meta platform. Here’s the e-mail that I got:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://lerner.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/CleanShot-2023-10-19-at-09.15.27@2x.png" alt="" width="620" height="445" srcset="https://lerner.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/CleanShot-2023-10-19-at-09.15.27@2x.png 1134w, https://lerner.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/CleanShot-2023-10-19-at-09.15.27@2x-300x215.png 300w, https://lerner.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/CleanShot-2023-10-19-at-09.15.27@2x-1024x735.png 1024w, https://lerner.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/CleanShot-2023-10-19-at-09.15.27@2x-768x551.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px"></figure>



<p>Going to my advertising management page indeed brought up a similar message:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://lerner.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/CleanShot-2023-10-19-at-09.18.48@2x-1024x615.png" alt="" width="652" height="392" srcset="https://lerner.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/CleanShot-2023-10-19-at-09.18.48@2x-1024x615.png 1024w, https://lerner.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/CleanShot-2023-10-19-at-09.18.48@2x-300x180.png 300w, https://lerner.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/CleanShot-2023-10-19-at-09.18.48@2x-768x461.png 768w, https://lerner.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/CleanShot-2023-10-19-at-09.18.48@2x.png 1292w" sizes="(max-width: 652px) 100vw, 652px"></figure>



<p>And of course, when I click on the “Business support home,” I get a truly scary message:</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://lerner.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/CleanShot-2023-10-19-at-09.19.26@2x-1024x808.png" alt="" width="729" height="576" srcset="https://lerner.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/CleanShot-2023-10-19-at-09.19.26@2x-1024x808.png 1024w, https://lerner.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/CleanShot-2023-10-19-at-09.19.26@2x-300x237.png 300w, https://lerner.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/CleanShot-2023-10-19-at-09.19.26@2x-768x606.png 768w, https://lerner.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/CleanShot-2023-10-19-at-09.19.26@2x.png 1520w" sizes="(max-width: 729px) 100vw, 729px"></figure>



<p>All of this seemed utterly bizarre to me. What could I possibly have said or done that would get me permanently restricted? And is there any way that I can get out of this situation?</p>



<p>I decided to turn to my network on (where else?) Facebook, to see if anyone had any ideas. I also turned to LinkedIn, in case someone there might have some insights.</p>



<p>The good news? I got an answer right away from a friend on LinkedIn. He told me that he also had problems advertising his Python training courses on Meta platforms because — get this —&nbsp;Meta thought that he was dealing in live animals, which is forbidden.</p>



<p>That’s right: I teach courses in Python and Pandas. Never mind that the first is a programming language and the second is a library for data analysis in Python. Meta’s AI system noticed that I was talking about Python and Pandas, assumed that I was talking about the animals (not the technology), and banned me. The appeal that I asked for wasn’t reviewed by a human, but was reviewed by another bot, which (not surprisingly) made a similar assessment.</p>



<p>As I said, that was the good news. So, what’s the bad news?</p>



<p>I’ve been in the computer industry for a while, and have no small number of contacts. Three friends who have worked at Meta (two current, one past) offered to check into this for me.</p>



<p>The first friend looked into it, and found that there was nothing to be done. That’s because Meta has a data-retention policy of only 180 days, and because my account was suspended more than one year before I asked people to look into it, all of the evidence is now gone. Which means that there’s no way to reinstate my advertising account.</p>



<p>Now, I’m not a big believer in “there’s nothing to be done,” especially when it comes to companies and software, both of which are created and managed by people. But this friend seemed convinced, so I moved onto a second one. He didn’t get any further. And the third friend? He didn’t seem to make any headway, either.</p>



<p>The bottom line seems to be that Meta’s AI made a mistake, a big one. (You can be sure that I’ll be using this example when I teach courses on machine learning.) The fact that both the original judgment and the appeal were handed by AI is pretty ridiculous.</p>



<p>But even more absurd is the fact that because I didn’t react to their ban within a certain amount of time, there now seems to be no way for me to undo it. Which means that when I start to advertise my courses again —&nbsp;and I’m actually planning to do so in the near future —&nbsp;Meta won’t be seeing any of my money, whereas companies like Google, who seem to employ at least <em>some</em> humans in their advertising department —&nbsp;will.</p>

<p>Google has been caught hosting a malicious ad so convincing that there’s a decent chance it has managed to trick some of the more security-savvy users who encountered it.</p>
<figure><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/malicious-keepass-ad-google.png" data-height="551" data-width="740" alt="Screenshot of the malicious ad hosted on Google."><img alt="Screenshot of the malicious ad hosted on Google." src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/malicious-keepass-ad-google-640x477.png" width="640" height="477" srcset="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/malicious-keepass-ad-google.png 2x"></a><figcaption><p><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/malicious-keepass-ad-google.png" data-height="551" data-width="740">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> Screenshot of the malicious ad hosted on Google.</p><p>Malwarebytes</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>Looking at the ad, which masquerades as a pitch for the open-source password manager Keepass, there’s no way to know that it’s fake. It’s on Google, after all, which claims to vet the ads it carries. Making the ruse all the more convincing, clicking on it leads to ķeepass[.]info, which when viewed in an address bar appears to be the <a href="https://keepass.info/">genuine Keepass site</a>.</p>
<figure><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/fake-keepass-website.png" data-height="585" data-width="953" alt="Screenshot showing keepass.info in the URL and Keepass logo."><img alt="Screenshot showing keepass.info in the URL and Keepass logo." src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/fake-keepass-website-640x393.png" width="640" height="393" srcset="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/fake-keepass-website.png 2x"></a><figcaption><p><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/fake-keepass-website.png" data-height="585" data-width="953">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> Screenshot showing keepass.info in the URL and Keepass logo.</p><p>Malwarebytes</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>A closer link at the link, however, shows that the site is <em>not</em> the genuine one. In fact, ķeepass[.]info —at least when it appears in the address bar—is just an encoded way of denoting xn--eepass-vbb[.]info, which it turns out, is pushing a malware family tracked as FakeBat. Combining the ad on Google with a website with an almost identical URL creates a near perfect storm of deception. </p>
<p>“Users are first deceived via the Google ad that looks entirely legitimate and then again via a lookalike domain,” Jérôme Segura, head of threat intelligence at security provider Malwarebytes, wrote in a <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/threat-intelligence/2023/10/clever-malvertising-attack-uses-punycode-to-look-like-legitimate-website">post Wednesday</a> that revealed the scam. </p>                                            
                                                        
<p>Information available through Google’s Ad Transparency Center shows that the ads have been running since Saturday and last appeared on Wednesday. The ads were paid for by an outfit called Digital Eagle, which the transparency page says is an advertiser whose identity has been verified by Google.</p>
<figure><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/keepass-digitaleagle.png" data-height="734" data-width="908" alt="Screenshot of Google Ad Transparency page displaying information for Digital Eagle, Inc."><img alt="Screenshot of Google Ad Transparency page displaying information for Digital Eagle, Inc." src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/keepass-digitaleagle-640x517.png" width="640" height="517" srcset="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/keepass-digitaleagle.png 2x"></a><figcaption><p><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/keepass-digitaleagle.png" data-height="734" data-width="908">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> Screenshot of Google Ad Transparency page displaying information for Digital Eagle, Inc.</p><p>Malwarebytes</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google representatives didn’t immediately respond to an email, which was sent after hours. In the past, the company has said it promptly removes fraudulent ads as soon as possible after they’re reported.</p>
<p>The sleight of hand that allowed the imposter site xn--eepass-vbb[.]info to appear as ķeepass[.]info is an encoding scheme known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punycode">punycode</a>. It allows unicode characters to be represented in standard ASCII text. Looking carefully, it’s easy to spot the small comma-like figure immediately below the k. When it appears in an address bar, the figure is equally easy to miss, especially when the URL is backed by a valid TLS certificate, as is the case here.</p>
<p>The use of punycode-enhanced malware scams has a long history. Two years ago, scammers used Google ads to drive people to a site that looked <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/07/with-help-from-google-impersonated-brave-com-website-pushes-malware/">almost identical</a> to brave.com, but was, in fact, another malicious website pushing a fake, malicious version of the browser. The punycode technique first came to widespread attention in 2017, when a Web application developer created a proof-of-concept site that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/04/chrome-firefox-and-opera-users-beware-this-isnt-the-apple-com-you-want/">masqueraded as apple.com</a>.
</p><p>There’s no sure-fire way to detect either malicious Google ads or punycode encoded URLs. Posting ķeepass[.]info into all five major browsers leads to the imposter site. When in doubt, people can open a new browser tab and manually type the URL, but that’s not always feasible when they’re long. Another option is to inspect the TLS certificate to make sure it belongs to the site displayed in the address bar.</p>

              <p>Bandcamp’s entire union bargaining team, the eight union members democratically elected by their peers to negotiate their first union contract, were laid off when Epic Games sold Bandcamp to music licensing company Songtradr on Monday.&nbsp;</p><p>Songtradr told 404 Media that it did not have any union membership information when it made its decision on which employees it would keep as part of the sale, but the union told me Songtradr invited them to a meeting with Songtradr’s CEO last week. 404 Media has viewed the invitation, which shows Bandcamp’s bargaining team were invited and that Songtradr’s CEO Paul Wiltshire planned to attend.</p><p>“Songtradr had no access to union membership information and we executed our employment offer process with full-consideration of all legal requirements,” Jalila Singerff, director of communications at Songtradr, told 404 Media in an email. “We carried out a comprehensive, full company evaluation that involved a detailed examination of each role. This evaluation considered several factors such as product groups, job functions, employee tenure, performance evaluations, the importance of roles for smooth business operations, and whether a similar function already existed at Songtradr including our experience of running it and associated requirements.”</p><p>Songtradr didn’t immediately respond to my question about inviting the union bargaining team to a meeting last week.&nbsp;</p><p>Epic Games, a fantastically wealthy company that owns the Unreal Engine, Epic Games Store, and in recent years has seen incredible profits thanks to the huge popularity of <em>Fortnite</em>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/02/arts/music/epic-games-bandcamp.html?ref=404media.co#:~:text=The%20world%20of%20independent%20music,online%20video%20games%20like%20Fortnite.">acquired Bandcamp</a> in 2022. At the time, <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/bandcamp-joining-epic-games-to-support-fair-open-platforms-for-artists-and-fans?ref=404media.co">Epic said</a> that Bandcamp would “play an important role in Epic’s vision to build out a creator marketplace ecosystem for content, technology, games, art, music and more.” The union, Bandcamp United, won recognition in May 2023 through an election administered by the NLRB.</p><p>In September, a little more than a year after Epic acquired Bandcamp, Songtradr <a href="https://www.songtradr.com/blog/posts/songtradr-bandcamp-acquisition?ref=404media.co">announced</a>&nbsp; that it will acquire Bandcamp as Epic cut around 830 jobs across the company. Epic and Songtradr agreed to an “asset sale” of Bandcamp, meaning Songtradr is only buying parts of Bandcamp as opposed to the entire company. As part of this process, Epic has laid off about half of Bandcamp’s staff, the other half of the staff have accepted job offers to work on Bandcamp at Songtradr.</p><p>“On Monday, October 16, 2023 over half of Bandcamp was laid off as a result of Epic Games’ divestiture to Songtradr,” Bandcamp United said in a statement. “Of those laid off, 40 were in the union bargaining unit out of a total 67 members. None of the eight (8) democratically elected bargaining team members received a job offer.”</p><p>Bandcamp United said that the layoffs cut Bandcamp’s editorial team in half, with 12 out of 13 union-eligible support staff “made redundant.”&nbsp;</p><p>“Not all Bandcamp employees will receive offers from Songtradr,” Songtradr <a href="https://twitter.com/songtradr/status/1709986126117630051?s=20&amp;ref=404media.co">said</a> on October 5. “Bandcamp requires some adjustments to ensure a sustainable and healthy company that can serve its community of artists and fans long into the future.”</p><p>“It feels as though many of the aspects that make Bandcamp human—that make it a balm in an algorithm- and profit-driven music industry—have been gutted through these layoffs,” Atoosa Moinzadeh, a laid off member of Bandcamp’s editorial team, said in a statement.</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-how-it-works" dir="auto"><a href="#how-it-works">How it Works</a></h2>
<p dir="auto">LocalSend uses a secure communication protocol that allows devices to communicate with each other using a REST API. All data is sent securely over HTTPS, and the TLS/SSL certificate is generated on the fly on each device, ensuring maximum security.</p>
<p dir="auto">For more information on the LocalSend Protocol, see the <a href="https://github.com/localsend/protocol">documentation</a>.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-getting-started" dir="auto"><a href="#getting-started">Getting Started</a></h2>
<p dir="auto">To start LocalSend from source code, follow these steps:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Install <a href="https://flutter.dev/" rel="nofollow">Flutter</a></li>
<li>Clone the LocalSend repository</li>
<li>Run <code>flutter pub get</code> to download dependencies</li>
<li>Run <code>dart run build_runner build -d</code> to generate code</li>
<li>Run <code>flutter run</code> to start the app</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">It may be the case that it doesn't work because of a mismatch between the required Flutter version and the installed Flutter version.</p>
<p dir="auto">LocalSend uses <a href="https://fvm.app/" rel="nofollow">fvm</a> to manage the project Flutter version (specified in <a href="https://github.com/localsend/localsend/blob/main/.fvm/fvm_config.json">.fvm/fvm_config.json</a>). After you installed it, run <code>fvm flutter</code> instead of <code>flutter</code>.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>An Internal Revenue Service pilot might just eventually bring US citizens a free direct-file alternative to commercial options like TurboTax and H&amp;R Block. Yesterday, <a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-advances-innovative-direct-file-project-for-2024-tax-season-free-irs-run-pilot-option-projected-to-be-available-for-eligible-taxpayers-in-13-states">the agency announced</a> that 13 states are joining its pilot program for the 2024 filing season, four of which will also be able to integrate their state taxes into the pilot.</p><p>Since 2001, a partnership between companies like TurboTax maker Intuit and the IRS called the <a href="https://www.irs.gov/e-file-providers/about-the-free-file-alliance">Free File Alliance</a> has given consumers a free alternative to paying for tax preparation. However, it turned out that when you try to get companies to offer an alternative to giving you money, they will <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/turbotax-deliberately-hides-its-free-file-page-from-search-engines">do their best to hide that option</a>. When the IRS <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/1/21045779/irs-turbotax-free-file-h-r-block-tax-preparation-new-rules">updated the agreement</a> to forbid companies from doing that — and give itself permission to create its own free file option — both <a href="https://news.bloombergtax.com/daily-tax-report/irss-free-file-partners-moving-forward-without-h-r-block">H&amp;R Block</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/17/22581587/turbotax-parent-company-intuit-opts-out-irs-free-file-program">Intuit</a> left.</p><p>According to the IRS, these are the states joining the pilot:</p><div><ul><li><strong>States with state income tax: </strong>Arizona, California, Massachusetts, and New York</li><li><strong>States without state income tax: </strong>Alaska, Florida, New Hampshire, Nevada, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, and Wyoming</li></ul></div><p>The pilot doesn’t guarantee a nationwide rollout of the program. Danny Werfel, who heads the IRS, says this will test the government’s capacity to do this, adding that the Internal Revenue Service will work closely with participating states to gather the information it needs to see if the program works. </p><p>The IRS says its scope could change, but the pilot is starting small. Only some people can participate, depending on their income, tax credits, and deductions. For instance, if you’re filing a W-2 and have basic deductions like student loan interest or the standard deduction — the default one that everyone gets unless they need to deduct more — you can directly file. If you’re an independent contractor, though, it sounds like you may be stuck with your usual options.</p><p>Intuit seems to be worried. Shortly after this story was published, Rick Heineman, the company’s communications VP, emailed <em>The Verge</em> with an aggressive statement calling the IRS’s pilot “redundant” and “half-baked.” </p><p>“The Direct File scheme is a solution in search of a problem,” he wrote, adding that it could end up “costing billions of dollars in taxpayer money.”</p><p>Intuit, which profits from tax prep software, has lobbied against programs like this pilot <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/3/26/4150900/intuit-lobbies-against-returns-free-tax-filing-system">for over a decade</a>. It’s insisted, then as now, that taxpayers already have free alternatives, but not everyone sees it that way. </p><div><p>In 2022, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/29/23002219/ftc-turbo-tax-irs-free-tax-prep-software-intuit-misleading">Federal Trade Commission sued Intuit</a>, alleging false advertising around its “Free Edition” software, which the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/8/23864538/turbotax-intuit-ftc-deceptive-practices-free-tax-filing">FTC’s chief administration law judge ruled</a> was not truly free. As <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/turbotax-just-tricked-you-into-paying-to-file-your-taxes"><em>ProPublica</em> noted in a 2019 report</a>, TurboTax customers are often told after entering their taxes that their tax situation doesn’t meet the free software’s criteria, and they must either pay for preparation or move on. Last year, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/4/23057463/intuit-141-million-agreement-new-york-attorney-general-turbotax-free">New York Attorney General Letitia James announced</a> that Intuit had agreed to pay out $141 million to customers in that state for similar reasons.</p></div><p>The IRS pilot, of course, also comes with limits. The agency says a “limited, controlled environment” is the “best way to test a new service offering” so that it can adjust the program before scaling it up later.</p><p><em><strong>Update October 18th, 2023, 2:07PM ET: </strong>Added a statement from Intuit, along with further context on TurboTax.</em></p></div></div>]]></description>

Last week, retail sales <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/17/retail-sales-september-2023-.html">came in far higher than expected</a>, creating more uncertainty over the Federal Reserve's long-term plan.</p><p>These higher rates have caused <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/18/mortgage-demand-falls-to-the-lowest-level-since-1995-as-interest-rates-near-8percent.html">mortgage demand to plummet</a>, as applications fell nearly 7% last week from the previous week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.</p><p>"Here's another milestone that seemed extreme several short months ago," said Matthew Graham, chief operating officer of Mortgage News Daily. "The fact is that many borrowers have already seen rates over 8%.&nbsp;That said, many borrowers are still seeing rates in the 7s due to buydowns and discount points."</p><p>The homebuilders are using buydowns to help customers afford their homes.

<p>Since e-books first emerged as a way for readers to consume content digitally, publishers and authors have required content aggregators to apply Digital Rights Management (DRM) technology to the e-books <img src="https://www.libraryjournal.com/binaries/content/gallery/Jlibrary/lj-sponsored-images/ebsco-logo-with-com.jpg/ebsco-logo-with-com.jpg/Jlibrary%3Atwofifty">they sell to libraries to prevent the unauthorized use, copying, and redistribution of these materials. While this practice has given publishers and authors peace of mind that sales won’t be lost to piracy or other unauthorized sharing, it has placed undue restrictions on readers who rely on institutional access to e-books.</p>

<p>For instance, DRM typically limits how much an e-book reader can print and how long they can check it out from the library. These limitations can make it difficult for students and academics to use e-books in their research. Some users might require more time with a particular resource, and yet this title might disappear from their device before they’ve had a chance to complete their work.</p>

<p>Even worse, DRM often limits the accessibility of materials for readers with disabilities. Downloaded content that is DRM-protected can only be opened with software that is compatible with the technology, such as Adobe DRM. This means that users can only read downloaded e-books in programs that support Adobe DRM, such as Adobe Digital Editions or Bluefire Reader.</p>

<p>When users have accessibility needs and use specific software to read e-books, these DRM-related limitations can have a big impact: forcing a user who reads with an assistive technology to use Adobe Digital Editions might mean they can’t read that book at all, if their screen reader or text-to-speech software isn’t compatible with Adobe Digital Editions. (Reading the title online is still possible, but for many users, this might not be a convenient option—and so they rely on the ability to download content.)</p>

<p>Although piracy is a serious issue for publishers, content aggregators have been arguing for years that offering DRM-free access to institutions would not add to the problem. “The malicious users aren’t logging into their library’s website to find DRM-free titles to pirate,” says Jon Elwell, director of content strategies for EBSCO. “They are just cracking the DRM.” Unfortunately, software that strips an e-book of its DRM protections is readily available online.</p>

<p>With this fact in mind, content aggregators have been working to convince publishers to let them sell DRM-free content to libraries—and these efforts are paying off. For example, EBSCO has been offering DRM-free content to libraries for more than a year, and the company now has more than 140,000 DRM-free titles available.</p>

<h3>Benefits of DRM-Free Content</h3>

<p>Why is this trend significant? With DRM-free e-books, library patrons have a much richer user experience. They are free to interact with the content just as they would with printed materials, yet with all of the benefits that a digital format enables—such as greater portability and accessibility.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.libraryjournal.com/binaries/content/gallery/Jlibrary/lj-sponsored-images/amanda-jones-1186891-unsplash.jpg/amanda-jones-1186891-unsplash.jpg/Jlibrary%3Athreehundred">“A DRM-free title is a digital book in its purest form,” Elwell observes. “If you want to chunk some sections up to share with a group you are working with, you can do it. If you want to download it so you can reference it later, you can do it. If you want to take notes and mark it up like a print book and have those notes to reference for the rest of your academic career, you can do it. You can even copy and paste sections to save yourself time. It allows the content to truly function as a digital title and to take advantage of everything that means.”</p>

<p>Not only does this remove barriers to research and scholarship, but DRM-free access also makes it easier for colleges and universities to offer e-books or e-book chapters for use by an entire class. “This marries well with course adoption,” Elwell notes.</p>

<p>A review of the usage data on DRM-free e-books suggests that users appreciate the flexibility this model provides. “We studied all of the content in the past year that was purchased and available in both 1-user and DRM-Free unlimited user models, and we found that DRM-Free content was getting significantly more use than the exact same titles in 1-user models,” Elwell says.</p>

<p>This increased usage benefits both libraries and publishers. “Usage is currency,” he explains. “If we know that we can enhance the value of an asset by ensuring that it’s used more frequently, that’s a good thing.”</p>

<h3>Key Considerations</h3>

<p>DRM-free content is relatively new at this scale, and publishers are still trying to figure out a pricing model that is sustainable for them. In turn, librarians are struggling to navigate this new landscape and come up with a purchasing model that makes the most sense for their institution.</p>

<p>While pricing for unlimited-user, DRM-free e-books is higher than the cost of traditional 1-user versions protected by DRM technology, DRM-free materials are also seeing more usage—and so the cost per use is ultimately lower. Even with all of the benefits afforded by DRM-free content, librarians might have to make tough choices about which titles to purchase in which formats.</p>

<p>Library purchasing agents should think carefully about what types of content they want to acquire DRM-free, based on how they expect readers will want to interact with these materials, Elwell advises. For example, a review of EBSCO data reveals that education and law are two subjects in particular where students prefer to download copies that remain on their devices, so they can continue to refer to these resources. If librarians are aware of this trend, they might consider buying DRM-free titles in these subject areas.</p>

<p>“Librarians can serve their patrons most effectively by investing strategically in DRM-free content and watching usage trends closely to make well-informed buying decisions,” Elwell concludes.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>To ensure digital sovereignty and democratise access to LLMs, SiloGen and TurkuNLP research group at the University of Turku launch a consortium with a key focus to develop the world’s largest open source language model, covering all official European languages.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition to compute access totaling approximately 15 million GPU hours, the initiative is dedicated to ensure that data utilized in these models accurately represent European languages, also covering the English-speaking world. The initiative is conducted in close collaboration with key European institutions and agencies, and is committed to adhering to European regulations. Beyond Europe, the open source initiative will democratise access to LLMs and enable the development of use-case specific downstream applications.</p>

<p>The consortium, led by SiloGen and the TurkuNLP research group at the University of Turku, stands apart from many other initiatives in that it uniquely combines resources to build LLMs:</p>

<ul><li>World-class LLM team, including professors and leading scholars like <strong>Filip Ginter</strong>, <strong>Jussi Karlgren</strong>, <strong>Sampo Pyysalo</strong>, <strong>Magnus Sahlgren</strong>, <strong>Aarne Talman</strong> among others, as well as others involved out of Silo AI’s more than 150 PhDs and 300 AI experts,&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Data resources covering all European languages and code, including <a href="https://hplt-project.org/">High-Performance Language Technology (HPLT) data</a>, and other collected and curated data, and&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Access to compute, including software infrastructure to train LLMs and access to the<a href="https://www.lumi-supercomputer.eu/"> LUMI supercomputer </a>and other hardware and cloud services for LLM training.</li>
</ul><p>In addition to a world-class team, the consortium has access to, and experience with, the LUMI supercomputer, which as one of the European High-Performance Computing (EuroHPC) undertakings is the third largest supercomputer in the world and the largest in Europe. Having built LLMs on LUMI for more than a year, the team has developed a distinctive software layer for training LLMs effectively and efficiently on the AMD-based hardware. As part of the EU-funded HPLT project, the data for this initiative has been collected and curated since early 2022 to provide a representative basis for LLM development. Combining all of this with a total of 15 million GPU hours, Silo AI and TurkuNLP are uniquely positioned to train a family of language models, including the world's largest open LLM.</p>

<p><img alt="Sampo Pyysalo lähikuvassa." data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="2d0ab279-5ba5-494c-9bc6-3d56fa27050d" src="https://www.utu.fi/sites/default/files/inline-images/Sampo.Pyysalo-248.jpg" width="1000" height="740" loading="lazy"></p>

<p><em>University Research Fellow in data analysis Sampo Pyysalo is the principal investigator of the High Performance Language Technologies consortium at Turku.</em></p>

<p>“LLMs are rapidly reshaping how we access information and interact with technology. As their impact grows, it is increasingly important to assure that the models are developed in a transparent and reproducible manner and made openly available to ensure accountability and equal access to the technology. From a European perspective, it is also critical that models are designed from the outset to prioritize multilinguality and an equitable approach to all languages. The High Performance Language Technologies (HPLT) project is addressing these goals through the creation of open European data resources and language models and delighted to partner in this consortium with SiloGen and Silo AI, an industry leader with shared goals", says Sampo Pyysalo, University of Turku Research Fellow and HPLT principal investigator..</p>

<p><img alt="Peter Sarlin lähikuvassa." data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="0b39d04b-d7b0-40b5-8661-43ca59ded0e5" src="https://www.utu.fi/sites/default/files/inline-images/Peter%20Sarlin%2C%20CEO%20and%20Founder%20of%20Silo%20AI.jpg" width="1000" height="701" loading="lazy"></p>

<p><em>Peter Sarlin is the CEO and co-founder of Silo AI.</em></p>

<p>“We are honored to contribute to the development of open LLMs. The development of base models aligned with European values is imperative for our digital sovereignty. This initiative helps to ensure that underlying models are based on data and information representing the citizens and organisations of the region, and overall compliance with regulation, data privacy and other vital concerns. And eventually we need sovereignty on how downstream applications and value creation happen. This requires trusted and secure approaches to independent base models that enable fine-tuning for domain-specific needs. This way we can ensure digital sovereignty, while advancing technological development,” says <strong>Peter Sarlin</strong>, CEO and co-founder of Silo AI.</p>

<p>The TurkuNLP research group’s extensive experience in NLP and LLMs aligns with Silo AI’s and SiloGen’s commitment to contribute to world-class research on generative AI. The alignment, combined with the resources of the consortium, provides a robust foundation for redefining the boundaries of what is possible in the world of open source language models. Together with the LLM development platform, this opens a unique path for companies to create value using independent, trusted and secure base models with a possibility to finetune, instruct and control LLMs for domain-specific needs.</p>

<p><strong>TurkuNLP research group</strong><br><em>The TurkuNLP group of the University of Turku was founded in 2001 and has been carrying out research in natural language processing for over 20 years with a focus on machine learning applications to the automatic analysis and generation of text. TurkuNLP is the leading Finnish research group in large generative language models and one of the partners in the Horizon EU High Performance Language Technologies project, which is currently creating the next generation of European language models on the LUMI supercomputer.</em></p>

<p><strong>Silo AI&nbsp;</strong><br><em>Silo AI is one of Europe’s largest private AI labs – a trusted AI partner that brings competitive advantage to product R&amp;D. We build AI-driven solutions and products to enable smart devices, autonomous vehicles, industry 4.0, and smart cities. Silo AI provides its customers a unique access to world-class AI expertise, covering a team of more than 300 AI experts and more than 150 PhDs, as well as the Silo OS infrastructure to speed up AI development and deployment. Established in 2017, Silo AI is on a mission to build a European flagship AI company, with offices currently in Finland, Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands and Canada.</em></p>

<p><strong>SiloGen</strong><br><em>SiloGen is a large-scale initiative with the aim of building generative AI technology for Europe’s digital sovereignty. It is gathering some of Europe’s leading generative AI and Large Language Model (LLM) experts, as well as access to data sources, powerful computational resources and infrastructure to train, run and operate LLMs. SiloGen has been operational since late 2022 and is currently working on its technology at full speed with clients like Allianz, Sandvik and Tietoevry. Its core focus is to improve downstream and domain-specific applications and to ensure companies can utilize trustworthy models for private, confidential and proprietary data. As a trusted provider SiloGen offers base and specialized models as well as a development suite to ensure accurate, trustworthy and robust downstream applications</em>.&nbsp;<br>

<p>Apple has recently made bold <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/search/query?q=apple+carbon">claims</a> about respecting the environment across business decisions. ♻️ And it seems to be making strides in many areas, like using recycled materials in products and clean energy in many aspects of its operations. 🎉</p>



<p>That’s why a deviation from this posture at last month’s event stood out: Only iPhone 15 models benefit from a new feature that is designed to protect batteries, <em>despite the feature likely being possible on earlier models.</em> The new feature is: iPhone 15 (and 15 Pro) owners can limit their phones to not charge past 80%.<sup data-fn="05902993-d9c4-4170-8921-1c3224296e38"><a href="#05902993-d9c4-4170-8921-1c3224296e38" id="05902993-d9c4-4170-8921-1c3224296e38-link">1</a></sup> That may not appeal to everyone, but doing so, according to Apple, reduces “the wear on your battery and improve[s] its lifespan by reducing the time your iPhone spends fully charged”. 🌎 👍</p>



<p>Wait, how can we assume that the feature is possible on earlier models? -&gt; Well, iPhones dating back at least to the iPhone 8 era <em>already</em> support a very similar “charge to 80%” option called Optimized Charging.<sup data-fn="a2cf8422-4828-4fcc-98ee-55c9ad78a160"><a href="#a2cf8422-4828-4fcc-98ee-55c9ad78a160" id="a2cf8422-4828-4fcc-98ee-55c9ad78a160-link">2</a></sup> The difference is that Optimized Charging operates by limiting your phone’s charging to 80% when your iPhone is normally idle (typically in the middle of the night).<sup data-fn="90e98f77-acc1-43d2-9c98-599d88558f4e"><a href="#90e98f77-acc1-43d2-9c98-599d88558f4e" id="90e98f77-acc1-43d2-9c98-599d88558f4e-link">3</a></sup> The <em>new</em> 80% charging feature (that’s limited to iPhone 15 models) doesn’t try to be as smart, and simply applies the limit all day long. (I asked Apple to comment on why this feature is not also available in previous models <sup data-fn="59b5a285-2161-414d-8e7e-decbada463eb"><a href="#59b5a285-2161-414d-8e7e-decbada463eb" id="59b5a285-2161-414d-8e7e-decbada463eb-link">4</a></sup> and will update this story if they respond.) Presumably there’s nothing preventing Apple from pushing a software update to enable this in older phones. </p>



<p>If batteries last longer that means less waste and healthier devices for those who want to make this trade off. This feature is driven by customer demand; <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/21/23884725/apple-iphone-15-pro-optimized-charging-80-percent-how-it-works">there was even speculation</a> that it shipped as an “apparent response to the battery <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/230812/p11#a230812p11">longevity complaints</a> that have proliferated around last year’s iPhone 14 models”. Comments across several articles <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/16n2m4t/comment/k1c2ybg/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">and</a> reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ios/comments/16peac9/iphone_15_exclusive_feature/">threads</a> openly wonder why <em>only</em> iPhone 15 models get the feature. (After posting this article, I started listening to one of my favorite podcasts ATP, and John Siracusa also <a href="https://overcast.fm/+R7DVfvsX4/16:12">wondered out loud</a> why this is limited to iPhone 15 as well.) Meanwhile, Samsung phones’ similar Battery Protect feature works for models going back multiple years.<sup data-fn="9ebd1906-d31d-4981-91ed-3eb183c707d5"><a href="#9ebd1906-d31d-4981-91ed-3eb183c707d5" id="9ebd1906-d31d-4981-91ed-3eb183c707d5-link">5</a></sup></p>



<p>It’s one thing when feature-gating is for <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2021/07/13/iphone-ios-15-missing-features-old-phones/7948107002/">animated backgrounds in the Weather app</a> or features that are hardware constrained, but when it’s for something that can clearly reduce waste globally and protect customers’ devices, they should make an exception.</p>

<p>So for Earth’s-sake, please take the easy win and enable this for more phones, Apple.</p>







<p>There is very lively discussion on Reddit, where it’s trending at #1 both on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ios/comments/17b7ua8/the_new_ios_option_to_charge_battery_to_up_to_an/">r/ios</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/17b8gu6/the_new_ios_option_to_charge_battery_to_up_to_an/">r/apple</a>. There are a bunch of worthy suggestions there on how to improve the feature even more, but one thing’s clear: iPhone users would love to see this come to more devices.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Cambridge, MA 10/17/2023 –</p><p>Zero ASIC, a semiconductor startup, came out of stealth today to announce early access to its one-of-a-kind <strong>ChipMaker</strong> platform, demonstrating a number of world firsts:</p><ul><li>3D chiplet composability enabling billions of new silicon products</li><li>Fully automated no-code chiplet-based chip design</li><li>Zero install interactive RTL-based chip emulation</li><li>Roadmap to 100X reduction in chip development costs</li></ul><p><em>“Custom Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) offer 10-100X cost and energy advantage over commercial off the shelf (COTS) devices, but the enormous development cost makes ASICs non-viable for most applications,”</em> said Andreas Olofsson, CEO and founder of Zero ASIC. <em>“To build the next wave of world changing silicon devices, we need to reduce the barrier to ASICs by orders of magnitude. Our mission at Zero ASIC is to make ordering an ASIC as easy as ordering catalog parts from an electronics distributor.”</em></p><h2>ChipMaker Platform</h2><p>Traditional chip design costs over $100M and takes expert teams 2-3 years to go from concept to production. Chiplet-based design offers a compelling solution to both the time and cost problem of custom ASICs by hiding all the complexities of circuit design inside a reusable validated chiplet. Zero ASIC has gone one step further by creating a platform that enables automated design, validation, and assembly of System-in-Packages from a catalog of known good chiplets. The company’s ChipMaker web based tools allows users to test out their custom designs quickly and accurately before ordering physical devices, using cloud FPGAs to implement the RTL source code of each chiplet in a custom SoC.</p><h2>eFabric Active Interposer</h2><p>Existing 2D/2.5D chiplet design approaches are fundamentally limited in shoreline bandwidth, wiring distances, and flexibility. To address these problems, Zero ASIC has developed eFabric, an active grid-like 3D interposer that improves die-to-die communication efficiency and composability. The eFabric supports integration of ultra-critical processing blocks using 3D attached eBrick chiplets and integration of off-package IO functions using 2D attached UCIe based ioBrick chiplets. The eFabric architecture enables unprecedented chiplet-based performance levels and flexibility:</p><ul><li>Billions of unique System-In-Package assembly options</li><li>512 Gb/s/mm on-fabric bisection bandwidth</li><li>128 Gb/s/mm chiplet 2D bandwidth</li><li>128 Gb/s/mm2 chiplet 3D bandwidth</li><li>&lt;0.1 pJ/bit 3D interconnect energy efficiency</li></ul><h2>eBrick 3D Chiplets</h2><p>To enable plug-and-play chiplet composability, Zero ASIC has created a complete set of electrical and mechanical 3D chiplet standards specifications. The effectiveness of these standards have been demonstrated through the design of a number of interoperable 2 mm x 2 mm chiplets called eBricks:</p><ul><li>Quad-core RISC-V Linux capable dual-issue processor</li><li>5 K LUT embedded FPGA</li><li>3 MB SRAM -3 TOPS machine learning accelerator</li></ul><h2>Target Markets and Availability</h2><p>Zero ASIC’s composable chiplet ASICs are ideally suited for a diverse set of energy and supply chain challenged applications including robotics, automotive safety, aerospace and defense, 5G/6G communication, test and measurement, software defined radio, smart manufacturing, medical diagnostics,  and high performance computing. The ChipMaker design and emulation platform can be accessed immediately at zeroasic.com. Zero ASIC will be showing live demonstrations of the ChipMaker platform at the Open Compute Platform Summit (Open Chiplet Economy Center) October 17-19, in San Jose, CA. Customized ASICs sampling in Q3 2024.</p><h2>About Zero ASIC</h2><p>Zero ASIC is a semiconductor company building an automated chiplet-based design and manufacturing platform offering orders of magnitude reduction in the time, cost, and risk of developing unique customer-driven ASICs for high performance systems. Zero ASIC is headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

You may not have heard of it because they run these systems in-house vs using a commercial service.<p>My company switched to 100% remote dev envs a couple years ago. When you cut a branch it spins up a VM and you can connect to it from VS Code (native or browser based) or just plain SSH. It works great. The lag is not noticeable at all. Dev envs are fully provisioned and up to date with all tooling and dependencies so you don't need to bother with managing any of it locally. Given a choice I don't think any dev at my company would go back.

And giving developers data and secrets was often either insecure or complicated, depending on the codebase.</p><p>With codespaces, people can just jump straight into a working project, without pulling any client code or secrets or data onto their machine. It still requires maintenance sometimes but at least when I fix the codespace config I know everyone will definitely benefit from the changes.</p><p>The main downside is it's pretty expensive (if you have, say, 10 devs using it all day every day) compared to "free".</p><p>If you work on just a few projects, and/or you have very sophisticated systems across the board (like every site has an on-rails setup script with useful sanitized dev data, and secure SSO'd secrets management), I doubt it's worth it.</p><p>But in our case, a relatively junior dev being able to spin up a working dev version of a site they've never worked on in 5 minutes with no issues, so they can knock out a 3 hour change and maybe never work on it again, is a big money saver.</p><p>It's also meant that we can more easily standardize everyone's laptops without having to consider how well they work as bare metal dev machines (which has meant we can move everyone to fairly cheap macbook airs without people moaning about their tooling or storage size etc.)</p><p>I also like that access to a lot of stuff becomes directly mediated moment to moment by someone's github access (which for us also runs through our sso, cloudflare zt etc).</p><p>We're doing it in a slightly clunky way though - we use docker compose still, inside the codespace. I like this approach personally bc it feels like we're less locked in to the platform. For us it also made the initial migration easier. I think it also makes debugging the environment a bit easier because you don't need to keep rebuilding constantly on changes, you can just dcb dcup...

I'm slowly adding devcontainers to the open source projects I work on. It's much nicer to have a docker compose file and several docker files in this setup than maintaining instructions on setting up test environments.<p>I've run k8s/k3s with docker-in-docker this way too. Really easy once you get it setup, and great for playing with architecture ideas.

Except maybe VSCode remote using SSH. I repeatedly find anything that requires a network call somewhere in between a serious impediment disrupting the flow of development. Sometimes I find myself in slow laggy situations with ssh to the point I prefer Mobile Shell mosh. VSCode remote (or similar) via ssh obviously becomes painful.<p>Most cloud environments are also limited in terms of what you can do. e.g: issue sudo while running a process, attach to a process with a debugger.</p><p>Usually when these come development environment ready, it also hides away underlying details - i.e, I no longer know the command line etc to should I need to write infrastructure code/automation later on.</p><p>I guess there are domains where these are non-issues. But for a wide variety of my use-cases local development is going to be preferable, because by design there are limitations in the alternative.

Plus it would be questionable whether one could realize the scaling benefit of the cloud because those machines are more pets than cattle, killing them over night and bringing up a clean system the next day would likely upset dozens of different workflows and tweaked setups.

They did the cost calculations, buying hardware is cheaper in the long run, including ops.</p><p>And then there are customers that have extremely stringent security demands. Segregated networks, video surveillance, no data must leave the premises. Convincing them to move the data into the cloud might not be impossible but it would be a big recertification ordeal for one cloud vendor. And then we'd be locked into that vendor until we could get something else. And we have several such customers.

At every company I've ever worked for, "cloud development" is nothing but a Linux VM that gets provisioned for you in AWS, a file watcher that syncs your local files to the VM, and some extra CLI tools to run builds and tests on the VM. And every time I've used this, the overhead of verifying the syncing is up to date, the environment is consistent between my laptop and VM is the same, all this other mess...every time I end up just abandoning "cloud dev" and doing things on my laptop. God forbid you change a file in your cloud VM and forget to sync in the reverse direction. Not only is local development more reliable, but it's also faster (no remote network hop in the critical path of building things).

I have a handful of servers in my basement that I use vscode+remote-ssh to work with. The benefit is that I can jump from my desktop to my laptop without any fuss. I can leave long-running scripts online for like an experimental batch job and attach to that from any machine, even when I am not home thanks to wireguard/tailscale. It is very nice knowing my dev env is always there in the state I last left it. This also gives the nice benefit of being able to choose your developer env (windows or mac) while running your dev/code/system on a linux system for example. It also gets you around architecture issues, like if your laptop is arm-based and your app needs x86.<p>I was initially kinda opposed to this and preferred "bare metal development" on my local rig. But the performance is actually pretty incredible for remote development with vscode such that I don't really notice things are running on different hardware.</p><p>We recently had some new members join the team and I decided to spin up some dedicated EC2 instances for them to use for this exact purpose. They aren't being used yet, but as our stack becomes more sophisticated I think workloads will transition there. It's done with a custom terraform module that also provisions other assets needed for each dev (regardless of local or remote dev) like an S3 bucket, some dynamo tables, IAM roles, etc. Being able to onboard a new dev with a handful of lines added to a mapping is pretty awesome.</p><p>tl;dr I would absolutely consider remote dev spaces.

I have a very lightweight laptop that I use</p><p>- Some of our developers like having multiple separate codespaces at a time as a way to separate out different projects. I just use branches, but some folks like the codespace workflow.</p><p>- I can run vulnerability scans over our dev environment which is nice</p><p>- When I onboard devs, I can get them to the point of running our full application suite in a 15 minute meeting</p><p>- I don't have to deal with m1 vs not-m1 issues that were popping up all the time before we made the switch</p><p>- Having a linux base is nice, as that's what we use in production. We deal with some annoying dependencies and not having to install them on Mac anymore is nice</p><p>- It's seamless changing between my laptop and desktop that I work from. All the code is instantly on the other when I switch, even if I haven't pushed up to git</p><p>- Chrome + Notion + Slack + our task tracker app + etc. take up a lot of memory now adays. Even with 32gb machines, folks often would run out of memory trying to run our app. On a codespace, all of the memory is dedicated to just the app.</p><p>- With prebuilds, when a developer opens a codespace, we already have all of our python, node, go, etc. dependencies preinstalled (also things like awscli, terraform, pre-commit, VsCode extensions, docker). They just run `aws sso login` and then `start --serve` and things work.</p><p>- I live in an RV, and sometimes don't have great internet, but my Codespace is on a remote machine that does always have fast internet. Even being an internet-based service, this works great for me.</p><p>The biggest cons:</p><p>- Some of our devs were really passionate that they preferred other IDEs than VsCode. Some other IDEs do now have support, but they aren't as supported as VsCode yet</p><p>- Codespaces have downtime occasionally (as did Cider at Google). Most folks just use a local copy/devcontainer of the app or do other things when this happens, but some folks choose to always use devcontainers/local copies because this annoys them so much. At Google, we just posted memes when this happened and went home.</p><p>- Codespaces become inactive after a controllable amount of time has passed. Some folks don't like the 40 seconds to reactivate a codespace after being inactive for more than 30 minutes, so they either write scripts to keep their codespaces alive or just don't use codespaces at all.</p><p>Overall:</p><p>- most of our newer employees exclusively use codespaces.</p><p>- A few of our older employees who developed locally for years have chosen to continue developing locally, and will just hop into a codespace to run a quick terraform command or something if their local version gives errors.</p><p>- The number of questions we deal with regarding issues on a single users' machine have gone down dramatically, and tbh most of the questions come from folks who use the local still</p><p>- We do pay a pretty penny for this, but it's a small fraction of our overall cloud spend or costs per employee

We use DevPod to work in cloud dev environments in our AWS cloud. I hate it. DevPod brings its own SSH implementation that injects itself into your server and munges CRLF, making ssh sessions to your workspace fraught with difficulty except for basic command line applications. The only terminal that seems to work is the one built in to Visual Studio Code. Maybe Microsoft Windows Terminal also works, I dunno.<p>If you have editor attachments and want to work this way, suck it up and learn your VS Code. That's what all the tooling supports first class. Second class is JetBrains. Vim and Emacs aren't even considered. I'd say just run them from inside the container, but then you run into things like custom SSH that munges CRLF. When you look at who actually authored the devcontainer standard, it makes sense.

He explains it in detail in his book </span><a href="https://amzn.to/3S2Zhjg" rel="">The PARA Method (Affiliate link)</a><span>; but the key takeaway is </span><strong>intentionality</strong><span>.</span></p><p>You should always ask yourself what purpose something will serve, and save it accordingly.</p><p>If you don’t start being more intentional when selecting the things you save, making sure they will contribute to your current or future projects and areas, no system will prevent you from the digital hoarding.</p><p>These systems are of incredible use. But they need to be paired up with a habit of curation. Without a regular checkup of the things you save, your digital vault will keep growing and growing becoming yet again, overwhelming.</p><p>So after learning to be selective, you need to learn to let go.</p><p>You should regularly check your library of contents to, again, make sure that you’re only keeping what’s serving you.</p><p>Your brain will still be subject to FOMO (Fear of missing out), so you’ll need to counter act regularly, and archive what’s not needed.</p><p>We could fall into the easy argument that social media is a virus to our society and how everything that’s wrong with the world stems from it and how it has made us slaves to external validation and dopamine junkies.</p><p>However, social media can be, and is, used for good.</p><p>You’re just doing it wrong.</p><p>Instead of allowing the algorithm to recommend indiscriminately. Customize it.</p><p><span>Indicating what you are interested in through liking and sharing is important. But the single most effective thing you can do to ensure the value of your feeds, is to start </span><strong>blocking</strong><span> the content you don’t align with.</span></p><p>Don’t just scroll past it. Block it.</p><p>It’s an extra effort for sure, but the result will be well worth it.</p><p>Now, if you’re convinced of the power of the second brain, there are basically infinite options to build your system. But here are a few tools for you to consider:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Apple Notes (or any simple note-taking app)</strong><span>. This would be the simplest approach of all. Your system doesn’t need to be fancy or use complicated tech. Here you have a dedicated tutorial by Tiago himself, explaining how to use the PARA Framework with Apple Notes. This is replicable to any note-taking app.</span></p></li></ol><div id="youtube2-fioLhb1U4J0" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;fioLhb1U4J0&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fioLhb1U4J0?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></p></div><ol><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.notion.so/product" rel="">Notion</a></strong><span>.

So proceed with caution.</p><p>But this is my current choice and it’s great for me as it integrates both my curation system and my creation system. So I can seamlessly navigate my full Creative Flywheel workflow from a single app.</p><p>YouTube's Thomas Frank offers a very detailed Notion Masterclass for you to build your second brain from scratch.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Well, I finally have a story to tell. I finally launched the new version of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://sizzy.co/">Sizzy</a>. It went from a simple web app to a full-fledged browser for designers and developers. I would say that it's been a very exciting month, but actually, it's been a bumpy ride for 2.5 years. I made a lot of mistakes and I learned a lot of lessons, so I wanted to share the entire story with you.  </p>&nbsp;<h2>Solve your own problem, everything else will&nbsp;follow</h2><p>As everything that I have ever worked on, I was trying to solve my own problem. I was working as a freelancer at the time and previewing a website on multiple devices was a <em>major</em> pain in the ass for me. The client wanted the app to work perfectly on every device, in every orientation. So after every change in my app, I had to switch 20 device variations in Chrome and it was driving me crazy. I'm obsessed with automating things. I'd spend hours to automate a task that takes 3 seconds just so I don't have to repeat the steps ever again. Meanwhile, my sister was swapping the batteries between two remotes 10 times per day for almost a year without buying a second pair of batteries and she was absolutely fine. I guess everyone is different.</p>&nbsp;<p>You can actually read the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://medium.com/@kitze/introducing-sizzy-a-tool-for-developing-responsive-websites-crazy-fast-39a8c0061992">original article</a> that I published when I launched the app.</p>&nbsp;<p>Back to the story. After only a day of work, I already saved myself a lot of time while working for clients in the future. I published the app and I open-sourced it on GitHub so everyone can use it and contribute. People <em>loved</em> it. The project received <em>5k</em> stars. The analytics were going crazy. I couldn't believe what was going on.</p>&nbsp;<div aria-owns="rmiz-modal-" data-rmiz=""><p><img alt="1_4VX9xRv1-9tCc2ETdZOVhQ.jpg" src="https://media.graphcms.com/8EB6ktlTjaRaGvyT9NYQ"></p></div>&nbsp;<h2>Hopefully, people will donate,&nbsp;right?</h2><p>I started an Open Collective for it but it made 93$ in 2.5 years. After I tweeted about this, a couple of people said: "well maybe people aren't using it". I knew that they were just trying to bring me down, but the analytics were saying something else. 7 to 10 thousand people were using the app every month. The donation link was visible everywhere, so it wasn't possible to miss it.  </p>&nbsp;<p>Here's the catch: when you give away something completely for free, people aren't that motivated to pay for it. It's just how humans think, there's nothing new here. When was the last time you chose a value above 1$ on a "pay what you want" slider for an app? Exactly. (ok, one person who's reading the article, you're special and you're a saint for choosing 2.5$ that one time when you were drunk)</p>&nbsp;<h2>I made a huge&nbsp;mistake</h2><p>It didn't take long for me to realize that launching Sizzy as a web app was a big mistake. There were tons of limitations that prevented me from realizing the app's full potential. I had too many ideas but it wasn't possible to realize all of them in a web app. I wanted to make a real browser. So I dived into Electron. Shortly after getting the first 0.0.0.0.0.1 (not really semver) Electron version working, I published an article so other people don't have to go through what I went to make React and Electron work together. I was making progress.  </p>&nbsp;<p>I obviously wanted to make a paid version of the app because the donations weren't exactly working out for me. But I had no idea what approach to take.</p>&nbsp;<ul role="list" depth="0"><li index="0"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" viewBox="0 0 24 24" focusable="false" role="presentation" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path fill="none" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"></path><path d="M9 16.17L4.83 12l-1.42 1.41L9 19 21 7l-1.41-1.41z"></path></svg>Closing an open-source project just to make it paid seemed like a dick move.</li><li index="1"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" viewBox="0 0 24 24" focusable="false" role="presentation" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path fill="none" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"></path><path d="M9 16.17L4.83 12l-1.42 1.41L9 19 21 7l-1.41-1.41z"></path></svg>Having an open-source version and a paid version seemed very complicated to pull off.</li></ul><p>I had a call with a friend to ask him about his journey with his startup and he was very helpful, but when a goal seems too far away and we can't envision a clear path to reach it, we always reach for the same old drawer:</p>&nbsp;<div aria-owns="rmiz-modal-" data-rmiz=""><p><img alt="1_1SGZoVh-5VoC8qFbK2H7vQ.png" src="https://media.graphcms.com/Adyc7lzvQb6OPGs3ZNg3"></p></div>&nbsp;<p>I was born in Macedonia, and I was living in the Netherlands at the time, and both of those countries didn't have access to Stripe. I contacted Stripe and they told me that the Netherlands will have access soon (and it actually launched a few months later), but I was already clinging so hard to the excuse that I don't have a way to charge for this app. </p>&nbsp;<p>I mean, every cool developer is using Stripe, right? They have a cool flashy website and a dashboard that everyone loves. I WANT TO SEE MY $$$ IN A PRETTY AND COLORFUL DASHBOARD WITH ROUNDED CORNERS AND NEAT SHADOWS GODDAMMIT. Screw the fact that there are literally 108351 other payment providers that I can use. No. Payments are hard. This is impossible. Also, I have to figure out a way to auto-update this app? How do I even do that? Where am I going to store all the installers? What if it costs a lot of money? How am I going to handle all of that mess? What about licenses, registrations, emails, newsletters, etc. etc. etc… You know what, I better forget about this "problem" and completely ignore it for 2 years.  </p>&nbsp;<h2>Shifting focus</h2><p>Shortly after the initial launch I stopped freelancing, I launched <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://reactacademy.io/">React Academy</a> and I was too busy doing workshops, so I didn't have the need to use Sizzy at all. I completely neglected the app and stopped caring about issues etc. The usage wall still high though, and the usage was even going up. The app was useful to people, even in its most basic form. I got a couple of offers from companies which wanted to buy it from me, but I didn't want to sell it. I knew that one day I'll be in the right mindset and go back to it.</p>&nbsp;<h2>If it doesn't work for me, I don't want to sell&nbsp;it</h2><p>Last summer I tried using the app again and my first reaction was "omfg why do people even use this thing, it can be so much better". But people didn't see it that way. When you tune your brain to this problem-solving mindset you start seeing problems in everything. When I was using the app, I didn't like it because I had this other potential version of the app in my head. So I decided that I want to work on it again. I decided to launch it when it's gonna look like something that I would use every day. That was the goal.</p>&nbsp;<h2>A second&nbsp;chance</h2><p>I was so busy doing workshops and conferences that I barely had the time to concentrate and work on any other project. I was traveling every week and I grabbed this one from the excuses drawer:</p>&nbsp;<p>"Unless I'm in one place for a very long time I just can't push myself to focus and do proper work" - Kitze</p><p>But I didn't want to let that stop me, so I hired <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://praneet.dev/">Praneet</a> to work on the app a couple of hours per day. He helped me bring Sizzy back in shape from a technical standpoint. We updated a lot of old dependencies, cleaned up some code, switched a couple of libraries, etc.  </p>&nbsp;<p>The problem was, I had no idea how to move the project forward. There were so many things left to do that I didn't know where to start. The payment integration wasn't even started and there was no landing page. I started working on the landing page while he was working on fixing bugs and adding new features. Most of the new features didn't end in the current version because I wasn't thinking everything through. We were going one step forward and two steps back. I wouldn't say that it was completely lost time, but I wish I was better at prioritizing and estimating things. Unfortunately, I wasn't. I didn't set any time limits and weekly goals. We were just coding.  </p>&nbsp;<p>The other problem is I cannot focus on a goal for too long. I started working on the landing page, but ended up working on a React library for making landing pages 🤦 (maybe I'll release it one sunny day)</p>&nbsp;<p>I wanted to solve that problem too, but I ended up with two half-ass solutions. There were so many things left to do, the launch seemed too far away, and I just burned out and lost interest again. Praneet decided that he doesn't want to join me full time and we parted ways.</p>&nbsp;<h2>The final&nbsp;chance</h2><p>I went back to my trips, conferences, and workshops. I started filming vlogs. I had a lot of fun, and I was using travel as an excuse that I don't have time to work on my apps.</p>&nbsp;<p>Somewhere at the beginning of 2019, we started discussing with Praneet for his full-time employment again. After a lot of back and forth, we agreed on a contract for 1 year, and we went back to working on the app. Paying someone every month out of my own pocket before being profitable was a big motivational boost for me to get my shit together. I honestly think that if I tried to finish everything alone, the app wouldn't see the light of day.</p>&nbsp;<p>The conference and workshop season was almost done for me, so I finally had a lot of time at home and I finally went back to my zone. Honestly, travel and all the hippie nomad shit might look fun to you, but trust me there's nothing better than working from the same old place and being focused for a long time. When you see people post pictures of working by the pool just think that they cannot see shit from all the glare, and there is a group of kids playing Marco Polo that's driving them bananas. It's all part of that fake Instagram life.  </p>&nbsp;<p>Anyway, I decided to finally sit down and ship this thing.</p>&nbsp;<p>The landing page could've been done in a day if I used any of the drag and drop tools for building landing pages, but noooo, that wasn't good enough for the perfectionist in me. I had to do everything from scratch. Everything had to be optimized, animated, and thought out down to the last detail. I'm a believer in #YOLO #JUSTSHIPIT development but the right landing page can basically sell the app for you. I proved that with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://twizzle.app/">Twizzle</a> and I wrote about <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiehackers.com%2Fforum%2Fjust-ship-it-is-not-always-the-right-mindset-b71eda7696">Just ship it is not always the right mindset</a>. With zero marketing people were sharing and buying the app just because of the unique landing page filled with easter eggs.</p>&nbsp;<p>The landing page for Sizzy was done, and it was time to move on.</p>&nbsp;<h2>Oh boy, the payment&nbsp;part</h2><p>Even though Stripe was available in Poland, where I'm currently based, I still chose Paddle as a payment provider only because it automatically handles VAT for EU customers. I could've totally used Paddle back in the Netherlands but my hand was kinda stuck in the excuses drawer.  </p>&nbsp;<p>Because the app was in Electron, I couldn't use Paddle's SDK for licensing an app. "Add few lines of code" turned to "few weeks of figuring everything out manually". I had to write literally everything around the payment logic from scratch. From the backend to a separate app for managing licenses and subscriptions, and all the Electron code for activating, deactivating, and validating licenses. When you look only at the functionality of an app, you might think "hah I can write this myself in a few weeks", but actually packing it in something that can be distributed to users involves a lot of work. Don't get me started on the updates and release server.  </p>&nbsp;<p>I learned a lot during the process but I don't want anyone else to do this manually. I already have some plans about releasing the entire infrastructure as a service, so people can easily sell their Electron apps with Paddle. It will take me only 3 years to release it.  </p>&nbsp;<h2>Deleting the GitHub repository</h2><p>Honestly, it felt kind of shitty to delete the repository and unpin the project from my profile. I hated the feeling but I had to shrug it off. I had to convince myself that I'm not doing anything wrong. The app was serving a lot of people for 2.5 years, and I rarely got any contributions. It was time to get real and think about what matters.</p>&nbsp;<p>Oh, here we go… I'm gonna mention the M word and lose a ton of readers at this point.</p>&nbsp;<p><strong>Money</strong>.  </p>&nbsp;<p><strong>Money matters.</strong></p>&nbsp;<p>Most developers, hell, most people are in the mindset that money is something evil and that it doesn't matter. It's a taboo subject. Go ahead and complain to your friends that you're not making enough or cannot pay your bills this month. They will love the conversation and everyone will tell their own story. Now go ahead and tell your friends that you made a lot of money this month. You could cut the tension in the air with a knife. People don't want to hear that shit. Money doesn't matter. Go away with that conversation. I'm making enough. I can barely save anything, but I don't want to think about that right now. At least I'm learning. One day things will magically change, I know that. That guy is making money because his grandpa is rich. That girl is making money because she's lucky. Let's not discuss that and go back to complaining, please.    </p>&nbsp;<p>There are so many amazing developers creating amazing tools and they're not thinking about making them profitable, even for a second. A friend once called me "greedy" because I left a company for a better salary. What the actual fuck. That's a very high school mindset to have, and I'm doing my best to spread this message to every developer out there…</p>&nbsp;<p>Open source, writing blog posts, and playing with tweaking lint settings and editor themes all day are completely fine until your landlord knocks on your door or you're at the checkout at the grocery store. You're doing a crazy 2-hour commute every day telling yourself "well at least I'm learning a lot about SVG". Fuck that. We don't know how long things will stay this way. No one can guarantee that we'll have our jobs and we'll be in the most profitable and spoiled industry in the next 10 years.  </p>&nbsp;<div aria-owns="rmiz-modal-" data-rmiz=""><p><img alt="1_GfLq_6uV7t09oQx6998s1w.jpg" src="https://media.graphcms.com/NUE86TVRQ0i4NUvsvMK7"></p></div>&nbsp;<p>A factory lector - a person who was reading the newspaper to factory workers</p><p>The factory lector thought his job was secure until one day the factory owner walked in and replaced him with a radio. But the factory lector didn't have Medium and Hacker News to tell him every single day that the radio is coming to take his job. However, developers are constantly reading that AI and ML are taking a huge momentum and everything is becoming more and more automated. We completely ignore that fact and want to believe that we'll keep our highly paid job of moving rectangles with CSS forever. (People who know how to fix printers are an exception, you'll keep your job forever)  </p>&nbsp;<p>I learned a long time ago not to obsess with stars and likes. I still love open source and I'm still <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://github.com/kitze">open-sourcing</a> a lot of things, but not everything has to be open source. Please don't get defensive and don't get me wrong. If it wasn't for open source we wouldn't be able to ship anything, ever. There are a lot of amazing people in the community, there are people who do open source for living, there are highly funded open source projects like Babel, Webpack, etc.</p>&nbsp;<p>However, <strong>most</strong> developers make <strong>zero</strong> money off open source. <strong>Zero</strong>.</p>&nbsp;<p>I have a lot of friends (and by friends I mean people who replied to my tweet twice) who built an amazing app or a service, they didn't make it paid for a bunch of reasons, and now they're buried in a sea of issues, basically solving other people's problems for free. No matter how cruel this sounds, it's the sad reality. I really hope that with GitHub Sponsors things will change, but it won't be anywhere near launching a paid SaaS product, because donations are <strong>optional</strong>.  </p>&nbsp;<p>My philosophy is that if I'm investing a lot of time and money in making a tool that's gonna save users and companies across the world tons of time, I might as well charge for it.</p>&nbsp;<p>I'm expanding on this point more details in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ6aC6G0ufg">this talk</a>, so if you're interested you can watch it.</p>&nbsp;<p>Jesus, what was this article even about… Oh yeah, Sizzy.  </p>&nbsp;<p>It was time to launch. I did all the calculations and I was hoping that at least a small percentage of my existing users will convert to paid ones.  </p>&nbsp;<p>It was time.  </p>&nbsp;<p>The 0.0.1 version of the app was ready for download.  </p>&nbsp;<p>Everything was tested properly.  </p>&nbsp;<p>I made a professional video demonstrating all the features of the app.  </p>&nbsp;<p>The Twitter post was ready.  </p>&nbsp;<p>The Product Hunt post was ready.  </p>&nbsp;<p>It was time to press the button, but it was so hard.  </p>&nbsp;<p>I was so afraid that all of my existing users are gonna grab pitchforks and wait in front of my home because the tool is not free anymore.  </p>&nbsp;<p>But oh boy… I was totally not prepared for what happened next.</p>&nbsp;<h2>The big launch</h2><p><strong>Holy fucking monkey balls flying through space! I totally didn't expect that response!</strong></p>&nbsp;<p>Sizzy got 2352 upvotes on Product Hunt. It was the product of the day, the product of the week, and third product of the month. It got more votes than Libra by Facebook and Raspberry Pi 4, isn't that bananas?! (or raspberries, whatever)</p>&nbsp;<p>I decided to use a giveaway on Twitter to motivate people to retweet, and it worked! After the giveaway was done I couldn't find a proper tool for picking winners so I made <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://luckyretweet.co/">Lucky Retweet</a>. Try doing a giveaway for one of your products and you might be surprised by how well it works. Instead of only 3, I gave away 30-lifetime licenses. Although your few buddies will groan and won't RT, and all the winners will be super happy and grateful. It's overall a very positive experience.</p>&nbsp;<p>The initial feedback was amazing. When I started getting my first subscribers I just couldn't believe it. It's been 1.5 months since the launch and I still get the same feeling when I get a new subscriber.  </p>&nbsp;<h2>Haters are always&nbsp;louder</h2><p>I believe that paying a few dollars per month for something that's going to save you and your team hundreds of hours per month is a no-brainer. In retrospect, I should've priced it way higher. It was selling like crazy. If you look at the list of teams who are using Sizzy on the landing page you will find Samsung, Bentley, Comcast, Toyota, Sketch, Hallmark, Basecamp, Algolia, etc.</p>&nbsp;<p>What in the world is going on?  </p>&nbsp;<p>People who can recognize that a tool will actually save them, and even make them money, just buy it immediately and move on with their life.  </p>&nbsp;<p>However, people who are obviously experts at pricing SaaS products are way, way louder. If you only look at the comments from the outside, without knowing the actual stats, you might get a totally wrong impression that the product isn't doing well.  </p>&nbsp;<p>The most common complaints were:</p>&nbsp;<ul role="list" depth="0"><li index="0"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" viewBox="0 0 24 24" focusable="false" role="presentation" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path fill="none" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"></path><path d="M9 16.17L4.83 12l-1.42 1.41L9 19 21 7l-1.41-1.41z"></path></svg>I want to pay only once!!!111!11!</li><li index="1"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" viewBox="0 0 24 24" focusable="false" role="presentation" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path fill="none" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"></path><path d="M9 16.17L4.83 12l-1.42 1.41L9 19 21 7l-1.41-1.41z"></path></svg>This shouldn't be a subscription</li><li index="2"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" viewBox="0 0 24 24" focusable="false" role="presentation" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path fill="none" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"></path><path d="M9 16.17L4.83 12l-1.42 1.41L9 19 21 7l-1.41-1.41z"></path></svg>HEY, THIS SHOULD BE FREE!!111!1</li><li index="3"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" viewBox="0 0 24 24" focusable="false" role="presentation" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path fill="none" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"></path><path d="M9 16.17L4.83 12l-1.42 1.41L9 19 21 7l-1.41-1.41z"></path></svg>I'm gonna make my own version and distribute it for free because screw these greedy companies that are charging users for something like this (actual comment, W T F )</li><li index="4"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" viewBox="0 0 24 24" focusable="false" role="presentation" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path fill="none" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"></path><path d="M9 16.17L4.83 12l-1.42 1.41L9 19 21 7l-1.41-1.41z"></path></svg>Well, isn't this the same as Google Chrome?</li><li index="5"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" viewBox="0 0 24 24" focusable="false" role="presentation" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path fill="none" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"></path><path d="M9 16.17L4.83 12l-1.42 1.41L9 19 21 7l-1.41-1.41z"></path></svg>Well, isn't this the same as that one Chrome extension that came out in 2007? I can just use that.</li></ul><p>Cool, who's stopping you from not using it, or using something else?  </p>&nbsp;<p>Just imagine if you enter a clothing store and be like "OMFG THIS SHIRT IS 20$? ARE YOU CRAZY? I CAN GO TO THE STORE NEXT DOOR AND GET ONE FOR 7$. I CAN GET A SKIRT, CUT IT, AND WEAR IT AS A T-SHIRT. OR EVEN BETTER, I'M GONNA SEW MY OWN SHIRT!!!111!"</p>&nbsp;<p>Or imagine entering a supermarket and starting to yell at the cashier "WHAT?! THIS MILK IS 3$? DO YOU KNOW THAT ON THE OTHER END OF TOWN I CAN GET THIS FOR 2.5$? I CAN EVEN BUY MY OWN COW, RAISE IT, MILK IT EVERY DAY, AND DRINK MILK FOR FREE!11!".  </p>&nbsp;<p>In both scenarios, you would probably be seen as a crazy person and escorted out by security. But sadly, on the internet, people forget that they're talking to real people. It's simple, if you don't agree about the pricing of a product, don't buy it and move on. Then go and spend the same amount of money on a large latte, and spend 25 hours per week manually doing something that a dedicated tool could've done for you. That will show 'em!</p>&nbsp;<h2>Focus on the customers</h2><p>Thankfully, I learned to ignore negative comments and I didn't waste too much time on pointless internet discussions.</p>&nbsp;<p>Instead of wasting my energy on convincing people to buy the app, I decided to focus on customers who actually bought it, and make sure that they will get the best value out of it. Ever since launching the app we've been working non-stop on improving it and we have released 5 new versions with a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://sizzy.co/changelog">lot of new features</a>. I opened a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://sizzy.co/roadmap">public Trello Board </a> where people can see the roadmap and vote on features they would like to see in the app.  </p>&nbsp;<p>The emails were piling up and there were way too many of them for me to handle alone. I tried a couple of tools but nothing was working out. I realized that I cannot do everything by myself. My girlfriend, who was already doing QA for the project, offered to work extra hours and help with the email and all the other administrative tasks. After a week I decided to hire her part-time and properly compensate for her time. This might sound super weird to some, and honestly, it's a bit hard to separate the work from our personal life, but somehow we make it work. She is super hyped about the project and went all-in on making all sorts of merch.  </p>&nbsp;<div aria-owns="rmiz-modal-" data-rmiz=""><p><img alt="1_dh2uev75_ymFqOlh4kmepA.png" src="https://media.graphcms.com/KifIp6TPTNCoTeq9dZBZ"></p></div>&nbsp;<p>I wanted to make sure that every customer issue and a complaint is addressed as soon as possible, and she was crucial in the process. After fixing an issue that a customer reported, we personally send them an email to let them know that in the new update their issue is fixed. Everyone loves this level of customer support. We're aware that it's not gonna work at a bigger scale, but we'll do our best to keep it that way.  </p>&nbsp;<h2>Next steps</h2><p>Currently, Sizzy has around 1600 users, which is crazy because the only marketing I've done so far is sponsoring one newsletter, and that was last week. Most of the marketing is just a word of mouth from people who enjoy the product. I want to improve the stability of the app even more before I start properly investing in marketing. It's still far away from my final goal. I have so many ideas about shaping Sizzy to be a tool that every developer and designer will rely on during their daily work. I want to reach a million users. It may sound crazy, but I know I'll get there. The only thing standing between me and that goal is just&nbsp;… me. But I won't let myself lose track again. Sizzy is my primary focus now, and everything else comes secondary. It's really hard to sleep properly when you know you have a lot of customers who depend on you. It's a weird feeling, but I love it!</p>&nbsp;<p>I have no idea what's gonna happen next. I got reached out directly by 5 big investment companies. I'm still not sure whether I should take the VC route because I have a feeling that I'll have a boss again, and I was always struggling to work when someone else was in control. I'll try to push as much as I can without getting an investment because owning 100% of a startup and growing it without depending on anyone is just an amazing feeling.</p>&nbsp;<p>Startup?! Did I say startup? I hate the word, seriously. It completely lost meaning because people create a hello world project and immediately change their Twitter bio to "CEO &amp; Founder of X".

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.whisper.aero/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Whisper Aero</a> emerged from stealth <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/12/whisper-aero-emerges-from-stealth-to-quiet-drones-and-air-taxis/">a little over two years ago</a> with a straightforward (if ambitious) plan: to radically reduce noise emissions from next-gen aircraft with a never-been-done-before electric thruster.</p>
<p>But according to Whisper COO Ian Villa, from the very beginning, the company was thinking more expansively. The startup was founded by Villa and CEO Mark Moore, both former executives at Uber’s aerial ridesharing project Elevate. Early on, the two founders had a hunch that the electric propulsor could be scaled down for products outside the aviation industry.</p>
<p>Like, say, lawn care.</p>
<p>“If we showed you our seed round deck, we had a leaf blower in it,” Villa said in a recent interview. “We’ve always known leaf blowers would be on the path. The real question was when.”</p>
<p>The answer to that question is “now.” Today, Whisper has unveiled “Whisper Drive,” a scaled-down electric ducted fan that can be integrated into leaf blowers, commercial drones or other consumer products. The company says that a Whisper Drive-enabled leaf blower can be up to 40x quieter at 50 feet than its competitors, effectively turning a neighborhood nuisance into a barely perceptible hush.</p>
<p>The result is a leaf blower that emits just 45 decibels of noise at 50 feet and full throttle. In comparison, gas leaf blowers emit between 70-90 decibels of sound at the same condition, while the quietest electric leaf blowers on the market emit around 57-59 decibels.</p>


<p>Whisper engineers started playing around with the concept for a quiet leaf blower after the company had already developed and flown an early-generation 10-pound thruster for a demonstrator drone. Using some 3D-printed parts and spare batteries, they modified the propulsor into a leaf blower MVP.</p>
<p>“We were blown away,” Villa said, likely not intending to make such a good pun. “It was just insane how magically quiet it was. We looked at the numbers and we said, ‘Okay, we know how much thrust this produces.’ […] And it dawned on us, not only was it quiet, but it has to be moving more air than an equivalent handheld leaf blower.”</p>
<p>Whisper set up the very same testing rigs that outdoor power equipment vendors use, so they’ve been able to do direct comparisons between a Whisper Drive-enabled blower and blowers available for purchase. Whisper engineers have also been able to subject the blower to aviation-grade testing, which has allowed them to measure thrust and noise to a highly precise degree, Villa said.</p>
<p>While the company was able to prove tremendous noise reduction with just a prototype, it wasn’t consumer-friendly in terms of costs, so Whisper had to think seriously about how to scale manufacturing up and drive costs down.</p>
<p>“The leaf blower was a way to tackle that in a product-aligned way, where we can perform these experiments, come up with something that we knew the public wanted, but then also solve [the question of] how are we going to make these thrusters cheap enough for commercial drones. To us it was a win-win.”</p>
<p>The biggest way the company’s been able to bring costs down is via an injection molding technique using low-cost materials. The most expensive part of the leaf blower is the battery, and Villa said that Whisper Drive’s improved efficiency will generate longer run times and decreased battery weight.</p>


<p>Leaf blowers may seem relatively low tech — blow air, move leaves — but this is exactly why they’re such a prime product to target, Whisper says. More and more communities have enacted usage restrictions on leaf blowers due to the noise, which is bad news for lawncare workers, especially those that live in hot areas and may not be able to start work during the coolest parts of the day. Depending on use, workers may also be required under federal law to wear hearing protection. Whisper Drive-enabled leaf blowers would make noise restrictions irrelevant and hearing protection unnecessary.</p>
<p>To be clear, Whisper is not building a leaf blower (just the propulsor), but the company is already in talks with a few potential partners to bring the ultra-quiet blower to the market. Villa said the company’s goal is to lock in a partnership toward the end of this year or beginning of next year, so that the blower can be available for purchase by 2025 or sooner.</p>
<p>The new product is part of Whisper’s broader strategy to bring in early revenue and diversify its portfolio — going after high-thrust defense and commercial aviation on one end, to lower-thrust products like leaf blowers or commercial drones on the other.</p>
<p>“We have a significant portion of the team working on high thrust, we also have a significant portion of the team are working on low thrust,” Villa said. “Really, they’re synergistic.”</p>
<p>A quieter, more efficient and affordable electric leaf blower may even be the final nudge in turning the lawncare industry — which has historically relied on gas-powered machinery — greener. While the percentage of the electric lawn equipment market has been rapidly growing, especially amongst individual consumers, it’s still not the majority.</p>
<p>“A lot of landscapers have already gotten on the bandwagon,” Villa said. “When you look at the dollars and look at the economics of it, just like how electric aviation has favorable economics to some alternatives, the same thing is true in the landscaping space. The trouble is, you have these favorable economics, but there’s limitations. To break through those limitations in terms of run time, in terms of performance, in terms of noise, you need enabling technology.”</p>
<p>“This Whisper Drive that we’re able to use in a leaf blower application, is that key enabler.”</p>
