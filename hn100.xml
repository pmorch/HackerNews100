<p><img alt="Firefox" height="900" src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/content/hl-images/2021/10/06/Firefox_headpic.jpg" width="1600"></p>
<p>Mozilla has issued an emergency security update for the Firefox browser to address a critical use-after-free vulnerability that is currently exploited in attacks.</p>
<p>The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2024-9680, and discovered by ESET researcher Damien Schaeffer, is a use-after-free in Animation timelines.</p>
<p>This type of flaw occurs when memory that has been freed is still used by the program, allowing malicious actors to add their own malicious data to the memory region to perform code execution.</p>
<p>Animation timelines, part of Firefox's Web Animations API, are a mechanism that controls and synchronizes animations on web pages.</p>
<p>"An attacker was able to achieve code execution in the content process by exploiting a use-after-free in Animation timelines," <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2024-51/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reads the security bulletin</a>.</p>
<p>"We have had reports of this vulnerability being exploited in the wild."</p>
<p>The vulnerability impacts the latest Firefox (standard release) and the extended support releases (ESR).</p>
<p>Fixes have been made available in the below versions, which users are recommended to upgrade to immediately:</p>
<ul><li>Firefox 131.0.2</li>
<li>Firefox ESR 115.16.1</li>
<li>Firefox ESR 128.3.1</li>
</ul><p>Given the active exploitation status for CVE-2024-9680 and the lack of any information on how people are targeted, upgrading to the latest versions is essential.</p>
<p>To upgrade to the latest version, launch Firefox and go to <strong>Settings -&gt; Help -&gt; About Firefox</strong>, and the update should start automatically. A restart of the program will be required for the changes to apply.</p>

<p>BleepingComputer has contacted both Mozilla and ESET to learn more about the vulnerability, how it's being exploited, and against whom, and we will update this post when we receive more information.</p>
<p>Throughout 2024, so far, Mozilla had to fix zero-day vulnerabilities on Firefox <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/mozilla-fixes-two-firefox-zero-day-bugs-exploited-at-pwn2own/" target="_blank">only once</a>.</p>
<p>On March 22, the internet company released security updates to address CVE-2024-29943 and CVE-2024-29944, both critical-severity issues discovered and demonstrated by Manfred Paul during the Pwn2Own Vancouver 2024 hacking competition.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://roborooter.com/post/wasm-is-the-new-cgi/">https://roborooter.com/post/wasm-is-the-new-cgi/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41795561">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I read a wonderful twitter thead about <a href="https://twitter.com/progrium/status/1337074333018189824">CGI and the birth of the web</a> and this triggered a thought I've been kicking around.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wasm is the new CGI</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And to be clear I don't mean the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Gateway_Interface">Common Gateway Interface</a> as a protocol. I mean what CGI and the <code>cgi-bin</code> application model brought to the web. They allowed people to easily write code that makes websites interactive. This shifted the web from an archive of documents to a vast network of applications. It was the first "web application model". I think Wasm (<a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a>) is setup to bring the next "web application model" to the industry.</p>
<p>Every shift in common web application models that I've observed over the last 20 years has been towards one goal; High performance applications that are easier to build and maintain. I almost titled this essay as "Wasm is the new serverless" but "serverless" is just the current hot iteration of web application models and not the goal.</p>
<p>I'm going to give a history of web application models and then I'm going to talk about what Wasm brings to the table. I'm seeing a convergence of Wasm related technologies maturing that I think will change some of the fundamental constraints of web application development today. When you change the constraints in a system you enable things that were impossible before.</p>
<h2>From CGI to Serverless</h2>
<p>There was a time (and honestly still today) where you could throw a script or any executable in a folder named <code>cgi-bin</code> and visit it at a url. The web server would execute the program on demand and return the output of the program to your web browser. This is roughly how the dynamic web worked for it's first decade. Make a request, run a process to respond to the request. It was slow by today's standards as starting a new process (and in some cases parsing scripts too) is a lot of work.</p>
<p><span><img alt="The official CGI logo from the spec announcement" loading="lazy" width="650" height="600" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://roborooter.com/assets/Common_Gateway_Interface_logo.svg"><figcaption>The official CGI logo from the spec announcement, yes really</figcaption></span></p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FastCGI"><code>FastCGI</code></a> was developed as a response to the performance problems. It was a new web application model where a long lived processes would listen for CGI requests. Your web server would talk to one or more of these processes instead of invoking a new one for every request. It has its own follies as a lot of applications would be naively ported from the previous model and would leak resources like a sieve. They were built to have their processes terminated after each request and now had to stay alive for a long time. This lead to a long period of transition where languages and frameworks adjusted to the new reality.</p>
<p><span><img alt="FastCGI" loading="lazy" width="650" height="600" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://roborooter.com/_next/image/?url=%2Fassets%2Ffastcgi.jpg&amp;w=750&amp;q=75 1x, https://roborooter.com/_next/image/?url=%2Fassets%2Ffastcgi.jpg&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://roborooter.com/_next/image/?url=%2Fassets%2Ffastcgi.jpg&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75"><figcaption>FastCGI</figcaption></span></p><p>During this time language based web servers would emerge as a convention. (Possibly inspired by the Apache Tomcat era of Java application servers.) These applications would be built around a request/response model, and have different web servers available for different execution strategies. They were usually designed to go behind a "battle tested" feature rich web server like Apache or nginx that would isolate the application from slow requests and HTTP details.</p>
<p>The general application models were centered around process management with regards to requests. Some of these servers would fork the process on every request, some would use OS or language based threads, others would use an event or reactor models.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rack_(web_server_interface)">Rack</a> web server interface from the Ruby community eventually made into python via the Flask application server and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Server_Gateway_Interface"><code>WSGI</code></a> specification. To simplify the specification, you receive an HTTP method, a headers hashmap, and a string or stream of input bytes. In response you send a status code, a headers object and a string or stream of response bytes.</p>
<p>With all these approaches you have to manage the number of physical or virtual servers you run. With physical servers application servers would often get slow when traffic was high, or have lots of computers sitting idle when traffic is low. With the rise of cloud computing, <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/what-is-amazon-ec2-auto-scaling.html">autoscaling</a> could allow a number of application servers to be based upon CPU or memory load or even the time of day. This allowed you to adapt to changes in traffic over time, turning on machines when you needed them and off when you didn't. Scaling up new computers can take 2-20 minutes depending on many factors of your application and configuration. Additionally it's dependant on the resources available in your cloud hosting region.</p>
<p>The introduction of "Serverless compute" with <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/welcome.html">Amazon Lambda</a> changed the game. Instead of managing servers you now managed "functions". When paired with <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/services-apigateway.html">API Gateway</a> you now had a web server that would guarantee a single processes, isolated CPU and isolated memory for every request. Processes might be reused for up to a couple of hours but would be suspended or destroyed when not in use. This approach removes the concept of servers from the application management and allows AWS to scale up and down based upon request volume in seconds.</p>
<p><span><img alt="AWS Lambda Logo" loading="lazy" width="650" height="600" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://roborooter.com/assets/lambda.svg"><figcaption>Amazon started the serverless age of compute with Lambda</figcaption></span></p><p>This of course has its tradeoffs. New processes as we know from CGI are expensive, which lead to a "cold start" that some requests observe while scaling up concurrent requests. Each platform has different strategies to mitigate this penalty to varying success. Additionally since processes can be suspended after a response maintaining persistent tcp connections between requests can be troublesome. In practice you can tune database or cache server connections to stay alive (high timeouts on the server, low timeouts on the client) but you need to be more tolerant of reconnecting to external services, or simply reconnect for every request. HTTP based database APIs (see Azure or DynamoDB) are popular in the serverless application model as they tolerate massive numbers of connections and are easier to scale up and down with functions than traditional RDBMs solutions.</p>
<p>Another tradeoff is the dedicated CPU and memory that you get with each request. Some workloads thrive in this model, you don't have to manage these resources if they're guaranteed. And you might lower costs and mitigate scaling concerns. Other workloads perform horribly in this model as the CPU and memory go to waste as a single process could be leveraged for a considerable number of requests, or possibly the shared memory of a server model allows for batching or caching that make processing significantly more performant.</p>
<p>Anecdotally, I've both brought costs down 90% by moving a CMS based web application to a serverless model, and reduced costs 90% moving an event analytics based service to a server based model.</p>
<p>There are many variations of "Severless" such as <a href="https://cloud.google.com/run/">Google Cloud Run</a> or <a href="https://cloud.google.com/functions?hl=en">Google Cloud Functions</a> which lets you have a single process to take any number of concurrent requests. They model this with a Docker container but the tradeoffs are mostly the same. (Lambda these days now has docker support too but traditionally supported a zip file with an executable or script.)</p>
<p>Lastly, the Rack and WSGI specifications heavily influenced the request/response models we see in serverless environments today. With the request and response tuples becoming function or api signatures. Initially most function services did not provide streaming requests or responses (not to mention websockets or Server Side Events) but this has started to change and is worth exploring as application frameworks are starting to demand it.</p>
<h2>Wasm on the Server</h2>
<p>With that context, you might ask;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why on earth are we talking about Wasm? Isn't it for the browser?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And I really hope even my mention of that question becomes dated, but I still hear this question quite often so it's worth talking about. Wasm was initially developed to run high perfromant code in the web browser. There's a history that traces to <a href="http://asmjs.org/"><code>asm.js</code></a> and other attempts to get code to run really fast in the browser. I'll let <a href="https://webassembly.org/">webassembly.org</a> speak for itself.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>WebAssembly (abbreviated Wasm) is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine. Wasm is designed as a portable compilation target for programming languages, enabling deployment on the web for client and server applications. The Wasm stack machine is designed to be encoded in a size- and load-time-efficient binary format. WebAssembly aims to execute at native speed by taking advantage of common hardware capabilities available on a wide range of platforms</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What we have today is the ability to compile many languages to Wasm instructions that can be run in both the browser and the server. While running CPU intensive processes in the browser (like <a href="https://silentspacemarine.com/">Doom</a>) is valuable the isolation and security model that the browser demanded is incredible for server side applications. It's now possible to have a significantly lighter weight form of isolation for untrusted code than a VM or docker container.</p>
<p><span><img alt="Web Assembly Logo" loading="lazy" width="650" height="600" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://roborooter.com/assets/web-assembly-logo.svg"><figcaption>Web Assembly Logo</figcaption></span></p><p>Additionally since V8 based serverless environments (like Node.js, Cloudflare Workers and Deno) are common, we already have some very mature Wasm execution capabilities thanks to the work in the browser. Wasm native environments are few (Fastly, Shopify and Suborbital) I think we'll see many more in the coming years thanks to advances in tooling.</p>
<p>If a Wasm module is instructions for a virtual machine, then you need a virtual machine to execute these instructions. This comes in the form of "runtimes" that will take generic Wasm, compile it for your local architecture, and provide it an execution environment. Some of these environments <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/docs/WASI-tutorial.md">look like POSIX APIs</a> that you'd find on any linux system, and some will do nothing but provide specific functions from the "host" system and allow you to execute exported functions in the module itself. These runtimes are available via libraries in many languages and run in process (or threads or anywhere you like).</p>
<p>Regardless of your runtime, WebAssembly programs are organized into <a href="https://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/syntax/modules.html">modules</a> and the VM running the module is called a "host".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Modules are the unit of deployment, loading, and compilation. A module collects definitions for types, functions, tables, memories, and globals. In addition, it can declare imports and exports and provide initialization in the form of data and element segments, or a start function.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Memories" are represented as a uninterrupted contiguous array of bytes; which are allocated by the host at instantiation time, giving each guest module memory isolation. They function as the RAM for your virtual machine. You can provide them empty or pre-fill them with data segments. One of the many effect of how modules are isolated is that you can "pause" a module, and save its memory as a data segment. A similar concept to a Snapshot of a virtual machine. You can then start as many copies of the paused module as you like. (As I tell friends, it's like saving your game in an emulator.)</p>
<p>The snapshotted module has no extra startup time. The leading utility to perform this is called <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wizer">Wizer</a> and describes the process like so;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First we instantiate the input Wasm module with Wasmtime and run the initialization function. Then we record the Wasm instance's state: What are the values of its globals? What regions of memory are non-zero?
Then we rewrite the Wasm binary by intializing its globals directly to their recorded state, and removing the module's old data segments and replacing them with data segments for each of the non-zero regions of memory we recorded.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If we go back to thinking about our Application Server models; this allows us to have a fresh process but without paying the startup costs of a new process. Essentially giving us CGI without the downsides of CGI. Or in more recent terms, serverless without cold starts. This is how Wasm is the new CGI.</p>
<h2>Tradeoffs of Wasm</h2>
<p>Like any tech choice, it does have some tradeoffs.</p>
<p>Threads are not a native construct, this forces any blocking operation to host methods. This could mean the host handles the bulk of IO operations, providing wrappers for reading and writing to files or network interfaces, pausing the module as convenient or providing callback handlers. It is possible to build a reactor model (eg, tokio, nodejs) or a blocking model for your application. Until the <a href="https://webassembly.github.io/threads/core/">thread proposal</a> lands the constraint of not being able to have threads moves a significant amount of this design to your execution environment.</p>
<p><span><img alt="Threading" loading="lazy" width="650" height="600" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://roborooter.com/assets/Multithreaded_process.svg"><figcaption>A process with two threads of execution, running on one processor from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(computing)#Multithreading">Wikipedia</a></figcaption></span></p><p>Just in Time (JIT) compilation is not possible as dynamic Wasm code generation is not allowed for security reasons. In fact, code itself is not addressable at runtime, which required for traditional JIT compilers as they generate code to replace "hot paths" of an interpreted script. This means systems like V8 and CRuby (and many other scripting environments) which rely on a JIT compiler for performance aren't able to run in a Wasm VM or have to abandon their JIT. There are alternative approaches that borrow from JIT. For example a "pre-jit" build step that outputs an optimized runtime for your script as been proposed. But they are not in wide use yet.</p>
<p>Since Wasm runs in a VM there is a simple interface between a module and its host; Memory. As a result moving data between a Wasm module and its host may require a copy. It is possible to share chunks of memory but depending on how the runtime models memory this may or may not be possible or recommended. (<a href="https://docs.rs/wasmtime/0.21.0/wasmtime/struct.Memory.html">Wasmtime in rust</a> for example uses a vector of bytes which may change out from under you.) As far as I can tell with most run times you cannot have zero copy communication between a module and IO operations. This means streaming data into and out of a Wasm module may be slower than doing it on the host.</p>
<p>Wasm VMs however do provide a much higher level of control. Some runtimes can enforce CPU limits by counting CPU instructions (see the <a href="https://docs.rs/wasmtime/0.31.0/wasmtime/struct.Config.html#method.consume_fuel">Wasmtime fuel concept</a>) which is really cool. All of the VMs are able to limit memory and wall clock time. So if you're looking to control usage limits, it's rather trivial to do.</p>
<p>Upcoming features to Wasm such as <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/interface-types/blob/main/proposals/interface-types/Explainer.md">Interface Types</a> (usable today but not a ratified standard) and module linking (functioning prototypes but no standard approach) help reduce module size and improve IO speed and ergonomics. But they are not standard yet. Wizer currently can interfere with module linking, and while there are custom approaches to solving that problem, there isn't a clear winner. Interface Types provide langue agnostic objects that can move through the Wasm memory boundary without expensive encoding and decoding, today a common approach is to copy JSON into and out of memory.</p>
<p>I've hand waved over security but by default <a href="https://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/intro/introduction.html#security-considerations">Wasm modules only have access to what they're given</a>. It's generally safe to run untrusted Wasm code and the surface area of the VM is quite small. This is not the case with Docker or other isolation models. Timing attacks are possible since the VM will be running translated instructions on the host's hardware, but there are mitigations for such attacks. It is also possible to compile Wasm to a native binary, the surface for attack there is much higher, but is safer than running untrusted native code. (I'm not up on the tradeoffs of this approach.)</p>
<h2>The Future</h2>
<p>Already we're seeing the rise of Wasm execution environments. As they (and their dev tools) get more popular, they will drive scripting languages to have Wasm runtimes and "Wizer like" preboots. In theory your application could be faster to run in snapshotted copy of your app that resumes on each request than with other models available today. Even on our own computers we could in theory take a CLI written in ruby and ship it in a snapshotted Wasm module that links to a Wasm ruby runtime and have it startup nearly as fast as c++ utility and ensure it only ever operates within the confines of a project directory.</p>
<p>Right now I'm seeing enhancements to our existing models and new platforms that are experimenting with what's possible.</p>
<p><span><img alt="Jacquard machine" loading="lazy" width="650" height="600" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://roborooter.com/_next/image/?url=%2Fassets%2FDeutsches_Technikmuseum_Berlin_February_2008_0013.jpg&amp;w=750&amp;q=75 1x, https://roborooter.com/_next/image/?url=%2Fassets%2FDeutsches_Technikmuseum_Berlin_February_2008_0013.jpg&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://roborooter.com/_next/image/?url=%2Fassets%2FDeutsches_Technikmuseum_Berlin_February_2008_0013.jpg&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75"><figcaption>If we go way back this was your application server. The Jacquard machine (from <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=3634542">Wikipedia</a>)</figcaption></span></p><p>The first major enhancement I'm observing is moving "functions" to the "edge" allowing for compute near your users instead of near your database. Edge functions are a new primitive that application frameworks can take advantage of. (<a href="https://vercel.com/features/edge-functions">Vercel Edge Functions</a> being the one I'm working on - which is v8 based but shares many principals.) For example <a href="https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/nextjs#middleware">next-auth</a> can control access to pre rendered pages based upon JWT login tokens. You're able to get dynamic personalized content that is composed of data cached at the CDN.</p>
<p>Another enhancement to existing models (and maybe a natural experiment of a new model) is replacing processes based functions with Wasm based functions for serverless applications. <a href="https://suborbital.dev/">Suborbital</a> (which allows you to build your own Wasm based function execution environment) handles function execution but also allows for innovative chaining of Wasm functions into workflows. Most execution platforms seem to encourage a single module per request ignoring the ability to share memory or quickly invoke multiple modules (even from different languages!). As interface types become standard (very soon as they're part of the Wasm 2.0 spec) I expect to see a "middleware" data model (similar to Rack?) emerge.</p>
<p>It's worth noting an interesting confluence of technologies is that you are able to execute Wasm inside a Lambda function. You're able to use a snapshotted version of your app on existing infrastructure. While it is an interesting mix of technologies that shouldn't be ignored, I imagine it will disappear eventually.</p>
<p>I don't know what the next web application model looks like but I think we're at a tipping point. Wasm improves performance, makes process level security much easier, and lowers the cost of building and executing serverless functions. It can run almost any language and with module linking and interface types it lowers the latency between functions incredibly. When you change the constraints in a system you enable things that were impossible before. All this is very exciting to me and I'm quite eager to help us find out where it goes.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<div><p>I had a plumber over the other day. I was worried that my water service line might be leaking. There was a wet patch in the yard and I noticed that one of my sink’s water pressure seemed to be lower than usual. If the line had a pinhole leak in it, it could easily burst into a multi-thousand dollar flood on my hands. The joys of home ownership.</p>
<p>The plumber listened to my concerns and then inspected a few things: the piping where the service line enters my home, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure_regulator">pressure regulator</a>, the sink in question, and even my water heater.</p>
<p>Afterwards, he told me it’s probably not as bad as I feared, but that I should sit down.</p>
<p>He produced a tablet and turned it to face me.</p>
<p>“Here are your options,” he started, indicating towards a group of boxes on the screen.</p>
<p>“First we have the ‘platinum package’. This includes replacing your pressure regulator with one that is set correctly (apparently pressure regulators can only be set once?), as well as a new water heater, a water softening system, a reverse-osmosis system, an electronic descaler, and a replacement of all your faucet aerators.”</p>
<p>The price was conveniently listed below: six easy monthly payments of $2,500 ($2400 if I was a “member”).</p>
<p>He patiently answered all of my questions about this package, although it was surprisingly hard to get an answer to “Do you think I really need all this?”</p>
<p>From there, we went down the line through the other options. Each cost a little less than the previous, included fewer products, and were more cleverly named than airfare classes; there was ‘premium’ followed by ‘standard’, ‘economy plus’, ‘economy’, and finally ‘band-aid’.</p>
<p>I asked more questions, and I was eventually able to negotiate my own “package” consisting of just what I thought I needed. For closure, no, my water service line was not leaking (probably).</p>
<p>And that’s how you make product give a shit about your architecture proposals.</p>
</div>



<div><h2>You are the plumber</h2>
<p>Your role as a software engineer is to play the plumber to product. The reality of the world is that product holds the money and software development is seen as a cost center to be minimized towards zero. <em>You</em> are selling to <em>them</em>.</p>
<p>Let’s walk through an example.</p>
<h2>How this works</h2>
<p>Your team successfully launched a new product for your company. It’s awesome at what it does, customers love it so far, but it’s still fairly immature.</p>
<p>Product comes to you and says “What our customers need next is the ability to generate reports.”</p>
<p>Now, having been intimately involved in the development of the product, you know how the data is stored. It’s a relational database. It’s fantastic at CRUD operations. It can perform some basic aggregation across related tables, but otherwise it’s ill-suited for something like “reporting”. Besides, product tells you that customers would love if their reports could be sorted and filtered based on customer addresses, but customer address information is actually stored in a completely separate system. And this system calls into <em>yours</em>, not vice-versa. And…, and…, and…</p>
<p>Before you freak out on product and go into all the reasons you can’t do what they want, take a step back and consider:</p>
<ol>
<li>Product doesn’t give a shit about how your data is stored. Product cares about <em>products</em></li>
<li>Product is looking for a <em>result</em>, not a distributed system design interview whiteboard session</li>
<li>Product is human (for now), and they understand that there are engineering considerations. That’s why they came to you in the first place. They came to you for a <em>negotation</em> (more on this in a minute)</li>
</ol>
<p>In other words, product doesn’t give a shit about your architecture proposal. Yet.</p>
<p>Channel your inner plumber.</p>
<p>(Aside, you’ve <em>earned</em> this “problem”. You designed the system correctly to do what it needed to do in order to be a successful product. The natural order of successful products is to evolve beyond their original infrastructure.)</p>
<p>So here’s what you do instead of stuttering through an explanation of “indexes”, “table joins”, and “cardinality”:</p>
<p>You show them the “platinum package”.</p>
<p>This means that you gather up all the information you need to give product exactly what they want, and then you come back to them with an estimate: six easy monthly payments of $2500. Or, rather, you say “One full time mid-level engineer’s time for 6 months on our team, plus one full time engineer’s time from the Infrastructure team.”</p>
<p>Taken aback at such a large estimate (because they were hoping, pretty please, that it would be a single two week sprint. After all, all the data they need is “already in our system”, right?), product utters a single-word question:</p>
<h3>“Why?”</h3>
<p>And <em>that</em> is how you get product to give a shit about your architecture proposal. Suddenly they want to know all about it because they know they can’t afford a full year’s worth of engineering work.</p>
<p>Now you can (gently) talk to them about the difference between online transaction processing systems (OLTP) and online analysis processing systems (OLAP).</p>
<p>Each thing that needs to be done is a line item in your ‘platinum package’ invoice:</p>
<ul>
<li>Define an ETL process to flatten and export our data to Snowflake
<ul>
<li>If you want, you can further break this down into the batch processes that happen, and when, where, and how often they happen, which informs data freshness guarantees</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Similarly define a process to flatten and export the “customer data” from its system</li>
<li>Provision a new Snowflake instance</li>
<li>Front-end and backend work to provide the customer a way to specify what data they want and how</li>
<li>Translating the customer’s request into Snowflake and back</li>
<li>etc. (Saving reports to a document store, emailing them, running them on a schedule, etc. etc. etc.)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Be nice</h2>
<p>During the discussion, you will patiently go into as much detail as product wants about specific line items. You will explain acronyms and technologies. You will explain costs of each to the best of your ability.</p>
<p>And then they can turn around and ask <em>you</em> “Do you really think I need all this?”.</p>
<p>Ah who am I kidding? Product doesn’t give a flying fuck about your opinion, you dirty code monkey. They’ll ask <em>themselves</em> “Do <em>I</em> really need all this?”</p>
<p>And the answer might actually be “yes”.</p>
<p>Sure, it’s hard, and expensive, and time-consuming to do, but that’s how businesses make money; by doing the hard, expensive, time-consuming thing for their customers so their customers don’t have to. Granted, that’s only if your company hasn’t yet started confusing “build something our customers need” with “build something that conveniently fits into a 2 week sprint” (and that’s a big “if”).</p>
<p>I’m not gonna hire a plumber just to wipe the gunk off my sink faucet. That shit is $87 just for them to ring your doorbell. Anyway, I digress.</p>
<h2>It’s a negotiation</h2>
<p>Understandably, product will want to deliver <em>something</em> to their customers sooner than six months, so they’ll reply with things like “What if we put off saving and emailing reports until later?” or “I didn’t realize it would take that long to get these running on a schedule and uploaded to the cloud”, or my favorite, “You are so smart and good looking and totally not a slob that eats lunch at their desk so often that their keyboard has accumulated a mass of crumbs to the point where the shift key sometimes can’t go all the way down, can’t we do everything in the platinum package in two weeks instead of six months?”</p>
<p>A surprising number of developers fall for that last one.</p>
<p>Like, most of them.</p>
<p>Sure, you could “just” murder your database with table-scanning queries that join every single table and hope that you’ve provisioned a beefy enough machine to handle the load “for now”. Just like your plumber could “just” fix a pipe leaking on the floor by shoving a bucket under it and telling you to empty it every week.</p>
<p>But you gotta take a stand on quality somewhere.</p>
<p>Developers fall into the same trap of thinking in terms of whatever length of time their organization parcels out work into: two week “sprints”, six week “cycles”, what have you.
And product is telling them the scope can’t budge. And you know sure as shit you ain’t getting any more team members to handle the load. What’s the only thing that can give at this point? Quality. That’s the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_management_triangle">iron triangle of software development</a>, and you’re its latest victim.</p>
</div>



<figure><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_management_triangle"><img loading="lazy" data-attachment-id="2492" data-permalink="https://gieseanw.wordpress.com/2024/10/09/how-to-make-product-give-a-shit-about-your-architecture-proposal/irontriangle/" data-orig-file="https://gieseanw.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/irontriangle.png" data-orig-size="1024,1024" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="irontriangle" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://gieseanw.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/irontriangle.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://gieseanw.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/irontriangle.png?w=1024" tabindex="0" role="button" width="660" height="660" src="https://gieseanw.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/irontriangle.png?w=660" alt="The iron triangle of software development. An equilateral triangle made out of iron. Its three points are labeled &quot;scope&quot;, &quot;budget&quot;, and &quot;time&quot;. The interior is labeled &quot;quality&quot;."></a></figure>



<div><p>So let me squash the idea of sacrificing quality real quick by asking you a question:</p>
<h3>What’s worse, delivering something a customer actually hates, or delivering nothing at all?</h3>
<p>From painful experience, I can tell you that you’ll lose customers if you choose the former. And the former happens when you sacrifice quality. You don’t want a goddamn bucket under your pipe that you have to empty, you want a new pipe.</p>
<p>Grow a spine and find a level of quality that you will not compromise on. For example, my plumbers won’t install any off-the-shelf parts. They’ll only install products that they supply themselves because they are confident in the quality. At least I charitably believe that instead of the alternative which is that these products are expensive as heck and yet another way to gouge me on the margins.</p>
<p>My point is that <em>quality</em> has some fixed minimum and therefore <em>scope</em> and <em>time</em> are what budges instead. If you make a big enough of a stink you might even get more budget and a bigger team, but if you manage to accomplish that please tell me how.</p>
<p>Now back to the show.</p>
<h2>It’s a negotiation, redux</h2>
<p>After you’ve decided to be a big strong boy that takes a stand on some bare modicum of quality, we can start the negotiations.</p>
<p>When product says things like</p>
<p>&gt; “What if we put off saving and emailing reports until later?”</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>&gt; “What if we dropped running reports on a schedule?”</p>
<p>This is when you start bringing out your ‘standard’ and ‘economy plus’ packages etc. Because you’ve already gone to the trouble of treating these things as line items in an invoice (read: estimated their effort) you can tell product how much their chosen package will cost. You can even give them estimates on <em>when</em> you can deliver these line items, allowing your organization to <em>plan</em> over a longer time horizon with <em>deliverable dates</em> along the way.</p>
<p>It gets interesting when product goes a little off-script and says something like</p>
<p>&gt; “What part of the desired scope can you deliver if I don’t want to pay for an OLAP system?”</p>
<p>Then you can get creative. You are <em>negotiating</em> with product on the two facets of the project that will generally change (mentioned in my rant above): <em>scope</em>, and <em>time</em>.</p>
<p>If I were jaded (I am), I’d say the only thing that really gets negotiated is <em>scope</em> because for some reason every shop out there has decided that an entire project needs to fit within the arbitrary window of time that constitutes whatever definition of “agile” they’re currently following.</p>
<p>If you’re reading this thinking, “No way, management at <em>my</em> company take a longer term view of things in favor of delivering best-in-class products”, then I implore you to include that information in a letter you send to:</p>
</div>



<blockquote>
<p><em>His Holiness<br>Casa Santa Marta<br>00120 Vatican City</em></p>
</blockquote>



<div><p>So they can be canonized as the first living saint.</p>
<p>In many ways, you are simply helping product to ruthlessly prioritize a list of work so that the team can deliver the highest return-on-investment (ROI) within the confines of the fixed <em>time</em>, and <em>budget</em> points of the iron triangle. If there’s enough good stuff left on the table at the end, you might have accidentally planned ahead for your next project for once.</p>
<h2>Turning it around</h2>
<p>If you’re doing your job right, there’s plenty of crap that <em>YOU</em> want to do, but so far we’ve only talked about making the people with the money give it to you when <em>THEY</em> want to do something.</p>
<p>So how do you get product to give a shit about your architecture proposal when the tables are turned?</p>
<p>Well, your local insulation company will gladly come to you, for free, and spend an hour with really expensive thermal imaging gear to find walls that need more insulation. Free because they know that your home’s “builder grade” insulation made of bits of drywall and discarded Monster Energy cans is literally garbage. They’ll tell you that you’ll save $50 a month in heating and cooling costs if only you could give them $5,000.00 now.</p>
<p>You’ll quickly do the math and ask yourself a few questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>am I <em>really</em> that uncomfortable?</li>
<li>do I plan on staying at this home for roughly another 8 years (the time it takes before I’ll recover the investment), and</li>
<li>if I were going to invest five grand, would it be better spent elsewhere?</li>
</ul>
<p>Wow suddenly you’re the product team. Go take a cold shower.</p>
<h3>The equation doesn’t change</h3>
<p>Nothing has changed here except who came up with the idea. Be the insulation company. You <em>still</em> need to come up with line items in an invoice as before. You <em>still</em> need to negotiate time and scope. You <em>still</em> need to make a compelling argument about ROI. Here’s what’s not going to get your proposal greenlit:</p>
<p>&gt; “I want to add a couple more tests to this code the intern wrote last summer”</p>
<p>How the fuck is your company supposed to translate that into ROI? Try this instead:</p>
<p>&gt; “I noticed that “ is under-tested, so I would classify it as high risk of having bugs in it that would be showstoppers. An outage here could cost us big $$$ not just to fix it, but also in customer churn and reputation loss.”</p>
<p>And even if your project gets greenlit, it may be after you make some concessions like the project can’t go on for longer than a week, or that you can’t bring in anyone else on it (that’s the negotiation part).</p>
<h2>You have some petty cash to spend</h2>
<p>The last point I want to make is that you probably have a little free time to do what you want at your job outside of feature work and chores like keeping third party libraries updated. Google called this “20% time” in the early 2000s (and their engineers called it “120% time”).</p>
<p>For the last time, the equation doesn’t change. It’s just that the same person (you) holds the money <em>and</em> proposes the work. You may not need to write out your line items on paper (although it would certainly help); most devs somehow keep that in their head alongside all the movie quotes they endlessly repeat in Slack.</p>
<p>Don’t feel obligated to immediately spend your allowance on small things like linting fixes. You can invest it each week towards something bigger like a pub/sub system so that you can pull a new microservice out of your monolith. Just make sure that the rest of the team is onboard with the bigger changes.</p>
<h2>Summing things up</h2>
<p>When you are elaborating work for product’s next brilliant feature that less than 1% of customers will ever use, elaborate how to do it <em>right</em>. The cost of time, scope, and budget fall out from there. Let product decide if they want to make that investment. Negotiate with your product team on what you can deliver and when, and never back down on quality. Easier said than done.</p>
<p>Harness your inner plumber. Sell that platinum package. It will make dealing with all the shit everyday a little easier.</p>
<p>Until next time.</p>

Videoconferences are the worst: People cannot hear each other, they randomly start sounding like Darth Vader, and they occasionally just disappear from the conversation.</p><p id="p-2">Or you are a small ISP, and your <i>customers</i> say they hate you.</p><p id="p-3">When you talk to your ISP or supplier, they say, “Buy more bandwidth.” When your customers complain to their ISP, they are told the same thing. But when you measure how much bandwidth you are using at the busiest part of the day, it is 30% or 50%.</p><p id="p-4">In a sense, the suppliers are right: Bandwidth really boils down to the “diameter of the pipe” between you and your employees or customers. If it is too small your data, connections, and more will really get bogged down.</p>

<p id="p-5">Once you are not filling the pipe, though, when you are only 50% busy, you need to look at the software and see what is keeping your packets from arriving in a reasonable amount of time. For example, I once measured the time to send a “ping” to downtown Toronto from my home office in the suburbs. It took 0.13s to get downtown and back. That is the normal ping time for Istanbul, Turkey, roughly 8,000 km away.<a href="#FN1" data-jats-rid="FN1" data-jats-ref-type="fn"><sup>a</sup></a></p><p id="p-6">That is a pure software problem, and it is called <i>high latency</i>.</p></section><section id="sec2"><h2>Bandwidth Is How Much, Latency Is How Slow</h2><p id="p-7">If you think of the Internet as a series of pipes, then bandwidth conveys how much data you can send down the pipe.

Contention.</figcaption></figure></div></figure><p id="p-13">If you have bad router software, the smaller Zoom slices will have to sit around in a queue (buffering) until the photos finish. Because the Zoom slices are delayed, other people on the Zoom call may see you freeze or stutter. Sometimes you will sound like you are shouting from the bottom of a well. On really bad days, you will just drop out.</p></section><section id="sec4"><h2>Bad Router Software</h2><p id="p-14">In the home, the problem is in the software on the home router, which connects to the wider Internet. The bug is called <i>bufferbloat,</i><a href="#B1" data-jats-ref-type="bibr" data-jats-rid="B1"><sup>1</sup></a> as described by Phillipa Harrison in the <i>Communications</i> research article, “Buffer-Bloated Router? How to Prevent It and Improve Performance.”<a href="#B2" data-jats-ref-type="bibr" data-jats-rid="B2"><sup>2</sup></a> In this bug, the sender buffers up the photos and as soon as the network is available, sends them all. While doing that, it cannot send the videoconferencing slices, so it delays them and sends them only after the photos complete.</p><p id="p-15">That might be fine for computers, but humans discussing something need their words to come in the right order, without delays or interruptions. The photos should share the network fairly with the videoconference and not steal all the bandwidth.</p></section><section id="sec5"><h2>Good Router Software</h2><p id="p-16">In the best of all possible worlds, every router on the Internet would be running software that has the latest changes to minimize latency, usually fq_codel or CAKE. Unfortunately, not everyone can update as often as they would like, and router manufacturers are often years behind on rewriting their proprietary operating systems to include the newest fixes. Some are even back at PIE, a much older predecessor to CAKE.</p><p id="p-17">Home modem/router/Wi-Fi boxes are, if anything, worse. They get built, used, and thrown away when they die. They never get updated. The net result is a lot of old, buggy software on the Internet, and a lot of packets sitting in queues twiddling their thumbs as they wait for a chance to be sent.</p><p id="p-18">Individuals took control of the problem by adding a smarter router between their home and their ISP’s modem/router/Wi-Fi box. The smart router keeps data flowing as fast as the pipe will allow, sending “I’m having contention” signals that the older software can understand when any of the machines in your home network send too much.</p></section><section id="sec6"><h2>Fixing the ISP</h2><p id="p-19">Adding devices to the home does not scale. If you are a company, you cannot afford to buy a new home router for each of your employees. If you are an ISP, you cannot just tear out painfully expensive core routers to install newer ones.</p><p id="p-20">The answer is not to tear out routers but to adapt the techniques used in the home. If your customers hate you, put a device with modern software in the path to your customers, downstream of your routers. Such a device is dedicated only to dealing with buffering, bloat, and contention. That also keeps the price down, because an older single-socket Xeon with eight cores can handle 10Gbps of traffic.</p><p id="p-21">The name of the software for the ISP device is LibreQoS (<a href="https://libreqos.io/" data-jats-ext-link-type="uri">https://libreqos.io/</a>), where <i>QoS</i> means <i>quality of service</i>. It came out from the same team that pioneered the fq_codel and CAKE software that addressed the problem at the home-router end.</p><p id="p-22">They viewed the problem from the Internet end and set out to help ISPs and other companies that could not trivially buy more bandwidth, but instead had to make better use of what they had.</p><p id="p-23">Their solution is to apply a complete suite of fixes to IP networking, which includes:</p><ul data-jats-list-type="bullet"><li><p id="p-24">Fair queuing</p></li><li><p id="p-25">Bandwidth shaping</p></li><li><p id="p-26">Active queue management</p></li><li><p id="p-27">Diffserv handling</p></li><li><p id="p-28">Ack filtering</p></li><li><p id="p-29">Network topology awareness</p></li><li><p id="p-30">Parallel processing</p></li><li><p id="p-31">Bypassing Linux bridge overheads</p></li><li><p id="p-32">Built-in round-trip time measurement to show the improvement</p></li></ul><p id="p-33">All these fixes work together to find the highest rate that does not overload the slowest part of the system. That means packets do not have to sit in a queue at the ISP, waiting for a chance to be sent, like the videoconferencing packets waiting at home for an image to finish uploading.</p><p id="p-34">The first fixes are fair queuing and control of delay, from fq_codel.</p><p id="p-35">CAKE then added Active Queue Management (AQM), which performs the same kind of bandwidth probing that vanilla TCP does but adds in-band congestion signaling to detect congestion as soon as possible. The transmission rate is slowly raised until a congestion signal is received, then reduced. Once reduced, it starts increasing again, continuously searching for the highest rate it can use without causing a queue to build up. The algorithm used is an extension of fq_codel.</p><p id="p-36">The fairness component prevents particular flows from being starved of resources by other streams, like our photo example, or by hosts starting large numbers of streams to try stealing as much of the network bandwidth as they can.</p><p id="p-37">Diffserv is a mechanism for labeling packets as interactive (high priority) through bulk (low priority), so bulk file transfer can be recognized and kept from delaying videoconferences.</p><p id="p-38">Related to this, but not part of diffserv itself, is an algorithm to detect and properly prioritize sparse flows, so they will not be starved.</p><p id="p-39">Ack filtering entirely removes packets that are merely carrying an acknowledgment of received data, so long as there are enough non-empty packets flowing the same way to take over that task.</p><p id="p-40">Next, we come to LibreQoS itself, which adds components specific to running at the ISP end of the network. The first component is a network topology tree, because an ISP will have many routes to its customers, each with its own maximum rate that must be discovered and processed by its own instance of the flow-shaping code.</p><p id="p-41">On top of this sits a hierarchical token-bucket classifier that sorts the incoming packets into the correct CPU core and the correct “shaper” rule. The standard Linux shaper that CAKE uses is single-threaded and tends to run out of capacity above 6Gbps. The LibreQoS shaper is limited only by the number and speed of the CPU cores and Ethernet cards.</p><p id="p-42">LibreQoS 1.4 introduced a new fast Ethernet bridge, based on eXpress Data Path (XDP) and extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF), to avoid bottlenecking on the <code>ksoftirqd</code> thread in the kernel. When they were finished with the performance work, the LibreQoS crew added software to measure and manage the improvement: a new low-overhead <i>round-trip time sensor</i>, a packet-capture system, and a suite of real-time programs to measure and visualize the performance of large numbers of routes and customers.</p><p id="p-43">This is a mature technology and runs on standard equipment, such as an ISP might already have. As a concrete example, an ISP delivering 1Gbps service plans to its customers and with up to 10Gbps total throughput would need a CPU such as an Intel Xeon E-2388G with eight cores, 16GB of memory, and a dual-port 10G Ethernet card—a very ordinary 1u-sized machine from 2021.</p><p id="p-44">Now a company with bad performance can ask its ISP to fix it and point at the software and people who have already used it. If the ISP already knows it has a performance complaint, it can get ahead of the problem by proactively implementing LibreQoS.</p></section><section id="sec7"><h2>Proof</h2><p id="p-45">If you have already solved the problem with LibreQoS, you can see the fix happening in real time. In Figure <a href="#F4" data-jats-ref-type="fig" data-jats-rid="F4">4</a>, a customer is downloading Diablo 2 and Diablo 4 at the same time over a 100Mbps link. The link shows as completely saturated in the throughput graph, but the delay is tiny: 1.7ms with peaks to 3.1. Fair queuing keeps the delay below levels that humans or Zoom can detect.</p><figure id="F4" data-jats-position="float"><p><a data-fslightbox="https://cacm.acm.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/3690840_fig04.jpg" data-type="image" data-caption="Figure 4.

And <i>badly</i> is exactly how it behaved until I put a debloated home router in front of the ISP’s device.</p><figure id="F5" data-jats-position="float"><p><a data-fslightbox="https://cacm.acm.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/3690840_fig05.jpg" data-type="image" data-caption="Figure 5.

<p><strong>Content warning:</strong> This blog post references domestic abuse and violence but doesn’t go into specific detail.</p>
<p>I’m not an expert in that topic <em>at all</em>, so I may not use the preferred terminology in all instances. Sorry.</p>
</div>
<p>Last year (oh how time flies), we launched the <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/exit-this-page/">GOV.UK Design System’s Exit this Page component</a>, or EtP for short.</p>
<picture>
  <source type="image/webp" srcset="https://beeps.website/images/-6SGpmSnGw-300.webp 300w, https://beeps.website/images/-6SGpmSnGw-600.webp 600w, https://beeps.website/images/-6SGpmSnGw-900.webp 900w, https://beeps.website/images/-6SGpmSnGw-1164.webp 1164w" sizes="(min-width: 768px) 66vi, 100vi"><img loading="lazy" src="https://beeps.website/images/-6SGpmSnGw-1164.webp" width="1164" height="400" alt="A large red button with 'Exit this page' written on it in plain white text."></picture>
<p>On the surface, it’s a simple component. It’s a big red button that sticks to the top of the screen. If you click it, you’re taken away to BBC Weather.</p>
<p>But it does so much more.</p>
<p>If you press the <kbd>⇧ Shift</kbd> key on your keyboard three times, you get a visual indicator that you are activating the button. Upon the third press, the page you’re on is blanked out and you’re redirected away to… well, BBC Weather again.</p>
<p>It’s intended to be a safety tool. A way for people in unstable, potentially violent, domestic situations to quickly leave the page.</p>
<p>But one question that comes up a lot is…</p>
<h2 id="why-don%E2%80%99t-you-use-escape%3F">Why don’t you use Escape?</h2>
<p>It’s a decent question. Many other implementations of buttons like this exist, and of the ones that provide a keyboard shortcut, they almost universally use the Escape key: <kbd>Esc</kbd>.</p>
<p>And it’s literally called Escape. Why wouldn’t you use it for an escape function?</p>
<p>Basically, it doesn’t quite work like that. There was a veritable rabbit hole of barriers that ultimately led us towards using a different key.</p>

    <blockquote>
<p>Do rabbit holes normally have barriers, actually?</p>
</blockquote>
  </figure>
<h3 id="1.-escape-stops-the-browser-from-loading-pages">1. Escape stops the browser from loading pages</h3>
<p>In virtually all browsers, pressing Escape while a webpage is loading stops the loading process.</p>
<p>This is literally the last thing we want to happen for a feature whose sole job is to load a different page from the one you’re on.</p>
<p>If we had used Escape, it would be too easy for a user to accidentally cancel the redirection process and end up stuck on the current page, and that’d be a bit naff.</p>
<h3 id="2.-escape-performs-other-functions-in-the-operating-system">2. Escape performs other functions in the operating system</h3>
<p>In addition to cancelling loading, we found that the Escape key was used by too many other functions to reliably work for exiting the page.</p>
<p>For example, Escape is also used to exit fullscreen media (and on macOS, fullscreen apps), close modal dialogs and popovers (including those generated by native input controls), cancel a dragging interaction, clear a text input, and dismiss notifications.</p>
<p>Assistive technologies may also use the Escape key for functionality, and it is also used as part of keyboard shortcuts.</p>
<p>All of these take priority over the page’s JavaScript, which often meant needing to press the Escape key more than the requisite three times, creating confusion as to whether the function actually worked as advertised.</p>
<p>In the case of macOS and fullscreen apps, it even involved having to wait for the re-windowing animation to finish before the page could begin to intercept Escape key presses again. Very not ideal.</p>
<h3 id="3.-pressing-escape-isn%E2%80%99t-considered-a-user-interaction">3. Pressing Escape isn’t considered a user interaction</h3>
<p>Do you remember popup ads? When you’d open up a website and immediately a new window would open purely to shove advertising in your face?</p>
<p>How about autoplaying audio and videos? Or when pages begged you to stay when you tried to close them? Or those immediate “do you want notifications from us?” dialogs?</p>
<p>These are all the result of people exploiting JavaScript’s mostly-unrestricted ability to do stuff, usually to try and make money.</p>
<p>As a result of advertising people being bastards, more and more of what the web platform can do is now being locked behind the requirement of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Transient_activation">transient activation</a>—that is, the browser will refuse to run pieces of JavaScript unless it is <em>certain</em> that some manner of user interaction took place with the intention of running it.</p>
<p>Browsers use a few different heuristics to determine user interaction, including touches, mouse movements, and key presses. If it detects one of these that seems human enough, it will allow transiently activated code to run for a short period afterwards.</p>

    <blockquote>
<p>This can have some unfortunate ramifications on accessibility.</p>
<p>As we’ve recently learned on the GOV.UK Design System team, webpage interactions made by some assistive software (in this case, Dragon NaturallySpeaking) are not considered user interactions for the purposes of transient activation, so some JavaScript code will either not work or will work inconsistently for users of that software.</p>
</blockquote>
  </figure>
<p>Redirecting the user away to another page via JavaScript is one such function that requires user interaction before it will run.</p>
<p>And <kbd>Esc</kbd> is <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/interaction.html#user-activation-processing-model:activation-triggering-input-event">the <em>only</em> keyboard key that doesn’t count as user interaction</a> for the purposes of transient activation.</p>
<p>This meant that if a user tried to use the EtP shortcut immediately after a page loaded, or after a short period having not interacted with the page (for example, if they were busy reading it), the redirection just wouldn’t work. Totally doubleplus ungood.</p>
<h2 id="alternative-keys">Alternative keys</h2>
<p>With adequate evidence that Escape wouldn’t work for us, we started looking at other non-typing keys we could use.</p>
<p>Testing with the Control key (<kbd>⌃ Ctrl</kbd>) worked much better, avoiding virtually all of the pitfalls of Escape, but there were still a few cons to it.</p>
<p>Control conflicted with VoiceOver’s default configuration—where pressing Control mutes VoiceOver.</p>
<p>Control was also the only key of those we were considering that wasn’t in a physically consistent location on different UK keyboards: While on standalone keyboards the key tends to appear in the far bottom-left, on laptops it is commonly offset inwards to make room for an additional function key.</p>
<p>This innocuous difference had the potential to slow down a user’s ability to quickly activate the shortcut, especially if they were using unfamiliar hardware.</p>
<p>The Alt or Option keys (<kbd>⎇ Alt</kbd> or <kbd>⌥ Option</kbd>), by comparison, were more problematic.</p>
<p>Most obviously: It’s named differently on different systems. Guidance and help documentation would get rather more verbose if we had to constantly call it Alt, Option, Opt, the key with <kbd>⌥</kbd> on it, and so on in every instance.</p>
<p>The key’s use for typing letters with diacritics and other ‘alt codes’ meant that the keypresses reported to the browser weren’t always aligned with what physical keys the user had actually pressed, meaning we couldn’t be reliably sure if the user was intending to exit the page or not.</p>
<p>Alt/Option, like Escape, also had the issue of being utilised by some browser- and system-level functions, such as a shortcut to access application menus.</p>
<p>In Chromium browsers on Windows, for example, pressing Alt would move keyboard focus out of the webpage and to the browser UI—completely removing the user from the webpage context. This prevented subsequent key presses from being detected, and obviously made EtP functionality not work at all.</p>
<h2 id="shift-was-better%2C-but-it%E2%80%99s-still-not-perfect">Shift was better, but it’s still not perfect</h2>
<p>So we landed on <kbd>⇧ Shift</kbd>. Shift works more consistently than Escape did, but still has a bunch of caveats:</p>
<ul>
<li>Its use during normal typing meant needing to be careful about which presses actually counted towards activation.</li>
<li>Pressing Shift three times requires many more presses if the Sticky Keys accessibility features is active. I found that it took between 6 and 9 presses with Windows Sticky Keys, depending on speed, and 9 presses with macOS Sticky Keys.</li>
<li>macOS’s Slow Keys feature still takes three presses, but they have to be spread across a period of a few seconds to avoid activating the ‘latching’ functionality.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/FreedomScientific/standards-support/issues/699">The JAWS screen reader in Chromium would register the first Shift keypress twice</a>, though this has potentially been fixed since.</li>
<li>Using Shift means that the shortcut is available on touch device’s virtual keyboards. However, these keyboards tend to behave unpredictably compared to their hardware equivalents. I wrote up <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/issues/4095">a massive bug report just about how the Shift key behaves on iOS</a>, part of which subsequently became <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=273681">a bug report</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite these shortfalls, Shift was ultimately the least flawed of the choices presented to us, with most of its issues being fairly minor and none of them being showstopping.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>So that’s where we are now.</p>
<p>In some ways, this is an unfortunate case of technology and web standards working against what would be the ideal user experience. <kbd>Esc</kbd> <em>would</em> be the ideal key to use, but it has too many caveats to work consistently.</p>
<p>We looked into opening the redirection page in a new tab and automatically closing the previous tab, as some similar tools do, but user research found that this often caused confusion (‘Why doesn’t the back button work?’, ‘Where did my work go?’) and doing that is also subject to transient activation requirements.</p>
<p>We would’ve also liked to have had the button overwrite or erase the user’s recent browser history, but we can’t do that either. (And for good reason!)</p>
<p>Ultimately, we had to land on the philosophy of doing better, but not aiming for perfection. We could never write a piece of JavaScript that could prevent domestic violence, prying surveillance, or controlling relationships—we can only do what we can do.</p>
<p>No one has complained about us using Shift instead of Escape, nor have we received any bug reports about it not working, but it certainly raises an eyebrow when folks hear about it for the first time…</p>
<p>As for the other major question we get…</p>
<h2 id="bonus%3A-why-does-it-redirect-the-user-to-bbc-weather%3F">Bonus: Why does it redirect the user to BBC Weather?</h2>
<p>As civil servants, we didn’t want to link to a news service as that could lead to claims of political bias.</p>
<p>I also argued (a lot) against linking to the Google homepage—despite this being ridiculously common—because… who actually uses the Google homepage? Google search is right there in your URL bar.</p>
<p>Even if you do go to Google’s homepage, the first action you normally take once there is to leave Google’s homepage.</p>
<p>If you walked in on someone and they were nervously staring at Google’s homepage, you’d be suspicious as hell.</p>
<p>BBC Weather’s homepage is a content-rich page. Users have a reason to be looking at it and to be looking for an extended period of time. It may even default to the user’s location, displaying significantly more personalised content in the process, which is surely less suspicious than a blank, generic search form.</p>

            <p>
              Thought this was neat? Why not

Salvatore <i><a href="http://invece.org/">antirez</a></i> Sanfilippo, 6 March 2006<br>
<small>Why Tcl is not a toy language, but a very powerful one</small>

<p>
In an article recently linked from reddit entitled
<a href="http://www.cabochon.com/~stevey/blog-rants/tour-de-babel.html">
Tour de Babel</a> you can read (among lots of other nonsense):
<i>Heck, people still use Tcl as an embedded interpreter, even though Python is far superior to Tcl in every conceivable way -- except, that is, for the frost thing.</i>
</p><p>
Ok, the whole article is well.. not very valid, but unfortunately while
many misconceptions are promptly recognized by the informed reader,
this one against Tcl is generally believed at face value. I hope this article
will convince people that Tcl is not that bad.

</p><h2>Prologue</h2>
<p>
In my programming life I have used a lot of languages to write different
kind of applications: many free/paywork programs in C, a web CMS
in Scheme, a number of networking/web applications in Tcl, a shop
management system in Python, and so on. I used to play with a number
of other programming languages like Smalltalk, Self, FORTH, Ruby, Joy,...
And yet, I have no doubt, that <b>there is no language that is as misunderstood
in the programming community as Tcl is</b>.
</p><p>Tcl is not without faults, but most of its limitations are not
hard coded in the language design, they are just the result of the
fact that Tcl lost its "father" (John Ousterhout) a number of years ago, and together with him any kind
of single-minded strong leadership that was able to take strong
decisions. With the right changes it is possible
to overcome most of the limitations of Tcl, and at the same
time preserve the power of the language. If you don't trust Tcl is remarkably
powerful please <b>take the time</b> to read this article first. Maybe
you still won't like it afterwards, but hopefully you will respect it, and you will certainly  have strong arguments against
the <i>Tcl is a toy language</i> misconception that's even more petty than
<i>Lisp has too many parenthesis</i>.
</p><p>
Before we begin, I'll spend some time explaining
how Tcl works. Like the best languages in the world, Tcl has a few
concepts that, combined together, allow for programming freedom
and expressiveness.
</p><p>After this short introduction to Tcl, you'll see how in Tcl
things very similar to Lisp macros just happen using normal
procedures (in a much more powerful way than Ruby blocks),
how it's possible to redefine almost every part of the language
itself, and how it is possible to mostly ignore
types when programming. The Tcl community developed
a number of OOP systems, radical language modifications, macro
systems, and many other interesting things, just writing Tcl
programs. If you like programmable programming languages I bet
you'll at least look on it with interest.

</p><h2>Tcl in five minutes</h2>
<h3>Concept 1: Programs are composed of commands</h3>
<p>
The first idea of the Tcl language is: commands.
Programs are commands, one after the other. For
example to set the variable 'a' to 5 and print its value
you write two commands:
</p><pre>set a 5
puts $a
</pre>
<p>
Commands are space separated words.
A command ends with a newline or with a <b>;</b> character.
<b>Everything</b> is a command in Tcl - as you can see there
is no assignment operator.  To set a variable you need a command,
the <b>set</b> command, that sets the variable specified as the
first argument to the value specified as the second argument.
</p><p>
Almost every Tcl command returns a value, For example the <b>set</b>
command returns the value assigned to the variable. If the
<b>set</b> command is called with just one argument (the variable
name), the current value of the variable is returned.
</p><h3>Concept 2: Command substitution</h3>
<p>
The second idea is command substitution. In a command some arguments
may appear between <b>[</b> and <b>]</b> braces. If so
the argument is substituted with the return value of the code
included inside the braces. For example:
</p><pre>set a 5
puts [set a]
</pre>
<p>
The first argument of the second command, [set a], will be
substituted with the return value of "set a" (that's 5).
After the substitution step the command will be converted from:
</p><pre>puts [set a]
</pre>
to
<pre>puts 5
</pre>
And, at that point, it will be executed.
<h3>Concept 3: Variable substitution</h3>
<p>
Always using the <b>set</b> command for variable substitution
would be too verbose, so even if not strictly needed, variable substitution
was introduced at some time during the early development of Tcl.
If a variable name is preceded by the <b>$</b> character
it is substituted with its value. So instead of
</p><pre>puts [set a]
</pre>
it's possible to write
<pre>puts $a
</pre>
<h3>Concept 4: Grouping</h3>
<p>
If commands are space separated words, how to deal with the
need for arguments that may contain spaces? For example:
</p><pre>puts Hello World
</pre>
<p>
is an incorrect program as Hello and World are two different
arguments. This problem is solved by grouping. Text inside ""
is considered a single argument, so the right program is:
</p><pre>puts "Hello World"
</pre>
<p>
Commands and variables substitution work inside this kind
of grouping, For example I can write:
</p><pre>set a 5
set b foobar
puts "Hello $a World [string length $b]"
</pre>
<p>
And the result will be "Hello 5 World 6". Also, escapes
like \t, \n will do what you think.   There is, however, another kind
of grouping where every kind of special character is just
considered verbatim without any kind of substitution step.
Everything between { and } is seen by Tcl as a unique argument
where no substitutions are performed. So:
</p><pre>set a 5
puts {Hello $a World}
</pre>
<p>
Will print <i>Hello $a World</i>.
</p><h3>Concept 1 again: Everything is a command</h3>
<p>
Concept 1 was: programs are composed of commands. Actually it
is much more true than you may think. For example in the program:
</p><pre>set a 5
if $a {
    puts Hello!
}
</pre>
<p>
<b>if</b> is a command, with two arguments. The first is the value
of the variable a substituted, the second is the string { ... puts Hello! ... }.
The <b>if</b> command uses a special version of <b>Eval</b>
that we'll see in a moment to run the script passed as the second
argument, and returns the result. Of course, you can write
your version of <b>if</b> or any other control structure if
you want. You may even redefine <b>if</b> itself and add some
feature to it!
</p><h3>Concept 5: Everything is a string - no types</h3>
The following program works and does what you think:
<pre>set a pu
set b ts
$a$b "Hello World"
</pre>
<p>
Yes, in Tcl everything happens at runtime and is dynamic: it's
the ultimate late binding programming language, and there are no
types. The command name is not a special type but just a string.
Numbers are also just strings, so is Tcl code, a string (remember
we passed a string to the <b>if</b> command as second argument?).
In Tcl what a string represents is up to the command that's manipulating
it. the string "5" will be seen as a string of characters by
the "string length 5" command, and as a boolean value by "if $a ..."
command. Of course commands check that values have a suitable
form, If I try to add "foo" to "bar" Tcl will produce an exception
because it can't parse "foo" nor "bar" as numbers. This kind
of checks in Tcl are very strict, so you'll not get the PHP-alike
effect of silent absurd type conversions. The type conversion only
happens if the string makes sense interpreted as the thing the command
needs as arguments.
</p><p>
So Tcl is so dynamic, but guess what? It is more or less as fast as current
Ruby implementations. There is a trick in the implementation of
Tcl: objects (not in the OOP sense, but C structs representing
Tcl values) cache the native value of the last use of a given
string. If a Tcl value is always used as a number the C struct
representing it will contain an integer inside, and as long as
the next commands continue to use it as an integer, the string
representation of the object is not touched at all. It's a bit more complex
than this, but the result is that <b>the programmer doesn't need to
think about types</b>, and programs still work as fast as other
dynamic programming languages where types are more explicit.
</p><h3>Concept 6: Tcl lists</h3>
<p>
One of the more interesting types (or better.. string formats)
Tcl uses is lists. Lists are mostly the central structure
of a Tcl program: a Tcl list is always a valid Tcl command!
(and both are just strings, in the end).
In the simplest form lists are like commands: space separated
words. For example the string "a b foo bar" is a list with four elements.
There are commands to take a range of elements from a list,
to add elements, and so on. Of course, lists may have elements
containing spaces, so in order to create well formatted lists
the <b>list</b> command is used. Example:
</p><pre>set l [list a b foo "hello world"]
puts [llength $l]
</pre>
<p>
<b>llength</b> returns the length of the list, so the above
program will print 4 as output. <b>lindex</b> will
instead return the element at the specified position,
so "lindex $l 2" will return "foo", and so on.
Like in Lisp, in Tcl most programmers use the list type
to model as many concepts as possible in programs.
</p><h3>Concept 7: Math in Tcl</h3>
<p>
I bet most Lisp hackers already noted how Tcl is a prefix-notation
language, so you may think like in Lisp, math in Tcl is performed
using math operators as commands, like: puts [+ 1 2].
Instead, things work in a different way: in order to make Tcl more
friendly there is a command taking infix math expressions as
argument and evaluating them. This command is called <b>expr</b>, and
math in Tcl works like this:
</p><pre>set a 10
set b 20
puts [expr $a+$b]
</pre>
<p>
Commands like <b>if</b> and <b>while</b> use <b>expr</b>
internally in order to evaluate expressions, for instance:
</p><pre><p>
while {$a &lt; $b} {
    puts Hello
}

</p><p>
where the while command takes two arguments - the first string being evaluated
as an <b>expr</b>ession to check if it's true at every iteration,
and the second <b>eval</b>uated itself each time.
I think it's a design error that math commands are not builtins,
I see <b>expr</b> like a cool tool to have where there is
complex math to do, but to just add two numbers [+ $a $b]
is more convenient.  It's worth noting that this has been formally
proposed as a change to the language.
</p><h3>Concept 8: Procedures</h3>
<p>
Naturally, nothing stops a Tcl programmer from writing a procedure (that's
a user defined command) in order to use math operators as commands.
Like this:
</p><pre>proc + {a b} {
    expr {$a+$b}
}
</pre>
<p>
The <b>proc</b> command is used to create a procedure: its first
argument is the procedure name, the second is the list of arguments
the procedure takes as input, and finally the last argument
is the body of the procedure. Note that the second argument,
the arguments list, is a Tcl list. As you can see the return
value of the last command in a procedure is used as return
value of the procedure (unless the <b>return</b> command is used
explicitly).
But wait... Everything is a command in Tcl right? So we can create
the procedures for +, -, *, ... in a simpler way instead of writing four
different procedures:
</p><pre>set operators [list + - * /]
foreach o $operators {
    proc $o {a b} [list expr "\$a $o \$b"]
}
</pre>
<p>
After this we can use [+ 1 2], [/ 10 2] and so on.
Of course it's smarter to create these procedures as varargs
like Scheme's procedures. In Tcl procedures can have the same names
as built in commands, so you can redefine Tcl itself. For example, in order
to write <a href="http://wiki.tcl.tk/sugar">a macro system for Tcl</a>
I redefined <b>proc</b>. Redefining proc is also useful
for writing profilers (Tcl profilers are developed in Tcl itself usually).
After a built in command is redefined you can still call it if you
<b>rename</b>d it to some other name prior to overwriting it with <b>proc</b>.
</p><h3>Concept 9: Eval and Uplevel</h3>
<p>
If you are reading this article you already know what <b>Eval</b>
is. The command <i>eval {puts hello}</i> will of course evaluate the
code passed as argument, as happens in many other
programming languages. In Tcl there is another beast,
a command called <b>uplevel</b> that can evaluate code in the
context of the calling procedure, or for what it's worth, in
the context of the caller of the caller (or directly at the top level).
What this means is that what in Lisp are macros, in Tcl are just
simple procedures. Example: in Tcl there is no "built-in"
for a command <b>repeat</b> to be used like this:
</p><pre>repeat 5 {
    puts "Hello five times"
}
</pre>
But to write it is trivial.
<pre>proc repeat {n body} {
    set res ""
    while {$n} {
        incr n -1
        set res [uplevel $body]
    }
    return $res
}
</pre>
<p>
Note that we take care to save the result of the last
evaluation, so our <b>repeat</b> will (like most Tcl
commands) return the last evaluated result.
An example of usage:
</p><pre>set a 10
repeat 5 {incr a} ;# Repeat will return 15
</pre>
<p>
As you can guess, the <b>incr</b> command is used to increment
an integer var by one (if you omit its second argument).
"incr a" is executed in the context of the calling procedure,
(i.e. the previous stack frame).
</p><p>Congratulations, you know more than 90% of Tcl concepts!
</p><h2>Why is Tcl powerful?</h2>
<p>
I am not going to show you every single Tcl feature, but I want to give an idea
of advanced programming tasks that are solved in a very nice
way with Tcl. I want to stress that I think <b>Tcl has a number
of faults</b>, but most of them are not in the main ideas of
the language itself.  I think there is room for a Tcl-derived
language that can compete with Ruby, Lisp and Python today in interesting
domains like web programming, network programming, GUI development, DSL
and as scripting language.
</p><h3>Simple syntax that scales</h3>
<p>Tcl syntax is so simple that you can write a parser for Tcl
in few lines of code in Tcl itself. I wrote
<a href="http://wiki.tcl.tk/sugar">a macro system for Tcl in Tcl</a>
									    as I already mentioned, which is able to do source level transformations complex enough
to allow tail call optimization.
At the same time, Tcl syntax is able to scale to appear more
algol-like, it depends on your programming style.
</p><h3>No types, but strict format checks</h3>
<p>
There are no types, and you don't need to perform conversions,
however, you aren't likely to introduce bugs because the checks on the format
of the strings are very strict. Even better, you <b>don't need
serialization</b>. Have a big complex Tcl list and want to send
it via a TCP socket? Just write: <b>puts $socket $mylist</b>.
On the other side of the socket read it as <b>set mylist [read $socket]</b>.
and you are done.
</p><h3>Powerful, event driven I/O model</h3>
<p>
Tcl has built-in event-driven programming, integrated with the I/O library. To write complex networking programs with just what is provided in the core language is so simple it's funny. An example: the following program is
a <b>concurrent</b> (internally select(2) based) TCP server that outputs
the current time to every client.
</p><pre>socket -server handler 9999
proc handler {fd clientaddr clientport} {
    set t [clock format [clock seconds]]
    puts $fd "Hello $clientaddr:$clientport, current date is $t"
    close $fd
}
vwait forever
</pre>
<p>
Non-blocking I/O and events are handled so well that you can even
write to a socket where there is no longer output buffer and Tcl
will automatically buffer it in userland and send it in background to the socket
when there is again space on the socket's output buffer.
</p><p>
Python users know a good idea when they see it - Python's "Twisted"
framework makes use of the same select-driven IO concepts that Tcl has
had natively for years.
</p><h3>Multiple paradigms</h3>
<p>
In Tcl you can write object oriented code, functional style code,
and imperative code in a mix, like it happens in Common Lisp more
or less. A number of OOP systems and Functional Programming primitives
where implemented in the past. There are everything from prototype-based
OOP systems to SmallTalk-like ones, and many are implemented in Tcl
itself (or were initially, as a proof-of-concept). Furthermore, because code in Tcl
is first class, it is very simple to write functional language
primitives that play well with the logic of the language.
An example is <b>lmap</b>:
</p><pre>lmap i {1 2 3 4 5} {
    expr $i*$i
}
</pre>
<p>
which will return a list of squares, 1 4 9 12 25. You can write
a <b>map</b>-like function based on a version of lamba
(also developed in Tcl itself), but Tcl has already what you
need to allow for a more natural functional programming than
the Lisp way (which works well for Lisp but maybe not for everything
else).  Note what happens when you try to add functional programming
to a language that's too rigid: Python and the endless debate of
its functional primitives.
</p><h3>Central data structure: the list</h3>
<p>
If you are a Lisp programmer you know how beautiful is to
have a flexible data structure like the list everywhere in your
programs, especially when the literal is as simple as
"foo bar 3 4 5 6" in most cases.
</p><h3>Programmable programming language via uplevel</h3>
<p>
Via eval, uplevel, upvar and the very powerful introspection
capabilities of Tcl you can redefine the language and invent
new ways of solving problems. For example, the following interesting
command if called as first command in a function will <b>automagically
make it a memoizing version</b> of the function:
</p><pre>proc memoize {} {
    set cmd [info level -1]
    if {[info level] &gt; 2 &amp;&amp; [lindex [info level -2] 0] eq "memoize"} return
    if {![info exists ::Memo($cmd)]} {set ::Memo($cmd) [eval $cmd]}
    return -code return $::Memo($cmd)
}
</pre>
Then, when you write a procedure just write something like:
<pre>proc myMemoizingProcedure { ... } {
    memoize
    ... the rest of the code ...
} 
</pre>
<h3>i18n just happens</h3>
<p>
Tcl is probably the language with the best internationalization
support. Every string is internally encoded in utf-8, all the
string operations are Unicode-safe, including the regular expression
engine. Basically, in Tcl programs, encodings are not a problem -
they just work.
</p><h3>Radical language modifications = DSL</h3>
<p>
If you define a procedure called <b>unknown</b> it is called
with a Tcl list representing arguments of every command Tcl tried
to execute, but failed because the command name was not defined. You can do
what you like with it, and return a value, or raise an error.
If you just return a value, the command will appear to work even
if unknown to Tcl, and the return value returned by <b>unknown</b>
will be used as return value of the not defined command.
Add this to uplevel and upvar, and the language itself that's almost
syntax free, and what you get is an impressive environment for
Domain Specific Languages development. Tcl has almost no syntax,
like Lisp and FORTH, but there are different ways to have no syntax.
Tcl looks like a configuration file by default:
</p><pre>disable ssl
validUsers jim barbara carmelo
hostname foobar {
    allow from 2:00 to 8:00
}
</pre>
<p>
The above is a valid Tcl program, once you define the commands
used, <b>disable</b>, <b>validUsers</b> and <b>hostname</b>.
</p><h3>Much more</h3>
<p>
Unfortunately there isn't room to show a lot of interesting features:
most Tcl commands just do one single thing well with easy to remember names.
Strings operations, introspection and other features
are implemented as single commands with subcommands, for example
<b>string length</b>, <b>string range</b> and so on. Every part of
the language that gets indexes as argument support an <b>end-num</b>
notation, so for example to take all the elements of a list but
not the first nor the last you just write:
</p><pre>lrange $mylist 1 end-1
</pre>
<p>
And in general there is a lot of good design and optimization
for the common case inside. Moreover the Tcl source code is one
of the best written C programs you'll find, and the quality of
the interpreter is amazing: commercial grade in the best sense of the
word. Another interesting thing about the implementation is that
it works exactly the same in different environments, from Windows
to Unix, to Mac OS X. No quality difference among different
operating systems (yes, <b>including</b> Tk, the main GUI library of Tcl).
</p><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<div><p>
I don't claim everybody should like Tcl. What I claim is that Tcl
is a powerful language and not a Toy, and it's possible to create
a new Tcl-alike language without most of the limitations of Tcl
but with all of its power. I tried this myself, and
the <a href="http://jim.berlios.de/">Jim interpreter</a> is the
result: the code is there and working and can run most Tcl
programs, but then I had no longer time to work for free to
language development, so the project is now more or less abandoned.
Another attempt to develop a Tcl-alike language,
<a href="http://www.hecl.org/">Hecl</a>, is currently
in progress, as a scripting language for Java applications,
where the author (David Welton) exploits the fact that the Tcl core
implementation is small, and the command based design simple to
use as a glue between the two languages (This is not typical with
modern dynamic languages, but both the ideas apply to Scheme too).
I'll be very glad if, after reading this article, you no longer think of Tcl
as a Toy. Thank you. Salvatore.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



<p><strong>2023-10-13:</strong> Edited based on feedback, but preserves
the same content.</p>
<p>This is a little summary of my current thoughts on Rust. I wonder
whether I’ll look back in five years and see if my views have
changed.</p>
<h2 id="the-good">The Good</h2>
<p>So that Gentle Reader knows that I’m not entirely biased against the
language, there are obviously positive things to appreciate about
it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rust’s macros are very good. They act like Lisp’s macros, unlike
Haskell’s.</li>
<li>The fact that Rust has type-classes (“traits”) and sum types
(“enums”) and pattern matching is very attractive. Making orphans
package-wide rather than module-wide is a very good decision.</li>
<li>I like its treatment of records.</li>
<li>Its standard library does a few things well, like handling strings
as UTF-8.</li>
<li>Distinguishing mutability has its advantages, it’s easy to see that
a function is “morally” pure–if not actually pure–and that’s good for
reading.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="unsafe-and-panic">Unsafe and panic</h2>
<p>The use of unsafe is a little disturbing, because many libraries
feature it, and people are tempted to use it on private work projects to
quickly get around the language’s limitations. But it’s not much
different to using an FFI. I don’t see this is a big downside.</p>
<p><code>panic</code> is a little more bothersome, because Rust
libraries go to great pains (with many syntactic tricks like
<code>?</code> and auto-conversions from smaller error types to larger
ones) to handle errors explicitly, but then panics unwind the stack to
the top of the process, and panics inside a panic don’t run destructors,
etc. The overall effect is that, like <a href="https://chrisdone.com/posts/three-questions-of-lang-design/">my
three questions of language design</a>, the answer to “how you handle
errors” is “at least two, incompatible ways.”</p>
<h2 id="take-sugar">Take Sugar?</h2>
<p>Rust’s use of magical sugar constructs, where the compiler will
automatically insert dereferences and copies and drops for you has an
initial appealing “it’s all simple underneath” quality to it, but in
practice this leads to bad compile errors: The worst kind of compile
error is the one where the compiler is complaining about something that
it generated for you, rather than something you explicitly wrote.</p>
<p>This can be compared with Haskell’s use of monads, that provide
syntactic sugar. The more magic you introduce, the harder it is for
newbies to learn and to talk about.</p>
<h2 id="fetishization-of-efficient-memory-representation">Fetishization
of Efficient Memory Representation</h2>
<p>I’ve watched people on calls that are a couple years into Rust spend
20 minutes attempting to understand why their perfectly reasonable code
doesn’t fit into Rust’s tight memory restrictions.</p>
<p>I’ve also been Rust-splained, by people with white in their hair,
with an air of misty-eyed revelation, that once you “get” Rust’s memory
model of the stack and the heap,<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> that things just all fit
together wonderfully. There’s nothing wrong with that, but it’s a
theme.</p>
<p>This touches on another topic I’d like to write about elsewhere: the
difference between practice and theory and how users of languages like
Rust and Haskell that make big promises and require big sacrifices don’t
seem to distinguish the difference. <a href="https://chrisdone.com/posts/reasoning-violently/">It’s not the
technology that’s working poorly, it’s that you’re using it
wrongly.</a></p>
<p>In practice, people just want to be able to write a tree-like type
without having to play Chess against the compiler. I predict that
tracing garbage collectors will become popular in Rust eventually.</p>
<p>This is both Rust’s main goal–be like C, no garbage collection,<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> but safe–and also its main downside.
People waste time on trivialities that will never make a difference.</p>
<h2 id="the-rewrite-fallacy">The Rewrite Fallacy</h2>
<p>I see a lot of “we rewrote X in Rust and it got faster” posts. I
think that if you rewrite anything from scratch with performance in
mind, you’ll see a significant performance improvement. I’m suspicious
of how much Rust itself is needed versus the developers having some
performance discipline.</p>
<h2 id="complexity">Complexity</h2>
<p>Rust has arrived at the complexity of Haskell and C++, each year
requiring more knowledge to keep up with the latest and greatest. Go was
designed as the antidote to this kind of endlessly increasing language
surface area. Endless libraries re-treading existing patterns (web
services, parsers, etc.) in Rust. As a long-term Haskeller, I’ve done
more than 15 years of riding a hamster wheel like that. It is fun for a
while, but at some point I grew tired of it. This aspect of Rust puts me
off. I don’t need another <a href="https://chrisdone.com/posts/tamagotchi-tooling/">tamagotchi</a>.</p>

<p>All new language communities are nice. When things don’t matter much,
people have no reason to get mad.</p>
<p>As soon as people have a stake in something, that’s when things heat
up and tempers come out. You get a stake in a programming language by
writing a lot of code in it, or by building a business on it. When you
have a stake in how a language works, you’re highly sensitive to changes
that will make you do more work than needed, or will limit your
goals.</p>
<p>I’ve seen this play out for Haskell. Around 2007, when I started with
Haskell, the community was friendly as anything, evangelic, open. People
praised it for this. Everyone just felt blessed to be able to use this
exciting language. Today, it’s more like any other community. What
happened? People started using Haskell for real, that’s all.</p>
<p>Rust is going through the same thing, much more rapidly. Is it a
reason to avoid Rust? No.&nbsp;But a “nice” community isn’t a reason to join
an upcoming language, either.</p>
<p>Since I wrote this, people are already trying to <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36122270">fork Rust</a>
because they’re not happy with the governance of it. This doesn’t mean
anything deep other than that people are using Rust now, as stated
above, and the “friendly, welcoming” starts to become mixed with more
diverse moods and motivations.</p>
<h2 id="async-is-highly-problematic">Async is highly problematic</h2>
<p>Rust’s choice to exclude a runtime/scheduler blessed and built-in to
the language means they had to develop alternative strategies in the
language itself. This is not turning out well.</p>
<p><a href="https://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2015/02/01/what-color-is-your-function/">Coloured
Functions</a> is a powerful metaphor for the incompatibility between
async and synchronous functions and the awkward situations that mixing
them introduces. Some blog posts have attempted to downplay the
situation by focusing on technical aspects of specific syntactic forms.
That doesn’t really matter, though, because the reality is much simpler:
Async code is easier to use when dependencies are in an async form.</p>
<p>People will choose libraries that are async over libraries that are
not. However, maintainers that have written good, maintained code, are
also resistant to adopt async.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>One conversation I’ve overhead:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Person 1: Another difference between diesel and sqlx is that diesel
is not async yet and from looking at the issues it doesn’t seem to be
priority yet.</p>
<p>Person 2: That sounds like a major issue</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<p>As the saying goes, the proof of the pudding is in the eating of the
pudding. Async introduces <a href="https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/399">long, heated
discussions.</a></p>
<p>The problem for Rust is that its users want a runtime, but want the
option of not having one. The result is a mess. When combined with
iterators, I think understanding such code is quite difficult.</p>
<p>Generally, I think Go, Erlang and Haskell are the better choice here
for general purpose use. A tracing garbage collector and green threads
make programmers more productive for general purpose programming (not
systems programming). Which brings me to the next section.</p>
<h2 id="as-a-general-purpose-language">As a general purpose
language</h2>
<p>I feel like Rust is self-defined as a “systems” language, but it’s
being used to write web apps and command-line tools and all sorts of
things.</p>
<p>This is a little disappointing, but also predictable: the more
successful your language, the more people will use your language for
things it wasn’t intended for.</p>
<p>This post still offends <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/identity.html">many who have tied Rust
to their identity</a>, but that’s their problem, not mine.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions-if-any">Conclusions, if any</h2>
<p>I won’t be using Rust for any of my own personal projects for the
above stated reasons. But it was used at my job at the time of writing,
so I felt the need to express myself about it.</p>
<p>But I wouldn’t mind using it as a replacement for single-threaded C
if I just use the standard library, that might be fun, although I don’t
do any embedded work, so I wouldn’t hold my breath.</p>
<p>I think that the excellent tooling and dev team for Rust, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ3w_jec1v8">subsidized by Big
Tech</a>, pulls the wool over people’s eyes and convinces them that this
is a good language that is simple and worth investing in. There’s danger
in that type of thinking.</p>

collection” for them means “tracing garbage collector.” Hence bizarre

<p>This is another fairly technical post, and in particular presupposes some enthusiasm for the command line. If that isn’t you, feel free to skip this one!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite being primarily an iOS developer, I use the command line quite a bit - I guess old habits from my time as an embedded software intern die hard.
That said, I like a number of modern command line tools, many written in Rust, which are typically blazing fast and have better command-line interfaces than traditional Unix tools.</p>
<p>If you like this list, you might also like Julia Evan’s <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2022/04/12/a-list-of-new-ish--command-line-tools/">more comprehensive list</a>!</p>
<h2 id="neovim">neovim</h2>
<p>I have a noted love for vim, but when I’m not using an IDE with a vim mode, I’m actually typically using <a href="https://neovim.io/">neovim</a>, alias <code>nvim</code>, which is a modern reimplementation of vim with much less technical debt, a scripting engine based on Lua instead of notoriously-idiosyncratic vimscript, and reasonable defaults like syntax highlighting enabled by default. It also has a full implementation of the <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/">Language Server Protocol</a>, which enables it to have very rich, Visual Studio Code-esque plugins.</p>
<h2 id="fzf">fzf</h2>
<p><img src="https://rwblickhan.org/_astro/fzf-ctrlr.DNEwGTNf_Kl21s.webp" alt="fzf&amp;#x27;s Ctrl-R behavior in action" width="1600" height="729" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf"><code>fzf</code></a> is a command-line fuzzy finder; given some input, <code>fzf</code> lets you search through the input with a fuzzy matching search term. One use I find for this is my custom <code>git</code> alias for a fancy branch switcher, <code>git b</code>, which lets me fuzzy-search for branch names when I want to switch branches.</p>
<p><img src="https://rwblickhan.org/_astro/fzf.Dipf4UqV_woRP7.webp" alt="fzf in action" width="556" height="169" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></p>
<p>It’s also useful on its own! It can helpfully install a replacement for your terminal’s Ctrl+R to fuzzy-search previous commands, as well as a Ctrl+T command to fuzzy-search files in the current directory (although, to be honest, I usually find this option less than effective).</p>
<h2 id="bat">bat</h2>
<p><img src="https://rwblickhan.org/_astro/bat.DtgX936y_2cmkBM.webp" alt="bat in action" width="1108" height="372" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/bat"><code>bat</code></a> is described as a “<code>cat(1)</code> clone with wings”. <code>cat</code> is technically supposed to be for concatenating text, but more often it’s simply used to print a file to the command line. <code>bat</code> leans into that usage by automatically piping large files into a pager, as well as adding syntax highlighting and <code>git</code> integration. I have <code>cat</code> aliased to <code>bat</code>.</p>
<h2 id="exa">exa</h2>
<p><img src="https://rwblickhan.org/_astro/exa.ZHpQ3Ose_Z11HahG.webp" alt="exa in action" width="890" height="60" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></p>
<p><a href="https://the.exa.website/">exa</a> is a modern replacement for <code>ls</code>. Although I do think it has more reasonable defaults than <code>ls</code>, I really only use it for one reason: the <a href="https://the.exa.website/features/colours">pretty colours</a>! I have <code>ls</code> aliased to <code>exa</code>.</p>
<h2 id="rg">rg</h2>
<p><img src="https://rwblickhan.org/_astro/rg.1m6wfl9s_ZuAkTd.webp" alt="rg in action" width="1093" height="120" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep">ripgrep</a>, aka <code>rg</code>, is a grep tool; it allows you to efficiently search the full text of all files in a directory using regular expressions. Admittedly, it’s often more convenient to use a real IDE’s search function, but <code>rg</code> works everywhere and is <em>blazingly</em> fast.</p>
<h2 id="fd">fd</h2>
<p><img src="https://rwblickhan.org/_astro/fd.ih_TKBXW_Z1Mhfco.webp" alt="fd in action" width="491" height="108" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/fd"><code>fd</code></a> is a modern replacement for <code>find</code>. Unlike <code>rg</code>, which searches the full text of files, <code>fd</code> just searches filenames. This is useful in large codebases where you know roughly what a file is named but don’t know what directory it lives in. <code>fd</code> has a more intuitive command-line interface than <code>find</code> and even ignores files in your <code>.gitignore</code> by default! I have <code>find</code> aliased to <code>fd</code>.</p>
<p>Notably, some of this behavior is also provided by <code>fzf</code>, but I usually find <code>fd</code> much more effective in actually finding what I want.</p>
<h2 id="delta">delta</h2>
<p><img src="https://rwblickhan.org/_astro/delta.Htmui8Ik_11SL1S.webp" alt="delta in action" width="1113" height="250" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></p>
<p>Don’t you wish your command-line <code>git diff</code> was as pretty as Github? Well, now it can be! <a href="https://github.com/dandavison/delta"><code>delta</code></a> makes <code>git diff</code> output much prettier, with word-level highlighting, line numbers, and an optional side-by-side mode.</p>
<h2 id="tldr">tldr</h2>
<p><img src="https://rwblickhan.org/_astro/tldr.B6SViaeT_KS4xl.webp" alt="tldr in action" width="557" height="449" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></p>
<p><code>tldr</code> is a utility that provides community-maintained help pages for command-line tools, meant to complement traditional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_page">man pages</a>, which are typically verbose. Instead, <code>tldr</code> provides a quick cheat-sheet for common use cases. I use the <a href="https://github.com/dbrgn/tealdeer">tealdeer</a> implementation of <code>tldr</code>.</p>
<h2 id="zoxide">zoxide</h2>
<p>zoxide is a replacement for <code>cd</code>, inspired by <code>z</code>, that lets you jump around quickly. At a basic level, it can completely emulate the behavior of typical <code>cd</code>. However, you can also give it a fuzzy search term, and it will use a “frecency” algorithm to determine which directory, anywhere on your system, to jump to. I have <code>cd</code> aliased to <code>z</code>, the binary for zoxide.</p>
<p>zoxide also has an interactive mode that uses <code>fzf</code> to fuzzy-find recent directory paths. I have that functionality aliased to <code>cdi</code>, though I haven’t gotten in the habit of using it yet.</p>

<p><a href="https://httpie.io/cli">HTTPie</a> is a recent discovery. I don’t need to use <code>curl</code> very often to make HTTP requests, but when I do, it’s always a bit painful to remember the syntax. HTTPie has a much more obvious command-line interface and also built-in support for making HTTPS requests.</p> </article></div>]]></description>

<p>WordPress.org users are now required to agree that they are not affiliated with website hosting platform WP Engine before logging in. It’s the latest shot fired by WordPress co-creator Matt Mullenweg in his crusade against the website hosting platform.</p><p>The checkbox on the login page for WordPress.org asks users to confirm, “I am not affiliated with WP Engine in any way, financially or otherwise.” Users who don’t check that box can’t log in or register a new account. As of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20241008225626/https://login.wordpress.org/"><u>Tuesday</u></a>, that checkbox didn’t exist.&nbsp;</p><div><p>💡</p><p><b><strong>Are you a current or former Automattic employee or have anything to share about the WordPress versus WP Engine situation? I would love to hear from you. Using a non-work device, you can message me securely on Signal at sam.404. Otherwise, send me an email at sam@404media.co.</strong></b></p></div><p>Since last month, Mullenweg has been publicly accusing WP Engine of misusing the WordPress brand and not contributing enough to the open-source community. WP Engine sent him a cease and desist, and he and his company, Automattic, sent one back. He’s banned WP Engine from using WordPress’ resources, and as of today, some contributors are reporting being kicked out of the community Slack they use for WordPress open-source projects.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://www.404media.co/content/images/2024/10/image.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1039" height="709" srcset="https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w600/2024/10/image.png 600w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w1000/2024/10/image.png 1000w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/2024/10/image.png 1039w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>A screenshot of the WordPress.org login page as it appears on Oct. 9 at 1:50 p.m. EST</span></figcaption></figure><p>Among WordPress community contributors, who keep the open-source project running, this checkbox added to the organization’s site is an inflection point in the story of a legal battle that they’ve been mostly isolated from until today.&nbsp;</p><p>“Right now the WordPress community is in chaos. People don’t know where they stand legally, they are being banned from participating for speaking up, and Matt is promising more ‘surprises’ all week,” one WordPress open-source community member who has contributed to the project for more than 10 years told me. They requested to speak anonymously because they fear retribution from Mullenweg. “The saddest part is that while WordPress is a tool we use in our work, for many of us it is much more than a software. It is a true global community, made up of long-time friends and coworkers who share a love for the open-source project and its ideals. We are all having that very abruptly ripped away from us.”&nbsp;</p><p>In a Slack channel for WordPress community contributors, Mullenweg said on Wednesday that the checkbox is part of a ban on WP Engine from using WordPress.org’s resources. </p><figure><img src="https://www.404media.co/content/images/2024/10/image-1.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="655" height="773" srcset="https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w600/2024/10/image-1.png 600w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/2024/10/image-1.png 655w"><figcaption><span>Screenshot via </span><a href="https://x.com/JavierCasares/status/1843963071183880345?ref=404media.co" rel="noreferrer"><span>@JavierCasares on X</span></a></figcaption></figure><p>Mullenweg explained the ban <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2024/09/wp-engine-banned/?ref=404media.co"><u>in a blog post</u></a> published on the WordPress.org site in September, saying it’s "because of their legal claims and litigation against WordPress.org.” (WP Engine named Automattic and Mullenweg as defendants in its lawsuit, which we'll get to in a moment, but not WordPress.org or the WordPress Foundation.)</p><p>“WP Engine is free to offer their hacked up, bastardized simulacra of WordPress’s GPL code to their customers, and they can experience WordPress as WP Engine envisions it, with them getting all of the profits and providing all of the services,” Mullenweg wrote in the blog. “If you want to experience WordPress, use any other host in the world besides WP Engine.”&nbsp;</p><p>WP Engine is an independent company and platform that hosts sites built on WordPress. WordPress.org is an open-source project, while WordPress.com is the commercial entity owned by Automattic, and which funds development of, and contributes to, the WordPress codebase. Last month, Mullenweg—who also co-founded Automattic—wrote <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2024/09/wp-engine/?ref=404media.co"><u>a post on the organization’s blog</u></a>, calling WP Engine a “cancer to WordPress” and accusing WP Engine of “strip-mining the WordPress ecosystem, giving our users a crappier experience so they can make more money” because the platform disables revision history tracking.</p><p>Mullenweg also criticized WP Engine for not contributing enough to the WordPress open source project, and its use of “WP” in its branding. “Their branding, marketing, advertising, and entire promise to customers is that they’re giving you WordPress, but they’re not. And they’re profiting off of the confusion,” he wrote. “WP Engine needs a trademark license to continue their business.” He also devoted most of <a href="https://youtu.be/fnI-QcVSwMU?si=3v7bDAXpaOaa21eE&amp;ref=404media.co"><u>a WordCamp conference talk</u></a> to his qualms with WP Engine and its investor Silver Lake.</p><p>WP Engine sent Automattic and Mullenweg a cease and desist letter demanding that he “stop making and retract false, harmful and disparaging statements against WP Engine,” the platform posted in September.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Today WP Engine sent what is called a “cease and desist” letter to Automattic demanding that Automattic and its CEO Matt Mullenweg stop making and retract false, harmful and disparaging statements against WP Engine. In response to misinformation he has disseminated about the…</p>— WP Engine (@wpengine) <a href="https://twitter.com/wpengine/status/1838350670564377051?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=404media.co">September 23, 2024</a></blockquote>
</figure><p><a href="https://wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Cease-and-Desist-Letter-to-Automattic-and-Request-to-Preserve-Documents-Sent.pdf?ref=404media.co"><u>The letter</u></a> claimed that Mullenweg “threatened that if WP Engine did not agree to pay Automattic—his for-profit entity—a very large sum of money before his September 20th keynote address at the WordCamp US Convention, he was going to embark on a self-described ‘scorched earth nuclear approach’ toward WP Engine within the WordPress community and beyond.”</p><p>Automattic <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/25/legal-ping-pong-in-the-wordpress-world-continues-automattic-now-sends-wp-engine-a-cease-and-desist-letter-alleging-trademark-infringement/?ref=404media.co"><u>lobbed its own cease and desist</u></a> back. “Your unauthorized use of our Client’s trademarks infringes on their rights and dilutes their famous and well-known marks. Negative reviews and comments regarding WP Engine and its offerings are imputed to our Client, thereby tarnishing our Client’s brands, harming their reputation, and damaging the goodwill our Client has established in its marks,” <a href="https://automattic.com/2024/wp-engine-cease-and-desist.pdf?ref=404media.co"><u>the letter states.</u></a> “Your unauthorized use of our Client’s intellectual property has enabled WP Engine to compete with our Client unfairly, and has led to unjust enrichment and undue profits.”&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://wordpressfoundation.org/trademark-policy/?ref=404media.co"><u>The WordPress Foundation’s Trademark Policy page</u></a> was also changed in late September to specifically name WP Engine. “The abbreviation ‘WP’ is not covered by the WordPress trademarks, but please don’t use it in a way that confuses people,” it now says. “For example, many people think WP Engine is ‘WordPress Engine’ and officially associated with WordPress, which it’s not. They have never once even donated to the WordPress Foundation, despite making billions of revenue on top of WordPress.”</p><p>WP Engine filed a lawsuit against Automattic and Mullenweg earlier this month, accusing them of extortion and abuse of power, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/02/wp-engine-sues-automattic-and-wordpress-co-founder-matt-mullenweg/?ref=404media.co" rel="noreferrer">Techcrunch reported.</a></p><p>Last week, Mullenweg <a href="https://ma.tt/2024/10/alignment?ref=404media.co"><u>announced</u></a> that he’d given Automattic employees a buyout package, and 159 employees, or roughly 8.4 percent of staff, took the offer. “I feel much lighter,” he wrote.</p><p>According to screenshots posted by WordPress project contributors, there’s a heated debate happening in the WordPress community Slack at the moment—between contributors and Mullenweg himself—about the checkbox. </p><p>One contributor wrote that they have a day job as an agency developer, which involves working on sites that might be hosted by WP Engine.&nbsp;“That's as far as my association goes. However, ‘financially or otherwise’ is quite vague and therefore confusing,” they wrote. “For example, people form relationships at events, are former employees, collaborate on a project, contribute to a plugin, or have some other connection that could be considered impactful to whether that checkbox is checked. What's the base level of interaction/association that would mean not checking that box?”&nbsp;</p><p>Mullenweg replied: “It’s up to you whether to check the box or not. I can’t answer that for you.”&nbsp;</p><p>At least two WordPress open-source project contributors—Javier Casares and Andrew Hutchings—posted on X that they’ve been kicked out of the WordPress community Slack after questioning Mullenweg’s actions.</p><figure><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Well, I'm now banned from the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WordPress?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=404media.co">#WordPress</a> community. That is a first for me. I don't think I've ever been banned from an open source community before.<br>For my friends still there, stay safe and I hope you don't get too impacted by the fallout of what is going on.</p>— Andrew Hutchings (@LinuxJedi) <a href="https://twitter.com/LinuxJedi/status/1843966957495939093?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=404media.co">October 9, 2024</a></blockquote>
</figure><figure><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">For anybody who wants to understand why I've been banned from the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WordPress?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=404media.co">#WordPress</a> Slack. <a href="https://t.co/TdA1iQtIPZ?ref=404media.co">pic.twitter.com/TdA1iQtIPZ</a></p>— Javier Casares (@JavierCasares) <a href="https://twitter.com/JavierCasares/status/1843963052183433331?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=404media.co">October 9, 2024</a></blockquote>
</figure><p>“A few of us asked Matt questions on Slack about the new checkbox on the .org login,” Hutchings posted. “I guess we shouldn't have done that.”</p><p>“In today's case, somebody changed the login and disconnected everybody, so, without explanation on the check, if you need to contribute to WordPress and access the website, you need to activate it,” Casares told me in an email. “In my case, this morning, I had to publish a post about a Hosting Team meeting this afternoon.” He had to check the box, he said, because without it he couldn’t access the platform to post it, but the vagueness of the statement concerned him.</p><p>He said the people banned this morning included contributors who have been contributing to the WordPress project for more than 10 years, or people related to other source-code projects.</p><p>“Why? Only Matt knows why he is doing everything he is doing. I really don't know,” Casares&nbsp;said.&nbsp;</p><p>“Matt’s war against WP Engine has been polarizing and upsetting for everyone in WordPress, but most of the WP community has been relatively insulated from any real effects. Putting a loyalty test in the form of a checkmark on the WordPress.org login page has brought the conflict directly to every community member and contributor. Matt is not just forcing everyone to take sides, he is actively telling people to consult attorneys to determine whether or not they should check the box,” the anonymous contributor I spoke to told me. “It is also more than just whether or not you agree to a legally dubious statement to log in. A growing number of active, dedicated community members, many who have no connection with WP Engine, have had their WordPress.org accounts completely disabled with no notice or explanation as to why. No one knows who will be banned next or for what... Whatever Matt’s end goal is, his ‘tactics,’ especially this legally and ethically ambiguous checkbox, are causing a lot of confusion and mental anguish to people around the world.”</p><p>Based on entries to his <a href="https://ma.tt/2024/10/rhino-dehorning/?ref=404media.co"><u>personal blog</u></a> and <a href="https://www.threads.net/@photomatt/post/DA0WWnTsESD?ref=404media.co"><u>social media posts</u></a>, Mullenweg has been on safari in Africa this week. Mullenweg did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="auto">Dito supports custom middlewares, which can be specified in the configuration. Currently available middleware includes:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>auth</code>: Adds authentication logic.</li>
<li><code>rate-limiter</code>: Limits the number of requests per IP using an in-memory approach.</li>
<li><code>rate-limiter-redis</code>: Limits the number of requests per IP using Redis for distributed management.</li>
<li><code>cache</code>: Caches responses using Redis, improving performance for idempotent responses (e.g., GET).</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Redis Integration</h2><a id="user-content-redis-integration" aria-label="Permalink: Redis Integration" href="#redis-integration"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Rate Limiting</h3><a id="user-content-rate-limiting" aria-label="Permalink: Rate Limiting" href="#rate-limiting"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Dito supports distributed rate limiting using Redis. The rate limiter can be configured per location with parameters like <code>requests_per_second</code> and <code>burst</code> to control the request flow.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Caching</h3><a id="user-content-caching" aria-label="Permalink: Caching" href="#caching"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The <code>cache</code> middleware uses Redis to store responses. It helps in reducing load on backends by caching responses for a configurable <code>ttl</code> (time-to-live). The cache can be invalidated based on request headers or specific conditions.</p>

        <p>Last month, the UBL announced that it will deselect an extensive collection of foreign dissertations. We are happy to report now that The Internet Archive will be taking over this collection.</p>
        <div>
<p><span><span>The dissertations were originally part of an exchange programme between (mostly European) universities until the year 2004 but were never catalogued on arrival</span></span><span><span>. </span></span><span><span>As Leiden University Libraries has limited space for growth in its stacks</span></span><span><span>, it decided to deselect these dissertations, so that 3.2 km could be freed up for new acquisitions. The universities where these dissertations originally were defended informed UBL that they still have the dissertations and were not interested in receiving back the Leiden copy. The Internet Archive will now take over this collection from the UBL, and will take care of its future preservation and access. The UBL is pleased that The Internet Archive is able to give this collection of foreign dissertations a second life.</span></span></p>    <!-- Image block 1.0 -->

<h2 id="announcing-deno-2">Announcing Deno 2</h2><p>The web is humanity’s largest software platform — building for it means
potentially&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/home-improvement/internet/internet-statistics" rel="noopener noreferrer">reaching over 5 billion people</a>.
But as
<a href="https://siteefy.com/how-many-websites-are-there/" rel="noopener noreferrer">web development has accelerated in recent years</a>,
it has also become increasingly and unmanageably complex. Before writing a
single line of code, developers must deal with tedious configuration and wading
through unnecessary boilerplate, when they would rather focus on shipping
product and delivering value to users.</p>
<p>Yet
despite&nbsp;<a href="https://deno.com/learn/nodes-complexity-problem" rel="noopener noreferrer">these complexities</a>,
JavaScript, the language of the web,
has&nbsp;<a href="https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-state-of-open-source-and-ai/" rel="noopener noreferrer">remained the most popular language for the past decade</a>,
with TypeScript quickly emerging as number three. This is a testament to
JavaScript’s ubiquity and usefulness for web development — and a sign that
JavaScript is not going anywhere.</p>
<p>In an effort to simplify web programming, we created Deno: a modern, all-in-one,
zero-config toolchain for JavaScript and TypeScript development.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Native TypeScript support</strong></li>
<li><strong>Built on web standards</strong>: Promises, fetch, and ES Modules</li>
<li><strong>Batteries included</strong>: builtin formatter, linter, type checker, test
framework, compile to executable, and more</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.deno.com/runtime/fundamentals/security/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Secure by default</strong></a>,
just like browsers</li>
</ul>
<p>Today, hundreds of thousands of developers love using Deno,
with&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/denoland/deno" rel="noopener noreferrer">repository</a>&nbsp;becoming&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/EvanLi/Github-Ranking/blob/master/Top100/Rust.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">one of the highest starred Rust project on GitHub</a>&nbsp;second
only to the Rust language itself.</p>
<p>While we’ve accomplished a ton in Deno 1, the next major version is focused on
using Deno&nbsp;<em>at scale</em>. This means seamless interoperability with legacy
JavaScript infrastructure and support for a wider range of projects and
development teams. All without sacrificing the simplicity, security, and
“batteries included” nature that Deno users love.</p>
<p><strong>Today, we’re thrilled to announce Deno 2</strong>, which includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Backwards compatibility with Node.js and npm, allowing you to run existing
Node applications seamlessly</li>
<li>Native support for <code>package.json</code> and <code>node_modules</code></li>
<li>Package management with new <code>deno install</code>, <code>deno add</code>, and <code>deno remove</code>
commands</li>
<li>A stabilized standard library</li>
<li>Support for private npm registries</li>
<li>Workspaces and monorepo support</li>
<li>Long Term Support (LTS) releases</li>
<li>JSR: a modern registry for sharing JavaScript libraries across runtimes</li>
</ul>
<p>We are also continually improving many existing Deno features:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>deno fmt</code> can now format HTML, CSS, and YAML</li>
<li><code>deno lint</code> now has Node specific rules and quick fixes</li>
<li><code>deno test</code> now supports running tests written using <code>node:test</code></li>
<li><code>deno task</code> can now run <code>package.json</code> scripts</li>
<li><code>deno doc</code>’s HTML output has improved design and better search</li>
<li><code>deno compile</code> now supports code signing and icons on Windows</li>
<li><code>deno serve</code> can run HTTP servers across multiple cores, in parallel</li>
<li><code>deno init</code> can scaffold now scaffold libraries or servers</li>
<li><code>deno jupyter</code> now supports outputting images, graphs, and HTML</li>
<li><code>deno bench</code> supports critical sections for more precise measurements</li>
<li><code>deno coverage</code> can now output reports in HTML</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="backwards-compatible-forward-thinking">Backwards-compatible, forward-thinking</h2><p>Deno 2 is backwards compatible with Node and npm. This allows you to not only
run Deno in your current Node projects, but also incrementally adopt pieces of
Deno’s all-in-one toolchain. For instance, you can use <code>deno install</code> after you
clone a Node project to install your dependencies at lightning speed or run
<code>deno fmt</code> to format your code without needing Prettier.</p>
<p>Deno 2’s compatibility with Node and npm is robust. Deno 2 understands
<code>package.json</code> , the <code>node_modules</code> folder, and even npm workspaces, allowing
you to run Deno in any Node project using ESM. And if there are minor syntax
adjustments needed, you can fix them with <code>deno lint --fix</code>.</p>
<figure>


</figure>

<p>Don’t like the clutter of <code>package.json</code> and the <code>node_modules</code> directory, but
still need to use that npm package? You can directly import npm packages using
<code>npm:</code> specifiers. Without <code>package.json</code> and the <code>node_modules</code> folder, Deno
will install your package in the global cache. This allows you to write programs
with npm dependencies
<a href="https://deno.com/blog/a-whole-website-in-a-single-js-file" rel="noopener noreferrer">in a single file</a> —

over 2 million npm modules in Deno. This even includes complex packages such as
<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@grpc/grpc-js" rel="noopener noreferrer">gRPC</a>, ssh2, Prisma, temporal.io,
duckdb, polars. Deno even supports advanced features like Node-API native
addons.</p>
<p>Finally, you can use Deno 2 with your favorite JavaScript framework. Deno 2
supports Next.js, Astro, Remix, Angular, SvelteKit, QwikCity and many other
frameworks.</p>

<h2 id="deno-is-now-a-package-manager-with-deno-install">Deno is now a package manager with <code>deno install</code></h2><p>Not only does Deno 2 support <code>package.json</code> and the <code>node_modules</code> folder, it
also comes with three important subcommands that allow you to easily install and
manage your dependencies.</p>
<p><code>deno install</code> installs your dependencies at lightning speed. If you have a
<code>package.json</code> it will create a <code>node_modules</code> folder in the blink of an eye. If
you don’t use <code>package.json</code>, it will cache all of your dependencies to the
global cache.</p>
<p><code>deno install</code> is 15% faster than npm with a cold cache, and 90% faster with a
hot cache. We’re already exceptionally fast here, but expect more improvements,
especially in cold cache scenarios, in the coming weeks.</p>
<p><img src="https://deno.com/blog/v2.0/package-install-timings.png" alt="Package install timings" title=""></p>
<p><code>deno add</code> and <code>deno remove</code> can be used to add and remove packages to/from your
<code>package.json</code> or <code>deno.json</code>. If you’ve used <code>npm install</code> or <code>npm remove</code>
before, these will feel very familiar.</p>

<h2 id="javascript-registry">JavaScript Registry</h2><p><strong>Earlier this year we introduced a
<a href="https://deno.com/blog/jsr_open_beta" rel="noopener noreferrer">modern, open sourced JavaScript registry</a>
called <a href="https://jsr.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer">JSR</a></strong>.</p>
<p>It supports TypeScript natively (you can publish modules as TypeScript source
code), handles the module loading intricacies multiple runtimes and
environments, only allows ESM,
<a href="https://deno.com/blog/document-javascript-package" rel="noopener noreferrer">auto-generates documentation from JSDoc-style comments</a>,
and can be used with npm- and npx-like systems (yes, JSR turns TypeScript into
<code>.js</code> and <code>.d.ts</code> files, as well).</p>
<p>Because you upload TypeScript to JSR, it has an outstanding understanding of the
code that is being published. This allows us to deliver a seamless developer
experience for both publishing and consuming modules. If you are interested in
the details, you can read our post on
<a href="https://deno.com/blog/how-we-built-jsr" rel="noopener noreferrer">how we architected JSR</a>.</p>

<h2 id="the-standard-library-is-now-stable">The Standard Library is now stable</h2><p>While there are over 2 million modules available on npm, the process of
searching, evaluating, and using a new module can be time consuming. That’s why
we’ve been building <strong>the Deno Standard Library</strong> for over 4 years.</p>
<p><strong>The Standard Library consists of dozens of heavily audited utility modules
covering everything from data manipulation, web-related logic,
JavaScript-specific functionalities, and more</strong>. It is
<a href="https://jsr.io/@std" rel="noopener noreferrer">available on JSR</a>, and can be used by other runtimes and
environments.</p>
<p>To give you a sense of what kinds of modules are available in the Deno Standard
Library, here is a partial list of the Standard Library modules and their
equivalent in npm:</p>

<h2 id="private-npm-registries">Private npm registries</h2><p><strong>Private npm registries in Deno 2 work
<a href="https://deno.com/blog/v1.44#support-for-private-npm-registries" rel="noopener noreferrer">the same way they do in Node and npm, with an <code>.npmrc</code> file</a>:</strong></p>
<div><pre>
@mycompany<span>:</span>registry<span>=</span>http<span>:</span><span>/</span><span><span>/</span><span>mycompany.com:8111</span><span>/</span></span>
</pre></div><p>Deno will pick up this <code>.npmrc</code> file automatically, and will let you pull
private packages with no additional configuration.</p>
<h2 id="workspaces-and-monorepos">Workspaces and monorepos</h2><p><strong>Deno 2 also supports workspaces, which is a robust solution to manage
monorepos.</strong> Simply use the <code>workspace</code> attribute in your <code>deno.json</code> to list
the member directories:</p>
<div><pre>
<span>{</span>
  <span>"workspace"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>"./add"</span><span>,</span> <span>"./subtract"</span><span>]</span>
<span>}</span></pre></div><p>These members can have separate dependencies, linter and formatter
configuration, and more.</p>
<p>Not only does Deno support workspaces for Deno packages, it also understands
<a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/using-npm/workspaces" rel="noopener noreferrer">npm workspaces</a>. This means
that you can create a hybrid Deno-npm monorepo
(<a href="https://github.com/dsherret/npm-to-deno-workspace-example" rel="noopener noreferrer">see this example</a>),
with workspace members that either have a package.json or deno.json:</p>
<figure>

<p><img src="https://deno.com/blog/v2.0/monorepo.png" alt="This sample monorepo contains a mix of npm members and Deno members." title=""></p>
<figcaption>This sample monorepo contains a mix of npm members and Deno members.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>You can also publish workspace members to JSR by running <code>deno publish</code>. For an
example, refer to <a href="https://github.com/denoland/std" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Deno Standard Library</a>.
No need to manually figure out in what order you need to publish your packages -
just run <code>deno publish</code>, and it will do it all for you.</p>
<h2 id="lts">LTS</h2><p>Often, development teams in larger organizations need to carefully audit new
releases before using them in production. With Deno’s weekly bug-fix releases,
and 6 weekly minor releases this can become time-consuming. To make it easier
for these teams, <strong>we’re introducing a Long Term Support (LTS) release
channel</strong>.</p>
<p>Starting with Deno 2.1, the LTS channel will receive critical bug fixes
back-ported for six months, ensuring a stable and reliable base for production
use. After six months, a new LTS branch will be created based on the latest
stable version. All LTS releases are freely available and MIT licensed, making
them accessible to any team that needs a more stable and secure environment.</p>
<figure>

<p><img src="https://deno.com/blog/v2.0/lts-schedule.png" alt="Starting with Deno 2.1, we’ll introduce a LTS branch that we’ll maintain and backport critical bug fixes to for six months." title=""></p>
<figcaption>Starting with Deno 2.1, we’ll introduce a LTS branch that we’ll maintain and

<p>Finally, for teams needing advanced support, <strong>we’ve introduced the
<a href="https://deno.com/enterprise" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deno for Enterprise program</a></strong>. It offers priority
support, direct access to our engineers, guaranteed response times, and priority
for your feature requests. We’ve partnered with companies like Netlify, Slack,
and <a href="http://deco.cx/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deco.cx</a> to help their engineers move faster and deliver
more value to their users.</p>
<h2 id="deno-is-fast">Deno is fast!</h2><p>We’ve put tremendous effort into making Deno fast across a wide range of
real-world scenarios. Our focus is on delivering performance improvements that
truly matter in everyday JavaScript and TypeScript development—whether it’s
startup time, handling complex requests, or overall efficiency.</p>
<p>While benchmarks can never tell the full story, they can provide insight into
where a runtime excels. Here are some benchmarks that showcase Deno’s strengths,
demonstrating its ability to deliver top-notch performance for both developers
and production environments.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong>
<a href="https://www.trevorlasn.com/blog/benchmarks-for-node-bun-deno/" rel="noopener noreferrer">The first HTTP benchmark</a>
shown above was conducted using Deno 1.45, not Deno 2.0. In reality, Deno 2.0 is
about 20% slower than indicated here. This difference is due to
<a href="https://github.com/denoland/rusty_v8/pull/1593" rel="noopener noreferrer">our recent disabling of V8 pointer compression</a>
to address cases where users exceeded the 4GB heap limit. We plan to re-enable
pointer compression soon, as it’s the ideal default for most users.
Additionally, we’ll introduce a <code>deno64</code> build for those needing larger heaps.
We apologize for the oversight.</p>
<h2 id="faqs">FAQs</h2><h3 id="if-deno-is-fully-backward-compatible-with-node-why-should-i-use-deno-instead-of-node">If Deno is fully backward compatible with Node, why should I use Deno instead of Node?</h3><p>While Deno can run Node programs, it’s designed to push JavaScript and
TypeScript forward. Deno offers features that Node lacks, such as native
TypeScript support, web-standard APIs, a complete toolchain for JavaScript
development, and a secure-by-default execution model—all in a single executable
with no external dependencies. Using Deno over Node can save you time on setup
and configuration, letting you start coding and delivering value faster.</p>
<h3 id="will-denos-opt-in-permission-system-be-in-effect-when-running-node-programs">Will Deno’s opt-in permission system be in effect when running Node programs?</h3><p>Yes, Deno’s secure-by-default execution model applies when running Node programs
or importing npm modules, ensuring the same level of security.</p>
<h3 id="why-the-new-logo-what-happened-to-the-cute-dinosaur-mascot">Why the new logo? What happened to the cute dinosaur mascot?</h3><p>Since the beginning, the cute sauropod in the rain has been Deno’s face. Its
quirky charm has always been a hallmark of Deno, but the design was never
consistent—there were at least two “official” versions and countless variations.
With Deno 2.0, we decided it was time for a refresh.</p>
<p>We wanted to keep the essence of the original character that Deno users love
while giving it a more refined look to match Deno’s professional and
production-grade nature. During the redesign, we realized that the rainy
background, while nostalgic, didn’t scale well and often went unnoticed. It was
too busy, especially at small sizes, so we had to let it go.</p>
<p>After many iterations, we found that simplifying the design to its core elements
struck the right balance—simple and friendly, yet serious and reliable—just like
Deno.</p>
<p>(Don’t worry, the cute dino is still here!)</p>
<h3 id="deno-began-with-an-ambitious-vision-to-modernize-javascript-but-with-all-the-work-spent-on-backward-compatibility-whats-left-of-denos-original-vision">Deno began with an ambitious vision to modernize JavaScript. But with all the work spent on backward compatibility, what’s left of Deno’s original vision?</h3><p>Rewriting the entire JavaScript ecosystem isn’t practical. As Deno has scaled
beyond small programs, we’ve recognized that supporting Node and npm
compatibility is essential—especially for tools like gRPC and AWS SDKs, which
are impractical to rewrite from scratch.</p>
<p>But Deno’s goal is not to become a Node clone in Rust or a drop-in replacement.
Our aim is to level up JavaScript, moving beyond 2010-era CommonJS and narrowing
the gap between server-side and browser environments in a way that developers
can adopt practically. We refuse to accept that JavaScript must remain a tangle
of mismatched tooling and endless layers of transpilation, unable to evolve.</p>
<p>Deno’s original vision remains central to everything we do. This includes native
TypeScript support, built-in web standards like Promises, top-level await, Wasm,
fetch, and ES Modules, and a batteries-included toolchain—all packaged in a
single, dependency-free executable. And, of course, it is secure by default,
just like the web.</p>
<p>Supporting npm is just one step toward making Deno more versatile. Our mission
is to provide a modern, streamlined toolchain that enhances the JavaScript
experience—not just to support legacy code. While we’ve adjusted our approach,
our vision remains the same: to simplify and empower web development.</p>
<h3 id="i-loved-deno-because-it-didnt-need-any-config-files-but-with-the-new-package-manager-additions-is-deno-2-becoming-more-like-node-where-you-need-a-packagejson-to-add-dependencies">I loved Deno because it didn’t need any config files, but with the new package manager additions, is Deno 2 becoming more like Node, where you need a package.json to add dependencies?</h3><p>Not at all. You can still run single-file programs or scripts without any config
or dependency manifest—nothing has changed there. The new package management
commands (<code>deno install</code>, <code>deno add</code>, and <code>deno remove</code>) are optional tools
designed to simplify managing dependencies, whether you use a <code>deno.json</code> or
<code>package.json</code> file. They’re especially useful for larger, more complex projects
but won’t get in the way if you prefer the simplicity of no configuration.</p>
<p>One of our core goals is that Deno scales down to simple, single-file programs
that can import any package without additional ceremony. For example, in
contexts like Jupyter notebooks or quick scripts, you can easily do:</p>
<div><pre><span>import</span> <span><span>*</span> <span>as</span> <span>Plot</span></span> <span>from</span> <span>"npm:@observablehq/plot"</span><span>;</span></pre></div><p>At the same time, Deno scales up to handle large projects with multiple files or
even multiple packages, such as in monorepos. This flexibility ensures that Deno
is just as effective for small scripts as it is for large, production-grade
applications.</p>
<h3 id="i-have-a-fresh-project-are-there-breaking-changes-if-i-upgrade-to-deno-2">I have a Fresh project. Are there breaking changes if I upgrade to Deno 2?</h3><p>Nope! Your <a href="https://fresh.deno.dev/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fresh</a> project should work out of the box
with Deno 2—no changes needed.</p>
<h3 id="when-should-i-expect-deno-2-to-land-on-deno-deploy">When should I expect Deno 2 to land on Deno Deploy?</h3><p>Any moment now!</p>
<h2 id="whats-next">What’s next</h2><p>Deno 2 takes all of the features developers love about Deno 1.x — zero-config,
all-in-one toolchain for JavaScript and TypeScript development, web standard API
support, secure by default — and makes it fully backwards compatible with Node
and npm (in ESM). This makes not only running Deno in any Node project simple,
but also allows incremental adoption of Deno (e.g. running <code>deno fmt</code> or
<code>deno lint</code> ) possible in larger, more complex projects. Along with improved
package management, JSR, and a slew of features for more advanced development
teams, Deno is ready to simplify and accelerate your development today.</p>
<p>However, given Deno’s vast capabilities, we weren’t able to cover everything in
a single blog post and video. There are many exciting features and use cases
with Deno that we didn’t touch upon. For instance, being able to use
<a href="https://docs.deno.com/runtime/reference/cli/compiler/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>deno compile</code></a> to
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wlZDw942J8" rel="noopener noreferrer">turn a JavaScript game into a desktop executable</a>
with cross compilation (yes, Windows) support. Or Deno’s
<a href="https://docs.deno.com/runtime/reference/cli/jupyter/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jupyter notebook support</a>
that allows you to explore and visualize data in TypeScript and
<a href="https://observablehq.com/plot/" rel="noopener noreferrer">@observable/plot</a>. Or generating documentation
or a static documentation site from your JSDoc comments and source code with

I don’t think the analogy is good.
A 3D sphere is perfectly circular, no matter how you slice it.
Similarly, an n-dimensional hyperball, is perfectly spherical from all perspectives.
It’s ballness just reaches into more hard to grasp dimensions than we’re used to.</p>

Intuitively, a sphere and a cylinder are both 3D extensions of a circle.
There is more volume in the cylinder than the sphere.
With some imprecision, we can thus consider the sphere loosing some volume when a dimension is added, while a cylinder or a box do not.
This <em data-hk="000000010000000000004000b5610">volume loss</em> occurs in every additional dimension.
So instead of considering n-balls to be spiky, it’s the space around them that outgrows them.</p>

<p>As the evil twin of <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-758-allow-except-and-except-expressions-without-parentheses/66453">PEP 758: Allow `except` and `except*` expressions without parentheses</a>, <a href="https://discuss.python.org/u/brettcannon">@brettcannon</a> and me present you <strong>PEP 760: No more bare excepts</strong>.</p>
<p>This PEP proposes disallowing bare <code>except:</code> clauses in Python’s exception-handling syntax. Currently, Python allows catching all exceptions with a bare <code>except:</code> clause, which can lead to overly broad exception handling and mask important errors. This PEP suggests requiring explicit exception types in all except clauses, promoting more precise and intentional error handling.</p>
<p>Please <strong>review the entire document</strong> before commenting as it contains several aspects of how to address the deprecation, tooling, rejected ideas and more.</p>

<p>I know this is off-topic for <em>this</em> thread, but I raised this as an issue with the PEP 760 PR (the PEP itself hasn’t been published yet).  I haven’t had time to look at the response from the PEP authors, but I would really like to preserve bare-<code>except</code> with an unconditional <code>raise</code> use case.  If that can’t be done, I suggested an alias for <code>BaseException</code> called <code>AnyException</code> so at least the modified code would read better:</p>
<pre data-code-wrap="python"><code>try:
    something()
except:
     transaction.abort()
     raise
else:
     transaction.commit()
</code></pre>
<p>would become</p>

<p>Can I ask why? I don’t find that any clearer than <code>except BaseException</code>, and if you are using that pattern I feel you should understand what you’re doing. As such, I don’t think learning what <code>BaseException</code> means is too much to ask.</p>

<p>It’s the comma <em>in the appropriate contex</em>; not every comma makes a tuple, but you can’t syntactically make a tuple without a comma.</p>

<p><code>BaseException</code> exposes the fact that it’s the root class in the exception hierarchy, and you have to connect that mentally to the fact that a) Python requires all exceptions to derive from it, and b) that pattern means “catch any exception”.  The latter just makes that obvious.  It’s obvious to <em>us</em> of course either way.</p>
<p>For me, I’d still prefer to allow a bare <code>except</code> if there’s an explicit empty <code>raise</code> in the body.</p>

<p>It would be nice to not have to use <code>sys</code>. What if we added an option to bind the exception in a <code>finally</code> block, as in:</p>
<pre data-code-wrap="python"><code>try:
    raise Exception("Hello")
finally e:
    if e is not None:
        e.add_note("World")

              <p>+1 to keeping bare <code>except:</code> with <code>raise</code>.<br>
For better or worse, it’s correct, idiomatic code; the “Motivation” reasons don’t really apply to it.<br>
<code>pylint</code> and <code>ruff</code> allow this, and the the style guides their docs link to (PEP-8 and the <a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#24-exceptions">Google style guide</a>) also mention that it’s OK. (<code>flake8</code> does flag it, though, and some of the other guides don’t list the exception.)<br>
And unlike <code>finally e:</code> or implicit raise, the existing syntax is compatible with Python 1.0+.</p>
<p>It would make the implementation harder, though.</p>

<p>Although it’s straightforward the implementation would be quite verbose as this implies doing an entire ast visitor just to detect raises below the bare except (in C).</p>
<p>The task becomes much simpler if we restrict it to detecting raises only at the same level of nesting but that feels somewhat odd.</p>
<p>I think this is an interesting case but you could skip all of this by just doing except BaseException and then all is good.</p>

            <p>This breaks so much existing code. Does the benefit outweigh this? IMHO it’s OK to emit warnings left and right, but outright rejecting bare excepts after just 3 releases of deprecation period seems… not cool. Please, be more conservative with breaking backward compatibility of the basic language. This is not an API of one standard library module, this is the Python language itself.</p>

            <p>I think requiring this is reasonable but I am uncomfortable with the maintenance consequences of having to keep an entire visitor just for restricting this too much. The exception also feels slightly odd to communicate when really we can avoid all of this by just writing <code>except BaseException</code></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p>A relaxation of official rules around the correct use of apostrophes in German has not only irritated grammar sticklers but triggered existential fears around the pervasive influence of English.</p><p>Establishments that feature their owners’ names, with signs like “Rosi’s Bar” or “Kati’s Kiosk” are a common sight around German towns and cities, but strictly speaking they are wrong: unlike English, German does not traditionally use apostrophes to indicate the genitive case or possession. The correct spelling, therefore, would be “Rosis Bar”, “Katis Kiosk”, or, as in the title of a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/29/how-viral-tongue-twister-lightened-up-german-language" data-link-name="in body link">recent viral hit</a>, Barbaras Rhabarberbar.</p><p>However, guidelines issued by the body regulating the use of Standard High German orthography have clarified that the use of the punctuation mark colloquially known as the <em>Deppenapostroph</em><em> </em>(“idiot’s apostrophe”) has become so widespread that it is permissible – as long as it separates the genitive ‘s’ within a proper name.</p><p>The new edition of the Council for German Orthography’s style guide, which prescribes grammar use at schools and public bodies in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/germany" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Germany</a>, Austria and German-speaking Switzerland, lists “Eva’s Blumenladen” (Eva’s Flower Shop) and “Peter’s Taverne” (Peter’s Tavern) as usable alternatives, though “Eva’s Brille” (“Eva’s glasses”) remains incorrect.</p><p>The <em>Deppenapostroph </em>is not to be confused with the English greengrocer’s apostrophe, when an apostrophe before an ‘s’ is mistakenly used to form the plural of a noun (“a kilo of potato’s”).</p><p>The new set of rules came into effect in July, and the council said a loosening of the rules in 1996 meant that “Rosi’s Bar” had strictly speaking not been incorrect for almost three decades. Yet over the past few days, German newspapers and social media networks have seen a pedants’ revolt against the loosening of grammar rules.</p><p>A commentator in the tabloid Bild said seeing signs like “Harald’s Eck” (“Harald’s Corner”) made his “hair stand on end”, and that the proper use of the genitive form would be bemoaned by lovers of the German language.</p><p>A columnist in the venerable broadsheet the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung decried the council’s decision as further proof of the English language’s “victory march”, while one newspaper editor on LinkedIn complained that legalising the “idiot’s apostrophe” amounted to “genuflecting to English”.</p><p>Some linguists question whether the rise of the possessive apostrophe has much to do with the influence of English at all, however.</p><p>“The familiarity of English names may be a factor, but it could just as well stem from a desire to avoid confusion”, said Anatol Stefanowitsch, a linguist at Berlin’s Freie Universität. “What we tend to see when a language interacts with another prestige language is that it incorporates its vocabulary, and not grammar.”</p><figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement"><a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-10">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id="EmailSignup-skip-link-10" tabindex="0" aria-label="after newsletter promotion" role="note">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><p>Even before the rule clarification, the German orthographic council permitted the use of the possessive apostrophe for the sake of clarity, such as “Andrea’s Bar” to make clear that the owner is called Andrea and not Andreas.</p><p>“There is a long tradition of conservative circles fretting about international influences on the German languages,” said Stefanowitsch. “It used to be French, and now it’s mainly English”.</p><p>The Dortmund-based association Verein Deutsche Sprache tries to counteract the influence of English with an “anglicism index” that proposes alternative German words, such as <em>Klapprechner</em><em> </em>instead of “laptop” or <em>Puffmais</em><em> </em>instead of “popcorn”.</p></div></div>]]></description>
