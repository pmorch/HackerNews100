<p><b>Blogger</b> is a blog hosting service. On February 23, 2015, they announced that "sexually explicit" blogs would be restricted from public access in a month. But soon they withdrew their plan, and said they wouldn't change their existing policies.<sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup>  In 2019, Google <a href="https://wiki.archiveteam.org/index.php/Google_Plus_Comments_on_Blogspot" title="Google Plus Comments on Blogspot">removed Google+ comments placed on Blogger blogs</a>. In May 2020, Blogger announced a redesign of their on their <a rel="nofollow" href="https://blogger.googleblog.com/">official blog</a>, and posted <a rel="nofollow" href="https://support.google.com/blogger/thread/71956466">weekly updates on their community support forum</a> in August and September 2020. This redesign covered most of the Blogger experience, but pages related to user profiles, following blogs, cookie management, video management, and classic-style blog widget management still use the old Blogger design. No updates to Blogger have been documented since September 2020. Google has also moved away from Blogger for their own company blogs. For these reasons, Blogger may be at risk of shutting down.
</p><p>In May 2023, Google announced that inactive accounts would be deleted starting on <span title="2023-12-01">2023-12-01</span> across their platform, including Blogger blogs.
</p><p>Archive Team did a discovery between February and May 2015, but did not begin downloading actual content until November 2023.
</p>


<h2><span id="Strategy">Strategy</span></h2>
<p>Find as many <a rel="nofollow" href="http://foobar.blogspot.com/">http://foobar.blogspot.com</a> domains as possible and download them. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://archive.org/details/all_blogger_subdomains">Here is a full list</a> (as of February 2020) and a new list can be generated with <a href="https://wiki.archiveteam.org/index.php/User:Trumad" title="User:Trumad">these instructions</a>. Otherwise, manual discovery can be attempted. Blogs often link to other blogs, which will help, so each individual blog saved will help discover others. Also a small-scale crawl of Blogger profiles (e.g. http://www.blogger.com/profile/{random number up to 35217655}) will provide links to blogs authored by each user (e.g. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.blogger.com/profile/5618947">https://www.blogger.com/profile/5618947</a> links to <a rel="nofollow" href="http://hintergedanke.blogspot.com/">http://hintergedanke.blogspot.com/</a>) - Although note that this does not cover ALL bloggers or ALL blogs, and is merely a starting point for further discovery.
</p><p>Another strategy is to scrape Blogspot sites from Blogger profiles and vice versa (<a rel="nofollow" href="https://transfer.archivete.am/RAiXa/archive-blogspot.sh">example script</a>) and you will get an almost ever-expanding list. There will be captchas to deal with though, so you may need to distribute the scraping. There is <a rel="nofollow" href="https://transfer.archivete.am/XWpXt/blogspot.com-blogs.txt">a list</a> of blogs discovered using this method.
</p>
<h2><span id="How_to_help_if_you_have_lists_of_URLs">How to help if you have lists of URLs</span></h2>
<p>This project requires lists of URLs for content on the target website. If you have a source of URLs, please:
</p>
<ol><li>Use the regular expression <code>\S+\.(blogspot|blogger)\.\S+</code> for filtering.
<ul><li>Note that this regex is intentionally broad to cover many different URL formats. Please do not try to use a more narrow pattern as it may miss valid URLs. We can always filter or transform the results as needed later.</li>
<li>If you use <code>grep</code>, remember to include the <code>-a</code> (aka <code>--text</code> on GNU grep) option to ensure it will continue searching for matches when encountering binary data.</li>
<li>Example command (GNU grep): <code>grep -Pahoi '\S+\.(blogspot|blogger)\.\S+' FILENAME FILENAME...</code></li></ul></li>
<li>If the output exceeds a few megabytes, please compress it, preferably using <code>zstd -10</code>.</li>
<li>Upload the file to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://transfer.archivete.am/">https://transfer.archivete.am/</a>.</li>
<li>Share the resulting URL in the project IRC channel.
<ul><li>If you would like to keep the list non-public instead, e.g. for privacy reasons or for not wanting to be publicly associated with it, please get in touch with a channel op (e.g. <a href="https://wiki.archiveteam.org/index.php/User:Arkiver" title="User:Arkiver">arkiver</a> or <a href="https://wiki.archiveteam.org/index.php/User:JustAnotherArchivist" title="User:JustAnotherArchivist">JustAnotherArchivist</a>). Note that the items generated from your list would still be processed publicly, of course, but they would be mixed with everything else.</li></ul></li></ol>

<h2><span id="Country_Redirect">Country Redirect</span></h2>
<p>Accessing <a rel="nofollow" href="http://whatever.blogspot.com/">http://whatever.blogspot.com</a> used to redirect to a country-specific subdomain depending on your IP address (e.g. whatever.blogspot.co.uk, whatever.blogspot.in, etc) which in some cases may be censored or edited to meet local laws and standards - this can be bypassed by requesting <a rel="nofollow" href="http://whatever.blogspot.com/ncr">http://whatever.blogspot.com/ncr</a> as the root URL.<sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup> <sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> <a rel="nofollow" href="https://blogger.googleblog.com/2018/05/its-spring-cleaning-time-for-blogger.html">As of May 2018, all international Blogger domains now redirect to blogspot.com</a>.

<p>These Wget parameters can download a BlogSpot blog, including comments and any on-site dependencies.

It has only be tested on blogs using a Blogger subdomain (e.g. <a rel="nofollow" href="http://foobar.blogspot.com/">http://foobar.blogspot.com</a>), not custom domains (e.g. <a rel="nofollow" href="http://foobar.com/">http://foobar.com</a>).  Both instances of [URL] should be replaced with the same URL.  A simple Perl wrapper is available <a rel="nofollow" href="http://pastebin.com/2QUuH26L">here</a>.
</p><p><tt>wget --recursive --level=2 --no-clobber --no-parent --page-requisites --continue --convert-links --user-agent="" -e robots=off --reject "*\\?*,*@*" --exclude-directories="/search,/feeds" --referer="[URL]" --wait 1 [URL]</tt>
</p><p><b>UPDATE</b>:
</p><p>Use this improved bash script instead, in order to bypass the adult content confirmation. BLOGURL should be in <code>http://someblog.blogspot.com</code> format.
</p>
<pre>#!/bin/bash

        <p>James Bond films have a certain formula to them. It is more interesting when seen from the perspective of the villain.</p><p>He has long been adjacent to money and power, but craves more. Several years ago, he successfully escaped his low-on-the-ladder job at an existing institution. He built a base of power that is independent of institutions. From it, he successfully puppets any organization he needs to. He and his organization are from elsewhere, everywhere, all at once. They have no passport and fly no flags; these concepts are thoroughly beneath them. They move around frequently and are always where the plot requires them to be, exactly when it requires them to be there. No law constrains them. Governments scarcely exist in their universe. To the limited extent they come to any government’s attention, no effective action is taken. The villain rises to the heights of influence and power.</p><p>This continues <em>for years</em>.</p><p>Then we suddenly hear E minor major 9. We begin the film, telling the end of the story, mostly from Bond’s perspective. The villain is just another weirdo who dies at the climax in act three.</p><h2 id="life-imitates-art">Life imitates art</h2><p><a href="https://x.com/patio11/status/979137571211980800?s=20">For</a> <a href="https://x.com/patio11/status/1337474851938811905?s=20">years</a> I have used the phrase “<a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=from%3Apatio11%20bond%20villain%20compliance%20strategy&amp;src=typed_query" rel="noreferrer">Bond villain compliance strategy</a>” to describe a common practice in the cryptocurrency industry.&nbsp;</p><p>In it, your operation is carefully based Far Away From Here. You are, critically, not like standard offshore finance, with a particular address in a particular country which just happens to be on the high-risk jurisdiction list. You are <em>nowhere</em> because you want to be <em>everywhere</em>. You tell any lie required to any party—government, bank, whatever—to get access to the banking rails and desirable counterparties located in rich countries with functioning governments. You abandon or evolve the lie a few years later after finally being caught in it.</p><p>Your users and counterparties understand it to be a lie the entire time, of course. You bragged about it on your site and explained it to adoring fans at conferences. You created guides to have your CS staff instruct users on how to use a VPN to evade your geofencing. The more clueful among your counterparties, who have competent lawyers and aspirations to continue making money in desirable jurisdictions, will come to describe your behavior as an “open secret” in the industry. They will claim you’ve turned over a new leaf given that the most current version of the lie only merely rhymes with the previous version of the lie.</p><p>And then we begin the third act.</p><p>So anyhow, Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao (known nearly universally as CZ) have recently <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/binance-and-ceo-plead-guilty-federal-charges-4b-resolution">pleaded guilty</a> to operating the world’s largest criminal conspiracy to launder money, paying more than $4 billion in fines. This settles a long-running investigation involving the DOJ, CFTC, FinCEN, and assorted other parts of the U.S. regulatory state. Importantly, it does not resolve the SEC’s <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-101">parallel</a> <a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/litigation/complaints/2023/comp-pr2023-101.pdf">action</a>.</p><p>How’d we get here?</p><h2 id="a-brief-history-of-binance">A brief history of Binance</h2><p>Binance is, for the moment, the world’s largest crypto exchange. Its scale is gobsmacking and places it approximately the 100th largest financial institution in the world by revenue. The primary way it makes money is exacting a rake on cryptocurrency gambling, in particular, leveraged bets using cryptocurrency futures. To maintain its ability to do this, it runs a worldwide money laundering operation with the ongoing, knowing, active participation of many other players in the crypto industry, including Bitfinex/Tether, the Justin Sun empire, and (until recent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/11/02/business/sam-bankman-fried-trial">changes in management</a>) FTX/Alameda.</p><p>In his twenties CZ worked in Japan (<em>waves</em>) and New York for contractors to the Tokyo Stock Exchange then Bloomberg. In about 2013 he got interested in crypto and then joined a few projects, including becoming CTO of OKCoin, another Bond villain exchange. Being a henchman is an odd job, so he decided to promote himself to full-fledged villain. In 2017 he did an <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/10/05/how-binance-turned-its-failed-token-ico-into-a-billion-dollar-windfall/?sh=71b70fce529b">unregistered securities offering</a> (then commonly spelled “ICO”) for Binance.&nbsp;</p><p>Binance rose meteorically from then until recently, essentially gaining share at the expense of waning Bond villains. To <em>oversimplify greatly</em>, it carved up the less-regulated side of the crypto market with FTX, with Binance mostly taking customers in geopolitical adversaries of the U.S. (most notably greater China) and FTX mostly taking them in geopolitical allies (most notably, South Korea, Singapore, and the U.S.). But the cartels did not partition the globe in a way which fully insulated them from each other.</p><p>These operations were intertwined and coordinated. How intertwined? Binance was a part-owner of FTX until SBF decided successfully capturing U.S. regulators was a lot more likely if his cap table named more Californian trees and fewer Bond villains. How coordinated? The name of the Signal chat was <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/rivals-worried-sam-bankman-fried-tried-to-destabilize-crypto-on-eve-of-ftx-collapse-11670597311">Exchange Coordination</a>.</p><p>This eventually led to grief as CZ (mostly accurately) perceived SBF was <a href="https://www.agriculture.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Testimony_Bankman-Fried_0209202211.pdf">using</a> the U.S. government as a weapon against Binance. He retaliated by <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/11/02/divisions-in-sam-bankman-frieds-crypto-empire-blur-on-his-trading-titan-alamedas-balance-sheet/">strategic leaking</a>, leading to a collapse in the value of FTX's exchange token, a run on the bank, and FTX's bankruptcy.</p><h2 id="where-was-binance-in-all-of-this"><em>Where</em> was Binance in all of this?</h2><p>Binance did a heck of a lot of business in Japan in the early years. This <em>officially</em> ended in March 2018 when the Financial Services Agency, Japan’s major financial regulator, made it <a href="https://www.fsa.go.jp/policy/virtual_currency02/Binance_keikokushilyo.pdf">extremely clear</a> that Binance was operating unlawfully in serving Japanese customers without registering in the then-relatively-new framework for virtual currency exchange businesses.</p><p>As an only-sometimes-following-crypto skeptic, this was the thing which brought Binance to my attention. Binance was piqued, saying that they had engaged the FSA in respectful conversations and then learned they were being kicked out of the country from a news report. Having spent roughly twenty years getting good at understanding how Japanese bureaucratic procedures typically work, I <a href="https://x.com/patio11/status/979137571211980800?s=20">surmised</a>&nbsp; “...that is a very plausible outcome if you start your getting-to-know-you chat with ‘Basically I am a James Bond villain.’” I think that was the first time the metaphor came to me.</p><p>The order expelling them listed their place of business as Hong Kong, with a dryly worded asterisk stating that this was taken from their statements on the Internet and “...there exists the possibility that [this information] is not accurate as of the present moment in time.”</p><p>That, Internets, is how a salaryman phrases “I am <em>absolutely</em> aware that you maintain a team and infrastructure in Japan.”</p><p>Did Binance exit Japan? Well, that depends. Did CZ personally return to Japan? Probably not. Does Binance continue to serve Japanese customers? Yes, though (Bond villain!) it pretends not to. Where does Binance’s exchange run as a software artifact? As a statement of engineering fact: in an AWS data center in Tokyo. ap-northeast-1, if you want to get technical.</p><p>&nbsp;(Someone needs to write an East Asian studies paper on how Tokyo became Switzerland for Asian crypto enthusiasts due to a combination of governance, network connectivity, latency, and geopolitical risk. I nominate anyone other than me.)</p><p>Binance also maintained an office in Shanghai, with many executives working there. It was raided by the Chinese police. Binance <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-denies-police-raids-very-existence-of-shanghai-offices"><em>denied</em></a><em> that the office existed</em>. The spokesman’s quote was pure Bond villain: “The Binance team is a global movement consisting of people working in a decentralized manner wherever they are in the world. Binance has no fixed offices in Shanghai or China, so it makes no sense that police raided on any offices and shut them down.”</p><p>This was a lie wrapped around a tiny truth. Internet-distributed workforces containing many mobile professionals do not <em>exactly</em> resemble a single building with all your staff and your nameplate on the door.</p><p><em>Of course, </em>on the actual substantive matter, it was a lie.</p><p>We know it was a lie, because (among many other reasons) we have the chat logs where the parts of their criminal conspiracy that operated in the U.S. complain that the parts of their criminal conspiracy that operated in Shanghai kept information from them that they needed to do their part to keep the crime operating smoothly. Coworkers, man.</p><p>Binance’s Chief Compliance Officer, one Samuel Lim, apparently is not a fan of The Wire and never encountered <a href="https://youtu.be/Ly82nabRRYc?si=51Zj1oyocxvq5t7S&amp;t=75">Stringer Bell’s dictum</a> on the wisdom of keeping notes on a criminal conspiracy. He writes great copy, most memorably “[We are] operating as a fking unlicensed security exchange in the U.S. bro.” He and many other Binance employees have helpfully documented for posterity that their financial operations teams were, for most of corporate history, working from Shanghai.</p><p>Binance also operated in the state of Heisenbergian uncertainty, sometimes known as Malta. Malta has a substantial financial services industry, which <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/finance-crypto-currency-binance/special-report-crypto-giant-binance-kept-weak-money-laundering-checks-even-as-it-promised-tougher-compliance-documents-show-idUSL8N2U065F/">welcomed Binance with open arms</a> in 2018 and then <a href="https://www.mfsa.mt/news-item/public-statement-2020/">pretended not to know him</a> in 2020. This continues Malta’s proud tradition of strategic ambiguity as to whether it is an EU country or rentable skin suit for money launderers. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqgSO8_cRio"><em>¿Por qué no los dos?</em></a> Despite this, Binance would continue claiming to customers and other regulators for a while that it was fully authorized to do business by Malta.</p><p>Binance operates in Russia, to enable its twin businesses of cryptocurrency speculation and facilitating money laundering. In 2023 it <a href="https://www.euronews.com/business/2023/09/28/worlds-largest-crypto-exchange-sells-russian-business#:~:text=Binance%20is%20selling%20its%20Russian,CommEX%2C%20a%20newly%20launched%20exchange.">pretended to sell its Russian operations</a>.</p><p>Binance operated in <em>many</em> jurisdictions. The U.K.: <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/news-stories/consumer-warning-binance-markets-limited-and-binance-group">kicked out</a>. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/crypto-giant-binance-struggles-in-europe-82154b13">France</a>: <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/crypto/binance-probed-by-france-for-alleged-illegal-practices">under investigation</a>. Germany, the Netherlands, etc, etc, they required non-teams of non-employees at non-headquarters to keep track of all the places they weren’t registered doing their non-crimes.</p><p>A core cadre of the Binance executive team is currently in the United Arab Emirates, where CZ hopes to return. He professes that he will await sentencing there, and pinkie swears that he will totally get back on a plane to the U.S. to show up to it. For reasons which are understandable by anyone with more IQ than a plate of jello, the U.S. <a href="https://www.ccn.com/news/binances-cz-considered-flight-risk/">is skeptical</a> he will make good on this promise, and is currently, as of Thanksgiving 2023, <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.328570/gov.uscourts.wawd.328570.34.0.pdf">attempting</a> to keep him in the U.S. He is physically present to sign what Binance advocates believe is the grand compromise to put all his legal worries behind them.</p><p>A defining characteristic of Bond villains is that they think they are very smart and everyone else is very stupid. To be fair, when you play back the movie of the last few years of their life, they keep winning and their adversaries look like nincompoops.</p><p>Then, they get extremely confident and begin to make poor life choices.</p><h2 id="how-did-this-work-for-so-freaking-long">How did this <em>work</em> for so freaking long?</h2><p>Much like the <a href="https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/optimal-amount-of-fraud/">optimal amount of fraud is not zero</a>, the global financial system institutionally tolerates (and <em>actively enables</em>) some shenanigans at the margin. You can think of Binance, Tether, FTX, and all the rest as talented amateurs capable of engaging the services of professionals. They followed advice and grew like a slime mold into the places where shenanigans are wink-and-a-nudge tolerated.</p><p>Why tolerate shenanigans? Some shenanigans are necessary to keep the world spinning.</p><p>China has grown into an economic superpower via capitalism while also at times officially having private property ownership be illegal. That circle cannot be squared. We, the global we, want Chinese people to not live in grinding poverty. That requires economic growth. Economic growth required making things the world wanted. Selling those things required integration into the global economic order. <em>That</em> required a willingness to ignore things the Communist dictatorship said were crimes, while simultaneously saying “Oh, bankers definitely, definitely shouldn’t facilitate billionaires committing crimes.”</p><p>As I’ve remarked previously, we similarly have complicated preferences with regards to Russian oligarchs. In some years, money laundering for them is, how might a gifted speaker phrase this, “[b]ringing our former adversaries, Russia and China, into the international system as open, prosperous and stable nations.” In other years, money laundering for them is described as funding Russia’s war machine.</p><p>Finance is messy because the world is messy.</p><p>Some of the shenanigans aren’t strictly necessary or planned, but society considers an expenditure of effort required to curtail them to be wasteful or to compromise our other goals. We had all the technology required to CC regulators on every banking transaction years before slow database enthusiasts decided all transactions would eventually be publicly readable and persisted forever. We simply chose not to implement it. It would have been quite expensive and infringed on the privacy of many ordinary people and firms.</p><p>But Binance, and others, forgot the critical step, to the annoyance of their engaged professionals: you have to eventually stop growing and keep to a low profile. You have to simply be content with being fantastically rich. If you do, you can continue showing up to the nicest parties in New York, owning expensive real estate in London, and commuting to a comfortable office in Hong Kong or the Bahamas or many other places.</p><p>But crypto kept growing until the control systems could not ignore them any longer. And the control systems cannot continue to avoid knowledge of the crimes.</p><p>So, so many crimes. Many of them are what crypto advocates consider as utterly inconsequential, like serially lying on paperwork. And also Binance gleefully and knowingly banked terrorists and child pornographers. That’s not an allegation; that has been confessed to. There is no line a Bond villain will not cross. They will cross them <em>performatively</em>.</p><p>And, surprising even me, some crypto characters <em>consciously adopt the aesthetic</em> of Bond villains. Le Chiffre, the villain in Casino Royale, owns a fictional house. That house exists in the physical world, where a location scout said “This certainly looks like the sort of place a Bond villain would live.” Jean Chalopin owned that literal, physical house. (c.f. Zeke Faux’s Number go Up, Kindle location 1175.) As <a href="https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/a-review-of-number-go-up-on-crypto-shenanigans/">previously discussed</a>, Chalopin is a professional bagman, and his largest client was previously Tether.</p><h2 id="what-happens-to-binance-now">What happens to Binance now?</h2><p>Some believe that Binance admitting to being a criminal conspiracy is actually good news, not merely in the memetic “good news for Bitcoin” sense, but because this upper-bounds Binance’s exposure somewhere below “The United States forcibly dismantles the most important crypto exchange and much of the infrastructure it touches.”</p><p>The immediate consequences are about $4 billion in fines. Despite being <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/us-attorney-announces-historic-336-billion-cryptocurrency-seizure-and-conviction">one of the world’s largest hodlers</a>, the U.S. will not accept payment in Bitcoin, and Binance has agreed to pay in installments over the next two years. CZ and Binance will be sentenced in February.</p><p>Some people think the grand bargain was to avoid him getting imprisoned. The actual text of the agreement says that Binance gets to walk away from some parts of it if he is sentenced to more than 18 months. (Senior officials <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/21/technology/binance-changpeng-zhao-pleads-guilty.html">told the NYT</a> they are contemplating asking for more than that.)</p><p>Probably more consequentially, the settlements are going to force Binance to install so-called monitors internally. Those monitors are effectively external compliance consultants, working at the expense of Binance in a contractual relationship with them, but whose true customer is the United States. The monitors have pages upon pages of instructions as to exactly how they are to reform Binance’s culture by implementing recommendations to bring onboarding, KYC, and AML processes into compliance with the law everywhere Binance does business, and sure, that is part of the job.</p><p>But the <em>other</em> part of the job is that they’re an internal gateway to any information Binance has ever had, or will ever have. This can be queried essentially at will by law enforcement, with Binance waiving substantially all rights to not cooperate.</p><p>You might reasonably ask “Hey, doesn’t the U.S. typically require a warrant to go nosing about in the business of people who haven’t been accused of a crime?” And, to oversimplify half a century of jurisprudence, one loses one’s presumption of privacy if one brings a business into one’s private affairs. All of Binance’s customers and counterparties gave up their privacy <em>to Binance</em> by transacting with it. The U.S. <em>has Binance’s permission</em> to examine all of Binance’s historical, current, and future records, at will, for at least the next three years. It also secured a promise that Binance would assist in any investigation.</p><p>And so, if one were hypothetically not yet indicted by the U.S., but one had hypothetically done business with one’s now-confessed money launderer, one’s own Fourth Amendment protections do not protect the U.S. from hoovering up every conversation and transaction with Binance.</p><p>All of this is certainly good news and we can put this messy chapter behind us, say crypto advocates.</p><h2 id="how-are-bond-villains-actually-regulated">How are Bond villains actually regulated?</h2><p>Was the Bond villain strategy <em>ever going to work</em>? Did Binance have a reasonable likelihood of prevailing on jurisdictional arguments, like telling the U.S. that the Binance mothership had no U.S. presence and so it should not be subject to U.S. law? No. Crikey, no. The system has to be robust to people lying or acting from less-salubrious jurisdictions, at least to the extent it cares about being effective, and at least some of the time it does actually care about being effective.</p><p>The U.S.’s point of view on the matter, elucidated at length in any indictment for financial crimes, is that if you have ever touched an electronic dollar, that dollar passed through New York, and therefore you’ve consented to the jurisdiction of the United States. Dollarization is <em>very intentionally</em> wielded like a club to accomplish the U.S.’s goals.</p><p>There exist some not-very-sympathetic people one could point to who ran afoul of this over the years who are still much more sympathetic than Binance. Binance intentionally used the U.S. market and infrastructure to make money. The U.S. was essential to their enterprise. Many peer nations can, and will, make a similar argument.</p><p>Binance had tens of percent of their book of business in the U.S. They were absolutely aware of this, knew that some of those users were their largest VIPs or otherwise important, and took steps to maximize for U.S. usage while denying they served Americans.</p><p>Their engineers didn’t accidentally copy the exchange onto AWS or deploy it to Tokyo by misclicking repeatedly. The crypto industry playbook for doing sales and marketing looks like everyone else’s playbook for doing sales and marketing. They get on planes, present at events, send mail, hire employees (or otherwise compensate agents), open offices, etc etc.</p><p>If having an email address meant you didn’t exist in physical reality anymore, the world would be almost empty.</p><p>CZ personally signed for bank accounts for some of his money laundering subsidiaries at U.S. banks, like Merit Peak and Sigma Chain. The SEC <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/binance-ceos-trading-firm-received-11-bln-via-client-deposit-company-sec-says-2023-06-07/">traced</a> more than $500 million through one of those accounts.</p><p>One major rationale for KYC legislation, as <a href="https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/kyc-and-aml-beyond-the-acronyms/">discussed previously</a>, is that it makes prosecuting Bond villains easier. Even if compliance departments at banks are utterly incompetent at detecting Bond villains at signup, having extracted the Bond villain’s signature on account opening documents is very useful to prosecutors a few years down the road. Why have to do hard work quantifying exactly how many engineers work on which days at Binance’s offices in San Francisco when you can do the easy thing and say “Hey, fax me the single piece of paper where the Bond villain signed up for responsibility for all the crimes, please.”</p><p>Why do Bond villains sign for bank accounts in highly regulated jurisdictions? Partly it is because of beneficial ownership KYC requirements to open bank accounts. Partly it is because finding loyal, trustworthy subordinates is very hard if you’re a Bond villain, and Bond villains (sensibly!) worry that if the only name on the paperwork is a henchman, eventually that henchman might say “You know, actually, I would like to withdraw the $500 million I have on deposit with you.”</p><p>(This is why Bond villains frequently have e.g. the mother of their children sign for bank accounts. Bond villains, again, think everyone else is stupid, and that no one will cotton onto this.)</p><p>A subgenre of challenges in people management for Bond villains: you have to hire experienced executives in the United States to run the U.S. fig leaf for your global criminal empire. The people you hire will, by nature, be experienced financial industry veterans who are extremely sophisticated and have access to good lawyers. This combination of attributes is the recipe for being the best in the world at filing whistleblower claims. I expect a few previously executives at Binance U.S. are eventually going to take home the most generous pay packages in the entire financial industry for a few years between 2018 and 2022.</p><p>To make this palatable to the American public, those whistleblower rewards are not courtesy of the taxpayer; they’re courtesy of money seized from previous Bond villains. A portion of Binance’s settlement(s) will go to pay the whistleblowers at <em>the next</em> Bond villain. It’s a circle of life.</p><h2 id="news-that-will-break-shortly">News that will break shortly</h2><p>Different regulators have differing ability to prosecute complex cases, but they basically all have the ability to read simple legal documents. That is one of the things they are best at doing.</p><p>Binance will suffer a wave of tag-along enforcement actions, in the U.S. and globally. Partly this will be for face saving; global peers of the U.S., which Binance has transacted billions of dollars in, will largely not want to signal “Oh we’re totes OK with money laundering for terrorists and child pornographers”, and so they’re going to essentially copy/paste the U.S. enforcement actions. They will then play pick-a-number with Binance’s new management team, who will immediately cave.</p><p>The earliest version of this is probably only weeks away, but Binance will deal with it for years.</p><p>More interestingly, and likely more expensively, the SEC is going to hit Binance like a ton of bricks. They were one of the few regulators which opted out of consolidating with the DOJ’s deal. They think they have Binance dead to rights (they do), and tactically speaking, the deal makes their life even easier. Binance has waived ability to contest some things the SEC will argue. The SEC can now proxy requests for evidence to Binance’s monitors through other federal agencies.</p><p>Binance has had the enthusiastic cooperation of many people who walk in light in addition to their co-conspirators who walk in shadow. Those people, lamentably inclusive of some in the tech industry who I feel a great deal of fellow-feeling for, are going to start cutting off access to Binance. Compliance departments at their corporate overlords, which were either entirely in the dark or willing to be persuaded that a new innovative industry required some amount of flexibility with regards to controls, are (<em>today</em>) having strongly worded conversations which direct people to lose Binance’s number.</p><p>Binance has <em>pre-committed to helping</em> with the efforts to cauterize them from the financial system. They also pre-committed to assisting in, <em>specifically</em>, the investigation of their sale of the Russia business. That investigation will conclude that the sale was a sham (a Bond villain <em>lied</em>?) designed to avoid sanctions enforcement. Ask your friends in national security Washington how well that is going to go over.</p><p>Binance is going to be slowly ground into a very fine paste.</p><p>Many crypto advocates believe the U.S. institutionally wants to see Binance reform into a compliant financial institution. They are delusional. The U.S. is already practicing their lines for the next press conference. This course of action allows them to deflate Binance gradually while minimizing collateral damage, which responsible regulators and law enforcement officials actually do care quite a bit about.</p><p>The U.S. is aware that many high-status institutions and individuals, which are within the U.S.’s circle of trust, actively collaborated with Binance. Most of <em>them</em> will escape serious censure.</p><p>A few examples will be made, especially in cases where it is easy to make an example, because the firm is no longer operating financial infrastructure. This will take ages to happen and be public but relatively quiet, insofar as senior U.S. regulators will not get on TV to make international headlines announcing it. It will be one of the stories quietly dribbled out on a Friday to the notice mostly of people who draft Powerpoint decks for Compliance presentations. If you want a flavor for these, join any financial firm and pay attention during the annual training; you’re stuck going to it, anyway.</p><h2 id="you-seem-a-little-smug-patrick">You seem a little smug, Patrick</h2><p>I’m not breaking out the Strategic Popcorn Reserves yet, but I will admit to a certain amount of schadenfreude here. The world was grossly disordered for many years. It has corrected <em>a relatively small amount</em>.</p><p>We are a nation of laws. I’d support reforming some of them; a lot of the AML/KYC regulatory apparatus harms individuals who have done no wrong. Much is not well-calibrated in terms of societal costs versus occasionally facilitating a Bond villain’s self-immolation.</p><p>However, in the interim, one cannot simply gleefully ignore the laws because the opportunity to do so allows you to become wealthy beyond the dreams of avarice. Even <a href="https://x.com/nic__carter/status/1727090868908396745?s=20">staunch crypto advocates</a> looking at Binance’s conduct see some things they are not happy to be associated with. Not all of the crimes were victimless crimes.</p><p>There exists the possibility that there is some salvageable licit business in crypto. People enjoy gambling. But if you factor out the crime, the largest casino in the world is not that interesting a business relative to the one that Binance et al ran the last few years.</p><p>I do not know if we’ll ever have a world with this scale of crypto businesses without the crime. The crime <em>was the product</em>. An opportunity to transform global financial infrastructure was greatly overstated and <em>has not</em> come to pass. I do not expect this to change.</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Version support</h2>
<p dir="auto">I always try to add support for the newest version of minecraft. Mostly it is pretty easy, just declaring it and generate all data. After pushing it, it is supported. Some versions are more complicated and need a bit of coding. I always try it as fast as possible, but sometimes I just need time.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Supported versions</h3>
<p dir="auto">Almost all versions (and snapshots!) between 1.7 and the latest one (1.20.2 as of writing this) are supported.<br>
I plan to maintain Minosoft to at least version 1.20, so stay tuned, and support for older protocols will not be dropped as newer protocols are added. It is still recommended using the latest stable version.<br>
See <a href="https://gitlab.bixilon.de/Bixilon/Minosoft/blob/master/doc/VersionSupport.md">Version support</a> for more details.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Modding</h2>
<p dir="auto">Works, still missing some features to make modding super easy (see e.g. <a href="https://gitlab.bixilon.de/bixilon/minosoft/-/issues/12" rel="nofollow">#12</a>)</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Botting</h3>
<p dir="auto">Will be improved in the future.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Contribution or helping out</h2>
<p dir="auto">Please do it. I am completely busy with the development. Grab pretty much whatever you want and start developing.

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Releases and beta</h2>
<p dir="auto">No clue. Don't wait for it :)</p>
<p dir="auto">I invested many thousands of hours in this project to make it "work". A lot of vanillas features are actually implemented, but soo much is missing.
A release normally means, that it is stable, has few (known) bugs and won't change that much in the near future.
All those "requirements" are currently not fulfilled at all. It is just way to alpha atm. The current goal always was to play bedwars with this client and it actually worked on hypixel (<a href="https://gitlab.bixilon.de/bixilon/minosoft/-/issues/42" rel="nofollow">#42</a>).</p>

                <ul> 
 <li>Until today, dry stone wall construction has involved vast amounts of manual labour.</li> 
 <li>A multidisciplinary team of ETH Zurich researchers developed a method of using an autonomous excavator to construct a dry-stone wall that is six metres high and sixty-five metres long.</li> 
 <li>Dry stone walls are resource efficient as they use locally sourced materials, such as concrete slabs that are low in embodied energy.</li> 
</ul>
            </div>
<div>
                
                
                <p>ETH Zurich researchers deployed an autonomous excavator, called HEAP, to build a six metre-high and sixty-five-metre-long dry-stone wall. The wall is embedded in a digitally planned and autonomously excavated landscape and park.</p>
<p>The team of researchers included: Gramazio Kohler Research, the Robotics Systems Lab, Vision for Robotics Lab, and the Chair of Landscape Architecture. They developed this innovative design application as part of the National Centre of Competence in Research for Digital Fabrication (NCCR dfab).</p>
<p>Using sensors, the excavator can autonomously draw a 3D map of the construction site and localise existing building blocks and stones for the wall’s construction. Specifically designed tools and machine vision approaches enable the excavator to scan and grab large stones in its immediate environment. It can also register their approximate weight as well as their centre of gravity. An algorithm determines the best position for each stone, and the excavator then conducts the task itself by placing the stones in the desired location. The autonomous machine can place 20 to 30 stones in a single consignment – about as many as one delivery could supply.</p>

            <article itemprop="text"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">BOTLIB - Telegram C bot framework</h2>
<p dir="auto">WARNING: API is work in progress. Don't consider it reliable until this message is removed.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Installation</h2>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Create your bot using the Telegram <a href="https://t.me/botfather" rel="nofollow">@BotFather</a>.</li>
<li>After obtaining your bot API key, store it into a file called <code>apikey.txt</code> inside the bot working directory. Alternatively you can use the <code>--apikey</code> command line argument to provide your Telegram API key.</li>
<li>Optionally edit <code>mybot.c</code> to personalized the bot.</li>
<li>Build the bot: you need libcurl and libsqlite installed. Just type <code>make</code>.</li>
<li>Run with <code>./mybot</code>. There is also a debug mode if you run it using the <code>--debug</code> option (add --debug multiple times for even more verbose messages). For a more moderate output use <code>--verbose</code>. Try <code>mybot --help</code> for the full list of command line options.</li>
<li>Add the bot to your Telegram channel.</li>
<li><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> The bot <em>must</em> be an administrator of the channel in order to read all the messages that are sent in such channel. Private messages will work regardless.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">By default the bot will create an SQLite database in the working directory.
If you want to specify another path for your SQLite db, use the <code>--dbfile</code>
command line option.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">APIs</h2>
<p dir="auto">... Work in progress ...</p>
<p dir="auto">For the bot API check <code>mybot.c</code> example itself. The basic usage is pretty simple. However for all the other stuff, like the Sqlite3 abstractions, they are taken from <a href="https://github.com/antirez/stonky">Stonky</a>, so the code there (which is very accessible) will provide some help. I hope to document this project better. For now my main goal was to stop duplicating Stonly to create new bots with all the common code inside.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  
  <h2 id="i">I.</h2>

<p>My dad emigrated from Colombia to North America when he was 18 looking looking for a better life. For my brother and I that meant a lot of standing outside in the cold. My dad’s preferred method of improving his lot was improving lots, and my brother and I were “voluntarily” recruited to help working on the buildings we owned.</p>

<p>That’s how I came to spend a substantial part of my teenage years replacing fences, digging trenches, and building flooring and sheds. And if there’s one thing I’ve learned from all this building, it’s that reality has a surprising amount of detail.</p>

<p>This turns out to explain why its so easy for people to end up intellectually stuck. Even when they’re literally the best in the world in their field.</p>

<p>Consider building some basement stairs for a moment. Stairs seem pretty simple at first, and at a high level they are simple, just two long, wide parallel boards (2” x 12” x 16’), some boards for the stairs and an angle bracket on each side to hold up each stair. But as you actually start building you’ll find there’s a surprising amount of nuance.</p>

<p>The first thing you’ll notice is that there are actually quite a few subtasks. Even at a high level, you have to cut both ends of the 2x12s at the correct angles; then screw in some u-brackets to the main floor to hold the stairs in place; then screw in the 2x12s into the u-brackets; then attach the angle brackets for the stairs; then screw in the stairs.</p>

<table>
<caption>Those goddamn stairs.</caption>
<tbody><tr><td><img src="http://johnsalvatier.org/assets/stairs-diagram.jpg" alt="Those goddamn stairs."></td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>Next you’ll notice that each of those steps above decomposes into several steps, some of which have some tricky details to them due to the properties of the materials and task and the limitations of yourself and your tools.</p>

<p>The first problem you’ll encounter is that cutting your 2x12s to the right angle is a bit complicated because there’s no obvious way to trace the correct angles. You can either get creative (there <em>is</em> a way to  trace it), or you can bust out your trig book and figure out how to calculate the angle and position of the cuts.</p>

<p>You’ll probably also want to look up what are reasonable angles for stairs. What looks reasonable when you’re cutting and what feels safe can be different. Also, you’re probably going to want to attach a guide for your circular saw when cutting the angle on the 2x12s because the cut has to be pretty straight.</p>

<p>When you’re ready to you will quickly find that getting the stair boards at all the same angle is non-trivial. You’re going to need something that can give you an angle to the main board very consistently. Once you have that, and you’ve drawn your lines, you may be dismayed to discover that your straight looking board is not <em>that</em> straight. Lumber warps after it’s made because it was cut when it was new and wet and now it’s dryer, so no lumber is perfectly straight.</p>

<p>Once you’ve gone back to the lumber store and gotten some straighter 2x12s and redrawn your lines, you can start screwing in your brackets. Now you’ll learn that despite <em>starting</em> aligned with the lines you drew, after screwing them in, your angle brackets are no longer quite straight because the screws didn’t go in quite straight and now they tightly secure the bracket at the wrong angle. You can fix that by drilling guide holes first. Also you’ll have to move them an inch or so because it’s more or less impossible to get a screw to go in differently than it did the first time in the same hole.</p>

<p>Now you’re finally ready to screw in the stair boards. If your screws are longer than 2”, you’ll need different ones, otherwise they will poke out the top of the board and stab you in the foot.</p>

<p>At every step and every level there’s an abundance of detail with material consequences.</p>

<p>It’s tempting to think ‘So what?’ and dismiss these details as incidental or specific to stair carpentry. And they <strong>are</strong> specific to stair carpentry; that’s what makes them details. But the existence of a surprising number of meaningful details is <em>not</em> specific to stairs. Surprising detail is a near universal property of getting up close and personal with reality.</p>

<p>You can see this everywhere if you look. For example, you’ve probably had the experience of doing something for the first time, maybe growing vegetables or using a Haskell package for the first time, and being frustrated by how many annoying snags there were. Then you got more practice and then you told yourself ‘man, it was so simple all along, I don’t know why I had so much trouble’. We run into a fundamental property of the universe and mistake it for a personal failing.</p>

<p>If you’re a programmer, you might think that the fiddliness of programming is a special feature of programming, but really it’s that everything is fiddly, but you only notice the fiddliness when you’re new, and in programming you do new things more often.</p>

<p>You might think the fiddly detailiness of things is limited to human centric domains, and that physics itself is simple and elegant. That’s true in some sense – the physical laws themselves tend to be quite simple – but the manifestation of those laws is often complex and counterintuitive.</p>

<h2 id="ii-boiling-a-watched-pot">II. Boiling A Watched Pot</h2>

<p>Consider the boiling of water. That’s straightforward, water boils at 100 °C, right?</p>

<p>Well the stairs seemed simple too, so let’s double check.</p>

<p>Put yourself in the shoes of someone at the start of the 1800’s, with only a crude, unmarked mercury thermometer, trying to figure the physics of temperature.</p>

<p>Go to your stove, put some water in a pot, start heating some water, and pay attention as it heats.</p>

<p><em>(I suggest actually doing this)</em></p>

<p>The first thing you’ll probably notice is a lot of small bubbles gathering on the surface of the pot. Is that boiling? The water’s not that hot yet; you can still even stick your finger in. Then the bubbles will appear faster and start rising, but they somehow seem ‘unboiling’. Then you’ll start to see little bubble storms in patches, and you start to hear a hissing noise. Is that Boiling? Sort of? It doesn’t really <em>look</em> like boiling. The bubble storms grow larger and start releasing bigger bubbles. Eventually the bubbles get big and the surface of the water grows turbulent as the bubbles begin to make it to the surface. Finally we seem to have reached real boiling. I guess this is the boiling point? That seems kind of weird, what were the things that happened earlier if not boiling.</p>

<p>To make matters worse, if you’d used a glass pot instead of a metal one, the water would boil at a higher temperature. If you cleaned the glass vessel with sulfuric acid, to remove any residue, you’d find that you can heat water substantially more before it boils and when it does boil it boils in little explosions of boiling and the temperature fluctuates unstably.</p>

<p>Worse still, if you trap a drop of water between two other liquids and heat it, you can raise the temperature to at least 300 °C with nothing happening. That kind of makes a mockery of the statement ‘water boils at 100 °C’.</p>

<p>It turns out that ‘boiling’ is a lot more complicated than you thought.</p>

<p>This surprising amount of detail is is not limited to “human” or “complicated” domains, it is a near universal property of everything from space travel to sewing, to your internal experience of your own mind.</p>

<h2 id="iii-invisible-vs-transparent-detail-and-getting-intellectually-stuck">III. Invisible vs. Transparent Detail And Getting Intellectually Stuck</h2>

<p>Again, you might think ‘So what? I guess things are complicated but I can just notice the details as I run into them; no need to think specifically about this’. And if you are doing things that are relatively simple, things that humanity has been doing for a long time, this is often true. But if you’re trying to do difficult things, things which are not known to be possible, it is not true.</p>

<p>The more difficult your mission, the more details there will be that are critical to understand for success.</p>

<p>You might hope that these surprising details are irrelevant to your mission, but not so. Some of them will end up being key. Wood’s tendency to warp means it’s more accurate to trace a cut than to calculate its length and angle. The possibility of superheating liquids means it’s important to use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packed_bed">packed bed</a> when boiling liquids in industrial processes lest your process be highly inefficient and unpredictable. The massive difference in weight between a rocket <em>full</em> of fuel and an empty one means that a reusable rocket can’t hover if it can’t throttle down to a very small fraction of its original thrust, which in turn means it must plan its trajectory very precisely to achieve 0 velocity at exactly the moment it reaches the ground.</p>

<table>
<caption>Some important details for colonizing the universe.</caption>
<tbody><tr><td><img src="http://johnsalvatier.org/assets/colonizing-the-universe.png" alt="Some important details for colonizing the universe."></td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>You might also hope that the important details will be obvious when you run into them, but not so. Such details aren’t <em>automatically</em> visible, even when you’re directly running up against them. Things can just seem messy and noisy instead. ‘Spirit’ thermometers, made using brandy and other liquors, were in common use in the early days of thermometry. They were even considered as a potential standard fluid for thermometers. It wasn’t until the careful work of Swiss physicist Jean-André De Luc in the 18th century that physicists realized that alcohol thermometers are highly nonlinear and highly variable depending on concentration, which is in turn hard to measure.</p>

<p>You’ve probably also had experiences where you were trying to do something and growing increasingly frustrated because it wasn’t working, and then finally, after some time you realize that your solution method can’t possibly work.</p>

<p>Another way to see that noticing the right details is hard, is that different people end up noticing <em>different</em> details. My brother and I once built a set of stairs for the garage with my dad, and we ran into the problem of determining where to cut the long boards so they lie at the correct angle. After struggling with the problem for a while (and I do mean struggling, a 16’ long board is heavy), we got to arguing. I remembered from trig that we could figure out angle so I wanted to go dig up my textbook and think about it. My dad said, ‘no, no, no, let’s just trace it’, insisting that we could figure out how to do it.</p>

<p>I kept arguing because I thought I was right. I felt really annoyed with him and he was annoyed with me. In retrospect, I think I saw the fundamental difficulty in what we were doing and I don’t think he appreciated it (look at the stairs picture and see if you can figure it out), he just heard ‘let’s draw some diagrams and compute the angle’ and didn’t think that was the solution, and if he had appreciated the thing that I saw I think he would have been more open to drawing some diagrams. But at the same time, he also understood that diagrams and math don’t account for the shape of the wood, which I did not appreciate. If we had been able to get these points across, we could have come to consensus. Drawing a diagram was probably a good idea, but computing the angle was probably not. Instead we stayed annoyed at each other for the next 3 hours.</p>

<p>Before you’ve noticed important details they are, of course, basically invisible. It’s hard to put your attention on them because you don’t even know what you’re looking for. But <em>after</em> you see them they quickly become so integrated into your intuitive models of the world that they become essentially transparent. Do you remember the insights that were crucial in learning to ride a bike or drive? How about the details and insights you have that led you to be good at the things you’re good at?</p>

<p>This means it’s really easy to get <em>stuck</em>. Stuck in your current way of seeing and thinking about things. Frames are made out of the details that seem important to you. The important details you haven’t noticed are invisible to you, and the details you <em>have</em> noticed seem completely obvious and you see right through them. This all makes makes it difficult to imagine how you could be missing something important.</p>

<p>That’s why if you ask an anti-climate change person (or a climate scientist) “what could convince you you were wrong?” you’ll likely get back an answer like “if it turned out all the data on my side was faked” or some other extremely strong requirement for evidence rather than “I would start doubting if I noticed numerous important mistakes in the details my side’s data and my colleagues didn’t want to talk about it”. The second case is much more likely than the first, but you’ll never see it if you’re not paying close attention.</p>

<p>If you’re trying to do impossible things, this effect should <em>chill you to your bones</em>. It means you could be intellectually stuck right at this very moment, with the evidence right in front of your face and you just can’t see it.</p>

<p>This problem is not easy to fix, but it’s not impossible either. I’ve mostly fixed it for myself. The direction for improvement is clear: seek detail you would not normally notice about the world. When you go for a walk, notice the unexpected detail in a flower or what the seams in the road imply about how the road was built. When you talk to someone who is smart but just seems <em>so wrong</em>, figure out what details seem important to them and why. In your work, notice how that meeting actually wouldn’t have accomplished much if Sarah hadn’t pointed out that one thing. As you learn, notice which details actually change how you think.</p>

<p>If you wish to not get stuck, seek to perceive what you have not yet perceived.</p>

Or should Italy move west to attack France, while CICERO works with Turkey to battle Russia?</span></p><p><span>CICERO suggests that either move is possible, but the current circumstances create an opportunity for Italy to move decisively against Turkey. With this move, Turkey would get trapped on all sides due to a move called the “lepanto” which would involve Italy convoying an army into Turkish territories.</span></p><p><span>This is great for CICERO, because it commits Italy into a clear partnership from which both stand to gain. It would also hopefully keep Italy from being tempted to attack CICERO instead.</span></p></div><div id="u_0_4t_Ee"><p><span>France and CICERO (as Germany) have been at war, but France is starting to get pressured by Italy on their southern border. France comes to CICERO asking for a deal to negotiate peace so that they can turn their focus the other way.</span></p><p><span>CICERO proposes a path forward: France needs to surrender a stolen territory (Munich) while agreeing not to attack the weakly defended Holland. England has almost fallen to pressure from the two of them, so France agrees on one condition — that it can have the supply centers at Liverpool and London, while CICERO can take the one in Edinburgh. CICERO agrees to the counter-offer and France commits to the agreement.</span></p></div><div id="u_0_4u_TU"><p><span>CICERO (as Austria) had convinced Italy to work with it against Turkey. Those plans were interrupted by France building units that could be used to attack Italy, causing Italy to form a defensive line against France, instead of making an offensive move east against Turkey. Fortunately for Italy, France did not advance those units, so now it’s time to organize the march east.</span></p><p><span>CICERO first suggests moving from Venice to Piedmont to help keep France at bay if they decide to attack this turn, despite last turn’s neutrality. This move would also keep Austrian territories safer since the Italian army in Venice could move directly into an Austrian center in Trieste.</span></p><p><span>Then, Italy suggests a move that would help CICERO move against Turkey but would potentially make CICERO more vulnerable if Italy decided to turn on CICERO. CICERO instead asks Italy to make a move that commits Italy more deeply to the alliance while also keeping Austrian territories less exposed to Italian units. To CICERO’s benefit, Italy agrees.</span></p></div></div></div><div><div id="u_0_4v_Mo"><div><p><img src="https://scontent.fzrh3-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/312021767_845517533298583_3658367999041885691_n.png?_nc_cat=110&amp;ccb=1-7&amp;_nc_sid=e280be&amp;_nc_ohc=icxBgSwfAF4AX_6jIOU&amp;_nc_ht=scontent.fzrh3-1.fna&amp;oh=00_AfDMWmDnNx4GK5i2XOMcxCkpbZ2SBV7E1uJohoJZdcCuNw&amp;oe=657B6B3A" alt=""></p><h4> CICERO AS AUSTRIA </h4></div><div><div id="u_0_4w_KX"><p><b>Italy:</b> What are you thinking longterm?

I pulled it forward for timeliness, as RLAIF and process reward models were on my hit list anyway. We’ll see if there are more</em><span> </span><em>emergency posts.</em></p><p><span>On Wednesday, right when we were all ready to sign off for Thanksgiving,&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/sam-altmans-ouster-openai-was-precipitated-by-letter-board-about-ai-breakthrough-2023-11-22/" rel="">Reuters reported on OpenAI one last time</a><span>, revealing just the name and high-level evaluations of a new OpenAI method, Q*, touted with vague powerful capabilities:</span></p><blockquote><p>After being contacted by Reuters, OpenAI, which declined to comment, acknowledged in an internal message to staffers a project called Q*…</p><p>Some at OpenAI believe Q* (pronounced Q-Star) could be a breakthrough in the startup's search for what's known as artificial general intelligence (AGI), one of the people told Reuters. OpenAI defines AGI as autonomous systems that surpass humans in most economically valuable tasks.</p><p>Given vast computing resources, the new model was able to solve certain mathematical problems, the person said on condition of anonymity because the individual was not authorized to speak on behalf of the company. Though only performing math on the level of grade-school students, acing such tests made researchers very optimistic about Q*’s future success, the source said.</p></blockquote><p><span>Such extensive speculation has never unfolded from only the name of a method. Though, the name is pretty simple in this case, and&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-dropped-work-on-new-arrakis-ai-model-in-rare-setback" rel="">not just another codename from the Dune universe</a><span>. Q* (Q-Star), if real, clearly links two core themes from the RL literature: Q-values and </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm" rel="">A*</a><em>, a classic graph search algorithm. Yes, there’s an argument that Q</em><span>&nbsp;could just refer to the value function of the optimal policy, but this would need to be a fabricated leak for it to be so silly, and OpenAI has pretty much had everything leaked, so fabricating them seems unlikely.</span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1-139117155" href="https://www.interconnects.ai/p/q-star?r=68gy5&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web#footnote-1-139117155" target="_self" rel="">1</a></p><p>My initial hypothesis, which I clearly labeled as a tin hat theory, was a vague merging of Q-learning and A* search. What I didn’t answer is, what is being searched over? My initial guess of searching over dialogue turns is almost certainly wrong due to infrastructure reasons I’ll touch on later.</p><p><span>As I’ve dug into this in more detail, I’ve become convinced that they are doing something powerful by </span><strong>searching over language/reasoning steps via tree-of-thoughts reasoning</strong><span>, but it is much smaller of a leap than people believe. The reason for the hyperbole is the goal of linking large language model training and usage to the core components of Deep RL that enabled success like AlphaGo: self-play and look-ahead planning.</span></p><ul><li><p><strong>Self-play</strong><span> is the idea that an agent can improve its gameplay by playing against slightly different versions of itself because it’ll progressively encounter more challenging situations. In the space of LLMs, it is almost certain that the largest portion of self-play will look like AI Feedback rather than competitive processes.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Look-ahead planning</strong><span> is the idea of using a model of the world to reason into the future and produce better actions or outputs. The two variants are based on&nbsp;</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_predictive_control#:~:text=Model%20predictive%20control%20(MPC)%20is,oil%20refineries%20since%20the%201980s." rel="">Model Predictive Control</a><span>&nbsp;(MPC), which is often used on continuous states, and&nbsp;</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_tree_search" rel="">Monte-Carlo Tree Search</a><span>&nbsp;(MCTS), which works with discrete actions and states.</span></p></li></ul><p>To understand how this links together, we need to cover recent results published from OpenAI and others that’ll answer two questions:</p><ol><li><p>How do we construct a representation of language that we can search over?</p></li><li><p>How do we construct a notion of value over compartmentalized and meaningful language chunks (rather than the entire completion)?</p></li></ol><p>With answers to these, it should be clear how we could use existing RL methods that are used for RLHF. We use an RL optimizer to fine-tune the language model and get higher-quality generations with modular rewards (rather than the full sequence, as is done today).</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F77dd8242-6d53-4f2c-a401-243aa58019e3_1820x1024.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F77dd8242-6d53-4f2c-a401-243aa58019e3_1820x1024.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F77dd8242-6d53-4f2c-a401-243aa58019e3_1820x1024.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F77dd8242-6d53-4f2c-a401-243aa58019e3_1820x1024.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F77dd8242-6d53-4f2c-a401-243aa58019e3_1820x1024.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F77dd8242-6d53-4f2c-a401-243aa58019e3_1820x1024.jpeg" width="1456" height="819" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/77dd8242-6d53-4f2c-a401-243aa58019e3_1820x1024.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:819,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Runway 2023-11-23T16\\_55\\_51.562Z Expand Image.jpeg&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="Runway 2023-11-23T16\_55\_51.562Z Expand Image.jpeg" title="Runway 2023-11-23T16\_55\_51.562Z Expand Image.jpeg" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F77dd8242-6d53-4f2c-a401-243aa58019e3_1820x1024.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F77dd8242-6d53-4f2c-a401-243aa58019e3_1820x1024.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F77dd8242-6d53-4f2c-a401-243aa58019e3_1820x1024.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F77dd8242-6d53-4f2c-a401-243aa58019e3_1820x1024.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>DALLE3</figcaption></figure></div><p>Promoting techniques like “take a deep breath” and “think step by step” are now expanding into advanced methods for inference with parallel computation and heuristics (some fundamentals of search).</p><p>Tree-of-thoughts is really how it sounds.

It can be based on things like minimum length to the most agreed answer, or complex things that require external feedback, which points us back in the direction of RLHF.</p><p><span>Read the Tree of Thoughts paper here:&nbsp;</span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10601" rel="">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10601</a></p><p>The way that most RLHF is done to date has the entire response from a language model get an associated score. To anyone with an RL background, this is disappointing, because it limits the ability for RL methods to make connections about the value of each sub-component of text. Futures have been pointed to where this multi-step optimization comes at the level of multiple dialogue turns, but that is still far-fetched due to the requirement of having humans or some prompt source in the loop.</p><p>This could easily be extended to a self-play style dialogue but is hard to give an LLMs goals that translate to the self-play dynamics of consistently improving. Most of the things we want to do with LLMs are repetitive tasks without near-infinite ceilings on performance like the game of Go.</p><p><span>On the other hand, </span><strong>there is a type of LLM use case that naturally abstracts to contained chunks of text: step-by-step reasoning</strong><span>, best exemplified by math problems.</span></p><p>Process Reward Models (PRMs) have been a topic I’ve heard a lot about from RLHF folks off the record for the last 6 months. It turns out there is a lot of literature on these models, but very little on how to use them with RL.</p><p><span>The core idea of a PRM is to assign a score to each step of reasoning, rather than a complete message.

The true power will come when this signal is optimized against training. To create the richest optimization setting, having the ability to generate diverse reasoning pathways for scoring and learning from is essential. This is where Tree-of-Thoughts comes in. </span><strong>The prompting from ToT gives diversity to the generations, which a policy can learn to exploit with access to a PRM</strong><span>.</span></p><p>For more resources on PRMs, see the following:</p><ul><li><p><em><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.20050" rel="">Let’s Verify Step by Step</a></em><span>: a good introduction to PRMs.</span></p></li><li><p><em><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14275" rel="">Solving math word problems with process- and outcome-based feedback</a></em><span>: the canonical citation in all PRM and reasoning works in 2023.</span></p></li><li><p><em><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01825" rel="">Scaling Relationship on Learning Mathematical Reasoning with Large Language Models</a></em><span>: A paper that studies the method of rejection sampling for reasoning problems, among other contributions.</span></p></li><li><p><em><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10080" rel="">Let's reward step by step: Step-Level reward model as the Navigators for Reasoning</a></em></p></li></ul><p><span>Additionally, there’s one popular openly available math model that is documented as training with PRMs:&nbsp;</span><a href="https://huggingface.co/WizardLM/WizardMath-70B-V1.0" rel="">Wizard-LM-Math</a><span>. Second, OpenAI&nbsp;</span><a href="https://github.com/openai/prm800k" rel="">released their fine-grained reward labels</a><span>&nbsp;from the Verify Step by Step paper for training a PRM earlier this year.</span></p><p><span>🧪🎙️ Tom and I discussed Q* and all of the OpenAI drama on </span><a href="https://retortai.com/episodes/q-and-openais-strange-loop-we-pecant-even" rel="">this week’s episode of The Retort</a><span>, check it out!</span></p><p>Q* seems to be using PRMs to score Tree of Thoughts reasoning data that then is optimized with Offline RL. This wouldn’t look too different from existing RLHF toolings that use offline algorithms like DPO or ILQL that do not need to generate from the LLM during training. The ‘trajectory’ seen by the RL algorithm is the sequence of reasoning steps, so we’re finally doing RLHF in a multi-step fashion rather than contextual bandits!</p><p>Given that the rumors I’ve heard already indicated OpenAI was using offline RL for RLHF (which doesn’t say that much), this doesn’t seem like a big leap to me. The intricacies of this method involve collecting the right prompts, having a model to generate great reasoning steps, and most importantly: accurately scoring tens of thousands of completions.</p><p><strong>This last step is where the rumored “vast computing resources”: use AI to label every step with a score instead of humans</strong><span>. Synthetic data is king, and with trees rather than single-width paths (via chain-of-thought) giving more and more options later on to arrive at the right answer.</span></p><p>The ton of compute resources tracks with the rumor that I’ve heard one or more of the big tech players (Google, Anthropic, Cohere, etc) are creating a pretraining-sized dataset from process supervision or RLAIF-like methods, which would take 10s of thousands of GPU hours easily. The gap to openly available models in this area worries me.</p><p>All of this said while the core ideas seem clear to me, implementing this takes levels of model whispering few poses. Distribution control, massive inference, and RL finickiness are well beyond my knowledge or experience. All of this information just seems so natural. All the evaluations for ToT and PRMs are on reasoning problems like math, which is what all the news articles were saying this leaked method was about. Even if it isn’t Q*, it would be a fun experiment.</p><p><span>As I’ve written about before, </span><a href="https://www.interconnects.ai/p/beyond-human-data-rlaif?utm_source=%2Fsearch%2Frlaif&amp;utm_medium=reader2" rel="">AI Feedback and Constitutional AI are underrepresented in public awareness</a><span>. Synthetic data represents the shortest path to expanding datasets. In the short term, it’s clear we can create some useful data with this. What is not clear is the extent to which it can be scaled — ie can it replace internet scale data entirely?</span></p></div></div>]]></description>

Ubisoft says it was trying to put an ad for <em>Assassin’s Creed Mirage</em> in the main menu of other <em>Assassin’s Creed </em>games. However, a “technical error” caused the promotion to show up on in-game menus instead. Ubisoft says the issue has since been fixed.</p><p>We recently saw Microsoft use <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/3/23945174/microsoft-xbox-fullscreen-pop-up-ad-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-xbox-consoles">fullscreen Xbox pop-up ads</a> to promote its own games, and they’ve been annoying Xbox owners. Microsoft’s ads only appear when you boot an Xbox, and not everyone seems to be getting them. Microsoft and Ubisoft’s pop-ups are still very different to the ads we’re used to seeing on game consoles. We’ve seen games like <em>Saints Row 2 </em>with ads running on billboards, or plenty of in-game ads in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-signs-up-for-more-in-game-ads/1100-6175614/">EA Games</a> titles in the mid-to-late 2000s. </p><p>Fullscreen pop-up ads in the middle of a game certainly aren’t common. Imagine a world full of games you’ve paid $70 for and then ads popping up in the middle of gameplay. I truly hope that Ubisoft’s “technical error” never becomes a game industry reality.</p><p><em><strong>Update November 24th, 1:01PM ET: </strong>Added an explanation from Ubisoft.</em></p></div></div>]]></description>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">In The Box</h2>
<p dir="auto">Mail-in-a-Box turns a fresh Ubuntu 22.04 LTS 64-bit machine into a working mail server by installing and configuring various components.</p>
<p dir="auto">It is a one-click email appliance. There are no user-configurable setup options. It "just works."</p>
<p dir="auto">The components installed are:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>SMTP (<a href="http://www.postfix.org/" rel="nofollow">postfix</a>), IMAP (<a href="http://dovecot.org/" rel="nofollow">Dovecot</a>), CardDAV/CalDAV (<a href="https://nextcloud.com/" rel="nofollow">Nextcloud</a>), and Exchange ActiveSync (<a href="http://z-push.org/" rel="nofollow">z-push</a>) servers</li>
<li>Webmail (<a href="http://roundcube.net/" rel="nofollow">Roundcube</a>), mail filter rules (thanks to Roundcube and Dovecot), and email client autoconfig settings (served by <a href="http://nginx.org/" rel="nofollow">nginx</a>)</li>
<li>Spam filtering (<a href="https://spamassassin.apache.org/" rel="nofollow">spamassassin</a>) and greylisting (<a href="http://postgrey.schweikert.ch/" rel="nofollow">postgrey</a>)</li>
<li>DNS (<a href="https://www.nlnetlabs.nl/projects/nsd/" rel="nofollow">nsd4</a>) with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sender_Policy_Framework" rel="nofollow">SPF</a>, DKIM (<a href="http://www.opendkim.org/" rel="nofollow">OpenDKIM</a>), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMARC" rel="nofollow">DMARC</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNSSEC" rel="nofollow">DNSSEC</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS-based_Authentication_of_Named_Entities" rel="nofollow">DANE TLSA</a>, <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8461" rel="nofollow">MTA-STS</a>, and <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4255" rel="nofollow">SSHFP</a> policy records automatically set</li>
<li>TLS certificates are automatically provisioned using <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/" rel="nofollow">Let's Encrypt</a> for protecting https and all of the other services on the box</li>
<li>Backups (<a href="http://duplicity.nongnu.org/" rel="nofollow">duplicity</a>), firewall (<a href="https://launchpad.net/ufw" rel="nofollow">ufw</a>), intrusion protection (<a href="http://www.fail2ban.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">fail2ban</a>), and basic system monitoring (<a href="http://munin-monitoring.org/" rel="nofollow">munin</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">It also includes system management tools:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Comprehensive health monitoring that checks each day that services are running, ports are open, TLS certificates are valid, and DNS records are correct</li>
<li>A control panel for adding/removing mail users, aliases, custom DNS records, configuring backups, etc.</li>
<li>An API for all of the actions on the control panel</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Internationalized domain names are supported and configured easily (but SMTPUTF8 is not supported, unfortunately).</p>
<p dir="auto">It also supports static website hosting since the box is serving HTTPS anyway. (To serve a website for your domains elsewhere, just add a custom DNS "A" record in you Mail-in-a-Box's control panel to point domains to another server.)</p>
<p dir="auto">For more information on how Mail-in-a-Box handles your privacy, see the <a href="https://github.com/mail-in-a-box/mailinabox/blob/main/security.md">security details page</a>.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Installation</h2>
<p dir="auto">See the <a href="https://mailinabox.email/guide.html" rel="nofollow">setup guide</a> for detailed, user-friendly instructions.</p>
<p dir="auto">For experts, start with a completely fresh (really, I mean it) Ubuntu 22.04 LTS 64-bit machine. On the machine...</p>
<p dir="auto">Clone this repository and checkout the tag corresponding to the most recent release:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ git clone https://github.com/mail-in-a-box/mailinabox
$ cd mailinabox
$ git checkout v65"><pre><code>$ git clone https://github.com/mail-in-a-box/mailinabox
$ cd mailinabox
$ git checkout v65
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Begin the installation.</p>

<p dir="auto">The installation will install, uninstall, and configure packages to turn the machine into a working, good mail server.</p>
<p dir="auto">For help, DO NOT contact Josh directly --- I don't do tech support by email or tweet (no exceptions).</p>
<p dir="auto">Post your question on the <a href="https://discourse.mailinabox.email/" rel="nofollow">discussion forum</a> instead, where maintainers and Mail-in-a-Box users may be able to help you.</p>
<p dir="auto">Note that while we want everything to "just work," we can't control the rest of the Internet. Other mail services might block or spam-filter email sent from your Mail-in-a-Box.
This is a challenge faced by everyone who runs their own mail server, with or without Mail-in-a-Box. See our discussion forum for tips about that.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="canvas">
  <p>The <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/cmsdata/278103/eIDAS-4th-column-extract.pdf">final
  text</a> of the update to the eIDAS regulation (establishing a
  framework for a European Digital Identity) has been agreed upon. In a
  last minute effort to improve the text, <a href="https://eidas-open-letter.org/">we wrote an open letter</a>
  criticising the proposal on weakening the security of the web, and
  providing too few safeguards protecting users of the proposed European
  Identity Wallet. Were we successful?</p>
  <p>Looking at the text, it is clear this is a compromise (and an
  amendment to an existing regulation). In particular the structure is a
  mess, with new articles introducing the identity wallet running as far
  as four levels deep. This is a tough read. (Also, someone at the
  Commission needs to carefully cross-check all references because
  e.g.&nbsp;Article 45a-1.4 refers to Article 17(3)(c) that appears to no
  longer to exist.) I guess that’s life when regulating a hotly
  contested topic.</p>
  <p>Let’s study the two topics we addressed in our open letter: web
  security, and wallet privacy.</p>
  <h2 id="weakening-the-security-of-the-web">Weakening the security of
  the web</h2>
  <p>We were concerned about the phrasing of Article 45, that lays down
  a requirement for browsers to recognise any certificate that satisfies
  some criteria specified in an annex to the regulation, <em>without any
  other requirements to be imposed by the browsers</em>. We were
  especially concerned that browsers were prevented from running
  additional security checks when such certificates were being used to
  authenticate a website, depending on how you would read Article
  45a.</p>
  <p>Why would this be a problem?</p>
  <p>For a browser to ‘recognise’ a certificate means that the issuer of
  the certificate (the party that signs the contents of the certificate)
  is added to the trusted root list of a browser. When a browser visits
  a website, it asks the website to provide a valid certificate
  (i.e.&nbsp;one signed by <em>any</em> of the issuers in its trusted root
  list). The certificate contains the domain name of the website (which
  the browsers checks against the domain name in the link for the
  website it is visiting) and a public key for that domain. The issuer
  has verified that the public key indeed belongs to that website. And
  the browser verifies the signature on the certificate it just received
  to ensure correctness of this information. It then challenges the
  website to prove it knows the private key corresponding to the public
  key found in the certificate, while at the same time establishing a
  session key to encrypt the communication between the browser and the
  website.</p>
  <p>This complex protocol proves authenticity of the website and
  guarantees confidentiality of the communication between the browser
  and the website, <strong>provided that all issuers in the trusted root
  list refrain from issuing rogue certificates that link the wrong
  public key to a website domain</strong>. If not, a malicious entity
  (say a law enforcement agency in a member state) could mount a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack">man-in-the-middle
  attack</a> pretending to be the actual website at domain
  <code>suspicious-forum.net</code> by sending a rogue certificate for
  that domain (that it forced one of the issuers in the member state to
  sign), thus getting hold of the encryption key used to protect the
  communication, and thus being able to eavesdrop on that communication.
  This would break the end-to-end encryption guarantee for websites, and
  would allow law enforcement to surreptitiously surveil visitors of
  websites.</p>
  <p>Security mechanisms currently implemented in browsers (like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_Transparency">certificate
  transparency</a>) would detect and prevent such an abuse - but
  browsers might not be allowed to act upon it depending on how you
  would read Article 45 and 45a.</p>
  <p>Unfortunately, Article 45 itself has not changed since we published
  our letter. However, the following was added to Recital 32:</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>The obligation of recognition, interoperability and support of
  QWACs is not to affect the freedom of web-browser providers to ensure
  web security, domain authentication and the encryption of web traffic
  in the manner and with the technology they consider most
  appropriate.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>This still means that browsers have to unilaterally recognise
  certificates that satisfy the requirement specified in the annex to
  the regulation, which could be much weaker than those typically
  imposed ex ante by browsers. In practice this means that issuers of
  such certificates have to be added to the trusted root list in the
  browser, creating a less secure PKI for the web.</p>
  <p>But given the changes to recital 32 I am much less worried about
  the actual risk of breaking the end-to-end encryption for websites by
  e.g.&nbsp;law enforcement. In particular, with the text added to recital
  32, I believe that Article 45a.2</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>By way of derogation to paragraph 1 and only in case of
  substantiated concerns related to breaches of security or loss of
  integrity of an identified certificate or set of certificates,
  web-browsers may take precautionary measures in relation to that
  certificate or set of certificates.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>allows browsers to continue to use the security mechanism (like
  certificate transparency) to detect and prevent such attacks to
  end-to-end encryption, by refusing to accept such a rogue
  certificate.</p>
  <p>Moreover, article 45a.3 requires the browser (vendor) to notify the
  competent supervisory authority in the member state <em>and</em> the
  Commission of such attacks taking place. Even though article 45a.4
  puts the sole authority to investigate and decide on the final
  withdrawal of such a certificate on the competent authority (of the
  member state whose law enforcement agency in the example above
  initiated the wilful subversion of the end-to-end encryption of the
  web), I simply cannot believe that any competent authority could claim
  there is nothing wrong and that the certificate should be reinstated:
  they would be very clearly and publicly be caught red-handed in
  subverting global web security.</p>
  <h2 id="privacy-of-the-wallet">Privacy of the wallet</h2>
  <p>Regarding the identity wallet, we were concerned about the lack of
  privacy guarantees when using it to reveal certain non-identifying
  attributes (like age) to service providers. In particular, we were
  worried that users would not be sufficiently protected against service
  providers asking for more information than necessary for offering
  their service (i.e.&nbsp;<em>over-authentication</em>). Also, we were
  worried that the use of the wallet and the use of the attribute
  certificates contained in it could be ‘linkable’, i.e.&nbsp;that visits by
  a particular user to different websites could be linked (by the issuer
  or the websites).</p>
  <p>It appears that our concerns have been addressed, somewhat.</p>
  <p>Regarding the risk of <em>over-authentication</em>, I am quite
  happy to see that the registration process of relying parties has been
  strengthened.</p>
  <p>Article 6a.4.(ba) requires that “the identity of relying parties
  can be validated by implementing authentication mechanisms in
  accordance with Article 6b”. Moreover, the attributes relying parties
  are allowed to request from wallet users must be specified upfront and
  be made “available online in electronically signed or sealed form
  suitable for automated processing” (Article 6b.1e). Wallets shall use
  this information to “implement the appropriate mechanism to inform
  that the requesting relying party or the requesting user of European
  Digital Identity Wallets have the permission to access [these
  attributes]” (Article 6a.4.(ca).</p>
  <p>Together these provide some technically enforced mechanism to
  prevent ‘over-authentication’ by relying parties.</p>
  <p>The situation regarding unlinkability is less clear. Article
  6a.4.(a).(4e) says that</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>European Digital Identity Wallets shall, in particular support
  common protocols and interfaces for relying parties to verify the
  authenticity and validity of European Digital Identity Wallets</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>and Article 6a.5.5a says that</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>Member States shall provide means to revoke the validity of [a
  specific] European Digital Identity Wallet</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Both requirements seem to imply that the validity of specific
  wallets can individually be checked by relying parties, which is hard
  (though not impossible, see below) to align with any unlinkability
  requirement.</p>
  <p>Article 6a.7b.(a) on the other hand says that</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>The technical framework of the European Digital Identity Wallet
  shall not allow providers of electronic attestations of attributes or
  any other party, after the issuance of the attestation of attributes,
  to obtain data that allows for tracking, linking, correlating or
  otherwise obtain knowledge of transactions or user behaviour unless
  explicitly authorised by the user.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The problem is that the most recent public version (i.e.&nbsp;version
  1.0) of the Architecture Reference Framework (ARF) only allows the use
  of standardised ‘boring’ cryptographic primitives that do not allow
  the implementation of truly multi-show unlinkable attribute
  certificates (ABCs). As far as I understand, wallets work around this
  by requiring issuers to issue several one-time use certificates in one
  go. Users can use each of these only once and then throw them away.
  Clearly, this reveals the number of times you reveal a particular
  attribute to the issuer because you need to request new ones once your
  current stack in the wallet is empty. Also, issuers and relying
  parties can collude to track the use of such traditional certificates
  and link them back to you, which seems to contradict the language in
  6a.7b.(a) “shall not allow…”.</p>
  <p>Now this might all very well mean that the ARF needs to be updated
  to actually include cryptographic primitives that allow multi-show
  ABCs to be implemented. If that’s the case: hurray! To satisfy the
  requirement to verify the authenticity of wallets and to revoke
  specific wallets, so-called blacklistable credentials could be used.
  In any case, protocols to <a href="http://www.cs.ru.nl/~jhh/publications/epoch-revocation-journal.pdf">revoke
  ABCs in a privacy friendly fashion</a> exist.</p>

<p>While benchmarking open-source models, we have observed a disparity between the
results generated by our pipeline and those reported in public sources (e.g.
OpenCompass). Upon conducting a more in-depth investigation of this difference,
we have discovered that various models may employ different prompts,
post-processing strategies, and sampling techniques, potentially resulting in
significant variations in the outcomes. Our prompt and post-processing strategy
remains consistent with the original benchmark, and greedy decoding is employed
during evaluation without any post-processing for the generated content. For
scores that were not reported by the original authors (including scores reported
with different settings), we try to get results with our pipeline.</p>
<p>To evaluate the model's capability extensively, we adopted the methodology
outlined in Llama2. Specifically, we included PIQA, SIQA, HellaSwag, WinoGrande,
ARC, OBQA, and CSQA to assess common sense reasoning. SquAD, QuAC, and BoolQ
were incorporated to evaluate reading comprehension. CSQA was exclusively tested
using a 7-shot setup, while all other tests were conducted with a 0-shot
configuration. Additionally, we introduced GSM8K (8-shot@1), MATH (4-shot@1),
HumanEval (0-shot@1), and MBPP (3-shot@1) under the category "Math &amp; Code". Due
to technical constraints, we did not test Falcon-180 on QuAC and OBQA; the score
is derived by averaging the scores on the remaining tasks. Since the scores for
these two tasks are generally lower than the average, we believe that
Falcon-180B's performance was not underestimated.</p>

<p>We evaluated various benchmarks using both zero-shot and few-shot methods, except for TruthfulQA. Generally, the zero-shot approach is more common in chat models. Our evaluation strategy involves generating responses while following instructions explicitly or implicitly (such as using few-shot examples). We then isolate relevant answers from the generated text. Some models are not well-suited to produce output in the specific format required by instructions in few datasets, which leads to suboptimal results. </p>

<p>We also provide both 4-bit (AWQ) and 8-bit (GPTQ) quantized Yi chat models. Evaluation results on various benchmarks have shown that the quantized models have negligible losses. Additionally, they reduce the memory footprint size. After testing different configurations of prompts and generation lengths, we highly recommend following the guidelines in the memory footprint table below when selecting a device to run our models.</p>

		Limitations of Chat Model
	</span>
</h3>
<p>The released chat model has undergone exclusive training using Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Compared to other standard chat models, our model produces more diverse responses, making it suitable for various downstream tasks, such as creative scenarios. Furthermore, this diversity is expected to enhance the likelihood of generating higher quality responses, which will be advantageous for subsequent Reinforcement Learning (RL) training.</p>
<p>However, this higher diversity might amplify certain existing issues, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hallucination</strong>: This refers to the model generating factually incorrect or nonsensical information. With the model's responses being more varied, there's a higher chance of hallucination that are not based on accurate data or logical reasoning.</li>
<li><strong>Non-determinism in re-generation</strong>: When attempting to regenerate or sample responses, inconsistencies in the outcomes may occur. The increased diversity can lead to varying results even under similar input conditions.</li>
<li><strong>Cumulative Error</strong>: This occurs when errors in the model's responses compound over time. As the model generates more diverse responses, the likelihood of small inaccuracies building up into larger errors increases, especially in complex tasks like extended reasoning, mathematical problem-solving, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>To achieve more coherent and consistent responses, it is advisable to adjust generation configuration parameters such as<code>temperature</code>,<code>top_p</code>, or<code>top_k</code>. These adjustments can help in the balance between creativity and coherence in the model's outputs.</p>

<p><strong>Prompt</strong>: There's a place where time stands still. A place of breath taking wonder, but also</p>
<p><strong>Generation</strong>: There's a place where time stands still. A place of breath taking wonder, but also of great danger. A place where the very air you breathe could kill you. A place where the only way to survive is to be prepared.
The place is called the Arctic.
The Arctic is a vast, frozen wilderness. It is a place of extremes. The temperatures can drop to -40 degrees Celsius. The winds can reach speeds of 100 kilometers per hour. The sun can shine for 24 hours a day, or not at all for weeks on end.
The Arctic is also a place of great beauty. The ice and snow are a pristine white. The sky is a deep blue. The sunsets are spectacular.
But the Arctic is also a place of great danger. The ice can be treacherous. The winds can be deadly. The sun can be blinding.

unique compared to most programming environments and extremely valuable. <a href="https://www.deconstructconf.com/2018/pablo-meier-a-fresh-look-on-failure" tabindex="0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I
spoke at length about them at Deconstruct 2018</a>. I'll also bullet
out some points here, with links to deeper dives if you're curious:</p><ul><li><p>Fantastic support for concurrency and parallelism that's designed to avoid
system failure. See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvBT4XBdoUE" tabindex="0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The soul of Erlang and Elixir</a> by Saša Jurić. Ask
yourself as you watch "How would I implement a system with these properties in
Ruby, Node, Python, or Java?"</p></li><li><p>Correctness guarantees for partial failures and transient errors (see <a href="https://ferd.ca/it-s-about-the-guarantees.html" tabindex="0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">It's
About Guarantees</a> by Fred Hebert). Transient errors are extremely common
and most environments don't have a great mechanism for handling them.</p></li><li><p>Efficient string construction, especially useful in template rendering
(<a href="https://www.evanmiller.org/elixir-ram-and-the-template-of-doom.html" tabindex="0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elixir RAM and the Template of Doom</a> by Evan Miller).</p></li></ul><p>Succinctly, BEAM is a battle-tested VM for resilient, concurrent applications,
and OTP builds abstractions over it that are hard to find in other environments.
<strong>These have done more to change how I think about programming systems than
anything else I've encountered since graduating, and I miss these features in
every other environment I've worked on since.</strong></p><p><img alt="A necromancer labeled &quot;Erlang,&quot; standing over an army of dead, saying &quot;Destroy
one of my processes and I will only grow stronger&quot;" src="https://engineering.ramp.com/images/PPerlang.8e1d8d64.png"></p><h4>…with a great, modern developer experience</h4><p>So move it all to Erlang? Not quite. Even with the magic of OTP/BEAM, Erlang can
be challenging to adopt. Amazing work has been done to improve this, from
software like <a href="https://rebar3.readme.io/docs/getting-started" tabindex="0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rebar3</a> to documentation like <a href="https://adoptingerlang.org/" tabindex="0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adopting Erlang</a>. While I
highly recommend everyone give Erlang a try, many of the conveniences of Elixir
made it easier to choose for a high-growth company setting.</p><p>First, the syntax is more familiar for programmers from other environments
(here's an example of <a href="https://www.rosettacode.org/wiki/Create_an_HTML_table#Erlang" tabindex="0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Erlang</a> compared to <a href="https://www.rosettacode.org/wiki/Create_an_HTML_table#Elixir" tabindex="0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elixir</a>). Syntax isn't
personally interesting for me, and I happen to find Erlang beautiful, but I'd be
in denial if I pretended I didn't observe a meaningful negative reaction from
others when I tried introducing them to Erlang.</p><p>Second, tools follow a stricter set of conventions, often with very
human-friendly ergonomics. Some examples:</p><ul><li><p><code>mix test</code> on a generated <a href="https://www.phoenixframework.org/" tabindex="0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Phoenix</a> project will structure tests for
concurrency by default with a <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/ecto_sql/Ecto.Adapters.SQL.Sandbox.html" tabindex="0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">database sandboxing environment</a> such
that it's harder to design a test suite whose runtime will grow
superlinearly over time. Did you only want to run tests that failed?
There's <code>mix test --failed</code>! There's also <a href="https://twitter.com/josevalim/status/1363791170745348097" tabindex="0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a way to run only on <code>stdin</code> if
you want to work on updated tests.</a></p></li><li><p>There's also <code>iex</code>, the Elixir REPL. With the BEAM's hot code reloading,
when you open a REPL, you can reload the module you're working on with <code>r MyModule</code> after a change, so you can use a REPL without having to close and
open it on a regular basis. Both of these allow rapid test execution and
rapid prototyping/turnaround.</p></li><li><p>Many of the tools have friendlier error messages. I ran into an issue with
Ecto one time <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/56430391/196469" tabindex="0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">and the creator of Elixir answered my question on
StackOverflow, while also pushing a commit to clarify the error message in
the library.</a></p></li><li><p>Documentation culture: Elixir libraries tend to have amazing documentation,
evidenced by tools like <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/mix-otp/docs-tests-and-with.html#doctests" tabindex="0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">doctests</a> that will run the snippets in your
docs to ensure your examples match with reality. Additionally,
<a href="https://pragprog.com/categories/elixir-phoenix-and-otp/" tabindex="0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PragProg</a> offers a ton of great books that I've personally enjoyed.</p></li></ul><p>Finally (and this deserves a post of its own), consider the ergonomics afforded
by having tools like <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/meta/macros.html" tabindex="0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a macro system</a> and <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/sigils.html" tabindex="0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sigils.</a> Macros are highly
romanticized, and there's much justified danger of using them too freely when a
function will do; with that said, the flexibility can be used to great effect:
much of Pheonix, Ecto, and ExUnit's more declarative constructs come from the
use of these.</p><p><img alt="A sweet, Sailor Moon-ey cute anime girl magician saying &quot;I draw Eldritch Power from all my process-chans!&quot;" src="https://engineering.ramp.com/images/PPelixir.10a2c218.png"></p><p>(source same as above. Also note that all the points 👆 aren't just beneficial in contrast to Erlang, but stand strong next to any other programming ecosystem)</p><h4>Dynamic types, while avoiding the pitfalls</h4><p>I'll make a special mention for two specific features I miss most in
environments like Python, Node, or Ruby: <em>immutability</em> and <em>module structure
with aliased calls.</em> My hot take about most dynamic languages is that they are a
poor fit for startups who have intentions of being long-term businesses: you've
created an environment that's optimized for your founding engineers to build
something quickly in the first 7 months, but the price is a set of recurring
obstacles which your engineers will pay down over the next 7 years. That
microframework where all 4 of your engineers kept the first 10k
LOC in their heads starts to be much harder to work with when you hit with 40
engineers and 400k LOC (and beyond! oh, and you have customers now, too).</p><p>Obviously companies have gone on to great success on all kinds of technologies,
and getting to product-market fit matters a lot more than optimizing for life
after it; but I don't think it should be controversial to say <em>when
trying to understand or modify large systems, it helps to have invariants</em>, and
most dynamic languages don't give you many. Elixir's immutability shines here.
Consider the following lines of Elixir:</p><pre><code><span>defmodule</span><span> </span><span>MyApp</span><span>.</span><span>Widgets</span><span> </span><span>do</span><span>

</span>
<span></span><span># def _dependencies_for(signal):</span><span>
</span><span></span><span># def _applicable_to(signal_deps, widet):</span></code></pre><p>Pay attention to what you know <em>isn't</em> happening in the Elixir example:</p><ul><li><p>You know <code>conn</code> and <code>w</code> <em>will not change</em> in the call to <code>find_abbreviation</code>.
In most environments, you don't know if your structures will mutate outside of
where you can see them, so you're not sure to what degree you can count on
them further in the execution. In an immutable language, you can trust the
data is the same for the whole function body while reading it.</p></li><li><p>We didn't <code>import</code> WidgetConnection, we <code>alias</code>-ed it, meaning we merely added
some syntactic sugar to a fully qualified function call. This, combined with
the restriction that Elixir modules can't contain code that executes at the
toplevel, means we don't have to worry about circular imports: In
Elixir, both modules can <code>alias</code> each other, but in Python, you can't have
both <code>import</code> each other's definitions.</p></li></ul><p>So as the Elixir app grows and grows, an entire class of uncertainty over "what
is this code in front of me doing" goes away, because there's a ton of dangerous
behavior you know it's <em>not</em> doing. You're not home free! Function calls to
other modules could still call the network, or write to the DB, or delete files.
But you're certain it's not changing the variables you are looking at, and you
don't need to keep a universe of state changes in your head to understand what
the code is doing.</p><p>Additionally, "make that module's code visible to this code" has a rash of
problems we avoid as well. This can get complicated! <a href="https://blog.khanacademy.org/the-great-python-refactor-of-2017-and-also-2018/" tabindex="0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Khan Academy once spent 2
months moving files around</a>, and <a href="https://instagram-engineering.com/python-at-scale-strict-modules-c0bb9245c834" tabindex="0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram Engineering explicitly talks
about wanting some of these contraints</a> in Python's module system. <a href="https://dropbox.tech/application/our-journey-to-type-checking-4-million-lines-of-python" tabindex="0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's
Dropbox Engineering describing "the tangle,"</a> on how Python's module loading
complicated their type checker, since module dependencies can become impossible
to tease out at scale. Using <code>alias</code> means not having to worry about a
dependency tree in the definitions stage.</p><p>This is not to pick on Python in particular; just again to highlight a strength
in a core design choice of Erlang and Elixir that made it appealing to me as a
developer who's been burnt on large codebases in other languages.</p><p><img alt="reverentgeek graphic of Joe Armstrong, with a quote of his: &quot;Make it work, then make it beautiful, then if you really, really have to, make it fast. 90% of the time, if you make it beautiful, it will already be fast.

Also, one thing the other languages do better than Erlang/Elixir? Bolted-on type checkers. <a href="https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/" tabindex="0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mypy</a> or <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/" tabindex="0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TypeScript</a> or <a href="https://sorbet.org/" tabindex="0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sorbet</a> have a lot of great qualities missing in the humble <a href="https://learnyousomeerlang.com/dialyzer" tabindex="0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dialyzer.</a></p><h4>Augmenting, but choice of tech is only part of it</h4><p>Ramp uses Elixir for a few specific, critical services: our real-time
Authorization engine (which requires extremely high uptime) and our Risk
analysis platform (requiring strong concurrency and data pipeline
ingestion). That said, it isn't what powers most of our business: our largest
service is in Python, and our frontend is in TypeScript with React. When
looking at how one can best work towards engineering success, rather than
specific tech, I think it's more important to ask:</p><ul><li><p>Is your team <a href="https://increment.com/teams/the-epistemology-of-software-quality/" tabindex="0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">getting enough sleep, and avoiding high-stress conditions?</a>
A little opt-in hustle is fine, but <strong>do not crunch</strong>.</p></li><li><p>Do you trust your teammates to support <em>and</em> challenge you? Nasty
conflict may be a sign of bad team dynamics, but <a href="https://blog.capterra.com/strong-teams-why-conflict-is-essential-for-true-commitment/" tabindex="0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lack of healthy conflict is
also an anti-pattern</a>, signaling low investment or trust.</p></li><li><p>Can you assign your team tasks that you trust and empower them <a href="https://hbr.org/2015/12/how-to-make-employees-feel-like-they-own-their-work" tabindex="0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">to own?</a></p></li><li><p>Do your team members <a href="https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/understanding-team-effectiveness/steps/foster-psychological-safety/" tabindex="0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">feel psychologically safe to participate, to innovate,
and to invest?</a></p></li></ul><p>Clearly, <em>I love what Elixir allows me to do.</em> But I'll gleefully invest money
and time with a company honoring the above properties over any technical choice
they make. When I joined Ramp, there was a clear preference for Python: the
founders previously built and scaled <a href="https://paribus.co/" tabindex="0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paribus</a> on it, and brought a lot of
expertise with them. And not for nothing: Python can be an absolute joy to use ❤️
So our largest backend codebase is written in Python, and it's where most of our
developers spend their time.</p><p>But in service of the points above: our CTO asked me to design our
real-time, high-uptime Authorization service, he created an environment where I
felt safe enough to propose a different tech stack, and gave me the authority
and ownership to move forward on it. It's been exceptionally stable, flexible
enough to allow for rapid feature development, and it's some of the code I'm
most proud of in my life. Good tech doesn't merely coexist with good team
culture and management, it depends on it, so as much fun as I have fun with tech
talk like this post, it definitely has a ceiling on its utility when building a
business.</p><p>I hope I've piqued your interest in trying Elixir if you weren't considering it
before 😄 Also (and you knew it was coming), <a href="https://ramp.com/careers" tabindex="0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>please reach out if you're

    <blockquote>
  <p>This is a part of a blog post series about “useless” (or: controversial) syntax elements that emerged in recent Ruby version. The goal of the series is not to defend (or criticize) the features, but to share a “thought framework” for analysis of their reasons, design, and effect the new syntax has on a code that uses it. See also <a href="https://zverok.space/blog/2023-10-02-syntax-sugar.html">intro/ToC post</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Today’s post covers the feature that, unlike most of the others in the series, caused very little pushback: a set of shortcuts for <strong>argument forwarding</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="what">What</h2>

<p>Since <a href="https://rubyreferences.github.io/rubychanges/2.7.html#keyword-argument-related-changes">Ruby 2.7</a>, this is possible (please note that <code>...</code> in the code below is the exact valid syntax, not “code omitted for a blog post”):</p>

<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>foo</span><span>(</span><span>...</span><span>)</span>
  <span># bar receives all positional, named and block arguments</span>
  <span># that foo received</span>
  <span>bar</span><span>(</span><span>...</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Since <a href="https://rubyreferences.github.io/rubychanges/3.1.html#anonymous-block-argument">Ruby 3.1</a>, an anonymous block argument can be “forwarded” separately:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>iterate_through_data</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>)</span>
  <span>data</span><span>.</span><span>each</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Since <a href="https://rubyreferences.github.io/rubychanges/3.2.html#anonymous-arguments-passing-improvements">Ruby 3.2</a>, one can also “forward” positional and named (keyword) arguments separately:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>split_arguments</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>,</span> <span>**</span><span>)</span>
  <span>pass_positional</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>)</span> <span># passes all positional arguments</span>
  <span>pass_keywords</span><span>(</span><span>**</span><span>)</span> <span># passes all keyword arguments</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>split_arguments</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>a: </span><span>4</span><span>,</span> <span>b: </span><span>5</span><span>)</span>
<span># after this call, those methods would be called:</span>
<span>#   pass_positional(1, 2, 3)</span>
<span>#   pass_keywords(a: 4, b: 5)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<h2 id="why--how">Why &amp; How</h2>

<p>…are inseparable here!</p>

<p>The introduction of <code>...</code> was not something discussed for years (at least, I am unaware of such discussions). It was rather an impromptu invention on the wave of the Big Changes in Ruby 2.7.</p>

<p>Version 2.7 was the last preparatory version before 3.0, and it introduced some of the “big oh” changes so everybody had time to prepare. One of such changes was a <em>final separation</em> of positional and keyword arguments: making some rules of treating arguments stricter and less cumbersome than they historically were.</p>

<p>This is a complicated topic, well covered by the <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2019/12/12/separation-of-positional-and-keyword-arguments-in-ruby-3-0/">official explanation</a>. In the context of the shorthand invention, we need to know that one of the side effects of the separation was that writing a method that just passes all of its arguments to another method became complicated. The pre-2.7 way of doing so was this:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>reader</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>mode</span><span>:)</span>
  <span># does some reading</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>def</span> <span>writer</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>content</span><span>)</span>
  <span># does some writing</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>def</span> <span>wrap</span><span>(</span><span>method</span><span>,</span> <span>*</span><span>args</span><span>)</span>
  <span># a typical wrapper method, which might, say, log execution,</span>
  <span># catch extra errors, do a more complicated dispatching and so on.</span>
  <span>send</span><span>(</span><span>method</span><span>,</span> <span>*</span><span>args</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>wrap</span><span>(</span><span>:reader</span><span>,</span> <span>"file.txt"</span><span>,</span> <span>mode: </span><span>'wb'</span><span>)</span>
<span>wrap</span><span>(</span><span>:writer</span><span>,</span> <span>"file.txt"</span><span>,</span> <span>'some content'</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p><code>*args</code> in the method signature and the method call was enough to pass all positional and keyword arguments around. In Ruby 2.7, the separation would become more formal<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, so to handle every kind of method, one needed to write:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>wrap</span><span>(</span><span>method</span><span>,</span> <span>*</span><span>args</span><span>,</span> <span>**</span><span>kwargs</span><span>)</span>
  <span>send</span><span>(</span><span>method</span><span>,</span> <span>*</span><span>args</span><span>,</span> <span>**</span><span>kwargs</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>In a generic situation, the third type of the argument should’ve been considered: a block (Ruby’s special “tail lambda”). So for a truly universal delegator, one needed to write this:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>wrap</span><span>(</span><span>method</span><span>,</span> <span>*</span><span>args</span><span>,</span> <span>**</span><span>kwargs</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>block</span><span>)</span>
  <span>send</span><span>(</span><span>method</span><span>,</span> <span>*</span><span>args</span><span>,</span> <span>**</span><span>kwargs</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>block</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>That’s a whole lot of syntax <em>and</em> naming to do a thing that is so simple by its idea!</p>

<p>So the practical solution for a shortcut “just pass whatever arguments you have” was <a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/16253">proposed</a> and quickly accepted in the form of <code>...</code>.</p>

<p>A few technicalities and edge cases were discussed and settled, some immediately, some in the next version. Say, <a href="https://rubyreferences.github.io/rubychanges/3.0.html#arguments-forwarding--supports-leading-arguments">support for passing a leading argument before forwarding syntax</a> was introduced in 3.0 but considered so useful it was then backported to the 2.7 branch and has been available there since around 2.7.3.</p>

<p>It was kind of a big deal because “delegate everything” is a very widespread phraseology in Ruby, used for all kinds of effects:</p>

<div><pre><code><span># hide the real call sequence complexity:</span>
<span>def</span> <span>log</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>,</span> <span>level</span><span>:,</span> <span>**</span><span>payload</span><span>)</span>
  <span>Loggers</span><span>::</span><span>Registry</span><span>.</span><span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>:http_logger</span><span>).</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>,</span> <span>level: </span><span>level</span><span>,</span> <span>**</span><span>payload</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>

<span># dynamically choose an implementation</span>
<span>def</span> <span>make_event</span><span>(</span><span>type</span><span>,</span> <span>sender</span><span>,</span> <span>**</span><span>details</span><span>)</span>
  <span>EVENT_CLASSES</span><span>[</span><span>type</span><span>].</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>sender</span><span>,</span> <span>**</span><span>details</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>

<span># make a nice DSL with dynamically defined methods:</span>
<span>class</span> <span>HTML</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>method_missing</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>content</span><span>,</span> <span>**</span><span>attributes</span><span>)</span>
    <span># construct tag string from tag name, content and attrs</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>HTML</span><span>.</span><span>new</span><span>.</span><span>a</span><span>(</span><span>'Ruby'</span><span>,</span> <span>href: </span><span>'https://ruby-lang.org'</span><span>)</span>
<span>#=&gt; "&lt;a href='https://ruby-lang.org'&gt;Ruby&lt;/a&gt;"</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>All of those cases can be made much shorter with <code>...</code>, without losing the <em>real</em> meaning of “just pass everything”!</p>

<p>This syntax change was a rare case when many groups with frequently conflicting views directly saw an immediate gain:</p>

<ul>
  <li>those who are usually curious about syntax changes and shortcuts found it pretty;</li>
  <li>those more cautious and frequently asking “what’s the use case”, in this case, immediately knew plenty of them (especially considering that after ruby 2.7, a lot of delegating code should’ve been rewritten anyway, either to <code>...</code> or to <code>*args, **kwargs</code>, so making peace with a shortcut seemed acceptable);</li>
  <li>finally, those with an emphasis on language as a pragmatic engineering tool saw a gain of the improved performance.</li>
</ul>

<p>The latter has a simple explanation: what you don’t name, you don’t need to put in the object. E.g., this allocates an intermediate array and hash to put positional and keyword arguments into:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>delegator</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>args</span><span>,</span> <span>**</span><span>kwargs</span><span>)</span>
  <span># `args` is Array, and `kwargs` is Hash here</span>
  <span># ...but we needed them only to immediately unpack</span>
  <span>delegatee</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>args</span><span>,</span> <span>**</span><span>kwargs</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>While this code doesn’t make additional local variables available, and therefore no need to allocate an array/hash:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>delegator</span><span>(</span><span>...</span><span>)</span>
  <span># no extra local vars here</span>
  <span>delegatee</span><span>(</span><span>...</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>So, it wasn’t a surprise or a scandal when, a couple of versions later, separate shortcuts to pass only positional and only keyword args were proposed.</p>

<p>Moreover, the change was small; those signatures were already valid syntax:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>ignore_my_args</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>def</span> <span>ignore_keyword_args</span><span>(</span><span>some</span><span>,</span> <span>positional</span><span>,</span> <span>**</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>…to say, “the method accepts any numbers of positional or keyword args (maybe for compatibility with the same method in neighbor classes), but ignores them.” So the only change <a href="https://rubyreferences.github.io/rubychanges/3.2.html#anonymous-arguments-passing-improvements">in Ruby 3.2</a> was to additionally allow to say “…and passes them further”:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>pass_my_args</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>)</span>
  <span>other_method</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>def</span> <span>pass_keyword_args</span><span>(</span><span>some</span><span>,</span> <span>positional</span><span>,</span> <span>**</span><span>)</span>
  <span>other_method</span><span>(</span><span>**</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Considering the intuitive feeling of “no new syntax” and that <code>...</code> was already there, and with the same “no unnecessary allocations” argument, the change was quickly accepted. The fact that it was <a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/18351">proposed</a> (and the high-quality implementation supplied) by Jeremy Evans, author of prominent libraries like Sequel and Roda and a member of Ruby core helped, too.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, the new syntax is acceptable not only for delegation to another method but almost everywhere where unpacking of named variables was supported:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>with_anonymous_args</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>,</span> <span>**</span><span>)</span>
  <span>ary</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>*</span><span>]</span>
  <span>hash</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>**</span><span>}</span>
  <span>p</span> <span>ary</span><span>,</span> <span>hash</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>with_anonymous_args</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>a: </span><span>4</span><span>,</span> <span>b: </span><span>5</span><span>)</span>
<span># Prints:</span>
<span>#   [1, 2, 3]</span>
<span>#   {:a=&gt;4, :b=&gt;5}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This can be considered more of a curiosity (at least the “don’t instantiate an array/hash” gain is lost here), but might be at least useful for temporary debugging statements in the pass-everything methods:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>make_event</span><span>(</span><span>type</span><span>,</span> <span>**</span><span>)</span>
  <span>puts</span> <span>"DEBUG!"</span> <span>if</span> <span>{</span><span>**</span><span>}.</span><span>key?</span><span>(</span><span>:password</span><span>)</span>  <span># temp</span>
  <span>EVENT_CLASSES</span><span>[</span><span>type</span><span>].</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>**</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Or, as the slightly-over-the-top example at the end of the “<a href="https://zverok.space/blog/2023-11-03-syntax-sugar2-pattern-matching-fin.html#taking-it-further">Pattern Matching / Taking it further</a>” shows, the “we don’t care about the name” can be repurposed to further pattern match the argument list as several possible signatures with different meanings (and, therefore, names) for parts of the argument list.</p>

<hr>

<p>The story with <code>&amp;</code> for anonymous block forwarding is a bit more complicated.</p>

<p>Unlike <code>*</code> or <code>**</code>, there was no <code>&amp;</code> for “just ignore this block” because block arguments in Ruby are always optional, and there is no way neither to demonstrate in the method signature “we require it” nor that we don’t. (It is sometimes a problem when blocks are erroneously passed—and ignored—to methods that never expected them, but it is quite <a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/19979">hard</a> <a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/15554">to solve</a>.)</p>

<p>So, when the standalone forwarding with <code>&amp;</code> <a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/11256">was proposed</a>—long before the 2.7’s “argument forwarding” work—mainly as an optimization for block allocation, it was met with great caution. At that time, the optimization part was <a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/14045">implemented</a> on its own as just optimization of passing the block around even if it was named. Later, though, when the basic argument forwarding with <code>...</code> was already in the language, the six-year-long discussion about the acceptability and readability of <code>&amp;</code> was ended with its introduction in <a href="https://rubyreferences.github.io/rubychanges/3.1.html#anonymous-block-argument">Ruby 3.1</a>.</p>

<p>That’s the same effect we saw <a href="https://zverok.space/blog/2023-11-10-syntax-sugar3-hash-values-omission.html#how">while discussing</a> keyword argument omission (which became acceptable after we got used to other cases of value-less <code>key:</code> syntax). Once a “bigger” feature takes its mindshare, the smaller ones might follow more easily.</p>

<h2 id="irks-and-quirks">Irks and quirks</h2>

<p>A small irk around ellipsis-based delegation is related to parentheses. The nature of the problem is similar to what we saw in the keyword omission case:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>my_method</span><span>(</span><span>...</span><span>)</span>
  <span>p</span> <span>...</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Is actually</p>
<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>my_meth</span><span>(</span><span>...</span><span>)</span>
  <span>(</span><span>p</span><span>()</span><span>...</span><span>)</span> <span># empty method call + a range from its result to infinity</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This affects only ellipsis (not other forms of anonymous forwarding) and is remedied, as usual, by adding parentheses:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>my_method</span><span>(</span><span>...</span><span>)</span>
  <span>p</span><span>(</span><span>...</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The worse problem is that anonymous forwarding is not supported in blocks/procs. This is especially confusing considering that an old syntax of “anonymous splat” <em>is</em> supported, and therefore one might potentially write code with a very confusing effect:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>process</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>)</span>
  <span># ...a lot of code...</span>
  <span>[</span><span>'test'</span><span>,</span> <span>'me'</span><span>].</span><span>each</span> <span>{</span> <span>|*|</span> <span>puts</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>)</span> <span>}</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>process</span><span>(</span><span>'input'</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This looks as if it will print “test” and “me” (inside of proc, <code>*</code> accepts its arguments and passes them to <code>puts</code>), but <em>actually</em>, it prints:</p>


<p>What happens here is:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>each { |*|</code> is treated in old logic “accept all arguments and discard them;”</li>
  <li><code>puts(*)</code> is treated in the new logic “see if the context has anonymous forwardable arguments”—and consider <em>the method’s arguments</em> as such.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is an <a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/19370">open discussion</a> on the matter, with a confusing (for me, at least) outcome: the Ruby developers’ meeting seems to be leaning toward an idea of just prohibiting the case like above (<code>*</code>-forwarding inside of a block with <code>*</code> arguments) while allowing more unambiguous cases.</p>

<h2 id="consequences">Consequences</h2>

<p>What happens on a (mindful) usage of argument forwarding shortcuts is the <strong>onset of explicitness</strong>.</p>

<p>This might sound confusing because the “explicitness” is frequently associated with adding more names to the code or more steps to construct the value. Like splitting the formula into a few named local variables or, instead of passing the result of some method to another, first attaching it to some name. (In pathological cases, it is “every non-trivial call/check/calculation should be its own method with the name explaining its usage.”)</p>

<p>But here, I am talking about <em>the explicitness of the intention</em> of some sizeable chunk of code, a “page” or a “chapter” of it. (In the same way in the intro article <a href="https://zverok.space/blog/2023-10-02-syntax-sugar.html#how-i-think-about-the-programming-language">I underlined</a> we’ll be talking about the reader’s comfort in comprehension of the narrative instead of the “readability” of a single line.)</p>

<p>Imagine a code like this:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>event</span><span>(</span><span>type</span><span>,</span> <span>sender</span><span>:,</span> <span>content</span><span>:,</span> <span>details</span><span>:)</span>
  <span>EventBus</span><span>::</span><span>Registry</span><span>.</span><span>instance</span><span>.</span><span>push_event</span><span>(</span><span>type</span><span>,</span> <span>sender: </span><span>sender</span><span>,</span> <span>content: </span><span>content</span><span>,</span> <span>details: </span><span>details</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Such “intermediaries” are frequent in layered systems: the params are already checked and defaults assigned by the layer above; the handling itself would be performed by the layer below; and this current method is just a shortcut in the current module (that probably invokes it many times, so repeating the verbose call of the underlying layer is tiresome).</p>

<p>There are several ways to make this definition shorter, like using <a href="https://zverok.space/blog/2023-11-10-syntax-sugar3-hash-values-omission.html">values omission</a></p>
<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>event</span><span>(</span><span>type</span><span>,</span> <span>sender</span><span>:,</span> <span>content</span><span>:,</span> <span>details</span><span>:)</span>
  <span>EventBus</span><span>::</span><span>Registry</span><span>.</span><span>instance</span><span>.</span><span>push_event</span><span>(</span><span>type</span><span>,</span> <span>sender</span><span>:,</span> <span>content</span><span>:,</span> <span>details</span><span>:)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>…or “keyword-rest” splatting:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>event</span><span>(</span><span>type</span><span>,</span> <span>**</span><span>event_data</span><span>)</span>
  <span>EventBus</span><span>::</span><span>Registry</span><span>.</span><span>instance</span><span>.</span><span>push_event</span><span>(</span><span>type</span><span>,</span> <span>**</span><span>event_data</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>But the real intention of this method is just to “pass everything further,” what the author thinks about its argument names is closer to “like, <em>you know,</em> everything” or “yeah, <em>whatever,</em> just pass it” (and frequently would just call the rest arguments <code>**kwrest</code>, or, <code>**options</code>—the latter is a long yet frequently misleading tradition of naming the last hash/keyword argument).</p>

<p>So, eventually, we can be just <strong>explicit</strong> in expressing these “you know” or “whatever”:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>event</span><span>(</span><span>...</span><span>)</span>
  <span>EventBus</span><span>::</span><span>Registry</span><span>.</span><span>instance</span><span>.</span><span>push_event</span><span>(</span><span>...</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Or, with one-line method definitions (a topic of the next article), just</p>
<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>event</span><span>(</span><span>...</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>EventBus</span><span>::</span><span>Registry</span><span>.</span><span>instance</span><span>.</span><span>push_event</span><span>(</span><span>...</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Such simplifications might appear in various stages of design. Sometimes, “just pass everything through” is an early-prototype version that allows to quickly assemble the reasonable stack of layers; and later clarify on each step what are the particular responsibilities besides pass-through.</p>

<p>Other times, after a long period of design and clarification, it becomes obvious that a bit of meaningful realignment of layers with each other’s capabilities and expectations allows dripping the trivial things in favor of the literal embodiment of “you know”,  <code>...</code>. The intention to do so sometimes would uncover an unjustified signature change through the layers and, as a <em>consequence</em>, might lead to useful cleanups.</p>

<p>In any case, an ability to designate “what’s obvious/doesn’t matter here” allows the reader to focus better on the other parts: those that <em>are</em> non-trivial and important. Or: if everything is important (and underlined by language means like long explanatory names), then nothing is.</p>

<p>That’s why I am talking about explicitness: akin to the case of <a href="https://zverok.space/blog/2023-10-11-syntax-sugar1-numeric-block-args.html">numbered block parameters</a>, sometimes giving a name to a value is just <strong>pretending</strong> to explain something. In these cases, it is good to have a syntax that allows to be <strong>clear and explicit</strong> about “nothing more to explain here.”</p>

<h2 id="how-others-do-it">How others do it</h2>

<p>Like last time (with “value omission syntax”), I actually struggled to find the <em>exact</em> correspondence of the “pass every argument” syntax: partially, maybe because there is no other languages to arrive to <code>(*args, **kwargs, &amp;block)</code> as the shortest <em>normative</em> way to say “everything that can be passed to a function.”</p>

<p>The design space here is related to accepting to the function a variable number of arguments—the concept is frequently called “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varargs">varargs</a>” (frequently demonstrated by formatted-printing functions such as <code>printf</code>). It seems that languages that have them (some, like Rust, consciously do not; Zig had them in the early versions but then decided <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/208#issuecomment-393777148">against</a>), there are a few groups:</p>

<p><strong>Group 1, “The old school”:</strong> make a declaration “variable number of arguments is accepted here” in the function signature, and provide some special name (of variable/function/macro) to access them. Say, in C:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>sum</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>count</span><span>,</span> <span>...)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>va_list</span> <span>args</span><span>;</span>
  <span>va_start</span><span>(</span><span>args</span><span>,</span> <span>count</span><span>);</span>
  <span>// handle `count` of `args`, calling `va_arg(args, int);` each time</span>
  <span>va_end</span><span>(</span><span>args</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p><strong>Group 2, “The old school, but dynamic”:</strong> in the old JS and old PHP any function, regardless of its signature, could accept<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> any number of arguments and exposed them with <code>arguments</code> (JS) or <code>func_get_args()</code> (PHP):</p>

<div><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>variadic</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span> <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>arguments</span><span>)</span> <span>}</span>

<span>variadic</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span><span>foo</span><span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>bar</span><span>'</span><span>})</span>
<span>// Prints</span>
<span>//   Arguments(4) [1, 2, 3, {foo: 'bar'}]</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>In a radical variant of this, Perl’s <code>sub</code> doesn’t have a syntax for arguments declaration at all, and all arguments are accessible inside the subroutine in a list variable <code>@_</code>, and the way to designate their names is to assign them to local variables:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>sub </span><span>test</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>my</span><span>(</span><span>$x</span><span>,</span> <span>$y</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>@_</span><span>;</span>
  <span>print</span> <span>"</span><span>x=</span><span>$x</span><span> y=</span><span>$y</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>test</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>)</span>
<span># prints x=1, y=2</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p><strong>Group 3, “New school”:</strong> Many languages have a special syntax for a function signature to declare a named parameter that would “catch” the variable list of parameters. Like in modern JS:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>new_variadic</span><span>(...</span><span>myargs</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>myargs</span><span>)</span> <span>}</span>

<span>new_variadic</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span><span>foo</span><span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>bar</span><span>'</span><span>})</span>
<span>// Prints</span>
<span>//   [1, 2, 3, {foo: 'bar'}] -- note no special "Arguments" object wrapper</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The designation used is frequently <code>...</code> or <code>*</code>, though C# uses <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/method-parameters#params-modifier"><code>param</code></a> keyword for such cases, and Kotlin uses <a href="https://kotlin-quick-reference.com/130-R-vararg-parameters.html"><code>vararg</code></a>.</p>

<p>It seems to be a generally agreed-upon practice nowadays.</p>

<p>The symmetric question is also more or less agreed upon<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>: if you have a list/array/tuple of values and want to pass them as separate arguments to some function, there is an operator for that (usually looking the same as “rest arguments” declaration, and frequently called “splat” or “spread”):</p>

<div><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>function_with_3_args</span><span>(</span><span>arg1</span><span>,</span> <span>arg2</span><span>,</span> <span>arg3</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>({</span><span>arg1</span><span>,</span> <span>arg2</span><span>,</span> <span>arg3</span><span>})</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>args_in_array</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>]</span>
<span>function_with_3_args</span><span>(...</span><span>args_in_array</span><span>)</span>
<span>// Prints: {arg1: 1, arg2: 2, arg3: 3}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>…which provides a way to perform pass-through (accept in one function “whatever arguments passed” and pass them to another function).</p>

<p>It wasn’t a given in old times! In <code>arguments</code> days of JS, “pass all arguments further” was as cumbersome as:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>b</span><span>(){</span>
    <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>arguments</span><span>);</span> <span>//arguments[0] = 1, etc</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>function</span> <span>a</span><span>(){</span>
    <span>b</span><span>.</span><span>apply</span><span>(</span><span>null</span><span>,</span> <span>arguments</span><span>);</span> <span>// pass them through, first `null` is for `this`</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>a</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span>3</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>So today’s situation (with, usually, just one named “splat” argument to be “splat” further down the layers) is enough for most pass-through situations.</p>

<p>Though, wait!</p>

<p>The interesting thing happened to Lua (as I discovered while writing the article).</p>

<p>As of <a href="https://www.lua.org/manual/5.0/manual.html#2.5.8">version 5.0</a>, it belonged to “group 1”: <code>...</code> in signature to designate “accepts any number of arguments,” a special variable <code>arg</code> with a table of all arguments inside of a function.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>f</span><span>(</span><span>...</span><span>)</span>

<p>The world of programming languages evolution is full of wonders!</p>

<hr>

<p>An aside note: the temptation to use the <code>...</code> as a syntax construct along the lines of “and so on” is tempting not only for Ruby and Lua: it is present at least in Python, where bare <code>...</code> produces an object <code>Ellipsis</code>, which can be passed around as a regular value and has various uses:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>method</span><span>():</span>
  <span>...</span> <span># do-nothing method
</span>
<span># specify type of fun as a callable with any input arguments and str result
</span><span>fun</span><span>:</span> <span>Callable</span><span>[...,</span> <span>str</span><span>]</span>

<span>matrix</span> <span>=</span> <span>np</span><span>.</span><span>matrix</span><span>([[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>],</span> <span>[</span><span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>4</span><span>]])</span>
<span># take all data by all dimensions, but only 0th column
</span><span>matrix</span><span>[...,</span> <span>0</span><span>]</span> <span>#=&gt; matrix([[1], [3]])
</span></code></pre></div>

<h2 id="taking-it-further">Taking it further</h2>

<p>There is one idea that is unlikely to be implemented yet still tempting: can we sometimes shift the place where “well, you know” can be said?</p>

<p>Imagine this code: a frequent idiom for a “callable class” (which might encapsulate a complicated multi-step algorithm that is split into multiple private methods):</p>

<div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>MyOperation</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>initialize</span><span>(</span><span>some</span><span>,</span> <span>arguments</span><span>,</span> <span>of</span><span>:,</span> <span>various: </span><span>"kinds"</span><span>)</span>
    <span># arguments assignment</span>
  <span>end</span>

  <span>def</span> <span>call</span>
    <span># ... implementation ...</span>
  <span>end</span>

  <span># public interface:</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>call</span><span>(</span><span>...</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span><span>(</span><span>...</span><span>).</span><span>call</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Its intended usage is simple:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>MyOperation</span><span>.</span><span>call</span><span>(</span><span>with</span><span>,</span> <span>some</span><span>,</span> <span>of: :arguments</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>…which just creates an instance with all arguments passed and immediately invokes its <code>#call</code> (the meat of the implementation) method.</p>

<p>The problem here is that the only public method of this class doesn’t give any information in its signature: neither to render into autogenerated documentation nor to extract via introspection:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>m</span> <span>=</span> <span>MyOperation</span><span>.</span><span>method</span><span>(</span><span>:call</span><span>)</span>
<span>#=&gt; #&lt;Method: MyOperation.call(...)&gt; -- not informative!</span>
<span>m</span><span>.</span><span>parameters</span>
<span>#=&gt; [[:rest, :*], [:keyrest, :**], [:block, :&amp;]] -- not informative either!</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The “callable wrapper” is not the only situation demonstrating this problem: a typical HTTP client implementation might have something like this (if it is written in a modern Ruby):</p>
<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>get</span><span>(</span><span>...</span><span>)</span>
  <span>make_request</span><span>(</span><span>method: :get</span><span>,</span> <span>...</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Here, again, “public interface” method <code>get</code> doesn’t demonstrate any information about its signature (which “private implementation” method <code>make_request</code> knows).</p>

<p>So, maybe it would be possible to still support the “pass everything” syntax in the presence of explicit arguments declaration? As a compromise between “say it the shortest way possible” and “spell everything like a beginner exercise”:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>get</span><span>(</span><span>endpoint</span><span>,</span> <span>params: </span><span>{},</span> <span>headers: </span><span>{},</span> <span>redirect: </span><span>false</span><span>)</span> <span># spell it here</span>
  <span>make_request</span><span>(</span><span>method: :get</span><span>,</span> <span>...</span><span>)</span> <span># "just pass it further" here</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The ticket, describing the idea, <a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/16296">exists</a>, but it never received much attention.</p>

<p>BTW, there is place in Ruby where something like this works! Calling <code>super</code> (“parent class’ version of this method”) implicitly passes all arguments of the current method<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>, which allows for some very nice shortcuts. Say, here is everything you need to do to add some defaults to a <code>Data</code> initialization:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Measurement</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>Data</span><span>.</span><span>define</span><span>(</span><span>:amount</span><span>,</span> <span>:unit</span><span>)</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>initialize</span><span>(</span><span>amount</span><span>:,</span> <span>unit: </span><span>'-none-'</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>super</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>Measurement</span><span>.</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>100</span><span>,</span> <span>'m'</span><span>)</span> <span>#=&gt; #&lt;data Measurement amount=100, unit="m"&gt;</span>
<span>Measurement</span><span>.</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>100</span><span>)</span>      <span>#=&gt; #&lt;data Measurement amount=100, unit="-none-"&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>So, the idea of “accept params declared explicitly, then just pass everything” is not <em>unimaginable</em>, at least!</p>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>

<p>So, here are some things to round up today’s entry:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Not all things should be named</strong>—we already talked about this while discussing numbered block parameters.</li>
  <li><strong>Being explicit about the absence of additional meaning</strong> is a useful kind of explicitness that should be considered to underline the meaningfulness of important parts.</li>
  <li><strong>Sometimes, performance optimization and clarity optimization align like stars</strong>, producing a feature that (while <em>still</em> meeting its haters) might be explained and defended from several points of view at once!</li>
</ol>

<p>The next part will be dedicated to the <strong>one-line (endless) methods</strong>, the syntax feature that was born out of April Fools’ joke.</p>

<p><i><b>I am sitting in a room</b></i> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_art" title="Sound art">sound art</a> piece composed in 1969 and one of composer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_Lucier" title="Alvin Lucier">Alvin Lucier</a>'s best known works.
</p><p>The piece features Lucier recording himself narrating a text, and then playing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_tape" title="Magnetic tape">tape recording</a> back into the room, re-recording it.

Due to the room's particular size and geometry, certain <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency" title="Frequency">frequencies</a> of the recording are emphasized while others are attenuated.
