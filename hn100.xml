<p>The dreaded rat lungworm—a parasite with a penchant for rats and slugs that occasionally finds itself rambling and writhing in human brains—has firmly established itself in the Southeast US and will likely continue its rapid invasion, <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/29/10/23-0706_article">a study published this week</a> suggests.</p>
<p>The study involved small-scale surveillance of dead rats in the Atlanta zoo. Between 2019 and 2022, researchers continually turned up evidence of the worm. In all, the study identified seven out of 33 collected rats (21 percent) with evidence of a rat lungworm infection. The infected animals were spread throughout the study's time frame, all in different months, with one in 2019, three in 2021, and three in 2022, indicating sustained transmission.</p>
<p>Although small, the study "suggests that the zoonotic parasite was introduced to and has become established in a new area of the southeastern United States," the study's authors, led by researchers at the University of Georgia College of Veterinary Medicine, concluded. The study was published Wednesday in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases.</p>
<p>The finding is concerning given the calamitous infection the rat lungworm, aka <em>Angiostrongylus cantonensis</em>, can cause in humans. The parasitic nematodes are, as their name suggests, typically found in rats. But they have a complicated life cycle, which can be deadly when disrupted.</p>
<h2>Sickening cycle</h2>
<p>Normally, adult worms live in the arteries around a rat's lungs—hence rat lungworm. There, they mate and lay eggs. The worm's larvae then burst out of the lungs, get coughed up by the rat, and are swallowed and eventually pooped out. From there, the larvae are picked up by slugs or snails. This can happen if the gastropods eat the rat poop or if the ravenous larvae just bore into their soft bodies. The larvae then develop in the slugs and snails, which, ideally, are eventually eaten by rats. Back in a rat, the late-stage larvae penetrate the intestines, enter the bloodstream, and migrate to the rat's central nervous system and brain. There they mature into sub-adults then migrate to the lungs, where they become full adults and mate, thus completing the cycle.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>Humans become accidental hosts in various ways. They may eat undercooked snails or inadvertently eat an infected slug or snail hiding in their unwashed salad. Infected snails and slugs can also be eaten by other animals first, like frogs, prawns, shrimp, or freshwater crabs. If humans then eat those animals before fully cooking them, they can become infected.</p>

<p>When a rat lungworm finds itself in a human, it does what it usually does in rats—it heads to the central nervous system and brain. Sometimes the migration of the worms to the central nervous system is asymptomatic or only causes mild transient symptoms. But, sometimes, they cause severe neurological dysfunction. This can start with nonspecific symptoms like headache, light sensitivity, and insomnia and develop into neck stiffness and pain, tingling or burning of the skin, double vision, bowel or bladder difficulties, and seizures. In severe cases, it can cause nerve damage, paralysis, coma, and even death.</p>

Today: Can you put plastic in the microwave?</em></p><p>It all started by accident. Kazi Albab Hussain, a PhD student at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln, was studying <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7022296/" target="_blank">silver nanoparticles</a> released by certain types of plastic food packaging when he noticed another confetti-like substance under the microscope: tiny plastic bits.</p><p>As a new father he became preoccupied by the discovery. “I’d been exposed to a whole new world, and I was worried to see that a lot of baby foods were stored in plastic,” he says. So Hussain shifted gears in his research. He wanted to know: Just how many of these particles was his child eating?</p><p>Quite possibly billions, according to his <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.est.3c01942" target="_blank">findings</a>. To test materials widely used in baby food packaging, Hussain brought a couple of store-bought polypropylene-based reusable plastic containers and a polyethylene-based reusable plastic food pouch back to his lab. Along with his team, he filled the storage vessels with water and 3% acetic acid to mimic the aqueous and acidic foods they might reasonably contain in real life. After storing the filled containers in the fridge or at room temperature for 10 days, the team found millions to billions of microplastics and nanoplastics in the liquids.</p><p><a href="https://www.bonappetit.com/story/how-to-microwave-food" target="_blank">Microwaving</a> the containers accelerated the process by an alarming magnitude: Within three minutes, some containers released as many as 4.22 million <a href="https://www.bonappetit.com/story/microplastics-food" target="_blank">microplastics</a> (particles smaller than 5 millimeters) and 2.11 billion nanoplastics (particles about 70 times smaller than the width of a human hair) per square centimeter of surface area. Hussain’s research indicates we’re eating a lot more plastic than previously believed. In 2019 <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/search/research-news/2266/" target="_blank">one study</a> calculated we might be ingesting about 50,000 microplastic particles per year.</p><p>The health impacts of eating plastic is still unclear, but researchers have long suspected they’re not great. And <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34185251/" target="_blank">growing evidence</a> suggests high exposure to microplastics (and the lengthy list of chemicals they’re made from) could provoke immune and stress responses, along with various reproductive, metabolic, and behavioral issues.</p><p>Given the mounting concern around one of <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/human-made-stuff-now-outweighs-all-life-on-earth/#:~:text=About%20half%20of%20the%20world's,19%20percent%20of%20the%20total." target="_blank">earth’s most-produced substances</a>, Hussain’s findings beg a timely question: Can you put plastic in the microwave?</p><h2>What does microwaving do to plastic?</h2><p>Plastics are spaghetti-like chains of carbon molecules, called polymers, which are usually derived from crude oil. To make plastics that are clear, cloudy, rigid, or soft, manufacturers add a cocktail of chemicals. Though there are <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acs.est.1c00976" target="_blank">more than 10,000 of them</a>, the most well-studied groups are: <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/chemistry/bisphenol" target="_blank">bisphenols</a> (which include <a data-offer-url="https://www.consumerreports.org/bpa/bpa-exposure-may-be-much-greater-than-previously-believed/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.consumerreports.org/bpa/bpa-exposure-may-be-much-greater-than-previously-believed/&quot;}" href="https://www.consumerreports.org/bpa/bpa-exposure-may-be-much-greater-than-previously-believed/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">BPA</a> and are often found in rigid products, like food storage containers and water pipes) and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8157593/" target="_blank">phthalates</a> (which are typically used to make <a data-offer-url="https://www.consumerreports.org/health/food-safety/fda-denies-petition-to-ban-all-phthalates-in-food-packaging-a8313932149/#:~:text=Phthalates%20are%20found%20in%20products,milk%20cartons%20and%20juice%20boxes." data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.consumerreports.org/health/food-safety/fda-denies-petition-to-ban-all-phthalates-in-food-packaging-a8313932149/#:~:text=Phthalates%20are%20found%20in%20products,milk%20cartons%20and%20juice%20boxes.&quot;}" href="https://www.consumerreports.org/health/food-safety/fda-denies-petition-to-ban-all-phthalates-in-food-packaging-a8313932149/#:~:text=Phthalates%20are%20found%20in%20products,milk%20cartons%20and%20juice%20boxes." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">more flexible products</a>, such as food prep gloves or the plastic lining inside a milk carton).</p><p>As Hussain found, microplastics and chemicals can build up in your leftovers over time—even when you’re storing those plastic containers in the fridge. But microwaving wet foods in plastic delivers <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/for-the-love-of-god-stop-microwaving-plastic/#:~:text=Microwaving%20delivers%20a%20double%20whammy,chemical%20components%20of%20the%20plastic." target="_blank">an even bigger one-two punch</a>: Heat speeds up hydrolysis, the process by which water molecules can essentially break chemical bonds apart. This supercharged reaction causes plastic containers to shed microplastics and nanoplastics, as well as leach chemical additives (the bisphenols, phthalates, and more), into your food. And once those microplastics are ingested, it’s possible they can degrade and also <a data-offer-url="https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/news/20221028/microplastics-health-risks-what-do-we-really-know#:~:text=Once%20in%20the%20body%2C%20these,inflammation%2C%20or%20other%20unknown%20effects." data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/news/20221028/microplastics-health-risks-what-do-we-really-know#:~:text=Once%20in%20the%20body%2C%20these,inflammation%2C%20or%20other%20unknown%20effects.&quot;}" href="https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/news/20221028/microplastics-health-risks-what-do-we-really-know#:~:text=Once%20in%20the%20body%2C%20these,inflammation%2C%20or%20other%20unknown%20effects." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">leach chemicals in the body</a>.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>In other words, heating plastic essentially makes it softer and more porous. If you’ve ever microwaved marinara sauce in a plastic bowl, you’ve seen the sunset red, impossible-to-remove stain it leaves behind. “Passages in the plastic can open up, so the sauce gets inside,” says James Rogers, PhD the director of food safety research and testing at <a data-offer-url="https://www.consumerreports.org/health/food-safety/5-things-our-food-safety-expert-would-never-do-a1091094520/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.consumerreports.org/health/food-safety/5-things-our-food-safety-expert-would-never-do-a1091094520/&quot;}" href="https://www.consumerreports.org/health/food-safety/5-things-our-food-safety-expert-would-never-do-a1091094520/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><em>Consumer Reports</em></a>.

For boys, that early contact could cause <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC5915182/" target="_blank">behavioral problems</a> as well as potentially lower <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412018303404?via%253Dihub" target="_blank">sperm counts</a> later in life.

At Duke University, Jason Somarelli, PhD, the director of research at the Duke Comparative Oncology Group, is studying the thousands of other additives in plastics. “We’ve found at least 100 known carcinogens in these other chemicals,” he says. “And then there’s well over 2,000 others where we just don’t have enough data to know.” What he can say with confidence: “There’s bad stuff in plastic.”</p><p>Beyond the chemicals being leached by plastics, the particles themselves—which have been discovered in human <a data-offer-url="https://www.plasticpollutioncoalition.org/blog/2023/8/18/microplastics-found-in-human-hearts" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.plasticpollutioncoalition.org/blog/2023/8/18/microplastics-found-in-human-hearts&quot;}" href="https://www.plasticpollutioncoalition.org/blog/2023/8/18/microplastics-found-in-human-hearts" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">hearts</a>, <a data-offer-url="https://www.plasticpollutioncoalition.org/resource-library/detection-of-plastics-in-human-blood" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.plasticpollutioncoalition.org/resource-library/detection-of-plastics-in-human-blood&quot;}" href="https://www.plasticpollutioncoalition.org/resource-library/detection-of-plastics-in-human-blood" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">bloodstreams</a>, <a data-offer-url="https://www.plasticpollutioncoalition.org/resource-library/microplastics-found-in-human-lungs" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.plasticpollutioncoalition.org/resource-library/microplastics-found-in-human-lungs&quot;}" href="https://www.plasticpollutioncoalition.org/resource-library/microplastics-found-in-human-lungs" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">lungs</a>, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33395930/" target="_blank">placentas</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0048969723013293" target="_blank">semen</a>, and <a data-offer-url="https://www.plasticpollutioncoalition.org/resource-library/microplastics-in-breastmilk" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.plasticpollutioncoalition.org/resource-library/microplastics-in-breastmilk&quot;}" href="https://www.plasticpollutioncoalition.org/resource-library/microplastics-in-breastmilk" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">breastmilk</a>—pose a threat too.

That can trigger an immune response: Because plastics can’t be degraded, white blood cells die in the battle, causing inflammation. Those particles can also “act as transport vehicles for other pollutants,” says Vandenberg, bringing potentially toxic substances into the body.</p><p>Hussain wanted to see for himself what microplastics and nanoplastics might do inside our bodies. His team bathed human embryonic kidney cells in high concentrations of plastics shed by the containers they were testing. Within 48 hours, 76% of embryonic kidney cells died—about three times more than the percentage of cells that spent the same amount of time in a more diluted (less plastic-y) solution. Hussain’s findings corroborate <a data-offer-url="https://www.york.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/2021/research/microplastics-harmful-human-cells/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.york.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/2021/research/microplastics-harmful-human-cells/&quot;}" href="https://www.york.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/2021/research/microplastics-harmful-human-cells/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">another study</a> published last year, which determined that direct microplastic exposure can cause cell death, inflammation, and oxidative stress.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>So, why aren’t the cells in our bodies dying en masse? “The big outstanding question is uptake,” says Somarelli. “If these plastics just get in our guts and we flush most of them out—if we’re all just walking around pooping and peeing out plastic all the time—then they will have potentially little effect.” That’s what Hussain hopes is happening too: “I would like to believe that our body is working on getting them out,” he says. But even if these particles and chemicals aren’t making us sick immediately, most experts I spoke to suspect they could still have longer-term effects.</p><h2>But what if my container is “microwave-safe”?</h2><p>Though various plastics are marked as microwave-safe—and plenty of <a href="https://theintercept.com/2023/02/18/east-palestine-plastic-industry-lobbying/" target="_blank">plastic lobbyists have defended them</a> as perfectly safe—the term is somewhat misleading.

Supposedly microwave-safe products can still contain bisphenols, phthalates, and plenty of other potentially harmful ingredients.</p><p>All of the experts I spoke with suggest people avoid storing and heating food in plastics altogether. “Without testing the entire landscape of these products, it is hard to really know” if any of them are truly safe, says Rogers. Though some types are known to pose more health risks than others. So, how can you identify them? Most plastics will have a number (one through seven) stamped somewhere on the surface, usually on the underside of the container. <a data-offer-url="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/can-you-microwave-plastic#types" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/can-you-microwave-plastic#types&quot;}" href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/can-you-microwave-plastic#types" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">The seven types include</a>:</p><ol><li><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/polyethylene-terephthalate" target="_blank">Polyethylene terephthalate</a> (PET or PETE): a semi-rigid plastic typically deployed as soda bottles, peanut butter jars, and clothing fibers.</li><li><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/materials-science/polyethylene#:~:text=High%2Ddensity%20polyethylene%20(HDPE),mechanical%20properties%20of%20PE%20material." target="_blank">High density polyethylene</a> (HDPE): the most commonly used plastic type.

These types of plastics usually have a low melting point, “which means that when you’re microwaving them, they’ll release chemicals even faster than harder plastics,” he says. Types three and seven are also the most likely categories to contain phthalates and bisphenols.</p><p>If he “was on a deserted island and [plastic] was all that was available,” Rogers says he’d opt for types two and five. These are both higher density formulas, used to contain liquids and manufacture items like the rigid plastic forks dispensed at your local takeout restaurant. They have a higher melting point, “and they also don’t tend to chip or shatter as much,” says Rogers. (Still, Hussain’s team found these types of containers shed plenty of microplastics when heated.)</p><p>Though the research into plastics is ongoing, the experts I spoke to agree that avoiding it wherever possible is worth the extra effort. “I tend to be pretty strict on this one,” says Rogers. “Personally, I avoid heating food in any plastic with an automatic default to <a data-offer-url="https://docs.google.com/document/d/18qg0g2UYETTfTRehMRFMSDD-W2DZ0QSWAUa5QJug91M/edit?usp=sharing" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://cna.st/affiliate-link/LfXDK5GmEGKZf93qiv9ySZFDrqYEPnU8JD28mFZJ4gFX327pUF4gUgB6Bo3FifpFrJAzHGjtx3pJHxjw2A6tB3qUQL1drwteQ6zF4gcVGfTU6XCawWeEPZdDqqc72asC7Bhi5iMh6hn2yuGUTHZhZkp7F7JYDkK9eRfMdQwPDjLaASqVuzPUwLkeZNcNw9kG4ukqe25NLrrGZQ4DL9i83FzLY&quot;}" href="https://cna.st/affiliate-link/LfXDK5GmEGKZf93qiv9ySZFDrqYEPnU8JD28mFZJ4gFX327pUF4gUgB6Bo3FifpFrJAzHGjtx3pJHxjw2A6tB3qUQL1drwteQ6zF4gcVGfTU6XCawWeEPZdDqqc72asC7Bhi5iMh6hn2yuGUTHZhZkp7F7JYDkK9eRfMdQwPDjLaASqVuzPUwLkeZNcNw9kG4ukqe25NLrrGZQ4DL9i83FzLY" rel="sponsored" target="_blank">glassware</a>.” Beyond never microwaving food in plastic, Vandenberg hopes people simply stop using it.

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Since July 2023, Microsoft is offering  the perfect reverse shell, embedded inside Visual Studio Code, a widely used development tool. With just a few clicks, any user with a github account can share their visual studio desktop on the web. VS code tunnel is almost considered a <a href="https://lolbas-project.github.io/lolbas/HonorableMentions/Code/">lolbin (Living Of the Land Binary)</a>.</p>
<p>I am so glad that my users now have the ability to expose their computer with highly sensitive data right on the web, through an authentication I nor control, nor supervise. My internal network is now accessible from anywhere !</p>
<p>The worse part is that this tunnel can be triggered <a href="https://badoption.eu/blog/2023/01/31/code_c2.html">from the cmdline</a> with the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/sha/download?build=stable&amp;os=cli-win32-x64">portable version of code.exe</a>. An attacker just has to upload the binary, which won't be detected by any anti-virus since it is legitimate and singed windows binary.</p>
<p>It is therefore something to watch out for.</p>
<p>Execute it, open the link mentioned, log in to your github account and there is your reverse shell.</p>

<h2 id="mitigation">Mitigation</h2>
<p>But now, as a defender, how do we block or detect its usage ?</p>
<h3 id="domains-blacklist">Domains blacklist</h3>
<p>Microsoft documentation states :</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="fallback"><span><span>1</span><span>If you're part of an organization who wants to control access to Remote Tunnels, you can do so by allowing or denying access to the domain global.rel.tunnels.api.visualstudio.com.
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Yeah it's not that simple. It will indeed block most users but, from my testing, it won't block an attacker that has already established a tunnel once. Meaning the tunnel can be kept active or restarted at will despite this domain being blacklisted.</p>
<p>From my understanding, VScode contacts <em>global.rel.tunnels.api.visualstudio.com</em> to get its "clusters" : <a href="https://global.rel.tunnels.api.visualstudio.com/api/v1/clusters">https://global.rel.tunnels.api.visualstudio.com/api/v1/clusters</a></p>

<p>Applocker is Microsoft application whitelisting technology. When enabled and configured, with default rules for example, everything is blocked by default except for the executables and scripts defined in the preceding rules.
Let's pretend we use Microsoft default rules for demo purpose.</p>
<p>To generate them, in <em>Group Policy Management Editor</em>, go to <em>Computer Configuration -&gt; Windows Settings -&gt; Security Settings -&gt; Application Control Policies -&gt; AppLocker</em>.
Right Click on <em>Create Default Rules</em>.</p>
<p>Then right click on <em>AppLocker</em> and <em>Export Policy</em>.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Each day, you leave digital traces of what you did, where you went, who you communicated with, what you bought, what you’re thinking of buying, and much more. This mass of data serves as a library of clues for personalized ads, which are sent to you by a sophisticated network – <a href="https://theconversation.com/why-bad-ads-appear-on-good-websites-a-computer-scientist-explains-178268">an automated marketplace</a> of advertisers, publishers and ad brokers that operates at lightning speed. </p>

<p>The ad networks are designed to shield your identity, but companies and governments are able to combine that information with other data, particularly phone location, <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Ethics_of_Data_and_Analytics/E51kEAAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=advertising+privacy&amp;pg=PA161&amp;printsec=frontcover">to identify you and track your movements and online activity</a>. More invasive yet is <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/spyware">spyware</a> – malicious software that a government agent, private investigator or criminal installs on someone’s phone or computer without their knowledge or consent. Spyware lets the user see the contents of the target’s device, including calls, texts, email and voicemail. Some forms of spyware can take control of a phone, including turning on its microphone and camera.</p>

<p>Now, according to <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2023-09-14/ty-article-magazine/.highlight/revealed-israeli-cyber-firms-developed-an-insane-new-spyware-tool-no-defense-exists/0000018a-93cb-de77-a98f-ffdf2fb60000">an investigative report</a> by the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, an Israeli technology company called Insanet has developed the means of delivering spyware via online ad networks, turning some targeted ads into Trojan horses. According to the report, there’s no defense against the spyware, and the Israeli government has given Insanet approval to sell the technology.</p>

<h2>Sneaking in unseen</h2>

<p>Insanet’s spyware, Sherlock, is not the first spyware that can be installed on a phone without the need to trick the phone’s owner into clicking on a malicious link or downloading a malicious file. <a href="https://www.nsogroup.com/">NSO</a>’s <a href="https://theconversation.com/what-is-pegasus-a-cybersecurity-expert-explains-how-the-spyware-invades-phones-and-what-it-does-when-it-gets-in-165382">iPhone-hacking Pegasus</a>, for instance, is one of the most controversial spyware tools to emerge in the past five years.</p>

<p>Pegasus relies on vulnerabilities in Apple’s iOS, the iPhone operating system, to infiltrate a phone undetected. Apple issued a <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213905">security update</a> for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/8/23864150/ios-16-6-1-iphone-security-vulnerability-0-day-exploit-patch-update">the latest vulnerability</a> on Sept. 7, 2023.</p>

<p>What sets Insanet’s Sherlock apart from Pegasus is its exploitation of ad networks rather than vulnerabilities in phones. A Sherlock user creates an ad campaign that narrowly focuses on the target’s demographic and location, and places a spyware-laden ad with an ad exchange. Once the ad is served to a web page that the target views, the spyware is secretly installed on the target’s phone or computer.</p>

<p>Although it’s too early to determine the full extent of Sherlock’s capabilities and limitations, the Haaretz report found that it can infect Windows-based computers and Android phones as well as iPhones.</p>

<h2>Spyware vs. malware</h2>

<p>Ad networks have been used to deliver malicious software for years, a practice dubbed <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/567045/what-is-malvertising-and-how-you-can-protect-against-it.html">malvertising</a>. In most cases, the malware is aimed at computers rather than phones, is indiscriminate, and is designed to lock a user’s data as part of a ransomware attack or steal passwords to access online accounts or organizational networks. The ad networks constantly scan for malvertising and rapidly block it when detected.</p>

<p>Spyware, on the other hand, tends to be aimed at phones, is targeted at specific people or narrow categories of people, and is designed to clandestinely obtain sensitive information and monitor someone’s activities. Once <a href="https://usa.kaspersky.com/resource-center/threats/spyware">spyware infiltrates your system</a>, it can record keystrokes, take screenshots and use various tracking mechanisms before transmitting your stolen data to the spyware’s creator. </p>

<p>While its actual capabilities are still under investigation, the new Sherlock spyware is at least capable of infiltration, monitoring, data capture and data transmission, according to the Haaretz report.</p>

            <figcaption><span>The new Sherlock spyware is likely to have the same frightening capabilities as the previously discovered Pegasus.</span></figcaption>

<h2>Who’s using spyware</h2>

<p>From 2011 to 2023, at least 74 governments engaged in contracts with commercial companies <a href="https://carnegieendowment.org/2023/03/14/why-does-global-spyware-industry-continue-to-thrive-trends-explanations-and-responses-pub-89229">to acquire spyware or digital forensics technology</a>. National governments might deploy spyware for surveillance and gathering intelligence as well as combating crime and terrorism. Law enforcement agencies might similarly use spyware <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/iphone-spyware-lets-cops-log-suspects-passcodes-when-cracking-doesn-n1209296">as part of investigative efforts</a>, especially in cases involving cybercrime, organized crime or national security threats. </p>

<p>Companies might use spyware <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-new-ways-your-boss-is-spying-on-you-11563528604">to monitor employees’ computer activities</a>, ostensibly to protect intellectual property, prevent data breaches or ensure compliance with company policies. Private investigators might use spyware to <a href="https://www.hg.org/legal-articles/private-investigator-on-cellphone-spyware-42193">gather information and evidence for clients</a> on legal or personal matters. Hackers and organized crime figures might use spyware to <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/spywarehome_0905.pdf">steal information to use in fraud or extortion schemes</a>.</p>

<p>On top of the revelation that Israeli cybersecurity firms have developed a defense-proof technology that appropriates online advertising for civilian surveillance, a key concern is that Insanet’s advanced spyware was legally authorized by the Israeli government for sale to a broader audience. This potentially puts virtually everyone at risk. </p>

<p>The silver lining is that Sherlock appears to be expensive to use. According to an internal company document cited in the Haaretz report, a single Sherlock infection costs a client of a company using the technology a hefty US$6.4 million.</p>

        <p>The dark days of the COVID-19 pandemic helped transform Sabine Hossenfelder into an unlikely social media star. In the process, she has raised a few eyebrows among her fellow scientists. She's also made an important discovery that just might bode well for her future research.</p><p>Hossenfelder turned to YouTube "to keep my sanity" when she was unable to go to her office at Germany's Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies. Actually, you might say she <em>returned</em>. She'd started a channel in 2007 but just hadn't been very active. Then came a rebranding — <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@SabineHossenfelder"><em>Science without the gobbledygook.</em></a> Today, she has 1 million subscribers (up from 50,000) and also enjoys a strong and growing contingent of Patreon supporters.</p><p>Several times a month, the theoretical physicist and mathematician drops a new video, dispensing her dry wit and pithy wisdom to a loyal fan base of nerds across the internet.</p>
      <hr><p>
      Related Story: <a href="https://text.npr.org/1198748542">Why the earliest galaxies are sparking drama and controversy among astronomers</a></p><hr><p>She takes her role as a science communicator seriously, aiming her videos at an audience seeking context. "People can go to my channel and get the brief, 20-minute summary," Hossenfelder says. "They don't have to read a whole book or download a review article, which they won't understand anyway."</p><h3>Have you heard the one about the scientist who's got jokes?</h3><p>Her channel stakes out the no-man's land between gee-whiz science and the heavyweight journals. From her experience as a freelance writer, Hossenfelder says she "knew full-well that there were stories you just can't get by an editor, not because they're wrong, but because they have no timely hook." She aims to fill that gap.</p><p>It all comes packaged with a spoonful of humor to help the science go down:</p><p>Are we all living in a computer simulation? "I quite like the idea ... it gives me hope that things will be better on the next level," she says. </p><p>Why does 5G technology use high frequencies? "There's a reason they haven't been previously used for telecommunication, and it's not because millimeter waves are also used as goodbyes for in-laws."</p><p>As her YouTube channel has gained traction, Hossenfelder has been able to hire a handful of writers, though she still writes most of her own jokes.  She's no longer at the Frankfurt Institute but has a research position at the Munich Center for Mathematical Philosophy. Meanwhile, her dive into social media has allowed her to largely escape the perpetual pursuit of research grants that she says is "always kind of like a lottery."</p><p>Posting videos to the internet, it turns out, generates a more reliable revenue stream to fund her work in quantum gravity. YouTube provides some money directly, but Hossenfelder gets more through sponsors who advertise on her channel, Patreon supporters and donations. Crunching the numbers, she "realized that so long as I would keep producing interesting content, I would have an income."</p>
      <hr><p>
      Related Story: <a href="https://text.npr.org/579666359">Scientific Theory And The Multiverse Madness</a></p><hr><h3>She hears the critics and has frank answers for them</h3><p>Hossenfelder's science channel has also become a ready platform for her somewhat contrarian views on the state of physics. Among them is what she sees as the problem of beauty, the pursuit of simplicity. Specifically, how her colleagues who try to fathom the fundamental underpinnings of the universe are obsessed with it.</p><p>As far back as the Renaissance, scientists have sought compact and elegant descriptions of space, time and motion: a sort of scientific version of Occam's razor — that the simplest explanation tends to be the correct one. But as we seek answers in a complex universe, Hossenfelder cautions that the quest for simplicity could be a dead end. Her 2018 book on the topic, <em>Lost in Math: How Beauty Leads Physics Astray,</em> served as something of a shot across the bow of modern physics.</p><p>Fellow physicists, she contends, "have come up with very narrow notions of beauty, which they derived from things that worked in the past."</p><p>"It's all well and fine. It's worth a try," she says. "But now they've gotten stuck on it. This is why you see so many ideas that fail over and over again."</p>
      <hr>
      <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu4mH3Hmw2o">Youtube Video</a></p><hr><p>In her mind, one such failure has been the effort to explain dark matter, the so-far undetected and unexplained <em>something </em>that makes up a large percentage of the universe. "At the point where we are now, it's pretty clear that it can't be a simple story. It's got to be something more complicated than some kind of new particle," she says.</p><p>To be sure, Hossenfelder, 47,<strong> </strong>isn't the only physicist wondering aloud how far the standard model of particle physics can be pushed in the service of dark matter. She describes herself as "pretty much a voice in the wilderness," but some others, such as astrophysicist Pavel Kroupa, have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LN2Ggg723uc&amp;t=325s">publicly expressed similar skepticism</a>.</p><p>Patricia Rankin, who chairs the department of physics at Arizona State University, says that while she doesn't entirely agree with Hossenfelder's views on physics, "I'm definitely in sympathy with a lot of what she says about it being important to actually delineate what science can and can't tell us." She praises Hossenfelder for "[challenging] people's assumptions ... because that's really what science is all about."</p><p>Stacy McGaugh, a professor of astronomy at Case Western Reserve University, met Hossenfelder at a conference several years ago, where they were both on the roster of speakers. They discovered a shared view on many issues, including that the gaping hole in physics left by dark matter might be at least partially filled by a modified theory of gravity. The two have since collaborated on multiple scientific papers. "She's very frank and plainspoken and is not afraid to speak her mind. And that's great," McGaugh says.</p>
      <hr><p>
      Related Story: <a href="https://text.npr.org/588833582">Did Dark Matter Make The Early Universe Chill Out?</a></p><hr><p>That frankness has placed her at odds with some big guns of science, including Don Lincoln, a physicist and researcher at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab) outside of Chicago. Unlike Hossenfelder, his work is focused on the experimental side of cutting-edge physics. Lincoln, a fixture on Fermilab's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCfRa7MXBEsoJuAM8s6D8oKDPyBepBosS">YouTube channel</a>, co-discovered the <a href="https://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/200204/history.cfm">top quark</a> in 1995 and was <a href="https://www.dispatch.com/story/news/technology/2012/07/05/scientists-discover-god-particle/24065832007/">part of the team</a> in 2012 that discovered the Higgs boson at Europe's Large Hadron Collider. He and Hossenfelder have occasionally sparred online, he says.</p><p>"It's not like we are mortal enemies or anything like that," he's careful to point out. But in a recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZgyFghqkHg">episode</a> of <em>Science without the gobbledygook</em>, Hossenfelder took experimental scientists to task for their pursuit of ever-larger, more-powerful and expensive colliders that she believes have little prospect of making important new discoveries.</p><p>Lincoln, however, says there are good reasons to believe that dark matter will turn out to be previously unseen particles and not some modified form of gravity. "Most cosmologists would say that while it's true that these modified motion and modified gravity theories can be made to work pretty well on the size of rotating galaxies, or the size of clusters of galaxies, where they fail is on the truly cosmic scale," he says.</p>
      <hr>
      <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-jIplX6Wjw">Youtube Video</a></p><hr><p>Hossenfelder has also staked out a number of contentious and not-so-contentious positions through her writings and more than 300 YouTube videos:</p><p>Artificial intelligence? "It's going to make a lot of things much more consumer friendly. And mostly I think it's a good thing." </p><p>Climate change? "I don't think it's an existential threat. Not by itself, but it's a threat multiplier." </p><p>Hossenfelder also "totally believes" in extraterrestrial intelligence. "I would say abundant in the universe. But abundant in our galaxy? I don't know."</p><h3>"If I had time, I would probably be on TikTok"</h3><p>On a parallel track to her science channel, Hossenfelder has produced an eclectic mix of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@SabineHossenfelderMusicVideos">music videos</a>, ranging from Beethoven's <em>Ode to Joy</em> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxLGUKRNHXM">a cover of "Galaxy Song"</a> from the 1983 Monty Python film <em>The Meaning of Life</em>. She learned most of it at YouTube University. "I am mostly interested in audio mixing. I have a thing for quirky sound effects and synths and echoes and reverb and all kinds of distortions," she says.</p><p>Juggling the roles of scientist and content creator with her personal life — she lives with her husband and has twin daughters in their early teens — can be a bit overwhelming, she acknowledges. Besides YouTube, she's on Substack and also <a href="https://www.listennotes.com/top-podcasts/sabine-hossenfelder/">hosts a podcast.</a> "If I had the time, I would probably be on TikTok, but at the moment I just can't do it," Hossenfelder says.</p><p>It's more acceptable nowadays to be both a scientist and someone who explains science to the public, she says. Giants such as the late Carl Sagan — and, more recently, Neil deGrasse Tyson — have helped pave the way. But among her fellow scientists, "there's still this line of thought that Sabine is not doing research anymore ... that she's now doing YouTube," Hossenfelder says.</p><p>"Basically I don't care. I do my thing," she says.</p><p>McGaugh, Hossenfelder's collaborator and co-author, expresses concern that her heavy commitment to social media might inevitably crowd out her research. "I can see the pressures," he admits. "But Sabine so far has managed to do both."</p><p>Arizona State's Rankin says Hossenfelder's efforts to fund her own research, while unusual today, hark back to an era when gentlemen scientists put up their own money to build scientific instruments, such as telescopes, and pay for scientific expeditions. "But then ... it was like you just couldn't afford to do science unless you were funded through a federal government," Rankin says.<strong> </strong></p><p>It remains to be seen whether others follow Hossenfelder's lead. Regardless, she's continuing to build her brand with plans to add quizzes to go with the YouTube videos that she hopes will "help with understanding the material."</p><p>Last year, she published her second book, <em>Existential Physics: A Scientist's Guide to Life's Biggest Questions</em>. And she's working on two new scientific papers.</p><p>While the gender divide in physics is marginally less stark in Germany than in America — by <a href="https://phys.org/news/2021-07-women-physics-humanity.html">one estimate, a quarter</a> of Ph.D.s in physics are women there, while it's <a href="https://www.aip.org/statistics/reports/trends-physics-phds-171819">only about a fifth in the U.S.</a> — Hossenfelder eschews the "role model" label. </p><p>"I'm a sarcastic, annoying, permanently grumpy middle-aged woman, and no one in their right mind should strive to be anything like me," she says.</p>

Teachers agree. Nearly half of those surveyed in the reports said they thought filtering technology left students siloed away from content that “will help them learn as a student” or “grow as a person.”</p><p>Both teachers and students say filtering originally intended to target adult content is instead being used by some school administrators to block LGBTQ+ and race-related content they deem “inappropriate.” Disciplinary action and punishment for violations aren’t experienced at the same rates for all students. The report found students who identify as LGBTQ+ and those with disabilities in individualized education programs were more likely to get in trouble due to the tools. 19% of students at schools that use filtering technology say they were even aware of students who were “outed” for LGBTQ+ as a result of the filtering. That’s up six percentage points from the 2021-2022 school year.</p><p>“Students at Title I schools, students with disabilities, and LGBTQ+ students continue to bear the brunt of irresponsible data and technology use and policies in the classroom and at home,” CDT Director of the Equity in Civic Technology Project Elizabeth Laird said in a statement. “This is alarming given that schools say they use technologies to keep all students safe and enhance their learning experience.”</p><p>AI-enabled activity monitoring software that tracks students’ online activity is similarly altering students’ day-to-day lives.

To make $45K/month as an employee is not an easy task, I would have to be extremely good at coding (and also office politics!).</p><p>The learnings are also one of the benefits.</p><p>Running a company requires a wide range of skills that I learned along the way: marketing, legal, finance, partnership, sales, etc.</p><p>Even thought I’m at a very small scale, I feel much more confident talking about business now compared to when I was just an employee doing what being told.</p><p><strong>The cold start</strong></p><p>Nothing comes for free. It could be very challenging and stressful to find a product and make it work, especially in the beginning.</p><p>I always tell people not to quit their job without a stable revenue each month, a lot of savings, and backup plans.</p><p>Working on side projects while having a full-time job can be stressful too. I was lucky because I haven’t yet have a family and only need to take care of myself. For people who have a full-time job, wife, and kids, there isn’t much time and energy left to work on side projects. The risk factor is also much larger in case of failure.</p><p><strong>The risks</strong></p><p>Even when you have a successful product, the risks still remain.</p><p>Revenue may fluctuate, the market may change, new competitors showing up, or maybe you do something stupid. It could affect the business and so affects you.</p><p>Look at what happened to Black Magic, if I couldn’t managed to get the new product (Typing Mind) generating a new revenue stream for me at the time, I would be extremely stressed, which can cause a spiral downturn, who knows.</p><p>This is also the reason why I prefer to have multiple products, to reduce the risk of one dying.</p><p><strong>The social life</strong></p><p>I had to sacrifice my professional network and social life. It gets very lonely.</p><p>When I quit my job, I didn’t think this would be a big problem, so I didn’t really paying attention to keeping my connections with people around me.</p><p>Now I’m starting to build the back connections, but it’s difficult to keep in touch with people when you no longer work in the same office and have the same topics to talk about.</p><p>My friends all have a full-time jobs, not a lot of indie hacker friends around me and they all have different favorite country/city to live. My best option if I want to fix this is to move to some popular indie hubs around the world like Bali or Lisbon, but I still think this isn’t going to work long-term.</p><p>It’s just the trade off I have to make going on this path. Lucky for me at least I still have the online Twitter community to hang out with.</p><p>So that’s my entire story from the very beginning.</p><p>What’s next? I don’t really know.</p><p>Right now, I don’t have a long-term plan. I only have a general guideline that I live to: stay healthy, make more money by doing things that I’m interested in, all of that while not sacrificing my freedom.</p><p>Work and enjoy life at the same time.</p><p>As for short-term plan, I’ll keep working on my products: Typing Mind (current focus), DevUtils, Xnapper. Maybe even a new product in the near future!</p><p>I hope this post will be helpful for anyone want to pursue the same path.</p><p>If you are looking to do the same thing as I did, here are some of my key takeaways:</p><ul><li><p>First and foremost, keep in mind that all of this is my story, “my way”. It’s definitely not the “only way”, and probably not “the best way”. All you can do is to cherry pick what I shared here and see if it works for you. There is no formula to guarantee success.</p></li><li><p>If you plan to work alone like me, try to become a generalist: know a bit of everything. For example, if you are a developer, don’t restrict yourself to only work as a frontend dev, try to develop in backend too, and mobile apps, and design, then also learn marketing, etc. Make use of the 80/20 rule: use 20% of your effort to capture 80% of the value.</p></li><li><p>Build unfair advantages for yourself. I considered my coding skills as an unfair advantage. I can build apps very fast because I’ve been doing it for years. If you don’t have any unfair advantages, find it or build it today.</p></li><li><p>Build an audience. This is not for everyone, but if you can, give it a try. Build an audience or a community of your own on Twitter/Reddit/internet forums. Anything you do later will be much more easier. The benefit is compounded. I built an audience of 97K followers on Twitter over the past 2 years and now that’s one of my unfair advantages too.</p></li><li><p>Ship early, ship small, ship frequently. Don’t stuck on one idea for too long if it doesn’t work. Practice shipping products more frequently to build “muscle memory”.</p></li><li><p>When building product: focus on the core value it brings to the customer. Practice viewing the product from customer point-of-view to avoid over-engineering. Talk to your customers and involve them to your building process.</p></li><li><p>Be patient and be prepared for luck. It’s a long term game.</p></li></ul><p><span>That’s all I have to share for now.

        <p>
            We expose a surprising failure of generalization in auto-regressive large language models (LLMs). If a model is trained on a sentence of the form "A is B", it will not automatically generalize to the reverse direction "B is A". This is the Reversal Curse. For instance, if a model is trained on "Olaf Scholz was the ninth Chancellor of Germany", it will not automatically be able to answer the question, "Who was the ninth Chancellor of Germany?". Moreover, the likelihood of the correct answer ("Olaf Scholz") will not be higher than for a random name. Thus, models exhibit a basic failure of logical deduction and do not generalize a prevalent pattern in their training set (i.e. if "A is B'' occurs, "B is A" is more likely to occur). We provide evidence for the Reversal Curse by finetuning GPT-3 and Llama-1 on fictitious statements such as "Uriah Hawthorne is the composer of 'Abyssal Melodies'" and showing that they fail to correctly answer "Who composed 'Abyssal Melodies?'". The Reversal Curse is robust across model sizes and model families and is not alleviated by data augmentation. We also evaluate ChatGPT (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) on questions about real-world celebrities, such as "Who is Tom Cruise's mother? [A: Mary Lee Pfeiffer]" and the reverse "Who is Mary Lee Pfeiffer's son?". GPT-4 correctly answers questions like the former 79% of the time, compared to 33% for the latter. This shows a failure of logical deduction that we hypothesize is caused by the Reversal Curse. Code is available at https://github.com/lukasberglund/reversal_curse.

<p><strong>tl;dr</strong> the brand new State of HTML survey is finally open!</p>
<p><a href="https://survey.devographics.com/en-US/survey/state-of-html/2023/?source=leaverou" target="_blank">Take State of HTML 2023 Survey</a></p>
<p>Benefits to you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Survey results are <strong>used by browsers to prioritize roadmaps</strong> — the reason Google is funding this.
Time spent thoughtfully filling them out is an investment that can come back to you tenfold
in the form of seeing features you care about implemented, browser incompatibilities being prioritized, and gaps in the platform being addressed.</li>
<li>Learn about new and upcoming features you may have missed</li>
<li>Get a personalized score and see how you compare to other respondents</li>
<li>Learn about the latest trends in the ecosystem and what other developers are focusing on</li>
</ul>

</figure>
<h2 id="background" tabindex="-1"><a href="#background">Background</a></h2>
<p>This is likely the most ambitious <a href="https://www.devographics.com/">Devographics</a> survey to date.
For <a href="https://lea.verou.me/blog/2023/design-state-of-html/">the past couple of months</a>, I’ve been hard at work leading a small product team spread across three continents (2am to 8am became my second work shift 😅).
We embarked on this mission with some uncertainty about whether there were <em>enough</em> features for a State of HTML survey,
but quickly found ourselves with the opposite problem:
there were too many, all with good reasons for inclusion!
To help weigh the tradeoffs and decide what makes the cut we consulted both <a href="https://github.com/Devographics/surveys/discussions/categories/state-of-html-2023-features?discussions_q=is%3Aopen+category%3A%22State+of+HTML+2023+Features%22+sort%3Atop">the developer community</a>,
as well as stakeholders across browsers, standards groups, community groups, and more.</p>
<p>We even designed new UI controls to facilitate collecting the types of complex data that were needed without making the questions too taxing,
and did original UX research to validate them.
Once the dust settles, I plan to write separate blog posts about some of these.</p>
<h2 id="faq" tabindex="-1"><a href="#faq">FAQ</a></h2>
<h3 id="can-i-edit-my-responses%3F" tabindex="-1"><a href="#can-i-edit-my-responses%3F">Can I edit my responses?</a></h3>
<p><strong>Absolutely!</strong> Do not worry about filling it out perfectly in one go.
If you create an account, you can edit your responses for the whole period the survey is open, and even split filling it out across multiple devices (e.g. start on your phone, then fill out some on your desktop, etc.)
Even if you’re filling it out anonymously, you can still edit responses on your device for a while.
You could even start anonymously and create an account later, and your responses will be preserved (the only issue is filling it out anonymously, then logging in with an existing account).</p>
<p>So, perhaps the call to action above should be…</p>
<p><a href="https://survey.devographics.com/en-US/survey/state-of-html/2023/?source=leaverou" target="_blank"><em>Start</em> State of HTML 2023 Survey</a></p>
<h3 id="why-are-there-js-questions-in-an-html-survey%3F" tabindex="-1"><a href="#why-are-there-js-questions-in-an-html-survey%3F">Why are there JS questions in an HTML survey?</a></h3>
<p>For the same reason there are JS APIs in the <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/">HTML standard</a>:
many JS APIs are intrinsically related to HTML.
We mainly included JS APIs in the following areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>APIs used to manipulate HTML dynamically (DOM, form validation, etc.)</li>
<li>Web Components APIs, used to create custom HTML elements</li>
<li>APIs used to create web apps that feel like native apps (e.g. Service Workers, Web App Manifest, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you don’t write any JS, we absolutely still want to hear from you!
In fact, I would encourage you to fill out the survey <strong>even more</strong>: we need to hear from folks who don’t write JS, as they are often underrepresented.
Please feel free to skip any JS-related questions (all questions are optional anyway) or select that you have never heard these features.
There is a question at the end, where you can select that you only write HTML/CSS:</p>
<p><img src="https://lea.verou.me/blog/2023/state-of-html-2023/images/html-js-balance.png" alt="Question about HTML/CSS and JS balance"></p>
<h3 id="is-the-survey-only-available-in-english%3F" tabindex="-1"><a href="#is-the-survey-only-available-in-english%3F">Is the survey only available in English?</a></h3>
<p>Absolutely not! Localization has been an integral part of these surveys since the beginning.
Fun fact: Nobody in the core <a href="#acknowledgements">State of HTML team</a> is a native English speaker.</p>
<figure>
<p><img src="https://lea.verou.me/blog/2023/state-of-html-2023/images/languages.png" alt="Screenshot showing dozens of languages"></p>
<figcaption>
<p>Each survey gets (at least partially) translated to over 30 languages.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>However, since translations are a community effort, they are not necessarily complete, especially in the beginning.
If you are a native speaker of a language that is not yet complete, please consider <a href="https://github.com/Devographics/locale-en-US">helping out</a>!</p>
<h3 id="why-is-my-score-lower-than-i-expected%3F" tabindex="-1"><a href="#why-is-my-score-lower-than-i-expected%3F">Why is my score lower than I expected?</a></h3>
<figure>
<p><img src="https://lea.verou.me/blog/2023/state-of-html-2023/images/my-score.png" alt="80% score, 105/131 heard or used"></p>
<figcaption>
<p>If it makes you feel better, this was my own score, and I <em>created</em> the darn survey 😅
Our engineer, <a href="https://sachagreif.com/">Sacha</a> who is also the founder of <a href="https://www.devographics.com/">Devographics</a> got 19%!</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>It asks about <em>a lot</em> of cutting edge features, more than the other surveys.
As I mentioned above, we had a lot of difficult tradeoffs to make,
and had to cut a ton of features that were otherwise a great fit.
We err’ed on the side of more cutting edge features, as those are the areas the survey can help make the most difference in the ecosystem.</li>
<li>To save on space, and be able to ask about more features, we used a new compact format for some of the more stable features, which only asks about usage, not awareness.
Here is an example from the first section of the survey (Forms):
<img src="https://lea.verou.me/blog/2023/state-of-html-2023/images/form-validation.png" alt="Form validation question screenshot">
This has the downside that features you do know about but haven’t used do not count towards the final score.</li>
</ol>
<p>We are <a href="https://github.com/Devographics/surveys/discussions/217">exploring ways to improve this experience</a>, such as displaying a rank among other respondents,
and/or displaying separate usage and awareness scores that combine to form the overall score.</p>
<h3 id="i-found-a-bug%2C-what-should-i-do%3F" tabindex="-1"><a href="#i-found-a-bug%2C-what-should-i-do%3F">I found a bug, what should I do?</a></h3>
<p>Please file an issue so we can fix it!</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="acknowledgements" tabindex="-1"><a href="#acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</a></h2>
<p>This survey would not have been possible without the hard work of many people.
Besides myself (Lea Verou), this includes the rest of the team:</p>
<ul>
<li>Engineering team: Sacha Greif, Eric Burel</li>
<li>UX research &amp; data science team: Shaine Rosewel Matala, Michael Quiapos, Gio Vernell Quiogue</li>
<li>Our logo designer, <a href="https://chriskirknielsen.com/">Chris Kirk-Nielsen</a></li>
</ul>
<p>And several volunteers:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://tink.uk/">Léonie Watson</a> for accessibility feedback</li>
<li>Our usability testing participants</li>
<li>…and all folks who provided early feedback throuhgout the process</li>
</ul>
<p>Last but not least, <strong>Kadir Topal</strong> made the survey possible in the first place, by proposing it and securing funding from Google.</p>
<p>Thank you all! 🙏🏼</p>

    <p>Large generative models (e.g., large language models, diffusion models) have shown remarkable performance, but they require a massive amount of computational resources. To make them more accessible, it is crucial to improve their efficiency.</p>

<p>This course will introduce efficient AI computing techniques that enable powerful deep learning applications on resource-constrained devices. Topics include model compression, pruning, quantization, neural architecture search, distributed training, data/model parallelism, gradient compression, and on-device fine-tuning. It also introduces application-specific acceleration techniques for large language models, diffusion models, video recognition, and point cloud. This course will also cover topics about quantum machine learning. Students will get hands-on experience deploying large language models (e.g., LLaMA 2) on a laptop.</p>

<p>The slides and lab assignments from the last semester are available for access <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/0ftluqbd1afzqpy/AADqxwkYrt1FbGnSQ4KP3Kpva?dl=0">here</a>.</p>

<p dir="auto"><code>croc</code> is a tool that allows any two computers to simply and securely transfer files and folders. AFAIK, <em>croc</em> is the only CLI file-transfer tool that does <strong>all</strong> of the following:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>allows <strong>any two computers</strong> to transfer data (using a relay)</li>
<li>provides <strong>end-to-end encryption</strong> (using PAKE)</li>
<li>enables easy <strong>cross-platform</strong> transfers (Windows, Linux, Mac)</li>
<li>allows <strong>multiple file</strong> transfers</li>
<li>allows <strong>resuming transfers</strong> that are interrupted</li>
<li>local server or port-forwarding <strong>not needed</strong></li>
<li><strong>ipv6-first</strong> with ipv4 fallback</li>
<li>can <strong>use proxy</strong>, like tor</li>
</ul>

<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-usage" dir="auto"><a href="#usage">Usage</a></h2>
<p dir="auto">To send a file, simply do:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ croc send [file(s)-or-folder]
Sending 'file-or-folder' (X MB)
Code is: code-phrase"><pre><code>$ croc send [file(s)-or-folder]
Sending 'file-or-folder' (X MB)
Code is: code-phrase
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Then to receive the file (or folder) on another computer, you can just do</p>

<p dir="auto">The code phrase is used to establish password-authenticated key agreement (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password-authenticated_key_agreement" rel="nofollow">PAKE</a>) which generates a secret key for the sender and recipient to use for end-to-end encryption.</p>
<p dir="auto">There are a number of configurable options (see <code>--help</code>). A set of options (like custom relay, ports, and code phrase) can be set using <code>--remember</code>.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-custom-code-phrase" dir="auto"><a href="#custom-code-phrase">Custom code phrase</a></h3>
<p dir="auto">You can send with your own code phrase (must be more than 6 characters).</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="croc send --code [code-phrase] [file(s)-or-folder]"><pre><code>croc send --code [code-phrase] [file(s)-or-folder]
</code></pre></div>
<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-allow-overwriting-without-prompt" dir="auto"><a href="#allow-overwriting-without-prompt">Allow overwriting without prompt</a></h3>
<p dir="auto">By default, croc will prompt whether to overwrite a file. You can automatically overwrite files by using the <code>--overwrite</code> flag (recipient only). For example, receive a file to automatically overwrite:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="croc --yes --overwrite <code>"><pre><code>croc --yes --overwrite &lt;code&gt;
</code></pre></div>
<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-use-pipes---stdin-and-stdout" dir="auto"><a href="#use-pipes---stdin-and-stdout">Use pipes - stdin and stdout</a></h3>
<p dir="auto">You can pipe to <code>croc</code>:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="cat [filename] | croc send"><pre><code>cat [filename] | croc send
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">In this case <code>croc</code> will automatically use the stdin data and send and assign a filename like "croc-stdin-123456789". To receive to <code>stdout</code> at you can always just use the <code>--yes</code>  will automatically approve the transfer and pipe it out to <code>stdout</code>.</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="croc --yes [code-phrase] > out"><pre><code>croc --yes [code-phrase] &gt; out
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">All of the other text printed to the console is going to <code>stderr</code> so it will not interfere with the message going to <code>stdout</code>.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-send-text" dir="auto"><a href="#send-text">Send text</a></h3>
<p dir="auto">Sometimes you want to send URLs or short text. In addition to piping, you can easily send text with <code>croc</code>:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="croc send --text &quot;hello world&quot;"><pre><code>croc send --text "hello world"
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">This will automatically tell the receiver to use <code>stdout</code> when they receive the text so it will be displayed.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-use-a-proxy" dir="auto"><a href="#use-a-proxy">Use a proxy</a></h3>
<p dir="auto">You can use a proxy as your connection to the relay by adding a proxy address with <code>--socks5</code>. For example, you can send via a tor relay:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="croc --socks5 &quot;127.0.0.1:9050&quot; send SOMEFILE"><pre><code>croc --socks5 "127.0.0.1:9050" send SOMEFILE
</code></pre></div>
<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-change-encryption-curve" dir="auto"><a href="#change-encryption-curve">Change encryption curve</a></h3>
<p dir="auto">You can choose from several different elliptic curves to use for encryption by using the <code>--curve</code> flag. Only the recipient can choose the curve. For example, receive a file using the P-521 curve:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="croc --curve p521 <codephrase>"><pre><code>croc --curve p521 &lt;codephrase&gt;
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Available curves are P-256, P-348, P-521 and SIEC. P-256 is the default curve.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-change-hash-algorithm" dir="auto"><a href="#change-hash-algorithm">Change hash algorithm</a></h3>
<p dir="auto">You can choose from several different hash algorithms. The default is the <code>xxhash</code> algorithm which is fast and thorough. If you want to optimize for speed you can use the <code>imohash</code> algorithm which is even faster, but since it samples files (versus reading the whole file) it can mistakenly determine that a file is the same on the two computers transferring - though this is only a problem if you are syncing files versus sending a new file to a computer.</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="croc send --hash imohash SOMEFILE"><pre><code>croc send --hash imohash SOMEFILE
</code></pre></div>
<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-self-host-relay" dir="auto"><a href="#self-host-relay">Self-host relay</a></h3>
<p dir="auto">The relay is needed to staple the parallel incoming and outgoing connections. By default, <code>croc</code> uses a public relay but you can also run your own relay:</p>

<p dir="auto">By default it uses TCP ports 9009-9013. Make sure to open those up. You can customized the ports (e.g. <code>croc relay --ports 1111,1112</code>), but you must have a minimum of <strong>2</strong> ports for the relay. The first port is for communication and the subsequent ports are used for the multiplexed data transfer.</p>
<p dir="auto">You can send files using your relay by entering <code>--relay</code> to change the relay that you are using if you want to custom host your own.</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="croc --relay &quot;myrelay.example.com:9009&quot; send [filename]"><pre><code>croc --relay "myrelay.example.com:9009" send [filename]
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Note, when sending, you only need to include the first port (the communication port). The subsequent ports for data transfer will be transmitted back to the user from the relay.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-self-host-relay-docker" dir="auto"><a href="#self-host-relay-docker">Self-host relay (docker)</a></h4>
<p dir="auto">If it's easier you can also run a relay with Docker:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="docker run -d -p 9009-9013:9009-9013 -e CROC_PASS='YOURPASSWORD' schollz/croc"><pre><code>docker run -d -p 9009-9013:9009-9013 -e CROC_PASS='YOURPASSWORD' schollz/croc
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Be sure to include the password for the relay otherwise any requests will be rejected.</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="croc --pass YOURPASSWORD --relay &quot;myreal.example.com:9009&quot; send [filename]"><pre><code>croc --pass YOURPASSWORD --relay "myreal.example.com:9009" send [filename]
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Note: when including <code>--pass YOURPASSWORD</code> you can instead pass a file with the password, e.g. <code>--pass FILEWITHPASSWORD</code>.</p>

<p dir="auto">TG is a geometry library for C that is small, fast, and easy to use.
I designed it for programs that need real-time geospatial, such as geofencing, monitoring, and streaming analysis.</p>

</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-goals" dir="auto"><a href="#goals">Goals</a></h2>
<p dir="auto">The main goal of TG is to provide the fastest, most memory efficent geometry library for the purpose of monitoring spatial relationships, specifically operations like point-in-polygon and geometry intersect.</p>
<p dir="auto">It's a non-goal for TG to be a full GIS library. Consider <a href="https://libgeos.org/" rel="nofollow">GEOS</a> if you need GIS algorithms like generating a convex hull or voronoi diagram.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-performance" dir="auto"><a href="#performance">Performance</a></h2>
<p dir="auto">TG uses <a href="https://github.com/tidwall/tg/blob/main/docs/POLYGON_INDEXING.md">entirely new</a> indexing structures that speed up <a href="https://github.com/tidwall/tg/blob/main/docs/API.md#geometry-predicates">geometry predicates</a>. It can index more than 10GB per second of point data on modern hardware, while using less than 7% of additional memory, and can perform over 10 million point-in-polygon operations, even when using large polygons with over 10K points.</p>
<p dir="auto">The following benchmark provides an example of the point-in-polygon performance
of TG when using a large polygon. In this case of Brazil, which has 39K points.</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-using" dir="auto"><a href="#using">Using</a></h2>
<p dir="auto">Just drop the "tg.c" and "tg.h" files into your project.
Uses standard C11 so most modern C compilers should work.</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-programmer-notes" dir="auto"><a href="#programmer-notes">Programmer notes</a></h2>
<p dir="auto"><em>Check out the complete <a href="https://github.com/tidwall/tg/blob/main/docs/API.md">API</a> for detailed information.</em></p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-pure-functions" dir="auto"><a href="#pure-functions">Pure functions</a></h4>
<p dir="auto">TG library functions are thread-safe, reentrant, and (mostly) without side
effects.
The exception being with the use of malloc by some functions like
<a href="https://github.com/tidwall/tg/blob/main/docs/API.md#geometry-constructors">geometry constructors</a>.
In those cases, it's the programmer's responsibiilty to check the return value
before continuing.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="struct tg_geom *geom = tg_geom_new_point(-112, 33);
if (!geom) {
    // System is out of memory.
}"><pre><span>struct</span> <span>tg_geom</span> <span>*</span><span>geom</span> <span>=</span> <span>tg_geom_new_point</span>(<span>-112</span>, <span>33</span>);
<span>if</span> (!<span>geom</span>) {
    <span>// System is out of memory.</span>
}</pre></div>
<h4 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-fast-cloning" dir="auto"><a href="#fast-cloning">Fast cloning</a></h4>
<p dir="auto">The cloning of geometries, as with <a href="https://github.com/tidwall/tg/blob/main/docs/API.md#tg_geom_clone">tg_geom_clone()</a>, are
O(1) operations that use implicit sharing through an atomic reference counter.
Geometry constructors like <a href="https://github.com/tidwall/tg/blob/main/docs/API.md#tg_geom_new_polygon">tg_geom_new_polygon()</a> will
use this method under the hood to maintain references of its inputs.</p>
<p dir="auto">While this may only be an implementation detail, it's important for the
programmer to understand how TG uses memory and object references.</p>
<p dir="auto">For example:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="struct tg_geom *geom = tg_geom_new_polygon(exterior, holes, nholes);"><pre><span>struct</span> <span>tg_geom</span> <span>*</span><span>geom</span> <span>=</span> <span>tg_geom_new_polygon</span>(<span>exterior</span>, <span>holes</span>, <span>nholes</span>);</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Above, a new geometry "geom" was created and includes a cloned reference to the
<a href="https://github.com/tidwall/tg/blob/main/docs/API.md#tg_ring">tg_ring</a> "exterior" and all of the holes.</p>
<p dir="auto">Providing <code>TG_NOATOMICS</code> to the compiler will disable the use of atomics and
instead use non-atomic reference counters.</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="cc -DTG_NOATOMICS tg.c ..."><pre><code>cc -DTG_NOATOMICS tg.c ...
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Alternatively, the <a href="https://github.com/tidwall/tg/blob/main/docs/API.md#tg_geom_copy">tg_geom_copy()</a> method is available to perform a deep copy of the
geometry.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-avoid-memory-leaks" dir="auto"><a href="#avoid-memory-leaks">Avoid memory leaks</a></h4>
<p dir="auto">To avoid memory leaks, call <a href="https://github.com/tidwall/tg/blob/main/docs/API.md#tg_geom_free">tg_geom_free()</a> on geometries
created from <a href="https://github.com/tidwall/tg/blob/main/docs/API.md#geometry-constructors">geometry constructors</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/tidwall/tg/blob/main/docs/API.md#geometry-parsing">geometry parsers</a>, <a href="https://github.com/tidwall/tg/blob/main/docs/API.md#tg_geom_clone">tg_geom_clone()</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/tidwall/tg/blob/main/docs/API.md#tg_geom_copy">tg_geom_copy()</a></p>
<p dir="auto">In other words, for every <code>tg_geom_new_*()</code>, <code>tg_geom_parse_*()</code>,
<code>tg_geom_clone()</code>, and <code>tg_geom_copy()</code> there should be (eventually and exactly)
one <code>tg_geom_free()</code>.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-upcasting" dir="auto"><a href="#upcasting">Upcasting</a></h4>
<p dir="auto">The TG object types <a href="https://github.com/tidwall/tg/blob/main/docs/API.md#tg_line">tg_line</a>, <a href="https://github.com/tidwall/tg/blob/main/docs/API.md#tg_ring">tg_ring</a>, and
<a href="https://github.com/tidwall/tg/blob/main/docs/API.md#tg_poly">tg_poly</a> can be safely upcasted to a <a href="https://github.com/tidwall/tg/blob/main/docs/API.md#tg_geom">tg_geom</a> with no
cost at runtime.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="struct tg_geom *geom1 = (struct tg_geom*)line; // Cast tg_line to tg_geom

<p dir="auto">This allows for exposing all <a href="https://github.com/tidwall/tg/blob/main/docs/API.md#tg_geom">tg_geom</a> functions to the other
object types.</p>
<p dir="auto">In addition, the <a href="https://github.com/tidwall/tg/blob/main/docs/API.md#tg_ring">tg_ring</a> type can also cast to a
<a href="https://github.com/tidwall/tg/blob/main/docs/API.md#tg_poly">tg_poly</a>.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="struct tg_poly *poly = (struct tg_poly*)ring; // Cast tg_ring to tg_poly"><pre><span>struct</span> <span>tg_poly</span> <span>*</span><span>poly</span> <span>=</span> (<span>struct</span> <span>tg_poly</span><span>*</span>)<span>ring</span>; <span>// Cast tg_ring to tg_poly</span></pre></div>

<p dir="auto">The JPL Open Source Rover is an open source, build it yourself, scaled down version of the 6 wheel rover design that JPL uses to explore the surface of Mars. The Open Source Rover is designed entirely out of consumer off the shelf (COTS) parts. This project is intended to be a teaching and learning experience for those who want to get involved in mechanical engineering, software, electronics, robotics but is also an excellent research platform for rugged terrain. No prior skills or knowledge is required.</p>

<p dir="auto">The OSR mostly uses parts from <a href="https://www.gobilda.com/" rel="nofollow">GoBilda</a> for the mechanical assembly. For GoBilda's (international) shipping options, see <a href="https://www.gobilda.com/shipping-policy/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Other open-source, cheaper alternatives exist but are slower, less strong, and are more fragile. See <a href="#additional-projects">Additional Projects</a>.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-features" dir="auto"><a href="#features">Features</a></h3>
<p dir="auto">This rover is designed to function similarly to the 6 wheel rover designs on Mars and employs a few of the major driving mechanics that the mars rovers use to traverse rocky surfaces:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Rocker-Bogie:</strong> The Rocker-Bogie suspension system allows all 6 wheels to continually be in contact with the ground while climbing over obstacles</li>
<li><strong>Differential Pivot:</strong> Allows weight to be mechanically offloaded from one side of the rover to the other while climbing</li>
<li><strong>6-Wheel Ackerman Steering:</strong> Driving and steering/turning mechanism that governs where the wheels point and how fast each of them will move.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">A Raspberry Pi acts as the "brain" of this rover for its versatility, accessibility, simplicity, and ability to add and upgrade your own modifications. Any method with which you can communicate with a Raspberry Pi (bluetooth, WiFi, USB devices, etc) can be interfaced into the control system of the robot.</p>

<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-skills-necessary" dir="auto"><a href="#skills-necessary">Skills Necessary</a></h3>
<p dir="auto">This project has elements in mechanical assembly/fabrication, uses a host of electrical components, and has software that will run it all. In order to complete this project, you will need to have some experience in the following:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Fabrication/Machining:</strong> All parts are Consumer Off-The-Shelf (COTS) parts and <strong>no metal machining should be required</strong> to complete the 'base' version of the rover. However for any optional expansions, it may be useful to have access to the following skills/tools:
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Metal cutting using band saw/dremel</li>
<li>Drilling using drill press/hand drill</li>
<li>Filing and sanding for part cleanup</li>
<li>General Fabrication/Machining Safety</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Electronics:</strong> This project uses components like motors, motor controllers, and batteries. While prior experience with the following skills is not required, having access to someone who can help will save a lot of time:
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Soldering</li>
<li>Electrical debugging</li>
<li>Wiring</li>
<li>Electrical Safety</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Software:</strong> The rover's brain is a Raspberry Pi. All code can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/nasa-jpl/osr-rover-code">osr-rover-code</a> repository along with step-by-step instructions to set it up. Basic familiarity with Linux, ROS, Git, and Python will be helpful though.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Most of the above are skills that you can learn and pick up fairly quickly from watching videos and doing research on the internet, and throughout the project we try to give supplemental information on some of these as well. See the build documents for more information.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-tools-necessary" dir="auto"><a href="#tools-necessary">Tools Necessary</a></h3>
<p dir="auto">This project assumes you have some standard tools to help assemble the project. If you do not have any of the optional tools, we provide examples of online services that you can use to have the parts fabricated and sent to you.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-mandatory-tools" dir="auto"><a href="#mandatory-tools">Mandatory tools</a></h4>
<ul dir="auto">

</ul>
<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-expected-time-commitment" dir="auto"><a href="#expected-time-commitment">Expected time commitment</a></h3>
<p dir="auto">In our experience, this project takes no less than 100 person-hours to build, and depending on the familiarity and skill level of those involved could be significantly more. Experienced builders may be able to build this project in this amount of time.  However, this project is generally meant to be a teaching and learning tool.  Throughout the documentation, we try to give supplemental information for those who might be new to this kind of project.</p>

<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-rover-build-roadmap" dir="auto"><a href="#rover-build-roadmap">Rover Build Roadmap</a></h3>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Stage 1:</strong> <a href="#ordering-parts">Order parts</a>. You'll want to get started on this ASAP!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Stage 2:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/nasa-jpl/open-source-rover/blob/master/electrical/wiring/README.md">Create the wiring</a>. The cables connect the Printed Circuit Board (PCB) in the body to each motor and integrate into the rocker-bogie and corner assemblies so they need to be built first.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Stage 3:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/nasa-jpl/open-source-rover/blob/master/electrical/pcb/README.md">Make the electronics</a>: Soldering the PCB and installing into the rover along with peripheral connections. We'll also use the wiring to test your PCBs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Stage 4:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/nasa-jpl/open-source-rover/blob/master/mechanical/README.md">Make the mechanical assemblies</a>: the body, the two rocker-bogies, the drive and corner motor assemblies. The instructions will guide you through how to do these step by step while integrating the cabling from Stage 2. You'll then attach them into something that will start to look like a rover!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Stage 5:</strong> Setting up and configuring the operating system rover code. The <a href="https://github.com/nasa-jpl/osr-rover-code">Rover Code repo</a>'s README files will walk you through all necessary steps for getting the rover software up and running on the Raspberry Pi. These steps can be completed at any point during the project, all the way up to when all the electronics and mechanical parts are completed and you are ready to start driving and controlling the robot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>What's next?</strong> Add your own upgrades! We chose Raspberry Pi as the brain of the project so that it should be easy to add, change, and upgrade to build exciting things on top of this already cool robot.  Some upgrade ideas to get you brainstorming: sonar for collision detection, IMU for orientation / closed-loop driving / obstacle mapping, camera for object identification and tracking, sensor packages (temperature, pressure, humidity), solar panels, or even a robotic arm!</p>

<p dir="auto">The <a href="https://github.com/nasa-jpl/open-source-rover/blob/master/parts_list/README.md">Parts List Readme</a> contains all the parts necessary to build the entirety of the robot as it is listed in our documentation.</p>
<p dir="auto">You can select higher RPM motors (to drive your rover faster) at the sacrifice of max stall torque. A selection of motors that would integrate easily with the rest of the suggested rover design can be found at <a href="https://www.gobilda.com/yellow-jacket-planetary-gear-motors/" rel="nofollow">GoBilda - 5203 series</a>.
The rover design and the software can accommodate different wheel sizes if you find wheels you like better.</p>
<p dir="auto">The body plates that attach to all sides of the body are designed to be made from laser cut acrylic, MDF, hardwood, or similar. The 2D cutout files  are the .DXF files in the <a href="https://github.com/nasa-jpl/open-source-rover/blob/master/mechanical/body/dxf">laser cut parts folder</a>. They were designed to be around 3mm thick (1/8"). You can choose a material and cut them at your local makerspace's laser cutter or order them from an online service like <a href="https://www.sculpteo.com/" rel="nofollow">Sculpteo</a> or <a href="https://sendcutsend.com/" rel="nofollow">SendCutSend</a>.</p>
