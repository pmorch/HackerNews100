<p>As I’ve shared with family, friends and our team since late last year, I have made the decision to disband Hindenburg Research. The plan has been to wind up after we finished the pipeline of ideas we were working on. And as of the last Ponzi cases we just completed and are sharing with regulators, that day is today.</p>



<p>I write this from a place of joy. Building this has been a life’s dream.</p>



<p>I did not know at the outset if it would be possible to find a fulfilling path. This wasn’t an easy option, but I was naïve to the danger and felt drawn to it magnetically.</p>



<p>When I started this, I doubted I was capable. I didn’t have a traditional finance background. None of my relatives are in this field. I went to a state school. I’m not a slick salesperson. I don’t know any of the right clothes to wear. I can’t play golf. I’m not some superhuman that can function on 4 hours of sleep. In most of my jobs I was a good worker but mostly looked over. I had no money when I started—and after catching 3 lawsuits immediately out of the gate, I quickly had less than no money. I would have failed right at the starting line had it not been for the support of world-class whistleblower lawyer <a href="https://www.pugsleywood.com/lawyers/bryan-a-wood/">Bryan Wood</a>, who took the cases on despite my lack of financial resources. I had a newborn child and was facing eviction at the time. I was terrified, but knew that if I stayed still I would crumble. The only option I had was to keep moving forward.</p>



<p>It is very easy to succumb to negative thoughts and believe what others think of you, especially when things feel low. But it is possible to shatter all of that. I was passionate about this and I let that carry me forward despite my fears and insecurities.</p>



<p>And then this slowly started to flourish.</p>



<p>One at a time, and without a clear plan, we built a team of 11 incredible people. I hired each of them not because we needed workers, but because when our paths crossed and I could see who they were, I realized it was madness not to bring them on.</p>



<p>They are all smart, focused, and fun to work with. Little to no ego. When you meet them, they are all very nice and polite. But when it comes to this field, they are ruthless assassins, capable of world-class work. Like me, our team didn’t come from traditional finance backgrounds. My first hire often describes himself as a former bartender. We all have a shared view of the world, a mostly calm exterior, and a similar burning underlying intensity. They are all family to me.</p>



<p>We have all worked extremely hard, with a focus on precision and letting the evidence dictate our words.</p>



<p>Sometimes this meant taking big swings and taking on fights that are much bigger than any of us as individuals. Fraud, corruption, and negativity often seem overwhelming. Early on, a sense of justice was usually elusive. When it happened, it was tremendously fulfilling. It kept us going when we needed it.</p>



<p>And boy did we have an impact, eventually—more than I imagined was possible at the outset. Nearly 100 individuals have been charged civilly or criminally by regulators at least in part through our work, including billionaires and oligarchs. We shook some empires that we felt needed shaking.</p>



<p>Over time, people began to see what I hoped we could show—that having an impact is possible, no matter who you are.</p>



<p>It has also been rather intense, and at times, all-encompassing. I often wake up from my dreams because I’ve thought of a new investigative thread to pull on in my sleep, or an edit that clarifies a point I didn’t realize I was troubled by during the day. Or from the general pressure of it all. We are not fearless—we just have faith in the truth and hope it leads us down the right path.</p>



<p>I’m grateful for all of it. We have days of bizarre, hilarious and ridiculous stories and we’ve had a lot of fun amidst the pressure and challenges. It has been the adventure of a lifetime.</p>



<p>So, why disband now? There is not one specific thing—no particular threat, no health issue, and no big personal issue.</p>



<p>Someone once told me that at a certain point a successful career becomes a selfish act. Early on, I felt I needed to prove some things to myself. I have now finally found some comfort with myself, probably for the first time in my life. I probably could have had it all along had I let myself, but I needed to put myself through a bit of hell first. The intensity and focus has come at the cost of missing a lot of the rest of the world and the people I care about. I now view Hindenburg as a chapter in my life, not a central thing that defines me.</p>



<p>Beyond my own desire for relief, it also feels selfish to keep the knowledge we’ve accumulated trapped within our small team. I have more than enough. In the past several years we’ve been flooded with thousands of messages from many of you asking how we do what we do, or whether you can join the team. I read them all and I’ve been trying to figure out how to respond in a way that can answer everyone—so over the next 6 months or so I plan to work on a series of materials and videos to open-source every aspect of our model and how we conduct our investigations.</p>



<p>My hope is that after we fully share our process, in a couple years I will get an unsolicited message from someone who reads this (maybe you), who embraces the same passion, learns the craft, and finds the confidence to shed some light on a subject that needs it, despite the obstacles in your way. That would make my day, even if I’m off trying to learn music or planting a garden or whatever I end up doing next.</p>



<p>For now, I will be focused on making sure everyone on our team lands where they want to be next. Some are going to start their own research firm, which I will strongly and publicly encourage, even as I will have no personal involvement. There are others on our team who are now free agents—so feel free to reach out to me if you have a need for anyone who is brilliant, focused, and easy to work with, as they all are.</p>



<p>It wasn’t always obvious to me, but I now view all of this as a love story. To my wife, you have been so patient with me. It has not been easy, to put it mildly, and I am forever grateful that you have sacrificed so much and pushed forward with me. And now, my dear, we get to enjoy it together for as long as this world will let us.</p>



<p>To my family and friends, I’m sorry for the times I have ignored you while I let my attention be drawn away. I can’t wait to have more time to share with you together.</p>



<p>Lastly, I want to express how grateful I am to our readers. Your messages of kindness and encouragement through the years have gone a long way to help give us the strength to continue. And it constantly reminds me that the world is filled with good. Thank you for all of it—I couldn’t ask for more. It is all a blessing.</p>



<p>With unfathomable levels of gratitude,</p>



<p>Nate Anderson </p>







<p>(P.S. If you are chasing something you think you want or need, or are doubting whether you are enough, take a minute and give this a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h96MGcsi7GQ">listen</a>. It had a big impact on me at a pivotal time.)</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://cerebras.ai/blog/100x-defect-tolerance-how-cerebras-solved-the-yield-problem">https://cerebras.ai/blog/100x-defect-tolerance-how-cerebras-solved-the-yield-problem</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42717165">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-parent="true" id="row-unique-1"><div><p>Conventional wisdom in semiconductor manufacturing has long held that bigger chips mean worse yields. Yet at Cerebras, we’ve successfully built and commercialized a chip 50x larger than the largest computer chips – and achieved comparable yields. This seeming paradox is one of our most frequently asked questions: how do we achieve a usable yield with a wafer-scale processor?</p>
<p>The answer lies in rethinking the relationship between chip size and fault tolerance. This article will provide a detailed, apples-to-apples comparison of manufacturing yields between the Cerebras Wafer Scale Engine and an H100-sized chip, both manufactured at 5nm. By examining the interplay between defect rates, core size, and fault tolerance, we’ll show how we achieve wafer scale integration with equal or better yields vs. reticle limited GPUs.</p>
<h3>What determines yield</h3>
<p>Like any manufacturing process, computer chips are prone to defects. Larger chips are more likely to encounter defects, thus as chips grow in size, yields fall exponentially with increasing die area. Even though larger chips generally run faster, early microprocessors were built to a modest size to maintain acceptable manufacturing yields and profit margins. In the early 2000s, this started to change. As transistor budgets grew to over 100 million, it became the norm to build processors with multiple independent cores per chip. Since all the cores were identical and independent, chip designers built-in core-level fault tolerance so that if one core suffered a defect, the remaining cores could still operate. For example in 2006 Intel released the Intel Core Duo – a chip with two CPU cores. If one core was faulty, it was disabled and the product was sold as an Intel Core Solo. Nvidia, AMD, and others all embraced this core-level redundancy in the coming years.</p>
</div><div><p><img decoding="async" src="https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-table-01-scaled.jpg" width="2560" height="919" alt="" srcset="https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-table-01-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-table-01-300x108.jpg 300w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-table-01-1024x368.jpg 1024w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-table-01-768x276.jpg 768w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-table-01-1536x551.jpg 1536w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-table-01-2048x735.jpg 2048w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-table-01-350x126.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px"></p>
					</div><div><p>Today, fault tolerance is widely used by high performance processors and it’s perfectly normal to sell chips with some cores disabled. AMD and Intel CPUs generally ship a flagship version with all cores enabled and a lower end version with a portion of cores disabled. Nvidia’s data center GPUs are substantially larger than CPU dies and as a result even its flagship models have some portion of cores disabled.</p>
<p>Take the Nvidia H100 – a massive GPU weighing in at 814mm<sup>2</sup>. Traditionally this chip would be very difficult to yield economically. But since its cores (SMs) are fault tolerant, a manufacturing defect does not knock out the entire product. The chip physically has 144 SMs but the commercialized product only has 132 SMs active. This means the chip could suffer numerous defects across 12 SMs and still be sold as a flagship part.</p>
<h3>Defect tolerance is the key to yield</h3>
<p>Traditionally, chip size directly dictated chip yields. In the modern era, yield is a function of both chip size and defect tolerance. 800mm<sup>2</sup> chips were once thought infeasible to commercialize due to yield, but by using defect tolerant design, they are now mainstream products.</p>
<p>The degree of defect tolerance can be measured by the amount of chip area that is lost when a defect occurs. For multi-core chips, this means the smaller the core, the greater the defect tolerance. If individual cores are small enough, it may be possible to build a very large chip.</p>
<h3>Wafer Scale Engine Cores</h3>
</div><div><p><img decoding="async" src="https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-wafer-scale-01.jpg" width="1640" height="862" alt="" srcset="https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-wafer-scale-01.jpg 1640w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-wafer-scale-01-300x158.jpg 300w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-wafer-scale-01-1024x538.jpg 1024w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-wafer-scale-01-768x404.jpg 768w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-wafer-scale-01-1536x807.jpg 1536w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-wafer-scale-01-350x184.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 1640px) 100vw, 1640px"></p>
					</div><div><p>At Cerebras, before committing to build a wafer-scale chip, we first designed a very small core. Each AI core in the Wafer Scale Engine 3 is approximately 0.05mm<sup>2</sup> or about 1% the size of an H100 SM core. Both core designs are fault tolerant. This means a defect in a WSE core would disable 0.05mm<sup>2</sup> of silicon while the same defect in an H100 disables ~6mm<sup>2</sup>. To a first order of approximation, the wafer scale engine is ~100x more fault tolerant than a GPU when considering the silicon area affected by each defect.</p>
<h3>The Routing Architecture</h3>
</div><div><p><img decoding="async" src="https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-defects-01-scaled.jpg" width="2560" height="2050" alt="" srcset="https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-defects-01-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-defects-01-300x240.jpg 300w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-defects-01-1024x820.jpg 1024w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-defects-01-768x615.jpg 768w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-defects-01-1536x1230.jpg 1536w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-defects-01-2048x1640.jpg 2048w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-defects-01-350x280.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px"></p>
					</div><div><p>But small cores alone aren’t enough. We developed a sophisticated routing architecture that allows us to dynamically reconfigure connections between cores. When a defect is detected, the system can automatically route around it using redundant communication pathways, preserving the chip’s overall computational capabilities by leveraging nearby cores.</p>
<p>This routing system works in concert with a small reserve of spare cores that can be used to replace defective units. Unlike previous approaches that required massive redundancy overhead, our architecture achieves high yield with minimal spare capacity through intelligent routing.</p>
<h3>A wafer scale walkthrough</h3>
<p>Defect tolerance at a chip level is fairly clear. Let’s now compare how a traditional GPU and a wafer-scale chip would yield using TSMC 5nm’s 300mm wafer:</p>
</div><div><p><img decoding="async" src="https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-GPUs-per-wafer-01.png" width="2146" height="1144" alt="" srcset="https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-GPUs-per-wafer-01.png 2146w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-GPUs-per-wafer-01-300x160.png 300w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-GPUs-per-wafer-01-1024x546.png 1024w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-GPUs-per-wafer-01-768x409.png 768w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-GPUs-per-wafer-01-1536x819.png 1536w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-GPUs-per-wafer-01-2048x1092.png 2048w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-GPUs-per-wafer-01-350x187.png 350w" sizes="(max-width: 2146px) 100vw, 2146px"></p>
					</div><div><p>On the left is a H100-like GPU: it is 814mm<sup>2</sup>, it has 144 fault tolerant cores, and a single 300mm wafer yields 72 full die chips. On the right we have the Cerebras Wafer Scale Engine 3. It’s one giant square measuring 46,225mm<sup>2</sup>. It has 970,000 fault tolerant cores. One wafer yields one chip.</p>
</div><div><p><img decoding="async" src="https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-table-02-scaled.jpg" width="2560" height="1071" alt="" srcset="https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-table-02-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-table-02-300x125.jpg 300w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-table-02-1024x428.jpg 1024w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-table-02-768x321.jpg 768w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-table-02-1536x642.jpg 1536w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-table-02-2048x856.jpg 2048w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-table-02-350x146.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px"></p>
					</div><div><p>At the current TSMC 5nm node, TSMC’s process <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/16028/better-yield-on-5nm-than-7nm-tsmc-update-on-defect-rates-for-n5"><span>reportedly</span></a> has ~0.001 defect per mm<sup>2</sup>. 72 GPU dies have total die area of 58,608mm<sup>2</sup>. Applying this defect density, this area would see a total of 59 defects. For simplicity, let’s assume each defect lands on a separate core. At 6.2mm<sup>2</sup> per core, this means 361mm<sup>2</sup> of die space would be lost of defects.</p>
<p>On the Cerebras side, the effective die size is a bit smaller at 46,225mm<sup>2</sup>. Applying the same defect rate, the WSE-3 would see 46 defects. Each core is 0.05mm<sup>2</sup>. This means 2.2mm<sup>2</sup> in total would be lost to defects.</p>
<p>Measuring the total area lost, the GPU in this case loses 164x more silicon area than the Wafer Scale Engine on an apple-to-apples basis on the same manufacturing node and defect rate.</p>
<p>The above makes a high-level point but simplifies a few details. First, not all areas of the chip are taken by the compute cores. Caches, memory controllers, and on-chip fabric take up a substantial amount of die size, perhaps up to 50%. However, these components can be designed to be fault tolerant in their own way. An H100 SM is likely smaller than 6.2mm<sup>2</sup> due to these components, though not by an order of magnitude. Second, a cluster of defects could overwhelm fault tolerant areas and disable the whole chip. In practice, even fault tolerant chips will not yield close to 100%. These caveats aside, the general rule that smaller cores make for greater fault tolerance still holds.</p>
<h3>Putting Cerebras in the Table</h3>
</div><div><p><img decoding="async" src="https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-table-03-scaled.jpg" width="2560" height="1029" alt="" srcset="https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-table-03-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-table-03-300x121.jpg 300w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-table-03-1024x412.jpg 1024w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-table-03-768x309.jpg 768w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-table-03-1536x617.jpg 1536w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-table-03-2048x823.jpg 2048w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-table-03-350x141.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px"></p>
					</div><div><p>Let’s revisit the first table, now with the Cerebras Wafer Scale Engine added. Like Nvidia’s data center GPUs, the WSE-3 is designed to be fault-tolerant and disables a portion of its cores to manage yield. Because our cores are so tiny, the number of cores is so much larger – 970,000 physical cores with 900,000 active on our current shipping product. This provides tremendous, fine grained, defect tolerance. Despite having built the world’s largest chip, we enable 93% of our silicon area, which is higher than the leading GPU today.</p>
<p>To summarize, Cerebras resolved the wafer scale manufacturing challenge by designing a small fault-tolerant core in combination with a fault tolerant on-chip fabric. While total chip area increased by ~50x compared to conventional GPUs, we reduced individual core size by ~100x. As a result, defects are far less damaging to the WSE than conventional multi-core processors. The third generation WSE engine achieves 93% silicon utilization – the highest among leading AI accelerators – demonstrating that wafer-scale computing is not just possible, but commercially viable at scale.</p>

<article>
    
   
    <div>
      <p><span>GARY</span>: Hey Cindy, remember the other day when we were talking about optimizations?</p>
<p><span>CINDY</span>: Yeah, I wanted to circle back on that.</p>
<p><span>GARY</span>: Me too. You said you wanted to see hockey-stick growth. Well, I’ve realized that I want to see hockey-stick growth too—in our relationship.</p>
<p><span>CINDY</span>: Unpack that for me.</p>
<p><span>GARY</span>: This relationship has been such a value-add. Some of my friends were worried that it would take too long for us to get into alignment. But you have been an absolute rockstar.</p>
<p><span>CINDY</span>: I feel the same way, Gary. The <span>ROI</span> on this relationship has been unbelievable. You’ve really given 110 percent.</p>
<p><span>GARY</span>: So I wanted to close the loop. In addition to the other deliverables, I have one more. (<i>He takes a knee, and holds out his hand</i>.) It’s this wedding ring. Cindy, will you marry me?</p>
<p><span>CINDY</span>: I will, Gary. You have been an absolute ninja. This moves the needle in a significant way.</p>
<p><span>GARY</span>: Getting married will represent a huge pivot, but I see it as a quick win, and a real solve.</p>
<p><span>CINDY</span>: Me too. And we can talk about this later, but—I do want to make sure we go forward with a single source of truth.</p>
<p><span>GARY</span>: Break that down for me.</p>
<p><span>CINDY</span>: I used to be with a guy who was full of valuable insights—but his insights weren’t actionable, let alone fundable.</p>
<p><span>GARY</span>: Sounds like low-hanging fruit.</p>
<p><span>CINDY</span>: He was. And I know you’re different. The synergy is unbelievable. But I want to make sure we stay focused on core values. Which, for me, comes down to the bottom line.</p>
<p><span>GARY</span>: By bottom line, you’re talking about the financials?</p>
<p><span>CINDY</span>: Not having enough spend was a big pain point for me. I don’t know how else to say it. You’re more than your financials, but you’re not less than them.</p>
<p>(<i>Long pause.</i>)</p>
<p><span>GARY</span>: I think I understand.</p>
<p><span>CINDY</span>: Just wanted to touch base on how you’re feeling about that.</p>
<p><span>GARY</span>: Well, look. We both know the importance of data-driven insights. So I think I’ve got a solve. What if we set up a weekly one-on-one to check in and stack hands on the financials as we start to plan for our new normal?</p>
<p><span>CINDY</span>: I would love that. But I’m so sorry, I have a three-thirty.</p>
<p><span>GARY</span>: Okay, let’s table this for now. In the meantime, if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask.</p>
<p><span>CINDY</span>: Sounds good. Let’s circle back tonight, and we can action on our solve.</p>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">When Should I Use Ropey?</h2><a id="user-content-when-should-i-use-ropey" aria-label="Permalink: When Should I Use Ropey?" href="#when-should-i-use-ropey"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Ropey is designed and built to be the backing text buffer for applications
such as text editors, and its design trade-offs reflect that.  Ropey is good
at:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Handling frequent edits to medium-to-large texts.  Even on texts that are
multiple gigabytes large, edits are measured in single-digit microseconds.</li>
<li>Handling Unicode correctly.  It is impossible to create invalid utf8 through
Ropey, and all Unicode line endings are correctly tracked including CRLF.</li>
<li>Having flat, predictable performance characteristics.  Ropey will never be
the source of hiccups or stutters in your software.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">On the other hand, Ropey is <em>not</em> good at:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Handling texts smaller than a couple of kilobytes or so.  That is to say,
Ropey will handle them fine, but Ropey allocates space in kilobyte chunks,
which introduces unnecessary bloat if your texts are almost always small.</li>
<li>Handling texts that are larger than available memory.  Ropey is an in-memory
data structure.</li>
<li>Getting the best performance for every possible use-case.  Ropey puts work
into tracking both line endings and unicode scalar values, which is
performance overhead you may not need depending on your use-case.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Keep this in mind when selecting Ropey for your project.  Ropey is very good
at what it does, but like all software it is designed with certain
applications in mind.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Features</h2><a id="user-content-features" aria-label="Permalink: Features" href="#features"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Strong Unicode support</h3><a id="user-content-strong-unicode-support" aria-label="Permalink: Strong Unicode support" href="#strong-unicode-support"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Ropey's atomic unit of text is
<a href="https://www.unicode.org/glossary/#unicode_scalar_value" rel="nofollow">Unicode scalar values</a>
(or <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.char.html" rel="nofollow"><code>char</code></a>s in Rust)
encoded as utf8.  All of Ropey's editing and slicing operations are done
in terms of char indices, which prevents accidental creation of invalid
utf8 data.</p>
<p dir="auto">Ropey also supports converting between scalar value indices and utf16 code unit
indices, for interoperation with external APIs that may still use utf16.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Line-aware</h3><a id="user-content-line-aware" aria-label="Permalink: Line-aware" href="#line-aware"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Ropey knows about line breaks, allowing you to index into and iterate over
lines of text.</p>
<p dir="auto">The line breaks Ropey recognizes are also configurable at build time via
feature flags.  See Ropey's documentation for details.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Rope slices</h3><a id="user-content-rope-slices" aria-label="Permalink: Rope slices" href="#rope-slices"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Ropey has rope slices that allow you to work with just parts of a rope, using
all the read-only operations of a full rope including iterators and making
sub-slices.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Flexible APIs with low-level access</h3><a id="user-content-flexible-apis-with-low-level-access" aria-label="Permalink: Flexible APIs with low-level access" href="#flexible-apis-with-low-level-access"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Although Ropey is intentionally limited in scope, it also provides APIs for
efficiently accessing and working with its internal text chunk
representation, allowing additional functionality to be efficiently
implemented by client code with minimal overhead.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Efficient</h3><a id="user-content-efficient" aria-label="Permalink: Efficient" href="#efficient"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Ropey is fast and minimizes memory usage:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>On a recent mobile i7 Intel CPU, Ropey performed over 1.8 million small
incoherent insertions per second while building up a text roughly 100 MB
large.  Coherent insertions (i.e. all near the same place in the text) are
even faster, doing the same task at over 3.3 million insertions per
second.</li>
<li>Freshly loading a file from disk only incurs about 10% memory overhead.  For
example, a 100 MB text file will occupy about 110 MB of memory when loaded
by Ropey.</li>
<li>Cloning ropes is <em>extremely</em> cheap.  Rope clones share data, so an initial
clone only takes 8 bytes of memory.  After that, memory usage will grow
incrementally as the clones diverge due to edits.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Thread safe</h3><a id="user-content-thread-safe" aria-label="Permalink: Thread safe" href="#thread-safe"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Ropey ensures that even though clones share memory, everything is thread-safe.
Clones can be sent to other threads for both reading and writing.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Unsafe code</h2><a id="user-content-unsafe-code" aria-label="Permalink: Unsafe code" href="#unsafe-code"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Ropey uses unsafe code to help achieve some of its space and performance
characteristics.  Although effort has been put into keeping the unsafe code
compartmentalized and making it correct, please be cautious about using Ropey
in software that may face adversarial conditions.</p>
<p dir="auto">Auditing, fuzzing, etc. of the unsafe code in Ropey is extremely welcome.
If you find any unsoundness, <em>please</em> file an issue!  Also welcome are
recommendations for how to remove any of the unsafe code without introducing
significant space or performance regressions, or how to compartmentalize the
unsafe code even better.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">License</h2><a id="user-content-license" aria-label="Permalink: License" href="#license"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Ropey is licensed under the MIT license (LICENSE.md or <a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT" rel="nofollow">http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT</a>)</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Contributing</h2><a id="user-content-contributing" aria-label="Permalink: Contributing" href="#contributing"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Contributions are absolutely welcome!  However, please open an issue to discuss
larger changes, to avoid doing a lot of work that may get rejected.  Also note
that PRs that add dependencies are very likely to be rejected (Ropey aims to
have minimal dependencies).</p>
<p dir="auto">An overview of Ropey's design can be found <a href="https://github.com/cessen/ropey/blob/master/design/design.md">here</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Unless you explicitly state otherwise, any contribution intentionally submitted
for inclusion in Ropey by you will be licensed as above, without any additional
terms or conditions.</p>

<h2 id="the-database-and-its-open-source-dependencies">The Database and its Open-Source Dependencies</h2>
<p>Building a database from scratch is often considered daunting. However, the Rust programming language and its open-source community have made it easier.</p>
<p>With a team of three experienced developers, we have implemented ScopeDB from scratch to production in four months, with the help of Rust and its open-source ecosystem.</p>
<p>ScopeDB is a shared-disk architecture database in the cloud that manages observability data in petabytes. A simple calculation shows that we implemented such a database with about 50,000 lines of Rust code, with 100 direct dependencies and 647 dependencies in total.</p>
<p><img src="https://tisonkun.io/_astro/calc.CC4Gau51_Z1Ey6FS.webp" alt="ScopeDB project statistics" width="1322" height="918" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></p>
<p>Here are several open-source projects that we have heavily used to build ScopeDB:</p>
<ul>
<li>ScopeDB stores user data in object storage services. We leverage <a href="https://github.com/apache/opendal">Apache OpenDAL</a> as a unified interface to access various object storage services at users’ choice.</li>
<li>ScopeDB manages metadata with relational database services. We leverage <a href="https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx">SQLx</a> and <a href="https://github.com/SeaQL/sea-query">SeaQuery</a> to interact efficiently and ergonomically with relational databases.</li>
<li>ScopeDB supports multiple <a href="https://www.scopedb.io/reference/datatypes-overview">data types</a>. We leverage <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/jiff">Jiff</a> with its <code>Timestamp</code> and <code>SignedDuration</code> types for in-memory calculations, and <a href="https://github.com/reem/rust-ordered-float">ordered-float</a> to extend the floating point numbers with total ordering.</li>
</ul>
<p>UPDATE: Filtered internal crates, the open-source dependencies are 623 in total. Check out this <a href="https://gist.github.com/tisonkun/06550d2dcd9cf6551887ee6305e92edc">Gist</a> to see if your project is one of them </p><p> (Note that a dependency in the lockfile may not be used in the final binary)</p>
<p>Besides, during the development of ScopeDB, we spawned a few common libraries and made them open-source. We have developed a message queue demo system as its open-source twin.</p>
<p>In the following sections, I will discuss how we got involved and contributed to the upstreams and describe the open-source projects we developed.</p>

<h2 id="involve-and-contribute-back-to-the-upstreams">Involve and Contribute Back to the Upstreams</h2>
<p>Generally speaking, when you start to use an open-source project in your software, you will always encounter bugs, missing features, or performance issues. This is the most direct motivation to contribute back to the upstreams.</p>
<p>For example, during the migration from pull-based metric reporting to push-based metric reporting in ScopeDB, we implemented a new layer for OpenDAL to support report metrics via opentelemetry:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/apache/opendal/pull/5524">feat(layer/otelmetrics): add OtelMetricsLayer</a></li>
</ul>
<p>When onboarding our customers to ScopeDB, we developed a tool to benchmark object storage services with OpenDAL’s APIs. We contributed the tool back to the OpenDAL project:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/apache/opendal/pull/5443">feat(bin/oli): implement oli bench</a></li>
</ul>
<p>To integrate with the data types provided by Jiff and ordered-float, we often need to extend those types. We try our best to contribute those extensions back to the upstreams:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/reem/rust-ordered-float/pull/155">feat: optionally integrate with num-cmp</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/reem/rust-ordered-float/pull/161">feat: integrate with derive-visitor</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/pull/143">feat: implement Hash trait for structs that has implemented PartialEq</a></li>
</ul>
<p>We leverage <a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs">Apache Arrow</a> for its Array abstraction to convey data in vector form. We have contributed a few patches to the Arrow project:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs/pull/6452">Support cast between Durations + between Durations all numeric types</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs/pull/6652">feat: add write_bytes for GenericBinaryBuilder</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Even if the extension can be too specific to ScopeDB, we share the code so that people who have the same needs can use the patch:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/pull/141">feat: bootstrap jiff-sqlx development</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/SeaQL/sea-query/pull/852">feat: add Expr::column</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I’m maintaining many open-source projects, too. Thus, I understand the importance of user feedback even if you don’t encounter any issues. A simple “thank you” can be an excellent motivation for the maintainers:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/discussions/174">Feedback to upgrade jiff to 0.1.16</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Artem-Romanenia/o2o/issues/21">Showcase how I use this crate to crate a mapping between (secured) business object and serializable dto</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes, except for the code, I also contribute to the documentation or share use cases when a certain feature is not well-documented:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx/issues/3630">sqlx::Type for Enum with String repr</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/servo/rust-url/pull/1013">docs: base url relative join</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs/discussions/6631">How to construct array of list of list and array of list of struct?</a></li>

<li><a href="https://github.com/poem-web/poem/issues/814">Transform errors when extract parameters</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Many times, contributing back is not one-directional. Instead, it’s about communication and collaboration.</p>
<p>We used to leverage <a href="https://github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-rs">testcontainers-rs</a> for behavior testing, but later, we found reusing containers across tests necessary. We fall back to using <a href="https://github.com/fussybeaver/bollard">Ballord</a> to implement the reuse logic. We shared the experience with the testcontainers-rs project:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-rs/issues/742">Reuse containers</a></li>
</ul>
<p>So far, a contributor has shown up and implemented the feature. I helped test the feature with our open-source twin, which I’ll introduce in the following section.</p>
<p>By the way, as an early adopter of Jiff, we shared a few real-world use cases, which Jiff’s maintainer adjusted the library to fit:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/issues/92">Allow configure nanosecond’s precision</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/issues/190">SignedDuration’s Display should use upper case letter</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Usually, after the integration has been done, there are fewer opportunities to collaborate with the upstream unless new requirements arise or our core functions cover the upstream’s main evolution direction. In the latter case, we will become an influencer or maintainer of the upstream.</p>
<h2 id="inside-out-the-databases-open-source-components">Inside Out: The Database’s Open-Source Components</h2>
<p>In addition to using open-source software out of the box, during the development of ScopeDB, we also write code to implement some common requirements, because there is no existing open-source software that satisfies our requirements directly. In this case, we will actively consider open-sourcing the code we wrote.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples of the open-source projects we developed during the development of ScopeDB:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/fast/fastrace">Fastrace</a> originated from a tracing library made by our team members during the development of TiKV. After several twists and turns, this library was separated from the TiKV organization and became one of the cornerstones of ScopeDB’s own observability. Currently, we are actively maintaining the Fastrace library.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/fast/logforth">Logforth</a> originated from the need for logging when developing ScopeDB. We initially used another library to complete this function. Still, we soon found that the library had some redundant designs and had not been maintained for over a year. Therefore, we quickly implemented a logging library that meets the needs of ScopeDB and can be easily extended, and open sourced it.</p>
<p>To support scheduled tasks within the database system, we developed <a href="https://github.com/fast/fastimer">Fastimer</a> to schedule different tasks in different manners. And to allow database users to define scheduled tasks with <a href="https://www.scopedb.io/reference/stmt-ddl#create-task"><code>CREATE TASK</code> statement</a>, we developed <a href="https://github.com/cratesland/cronexpr">Cronexpr</a> to support users specify the schedule frequency using cron expressions.</p>
<p>Last but not least, <a href="https://github.com/scopedb/scopedb-sdk">ScopeDB’s SDK</a> is open-source. Obviously, there is no benefit in privating the SDK, since the SDK does not have commercial value by itself, but is used to support ScopeDB’s user development applications. This is the same as Snowflake keeps its SDKs open-source. And when you think about it, GitHub also has its server code private and proprietary, while keeping its SDKs, CLIs, and even action runners open-source.</p>
<h2 id="an-open-source-twin-and-the-commercial-open-source-paradigm">An Open-Source Twin and the Commercial Open-Source Paradigm</h2>
<p>Finally, to share the engineering experience in implementing complex distributed systems using Rust, we developed a message queue system that roughly has the same architecture as ScopeDB’s:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/tisonkun/morax">Morax</a></li>
</ul>
<p>As mentioned above, when verifying the container reuse function of testcontainers-rs, our ultimate goal is to use it in the ScopeDB project. However, ScopeDB is a private software, and we cannot directly share upstream developers with ScopeDB’s source code for testing. Instead, Morax, as an open-source twin, can provide developers with an open-source reproduction environment:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/tisonkun/morax/pull/19">test: try to use testcontainers with reuse</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I have presented this commercial open-source paradigm in a few conferences and meetups:</p>
<p><img src="https://tisonkun.io/_astro/case-study-slice.HcF-bHff_Z1jh2Gg.webp" alt="Commercial Open-Source Paradigm" width="3246" height="1798" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></p>
<p>When you read <em>The Cathedral &amp; the Bazaar</em>, for its Chapter 4, <em>The Magic Cauldron</em>, it writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… the only rational reasons you might want them to be closed is if you want to sell the package to other people, or deny its use to competitors. [“Reasons for Closing Source”]</p>
<p>Open source makes it rather difficult to capture direct sale value from software. [“Why Sale Value is Problematic”]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While the article focuses on when open-source is a good choice, these sentences imply that it’s reasonable to keep your commercial software private and proprietary.</p>
<p>We follow it and run a business to sustain the engineering effort. We keep ScopeDB private and proprietary, while we actively get involved and contribute back to the open-source dependencies, open source common libraries when it’s suitable, and maintain the open-source twin to share the engineering experience.</p>
<h2 id="future-works">Future Works</h2>
<p>If you try out the ScopeDB playground, you will see that the database is still in its early stages. We are experiencing challenges in improving performance in multiple ways and supporting more features. Primarily, we are actively working on accelerating async scheduling and supporting variant data more efficiently.</p>
<p>Besides, we are working to provide an online service to allow users to try out the database for free without setting up the playground and unleash the real power of ScopeDB with real cloud resources.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in the project, please feel free to <a href="mailto:tison@scopedb.io">drop me an email</a>.</p>
<p>I’ll keep sharing our engineering experience developing Rust software and stories we collaborate with the open-source community. Stay tuned!</p> </div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/15/24343794/google-workspace-ai-features-free">https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/15/24343794/google-workspace-ai-features-free</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42710978">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you wanted to use all of Google’s AI features inside Gmail, Docs, Sheets, Meet, and the rest of the Workspace suite, you previously needed to pony up another $20 per user per month for the Gemini Business plan. As of Tuesday, it’s free. Google is bringing all its AI features to its Workspace app at no extra cost as it continues to race Microsoft, OpenAI, and others to build the AI-powered office suite of the future.</p><p>There is a catch, though: as it makes this change, Google is increasing the price of all Workspace plans. Jerry Dischler, Google’s president of cloud applications, tells me companies will pay roughly $2 more per month per user for the AI-enabled Workspace than they were paying before. (The numbers aren’t exact, because companies have complicated and varying contracts, but the base subscription price was $12 a month and now it will be $14.)</p><p>Workspace AI includes things like email summaries in Gmail, generated designs for spreadsheets and videos, an automated note-taker for meetings, the powerful NotebookLM research assistant, and writing tools across apps. It also comes with access to the Gemini bot itself, which is maybe Google’s single most powerful AI tool; the bot can do standard chatbot thing but can also help you find information, search across all your stuff, and more. </p><p>Dischler points out that Google is the most <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/14/24066552/google-openai-gemini-ultra-chatgpt-chatbots">vertically integrated</a> AI product out there right now, but that only matters if people are using the whole system. Now, everyone can. “Most of the time, when we talk to companies who are using AI, their big impediment is cost reasons,” he says. “That’s why they go in so gingerly. Like, ‘wow, this is a lot of money, and let’s prove the value.’ All right, now you get the AI. You have the value.” He says the various app roadmaps are already changing, too, and that new features will begin to ship quickly. </p><p>Google’s not the only company walking back its AI up-charge: Microsoft announced in November that its own Copilot Pro AI features, which had also previously been a $20 monthly upgrade, would become <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/7/24290268/microsoft-copilot-office-features-microsoft-365">part of the standard Microsoft 365 subscription</a>. So far, that’s only for the Personal and Family subscriptions, and only in a few places. But these companies all understand that this is their moment to teach people new ways to use their products and win new customers in the process. They’re betting that the cost of rolling out all these AI features to everyone will be worth it in the long run.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>Posted on 14 Jan 2025 by Claudio Santini</p>
<p><a href="https://huggingface.co/hexgrad/Kokoro-82M">Kokoro v0.19</a> is a recently published text-to-speech model with just 82M params and very high-quality output.
It's released under Apache licence and was trained on &lt;100 hours of audio.
It currently supports american, british english, french, korean, japanese and mandarin, in a bunch of very good voices.</p>
<p>An example of the quality:</p>

<p>I've always dreamed of converting my ebook library into audiobooks. Especially for those niche books that you cannot find in audiobook format.
Since Kokoro is pretty fast, I thought this may finally be
doable. I've created a small tool called Audiblez (in honor of the popular audiobook platform) that parses .epub files and converts the
body of the book into nicely narrated audio files.</p>
<p>On my M2 MacBook Pro, <strong>it takes about 2 hours to convert to mp3 the Selfish Gene by Richard Dawkins</strong>, which is about 100,000 words (or 600,000 characters),
at a rate of about 80 characters per second.</p>
<h2>How to install and run</h2>
<p>If you have Python 3 on your computer, you can install it with pip.
Be aware that it won't work with Python 3.13.</p>
<p>Then you also need to download a couple of additional files in the same folder, which are about ~360MB:</p>
<pre><code>pip install audiblez
wget https://github.com/thewh1teagle/kokoro-onnx/releases/download/model-files/kokoro-v0_19.onnx
wget https://github.com/thewh1teagle/kokoro-onnx/releases/download/model-files/voices.json
</code></pre>
<p>Then, to convert an epub file into an audiobook, just run:</p>
<pre><code>audiblez book.epub -l en-gb -v af_sky
</code></pre>
<p>It will first create a bunch of <code>book_chapter_1.wav</code>, <code>book_chapter_2.wav</code>, etc. files in the same directory,
and at the end it will produce a <code>book.m4b</code> file with the whole book you can listen with VLC or any
audiobook player.
It will only produce the <code>.m4b</code> file if you have <code>ffmpeg</code> installed on your machine.</p>
<h2>Supported Languages</h2>
<p>Use <code>-l</code> option to specify the language, available language codes are:
🇺🇸 <code>en-us</code>, 🇬🇧 <code>en-gb</code>, 🇫🇷 <code>fr-fr</code>, 🇯🇵 <code>ja</code>, 🇰🇷 <code>kr</code> and 🇨🇳 <code>cmn</code>.</p>
<h2>Supported Voices</h2>
<p>Use <code>-v</code> option to specify the voice:
available voices are <code>af</code>, <code>af_bella</code>, <code>af_nicole</code>, <code>af_sarah</code>, <code>af_sky</code>, <code>am_adam</code>, <code>am_michael</code>, <code>bf_emma</code>, <code>bf_isabella</code>, <code>bm_george</code>, <code>bm_lewis</code>.
You can try them here: <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/hexgrad/Kokoro-TTS">https://huggingface.co/spaces/hexgrad/Kokoro-TTS</a></p>
<h2>Chapter Detection</h2>
<p>Chapter detection is a bit janky, but it manages to find the core chapters in most .epub I tried, skipping
the cover, index, appendix etc.<br>
If you find it doesn't include the chapter you are interested into, try to play with the <code>is_chapter</code> function in the code.
Often it skips the preface or intro, and I'm not sure if it's a bug or a feature.</p>
<h2>Source</h2>
<p>See <a href="https://github.com/santinic/audiblez">Audiblez project on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>There are still some rough edges, but it works well enough for me. Future improvements could include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Better chapter detection, or allow users to include/exclude chapters.</li>
<li>Add chapter navigation to m4b file (that looks hard, cause ffmpeg doesn't do it)</li>
<li>Add narration for images using some image-to-text model</li>
</ul>
<p>Code is short enough to be included here:</p>

<p>N.B. I'm in a mood tonight, so this will be less of a well-considered essay and more of a rant, partially in the vein of <a href="https://kieranhealy.org/files/papers/fuck-nuance.pdf"><em>Fuck Nuance</em></a>. Don't take anything here <em>too</em> seriously.</p>
<p><strong>Why does nobody care about anything?</strong> The world is full of stuff that could be excellent with just 1% more effort. But people don't care.</p>
<p>Have been to the DMV? It sucked? There is a human being whose job it is to be in charge of the DMV. They do not care that it sucks.</p>
<p>Ever used a piece of software that's buggy as hell, looks bad, but still costs money, presumably because the company behind it has found some regulatory capture to justify their existence? The programmer who wrote it probably doesn't care. Their manager definitely doesn't care. The regulators don't care.</p>
<p>You might think "something something incentive systems". No. At my big tech job I had the pleasure of interviewing a few programmers who worked for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_Systems">a large healthcare company that engages in regulatory capture</a>. Let me assure you: They. Do. Not Care.</p>
<p>I've met a few people that work for municipal governments. Not politicians, just career bureaucrats deep in the system. I ask them what their favorite part of the job is. They all say "stability" or "job security" as their #1. It takes 18 months to get the city to permit your shed? They. Do. Not. Care.</p>
<p>Here's a dumb example. This bike lane ends at the bottom of a hill near me. It merges onto the sidewalk at a crazy sharp angle. Cyclists are coming down this hill at 20mph or so. Tons of people can't make this angle at that speed and hit the vertical curb face, damaging their bike and injuring themselves. If they're unlucky, they go flying into the signpost.</p>
<p><img src="https://grantslatton.com/images/7811f103-f2e7-4f31-9291-e5cbd0df8d69.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Why does this ramp suck so much? For literally the exact same effort it took to build, it could have been built 10x better. Make the angle 20 degrees instead of 70. Put the ramp just after the sign instead of just before it. Make the far curb face sloped instead of vertical. Put some visual indication the lane ends 50 feet uphill. Why wasn't this done?</p>
<p><strong>Because the engineer who designed it and the managers at the department of transportation do not give a shit</strong>.</p>
<p>This isn't even a pro- or anti-bikes thing. The ramp was getting built by whatever mandate. You're the engineer. Do you make it bad, or do you spend 1% more time thinking about it and make it good for literally the same cost? You make it bad, because you do not care.</p>
<p>I actually pointed this ramp out to the director of the Seattle Department of Transportation during a walking tour. He made a note of it over a year ago that I assume was promptly forgotten about. He does not care.</p>
<p>Here's another example. Street lights. Seattle has been engaging in a program to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LED_street_light#Health_concerns">reduce everyone's natural melatonin production up to 5x</a> by replacing the sodium lights with harsh-white LEDs.</p>
<p><img src="https://grantslatton.com/images/cf8cbb5d-6112-452a-8c99-14f010daeaa9.png" alt=""></p>
<p>These new lights objectively suck to anyone not driving. If your house is near one, they suck. If you're walking your dog at night (which starts at 5PM for much of the year in Seattle), they <em>really</em> suck.</p>
<p>But whoever made the decision to switch the lights does not care. It's entirely possible they don't even live in the city, but instead live in a pleasant exurb. Or maybe they don't walk at night and have never considered that other people do.</p>
<p>White LEDs reduce car crashes by 0.1% and that is measurable, but sleep quality and aesthetics are not measurable. You just have to care about them. And nobody cares.</p>
<p>But that's enough city stuff. Plenty of people don't care about plenty of other things.</p>
<p>You put on your turn signal in traffic to merge. The person who could let you in is looking straight ahead, zoned out. Why would they look around to see if they could cooperate with anyone? They're already in the lane they need to be in. They. Do. Not. Care.</p>
<p>You're at the airport. There's a group in front of you on the escalator taking up the full width, preventing anyone from walking by. They do not care.</p>
<p>You're on the sidewalk and someone has headphones in, walking in the center of the path. A mom and stroller are behind them. They can't hear her "excuse me" to get their attention. They have not even considered the possibility that anyone in the world exists but them. They do not care.</p>
<p>The McDonalds touch-screen self-order kiosk takes 27 clicks to get a meal. They try to up-sell you 3 times. Just let me pay for my fucking burger, Jesus Christ. The product manager, the programmer, the executives. None of these people care.</p>
<p>At work the junior engineer sends you some code to review. The code was clearly written in a first draft, and then just iteratively patched until the tests passed, then immediately sent to you to review without any further improvement. They do not care.</p>
<p>The guy on the hiking trail is playing his shitty EDM on his bluetooth speaker, ruining nature for everyone else. He does not care.</p>
<p>The doctor misdiagnosis your illness whose symptoms are in the first paragraph of the trivially googleable wikipedia article. He does not care.</p>
<p>People don't pick up after their dogs. The guy at the gym doesn't re-rack the weights. The lady at the grocery store leaves the cart in the middle of the parking lot. They. Do. Not. Care.</p>
<p>I could continue in this vein for another few pages, but it would be boring at you get the point. We are surrounded by antisocial bastards.</p>
<p>Some of them like the people who don't pick up after their dogs are legitimately just assholes.</p>
<p>Others, like the bureaucrats in the city who mess up our lives in more indirect ways are more a victim of The System. But they are still guilty of lacking the personal agency to fight it or leave in protest, and I still — potentially unjustly — condemn them.</p>
<p>We have examples like Elon who, through sheer force of will, defeat armies of people who don't care. For his many faults, you can't say the man doesn't care.</p>
<p>When I <em>joined</em> my former Big Tech job, everyone cared. Over time, <a href="https://blog.sbensu.com/posts/incentives-as-selection-effects/">incentives attracted</a> a different set of people who didn't care as much. Eventually those people became the majority. It's painful to work with people who don't care if you care a lot, and eventually I left because of it.</p>
<p>Now, I'm at a small startup full of people who care. Customer bug reports go right to our chatroom. We fix them immediately. I feel guilty I wrote the bugs at all. We reach out to users to see if we can make their lives better. We care.</p>
<p>I want to live in a community where everyone cares.</p>
<p>The one place in the world you get this vibe is probably Japan. Most people just <em>really care</em>. Patrick McKenzie refers to this as <a href="https://x.com/search?q=from%3Apatio11+nice+things"><em>the will to have nice things</em></a>. Japan has it, and the US mostly does not.</p>
<p>In Japan, you get the impression that everyone takes their job and role in society seriously. The median Japanese 7-11 clerk takes their job more seriously than the median US city bureaucrat. And the result is obvious if you visit both places.</p>
<p>Is it possible for us to care in the US? To foster the will to have nice things? I think we actually had this in the aftermath of WW2. The country was mostly on the same page about progress, values, the future. But over a few generations, more and more people defect. Living among defectors is demoralizing and causes more defections (much like my own departure from my Big Tech job!). Eventually society is full of defectors.</p>
<p>But I don't think this is a full explanation. Most people aren't <em>assholes</em>, they merely won't go <em>out of their way</em> to add to the world. And I can feel myself getting pulled in that direction.</p>
<p>I used to go a lot more out of my way to add to the world. A few years ago, <a href="https://x.com/GrantSlatton/status/1742621644022305246">I installed</a> a bunch of dog bag dispensers on the telephone poles of my neighborhood. I still keep them stocked.</p>
<p><img src="https://grantslatton.com/images/088bdb08-d0aa-449c-8727-ba41bad8e5c1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I was, somewhat naively, hoping that somehow I could get a snowball of care going. I built curb ramps on legacy curbs that lacked them. I lobbied the city to <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/dGoH7hL9ytXKNXaRA">open new park space</a>. Improve crosswalks. And much more!</p>
<p>But the snowball never started. Nobody cares. Rather, there is a tiny minority of activists who care. They spend all their free time doing activist stuff — basically fighting the city to try to make the bureaucrats care about little bits here and there.</p>
<p>But I've come to accept that I just don't have the disposition to fight all the time. I'm not a fighter. I care <em>a lot</em> and I just want to live in a place where other people care.</p>
<p>We're not going to move to Japan, but would absolutely be willing to move within the US.</p>
<p>Does such a community really exist? Where <em>everyone</em> cares? Or at least a supermajority? Or does it need to be built?</p>

Subject: RSYNC: 6 vulnerabilities

Hello OSS-security,

Two independent groups of researchers have identified a total of 6
vulnerabilities in rsync. In the most severe CVE, an attacker only requires
anonymous read access to a rsync server, such as a public mirror, to
execute arbitrary code on the machine the server is running on.

Upstream has prepared patches for these CVEs. These fixes will be included
in rsync 3.4.0 which is to be released shortly.

CVE Details:
[1] Heap Buffer Overflow in Rsync due to Improper Checksum Length Handling

CVE ID: CVE-2024-12084

CVSS 3.1: 9.8 - AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

Description: A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the rsync
daemon. This issue is due to improper handling of attacker-controlled
checksum lengths (s2length) in the code. When MAX_DIGEST_LEN exceeds the
fixed SUM_LENGTH (16 bytes), an attacker can write out of bounds in the
sum2 buffer.

Affected Versions: &gt;= 3.2.7 and &lt; 3.4.0
Reporters: Simon Scannell from Google, Pedro Gallegos from Google, Jasiel
Spelman from Google

Mitigation: Disable SHA* support by compiling with
CFLAGS=-DDISABLE_SHA512_DIGEST and CFLAGS=-DDISABLE_SHA256_DIGEST.

----------

[2] Info Leak via Uninitialized Stack Contents

CVE ID: CVE-2024-12085

CVSS 3.1: 7.5 - AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

Description: A flaw was found in the rsync daemon which could be triggered
when rsync compares file checksums. This flaw allows an attacker to
manipulate the checksum length (s2length) to cause a comparison between a
checksum and uninitialized memory and leak one byte of uninitialized stack
data at a time.

Affected Versions: &lt; 3.4.0

Reporters: Simon Scannell from Google, Pedro Gallegos from Google, Jasiel
Spelman from Google

Mitigation: Compile with -ftrivial-auto-var-init=zero to zero the stack
contents.

----------

[3] Rsync Server Leaks Arbitrary Client Files

CVE ID: CVE-2024-12086

CVSS 3.1: 6.1 - AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N

Description: A flaw was found in rsync. It could allow a server to
enumerate the contents of an arbitrary file from the client's machine. This
issue occurs when files are being copied from a client to a server. During
this process, the rsync server will send checksums of local data to the
client to compare with in order to determine what data needs to be sent to
the server. By sending specially constructed checksum values for arbitrary
files, an attacker may be able to reconstruct the data of those files
byte-by-byte based on the responses from the client.

[4] Path Traversal Vulnerability in Rsync

CVE ID: CVE-2024-12087

CVSS 3.1: 6.5 - AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N

Description: A path traversal vulnerability exists in rsync. It stems from
behavior enabled by the `--inc-recursive` option, a default-enabled option
for many client options and can be enabled by the server even if not
explicitly enabled by the client. When using the `--inc-recursive` option,
a lack of proper symlink verification coupled with deduplication checks
occurring on a per-file-list basis could allow a server to write files
outside of the client's intended destination directory. A malicious server
could write malicious files to arbitrary locations named after valid
directories/paths on the client.

[5] --safe-links Option Bypass Leads to Path Traversal

CVE ID: CVE-2024-12088

CVSS 3.1: 6.5 - AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N

Description: A flaw was found in rsync. When using the `--safe-links`
option, rsync fails to properly verify if a symbolic link destination
contains another symbolic link within it. This results in a path traversal
vulnerability, which may lead to arbitrary file write outside the desired
directory.

Affected Versions: &lt; 3.4.0

[6] Race Condition in Rsync Handling Symbolic Links

CVE ID: CVE-2024-12747

CVSS 3.1: 5.6 - AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N

Description: A flaw was found in rsync. This vulnerability arises from a
race condition during rsync's handling of symbolic links. Rsync's default
behavior when encountering symbolic links is to skip them. If an attacker
replaced a regular file with a symbolic link at the right time, it was
possible to bypass the default behavior and traverse symbolic links.
Depending on the privileges of the rsync process, an attacker could leak
sensitive information, potentially leading to privilege escalation.

Affected Versions: &lt; 3.4.0
