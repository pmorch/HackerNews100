  <h2>Upgrading a Toshiba NAS HDD firmware on Linux</h2>
  <p><span>28 Aug 2024</span></p><h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>

<p>I reversed the firmware updater of my Toshiba HDD to be able to update it on Linux.
The following commands <strong>should</strong> work, <strong>USE AT YOUR OWN RISK</strong>:</p>

<div><pre><code>$ wget https://www.canvio.jp/en/support/download/hdd/ot_ihdd/fw/ISFw.dat
$ grep -C2 MODELNAME ISFw.dat
 # ^
 #&nbsp;|___ identify the right filename here
$ wget https://www.canvio.jp/en/support/download/hdd/ot_ihdd/fw/sk060202.ftd
# hdparm --fwdownload-mode3 sk060202.ftd /dev/sdX
</code></pre></div>

<h2 id="context">Context</h2>

<p>I bought a Toshiba HDWG480 HDD for my NAS. <code>hdparm -I /dev/XXX</code> gives the following output:</p>

<div><pre><code>ATA device, with non-removable media
        Model Number:       TOSHIBA HDWG480
        Serial Number:      3430A00RFR0H
        Firmware Revision:  0601
        Transport:          Serial, ATA8-AST, SATA 1.0a, SATA II Extensions, SATA Rev 2.5, SATA Rev 2.6, SATA Rev 3.0
Standards:

        Supported: 10 9 8 7 6 5
        Likely used: 10
[...]
</code></pre></div>

<p>As usual, I wanted to check if any firmware update is available. Toshiba’s <a href="https://www.canvio.jp/en/support/download/hdd/ot_ihdd/fw/en.htm">dedicated webpage</a> lists version <code>0602</code> as available for my model.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, as expected, there’s no firmware update process provided for Linux users, only an “Internal Storage Firmware Update Utility” is provided for Windows.</p>

<p>Update files are not provided either.</p>

<h3 id="goals">Goals</h3>

<p>So, our goals are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>understand where the updater gets its update files from</li>
  <li>reverse engineer the flashing process itself to reimplement it on Linux</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="reversing-the-windows-updater">Reversing the Windows Updater</h2>

<h3 id="intro">Intro</h3>

<p>Running the <a href="https://www.canvio.jp/en/support/download/hdd/ot_ihdd/fw/exe/InternalStorageFwUpdateUtility_1.20.0410.exe">installer</a><sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> with Wine works perfectly, resulting in the following files being installed under <code>Program Files (x86)</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code>  18312 ISFw.exe:        PE32 executable (native) Intel 80386, for MS Windows, 4 sections
2434952 TosISFw.exe:     PE32 executable (GUI) Intel 80386, for MS Windows, 5 sections
2172296 TosISFwSvc.exe:  PE32 executable (GUI) Intel 80386, for MS Windows, 5 sections
2362248 TosISFwTray.exe: PE32 executable (GUI) Intel 80386, for MS Windows, 5 sections
</code></pre></div>

<p>A quick look (filename, imports) hints at the following goals for each program:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>ISFW.exe</code> is a driver (<code>DriverEntry</code> export), probably in charge of effectively flashing the update.</li>
  <li><code>TosISFw.exe</code> is the GUI</li>
  <li><code>TosISFwSvc.exe</code> is the userland service (as the service related imports show)</li>
  <li><code>TosISFwTray.exe</code> most probably handles a tray icon</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="finding-the-update-files">Finding the update files</h3>

<p>The obvious move is too grep for URLs in the various installed binaries. Unfortunately, it leads nowhere apart from URLs related to the digital signatures. However, grepping for <code>HttpOpenRequest</code>, an API often used by Windows programs to download files, gives two results: <code>TosISFw.exe</code> and <code>TosISFwSvc.exe</code>.</p>

<p>Let’s look at <code>TosISFwSvc.exe</code> which is smaller and let’s see if we can find the URL by checking the xrefs.</p>

<p>The call is in the function at 0x00401040, and looks like this:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>v15</span> <span>=</span> <span>HttpOpenRequestW</span><span>(</span><span>v14</span><span>,</span> <span>L"GET"</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>v36</span><span>[(</span><span>_DWORD</span><span>)</span><span>lpBuffer</span><span>],</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>LPCWSTR</span><span>)</span><span>szReferrer</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>0x84000000</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>the function is obviously a “download” helper, as all the API calls show. Let’s rename it <code>dlfile</code>. There are only two Xrefs to dlfile:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>if</span> <span>(</span> <span>!</span><span>RegOpenKeyExW</span><span>(</span>
        <span>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE</span><span>,</span>

</code></pre></div>

<p>The first one gives us our answer: the URL is stored in the registry. It’s actually written by the InstallShield setup.</p>

<p><a href="https://syscall.eu/blog/public/toshiba/regedit.png"><img src="https://syscall.eu/blog/public/toshiba/regedit.png" alt="disk"></a></p>

<p>The value is <code>http://www.canvio.jp/en/support/download/hdd/ot_ihdd/fw/ISFw.dat</code></p>

<h3 id="parsing-the-update-file">Parsing the update file</h3>

<p>The file is an ini file, which is trivial to read and parse:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>[VERS]</span>
<span>VERSION</span><span>=</span><span>"20240513"</span>
<span>[Firmware]</span>

<span>0008option</span><span>=</span><span>0</span>
<span>[...]</span>
<span>; 905CBD24
</span></code></pre></div>

<p>in my case, the drive is number 8. What’s interesting is the checksum at the end. It’s the CRC32 of the file, minus the last 10 bytes, which can be easily checked with the <code>slice</code> and <code>crc32</code> tools of my hacking Swiss army knife <a href="https://github.com/trou/rsbkb">rsbkb</a>:</p>

<div><pre><code>$ slice -- ISFw.dat 0 -10 | crc32
905cbd24
</code></pre></div>

<p>Now obviously, let’s try to download the relevant file:</p>

<div><pre><code>$ wget https://www.canvio.jp/en/support/download/hdd/ot_ihdd/fw/sk060202.ftd
Resolving www.canvio.jp (www.canvio.jp)... 23.72.248.205, 23.72.248.202

HTTP request sent, awaiting response... 200 OK
Length: 1171456 (1.1M)
[...]
</code></pre></div>

<p>Just for fun we can check if <a href="https://github.com/trou/cpu_rec_rs"><code>cpu_rec_rs</code></a> can identify any code in the binary:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$</span><span> </span>~/tools/cpu_rec_rs/cpu_rec_rs sk060202.ftd
<span>Loading corpus from "/home/trou/tools/cpu_rec_rs/cpu_rec_corpus/*.corpus"
-------------------------------------------------
    File     |   Range    | Detected Architecture
-------------------------------------------------
sk060202.ftd | Whole file | ARMhf
-------------------------------------------------
</span></code></pre></div>

<p>So the firmware is probably running on an ARM SoC (it is).</p>

<h3 id="understanding-the-update-process">Understanding the update process</h3>

<p>Now, how is the file sent to the drive to actually perform the update? Recall that we have 4 binaries and we saw the <code>ISFW.exe</code> is actually a driver.</p>

<p>The <code>DriverEntry</code> function is actually extremely simple:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>NTSTATUS</span> <span>__stdcall</span> <span>DriverEntry</span><span>(</span><span>PDRIVER_OBJECT</span> <span>DriverObject</span><span>,</span> <span>PUNICODE_STRING</span> <span>RegistryPath</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
  <span>int</span> <span>v2</span><span>;</span> <span>// eax</span>

  <span>readregistry</span><span>();</span>
  <span>v2</span> <span>=</span> <span>flashfirmware</span><span>();</span>
  <span>sub_1001812</span><span>(</span><span>v2</span> <span>%</span> <span>100</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>v2</span><span>);</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>NtTerminateProcess</span><span>((</span><span>HANDLE</span><span>)</span><span>0xFFFFFFFF</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>I’ve already renamed <code>readregistry</code> and <code>flashfirmware</code> as the functions are easy to identify:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>char</span> <span>readregistry</span><span>()</span>

<p><code>opendrive</code> returns a handle on a given <code>PhysicalDrive</code>, which is then used by <code>getdevprop</code>’s <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winternl/nf-winternl-ntdeviceiocontrolfile"><code>NtDeviceIoControlFile</code></a>.
Using IDA’s “standard enums”, I remapped <code>0x2D1400</code> to its readable definition: <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winioctl/ni-winioctl-ioctl_storage_query_property"><code>IOCTL_STORAGE_QUERY_PROPERTY</code></a>.</p>

<p>As <code>InputBuffer</code> is set to 0 before the call, the returned data is a <code>STORAGE_DEVICE_DESCRIPTOR</code> structure, which is used by <code>verifydisk</code> to verify if the drive is connected through USB (<code>BusTypeUsb</code>) and bails out if that’s the case.</p>

<p><code>NtDeviceIoControlFile</code> is now used with <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddscsi/ni-ntddscsi-ioctl_ata_pass_through_direct"><code>IOCTL_ATA_PASS_THROUGH_DIRECT</code></a>, which as the name implies, sends a raw ATA command to the drive. Actually understanding the request is a bit complex as the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddscsi/ns-ntddscsi-_ata_pass_through_direct"><code>ATA_PASS_THROUGH_DIRECT</code></a> structure specifies both data buffers and “registers” through the <code>CurrentTaskFile</code> field.</p>

<p><code>CurrentTaskFile</code> is an array used to index 8 registers, both as input and output. Using the documentation, we can create two enums to use in IDA:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>enum</span> <span>ATA_INPUT_REGISTERS</span> <span>:</span> <span>__int32</span>
<span>{</span>

<p>So the command here is <code>0xEC</code>. The ATA/ATAPI command set specification, found <a href="https://read.seas.harvard.edu/cs161/2024/pdf/ata-atapi-8.pdf">here</a>, describes the <code>IDENTIFY DEVICE – ECh, PIO Data-In</code> command, which returns a <em>lot</em> of data. Thankfully, Microsoft gives us the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ata/ns-ata-_identify_device_data"><code>IDENTIFY_DEVICE_DATA</code></a> structure which has everything.</p>

<p>The following code then verify we have the “right” drive by comparing the serial, model and firmware version from the returned data to the ones stored in the registry.</p>

<p>As you can see, the updater verifies an interesting field from the drive information data: <code>MaxBlocksPerDownloadMicrocodeMode03</code>. Let’s check what this means.</p>

<h3 id="sending-ata-firmware-update-commands">Sending ATA firmware update commands</h3>

<h4 id="documentation">Documentation</h4>

<p>The following excerpt from the ATA command set describes the meaning of the field:</p>

<div><pre><code>A.11.5.3.4 DM MAXIMUM TRANSFER SIZE field
If:
a) the value of the DM MAXIMUM TRANSFER SIZE field (see table A.30) is greater than zero;
b) the value of the DM MAXIMUM TRANSFER SIZE field is less than FFFFh;
c) the DOWNLOAD MICROCODE SUPPORTED bit (see A.11.5.2.20) is set to one or the DOWNLOAD MICROCODE DMA SUPPORTED bit (see A.11.5.2.6) is set to one; and
d) the DM OFFSETS DEFERRED SUPPORTED bit (see A.11.5.3.1) is set to one, or the DM OFFSETS IMMEDIATE
SUPPORTED bit (see A.11.5.3.3) is set to one, then the DM MAXIMUM TRANSFER SIZE field indicates the maximum number of 512-byte data blocks permitted by a DOWNLOAD MICROCODE command (see 7.7) or a DOWNLOAD MICROCODE DMA command (see 7.8) that specifies a subcommand of:
a) Download with offsets and save microcode for immediate and future use (i.e., 03h); or
b) Download with offsets and save microcode for future use (i.e., 0Eh).
Otherwise, no maximum is indicated (i.e., there is no maximum number of 512-byte data blocks).
The IDENTIFY DEVICE data contains a copy of the DM MAXIMUM TRANSFER SIZE field (see IDENTIFY DEVICE
data word 235 in table 45).
</code></pre></div>

<p>Of course, we want to check this <code>DOWNLOAD MICROCODE</code> command:</p>

<div><pre><code>The DOWNLOAD MICROCODE command allows the host to alter the device’s microcode. The data transferred
using the DOWNLOAD MICROCODE command and the DOWNLOAD MICROCODE DMA command is vendor
specific.
[...]
Downloading and activating microcode involves the following steps:
1) download: the host transfers updated microcode data to the device in one or more DOWNLOAD
MICROCODE commands or DOWNLOAD MICROCODE DMA commands;
2) save: after receiving the complete updated microcode data, if specified by the download microcode
mode, then the device shall save the updated microcode data to nonvolatile storage; and
3) activate: the device begins using the saved or deferred microcode data for the first time after an event
specified by the download microcode mode and the saved or deferred microcode data becomes the
active microcode data.

The BLOCK COUNT field specifies the number of 512-byte data blocks that shall be transferred. The BLOCK COUNT
field is specified in the COUNT field and the LBA field (see table 37).
</code></pre></div>

<p><code>DOWNLOAD</code> Subcommands actually define the update behavior:</p>

</code></pre></div>

<p>As you can see, the <code>ATA_CMD_DOWNLOAD_MICRO</code> just follows the specification. The only weird point is the <code>Device</code> register, which is basically obsolete, but is set to <code>0xE0</code>.
Just to be sure, I checked <code>hdparm</code> source code to see the value set in the command, and indeed, they also set it to <code>0xE0</code>, so it’s probably legacy cruft:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>enum</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>ATA_USING_LBA</span>		<span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>1</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>6</span><span>),</span>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>So basically, the updater does:</p>

<ul>
  <li>download the list of updates</li>
  <li>check if a drive matches, set registry values</li>
  <li>the driver takes over and:
    <ul>
      <li>checks if the drive is not connected through USB</li>
      <li>verifies it’s the actual drive specified in the registry using the <code>IDENTIFY DEVICE</code> command</li>
      <li>loops and sends the firmware update, 128 512-bytes chunks at a time, using the <code>DOWNLOAD MICROCODE</code> command</li>
      <li>verifies the drive was updated using the <code>IDENTIFY DEVICE</code> command</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page">

<br><br>
<span size="-1" color="888888"><br> <a name="1">1</a> of 24<br></span>
<p><img src="http://cityinfrastructure.com/RuralOutsidePlant/Webfiles/OutsidePlant.png" alt="OutsidePlant.png                      ">
</p>
Another section of this web site talked about outside plant, which is the telephone company's term for the cabling and other equipment which connects your home telephone to their Central Office.
<p>This diagram shows an overview, and below are some pictures and descriptions of how outside plant is different for rural areas.
</p><div><p>The main differences are that the Central Offices are typically smaller, and the cable distances are much greater.</p><p><span size="-1" color="888888"><br> <a name="2">2</a> of 24<br></span>
</p></div><p><img src="http://cityinfrastructure.com/RuralOutsidePlant/Webfiles/DSCN3005.jpg" alt="DSCN3005.jpg                          ">
</p>
Here is a typical Central Office. Note it is only one storey, but is still well-kept, and mostly windowless.<span size="-1" color="888888"><br> <a name="3">3</a> of 24<br></span>
<p><img src="http://cityinfrastructure.com/RuralOutsidePlant/Webfiles/DSCN3008.jpg" alt="DSCN3008.jpg                          ">
</p>
Around back are some air conditioners, technician's trucks, and even a small aluminum motor boat (the technicians working in this area often have to run telephone lines to islands). Also, at the right are some Jumpered Wire Interfaces (JWI), which split the high pair count cables from the Central Office (such as 1,200 pairs) to smaller cables (such as 200 pairs) for distribution to terminals and people's houses.<span size="-1" color="888888"><br> <a name="4">4</a> of 24<br></span>
<p><img src="http://cityinfrastructure.com/RuralOutsidePlant/Webfiles/DSCN2859.jpg" alt="DSCN2859.jpg                          ">
</p>
Here's another Central Office. This one has a few meters of unused 1,200-pair feeder cable in front (much more attractive than plastic pink flamingos).<span size="-1" color="888888"><br> <a name="5">5</a> of 24<br></span>
<p><img src="http://cityinfrastructure.com/RuralOutsidePlant/Webfiles/DSCN2852.jpg" alt="DSCN2852.jpg                          ">
</p>
Around back, no security cameras, but there is good lighting, and of course, air conditioners.<span size="-1" color="888888"><br> <a name="6">6</a> of 24<br></span>
<p><img src="http://cityinfrastructure.com/RuralOutsidePlant/Webfiles/DSCN2853.jpg" alt="DSCN2853.jpg                          ">
</p>
The front door has a mechanical push-button lock, and a discrete sign.<span size="-1" color="888888"><br> <a name="7">7</a> of 24<br></span>
<p><img src="http://cityinfrastructure.com/RuralOutsidePlant/Webfiles/DSCN2854-1200-pair-PIC.jpg" alt="DSCN2854-1200-pair-PIC.jpg            ">
</p>
Here's a close-up of the 1,200 pair cable. It is about 4 cm in diameter.<span size="-1" color="888888"><br> <a name="8">8</a> of 24<br></span>
<p><img src="http://cityinfrastructure.com/RuralOutsidePlant/Webfiles/DSCN2858.jpg" alt="DSCN2858.jpg                          ">
</p>
The feeder cables coming out of the Central Office are all buried, but within a few meters of the building, they surface to come be run up a utility pole. Note the ancient lead-covered splice enclosure.<span size="-1" color="888888"><br> <a name="9">9</a> of 24<br></span>
<p><img src="http://cityinfrastructure.com/RuralOutsidePlant/Webfiles/DSCN2857.jpg" alt="DSCN2857.jpg                          ">
</p>
Here's the top of that utility pole. These cables carry everything that this Central Office does (this is what is called a “single point of failure” – one car accident, and there's a lot of people with no phone service).
<div><p>There's another lead closure at the top-left.</p><p><span size="-1" color="888888"><br> <a name="10">10</a> of 24<br></span>
</p></div><p><img src="http://cityinfrastructure.com/RuralOutsidePlant/Webfiles/DSCN2856.jpg" alt="DSCN2856.jpg                          ">
</p>
As shown in the close-up of the 1,200-pair feeder cable above, cable construction is to have twisted pairs covered by a thick plastic protective jacket. After enough sun and flexing in the wind, the cable jacket can develop leaks, which could allow water to seep in between the cable pairs. This would change the electrical characteristics of the cable, and cause many problems (such as cross-talk between telephone lines and distorted signals). Therefore paper insulated cable (these cables will all be more than 40 years old) and sometimes newer cable) are pressurized with air, typically less than 9 pounds per square inch (for comparison, automobile tires typically have a pressure of more than 30 pounds per square inch). This provides several benefits:
<ul><li>Rather than water seeping into the cable, air will leak out, and this keeps the cable dry.</li>
<li>The flow of air through the cable will dry and remove any moisture that does get into the cable.</li> 
<li>By measuring the pressure along test points in the cable, and graphing this, a technician can determine approximately where the cable jacket is bad (the pressure will be lower where the air leaks out).</li></ul>
<div><p>I'm sure you've seen the little packages of <b>dessicant</b> (which look like restaurant coffee sugar packets) of that often come (along with a warning not to eat it) with electronic and other products which have been shipped from overseas. This stuff is a chemical that likes to absorb water (from the damp ocean crossing), so the moisture won't damage the goods. Similarly, there is a need to ensure that the air used to pressurize the cable is dry, and this blue crystalline material is dessicant, and does just that. The air compressor (or “bottled gas”, where the air comes from a compressed air tank) would be in the Central Office, and feeds the black hose, so the air passes through the dessicant, and the hose continues up the utility pole to pressurize the cables father along.</p><p><span size="-1" color="888888"><br> <a name="11">11</a> of 24<br></span>
</p></div><p><img src="http://cityinfrastructure.com/RuralOutsidePlant/Webfiles/DSCN2855.jpg" alt="DSCN2855.jpg                          ">
</p>
Here's a close-up of the dessicant canister. It reminds technicians to:
<ul><li>Change the desiccant when it turns pink.</li>
<li>That the maximum pressure allowed is 25 pounds per square inch (automobile tires typically have a pressure of 28 to 40 pounds per square inch).</li>
<li>And to be gentle with it.</li></ul>
This device is made by Jameson Corporation, and is model J-100-8.<span size="-1" color="888888"><br> <a name="12">12</a> of 24<br></span>

Here is a new air pipe (in an urban location) from a central office, waiting to be connected through to a cable vault farther down the road.<span size="-1" color="888888"><br> <a name="13">13</a> of 24<br></span>
<p><img src="http://cityinfrastructure.com/RuralOutsidePlant/Webfiles/DSCN3436.jpg" alt="DSCN3436.jpg">

This air pipe is made by Superior Essex. Their catalogue page is <a href="http://cityinfrastructure.com/RuralOutsidePlant/Webfiles/SuperiorEssexAirPipe.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. It shows that this type of pipe is typically installed in ducts (underground plastic conduits), the pipe has an outside diameter of 18 mm, and has a 4 mil (about the thickness of paper) aluminum tape inside the pipe (since the plastic used would otherwise allow water vapour to pass through the pipe wall (it is important to keep the air dry).<span size="-1" color="888888"><br> <a name="14">14</a> of 24<br></span>

To split a feeder cable into smaller cables (to each go in different directions) a splice enclosure is needed. Here is a really old lead one (on top), and a newer plastic (and openable) one below it.
<p>Cables with a lead splice closure are old enough that the wires are likely paper insulated (as the bundle of spliced wires is covered in a protective and insulating cloth before the lead closure is sealed with solder, plastic insulated wires can also be enclosed in lead closures, without damage when the lead is sealed with solder).
</p><p>Due to the difficulty of opening and resealing the lead closures, and the health concerns for technicians working with the lead, telephone companies are working at removing this type of closure.
</p><p>Modern buried telephone cables are generally <b>grease filled</b>: when the cable is manufactured, a gel is injected to fill the interstitial spaces between the twisted pairs, so water cannot seep in. In contrast, aerial cables are generally <b>dry</b>, and do not have this gunk.
</p><p>Attached to the lead splice cover is a pressure transducer to enable remote monitoring of the pressure in the cable.
</p><p>A web page for a typical outside plant pressure transducer made by TX Technology Corporation is <a href="http://cityinfrastructure.com/RuralOutsidePlant/Webfiles/Type100F_PressureTransducers.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. This points out that the transducer is designed to measure pressures from 0 to 9.5 pounds per square inch, and has a corresponding output from 100 kΩ to 3,820 kΩ. More detailed information is <a href="http://cityinfrastructure.com/RuralOutsidePlant/Webfiles/TX_Technology_PressureTransducerInstallation.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. It points out that the transducer has a water-tight screw cap (with a knurled edge for finger tightening, and a little ball-chain so it won't be lost if dropped) a which can be removed to set the zero-pressure point for the transducer, according to the altitude at which it is installed.
</p><p>The flexible cable hanging down is the electrical signal from the transducer, and is connected to a pair of wires in the lower cable so the pressure at this location can be remotely monitored at the central office. Because most central office activities (such as changing the telephone line features which subscribers receive and trouble-shooting problems) can now be done remotely, most central offices are not normally staffed. Therefore, the system (at the nearest central office) which monitors all the remote pressure transducers will usually be itself monitored remotely.
</p><div><p>When pressurized cable is spliced to dry or greased-filled cable, a <b>plug</b> must be poured into the end of the pressurized cable, so the air does not leak out.</p><p><span size="-1" color="888888"><br> <a name="15">15</a> of 24<br></span>
</p></div><p><img src="http://cityinfrastructure.com/RuralOutsidePlant/Webfiles/DSCN3036.jpg" alt="DSCN3036.jpg                          ">
</p>
Now we get to a really interesting part. As you drive along rural roads, you'll see what appear to be paint cans, each with a this cable coming out the top. If you're really bored, you may also notice that they are exactly 6,000 feet apart (that would be 1.14 miles, and 1.83 km).
<p>Just as you can walk slowly through water, but cannot easily run (since water is more viscous than air), higher-frequency electrical signals are attenuated (made quieter) more than lower-frequency signals.
</p><p>In urban areas, there are generally enough customers within a 5 km radius of Central Offices to justify building a Central Office, and in 5 km of cable, the signals are not distorted too much. In rural areas, customers are farther apart, and the cable runs to customers are longer. The capacitance of the cable (which is analogous to the greater viscosity of water) would attenuate the high-frequency signals (distorting the sound), so inductors (which counter-act the capacitance) are connected to each pair of wires.
</p><div><p>Since the capacitance is spread-out along the length of the cable, the inductance also has to be distributed along the cable. A popular scheme is called <b>H88</b>: the “H” refers to a distance of 6,000 feet between inductors, and the “88” refers to the inductance value of 88 mH (milliHenrys).</p><p><span size="-1" color="888888"><br> <a name="16">16</a> of 24<br></span>
</p></div><p><img src="http://cityinfrastructure.com/RuralOutsidePlant/Webfiles/DSCN3025.jpg" alt="DSCN3025.jpg                          ">
</p>
As you might have guessed, these therefore are not paint cans, but are the enclosures for the loading coils. If there is a 600-pair cable, then you need 600 loading coils (these look something like little spools of thread), and you need to attach each to the feeder cable.
<div><p>Here there are three old loading coils (two large, and one smaller metal enclosure mounted on the utility pole), and one newer black plastic loading coil enclosure attached (with stainless steel straps) to the cable at the left. A splice enclosure allows the cable from the loading coil enclosures to be spliced to the feeder cable</p><p><span size="-1" color="888888"><br> <a name="17">17</a> of 24<br></span>
</p></div><p><img src="http://cityinfrastructure.com/RuralOutsidePlant/Webfiles/DSCN3026.jpg" alt="DSCN3026.jpg                          ">
</p>
Here's a close-up of those big old loading coil enclosures.<span size="-1" color="888888"><br> <a name="18">18</a> of 24<br></span>
<p><img src="http://cityinfrastructure.com/RuralOutsidePlant/Webfiles/DSCN3027.jpg" alt="DSCN3027.jpg                          ">
</p>
As more cables are installed, more loading coils are needed. Here's the newest loading coil (cute, isn't it).<span size="-1" color="888888"><br> <a name="19">19</a> of 24<br></span>
<p><img src="http://cityinfrastructure.com/RuralOutsidePlant/Webfiles/DSCN3030.jpg" alt="DSCN3030.jpg                          ">
</p>
That's it for the loading coils, but on the very next utility pole (and this does generally happen, it will be on a directly adjacent utility pole, as the spacing is also 6,000 feet, likely to simplify installation), there's something else. Rather than being up high, these are generally a waist-height.<span size="-1" color="888888"><br> <a name="20">20</a> of 24<br></span>
<p><img src="http://cityinfrastructure.com/RuralOutsidePlant/Webfiles/DSCN3028%203M%20Closure.jpg" alt="DSCN3028 3M Closure.jpg               ">
</p>
So we have the feeder cables running along, and a 3M splice enclosure bringing a few of the twisted pairs in the cable down the utility pole ...<span size="-1" color="888888"><br> <a name="21">21</a> of 24<br></span>
<p><img src="http://cityinfrastructure.com/RuralOutsidePlant/Webfiles/DSCN3029.jpg" alt="DSCN3029.jpg                          ">
</p>
Down to these, which are <b>T1 repeaters</b>. Rather than the analogue signals carried by telephone lines, a T1 is a digital signal which carries data at 1,544,000 bits/s (on the exact same type of twisted pairs as the voice telephone lines). There are many advantages to T1 signals, including being able to carry 24 conversations over two twisted pairs, not gathering cumulative noise along the length of the cable run, and being able to carry (somewhat) high-speed data. But, the problem is that the signal needs to be amplified periodically – every 6,000 feet in fact. The amplifier is actually called a repeater, since it outputs a binary signal (which has only two states, on or off).<span size="-1" color="888888"><br> <a name="22">22</a> of 24<br></span>
<p><img src="http://cityinfrastructure.com/RuralOutsidePlant/Webfiles/DSCN3031.jpg" alt="DSCN3031.jpg                          ">
</p>
This is the older of the two. The feeder cable is pressurized, and so is the cable coming down to this repeater enclosure, and in fact, the repeater enclosure is pressurized as well. At the base of the white enclosure, you can see the clamp (with padlock) which provides the air-tight seal. Since there are active electronics in this enclosure, and they can't have cooling fans (since it is an air-tight enclosure), these enclosures are always white to reflect the sunlight (and some of the heat) as these bake in the summer sun.<span size="-1" color="888888"><br> <a name="23">23</a> of 24<br></span>
<p><img src="http://cityinfrastructure.com/RuralOutsidePlant/Webfiles/DSCN3035.jpg" alt="DSCN3035.jpg                          ">
</p>
Here's the newer enclosure, it is an HRE-458 HiGain Remote Therm-O-Nator Enclosure from ADC DSL Systems, Inc. Some documentation for it is <a href="http://cityinfrastructure.com/RuralOutsidePlant/Webfiles/2409_ADC_HRE-458.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>, and it can hold up to ten cards, such as this <a href="http://cityinfrastructure.com/RuralOutsidePlant/Webfiles/ADC_HiGain_HDU-409_HDSL_Extender,UserManual.pdf" target="_blank">HDSL line extender</a> which extends the range of two full-duplex 784 kbits/s DSL connections by up to 12,000' using two 24 gauge copper twisted pairs.
<div><p>The enclosure has heat sink fins on top (since heat rises, this will be where it gets the hottest). These help cool the enclosure by providing more surface area, so it can radiate more heat.</p><p><span size="-1" color="888888"><br> <a name="24">24</a> of 24<br></span>
</p></div><p><img src="http://cityinfrastructure.com/RuralOutsidePlant/Webfiles/DSCN3034.jpg" alt="DSCN3034.jpg                          ">
</p>
Here's a look at the bottom, showing the cable entry, and also a pressure relief valve to release the pressure before opening the enclosure. Another opening allows the pressure to be measures. The thinner black wire is to ground the enclosure, so goes to a metal stake driven into the ground.</div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
      <p>Hello everyone - it's been a while!</p><p>I was super busy with 
university and my mandatory internship in a software company for the 
past 6 months, so I haven't posted in a while. But that doesn't mean 
that I was inactive - I spent nearly every evening and every weekend 
working on SpaceHey. I didn't develop any new ground-breaking features, 
but instead I focused on improving the overall SpaceHey experience - 
making it smoother, more stable, easier to use and safer.</p><p>But before I get into the details, let's have a look at a huge milestone first: SpaceHey hit 1 Million registered users!! That's crazy!!<br></p><h2>1 Million users</h2><p>I
 launched SpaceHey at the end of 2020 - I had just graduated high-school,
 and the world was on Covid lockdown. I made SpaceHey, so my generation 
could experience the early days of social media - without a feed, likes 
and whatnot - but instead with colorful, customizable profiles, bulletins and forums. I didn't plan to create anything <i>big</i> - I just had some fun creating this site and improving my coding skills at the same time.</p><p>Still, three and a half years later - SpaceHey has indeed become <i>big</i>.
 One million people is an incredibly huge number of people - it's&nbsp; simply crazy! If someone would've told my 18-year-old self in 2020, I 
would've never believed them. And yet - here we are. I am so incredibly 
thankful for all the support over the past three and a half years - the 
friends I made along the way and the lessons I've learned - both in 
running a community as big as this one as well as the technical challenges that came along.</p><p>One
 million people from all over the world have used SpaceHey so far - an 
independently run platform that does not track you and does not show 
you personalized feeds nor ads. My mission is not to become another big 
social network like <i>Facebook</i> or <i>Twitter</i> (I don't think 
I'll ever call it "X") - but rather trying to be different. More 
personal, more fun to use, and more humane. And I'm proud to say that 
this mission is still very much alive - no matter if there were 500 
users or 1,000,000.<br></p><p>If you like SpaceHey and want to support the platform, you can support me <a href="https://spacehey.com/support" target="_self" rel="ugc">here</a>, and there is also a special #1 Million Merch drop available <a href="https://shop.spacehey.com/" target="_self" rel="ugc">here</a>
 to support SpaceHey. Your support - no matter if it's a donation or a 
Merch order - is what keeps SpaceHey running: thank you!!<br></p><h2>Improving SpaceHey</h2><p>I've
 stopped myself from working on any new features in the past months, but
 rather improve the existing ones and make SpaceHey overall a bit 
smoother. It wasn't easy - but I think it was worth it. You may have 
already noticed less downtime and less App crashes in the past weeks - 
and there are some more improvements coming soon.</p><p>I'm now also 
starting to work on some new features again - which is super fun - and I can't 
wait to share more with you soon (T8 👀) - so stay tuned!<br></p><h2>Keeping SpaceHey safe</h2><p>Another
 big topic I worked on in the past months is safety. As more and more 
people joined SpaceHey, the bots and spammers also increased. Spam, 
hate speech, and other kinds of harmful content has no place on SpaceHey -
 that's why a solution was needed, and eventually found.<br></p><p>The 
solution isn't actually one solution - but a combination of multiple. On
 the one hand, I've implemented more ways to prevent spam in the first 
place - and on the other hand, I've developed more ways to combat 
existing spam. I've expanded the <a href="https://spacehey.com/modapplication" target="_self" rel="ugc">volunteer moderation team</a> and improved the ways the team can discover spam, react to <a href="https://spacehey.com/report" target="_self" rel="ugc">reports</a>
 and keep track of rule violations. I am immensely thankful to the 
volunteers helping me, and I think we are on a great path to keep 
SpaceHey safe.</p><p>If you come across harmful content on SpaceHey, 
please click the "Report" icon next to it, and we'll check it. Thank you
 for doing your part!<br></p><h2>The next steps</h2><p>I am super 
thrilled to keep working on SpaceHey - there are so many awesome, 
talented and fun people here. I can't wait to keep improving the site 
and the App and keep working on some great new features in the near 
future. I am super happy to have you all here, and I hope you are 
enjoying this journey as much as I do!<br></p><h2>Thank you!</h2><p>Last but not least, a <b>huge thank you</b> to every single one of you - you are the people who make SpaceHey what it is - you make it awesome. Thank you so, so much!<br></p><p>Have an awesome day &amp; thank you for using SpaceHey!<br><i>An</i><br></p>

<p>If you vis­it Osa­ka, you’ll be urged to see two old build­ings in par­tic­u­lar: Osa­ka Cas­tle and Shiten­nō-ji (above), Japan’s first Bud­dhist tem­ple. In behold­ing both, you’ll behold the work of con­struc­tion firm <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kong%C5%8D_Gumi">Kongō Gumi</a> (金剛組), the old­est con­tin­u­ous­ly run com­pa­ny in the world. It was with the build­ing of Shiten­nō-ji, com­mis­sioned by Prince Shō­toku Taishi in the year 578, that brought it into exis­tence in the first place. Back then, “Japan was pre­dom­i­nant­ly Shin­to and had no <em>miyadaiku</em> (car­pen­ters trained in the art of build­ing Bud­dhist tem­ples),” <a href="https://worksthatwork.com/3/kongo-gumi">writes Irene Her­rera at <em>Works that Work</em></a><em>,</em> “so the prince hired three skilled men from Baek­je, a Bud­dhist state in what is now Korea,” among them a cer­tain Kongō Shiget­su.</p>
<p>There­after, Kongō Gumi con­tin­ued to oper­ate inde­pen­dent­ly for more than 1,400 years, run by 40 gen­er­a­tions of Kongō Shiget­su’s descen­dants. By the time Toy­oto­mi Hideyoshi had the com­pa­ny build Osa­ka Cas­tle in 1583, it had been estab­lished for near­ly a mil­len­ni­um. In the cen­turies since, “the cas­tle has been destroyed repeat­ed­ly by fire and light­ning,” Her­rera writes. “Kongō Gumi pros­pered because of these major recon­struc­tions, which pro­vid­ed them with plen­ty of work.” Through­out most of its long his­to­ry, an even stead­ier busi­ness came from their spe­cial­ty of build­ing Bud­dhist tem­ples, at least until seri­ous chal­lenges to that busi­ness mod­el arose in the twen­ti­eth cen­tu­ry.</p>

<p>“World War II brought sig­nif­i­cant changes to Japan, and the demand for tem­ple con­struc­tion waned,” <a href="https://www.toki.tokyo/blogt/2023/8/9/kong-gumi-co-ltd-the-enduring-legacy-of-japans-oldest-company">says the tourism com­pa­ny Toki</a>. “Sens­ing the shift­ing tides of the time, the com­pa­ny made a strate­gic deci­sion to piv­ot its exper­tise towards a new endeav­or: the craft­ing of coffins.” Gov­ern­men­tal per­mis­sion was arranged by the wid­ow of Kongō Haruichi, Kongō Gumi’s 37th leader, who’d tak­en his own life out of finan­cial despair inflict­ed by the Shōwa Depres­sion of the nine­teen-twen­ties. Here time at the head of the com­pa­ny illus­trates its long-held will­ing­ness to grant lead­er­ship duties not just to first sons, but to fam­i­ly mem­bers best suit­ed to do the job; for that rea­son, the his­to­ry of the Kongō clan involves many sons-in-law delib­er­ate­ly sought out for that pur­pose.</p>

</div>

<p>The com­bined forces of the decline of Bud­dhism and the pop­ping of Japan’s real-estate bub­ble in the nineties even­tu­al­ly forced Kongō Gumi to become a sub­sidiary of Taka­mat­su Con­struc­tion Group in Jan­u­ary 2006. “The cur­rent Kongō Gumi work­force has only one mem­ber of the Kongō fam­i­ly,” <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Companies/Japan-s-oldest-company-defies-time-with-merit-based-succession">the Nikkei Asia report­ed in 2020</a>, “a daugh­ter of the 40th head of the fam­i­ly” who “now serves as the 41st head.” But its <em>miyadaiku</em> — dis­tinc­tive­ly orga­nized into eight inde­pen­dent <em>kumi</em>, or groups — con­tin­ue to do the work they always have, with ever-more-refined ver­sions of the tra­di­tion­al tools and tech­niques they’ve been using for near­ly a mil­len­ni­um and a half. Kongō Gumi con­tin­ues to receive inter­na­tion­al atten­tion for main­tain­ing its high lev­el of crafts­man­ship, but view­ers of Amer­i­can TV dra­ma in recent years will also appre­ci­ate that its hav­ing solved the prob­lem of suc­ces­sion.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>🚀 3.5 sec to Linux userspace code</p><h3 id="motivation">Motivation<a href="#motivation" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h3><p>A while ago, the <a href="https://kittenlabs.de/solarcampi/">SolarCamPi</a> project, a off-grid solar-powered WiFi camera, was built.</p><p>In this project, a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W is being booted into Linux, a picture is taken, WiFi connectivity is established and the Pi is shut down again (to save power).
This repeats every couple of minutes to always deliver a fresh image to a cloud service.</p><p><img src="https://kittenlabs.de/blog/2024/09/01/extreme-pi-boot-optimization/IMG_4607.jpg" width="49%" alt="Weatherproof enclosure, with 7.2Ah lead-gel battery and SolarCamPi inside"> <img src="https://kittenlabs.de/blog/2024/09/01/extreme-pi-boot-optimization/IMG_4629.jpg" width="49%" alt="Mast, with solar panel, WiFi antenna and SolarCamPi enclosure mounted to it, in nature"></p><p>Each second the Pi Zero is powered up uses valuable electricity, which is a scarce resource in a solar-powered device (at least in West European winters…).<br>The user space application (server connection, picture upload, etc.) was already optimized as best as possible.<br>The electronics setup was also specifically designed to use as little power as possible while asleep.</p><p>There a 2 possible ways to reduce total energy consumption further:</p><ul><li>decrease power consumption / current</li><li>decrease time spent running</li></ul><p>However, in some situations a balance needs to be found between the two.
For example: Disabling CPU turbo just to save some current consumption is a bad choice, because the resulting extra time will use more energy than just getting the job done quickly and shutting off.
We want the least area under the graph (of current vs. time) possible.</p><h3 id="hardware-setup">Hardware setup<a href="#hardware-setup" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h3><p>Having a short cycle time between making a change and actually seeing it run is critical when optimizing embedded boot processes.
Swapping SD cards, messing with card readers and power supplies while working is distracting and annoying.</p><p>In order to avoid this, a number of useful tools exist:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-hardware/Power-Profiler-Kit-2" target="_blank">Nordic Power Profiler Kit II</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/linux-automation/usbsdmux" target="_blank">USB-SD-Mux Fast</a></li><li>USB-UART converter</li></ul><p><img src="https://kittenlabs.de/blog/2024/09/01/extreme-pi-boot-optimization/featured-DSC01414.jpg" width="80%" alt="Hardware setup, Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W, USB-SD-Mux and PPK2"></p><h5 id="power-profiler-kit">Power Profiler Kit<a href="#power-profiler-kit" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5><p>The Power Profiler Kit II (now called PPK) can supply power to a device-under-test (DUT) and will measure it accurately over time.
You can enable/disable the DUT, see the power consumption at any point and also see the status of 8 digital inputs!
We’ll connect one of the digital inputs to a GPIO pin on the Raspberry Pi.</p><p>This way, the first action of “our application” (aka the finish line) will be to toggle the GPIO pin.
We then just have to measure the time between power-up and GPIO toggle.</p><h5 id="usb-sd-mux">USB-SD-Mux<a href="#usb-sd-mux" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5><p>The USB-SD-Mux is a very useful tool for hardware hackers - it’s an interposer between a microSD card and a DUT with a USB-C interface.
A computer can “steal” the microSD card from the DUT, rewrite its contents and then plug the microSD card back into the DUT, without ever having to touch the device.</p><p>This makes the workflow of testing changes <em>much</em> easier and faster by avoiding unplugging the card, plugging it into a microSD reader, flashing it, plugging the card back into the DUT, etc. It can even be used to automate the reset or power of the DUT with on-board GPIOs.</p><h5 id="usb-uart-converter">USB-UART converter<a href="#usb-uart-converter" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5><p>Some form of UART interface is pretty much required. These changes will break system boot, WiFi connectivity, etc. at some point and without a UART console we would be flying blind. A standard CP2102, FTDI, etc. will work well.</p><h3 id="measurement--test-setup">Measurement / Test setup<a href="#measurement--test-setup" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h3><p>On a clean Debian 12 (bookworm) arm64 Lite image, the <code>/boot/firmware/cmdline.txt</code> file was modified to include <code>init=/init.sh</code>.
This means that the kernel will execute the script at <code>/init.sh</code> as the very first thing in userspace (before running systemd or anything else).</p><p>Such an <code>init.sh</code> script might look like this:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span><span>#!/bin/bash
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span>
</span></span><span><span>gpioset <span>0</span> <span>4</span><span>=</span><span>0</span>

</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>exec</span> /sbin/init
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>which will toggle the GPIO4 and then resume normal boot by replacing itself with <code>/sbin/init</code> (aka systemd).</p><p><img src="https://kittenlabs.de/blog/2024/09/01/extreme-pi-boot-optimization/debian12-lite-arm64-initsh.png" alt="Power Profiler screenshot, showing GPIO4 going low after about 12s"></p><p>In this screenshot from Nordic’s Power Profiler software, you can see the current consumption of the Raspberry Pi (at 5V) while booting.
After about 12 seconds, digital input 0 is going low, showing that our <code>init.sh</code> was executed.</p><p>In doing so, a total charge of 1.90 coulomb (coulomb and ampere-seconds are equivalent) was used.<br>Calculating <code>1.9As * 5.0V</code> comes out to <code>9.5Ws</code> energy usage for this boot process.</p><p>For reference: A single AA-alkaline battery can deliver about 13500 Ws of energy.</p><h3 id="reducing-current">Reducing current<a href="#reducing-current" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h3><p>Let’s get the easy part out of the way first and reduce the operating current as much as possible.</p><h5 id="disabling-hdmi">Disabling HDMI<a href="#disabling-hdmi" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5><p>We can disable the HDMI encoder entirely. Disabling the GPU is not possible, because we need it to encode our camera data.
If your application doesn’t require camera/GPU support, try disabling the GPU entirely.</p><p>This reduces the current consumption from 136.7mA down to 122.6mA (over 10%!).</p><p>Relevant config.txt parameters:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="ini"><span><span><span># disable HDMI (saves power)</span>

<img src="https://kittenlabs.de/blog/2024/09/01/extreme-pi-boot-optimization/turbo-defaults.png" alt="Power Profiler screenshot, showing a total current usage of 1.62C/As"></p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="ini"><span><span><span>force_turbo</span><span>=</span><span>0</span>
