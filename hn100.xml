<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Image Text</p>
<p>Re-Logic</p>
<p>The team at Re-Logic has been watching the recent events surrounding Unity with both interest and sadness. The loss of a formerly-leading and user-friendly game engine to the darker forces that negatively impact so much of the gaming industry has left us dismayed to put it mildly. While we do not personally use Unity outside of a few elements on our console/mobile platforms), we feel like we cannot sit idly by as these predatory moves are made against studios everywhere.</p>
<p>We unequivocally condemn and reject the recent TOS/fee changes proposed by Unity and the underhanded way they were rolled out. The flippant manner with which years of trust cultivated by Unity were cast aside for yet another way to squeeze publishers, studios, and gamers is the saddest part. That this move was wholly unnecessary pushes things into the tragedy category - a cautionary tale the industry will not soon forget.</p>
<p>We do not feel that a simple public statement is sufficient. Even if Unity were to recant their policies and statements, the destruction of trust is not so easily repaired. We strongly feel that it is now equally important to get behind some of the other up-and-coming open source game engines. Lighting some candles in an otherwise dark moment. To that end, we are donating $100,000 to each of the open source engines listed below.</p>
<p>Additionally, we are sponsoring each of these projects with $1,000/month each moving forward. All we ask in return is that they remain good people and keep doing all that they can to make these engines powerful and approachable for developers everywhere.</p>
<p>Godot Logo
FNA Logo</p>
<p>Re-Logic has always been supportive of game developers and indie studios that do things the right way. We feel that our actions in this moment are the best way to carry that mission forward - by accelerating and strengthening competing open source game engines, we hope to empower and assist studios that are struggling with how best to proceed given these recent events.</p>

            <link>https://hardfault.life/p/organic-maps-review</link>
            <guid>37592712</guid>
            <pubDate>Thu, 21 Sep 2023 02:54:09 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://hardfault.life/p/organic-maps-review">https://hardfault.life/p/organic-maps-review</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37592712">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A couple weeks ago while perusing Hacker News, I came across an open-source maps app
called <a href="https://organicmaps.app/">Organic Maps</a>. Proudly billing itself as privacy-focused and
open-source, Organic Maps’ website claims that it is “one of a few applications
nowadays that supports 100% of features without an active internet connection.”</p>
<h2>A World’s Worth Of Doubts</h2>
<p>Map apps are complicated. They must handle tons and tons of road
data. That data has to be accurate - even the most complex interchanges must be
charted correctly. That data needs to be kept up-to-date with information about
closures and other conditions. The routing algorithm has to be effective enough
to get the user to their destination in a safe and timely manner. It also can’t
just sit there saying “recalculating” for minutes on end every time you make a
wrong turn.</p>
<p>Google Maps, Apple Maps, and Waze have elevated the average person’s expectations for a maps app.
15 years ago, a little Garmin GPS mounted to your windshield would give
simple “turn left, turn right” commands using data loaded to an SD card. Today,
a maps app must know if there is traffic ahead, and re-route you accordingly.
It must know which lane(s) you need to use to make a turn. It must know if
there is a state trooper hiding around the corner with a radar gun. It must
know about speed cameras, stalled vehicles, and construction, and all of this
data must be received in real time… right?</p>
<h2>Organic Maps Under Pressure</h2>
<p>I had an emergency last week that requried me to drive more than 300 miles into
the rural Midwest with my fiancee. Having learned of this emergency mere minutes
after reading about Organic Maps, I decided to install the app and put it to
the test on this sudden road trip.</p>
<p>My first stop was downtown Chicago, where I would pick up my fiancee before
leaving the city. I didn’t need the app for this part of the drive, but I
figured it would make a good sanity check. Thankfully, Organic Maps gave me a
sane route that used the interstate and major streets competently.</p>
<p>I was pleased initially, but then I looked at its ETA: 4 minutes! To drive 5
miles! In Chicago! As it turns out, Organic Maps has no traffic data. I already
felt like I had made a mistake by even giving this thing a try. If it doesn’t
know about traffic, then surely
it will be worthless in one of the largest and most congested cities in the
United States!</p>
<p>I opened Google Maps to compare. Google happily presented me with
long stretches of red, indicating the heavy traffic that I knew was there. It
estimated that I would take 14 minutes to arrive downtown (it was right). Yet,
Google chose the same route as Organic Maps. <strong>Google’s traffic data offered me
a much more accurate arrival time, but Google Maps couldn’t actually get me to my
destination faster than Organic Maps.</strong></p>
<p>As it turns out, this wasn’t a fluke. Google Maps and Waze altered our
expectations for a map app’s capabilities, without actually getting
us to our destinations faster. <a href="https://trid.trb.org/view/1495267">This study</a> indicates that modern maps apps
haven’t magically gotten rid of traffic jams, though they have managed to clog up
local streets that didn’t see heavy traffic before. Other sources agree with
this conclusion, including <a href="https://citymonitor.ai/community/neighbourhoods/google-maps-local-traffic">this article from City Monitor</a> that cites some
fascinating UK Department of Transport data. The Atlantic also has
<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/03/mapping-apps-and-the-price-of-anarchy/555551/">a great writeup</a> on the topic.
Even the most clever of traffic-aware apps can’t get you to your destination a
whole lot faster than a “dumb” app. Traffic is sort of like
energy: you can move it around, but you can’t get rid of it.</p>
<h2>The First Drive</h2>
<p>My impression of Organic Maps immediately improved when I started driving. It
talks! It knows exit numbers! It can tell you which lanes to use! Sure, it isn’t
as polished as Google Maps, but all of the functionality is present. The UI is
high-contrast and easy to read, although I wish the text showing exit
numbers/street names was a little bigger. When you’re simply on the road and
following directions, Organic Maps feels every bit as intuitive as Google Maps.</p>
<p>As my fiancee and I prepared to set off into the boonies, I plugged in the address of our
hotel. About 45 seconds later, Organic Maps returned the 300-mile route to
our destination. It can take a lot longer to calculate longer routes using your
phone’s processor instead of a huge cloud server. It didn’t really bother me
though; 45 seconds is nothing compared to the 6-hour trip ahead. If that’s the
cost of using a maps app that doesn’t spray your personal data all over the
internet, I’ll pay it.</p>
<h2>Heading Into The Boonies</h2>
<p>This drive is familiar to me. As a child, I saw these same roads drift by from
the backseat of a minivan. This was before smartphones and tablets
were in the hands of every child in the country, so I actually paid
attention to the road signs, the condition of each highway, and the
subtle changes in the natural environment. I know those long stretches of the
rural Midwest like a child knows their hometown, through a mental map as vivid
as it is inaccurate.</p>
<p>As we sliced through miles of picturesque nothingness, Organic Maps blended
seamlessly into the background. As interstates gave way to state numbered highways, Organic Maps’
charmingly robotic voice prompted me a couple thousand feet in advance of each
turn. As state numbered highways gave way to county roads, Organic Maps
avoided dirt roads that would look like shortcuts to the uninformed. When the
sun fell below the horizon, Organic Maps switched to a dark mode that prevented
my phone’s screen from blinding me as a drove.</p>
<p>Organic Maps was at its best on this long drive. After I stopped for gas in
a town with no cell service, I had no trouble getting my maps back. Organic
Maps doesn’t need an internet connection to route you to your destination. This
no-network-necessary approach means that you don’t have to fear losing your
route when cell service isn’t available. This feature alone is enough reason to
keep it installed on your phone, just in case you need it.</p>
<h2>Putting a Town On The Map</h2>
<p>Organic Maps performed exceptionally well while driving through rural America,
but once I arrived at my destination, it struggled. This
town isn’t small (technically it qualifies as a city!), and it’s well-known within
its state, yet there were dozens of businesses missing from the map. Many of the
missing businesses weren’t new either - at least a few
have been around for over a decade, yet somehow never made it into
Organic Maps’ database. I could only find my hotel by address; Organic Maps
knew the address, but didn’t know that there was a hotel there.</p>
<p>Organic Maps uses an open map database called <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a>. Although
OpenStreetMap has very accurate data about streets, addresses, and highways,
its knowledge of what’s actually located at any given address is spotty at best.
Thankfully, Organic Maps has a half-solution to this problem: contribute OpenStreetMap data
yourself! Organic Maps lets you contribute data to OpenStreetMap. Simply press
and hold where the business should be, tap “add a place to the map,” and fill
out the form. I ended up spending an hour of downtime adding information about
various restaurants, libraries, museums, and stores around town. It
would take far longer to add every business in the area, but it’s a good start.
I love being able to contribute to OpenStreetMap, and Organic Maps makes it easy
to do that.</p>
<h2>Fumbling The ITR</h2>
<p>If you need to come into downtown Chicago from the east, there are two ways you
can go. The expensive way is to take I-90 via the Indiana Toll Road (“ITR” for
short) and Chicago Skyway. The cheap way is to take I-94 south to the I-80/I-294
interchange. Both routes eventually put you on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Ryan_Expressway">the Dan Ryan</a>, a 14-lane
behemoth heading straight into the heart of the city. Just writing about the
ITR makes my skin crawl, and apparently it also makes Organic Maps upset.</p>
<p>Nearing the end of the drive home, as my impending merge onto the ITR loomed,
Organic Maps did something strange. It told me to take the wrong ramp, which
would have put me on the ITR heading west, then make a U-turn and head
east. I know this drive well enough to know it was asking me to do something
physically impossible. So, I did what I had been trying to avoid the entire
weekend: I disobeyed Organic Maps. I took the correct ramp, Organic Maps quickly
recalculated, and everything went back to normal.</p>
<p>I tried re-creating this problem a couple days later, and Organic Maps did it
again! Here is the incorrect route:</p>
<p><img src="https://hardfault.life/public/organic-maps-review/organic-bad-route.png" alt="Screenshot of the Organic Maps app showing an incorrect route"></p>
<p>Notice the little kink in the route near the top-right corner of the image -
that’s a U-turn that doesn’t actually exist. Even more bizarre is that
the <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a> website gets the correct route:</p>
<p><img src="https://hardfault.life/public/organic-maps-review/osm-correct-route.png" alt="Screenshot of the OpenStreetMap web app showing the correct route"></p>
<p>This shook my confidence in Organic Maps, but after more than 1000 miles of
otherwise worry-free routing, this seemed to be a one-off bug. I created an
<a href="https://github.com/organicmaps/organicmaps/issues/5983">issue on GitHub</a> and the developers responded swiftly. Unfortunately, it can
take a few weeks for an OpenStreetMap update to get pushed out, so now I
(and anyone else driving westbound into Chicago) must wait for the new, more
accurate map data.</p>
<h2>Returning Home</h2>
<p>Organic Maps has proven itself to be a competent alternative to Google Maps,
at least for my purposes. Its UI is simple and intuitive. Organic Maps gets me
to my destinations as quickly and safely as Google Maps, even though it doesn’t
have Google’s extensive traffic data. Organic Maps isn’t operated by megacorp
trying to make you buy things.</p>
<p>Organic Maps is certainly not for everyone. If you are constantly
running out of storage space on your phone, Organic Maps’ need to download
hundreds of megabytes of map data onto your phone will be a non-starter. On the
other hand, its offline map storage means that it doesn’t need an internet
connection to get you to your destination.</p>
<p>Incorrect or missing businesses are the biggest inconvenience of using Organic Maps.
I occasionally switch back to Google Maps when a business or address is missing.
In this regard, Organic Maps can only improve if people use it. If your destination
is missing, add it. If some information is out of date, update it. I would
strongly encourage anyone to try Organic Maps for a week or two. I gave it an
honest chance, and it made a lasting impression.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <article role="article">
  
  
  <div><p><span>The U.K. Parliament </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uks-online-safety-bill-passed-by-parliament-2023-09-19/"><span>has passed the Online Safety Bill</span></a><span> (OSB), which says it will make the U.K. “the safest place” in the world to be online. In reality, the OSB will lead to a much more censored, locked-down internet for British users. The bill could empower the government to undermine not just the privacy and security of U.K. residents, but <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/if-you-build-it-they-will-come-apple-has-opened-backdoor-increased-surveillance">internet users worldwide</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b>A Backdoor That Undermines Encryption</b></h3>
<p><span>A clause of the bill allows Ofcom, the British telecom regulator, to serve a notice requiring tech companies to scan their users–all of them–for child abuse content.This would&nbsp;affect&nbsp;even messages and files that are end-to-end encrypted to protect user privacy. As enacted, the OSB allows the government to force companies to build technology that can scan regardless of encryption–in other words, build a backdoor.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>These types of </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/11/why-adding-client-side-scanning-breaks-end-end-encryption"><span>client-side scanning systems</span></a><span> amount to </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.07450"><span>“Bugs in Our Pockets,”</span></a><span> and a group of leading computer security experts has reached the same conclusion as EFF–they undermine privacy and security for everyone. That’s why EFF has </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/07/uk-government-very-close-eroding-encryption-worldwide"><span>strongly opposed the OSB</span></a><span> for </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/08/uks-online-safety-bill-attacks-free-speech-and-encryption"><span>years</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It’s a basic human right to have a private conversation. This right is even more important for the most vulnerable people. If the U.K. uses its new powers to scan people’s data, lawmakers will damage&nbsp;the security people need to protect themselves from harassers, data thieves, authoritarian governments, and others. Paradoxically, U.K. lawmakers have created these new risks in the name of online safety.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The U.K. government has </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/09/uk-government-knows-how-extreme-online-safety-bill"><span>made some recent statements</span></a><span> </span><span>indicating that it actually realizes that getting around end-to-end encryption isn’t compatible with protecting user privacy. But given the text of the law, neither the government’s private statements to tech companies, nor its weak public assurances, are enough to protect the human rights of British people or internet users around the world.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b>Censorship and Age-Gating</b></h3>
<p><span>Online platforms will be expected to remove content that the U.K. government views as inappropriate for children. If they don’t, they’ll face heavy penalties. The problem is, in the U.K. as in the U.S., </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/08/us-government-about-control-speech-online-protect-kids"><span>people do not agree about what type of content is harmful for kids</span></a><span>. Putting that decision in the hands of government regulators will lead to politicized censorship decisions.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The OSB will also lead to </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/03/age-verification-mandates-would-undermine-anonymity-online"><span>harmful age-verification systems</span></a><span>. This violates fundamental principles about anonymous and simple access that has existed since the beginning of the Internet. You shouldn’t have to show your ID to get online. Age-gating systems meant to keep out kids invariably lead to adults losing their rights to private speech, and anonymous speech, which is sometimes necessary.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In the coming months, we’ll be watching what type of regulations the U.K. government publishes describing how it will use these new powers to regulate the internet. If the regulators claim their right to require the creation of dangerous backdoors in encrypted services, we expect encrypted messaging services to </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/27/an-encryption-exodus-looms-over-uks-online-safety-bill/"><span>keep their promises</span></a><span> and withdraw from the U.K. if that nation’s government&nbsp;compromises their ability to protect other users.&nbsp;</span></p>

    <p>Real median household income after taxes fell 8.8% to $64,240 from 2021 to 2022 and the poverty rate after taxes as measured by the Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) increased 59% to 12.4%.</p>
<p>These significant changes in <i>after-tax</i> income and poverty rates of U.S. households were much larger than the annual changes in <i>before-tax</i> income and poverty, according to U.S. Census Bureau data released today.</p>

</div><div>
<p>The expiration of expansions to refundable tax credits had a particularly important impact on SPM poverty.</p>

    

</div><div id="textcore-824ce80faa">
    <p>The Census Bureau reports, <i>Income in the United States: 2022 </i>and <i>Poverty in the United States: 2022</i>, show that <i>before</i> taxes, median household income declined 2.3% to $74,580 and the poverty rate (11.5%), as measured by the official poverty measure, was not statistically different from 2021.</p>
<p>This dramatic difference can be attributed to key changes in federal tax policy.</p>
<p>In 2022, several policies enacted by the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/american-rescue-plan/" target="_blank">American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA)</a> expired, including an expansion of the <a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/changes-to-the-earned-income-tax-credit-for-the-2022-filing-season" target="_blank">Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)</a> for filers without children and full refundability of the <a href="https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/2021-child-tax-credit-and-advance-child-tax-credit-payments-topic-c-calculation-of-the-2021-child-tax-credit" target="_blank">Child Tax Credit (CTC)</a> and <a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/child-and-dependent-care-credit-faqs" target="_blank">Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit (CDCTC)</a>. ARPA also increased the maximum amount of CTC.</p>
<p>In 2020 and 2021, most households also received <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/coronavirus/assistance-for-american-families-and-workers/economic-impact-payments" target="_blank">Economic Impact Payments (EIP)</a> that were no longer issued in 2022.</p>
<p>The rollback of these tax policies had the largest effect on post-tax income among the nation’s lowest-income households.</p>
<p>In 2021, for example, post-tax income at the 10th percentile, meaning at the bottom of the income distribution, was 17.1% <i>higher</i> than the corresponding pretax income estimate, reflecting the substantial boost that lower-income households received that year from the EIP and expanded CTC.</p>
<p>In contrast, the 2022 estimates of pretax and post-tax income at the 10th percentile were not significantly different (Figure 1).</p>
<p>Lower post-tax income, particularly at the bottom of the income distribution, also resulted in an increase in income inequality.</p>
<p>The Gini index, a common measure of how spread out or unequal incomes are, for pretax income was 1.2% lower in 2022 than in 2021, reflecting real income declines at the top of the income distribution. However, the post-tax Gini index was 3.2% higher due to substantial declines in post-tax income among lower-income households.</p>

</div><div id="textcore-44a48ec46d">
    <p>The decline in post-tax income also corresponds to an increase in the SPM, which incorporates noncash government assistance programs like the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP) and taxes, through income and payroll taxes and refundable tax credits like the CTC and EITC. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The 4.6 percentage point increase in the SPM poverty rate was driven almost entirely by the change in tax policy (Figure 2). &nbsp;When a version of the SPM excluding taxes is examined, the poverty rate did not change: 12.6% in 2022, not statistically different from 2021.</p>

</div><div id="textcore-a1e0b57298">
    <p>The expiration of expansions to refundable tax credits had a particularly important impact on SPM poverty (Figure 3).</p>
<p>In 2021, 9.6 million people were kept out of poverty due to refundable tax credits. This number declined to 6.4 million in 2022 as the pandemic era expansions expired. The effect declined for each of the major age groups, with 3.5 million children lifted out of poverty in 2022 compared to 4.9 million in 2021.</p>

<p>The LTS (long-term support) period for the Linux kernel is being cut down. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/09/android-users-rejoice-linux-kernel-lts-releases-are-now-good-for-6-years/">In 2017</a>, the kernel jumped from two years of support to six. Now, six years later, it turns out that's a lot of work. <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/long-term-support-for-linux-kernel-to-be-cut-as-maintainence-remains-under-strain/">ZDNet</a> reports that at the Open Source Summit Europe this week (videos will be out in a few weeks), <a href="https://lwn.net/">Linux Weekly News</a> executive editor Jonathan Corbet announced the Linux kernel will return to two years of LTS support.</p>
<p>The plan to cut back down to two years isn't instant. The Linux community is still honoring the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/category/releases.html">current end-of-life timelines</a>, so 6.1, 5.15, 5.10, 5.4, 4.19, and 4.14 are still six years, but new kernels will only get two years. Even this six-year window was supposed to be an optional thing when it started, with the release page FAQ saying, "Each new longterm kernel usually starts with only a 2-year projected EOL that can be extended further if there is enough interest from the industry at large to help support it for a longer period of time." The reality was that everything received a six-year life span, and now that will no longer be the case.</p>
<p>Corbet cited a mix of lack of use and a lack of support for why Linux is cutting back on LTS kernels. Corbet says, "There's really no point to maintaining [old kernels] for that long because people are not using them." The other big problem is the burnout from maintainers, which are often unpaid and could use a lot more support from the billion-dollar companies that benefit from using Linux.</p>                                            
                                                        
<h2>But what about Android?</h2>
<p>Two years seems like a fine support window for PCs, but what about Android? The original LTS extension was mainly made with Android and Internet of Things devices in mind—it was announced during an Android Linux talk by Google developer Iliyan Malchev. The problem was that on PCs, two years only represents the time between kernel <em>updates</em>, so that's a fine timeline. Embedded devices tend not to update the kernel, though, so those "two years" represent most of the development cycle and the entire consumer support window, and that's not long enough.</p>

<p>The original picture Google painted in 2017 was that phones take two years to be developed and that the kernel is locked in near the beginning of the engineering process. The LTS kernel would be hitting end-of-life right around when the phone finally shipped, and customers would use obsolete kernels for the lifetime of their devices. The Android kernel development process is a whole pile of forks: First, Google forks from a new Linux LTS to make the "Android Common" kernel, then that is sent to SoC vendors like Qualcomm and forked for each model of SoC, then <em>that</em> fork is sent to device makers, which fork it again for each model of device. It takes a while.</p>
<p>Are things better in 2023? I don't know about that. The Android kernel docs have a Linux "<a href="https://source.android.com/docs/core/architecture/kernel/android-common#compatibility-matrix">compatibility matrix</a>" for each version of Android, and Android 14—releasing any day now—still supports launching new devices with Linux 5.4, a 4-year-old kernel. That's going to <em>start</em> a new window of support, remember, so even with a paltry two years of ownership, that's a six-year-old kernel. That's also just for new devices. You can upgrade to Android 14 from Linux 4.14, which goes back to 2017. You can see how Google arrived at the six-year number. It's hard to know what every cheap Android phone is doing at any given time, but I assume these are all supported because they are still needed.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>There are also smartwatches to consider, where things are even worse. The Pixel Watch is so ashamed of its Linux kernel that it's not even listed in the settings, but the device launched in 2022 with <a href="https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1580695517763276800/photo/1">Linux kernel 4.19</a>, a 4-year-old kernel at the time.</p>
<figure><img alt="Android's GKI has a bunch of modules for hardware support that you can plug into the kernel. " src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/generic-kernel-image-architecture.png" width="740" height="395"><figcaption><p>Android's GKI has a bunch of modules for hardware support that you can plug into the kernel. </p><p>Google</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>Android's big advancement since 2017 is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/11/android-12-the-ars-technica-review/3/">the GKI</a>, Google's "Generic Kernel Image," which cuts down on the "fork of a fork of a fork" Android kernel development process. That first fork, Android Common, adds all the Android compatibility stuff to Linux, so that still happens with the GKI, but fork No. 2 and 3 are for hardware compatibility, and the GKI instead moves those to modules. Further out, there is a plan to move to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/09/android-to-take-an-upstream-first-development-model-for-the-linux-kernel/">mainline Linux.&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>Even GKI phones still don't do major kernel updates, though. You get minor LTS security updates, but the Pixel 6, the first GKI phone, launched with Linux 5.10 and is still on Linux 5.10. That's a 3-year-old kernel. If this trend keeps up, when it gets its last security update in 2027, it will have a 7-year-old kernel. Google <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/09/the-android-11-interview-googlers-answer-our-burning-questions/2/">has said</a> before that major GKI kernel updates are in the plans eventually. There's even mention of <a href="https://source.android.com/docs/core/architecture/kernel/gki-faq">major kernel swaps</a> in the documents, but the landmark of updating a production consumer device to a major new GKI version is not something that has happened yet. <a href="https://9to5google.com/2023/08/28/google-pixel-8-android-os-updates/">Rumor has it</a> that the Pixel 8 will have a longer support window, so maybe we'll see major kernel updates launch with that phone.</p>

        <p>OR</p><p>The story of how a misplaced decimal point at Alameda Research caused a market crash that echoed around the world.</p><p>This incident happened just a few weeks after I joined Alameda. I had just gotten a hang of our engineering workflows and was starting to wrap my head around our trading systems.At a high level, Alameda's trading operated in two modes:</p><p>The main one was our semi-systematic strategies, where traders set model parameters that control a complex automated trading system. This way, traders aren't placing actual trades, but rather fine-tuning an algorithm that decides how to execute those trades at high frequency.</p><p>However every once in a while, a trader would need to manually execute a trade. Usually this might happen if our automated trading systems were being buggy due to market volatility, or if there was an arbitrage opportunity on a venue where we hadn't set up automated trading yet.</p><p>Our automated trading systems handled the vast majority of Alameda's trading. So naturally, we had sanity checks in place to make sure that the orders being sent were reasonable relative to current market prices. Not so for manual trades, which were by nature discretionary.</p><p>The tricky thing about risk is that it's usually invisible, right up until it comes around and bites you in the ass.</p><p>Well, on October 21 2021, an Alameda trader's finger slipped.</p><p>The trader was trying to sell a block of BTC in response to news, and sent out the order via our manual trading system. What they missed was the decimal point was off by a few spaces. Rather than selling BTC at the current market price, they sold it for pennies on the dollar.</p><p>The result was immediate. The price of BTC shot from a high of $65k to as low as $8k on some venues, only to be quickly restored by arbitrageurs.</p><p>The sudden price movement lit crypto Twitter on fire as traders scrambled to figure out what was going on:</p><figure><img src="https://www.adityabaradwaj.com/content/images/2023/09/bitcoin-flash-crash-twitter-collage.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1429" srcset="https://www.adityabaradwaj.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/09/bitcoin-flash-crash-twitter-collage.png 600w, https://www.adityabaradwaj.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/09/bitcoin-flash-crash-twitter-collage.png 1000w, https://www.adityabaradwaj.com/content/images/size/w1600/2023/09/bitcoin-flash-crash-twitter-collage.png 1600w, https://www.adityabaradwaj.com/content/images/2023/09/bitcoin-flash-crash-twitter-collage.png 2100w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>A snapshot of crypto Twitter that day</figcaption></figure><p>News outlets started picking up too.

But because it had been an honest mistake, there wasn't much to do except to implement additional sanity checks for manual trades. And that's what we did.</p><p>That's usually how things worked at Alameda - we would wait until something broke, and then rush to fix it. Which is why it took us so long to implement sanity checks that any "traditional" trading firm would have never started trading without.</p><p>After that, it was back to business as usual. According to SBF, the utility we gained by moving fast outweighed the occasional costs we paid due to poor risk checks, hacks, and the like. This was SBF's work philosophy, and it drove the culture he created at Alameda and FTX</p><p>For almost two years, the BTC flash crash incident has remained a mystery in the minds of the public. Now you know who was responsible, and what was happening behind the scenes.</p><figure><img src="https://www.adityabaradwaj.com/content/images/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-19-at-21.06.36.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1204" height="234" srcset="https://www.adityabaradwaj.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-19-at-21.06.36.png 600w, https://www.adityabaradwaj.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-19-at-21.06.36.png 1000w, https://www.adityabaradwaj.com/content/images/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-19-at-21.06.36.png 1204w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Liked this post?

<p>And neither is any other device maker.&nbsp;This industry is full of "feel good" messaging, but generates 50 million metric tons of e-waste each year. We believe the best way to reduce environmental impact is to create products that last longer, meaning fewer new ones need to be made. Instead of operating on feels, we operate on data and actions.&nbsp;With funding from Intel, we commissioned Fraunhofer IZM to do a detailed life cycle analysis (LCA) on Framework Laptop 13 to help us understand where we are today and where we can continue to improve.&nbsp;Check out our thoughts on reducing environmental impact and download the LCA report <a href="https://frame.work/sustainability">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Production update on Framework Laptop 13 (AMD Ryzen 7040 Series)</h2>

<p>We continue to be on track to start shipments before the end of the month on the new Framework Laptop 13 (AMD Ryzen 7040 Series). Last week we shared that SMT (Mainboard production) had started, and this week we’ve begun final assembly of laptops. We also pulled some early units to send out to press reviewers to make sure that you can see exactly where we’ve landed on performance and battery life.&nbsp;We have another happy bit of news to share with you: our Lead System Architect Kieran was able to implement a firmware solution to reduce power consumption when using HDMI and DP Expansion Cards on the back two slots.&nbsp;The only remaining power issue is with USB-A Expansion Cards on the back slots, which we are investigating a future USB-A Expansion Card hardware revision to resolve.</p>

<h2>Modular gaming handheld by pitstoptech</h2>
<p>We are constantly amazed by the ways community members re-mix modules from Framework Laptops. The most recent mind-blowing example is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd6WtTUf-30" target="_blank" rel="noopener">modular gaming handheld by pitstoptech</a> with detachable controllers, using a Framework Laptop 13 Mainboard and Battery.&nbsp;This specific instance incorporates last year’s 12th Gen Intel Core Mainboard, but with this year’s Ryzen 7040 Mainboards, gaming performance should exceed Steam Deck and other similar handhelds. This is a great way to re-use Mainboards, whether you have a leftover one after upgrading your Framework Laptop or you picked up one of the <a href="https://frame.work/products/mainboard-11th-gen-intel-core?v=FRANFG000B">newly discounted ones</a> in the Marketplace.&nbsp;You can follow along for updates on pitstoptech’s YouTube channel or <a href="https://community.frame.work/t/framework-gaming-handheld-video/36591" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the Framework Community</a>.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
	                <p><img src="https://news.liverpool.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2-Larry.png" alt="Uncovering the wooden structure with a fine spray on the banks of the river" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high"></p>
			<p>Half a million years ago, earlier than was previously thought possible, humans were building structures made of wood, according to new research by a team from the University of Liverpool and Aberystwyth University.</p>
<p>The research, published in the journal <em>Nature, </em>reports on the excavation of well-preserved wood at the archaeological site of Kalambo Falls, Zambia, dating back at least 476,000 years and predating the evolution of our own species, <em>Homo sapiens.</em></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://news.liverpool.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/5-the-wooden-structure.png" alt="The excavation team uncovering the wooden wedge" width="399" height="598"></p>
<p>Expert analysis of stone tool cut-marks on the wood show that these early humans shaped and joined two large logs to make a structure, probably the foundation of a platform or part of a dwelling.</p>
<p>This is the earliest evidence from anywhere in the world of the deliberate crafting of logs to fit together. Until now, evidence for the human use of wood was limited to its use for making fire, digging sticks and spears.</p>
<p>Wood is rarely found in such ancient sites as it usually rots and disappears, but at Kalambo Falls permanently high water levels preserved the wood.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://news.liverpool.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2-Larry-1.png" alt="Researchers uncover wooden artefacts on the banks of the Kalambo River in Zambia, near where the oldest-known use of wood in construction was found" width="481" height="342"></p>
<p>This discovery challenges the prevailing view that Stone Age humans were nomadic. At Kalambo Falls these humans not only had a perennial source of water, but the forest around them provided enough food to enable them to settle and make structures.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/archaeology-classics-and-egyptology/staff/lawrence-barham/">Professor Larry Barham</a>, from the University of Liverpool’s <a href="https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/archaeology-classics-and-egyptology/">Department of Archaeology, Classics and Egyptology</a>, who leads the <a href="https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/archaeology-classics-and-egyptology/">‘Deep Roots of Humanity’</a> research project said:</p>
<blockquote><p>This find has changed how I think about our early ancestors. Forget the label ‘Stone Age,’ look at what these people were doing: they made something new, and large, from wood. They used their intelligence, imagination, and skills to create something they’d never seen before, something that had never previously existed.</p>
<p>They transformed their surroundings to make life easier, even if it was only by making a platform to sit on by the river to do their daily chores. These folks were more like us than we thought.</p></blockquote>
<p>The specialist dating of the finds was undertaken by experts at Aberystwyth University.</p>

<p>They used new luminescence dating techniques, which reveal the last time minerals in the sand surrounding the finds were exposed to sunlight, to determine their age.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.aber.ac.uk/en/dges/staff-profiles/listing/profile/ggd/">Professor Geoff Duller</a> from Aberystwyth University said:</p>
<blockquote><p>At this great age, putting a date on finds is very challenging and we used luminescence dating to do this. These new dating methods have far reaching implications – allowing us to date much further back in time, to piece together sites that give us a glimpse into human evolution. The site at Kalambo Falls had been excavated back in the 1960s when similar pieces of wood were recovered, but they were unable to date them, so the true significance of the site was unclear until now.</p></blockquote>
<p>The site of Kalambo Falls on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalambo_River">Kalambo River</a> lies above a 235 metres (772 foot) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall">waterfall</a> on the border of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zambia">Zambia</a> with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rukwa_Region">Rukwa Region</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanzania">Tanzania</a> at the edge of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Tanganyika">Lake Tanganyika</a>. The area is on a ‘tentative‘ list from UNESCO for becoming a World Heritage site because of its archaeological significance.</p>

<p>Professor Duller added:</p>
<p>“Our research proves that this site is much older than previously thought, so its archaeological significance is now even greater. It adds more weight to the argument that it should be a United Nations World Heritage Site.”</p>

<p>This research forms part of the pioneering ‘Deep Roots of Humanity’ project, an investigation into how human technology developed in the Stone Age. The project is funded by the UK’s Arts and Humanities Research Council and involved teams from Zambia’s National Heritage Conservation Commission, Livingstone Museum, Moto Moto Museum and the National Museum, Lusaka.</p>
<p>Professor Barham added:</p>
<p>“Kalambo Falls is an extraordinary site and a major heritage asset for Zambia. The Deep Roots team is looking forward to more exciting discoveries emerging from its waterlogged sands.”</p>

                      <p>Statistics show that men and boys in the United States today disproportionately suffer from a number of serious problems. Since the 1970s, they’ve seen their wages stagnate and are now far less likely than women to attend or graduate from college. Even more seriously, men are much more likely than women to be afflicted by “deaths of despair”: deaths due to suicide or alcohol or drug abuse. These trends are affecting boys and men across racial groups, and especially working-class boys and men.</p>
<p>Richard Reeves, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, is the author of <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/books/of-boys-and-men/"><i>Of Boys and Men: Why the Modern Male Is Struggling, Why It Matters, and What to Do About It</i></a>. For the <a href="https://www.levernews.com/the-american-masculinity-crisis/"><i>Lever Time</i></a><i> </i>podcast, <i>Jacobin </i>editor at large David Sirota interviewed Reeves about the crisis afflicting men, how right-wing politicians have weaponized it to promote a reactionary agenda, and how the Left might come up with a better response to men’s problems. This transcript has been edited for length and clarity.</p>

                      David Sirota
                </span></p><p>What are some of the most telling signals that the modern male is struggling — and specifically as a group, as distinct from the struggles of the population writ large?</p>

              </div>
            <div>
                <p><span>
                  
                    
                      Richard Reeves
                </span></p><p>Let’s start with the economy and the labor market, where the well-told story about wage stagnation is particularly acute for men. Most American men earned less in 2019 than most American men did in 1979.</p>
<p>Of course, it’s also true that wages didn’t grow that quickly for working-class women by comparison to other women. But women’s wages did grow across the board — just faster at the top than at the bottom — whereas for men you saw wage stagnation.</p>
<p>What that means is that the only reason that middle-class American households saw any rise in their household incomes at all over that period was because of women. It was women’s work, women’s wages. So there’s all kinds of downstream consequences.</p>
<p>Then if we turn to something like education, what we see is a massive overtaking by girls and women of men, such that there’s now a bigger gender gap in education today than there was in 1972. On college campuses, for example, women are further ahead of men now than men were ahead of women when we passed Title IX in 1972.</p>
<p>Some of the consequences for that are difficulties around family formation and deaths of despair. There’s been lots of discussion of deaths of despair — which are from suicide, alcohol, or drugs — but maybe a little less attention to the fact that men are at least three times higher risk of one of those deaths of despair than women are. Deaths of despair are largely a male — and largely a working-class male — problem.</p>

              </div>
          
            <div>
                <p><span>
                  
                    
                      David Sirota
                </span></p><p>There has been a gender wage gap for a very long time. Are you saying that what we’ve seen is that the gap has somewhat narrowed not just because women’s wages are going up, but also because men’s wages have stagnated or actually dropped? There’s an alternate history where everything is improving for both men and women, but it improves more quickly for women to deal with historic disparities. But you’re saying that’s not happening: it’s a negative story for men.</p>

              </div>
            <div>
                <p><span>
                  
                    
                      Richard Reeves
                </span></p><p>In terms of earnings, yes. The gender pay gap is typically measured at the median. So when people hear that women earn eighty-two or eighty-three cents on the dollar versus men, what’s being referred to there is median pay. One reason why the gender pay gap has narrowed over the last few decades is that women’s wages have risen quite sharply at the median — 30-something percent or more — but part of it is because male wages have dropped at the median.</p>
<p>That’s not the main reason for the narrowing, but it’s one of the reasons, and I don’t think it’s controversial to suggest that that’s bad news. If we’d seen similar levels of women’s wage growth at the median, and we hadn’t seen wage stagnation for men, it’s not clear to me that that would have been a worse world. I don’t think many people want to close the gender wage gap by crashing male wages.</p>

<p>At the top of the distribution, men and women have seen rising wages. Up toward that eightieth or ninetieth percentile, women have seen faster wage growth, but both men and women have seen it.</p>
<p>My overall understanding of these labor market trends over the last few decades is that we’ve seen a narrowing of the gender wage gap, for the reasons we just discussed, and a sharp widening of the class wage gap. They’re pulling in different directions. So the gap between the median and the top has gotten much wider, but the gap between men and women at each level has gotten narrower.</p>

                </span></p><p>I want to ask about the maleness part of this, in looking at wages, jobs, education levels, health care, deaths of despair, and so on. How much of this is related to maleness, however we define that, rather than other factors like economic inequality, geography, or education? How do we narrow in on this as a problem of maleness specifically?</p>

                      Richard Reeves
                </span></p><p>There is enough evidence that some of these problems do break quite strongly along male-female lines, so as to justify the attention on men in particular. The male suicide rate is four times higher than the female suicide rate. It has risen by 25 percent in the last decade and rose very sharply between 2020 and 2021, 8 percent for young men alone. And there wasn’t an increase for women.</p>
<p>That isn’t to say that female suicide isn’t a problem; of course it is. Sometimes, when I’m drawing attention to the gaps in education, people will say, no one cared when it was the other way around, when women were that far behind men. To that, my answer is: yeah, people did care. And we did a whole bunch of stuff about it, and quite rightly too. We passed laws; we had significant campaigns to try and overcome it.</p>
<p>To some extent, it becomes an empirical question as to whether there’s enough of a gender gap here on whatever the issue is to say, we should look at that. I would say the same is true the other way around. For example, the gender pay gap we’ve just talked about — just because 40 percent of women earn more than the average man now doesn’t mean there isn’t still an issue about gender pay gaps.</p>
<p>I’d look at the data on it and say, is there a strong enough pattern here to make you think this is worth looking at through that lens? There’ll be a whole bunch of issues where you’re like, “There isn’t much to see here in terms of gender.”</p>
<p>But there are other issues where there clearly is, in one direction or the other, and then I think we should be gender sensitive. We should also look at how that intersects by class, by race, and so on. So we might talk about the gender pay gap, but we shouldn’t forget the fact that white women now earn a lot more than black men.</p>
<p>That wasn’t true in 1979. So white women have seen very strong increases in their wages, such that for every dollar earned by a white woman, a black man earns about eighty-four cents, which is similar to the gender gap.</p>
<p>The point of that is not to say that the gender gap isn’t important and real. It is just to say that it’s very important that we don’t look at these things just through one lens, but try to look at them through different lenses.</p>

                      David Sirota
                </span></p><p>What is fueling this dynamic? Is it mostly the economic issues that you mentioned? Does it have to do with the changing nature of our culture? Is it something in our politics?</p>

              </div>
            <div>
                <p><span>
                  
                    
                      Richard Reeves
                </span></p><p>I put it under three headings. Number one is, almost independently of everything else, the education system isn’t doing very well by lots of our boys and men now. We have a ten percentage point drop in the share of male teachers, incredible underinvestment in apprenticeships and vocational forms of learning, and all kinds of changes in school environments that mean that we’re not serving them very well.</p>
<p>That’s not to suggest that there aren’t plenty of girls who aren’t being served well too. But overall, young men hit the labor market or college or whatever less well-prepared as a result of the education system. The single biggest risk factor for dropping out of college, controlling for everything else, is being male. They struggle throughout education; they might struggle to land in the labor market.</p>
<p>The second bucket is that the labor market has been transformed in the last forty or fifty years in such a way as to make it much more difficult for men with modest levels of education to do OK.</p>

<p>We can have a very long discussion as to why that is: globalization, deunionization, loss of all kinds of jobs, and so on. It’s not because women came into the labor market; it’s because of these other external shocks to the labor market.</p>
<p>Then bucket number three is the most contentious one, in a way. The fact that women have seen such a massive increase in their economic independence means that the basis upon which men and women form families and relationships has been significantly transformed. In the space of not much more than a generation, the presumption of the male breadwinner has largely unraveled. In my view, that’s a great thing.</p>
<p>However, I think that has left a lot of men struggling to catch up with a culture where their role as a breadwinner has been undermined by economic brute facts, and then has been undermined by changes in their relationships to women, and they’ve come into it ill-served as well. So you have underskilled men facing a labor market that’s become a bit more hostile than the one their dads faced, and women who are saying, “Well, I might not need you.” I think all of those feed off each other.</p>

              </div>

                      David Sirota
                </span></p><p>In the past several years, we’ve seen right-wing politicians like Josh Hawley and Ted Cruz talk about the so-called attack on masculinity. We’ve seen YouTubers whose entire business model seems to be repackaging and selling one version of masculinity. We’ve seen gun marketing trying to fuse masculinity with the idea of buying weapons, owning weapons, shooting weapons.</p>
<p>Why do you think these messages have become so effective? What do you think would be a more constructive counternarrative to those kinds of messages?</p>

              </div>
            <div>
                <p><span>
                  
                    
                      Richard Reeves
                </span></p><p>I think they’re effective because, first, they identify some real problems. Hawley’s a great example of this. If you read some passages of Hawley’s book or [listen to him speak], I’m like, yeah, that’s the same data that I’ve got. Yes, I’m with you so far, senator.</p>
<p>But then what he does is he says, these men are struggling, and you know why? And he doesn’t say because of what’s happened to the economy, or because of what’s happening elsewhere. He says, “Because of the Left. Because the Left is obsessed with toxic masculinity, and birthing people, and so on. The Left hates masculinity. The Left hates men. The Left would rather have a world where we got rid of men.”</p>
<p>It’s a straw woman that he creates. He says, “It’s feminism’s fault,” and “If you’re feeling pissed off, if you’re struggling as a man, I hear you, it’s their fault, vote for me. Do I have any policy prescriptions? No, because I’m a culture warrior and so I don’t need to actually be able to do anything about it.” But what he and what others do is successfully wrap together these real anxieties that a lot of men fee or that women feel on behalf of the men in their lives.</p>
<p>He says that’s also about the Second Amendment, and that’s also about Americanism; that’s also about religion. It gets wrapped up into this sense of being a real Christian American white man. Masculinity, Hawley says, is the tip of the spear of the Left’s attack against America.</p>

<p>I don’t think that’s even plausibly true. But I know why he’s doing that — because it’s visceral. You can attach a bunch of other things to that visceral sense of your identity as a man being under attack.</p>
<p>That doesn’t only work with Christian white men, although I’ve just mentioned them. I was very struck by a poll that found that half of American men now agree that “today, men are sometimes criticized just for acting like men” — that’s the quote in the survey — and black men are more likely to say that’s true.</p>
<p>A more positive response would be to say, we get it, here are a bunch of problems. For example, would it be a terrible idea to have an office of men’s health focused on issues around suicide and male mental health? Would it be a good idea if the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] recognized the suicide gap facing men and had some work around that?</p>
<p>Would it be a terrible idea to have a recruitment drive for male teachers? We have a massive recruitment drive for women into STEM and, most recently, women into construction. I’m here for that. But what about the fact that we have emptied out, not only education, but social work and psychology of men?</p>
<p>You have an infrastructure bill that will create jobs largely for men. Two-thirds of the jobs in the infrastructure bill will go to men: black men as much as white men, and Hispanic men a little bit more, because they’re so represented in the construction industry. Don’t hide from that fact, as the administration does when they’re challenged on it.</p>
<p>Own it. Make it a feature, not a bug. And say, “Here are all the things we’re doing on behalf of women.” There’s lots more to do for women. But the fact that this bill is the first piece of legislation for a long time that will specifically help working-class men of all races and ethnicities — I’m proud of that as a Democrat, because working-class men have had it pretty rough for the last few years.</p>
<p>Why not say that? Simple things like that, I believe, would take the wind out of the sails of the attack from the Right. The silence on these issues from the Left creates this huge political opening for the Right. And they’re seizing it.</p>

Johnson’s</a> unpopular opinion on the <a href="https://changelog.com/gotime/289">Go Time</a> podcast. <a data-play="/gotime/289/play" data-t="48:06" href="https://cdn.changelog.com/uploads/gotime/289/go-time-289.mp3" role="button" title="Play Go Time #289 starting at 48:06">Click here to listen</a> along while you read or <a href="https://youtu.be/jc2jzDzW0g4">watch the video</a> on YouTube. <a href="#unpop">Jump to the end</a> for the poll results. 📊</em></p>
<hr>
<p>My spicy take is that XML is better than YAML, because there are situations where XML is appropriate, but there’s no situation where YAML is appropriate.</p>
<p><strong>Johnny Boursiquot:</strong> <em>Dang. Shots fired! 🤣</em></p>
<h2>Let’s talk about XML first</h2>
<p>So, XML got a really bad reputation. The reason it got a really bad reputation is because people were using it for things that it should never have been used for. XML stands for <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xml/">Extensible Markup Language</a>. And if you’re using it as an <em>extensible markup language</em>, it’s actually really great.</p>
<p>Let’s say you’re working on something and you’re like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I’m making a new kind of book, and I need to annotate all of the verses in the Bible, and have the chapter headings and stuff.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s great for that.</p>
<p>It’s really good for when you have a document, and some things are italicized, and some things are in a foreign language, and subtitles, and all that stuff. It’s really good for that. It’s not good if it’s like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I need to configure this server and the server needs to know if this value is true or false.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, that’s bad. Don’t do that. That’s not a good use for XML.</p>
<p>But XML does have some uses for which it’s appropriate. And I think the fact that now everybody is writing React… and they’re writing it with JSX… and JSX is basically just inline XML… I think that shows that there are cases where actually XML is pretty good.</p>
<h2>YAML on the other hand</h2>
<p>YAML on the other hand I think is never good. There’s always something better than YAML!</p>
<p>We’ve finally made it to Go 1.21 and I’m very happy about this. And you know why? Because YAML repeatedly <em>bit me in the behind</em> on Go 1.20. Ask me why.</p>
<p><strong>Johnny Boursiquot:</strong> <em>Why?</em></p>
<p>Well, when you say in your test file:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“test this against Go 1.20”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It interprets that as Go 1.2. 😭🤣</p>
<p>So it was like two or three different times I had a repo where I’m like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“These tests aren’t passing. Why are my tests not passing?! I’ve just upgraded to Go 1.20.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And it was like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Oh, no. I’ve decided that this is Go 1.2”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And so YAML is always going to do that to you…</p>
<h3>Better choices</h3>
<p>Now, I understand why people do YAML, but there are better choices. You can use <a href="https://toml.io/en/">TOML</a>. You can use <a href="https://cuelang.org/">CUE</a>. You can use lots of things.</p>
<p>I like how <a href="https://caddyserver.com/">Caddy</a> does it. With Caddy, the canonical language that Caddy understands is JSON, but they have adapters.</p>
<p>So if you want to write YAML, you can. But it’ll just take that YAML and turn it into JSON behind the scenes.  Then they also have a specific Caddy language. So you can give it the Caddy language and then it turns that into JSON behind the scenes. And you can give it an NGINX config and it’ll turn that into JSON behind the scenes. If you have the cycles and time to spare, that’s probably the best solution for most people…</p>
<p>But when the only way to do it is YAML, it’s like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“No…!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s just too error-prone, there’s too many things… You just have to always quote everything.</p>
<h3>Also…</h3>
<p>Also the YAML specification has all these features that nobody ever uses, because they’re really confusing, and hard, and you can include documents inside of other documents, with references and stuff… And it’s like</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Oh, man, I don’t want to have to understand any of this stuff.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then if you’re not careful, it’d be like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Oh yeah, the first three things I fed it to understood that, but then the third one was just like using some parser that they found on the back of a truck, and it doesn’t understand it”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and it’s like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Oh, man…”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>YAML… never appropriate. XML is sometimes appropriate.</p>

        </p></div>
      <div><p><em>New Generative AI Technique Brings Researchers One Step Closer to Building a “Large Behavior Model”</em></p>

<p><strong>LOS ALTOS, Calif. and CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (Sept. 19, 2023)<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>– Today, Toyota Research Institute (TRI) announced a breakthrough generative AI approach based on Diffusion Policy to quickly and confidently teach robots new, dexterous skills. This advancement significantly improves robot utility and is a step towards building “Large Behavior Models (LBMs)” for robots, analogous to the Large Language Models (LLMs) that have recently revolutionized conversational AI.</p>

<p>“Our research in robotics is aimed at amplifying people rather than replacing them,” said<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.tri.global/about-us/dr-gill-pratt" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Gill Pratt</a>, CEO of TRI and Chief Scientist for Toyota Motor Corporation. “This new teaching technique is both very efficient and produces very high performing behaviors, enabling robots to much more effectively amplify people in many ways.”</p>

<p>Previous state-of-the-art techniques to teach robots new behaviors were slow, inconsistent, inefficient, and often limited to narrowly defined tasks performed in highly constrained environments. Roboticists needed to spend many hours writing sophisticated code and/or using numerous trial and error cycles to program behaviors.</p>

<p>TRI has already taught robots more than 60 difficult, dexterous skills using the new approach, including pouring liquids, using tools, and manipulating deformable objects. These achievements were realized without writing a single line of new code; the only change was supplying the robot with new data. Building on this success, TRI has set an ambitious target of teaching hundreds of new skills by the end of the year and 1,000 by the end of 2024.</p>

<p>Today’s news also highlights that robots can be taught to function in new scenarios and perform a wide range of behaviors. These skills are not limited to just “‘pick and place” or simply picking up objects and putting them down in new locations. TRI’s robots can now interact with the world in varied and rich ways — which will one day allow robots to support people in everyday situations and unpredictable, ever-changing environments.</p>

</p>




<p>“The tasks that I’m watching these robots perform are simply amazing – even one year ago, I would not have predicted that we were close to this level of diverse dexterity,” remarked<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.tri.global/about-us/dr-russ-tedrake" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Russ Tedrake</a>, Vice President of Robotics Research at TRI. Dr. Tedrake, who is also the Toyota Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Aeronautics and Astronautics, and Mechanical Engineering at MIT, explained, “What is so exciting about this new approach is the rate and reliability with which we can add new skills. Because these skills work directly from camera images and tactile sensing, using only learned representations, they are able to perform well even on tasks that involve deformable objects, cloth, and liquids — all of which have traditionally been extremely difficult for robots.”</p>

<p><strong>Technical details:</strong></p>

<p>TRI’s robot behavior model learns from haptic demonstrations from a teacher, combined with a language description of the goal. It then uses an AI-based Diffusion Policy to learn the demonstrated skill. This process allows a new behavior to be deployed autonomously from dozens of demonstrations. Not only does this approach produce consistent, repeatable, and performant results, but it does so with tremendous speed.</p>

<p>Key achievements of TRI’s research for this novel development include:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Diffusion Policy:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>TRI and our collaborators in<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://shurans.github.io/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Professor Song</a>’s group at Columbia University developed a new, powerful generative-AI approach to behavior learning. This approach, called<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04137" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Diffusion Policy</a>, enables easy and rapid behavior teaching from demonstration.</li>
	<li><strong>Customized Robot Platform:<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>TRI’s robot platform is custom-built for dexterous dual-arm manipulation tasks with a special focus on enabling haptic feedback and tactile sensing.</li>
	<li><strong>Pipeline</strong>: TRI robots have learned 60 dexterous skills already, with a target of hundreds by the end of the year and 1,000 by the end of 2024.</li>
	<li><strong>Drake:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Part of our (not so) secret sauce is<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://drake.mit.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Drake</a>, a model-based design for robotics that provides us with a cutting-edge toolbox and simulation platform. Drake’s high degree of realism allows us to develop in both simulation and in reality at a dramatically increased scale and velocity than would otherwise be possible. Our internal robot stack is built using Drake’s optimization and systems frameworks, and we have made Drake open source to catalyze work across the entire robotics community.</li>
	<li><strong>Safety:<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>Safety is core to our robotics efforts at TRI. We have designed our system with strong safeguards, powered by Drake and our custom robot control stack, to ensure our robots respect safety guarantees like not colliding with itself or its environment.</li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main"><article> <p>Rethinking 'rethinking reactivity'</p>    <!-- HTML_TAG_START --><p>In 2019, Svelte 3 turned JavaScript into a <a href="https://svelte.dev/blog/svelte-3-rethinking-reactivity">reactive language</a>. Svelte is a web UI framework that uses a compiler to turn declarative component code like this...</p>
<pre><code><span><span>&lt;</span><span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span><span>	</span><span>let</span><span> count </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>;</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>	</span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>increment</span><span>() {</span></span>
<span><span>		count </span><span>+=</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>;</span></span>
<span><span>	}</span></span>
<span><span>&lt;/</span><span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>&lt;</span><span>button</span><span> </span><span>on</span><span>:</span><span>click</span><span>=</span><span>{increment}&gt;</span></span>
<span><span>	clicks: {count}</span></span>
<span><span>&lt;/</span><span>button</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre><p>...into tightly optimized JavaScript that updates the document when state like <code>count</code> changes. Because the compiler can 'see' where <code>count</code> is referenced, the generated code is <a href="https://svelte.dev/blog/virtual-dom-is-pure-overhead">highly efficient</a>, and because we're hijacking syntax like <code>let</code> and <code>=</code> instead of using cumbersome APIs, you can <a href="https://svelte.dev/blog/write-less-code">write less code</a>.</p>
<p>A common piece of feedback we get is 'I wish I could write all my JavaScript like this'. When you're used to things inside components magically updating, going back to boring old procedural code feels like going from colour to black-and-white.</p>
<p>Svelte 5 changes all that with <em>runes</em>, which unlock <em>universal, fine-grained reactivity</em>.</p>

<figcaption>Introducing runes</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<h2 id="before-we-begin">Before we begin<a href="#before-we-begin"><span>permalink</span></a></h2><p>Even though we're changing how things work under the hood, Svelte 5 should be a drop-in replacement for almost everyone. The new features are opt-in — your existing components will continue to work.</p>
<p>We don't yet have a release date for Svelte 5. What we're showing you here is a work-in-progress that is likely to change!</p>
<h2 id="what-are-runes">What are runes?<a href="#what-are-runes"><span>permalink</span></a></h2><blockquote>
<p><strong>rune</strong> /ro͞on/ <em>noun</em></p>
<p>A letter or mark used as a mystical or magic symbol.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Runes are symbols that influence the Svelte compiler. Whereas Svelte today uses <code>let</code>, <code>=</code>, the <a href="https://learn.svelte.dev/tutorial/declaring-props"><code>export</code></a> keyword and the <a href="https://learn.svelte.dev/tutorial/reactive-declarations"><code>$:</code></a> label to mean specific things, runes use <em>function syntax</em> to achieve the same things and more.</p>
<p>For example, to declare a piece of reactive state, we can use the <code>$state</code> rune:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;script&gt;
<span>	let count = 0;
</span><span>	let count = $state(0);
</span>
	function increment() {
		count += 1;
	}
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;button on:click={increment}&gt;
	clicks: {count}
&lt;/button&gt;
</code></pre><p>At first glance, this might seem like a step back — perhaps even <a href="https://twitter.com/stolinski/status/1438173489479958536">un-Svelte-like</a>. Isn't it better if <code>let count</code> is reactive by default?</p>
<p>Well, no. The reality is that as applications grow in complexity, figuring out which values are reactive and which aren't can get tricky. And the heuristic only works for <code>let</code> declarations at the top level of a component, which can cause confusion. Having code behave one way inside <code>.svelte</code> files and another inside <code>.js</code> can make it hard to refactor code, for example if you need to turn something into a <a href="https://learn.svelte.dev/tutorial/writable-stores">store</a> so that you can use it in multiple places.</p>
<h2 id="beyond-components">Beyond components<a href="#beyond-components"><span>permalink</span></a></h2><p>With runes, reactivity extends beyond the boundaries of your <code>.svelte</code> files. Suppose we wanted to encapsulate our counter logic in a way that could be reused between components. Today, you would use a <a href="https://learn.svelte.dev/tutorial/custom-stores">custom store</a> in a <code>.js</code> or <code>.ts</code> file:</p>
<pre><p>ts</p><p><code><p><span>import</span><span> { <data-lsp lsp="(alias) function writable&amp;lt;T>(value?: T | undefined, start?: StartStopNotifier&amp;lt;T> | undefined): Writable&amp;lt;T>&amp;#10;import writable">writable</data-lsp> } </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'svelte/store'</span><span>;</span></p><p><span>export</span><span> </span><span>function</span><span> </span><span><data-lsp lsp="function createCounter(): {&amp;#10;  subscribe: (this: void, run: Subscriber&amp;lt;number>, invalidate?: Invalidator&amp;lt;number> | undefined) => Unsubscriber;&amp;#10;  increment: () => void;&amp;#10;}">createCounter</data-lsp></span><span>() {</span></p><p><span>	</span><span>const</span><span> { </span><span><data-lsp lsp="const subscribe: (this: void, run: Subscriber&amp;lt;number>, invalidate?: Invalidator&amp;lt;number> | undefined) => Unsubscriber">subscribe</data-lsp></span><span>,</span><span> </span><span><data-lsp lsp="const update: (this: void, updater: Updater&amp;lt;number>) => void">update</data-lsp></span><span> } </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span><data-lsp lsp="(alias) writable&amp;lt;number>(value?: number | undefined, start?: StartStopNotifier&amp;lt;number> | undefined): Writable&amp;lt;number>&amp;#10;import writable">writable</data-lsp></span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>);</span></p><p><span>	</span><span>return</span><span> {</span></p><p><span>		<data-lsp lsp="(property) subscribe: (this: void, run: Subscriber&amp;lt;number>, invalidate?: Invalidator&amp;lt;number> | undefined) => Unsubscriber">subscribe</data-lsp></span><span>,</span></p><p><span>		</span><span><data-lsp lsp="(property) increment: () => void">increment</data-lsp></span><span>:</span><span> () </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span><data-lsp lsp="const update: (this: void, updater: Updater&amp;lt;number>) => void">update</data-lsp></span><span>((<data-lsp lsp="(parameter) n: number">n</data-lsp>) </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> <data-lsp lsp="(parameter) n: number">n</data-lsp> </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>)</span></p><p><span>	};</span></p><p><span>}</span></p></code></p></pre><p>Because this implements the <em>store contract</em> — the returned value has a <code>subscribe</code> method — we can reference the store value by prefixing the store name with <code>$</code>:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;script&gt;
<span>	import { createCounter } from './counter.js';
</span><span>
</span><span>	const counter = createCounter();
</span><span>	let count = 0;
</span><span>
</span><span>	function increment() {
</span><span>		count += 1;
</span><span>	}
</span>&lt;/script&gt;

<span>&lt;button on:click={increment}&gt;
</span><span>	clicks: {count}
</span><span>&lt;button on:click={counter.increment}&gt;
</span><span>	clicks: {$counter}
</span>&lt;/button&gt;
</code></pre><p>This works, but it's pretty weird! We've found that the store API can get rather unwieldy when you start doing more complex things.</p>
<p>With runes, things get much simpler:</p>
<pre><code><span>import { writable } from 'svelte/store';
</span>
export function createCounter() {
<span>	const { subscribe, update } = writable(0);
</span><span>	let count = $state(0);
</span>
	return {
<span>		subscribe,
</span><span>		increment: () =&gt; update((n) =&gt; n + 1)
</span><span>		get count { return count },
</span><span>		increment: () =&gt; count += 1
</span>   };
}
</code></pre><pre><code>&lt;script&gt;
	import { createCounter } from './counter.js';

	const counter = createCounter();
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;button on:click={counter.increment}&gt;
<span>	clicks: {$counter}
</span><span>	clicks: {counter.count}
</span>&lt;/button&gt;
</code></pre><p>Note that we're using a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/get">get property</a> in the returned object, so that <code>counter.count</code> always refers to the current value rather than the value at the time the function was called.</p>
<h2 id="runtime-reactivity">Runtime reactivity<a href="#runtime-reactivity"><span>permalink</span></a></h2><p>Today, Svelte uses <em>compile-time reactivity</em>. This means that if you have some code that uses the <code>$:</code> label to re-run automatically when dependencies change, those dependencies are determined when Svelte compiles your component:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>&lt;</span><span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span><span>	</span><span>export</span><span> </span><span>let</span><span> width;</span></span>
<span><span>	</span><span>export</span><span> </span><span>let</span><span> height;</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>	</span><span>// the compiler knows it should recalculate `area`</span></span>
<span><span>	</span><span>// when either `width` or `height` change...</span></span>
<span><span>	$</span><span>:</span><span> area </span><span>=</span><span> width </span><span>*</span><span> height;</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>	</span><span>// ...and that it should log the value of `area`</span></span>
<span><span>	</span><span>// when _it_ changes</span></span>
<span><span>	$</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>console</span><span>.log</span><span>(area);</span></span>
<span><span>&lt;/</span><span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre><p>This works well... until it doesn't. Suppose we refactored the code above:</p>
<pre><p>ts</p><p><code><p><span>const</span><span> </span><span><data-lsp lsp="const multiplyByHeight: (width: any) => number">multiplyByHeight</data-lsp></span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> (<data-err><data-lsp lsp="(parameter) width: any">width</data-lsp></data-err>) </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> <data-lsp lsp="(parameter) width: any">width</data-lsp> </span><span>*</span><span> <data-err><data-lsp lsp="any">height</data-lsp></data-err>;</span></p><span><span>Parameter 'width' implicitly has an 'any' type.<br>Cannot find name 'height'.</span><span>7006<br>2304</span></span><span>Parameter 'width' implicitly has an 'any' type.<br>Cannot find name 'height'.</span><p><span>$</span><span>:</span><span> <data-err><data-lsp lsp="any">area</data-lsp></data-err> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span><data-lsp lsp="const multiplyByHeight: (width: any) => number">multiplyByHeight</data-lsp></span><span>(<data-err><data-lsp lsp="any">width</data-lsp></data-err>);</span></p><span><span>Cannot find name 'area'.<br>Cannot find name 'width'.</span><span>2304<br>2304</span></span><span>Cannot find name 'area'.<br>Cannot find name 'width'.</span></code></p></pre><p>Because the <code>$: area = ...</code> declaration can only 'see' <code>width</code>, it won't be recalculated when <code>height</code> changes. As a result, code is hard to refactor, and understanding the intricacies of when Svelte chooses to update which values can become rather tricky beyond a certain level of complexity.</p>
<p>Svelte 5 introduces the <code>$derived</code> and <code>$effect</code> runes, which instead determine the dependencies of their expressions when they are evaluated:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>&lt;</span><span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span><span>	</span><span>let</span><span> { width</span><span>,</span><span> height } </span><span>=</span><span> $</span><span>props</span><span>(); </span><span>// instead of `export let`</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>	</span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>area</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> $</span><span>derived</span><span>(width </span><span>*</span><span> height);</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>	$</span><span>effect</span><span>(() </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> {</span></span>
<span><span>		</span><span>console</span><span>.log</span><span>(area);</span></span>
<span><span>	});</span></span>
<span><span>&lt;/</span><span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre><p>As with <code>$state</code>, <code>$derived</code> and <code>$effect</code> can also be used in your <code>.js</code> and <code>.ts</code> files.</p>
<h2 id="signal-boost">Signal boost<a href="#signal-boost"><span>permalink</span></a></h2><p>Like every other framework, we've come to the realisation that <a href="https://knockoutjs.com/">Knockout</a> was right all along.</p>
<p>Svelte 5's reactivity is powered by <em>signals</em>, which are essentially <a href="https://dev.to/this-is-learning/the-evolution-of-signals-in-javascript-8ob">what Knockout was doing in 2010</a>. More recently, signals have been popularised by <a href="https://www.solidjs.com/">Solid</a> and adopted by a multitude of other frameworks.</p>
<p>We're doing things a bit differently though. In Svelte 5, signals are an under-the-hood implementation detail rather than something you interact with directly. As such, we don't have the same API design constraints, and can maximise both efficiency <em>and</em> ergonomics. For example, we avoid the type narrowing issues that arise when values are accessed by function call, and when compiling in server-side rendering mode we can ditch the signals altogether, since on the server they're nothing but overhead.</p>
<p>Signals unlock <em>fine-grained reactivity</em>, meaning that (for example) changes to a value inside a large list needn't invalidate all the <em>other</em> members of the list. As such, Svelte 5 is ridonkulously fast.</p>
<h2 id="simpler-times-ahead">Simpler times ahead<a href="#simpler-times-ahead"><span>permalink</span></a></h2><p>Runes are an additive feature, but they make a whole bunch of existing concepts obsolete:</p>
<ul>
<li>the difference between <code>let</code> at the top level of a component and everywhere else</li>
<li><code>export let</code></li>
<li><code>$:</code>, with all its attendant quirks</li>
<li>different behaviour between <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;script context="module"&gt;</code></li>
<li>the store API, parts of which are genuinely quite complicated</li>
<li>the <code>$</code> store prefix</li>
<li><code>$$props</code> and <code>$$restProps</code></li>
<li>lifecycle functions (things like <code>onMount</code> can just be <code>$effect</code> functions)</li>
</ul>
<p>For those of you who already use Svelte, it's new stuff to learn, albeit hopefully stuff that makes your Svelte apps easier to build and maintain. But newcomers won't need to learn all those things — it'll just be in a section of the docs titled 'old stuff'.</p>
<p>This is just the beginning though. We have a long list of ideas for subsequent releases that will make Svelte simpler and more capable.</p>
<h2 id="try-it">Try it!<a href="#try-it"><span>permalink</span></a></h2><p>You can't use Svelte 5 in production yet. We're in the thick of it at the moment and can't tell you when it'll be ready to use in your apps.</p>

<p dir="auto">My uBlock Origin filters to remove unnecessary distractions from some websites.</p>
<p dir="auto">For each website I have very specific tasks I do.
I optimize for allowing those tasks, while disabling everything else that might distract me.</p>
<p dir="auto">These are my preferences, feel free to use the filters directly from this repository or fork them.</p>
<p dir="auto">If I miss anything or you think I would benefit from something else, open an issue, pull request or send me an email (my github username at gmail.com).</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">YouTube</h2>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Objective:</strong> Remove all distractions, recommended videos, auto-play, suggestions (everywhere), shorts. Most of the time I only want to:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>watch a video;</li>
<li>search something;</li>
<li>upload something.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><em>Note:</em> Right now I am using Unhook (the Firefox extension). It works well but it might be possible to replace it with a filter too (<a href="https://letsblock.it/filters" rel="nofollow">https://letsblock.it/filters</a>).</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Twitter</h2>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Objective:</strong> Remove all distractions, feed, sidebar, etc. Most of the time I only want to:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>see the tweet feed in a specific profile I have opened;</li>
<li>see a tweet content and it's comments;</li>
<li>tweet something.</li>
</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">LinkedIn</h2>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p>A British freelance journalist who previously worked in the Kurdish-controlled part of Syria was held by counter-terrorism police at Luton airport for five hours without being arrested last month under controversial powers of detention.</p><p>Matt Broomfield, 29, said he was met by police as he got off a plane from Belgrade with his girlfriend on 24 August and was taken aside for questioning, where he was asked “do you consider your reporting objective” and his opinions of the British state. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/police" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Police</a> told Broomfield they were engaged in “a mopping up operation”. They seized his phone and laptop and have since refused to return them. After the questioning ended, he was allowed to proceed and no police action has followed.</p><p>Broomfield was detained under schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000, used routinely by counter-terrorism officers to question people at airports for up to six hours at a time. Police say it is a tool to keep the public safe, but critics say the power is overused to the point of harassment.</p><p>The National Union of Journalists has written on Broomfield’s behalf to Matt Jukes, the policing lead for counter-terrorism, to ask for a justification for his detainment in the absence of criminal proceedings, and for his computer and phone to be immediately returned.</p><p>Officers focused on Broomfield’s writing, much of which is sympathetic to the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/kurds" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Kurds</a>, and a three-year period ending in 2020 when he ran a news and information service in Kurdish-controlled north-east Syria. “They asked who I had met and interviewed,” he said.</p><p>Broomfield was held for two months <a href="https://dm-aegean.bordermonitoring.eu/2021/11/10/detained-and-banned-from-europe-a-british-journalist-in-the-eu-migrant-detention-system/?fbclid=IwAR1McCkjqtWtOz6qVdVy13B6xgCMgsaH8zCxJ0g2vFy56wsYfdmxS47offY" data-link-name="in body link">in Greek migrant detention centres</a> in 2021 after being denied permission to cross the border into Italy. He was told he was banned from the EU’s Schengen area at the request of Germany, which he believes was because of his media and advocacy work.</p><p>He was flown to the UK where he was subjected to a schedule 7 stop. After that, Broomfield, who is now based in Belgrade, says he was allowed to re-enter the UK “several times” without issue – until the latest stop last month.</p><p>Kurdish soldiers were instrumental in the defeat of Islamic State in north-east Syria in 2019, with air support from the US and UK, and remain in effect in control of the region. Turkey has long been hostile to the Kurds, who aspire to their own state based on territory in Turkey, Syria, Iraq and Iran.</p><p>Broomfield said: “It seems clear the Schengen ban and my harassment by the UK police are driven by direct or indirect pressure from Turkey, on the basis of my work and reporting in Rojava and around the Kurdish issue.”</p><p>He said the UK should have no interest “in the anti-democratic prosecution of legitimate journalism”.</p><p>British Kurds told the Guardian they were routinely stopped under schedule 7. Ali Gul Ozbek, 58, a pharmacist from Friern Barnet, north London, and a former mayor of Haringey council, said he had been stopped every time he went abroad since around 2012, both on the way out and on the way back.</p><p>The most recent stop was in July when Ozbek, a British citizen, went to visit his uncle in Geneva, Switzerland. “It is a form of torture. They ask the most basic questions that could be answered by a primary school student. I am an ordinary Kurd, I do not have any link with any Kurdish political organisations.”</p><p>Official figures show <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/operation-of-police-powers-under-the-terrorism-act-2000-quarterly-update-to-june-2023/operation-of-police-powers-under-the-terrorism-act-2000-and-subsequent-legislation-arrests-outcomes-and-stop-and-search-great-britain-quarterly-u" data-link-name="in body link">2,498 people were stopped</a> under schedule 7 powers in the year to 30 June, down 6% from a year before. The detainees are a wide range of people, including those with the loosest of links to the Kurdish movement.</p><figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement"><a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-13">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id="EmailSignup-skip-link-13" tabindex="0" aria-label="after newsletter promotion" role="note">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><p>Ann Marie Davies, from Cardiff, was detained by counter-terrorism police for about four hours at Bristol airport in July as she returned from a holiday in Portugal, her first since the Covid pandemic, with her husband and teenage daughter.</p><p>“I asked the police why my passport was flagged and they said they didn’t know. The questions were very broad: they asked why I was interested in human rights. But they also asked whether I supported the PKK [a Kurdish political party banned in Turkey] and I said I didn’t and I didn’t support terrorist organisations,” she said.</p><p>Davies, who trains medical students, believes she was stopped because “I sympathise with the Kurdish cause in a general sense” and because she was involved in organising a Kurdish cultural event in Cardiff last November. Police took her DNA and photograph; her phone and Kindle were searched before she was allowed to leave.</p><p>The Home Office said<strong> </strong>schedule 7 enabled officers to stop, question, detain and search a person to determine whether they are or have been involved in terrorism. “Examinations have been instrumental in securing evidence to convict,” a spokesperson said.</p><p>Iida Kayhko, a doctoral researcher in security studies at Royal Holloway, University of London, said the belief in the British Kurdish community was that UK police were reflecting pressure from Ankara after President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s election victory in May, which has reinforced Kurdish repression within Turkey.</p><p>“It would seem that British counter-terrorism policing is being made use of to pursue the Erdoğan government’s aims of stifling Kurdish political expression,” she said.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>We can 'solve' MNIST up to ~78% accuracy with the following code-golfed obscurity:</p>

     <span>for</span> x1<span>,</span> label <span>in</span> test_set<span>]</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>If you just want to see the code sample, <a href="https://github.com/Jakob-98/mono/blob/main/python/gzip_mnist/mnist_gzip.ipynb">here</a> is a link to the Jupyter Notebook containing the code to run this experiment.</p>
<p>Lets dive into why and how: yesterday while in the one-hour train ride from Eindhoven to Rotterdam, I was inspired by the post <a href="http://pepijndevos.nl/2023/07/15/chatlmza.html">text generation from data compression</a> and the (quite controversial) paper on <a href="https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-acl.426/">parameter free text classification</a> to play around with using compression as an image classification mechanism. Previously, I worked on image compression for computer vision on the edge, so interested in applying the technique to the most seminal yet basic dataset, I attempted to use GZIP + K-NN as a classification mechanism for the MNIST (handwritten digits) dataset.</p>
<p>Breaking down the technique, it boils down to two components: GZIP and NCD (Normalized Compression Distance) as a similarity metric, and k-NN (k-Nearest Neighbors) for classification. In this approach, GZIP is essentially our tool which gives us a way to measure the complexity or information content of individual data points. NCD provides a normalized measure of how similar two data points are, based on how much more (or less) effort it takes to compress them together compared to compressing them separately.</p>
<p>For each test sample, the algorithm computes its NCD with every training sample (in our case, 100 training samples), sorts them, and selects the k smallest distances. The majority class among these k=5 closest neighbors is then predicted as the label for the test sample. As this is quite computationally expensive, I only took a subset of the test images to arrive at my accuracy measure. Of course, it would be more correct to use the full set, but I leave this an an exercise to the reader ;).</p>
<p>Here is a less obscured version of the algorithm:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>compute_ncd</span><span>(</span>x1<span>,</span> x2<span>)</span><span>:</span>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When you deal with Linux, you end up hearing about "distributions" as different "flavors" of Linux combined with a bunch of other tools. This is mostly true, but it's slightly missing the forest for the trees.</p>
<p>Consider this famous and often misunderstood quote by Richard Stallman:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you're referring to as Linux is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux.Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.</p>

<p>Many pages of ink have been spilled over analyzing this quote, and a lot of them fall short of really getting at the heart of the matter. What this actually means is something like this:</p>
<p>By itself, Linux is useless. It does boot the system, it does interface with hardware, but without a bunch of other tools, it's not very useful. It's like a car without a steering wheel, or a boat without a rudder. It does something, but it's not very useful. The real value of things like the GNU project, systemd, openrc and other tools in that vein is that they make Linux useful. They make it into a complete system that you can use to do things. They are the proverbial steering wheel and rudder in the metaphor.</p>

    </p>
    <p>&lt;<a href="https://xeiaso.net/characters#mara"><b>Mara</b></a>&gt; Fun fact, if you try to boot a Linux kernel without an init process, it'll just panic and crash!</p></div>
<p>Most Linux systems on the face of the planet are built with GNU tools and utilities. In order to compile the Linux kernel, you need to use <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/">GCC</a>. In order to run <code>ls</code> to list files in the current directory, you need to use <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/coreutils.html">GNU coreutils</a>. Every dynamically linked program uses <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/">glibc</a> for performing basic system interactions like writing to files or opening network sockets. Everything is built on top of the GNU toolset. This is why Stallman is so adamant about calling it GNU/Linux. It's not that he's trying to take credit for Linux, it's that he's trying to give credit to the GNU project for making Linux useful.</p>
<p>However, there's a lot of room for nuance here. For example, <a href="https://alpinelinux.org/">Alpine Linux</a> is a Linux distribution that uses <a href="https://musl.libc.org/">musl libc</a> instead of <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/">glibc</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BusyBox">busybox</a> instead of GNU coreutils. It's still a Linux distribution, but it doesn't use the GNU toolset. It's still a Linux distribution, but it's not GNU/Linux.</p>
<div>
    <p><img src="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/sticker/mara/hacker/128" alt="Mara is hacker">
    </p>
    <p>&lt;<a href="https://xeiaso.net/characters#mara"><b>Mara</b></a>&gt; Also, for the record you can build the Linux kernel with clang, but that's a whole other can of worms. For one, GCC supports many more targets than clang likely ever will, but in general there are some compromises you need to make until clang implements some GCC-specific compiler extensions a bit better. Google, Facebook, and a few other companies do run LLVM compiled kernels in production though, so it's probably closer to viable than you think. Especially if you use ChromeOS or Android.</p></div>
<p>So, what is a Linux distribution? It's a collection of tools that make Linux useful. It's a collection of tools that make Linux into a complete system. It's not a "flavor" of Linux (though this conceptually can exist with alternative kernels like the Zen kernel patchset), it's a system that just so happens to make Linux useful.</p>
<p>As a counter-argument, consider the reason why Linux runs on more devices worldwide than there are people: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)">Android</a>. Android does use the Linux kernel, but it doesn't use any GNU tools in the stack at all. You can't take programs that are compiled against other Linux distributions and run them on Android. You can't take programs that are compiled against Android and run them on other Linux distributions.</p>
<div>
    <p><img src="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/sticker/aoi/wut/64" alt="Aoi is wut">
    </p>
    <p>&lt;<a href="https://xeiaso.net/characters#aoi"><b>Aoi</b></a>&gt; Wait, so does this mean Android's not a Linux distribution? What is it then?</p></div>
<p>I'm going to argue that Android is not a Linux distribution unto itself. Android is a Linux <em>implementation</em>. It uses the Linux kernel, but that's where the similarities with the rest of the ecosystem end. Android is its own little world where there's just enough system tools to get the system running, but once you get into the UI, it's a completely different world. It's a completely different ecosystem. It's a completely different operating system.</p>

    <p><img src="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/sticker/aoi/wut/64" alt="Aoi is wut">
    </p>
    <p>&lt;<a href="https://xeiaso.net/characters#aoi"><b>Aoi</b></a>&gt; So what's the difference between a Linux distribution and a Linux implementation?</p></div>

<div>
    <p><img src="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/sticker/cadey/enby/64" alt="Cadey is enby">
    </p>
    <p>&lt;<a href="https://xeiaso.net/characters#cadey"><b>Cadey</b></a>&gt; It's a bit of a fuzzy line, but I'd say that a Linux distribution is a collection of discrete tools that make Linux useful, and a Linux implementation is a cohesive collection of bespoke tools that make Linux into a complete system. Really, you could argue that if it has <code>/bin/sh</code>, it's a Linux distribution.</p></div>
<h2>gokrazy</h2>
<p><a href="https://gokrazy.org/">gokrazy</a> is a Linux implementation that I've used off and on for a few years now. It's a very interesting project because everything on the system is written in Go save the kernel. The init process is in Go (and even listens over HTTP to handle updates!), every userland process is written in Go, and even the core system services are written in Go.</p>
<p>Out of the box a gokrazy install comes with these basic tools:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>init</code> process that is mandated to be the parent of all userland processes by the Linux kernel.</li>
<li>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol">DHCP</a> client that automatically configures the network interface.</li>
<li>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Time_Protocol">NTP</a> client that automatically sets the system clock.</li>
<li>A little tool to save randomness from the kernel to a file so that it can be used to seed the random number generator on boot (because the Raspberry Pi doesn't have a robust hardware random number generator)</li>
</ul>
<p>That's it. Everything else from the web UI to A/B update logic is written in Go. It boots in literal seconds, uses an insanely small amount of RAM out of the box, and runs with nearly zero overhead. When you configure your gokrazy install to run additional software, you do so by adding the Go command path to a configuration file and then updating to trigger a reboot into the new version.</p>
<p>Here's an example of what my gokrazy virtual machine's file tree looks like:</p>
<pre><code><span>/ # tree etc gokrazy user
</span><span>etc
</span><span>├── breakglass.authorized_keys

</span></code></pre>
<p>That is the <em>entire</em> system. It's all stripped down to these few programs, configuration files, and one symlink for DNS resolution. This is a very minimal system, and it's all you need to run statically linked Go programs. It's very easy to deploy your own services to it too. It's probably the easiest platform I know of that lets you just deploy a Go binary and have it run as a service, automatically restarting when it crashes.</p>
<h2>The tooling</h2>
<p>When I used gokrazy back in the day, you had to use a command line called <code>gokr-packer</code> that you passed a bunch of command line flags to with information about all the Go programs you wanted to run on the machine, configuration for those programs, and any other meta-information like where the update tool should push the image to. It was a bit of a pain to use, but it worked. Recently the <a href="https://gokrazy.org/quickstart/"><code>gok</code></a> tool was added to the project, and this has been <em>revolutionary</em> when it comes to using and administrating gokrazy installs.</p>
<p>Essentially, <code>gok</code> is a wrapper around the existing <code>gokr-packer</code> logic with a JSON file to store your configuration details. It's a lot easier to use, understand, and automate. You don't have to remember command line flags or maintain unwieldy scripts. You just edit a JSON file and push updates with <code>gok update</code>. It's amazingly simple.</p>
<h2>Setting up a gokrazy machine</h2>
<p>As an example, I'm going to show you how to install a bunch of tailnet addons to a gokrazy machine. I'm also going to assume that you don't have a gokrazy install set up yet, so we'll need to install it. To do this, we'll need to do a few simple things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Install the <code>gok</code> tool.</li>
<li>Create your <code>gok</code> configuration.</li>
<li>Install Tailscale on the machine.</li>
<li>Create your "seed" image with <code>gok overwrite</code>.</li>
<li>Boot it on your Raspberry Pi or VM.</li>
<li>Push any updates to the image to the machine with <code>gok update</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>First, let's install the <code>gok</code> tool. In order to do this, you need to have the <a href="https://golang.org/doc/install">Go toolchain</a> installed. Once you have that, you can run <code>go install</code> to install the <code>gok</code> tool:</p>
<pre><code><span>go install github.com/gokrazy/tools/cmd/gok@main
</span></code></pre>
<div>
    <p><img src="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/sticker/mara/hacker/128" alt="Mara is hacker">
    </p>
    <p>&lt;<a href="https://xeiaso.net/characters#mara"><b>Mara</b></a>&gt; You may want to ensure that <code>~/go/bin</code> is in your <code>$PATH</code> variable so that you can run it by the name <code>gok</code> instead of <code>~/go/bin/gok</code>.</p></div>
<p>Next, create a new gokrazy configuration with <code>gok new</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>gok new -i casa
</span></code></pre>
<p>This will create a configuration named <code>casa</code> (cf: Spanish for "house") in <code>~/gokrazy/casa</code>. This is where all of your configuration files will live. You can edit the configuration file with <code>gok edit</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>gok edit -i casa
</span></code></pre>
<details>
<summary>If you are making a virtual machine</summary>
<p>If you are making a virtual machine, you will need to override the kernel and firmware packages. You can do this by adding the following to your configuration file:</p>
<pre><code><span>{
</span><span>  </span><span>// ...
</span><span>  "</span><span>KernelPackage</span><span>": "</span><span>github.com/rtr7/kernel</span><span>",
</span><span>  "</span><span>FirmwarePackage</span><span>": "</span><span>github.com/rtr7/kernel</span><span>",
</span><span>  </span><span>// ...
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<p>You will need to prefix the <code>gok overwrite</code> and <code>gok update</code> commands with <code>GOARCH=amd64</code> to ensure that Go builds x86_64 binaries instead of ARM binaries:</p>
<pre><code><span>GOARCH=amd64 gok update -i casa
</span></code></pre>
<p>If you don't do this, you will get arm64 binaries being built. This may require manual recovery of your virtual machine.</p>
</details>
<p>Let's make our lives easier by installing <a href="https://tailscale.com/">Tailscale</a> on the machine. By default, gokrazy will announce its hostname over DHCP, which usually makes most consumer routers pick it up and then lets you ping it by name. When you have <a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1081/magicdns/">MagicDNS</a> enabled, Tailscale can take over this logic and prevent you from accessing the machine by name.</p>
<p>However, Tailscale is written in Go and doesn't require any of the services that most Linux distributions provide in order to function. It's a perfect fit for gokrazy. You can install it with <code>gok add</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>gok add tailscale.com/cmd/tailscaled
</span><span>gok add tailscale.com/cmd/tailscale
</span></code></pre>
<p>And be sure to add the <code>mkfs</code> service to create a persistent partition on <code>/perm</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>gok add github.com/gokrazy/mkfs
</span></code></pre>
<p>Next, fetch an <a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1085/auth-keys/">auth key</a> from <a href="https://login.tailscale.com/admin/settings/keys">the admin console</a> and make sure you check that it's reusable. Then, add the following to your configuration file under the <code>PackageConfig</code> block:</p>
<pre><code><span>{
</span><span>    </span><span>// ...
</span><span>    "</span><span>PackageConfig</span><span>": {
</span><span>        </span><span>// ...
</span><span>        "</span><span>tailscale.com/cmd/tailscale</span><span>": {
</span><span>            "</span><span>CommandLineFlags</span><span>": [
</span><span>                "</span><span>up</span><span>",
</span><span>                 </span><span>// paste your key here!
</span><span>                "</span><span>--authkey=tskey-auth-hunter2-hunter2hunter2hunter2</span><span>"
</span><span>            ]
</span><span>        },
</span><span>        </span><span>// ...
</span><span>    }
</span><span>    </span><span>// ...
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>

<p>This will make your machine automatically connect to Tailscale on boot.</p>
<p>Next, we need to create our "seed" image with <code>gok overwrite</code>. First, figure out what the device node for your SD card is. On Linux, you can do this with <code>lsblk</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>lsblk
</span></code></pre>
<p>And then look for the one that has the same size as your SD card. In my case, it's <code>/dev/sdd</code>. Once you have that, you can run <code>gok overwrite</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>gok overwrite --full /dev/sdd
</span></code></pre>
<p>However if you want to write the image to a file (such as if you are doing mass distribution or making a VM image), you need to use <code>gok overwrite</code> with a file instead of a device node. This will create a 16 GB image:</p>
<pre><code><span>gok overwrite -i casa --full gokrazy.img --target_storage_bytes 17179869184
</span></code></pre>
<p>Once you have your image, you can write it to your SD card with <code>dd</code> (or <a href="https://etcher.balena.io/">balenaEtcher</a>) or import it into your virtual machine hypervisor of choice.</p>
<p>Once you have your image written to your SD card, you can boot it on your Raspberry Pi or VM.</p>
<div>
    <p><img src="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/sticker/aoi/wut/64" alt="Aoi is wut">
    </p>
    <p>&lt;<a href="https://xeiaso.net/characters#aoi"><b>Aoi</b></a>&gt; Wait, so how do I log in with a shell?</p></div>

<div>
    <p><img src="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/sticker/cadey/enby/64" alt="Cadey is enby">
    </p>
    <p>&lt;<a href="https://xeiaso.net/characters#cadey"><b>Cadey</b></a>&gt; You don't. gokrazy doesn't have a login prompt. It's a single-user system. There is <a href="https://github.com/gokrazy/breakglass"><code>breakglass</code></a> as a tool of last resort to modify things, but you only have a very minimal subset of busybox to work with, so it should be avoided if at all possible.</p></div>
<p>Once you have your machine booted and it responds to pings over Tailscale, you can open its HTTP interface in your browser. If you called your machine <code>casa</code>, you can open it at <a href="http://casa/"><code>http://casa</code></a>. It will prompt you for a username and password. Your username is <code>gokrazy</code>, and the password is near the top of your <code>config.json</code> file. When you log in, you'll see a screen like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/file/christine-static/blog/2023/gokrazy/gokrazy-ui.jpg" target="_blank"><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/file/christine-static/blog/2023/gokrazy/gokrazy-ui.avif"><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/file/christine-static/blog/2023/gokrazy/gokrazy-ui.webp"><img loading="lazy" alt="hero image blog/2023/gokrazy/gokrazy-ui" src="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/file/christine-static/blog/2023/gokrazy/gokrazy-ui-smol.png"></picture></a></p>
<p>This is the gokrazy web UI. It lets you see the status of your machine and any logs that are being generated by your applications. You can also start, stop, and restart any of your applications from here. It's a very simple UI, but it's fantastic for debugging and monitoring.</p>
<h2>Tailnet addons</h2>
<p>Now that we have a Gokrazy system up and running, let's add some programs to it! I'm going to list a couple tailnet addons that give your tailnet superpowers. These are all written in Go, so they're a perfect fit for gokrazy.</p>
<p>Today I'm going to show you how to install these tools into your tailnet:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/tailscale/golink">golink</a> - a URL shortener at <code>http://go</code></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/tailscale/tmemes">tmemes</a> - an internal meme generator you can host at <code>http://memegen</code></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/tailscale-dev/tclip">tclip</a> - a pastebin you can host at <code>http://paste</code></li>
</ul>
<p>These tools help you augment your tailnet by giving you tools that will make you and your team's life a lot easier. A URL shortener helps you link to complicated Google Docs URLs. A meme generator gives you a new innovative way to let off steam. A pastebin lets you share text with your team without having to worry about the service you're using going offline due to no fault of your own.</p>
<h3>golink</h3>
<p>To install golink, we need to add the <code>golink</code> binary to the configuration. You can do this with <code>gok add</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>gok add github.com/tailscale/golink/cmd/golink
</span></code></pre>
<p>Then configure it with <code>gok edit</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>{
</span><span>    </span><span>// ...
</span><span>    "</span><span>PackageConfig</span><span>": {
</span><span>        </span><span>// ...
</span><span>        "</span><span>github.com/tailscale/golink/cmd/golink</span><span>": {
</span><span>            "</span><span>CommandLineFlags</span><span>": [
</span><span>                "</span><span>--sqlitedb=/perm/home/golink/data.db</span><span>"
</span><span>            ],
</span><span>            "</span><span>Environment</span><span>": [
</span><span>                </span><span>// the same one from before
</span><span>                "</span><span>TS_AUTHKEY=tskey-auth-hunter2-hunter2hunter2hunter2</span><span>"
</span><span>            ],
</span><span>            </span><span>// don't start the service until NTP catches up
</span><span>            "</span><span>WaitForClock</span><span>": </span><span>true
</span><span>        },
</span><span>        </span><span>// ...
</span><span>    }
</span><span>    </span><span>// ...
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<p>And finally push it with <code>gok update</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>gok update -i casa
</span></code></pre>
<p>It'll build the image, push it out over Tailscale, trigger a reboot, and be back up in the span of a minute. Once it's back up, you can open the web UI again and see the status of your <code>golink</code> instance at <a href="http://casa/status?path=%2fuser%2fgolink">http://casa/status?path=%2fuser%2fgolink</a>:</p>
<p><a href="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/file/christine-static/blog/2023/gokrazy/golink.jpg" target="_blank"><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/file/christine-static/blog/2023/gokrazy/golink.avif"><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/file/christine-static/blog/2023/gokrazy/golink.webp"><img loading="lazy" alt="hero image blog/2023/gokrazy/golink" src="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/file/christine-static/blog/2023/gokrazy/golink-smol.png"></picture></a></p>
<p>And then you can start using short URLs at <a href="http://go/">http://go</a>:</p>
<p><a href="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/file/christine-static/blog/2023/gokrazy/golink-ui.jpg" target="_blank"><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/file/christine-static/blog/2023/gokrazy/golink-ui.avif"><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/file/christine-static/blog/2023/gokrazy/golink-ui.webp"><img loading="lazy" alt="hero image blog/2023/gokrazy/golink-ui" src="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/file/christine-static/blog/2023/gokrazy/golink-ui-smol.png"></picture></a></p>
<p>And that's it! You now have a super minimal VM running small programs that let you do useful things to you. You can add more programs to your configuration file and push them with <code>gok update</code> to add more functionality to your machine. You can even add your own programs to the configuration file and push them to your machine. It's a very simple system, but it's very powerful.</p>
<h3>tmemes</h3>
<p>Google is infamous for having an internal service named <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/reyhan/inside-googles-internal-meme-generator">memegen</a>. This allows Googlers to make internal-facing memes about the slings and arrows that impact them as highly paid programmers. This is an internal service inside Google that has a lot of serious investment of time and energy to make it the best possible experience it can be. It's to the point that reportedly people can keep up with how an all-hands meeting is going by the tone of the sarcastic memes that are being posted to memegen.</p>
<p>The main reason this is run inside Google is to avoid information leaking via memes. Yes, this is an actual threat model.</p>
<p>Thanks to the magic of Tailscale, you can make your own private memegen using <a href="https://github.com/tailscale/tmemes">tmemes</a>. tmemes is a tailnet addon that lets you post image macro templates and layer wisdom over it in the form of text.</p>
<p>Here's an example meme:</p>
<p><a href="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/file/christine-static/blog/2023/gokrazy/society-if-gokrazy.jpg" target="_blank"><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/file/christine-static/blog/2023/gokrazy/society-if-gokrazy.avif"><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/file/christine-static/blog/2023/gokrazy/society-if-gokrazy.webp"><img loading="lazy" alt="hero image blog/2023/gokrazy/society-if-gokrazy" src="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/file/christine-static/blog/2023/gokrazy/society-if-gokrazy-smol.png"></picture></a></p>
<p>To add tmemes to your gokrazy machine, you can use <code>gok add</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>gok add github.com/tailscale/tmemes/tmemes
</span></code></pre>
<p>Then open your config with <code>gok edit</code> and add the following to your <code>PackageConfig</code> block:</p>
<pre><code><span>{
</span><span>    </span><span>// ...
</span><span>    "</span><span>PackageConfig</span><span>": {
</span><span>        </span><span>// ...
</span><span>        "</span><span>github.com/tailscale/tmemes/tmemes</span><span>": {
</span><span>            "</span><span>Environment</span><span>": [
</span><span>                "</span><span>TS_AUTHKEY=tskey-auth-hunter2-hunter2hunter2hunter2</span><span>"
</span><span>            ],
</span><span>            "</span><span>CommandLineFlags</span><span>": [
</span><span>                </span><span>// change this to your desired hostname

</span><span>    </span><span>// ...
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<p>And then push it with <code>gok update</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>gok update -i casa
</span></code></pre>
<p>Then you can head to <a href="http://memegen/">http://memegen</a> and upload a template to make your own dank memes.</p>
<p>If you want to integrate your own tools with tmemes, you can check out the <a href="https://github.com/tailscale/tmemes/blob/main/docs/api.md">API documentation</a>. This should help you do whatever it is you want with a meme generator as a service.</p>
<h3>tclip</h3>
<p>Sometimes you just need a place to paste text and get a URL pointing to it. <a href="https://tailscale.dev/blog/tclip">tclip</a> is a tool that you can add to your tailnet and get exactly that. It's a very simple tool, but it's very useful. It's also written in Go, so it's a perfect fit for gokrazy. <a href="https://tailscale.dev/blog/tclip-updates-092023">Their recent update to remove Cgo dependencies</a> makes it possible to run your tclip node on a gokrazy machine.</p>
<p>To add tclip to your gokrazy machine, you can use <code>gok add</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>gok add github.com/tailscale-dev/tclip/cmd/tclipd
</span></code></pre>
<p>Then open your config with <code>gok edit</code> and add the following to your <code>PackageConfig</code> block:</p>
<pre><code><span>{
</span><span>    </span><span>// ...
</span><span>    "</span><span>PackageConfig</span><span>": {
</span><span>        </span><span>// ...
</span><span>        "</span><span>github.com/tailscale-dev/tclip/cmd/tclipd</span><span>": {
</span><span>            "</span><span>CommandLineFlags</span><span>": [
</span><span>                "</span><span>--data-location=/perm/home/tclip/</span><span>"
</span><span>            ],
</span><span>            "</span><span>WaitForClock</span><span>": </span><span>true</span><span>,
</span><span>            "</span><span>Environment</span><span>": [
</span><span>                "</span><span>TS_AUTHKEY=tskey-auth-hunter2-hunter2hunter2hunter2</span><span>",
</span><span>                "</span><span>USE_FUNNEL=true</span><span>" </span><span>// Remove this if you don't want to use Funnel
</span><span>            ]
</span><span>        },
</span><span>        </span><span>// ...
</span><span>    }
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<p>And then push it with <code>gok update</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>gok update -i casa
</span></code></pre>
<p>And then you can start using it by heading to <a href="http://paste/">http://paste</a>. Install the command-line tool on your development workstation with <code>go install</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>go install github.com/tailscale-dev/tclip/cmd/tclip@latest
</span></code></pre>
<p>Here's an example tclip link if you want to see what it looks like in practice: <a href="https://paste.shark-harmonic.ts.net/paste/696b9b02-90ac-4adc-a33d-d749bb6f460f">interjection.c</a>. It's a very simple tool, but it's very useful.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>gokrazy is insanely cool. It's the <em>easiest</em> way to deploy Go services to your homelab. It integrates seamlessly with Tailscale, and is something that I'm very excited to see grow and mature. I'm very excited to see what the future holds for gokrazy, and I'm very excited to see what people do with it.</p>
<p>I've seen signs that they're going to be adding an automatic update process, and that has me <em>very</em> excited. I'm also excited to see what other services people add to the gokrazy ecosystem. I'm hoping to add a few of my own in the future, and I'm hoping to see what other people do with it.</p>

<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Manual testing</h3>
<p dir="auto">You can test any SeaGOAT command manually in your local development
environment. For example to test the development version of the
<code>seagoat-server</code> command, you can run:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="poetry run seagoat-server ~/path/an/example/repository"><pre>poetry run seagoat-server <span>~</span>/path/an/example/repository</pre></div>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">FAQ</h2>
<p dir="auto">The points in this FAQ are indications of how SeaGOAT works, but are not
a legal contract. SeaGOAT is licensed under an open source license and if you
are in doubt about the privacy/safety/etc implications of SeaGOAT, you are
welcome to examine the source code,
<a href="https://github.com/kantord/SeaGOAT/issues/new">raise your concerns</a>,
or create a pull request to fix a problem.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How does SeaGOAT work? Does it send my data to ChatGPT?</h3>
<p dir="auto">SeaGOAT does not rely on 3rd party APIs or any remote APIs and executes all
functionality locally using the SeaGOAT server that you are able to run on
your own machine.</p>
<p dir="auto">Instead of relying on APIs or "connecting to ChatGPT", it uses the vector
database called ChromaDB, with a local vector embedding engine and
telemetry disabled by default.</p>
<p dir="auto">Apart from that, SeaGOAT also uses ripgrep, a regular-expression based code
search engine in order to provider regular expression/keyword based matches
in addition to the "AI-based" matches.</p>
<p dir="auto">While the current version of SeaGOAT does not send your data to remote
servers, it might be possible that in the future there will be <strong>optional</strong>
features that do so, if any further improvement can be gained from that.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Why does SeaGOAT need a server?</h3>
<p dir="auto">SeaGOAT needs a server in order to provide a speedy response. SeaGOAT heavily
relies on vector embeddings and vector databases, which at the moment cannot
be replace with an architecture that processes files on the fly.</p>
<p dir="auto">It's worth noting that <em>you are able to run SeaGOAT server entirely locally</em>,
and it works even if you don't have an internet connection. This use case
does not require you to share data with a remote server, you are able to use
your own SeaGOAT server locally, albeit it's also possible to run a SeaGOAT
server and allow other computers to connect to it, if you so wish.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Does SeaGOAT create AI-derived work? Is SeaGOAT ethical?</h3>
<p dir="auto">If you are concerned about the ethical implications of using AI tools keep in
mind that SeaGOAT is not a code generator but a code search engine, therefore
it does not create AI derived work.</p>
<p dir="auto">That being said, a language model <em>is</em> being used to generate vector
embeddings. At the moment SeaGOAT uses ChromaDB's default model for
calculating vector embeddings, and I am not aware of this being an ethical
concern.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">What programming langauges are supported?</h3>
<p dir="auto">Currently SeaGOAT is hardcoded to only process files in the following
formats:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Text Files</strong> (<code>*.txt</code>)</li>
<li><strong>Markdown</strong> (<code>*.md</code>)</li>
<li><strong>Python</strong> (<code>*.py</code>)</li>
<li><strong>C</strong> (<code>*.c</code>, <code>*.h</code>)</li>
<li><strong>C++</strong> (<code>*.cpp</code>, <code>*.cc</code>, <code>*.cxx</code>, <code>*.hpp</code>)</li>
<li><strong>TypeScript</strong> (<code>*.ts</code>, <code>*.tsx</code>)</li>
<li><strong>JavaScript</strong> (<code>*.js</code>, <code>*.jsx</code>)</li>
<li><strong>HTML</strong> (<code>*.html</code>)</li>
<li><strong>Go</strong> (<code>*.go</code>)</li>
<li><strong>Java</strong> (<code>*.java</code>)</li>
<li><strong>PHP</strong> (<code>*.php</code>)</li>
<li><strong>Ruby</strong> (<code>*.rb</code>)</li>
</ul>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>Today we announce that we have completely removed all traces of disks being used by our VPN infrastructure!</p>

<p>In early 2022 we announced the<a href="https://mullvad.net/blog/2022/1/12/diskless-infrastructure-beta-system-transparency-stboot/"> beginning of our migration</a> to using diskless infrastructure with our bootloader known as “stboot”.</p>

<h2>Completing the transition to diskless infrastructure</h2>

<p>Our VPN infrastructure has since been audited with this configuration twice (<a href="https://mullvad.net/blog/2023/8/9/infrastructure-audit-completed-by-radically-open-security/">2023</a>, <a href="https://mullvad.net/blog/2022/6/22/vpn-server-audit-found-no-information-leakage-or-logging-of-customer-data/">2022</a>), and all future audits of our VPN servers will focus solely on RAM-only deployments.</p>

<p>All of our VPN servers continue to use our custom and extensively slimmed down Linux kernel, where we follow the mainline branch of kernel development. This has allowed us to pull in the latest version so that we can stay up to date with new features and performance improvements, as well as tune and completely remove unnecessary bloat in the kernel.</p>

<p>The result is that the operating system that we boot, prior to being deployed weighs in at just over 200MB. When servers are rebooted or provisioned for the first time, we can be safe in the knowledge that we get a freshly built kernel, no traces of any log files, and a fully patched OS.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><h3>New report suggests massive increase in production and operating costs over past three years has left around 60 per cent of supply unprofitable</h3></p><div><p>Three-fifths of the fresh fruit and vegetables traded commercially around the globe are now sold at a loss or breakeven price, following an unprecedented increase in production and operating costs during the pandemic.</p>
<p>What’s more, those cost increases appear to have greatly reduced the amount of investment going into new projects, which means the effects of that inflation are likely to be felt for some time.</p>
<p>Those are two of the key findings published in a new report by the Global Coalition of Fresh Produce (GCFP), an international thinktank which brings together industry associations including Freshfel Europe, IFPA, CPMA, and Shaffe.</p>
<p>The report, which is based on the results of a survey conducted in early 2023, looked at the increasing cost of fruits and vegetable production around the world, as well as its impacts on the industry and consumers.</p>
<p>“We conducted this global survey to shed light on the challenges experienced by actors in the fresh produce supply chain worldwide,” says GCFP chair Ron Lemaire. “The narrative highlighted in this report will help the industry, its partners and all government levels understand the current impacts of the increase in production and operating costs, and work together to address them.”</p>
<p><strong>Stark conclusions</strong></p>
<p>The report states that producers of fresh fruits and vegetables around the world experienced “unprecedented increases” in production and operating costs during the Covid-19 pandemic, regardless of where in the world they operated. Those increases, the report says, were driven by costs of fertiliser (up 60 per cent worldwide), construction (+48 per cent), fuel and gas (+41 per cent), shipping rates (+40 per cent), and electricity (+40 percent).</p>
<p>Most operators were able to increase their selling prices, the report finds, with rises of 11 per cent in Europe, 13 per cent in Oceania and South America, 14 per cent in North America and 23 per cent in Africa.</p>
<p>However, these increases were “not enough” to compensate for the rise in production and operating costs, the coalition discovered, leaving nearly three-fifths of the global industry “selling at a loss or breaking even”.</p>
<p>Higher costs have also affected strategic and operational choices, it notes: “Certain producers have reduced their output, while some traders have reduced their export activities or switched to produce with lower shipping costs.”</p>
<p>Eighty percent of respondents noted that they had chosen to delay or cancel investment in their businesses, not only in capital and equipment but also in innovation and expansion. “This means that the impacts of the rise in costs will be felt for years to come,” the authors comment.</p>
<p><a href="https://producecoalition.net/publications/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The final report is available on the Global Coalition of Fresh Produce website</a>.</p>
<p>The Global Coalition of Fresh Produce brings together fresh produce associations from around the world, based on their joint vision to “create resilient global value chains for fruits and vegetables that bring a myriad of economic, environmental and societal benefits”.</p>
<p>Current members are Afruibana, AEBE, Australian Fresh Produce Alliance, AusVeg, CPMA, Colead, Freshfel Europe, FVGC, IFPA, Shaffe, and United Fresh New Zealand.</p></div></div>]]></description>
