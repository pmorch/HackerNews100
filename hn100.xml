<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="postContent"><div><h2 dir="auto">E: apparently it needs to be said that I am not suggesting you switch to Linux on your phone today; just that development needs to accelerate. Please don’t be one of the 34 people that replied to tell me Linux is not ready.</h2>
<p dir="auto">Android has always been a <em>fairly</em> open platform, especially if you were <em>deliberate</em> about getting it that way, but we’ve seen in recent months an <strong>extremely rapid</strong> devolution of the Android ecosystem:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li><a href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/26/google-android-aosp-developement-private/" rel="noopener nofollow">The closing of development of an increasing number of components in AOSP.</a></li>
<li><a href="https://trendslife.in/samsung-one-ui-removed-bootloader-unlock/" rel="noopener nofollow">Samsung</a>, <a href="https://droidwin.com/xiaomi-might-no-longer-allow-bootloader-unlocking-on-miui/" rel="noopener nofollow">Xiaomi</a> and <a href="https://droidwin.com/now-oneplus-restricts-bootloader-unlocking/" rel="noopener nofollow">OnePlus</a> have removed the option of bootloader unlocking on all of their devices. I suspect Google is not far behind.</li>
<li>Google implementing Play Integrity API and encouraging developers to implement it. Notably the EU’s own identity verification wallet requires this, in stark contrast to their own laws and policies, despite the protest of hundreds on Github.</li>
<li>And finally, the mandatory implementation of developer verification across Android systems. Yes, if you’re running a 3rd-party OS like GOS you won’t be directly affected by this, but it will impact 99.9% of devices, and I foresee many open source developers just opting out of developing apps for Android entirely as a result. <a href="https://forum.syncthing.net/t/discontinuing-syncthing-android/23002" rel="noopener nofollow">We’ve already seen SyncThing simply discontinue development</a> for this reason, citing issues with Google Play Store. They’ve also repeatedly denied updates for NextCloud with no explanation, only restoring it after mass outcry. And we’ve already seen Google targeting any software intended to circumvent ads, labeling them in the system as “dangerous” and “untrusted”. This will most certainly carry into their new “verification” system.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">Google once competed with Apple for customers. But in a world where Google walks away from the biggest antitrust trial since 1998 with yet another slap on the wrist, competition is dead, and Google is taking notes from Apple about what they can legally get away with.</p>
<p dir="auto">Android as we know it is dead. And/or will be dead very soon. We need an open replacement.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page">



<p>
The author <a href="http://www.raybradbury.com/">Ray Bradbury</a> is
one of the early science fiction authors that moved science fiction
into a literary form.  As a writer Bradbury constructs beautifully
written stories and novels.  Bradbury's writing is in stark contrast
to Bradbury as a speaker.  The first time I heard Ray Bradbury speak
was at the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) yearly conference
in Los Angeles in the 1980s.  Hearing Bradbury speak is an almost
painful experience.  The pictures that Bradbury can paint with the
written word seem to be entirely missing when Bradbury speaks.  He is
halting, awkward and does not seem to know where he wants to go
in his talk.
</p>

<p>
In contrast to Bradbury, listenting to William Gibson has the feel of
his written work.  The same complex world view and sentence structure
is there, although not as finely edited.  An example of this can be
found in the documentary made about William Gibson, <a href="http://www.nomaps.com/"><i>No Maps for these Territories</i></a>.
This documentary includes extensive interviews with William Gibson.
<i>No Maps</i> also provides a glimpse of the way Gibson looks at the
interconnections and relationships in the world around us.  This view
of Gibson's mind shows us his genius.
</p>

<p>
The mirror between William Gibson's spoken voice and his written voice
gives special force to his readings of his work.  Early in his career
Gibson did an abridged reading of <i>Neuromancer</i>, his first novel
and the work that made him famous.  It was in this novel that Gibson
coined the term <i>cyberspace</i>.  This reading was only published on
audio-tape and is now out of print.
</p>

<p>
I hate the idea that Gibson's wonderful reading of <i>Neuromancer</i>
should be lost or inaccessable.  I was only able to hear it because
the Mountain View (California) Library had a copy.  Fortunately I've
been able to find an MP3 copy of these audio tapes.  They can be
downloaded below.
</p>

<p>
I am only providing these MP3s because the original has been out of
print for years.  As a software engineer I believe that I should be
paid for my work.  If I hold this view then it is only reasonable that
I should also believe that artist should be paid for their work.  All
of the software and music I own I have paid for (or is open source).
I would prefer that the publisher re-issue the audio-tape of William
Gibson's reading in a more modern format (perhaps CD) and that William
Gibson collect royalties on this work.  Gibson's reading has been out
of print so long that I can only assume that this is unlikely to
happen.
</p>

<p>
If you're a fan of William Gibson I hope that others will mirror these
files as well so that they will never be lost.
</p>
<p>
This reading was published on four magnetic tape audio cassetts.
These have been re-recorded in MP3 format:

Neuromancer is one of the few books that I've read many times.  All of
Gibson's books are good (well, except for <i>The Difference
Engine</i>, but that's Bruce Sterling's fault).  <i>Neuromancer</i> is
still in print, so you should go out an buy a copy if you want to read
it.  Writers pay their bills from the royalties from book sales.  I've

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 id="preface">Preface<a href="#preface" arialabel="Anchor">#</a></h2><p>This article is <em>NOT</em> served from a web server running on a disposable vape. If you want to see the real deal, click <a href="http://ewaste.fka.wtf/">here</a>. The content is otherwise identical.</p><h2 id="background">Background<a href="#background" arialabel="Anchor">#</a></h2><p>For a couple of years now, I have been collecting disposable vapes from friends and family. Initially, I only salvaged the batteries for “future” projects (It’s not hoarding, I promise), but recently, disposable vapes have gotten more advanced. I wouldn’t want to be the lawyer who one day will have to argue how a device with USB C and a rechargeable battery can be classified as “disposable”. Thankfully, I don’t plan on pursuing law anytime soon.</p><p>Last year, I was tearing apart some of these fancier pacifiers for adults when I noticed something that caught my eye, instead of the expected black blob of goo hiding some ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuit) I see a little integrated circuit inscribed “PUYA”.
I don’t blame you if this name doesn’t excite you as much it does me, most people have never heard of them. They are most well known for their flash chips, but I first came across them after reading Jay Carlson’s blog post about <a href="https://jaycarlson.net/2023/02/04/the-cheapest-flash-microcontroller-you-can-buy-is-actually-an-arm-cortex-m0/">the cheapest flash microcontroller you can buy</a>. They are quite capable little ARM Cortex-M0+ micros.</p><p>Over the past year I have collected quite a few of these PY32 based vapes, all of them from different models of vape from the same manufacturer. It’s not my place to do free advertising for big tobacco, so I won’t mention the brand I got it from, but if anyone who worked on designing them reads this, thanks for labeling the debug pins!</p><h2 id="what-are-we-working-with">What are we working with<a href="#what-are-we-working-with" arialabel="Anchor">#</a></h2><p>The chip is marked <code>PUYA C642F15</code>, which wasn’t very helpful. I was pretty sure it was a <code>PY32F002A</code>, but after poking around with <a href="http://pyocd.io/">pyOCD</a>, I noticed that the flash was 24k and we have 3k of RAM. The extra flash meant that it was more likely a <code>PY32F002B</code>, which is actually a very different chip.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p><p>So here are the specs of a microcontroller so <em>bad</em>, it’s basically disposable:</p><ul><li>24MHz Coretex M0+</li><li>24KiB of Flash Storage</li><li>3KiB of Static RAM</li><li>a few peripherals, none of which we will use.</li></ul><p>You may look at those specs and think that it’s not much to work with. I don’t blame you, a 10y old phone can barely load google, and this is about 100x slower. I on the other hand see a <em>blazingly</em> fast web server.</p><h2 id="getting-online">Getting online<a href="#getting-online" arialabel="Anchor">#</a></h2><p>The idea of hosting a web server on a vape didn’t come to me instantly. In fact, I have been playing around with them for a while, but after writing my post on <a href="https://bogdanthegeek.github.io/blog/insights/jlink-rtt-for-the-masses/">semihosting</a>, the penny dropped.</p><p>If you don’t feel like reading that article, semihosting is basically syscalls for embedded ARM microcontrollers. You throw some values/pointers into some registers and call a breakpoint instruction. An attached debugger interprets the values in the registers and performs certain actions. Most people just use this to get some logs printed from the microcontroller, but they are actually bi-directional.</p><p>If you are older than me, you might remember a time before Wi-Fi and Ethernet, the dark ages, when you had to use dial-up modems to get online. You might also know that the ghosts of those modems still linger all around us. Almost all USB serial devices actually emulate those modems: a 56k modem is just 57600 baud serial device. Data between some of these modems was transmitted using a protocol called SLIP (Serial Line Internet Protocol).<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p><p>This may not come as a surprise, but Linux (and with some tweaking even macOS) supports SLIP. The <code>slattach</code> utility can make any <code>/dev/tty*</code> send and receive IP packets. All we have to do is put the data down the wire in the right format and provide a virtual tty.
This is actually easier than you might imagine, pyOCD can forward all semihosting though a telnet port. Then, we use <code>socat</code> to link that port to a virtual tty:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sh"><span><span>pyocd gdb -S -O semihost_console_type<span>=</span>telnet -T <span>$(</span>PORT<span>)</span> <span>$(</span>PYOCDFLAGS<span>)</span> &amp;
</span></span><span><span>socat PTY,link<span>=</span><span>$(</span>TTY<span>)</span>,raw,echo<span>=</span><span>0</span> TCP:localhost:<span>$(</span>PORT<span>)</span>,nodelay &amp;
</span></span><span><span>sudo slattach -L -p slip -s <span>115200</span> <span>$(</span>TTY<span>)</span> &amp;
</span></span><span><span>sudo ip addr add 192.168.190.1 peer 192.168.190.2/24 dev sl0
</span></span><span><span>sudo ip link set mtu <span>1500</span> up dev sl0
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Ok, so we have a “modem”, but that’s hardly a web server. To actually talk TCP/IP, we need an IP stack. There are many choices, but I went with <a href="https://github.com/adamdunkels/uip/tree/uip-0-9">uIP</a> because it’s pretty small, doesn’t require an RTOS, and it’s easy to port to other platforms.
It also, helpfully, comes with a very minimal HTTP server example.</p><p>After porting the SLIP code to use semihosting, I had a working web server…half of the time.
As with most highly optimised libraries, uIP was designed for 8 and 16-bit machines, which rarely have memory alignment requirements. On ARM however, if you dereference a <code>u16 *</code>, you better hope that address is even, or you’ll get an exception. The <code>uip_chksum</code> assumed <code>u16</code> alignment, but the script that creates the filesystem didn’t.
I actually decided to modify a bit the structure of the filesystem to make it a bit more portable.
This was my first time working with <code>perl</code> and I have to say, it’s quite well suited to this kind of task.</p><h2 id="blazingly-fast">Blazingly fast<a href="#blazingly-fast" arialabel="Anchor">#</a></h2><p>So how fast is a web server running on a disposable microcontroller. Well, initially, not very fast. Pings took ~1.5s with 50% packet loss and a simple page took over 20s to load. That’s so bad, it’s actually funny, and I kind of wanted to leave it there.</p><p>However, the problem was actually between the seat and the steering wheel the whole time. The first implementation read and wrote a single character at a time, which had a massive overhead associated with it. I previously benchmarked semihosting on this device, and I was getting ~20KiB/s, but uIP’s SLIP implementation was designed for very low memory devices, so it was serialising the data byte by byte.
We have a whopping 3kiB of RAM to play with, so I added a ring buffer to cache reads from the host and feed them into the SLIP poll function. I also split writes in batches to allow for escaping.</p><p>Now this is what I call blazingly fast! Pings now take 20ms, no packet loss and a full page loads in about 160ms. This was using using almost all of the RAM, but I could also dial down the sizes of the buffer to have more than enough headroom to run other tasks. The project repo has everything set to a nice balance latency and RAM usage:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>Memory region         Used Size  Region Size  %age Used
           FLASH:        5116 B        24 KB     20.82%
             RAM:        1380 B         3 KB     44.92%
</code></pre><p>For this blog however, I paid for none of the RAM, so I’ll use all of the RAM.</p><p>As you may have noticed, we have just under 20kiB (80%) of storage space. That may not be enough to ship all of React, but as you can see, it’s more than enough to host this entire blog post.
And this is not just a static page server, you can run any server-side code you want, if you know C that is.</p><p>Just for fun, I added a json api endpoint to get the number of requests to the main page (since the last crash) and the unique ID of the microcontroller.</p><h2 id="resources">Resources<a href="#resources" arialabel="Anchor">#</a></h2><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/BogdanTheGeek/semihost-ip">Code for this project</a></li></ul></div></div>]]></description>

<p>React is no longer winning by technical merit. Today it is winning by default. That default is now slowing innovation across the frontend ecosystem.</p>
<p>When teams need a new frontend, the conversation rarely starts with “What are the constraints and which tool best fits them?” It often starts with “Let’s use React; everyone knows React.” That reflex creates a self-perpetuating cycle where network effects, rather than technical fit, decide architecture.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, frameworks with real innovations struggle for adoption. Svelte compiles away framework overhead. Solid delivers fine-grained reactivity without virtual-DOM tax. Qwik achieves instant startup via resumability. These approaches can outperform React’s model in common scenarios, but they rarely get a fair evaluation because React is chosen by default.</p>
<p>React is excellent at many things. The problem isn’t React itself, it’s the React-by-default mindset.</p>
<h2 id="the-innovation-ceiling">The Innovation Ceiling</h2>
<p>React’s technical foundations explain some of today’s friction. The virtual DOM was a clever solution for 2013’s problems, but as Rich Harris outlined in <a href="https://svelte.dev/blog/virtual-dom-is-pure-overhead">“Virtual DOM is pure overhead”</a>, it introduces work modern compilers can often avoid.</p>
<p>Hooks addressed class component pain but introduced new kinds of complexity: dependency arrays, stale closures, and misused effects. Even React’s own docs emphasize restraint: <a href="https://react.dev/learn/you-might-not-need-an-effect">“You Might Not Need an Effect”</a>. Server Components improve time-to-first-byte, but add architectural complexity and new failure modes.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler">React Compiler</a> is a smart solution that automates patterns like <code>useMemo</code>/<code>useCallback</code>. Its existence is also a signal: we’re optimizing around constraints baked into the model.</p>
<p>Contrast this with alternative approaches: Svelte 5’s <a href="https://svelte.dev/blog/runes">Runes</a> simplify reactivity at compile time; Solid’s <a href="https://www.solidjs.com/docs/latest#reactivity">fine-grained reactivity</a> updates exactly what changed; Qwik’s <a href="https://qwik.builder.io/docs/concepts/resumable/">resumability</a> eliminates traditional hydration. These aren’t incremental tweaks to React’s model—they’re different models with different ceilings.</p>
<p>Innovation without adoption doesn’t change outcomes. Adoption can’t happen when the choice is made by reflex.</p>
<h2 id="the-technical-debt-were-all-carrying">The Technical Debt We’re All Carrying</h2>
<p>Defaulting to React often ships a runtime and reconciliation cost we no longer question. Even when it’s fast enough, the ceiling is lower than compile-time or fine-grained models. Developer time is spent managing re-renders, effect dependencies, and hydration boundaries instead of shipping value. The broader lesson from performance research is consistent: JavaScript is expensive on the critical path (<a href="https://medium.com/dev-channel/the-cost-of-javascript-84009f51e99e">The Cost of JavaScript</a>).</p>
<p>We’ve centered mental models around “React patterns” instead of web fundamentals, reducing portability of skills and making architectural inertia more likely.</p>
<p>The loss isn’t just performance, it’s opportunity cost when better-fit alternatives are never evaluated. For instance, benchmarks like the <a href="https://krausest.github.io/js-framework-benchmark/">JS Framework Benchmark</a> show alternatives like Solid achieving up to 2-3x faster updates in reactivity-heavy scenarios compared to React.</p>
<h2 id="the-frameworks-being-suffocated">The Frameworks Being Suffocated</h2>
<h3 id="svelte-the-compiler-revolution">Svelte: The Compiler Revolution</h3>
<p>Svelte shifts work to compile time: no virtual DOM, minimal runtime. Components become targeted DOM operations. The mental model aligns with web fundamentals.</p>
<p>But “not enough jobs” keeps Svelte adoption artificially low despite its technical superiority for most use cases. Real-world examples, like The Guardian’s adoption of Svelte for their frontend, demonstrate measurable gains in performance and developer productivity, with reported reductions in bundle sizes and faster load times. For instance, as detailed in <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/javascript-framework-puts-web-pages-diet/">Wired’s article on Svelte</a>, developer Shawn Wang (<a href="https://x.com/swyx">@swyx</a> on X/Twitter) reduced his site’s size from 187KB in React to just 9KB in Svelte by leveraging its compile-time optimizations, which shift framework overhead away from runtime. This leads to faster, more efficient apps especially on slow connections.</p>
<h3 id="solid-the-reactive-primitive-approach">Solid: The Reactive Primitive Approach</h3>
<p>Solid delivers fine-grained reactivity with JSX familiarity. Updates flow through signals directly to affected DOM nodes, bypassing reconciliation bottlenecks. Strong performance characteristics, limited mindshare. As outlined in Solid’s <a href="https://www.solidjs.com/guides/comparison">comparison guide</a>, this approach enables more efficient updates than React’s virtual DOM, with precise reactivity that minimizes unnecessary work and improves developer experience through simpler state management.</p>
<p>While prominent case studies are scarcer than for more established frameworks, this is largely due to Solid’s lower adoption. Yet anecdotal reports from early adopters suggest similar transformative gains in update efficiency and code simplicity, waiting to be scaled and shared as more teams experiment.</p>
<h3 id="qwik-the-resumability-innovation">Qwik: The Resumability Innovation</h3>
<p>Qwik uses resumability instead of hydration, enabling instant startup by loading only what the current interaction needs. Ideal for large sites, long sessions, or slow networks. According to Qwik’s <a href="https://qwik.dev/docs/concepts/think-qwik/">Think Qwik guide</a>, this is achieved through progressive loading and serializing both state and code. Apps can thus resume execution instantly without heavy client-side bootstrapping, resulting in superior scalability and reduced initial load times compared to traditional frameworks.</p>
<p>Success stories for Qwik may be less visible simply because fewer teams have broken from defaults to try it. But those who have report dramatic improvements in startup times and resource efficiency, indicating a wealth of untapped potential if adoption grows.</p>
<p>All three under-adopted not for lack of merit, but because the default choice blocks trying them out.</p>
<p>Furthermore, React’s API surface area is notably larger and more complex than its alternatives, encompassing concepts like hooks, context, reducers, and memoization patterns that require careful management to avoid pitfalls. This expansive API contributes to higher cognitive load for developers, often leading to bugs from misunderstood dependencies or over-engineering. For example, in Cloudflare’s <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/deep-dive-into-cloudflares-sept-12-dashboard-and-api-outage/">September 12, 2025 outage</a>, a useEffect hook with a problematic dependency array triggered repeated API calls, overwhelming their Tenant Service and causing widespread failures. In contrast, frameworks like Svelte, Solid, and Qwik feature smaller, more focused APIs that emphasize simplicity and web fundamentals, reducing the mental overhead and making them easier to master and maintain.</p>
<h2 id="the-network-effect-prison">The Network Effect Prison</h2>
<p>React’s dominance creates self-reinforcing barriers. Job postings ask for “React developers” rather than “frontend engineers,” limiting skill diversity. Component libraries and team muscle memory create institutional inertia.</p>
<p>Risk-averse leaders choose the “safe” option. Schools teach what jobs ask for. The cycle continues independent of technical merit.</p>
<p>That’s not healthy competition; it’s ecosystem capture by default.</p>
<h2 id="breaking-the-network-effect">Breaking the Network Effect</h2>
<p>Escaping requires deliberate action at multiple levels. Technical leaders should choose based on constraints and merits, not momentum. Companies can allocate a small innovation budget to trying alternatives. Developers can upskill beyond a single mental model.</p>
<p>Educators can teach framework-agnostic concepts alongside specific tools. Open source contributors can help alternative ecosystems mature.</p>
<p>Change won’t happen automatically. It requires conscious choice.</p>
<h2 id="framework-evaluation-checklist">Framework Evaluation Checklist</h2>
<p>To make deliberate choices, use this simple checklist when starting a new project:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Assess Performance Needs</strong>: Evaluate metrics like startup time, update efficiency, and bundle size. Prioritize frameworks with compile-time optimizations if speed is critical.</li>
<li><strong>Team Skills and Learning Curve</strong>: Consider existing expertise but factor in migration paths; many alternatives offer gentle ramps (e.g., Solid’s JSX compatibility with React).</li>
<li><strong>Scaling and Cost of Ownership</strong>: Calculate long-term costs, including maintenance, dependency management, and tech debt. Alternatives often reduce runtime overhead, lowering hosting costs and improving scalability.</li>
<li><strong>Ecosystem Fit</strong>: Balance maturity with innovation; pilot in non-critical areas to test migration feasibility and ROI.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-standard-counterarguments">The Standard Counter‑Arguments</h2>
<p><strong>“But ecosystem maturity!”</strong> Maturity is valuable, and can also entrench inertia. Age isn’t the same as fitness for today’s constraints.</p>
<p>Additionally, a mature ecosystem often means heavy reliance on third-party packages, which can introduce maintenance burdens like keeping dependencies up-to-date, dealing with security vulnerabilities, and bloating bundles with unused code. While essential in some cases, this flexibility can lead to over-dependence; custom solutions tailored to specific needs are often leaner and more maintainable in the long run. Smaller ecosystems in alternative frameworks encourage building from fundamentals, fostering deeper understanding and less technical debt. Moreover, with AI coding assistants now able to generate precise, custom functions on demand, the barrier to creating bespoke utilities has lowered dramatically. This makes it feasible to avoid generic libraries like lodash or date libraries like Moment or date-fns entirely in favor of lightweight, app-specific implementations.</p>
<p><strong>“But hiring!”</strong> Hiring follows demand. You can de‑risk by piloting alternatives in non‑critical paths, then hiring for fundamentals plus on‑the‑job training.</p>
<p><strong>“But component libraries!”</strong> Framework‑agnostic design systems and Web Components reduce lock-in while preserving velocity.</p>
<p><strong>“But stability!”</strong> React’s evolution from classes to hooks to Server Components demonstrates constant churn, not stability.
Alternative frameworks often provide more consistent APIs.</p>
<p><strong>“But proven at scale!”</strong> jQuery was proven at scale too. Past
success doesn’t guarantee future relevance.</p>
<h2 id="the-broader-ecosystem-harm">The Broader Ecosystem Harm</h2>
<p>Monoculture slows web evolution when one framework’s constraints become de facto limits. Talent spends cycles solving framework-specific issues rather than pushing the platform forward. Investment follows incumbents regardless of technical merit.</p>
<p>Curricula optimize for immediate employability over fundamentals, creating framework-specific rather than transferable skills. Platform improvements get delayed because “React can handle it” becomes a default answer.</p>
<p>The entire ecosystem suffers when diversity disappears.</p>
<h2 id="the-garden-we-could-grow">The Garden We Could Grow</h2>
<p>Healthy ecosystems require diversity, not monocultures. Innovation emerges when different approaches compete and cross-pollinate. Developers grow by learning multiple mental models. The platform improves when several frameworks push different boundaries.</p>
<p>Betting everything on one model creates a single point of failure. What happens if it hits hard limits? What opportunities are we missing by not exploring alternatives?</p>
<p>It’s time to choose frameworks based on constraints and merit rather than momentum. Your next project deserves better than React-by-default. The ecosystem deserves the innovation only diversity can provide.</p>
<p>Stop planting the same seed by default. The garden we could cultivate through diverse framework exploration would be more resilient and more innovative than the monoculture we’ve drifted into.</p>
<p>The choice is ours to make.</p> </div>  </article>  </div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://kennedn.com/blog/posts/tapo/">https://kennedn.com/blog/posts/tapo/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45251690">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p><img src="https://kennedn.com/blog/posts/tapo/cover.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I recently bought a cheap Tapo indoor camera to see what my dog gets up to when I am out of the house.</p>
<p>What actually followed? I ended up reverse-engineering onboarding flows, decompiling an APK, MITMing TLS sessions, and writing cryptographic scripts.</p>
<p>My main motivation for this project really stemmed from the fact that the camera annoyed me from day one. Setting the camera up in frigate was quite painful, no one really seemed to know how these cameras worked online.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>SIDENOTE: If you want 2 way audio to work in frigate you must use the <code>tapo://</code> go2rtc configuration for your main stream instead of the usual <code>rtsp://</code>. TP-Link are lazy and only implement 2 way audio on their own proprietary API.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One undocumented behavior that tripped me up was that the device’s API is supposed to accept credentials <code>admin</code>:<code>&lt;your-tapo-cloud-password&gt;</code> after onboarding. However after banging my head against a wall for a few hours I later discovered that if you change your cloud password after onboarding, paired devices don’t get the memo 🙂.</p>
<p>This implied a few things to me that started the cogs turning:</p>
<ul>
<li>There must be a call made during on-boarding that syncs the device password with the cloud password</li>
<li>The device must either allow unauthenticated calls before this step or have some sort of default password.</li>
</ul>
<p>So considering my onboarding woes and the fact that I was starting to recoil every time the tapo app tried to jam a “Tapo Care” subscription down my throat, a cloudless onboarding solution for the device was beginning to look more and more desirable.</p>
<p>The first step to cracking this egg was to be be able to snoop on what the app and the camera are saying to each other during onboarding. E.g, establish a man in the middle.</p>
<h2 id="man-in-the-middle">Man in the middle</h2>
<p>To man in the middle a phone app, you must be able to route all http(s) traffic via a proxy server you control. Historically this has been quite simple to achieve, simply spin up a proxy on a computer, add the proxy’s self-signed certificate to the phone’s truststore, and configure the phone to point at the proxy.</p>
<p>However, modern phone apps can use a few nasty tricks to render this approach ineffective. Namely they will blatantly ignore proxies, throw the system truststore to the wind and make liberal use of certificate pinning.</p>
<p>The most full-proof technique for generically MITMing an app has therefore become dynamic instrumentation via tools like <code>frida</code>. What this allows us to do is force an app to use the proxies and certificates that we tell it to whilst batting aside it’s attempts to do things like certificate pinning.</p>
<p>So the setup ended up looking like this (full setup guide <a href="https://github.com/kennedn/tapo-onboarding?tab=readme-ov-file#capturing-onboarding-calls-from-tapo-app" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>

<p>After spinning up <code>mitmproxy</code>, injecting the <a href="https://github.com/httptoolkit/frida-interception-and-unpinning" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">frida scripts</a>
, and onboarding the camera, we finally see an initial login flow — before the admin password ever gets changed:</p>

<p>However, subsequent requests look like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Tapo 100% has a default password due to the fact that it performs a full login before it knows anything about the cloud password.</li>
<li>Tapo has an encrypted <code>securePassthrough</code> channel for its API calls to prevent peeping toms such as myself from spilling the beans.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-jadx-dive">The JADX dive</h2>
<p>The next logical step is to decompile the apk in JADX and start rummaging around for a default password.</p>
<p>The initial login call that we captured references an <code>admin</code> username:</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Searching for <code>"admin"</code> in JADX gives us many hits but there are a few concentrated in a <code>CameraOnboardingViewModel</code> class that look interesting:</p>
<p><img src="https://kennedn.com/blog/posts/tapo/jadx1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The function <code>m98131y2</code> appears to be returning a password that is then passed to the <code>new Account()</code> call. Following this function up the chain, we hit gold:</p>

<p><a href="#loginrequest">We already know</a>
 that the device is using <code>encrypt_type: 3</code>, so that means our default password is:</p>
<p><code>TPL075526460603</code></p>
<h2 id="teaching-mitmproxy-new-tricks">Teaching mitmproxy new tricks</h2>
<p>With the default password now revealed, we have the cards in our hand to derive session keys and decode the <code>securePassthrough</code> messages.</p>
<p>The only thing that would help us further is if we had a reference implementation for the authentication flow. This is where <a href="https://github.com/JurajNyiri/pytapo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PyTapo</a>
 really came in handy.</p>
<p>Using PyTapo as a reference, we could dump the session state and encrypted messages from mitmproxy and write a script to do some static analysis on the decrypted requests and responses, but a really cool feature of <code>mitmproxy</code> is that it supports scripting itself.</p>
<p>What this means is that we can pass a python script to mitmproxy, and have it directly decrypt request and response payloads inline whilst running a capture.</p>
<p>So I wrote <code>tapo_decrypt_pretty.py</code> which:</p>
<ul>
<li>Watches for the login handshake (<code>cnonce</code>, <code>nonce</code>, <code>device_confirm</code>)</li>
<li>Derives <code>lsk</code>/<code>ivb</code> session keys from it</li>
<li>Transparently decrypts subsequent API calls</li>
<li>Pretty-prints them inline in mitmproxy’s UI in <code>request_decrypted</code> and <code>response_decrypted</code> fields</li>
<li>Dumps them to JSON files for later analysis</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="analysing-the-results">Analysing the results</h2>
<p>The complete list of calls made by the Tapo app during onboarding were:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>getAppComponentList
</span></span><span><span>setLanguage
</span></span><span><span>scanApList
</span></span><span><span>bindToCloud

</span></span><span><span>getConnectStatus
</span></span><span><span>setAccountEnabled
</span></span><span><span>changeThirdAccount
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This boiled down to just four important calls:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>scanApList</code> — list Wi-Fi access points</li>
<li><code>setAccountEnabled</code> + <code>changeThirdAccount</code> — enable RTSP/ONVIF account</li>
<li><code>changeAdminPassword</code> — change from default password to the cloud password</li>
<li><code>connectAp</code> — join the selected Wi-Fi access point</li>
</ol>
<p>Everything else was fluff: timezones, record plans, binding to cloud.</p>
<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h2>
<p>In the end, the prize for all this nonsense was a scrappy little Bash script, <a href="https://github.com/kennedn/tapo-onboarding/blob/main/tapo_onboard.sh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>tapo_onboard.sh</code></a>
, which:</p>
<ul>
<li>Logs in with the default admin password,</li>
<li>Scans and selects a Wifi access point</li>
<li>Switches off the obnoxious OSD logo on the camera feed,</li>
<li>Enables RTSP/ONVIF capabilities</li>
<li>Changes the admin password,</li>
<li>And finally joins the Wi-Fi.</li>
</ul>

<p>Peeling this onion left me with a few observations on Tapo’s firmware.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some endpoints use SHA-256 for hashing, while others cling to MD5 like it’s 2003.</li>
<li>There are <em>two</em> public keys used to send passwords to the device — one that is shared with the client and another super secret one that’s hardcoded in the app. The easiest way to figure out which one to use is to flip a coin.</li>
<li>Password syncing between the app and its managed devices is strictly vibe-based.</li>
</ul>
<p>The whole thing feels like it was cobbled together by a consortium of couch-cryptographers. But then again, it was the cheapest indoor camera on amazon, so what did I expect?</p>
<p>And with all this said I did finally manage to figure out what the dog does when I am away.</p>
<p>She sleeps. On the sofa. Sometimes even in her bed.</p>

<p>Next month, Microsoft will begin automatically installing the Microsoft 365 Copilot app on Windows devices outside of the EEA region that have the Microsoft 365 desktop client apps.</p>

<p>The Microsoft 365 Copilot app integrates the AI-powered Copilot assistant with Microsoft 365 suite apps, including Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, as well as other features like Notebooks and AI agents.</p>

<ol data-border="0" data-indent="0" data-list-tree="true" data-stringify-type="ordered-list"></ol><p>Redmond also advised admins to notify their organizations' helpdesk teams and users before the app is forcibly installed on their devices "to reduce confusion and support requests."</p>

<p>The rollout will start in early October and be completed by mid-November; however,&nbsp;the Microsoft 365 Copilot app will not be installed on systems within the European Economic Area (EEA).</p>

<p>"Starting in October 2025, Microsoft will begin automatically installing the Microsoft 365 Copilot app on Windows devices that have Microsoft 365 desktop client apps," the company said in a <a href="https://admin.microsoft.com/#/MessageCenter/:/messages/MC1152323" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Microsoft 365 message center update</a> on Friday.</p>

<p>"This app provides a centralized entry point for accessing Copilot experiences and AI-powered capabilities across Microsoft 365. This change simplifies access to Copilot and ensures users can easily discover and engage with productivity-enhancing features."</p>

<p>While the newly installed app will be added to the Windows Start Menu and enabled by default, IT administrators responsible for managing Microsoft 365 app deployments <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/copilot/microsoft-365/deploy-microsoft-365-copilot-app#deploy-the-app-with-microsoft-365-apps" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">will be able to opt out</a> in the Apps Admin Center:</p>

<ol data-border="0" data-indent="0" data-list-tree="true" data-stringify-type="ordered-list"><li>Sign in to the <a data-linktype="external" href="https://config.office.com/deploymentsettings" rel="nofollow noopener">Microsoft 365 Apps admin center</a> with an admin account.</li>
	<li>Go to <em>Customization &gt; Device Configuration &gt; Modern App Settings</em>.</li>
	<li>Select <em>Microsoft 365 Copilot app</em>, then clear the <em>Enable automatic installation of Microsoft 365 Copilot app</em> check box.</li>
</ol><p>Although&nbsp;many users may notice a new&nbsp;Microsoft 365 Copilot app icon in the Start menu, the application may have already been installed, resulting in no apparent change.</p>

<p>Last month, as part of the same effort to make Copilot more easily available, Microsoft <a href="https://admin.microsoft.com/#/MessageCenter/:/messages/MC1073071" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">announced</a> that it will integrate Microsoft 365 Copilot agents into the Edge sidebar starting in late September 2025, allowing users to access them while using Copilot.</p>

<p>Weeks earlier, it <a href="https://admin.microsoft.com/#/MessageCenter/:/messages/MC1115982" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">added a new setting</a> that allows Microsoft 365 admins to pin the Microsoft 365 Copilot app to the Windows taskbar.</p>

  <h2>
    <a href="https://blog.asciinema.org/post/three-point-o/">3.0</a>
    <span>Published on 15 Sep 2025 by Marcin Kulik</span>
  </h2>
  <p>I’m happy to announce the release of asciinema CLI 3.0!</p>
<p>This is a complete rewrite of asciinema in Rust, upgrading the recording file
format, introducing terminal live streaming, and bringing numerous improvements
across the board.</p>
<p>In this post, I’ll go over the highlights of the release. For a deeper overview
of new features and improvements, see the <a href="https://github.com/asciinema/asciinema/releases/tag/v3.0.0">release
notes</a> and the
detailed
<a href="https://github.com/asciinema/asciinema/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md">changelog</a>.</p>
<p>First, let’s get the Rust rewrite topic out of the way. I did it because I felt
like it. But seriously, I felt like it because I prefer working with Rust 100x
more than with Python these days. And this type of code, with syscalls and
concurrency, is way easier to deal with in Rust than in Python. That’s my
experience, YMMV. Anyway, in addition to making me enjoy working with this
component of asciinema again, the rewrite resulted in faster startup, easier
installation (a static binary), and made many new features possible by
integrating <a href="https://github.com/asciinema/avt">asciinema virtual terminal</a>
(also Rust) into the CLI.</p>
<p>Let’s look at what’s cool and new now.</p>
<h2 id="asciicast-v3-file-format">asciicast v3 file format</h2>
<p>The new <a href="https://docs.asciinema.org/manual/asciicast/v3/">asciicast v3</a> file
format is an evolution of the good old asciicast v2. It addresses several
shortcomings of the previous format that were discovered over the years.</p>
<p>The major change in the new format is the use of intervals (deltas) for timing
session events. v2 used absolute timestamps (measured since session start),
which had its own pros and cons. One often-brought-up issue was the difficulty
of editing the recordings - timestamps of all following events had to be
adjusted when adding/removing/updating events.</p>
<p>Other than timing, the header has been restructured, grouping related things
together, e.g. all terminal-related metadata is now under <code>term</code>. There’s also
support for the new <code>"x"</code> (exit) event type, for storing the session exit
status. Finally, line comments are allowed by using the <code>#</code> character as the
first character on a line.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of a short recording in asciicast v3 format:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="json"><span><span>{<span>"version"</span>: <span>3</span>, <span>"term"</span>: {<span>"cols"</span>: <span>80</span>, <span>"rows"</span>: <span>24</span>, <span>"type"</span>: <span>"xterm-256color"</span>}, <span>"timestamp"</span>: <span>1504467315</span>, <span>"title"</span>: <span>"Demo"</span>, <span>"env"</span>: {<span>"SHELL"</span>: <span>"/bin/zsh"</span>}}
</span></span><span><span># event stream follows the header
</span></span><span><span>[<span>0.248848</span>, <span>"o"</span>, <span>"Hey Dougal...\n"</span>]
</span></span><span><span>[<span>0.248848</span>, <span>"o"</span>, <span>"Yes Ted?\n"</span>]
</span></span><span><span>[<span>1.001376</span>, <span>"o"</span>, <span>"Is there anything on your mind?\n"</span>]
</span></span><span><span>[<span>3.500000</span>, <span>"m"</span>, <span>""</span>]
</span></span><span><span>[<span>0.143733</span>, <span>"o"</span>, <span>"No."</span>]
</span></span><span><span># terminal window resized to <span>90</span> cols and <span>30</span> rows
</span></span><span><span>[<span>2.050000</span>, <span>"r"</span>, <span>"90x30"</span>]
</span></span><span><span>[<span>1.541828</span>, <span>"o"</span>, <span>"Bye!"</span>]
</span></span><span><span>[<span>0.8870</span>, <span>"x"</span>, <span>"0"</span>]
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The new format is already supported by <a href="https://docs.asciinema.org/manual/server/">asciinema
server</a> and <a href="https://docs.asciinema.org/manual/player/">asciinema
player</a>.</p>
<h2 id="live-terminal-streaming">Live terminal streaming</h2>
<p>The new CLI allows for live streaming of terminal sessions, and provides two
modes for doing so.</p>
<p>Local mode uses built-in HTTP server, allowing people to view the stream on
trusted networks (e.g. a LAN). In this mode no data is sent anywhere, except to
the viewers’ browsers, which may require opening a firewall port. The CLI
bundles the latest version of asciinema player, and uses it to connect to the
stream from the page served by the built-in server.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ asciinema stream --local
::: asciinema session started
::: Live streaming at http://127.0.0.1:37881
::: Press &lt;ctrl+d&gt; or type 'exit' to end
$ _
</code></pre><p>Remote mode publishes the stream through an asciinema server (either
asciinema.org or a self-hosted one), which acts as a relay, delivering the
stream to the viewers at a shareable URL.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ asciinema stream --remote
::: asciinema session started
::: Live streaming at https://asciinema.org/s/TQGS82DwiBS1bYAY
::: Press &lt;ctrl+d&gt; or type 'exit' to end
$ _
</code></pre><p>The two modes can be used together as well.</p>
<p>Here’s a live stream of <code>btop</code> running on one of the asciinema.org servers:</p>

<p>You can also watch it directly on asciinema.org at
<a href="https://asciinema.org/s/olesiD03BIFH6Yz1">asciinema.org/s/olesiD03BIFH6Yz1</a>.</p>
<p>Read more about the streaming architecture and supported protocols
<a href="https://docs.asciinema.org/manual/server/streaming/">here</a>.</p>
<p>asciinema player (seen above) supports all the described protocols. To make the
viewing experience smooth and glitch-free, it implements an adaptive buffering
mechanism. It measures network latency in real-time and adjusts the buffer size
constantly, aiming for a good balance between low latency and buffer-underrun
protection.</p>
<p>asciinema server can now record every live stream and turn it into a regular
recording. At the moment, asciinema server running at asciinema.org has stream
recording disabled and a concurrent live stream limit of 1, but you can
self-host the server where recording is enabled and there’s no concurrent
stream limit by default. The limits on asciinema.org may change. I’d like to
first see how the streaming feature affects resource usage (btw, shout-out to
<a href="https://www.brightbox.com/">Brightbox</a>, which provides cloud services for
asciinema.org).</p>
<h2 id="local-first">Local-first</h2>
<p>In the early versions of asciinema, <code>asciinema rec</code> didn’t support saving to a
file - the recording was saved to a tmp file, uploaded to asciinema.org, and
the tmp file was removed. Later on, the CLI got the ability to specify a
filename, which allowed you to save the result of a recording session to a file
in asciicast v1 format and decide whether you want to keep it local only or
publish.</p>
<p>Although optional, the filename argument had long been available. However,
many, many tutorials on the internet (probably including asciinema’s own docs)
showed examples of recording and publishing in one go with <code>asciinema rec</code>.
That was fine - many people loved this short path from recording to sharing.</p>
<p>Over the years, I started seeing two problems with this. The first one is that
lots of people still think you must upload to asciinema.org, which is not true.
You can save locally and nothing leaves your machine. The second one is that
the optionality of the filename made it possible to unintentionally publish a
recording, and potentially leak sensitive data. And it’s a completely valid
concern!</p>
<p>Because of that, on several occasions I’ve seen negative comments saying
“asciinema is shady” /m\. It was never shady. It’s just a historical thing. I
just kept the original behavior for backward compatibility. asciinema.org is
not a commercial product - it’s <em>an</em> instance of asciinema server, which is
meant to give users an easy way to share, and to give a taste of what you get
when you self-host the server. In fact, I encourage everyone to self-host it,
as the recordings uploaded to asciinema.org are a liability for me (while being
a good promotion of the project :)).</p>
<p>I hope this clears up any confusion and suspicion.</p>
<p>Anyway, many things have changed since the original behavior of <code>asciinema rec</code> was implemented, including my approach to sharing my data with cloud
services. These days I self-host lots of services on a server at home, and I
try to avoid cloud services if I can (I’m pragmatic about it though).</p>
<p>The streaming feature was built from the ground up to support the local mode,
which came first, and the remote mode followed.</p>
<p>In asciinema CLI 2.4, released 2 years ago, I made the <code>upload</code> command show a
prompt where you have to explicitly make a decision on what to do with the
recording. It looked like this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ asciinema rec
asciinema: recording asciicast to /tmp/tmpo8_612f8-ascii.cast
asciinema: press &lt;ctrl-d&gt; or type "exit" when you're done
$ echo hello
hello
$ exit 
asciinema: recording finished
(s)ave locally, (u)pload to asciinema.org, (d)iscard
[s,u,d]? _
</code></pre><p>It was a stopgap and a way to prepare users for further changes that are coming
now.</p>
<p>In 3.0, the filename is always required, and the <code>rec</code> command no longer has
upload capability. To publish a recording to asciinema.org or a self-hosted
asciinema server, use the explicit <code>asciinema upload &lt;filename&gt;</code>.</p>
<h2 id="more-self-hosting-friendly">More self-hosting-friendly</h2>
<p>A related improvement introduced in this release is the new server URL prompt.</p>
<p>When using a command that integrates with asciinema server (<code>upload</code>, <code>stream</code>,
<code>auth</code>) for the first time, a prompt is shown, pre-filled with
<a href="https://asciinema.org/">https://asciinema.org</a> (for convenience). This lets you choose an asciinema
server instance explicitly and intentionally. The choice is saved for future
invocations.</p>
<p>It was always possible to <a href="https://docs.asciinema.org/manual/cli/configuration/">point the CLI to another asciinema
server</a> with a config
file or environment variable, but this new prompt should come in handy
especially when running the CLI in a non-workstation/non-laptop yet interactive
environment, such as a fresh VM or a dev container.</p>
<p>This change should make it easier to use the CLI with your own asciinema
server, and at the same time it doubles as an additional guard preventing
unintended data leaks (to asciinema.org).</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>I’m really excited about this release. It’s been in the making for a while, but
it’s out now, and I’m looking forward to seeing what new use-cases and
workflows people will discover with it.</p>
<p>It’s going to take a moment until 3.0 shows up in package repositories for all
supported platforms/distros. Meanwhile, you can download prebuilt binaries for
GNU/Linux and macOS from the <a href="https://github.com/asciinema/asciinema/releases/tag/v3.0.0">GitHub
release</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/asciinema/asciinema#building">build
it from source</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading to this point!</p>

Here’s a quick demo: (<a href="https://youtu.be/kFCzKE89LD8" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/kFCzKE89LD8</a>).</p><p>We started in 2023 as a way to reliably run async background jobs/workflows in TypeScript (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34610686">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34610686</a>). Initially we didn’t deploy your code, we just orchestrated it. But we found that most developers struggled to write reliable code with implicit determinism, found breaking their work into small “steps” tricky, and they wanted to install any system packages they needed. Serverless timeouts made this even more painful.</p><p>We also wanted to allow you to wait for things to happen: on external events, other tasks finishing, or just time passing. Those waits can take minutes, hours, or forever in the case of events, so you can’t just keep a server running.</p><p>The solution was to build and operate our own serverless cloud infrastructure. The key breakthrough that enabled this was realizing we could snapshot the CPU and memory state. This allowed us to pause running code, store the snapshot, then restore it later on a different physical server. We currently use Checkpoint Restore In Userspace (CRIU) which Google has been using at scale inside Borg since 2018.</p><p>Since then, our adoption has really taken off especially because of AI agents/workflows. This has opened up a ton of new use cases like compute-heavy tasks such as generating videos using AI (Icon.com), real-time computer use (Scrapybara), AI enrichment pipelines (Pallet, Centralize), and vibe coding tools (Hero UI, Magic Patterns, Capy.ai).</p><p>You can get started with Trigger.dev cloud (<a href="https://cloud.trigger.dev/">https://cloud.trigger.dev</a>), self-hosting (<a href="https://trigger.dev/docs/self-hosting/overview">https://trigger.dev/docs/self-hosting/overview</a>), or read the docs (<a href="https://trigger.dev/docs">https://trigger.dev/docs</a>).</p><p>Here’s a sneak peek at some upcoming changes: 1) warm starts for self-hosting 2) switching to MicroVMs for execution – this will be open source, self-hostable, and will include checkpoint/restoring.</p><p>We’re excited to be sharing this with HN and are open to all feedback!</p></div></td></tr><tr></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td><form action="comment" method="post"></form></td></tr></tbody></table><br>

<p>A former <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/meta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Meta</a> product manager has claimed that the social network circumvented Apple’s <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">privacy</a> protections, as well as cheating advertisers, and fired him when he repeatedly raised the issue internally.</p>



<p>Meta is said to have found ways to identify Apple users even after they refused consent for app tracking, in order to avoid an estimated <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/11/01/apples-app-privacy-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$10 billion loss of revenue</a> …</p>







<p>Meta relied heavily on selling personalized advertising, which required it to be able to target particular demographics and interest groups. This was achieved by tracking individual users across different apps.</p>



<p>Apple’s <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/app-tracking-transparency/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">App Tracking Transparency</a> (ATT) was introduced in 2021 and meant that companies required user permission in order to carry out this tracking. Unsurprisingly, the vast majority of users declined.</p>



<p>It was estimated at the time that this would cost social media companies many billions of dollars, and Meta’s CFO warned investors that its own loss would be around $10B per year</p>







<p>It was quickly alleged that <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/09/22/app-tracking-transparency-workaround/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Meta was using workarounds</a> to continue to track users who had denied permission, alongside <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/08/24/facebook-privacy-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">other privacy violations</a>. A class action lawsuit followed.</p>



<p>A fired product manager at the company, Samujjal Purkayastha, has now taken his case to an employment tribunal claiming he was unlawfully dismissed for raising concerns about the practice, reports the <em><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/be6a99d2-22de-48ec-9afa-1d2e2f709afc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Financial Times</a></em>.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Meta secretly linked user data with other information to track users’ activity on other websites without their permission — despite Apple in 2021 introducing measures explicitly requiring consent, according to Purkayastha’s filings […]</p>



<p>A “closed and secretive” team at Meta is alleged to have used “deterministic matching” — gathering identifiable information that could then be used to connect data across multiple platforms in violation of Apple’s new privacy policies.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He also accuses Meta of inflating the value of sales achieved by advertising on its platforms.</p>



<p>Meta denies any wrongdoing, and claims that Purkayastha was dismissed for unrelated reasons. The tribunal was unable to rule immediately, and said a full hearing will be held later in the year.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>

    

    <div>
        <p>I have an incredibly boring summer hobby: looking at the changelog for the <a href="https://github.com/WebKit/WebKit?ref=alastair.is" rel="noreferrer">WebKit Github repo</a>. Why? Because I spend a chunk of my professional life working with webviews inside mobile apps and I like to get an early peek into what's coming in the next version of iOS. Since Tim Cook has yet to stand up at WWDC and announce "one more thing... Service Worker support in WKWebView, provided you add the correct entry to the <code>WKAppBoundDomains</code> array in your <code>Info.plist</code>" (and you know what, he <em>should</em>) manual research is the order of the day.</p><p>So I was really interested to see, the day after WWDC finished, a pull request named:</p><blockquote><a href="https://github.com/WebKit/WebKit/pull/46754/files?ref=alastair.is" rel="noreferrer">[Materials] Rename "hosted blur" materials to reference "glass"</a></blockquote><p><a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/06/apple-introduces-a-delightful-and-elegant-new-software-design/?ref=alastair.is" rel="noreferrer">Liquid Glass</a> was one of the big takeaways from 2025's WWDC. Probably the biggest change in iOS UI since iOS 7 ditched the skeuomorphic look of the past. But that's all native UI, what does any of that have to do with webviews?</p><p>A poke around the context of the PR revealed something really interesting: Apple has a custom CSS property named <code>-apple-visual-effect</code> . Not only does it allow the use of Liquid Glass in iOS 26 (via values like <code>-apple-system-glass-material</code>) but all versions support using <a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/materials?ref=alastair.is#Standard-materials" rel="noreferrer">standard materials</a> with values like <code>-apple-system-blur-material-thin</code>.</p><h3 id="yes-it-works-and-no-we-cant">Yes it works and no, we can't</h3><p>Before you, like me, fire up Safari and start editing some CSS, I have bad news: no, it doesn't work on the web. As well it shouldn't. But it <em>also</em> doesn't work by default in an app using WKWebView, you have to toggle a setting in WKPreferences called <code>useSystemAppearance</code>... and it's <a href="https://github.com/WebKit/WebKit/blob/613c42873c56e2b2073f91b2983eec825be6a791/Source/WebKit/UIProcess/API/Cocoa/WKPreferencesInternal.h?ref=alastair.is#L59" rel="noreferrer">private</a>. So if you use it, say goodbye to App Store approval.</p><p>I wanted to try it out all the same so I hacked around to set <code>useSystemAppearance</code> to true, set my CSS to:</p><pre><code>.toolbar {
  border-radius: 50%;
  -apple-visual-effect: -apple-system-glass-material;
  height: 75px;
  width: 450px;
}</code></pre><p>lo and behold, it works!</p><figure data-kg-thumbnail="https://alastair.is/content/media/2025/09/glass_with_ipad_new_frame_thumb.jpg" data-kg-custom-thumbnail="">

        <img src="https://alastair.is/content/media/2025/09/glass_with_ipad_new_frame_thumb.jpg"></figure><p>Whoever it was at Apple that decided to make this a CSS property is a genius because it makes it incredibly easy to provide different rules based on Liquid Glass support:</p><pre><code>.toolbar {
  border-radius: 50%;
  height: 75px;
  width: 450px;
  background: rgba(204, 204, 204, 0.7);
}

@supports (-apple-visual-effect: -apple-system-glass-material) {
  background: transparent;
  -apple-visual-effect: -apple-system-glass-material
}</code></pre><h2 id="who-cares">Who cares?</h2><p>It's an interesting piece of trivia but no-one outside of Apple can use it. So what does it matter? It doesn't. Except for the implication for what I'll call Alastair's Grand Theory of In-App Webviews. Industry wide they don't have a great reputation. But my suggestion is this: <strong>the main reason webviews in apps have such a bad reputation is because you don't notice the webviews that are integrated seamlessly.</strong></p><p>It stands to reason that Apple wouldn't have developed this feature if they weren't using it. Where? We have no idea. But they must be using it <em>somewhere</em>. The fact that none of us have noticed exactly where suggests that we're interacting with webviews in our daily use of iOS without ever even realising it.</p><p>Food for thought!</p>

                        Change the CSS to use relative links.<br> (eg change <code>src: url(https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/firacode/v26/uU9eCBsR6Z2vfE9aq3bL0fxyUs4tcw4W_D1sJVD7Ng.woff2) format('woff2');</code> into <code>src: url(uU9eCBsR6Z2vfE9aq3bL0fxyUs4tcw4W_D1sJVD7Ng.woff2) format('woff2');</code>)
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                Paste the license of the font into a file. To find the license of a google font do:
                <ol start="0">
                    <li>Search for the font on <a href="https://fonts.google.com/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Google Fonts</a></li>
                    <li>Select the font</li>
                    <li>Select "License"</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                Add html to use the CSS like:
                <pre><code>&lt;link href="/Assets/Fonts/Fira/Code/2025-8-13/fira-code.css" rel="preload"&gt;
&lt;link href="/Assets/Fonts/Fira/Code/2025-8-13/fira-code.css" rel="stylesheet"&gt;</code></pre>
            </li>
            <li>
                Add css to use the font like:
<pre><code>code {
    font-family: "Fira Code", monospace;
    font-optical-sizing: auto;
    font-weight: 400;
    font-style: normal;
}</code></pre>
            </li>
            <li>
                Add a link to the font LICENSE and <strong>ensure that your usage of the font follows the license of the font</strong>.
            </li>
        </ol>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>PayPal Ushers in a New Era of Peer-to-Peer Payments, Reimagining How Money Moves to Anyone, Anywhere</p><p>Send and receive money as easily as sending a text, across apps, borders, and currencies

</p><div wd_resize="formatNews" wd_print_url="https://newsroom.paypal-corp.com/2025-09-15-PayPal-Ushers-in-a-New-Era-of-Peer-to-Peer-Payments,-Reimagining-How-Money-Moves-to-Anyone,-Anywhere?printable=1"><p>,  /<a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/" target="_blank">PRNewswire</a>/ --&nbsp;On the heels of the PayPal World announcement, a global platform connecting the world's largest digital payment systems and wallets, PayPal today introduced <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/digital-wallet/send-receive-money/paypal-link">PayPal links</a>, a new way to send and receive money through a personalized, one-time link that can be shared in any conversation.</p>

<p><img alt="PayPal app flow to create a personalized payment link" src="https://newsroom.paypal-corp.com/image/Links_16x7.jpg"><br>
<sub><em>Creating personalized payment links&nbsp; |&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://newsroom.paypal-corp.com/2025-09-15-PayPal-Ushers-in-a-New-Era-of-Peer-to-Peer-Payments,-Reimagining-How-Money-Moves-to-Anyone,-Anywhere#assets_117:19733">Click to Enlarge</a></em></sub></p>

<p>PayPal users in the U.S. can begin creating personalized payment links today, with international expansion to the UK, <span>Italy</span>, and other markets starting later this month. By making payments this simple and universal, PayPal links helps drive new customer acquisition and brings more users into the PayPal ecosystem.</p>

<p>The peer-to-peer (P2P) experience is about to go even further. <span>Crypto</span> will soon be directly integrated into PayPal's new P2P payment flow in the app. This will make it more convenient for PayPal users in the U.S. to send <span>Bitcoin</span>, <span>Ethereum</span>, PYUSD, and more, to PayPal, Venmo, as well a rapidly growing number of digital wallets across the world that support <span>crypto</span> and stablecoins.</p>

<p>Expanding what people can do with PayPal also comes with reassurance around how personal payments are handled. As always, friends-and-family transfers through Venmo and PayPal are exempt from 1099-K reporting. Users won't receive tax forms for gifts, reimbursements, or splitting expenses, helping ensure that personal payments stay personal.</p>

<p>"For 25 years, PayPal has revolutionized how money moves between people. Now, we're taking the next major step," said <span>Diego Scotti</span>, General Manager, Consumer Group at PayPal. "Whether you're texting, messaging, or emailing, now your money follows your conversations. Combined with PayPal World, it's an unbeatable value proposition, showing up where people connect, making it effortless to pay your friends and family, no matter where they are or what app they're using."</p>

<p>P2P is a cornerstone of PayPal's consumer experience, driving engagement and bringing more users into the ecosystem. P2P and other consumer total payment volume saw solid growth in the second quarter, increasing 10% year-over-year as the company focused on improving the experience and increasing user discoverability to make it easier than ever to move money globally. Plus, Venmo saw its highest TPV growth in three years. With PayPal World unlocking seamless interoperability, P2P is poised for even greater momentum in the future as PayPal and Venmo connect to billions of wallets worldwide.</p>

<p><b><i>How PayPal links work:</i></b></p>

<ul type="disc">
	<li><b>Create a personalized link</b> – Open the PayPal app, enter the details of your payment or request, and generate a unique, one-time link to share.</li>
	<li><b>Always the right person</b> – Each link is private, one-time use, and created for a specific transaction.</li>
	<li><b>Drop it anywhere</b> – Send your link in a text, DM, email, or chat. Add a note, emoji, or payment note.</li>
	<li><b>Manage payment activity:</b> Unclaimed links expire after 10 days. Users can send a reminder or even cancel the payment or request before the link is claimed with the PayPal app.</li>
	<li><b>Tap and done</b> – The recipient taps the link and either completes or accepts the payment within the PayPal App with their PayPal account.</li>
	<li><b>Funds are instant </b>– the recipient will get immediate access to their funds with a PayPal Balance account once accepted.<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>These are CubeSats. Satellites that are going to space—or at least, the ones I have here are <em>prototypes</em>. But these have one thing in common: they're all powered by either a Raspberry Pi, or a microcontroller.</p>

<p>There are already Pis in space, like on Mark Rober's <a href="https://space.crunchlabs.com/">SatGus</a>, on <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/worlds-first-raspberry-pi-powered-cubesat-celebrates-record-making-orbit/">GASPACS</a>, and the <a href="https://astro-pi.org/">Astro Pis on the Space station</a>. Another Pi is going up <em>this weekend</em>, which is why I'm posting <em>this</em> today. I'll get to that one, but I wanted to spend some time talking about two things that fascinate me: Raspberry Pis, and putting them space!</p>

<p>In this post, I'll cover:</p>

<ul>
<li>What is a CubeSat</li>
<li>Who builds and launches CubeSats</li>
<li>How <em>you</em> can build your own CubeSat</li>
</ul>

<p>Then for a bonus, in today's video, I interviewed two people helping students launch SilverSat into space (this weekend!), and a YouTuber who I've learned a lot from about track satellites (including CubeSats) from your own backyard!</p>

<div>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qvN3sE2Nv4U" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
</div>

<p>The rest of this post contains a lightly-edited transcript of the video above.</p>

<p>So let's dive in.</p>

<h2>What's a CubeSat?</h2>

<p>What's a CubeSat? Well, it's in the name—it's a satellite that's a cube!</p>

<p>But they don't have to be a cube, these smallest ones are '1U', or 10 x 10 x 10 centimeters. You can also find 2U CubeSats, like the taller Build a CubeSat, which is <em>20</em> centimeters tall. (Well, technically the current prototype is 1.5U).</p>

<p><a href="https://isstracker.pl/en/satellites/62713">SatGus</a>, Mark Rober's satellite taking space selfies, is a whopping <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KcV1C1Ui5s">12U</a>! They needed all that extra space to fit a phone, a mechanism to <em>deploy</em> the phone, a camera to take the selfie, a Raspberry Pi to control the phone, and redundant systems for <em>everything</em>. They've already taken <em>thousands</em> of selfies, and SatGus has me beat. My best Pi might get to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXXKi-J0gs4">3.4 Gigahertz</a>, but the Pi on SatGus is whizzing through space at almost <a href="https://www.pulsesat.com/satellites/s/302a5e31-68b8-422a-86fd-cfe32474ef6e/"><em>17,000 miles per hour</em></a>. That's <em>7,570 meters per second</em> for everyone else in the world.</p>

<p>But back to CubeSats. Having standards means you can build off existing work for the hard things, like a space-rated Aluminum frame, or the complex EPS, or Electrical Power System board.</p>

<p>Then you can add in custom parts, like a Pi to run experiments, a communications board with antennas and radios, cameras, sensors, and more!</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/cubesat-build-a-cubesat-antennas.jpeg" width="700" height="394" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-6c8bc5c8-7585-48d8-a06c-f10d1140d008" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;6c8bc5c8-7585-48d8-a06c-f10d1140d008&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="Build a CubeSat Antennas"></p>

<p>And <em>these</em> cubesats have normal screw-on antennas, but the way these things are deployed, you only get 10x10x10 centimeters—you can't have an antenna poking out the top. So they use cool things like <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-19-7474-8_15">flexible tape antennas</a> that pop out once your CubeSat deploys.</p>

<p>What else makes CubeSats cool?</p>

<p>Well, how about price? In the old days, you had to have like $10 million to build a satellite, and $60+ million to launch it into space.</p>

<p>Today, you can build a space-ready CubeSat using a few <em>thousand</em> dollars of parts. Then you can launch it on a rideshare for... well, <a href="https://nanoracks.com/wp-content/uploads/Cubesat-Services.pdf">$85 grand</a>. Which is a <em>lot</em>, but it's not <em>$60 million-a-lot</em>.</p>

<p>So most of us won't be launching one of these things into space, unless maybe you can get a grant. But that doesn't mean they're not useful to us.</p>

<h2>Who builds CubeSats?</h2>

<p>Like with many projects, I love these things for the challenge, the way they break some of my assumptions, like working with Raspberry Pis.</p>

<p>If you're building a device that's less than 2 kilograms, has 1.8W of maximum continuous power draw, and needs to be operated remotely—even for just a month—you're immediately going to change your assumptions about how you build things.</p>

<p>I would hack Home Assistant onto a mini PC to monitor some sensors if I was feeling lazy—but that Mini PC would use an order of magnitude too much power for a CubeSat (much less the internal volume it would occupy).</p>

<p>On CubeSats, every millimeter, and every milliAmp has to be accounted for.</p>

<p>So to me, CubeSats are like Swiss watches of modern electronics. How many sensors can you fit in one? How much throughput can you get on a tiny radio with a small antenna? Can you get enough power out of tiny solar cells to keep the main flight computer working? How do you control thermals without air? How do you design it so it can recover from a complete power loss?</p>

<p>Every step of the way there are challenges; and that's before we even launch one! Someone who I think illustrates this best is Manuel, with his <a href="https://codeberg.org/buildacubesat-project">Build a CubeSat</a> project. He's working on this Cubesat:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/cubesat-build-a-cubesat.jpeg" width="700" height="394" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-e8f931dd-27ae-47b2-8834-4ee4dde6d557" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;e8f931dd-27ae-47b2-8834-4ee4dde6d557&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="Build a CubeSat"></p>

<p>He did a weather balloon launch this year, and he's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@buildacubesat">documenting everything on YouTube</a>.</p>

<p>His first launch had many small problems. But also great learning, especially around redundancy and how to get the thing off the <em>launch</em> stand without problems.</p>

<p>And you're not only dealing with hardware, but also with <em>software</em>. And software that, at its core, <em>has</em> to be remotely accessed. And not only remote, but also <em>wireless</em>, meaning anyone <em>else</em> on earth within range can access it too.</p>

<p>So how do you keep it secure? That's something Tim from <a href="https://ethoslabs.space/">Ethos Labs</a> is also dealing with with <em>this</em>, his T.E.M.P.E.S.T. CubeSat:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/cubesat-tempest-with-ground-station.jpeg" width="700" height="394" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-d7c3fe9a-3901-4cca-8a05-cc8ee81a2027" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;d7c3fe9a-3901-4cca-8a05-cc8ee81a2027&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="CubeSat TEMPEST"></p>

<p>This thing is actually made to be <em>not</em> secure. It has intentional vulnerabilities, and he uses those to teach people different ways to make <em>their</em> CubeSats <em>more</em> secure.</p>

<p>You have complex hardware, running in limited space, with limited power and communications, and you want cram in as much functionality as possible.</p>

<p>Do you see where I'm going with this? That kind of problem is perfect for the microcontrollers and low-power SBCs that I love testing and playing with every day.</p>

<p>Except instead of me worrying about something consuming 10 watts, these guys are looking at a power budget of <em>one</em> watt. Or less!</p>

<p>These problems are <em>hard</em>. And not everyone has the patience for a completely custom project like Build a CubeSat, so there are also some small companies building <em>kits</em> to help you learn all these lessons with a little less stress.</p>

<p>Like what hardware do you need for a 100% self-contained CubeSat? And how do you get it certified for flight on a SpaceX rocket?</p>

<h2>Your own CubeSat</h2>

<p>Well, I'll quickly cover two products that are meant for like STEM classroom education, one from the lower end, and one that's based on a CubeSat that just flew this summer.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/cubesat-mysat.jpeg" width="700" height="394" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-65a69da8-2129-4089-9ead-f44b1a2c459c" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;65a69da8-2129-4089-9ead-f44b1a2c459c&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="MySat CubeSat"></p>

<p>The first one is the <a href="https://www.mysatkit.com/">MySat Kit</a>, that you can buy from MySat in Ukraine. It comes with a board powered by an ESP32 with a camera, light sensors, an LED, gyroscope, accelerometer, barometer, clock, and a few other boards. And these are all off-the-shelf components you can buy replacements for or use 'em with other hardware, like a Raspberry Pi.</p>

<p>The way it's put together won't hold up on a rocket launch, but it's not meant for that. It's meant to show you how it's built, how you can communicate with it, and that sort of thing.</p>

<p>It took like an hour to build, and once I put it together I tried flashing the flight control firmware with my Mac... but I ran into some issues with Arduino IDE, and that's a <em>me</em> problem and not so much a MySat problem. Plus the team behind it has a whole war going on that they've been dealing with, so I'll be patient and try getting it going later.</p>

<p>The MySat goes from like $130 for a basic kit where you 3D print your own frame, or up to $300 for a full kit including deployable solar panels.</p>

<p>On the higher end, there's <a href="https://www.robinson-aerospace.com/cubesat">RASCube</a>, and Edward Robinson, the 21 year old founder of Robinson Space, sent it over after he saw me posting about CubeSats online.</p>

<p>The RASCube comes from Australia, and Edward's mission is to teach students about space through hands-on building.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/rascube-lb-rbf-tag.jpeg" width="700" height="394" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-e33d0cda-b427-49c5-9378-1f723f535040" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;e33d0cda-b427-49c5-9378-1f723f535040&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="RASCube LB CubeSat"></p>

<p>I just built this LS version of the cube last week; it's the little brother to their V2 design, which <em>flew in space</em> on a Falcon 9 rocket earlier this year.</p>

<p>Like MySat, you build the kit with an EPS board for power, a computer board with all the controls, and a radio board that ties in GPS and radio comms.</p>

<p>The RASCubes are a bit more expensive, coming in at around $430 each for the LB, and $600 each for the full aluminum V2s. But the price tag on that also covers full lesson plans and resources for teachers.</p>

<p>I love these things—all the people I've talked to on this journey are motivated by the same thing: learning about space, electronics, and integrating hardware in a new way, and sharing what they learn with others, especially students.</p>

<h2>CubeSat T.E.M.P.E.S.T. and Build a CubeSat</h2>

<p>Like take Build a Cubesat. For that project, <a href="https://codeberg.org/buildacubesat-project/bac-hardware"><em>everything</em> is open source hardware</a>, and every part of the journey is being documented on YouTube.</p>

<p>One thing I learned from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDQ_N9Gvzqs">first flight test</a> was how weird it is to have your Pi go from like overheating on the ground, to getting really cold as it goes higher, but then overheating again in the upper atmosphere because there's not enough air to dissipate heat!</p>

<p>You start to realize some of the crazy physical conditions you'll deal with on orbit.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/cubesat-tempest-ground-station-pico.jpeg" width="700" height="394" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-ee5aabae-0658-476e-89bf-29164500901a" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;ee5aabae-0658-476e-89bf-29164500901a&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="CubeSat TEMPEST Ground Station Raspberry Pi Pico"></p>

<p>Back down to earth, though, for CubeSat Tempest: the whole reason this exists is to help people learn why security is important, even for a tiny CubeSat. More importantly, <a href="https://www.antisyphontraining.com/product/foundations-in-space-cybersecurity-hardware-edition-with-tim-fowler/">Tim Fowler's course</a> teaches people <em>how</em> to secure things like uplinks (see: the ground station pictured above) and flight control systems.</p>

<p>There are so many people like Tim, who work in their free time to try to teach about space, or engineering, or just small slices of things like security, using these tactile little cubes you can build and put next to your laptop on a desk.</p>

<p>It's crazy to think we're to a point where <em>students</em> can build these things, write flight control software, and even <em>launch 'em into space</em>!</p>

<p>And that brings me to <a href="https://silversat.org/">SilverSat</a>.</p>

<h2>SilverSat</h2>

<p>There's another CubeSat with a Raspberry Pi onboard, and it's launching NET <em>Sunday</em>, at 6:11 p.m. Eastern time, aboard a Falcon 9 rocket. What does NET mean? Well, as I found out when I visited Florida this summer, that means "No Earlier Than", and in spaceflight, many things delay launches.</p>

<p>The students who built SilverSat are no strangers to delays—they were originally supposed to see their CubeSat launch earlier this year, but the cargo module they were on got <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/03/nasa-sidelines-cygnus-spacecraft-after-damage-in-transit-to-launch-site/">damaged during transport</a>, and that delayed them for <em>months</em>.</p>

<p>I got to talk to two of the adults guiding the students on their first space launch, and I discussed the history of the project (it started up in <em>2017</em>), how they are supported by NASA's <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/cubesat-launch-initiative-introduction/">CubeSat Launch Initiative</a>, the importance of amateur radio for CubeSats, and why they chose a Raspberry Pi Zero for their onboard computer.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/raspberry-pi-zero-2w-rbf-tag.jpeg" width="700" height="394" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-1e5acf9b-eb16-4bb9-a0ff-c34d10da66d1" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;1e5acf9b-eb16-4bb9-a0ff-c34d10da66d1&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="Raspberry Pi with CubeSats"></p>

<p>That interview is tucked away in the last half of the video at the top of this post.</p>

<h2>Tracking Satellites from your backyard</h2>

<p>Also in that video, I spoke to Gabe from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@saveitforparts">saveitforparts</a>, and he mentioned it's not that difficult to listen in on satellites on orbit—including amateur CubeSats!</p>

<p>SilverSat will be broadcasting <a href="https://github.com/silver-sat/systems/wiki/SSDV">SSDV</a> (Slow-Scan Digital Video) at set times, and the <a href="https://silversat.org/mission-status/">schedule for that</a> should be posted on their website.</p>

<p>Check out the video embedded in this post (near the top), or Gabe's own channel for ideas for tracking satellites. It can be done with under $100 of equipment (usually just an SDR and a cheap antenna).</p>

<h2>Infectious Enthusiasm for Learning (and Teaching)</h2>

<p>I feel like a broken record, but one thing I love, talking to <em>anyone</em> in the CubeSat community is this sense of infectious enthusiasm. And I was going to cut this video out for time, but watching it back, I realized other people would probably enjoy Tim showing off some neat CubeSats in his personal collection as much as I did. So I put up some bonus content on my second channel, Level 2 Jeff; you can watch another 8 minutes of CubeSat hardware below:</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 id="preface">Preface<a href="#preface" arialabel="Anchor">#</a></h2><p>This article is <em>NOT</em> served from a web server running on a disposable vape. If you want to see the real deal, click <a href="http://ewaste.fka.wtf/">here</a>. The content is otherwise identical.</p><h2 id="background">Background<a href="#background" arialabel="Anchor">#</a></h2><p>For a couple of years now, I have been collecting disposable vapes from friends and family. Initially, I only salvaged the batteries for “future” projects (It’s not hoarding, I promise), but recently, disposable vapes have gotten more advanced. I wouldn’t want to be the lawyer who one day will have to argue how a device with USB C and a rechargeable battery can be classified as “disposable”. Thankfully, I don’t plan on pursuing law anytime soon.</p><p>Last year, I was tearing apart some of these fancier pacifiers for adults when I noticed something that caught my eye, instead of the expected black blob of goo hiding some ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuit) I see a little integrated circuit inscribed “PUYA”.
I don’t blame you if this name doesn’t excite you as much it does me, most people have never heard of them. They are most well known for their flash chips, but I first came across them after reading Jay Carlson’s blog post about <a href="https://jaycarlson.net/2023/02/04/the-cheapest-flash-microcontroller-you-can-buy-is-actually-an-arm-cortex-m0/">the cheapest flash microcontroller you can buy</a>. They are quite capable little ARM Cortex-M0+ micros.</p><p>Over the past year I have collected quite a few of these PY32 based vapes, all of them from different models of vape from the same manufacturer. It’s not my place to do free advertising for big tobacco, so I won’t mention the brand I got it from, but if anyone who worked on designing them reads this, thanks for labeling the debug pins!</p><h2 id="what-are-we-working-with">What are we working with<a href="#what-are-we-working-with" arialabel="Anchor">#</a></h2><p>The chip is marked <code>PUYA C642F15</code>, which wasn’t very helpful. I was pretty sure it was a <code>PY32F002A</code>, but after poking around with <a href="http://pyocd.io/">pyOCD</a>, I noticed that the flash was 24k and we have 3k of RAM. The extra flash meant that it was more likely a <code>PY32F002B</code>, which is actually a very different chip.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p><p>So here are the specs of a microcontroller so <em>bad</em>, it’s basically disposable:</p><ul><li>24MHz Coretex M0+</li><li>24KiB of Flash Storage</li><li>3KiB of Static RAM</li><li>a few peripherals, none of which we will use.</li></ul><p>You may look at those specs and think that it’s not much to work with. I don’t blame you, a 10y old phone can barely load google, and this is about 100x slower. I on the other hand see a <em>blazingly</em> fast web server.</p><h2 id="getting-online">Getting online<a href="#getting-online" arialabel="Anchor">#</a></h2><p>The idea of hosting a web server on a vape didn’t come to me instantly. In fact, I have been playing around with them for a while, but after writing my post on <a href="https://bogdanthegeek.github.io/blog/insights/jlink-rtt-for-the-masses/">semihosting</a>, the penny dropped.</p><p>If you don’t feel like reading that article, semihosting is basically syscalls for embedded ARM microcontrollers. You throw some values/pointers into some registers and call a breakpoint instruction. An attached debugger interprets the values in the registers and performs certain actions. Most people just use this to get some logs printed from the microcontroller, but they are actually bi-directional.</p><p>If you are older than me, you might remember a time before Wi-Fi and Ethernet, the dark ages, when you had to use dial-up modems to get online. You might also know that the ghosts of those modems still linger all around us. Almost all USB serial devices actually emulate those modems: a 56k modem is just 57600 baud serial device. Data between some of these modems was transmitted using a protocol called SLIP (Serial Line Internet Protocol).<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p><p>This may not come as a surprise, but Linux (and with some tweaking even macOS) supports SLIP. The <code>slattach</code> utility can make any <code>/dev/tty*</code> send and receive IP packets. All we have to do is put the data down the wire in the right format and provide a virtual tty.
This is actually easier than you might imagine, pyOCD can forward all semihosting though a telnet port. Then, we use <code>socat</code> to link that port to a virtual tty:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sh"><span><span>pyocd gdb -S -O semihost_console_type<span>=</span>telnet -T <span>$(</span>PORT<span>)</span> <span>$(</span>PYOCDFLAGS<span>)</span> &amp;
</span></span><span><span>socat PTY,link<span>=</span><span>$(</span>TTY<span>)</span>,raw,echo<span>=</span><span>0</span> TCP:localhost:<span>$(</span>PORT<span>)</span>,nodelay &amp;
</span></span><span><span>sudo slattach -L -p slip -s <span>115200</span> <span>$(</span>TTY<span>)</span> &amp;
</span></span><span><span>sudo ip addr add 192.168.190.1 peer 192.168.190.2/24 dev sl0
</span></span><span><span>sudo ip link set mtu <span>1500</span> up dev sl0
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Ok, so we have a “modem”, but that’s hardly a web server. To actually talk TCP/IP, we need an IP stack. There are many choices, but I went with <a href="https://github.com/adamdunkels/uip/tree/uip-0-9">uIP</a> because it’s pretty small, doesn’t require an RTOS, and it’s easy to port to other platforms.
It also, helpfully, comes with a very minimal HTTP server example.</p><p>After porting the SLIP code to use semihosting, I had a working web server…half of the time.
As with most highly optimised libraries, uIP was designed for 8 and 16-bit machines, which rarely have memory alignment requirements. On ARM however, if you dereference a <code>u16 *</code>, you better hope that address is even, or you’ll get an exception. The <code>uip_chksum</code> assumed <code>u16</code> alignment, but the script that creates the filesystem didn’t.
I actually decided to modify a bit the structure of the filesystem to make it a bit more portable.
This was my first time working with <code>perl</code> and I have to say, it’s quite well suited to this kind of task.</p><h2 id="blazingly-fast">Blazingly fast<a href="#blazingly-fast" arialabel="Anchor">#</a></h2><p>So how fast is a web server running on a disposable microcontroller. Well, initially, not very fast. Pings took ~1.5s with 50% packet loss and a simple page took over 20s to load. That’s so bad, it’s actually funny, and I kind of wanted to leave it there.</p><p>However, the problem was actually between the seat and the steering wheel the whole time. The first implementation read and wrote a single character at a time, which had a massive overhead associated with it. I previously benchmarked semihosting on this device, and I was getting ~20KiB/s, but uIP’s SLIP implementation was designed for very low memory devices, so it was serialising the data byte by byte.
We have a whopping 3kiB of RAM to play with, so I added a ring buffer to cache reads from the host and feed them into the SLIP poll function. I also split writes in batches to allow for escaping.</p><p>Now this is what I call blazingly fast! Pings now take 20ms, no packet loss and a full page loads in about 160ms. This was using using almost all of the RAM, but I could also dial down the sizes of the buffer to have more than enough headroom to run other tasks. The project repo has everything set to a nice balance latency and RAM usage:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>Memory region         Used Size  Region Size  %age Used
           FLASH:        5116 B        24 KB     20.82%
             RAM:        1380 B         3 KB     44.92%
</code></pre><p>For this blog however, I paid for none of the RAM, so I’ll use all of the RAM.</p><p>As you may have noticed, we have just under 20kiB (80%) of storage space. That may not be enough to ship all of React, but as you can see, it’s more than enough to host this entire blog post.
And this is not just a static page server, you can run any server-side code you want, if you know C that is.</p><p>Just for fun, I added a json api endpoint to get the number of requests to the main page (since the last crash) and the unique ID of the microcontroller.</p><h2 id="resources">Resources<a href="#resources" arialabel="Anchor">#</a></h2><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/BogdanTheGeek/semihost-ip">Code for this project</a></li></ul></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p><span>In the past couple of months, I published a number of articles on recreational math. I did my best to keep them accessible and fun, but my goal was usually to shed light at deeper mathematical truths. For example, the discussion of </span><a href="https://lcamtuf.substack.com/p/09999-1" rel="">0.999… = 1</a><span> served as a springboard to highlight some of the subtler properties of real numbers and the different meanings of infinity.</span></p><p><span>Today, I have no agenda. This article exists because I discovered a somewhat obscure paper that says something unexpected and cool. It </span><em>feels</em><span> profound, it probably isn’t… and if you keep reading, it’s going to live rent-free in your head too.</span></p><p>Topologists are an odd bunch: they study the continuity of geometric shapes with no regard for appearances. To them, continuous transformations — such as stretching and squeezing — are of no consequence. A donut and a drinking straw are the same because you can knead one into another without making or mending any holes.</p><p><span>Fundamentally, a topologist doesn’t care about the distance between two points in space: all that matters is a more narrow concept of local continuity. Because of this, the practitioners often choose to lean on stripped-down geometrical spaces in which the notion of distance — also known as a </span><em>metric </em><span>— is simply not defined.</span></p><p><span>That said, if you’re not a topologist, you probably enjoy being able to measure stuff. In standard Euclidean geometry with two dimensions, if we have two points that are separated by </span><em>x</em><span> horizontally and </span><em>y</em><span> vertically, the resulting straight-line distance can be calculated as:</span></p><p>One of the most common ways to construct non-Euclidean spaces is to alter the space’s metric in some way. An example that should be familiar to many software engineers is the taxicab metric, also known as the Manhattan distance. It’s named so by analogy to a cab navigating a rectangular grid of streets, charging you per mile traveled:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!_Drc!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ada872d-41dd-495e-917a-2dfdf67d4859_2332x1224.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!_Drc!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ada872d-41dd-495e-917a-2dfdf67d4859_2332x1224.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!_Drc!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ada872d-41dd-495e-917a-2dfdf67d4859_2332x1224.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!_Drc!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ada872d-41dd-495e-917a-2dfdf67d4859_2332x1224.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!_Drc!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ada872d-41dd-495e-917a-2dfdf67d4859_2332x1224.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!_Drc!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ada872d-41dd-495e-917a-2dfdf67d4859_2332x1224.png" width="1456" height="764" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/7ada872d-41dd-495e-917a-2dfdf67d4859_2332x1224.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:764,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:263113,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://lcamtuf.substack.com/i/173625523?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ada872d-41dd-495e-917a-2dfdf67d4859_2332x1224.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!_Drc!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ada872d-41dd-495e-917a-2dfdf67d4859_2332x1224.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!_Drc!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ada872d-41dd-495e-917a-2dfdf67d4859_2332x1224.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!_Drc!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ada872d-41dd-495e-917a-2dfdf67d4859_2332x1224.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!_Drc!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ada872d-41dd-495e-917a-2dfdf67d4859_2332x1224.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture></div></a><figcaption><em>An illustration of the taxicab distance.</em></figcaption></figure></div><p><span>In the taxicab universe, the distance between two points is a simple sum of the absolute distances in each axis: </span><em>d</em><sub>taxicab</sub><em> = |x| + |y|.</em><span> If we take another look at the earlier case — </span><em>d = √(x² + y²) — </em><span>it’s tempting to express the cab equation in an analogous way:</span></p><div data-component-name="Latex"><p><span>\(d_\textrm{taxicab} = \sqrt[1 \ ]{\lvert x \rvert^1 + \lvert y \rvert^1}\)</span></p></div><p>If we look at these two formulas — Euclidean and taxicab — it’s clear that we can generalize this to a whole family of related metric spaces:</p><div data-component-name="Latex"><p><span>\(d_n = \sqrt[n \ ]{\lvert x \rvert^n + \lvert y \rvert^n}\)</span></p></div><p><span>Again, the case of </span><em>n</em><span> = 1 is the taxicab universe; </span><em>n = 2</em><span> nets us the standard Euclidean space.

It’s tempting to say that each quadrant is just the diagonal of a 1×1 square (= √2), so the circumference is 4·√2. The diameter of the circle is </span><em>2</em><span>·</span><em>r</em><span> =</span><em> </em><span>2. Hence, the value of the taxicab </span><em>π</em><span> (</span><em><span>π</span><sub>1</sub></em><span>) must be 4·√2/2 ≈ 2.828.</span></p><p><span>Except… that’s a bit of a category error. We’re attempting to measure the circumference of a circle drawn in a non-Euclidean space by using the Euclidean definition of length. In the taxicab space, the diagonal of a 1×1 square is not √2; it’s a simple sum of the edges of the square.

								<p><b>Unlike most planetarium software</b>, Celestia doesn't confine you to the surface of the Earth. You can travel throughout the solar system, to any of over 100,000 stars, or even beyond the galaxy.</p>
								<p><b>All movement in Celestia is seamless</b>. The exponential zoom feature lets you explore space across a huge range of scales, from galaxy clusters down to spacecraft only a few meters across. A 'point-and-goto' interface makes it simple to navigate through the universe to the object you want to visit.</p>
								<p><b>Celestia is expandable</b>. Celestia comes with a large catalog of stars, galaxies, planets, moons, asteroids, comets, and spacecraft. If that's not enough, you can download dozens of easy to install add-ons with more objects.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Pig-butchering scams have emerged as a complex form of fraud that combines elements of romance, investment fraud, and advanced social engineering tactics to systematically exploit victims. In this paper, we present the first qualitative analysis of pig-butchering scams, informed by in-depth semi-structured interviews with $N=26$ victims. We capture nuanced, first-hand accounts from victims, providing insight into the lifecycle of pig-butchering scams and the complex emotional and financial manipulation involved. We systematically analyze each phase of the scam, revealing that perpetrators employ tactics such as staged trust-building, fraudulent financial platforms, fabricated investment returns, and repeated high-pressure tactics, all designed to exploit victims' trust and financial resources over extended periods. Our findings reveal an organized scam lifecycle characterized by emotional manipulation, staged financial exploitation, and persistent re-engagement efforts that amplify victim losses. We also find complex psychological and financial impacts on victims, including heightened vulnerability to secondary scams. Finally, we propose actionable intervention points for social media and financial platforms to curb the prevalence of these scams and highlight the need for non-stigmatizing terminology to encourage victims to report and seek assistance.

        <p>In a recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi&amp;ref=nickyoder.com" rel="noreferrer">3Blue1Brown video series</a> on transformer models, Grant Sanderson posed a fascinating question: How can a relatively modest embedding space of 12,288 dimensions (GPT-3) accommodate millions of distinct real-world concepts? </p><p>The answer lies at the intersection of high-dimensional geometry and a remarkable mathematical result known as the <a href="https://stanford.edu/class/cs114/readings/JL-Johnson.pdf?ref=nickyoder.com" rel="noreferrer">Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma</a>. While exploring this question, I discovered something unexpected that led to an interesting collaboration with Grant and a deeper understanding of vector space geometry. </p><p>The key insight begins with a simple observation: while an N-dimensional space can only hold N perfectly orthogonal vectors, relaxing this constraint to allow for "quasi-orthogonal" relationships (vectors at angles of, say, 85-95 degrees) dramatically increases the space's capacity. This property is crucial for understanding how language models can efficiently encode semantic meaning in relatively compact embedding spaces.</p><p>In Grant's video, he demonstrated this principle with an experiment attempting to fit 10,000 unit vectors into a 100-dimensional space while maintaining near-orthogonal relationships. The visualization suggested success, showing angles clustered between 89-91 degrees. However, when I implemented the code myself, I noticed something interesting about the optimization process.</p><p>The original loss function was elegantly simple: </p><div><p>               loss = (dot_products.abs()).relu().sum()</p><p>While this loss function appears perfect for an unbounded ℝᴺ space, it encounters two subtle but critical issues when applied to vectors constrained to a high-dimensional unit sphere:</p></div><ol><li><strong>The Gradient Trap</strong>: The dot product between vectors is the cosine of the angle between them, and the gradient is the sine of this angle. This creates a perverse incentive structure: when vectors approach the desired 90-degree relationship, the gradient (sin(90°) = 1.0) strongly pushes toward improvement. However, when vectors drift far from the goal (near 0° or 180°), the gradient (sin(0°) ≈ 0) vanishes—effectively trapping these badly aligned vectors in their poor configuration.</li><li><strong>The 99% Solution</strong>: The optimizer discovered a statistically favorable but geometrically perverse solution. For each vector, it would be properly orthogonal to 9,900 out of 9,999 other vectors while being nearly parallel to just 99. This configuration, while clearly not the intended outcome, actually represented a global minimum for the loss function—mathematically similar to taking 100 orthogonal basis vectors and replicating each one roughly 100 times.</li></ol><figure><img src="https://nickyoder.com/content/images/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-20-at-12.33.59-PM.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1169" height="624" srcset="https://nickyoder.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-20-at-12.33.59-PM.png 600w, https://nickyoder.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-20-at-12.33.59-PM.png 1000w, https://nickyoder.com/content/images/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-20-at-12.33.59-PM.png 1169w"></figure><p>This stable configuration was particularly insidious because it satisfied 99% of the constraints while being fundamentally different from the desired constellation of evenly spaced, quasi-orthogonal vectors. To address this, I modified the loss function to use an exponential penalty that increases aggressively as dot products grow:</p><p>               loss = exp(20*dot_products.abs()**2).sum()         (<a href="https://github.com/NickYoder86/Johnson-Lindenstrauss?ref=nickyoder.com" rel="noreferrer">Full code here</a>)</p><p>This change produced the desired behavior, though with a revealing result: the maximum achievable pairwise angle was around 76.5 degrees, not 89 degrees. </p><p>This discovery led me down a fascinating path exploring the fundamental limits of vector packing in high-dimensional spaces, and how these limits relate to the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma.</p><p>When I shared these findings with Grant, his response exemplified the collaborative spirit that makes the mathematics community so rewarding. He not only appreciated the technical correction but invited me to share these insights with the 3Blue1Brown audience. This article is that response, expanded to explore the broader implications of these geometric properties for machine learning and dimensionality reduction.</p><h2 id="the-johnson-lindenstrauss-lemma-a-geometric-guarantee">The Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma: A Geometric Guarantee</h2><p>At its core, the Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL) lemma makes a remarkable promise: you can project points from an arbitrarily high-dimensional space into a surprisingly low-dimensional space while preserving their relative distances with high probability. What makes this result particularly striking is that the required dimensionality of the low-dimensional space grows only logarithmically with the number of points you want to project.</p><p>Formally, the lemma states that for an error factor ε (between 0 and 1), and any set of N points in a high-dimensional space, there exists a projection into k dimensions where for any two points u and v in the original space, their projections f(u) and f(v) in the lower dimensional space satisfy:</p><p>(1 - ε)||u - v||² ≤ ||f(u) - f(v)||² ≤ (1 + ε)||u - v||²</p><p>The number of dimensions (k) required to guarantee these error bounds is given by:</p><p>k ≥ O(log(N)/ε²)</p><p>The "Big O" notation can be replaced with a concrete constant C:</p><p>k ≥ (C/ε²) * log(N)</p><p>Where:</p><ul><li>k is the target dimension</li><li>N is the number of points</li><li>ε is the maximum allowed distortion</li><li>C is a constant that determines the probability of success</li></ul><p>While most practitioners use values between 4 and 8 as a conservative choice for <a href="http://www.yaroslavvb.com/papers/achlioptas-database.pdf?ref=nickyoder.com" rel="noreferrer">random projections</a>, the optimal value of C remains an open question. As we'll see in the experimental section, engineered projections can achieve much lower values of C, with profound implications for embedding space capacity.</p><p>The fascinating history of this result speaks to the interconnected nature of mathematical discovery. Johnson and Lindenstrauss weren't actually trying to solve a dimensionality reduction problem – they stumbled upon this property while working on extending Lipschitz functions in Banach spaces. Their 1984 paper turned out to be far more influential in computer science than in their original domain.</p><h2 id="from-theory-to-practice-two-domains-of-application">From Theory to Practice: Two Domains of Application</h2><p>The JL lemma finds practical application in two distinct but equally important domains:</p><ol><li><strong>Dimensionality Reduction</strong>: Consider an e-commerce platform like Amazon, where each customer's preferences might be represented by a vector with millions of dimensions (one for each product). Direct computation with such vectors would be prohibitively expensive. The JL lemma tells us we can project this data into a much lower-dimensional space – perhaps just a thousand dimensions – while preserving the essential relationships between customers. This makes previously intractable computations feasible on a single GPU, enabling real-time customer relationship management and inventory planning.</li><li><strong>Embedding Space Capacity</strong>: This application is more subtle but equally powerful. Rather than actively projecting vectors, we're interested in understanding how many distinct concepts can naturally coexist in a fixed-dimensional space. This is where our experiments provide valuable insight into the practical limits of embedding space capacity.</li></ol><p>Let's consider what we mean by "concepts" in an embedding space. Language models don't deal with perfectly orthogonal relationships – real-world concepts exhibit varying degrees of similarity and difference. Consider these examples of words chosen at random:</p><ul><li>"Archery" shares some semantic space with "precision" and "sport"</li><li>"Fire" overlaps with both "heat" and "passion"</li><li>"Gelatinous" relates to physical properties and food textures</li><li>"Southern-ness" encompasses culture, geography, and dialect</li><li>"Basketball" connects to both athletics and geometry</li><li>"Green" spans color perception and environmental consciousness</li><li>"Altruistic" links moral philosophy with behavioral patterns</li></ul><p>The beauty of high-dimensional spaces is that they can accommodate these nuanced, partial relationships while maintaining useful geometric properties for computation and inference.</p><h2 id="empirical-investigation-of-embedding-capacity">Empirical Investigation of Embedding Capacity</h2><p>When we move from random projections to engineered solutions, the theoretical bounds for C of the JL lemma become surprisingly conservative. While a <a href="https://documents.uow.edu.au/~jennie/WEBPDF/175_1992.pdf?ref=nickyoder.com" rel="noreferrer">Hadamard matrix transformation</a> with random elements can reliably achieve a C value between 2.5 and 4 in a single pass, our GPU experiments suggest even more efficient arrangements are possible through optimization.</p><p>To explore these limits, I implemented a series of experiments projecting standard basis vectors into spaces of varying dimensionality. Using GPU acceleration, I tested combinations of N (number of vectors) up to 30,000 and k (embedding dimensions) up to 10,000, running each optimization for 50,000 iterations. The results reveal some fascinating patterns:</p><figure><img src="https://nickyoder.com/content/images/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-18-at-3.19.12-PM.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1316" height="262" srcset="https://nickyoder.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-18-at-3.19.12-PM.png 600w, https://nickyoder.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-18-at-3.19.12-PM.png 1000w, https://nickyoder.com/content/images/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-18-at-3.19.12-PM.png 1316w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption><span>Experimental values of C (GPU optimization)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Several key observations emerge from this data:</p><ol><li>The value of C initially rises with N, reaching a maximum around ~0.9 (notably always below 1.0)</li><li>After peaking, C begins a consistent downward trend</li><li>At high ratios of N to K, we observe C values trend below 0.2</li></ol><figure><img src="https://nickyoder.com/content/images/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-20-at-12.07.39-PM.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1164" height="624" srcset="https://nickyoder.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-20-at-12.07.39-PM.png 600w, https://nickyoder.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-20-at-12.07.39-PM.png 1000w, https://nickyoder.com/content/images/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-20-at-12.07.39-PM.png 1164w"><figcaption><span>C values for different dimensions K plotted against increasing N vectors</span></figcaption></figure><p>This behavior likely relates to an interesting property of high-dimensional geometry: as dimensionality increases, sphere packing becomes more efficient when the spheres are small relative to the unit sphere. This suggests that our observed upper bounds on C might still be conservative for very large numbers of concepts.</p><h2 id="practical-implications-for-language-models">Practical Implications for Language Models</h2><p>Let's consider three scenarios for the constant C:</p><ol><li>C = 4: A conservative choice for random projections with Hadamard matrices</li><li>C = 1: A likely upper bound for optimized or emergent embeddings</li><li>C = 0.2: A value suggested by our experiments for very large spaces</li></ol><figure><img src="https://nickyoder.com/content/images/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-20-at-1.20.34-PM.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1037" height="249" srcset="https://nickyoder.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-20-at-1.20.34-PM.png 600w, https://nickyoder.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-20-at-1.20.34-PM.png 1000w, https://nickyoder.com/content/images/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-20-at-1.20.34-PM.png 1037w"><figcaption><span>Number of possible vectors ranging from "Efficient random projection C=4" to "Optimized projection C=0.2"</span></figcaption></figure><p>The implications of these geometric properties are staggering. Let's consider a simple way to estimate how many quasi-orthogonal vectors can fit in a k-dimensional space. If we define F as the degrees of freedom from orthogonality (90° - desired angle), we can approximate the number of vectors as:</p><p>Vectors ≈ 10^(k * F² / 1500)</p><p>where:</p><ul><li>k is the embedding dimension</li><li>F is the degrees of "freedom" from orthogonality (e.g., F = 3 for 87° angles)</li></ul><p>Applying this to GPT-3's 12,288-dimensional embedding space reveals its extraordinary capacity:</p><ul><li>At 89° (F = 1): approximately 10^8 vectors</li><li>At 88° (F = 2): approximately 10^32 vectors</li><li>At 87° (F = 3): approximately 10^73 vectors</li><li>At 85° (F = 5): more than 10^200 vectors</li></ul><p>To put this in perspective, even the conservative case of 86° angles provides capacity far exceeding the estimated number of atoms in the observable universe (~10^80). This helps explain how language models can maintain rich, nuanced relationships between millions of concepts while working in relatively modest embedding dimensions.</p><h2 id="practical-applications-and-future-directions">Practical Applications and Future Directions</h2><p>The insights from this investigation have two major practical implications:</p><ol><li><strong>Efficient Dimensionality Reduction</strong>: The robustness of random projections, particularly when combined with Hadamard transformations (or <a href="https://www.ece.unb.ca/tervo/ece4253/bch.shtml?ref=nickyoder.com" rel="noreferrer">BCH coding</a>), provides a computationally efficient way to work with high-dimensional data. No complex optimization required – the mathematics of high-dimensional spaces does the heavy lifting for us.</li><li><strong>Embedding Space Design</strong>: Understanding the true capacity of high-dimensional spaces helps explain how transformer models can maintain rich, nuanced representations of language in relatively compact embeddings. Concepts like "Canadian," "morose," "Hitchcockian," "handsome," "whimsical," and "Muppet-like" can all find their place in the geometry while preserving their subtle relationships to each other.</li></ol><p>This research suggests that current embedding dimensions (1,000-20,000) provide more than adequate capacity for representing human knowledge and reasoning. The challenge lies not in the capacity of these spaces but in learning the optimal arrangement of concepts within them.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/NickYoder86/Johnson-Lindenstrauss?ref=nickyoder.com" rel="noreferrer">My code for Hadamard and optimized projections</a>.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>What began as an investigation into a subtle optimization issue has led us to a deeper appreciation of high-dimensional geometry and its role in modern machine learning. The Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma, discovered in a different context nearly four decades ago, continues to provide insight into the foundations of how we can represent meaning in mathematical spaces.</p><p>I want to express my sincere gratitude to Grant Sanderson and the 3Blue1Brown channel.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>  <p>I was recently working on a project that uses the <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js-v3">AWS SDK for JavaScript</a>. When updating the dependencies in said project, I noticed that the version of that dependency was <code>v3.888.0</code>. Eight hundred eighty eight. That’s a big number as far as versions go.</p>
<p>That got me thinking: I wonder what package in the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npm registry</a> has the largest number in its version. It could be a major, minor, or patch version, and it doesn’t have to be the latest version of the package. In other words, out of the three numbers in <code>&lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;.&lt;patch&gt;</code> for each version for each package, what is the largest number I can find?</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR? <a href="#results">Jump to the results</a></strong> to see the answer.</p>
<section data-heading-rank="2"><h2 id="the-npm-api">The npm API</h2>
<p>Obviously npm has some kind of API, so it shouldn’t be too hard to get a list of all… <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/#:~:text=Packages-,3%2C639%2C812,-Downloads%20%C2%B7%20Last">3,639,812 packages</a>. Oh. That’s a lot of packages. Well, considering npm had 374 <em>billion</em> package downloads in the past <em>month</em>, I’m sure they wouldn’t mind me making a few million HTTP requests.</p>
<p>Doing a quick search for “npm api” leads me to a readme in the <a href="https://github.com/npm/registry/blob/main/docs/REGISTRY-API.md">npm/registry repo</a> on GitHub. There’s a <code>/-/all</code> endpoint listed in the table of contents which seems promising. That section doesn’t actually exist in the readme, but maybe it still works?</p>
<div><figure><pre data-language="sh"><code><div><p><span>$</span><span> </span><span>curl</span><span> </span><span>'https://registry.npmjs.org/-/all'</span></p></div><div><p><span>{</span><span>"code"</span><span>:</span><span>"ResourceNotFound"</span><span>,</span><span>"message"</span><span>:</span><span>"/-/all does not exist"</span><span>}</span></p></div></code></pre></figure></div>
<p>Whelp, maybe npm packages have an ID and I can just start at 1 and count up? It looks like packages have an <code>_id</code> field… never mind, the <code>_id</code> field is the package <em>name</em>. Okay, let’s try to find something else.</p>
<p>A little more digging brings me to this <a href="https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/152515">GitHub discussion</a> about the npm replication API. So npm replicates package info in CouchDB at <code>https://replicate.npmjs.com</code>, and conveniently, they support the <a href="https://docs.couchdb.org/en/stable/api/database/bulk-api.html#db-all-docs"><code>_all_docs</code> endpoint</a>. Let’s give that a try:</p>

<p>Those are some interesting package names. Looks like this data is paginated and by default I get 1,000 packages at a time. When I write the final script, I can set the <code>limit</code> query parameter to the max of 10,000 to make pagination a little less painful.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the CouchDB docs have a <a href="https://docs.couchdb.org/en/latest/ddocs/views/pagination.html#paging">guide for pagination</a>, and it looks like it’s as simple as using the <code>skip</code> query parameter.</p>
<div><figure><pre data-language="sh"><code><div><p><span>$</span><span> </span><span>curl</span><span> </span><span>'https://replicate.npmjs.com/registry/_all_docs?skip=1000'</span></p></div><div><p><span>"Bad Request"</span></p></div></code></pre></figure></div>
<p>Never mind. According to the GitHub discussion linked above, <code>skip</code> is no longer supported. The “Paging (Alternate Method)” section of the same page says that I can use <code>startkey_docid</code> instead. If I grab the <code>id</code> of the last row, I should be able to use that to return the next set of rows. Fun fact: The 1000th package (alphabetically) on npm is <code>03-webpack-number-test</code>.</p>
<div><figure><pre data-language="sh"><code><div><p><span>$</span><span> </span><span>curl</span><span> </span><span>'https://replicate.npmjs.com/registry/_all_docs?startkey_docid="03-webpack-number-test"'</span></p></div><div><p><span>{</span></p></div><div><p><span>    </span><span>"total_rows"</span><span> </span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>3628102,</span></p></div><div><p><span>    </span><span>"offset"</span><span> </span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>999,</span></p></div><div><p><span>    </span><span>"rows"</span><span> </span><span>:</span><span> [</span></p></div><div><p><span>    </span><span># another 1000 packages...</span></p></div></code></pre></figure></div>
<p>Nice. Also, another <code>3628102 - 3628088 = 14</code> packages have been published in the ~15 minutes since I ran the last query.</p>
<p>Now, there’s one more piece of the puzzle to figure out. How do I get all the versions for a given package? Unfortunately, it doesn’t seem like I can get package version information along with the base info returned by <code>_all_docs</code>. I have to <em>separately</em> fetch each package’s metadata from <code>https://registry.npmjs.org/&lt;package_id&gt;</code>. Let’s see what good ol’ trusty <code>03-webpack-number-test</code> looks like:</p>
<div><figure><pre data-language="sh"><code><div><p><span>$</span><span> </span><span>curl</span><span> </span><span>'https://registry.npmjs.org/03-webpack-number-test'</span></p></div><div><p><span>{</span></p></div><div><p><span>    </span><span># i've omitted some fields here</span></p></div><div><p><span>    </span><span>"_id"</span><span> </span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"03-webpack-number-test",</span></p></div><div><p><span>    </span><span>"versions"</span><span> </span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span></p></div><div><p><span>      </span><span>"1.0.0"</span><span> </span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>...</span><span> </span><span>},</span></p></div><div><p><span>      </span><span># the rest of the versions...</span></p></div></code></pre></figure></div>
<p>Alright, I have everything I need. Now I just need to write a bash script that— just kidding. A wise programmer once said, “if your shell script is more than 10 lines, it shouldn’t be a shell script” (that was me, I said that). I like TypeScript, so let’s use that.</p>
<p>The biggest bottleneck is going to be waiting on the <code>GET</code>s for each package’s metadata. My plan is this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Grab all the package IDs from the replication API and save that data to a file (I don’t want to have to refetch everything if the something goes wrong later in the script)</li>
<li>Fetch package data in batches so we’re not just doing 1 HTTP request at a time</li>
<li>Save the package data to a file (again, hopefully I only have to fetch everything once)</li>
</ul>
<p>Once I have all the package data, I can answer the original question of “largest number in version” and look at a few other interesting things.</p>
<p>(A few hours and many iterations later…)</p>

<p>Some stats:</p>

<li>Time to fetch version data for each one of those packages: <strong>~12 hours</strong> (yikes)</li>

<li>Size of <code>package-data.json</code>: <strong>~886MB</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>And the winner is…</strong> (not really) <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/latentflip-test?activeTab=versions">latentflip-test</a> at version <code>1000000000000000000.1000000000000000000.1000000000000000000</code>. And no, there haven’t actually been one quintillion major versions of this package published. Disappointing, I know.</p>
<p>Okay, I feel like that shouldn’t count. I think we can do better and find a “real” package that actually follows semantic versioning. I think a better question to ask is this:</p>
<p><strong>For packages that <em>follow semantic versioning</em>, which package has the <em>largest number</em> from <code>&lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;.&lt;patch&gt;</code> in <em>any</em> of its versions?</strong></p>
<p>So, what does it mean to “follow semantic versioning”? Should we “disqualify” a package for skipping a version number? In this case, I think we’ll just say that a package has to have more versions published than the largest number we find for that package. For example, a package with a version of <code>1.888.0</code> will have had <em>at least</em> 888 versions published if it actually followed semver.</p>
<p>Before we get to the real winner, here are the top 10 packages <em>by total number of versions published</em>:</p>
<div><figure><pre data-language="plaintext"><code><div><p><span>electron-remote-control -&gt; 37328 total versions</span></p></div><div><p><span>@npm-torg/public-scoped-free-org-test-package-2 -&gt; 37134 total versions</span></p></div><div><p><span>public-unscoped-test-package -&gt; 27719 total versions</span></p></div><div><p><span>carrot-scan -&gt; 27708 total versions</span></p></div><div><p><span>@npm-torg/public-test-package-2 -&gt; 27406 total versions</span></p></div><div><p><span>@octopusdeploy/design-system-components -&gt; 26724 total versions</span></p></div><div><p><span>@octopusdeploy/type-utils -&gt; 26708 total versions</span></p></div><div><p><span>@octopusdeploy/design-system-tokens -&gt; 22122 total versions</span></p></div><div><p><span>@mahdiarjangi/phetch-cli -&gt; 19498 total versions</span></p></div><div><p><span>@atlassian-test-prod/hello-world -&gt; 19120 total versions</span></p></div></code></pre></figure></div>
<p>Top 10 packages that (probably) follow semver <em>by largest number in one of its versions</em>:</p>
<div><figure><pre data-language="plaintext"><code><div><p><span>@mahdiarjangi/phetch-cli -&gt; 19494 (1.0.19494)</span></p></div><div><p><span>electron-remote-control -&gt; 19065 (1.2.19065)</span></p></div><div><p><span>@quip/collab -&gt; 16999 (1.16999.0)</span></p></div><div><p><span>@atlassian-test-prod/hello-world -&gt; 16707 (9.7.16707)</span></p></div><div><p><span>@wix/wix-code-types -&gt; 14720 (2.0.14720)</span></p></div><div><p><span>@octopusdeploy/design-system-components -&gt; 14274 (2025.3.14274)</span></p></div><div><p><span>@octopusdeploy/type-utils -&gt; 14274 (2025.3.14274)</span></p></div><div><p><span>@octopusdeploy/design-system-tokens -&gt; 14274 (2025.3.14274)</span></p></div><div><p><span>@atlassian-test-staging/test -&gt; 13214 (49.4.13214)</span></p></div><div><p><span>binky -&gt; 9906 (3.4.9906)</span></p></div></code></pre></figure></div>
<p>So it seems like the winner is <a href="https://github.com/DinoscapeProgramming/Remote-Control">@mahdiarjangi/phetch-cli</a> with <code>19494</code>, right? Unfortunately, I’m not going to count that either. It only has so many versions because of a <a href="https://github.com/arjangimahdi/phetch-cli/actions/runs/11531682007/workflow">misconfigured GitHub action</a> that published new versions in a loop.</p>
<p>I manually went down the above list, disqualifying any packages that had similar issues. I also checked that “new” versions actually differed from previous versions in terms of content. Overall, I looked for a package that was actually publishing new versions on purpose with <em>some</em> kind of change to the package content.</p>
<p><strong>The real winner (#19 on the list) is:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/nice-registry/all-the-package-names">all-the-package-names</a> with <code>2401</code> from version <code>2.0.2401</code>.</p>
<p>Well, that’s sort of disappointing, but also kind of funny. I don’t know what I was expecting to be honest. If you’re curious, you can see <a href="#more-results">more results</a> at the bottom of this post.</p>
<p>What you do with all of this extremely important and useful information is up to you.</p>
