        <div itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>Last week, I had a fascinating conversation with a reader around frustration and unhappiness at work. Much of it was totally obvious to both of us, but it occurred to me that this probably <em>isn't</em> to everyone, which is why almost all of my colleagues (in very cushy, non-stressful jobs) nonetheless need therapy. And if it isn't obvious to everyone, it's worth writing about.</p>
<p>I now believe that this stems from a failure to recognize the gap, frequently vast, between what is being <em>said</em> by a person and what is being felt, and how this discrepancy applies to organizations too.</p>
<p>It was sparked by reference to a concept called the <em>honne-tatemae</em> divide, which are Japanese concepts related to the true feelings of an individual and the front they present in public. I don't actually know anything about the Japanese context beyond this one Wikipedia article, so this has been dropped entirely so that I seem worldly and to give us vocabulary less onerous than "what you really think" and "what you're forced to say".</p>
<h2 id="i-tatemae">I. Tatemae</h2>
<p>I have never met a single manager at any large company that has not said they want to be <em>data driven</em>. I have also never seen a single one of them take any steps that could actually move them in this direction.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the average annual salary for a Power BI developer places them in the 90th percentile of my country's annual income. For those of you unfamiliar with Power BI, you connect it to data sources and then it makes visualizations for managers to gawk at, and it is so simple to use that it is not inconceivable to me that you could <em>actually</em> train a monkey to make a bar chart with the correct application of positive reinforcement and peanuts.</p>
<p>There are a handful of people who do amazing things in Power BI, but the hard truth is that most people who work in it are <em>really</em> just dragging-and-dropping bar charts onto a page after connecting it to a spreadsheet, being paid absolutely exorbitantly, and then if they're smart, going home and despairing. This is because Power BI tracks usage metrics and almost all dashboards are completely unused.</p>
<p>My current organization has 8000 staff members, and I used to glance over the usage metrics of the dashboards my old team produced. I believe three dashboards were used, out of somewhere around 50 - 100. Of those being visited, it usually turned out they were being visited by members of our team checking to see if the data had refreshed for the day. I'd estimate the cost of maintaining our team was approximately $1,000,000, for an organization that supposedly can't afford to waste that money.</p>
<p><em>Why?</em></p>
<p>Management has no choice but to say that they want to be data driven. It's not like they can just come out and <em>say</em> that it's all fucked - so they say the only thing that is available. We are going through a "digital transformation", and that is why all of these efforts don't generate any revenue and drive staff to misery. It will be better once this current initiative successfully completes, even though we have never demonstrated the ability to successfully complete a similar initiative at any point in the past.</p>
<h2 id="ii-honne">II. Honne</h2>
<p>There are two pressures that drive the garbled stream of corporate of nonsense at organizations.</p>
<h2 id="i-sturgeons-law">I. Sturgeon's Law</h2>
<p>The first one is <em>very</em> simple, and I sometimes lose sight of it while I'm deep in the theory mines of incentives and other smarter takes. 90% of everything is crud, and that explains almost everything. Most managers have never had an independent thought on how to manage people effectively (hence the Agile parroting), most programmers don't know what an abstraction is, etc, etc. This is the <em>overwhelming</em> factor even though it isn't a satisfying answer, but it has done more for my own peace of mind than anything that follows.</p>
<p>I used to be pretty good on the fencing circuit - as in, olympic fencing, with the swords. It never occurred to me <em>for even a goddamn second</em> that we could win competitions without having good, smart people that understood the sport and trained hard. If we lose because Derek didn't turn up to practice for six months, I might be pissed off and upset, but I am not <em>spiritually confused</em> about why my efforts aren't rewarding me.</p>
<p>I have no idea what possesses us to turn up at work and think that we can accomplish anything with fucking Derek over there calling the shots while slamming their empty head onto a keyboard as rapidly as Jira will allow him to create cards we won't finish, but for some reason it's a thing that happens.</p>
<p>Derek will repeat whatever brain-dead thing is in vogue but they are <em>very stupid</em> and will repeat literally anything that sounds popular, plus will never question that they have never had an unambiguous success over their entire career. This means they will inevitably become promoted over time, because unlike the rest of us who have to put in <em>effort</em> and pay what a friend of mine terms <em>soul cost</em> to act like a sycophant, they believe it sincerely.</p>
<h2 id="ii-sturgeons-law-again">II. Sturgeon's Law Again</h2>
<p>Here's the pressure if you're in the 10% of people that aren't crud at their jobs - you're surrounded by people that <em>are</em> crud.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong - I <em>am</em> that terrible person at many things. There are fencing teams where I'd be absolute dead weight. My piano playing leaves much to be desired. Last week, I managed to stub the little toe on both feet, on the same day, on two separate occasions, and I have on at least one occasion absentmindedly dropped a teaspoon into the trash instead of a tea bag.</p>
<p>However I don't do any of that professionally. In professional settings, approximately <em>all</em> of my time goes into solving problems introduced by people that are just indescribably bad.</p>
<p>I work on a platform that cost my organization an eye-watering sum of money to produce, over the span of two years, and the engineers responsible for it elected to use spreadsheets to control the infrastructure, so we now have a spreadsheet with 400 separate worksheets that powers but one part of this whole shambling mess.</p>
<p>Can you imagine the kind of havoc such people could wreak upon infrastructure and code if left unchecked?</p>
<p>Is there <em>any</em> chance a team with people like that is going to produce good results? Obviously not. Do most teams at large organizations have at least one person like that? Sweet merciful Christ, in both my first, second, and perhaps even third-hand experience, whatever that means, it's possible that <em>half of all teams consist entirely of that person</em>.</p>
<p>Can my manager keep their job if they honestly say "There is no chance this team will ever hit its objectives"? <em>Fuck</em> no, if they did that they'd be <em>gone</em>, so the system is constantly selecting for people that are either too dumb to realize it's hopeless, too perversely incentivized to be honest, or too deep into despair to <em>admit to themselves</em> it is hopeless.</p>
<h2 id="iii-ignoring-is-bliss">III. Ignoring Is Bliss</h2>
<p>From the Tao of Programming:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A novice asked the Master: "In the East, there is a great tree-structure that men call 'Corporate Headquarters'. It is bloated out of shape with vice presidents and accountants. It issues a multitude of memos, each saying 'Go Hence!' or 'Go Hither!' and nobody knows what is meant. Every year new names are put onto the branches, but all to no avail. How can such an unnatural entity exist?"</p>
<p>The Master replied: "You perceive this immense structure and are disturbed that it has no rational purpose. Can you not take amusement from its endless gyrations? Do you not enjoy the untroubled ease of programming beneath its sheltering branches? Why are you bothered by its uselessness?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I quote the above because it is very funny, and because the only thing that has brought me clarity is totally ignoring anything management says unless I have a very good reason to believe the person I am speaking to has intelligence, integrity, <em>and</em> has come to terms with the fact that large organizations are inherently dysfunctional, which happens rarely.</p>
<p>I have a friend that was denied a raise after working at a company diligently for five years - there was no budget, he was told. He was upset, and ended up spending a year traveling the world on sabbatical.</p>
<p>While he was away, a new position opened up in the same department, for the same job title - it was a permanent role, theoretically exactly the same job he was doing in an identical team with the same managers. They gave me that job, all the money he asked for, plus another hefty sum on top of it.</p>
<p>Management saying there was no budget <em>meant nothing</em> - it is purely a thing they are forced to say, and if the person saying it was not particularly insightful, they even believed it. The <em>only</em> thing an organization can do that means <em>anything</em> is actually solving your problem, and <em>any</em> words to the effect of "we'll address your concerns soon" or "we just need to do some planning around this", etc, should just be ignored wholesale.</p>
<p>These days, I ignore everything they've said about salary (I just state a number and don't budge, and they usually just give me what I want despite saying it was impossible), I ignore everything they say around work culture and the teams they want to build (I don't factor it into my decisions around whether it's a team I'd like to join because I know it isn't trustworthy), and frankly, sometimes I just ignore them because fuck 'em, why not?</p>
<p>Similarly, I let them talk as much as they want about work culture or whatever. These are the endless gyrations of the great tree structure, rustling in the wind. Actually <em>remove</em> the staff that no one works to work with or who terrorize their subordinates and I'll know you're serious about performance. Reward people for staying, and I'll know you're serious about valuing people. Anything short of that is less than worthless, because you've wasted valuable time I could have been listening to music.</p>
<p>It's much more peaceful to solve a few problems, not waste a single iota of my energy on creating systemic change unless we're going to try curing cancer, then log off to touch grass. Realizing that no mere <em>words</em> can demonstrate an appetite for true change was necessary for me to make that change in my life - hopefully it does the same for someone else.</p>

<p dir="auto">This project covers two intertwined use cases:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Continuous and regular dumps of one or all <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/" rel="nofollow">PostgreSQL</a> databases at a given
host in a format that permits recovery in case of disasters.  This is
<code>backup.sh</code>.</li>
<li>Continuous and regular copying of these dumps in a compressed form to a
(supposedly) remote directory in order to facilitate offsite backup and
recovery in case of disasters. This is <code>offsite.sh</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">The project is tuned for usage within a Dockerised environment and each tool
described below performs only one backup or compression.  Typical scenarios will
periodically restart containers based on this image using a host-wide cron-like
daemon such as <a href="https://github.com/efrecon/dockron">dockron</a>.</p>

<p dir="auto">An example <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/" rel="nofollow">compose</a> file is provided as a plausible real-life scenario.  The
file <code>docker-compose.yml</code> starts up the following containers:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li><code>db</code>, an instance of the PostgreSQL database.</li>
<li><code>pgbackup</code>, which runs <code>backup.sh</code> once and will perform a backup of all
databases when it starts.</li>
<li><code>davbackup</code>, which runs <code>offsite.sh</code> once and will copy the latest backup to
another volume in compressed form. This could be a WebDAV mounted volume,
even though it isn't since this is just an example.</li>
<li><code>pulse</code>, runs an instance of <code>efrecon/dockron</code> and will restart the two
previous containers from time to time so they can regularly perform their
operations.</li>

</article><h2>A
religious offering?</h2><p>Archaeologists
have found five gold foil figures in the last couple of weeks.</p><p>Three of
them were found where the wall of the temple once
stood. Two of them were found in separate post holes.</p><p>Finding a gold
foil figure is spectacular and rare in itself. But the five gold foil figures that
were found at Hov this time offer something extra: They were found and
excavated where they were most likely originally placed. Knowing where something
was once placed helps archaeologists understand more.</p><p>“It’s extra
special that we can link the gold foil figures to the various parts of the
building's construction,” Stene says.</p><p>The many gold
foil figures found here earlier were discovered in and around another post hole
in the old temple, on the opposite side of the two that recently appeared.</p><p> It's possible that some of the gold foil figures they found here earlier were also placed in the wall, but there's uncertainty about exactly where they were once found. Now, with these three that we found under the actual structure of the wall, it's clear that they were intentionally placed there before the wall's construction," Stene says.</p><p data-lab-font_weight="font-weight-normal">One of the
theories about what the gold foil figures were used for is that they may have
served as a form of <span data-lab-font_weight="font-weight-normal">admission ticket</span> to a temple like the one that once stood here at Hov. </p>
<p>But an admission ticket doesn’t lie under a wall.</p><p data-lab-font_weight="font-weight-normal">“Modern
excavation has provided more knowledge about this,” Stene says. “The gold foil
figures in the post hole were not visible to people. Those we found in the wall
would also not have been visible to others. So this doesn't appear to be an admission ticket, but rather an offering or a religious act to protect the building."</p><figure data-element-guid="58a219f5-cf93-409e-8b56-de3378926276">

<h2>A small,
but prominent pagan temple</h2><p>The temple at
Hov was discovered by pure chance in 1993. County conservator Harald Jacobsen drove
along the E6 and noticed the soil. He thought it looked like what
archaeologists call cultural layers, meaning soil where traces of humans are
found. A small investigation proved that he was right, and the finding of two gold
foil figures indicated that this was no ordinary place.</p>



<!-- placeholder(#1) -->


<p data-lab-font_weight="font-weight-normal">Smaller
excavations during the 2000s led to the discovery of 28 gold foil figures, and
what is referred to as a temple, a house for pagan religious practices.</p><p>One of the
reasons archaeologists believe this was a temple, besides the gold foil figures,
is the absence of other finds that would be natural if people lived there, like
cooking pots and whetstones.&nbsp;</p><p>A proper
excavation of the area had to wait until this year, in connection with the E6
Roterud-Storhove road project. Throughout the autumn and winter, C14 dating
will finally determine if it is true that the temple has stood here since
around the year 600 – and right up to the 11th century.</p><p>“Based on what we have interpreted as post holes, it's not unreasonable to think that a building has stood here that has looked the same for several hundred years. That's not a problem, as long as you maintain the building by
replacing the load-bearing posts as they rot,” Stene says. </p><p>With its
15–16 metres in length, the house is small. Residential homes of the time could
easily be 20-30 metres long.</p><p data-lab-font_weight="font-weight-normal">“Because it’s
relatively small, we believe the structure served a solely ritualistic function,” says
Stene. “It probably wasn't where they had their feasts. Those were likely held in a larger hall, but maybe they had drinking ceremonies here. Maybe it was just the select circle in society, the elite, who were allowed to enter."</p><p data-lab-font_weight="font-weight-normal">The&nbsp;archaeologists also believe the building was fairly tall.&nbsp;</p><p>“It
probably stood out in the landscape. If you came to Mjøsa by boat, it was
probably clearly visible,” Stene says. </p><figure data-element-guid="de9f3460-1756-4414-a618-5c61db98a1ed">

</article><h2>Gold foil
figures in buildings</h2><p>Ingunn
Marit Røstad, archaeologist at the Museum of Cultural History in Oslo, is an expert on the
Merovingian period in Norway and gold foil figures. She also believes there are
more gold foil figures out there.</p><p data-lab-font_weight="font-weight-normal">“Bornholm
is very special, even in Denmark. There aren't that many other find sites
there,” Røstad points out.</p><p data-lab-font_weight="font-weight-normal">There are
also other regional differences: In Denmark, there are more individual
figures, whereas in Norway and Sweden, it is mostly couples that are
depicted. </p><p>“But more of these small pieces of gold keep appearing. Either through excavation or with metal detectors. So, more
could pop up in various places in Norway as well,” she says.</p><p>Due to the continuous new finds, the number of gold foil figures must be regularly updated. The latest numbers Røstad has from 2019 indicate that a total of 3,243 gold foil figures
have been found in Scandinavia – 2,708 of them on Bornholm.</p><p>Røstad also
points out that what’s especially unique about the new gold foil figures from
Hov is that they were found in the ground, where they lay. Archaeologists call
it context – the place where something is found is part of the story.</p><p>“Of all the
thousands of gold foil figures we have, only a few have been found on-site and
excavated,” Røstad says. “So, it’s extremely valuable that we get good context
for the finds from Hov.”</p><p data-lab-font_weight="font-weight-normal">What stands
out when gold foil figures are actually excavated – as opposed to just being randomly
found in a field – is that archaeologists find them in association with
buildings.</p><figure data-element-guid="584a4b0f-0a19-41ae-b357-e844b875ddc5">

<h2>Pictures
of the elite</h2><p>Røstad does
not place much stock in the theory that the gold foil figures were admission tickets to the temple.</p><p data-lab-font_weight="font-weight-normal">They do not
have holes suggesting that they were sewn onto clothing, and apart from a few
exceptions from Bornholm, they do not have&nbsp;fastenings suggesting
they are jewellery.</p><p>They are
dated to the Merovingian period due to the style of clothing and jewellery depicted
on the men and women. </p><p data-lab-font_weight="font-weight-normal">“People assume
that they’re showing the elite’s clothing during this period,” Røstad says. “A
sort of idealised depiction of elite clothing, featuring the elaborate hairstyle
that the women have with a distinctive knot. You also see beads, special types of brooches, drinking cups, and drinking horns, which date them to the Merovingian
period.”</p><p data-lab-font_weight="font-weight-normal">A common
interpretation of the gold foil figures is that they have some sort of ritual
significance. Many believe that the couple depicted is the god Frøy and the goddess Gerd. Perhaps the gold foil figures were part of a symbolic act
when people celebrated weddings?</p><figure data-element-guid="53d29dd6-915a-47cf-b8db-a61d421a19e3">

<h2>Of divine
lineage?</h2><p>Another
interpretation deals with the idea that the most powerful families of this time
claimed they could trace their lineage back to the gods, and that the gold foil
figures in some way signaled that they were of divine lineage.</p><p data-lab-font_weight="font-weight-normal">“This was
used to legitimise ruling; you were a leading family because you were descended
from the gods,” Røstad says. “Even though they’re tiny, the gold foil figures could
have been very significant. Not as jewellery worn visibly to show status, but
perhaps they were part of some kind of ritual placement at the high seat
where the king or jarl sat.” </p><p>The first gold
foil figures were found in 1725. In a text from 1791, they were referred to as ‘gullgubber’
(golden old men), and the name just stuck. Even though the vast majority of them actually depict both a man and a woman.</p><p>———</p><p>Translated by Alette Bjordal Gjellesvik.</p><p><a href="https://forskning.no/arkeologi/gullskatt-funnet-utenfor-lillehammer-blir-ikke-stort-mer-spektakulaert-enn-dette/2252591">Read

			Have you ever wanted to test (from the command line) whether a port on another machine can be reached from yours? When some app of your can't seem to connect to a given port, you may want to test things from the command line. (The problem may be that the service using that port has stopped or is blocked by a firewall--it may be that you're mistaken in the port you are trying to use, or perhaps even the ip address, domain name, or machine name.)    </p><p>
There are in fact many tools which can help with this task, some of which will be familiar to those on *nix systems, but Windows users who've been around a while (or who learned from such folks) may try to rely on the good ol' telnet command (as in <i>telnet <machine> <port></port></machine></i>). Unfortunately, they often find out how <b>Microsoft has disabled that tool by default for over a decade</b> (since Windows Vista), and while it <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/enable-telnet-windows/">can be easily enabled</a>, they may be prevented or understandably reluctant to do that.    </p><p>
In this post, I want to show a couple of command-line alternatives which can do the job easily, <b>one best suited for powershell users (Test-NetConnection)</b>, and and two of which would suit those who prefer the command line (cmd) and which are now built-into Windows (the past few years): <b>ssh and curl</b>. No, this is not their primary job but they will suit for this task and it may surprise some to learn they're even built-in options. I'll conclude with still other options available to those on *nix environments (who of course can also use ssh and curl), especially nc (netcat). </p><p> Topics:  </p><ul>  <li><a href="https://www.carehart.org/blog/2023/10/1/ps">Option 1) Powershell's nifty Test-NetConnection</a></li><a href="https://www.carehart.org/blog/2023/10/1/ps">  </a><li><a href="https://www.carehart.org/blog/2023/10/1/ps"></a><a href="#win">Yes, Windows has included ssh and curl for a few years!</a></li>  <li><a href="#curl">Option 2) Using curl to test connectivity to a port</a>, including how the curl command responds if the port CANNOT or CAN be reached</li>  <li><a href="#ssh">Option 3) Using ssh to test connectivity to a port</a>, including how that command responds in those cases</li>  <li><a href="#other">Using other cli tools on Linux, Unix, MacOS</a></li>  <li><a href="#why">On understanding WHY the port being checked could not be reached</a></li>  </ul>    <h2 id="ps">Option 1) Powershell's nifty Test-NetConnection</h2>    <p>
<b>Update:</b> this first section has been added since my original post. Thanks to Mark Gregory for <a href="https://www.carehart.org/blog/2023/10/1/testing_port_reachability_with_other_than_telnet#c3D1D347A-C432-43A4-B9FC06F0CDF4EB1A">his kind comment suggesting it</a>.    </p><p>
If you're a powershell user (or are ok using it, even if you favor still using the traditional Windows CMD for the command line), there's a nice cmdlet that can do this task of testing a connection to a port, Test-NetConnection, as in:    </p><p>Test-NetConnection <span>&lt;machine&gt;</span> -port <span>&lt;port&gt;</span></p>    <p>
Of course, <i>machine</i> can be an ip address, domain name, machine name, etc., and it need not be a machine other than yours: it can be your own.      </p><p>
So for instance, someone might test if their SQL Server was reachable on the machine "dbserver" at port 1433 using:    </p><p>Test-NetConnection dbserver -port 1433</p>    <p>
The UI of the tool will appear as it tries to connect, and regardless of its results, in the end it will report true or false, as in:  </p><p>Response includes TcpTestSucceeded: True</p>    <p>
For some readers, that's really all you need to hear and you can stop. For those interested to learn more (who may want to propose other alternatives), please do read on.    </p><h2>What about the long delay if the port is NOT open</h2>    <p>
You may notice that this Test-NetConnection cmdlet will hang if the port on the machine trying to be reached is not available. That hang-time is as much about your a TCP timeout set at the OS level for your machine (from which you're running the test.) I discuss this more later with regard to curl and ssh (which offer options to override that timeout).    </p><p>
Sadly, at this writing, there's no option to override that timeout for Test-NetConnection. (Others have noticed and raised the concern. See <a href="https://copdips.com/2019/09/fast-tcp-port-check-in-powershell.html">this post</a> for a couple of powershell approaches addressing this issue.)    </p><h2>Other ways do exist to test connectivity to such specific apps</h2>    <p>
<b>Update:</b> I previously had these few paragraphs in the next section, but I am moving them up to here because they're natural questions following the example I've offered, which I also use for the other variants below.    </p><p>
And yes, I'm well aware that there are other means by which one could test connectivity to something like SQL Server (or mysql or redis, etc.) from the commandline, using dedicated tools offered for each. The point of this post was to present approaches that works with ANY service whose port accessibility you're checking.    </p><p>
Finally, I'm also aware that there are other ways to find what ports are open on a given machine (port scanning tools) as well as whether and what ports are open on your machine, such as via good ol' netstat or UI tools like curports, to the more modern tool built into Windows (since Vista) called Resource Monitor. The focus here is again on a cli approach to test the accessibility of a port on any machine--versus finding if its one of many open ports, valuable though that info may be.    </p><p>
Anyway, moving on, for those who may still favor CMD (the command prompt) over powershell, you won't find it offering that nifty Test-NetConnection (though again you can call powershell commands from cmd). Instead, you may find some comfort in using curl or ssh, instead, which are covered in the remainder of this post.     </p><h2 id="win">Yes, Windows has included ssh and curl for a few years!</h2>    <p>
So as for ssh and curl, let me point out first some news which may have been missed by many (including those who try to help others or who write about IT matters). You don't NEED to "install putty" anymore: <b><u>Windows has included ssh (an openssh client) for a few years, since later versions of Windows 10 and Server 2019</u></b>.  And the same is true of curl (a command-line browser).    </p><p>
If you want to confirm this, just open a Windows command prompt and type ssh (it should be found within your Windows path, and so should run), which will return brief help for the command. Same with curl!    </p><p>
Now granted, I realize that using curl or ssh to test the availability of a port (especially on another server) is not the real purpose of those tools--any more than it was the purpose of telnet. But the point is that these generally do "work" well, so they're  tools to consider for one's arsenal. And again, I'll cover other tools that you may be able to obtain or find in some Linux distros (or MacOS or Unix) at the end of this post.    </p><p>
Considering also that you find either curl or ssh to suit you better for some situations, I will discuss them both. And I could have presented either one first. I offer curl first as some may be more comfortable with that, if they don't have much experience with ssh. Again the key point is that both these tools should be available to everyone reading this, unless they're on very old deployments of Windows.    </p><h2 id="curl">Option 2) Using curl to test connectivity to a port</h2>    <p>
So let's look first at using curl to test if a port can be reached (though really, I'd recommend option 1 above or option 3 below, for reasons which will become clear):    </p><p>curl <span>&lt;machine&gt;</span>:<span>&lt;port&gt;</span></p>    <p>
Note there's a colon between the machine and the port.  Again, <i>machine</i> could be an ip address, domain name, machine name, etc.     </p><p>
So for instance, someone might test if their SQL Server was reachable on the machine "dbserver" at port 1433 using:    </p><p>curl dbserver:1433</p>    <p>
So let's talk about what one may see depending on whether the connection via curl can or cannot be made. Of course, normally one uses curl to visit a given page on a given site, but again we're just "hacking" it to have it try to merely connect.     </p><h2>How the curl command responds if the port CANNOT be reached, and dealing with hang time</h2>    <p>
If somehow that machine (or ip address or domain name) cannot be reached, the request will hang (more on that in a moment) and then the curl command will respond with this error:    </p><p>curl: (<span>28</span>) Failed to connect to <span>&lt;machine&gt;</span>: <span>&lt;port&gt;</span> after <span>&lt;duration&gt;</span>: ms: Couldn't connect to server</p>    <p>
The key is that this tells us that that the port could not be reached. (As for "why not", neither curl nor ssh can help with that. I discuss that at the end.)    </p><p>
As for this "hang time" waiting to connect, this is something telnet did also. The amount of time it will wait is technically defined by your OS, and is known generically as the TCP timeout time.  A difference with curl versus telnet is that you CAN control how long you're willing for the curl command to await using the command's optional <i>connect-timeout</i> flag, as in the following example to set a 1-second timeout:    </p><p>curl --connect-timeout 1 <span>&lt;machine&gt;</span>:<span>&lt;port&gt;</span></p>    <p>
Finally, if you find it does not stop trying to connect within the number of seconds indicated, do beware that the curl tool may be attempting different additional connections than you may realize. Add the -v arg to the command, to see more verbose output, including details of the connections it's attempting.    </p><p>curl -v --connect-timeout 1 <span>&lt;machine&gt;</span>:<span>&lt;port&gt;</span></p>    <p>
So that's how the tool can tell us (or be tweaked regarding) the failure to connect. Let's move on to what it may show if it CAN connect.    </p><h2>How the curl command responds if the port CAN be reached</h2>    <p>
Remembering that curl is first and foremost a command-line http client, if the connection is successful AND there's a web server on the other end (with a default web page to satisfy this request), <b>the command will respond showing us the output of the page</b>, whatever it is. :-) Or if it does not exist, it will perhaps show the content returned in the form of some sort of 404 error page. (And yes, there are ways to pipe its output to a file or the bit bucket, but I leave you to check out the docs for that.)    </p><p>
If instead the port being tested could be reached but it is NOT for a web server (which may be more common for folks seeking to "test a port's accessibility"), then the curl command will respond (immediately) with an error:    </p><p>curl: (<span>52</span>) Empty reply from server</p>    <p>
And <b>given that our goal again is just to know if the port can be reached, there's value in getting that immediate error: the port CAN be reached.</b>    </p><p>
(Another beneficial difference of this over the old telnet approach is that with that, a successful connection would show a blank screen if the connection, awaiting commands. You'd have to know telnet keystrokes and commands to break out of that, or you might close the terminal window if testing the port was your only reason for opening it.)    </p><p>
But maybe you feel itchy about using curl for this task. Well, if you can be persuaded, there is again the alternative of using ssh...    </p><h2 id="ssh">Option 3) Using ssh to test connectivity to a port</h2>    <p>
As for using ssh to test if a port can be reached, you could do something like this:  </p><p>ssh -p <span>&lt;port&gt;</span> <span>&lt;machine&gt;</span></p>    <p>
Again, <i>machine</i> could be an ip address, domain name, machine name, etc.  (And those two values of machine and port are indeed the reverse order of both the curl above and the traditional telnet.)      </p><h2>How the ssh command responds if the port CANNOT be reached, and dealing with hang time</h2>    <p>
If the port CANNOT be reached, then (like with curl and telnet) the command will hang for an extended period of time before failing with an error like:  </p><p>ssh: connect to host <span>&lt;machine&gt;</span>  port <span>&lt;port&gt;</span>: Connection timed out</p>    <p>
So with my example above, I'd receive this if SQL Server was not listening or inaccessible:  </p><p>ssh: connect to host dbserver port 1433: Connection timed out</p>    <p>
And as in the case of curl, if you want to override that long TCP timeout time for your OS, you can do that with the command's optional ConnectTimeout flag. The following to set a 1-second timeout:    </p><p>ssh -o ConnectTimeout=1  -p <span>&lt;port&gt;</span> <span>&lt;machine&gt;</span></p>    <p>
(And as with curl, if you find it does not stop trying to connect within the number of seconds indicated, do beware that the ssh tool may be attempting different connections than you realize. add the -v arg to the command, to see more details of the connections it's attempting.)    </p><p>
Again, as for "why" it can't be reached, see the end of this port for ideas to consider.    </p><h2>How the ssh command responds if the port CAN be reached</h2>    <p>
If on the other hand the port CAN be reached, the ssh command <b>will respond immediately</b>, which is nice. And that's what makes this (like curl) indeed a helpful tool (.     </p><p>
That said, note that if the port you're checking is technically not an ssh port, the command will also report an "error":   </p><p>kex_exchange_identification: Connection closed by remote host</p>    <p>
In the case of using the command for this test of port connectivity, we can ignore that error. Again, <b>at least this confirms that the port could be reached, which was our primary goal.</b>    </p><h2 id="other">Using other cli tools on Linux, Unix, MacOS</h2>    <p>
Before wrapping up this post, I mentioned at the open how this this technique may appeal to Windows users more than those on *nix OS's, as they not only already have long had the two tools above, but they have still other tools they can use for this task of testing for whether a port can be reached, such as  netcat/nc, which could handle this just as simply:    </p><p>nc -zv <span>&lt;machine&gt;</span> <span>&lt;port&gt;</span></p>    <p>
And as for port-scanning (the broader process of determining what ports are open on a given machine), there is the classic (and powerful) nmap command, but it's beyond the scope of this post (as its related tool ncat, which is not the same as netcat above).    </p><h2 id="why">On understanding WHY the port being checked could not be reached</h2>    <p>
Finally, I realize some may wonder how to know WHY a port can't be reached, but neither of these tools can help with that: they merely respond one way if the port CAN be reached and another if it cannot.     </p><p>
As I noted at the opening, the reach a port may not be open is that the service you're trying to reach is not enabled. Or maybe there's a firewall blocking access to it (which blocking could be specific to your machine from you are attempting to make the connection). There may be a firewall in the OS of the machine you're talking to, or one that's been installed there as software, or there may be one on the network you're connecting to, etc.    </p><p>
Or you may simply have the wrong value for the port you are testing, or the ip address, domain name, machine name, etc.     </p><p>
Before we wrap up, note that sometimes you may find that a given machine can be identified any of many different ways--such that a port may be "open" to you if you try a way that's different from what you're trying (so try an ip address if you have a domain name, or vice-versa, or perhaps try a subdomain if you know of one, and so on).    </p><p>
Often, you will need to get on the server itself (which you can't reach) and attempt these or other tools THERE, to find out if the port is correct in the first place.    </p><h2>Conclusion</h2>    <p>
I hope I've helped you see how curl and ssh (and nc) can be handy tools to have in your arsenal, when you just want to quickly test port accessibility from the commandline. For those on Windows, you can stop trying to install telnet to do a quick port test: just use curl or ssh! :-) That was really the primary motivation of my post here.    </p><p>
And let me know how it goes.    </p><p>
Indeed, this is one of those topics where there may be dark corners, edge cases, and unexpected situations where results differ. I'm sure some people have more experience to share, whether other gotchas or tips, or still other tools that may be built-in to Windows or *nix. As for other tools one might obtain, those are less interesting as again the post here is about built-in tools, because often people are working in environments (especially on servers or containers) where they're not necessarily free to/wanting to install software.    </p><p>

			<p>It’s no secret that the Trump administration has fostered a culture of corruption in which special interests and big donors advance their interests at the expense of everyday people. Perhaps no policy area exemplifies this corruption more than the issue of drug pricing.</p>
<p>President Trump has long promised to stand up to the pharmaceutical industry and lower prescription drug prices, but he has avoided taking serious action to drive down prices while at the same time filling top spots in his administration with industry insiders. This administration’s culture of corruption, which continues a decadeslong practice of political pandering to the pharmaceutical industry, carries a real cost; Americans spent&nbsp;$535 billion<a href="#f1" tooltip=""><sup>1</sup></a>&nbsp;on prescription drugs in 2018, an increase of 50 percent since 2010. These price increases far surpass inflation, with Big Pharma increasing prices on its most-prescribed medications by anywhere from 40 percent to 71 percent from 2011 to 2015.<a href="#f2" tooltip=""><sup>2</sup></a></p>
		</div>
				
					<div data-cap-block-name="wysiwyg - 3">
			<p>Moreover, pharmaceutical companies receive substantial U.S. government assistance in the form of publicly funded basic research and tax breaks, yet they continue to charge exorbitant prices for medications. But the issue goes beyond cost. In America, more than 1 million individuals suffer from Type 1 diabetes<a href="#f3" tooltip=""><sup>3</sup></a>, a condition where the body cannot make insulin, which is essential for getting glucose (also known as blood sugar) into cells from the bloodstream. Without insulin, glucose accumulates in the bloodstream<a href="#f4" tooltip=""><sup>4</sup></a>, causing dangerously high blood sugar levels. Among all Americans suffering from diabetes, at least 1 in 4<a href="#f5" tooltip=""><sup>5</sup></a> have said that they engaged in insulin rationing—a tactic of using less insulin than is needed in order to make the doses last longer—as a direct result of the skyrocketing price of the drug. A vial of insulin, which is the only life-sustaining option for Type 1 diabetics, retails at &nbsp;around $300.<a href="#f6" tooltip=""><sup>6</sup></a> A 2018 study commissioned by the Congressional Diabetes Caucus found that the price of&nbsp;insulin has doubled since 2012<a href="#f7" tooltip=""><sup>7</sup></a>; in the 10 years prior, the price of insulin nearly tripled. Despite the dangers of insulin rationing, which can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis, a fatal condition, many Americans have no other choice. That was the case for&nbsp;Antroinette<a href="#f8" tooltip=""><sup>8</sup></a>, whose daughter was rationing insulin due to the high cost and died at the age of 22 as a result.</p>
<div>
<h3>Insulin facts</h3>
<ul>
<li>Access to insulin for patients with Type 1 diabetes is a matter of life or death.<a href="#f9" tooltip=""><sup>9</sup></a></li>
<li>While insulin has existed since the1920s<a href="#f10" tooltip=""><sup>10</sup></a>, the price since then has skyrocketed, especially in recent years. Prices for insulin increased by 197 percent between 2002 and 2013, from $4.34 per milliliter to $12.92 per milliliter.<a href="#f11" tooltip=""><sup>11</sup></a></li>
<li>There are three insulin manufacturers serving the United States: Eli Lilly and Co., Novo Nordisk A/S, and Sanofi SA.</li>
<li>Eli Lillyannounced<a href="#f12" tooltip=""><sup>12</sup></a>&nbsp;in March 2019 that it would begin selling a generic version of its Humalog insulin at half the price. The medication, known as lispro, will cost $137.35 per vial. To compare pricing,&nbsp;a 2018 study<a href="#f13" tooltip=""><sup>13</sup></a>&nbsp;estimated that the cost of making a year’s worth of insulin for one patient ranges from $78 to $133.</li>
<li>Ahead of its hearing on drug pricing in February 2019, the U.S. Senate Committee on Finance sent aletter<a href="#f14" tooltip=""><sup>14</sup></a>&nbsp;to Eli Lilly asking why insulin is priced&nbsp;so astonishingly high. A vial of NovoLog, one type of insulin, costs<a href="#f15" tooltip=""><sup>15</sup></a> anywhere from $14 to $300 in the United States but only $48 in Singapore, $14 in India, $6 in Austria, and $0 in Italy.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3>American taxpayers fund basic research</h3>
<p>Billions of taxpayer dollars go into the creation and marketing<a href="#f16" tooltip=""><sup>16</sup></a> of new drugs. <em>The Los Angeles Times</em> reports that, “Since the 1930s, the National Institutes of Health has invested close to&nbsp;$900<a href="#f17" tooltip=""><sup>17</sup></a> billion in the basic and applied research that formed both the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors.” Despite taxpayers’ crucial investment, U.S. consumers are increasingly paying more for their prescription drugs.</p>
<p>A&nbsp;2018&nbsp;study<a href="#f18" tooltip=""><sup>18</sup></a>&nbsp;on the National Institute of Health’s (NIH) financial contributions to new drug approvals found that the agency “contributed to published research associated with&nbsp;every one of the 210&nbsp;new drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration from 2010–2016.”&nbsp;More than&nbsp;$100 billion&nbsp;in NIH funding went toward research that contributed directly or indirectly to the 210 drugs approved during that six-year period. The&nbsp;NIH Research Project Grant (R01)<a href="#f19" tooltip=""><sup>19</sup></a>—which supports health-related research—was by far the most common kind of grant used to fund the science that supported the new drugs.&nbsp;In all, NIH gave out nearly 118,000<a href="#f20" tooltip=""><sup>20</sup></a> R01 grants related to those drugs from 2010 to 2016.</p>

			<h3>Federal perks for Big Pharma add up</h3>
<p>Pharmaceutical companies also benefit from research and development tax credits.&nbsp;The federal R&amp;D tax credit was first introduced in 1981 to encourage private sector&nbsp;investment in pioneering research.<a href="#f21" tooltip=""><sup>21</sup></a> This tax credit is available to businesses that attempt to develop new, improved, or&nbsp;technologically advanced products or trade processes.<a href="#f22" tooltip=""><sup>22</sup></a> In 2015, former President Barack Obama signed into law the&nbsp;Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act<a href="#f23" tooltip=""><sup>23</sup></a>, which made these tax credits permanent and extended them to small businesses and startup companies.</p>
<p>Pharmaceutical industries also receive a tax deduction for their marketing and advertising expenses. According to a report in the <em>Journal of the American Medical Association</em>, “From 1997 through 2016, medical marketing expanded substantially, and spending increased from&nbsp;$17.7 to $29.9 billion,<a href="#f24" tooltip=""><sup>24</sup></a> with direct-to-consumer advertising for prescription drugs and health services accounting for the&nbsp;most rapid growth, and&nbsp;pharmaceutical marketing to health professionals&nbsp;accounting for most promotional spending.” The report also found that from 1997 through 2016, “the number of advertisements … increased from&nbsp;79,000 (including 72,000 television commercials) in 1997 to 4.6 million (663,000 television<a href="#f25" tooltip=""><sup>25</sup></a>&nbsp;commercials) in 2016.”</p>
<h3>Big Pharma’s drug pricing maximizes profits</h3>
<p>Despite these taxpayer subsidies, prescription drug prices are nonetheless increasing at an alarming rate. In 2019, price increases&nbsp;from drug manufacturers affected more than 3,400<a href="#f26" tooltip=""><sup>26</sup></a> drugs. For example, Allergan, a major pharmaceutical manufacturer, raised prices on 51 drugs, just more than half its portfolio. Some medications&nbsp;that Allergan manufactures saw a 9.5 percent jump in cost, while others saw a 4.9 percent increase in cost.<a href="#f27" tooltip=""><sup>27</sup></a> Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., the largest generic drug manufacturer in the world,&nbsp;increased its drug prices by more than 9 percent.<a href="#f28" tooltip=""><sup>28</sup></a> These sharp increases in&nbsp;price&nbsp;occur&nbsp;as companies&nbsp;continue to report millions of dollars in revenue. In 2018, Allergan reported $15.8 million<a href="#f29" tooltip=""><sup>29</sup></a> in revenue, while Teva Pharmaceuticals reported $18.8 million<a href="#f30" tooltip=""><sup>30</sup></a> in revenue.</p>
<p>Pharmaceutical companies’ profit margins receive significant bumps when they launch new drugs, specifically specialty drugs, used to treat life-threatening conditions. These drugs often cost more than most Americans can afford. Pharmaceutical companies have stated that the prices are high because the drugs are difficult to manufacture. In 2013, for example, industry giant Gilead Sciences launched Sovaldi, a hepatitis C drug, at $1,000 per pill<a href="#f31" tooltip=""><sup>31</sup></a>, or $84,000<a href="#f32" tooltip=""><sup>32</sup></a> per treatment, which could last 12 to 24 weeks.<a href="#f33" tooltip=""><sup>33</sup></a> After an 18-month investigation into the company’s pricing, the Senate Finance Committee concluded that Gilead had pursued a marketing and pricing strategy designed to “maximize revenue with little concern for access or affordability.”<a href="#f34" tooltip=""><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>Drug companies also benefit from patents, which give them monopoly power for their on-patent products. These patents ensure that prices remain high by reducing competition. Drug patents last for 20 years after the filing date. Pharmaceutical companies have also employed tactics such as evergreening and thicketing to prolong a drug’s exclusivity. When evergreening, pharmaceutical companies make certain modifications to a drug such as changing its<a href="#f35" tooltip=""><sup>35</sup></a> chemical composition slightly or making an external change as minor as adding a stripe to a pill<a href="#f36" tooltip=""><sup>36</sup></a> in order to preserve their patents. A 2018 study in the <em>Journal of Law and the Biosciences</em> found that 78 percent<a href="#f37" tooltip=""><sup>37</sup></a> of new drug patents awarded in the past decade went to drugs that already existed. Seventy percent <a href="#f38" tooltip=""><sup>38</sup></a> of the nearly 100 bestselling drugs extended their exclusivity protections at least once, and 50 percent extended their patents more than once. The second tactic—thicketing—involves flooding the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and the courts with excessive patents and applications to make it difficult for competing firms to secure patents. These tactics help preserve pharmaceutical companies’ monopolies and ensure that drug prices remain uncompetitive and thus less affordable for everyday Americans.</p>
<p>While consumers continue to pay the price of this market manipulation, a Government Accountability Office (GAO) report on the pharmaceutical industry found that these unfair practices are significantly enriching manufacturers. As the report stated, “Among the largest 25 companies, annual average profit margin fluctuated between&nbsp;15 and 20 percent.”<a href="#f39" tooltip=""><sup>39</sup></a> The GAO contextualizes these profits by comparing the pharmaceutical industry’s profits with those of its counterparts, stating that “the annual average profit margin across non-drug companies among the largest 500 globally fluctuated between 4 and 9 percent.”</p>
<p>In 2018 alone, the CEOs of major pharmaceutical companies Allergan, Johnson &amp; Johnson, and Pfizer Inc. made a total of $90 million.<a href="#f40" tooltip=""><sup>40</sup></a> Meanwhile,&nbsp;according to a CBS News report, Americans spent&nbsp;$535 billion<a href="#f41" tooltip=""><sup>41</sup></a> on prescription drugs in 2018—an increase of 50 percent since 2010.<a href="#f42" tooltip=""><sup>42</sup></a> As pharmaceutical industry&nbsp;profits increase<a href="#f43" tooltip=""><sup>43</sup></a>, everyday Americans—whose tax dollars play a critical role in funding the research and development of these medications—are not receiving anything close to a fair return on their investment.</p>
<p>A recent Pew Charitable Trusts study found that Americans spent $65.8 billion<a href="#f44" tooltip=""><sup>44</sup></a> out of pocket in 2016 for retail prescription drugs, up from $59.5 billion in 2012. The high cost of prescription drugs is a significant driver of medical debt<a href="#f45" tooltip=""><sup>45</sup></a> because Americans are increasingly reliant on medication to&nbsp;manage long-term chronic conditions.<a href="#f46" tooltip=""><sup>46</sup></a> Additionally, the high cost of prescription drugs has forced many Americans to take drastic measures, including foregoing taking their medications as prescribed or traveling abroad in order to save on medications. A 2019 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study found that 11.4 percent<a href="#f47" tooltip=""><sup>47</sup></a> of adults aged 18 to 64 did not take their prescription drugs as prescribed in order to reduce how much they spent on their medications. And, as NPR recently reported, “The U.S government estimates that close to&nbsp;1 million<a href="#f48" tooltip=""><sup>48</sup></a>&nbsp;Americans&nbsp;in California alone go to Mexico annually for health care, including to buy prescription drugs.” In May 2019,&nbsp;a group of Americans<a href="#f49" tooltip=""><sup>49</sup></a>&nbsp;living with Type 1 diabetes traveled to Canada to purchase insulin and&nbsp;call on&nbsp;the U.S. government to regulate the cost of lifesaving drugs.&nbsp;The costs associated with traveling abroad make it logistically and financially impractical for most Americans. Further, traveling abroad presents certain health risks given that some countries have lax drug certification standards compared with FDA standards.</p>

			<h3>President Trump’s broken promises on drug pricing</h3>
<p>In an interview with <em>Time </em>magazine ahead of being chosen as its Person of the Year in 2016, Trump said, “I’m going to bring down drug prices. I don’t like what’s happened with drug prices.”<a href="#f50" tooltip=""><sup>50</sup></a> He promised to bring Americans’ drug spending down to $0 by negotiating drug prices.<a href="#f51" tooltip=""><sup>51</sup></a> Trump made grandiose promises on drug pricing but almost three years later has only managed to deliver a handful of half-measures, illustrating his administration’s lack of commitment to lowering drug prices. One of Trump’s proposals from his so-called presidential blueprint<a href="#f52" tooltip=""><sup>52</sup></a> included eliminating some rebates paid by drug companies<a href="#f53" tooltip=""><sup>53</sup></a> that hide the true cost of drugs. However, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the measure would actually increase federal spending on Medicare and Medicaid by $177 billion.<a href="#f54" tooltip=""><sup>54</sup></a> The Trump administration also announced a regulation that would require TV ads for drugs to include the list price.<a href="#f55" tooltip=""><sup>55</sup></a> Some experts believe this policy will be ineffective<a href="#f56" tooltip=""><sup>56</sup></a> at making pharmaceutical companies lower list prices or end price hikes for drugs and will only confuse or mislead consumers rather than help them.<a href="#f57" tooltip=""><sup>57</sup></a> These half-measures, combined with Trump surrounding himself with high-level Big Pharma officials, clearly communicates that the administration is not on track to lower drug costs for Americans.</p>
<p>Congress has done little to address the problem of high drug prices. Instead, many members continue to enjoy&nbsp;cozy relationships with the pharmaceutical industry. The industry spent more than&nbsp;$62 million in the 2016 congressional elections—the&nbsp;most it has ever spent on political campaigns.<a href="#f58" tooltip=""><sup>58</sup></a> The massive influx of campaign cash benefited&nbsp;members of both parties, including&nbsp;those that sit on committees with jurisdiction over drug pricing.<a href="#f59" tooltip=""><sup>59</sup></a>&nbsp;Big Pharma’s investment has paid off as recently as July 2019, when the Senate Finance Committee failed to pass an amendment on the&nbsp;Prescription Drug Pricing Reduction Act of 2019, which&nbsp;would have allowed Medicare to negotiate drug prices with manufacturers.<a href="#f60" tooltip=""><sup>60</sup></a><u>&nbsp;</u>Medicare’s ability to negotiate on drug prices, which is currently prohibited by law, “would provide the leverage needed to lower drug costs.”<a href="#f61" tooltip=""><sup>61</sup></a></p>
<p>Despite his promise to be tough on Big Pharma, President Trump has proven to be a friend to the industry. Big Pharma officials have filled at least 16<a href="#f62" tooltip=""><sup>62</sup></a> current or former positions in the Trump administration, and many of Trump’s top health advisers have been industry insiders or close to the pharmaceutical companies. Trump’s first secretary of health and human services, former Rep. Tom Price (R-GA), was a longtime friend of the industry<a href="#f63" tooltip=""><sup>63</sup></a> in Congress, where he not only pushed Big Pharma’s agenda but also benefited from it financially.<a href="#f64" tooltip=""><sup>64</sup></a> Price, who drew scrutiny for more than $300,000 in health care stock trades, was eventually forced to resign in 2017<a href="#f65" tooltip=""><sup>65</sup></a> as a result of his illicit use of private jets on the taxpayers’ dime.</p>
<p>In 2017, Trump nominated Joe Grogan<a href="#f66" tooltip=""><sup>66</sup></a> to a top position at the U.S. Office of Management and Budget. Grogan spent five years as a lobbyist for Gilead—the pharmaceutical company that is infamous for its sky-high prices on a cure for hepatitis C.<a href="#f67" tooltip=""><sup>67</sup></a> Since joining the administration, Grogan has led drug-pricing proposals and participated in Trump’s Drug Pricing and Innovation Working Group.”<a href="#f68" tooltip=""><sup>68</sup></a> However, the working group has proposed pharma-friendly measures such as implementing monopoly rights outside of the United States, speeding up approval from the FDA for new drugs, and eliminating price cuts for hospitals in impoverished areas.</p>
<p>President Trump chose to replace Price with Alex Azar, the former president of&nbsp;Eli Lilly—one of the companies that is working to keep drug prices high while everyday Americans suffer—to oversee his efforts to address drug pricing as secretary of health and human services.</p>
<p>In 2018, pharmaceutical companies spent more than $283 million in lobbying dollars<a href="#f69" tooltip=""><sup>69</sup></a>, with Eli Lilly spending just less than $6.8 million in 2018.<a href="#f70" tooltip=""><sup>70</sup></a> While Azar, Trump’s chief health adviser, was president of Eli Lilly, the company drastically increased insulin prices. Eli Lilly is currently defending itself against a class-action lawsuit<a href="#f71" tooltip=""><sup>71</sup></a> accusing&nbsp;the company&nbsp;of colluding with pharmacy benefit managers—individuals who negotiate drug pricing and availability with drug companies for&nbsp;the&nbsp;government and other insurance plans—to&nbsp;increase&nbsp;prices. Big Pharma and pharmacy benefit managers have been playing a blame game<a href="#f72" tooltip=""><sup>72</sup></a>&nbsp;while lawmakers—who have held several hearings in the&nbsp;U.S. House of Representatives<a href="#f73" tooltip=""><sup>73</sup></a>&nbsp;and the U.S.&nbsp;Senate<a href="#f74" tooltip=""><sup>74</sup></a>—try to find the source of America’s drug pricing problem.</p>
<p>Given the sway that Big Pharma has with the administration, the industry has no plans to reduce prescription drug prices or reverse past price gouging. For his part, President Trump tried but failed to pass the American Health Care Act of 2017, which would have hurt millions of Americans while benefiting the pharmaceutical industry, among others. However, he was successful in signing into law a new tax bill that lowered the corporate tax rate by 14 percent, allowing pharmaceutical companies, including those with ties to the Trump administration, to save a total of $76 billion.<a href="#f75" tooltip=""><sup>75</sup></a> After the tax law was enacted, Eli Lilly received a tax cut of nearly $4.5 billion on offshore profits.<a href="#f76" tooltip=""><sup>76</sup></a> Instead of using these tax savings to lower drug prices, big pharmaceutical companies such as Eli Lilly together used $45 billion of their total tax savings<a href="#f77" tooltip=""><sup>77</sup></a> to benefit shareholders via stock buyback programs. After President Trump helped Eli Lilly save billions, Azar, the company’s top executive, was confirmed to head the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services<a href="#f78" tooltip=""><sup>78</sup></a> at the beginning of the following year.</p>

			<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Although the Trump administration keeps promising to lower drug prices, drug costs continue to climb as Americans suffer and pharmaceutical companies profit and their CEOs line their pockets. The government-funded research and major tax benefits that these pharmaceutical companies enjoy help them stay profitable. Meanwhile, they continue to hike up the costs of drugs, particularly life-sustaining drugs such as insulin.</p>
<p>Big Pharma can play this game indefinitely, benefiting from this culture of corruption, using allies in the administration and in Congress to grow their profit margins while everyday people suffer. But there are steps lawmakers can take to reduce the influence of special interests, including Big Pharma.<a href="#f79" tooltip=""><sup>79</sup></a> For example, lobbyists are currently allowed to fundraise for candidates for federal office—and many of them provide far more financial support beyond the $2,800 per candidate limit by hosting fundraising events and bundling contributions. Banning lobbyists from fundraising<a href="#f80" tooltip=""><sup>80</sup></a> for candidates would reduce special-interest influence over the legislative process. Another way to limit corrupting conflicts of interest is to ban members of Congress from accepting campaign donations from entities under the jurisdiction of the committees on which the serve. It is understood that conflicts can easily arise from committee contributions, which explains why 88 percent of voters support this prohibition.<a href="#f81" tooltip=""><sup>81</sup></a> Additionally, Washington’s infamous revolving door between private industry and government must be closed. Proposals to do so include a lifetime lobbying ban on members of Congress and a five-year lobbying ban on senior congressional staffers.<a href="#f82" tooltip=""><sup>82</sup></a></p>
<p>As Americans are caught trying to decide whether to pay for rent or medicine, pharmaceutical companies continue to reap government benefits.&nbsp;Reducing drug prices and the costs that everyday people must pay is not possible without fixing the broken system in Washington.</p>

		<p>If you used Macs before Sierra, chances are that you were happy to browse their logs when necessary, for example to check whether your Time Machine backups were working correctly, or quietly throwing errors. At that time, the logs were traditional text-based records like those in other variants of Unix, and browsed using the Console app in /Applications/Utilities.</p>

<p>I started to become irritated by them as long ago as El Capitan, writing:<br>
“Having excised most of the old dross and accumulated extensions, and running a fairly clean El Capitan system, my All Messages [in Console] clocks up around 4000 messages every 8 or 9 hours. At its worst – straight after the OS X 10.11.5 update, for example – it can fill those 4000 message slots in a minute or two, but even overnight when the system is not asleep it will seldom stretch to much longer than 12 hours. A traditional Unix wizard would have the screaming ab-dabs at this. We used to tweak, tune, and pare down systems until they barely coughed into their logs. It used to be the mark of a well-loved system.”</p>
<p>Little did we realise then that Sierra was going to change all that, and by Mojave we’d be enduring 4,000 and more log entries in a second, when our Macs were feeling loquacious. That was because Apple introduced the Unified log, with its entries written not in plain text but compressed binary format. This was the death-blow for the casual reader of logs: for a start, the replacement Console app was unable to access any log entries made in the past, and its tools were, and remain, woefully inadequate for tackling the increasing torrent of log entries.</p>
<p>Despite its many great strengths, the Unified log has suffered two problems that are limiting its usefulness in Sonoma: its diminishing period of coverage, and censorship.</p>
<h4>Period of coverage</h4>
<p>Rather than rolling its log files by their age, and keeping the last five days of logs, macOS maintains them by size. Like its predecessors, that means <code>logd</code>, its maintainer, only keeps the last 520 MB or so of regular <em>Persist</em> log entries collected at any time, and purges older entries. Some older log entries are retained, but it’s pot luck as to whether those you’re interested in are among them, and even if they are, other related entries may have been removed already. If you’re interested to see how this works, <code>logd</code> keeps records in the logdata.statistics.[n].txt files in /var/db/diagnostics, but those too are purged so you can only look back a few days.</p>
<p>In the early days of the Unified log, I was amazed to discover that it kept log records for as long as 20 days or more. In Sonoma, my main working Mac is struggling to keep them for as long as 24 hours. There’s no way for the user to increase that period to compensate for the increased rate of writing log entries by macOS. If I don’t catch an event well within 24 hours of it happening, chances are that its log entries will already have been purged when I go to look for them.</p>
<h4>Privacy</h4>
<p>Censorship to maintain privacy is an important feature in the Unified log, and is responsible for so many of its entries being peppered with <code>&lt;private&gt;</code> instead of revealing potentially sensitive data. The mechanism for this is robust: when collecting entries for the log, sensitive content is excluded, then displayed with that marker. As that sensitive content isn’t stored in the first place, there’s no way to unmask that content once it has been collected and written to the log.</p>
<p>Currently, the only way to see unmasked log entries is through a <a href="https://eclecticlight.co/2023/03/08/removing-privacy-censorship-from-the-log/">special profile</a>. Once that has been enabled, and until it’s disabled again, all privacy should be removed from the log, and those <code>&lt;private&gt;</code> markers replaced with real data.</p>
<p>Only Apple has now decided that some log content is too private to reveal even when privacy has been removed. I came across this recently, in multiple log entries, when researching Web Apps, in entries like<br>
<code>ShareKit Start performing service <code>&lt;private&gt;</code> with items: <code>&lt;private&gt;</code><br>
ShareKit filteredItemsFromItems:<code>&lt;private&gt;</code> [-1]--&gt; <code>&lt;private&gt;</code><br>
ShareKit Final shared items for <code>&lt;private&gt;</code>: <code>&lt;private&gt;</code><br>
ShareKit Perform custom action (<code>&lt;private&gt;</code> [<code>&lt;private&gt;</code>])<br>
ShareKit Custom action (<code>&lt;private&gt;</code>) does not support async, running sync block</code></p>
<p>Of course, it may be possible to turn this additional privacy off, but the documentation leads us once again to a guessing game. Apple documents the <em>Enable-Private-Data</em> profile key <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicemanagement/systemlogging" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, where it refers to it controlling “private data logging”. But in its account on <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/os/oslogprivacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">log privacy settings</a>, Apple refers to two distinct privacy settings that can be applied to the content of log entries: the “standard option” <em>‘private’,</em> and <em>sensitive,</em> described as “the option to always redact interpolated values that contain sensitive information.” Does this mean that setting <em>Enable-Private-Data</em> to <strong>false</strong> doesn’t unmask content designated <em>sensitive,</em> only that set as <em>‘private’?</em></p>
<p>Like so many great ideas, the Unified log is suffering from profligate overuse. Who really needs to see full dictionary dumps from RunningBoard? Is there no better way to record that information than in the log?</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          
<p><em><span>“</span>Well, Congressman, I view our responsibility as not just building services that people like to use, but making sure that those services are also good for people and good for society overall.” — <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2018/04/11/transcript-of-zuckerbergs-appearance-before-house-committee/">Mark Zuckerberg, 2018</a></em></p>
<p>In the previous two posts in this series, I did a <a href="https://erinkissane.com/meta-in-myanmar-part-i-the-setup">long but briskly paced early history</a> of Meta and the internet in Myanmar—and the hateful and dehumanizing speech that came with it—and then looked at what an outside-the-company view could reveal about <a href="https://erinkissane.com/meta-in-myanmar-part-ii-the-crisis">Meta’s role in the genocide of the Rohingya</a> in 2016 and 2017.</p>
<p>In this post, I’ll look at what two whistleblowers and a crucial newspaper investigation reveal about what was happening <em>inside</em> Meta at the time. Specifically, the disclosed information:</p>
<ul>
<li>gives us a quantitative view of Meta’s content moderation performance—which, in turn, highlights a deceptive <span>PR</span> move routine Meta uses when questioned about moderation;</li>
<li>clarifies what Meta knew about the effects of its algorithmic recommendations systems; and</li>
<li>reveals a parasitic takeover of the Facebook platform by covert influence campaigns around the world—including in Myanmar.</li>
</ul>
<p>Before we get into that, a brief personal note. There are few ways to be in the world that I enjoy less than<span></span> <span>“</span>breathless conspiratorial.” That rhetorical mode muddies the water when people most need clarity and generates an emotional charge that works against effective decision-making. I really don’t like it. So it’s been unnerving to synthesize a lot of mostly public information and come up with results that wouldn’t look completely out of place in one of those overwrought threads.</p>
<p>I don’t know what to <em>do</em> with that except to be forthright but not dramatic, and to treat my readers’ endocrine systems with respect by avoiding needless flourishes. But the story is just rough and many people in it do bad things. (You can read my <a href="https://erinkissane.com/meta-meta">meta-post about terminology and sourcing</a> if you want to see me agonize over the minutiae.)</p>
<p><strong>Content warnings for the post:</strong> The whole series is about genocide and hate speech. There are no graphic descriptions or images, and this post includes no slurs or specific examples of hateful and inciting messages, but still. (And there’s a fairly unpleasant photograph of a spider at about the 40% mark.)</p>
<h2 id="the-disclosures">The disclosures</h2>
<p>When Frances Haugen, a former product manager on Meta’s Civic Integrity team, disclosed a ton of internal Meta docs to the SEC—and several media outlets—in 2021, I didn’t really pay attention. I was pandemic-tired and I didn’t think there’d be much in there that I didn’t know. I was wrong!</p>
<p>Frances Haugen’s disclosures are of generational importance, especially if you’re willing to dig down past the US-centric headlines. Haugen has stated that she came forward because of things outside the <span>US—</span><a href="https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1505967624412356612.html">Myanmar</a> and its horrific echo years later in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/25/business/frances-haugen-facebook.html">Ethiopia</a>, specifically, and the likelihood that it would all just keep happening. So it makes sense that the docs she disclosed would be highly relevant, which they are.</p>
<p>There are <a href="https://facebookpapers.com/sec-documents/">eight disclosures</a> in the bundle of information Haugen delivered via lawyers to the <span>SEC</span>, and each is about one specific way Meta<span></span> <span>“</span>misled investors and the public.” Each disclosure takes the form of a letter (which probably has a special legal name I don’t know) and a huge stack of primary documents. The majority of those documents—internal posts, memos, emails, comments—haven’t yet been made public, but the letters themselves include excerpts, and <a href="https://facebookpapers.wpengine.com/">subsequent media coverage</a> and <a href="https://gizmodo.com/facebook-papers-how-to-read-1848702919">straightforward doc dumps</a> have revealed a little bit more. When I cite the disclosures, I’ll point to the place where you can read the longest chunk of primary text—often that’s just the little excerpts in the letters, but sometimes we have a whole—albeit redacted—document to look at.</p>

<p>Before continuing, I think it’s only fair to note that the disclosures we see in public are necessarily those that run counter to Meta’s public statements, because otherwise there would be no need to disclose them. And because we’re only getting excerpts, there’s obviously a ton of context missing—including, presumably, dissenting internal views. I’m not interested in making a handwavey case based on one or two people inside a company making wild statements. So I’m only emphasizing points that are supported in multiple, specific excerpts.</p>
<p>Let’s start with content moderation and what the disclosures have to say about it.</p>
<h2 id="how-much-dangerous-stuff-gets-taken-down">How much dangerous stuff gets taken down?</h2>
<p>We don’t know how much<span></span> <span>“</span>objectionable content” is actually on Facebook—or on Instagram, or Twitter, or any other big platform. The companies running those platforms don’t know the exact numbers either, but what they do have are reasonably accurate <em>estimates</em>. We know they have estimates because sampling and human-powered data classification is how you train the <span>AI</span> classifiers required to do content-based moderation—removing posts and comments—at mass scale. And that process necessarily lets you estimate from your samples roughly how much of a given kind of problem you’re seeing. (This is pretty common knowledge, but it’s also confirmed in an internal doc I quote below.)</p>
<p>The platforms aren’t sharing those estimates with us because no one’s forcing them to. And probably also because, based on what we’ve seen from the disclosures, the numbers are <em>quite bad</em>. So I want to look at how bad they are, or recently were, on Facebook. Alongside that, I want to point out the most common way Meta distracts reporters and governing bodies from its terrible stats, because I think it’s a very useful thing to be able to spot.</p>
<p>One of Frances Haugen’s <span>SEC</span> disclosure letters is about Meta’s failures to moderate hate speech. It’s helpfully titled,<span></span> <span>“</span><a href="https://facebookpapers.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Hate-speech_Redacted.pdf">Facebook misled investors and the public about<span></span> <span>‘</span>transparency’ reports boasting proactive removal of over 90% of identified hate speech when internal records show that<span></span> <span>‘</span>as little as 3-5% of hate’ speech is actually removed</a>.”<a href="#footnote-1UCM" id="ref-1UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Here’s the excerpt from the internal Meta document from which that<span></span> <span>“</span>3–5%” figure is drawn:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…we’re deleting less than 5% of all of the hate speech posted to Facebook. This is actually an optimistic estimate—previous (and more rigorous) iterations of this estimation exercise have put it closer to 3%, and on V&amp;I [violence and incitement] we’re deleting somewhere around 0.6%…we miss 95% of violating hate speech.<a href="#footnote-2UCM" id="ref-2UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here’s another quote from different memo excerpted in the same disclosure letter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[W]e do not … have a model that captures even a majority of integrity harms, particularly in sensitive areas … We only take action against approximately 2% of the hate speech on the platform. Recent estimates suggest that unless there is a major change in strategy, it will be very difficult to improve this beyond 10-20% in the short-medium term.<a href="#footnote-3UCM" id="ref-3UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another estimate from a third internal document:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We seem to be having a small impact in many language-country pairs on Hate Speech and Borderline Hate, probably ~3% … We are likely having little (if any) impact on violence.<a href="#footnote-4UCM" id="ref-4UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here’s a fourth one, specific to a study about Facebook in Afghanistan, which I include to help contextualize the global numbers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While Hate Speech is consistently ranked as one of the top abuse categories in the Afghanistan market, the action rate for Hate Speech is worryingly low at 0.23 per cent.<a href="#footnote-5UCM" id="ref-5UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don’t think these figures need a ton of commentary, honestly. I would agree that removing less than a quarter of a percent of hate speech is indeed<span></span> <span>“</span>worryingly low,” as is removing 0.6% of violence and incitement messages. I think removing even 5% of hate speech—the highest number cited in the disclosures—is objectively terrible performance, and I think most people outside of the tech industry would agree with that. Which is presumably why Meta has put a <em>ton</em> of work into muddying the waters around content moderation.</p>
<p>So back to that <span>SEC</span> letter with the long name. It points something out, which is that Meta has long claimed that Facebook<span></span> <span>“</span>proactively” detects between <strong>95%</strong> (<a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/11/19/936706748/facebook-says-its-doing-a-better-job-of-catching-hate-speech-before-users-see-it">in 2020, globally</a>) and <strong>98%</strong> (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-politics-socialmedia-insight-idAFKBN2HM3BU">in Myanmar, in 2021</a>) of all the posts it removes because they’re hate speech—before users even see them.</p>
<p>At a glance, this looks good. Ninety-five percent is a lot! But since we know from the disclosed material that based on internal estimates the takedown rates for hate speech are at or below 5%, what’s going on here?</p>
<p>Here’s what Meta is actually saying: Sure, they might identify and remove only a tiny fraction of dangerous and hateful speech on Facebook, but <em>of that tiny fraction</em>, their <span>AI</span> classifiers catch about 95–98% before users report it. That’s literally the whole game, here.</p>
<p>So…the most generous number from the disclosed memos has Meta removing <strong>5% of hate speech on Facebook</strong>. That would mean that for every <strong>2,000</strong> hateful posts or comments, Meta removes about <strong>100–95</strong> automatically and <strong>5</strong> via user reports. In this example, 1,900 of the original 2,000 messages remain up and circulating. So based on the generous 5% removal rate, their <span>AI</span> systems nailed…4.75% of hate speech. That’s the level of performance they’re bragging about.</p>
<p>You don’t need to take my word for any of this—<cite>Wired</cite> <a href="https://erinkissane.com/%E2%80%9Dhttps://www.wired.com/story/facebooks-deceptive-math-when-it-comes-to-hate-speech/%E2%80%9D">ran a critique</a> breaking it down in 2021 and Ranking Digital Rights has <a href="https://erinkissane.com/%E2%80%9Dhttps://rankingdigitalrights.org/2021/10/14/cross-checking-facebook-frances-haugen/%E2%80%9D">a strongly worded post</a> about what Meta claims in public vs.&nbsp;what the leaked documents reveal to be true, including this content moderation math runaround.</p>
<p>Meta does this particular routine <em>all the time</em>.</p>
<h2 id="the-shell-game">The shell game</h2>
<p>Here’s Mark Zuckerberg on April 10th, 2018, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2018/04/10/transcript-of-mark-zuckerbergs-senate-hearing/">answering a question in front of the Senate’s Commerce and Judiciary committees</a>. He says that hate speech is really hard to find automatically and then pivots to something that he says is a real success, which is<span></span> <span>“</span>terrorist propaganda,” which he simplifies immediately to<span></span> <span>“</span><span>ISIS</span> and Al Qaida content.” But that stuff? No problem:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Contrast [hate speech], for example, with an area like finding terrorist propaganda, which we’ve actually been very successful at deploying A.I. tools on already. Today, as we sit here, 99 percent of the <span>ISIS</span> and Al Qaida content that we take down on Facebook, our A.I. systems flag before any human sees it. So that’s a success in terms of rolling out A.I. tools that can proactively police and enforce safety across the community.<a href="#footnote-6UCM" id="ref-6UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So that’s 99% of…the unknown percentage of this kind of content that’s actually removed.</p>
<p>Zuckerberg actually <em>tries</em> to do the same thing the next day, April 11th, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2018/04/11/transcript-of-zuckerbergs-appearance-before-house-committee/">before the House Energy and Commerce Committee</a>, but he whiffs the maneuver:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…we’re getting good in certain areas. One of the areas that I mentioned earlier was terrorist content, for example, where we now have A.I. systems that can identify and—and take down 99 percent of the al-Qaeda and ISIS-related content in our system before someone—a human even flags it to us. I think we need to do more of that.<a href="#footnote-7UCM" id="ref-7UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The version Zuckerberg says right there, on April 11th, is what I’m pretty sure most people think Meta means when they go into this stuff—but as stated, it’s a lie.</p>
<p>No one in those hearings presses Zuckerberg on those numbers—and when Meta repeats the move in 2020, plenty of reporters fall into the trap and make untrue claims favorable to Meta:</p>

</blockquote>
<p>This is all not just wrong but <em>wildly wrong</em> if you have the internal numbers in front of you.</p>
<p>I’m hitting this point so hard not because I want to point out ~corporate hypocrisy~ or whatever, but because this deceptive runaround is consequential for two reasons: The first is that it provides instructive context about how to interpret Meta’s public statements. The second is that it actually says extremely dire things about Meta’s only hope for content-based moderation at scale, which is their AI-based classifiers.</p>
<p>Here’s Zuckerberg saying as much to a congressional committee:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…one thing that I think is important to understand overall is just the sheer volume of content on Facebook makes it so that we can’t—no amount of people that we can hire will be enough to review all of the content.…&nbsp;We need to rely on and build sophisticated A.I. tools that can help us flag certain content.<a href="#footnote-8UCM" id="ref-8UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This statement is kinda disingenuous in a couple of ways, but the central point is true: the scale of these platforms makes human review incredibly difficult. And Meta’s reasonable-sounding explanation is that this means they have to focus on <span>AI</span>. But by their own internal estimates, Meta’s <span>AI</span> classifiers are only identifying something in the range of 4.75% of hate speech on Facebook, and often considerably less. That seems like a dire stat for the thing you’re putting forward to Congress as your best hope!</p>
<p>The same disclosed internal memo that told us Meta was deleting between 3% and 5% of hate speech had this to say about the potential of <span>AI</span> classifiers to handle mass-scale content removals:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[O]ur current approach of grabbing a hundred thousand pieces of content, paying people to label them as Hate or Not Hate, training a classifier, and using it to automatically delete content at 95% precision is just never going to make much of a dent.<a href="#footnote-9UCM" id="ref-9UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Getting content moderation to work for even extreme and widely reviled categories of speech is obviously genuinely difficult, so I want to be extra clear about a foundational piece of my argument.</p>
<h2 id="responsibility-for-the-machine">Responsibility for the machine</h2>
<p>I think that if you make a machine and hand it out for free to everyone in the world, you’re at least partially responsible for the harm that the machine does.</p>

<p>Also, even if you say,<span></span> <span>“</span>but it’s very difficult to make the machine safer!” I don’t think that reduces your responsibility so much as it makes you look shortsighted and bad at machines.</p>
<p>Beyond the bare fact of difficulty, though, I think the more <em>what harm the machine does</em> deviates from <em>what people might expect a machine that looks like this to do</em>, the more responsibility you bear: If you offer everyone in the world a grenade, I think that’s bad, but also it won’t be surprising when people who take the grenade get hurt or hurt someone else. But when you offer everyone a cute little robot assistant that turns out to be easily repurposed as a rocket launcher, I think that falls into another category.</p>
<p>Especially if you see that people are using your cute little robot assistant to murder thousands of people and elect not to disarm it because that would make it a little less cute.</p>
<p>This brings us to the algorithms.</p>
<h2 id="core-product-mechanics"><span>“</span>Core product mechanics”</h2>
<p><img src="https://erinkissane.com/_files/chalkboard.png" alt="Screencap of an internal Meta document titled Facebook and responsibility, with a header image of the Bart Simson writing on the chalkboard meme in which the writing on the board reads, Facebook is responsible for ranking and recommendations!"></p><p>
<i>From a screencapped version of<span></span> <span>“</span>Facebook and responsibility,” one of the disclosed internal documents.</i>
</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://erinkissane.com/meta-in-myanmar-part-ii-the-crisis">second post in this series</a>, I quoted people in Myanmar who were trying to cope with an overwhelming flood of hateful and violence-inciting messages. It felt obvious on the ground that the worst, most dangerous posts were getting the most juice.</p>
<p>Thanks to the Haugen disclosures, we can confirm that this was also understood inside Meta.</p>

<p>In 2019, a Meta employee wrote a memo called<span></span> <span>“</span>What is Collateral damage.” It included these statements (my emphasis):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>“</span>We have evidence from a variety of sources that hate speech, divisive political speech, and misinformation on Facebook and the family of apps are affecting societies around the world. We also have compelling evidence that <em>our core product mechanics, such as virality, recommendations, and optimizing for engagement, are a significant part of why these types of speech flourish</em> on the platform.</p>
<p>If integrity takes a hands-off stance for these problems, whether for technical (precision) or philosophical reasons, then the net result is that Facebook, taken as a whole, will be actively (if not necessarily consciously) promoting these types of activities. <em>The mechanics of our platform are not neutral.</em> <a href="#footnote-10UCM" id="ref-10UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you work in tech or if you’ve been following mainstream press accounts about Meta over the years, you presumably already know this, but I think it’s useful to establish this piece of the internal conversation.</p>
<p>Here’s a long breakdown from 2020 about the specific parts of the platform that actively put<span></span> <span>“</span>unconnected content”—messages that aren’t from friends or Groups people subscribe to—in front of Facebook users. It comes from an internal post called<span></span> <span>“</span><a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21594152-tier2_rank_other_0320">Facebook and responsibility</a><span></span><span>”</span> (my emphasis):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Facebook is most active in delivering content to users on recommendation surfaces like<span></span> <span>“</span>Pages you may like,”<span></span> <span>“</span>Groups you should join,” and suggested videos on Watch. <strong>These are surfaces where Facebook delivers unconnected content. Users don’t opt-in to these experiences by following other users or Pages. Instead, Facebook is actively presenting these experiences…</strong></p>
<p>News Feed ranking is another way Facebook becomes actively involved in these harmful experiences. Of course users also play an active role in determining the content they are connected to through feed, by choosing who to friend and follow. Still, when and whether a user sees a piece of content is also partly determined by the ranking scores our algorithms assign, which are ultimately under our control. This means, according to ethicists, Facebook is always at least partially responsible for any harmful experiences on News Feed.</p>
<p>This doesn’t owe to any flaw with our News Feed ranking system, it’s just inherent to the process of ranking. To rank items in Feed, we assign scores to all the content available to a user and then present the highest-scoring content first. Most feed ranking scores are determined by relevance models. If the content is determined to be an integrity harm, the score is also determined by some additional ranking machinery to demote it lower than it would have appeared given its score. Crucially, all of these algorithms produce a single score; a score Facebook assigns. Thus, there is no such thing as inaction on Feed. We can only choose to take different kinds of actions.<a href="#footnote-11UCM" id="ref-11UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The next few quotes will apply directly to <span>US</span> concerns, but they’re clearly broadly applicable to the 90% of Facebook users who are outside the <span>US</span> and Canada, and whose disinfo concerns receive vastly fewer resources.</p>
<p>This one is from an internal Meta doc from November 5, 2020:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not only do we not do something about combustible election misinformation in comments, we amplify them and give them broader distribution.<a href="#footnote-12UCM" id="ref-12UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When Meta staff tried to take the measure of their own recommendation systems’ behavior, they found that the systems led a fresh, newly made account into disinfo-infested waters very quickly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After a small number of high quality/verified conservative interest follows…&nbsp;within just one day Page recommendations had already devolved towards polarizing content.</p>
<p>Although the account set out to follow conservative political news and humor content generally, and began by following verified/high quality conservative pages, Page recommendations began to include conspiracy recommendations after only 2 days (it took &lt;1 week to get a QAnon recommendation!)</p>
<p>Group recommendations were slightly slower to follow suit - it took 1 week for in-feed <span>GYSJ</span> recommendations to become fully political/right-leaning, and just over 1 week to begin receiving conspiracy recommendations.<a href="#footnote-13UCM" id="ref-13UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The same document reveals that several of the Pages and Groups Facebook’s systems recommend to its test user show multiple signs of association with<span></span> <span>“</span>coordinated inauthentic behavior,” aka foreign and domestic covert influence campaigns, which we’ll get to very soon.</p>
<p>Before that, I want to offer just one example of algorithmic malpractice from Myanmar.</p>
<h2 id="flower-speech">Flower speech</h2>
<p><img src="https://erinkissane.com/_files/panzagar.jpg" alt="Panzagar campaign illustration depicting a Burmese girl with thanaka on her cheek and illustrated flowers coming from her mouth, flowing toward speech bubbles labeled with the names of Burmese towns and cities."></p>
<p>Back in 2014, Burmese organizations including <span>MIDO</span> and Yangon-based tech accelerator Phandeeyar collaborated on a carefully calibrated <a href="https://www.irrawaddy.com/in-person/hate-speech-pours-poison-heart.html">counter-speech project called Panzagar (<em>flower speech</em>)</a>. The campaign—which was designed to be delivered in person, in printed materials, and online—encouraged ordinary Burmese citizens to push back on hate speech in Myanmar.</p>
<p>Later that year, Meta, which had just been implicated in the deadly communal violence in Mandalay, joined with the Burmese orgs to turn their imagery into digital Facebook stickers that users could apply to posts calling for things like the annihilation of the Rohingya people. The stickers depict cute cartoon characters, several of which offer admonishments like,<span></span> <span>“</span>Don’t be the source of a fire,”<span></span> <span>“</span>Think before you share,”<span></span> <span>“</span>Don’t you be spawning hate,” and<span></span> <span>“</span>Let it go buddy!”</p>
<p>The campaign was widely and approvingly covered by <a href="https://beautifultrouble.org/toolbox/tool/flower-speech-campaign/">western organizations</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/religion/using-flower-speech-and-new-facebook-tools-myanmar-fights-online-hate-speech/2014/12/24/3bff458c-8ba9-11e4-ace9-47de1af4c3eb_story.html">media outlets</a>, and Meta got a lot of praise for its involvement.</p>
<p>But according to members of the Burmese civil society coalition behind the campaign, it turned out that the Panzagar Facebook stickers—which were explicitly designed as counterspeech—“carried significant weight in their distribution algorithm,” so <em>anyone who used them to counter hateful and violent messages inadvertently helped those messages gain wider distribution</em>.<a href="#footnote-14UCM" id="ref-14UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>I mention the Panzagar incident not only because it’s such a head-smacking example of Meta favoring cosmetic, PR-friendly tweaks over meaningful redress, or because it reveals plain incompetence in the face of already-serious violence, but also because it gets to what I see as a genuinely foundational problem with Meta in Myanmar.</p>
<p>Even when the company was finally (repeatedly) forced to take notice of the dangers it was contributing to, actions that could actually have made a difference—like rolling out new programs only after local consultation and adaptation, scaling up culturally and linguistically competent human moderation teams in tandem with increasing uptake, and above all, <em>altering the design of the product</em> to stop amplifying the most charged messages—remained not just undone, but <em>unthinkable</em> because they were outside the company’s understanding of what the product’s design should take into consideration.</p>
<p>This refusal to connect core project design with accelerating global safety problems means that attempts at prevention and repair are relegated to window-dressing—or which are actually counterproductive, as in the case of the Panzagar stickers, which absorbed the energy and efforts of local Burmese civil society groups and turned them into something that made the situation <em>worse</em>.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/interview/alex-stamos/">2018 interview with Frontline about problems with Facebook</a>, Meta’s former Chief Security Officer, Alex Stamos, returns again and again to the idea that security work properly happens at the product design level. Toward the end of the interview, he gets very clear:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stamos: I think there was a structural problem here in that the people who were dealing with the downsides were all working together over kind of in the corner, right, so you had the safety and security teams, tight-knit teams that deal with all the bad outcomes, and we didn’t really have a relationship with the people who are actually designing the product.</p>
<p>Interviewer: You did not have a relationship?</p>
<p>Stamos: Not like we should have, right? It became clear—one of the things that became very clear after the election was that the problems that we knew about and were dealing with before were not making it back into how these products are designed and implemented.<a href="#footnote-15UCM" id="ref-15UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Meta’s content moderation was a disaster in Myanmar—and around the world—not only because it was treated and staffed like an afterthought, but because it was <em>competing against Facebook’s core machinery</em>.</p>
<p>And just as the house always wins, the core machinery of a mass-scale product built to boost engagement always defeats retroactive and peripheral attempts at cleanup.</p>
<p>This is especially true once organized commercial and nation-state actors figured out how to take over that machinery with large-scale fake Page networks boosted by fake engagement, which brings us to a less-discussed revelation: By the mid-2010s, Facebook had effectively become the equivalent of botnet in the hands of any group, governmental or commercial, who could summon the will and resources to exploit it.</p>
<p>A lot of people did, including, predictably, some of the worst people in the world.</p>

<p>When the <em><span>NYT</span></em> did their investigation in 2018, all those fake Pages were still up.</p>
<p>Here’s how it worked: First, the military set up a sprawling network of fake accounts and Pages on Facebook. The fake accounts and Pages focused on innocuous subjects like beauty, entertainment, and humor. These Pages were called things like,<span></span> <span>“</span>Beauty and Classic,”<span></span> <span>“</span>Down for Anything,”<span></span> <span>“</span>You Female Teachers,”<span></span> <span>“</span>We Love Myanmar,” and<span></span> <span>“</span>Let’s Laugh Casually.” Then military staffers, some trained by Russian propaganda specialists, spent years tending the Pages and gradually building up followers.<a href="#footnote-17UCM" id="ref-17UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>Then, using this array of long-nurtured fake Pages—and Groups, and accounts—the Tatmadaw’s propagandists used everything they’d learned about Facebook’s algorithms to post and boost viral messages that cast Rohingya people as part of a global Islamic threat, and as the perpetrators of a never-ending stream of atrocities. The <em>Times</em> reports:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Troll accounts run by the military helped spread the content, shout down critics and fuel arguments between commenters to rile people up. Often, they posted sham photos of corpses that they said were evidence of Rohingya-perpetrated massacres…<a href="#footnote-18UCM" id="ref-18UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That the Tatmadaw was capable of such a sophisticated operation shouldn’t have come as a surprise. Longtime Myanmar digital rights and technology researcher Victoire Rio notes that the Tatmadaw had been openly sending its officers to study in Russia since 2001, was<span></span> <span>“</span>among the first adopters of the Facebook platform in Myanmar” and launched<span></span> <span>“</span>a dedicated curriculum as part of its Defense Service Academy Information Warfare training.”<a href="#footnote-19UCM" id="ref-19UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="what-these-messages-did">What these messages did</h2>
<p>I don’t have the access required to sort out which specific messages originated from extremist religious networks vs.&nbsp;which were produced by military operations, but I’ve seen a lot of the posts and comments central to these overlapping campaigns in the <span>UN</span> documents and human rights reports.</p>
<p>They do some very specific things:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>They dehumanize the Rohingya:</strong> The Facebook messages speak of the Rohingya as invasive species that outbreed Buddhists and Myanmar’s <em>real</em> ethnic groups. There are a lot of bestiality images.</li>
<li><strong>They present the Rohingya as inhumane, as sexual predators, and as an immediate threat:</strong> There are a lot of graphic photos of mangled bodies from around the world, most of them presented as Buddhist victims of Muslim killers—usually Rohingya. There are a lot of posts about Rohingya men raping, forcibly marrying, beating, and murdering Buddhist women. One post that got passed around a lot includes a graphic photo of a woman tortured and murdered by a Mexican cartel, presented as a Buddhist woman in Myanmar murdered by the Rohingya.</li>
<li><strong>They connect the Rohingya to the<span></span> <span>“</span>global Islamic threat”:</strong> There’s a lot of equating Rohingya people with <span>ISIS</span> terrorists and assigning them group responsibility for real attacks and atrocities by distant Islamic terror organizations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ultimately, all of these moves flow into demands for violence. The messages call incessantly and graphically for mass killings, beatings, and forced deportations. They call not for punishment, but annihilation.</p>
<p>This is, literally, textbook preparation for genocide, and I want to take a moment to look at how it works.</p>
<p>Helen Fein is the author of several definitive books on genocide, a co-founder and first president of the International Association of Genocide Scholars, and the founder of the Institute for the Study of Genocide. I think her description of the ways genocidaires legitimize their attacks holds up extremely well despite having been published 30 years ago. Here, she classifies a specific kind of rhetoric as one of the defining characteristics of genocide:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Is there evidence of an ideology, myth, or an articulated social goal which enjoins or justifies the destruction of the victim? Besides the above, observe religious traditions of contempt and collective defamation, stereotypes, and derogatory metaphor indicating the victim is inferior, subhuman (animals, insects, germs, viruses) or superhuman (Satanic, omnipotent), or other signs that the victims were pre-defined as alien, outside the universe of obligation of the perpetrator, subhuman or dehumanized, or the enemy—i.e., the victim needs to be eliminated in order that we may live (Them or Us).<a href="#footnote-20UCM" id="ref-20UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s also necessary for genocidaires to make claims—often supported by manufactured evidence—that the targeted group itself is the true danger, often by projecting genocidal intent onto the group that will be attacked.</p>
<p>Adam Jones, the guy who wrote a <a href="https://erinkissane.com/%E2%80%9Dhttps://www.routledge.com/Genocide-A-Comprehensive-Introduction/Jones/p/book/9781138823846%E2%80%9D">widely used textbook on genocide</a>, puts it this way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
One justifies genocidal designs by imputing such designs to perceived opponents. The Tutsis/ Croatians/Jews/Bolsheviks must be killed because they harbor intentions to kill us, and will do so if they are not stopped/prevented/annihilated. Before they are killed, they are brutalized, debased, and dehumanized—turning them into something approaching<span></span> <span>“</span>subhumans” or<span></span> <span>“</span>animals” and, by a circular logic, justifying their extermination.<a href="#footnote-21UCM" id="ref-21UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So before their annihilation, the target group is presented as outcast, subhuman, vermin, but also themselves genocidal—a mortal threat. And afterward, the extraordinary cruelties characteristic of genocide reassure those committing the atrocities that their victims aren’t actually people.</p>
<p>The Tatmadaw committed atrocities in Myanmar. I touched on them in <a href="https://erinkissane.com/meta-in-myanmar-part-ii-the-crisis">Part <span>II</span></a> and I’m not going to detail them here. But the figuratively dehumanizing rhetoric I described in parts one and two can’t be separated from the literally dehumanizing things the Tatmadaw did to the humans they maimed and traumatized and killed. Especially now that it’s clear that the military was behind much of the rhetoric as well as the violent actions that rhetoric worked to justify.</p>
<p>In some cases, even the methods match up: The military’s campaign of intense and systematic sexual violence toward and mutilation of women and girls, combined with the concurrent mass murder of children and babies, feels inextricably connected to the rhetoric that cast the Rohingya as both a sexual and reproductive threat who endanger the safety of Buddhist women and outbreed the ethnicities that <em>belong</em> in Myanmar.</p>
<p>Genocidal communications are an inextricable part of a system that turns<span></span> <span>“</span>ethnic tensions” into mass death. When we see that the Tatmadaw was literally the operator of covert hate and dehumanization propaganda networks on Facebook, I think the most rational way to understand those networks is as <em>an integral part</em> of the genocidal campaign.</p>
<hr>
<p>After the <em>New York Times</em> article went live, Meta did two big takedowns. Nearly four million people were following the fake Pages identified by either the <em><span>NYT</span></em> or by Meta in follow-up investigations. (Meta had previously removed the Tatmadaw’s own official Pages and accounts and 46<span></span> <span>“</span>news and opinion” Pages that turned out to be covertly operated by the military—those Pages were followed by nearly 12 million people.)</p>
<p>So given these revelations and disclosures, here’s my question: Does the deliberate, adversarial use of Facebook by Myanmar’s military as a platform for disinformation and propaganda take any of the heat off of Meta? After all, a sovereign country’s military is a significant adversary.</p>
<p>But here’s the thing—Alex Stamos, Facebook’s Chief Security Officer, had been trying <em>since 2016</em> to get Meta’s management and executives to acknowledge and meaningfully address the fact that Facebook was being used as host for both commercial and state-sponsored covert influence ops around the world. Including in the only place where it was likely to get the company into <em>really</em> hot water: the United States.</p>
<h2 id="oh-fuck"><span>“</span>Oh fuck”</h2>
<p>On December 16, 2016, Facebook’s newish Chief Security Officer, Alex Stamos—who now runs Stanford’s Internet Observatory—rang Meta’s biggest alarm bells by calling an emergency meeting with Mark Zuckerberg and other top-level Meta executives.</p>
<p>In that meeting, documented in Sheera Frenkel and Cecilia Kang’s book, <em>The Ugly Truth</em>, Stamos handed out a summary outlining the Russian capabilities. It read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We assess with moderate to high conﬁdence that Russian state-sponsored actors are using Facebook in an attempt to inﬂuence the broader political discourse via the deliberate spread of questionable news articles, the spread of information from data breaches intended to discredit, and actively engaging with journalists to spread said stolen information.<a href="#footnote-22UCM" id="ref-22UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span>“</span>Oh fuck, how did we miss this?” Zuckerberg responded.</p>

<p>Stamos’ team had also uncovered<span></span> <span>“</span>a huge network of false news sites on Facebook” posting and cross-promoting sensationalist bullshit, much of it political disinformation, along with examples of governmental propaganda operations from Indonesia, Turkey, and other nation-state actors. And the team had recommendations on what to do about it.</p>
<p>Frenkel and Kang paraphrase Stamos’ message to Zuckerberg (my emphasis):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Facebook needed to go on the oﬀensive. It should no longer merely monitor and analyze cyber operations; the company had to gear up for battle. But to do so required <strong>a radical change in culture and structure</strong>. Russia’s incursions were missed because departments across Facebook hadn’t communicated and because no one had taken the time to think like Vladimir Putin.<a href="#footnote-23UCM" id="ref-23UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Those changes in culture and structure didn’t happen. Stamos began to realize that to Meta’s executives, his work uncovering the foreign influence networks, and his choice to bring them to the executives’ attention, were both unwelcome and deeply inconvenient.</p>
<p>All through the spring and summer of 2017, instead of retooling to fight the massive international <em>category</em> of abuse Stamos and his colleagues had uncovered, Facebook played hot potato with the information about the ops Russia had already run.</p>
<p>On September 21, 2017, while the Tatmadaw’s genocidal<span></span> <span>“</span>clearance operations” were approaching their completion, Mark Zuckerberg finally spoke publicly about the Russian influence campaign for the first time.<a href="#footnote-24UCM" id="ref-24UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>In the intervening months, the massive covert influence networks operating in Myanmar ground along, unnoticed.</p>
<p>Thanks to Sophie Zhang, a data scientist who spent two years at Facebook fighting to get networks like the Tatmadaw’s removed, we know quite a lot about why.</p>
<h2 id="what-sophie-zhang-found">What Sophie Zhang found</h2>
<p>In 2018, Facebook hired a data scientist named Sophie Zhang and assigned her to a new team working on fake engagement—and specifically on<span></span> <span>“</span>scripted inauthentic activity,” or bot-driven fake likes and shares.</p>
<p>Within her first year on the team, Zhang began finding examples of bot-driven engagement being used for political messages in both Brazil and India ahead of their national elections. Then she found something that concerned her a lot more. <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/07/29/1030260/facebook-whistleblower-sophie-zhang-global-political-manipulation/">Karen Hao of the <span>MIT</span> Technology Review writes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The administrator for the Facebook page of the Honduran president, Juan Orlando Hernández, had created hundreds of pages with fake names and profile pictures to look just like users—and was using them to flood the president’s posts with likes, comments, and shares. (Facebook bars users from making multiple profiles but doesn’t apply the same restriction to pages, which are usually meant for businesses and public figures.)</p>
<p>The activity didn’t count as scripted, but the effect was the same. Not only could it mislead the casual observer into believing Hernández was more well-liked and popular than he was, but it was also boosting his posts higher up in people’s newsfeeds. For a politician whose 2017 reelection victory was widely believed to be fraudulent, the brazenness—and implications—were alarming.<a href="#footnote-25UCM" id="ref-25UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When Zhang brought her discovery back to the teams working on Pages Integrity and News Feed Integrity, both refused to act, either to stop fake Pages from being created, or to keep the fake engagement signals the fake Pages generate from making posts go viral.</p>
<p>But Zhang kept at it, and after a year, Meta finally removed the Honduran network. The very next day, Zhang reported a network of fake Pages in Albania. <em>The Guardian</em><span></span><span>’</span>s Julia Carrie Wong <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/apr/12/facebook-fake-engagement-whistleblower-sophie-zhang">explains what came next</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In August, she discovered and filed escalations for suspicious networks in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/azerbaijan">Azerbaijan</a>, Mexico, Argentina and Italy. Throughout the autumn and winter she added networks in the Philippines, Afghanistan, South Korea, Bolivia, Ecuador, Iraq, Tunisia, Turkey, Taiwan, Paraguay, El Salvador, India, the Dominican Republic, Indonesia, Ukraine, Poland and Mongolia.<a href="#footnote-26UCM" id="ref-26UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to Zhang, Meta eventually established a policy against<span></span> <span>“</span>inauthentic behavior,” but didn’t enforce it, and rejected Zhang’s proposal to punish repeat fake-Page creators by banning their personal accounts because of policy staff’s<span></span> <span>“</span>discomfort with taking action against people connected to high-profile accounts.”<a href="#footnote-27UCM" id="ref-27UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>Zhang discovered that even when she took initiative to track down covert influence campaigns, the teams who <em>could</em> take action to remove them didn’t—not without persistent<span></span> <span>“</span>lobbying.” So Zhang tried harder. Here’s Karen Hao again:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>She was called upon repeatedly to help handle emergencies and praised for her work, which she was told was valued and important.</p>
<p>But despite her repeated attempts to push for more resources, leadership cited different priorities. They also dismissed Zhang’s suggestions for a more sustainable solution, such as suspending or otherwise penalizing politicians who were repeat offenders. It left her to face a never-ending firehose: The manipulation networks she took down quickly came back, often only hours or days later.<span></span> <span>“</span>It increasingly felt like I was trying to empty the ocean with a colander,” she says.<a href="#footnote-28UCM" id="ref-28UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Julia Carrie Wong’s Guardian piece reveals something interesting about Zhang’s reporting chain, which is that Meta’s Vice President of Integrity, Guy Rosen, was one of the people giving her the hardest pushback.</p>
<p>Remember Internet.org, also known as Free Basics, aka Meta’s push to dominate global internet use in all those countries it would go on to<span></span> <span>“</span>deprioritize” and generally ignore?</p>
<p>Guy Rosen, Meta’s then-newish <span>VP</span> of Integrity, <em>is the guy who previously ran Internet.org</em>. He came to lead Integrity directly from being <span>VP</span> of <em>Growth</em>. Before getting acquihired by Meta, Rosen co-founded a company <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/the-guy-at-the-center-of-facebooks-misinformation-mess">The Information describes</a> as<span></span> <span>“</span>a startup that analyzed what people did on their smartphones.”<a href="#footnote-29UCM" id="ref-29UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>Meta bought that startup in 2013, nominally because it would help Internet.org. In a very on-the-nose development, Rosen’s company’s supposedly privacy-protecting <span>VPN</span> software allowed Meta to collect huge amounts of data—so much that Apple booted the app from its store.</p>
<p>So that’s Facebook’s <span>VP</span> of Integrity.</p>
<h2 id="we-simply-didnt-care-enough-to-stop-them"><span>“</span>We simply didn’t care enough to stop them”</h2>
<p>In the <em>Guardian</em>, Julia Carrie Wong reports that in the fall of 2019, Zhang discovered that the Honduras network was back up, and she couldn’t get Meta’s Threat Intelligence team to deal with it. That December, she posted an internal memo about it. Rosen responded:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Facebook had<span></span> <span>“</span>moved slower than we’d like because of prioritization” on the Honduras case, Rosen wrote.<span></span> <span>“</span>It’s a bummer that it’s back and I’m excited to learn from this and better understand what we need to do systematically,” he added. But he also chastised her for making a public [public as in within Facebook <span>—EK</span>] complaint, saying:<span></span> <span>“</span>My concern is that threads like this can undermine the people that get up in the morning and do their absolute best to try to figure out how to spend the finite time and energy we all have and put their heart and soul into it.”[31]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In a private follow-up conversation (still in December, 2019), Zhang alerted Rosen that she’d been told that the Facebook Threat Intelligence team would only prioritize fake networks affecting<span></span> <span>“</span>the US/western Europe and foreign adversaries such as Russia/Iran/etc.”</p>
<p>Rosen told her that he agreed with those priorities. Zhang pushed back (my emphasis):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I get that the US/western Europe/etc is important, but for a company with effectively unlimited resources, I don’t understand why this cannot get on the roadmap for anyone … A strategic response manager told me that <strong>the world outside the US/Europe was basically like the wild west with me as the part-time dictator in my spare time. He considered that to be a positive development because to his knowledge it wasn’t covered by anyone before</strong> he learned of the work I was doing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rosen replied,<span></span> <span>“</span>I wish resources were unlimited.”<a href="#footnote-30UCM" id="ref-30UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>I’ll quote Wong’s next passage in full:<span></span> <span>“</span>At the time, the company was about to&nbsp;<a href="https://investor.fb.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2020/Facebook-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2019-Results/default.aspx">report</a>&nbsp;annual operating profits of $23.9bn on $70.7bn in revenue. It had $54.86bn in cash on hand.”</p>
<p>In early 2020, Zhang’s managers told her she was all done tracking down influence networks—it was time she got back to hunting and erasing<span></span> <span>“</span>vanity likes” from bots instead.</p>
<p>But Zhang believed that if she stopped, no one else would hunt down big, potentially consequential covert influence networks. So she kept doing at least some of it, including advocating for action on an inauthentic Azerbaijan network that appeared to be connected to the country’s ruling party. In an internal group, she wrote that,<span></span> <span>“</span>Unfortunately, Facebook has become complicit by inaction in this authoritarian crackdown.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although we conclusively tied this network to elements of the government in early February, and have compiled extensive evidence of its violating nature, the effective decision was made not to prioritize it, effectively turning a blind eye.”<a href="#footnote-31UCM" id="ref-31UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>After those messages, Threat Intelligence decided to act on the network after all.</p>
<p>Then Meta fired Zhang for poor performance.</p>
<p>On her way out the door, Zhang posted a long exit memo—7,800 words—describing what she’d seen. Meta deleted it, so Zhang put up a password-protected version on her own website so her colleagues can see it. So Meta got Zhang’s entire website taken down and her domain deactivated. Eventually Meta got enough employee pressure that it put an edited version back up on their internal site.<a href="#footnote-32UCM" id="ref-32UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>Shortly thereafter, someone <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/facebook-ignore-political-manipulation-whistleblower-memo">leaked the memo to Buzzfeed News</a>.</p>
<p>In the memo, Zhang wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’ve found multiple blatant attempts by foreign national governments to abuse our platform on vast scales to mislead their own citizenry, and caused international news on multiple occasions. I have personally made decisions that affected national presidents without oversight, and taken action to enforce against so many prominent politicians globally that I’ve lost count.<a href="#footnote-33UCM" id="ref-33UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And:<span></span> <span>“</span>[T]he truth was, we simply didn’t care enough to stop them.”</p>
<p>On her final day at Meta, Zhang left notes for her colleagues, tallying suspicious accounts involved in political influence campaigns that needed to be investigated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There were 200 suspicious accounts still boosting a politician in Bolivia, she recorded; 100 in Ecuador, 500 in Brazil, 700 in Ukraine, 1,700 in Iraq, 4,000 in India and more than 10,000 in Mexico.<a href="#footnote-34UCM" id="ref-34UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="with-all-due-respect"><span>“</span>With all due respect”</h2>
<p>Zhang’s work at Facebook happened <em>after</em> the wrangling over Russian influence ops that Alex Stamos’ team found. And <em>after</em> the genocide in Myanmar. And <em>after</em> Mark Zuckerberg did his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/09/business/facebook-myanmar-zuckerberg.html">press-and-government tour</a> about how hard Meta tried and how much better they’d do after Myanmar.<a href="#footnote-35UCM" id="ref-35UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>It was <em>an entire calendar year</em> after the <em>New York Times</em> found the Tatmadaw’s genocide-fueling fake-Page hatefarm that Guy Rosen, Facebook’s <span>VP</span> of Integrity, told Sophie Zhang that the only coordinated fake networks Facebook would take down were the ones that affected the <span>US</span>, Western Europe, and<span></span> <span>“</span>foreign adversaries.”<a href="#footnote-36UCM" id="ref-36UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>In response to Zhang’s disclosures, Rosen later <a href="https://twitter.com/guyro/status/1305613201803943936">hopped onto Twitter</a> to deliver his personal assessment of the networks Zhang found and couldn’t get removed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With all due respect, what she’s described is fake likes—which we routinely remove using automated detection. Like any team in the industry or government, we prioritize stopping the most urgent and harmful threats globally. Fake likes is not one of them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://facebookpapers.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Ethnic-violence_Redacted.pdf">One of Frances Haugen’s disclosures</a> includes an internal memo that summarizes Meta’s actual, non-Twitter-snark awareness of the way Facebook has been hollowed out for routine use by covert influence campaigns:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We frequently observe highly-coordinated, intentional activity on the <span>FOAS</span> [Family of Apps and Services] by problematic actors, including states, foreign actors, and actors with a record of criminal, violent or hateful behaviour, aimed at promoting social violence, promoting hate, exacerbating ethnic and other societal cleavages, and/or delegitimizing social institutions through misinformation. This is particularly prevalent—and problematic—in At Risk Countries and Contexts.<a href="#footnote-37UCM" id="ref-37UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, they knew.</p>
<p>Because of Haugen’s disclosures, we also know that in 2020, for the category,<span></span> <span>“</span>Remove, reduce, inform/measure misinformation on <span>FB</span> Apps, Includes Community Review and Matching”—so, that’s moderation targeting misinformation specifically—only 13% of the total budget went to the non-US countries that provide more than 90% of Facebook’s user base, and which include <em>all</em> of those At Risk Countries. The other 87% of the budget was reserved for the 10% of Facebook users who live in the United States.<a href="#footnote-38UCM" id="ref-38UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<p>In case any of this seems disconnected with the main thread of what happened in Myanmar, here’s what (formerly Myanmar-based) researcher Victoire Rio had to say about covert coordinated influence networks in her extremely good <a href="https://toda.org/assets/files/resources/policy-briefs/t-pb-78_victoire-rio_role-of-social-media-in-fomenting-violence-myanmar.pdf">2020 case study about the role of social media in Myanmar’s violence</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bad actors spend months—if not years—building networks of online assets, including accounts, pages and groups, that allow them to manipulate the conversation. These inauthentic presences continue to present a major risk in places like Myanmar and are responsible for the overwhelming majority of problematic content.<a href="#footnote-39UCM" id="ref-39UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that Rio says that these inauthentic networks—the exact things Sophie Zhang chased down until she got fired for it—continued to present a major risk in 2020.</p>
<p>It’s time to skip ahead.</p>
<p>Let’s go to Myanmar in 2021, four years after the peak of the genocide. After everything I’ve dealt with in this whole painfully long series so far, it would be fair to assume that Meta would be prioritizing getting everything right in Myanmar. Especially after the coup.</p>


<p>In 2021, the Tatmadaw deposed Myanmar’s democratically elected government and transferred the leadership of the country to the military’s Commander-in-Chief. Since then, the military has turned the machines of surveillance, administrative repression, torture, and murder that it refined on the Rohingya and other ethnic minorities onto Myanmar’s Buddhist ethnic Bamar majority.</p>
<p><em>Also</em> in 2021, Facebook’s director of policy for <span>APAC</span> Emerging Countries, Rafael Frankel, told the Associated Press that Facebook had now<span></span> <span>“</span>built a dedicated team of over 100 Burmese speakers.”</p>
<p>This<span></span> <span>“</span>dedicated team is,” presumably, the group of contract workers employed by the Accenture-run<span></span> <span>“</span>Project Honey Badger” team in Malaysia.<a href="#footnote-40UCM" id="ref-40UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a> (Which, <em>Jesus</em>.)</p>
<p>In October of 2021, the Associated Press <a href="https://apnews.com/article/technology-business-middle-east-religion-europe-a38da3ccd40ffae7e4caa450c374f796">took a look at how that’s working out on Facebook in Myanmar</a>. Right away, they found threatening and violent posts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One 2 1/2 minute&nbsp;video&nbsp;posted on Oct.&nbsp;24 of a supporter of the military calling for violence against opposition groups has garnered over 56,000 views.</p>
<p><span>“</span>So starting from now, we are the god of death for all (of them),” the man says in Burmese while looking into the camera.<span></span> <span>“</span>Come tomorrow and let’s see if you are real men or gays.”</p>
<p>One account posts the home address of a military defector and a photo of his wife. Another post from Oct.&nbsp;29 includes a&nbsp;photo&nbsp;of soldiers leading bound and blindfolded men down a dirt path. The Burmese caption reads,<span></span> <span>“</span>Don’t catch them alive.”<a href="#footnote-41UCM" id="ref-41UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s where content moderation stood in 2021. What about the algorithmic side of things? Is Facebook still boosting dangerous messages in Myanmar?</p>
<p>In the spring of 2021, <a href="https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/digital-threats/algorithm-harm-facebook-amplified-myanmar-military-propaganda-following-coup/">Global Witness analysts made a clean Facebook account with no history</a> and searched for တပ်မ​တော်—“Tatmadaw.” They opened the top page in the results, a military fan page, and found no posts that broke Facebook’s new, stricter rules. Then they hit the<span></span> <span>“</span>like” button, which caused a pop-up with<span></span> <span>“</span>related pages” to appear. Then the team popped open up the first five recommended pages.</p>
<p>Here’s what they found:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Three of the five top page recommendations that Facebook’s algorithm suggested contained content posted after the coup that violated Facebook’s policies.</strong>&nbsp; One of the other pages had content that violated Facebook’s community standards but that was posted before the coup and therefore isn’t included in this article.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Specifically, they found messages that included:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Incitement to violence</li>
<li>Content that glorifies the suffering or humiliation of others</li>
<li>Misinformation that can lead to physical harm<a href="#footnote-42UCM" id="ref-42UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>42</sup></a></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>As well as several kinds of posts that violated&nbsp;<a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/02/an-update-on-myanmar/">Facebook’s new and more specific policies on Myanmar</a>.</p>
<p>So not only were the violent, violence-promoting posts still showing up in Myanmar four years later after the atrocities in Rakhine State—and after the Tatmadaw turned the full machinery of of its violence onto opposition members of Myanmar’s Buddhist ethnic majority—but <em>Facebook was still funneling users directly into them</em> after even the lightest engagement with anodyne pro-military content.</p>
<p><em>This is in 2021</em>, with Meta throwing vastly more resources at the problem than it ever did during the period leading up to and including the genocide of the Rohingya people. Its algorithms are making <em>active recommendations</em> by Facebook, precisely as outlined in the Meta memos in Haugen’s disclosures.</p>
<p>By any reasonable measure, I think this is a failure.</p>
<p>Meta didn’t respond to requests for comment from Global Witness, but when the <em>Guardian</em> and <span>AP</span> picked up the story, Meta got back to <em>them</em> with…this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our teams continue to closely monitor the situation in Myanmar in real-time and take action on any posts, Pages or Groups that break our rules. <strong>We proactively detect 99 percent of the hate speech removed from Facebook in Myanmar</strong>, and our ban of the Tatmadaw and repeated disruption of coordinated inauthentic behavior has made it harder for people to misuse our services to spread harm.<a href="#footnote-43UCM" id="ref-43UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>One more time: This statement <strong>says nothing about how much hate speech is removed</strong>. It’s pure misdirection.</p>
<hr>
<p>Internal Meta memos highlight ways to use Facebook’s algorithmic machinery to sharply reduce the spread of what they called<span></span> <span>“</span>high-harm misinfo.” For those potentially harmful topics, you<span></span> <span>“</span>hard demote” (aka<span></span> <span>“</span>push down” or<span></span> <span>“</span>don’t show”) reshared posts that were originally made by someone who isn’t friended or followed by the viewer. (Frances Haugen talks about this in interviews as<span></span> <span>“</span>cutting the reshare chain.”)</p>
<p>And <em>this method works</em>. In Myanmar,<span></span> <span>“</span>reshare depth demotion” reduced<span></span> <span>“</span>viral inflammatory prevalence” by 25% and cut<span></span> <span>“</span>photo misinformation” almost in half.</p>
<p>In a reasonable world, I think Meta would have decided to broaden use of this method and work on refining it to make it even more effective. What they did, though, was decide to roll it back within Myanmar as soon as the upcoming elections were over.<a href="#footnote-44UCM" id="ref-44UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
<p>The same <span>SEC</span> disclosure I just cited also notes that Facebook’s <span>AI</span> <span></span><span>“</span>classifier” for Burmese hate speech didn’t seem to be maintained or in use—and that algorithmic recommendations were still shuttling people toward violent, hateful messages that violated Facebook’s Community Standards.</p>
<p>So that’s how the algorithms were going. How about the military’s covert influence campaign?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-politics-socialmedia-insight-idAFKBN2HM3BU">Reuters reported in late 2021</a> that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As Myanmar’s military seeks to put down protest on the streets, a parallel battle is playing out on social media, with the junta using fake accounts to denounce opponents and press its message that it seized power to save the nation from election fraud…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Reuters reporters explain the military has assigned thousands of the soldiers to wage<span></span> <span>“</span>information combat” in what appears to be an expanded, distributed version of their earlier secret propaganda ops:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>“</span>Soldiers are asked to create several fake accounts and are given content segments and talking points that they have to post,” said Captain Nyi Thuta, who defected from the army to join rebel forces at the end of February.<span></span> <span>“</span>They also monitor activity online and join (anti-coup) online groups to track them.” <a href="#footnote-45UCM" id="ref-45UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>(We know this because Reuters journalists got hold of a high-placed defector from the Tatmadaw’s propaganda wing.)</p>
<p>When asked for comment, Facebook’s regional Director of Public Policy told Reuters that Meta<span></span> <span>“</span>‘proactively’ detected almost 98 percent of the hate speech removed from its platform in Myanmar.”</p>
<h2 id="wasting-our-lives-under-tarpaulin"><span>“</span>Wasting our lives under tarpaulin”</h2>
<p>The Rohingya people forced to flee Myanmar have scattered across the region, but the overwhelming majority of those who fled in 2017 ended up in the Cox’s Bazar region of Bangladesh.</p>
<p>The camps are beyond overcrowded, and they make everyone who lives in them vulnerable to the region’s seasonal flooding, to worsening climate impacts, and to waves of disease. This year, the refugees’ <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/news/stories/rohingya-refugees-face-hunger-and-loss-hope-after-latest-ration-cuts">food aid was just cut from the equivalent of $12 a month to $8 month</a>, because the international community is focused elsewhere.<a href="#footnote-46UCM" id="ref-46UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/burma-myanmar/new-cold-war-hein-myers">complex geopolitical situation surrounding post-coup Myanmar</a>—in which many western and Asian countries condemn the situation in Myanmar, but don’t act lest they push the Myanmar junta further toward China—seems likely to ensure a long, bloody conflict, with no relief in sight for the Rohingya.<a href="#footnote-47UCM" id="ref-47UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<p>The <span>UN</span> estimates that <a href="https://data.unhcr.org/en/country/bgd">more than 960,000 Rohingya refugees</a> now live in refugee camps in Bangladesh. More than half are children, few of whom have had much education at all since coming to the camps six years ago. The <span>UN</span> estimates that the refugees needed about $70.5 million for education in 2022, of which 1.6% was actually funded. <a href="#footnote-48UCM" id="ref-48UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
<p>Amnesty International spoke with Mohamed Junaid, a 23-year-old Rohingya volunteer math and chemistry teacher, who is also a refugee. He told Amnesty:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Though there were many restrictions in Myanmar, we could still do school until matriculation at least. But in the camps our children cannot do anything. We are wasting our lives under tarpaulin.<a href="#footnote-49UCM" id="ref-49UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>49</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In their report,<span></span> <span>“</span>The Social Atrocity,” Amnesty wrote that in 2020, seven Rohingya youth organizations based in the refugee camps made a formal application to Meta’s Director of Human Rights. They requested that, given its role in the crises that led to their expulsion from Myanmar, Meta provide just <em>one</em> million dollars in funding to support a teacher-training initiative within the camps—a way to give the refugee children a chance at an education that might someday serve them in the outside world.</p>
<p>Meta got back to the Rohingya youth organizations in 2021, a year in which the company cleared $39.3B in profits:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, after discussing with our teams, this specific proposal is not something that we’re able to support. As I think we noted in our call, Facebook doesn’t directly engage in philanthropic activities.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p><a href="https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/digital-threats/rohingya-facebook-hate-speech/">In 2022, Global Witness came back for one more look at Meta’s operations in Myanmar</a>, this time with eight examples of real hate speech aimed at the Rohingya—actual posts from the period of the genocide, all taken from the <span>UN</span> Human Rights Council findings I’ve been linking to so frequently in this series. They submitted these real-life examples of hate speech to Meta as Burmese-language Facebook advertisements.</p>
<p>Meta accepted all eight ads.<a href="#footnote-50UCM" id="ref-50UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>50</sup></a></p>
<p>The final post in this series, Part <span>IV</span>, will be up in about a week. Thank you for reading.</p>

						Berry is a ultra-lightweight dynamically typed embedded scripting language. It is designed for lower-performance embedded devices. The Berry interpreter-core's code size is less than 40KiB and can run on less than 4KiB heap (on ARM Cortex M4 CPU, Thumb ISA and ARMCC compiler).
					</p>
					<p>
						The interpreter of Berry include a one-pass compiler and register-based VM, all the code is written in ANSI C99. In Berry not every type is a class object. Some simple value types, such as int, real, boolean and string are not class object, but list, map and range are class object. This is a consideration about performance. Register-based VM is the same meaning as above.

						<div>
							<h2>Simple</h2>
							<p>
								Simple and natural syntax, support garbage collection, and easy to use FFI (foreign function interface).
							</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<h2>RAM saving</h2>
							<p>
								With compile-time object construction, most of the constant objects are stored in read-only code data segments, so the RAM usage of the interpreter is very low when it starts.

							<div>
								<h3>Simple and intuitive syntax</h3>
								<p>
									The Berry language syntax is similar to that of high-level languages and will be familiar to most programmers.
								</p>
							</div>
							<div>
<pre><span>var</span> list <span>= [</span> <span>"Hello"</span><span>,</span> <span>"World"</span> ]
<span>for</span> text <span>:</span> list
    <span>print</span><span>(</span>text<span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</pre>
							</div>
						</div>
						<div>
							<div>
								<h3>Map Instance</h3>
								<p>
									The map class is a built-in class type that is used to provide an unordered container of key-value pairs. Within the Berry interpreter, map map uses the Hash table to implement. You can use key-value pairs to construct a map container.
								</p>
							</div>
							<div>
<pre><span>var</span> map <span>= {</span>
    <span>'greets'</span><span>:</span> <span>def</span><span>()</span> <span>return</span> <span>'Hi!</span> <span>Berry</span><span>' </span><span>end</span> <span>()</span><span>,</span>
<span>    '</span><span>say</span><span>'   : '</span><span>Hello World</span><span>'</span><span>,</span>
<span>    '</span><span>sum</span><span>'   : </span><span>10</span> <span>+</span> <span>50</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>for</span> i <span>:</span> map<span>.</span><span>keys</span><span>()</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span>i<span>,</span> <span>"\t=&gt;"</span><span>,</span> map<span>[</span>i<span>]</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</pre>
							</div>
						</div>
						<div>
							<div>
								<h3>Object Orientation</h3>
								<p>
									To use a class, you must first declare it. The declaration of a class begins with the keyword class.
								</p>
								<p>
									The member variables and methods of the class must be specified in the declaration. This is an example of class declaration:
								</p>
							</div>
							<div>
<pre><span>import</span> <span>string</span>

<span>class</span> Parent
    <span>#- member variables  -#</span>
    <span>var</span> fname
    <span>var</span> cname

    <span>#- constructor -#</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>init</span><span>()</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span>fname <span>=</span> <span>'Darth vader'</span>
    <span>end</span>

    <span>#- Method -#</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>say</span><span>()</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>string</span><span>.</span><span>format</span><span>(</span>
            <span>'%s say</span><span>\n</span><span>%s %s'</span><span>,</span> <span>self</span><span>.</span>fname<span>,</span>
            <span>self</span><span>.</span>cname<span>,</span> <span>"i'm your father"</span>
        <span>)</span>
    <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</pre>
							</div>
						</div>
						<div>
							<div>
								<h3>Class inheritance</h3>
								<p>
									Berry only supports single inheritance, that is, a class can only have one base class, and the base class uses the operator : to declare :
								</p>
								<p>
									Here the Child class inherits from the Parent class. The subclass will inherit all the methods and properties of the Parent class, and you can override them in the subclass. This mechanism is called Overload.
								</p>
							</div>
							<div>
<pre><span>class</span> Child <span>:</span> Parent
    <span>#- constructor -#</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>init</span><span>(</span>name<span>)</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span>fname <span>=</span> <span>Parent</span><span>().</span>fname
        <span>self</span><span>.</span>cname <span>=</span> name
    <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>

child <span>=</span> <span>Child</span><span>(</span><span>'Luke'</span><span>)</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span> child<span>.</span><span>say</span><span>() )</span> <span>#child inherits from parent the say method</span>
</pre>

				<p id="speakable-summary">Brave Software, the maker of Brave Browser and Search, confirmed that it has laid off 9% of its staff across departments.</p>
<p>The company didn’t specify how many people were affected, but it corroborated the development and said the decision was driven by the tough economic climate.</p>
<p>“Brave eliminated some positions as part of our cost management in this challenging economic environment. Several departments were affected, amounting to 9% of our staff,” a company spokesperson told TechCrunch in a statement.</p>
<p>The company has been taking steps to bolster its revenue sources this year. In April, Brave Search ditched <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/28/brave-search-doesnt-use-bings-index-anymore" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bing Index to start relying on its own indexing solution</a>. In May, the company released its <a href="https://brave.com/search-api-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">own search API</a> for clients with plans starting from $3 per 1,000 queries. The API also offers different plans for AI data model training, data with storage rights, spellcheck, and autosuggest. Last month, Brave introduced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/03/privacy-focused-brave-search-launches-its-own-image-and-video-search/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">image, news, and video results</a> as a part of its Search API.</p>
<p>Brave has also been testing a native AI assistant called Leo for its browser. While it plans to make it available to all users, Brave said that Leo will have<a href="https://brave.com/leo-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> a premium tier</a> with features like higher rate limits and access to more conversation models. The company noted that this will help it pay for the cost of API access and hosting.</p>
