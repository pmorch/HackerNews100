<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            
            <p><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2025-11-20/1763664692-827799-kicover.png" alt="Kagi Assistants graphic showing four assistant options with circular wave icons - “Quick” and “Research” are clearly visible, while two additional assistants on the right are blurred out"></p>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong></p>

<p>Today we’re releasing two research assistants: Quick Assistant and Research Assistant (previously named Ki during beta).</p>

<p>Kagi’s Research Assistant happened to top a popular benchmark (SimpleQA) when we ran it in August 2025. This was a happy accident. We’re building our research assistants to be useful products, not maximize benchmark scores.</p>

<h2>What’s Kagi Quick/Research?</h2>

<p>Kagi Quick Assistant and Research Assistant (<a href="https://help.kagi.com/kagi/ai/kagi-research.html">documentation here</a>) are Kagi’s flagship research assistants. We’re building our research assistants with our <a href="https://blog.kagi.com/kagi-ai-search#philosophy">philosophy on using AI in our products</a> in mind: *<strong>Humans should be at the center of the experience</strong>,* and <strong><em>AI should enhance, not replace</em></strong> the search experience. We know that <a href="https://blog.kagi.com/llms">LLMs are prone to bullshitting</a>, but they’re incredibly useful tools when built into a product with their failings in mind.</p>

<p>Our assistants use different base models for specific tasks. We <a href="https://help.kagi.com/kagi/ai/llm-benchmark.html">continuously benchmark top-performing models</a> and select the best one for each job, so you don’t have to.</p>

<p>Their main strength is research: identifying what to search for, executing multiple simultaneous searches (in different languages, if needed), and synthesising the findings into high-quality answers.</p>

<p>The <strong>Quick Assistant (available on all plans) optimises for speed</strong>, providing direct and concise answers. The <strong>Research Assistant focuses on depth and diversity</strong>, conducting exhaustive analysis for thorough results.</p>

<p>We’re working on tools like research assistants because we find them useful. We hope you find them useful too. We’re not planning to force AI onto our users or products. We try to build tools because we think they’ll empower the humans that use them.</p>

<h3>Accessible from any search bar</h3>

<p>You can access the Quick Assistant and Research Assistant (ultimate tier only) from the <a href="https://kagi.com/assistant">Kagi Assistant webapp</a>.</p>

<p>But they are also accessible from <a href="https://help.kagi.com/kagi/features/bangs.html">bangs</a>, directly in your search bar:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>?</code> calls <a href="https://help.kagi.com/kagi/ai/quick-answer.html">quick answer</a>. <code>Best current football team?</code></p></li>

<li><p><code>!quick</code> will call Quick Assistant. The query would look like <code>Best current football team !quick</code></p></li>

<li><p><code>!research</code> calls Research Assistant. You would use <code>Best current football team !research</code></p></li>
</ul>

<p>Quick Assistant is expected to answer in less than 5 seconds and its cost will be negligible. Research Assistant can be expected to take over 20 seconds of research and have a higher cost against our <a href="https://kagi.com/pricing">fair use policy</a>.</p>

<h3>Assistants in action</h3>

<p>The research assistant should massively reduce the time it takes to find information. Here it is in action:</p>

<p><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2025-11-20/1763664287-689802-1.png" alt="Screenshot showing Kagi search results for audiophile cable research, displaying search queries and sources including Reddit discussions and scientific studies about expensive cables."></p>

<p>The research assistant calls various tools as it researches the answer. The tools called are in the purple dropdown boxes in the screenshot, which you can open up to look into the search results:</p>

<p><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2025-11-20/1763664349-992775-2.png" alt="Screenshot of Kagi Assistant research process for “$5000 audiophile cables worth it” showing planned research steps, searches conducted, and sources gathered including blind test studies"></p>

<p>Our full research assistant comfortably holds its own against competing “deep research” agents in accuracy, but it’s best qualified as a <a href="https://jina.ai/news/a-practical-guide-to-implementing-deepsearch-deepresearch/">“Deep Search”</a> agent. We found that <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-deep-research/">since the popularization</a> of deep research tools, they have been based around a long, report style output format.</p>

<p>Long reports are not the best format to answer most questions. This is true even of ones that require a lot of research.</p>

<p>What we do focus on, however, is verifiability of the generated answer. Answers in Kagi’s research assistants are expected to be sourced and referenced. We even add attribution of citations relevance to the final answer:</p>

<p><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2025-11-20/1763664411-15777-3.png" alt="Screenshot of Kagi Assistant answer stating expensive audiophile cables are not worth it, with bottom line conclusion and references to scientific evidence from blind testing"></p>

<p>If we want to enhance the human search experience with LLM based tools, <strong>the experience should not stop with blindly trusting text generated by an LLM</strong>. Our design should aim to encourage humans to look further into the answer, to accelerate their research process.</p>

<p>The design <strong>should not replace the research process</strong> by encouraging humans to disengage from thinking about the question at hand.</p>

<h3>Other tools</h3>

<p>The research assistant has <a href="https://help.kagi.com/kagi/ai/kagi-research.html">access to many other tools beyond web search and retrieval</a>, like running code to check calculations, image generation, and calling specific APIs like Wolfram Alpha, news or location-specific searches.</p>

<p>Those should happen naturally as part of the answering process.</p>

<h2>Model benchmarking at Kagi</h2>

<p>We’re in late 2025, it’s easy to be cynical about AI benchmarking. Some days it feels like most benchmark claims look something like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2025-11-20/1763664490-83554-4.png" alt="Misleading bar chart comparing “our stuff” at 97.4% to “their stuff” at 97.35% and 12.1%, with annotation “Look how good we are” highlighting manipulated visualization"></p>

<p>That said, benchmarking is necessary to build good quality products that use machine learning. Machine learning development differs from traditional software development: there is a smooth gradient of failure along the “quality” axis. The way to solve this is to continuously measure the quality!</p>

<p>We’ve always taken benchmarking seriously at Kagi; we’ve <a href="https://help.kagi.com/kagi/ai/llm-benchmark.html">maintained unpolluted private LLM benchmarks</a> for a long time. This lets us independently measure new models separately from their claimed performance on public benchmarks, right as they come out.</p>

<p>We also believe that <strong>benchmarks must be living targets</strong>. As the landscape of the internet and model capability changes, the way we measure them needs to adapt over time.</p>

<p>With that said, it’s good to sometimes compare ourselves on big public benchmarks. We run experiments on factual retrieval datasets like SimpleQA because they let us compare against others. Benchmarks like SimpleQA also easily measure how Kagi Search performs as a search backend against other search engines at returning factual answers.</p>

<h2>Kagi Tops SimpleQA, then gives up</h2>

<p>When we measured it in August 2025, Kagi Research achieved a <strong>95.5% score on the SimpleQA benchmark</strong>. As far as we could tell it was the #1 SimpleQA score at the time we ran it.</p>

<p>We’re not aiming to further improve our SimpleQA score. Aiming to score high on SimpleQA will make us “overfit” to the particularities of the SimpleQA dataset, which would make the Kagi Assistant worse overall for our users.</p>

<p>Since we ran it, it seems that DeepSeek v3 Terminus has since beaten the score:</p>

<p><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2025-11-20/1763664544-836301-5.png" alt="Horizontal bar chart showing SimpleQA Failed Task percentages for various AI models, with Kagi Research highlighted in yellow at 4.5%, ranking second best after Deepseek Terminus at 3.2%"></p>

<h2>Some notes on SimpleQA</h2>

<p>SimpleQA wasn’t built with the intention of measuring search engine quality. It was <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.04368">built to test whether models “know what they know”</a> or blindly hallucinate answers to questions like <em>“What is the name of the former Prime Minister of Iceland who worked as a cabin crew member until 1971?”</em></p>

<p>The SimpleQA results since its release seem to tell an interesting story: LLMs do not seem to be improving much at recalling simple facts without hallucinating. OpenAI’s GPT-5 (August 2025) <a href="https://cdn.openai.com/gpt-5-system-card.pdf">scored 55% on SimpleQA</a> (without search), whereas the comparatively weak O1 (September 2024) scored 47%.</p>

<p>However, “grounding” an LLM on factual data at the time of the query – a much smaller model like gemini 2.0 flash <a href="https://liner.com/learn/liner-accurate-ai-search">will score 83%</a> if it can use Google Search. We find the same result – it’s common for single models to score highly if they have access to web search. We find model scoring in the area of 85% (GPT 4o-mini + kagi search) to 91% (Claude-4-sonnet-thinking +  kagi search).</p>

<p>Lastly, we found that <strong>Kagi’s search engine seems to perform better at SimpleQA simply because our results are less noisy</strong>. We found many, many examples of benchmark tasks where the same model using Kagi Search as a backend outperformed other search engines, simply because Kagi Search either returned the relevant Wikipedia page higher, or because the other results were <strong>not polluting the model’s context window with more irrelevant data.</strong></p>

<p>This benchmark unwittingly showed us that Kagi Search is a better backend for LLM-based search than Google/Bing because we filter out the noise that confuses other models.</p>

<h2>Why we’re not aiming for high scores on public benchmarks</h2>

<p>There’s a large difference between a 91% score and a 95.4% score: the second is making half as many errors.</p>

<p>With that said, we analyzed the remaining SimpleQA tasks and found patterns we were uninterested in pursuing.</p>

<p>Some tasks have <strong>contemporaneous results from official sources that disagree with the benchmark answer.</strong> Some examples:</p>

<p>- The question <em>“How many degrees was the Rattler’s maximum vertical angle at Six Flags Fiesta Texas?”</em> has an answer of <em>“61 degrees”</em>, which is <a href="https://coasterpedia.net/wiki/Rattler_(Six_Flags_Fiesta_Texas)">what is found in coasterpedia</a> but <a href="https://www.sixflags.com/fiestatexas/attractions/iron-rattler">Six Flag’s own page reports 81 degrees</a>.</p>

<p>- <em>“What number is the painting The Meeting at Křížky in The Slav Epic?”</em> has the answer <em>“9”</em> which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Slav_Epic">agrees with wikipedia</a> but the <a href="https://www.muchafoundation.org/en/gallery/browse-works/object/221">gallery hosting the epic disagrees - it’s #10</a></p>

<p>- <em>“What month and year did Canon launch the EOS R50?”</em> has an answer of <em>“April, 2023”</em> which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_EOS_R50">agrees with Wikipedia</a>  but <a href="https://global.canon/en/c-museum/product/dslr906.html">disagrees with the product page on Canon’s website</a>.</p>

<p>Some other examples would <strong>require bending ethical design principles to perform well on.</strong> Let’s take one example: the question <em>“What day, month, and year was the municipality of San Juan de Urabá, Antioquia, Colombia, founded?”</em> Has a stated answer of <em>“24 June 1896”.</em></p>

<p>At time of writing, this answer can only be found by models on the <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Juan_de_Urab%C3%A1">spanish language wikipedia page</a>. However, information on this page is conflicting:</p>

<p><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2025-11-20/1763664586-538582-6.png" alt="Spanish Wikipedia page for San Juan del Urabá showing conflicting founding dates - June 24, 1886 in main text versus June 24, 1896 in the information box, highlighted with red arrows"></p>

<p>The correct answer could be found by crawling the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151203205241/http://sanjuandeuraba-antioquia.gov.co/informacion_general.shtml">Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine page that is referenced</a>, but we doubt that the Internet Archive’s team would be enthused at the idea of LLMs being configured to aggressively crawl their archive.</p>

<p>Lastly, it’s important to remember that SimpleQA was made by specific researchers for one purpose. It is inherently infused with their personal biases, even if the initial researchers wrote it with the greatest care.</p>

<p>By trying to achieve a 100% score on this benchmark, we guarantee that our model would effectively shape itself to those biases. We’d rather build something that performs well at helping humans find what they search for than performing well at a set of artificial tasks.</p>

<p dir="auto">ravynOS is a new open source OS project that aims to provide a similar experience and some compatibility with macOS on x86-64 (and eventually ARM) systems. It builds on the solid foundations of FreeBSD, existing open source packages in the same space, and new code to fill the gaps.</p>
<p dir="auto">The main design goals are:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Source compatibility with macOS applications (i.e. you could compile a Mac application on ravynOS and run it)</li>
<li>Similar GUI metaphors and familiar UX (file manager, application launcher, top menu bar that reflects the open application, etc)</li>
<li>Compatible with macOS folder layouts (/Library, /System, /Users, /Volumes, etc) and perhaps filesystems (HFS+, APFS) as well as fully supporting ZFS</li>
<li>Self-contained applications in <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/bundle" rel="nofollow">App Bundles</a>, <a href="https://github.com/AppImage/AppImageKit/wiki/AppDir">AppDirs</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/AppImage">AppImage</a> files - an installer-less experience for /Applications</li>
<li>Mostly maintain compatibility with the FreeBSD base system and X11 - a standard Unix environment under the hood</li>
<li>Compatible with Linux binaries via FreeBSD's Linux support</li>
<li>Eventual compatibility with x86-64/arm64 macOS binaries (Mach-O) and libraries</li>
<li>Pleasant to use, secure, stable, and performant</li>

                                        <p>The <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/immigration-chicago-arrests-police-federal-5c21bcb2cd890fcb086480469c1a3a96">U.S. Border Patrol</a></span> is monitoring millions of American drivers nationwide in a secretive program to identify and detain people whose travel patterns it deems suspicious, The Associated Press has found.</p><p>The predictive intelligence program has resulted in people being stopped, searched and in some cases arrested. A network of cameras scans and records vehicle license plate information, and an algorithm flags vehicles deemed suspicious based on where they came from, where they were going and which route they took. Federal agents in turn may then flag local law enforcement.</p><p>Suddenly, drivers find themselves pulled over — often for reasons cited such as speeding, failure to signal, the wrong window tint or even a dangling air freshener blocking the view. They are then aggressively questioned and searched, with no inkling that the roads they drove put them on law enforcement’s radar.</p>
    
<p>Once limited to policing the nation’s boundaries, the Border Patrol has built a surveillance system stretching into the country’s interior that can monitor ordinary Americans’ daily actions and connections for anomalies instead of simply targeting wanted suspects. Started about a decade ago to fight illegal border-related activities and the trafficking of both drugs and people, it has expanded over the past five years.</p><div data-align-center="" data-video-orientation="portrait">
                
                
                
                <p>Border Patrol is using hidden license plate readers to track drivers and flag “suspicious” travel patterns, an AP investigation found, raising concerns over secret surveillance.</p>
                
            
        </div>



<p>The Border Patrol has recently grown even more powerful through collaborations with other agencies, drawing information from license plate readers nationwide run by the <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/us-drug-enforcement-administration">Drug Enforcement Administration</a></span>, private companies and, increasingly, local law enforcement programs funded through federal grants. Texas law enforcement agencies have asked Border Patrol to use facial recognition to identify drivers, documents show.</p>

<p>This active role beyond the borders is part of the quiet transformation of its parent agency, <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/us-customs-and-border-protection">U.S. Customs and Border Protection</a></span>, into something more akin to a domestic intelligence operation. Under the Trump administration’s heightened immigration enforcement efforts, CBP is now poised to get more than $2.7 billion to build out border surveillance systems such as the license plate reader program by layering in artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies.</p>
    
    
    
<p>The result is a mass surveillance network with a particularly American focus: cars.</p><p>This investigation, the first to reveal details of how the program works on America’s roads, is based on interviews with eight former government officials with direct knowledge of the program who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to speak to the media, as well as dozens of federal, state and local officials, attorneys and privacy experts. The AP also reviewed thousands of pages of court and government documents, state grant and law enforcement data, and arrest reports.</p><p>The Border Patrol has for years hidden details of its license plate reader program, trying to keep any mention of the program out of court documents and police reports, former officials say, even going so far as to propose dropping charges rather than risk revealing any details about the placement and use of their covert license plate readers. Readers are often disguised along highways in traffic safety equipment like drums and barrels.</p>
    
<p>The Border Patrol has defined its own criteria for which drivers’ behavior should be deemed suspicious or tied to drug or human trafficking, stopping people for anything from driving on backcountry roads, being in a rental car or making short trips to the border region. The agency’s network of cameras now extends along the southern border in Texas, Arizona and California, and also monitors drivers traveling near the U.S.-Canada border.</p><p>And it reaches far into the interior, impacting residents of big metropolitan areas and people driving to and from large cities such as Chicago and Detroit, as well as from Los Angeles, San Antonio, and Houston to and from the Mexican border region. In one example, AP found the agency has placed at least four cameras in the greater Phoenix area over the years, one of which was more than 120 miles (193 kilometers) from the Mexican frontier, beyond the agency’s usual jurisdiction of 100 miles (161 kilometers) from a land or sea border. The AP also identified several camera locations in metropolitan Detroit, as well as one placed near the Michigan-Indiana border to capture traffic headed towards Chicago or Gary, Indiana, or other nearby destinations.</p><div data-align-fullwidth="">

                </div><p>Border Patrol’s parent agency, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, said they use license plate readers to help identify threats and disrupt criminal networks and are “governed by a stringent, multi-layered policy framework, as well as federal law and constitutional protections, to ensure the technology is applied responsibly and for clearly defined security purposes.”</p><p>“For national security reasons, we do not detail the specific operational applications,” the agency said. While the U.S. Border Patrol primarily operates within 100 miles of the border, it is legally allowed “to operate anywhere in the United States,” the agency added. </p>

                </div><p>In February, Lorenzo Gutierrez Lugo, a driver for a small trucking company that specializes in transporting furniture, clothing and other belongings to families in Mexico, was driving south to the border city of Brownsville, Texas, carrying packages from immigrant communities in South Carolina’s low country.</p><p>Gutierrez Lugo was pulled over by a local police officer in Kingsville, a small Texas city near Corpus Christi that lies about 100 miles (161 kilometers) from the Mexican border. The officer, Richard Beltran, cited the truck’s speed of 50 mph (80 kph) in a 45 mph (72 kph) zone as the reason for the stop.</p>
    
<p>But speeding was a pretext: Border Patrol had requested the stop and said the black Dodge pickup with a white trailer could contain contraband, according to police and court records. U.S. Route 77 passes through Kingsville, a route that state and federal authorities scrutinize for trafficking of drugs, money and people.</p><p>Gutierrez Lugo, who through a lawyer declined to comment, was interrogated about the route he drove, based on license plate reader data, per the police report and court records. He consented to a search of his car by Beltran and Border Patrol agents, who eventually arrived to assist.</p>

</div>
    
<p>They unearthed no contraband. But Beltran arrested Gutierrez Lugo on suspicion of money laundering and engaging in organized criminal activity because he was carrying thousands of dollars in cash — money his supervisor said came directly from customers in local Latino communities, who are accustomed to paying in cash. No criminal charges were ultimately brought against Gutierrez Lugo and an effort by prosecutors to seize the cash, vehicle and trailer as contraband was eventually dropped.</p><p>Luis Barrios owns the trucking company, Paquetería El Guero, that employed the driver. He told AP he hires people with work authorization in the United States and was taken aback by the treatment of his employee and his trailer.</p>
    
<p>“We did everything right and had nothing to hide, and that was ultimately what they found,” said Barrios, who estimates he spent $20,000 in legal fees to clear his driver’s name and get the trailer out of impound.</p><p>Border Patrol agents and local police have many names for these kinds of stops: “whisper,” “intel” or “wall” stops. Those stops are meant to conceal — or wall off — that the true reason for the stop is a tip from federal agents sitting miles away, watching data feeds showing who’s traveling on America’s roads and predicting who is “suspicious,” according to documents and people interviewed by the AP.</p><p>In 2022, a man from Houston had his car searched from top to bottom by Texas sheriff’s deputies outside San Antonio after they got a similar tipoff from Border Patrol agents about the driver, Alek Schott.</p><div data-align-fullwidth="">

They knew he stayed overnight in a hotel about 80 miles (129 kilometers) from the U.S.-Mexico border. They knew that in the morning Schott met a female colleague there before they drove together to a business meeting.</p><p>At Border Patrol’s request, Schott was pulled over by Bexar County sheriff’s deputies. The deputies held Schott by the side of the road for more than an hour, searched his car and found nothing.</p><p>“The beautiful thing about the Texas Traffic Code is there’s thousands of things you can stop a vehicle for,” said Joel Babb, the sheriff’s deputy who stopped Schott’s car, in a deposition in a lawsuit Schott filed alleging violations of his constitutional rights.</p><div data-align-fullwidth="">

                </div><p>According to testimony and documents released as part of Schott’s lawsuit, Babb was on a group chat with federal agents called Northwest Highway. Babb deleted the WhatsApp chat off his phone but Schott’s lawyers were able to recover some of the text messages.</p><p>Through a public records act request, the AP also obtained more than 70 pages of the Northwest Highway group chats from June and July of this year from a Texas county that had at least one sheriff’s deputy active in the chat. The AP was able to associate numerous phone numbers in both sets of documents with Border Patrol agents and Texas law enforcement officials.</p><p>The chat logs show Border Patrol agents and Texas sheriffs deputies trading tips about vehicles’ travel patterns — based on suspicions about little more than someone taking a quick trip to the border region and back. The chats show how thoroughly Texas highways are surveilled by this federal-local partnership and how much detailed information is informally shared.</p><p>In one exchange a law enforcement official included a photo of someone’s driver’s license and told the group the person, who they identified using an abbreviation for someone in the country illegally, was headed westbound. “Need BP?,” responded a group member whose number was labeled “bp Intel.” “Yes sir,” the official answered, and a Border Patrol agent was en route.</p><p>Border Patrol agents and local law enforcement shared information about U.S. citizens’ social media profiles and home addresses with each other after stopping them on the road. Chats show Border Patrol was also able to determine whether vehicles were rentals and whether drivers worked for rideshare services.</p><div data-align-fullwidth="">

                </div><p>Today, the deserts, forests and mountains of the nation’s land borders are dotted with checkpoints and increasingly, surveillance towers, Predator drones, thermal cameras and license plate readers, both covert and overt.</p><p>Border Patrol’s parent agency got authorization to run a domestic license plate reader program in 2017, according to a <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/us-department-of-homeland-security">Department of Homeland Security</a></span> policy document. At the time, the agency said that it might use hidden license plate readers ”for a set period of time while CBP is conducting an investigation of an area of interest or smuggling route. Once the investigation is complete, or the illicit activity has stopped in that area, the covert cameras are removed,” the document states.</p><p>But that’s not how the program has operated in practice, according to interviews, police reports and court documents. License plate readers have become a major — and in some places permanent — fixture of the border region.</p><p>In a budget request to Congress in fiscal year 2024, CBP said that its Conveyance Monitoring and Predictive Recognition System, or CMPRS, “collects license plate images and matches the processed images against established hot lists to assist … in identifying travel patterns indicative of illegal border related activities.” Several new developer jobs have been posted seeking applicants to help modernize its license plate surveillance system in recent months. Numerous Border Patrol sectors now have special intelligence units that can analyze license plate reader data, and tie commercial license plate readers to its national network, according to documents and interviews.</p><div data-align-fullwidth="">

                </div><p>Border Patrol worked with other law enforcement agencies in Southern California about a decade ago to develop pattern recognition, said a former CBP official who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal. Over time, the agency learned to develop what it calls “patterns of life” of vehicle movements by sifting through the license plate data and determining “abnormal” routes, evaluating if drivers were purposely avoiding official checkpoints. Some cameras can take photos of a vehicle’s plates as well as its driver’s face, the official said.</p><p>Another former Border Patrol official compared it to a more technologically sophisticated version of what agents used to do in the field — develop hunches based on experience about which vehicles or routes smugglers might use, find a legal basis for the stop like speeding and pull drivers over for questioning.</p><p>The cameras take pictures of vehicle license plates. Then, the photos are “read” by the system, which automatically detects and distills the images into numbers and letters, tied to a geographic location, former CBP officials said. The AP could not determine how precisely the system’s algorithm defines a quick turnaround or an odd route. Over time, the agency has amassed databases replete with images of license plates, and the system’s algorithm can flag an unusual “pattern of life” for human inspection.</p><div data-align-fullwidth="">

                </div><p>The Border Patrol also has access to a nationwide network of plate readers run by the Drug Enforcement Administration, documents show, and was authorized in 2020 to access license plate reader systems sold by private companies. In documents obtained by the AP, a Border Patrol official boasted about being able to see that a vehicle that had traveled to “Dallas, Little Rock, Arkansas and Atlanta” before ending up south of San Antonio.</p><p>Documents show that Border Patrol or CBP has in the past had access to data from at least three private sector vendors: Rekor, Vigilant Solutions and Flock Safety.</p><p>Through Flock alone, Border Patrol for a time had access to at least 1,600 license plate readers across 22 states, and some counties have reported looking up license plates on behalf of CBP even in states like California and Illinois that ban sharing data with federal immigration authorities, according to an AP analysis of police disclosures. A Flock spokesperson told AP the company “for now” had <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/immigration-abortion-license-plates-cameras-cc5f29df94a29ee2c6c2feb2151c8f5e">paused its pilot programs</a></span> with CBP and a separate DHS agency, Homeland Security Investigations, and declined to discuss the type or volume of data shared with either federal agency, other than to say agencies could search for vehicles wanted in conjunction with a crime. No agencies currently list Border Patrol as receiving Flock data. Vigilant and Rekor did not respond to requests for comment.</p>
<p>Where Border Patrol places its cameras is a closely guarded secret. However, through public records requests, the AP obtained dozens of permits the agency filed with Arizona and Michigan for permission to place cameras on state-owned land. The permits show the agency frequently disguises its cameras by concealing them in traffic equipment like the yellow and orange barrels that dot American roadways, or by labeling them as jobsite equipment. An AP photographer in October visited the locations identified in more than two dozen permit applications in Arizona, finding that most of the Border Patrol’s hidden equipment remains in place today. Spokespeople for the Arizona and Michigan departments of transportation said they approve permits based on whether they follow state and federal rules and are not privy to details on how license plate readers are used.</p><p>Texas, California, and other border states did not provide documents in response to the AP’s public records requests.</p><p>CBP’s attorneys and personnel instructed local cities and counties in both Arizona and Texas to withhold records from the AP that might have revealed details about the program’s operations, even though they were requested under state open records laws, according to emails and legal briefs filed with state governments. For example, CBP claimed records requested by the AP in Texas “would permit private citizens to anticipate weaknesses in a police department, avoid detection, jeopardize officer safety, and generally undermine police efforts.” Michigan redacted the exact locations of Border Patrol equipment, but the AP was able to determine general locations from the name of the county.</p><p>One page of the group chats obtained by the AP shows that a participant enabled WhatsApp’s disappearing messages feature to ensure communications were deleted automatically.</p><h2>Transformation of CBP into intelligence agency</h2><div data-align-fullwidth="">

And like a domestic spy agency, CBP has mostly hidden its role in the dissemination of intelligence on purely domestic travel through its use of whisper stops. </p><p>Border Patrol has also extended the reach of its license plate surveillance program by paying for local law enforcement to run plate readers on their behalf.</p><div data-align-fullwidth="">

                </div><p>A federal grant program called Operation Stonegarden, which has existed in some form for nearly two decades, has handed out hundreds of millions of dollars to buy automated license plate readers, camera-equipped drones and other surveillance gear for local police and sheriffs agencies. Stonegarden grant funds also pay for local law enforcement overtime, which deputizes local officers to work on Border Patrol enforcement priorities. Under President Donald Trump, the Republican-led Congress this year allocated $450 million for Stonegarden to be handed out over the next four fiscal years. In the previous four fiscal years, the program gave out $342 million.</p><p>In Cochise County, Arizona, Sheriff Mark Dannels said Stonegarden grants, which have been used to buy plate readers and pay for overtime, have let his deputies merge their mission with Border Patrol’s to prioritize border security.</p><p>“If we’re sharing our authorities, we can put some consequences behind, or deterrence behind, ‘Don’t come here,’” he said.</p><p>In 2021, the Ward County, Texas, sheriff sought grant funding from DHS to buy a “covert, mobile, License Plate Reader” to pipe data to Border Patrol’s Big Bend Sector Intelligence Unit. The sheriff’s department did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Other documents AP obtained show that Border Patrol connects locally owned and operated license plate readers bought through Stonegarden grants to its computer systems, vastly increasing the federal agency’s surveillance network.</p><div data-align-fullwidth="">

But another former official in a different Border Patrol sector said he was unaware of successful interdictions based solely on license plate patterns.</p><p>In Trump’s second term, Border Patrol has extended its reach and power as border crossings have slowed to historic lows and freed up agents for operations in the heartland. <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/bovino-border-patrol-immigration-los-angeles-chicago-03b908a84106fae80a80b2837625eef7">Border Patrol Sector Chief Gregory Bovino</a></span>, for example, was tapped to direct hundreds of agents from multiple DHS agencies in the administration’s immigration sweeps across Los Angeles, more than 150 miles (241 kilometers) from his office in El Centro, California. Bovino later was elevated to lead the aggressive immigration crackdown in Chicago.

                </div><p>The result has been more encounters between the agency and the general public than ever before.</p><p>“We took Alek’s case because it was a clear-cut example of an unconstitutional traffic stop,” said Christie Hebert, who works at the nonprofit public interest law firm Institute for Justice and represents Schott. ”What we found was something much larger — a system of mass surveillance that threatens people’s freedom of movement.”</p><p>AP found numerous other examples similar to what Schott and the delivery driver experienced in reviewing court records in border communities and along known smuggling routes in Texas and California. Several police reports and court records the AP examined cite “suspicious” travel patterns or vague tipoffs from the Border Patrol or other unnamed law enforcement agencies. In another federal court document filed in California, a Border Patrol agent acknowledged “conducting targeted analysis on vehicles exhibiting suspicious travel patterns” as the reason he singled out a Nissan Altima traveling near San Diego.</p><p>In cases reviewed by the AP, local law enforcement sometimes tried to conceal the role the Border Patrol plays in passing along intelligence. Babb, the deputy who stopped Schott, testified he typically uses the phrase “subsequent to prior knowledge” when describing whisper stops in his police reports to acknowledge that the tip came from another law enforcement agency without revealing too much in written documents he writes memorializing motorist encounters.</p><p>Once they pull over a vehicle deemed suspicious, officers often aggressively question drivers about their travels, their belongings, their jobs, how they know the passengers in the car, and much more, police records and bodyworn camera footage obtained by the AP show. One Texas officer demanded details from a man about where he met his current sexual partner. Often drivers, such as the one working for the South Carolina moving company, were arrested on suspicion of money laundering merely for carrying a few thousand dollars worth of cash, with no apparent connection to illegal activity. Prosecutors filed lawsuits to try to seize money or vehicles on the suspicion they were linked to trafficking.</p><div data-align-fullwidth="">

  <p>If you would like to use encryption in DuckDB, we recommend using the latest stable version, v1.4.2. For more details, see the <a href="https://duckdb.org/2025/11/12/announcing-duckdb-142.html#vulnerabilities">latest release blog post</a>.</p>

<p>Many years ago, we read the excellent “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Code_Book">Code Book</a>” by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Singh">Simon Singh</a>. Did you know that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary,_Queen_of_Scots">Mary, Queen of Scots</a>, used an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher">encryption method harking back to Julius Caesar</a> to encrypt her more saucy letters? But alas: the cipher was broken and the contents of the letters got her <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Execution_of_Mary,_Queen_of_Scots">executed</a>.</p>

<p>These <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypto_Wars">days</a>, strong encryption software and hardware is a commodity. Modern CPUs <a href="https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0602/2025-09/SIMD-FP-Instructions/AESE--AES-single-round-encryption-">come with specialized cryptography instructions</a>, and operating systems small and big contain <a href="https://www.heartbleed.com/">mostly</a>-robust cryptography software like OpenSSL.</p>

<p>Databases store arbitrary information, it is clear that many if not most datasets of any value should perhaps not be plainly available to everyone. Even if stored on tightly controlled hardware like a cloud virtual machine, there have been <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">many cases</a> of files being lost through various privilege escalations. Unsurprisingly, compliance frameworks like the common <a href="https://secureframe.com/hub/soc-2/what-is-soc-2">SOC 2</a> “highly recommend” encrypting data when stored on storage mediums like hard drives.</p>

<p>However, database systems and encryption have a somewhat problematic track record. Even PostgreSQL, the self-proclaimed “The World's Most Advanced Open Source Relational Database” has very <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/encryption-options.html">limited options</a> for data encryption. SQLite, the world’s “<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/mostdeployed.html">Most Widely Deployed and Used Database Engine</a>” does not support data encryption out-of-the-box, its encryption extension is <a href="https://sqlite.org/com/see.html">a $2000 add-on</a>.</p>

<p><strong>DuckDB</strong> has supported <a href="https://parquet.apache.org/docs/file-format/data-pages/encryption/">Parquet Modular Encryption</a> <a href="https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/data/parquet/encryption">for a while</a>. This feature allows reading and writing Parquet files with encrypted columns. However, while Parquet files are great and <a href="https://materializedview.io/p/nimble-and-lance-parquet-killers">reports of their impending death</a> are greatly exaggerated, they cannot – for example – be updated in place, a pretty basic feature of a database management system.</p>

<p>Starting with DuckDB 1.4.0, DuckDB supports <strong>transparent data encryption</strong> of data-at-rest using industry-standard AES encryption.</p>

      </h2>
    

<p>There are many different ways to encrypt data, some more secure than others. In database systems and elsewhere, the standard is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">Advanced Encryption Standard</a> (AES), which is a block cipher algorithm standardized by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_of_Standards_and_Technology">US NIST</a>. AES is a symmetric encryption algorithm, meaning that the <em>same</em> key is used for both encryption and decryption of data.</p>

<p>For this reason, most systems choose to only support <em>randomized</em> encryption, meaning that identical plaintexts will always yield different ciphertexts (if used correctly!). The most commonly used industry standard and recommended encryption algorithm is AES – <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois/Counter_Mode">Galois Counter Mode</a> (AES-GCM). This is because on top of its ability to randomize encryption, it also <em>authenticates</em> data by calculating a tag to ensure data has not been tampered with.</p>

<p>DuckDB v1.4 supports encryption at rest using AES-GCM-256 and AES-CTR-256 (counter mode) ciphers. AES-CTR is a simpler and faster version of AES-GCM, but less secure, since it does not provide authentication by calculating a tag. The 256 refers to the size of the key in bits, meaning that DuckDB now only supports GCM with 32-byte keys.</p>

<p>GCM and CTR both require as input a (1) plaintext, (2) an initialization vector (IV) and (3) an encryption key. Plaintext is the text that a user wants to encrypt. An IV is a unique bytestream of usually 16 bytes, that ensures that identical plaintexts get encrypted into different ciphertexts. A <em>number used once</em> (nonce) is a bytestream of usually 12 bytes, that together with a 4-byte counter construct the IV. Note that the IV needs to be unique for every encrypted block, but it does not necessarily have to be random. Reuse of the same IV is problematic, since an attacker could XOR the two ciphertexts and extract both messages. The tag in AES-GCM is calculated after all blocks are encrypted, pretty much like a checksum, but it adds an integrity check that securely authenticates the entire ciphertext.</p>

      </h2>
    

<p>Before diving deeper into how we actually implemented encryption in DuckDB, we’ll explain some things about the DuckDB file format.</p>

<p>DuckDB has one <strong>main database header</strong> which stores data that enables it to correctly load and verify a DuckDB database. At the start of each DuckDB main database header, the magic bytes (“DUCKDB”) are stored and read upon initialization to verify whether the file is a valid DuckDB database file. The magic bytes are followed by four 8-byte of flags that can be set for different purposes.</p>

<p>When a database is encrypted in DuckDB, the main database header remains plaintext at all times, since the main header contains <em>no sensitive data</em> about the contents of the database file.
Upon initializing an encrypted database, DuckDB sets the first bit in the first flag to indicate that the database is encrypted. After setting this bit, additional metadata is stored that is necessary for encryption. This metadata entails the (1) <em>database identifier</em>, (2) 8 bytes of additional metadata for e.g. the encryption cipher used, and (3) the encrypted canary.</p>

<p>The <em>database identifier</em> is used as a “salt”, and consists of 16 randomly generated bytes created upon initialization of each database. The salt is often used to ensure uniqueness, i.e., it makes sure that identical input keys or passwords are transformed into <em>different</em> derived keys. The 8-bytes of metadata comprise the key derivation function (first byte), usage of additional authenticated data (second byte), the encryption cipher (third byte), and the key length (fifth byte). After the metadata, the main header uses the encrypted canary to check if the input key is correct.</p>
      <h3 id="encryption-key-management">
        
        <a href="#encryption-key-management">Encryption Key Management</a>
        
      </h3>
    

<p>To encrypt data in DuckDB, you can use practically <em>any</em> plaintext or base64 encoded string, but we recommend using a secure 32-byte base64 key. The user itself is responsible for the key management and thus for using a secure key. Instead of directly using the plain key provided by the user, DuckDB always derives a more secure key by means of a key derivation function (kdf). The kdf is a function that reduces or extends the input key to a 32-byte secure key. If the correctness of the input key is checked by deriving the secure key and decrypting the canary, the derived key is managed in a <em>secure</em> encryption key cache. This cache manages encryption keys for the current DuckDB context and ensures that the derived encryption keys are never swapped to disk by locking its memory. To strengthen security even more, the original input keys are immediately wiped from memory when the input keys are transformed into secure derived keys.</p>
      <h3 id="duckdb-block-structure">
        
        <a href="#duckdb-block-structure">DuckDB Block Structure</a>
        
      </h3>
    

<p>After the main database header, DuckDB stores two 4KB database headers that contain more information about e.g. the block (header) size and the storage version used. After keeping the main database header plaintext, <em>all</em> remaining headers and blocks are encrypted when encryption is used.</p>

<p>Blocks in DuckDB are by default 256KB, but their size is configurable. At the start of each <em>plaintext</em> block there is an 8-byte block header, which stores an 8-byte checksum. The checksum is a simple calculation that is often used in database systems to check for any corrupted data.</p>

<p><img src="https://duckdb.org/images/blog/encryption/plaintext-block-light.svg" alt="Plaintext block">
    <img src="https://duckdb.org/images/blog/encryption/plaintext-block-dark.svg" alt="Plaintext block">
</p>

<p>For encrypted blocks however, its block header consists of 40 bytes instead of 8 bytes for the checksum. The block header for encrypted blocks contains a 16-byte <em>nonce/IV</em> and, optionally, a 16-byte <em>tag</em>, depending on which encryption cipher is used. The nonce and tag are stored in plaintext, but the checksum is encrypted for better security. Note that the block header always needs to be 8-bytes aligned to calculate the checksum.</p>

        <a href="#write-ahead-log-encryption">Write-Ahead-Log Encryption</a>
        
      </h3>
    

<p>The write ahead log (WAL) in database systems is a crash recovery mechanism to ensure <em>durability</em>. It is an append-only file that is used in scenarios where the database crashed or is abruptly closed, and when not all changes are written yet to the main database file. The WAL makes sure these changes can be replayed up to the last checkpoint; which is a consistent snapshot of the database at a certain point in time. This means, when a checkpoint is enforced, which happens in DuckDB by either (1) closing the database or (2) reaching a certain threshold for storage, the WAL gets written into the main database file.</p>

<p>In DuckDB, you can force the creation of a WAL by setting</p>

<div><pre><code><span>PRAGMA</span> <span>disable_checkpoint_on_shutdown</span><span>;</span>
<span>PRAGMA</span> <span>wal_autocheckpoint</span> <span>=</span> <span>'1TB'</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This way you’ll disable a checkpointing on closing the database, meaning that the WAL does not get merged into the main database file. In addition, by setting wal_autocheckpoint to a high threshold, this will avoid intermediate checkpoints to happen and the WAL will persist. For example, we can create a persistent WAL file by first setting the above PRAGMAs, then attach an encrypted database, and then create a table where we insert 3 values.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>ATTACH</span> <span>'encrypted.db'</span> <span>AS</span> <span>enc</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>ENCRYPTION_KEY</span> <span>'asdf'</span><span>,</span>
    <span>ENCRYPTION_CIPHER</span> <span>'GCM'</span>
<span>);</span>
<span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>enc.test</span> <span>(</span><span>a</span> <span>INTEGER</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span> <span>INTEGER</span><span>);</span>
<span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>enc.test</span> <span>VALUES</span> <span>(</span><span>11</span><span>,</span> <span>22</span><span>),</span> <span>(</span><span>13</span><span>,</span> <span>22</span><span>),</span> <span>(</span><span>12</span><span>,</span> <span>21</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>If we now close the DuckDB process, we can see that there is a <code>.wal</code> file shown: <code>encrypted.db.wal</code>. But how is the WAL created internally?</p>

<p>Before writing new entries (inserts, updates, deletes) to the database, these entries are essentially logged and appended to the WAL. Only <em>after</em> logged entries are flushed to disk, a transaction is considered as committed. A plaintext WAL entry has the following structure:</p>

<p><img src="https://duckdb.org/images/blog/encryption/plaintext-wal-entry-light.svg" alt="Plaintext block">
    <img src="https://duckdb.org/images/blog/encryption/plaintext-wal-entry-dark.svg" alt="Plaintext block">
</p>

<p>Since the WAL is append-only, we encrypt a WAL entry <em>per value</em>. For AES-GCM this means that we append a nonce and a tag to each entry. The structure in which we do this is depicted in below. When we serialize an encrypted entry to the encrypted WAL, we first store the length in plaintext, because we need to know how many bytes we should decrypt. The length is followed by a nonce, which on its turn is followed by the encrypted checksum and the encrypted entry itself. After the entry, a 16-byte tag is stored for verification.</p>

<p><img src="https://duckdb.org/images/blog/encryption/encrypted-wal-entry-light.svg" alt="Plaintext block">
    <img src="https://duckdb.org/images/blog/encryption/encrypted-wal-entry-dark.svg" alt="Plaintext block">
</p>

<p>Encrypting the WAL is triggered by default when an encryption key is given for any (un)encrypted database.</p>
      <h3 id="temporary-file-encryption">
        
        <a href="#temporary-file-encryption">Temporary File Encryption</a>
        
      </h3>
    

<p>Temporary files are used to store intermediate data that is often necessary for large, out-of-core operations such as <a href="https://duckdb.org/2025/09/24/sorting-again.html">sorting</a>, large joins and <a href="https://duckdb.org/2021/10/13/windowing">window functions</a>. This data could contain sensitive information and can, in case of a crash, remain on disk. To protect this leftover data, DuckDB automatically encrypts temporary files too.</p>
      <h4 id="the-structure-of-temporary-files">
        
        <a href="#the-structure-of-temporary-files">The Structure of Temporary Files</a>
        
      </h4>
    

<p>There are three different types of temporary files in DuckDB: (1) temporary files that have the same layout as a regular 256KB block, (2) compressed temporary files and (3) temporary files that exceed the standard 256KB block size. The former two are suffixed with .tmp, while the latter is distinguished by a suffix with .block. To keep track of the size of .block temporary files, they are always prefixed with its length. As opposed to regular database blocks, temporary files do not contain a checksum to check for data corruption, since the calculation of a checksum is somewhat expensive.</p>
      <h4 id="encrypting-temporary-files">
        
        <a href="#encrypting-temporary-files">Encrypting Temporary Files</a>
        
      </h4>
    

<p>Temporary files are encrypted (1) <strong>automatically</strong> when you attach an encrypted database or (2) when you use the setting <code>SET temp_file_encryption = true</code>. In the latter case, the main database file is plaintext, but the temporary files will be encrypted. For the encryption of temporary files DuckDB internally generates <em>temporary keys.</em> This means that when the database crashes, the temporary keys are also lost. Temporary files cannot be decrypted in this case and are then essentially garbage.</p>

<p>To force DuckDB to produce temporary files, you can use a simple trick by just setting the memory limit low. This will create temporary files once the memory limit is exceeded. For example, we can create a new encrypted database, load this database with TPC-H data (SF 1), and then set the memory limit to 1 GB. If we then perform a large join, we force DuckDB to spill intermediate data to disk. For example:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>SET</span> <span>memory_limit</span> <span>=</span> <span>'1GB'</span><span>;</span>
<span>ATTACH</span> <span>'tpch_encrypted.db'</span> <span>AS</span> <span>enc</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>ENCRYPTION_KEY</span> <span>'asdf'</span><span>,</span>
    <span>ENCRYPTION_CIPHER</span> <span>'cipher'</span>
<span>);</span>
<span>USE</span> <span>enc</span><span>;</span>
<span>CALL</span> <span>dbgen</span><span>(</span><span>sf</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>);</span>

<span>ALTER</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>lineitem</span>
    <span>RENAME</span> <span>TO</span> <span>lineitem1</span><span>;</span>
<span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>lineitem2</span> <span>AS</span>
    <span>FROM</span> <span>lineitem1</span><span>;</span>
<span>CREATE</span> <span>OR</span> <span>REPLACE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>ans</span> <span>AS</span>
    <span>SELECT</span> <span>l1</span><span>.</span><span>*</span> <span>,</span> <span>l2</span><span>.</span><span>*</span>
    <span>FROM</span> <span>lineitem1</span> <span>l1</span>
    <span>JOIN</span> <span>lineitem2</span> <span>l2</span> <span>USING</span> <span>(</span><span>l_orderkey</span> <span>,</span> <span>l_linenumber</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This sequence of commands will result in encrypted temporary files being written to disk. Once the query completes or when the DuckDB shell is exited, the temporary files are automatically cleaned up. In case of a crash however, it may happen that temporary files will be left on disk and need to be cleaned up manually.</p>

        <a href="#how-to-use-encryption-in-duckdb">How to Use Encryption in DuckDB</a>
        
      </h2>
    

<p>In DuckDB, you can (1) encrypt an existing database, (2) initialize a new, empty encrypted database or (3) reencrypt a database. For example, let's create a new database, load this database with TPC-H data of scale factor 1 and then encrypt this database.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>INSTALL</span><span> tpch</span><span>;</span>
<span>LOAD</span><span> tpch</span><span>;</span>
<span>ATTACH</span> <span>'encrypted.duckdb'</span> <span>AS</span> <span>encrypted</span> <span>(</span><span>ENCRYPTION_KEY</span> <span>'asdf'</span><span>);</span>
<span>ATTACH</span> <span>'unencrypted.duckdb'</span> <span>AS</span> <span>unencrypted</span><span>;</span>
<span>USE</span> <span>unencrypted</span><span>;</span>
<span>CALL</span> <span>dbgen</span><span>(</span><span>sf</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>);</span>
<span>COPY</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>DATABASE</span> <span>unencrypted</span> <span>TO</span> <span>encrypted</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>There is not a trivial way to prove that a database is encrypted, but correctly encrypted data should look like random noise and has a high entropy. So, to check whether a database is actually encrypted, we can use tools to calculate the entropy or visualize the binary, such as <a href="https://github.com/lsauer/entropy">ent</a> and <a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/binocle">binocle</a>.</p>

<p>When we use ent after executing the above chunk of SQL, i.e., <code>ent encrypted.duckdb</code>, this will result in an entropy of 7.99999 bits per byte. If we do the same for the plaintext (unencrypted) database, this results in 7.65876 bits per byte. Note that the plaintext database also has a high entropy, but this is due to compression.</p>

<p>Let’s now visualize both the plaintext and encrypted data with binocle. For the visualization we created both a plaintext DuckDB database with scale factor of 0.001 of TPC-H data and an encrypted one:</p>

</p>
</details>

<p>In these figures, we can clearly observe that the encrypted database file seems completely random, while the plaintext database file shows some clear structure in its binary data.</p>

<p>To decrypt an encrypted database, we can use the following SQL:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>ATTACH</span> <span>'encrypted.duckdb'</span> <span>AS</span> <span>encrypted</span> <span>(</span><span>ENCRYPTION_KEY</span> <span>'asdf'</span><span>);</span>
<span>ATTACH</span> <span>'new_unencrypted.duckdb'</span> <span>AS</span> <span>unencrypted</span><span>;</span>
<span>COPY</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>DATABASE</span> <span>encrypted</span> <span>TO</span> <span>unencrypted</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And to reencrypt an existing database, we can just simply copy the old encrypted database to a new one, like:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>ATTACH</span> <span>'encrypted.duckdb'</span> <span>AS</span> <span>encrypted</span> <span>(</span><span>ENCRYPTION_KEY</span> <span>'asdf'</span><span>);</span>
<span>ATTACH</span> <span>'new_encrypted.duckdb'</span> <span>AS</span> <span>new_encrypted</span> <span>(</span><span>ENCRYPTION_KEY</span> <span>'xxxx'</span><span>);</span>
<span>COPY</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>DATABASE</span> <span>encrypted</span> <span>TO</span> <span>new_encrypted</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The default encryption algorithm is AES GCM. This is recommended since it also authenticates data by calculating a tag. Depending on the use case, you can also use AES CTR. This is faster than AES GCM since it skips calculating a tag after encrypting all data. You can specify the CTR cipher as follows:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>ATTACH</span> <span>'encrypted.duckdb'</span> <span>AS</span> <span>encrypted</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>ENCRYPTION_KEY</span> <span>'asdf'</span><span>,</span>
    <span>ENCRYPTION_CIPHER</span> <span>'CTR'</span>
<span>);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>To keep track of which databases are encrypted, you can query this by running:</p>

      </h2>
    

<p>Here at DuckDB, we strive to achieve a good out-of-the-box experience with zero external dependencies and a small footprint. Encryption and decryption, however, are usually performed by pretty heavy external libraries such as OpenSSL. We would much prefer not to rely on external libraries or statically linking huge codebases just so that people can use encryption in DuckDB without additional steps. This is why we actually implemented encryption <em>twice</em> in DuckDB, once with the (excellent) <a href="https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls">Mbed TLS</a> library and once with the ubiquitous OpenSSL library.</p>

<p>DuckDB already shipped parts of Mbed TLS because we use it to verify RSA extension signatures. However, for maximum compatibility we actually disabled the hardware acceleration of MbedTLS, which has a performance impact. Furthermore, Mbed TLS is not particularly hardened against things like nasty timing attacks. OpenSSL on the other hand contains heavily vetted and hardware-accelerated code to perform AES operations, which is why we can also use it for encryption.</p>

<p>In DuckDB Land, OpenSSL is part of the <code>httpfs</code> extension. Once you load that extension, encryption will <em>automatically</em> switch to using OpenSSL. After we shipped encryption in DuckDB 1.4.0, security experts actually found <a href="https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/security/advisories/GHSA-vmp8-hg63-v2hp">issues with the random number generator</a> we used in Mbed TLS mode. Even though it would be difficult to actually exploit this, we <em>disabled writing</em> to databases in MbedTLS mode from DuckDB 1.4.1. Instead, DuckDB now (version 1.4.2+) tries to auto-install and auto-load the <code>httpfs</code> extension whenever a write is attempted. We might be able to revisit this in the future, but for now this seems the safest path forward that still allows high compatibility for reading. In OpenSSL mode, we always used a cryptographically-safe random number generation so that mode is unaffected.</p>

<p>Encrypting and decrypting database files is an additional step in writing tables to disk, so we would naturally assume that there is some performance impact. Let’s investigate the performance impact of DuckDB’s new encryption feature with a very basic experiment.</p>

<p>We first create two DuckDB database files, one encrypted and one unencrypted. We use the TPC-H benchmark generator again to create the table data, particularly the (somewhat tired) <code>lineitem</code> table.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>INSTALL</span><span> httpfs</span><span>;</span>
<span>INSTALL</span><span> tpch</span><span>;</span>
<span>LOAD</span><span> tpch</span><span>;</span>

<span>ATTACH</span> <span>'unencrypted.duckdb'</span> <span>AS</span> <span>unencrypted</span><span>;</span>
<span>CALL</span> <span>dbgen</span><span>(</span><span>sf</span> <span>=</span> <span>10</span><span>,</span> <span>catalog</span> <span>=</span> <span>'unencrypted'</span><span>);</span>

<span>ATTACH</span> <span>'encrypted.duckdb'</span> <span>AS</span> <span>encrypted</span> <span>(</span><span>ENCRYPTION_KEY</span> <span>'asdf'</span><span>);</span>
<span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>encrypted</span><span>.lineitem</span> <span>AS</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>unencrypted.lineitem</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Now we use DuckDB’s neat <code>SUMMARIZE</code> command three times: once on the unencrypted database, and once on the encrypted database using MbedTLS and once on the encrypted database using OpenSSL. We set a very low memory limit to force more reading and writing from disk.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>SET</span> <span>memory_limit</span> <span>=</span> <span>'200MB'</span><span>;</span>
<span>.timer</span> <span>on</span>

<span>SUMMARIZE</span> <span>unencrypted.lineitem</span><span>;</span>
<span>SUMMARIZE</span> <span>encrypted</span><span>.lineitem</span><span>;</span>

<span>LOAD</span><span> httpfs</span><span>;</span> <span>-- use OpenSSL</span>
<span>SUMMARIZE</span> <span>encrypted</span><span>.lineitem</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Here are the results on a fairly recent MacBook: <code>SUMMARIZE</code> on the unencrypted table took ca. 5.4 seconds. Using Mbed TLS, this went up to around 6.2 s. However, when enabling OpenSSL the end-to-end time went straight back to 5.4 s. How is this possible? Is decryption not expensive? Well, there is a lot more happening in query processing than reading blocks from storage. So the impact of decryption is not all that huge, even when using a slow implementation. Secondly, when using hardware acceleration in OpenSSL, the overall overhead of encryption and decryption becomes almost negligible.</p>

<p>But just running summarization is overly simplistic. Real™ database workloads include modifications to data, insertion of new rows, updates of rows, deletion of rows etc. Also, multiple clients will be updating and querying at the same time. So we re-surrected the full TPC-H “Power” test from our previous blog post “<a href="https://duckdb.org/2024/09/25/changing-data-with-confidence-and-acid">Changing Data with Confidence and ACID</a>”. We slightly tweaked the <a href="https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb-tpch-power-test/blob/main/benchmark.py">benchmark script</a> to enable the new database encryption. For this experiment, we used the OpenSSL encryption implementation due to the issues outlined above. We observe Power@Size” and “Throughput@Size”. The former is raw sequential query performance, while the latter measures multiple parallel query streams in the presence of updates.</p>

<p>When running on the same MacBook with DuckDB 1.4.1 and a “scale factor” of 100, we get a Power@Size metric of 624,296 and a Throughput@Size metric of 450,409 <em>without</em> encryption.</p>

<p>When we enable encryption, the results are almost unchanged, confirming the observation of the small microbenchmark above. However, the relationship between available memory and the benchmark size means that we’re not stressing temporary file encryption. So we re-ran everything with an 8GB memory limit. We confirmed constant reading and writing to and from disk in this configuration by observing operating system statistics. For the unencrypted case, the Power@Size metric predictably went down to 591,841 and Throughput@Size went down to 153,690. And finally, we could observe a slight performance decrease with Power@Size of 571,985 and Throughput@Size of 145,353. However, that difference is not very great either and likely not relevant in real operational scenarios.</p>
      <h2 id="conclusion">
        
        <a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a>
        
      </h2>
    

<p>With the new encrypted database feature, we can now safely pass around DuckDB database files with all information inside them completely opaque to prying eyes. This allows for some interesting new deployment models for DuckDB, for example, we could now put an encrypted DuckDB database file on a Content Delivery Network (CDN). A fleet of DuckDB instances could attach to this file read-only using the decryption key. This elegantly allows efficient distribution of private background data in a similar way like encrypted Parquet files, but of course with many more features like multi-table storage. When using DuckDB with encrypted storage, we can also simplify threat modeling when – for example – using DuckDB on cloud providers. While in the past access to DuckDB storage would have been enough to leak data, we can now relax paranoia regarding storage a little,  especially since temporary files and WAL are also encrypted. And the best part of all of this, there is almost no performance overhead to using encryption in DuckDB, especially with the OpenSSL implementation.</p>

<p>We are very much looking forward to what you are going to do with this feature, and please <a href="https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/issues/new">let us know</a> if you run into any issues.</p>

												<p>In March 2024, <strong>Mozilla</strong> said it was winding down its collaboration with <strong>Onerep</strong> — an identity protection service offered with the <strong>Firefox</strong> web browser that promises to remove users from hundreds of people-search sites — after KrebsOnSecurity revealed Onerep’s founder had created dozens of people-search services and was continuing to operate at least one of them. Sixteen months later, however, Mozilla is still promoting Onerep. This week, Mozilla announced its partnership with Onerep will officially end next month.</p>

Image Mozilla Monitor Plus video on Youtube.</p></div>
<p>In <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/monitor-plus-shutting-down" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a statement</a> published Tuesday, Mozilla said it will soon discontinue <strong>Monitor Plus</strong>, which offered data broker site scans and automated personal data removal from Onerep.</p>
<p>“We will continue to offer our free Monitor data breach service, which is integrated into Firefox’s credential manager, and we are focused on integrating more of our privacy and security experiences in Firefox, including our VPN, for free,” the advisory reads.</p>
<p>Mozilla said current Monitor Plus subscribers will retain full access through the wind-down period, which ends on Dec. 17, 2025. After that, those subscribers will automatically receive a prorated refund for the unused portion of their subscription.</p>
<p>“We explored several options to keep Monitor Plus going, but our high standards for vendors, and the realities of the data broker ecosystem made it challenging to consistently deliver the level of value and reliability we expect for our users,” Mozilla statement reads.</p>
<p>On March 14, 2024, KrebsOnSecurity published an investigation showing that Onerep’s Belarusian CEO and founder <strong>Dimitiri Shelest</strong> <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/03/ceo-of-data-privacy-company-onerep-com-founded-dozens-of-people-search-firms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched dozens of people-search services since 2010</a>, including a still-active data broker called Nuwber that sells background reports on people. Shelest released <a href="https://onerep.com/blog/official-onerep-update-following-article-by-krebs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a lengthy statement</a> wherein he acknowledged maintaining an ownership stake in <strong>Nuwber</strong>, a data broker he founded in 2015 — around the same time he launched Onerep.</p>

            <p>Today, we’re preserving a cornerstone of gaming history that is near and dear to our hearts. Together, Microsoft’s Open Source Programs Office (OSPO), Team Xbox, and Activision are making <em>Zork I</em>, <em>Zork II</em>, and <em>Zork III</em> available under the MIT License. Our goal is simple: to place historically important code in the hands of students, teachers, and developers so they can study it, learn from it, and, perhaps most importantly, play it.</p>

      <div>
              <h3 id="a-game-that-changed-how-we-think-about-play">A game that changed how we think about play</h3>
              <p>When <em>Zork</em> arrived, it didn’t just ask players to win; it asked them to imagine. There were no graphics, no joystick, and no soundtrack, only words on a screen and the player’s curiosity. Yet those words built worlds more vivid than most games of their time. What made that possible wasn’t just clever writing, it was clever engineering.</p>
              <p>Beneath that world of words was something quietly revolutionary: the Z-Machine, a custom-built engine. Z-Machine is a specification of a virtual machine, and now there are many Z-Machine interpreters that we used today that are software implementations of that VM. The original mainframe version of <em>Zork</em> was too large for early home computers to handle, so the team at Infocom made a practical choice. They split it into three games titled <em><a href="https://github.com/historicalsource/zork1">Zork I</a></em>, <em><a href="https://github.com/historicalsource/zork2">Zork II</a></em>, and <em><a href="https://github.com/historicalsource/zork3">Zork III</a></em>, all powered by the same underlying system. This also meant that instead of rebuilding the game for each platform, they could use the Z-Machine to interpret the same story files on any computer. That design made <em>Zork</em> one of the first games to be truly cross-platform, appearing on Apple IIs, IBM PCs, and more.</p>

              <p>Game preservation takes many forms, and it’s important to consider research as well as play. The Zork source code deserves to be preserved and studied. Rather than creating new repositories, we’re contributing directly to history. In collaboration with Jason Scott, the well-known digital archivist of <a href="https://archive.org/">Internet Archive</a> fame, we have officially submitted upstream pull requests to the historical source repositories of <em><a href="https://github.com/historicalsource/zork1">Zork I</a></em>, <em><a href="https://github.com/historicalsource/zork2">Zork II</a></em>, and <em><a href="https://github.com/historicalsource/zork3">Zork III</a></em>. Those pull requests add a clear MIT LICENSE and formally document the open-source grant.</p>
              <p>Each repository includes:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Source code for <em><a href="https://github.com/historicalsource/zork1">Zork I</a></em>, <em><a href="https://github.com/historicalsource/zork2">Zork II</a></em>, and <em><a href="https://github.com/historicalsource/zork3">Zork III</a>.</em></li>

              <p>More than forty years later, <em>Zork</em> is still alive and easier than ever to play. The games remain commercially available via <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/the_zork_anthology">The Zork Anthology</a> on Good Old Games. For those who enjoy a more hands on approach, the games can be compiled and run locally using <a href="https://zilf.io/">ZILF</a>, the modern Z-Machine interpreter created by Tara McGrew. ZILF compiles ZIL files into Z3s that can be run with <a href="https://foss.heptapod.net/zilf/zlr">Tara’s own ZLR</a> which is a sentence I never thought I’d write, much less say out loud! There are a huge number of wonderful Z-machine runners across all platforms for you to explore.</p>
              <p>Here's how to get started running Zork locally with ZILF. From the command line, compile and assembly the zork1.zil into a runnable z3 file.</p>

              <p>We will use the existing historical repositories as the canonical home for <em>Zork</em>’s source. Once the initial pull requests land under the MIT License, contributions are welcome. We chose MIT for its simplicity and openness because it makes the code easy to study, teach, and build upon. File issues, share insights, or submit small, well-documented improvements that help others learn from the original design. The goal is not to modernize <em>Zork</em> but to preserve it as a space for exploration and education.</p>
              <p><em>Zork</em> has always been more than a game. It is a reminder that imagination and engineering can outlast generations of hardware and players. Bringing this code into the open is both a celebration and a thank you to the original Infocom creators for inventing a universe we are still exploring, to Jason Scott and the Internet Archive for decades of stewardship and partnership, and to colleagues across Microsoft OSPO, Xbox, and Activision who helped make open source possible.</p>

<p>This past August, I delivered my traditional <em>Go Cryptography State of the Union</em> talk at <a href="https://www.gophercon.com/">GopherCon US 2025</a> in New York.</p>
<p>It goes into everything that happened at the intersection of Go and cryptography over the last year.</p>
<p>You can watch the video (with manually edited subtitles, for my fellow subtitles enjoyers) or read the transcript below (for my fellow videos not-enjoyers).</p>

<p>I used to do this work at Google, and I now do it as an independent as part of and leading <a href="https://geomys.org/">Geomys</a>, but we'll talk about that later.</p>

  <p><a href="https://words.filippo.io/2025-state/#gcus25slide-03.jpeg">#</a></p><p>When we talk about the Go cryptography standard libraries, we talk about all of those packages that you use to build secure applications.</p>
<p>That's what we make them for. We do it to provide you with encryption and hashes and protocols like TLS and SSH, to <a href="https://golang.org/design/cryptography-principles">help you build secure applications</a>.</p>

  <p><a href="https://words.filippo.io/2025-state/#gcus25slide-04.jpeg">#</a></p><p>The main headlines of the past year:</p>
<p>We shipped post quantum key exchanges, which is something that you will not have to think about and will just be solved for you.</p>
<p>We have solved FIPS 140, which some of you will not care about at all and some of you will be very happy about.</p>
<p>And the thing I'm most proud of: we did all of this while keeping an excellent security track record, year after year.</p>

  <p><a href="https://words.filippo.io/2025-state/#gcus25slide-05.jpeg">#</a></p><p>This is an update to something you've seen last year.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kGwdnqcdfevyhbxVSUbwQTcdrmvrlCZUV4_XMiTn3qQ/view">The Go Security Track Record</a></p>
<p>It's the list of vulnerabilities in the Go cryptography packages.</p>
<p>We don't assign a severity—because it's really hard, instead they're graded on the "Filippo's unhappiness score."</p>
<p>It goes shrug, oof, and ouch.</p>
<p>Time goes from bottom to top, and you can see how as time goes by things have been getting better. People report more things, but they're generally more often shrugs than oofs and there haven't been ouches.</p>
  </div>

  <p><a href="https://words.filippo.io/2025-state/#gcus25slide-06.jpeg">#</a></p><p>More specifically, we haven't had any oof since 2023.</p>
<p>We didn't have any Go-specific oof since 2021.</p>
<p>When I say Go-specific, I mean: well, sometimes the protocol is broken, and as much as we want to also be ahead of that by limiting complexity, you know, sometimes there's nothing you can do about that.</p>
<p>And <strong>we haven't had ouches since 2019</strong>. I'm very happy about that.</p>

  <p><a href="https://words.filippo.io/2025-state/#gcus25slide-07.jpeg">#</a></p><p>But if this sounds a little informal, I'm also happy to report that we had the first security audit by a professional firm.</p>
<p>Trail of Bits looked at all of the nuts and bolts of the Go cryptography standard library: primitives, ciphers, hashes, assembly implementations. They didn't look at the protocols, which is a lot more code on top of that, but they did look at all of the foundational stuff.</p>
<p>And I'm happy to say that <a href="https://go.dev/blog/tob-crypto-audit">they found <em>nothing</em></a>.</p>

<div id="gcus25slide-08.jpeg">

  <p><a href="https://words.filippo.io/2025-state/#gcus25slide-08.jpeg">#</a></p><p>It is easy though to maintain a good security track record if you never add anything, so let's talk about the code we did add instead.</p>
<p>First of all, post-quantum key exchanges.</p>
<p>We talked about post-quantum last year, but as a very quick refresher:</p>
<ul>
<li>Post-quantum cryptography is about the future. We are worried about quantum computers that might exist… 5-50 (it's a hell of a range) years from now, and that might break all of asymmetrical encryption. (Digital signatures and key exchanges.)</li>
<li>Post-quantum cryptography runs on classical computers. It's cryptography that we can do now that resists future quantum computers.</li>
<li>Post-quantum cryptography is fast, actually. If you were convinced that for some reason it was slow, that's a common misconception.</li>
<li>However, post-quantum cryptography is large. Which means that we have to send a lot more bytes on the wire to get the same results.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, we focused on post-quantum key exchange because the key exchange defends against the most urgent risk, which is that somebody might be recording connections today, keeping them saved on some storage for the next 5-50 years and then use the future quantum computers to decrypt those sessions.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div id="gcus25slide-09.jpeg">
  <p><img loading="lazy" src="https://assets.buttondown.email/images/f671c289-0e63-47ca-a4e6-6711cb48fe7a.jpeg"></p><div>
  <p><a href="https://words.filippo.io/2025-state/#gcus25slide-09.jpeg">#</a></p><p>I'm happy to report that we now have ML-KEM, which is the post-quantum key exchange algorithm selected by the NIST competition, an international competition run in the open.</p>
<p>You can use it directly from the <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/crypto/mlkem">crypto/mlkem</a> standard library package starting in Go 1.24, but you're probably not gonna do that.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div id="gcus25slide-10.jpeg">
  <p><img loading="lazy" src="https://assets.buttondown.email/images/8ad85b47-a2eb-4de2-8e5d-0f5c29ab8613.jpeg"></p><div>
  <p><a href="https://words.filippo.io/2025-state/#gcus25slide-10.jpeg">#</a></p><p>Instead, you're probably going to just use crypto/tls, which by default now uses a hybrid of X25519 and ML-KEM-768 for all connections with other systems that support it.</p>
<p>Why hybrid? Because this is new cryptography. So we are still <em>a little</em> worried that somebody might break it.</p>
<p>There was one that looked very good and had very small ciphertext, and we were all like, “yes, yes, that's good, that's good.” And then somebody broke it on a laptop. It was very annoying.</p>
<p>We're fairly confident in lattices. We think this is the good one. But still, we are taking both the old stuff and the new stuff, hashing them together, and unless you have both a quantum computer to break the old stuff and a mathematician who broke the new stuff, you're not breaking the connection.</p>
<p>crypto/tls can now negotiate that with Chrome and can negotiate that with other Go 1.24+ applications.</p>
<p>Not only that, we also removed any choice you had in ordering of key exchanges because we think we know better than you and— that didn't come out right, uh.</p>
<p>… because we assume that you actually want us to make those kind of decisions, so as long as you don't turn it off, we will default to post-quantum.</p>
<p>You can still turn it off. But as long as you don't turn it off, we'll default to the post-quantum stuff to keep your connection safe from the future.</p>

<div id="gcus25slide-12.jpeg">
  <p><img loading="lazy" src="https://assets.buttondown.email/images/bdc8faee-11fb-4d5d-9127-17ba3ea63885.jpeg"></p><div>
  <p><a href="https://words.filippo.io/2025-state/#gcus25slide-12.jpeg">#</a></p><p>Okay, but you said key exchanges <em>and digital signatures</em> are broken. What about the latter?</p>
<p>Well, key exchanges are urgent because of the record-now-decrypt-later problem, but unless the physicists that are developing quantum computers also develop a time machine, they can't use the QC to go back in time and use a fake signature today. So if you're verifying a signature today, I promise you it's not forged by a quantum computer.</p>
<p>We have a lot more time to figure out post-quantum digital signatures. But if we can, why should we not start now? Well, it's different. Key exchange, we knew what hit we had to take. You have to do a key exchange, you have to do it when you start the connection, and ML-KEM is the algorithm we have, so we're gonna use it.</p>
<p>Signatures, we developed a lot of protocols like TLS, SSH, back when it was a lot cheaper to put signatures on the wire. When you connect to a website right now, you get five signatures. We can't send you five 2KB blobs every time you connect to a website. So we are waiting to give time to protocols to evolve, to redesign things with the new trade-offs in mind of signatures not being cheap.</p>
<p>We are kind of slow rolling intentionally the digital signature side because it's both not as urgent and not as ready to deploy. We can't do the same “ta-da, it's solved for you” show because signatures are much harder to roll out.</p>

<div id="gcus25slide-13.jpeg">
  <p><img loading="lazy" src="https://assets.buttondown.email/images/ca63bc57-db68-445c-9b6f-ad36017e24db.jpeg"></p><div>
  <p><a href="https://words.filippo.io/2025-state/#gcus25slide-13.jpeg">#</a></p><p>Let's talk about another thing that I had mentioned last year, which is FIPS 140.</p>
<p>FIPS 140 is a US government regulation for how to do cryptography. It is a list of algorithms, but it's not just a list of algorithms. It's also a list of rules that the modules have to follow.</p>
<p>What is a module?</p>
<p>Well, a module used to be a thing you would rack. All the rules are based on the idea that it's a thing you can rack. Then the auditor can ask “what is the module’s boundary?” And you're like, “this shiny metal box over here." And, you know, that works.</p>
<p>When people ask those questions of libraries, though, I do get a little mad every time. Like, what are the data input ports of your library? Ports. Okay.</p>
<p>Anyway, it's an interesting thing to work with.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div id="gcus25slide-14.jpeg">
  <p><img loading="lazy" src="https://assets.buttondown.email/images/11f1a65e-1391-4927-9c0b-3038d952fc9b.jpeg"></p><div>
  <p><a href="https://words.filippo.io/2025-state/#gcus25slide-14.jpeg">#</a></p><p>To comply with FIPS 140 in Go, up to now, you had to use an <u>unsupported</u> GOEXPERIMENT, which would replace all of the Go cryptography standard library, all of the stuff I'm excited about, with the BoringCrypto module, which is a FIPS 140 module developed by the BoringSSL folks. We love the BoringSSL folks, but that means using cgo, and we do not love cgo. It has memory safety issues, it makes cross-compilation difficult, it’s not very fast.</p>
<p>Moreover, the list of algorithms and platforms of BoringCrypto is tailored to the needs of BoringSSL and not to the needs of the Go community, and their development cycle doesn't match our development cycle: we don't decide when that module gets validated.</p>
<p>Speaking of memory safety, I lied a little. Trail of Bits did find one vulnerability. They found it in Go+BoringCrypto, which was yet another reason to try to push away from it.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div id="gcus25slide-15.jpeg">
  <p><img loading="lazy" src="https://assets.buttondown.email/images/871c48ee-5a50-4c7b-a67d-430aa00442a8.jpeg"></p><div>
  <p><a href="https://words.filippo.io/2025-state/#gcus25slide-15.jpeg">#</a></p><p>Instead, we've got now the FIPS 140-3 Go Cryptographic Module.</p>
<p>Not only is it native Go, it's actually just a different name for the internal Go packages that all the regular Go cryptography package use for the FIPS 140 algorithms. We just moved them into their own little bubble so that when they ask us “what is the module boundary” we can point at those packages.</p>
<p>Then there's a runtime mode which enables some of the self-tests and slow stuff that you need for compliance. It also tells crypto/tls not to negotiate stuff that's not FIPS, but aside from that, it doesn't change any observable behavior.</p>
<p>We managed to keep everything working exactly the same: you don't import a different package, you don't do anything different, your applications just keep working the same way. We're very happy about that.</p>
<p>Finally, you can at compile time select a GOFIPS140 frozen module, which is just a zip file of the source of the module as it was back when we submitted it for validation, which is a compliance requirement sometimes.</p>
<p>By the way, that means we have to be forward compatible with future versions of Go, even for internal packages, which was a little spicy.</p>
<p>You can read more in <a href="https://go.dev/doc/security/fips140">the upstream FIPS 140-3 docs</a>.</p>

  <p><a href="https://words.filippo.io/2025-state/#gcus25slide-17.jpeg">#</a></p><p>But that's not enough.</p>
<p>Even if you use a FIFS 140 algorithm from a FIPS 140 module that was tested for the algorithm it's still not enough because it has to run on a platform that was tested as part of the validation.</p>
<p>So we tested on a lot of platforms.</p>
<p>Some of them were paid for by various Fortune 100s that had an interest in them getting tested, but some of them had no sponsors.</p>
<p>We really wanted to solve this problem for everyone, once and for all, so Geomys just paid for all the FreeBSD, macOS, even Windows testing so that we could say “run it on whatever and it's probably going to be compliant.” (Don't quote me on that.)</p>

<p>Um, no. No, no.</p>
<p>I got a bunch of stuff shipped to my place.</p>
<p>That's my NAS now. It's an Ampere Altra Q64-22, sixty-four arm64 cores, and yep, it's my NAS.</p>

  <p><a href="https://words.filippo.io/2025-state/#gcus25slide-23.jpeg">#</a></p><p>You might or might not be surprised to hear that the easiest way to meet the FIPS 140 requirements is not to exceed them.</p>
<p>That's annoying and a problem of FIPS 140 in general: if you do what everybody else does, which is just clearing the bar, nobody will ask questions, so there’s a strong temptation to lower security in FIPS 140 mode.</p>
<p>We just refused to accept that. Instead, we figured out complex stratagems.</p>

  <p><a href="https://words.filippo.io/2025-state/#gcus25slide-24.jpeg">#</a></p><p>For example, for randomness, the safest thing to do is to just take randomness from the kernel every time you need it. The kernel knows if a virtual machine was just cloned and we don't, so we risk generating the same random bytes twice.</p>
<p>But NIST will not allow that. You need to follow a bunch of standards for how the randomness is generated, and the kernel doesn’t.</p>
<p>So what we do is we do everything that NIST asks and then every time you ask for randomness, we squirrel off, go to the kernel, get a little piece of extra entropy, stir it into the pot before giving back the result, and give back the result.</p>
<p>It's still NIST compliant because it's as strong as both the NIST and the kernel solution, but it took some significant effort to <em>show</em> it is compliant.</p>

  <p><a href="https://words.filippo.io/2025-state/#gcus25slide-25.jpeg">#</a></p><p>We did the same for ECDSA.</p>
<p>ECDSA is a digital signature mechanism. We've talked about it a few other times. It's just a way to take a message and a private key and generate a signature, here <em>(s, r)</em>.</p>
<p>To make a signature, you also need a random number, and that number must be used only once with the same private key. You cannot reuse it. That number is k here.</p>
<p>Why can you not reuse it? Because if you reuse it, then you can do this fun algebra thing and then <em>pop</em> the private key falls out by just smashing two signatures together. Bad, really, really bad.</p>

  <p><a href="https://words.filippo.io/2025-state/#gcus25slide-26.jpeg">#</a></p><p>How do we generate this number that must never be the same?</p>
<p>Well, one option is we make it random.</p>
<p>But what if your random number generator breaks and generates twice the same random number? That would leak the private key, and that would be bad.</p>
<p>So the community came up with <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6979">deterministic ECDSA</a>. Instead of generating the nonce at random, we are going to hash the message and the private key.</p>
<p>This is still actually a little risky though, because if there's a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_fault_analysis">fault in the CPU</a>, for example, or a bug, because <a href="https://github.com/MystenLabs/ed25519-unsafe-libs">for example you're taking the wrong inputs</a>, you might still end up generating the same value but signing a slightly different message.</p>
<p>How do we mitigate both of those? We do both.</p>
<p>We take some randomness and the private key and the message, we hash them all together, and now it's really, really hard for the number to come out the same. That's called hedged ECDSA.</p>
<p>The Go crypto library <a href="https://cs.opensource.google/go/go/+/refs/tags/go1.23.0:src/crypto/ecdsa/ecdsa.go;l=417">has been doing hedged ECDSA from way before it was called hedged and way before I was on the team</a>.</p>
<p>Except… random ECDSA has always been FIPS. Deterministic ECDSA has been FIPS since a couple years ago. Hedged ECDSA is technically not FIPS.</p>

  <p><a href="https://words.filippo.io/2025-state/#gcus25slide-35.jpeg">#</a></p><p>Finally, we finished cleaning up crypto/rsa.</p>
<p>If you remember from last year, we made the crypto/rsa sign and verify operations not use math/big and use constant time code. Now we also made key generation, validation, and pre-computation all not use math/big.</p>
<p>That loading keys that were serialized to JSON a lot faster, and made key generation much faster. But how much faster?</p>
<p>Benchmarking key generation is really hard because it's a random process: you take a number random number and you check, is it prime? No. Toss. Is it prime? Nope. Toss. Is it prime?</p>
<p>You keep doing this. If you're lucky, it’s very fast. If you are unlucky, very slow. It’s a geometric distribution and if you want to average it out, you have to run for hours. Instead, I figured out <a href="https://words.filippo.io/rsa-keygen-bench/">a new way by mathematically deriving the average number of pulls you are supposed to do and preparing a synthetic run that gives exactly the expected mean number of checks, so that we get a representative sample to benchmark deterministically</a>. That was a lot of fun.</p>
<p>Moreover, we detect more broken keys, and we did a rare backwards compatibility break to stop supporting keys smaller than 1024 bits.</p>
<p>1024 is already pretty small, you should be using 2048 minimum, but if you're using less than 1024, it can be broken on the proverbial laptop. It's kind of silly that a production library lets you do something so insecure, and you can't tell them apart just by looking at the code. You have to know what the size of the key is.</p>
<p>So we just took that out.</p>
<p>I expected people to yell at me. Nobody yelled at me. Good job community.</p>

<p>I have one bug in particular that is my white whale.</p>
<p>(You might say, "Filippo, well-adjusted people don't have white whales." Well, we learned nothing new, have we?)</p>
<p>My white whale is <a href="https://go.dev/issue/20040">this assembly bug</a> that we found at Cloudflare before I joined the Go team. I spent an afternoon figuring out an exploit for it with Sean Devlin in Paris, while the yellow jackets set fire to cop cars outside. That's a different story.</p>
<p>It's an assembly bug where the carry—literally the carry like when you do a pen and paper multiplication—was just not accounted for correctly. You can watch my talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPj5tTFDql0"><em>Squeezing a Key through a Carry Bit</em></a> if you are curious to learn more about it.</p>

  <p><a href="https://words.filippo.io/2025-state/#gcus25slide-37.jpeg">#</a></p><p>The problem with this stuff is that it's so hard to get code coverage for it because all the code always runs. It's just that you don't know if it always runs with that carry at zero, and if the carry was one, it’d do the wrong math.</p>
<p>I think we've cracked it, by using mutation testing.</p>
<p>We have a framework that tells the assembler, "hey, anywhere you see an add-with-carry, replace it with a simple add that discards the carry." Then we run the tests. If the tests still pass, the test did not cover that carry.</p>
<p>If that happens we fail a meta-test and tell whoever's sending the CL, “hey, no, no, no, you gotta test that.”</p>
<p>Same for checking the case in which the carry is always set. We replace the add-with-carry with a simple add and then insert a +1.</p>
<p>It's a little tricky. If you want to read more about it, it's in <a href="https://words.filippo.io/assembly-mutation/">this blog post</a>. I'm very hopeful that will help us with all this assembly stuff.</p>

  <p><a href="https://words.filippo.io/2025-state/#gcus25slide-38.jpeg">#</a></p><p>Next, <a href="https://words.filippo.io/accumulated/">accumulated test vectors</a>.</p>
<p>This is a little trick that I'm very very fond of.</p>
<p>Say you want to test a very large space. For example there are two inputs and they can both be 0 to 200 bytes long, and you want to test all the size combinations.</p>
<p>That would be a lot of test vectors, right?</p>
<p>If I checked in a megabyte of test vectors every time I wanted to do that, people eventually would yell at me.</p>
<p>Instead what we do is run the algorithm with each size combination, and take the result and we put it inside a rolling hash. Then at the end we take the hash result and we check that it comes out right.</p>
<p>We do this with two implementations. If it comes out to the same hash, great. If it comes out not to the same hash, it doesn't help you figure out what the bug is, but it tells you there's a bug. I'll take it.</p>

<p>It's now much more spec compliant on the little things where it goes like, “no, no, no, you're not allowed to put a zero here” and so on.</p>
<p>Then, the Let's Encrypt people have a test tool for the ACME protocol called Pebble. (Because it's a small version of their production system called Boulder! It took me a long time to figure it out and eventually I was like ooooohhh.)</p>

<p>Sometimes even the comment was wrong! Can you tell the comment changed in that patch? This is a thing Roland and Joel found.</p>
<p>Now there's a test that will just yell at you if you try to commit a <code>WORD</code> or <code>BYTE</code> instruction.</p>
<p>We also removed all the assembly that was specifically there for speeding up stuff on CPUs that don't have AVX2. AVX2 came out in 2015 and if you want to go fast, you're probably not using the CPU generation from back then. We still run on it, just not as fast.</p>

<p>Stuff like <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/crypto/subtle#WithDataIndependentTiming">data independent timing</a> to tell the CPU, "no, no, I actually did mean for you to do that in constant time, goddammit."</p>
<p>And server-side TLS Encrypted Client Hello, which is a privacy improvement. We had client side, now we have server side.</p>
<p>crypto/rand.Read never fails. We promised that, we did that.</p>
<p>Now, do you know how hard it is to test the failure case of something that never fails? I had to re-implement the seccomp library to tell the kernel to break the getrandom syscall to check what happens when it doesn’t work. There are <a href="https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/608175">tests all pointing guns at each other</a> to make sure the fallback both works and is never hit unexpectedly.</p>

SROs like those offered by the YMCA were the safety net that kept many people off the streets—and their disappearance from the housing supply explains much of modern-day homelessness. What we destroyed wasn’t just a housing type but an entire urban ecosystem: one that provided flexibility, independence, and affordability at scale.</span></p><p>As with so much of our urban history, this destruction was by design.</p><p>From the mid-1800s to the early 1900s, hotel living was a normal way of life for people of all socioeconomic backgrounds. As hotelkeeper Simeon Ford colorfully put it in 1903, “We have fine hotels for fine people, good hotels for good people, plain hotels for plain people, and some bum hotels for bums.” SROs, the “bum hotels,” were the backbone of affordable housing, serving “a great army” of low-paid but skilled workers. Clustered in lively downtown districts with restaurants and services that acted as extensions of the home, SROs offered liberation from family supervision and the constraints of Victorian mores. Rooming house districts let young people mix freely and even allowed same-sex couples to live discreetly—signs of a more secular, modern urban culture. Downtown hotel life, Groth notes, “had the promise to be not just urban but urbane.”</p><p>And therein lay the problem: the urbanity of SROs collided head-on with the moralism of the Progressive Era.</p><p><span>Reformers drew on a long tradition of </span><a href="https://www.ryanpuzycki.com/p/the-suburban-lifestyle-dream" rel="">anti-urban bias</a><span>, seeing the emergent twentieth-century city as a problem, with cheap hotels at its heart. They pathologized hotel dwellers as “friendless, isolated, needy, and disabled” and cast SROs as “caldrons of social and cultural evil.” Some of the cheapest hotels </span><em>were</em><span> unsafe and exploitative, but reformers cared less about improving conditions than about what the hotels symbolized. They blamed rooming houses for loneliness, sexual licentiousness, civic apathy—even suicide. To them, the presence of “social misfits” proved that hotels caused moral disorder. In reality, people lived in SROs because they were cheap and offered greater independence—especially for career-oriented young women. Firm in their belief in the “One Best Way to live,” the reformers exalted the single-family home as the “bulwark of good citizenship” and succeeded in stigmatizing hotel life.</span></p><p>By the turn of the century, they set their sights on changing the law.</p><p><span>Beginning in the late 19th century, reformers used building and health codes to erase what they saw as “aberrant social lives.” San Francisco’s early building ordinances targeted Chinese lodging houses, while later codes outlawed cheap wooden hotels altogether. By the early 1900s, cities and states were classifying lodging houses as public nuisances. Other laws increased building standards and mandated plumbing fixtures, raising costs and slowing new construction. Urban reformers next embraced </span><a href="https://www.ryanpuzycki.com/p/all-zoning-is-exclusionary" rel="">exclusionary zoning</a><span> to separate undesirable people and noxious uses from residential areas. SROs were deemed inappropriate in residential zones, and many codes banned the mixed-use districts that sustained them. In cities like San Francisco, zoning was used to erect a “cordon sanitaire” around the prewar city “to keep old city ideas from contaminating the new.”</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!HyKW!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5a96d50-a284-45a0-9722-705e4b28b54a_1506x896.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!HyKW!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5a96d50-a284-45a0-9722-705e4b28b54a_1506x896.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!HyKW!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5a96d50-a284-45a0-9722-705e4b28b54a_1506x896.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!HyKW!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5a96d50-a284-45a0-9722-705e4b28b54a_1506x896.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!HyKW!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5a96d50-a284-45a0-9722-705e4b28b54a_1506x896.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!HyKW!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5a96d50-a284-45a0-9722-705e4b28b54a_1506x896.png" width="1456" height="866" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d5a96d50-a284-45a0-9722-705e4b28b54a_1506x896.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:866,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!HyKW!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5a96d50-a284-45a0-9722-705e4b28b54a_1506x896.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!HyKW!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5a96d50-a284-45a0-9722-705e4b28b54a_1506x896.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!HyKW!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5a96d50-a284-45a0-9722-705e4b28b54a_1506x896.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!HyKW!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5a96d50-a284-45a0-9722-705e4b28b54a_1506x896.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption><span>The cordon sanitaire “protecting” single-family homes (Source: </span><em>Living Downtown</em><span>)</span></figcaption></figure></div><p><span>Residential hotels, like apartments, were swept into the same category of “mere parasitic” uses that </span><em>Euclid v. Ambler</em><span>—the 1926 case that upheld zoning—treated as potential health hazards. Redlining and federal loan criteria starved urban hotels of capital, while planners simply omitted them from surveys and censuses—as if their residents didn’t exist. By the </span><a href="https://www.ryanpuzycki.com/p/the-slumless-city" rel="">urban renewal</a><span> era, the existence of the old city was itself seen as an affront, and it, too, had to be destroyed.</span></p><p>In effect, SROs became a “deliberate casualty” of the new city.</p><p>Economic and policy shifts hastened their decline. Industrial jobs moved to peripheral locations only accessible by car, urban highway expansion targeted lodging-house neighborhoods, and cities encouraged office development on increasingly valuable downtown land. The “moral blight” of hotel districts had increasingly become economic blight, necessitating renewal. And because SROs didn’t count as “permanent housing” in official statistics, clearance programs could claim to displace no one. San Francisco’s urban renewal experience was typical: redevelopment in and around the Yerba Buena/Moscone Center area ultimately eliminated an estimated 40,000 hotel rooms. The public housing that replaced hotel districts—if it was built at all—often failed to accommodate single adults. To bureaucrats, the bulldozer was salubrious, “eliminating dead tissue” and “clearing away the mistakes of the past.” To the people who lived there, it wiped out their last foothold in the housing market.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-RNQ!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb903425b-9d88-4cb1-bf8b-3e9ff5246d0c_1496x604.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-RNQ!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb903425b-9d88-4cb1-bf8b-3e9ff5246d0c_1496x604.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-RNQ!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb903425b-9d88-4cb1-bf8b-3e9ff5246d0c_1496x604.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-RNQ!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb903425b-9d88-4cb1-bf8b-3e9ff5246d0c_1496x604.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-RNQ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb903425b-9d88-4cb1-bf8b-3e9ff5246d0c_1496x604.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-RNQ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb903425b-9d88-4cb1-bf8b-3e9ff5246d0c_1496x604.png" width="1456" height="588" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b903425b-9d88-4cb1-bf8b-3e9ff5246d0c_1496x604.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:588,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-RNQ!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb903425b-9d88-4cb1-bf8b-3e9ff5246d0c_1496x604.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-RNQ!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb903425b-9d88-4cb1-bf8b-3e9ff5246d0c_1496x604.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-RNQ!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb903425b-9d88-4cb1-bf8b-3e9ff5246d0c_1496x604.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-RNQ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb903425b-9d88-4cb1-bf8b-3e9ff5246d0c_1496x604.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption><span>In San Francisco, a blighted SRO neighborhood, and what was to replace it (Source: </span><em>Living Downtown</em><span>)</span></figcaption></figure></div><p>By the mid-twentieth century, “millions” of SRO hotel rooms disappeared through closures, conversions, and demolition across major cities, and the modest hotel market that remained was shrinking fast. With almost no new SROs built since the 1930s, the remaining stock was vanishing by the thousands in the 1970s. New York City had 200,000 SROs when it banned new hotel construction in 1955; only 30,000 remained by 2014. As tenants changed and land values climbed, owners who once fought to save their lodging houses now wanted out; it was officials who suddenly wanted to preserve them. Tenant movements and new government programs emerged in the 1970s and ’80s, but Reagan-era cuts gutted funding, and many remaining hotels decayed into the “street hotels” opponents had long imagined: unsanitary, unsafe, and unfit for all but the city’s most desperate residents.</p><p>At the same time, demand for SRO housing was rising sharply. In the 1970s, states emptied mental hospitals without funding alternatives, pushing thousands of people with serious needs into cheap downtown hotels unequipped to support them. What was left of the SRO system became America’s accidental asylum network—the last rung of shelter for those the state had abandoned.</p><p>Thousands of people were barely hanging on, and a full-blown homelessness crisis had emerged in American cities for the first time since the Great Depression.</p><p><span>The SRO crisis was no accident, Groth argues, but the result of government policy at all levels that picked winners and losers in the housing market. The people we now call “chronically homeless” were once simply low-income tenants, housed by the private market in cheap rooms rather than by public programs. Once that market was dismantled, the result was predictable: the </span><a href="https://www.ryanpuzycki.com/p/were-all-experiencing-homelessness" rel="">homelessness</a><span> wave of the late 1970s and 1980s followed directly from the destruction of SROs. Today’s crisis—nearly 800,000 unhoused people in 2024—is the long tail of that loss, compounded by decades of underbuilding in expensive cities and soaring rents. As </span><a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-04-25-mn-27098-story.html" rel="">one advocate put it</a><span>, “The people you see sleeping under bridges used to be valued members of the housing market. They aren’t anymore.”</span></p><p><span>As Alex Horowitz of The Pew Charitable Trusts </span><a href="https://www.pew.org/en/research-and-analysis/issue-briefs/2025/07/how-states-and-cities-decimated-americans-lowest-cost-housing-option" rel="">writes</a><span>, if SROs had “grown since 1960 at about the same rate as the rest of the U.S. housing stock, the nation would have roughly 2.5 million more such units”—more than three times the number of homeless individuals. While we can’t rebuild the old SRO market we destroyed, cities now face a new opportunity: a vast surplus of obsolete office space that could be converted into inexpensive rooms.</span></p><p><span>Horowitz argues cities should make shared housing—“co-living,” in today’s parlance—legal again. Office vacancies are soaring at the same time deeply affordable housing is vanishing. Horowitz and the architecture firm </span><a href="https://www.gensler.com/blog/pew-study-flexible-office-to-co-living-conversions" rel="">Gensler</a><span> modeled what cities could actually build. Their analysis suggests that a vacant office tower could be converted into deeply affordable rooms for half the per-unit cost of new studio apartments. A typical 120–220 square foot unit with shared kitchens and bathrooms could rent to people earning 30–50% of area median income. Urban development has become so expensive that such conversions are likely to only be feasible if subsidized, but Horowitz argues that conversions offer a better way to leverage scarce public dollars: for instance, a $10 million budget might produce 125 co-living rooms instead of 35 studios, providing a way to scale deeply affordable housing much more quickly.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LyK9!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3d7ddb01-731a-411a-85b0-72d906538a59_2048x1021.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LyK9!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3d7ddb01-731a-411a-85b0-72d906538a59_2048x1021.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LyK9!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3d7ddb01-731a-411a-85b0-72d906538a59_2048x1021.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LyK9!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3d7ddb01-731a-411a-85b0-72d906538a59_2048x1021.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LyK9!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3d7ddb01-731a-411a-85b0-72d906538a59_2048x1021.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LyK9!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3d7ddb01-731a-411a-85b0-72d906538a59_2048x1021.png" width="1456" height="726" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3d7ddb01-731a-411a-85b0-72d906538a59_2048x1021.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:726,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LyK9!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3d7ddb01-731a-411a-85b0-72d906538a59_2048x1021.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LyK9!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3d7ddb01-731a-411a-85b0-72d906538a59_2048x1021.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LyK9!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3d7ddb01-731a-411a-85b0-72d906538a59_2048x1021.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LyK9!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3d7ddb01-731a-411a-85b0-72d906538a59_2048x1021.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>It’s a great idea—but in many cities, it’s illegal.</p><p><span>While several cities have made efforts to undo SRO prohibitions, in many American metropolises, restrictions abound—from zoning that bans shared housing or residential uses in office districts to minimum-unit-size rules that outlaw SRO-scale rooms. Building codes with strict </span><a href="https://www.ryanpuzycki.com/p/the-case-for-single-stair-buildings" rel="">egress and corridor rules</a><span> and ventilation requirements make conversions technically infeasible, while parking mandates add unnecessary costs. Meanwhile, “unrelated occupancy” limits prohibit the very household types SROs serve.</span></p><p>None of these barriers is structural; every one is a policy choice.</p><p>We talk endlessly about the “missing middle.” But the real catastrophe was the “banished bottom”—the deliberate destruction of the cheapest rung of the housing ladder. Re-legalizing SROs won’t instantly restore a once deeply affordable housing market that provided housing at scale, but it would at least make it possible for cities to create a much cheaper form of housing that could benefit some of the 11 million extremely low-income renter households and the 800,000 homeless people in America. No city will meaningfully address the need for deeply affordable housing until it restores this missing rung—and accepts that not everyone needs a full apartment to have a full life. Surely, an SRO is better than a sidewalk.</p><p><span>Incidentally, while the YMCA is generally not in the SRO business anymore, its </span><a href="https://communityimpact.com/austin/south-central-austin/development/2025/10/17/ymca-details-plans-for-redeveloped-townlake-facility-with-condo-towers-affordable-housing/" rel="">Austin branch</a><span> is redeveloping itself as a mixed-use center with 90 deeply discounted affordable units for families. It’s a worthy project—but it highlights the gap: more than 80% of Austin’s homeless residents are single adults, the very group the Y once housed. We used to have a place they could go—but what happened to </span><em>that</em><span>?</span></p><p>The Y is as much a question as an answer.</p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.ryanpuzycki.com/p/the-banished-bottom-of-the-housing/comments&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Leave a comment&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://www.ryanpuzycki.com/p/the-banished-bottom-of-the-housing/comments" rel=""><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.ryanpuzycki.com/p/the-banished-bottom-of-the-housing?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://www.ryanpuzycki.com/p/the-banished-bottom-of-the-housing?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p></div></article></div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div></div>]]></description>

<blockquote>
  <p>Going as Former Gifted Child for Halloween and the whole costume is just gonna
  be people asking “What are you supposed to be?” And me saying “I was supposed
  to be a lot of things.”</p>
  <p>-- <a href="https://github.com/leahtriss">@leahtriss</a> <a href="https://x.com/leahtriss/status/1188216425355317248">2019/10/26</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="christopher-langan">Christopher Langan</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Langan">Chris Langan</a> became famous
when television networks
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-788Upky2Y">interviewed him</a> for
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Langan#IQ_testing">allegedly scoring ~170 on an IQ test</a>.</p>
<p>Langan has not produced any acclaimed works of art or science. In this way, he
differs significantly from outsider intellectuals like Paul Erdös, Stephen
Wolfram, Nassim Taleb, etc.</p>
<p><small id="footnote-note"><a href="https://www.wolframphysics.org/">Wolfram's theory of everything</a> is
    incomprehensible in a fun way.
    <a href="https://ctmucommunity.org/wiki/Cognitive-Theoretic_Model_of_the_Universe">Langan's theory of everything</a>
    is incomprehensible in a not-fun way.</small></p>
<p>But Langan is clearly a smart guy. He
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Langan#IQ_testing">probably cleared 140+ on an IQ test</a>.
He <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-788Upky2Y">speaks like a book</a>. He won
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH2hiwhsZZU">$250,000 on a major trivia show</a>.</p>
<p><small id="footnote-note">Seriously, I really wish I could speak as clearly and confidently as
    Langan.</small></p>
<p>Maybe that's why <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miVG2xT5jY">this interview</a>
breaks my heart. The resentment, the eugenics, the hubris -- Langan earned a
reputation as
<a href="https://thebaffler.com/latest/more-smarter-ward">"Alex Jones with a thesaurus"</a>
and
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDmcoYpTTbE">"the Steven Seagal of intellectuals"</a>.</p>
<p>I don't want you to hate this guy. Yes, he actively promotes poisonous rhetoric
-- ignore that for now. This is about <em>you</em>. Reflect on all your setbacks, your
unmet potential, and the raw unfairness of it all. It sucks, and you mustn't let
that bitterness engulf you. You can forgive history itself; you can practice
gratitude towards an unjust world. You need no credentials, nor awards, nor
secrets, nor skills to do so. You are allowed to like yourself.</p>
<p>Langan
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Langan#Biography">had a rough childhood</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Langan's biological father left before he was born, and is said to have died
  in Mexico. Langan's mother married three more times, and had a son by each
  husband. Her second husband was murdered, and her third killed himself. Langan
  grew up with the fourth husband Jack Langan, who has been described as a
  "failed journalist" who used a bullwhip as a disciplinary measure and went on
  drinking sprees, disappearing from the house, locking the kitchen cabinets so
  the four boys could not get to the food in them. The family was very poor;
  Langan recalls that they all had only one set of clothes each. The family
  moved around, living for a while in a teepee on an Indian reservation, then
  later in Virginia City, Nevada.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Trauma never excuses nasty behavior, and that's not the point. This is still
about <em>you</em>. You can learn about yourself through others' stories, and empathy
is scariest when you confront similar nastiness within yourself.</p>
<p>You will never have enough IQ, nor money, nor time, nor energy. It's no excuse.
<em>You</em> are enough -- no, no, you are <em>plenty</em>.</p>
<h2 id="kim-ung-yong">Kim Ung-yong</h2>
<p>Instead of competing in real games, some people construct insignificant/winnable
sub-games. These people are called
<a href="https://commoncog.com/playing-to-play-playing-to-win/">"scrubs"</a>. They want to
compete, but they cannot bear losing; they want to win, but they are too
risk-averse and too undisciplined to excel in fair play. People who commit to
such worthless/unwinnable games are called "losers".</p>
<p>But you forget that participation is optional. You perpetually sear your bespoke
definition of "success" directly onto your forehead. You've been enduring your
pain for so long that you can't remember how it feels to be free from
expectation, from ambition, from guilt, from inferiority, from -- no, you don't
have to do any of this. You <em>may</em> do whatever you want, and you may do
<em>whatever</em> you want.</p>
<p>According to his parents,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Ung-yong">Kim Ung-yong</a> started calculus at
age 3, scored 210 on an IQ test and started studying physics at Hanyang
University at age 4, spoke five languages by age 5, and received an invitation
to work at NASA by age 7.</p>
<p>In 2010, this is how Kim
<a href="https://www.koreaboo.com/stories/south-korean-professor-once-smartest-person-in-world/">reflected on his childhood</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>At that time, I led my life like a machine--I woke up, solved the daily
  assigned equation, ate, slept, and so forth. I really didn't know what I was
  doing, and I was lonely and had no friends.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As an adult, Kim deliberately chose pragmatism over abstraction. He studied
civil engineering. He worked as a middle-manager in the Compensation Department
at Chungbuk Development Corporation.</p>
<p>Kim Ung-yong rejected the title of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Ung-yong">"failed genius"</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I'm trying to tell people that I'm happy the way I am. But why do people have
  to call my happiness a failure? […] Some think that high IQ people can be
  omnipotent, but that's not true. Look at me, I don't have musical talent nor
  do I excel at sports. […] Society shouldn't judge anyone with unilateral
  standards – everyone has different learning levels, hopes, talents and dreams
  and we should respect that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 2014, Kim joined Chungbuk National University as an associate professor. In
2020, he donated 15,000 books from his personal collection to Uijeongbu City for
public use.</p>
<p>But this is still about you. There exist no certificates nor trophies nor titles
that can quench your thirst for permanence. If you worship human intelligence,
210 IQ is not enough. It is only plenty if you let it be.</p></div></div>]]></description>

A 21 year old bug report requesting support of the XDG Base Directory specification is finally being addressed by Firefox. The Firefox 147 release should respect this XDG specification around where files should be positioned within Linux users' home directory.
</p><p>
The XDG Base Directory <a href="https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir/latest/">specification</a> lays out where application data files, configuration files, cached assets, and other files and file formats should be positioned within a user's home directory and the XDG environment variables for accessing those locations. To date Firefox has just positioned all files under <em>~/.mozilla</em> rather than the likes of <em>~/.config</em> and <em>~/.local/share</em>.
</p><p><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=2025&amp;image=firefox_xdg_1" alt="Firefox XDG Base Directory spec bug report"></p>
<p>Back in September 2004 <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=259356">this bug report</a> was opened to support the FreeDesktop.org XDG Base Directory specification.
</p><p>
Merged this morning was the <a href="https://hg-edge.mozilla.org/integration/autoland/rev/8a6d6c094cb5">support</a> for this specification and associated commits.
</p><p><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=2025&amp;image=firefox_xdg_2" alt="Firefox XDG Base Directory spec commit"></p>
<p>In turn this long-open bug is now closed and Firefox 147 should be the version to finally support the XDG Base Directory specification for jiving more nicely with other Linux apps.</p></div></div>]]></description>

        <article><section><section><p><b>Mrs Justice Collins Rice:</b></p></section><section id="lvl_1"><p><b><u>Introduction</u></b></p><section id="para_1"><span>1.</span><p>This is a dispute between prominent ‘free software movement’ activists.  The free software movement advances a philosophy and practice which values the freedom of users to create and share software enabling internet access, and challenges the dominance of ‘big tech’ software and systems over the online experience.  That includes a preference for internet relay chat (‘IRC’), an online instant messaging system dating in origin from the 1990s, over the big social media platforms.  The challenge the free software movement makes is not only of a technical, but also of a social, economic or ethical nature, and it espouses some wider sets of values accordingly.</p></section><section id="para_2"><span>2.</span><p>The Claimant, Dr Matthew Garrett, describes himself as a software engineer, computer security expert, and free software activist, with an academic background in (computational) genetics.  He gained his doctorate at Cambridge University, and has worked with ARM Ltd, a Cambridge-based software design company, throughout his career.  He is currently based in ‘Silicon Valley’ in California, where he holds a senior position at NVIDIA, one of the top half dozen big tech companies globally, and a part-time lectureship at the University of California, Berkeley, teaching operating systems security for a masters course.  He sets out that he has worked on some of the most significant projects in the free software movement and won a Free Software Foundation award in 2013 for his work on Secure Boot, UEFI and the Linux kernel (at the time, he states, the FSF was one of the most important organisations in the world for the advancement of free software).</p></section><section id="para_3"><span>3.</span><p>The Defendants are a Manchester-based married couple, each of whom operates a UK website focusing on free software information, interests and campaigns, and hosting an IRC channel.  Dr Roy Schestowitz describes himself as a software engineer, interdisciplinary researcher and fair competition advocate, with an academic background in medical biophysics.  He operates the website www.techrights.org (‘Techrights’).  Mrs Rianne Schestowitz describes herself as a computer scientist who works for a FOSS (free and open-source software) specialist.  She operates the website news.tuxmachines.org (‘Tuxmachines’).  Both websites have been in operation for some two decades.  These websites are declared by Dr Schestowitz to be not-for-profit undertakings – they are, he says, a committed labour of love on which they both publish tirelessly to the extent of thousands of articles a year.</p></section><section id="para_4"><span>4.</span><p>Dr Garrett brings a claim in libel over a series of 24 publications appearing on either Techrights or Tuxmachines or both, in August and September 2023.  The publications complained of appear at <span>Annex A</span> to this judgment.  Dr Garrett brings a further claim in data protection in respect of these and a number of other publications appearing on the websites at around the same time.  Dr and Mrs Schestowitz counterclaim in harassment.</p></section></section><section id="lvl_2"><p><b><u>Litigation History</u></b></p><section id="para_5"><span>5.</span><p>Dr Garrett issued proceedings, and filed and served his particulars of claim, in April 2024.  This had been preceded, as is usual, by a certain amount of correspondence before action, in which Dr Garrett had requested the removal of the publications from the websites.  Dr and Mrs Schestowitz declined to do so.</p></section><section id="para_6"><span>6.</span><p>Dr and Mrs Schestowitz filed and served a defence and counterclaim in September 2024.  The libel claim was resisted on the grounds that (a) none of the publications complained of had caused or was likely to cause serious harm to Dr Garrett’s reputation, and (b) one or more of the statutory defences of truth, honest opinion and publication on a matter of public interest applied.  The data protection claim was resisted on the ground that the journalistic purposes exemption applied.  </p></section><section id="para_7"><span>7.</span><p>Dr and Mrs Schestowitz’s pleadings had been professionally prepared, but they have been acting in person in recent months, including representing themselves at trial.  There was a significant amount of interlocutory case management activity, overseen by the Masters, in August and September of 2025, notably in relation to timetabling the provision of witness statements by or on behalf of Dr and Mrs Schestowitz.  These had still not been forthcoming by the time of the pre-trial review before Griffiths J on 6<sup>th</sup> October 2025.  </p></section><section id="para_8"><span>8.</span><div><p>Dr and Mrs Schestowitz did not attend the PTR.  Griffiths J proceeded in their absence.  His order confirmed, among other things, that:</p><blockquote><section><span>1.</span><p>By the operation of CPR 32.10, because the Defendants have not served any witness statement or witness summary for use at trial by 29 August 2025, as required by the CCMC Order of Master Davison dated 15 January 2025 and the extension of time granted by the Order of Master Dagnall dated 27 August 2025, neither Defendant is permitted to call any witness to give oral evidence at trial.</p></section><section><span>2.</span><p>Any application for relief from sanctions will be considered in accordance with CPR 3.8 and CPR 3.9 in the event that such an application is made.</p></section></blockquote></div></section><section id="para_9"><span>9.</span><p>There appears to be no record that any formal application was subsequently made, although I was shown an unsealed version of an application by Dr and Mrs Schestowitz to set aside the order of Griffiths J.  Dr Schestowitz confirmed to me at the opening of the trial on 30<sup>th</sup> October 2025, at which he and Mrs Schestowitz were informally supported by a defamation solicitor, that in any event no further order was sought on that (unsealed) application and no further application was being made.  He told me that he and Mrs Schestowitz had taken a deliberate decision not to submit any evidence or call any witnesses, on financial grounds.  He confirmed that he understood that meant that, while he and Mrs Schestowitz would be able to put Dr Garrett to proof of his claims, to cross-examine the claimant witnesses (Dr Garrett and his solicitor), and to make submissions to me, they would not be able by these means to introduce evidence in support of their defence and counterclaim.</p></section></section><section id="lvl_3"><p><b><u>The Defamation ‘Preliminary Issues’</u></b></p><section id="para_10"><span>10.</span><p>There had been no ‘preliminary issues’ determination ahead of trial in this case.  Mr Hamer, Counsel for Dr Garrett, explained that the parties’ pleadings had not been very far apart in this respect.  Nevertheless, there was no formal agreement about them.</p></section><section id="lvl_3_1"><span><b><i>(a)</i></b></span><p><b><i>Legal Framework </i></b></p></section><section id="lvl_3_2"><span>(i)</span><p>Single natural and ordinary meaning</p></section><section id="para_11"><span>11.</span><p>My preliminary task was therefore to “<i>determine the single natural and ordinary meaning of the words complained of, which is the meaning that the hypothetical reasonable reader would understand the words to bear</i>”.  </p></section><section id="para_12"><span>12.</span><p>The legal principles I am required to apply in doing so are well established.  I directed myself to the useful guidance on determination of ‘single natural and ordinary meaning’ distilled from the authorities (including that of the Supreme Court in <i><u>Stocker v Stocker</u></i> [2020] AC 593) and set out in <i><u>Koutsogiannis v Random House Group</u></i><i></i>[2020] 4 WLR 25,<i></i>at [11] and [12].  The guidance of the authorities is of course just that – guidance – intended to simplify not complicate the exercise. And each case turns on its own facts.  But the following briefly summarises the guidance as it applies to the present case.</p></section><section id="para_13"><span>13.</span><p>The governing principle in determining ‘meaning’ is reasonableness.  The intention of the publisher (here, Dr and Mrs Schestowitz respectively) is irrelevant in law: the test focuses on how words are read, not how or why they came to be written.  It is an objective, not subjective, test.</p></section><section id="para_14"><span>14.</span><p>Each publication must be considered as a whole, in the context in which an ordinary reasonable reader would have read it.  That reference to ‘context’ was explained by Nicklin J in <i><u>Riley v Murray</u></i><i> [2020] EMLR 20</i> at [15]-[17].  I can, and where relevant should, take account of: (a) matters of common knowledge – facts so well known that, for practical purposes, everybody knows them; (b) matters to be treated as intrinsic to the publication – for example via a hyperlink; and (c) any other material that could reasonably be expected to have been known or read by <i>all</i> the readers of the publication complained of.  But otherwise, no <i>evidence</i> beyond the publication complained of is admissible as to what it means. And natural and ordinary meaning does not rely on a reader having any <i>special</i> knowledge.  </p></section><section id="para_15"><span>15.</span><p>I am guided away from over-elaborate or lawyerly analysis of text.  I need to avoid both literalism, and any strained or forced interpretation.  I can and must determine the single meaning I myself consider correct, and am not bound by the meanings advanced by the parties (so long as I do not alight on something more injurious than a claimant's pleaded meaning). </p></section><section id="para_16"><span>16.</span><p>So I am to keep in mind, as guided, the perspective of an ordinary, reasonable reader of each article complained of, reading it once through as it appears, and forming an impression of what it conveys on its face.  The reasonable reader is neither naïve nor suspicious; is able to read between the lines and pick up an implication; and is allowed a certain amount of loose thinking without being ‘<i>avid for scandal</i>’.  </p></section><section id="lvl_3_3"><span>(ii)</span><p>Fact/opinion</p></section><section id="para_17"><span>17.</span><p>I have further directed myself to <i><u>Koutsogiannis</u></i> at [16] and [17], as well as to <i><u>Millett v Corbyn</u></i> <a href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2021/567">[2021] EWCA Civ 567</a>, for guidance on considering whether the words complained of contain allegations of fact or expressions of opinion.  I am reminded by the authorities that the test for the difference between fact and opinion is an objective one.  That comes back to how the words would strike the ordinary reasonable reader.  I have to look at the substance, not the intention of the writer or any label the writer may, or may not, have attached.</p></section><section id="para_18"><span>18.</span><p>Subject matter and immediate context can be especially important here.  In the classic formulation, “<i>opinion is something which is or can reasonably be inferred to be a deduction, inference, conclusion, criticism, judgment, remark or observation</i>” (<i><u>Clarke v Norton</u></i><i> [1910] VLR 494</i> at page 499).  But sometimes care is needed: there is a difference between comment which is pure opinion and comment which is an imputation of underlying fact.</p></section><section id="para_19"><span>19.</span><p>Factual allegations can be published with varying degrees of certainty as to what is being imputed. These degrees of certainty have been classically analysed at three distinct levels : level 1: the claimant is 'guilty' of the conduct alleged; level 2: there is 'reason to suspect' the claimant is guilty of the conduct alleged; and level 3: there are 'grounds for investigating whether' the claimant is guilty of the conduct alleged (<i><u>Chase v. News Group Newspapers</u></i><i></i>[2002] EWCA Civ 172).</p></section><section id="para_20"><span>20.</span><p>While ‘meaning’ and ‘fact/opinion’ are distinct preliminary issues, the authorities counsel against trying to resolve them in too linear or compartmentalised a fashion.  I have to bear in mind whether this is a case in which the questions of ‘meaning’ and ‘fact/opinion’ might throw light on each other, such that it would be wrong to tackle them in a sequence which proves to be a trap of false logic.  I note the risk and seek to avoid it.</p></section><section id="lvl_3_4"><span>(iii)</span><p>Defamatory Tendency</p></section><section id="para_21"><span>21.</span><p>The test at common law for whether a (natural and ordinary) meaning is defamatory is well-established: whether it substantially affects in an adverse manner the attitude of other people towards a claimant, or has a tendency to do so.  Some recent authorities put it in terms of identifying that a claimant has breached the common, shared values of our society (<i><u>Millett v Corbyn</u></i>).  This is not about actual impact at this stage, it is about the meaning of the words themselves and their inherent tendency to damage someone’s reputation.  ‘Substantially’ imports a threshold of gravity or seriousness (<i><u>Thornton v Telegraph Media Group Ltd</u></i> [2010] EWHC 1414).</p></section><section id="lvl_3_5"><span><b><i>(b)</i></b></span><p><b><i>Approach, Consideration and Determinations</i></b></p></section><section id="para_22"><span>22.</span><p>I adopted the standard approach to the determination of meaning and the other preliminary issues.  I read each article complained of quickly once through, before knowing what either party wanted to say about it.  I formed and noted my initial impressions.  I then read the parties’ pleadings and skeleton arguments or position statements, heard oral submissions (neither Dr nor Mrs Schestowitz chose to address me orally on the preliminary issues), and reserved judgment as to how far to adjust my initial views.  </p></section><section id="para_23"><span>23.</span><p>The table attached to this judgment at <span>Annex B</span> sets out the parties’ rival meanings and, in the final column, the matters I have now determined.  Where relevant, I have included some short explanatory notes for my decisions where there appeared to be any significant dispute about a particular issue.  The following general points also arise.</p></section><section id="para_24"><span>24.</span><p>First, I have had to reflect in a number of respects on whether my preliminary views on meaning needed to be moderated on the ground that they went further than those contended for by the Claimant.  Where I have concluded that my meaning was simply a particularisation of matters expressed in more general terms by the Claimant, I have not done so.  Where, however, I had identified a meaning not referred to in the Claimant’s pleading, I have withdrawn it for that reason. </p></section><section id="para_25"><span>25.</span><p>Second, while each publication’s meaning is determined on its own terms, some common repetitive themes emerge.  Dr Garrett is chiefly accused of an online campaign of material which is (variously) criminal, illegal or offensive.  The criminal matters alleged include cybercrime, hate crime, blackmail, issuing threats of violence or death, and matters adjacent to terrorism.  Other illegal matters alleged include defamation, harassment and online abuse.  Offensive matters alleged include material that is variously racist, antisemitic, misogynist, homophobic or otherwise hateful or discriminatory, sexually incontinent, or drugs-related.  Dr Garrett is alleged to have waged this campaign through the medium of IRC ‘sockpuppet’ accounts – accounts under pseudonymous user nicknames intended to be a vehicle for distributing material anonymously and deniably.  Many posts from these accounts are reproduced in the articles complained of.  Dr Garrett is also repeatedly alleged to be an uncontrolled user of illegal class A drugs, principally crack cocaine.  </p></section><section id="para_26"><span>26.</span><p>Third, I have concurred with the parties in understanding that most of the allegations relate to online behaviour.  But there are some notable exceptions to that, chief of which is the allegation relating to Dr Garrett’s being an habitual cocaine user.</p></section><section id="para_27"><span>27.</span><p>Fourth, where criminal or illegal acts are alleged, the meanings I have determined are closer to those contended for by the Claimant – namely that these are allegations of fact at <i><u>Chase</u></i> level 1.  An ordinary reasonable reader would, in my view, have no difficulty in understanding that Dr Garrett is straightforwardly being said to have committed them.  Where, however, offensive attitudinal matters are alleged – racism, misogyny, etc – the meanings I have determined are closer to those contended for by the Defendants – namely that these are evaluative expressions of opinion.</p></section><section id="para_28"><span>28.</span><p>Although it is not formally admitted, there can be no doubt at all that each of the publications is of grossly ‘defamatory tendency’ at common law.  They allege multiple and serious transgressions of society’s norms, up to and including the criminal law.</p></section></section><section id="lvl_4"><p><b><u>‘Serious Harm’</u></b></p><section id="lvl_4_1"><span><b><i>(a)</i></b></span><p><b><i>Legal Framework </i></b></p></section><section id="para_29"><span>29.</span><p>By <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2013/26/section/1/1">section 1(1)</a> of the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2013/26">Defamation Act 2013</a>, ‘<i>A statement is not defamatory unless its publication has caused or is likely to cause serious harm to the reputation of the claimant</i>’.</p></section><section id="para_30"><span>30.</span><p>The leading authority on this provision is the decision of the Supreme Court in <i><u>Lachaux v Independent Print Ltd</u></i><i> [2020] AC 612</i>.  As Lord Sumption’s judgment makes clear ([12]-[14]), <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2013/26/section/1/1">section 1(1)</a> imposed a new threshold test for defamation claims, the application of which is to be determined by reference to the <i>actual facts</i> about the impact of a publication, and not just to the meaning of the words.  It requires real-world effects to be established beyond the inherent ‘defamatory tendency’ of any publication. The statutory term ‘<i>has caused</i>’ points to some historic reputational harm, which can be shown actually to have occurred; and ‘<i>is likely to cause</i>’ points to probable, actual, future reputational harm. </p></section><section id="para_31"><span>31.</span><p>The serious harm test is a question of fact, and facts must be established by evidence.  Facts and evidence – and causation – are matters which are entirely case-specific.  But a claimant’s statutory task of establishing that publishees changed their minds for the worse about them – and to a degree warranting the description of ‘serious reputational harm’ – because of reading something, poses clear evidential challenges.  That is partly because of the nature of the harm in question: the ‘harm’ of defamation is the effect of a publication in the mind of a third-party publishee (reader), and not any action they may take as a result (nor is it the direct effect of a publication on a claimant reading it themselves).  And it is partly because of simple practical considerations: particularly in cases of mass publication, the minds of the publishees may be effectively evidentially unreachable.  In such cases, finding enough readers willing to testify that they thought the worse of a claimant has long been recognised as a prohibitively impractical undertaking.</p></section><section id="para_32"><span>32.</span><p>The authorities have therefore developed some detailed guidelines for trial courts applying the serious harm test in ‘mass publication’ cases.  In such cases,   <i><u>Lachaux</u></i> confirmed (at [21]) that a claimant may be able to discharge their evidential burden of establishing serious reputational harm by <i>inference</i> drawn from a factual matrix combining the meaning of the words, the situation of the claimant, the circumstances of the publication(s) complained of and the inherent circumstantial probabilities.  </p></section><section id="para_33"><span>33.</span><p>That matrix, in turn, has to be established as a matter of fact and evidence.  But again, the authorities give some assistance.  The well-established ‘grapevine’ or ‘percolation’ tendencies (<i><u>Slipper v BBC</u></i><i>[1991] 1 QB 283</i>; <i><u>Cairns v Modi</u></i><i>[2013] 1 WLR 1015</i>) of defamatory publications, particularly online and through social media of any kind, may in an appropriate case be factored into inference about scale of publication.  And the likely identity, as well as the numbers, of at least some of a class of publishees may be relevant to the assessment of harm, for example where some individuals may be particularly positioned to lose confidence in a claimant or take adverse action as a result.  But these are highly fact-specific matters; the inferences which may properly be drawn in any individual case depend entirely on the circumstances of that case.  The Court of Appeal in <i><u>Blake v Fox</u></i><i><a href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2025/1321">[2025] EWCA Civ 1321</a></i> has, however, recently indicated that if a claimant establishes a factual matrix of mass publication, grave defamatory tendency of the content, and the claimant’s significant reputational exposure, then the inference of serious reputational harm may have to be considered by a court to be irresistible.</p></section><section id="lvl_4_2"><span><b><i>(b)</i></b></span><p><b><i>Consideration</i></b></p></section><section id="lvl_4_3"><span>(i)</span><p>Approach, and Gravity of Imputation</p></section><section id="para_34"><span>34.</span><p>Dr Garrett advances a wholly inferential case of serious harm, relying on this being a case of mass publication, very grave inherent defamatory content, the engagement of his own professional and reputational capital, and inherent probabilities.  The burden lies on him to establish this underpinning factual matrix.</p></section><section id="para_35"><span>35.</span><p>As a starting point, I have no difficulty in the first place in recognising the heavy gravity of the allegations made in each and every publication complained of.  Dr Garrett’s responsibility for a relentless online campaign of harassment and abuse, by the covert means of sockpuppet accounts, is advanced as fact.  Extensive, multiple and serious online criminality is advanced as fact.  Dr Garrett is accused of publishing a range of toxic or highly offensive online material by reference to direct quotations from the sockpuppet accounts he is accused of authoring; this material is on its face grossly offensive in many dimensions and carries clear implications of the social and moral turpitude of its author.  Habitual illegal class A drug use is advanced as fact.  In the meanings I have determined – and as to which the parties’ pleaded cases were not in the end separated by a wide margin, since they largely spoke for themselves – the publications complained of are undoubtedly very grave indeed.   I did not hear that seriously disputed.</p></section><section id="para_36"><span>36.</span><p>Dr and Mrs Schestowitz however make a double challenge to Dr Garrett’s task of establishing a factual matrix to support an inference of serious harm.  They put him to proof (a) that this is in fact a mass publication case, and (b) that his reputation is materially engaged – in each case, <i>within the UK</i>.  </p></section><section id="lvl_4_4"><span>(ii)</span><p>The Situation of the Claimant</p></section><section id="para_37"><span>37.</span><p>Taking the latter first, the ‘situation of the claimant’ in this case is that Dr Garrett was born in Ireland and moved to England with his family as a very young child.  He emigrated to California in 2009 and has not lived in the UK for 16 years.  He holds UK, Irish and US citizenship.  To succeed on his claim as brought, he has to demonstrate serious reputational harm within the court’s jurisdiction – that is, in England and Wales.  His evidence about his reputation here is as follows.</p></section><section id="para_38"><span>38.</span><p>Dr Garrett states that his reputation in England is both established, and ‘<i>immensely important</i>’ to him.  Before 2009 he had worked for the University of Cambridge and had done other Cambridge-based work, starting by doing contract work and working for a tech start-up, before going on to work for Collabora (described as a private open-source software consulting company headquartered in Cambridge) and for Red Hat, a US company with a wholly-owned British subsidiary which had been his employer here.</p></section><section id="para_39"><span>39.</span><p>He draws attention to his current senior role with NVIDIA, which ‘<i>does significant business in Britain</i>’.  In that role he has undertaken collaborative work with British companies including Collabora, Linaro, ARM and other consulting firms, including while present in the jurisdiction.  He describes these ‘<i>ongoing collaborations</i>’ as being ‘<i>extremely important in terms of providing value to my employer since then</i>’.  His evidence is that ‘<i>the reason I am valuable to my employer and my previous employers, is that I am exceedingly good at working across a range of different technologies and with a range of different companies.  If my ability to work with any of the companies who are working in a specific field is impaired, the value proposition of me for my employer goes down</i>’.  He states that damage to his reputation in England ‘<i>would have an impact on NVIDIA’s willingness to continue employing me</i>’.</p></section><section id="para_40"><span>40.</span><p>Dr Garrett draws attention to the fact that he holds a teaching position at a US university with an international reputation in his field, including in this country, and was awarded a ‘distinguished faculty award’ by that university.  His evidence is that his past and present academic reputation is engaged in England.  Of his future plans, he states that ‘<i>my goal in the end, at the point where I am in a position to retire, is to be able to move back to the United Kingdom and potentially adopt a position at a university here</i>’.</p></section><section id="para_41"><span>41.</span><p>Dr Garrett’s evidence is that he is regularly invited to speak at major events (with thousands of attendees) concerned with free software, Linux or cybersecurity generally, and has done so in the UK on half a dozen occasions in recent years.  He has also spoken at major European events with significant attendance from UK participants, including in the last couple of years.</p></section><section id="para_42"><span>42.</span><p>Dr Garrett also gives evidence that he has many friends and colleagues in the UK.</p></section><section id="para_43"><span>43.</span><p>I did not hear this evidence materially challenged in substance.  Dr Garrett’s evidence on the nature, extent and value of his reputation in England and Wales was clear and straightforward.  I can and do accept it.  It enables me to find as a fact that his professional, employment, academic and personal reputation is materially engaged within the jurisdiction.  I make that finding accordingly.</p></section><section id="lvl_4_5"><span>(iii)</span><p>Extent of Publication</p></section><section id="para_44"><span>44.</span><p>The principal dispute in this case on the question of serious reputational harm is, however, that of extent of publication (within the jurisdiction) of the articles complained of.  Mr Hamer contended for an inference of a readership in the tens of thousands, within the jurisdiction, for each article complained of, to date.  The evidence of this before me was limited.  I do not of course have any evidence from Dr and Mrs Schestowitz, and the pre-trial disclosure exercise revealed no analytics for readership of the articles in question (the defence states that ‘site analysis data is wiped after short periods of retention’).</p></section><section id="para_45"><span>45.</span><p>It is not in dispute that the websites get something like a million hits a day.  A hit is not an indication of readership; a single page may require a number of ‘hits’ to be viewed.  Dr Schestowitz made a challenge that something like half of those could be immediately discounted as machine-generated (bots, crawlers and so on).  He made a challenge to the remaining figure based on the proportion of the anglophone world attributable to the UK being a percentage in the low single figures.  He made a further challenge based on the high rate with which new articles are posted on both websites, and the relative age (and therefore incremental occlusion) of the material complained of.  He challenged that there was no evidential basis in the ‘million a day’ figure for a readership above tens in the UK on any one day, and that many of them would likely be repeat viewers, reading the same articles again and again.  Dr Schestowitz pointed out that neither he nor Mrs Schestowitz publishes on, or is a user of, mass social media platforms, that their websites attract viewers with similar preferences against modern social media, and that the grapevine or percolation effects often deployed in defamation litigation to encourage inference of mass publication are accordingly of limited application here.</p></section><section id="para_46"><span>46.</span><p>In these circumstances, and having been put to proof of extent of publication, Dr Garrett’s case that this is an instance of mass publication was advanced evidentially by him, and in argument by Mr Hamer, along the following lines.</p></section><section id="para_47"><span>47.</span><p>First, all of the articles complained of remain online, and have done so since their original publication more than two years ago.</p></section><section id="para_48"><span>48.</span><p>Second, a number of the articles appear reduplicated on both websites, and a number cross refer to each other via embedded hyperlinks.  The final publication (the Wiki page) is a compendious hyperlink library of nearly all the articles complained of.  The articles, in other words, contain within themselves mechanisms of accessibility and republication, and hence maximise readership potential.</p></section><section id="para_49"><span>49.</span><p>Third, and bearing in mind the extent of his reputational engagement in the UK, recent Google searches on Dr Garrett’s name from a UK location were bringing up links to Techrights and Tuxmachines articles complained of (including the final Wiki page publication) on the first page, and, it appears, also did so around the time of the original publication (as one of the Tuxmachines posts seems to have acknowledged).  That suggests both (a) the continuing ready accessibility of the material complained of to those interested in Dr Garrett and (b) the historical popularity of actual access to the Schestowitz websites via Google.  Google is of course only one among a number of popular search engines.</p></section><section id="para_50"><span>50.</span><p>Fourth, both websites are well-established.  It is conspicuous that each has been active over two decades; that is a significant marker in the field.  Dr Garrett’s evidence is that they are serious, sought-after, well-regarded, popular and trusted in the anglophone free software community, including for news, campaigning and educational content.  Neither Dr nor Mrs Schestowitz suggested otherwise.</p></section><section id="para_51"><span>51.</span><p>The final piece in the jigsaw Mr Hamer sought to assemble is a centuries-old English legal principle, derived from the case of <i><u>Armory v Delamirie</u></i><i>(1721) 93 ER 664</i>, that, to the extent that there are gaps in trial evidence, a party who is responsible for them is not entitled to benefit from them.  The principle in <i><u>Armory</u></i> has been recognised in the caselaw as having a potential to apply in defamation actions to assist a claimant in discharging their burden of proof, where a defendant has failed to provide disclosure or evidence of extent of publication (see, for example, <i><u>Dudley v Phillips</u></i><i> <a href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/qb/2022/930">[2022] EWHC 930 (QB)</a></i> at [25]).  Here, Mr Hamer submitted, not only were the relevant analytical data not preserved or disclosed, but a deliberate decision was made by the Defendants to provide no evidence of the extent of the publications for which they were responsible, and therefore not to submit themselves to cross-examination about it.  In those circumstances, Mr Harmer submitted, readership of <i>at least</i> tens of thousands could fairly be inferred in relation to any and all of the publications complained of.</p></section><section id="para_52"><span>52.</span><p>I have reflected carefully on Dr Schestowitz’s challenge, Mr Hamer’s submissions and Dr Garrett’s evidence.  I bear in mind the years-long persistence, cross-referencing and indexing apparent within the articles.  I can and do place weight on the evidence I have to suggest that the publications complained of were accessible to, and accessed by, a UK public searching online for information about Dr Garrett.  It is common ground that Techrights and Tuxmachines are popular and authoritative sites, including in the UK, among those interested or active in the free software community.  I do not understand it to be in dispute that that wider community in the UK is otherwise than substantial, perhaps in the tens or hundreds of thousands.  Dr Garrett is, I have accepted, someone with a profile in that community, and the allegations in the articles complained of are of a sensational and eye-catching nature (and tone).  In these circumstances, it appears to me that a total readership of the articles to date, including by way of some onward republication (percolation), of the order of at least thousands is more probably than not a fair estimate.  And if there are doubts about that, Dr Garrett is entitled to rely on the <i><u>Armory</u></i> principle to have them resolved in his favour.</p></section><section id="lvl_4_6"><span><b><i>(c)</i></b></span><p><b><i>Inherent Probabilities and Conclusions</i></b></p></section><section id="para_53"><span>53.</span><p>A readership of at least thousands makes a fair case, in context, for regarding this as an example of ‘mass publication’.  It is not of the order of a national newspaper or news channel.  But nor is it a case dealing with publication to a limited class of identified or identifiable individuals.  Just as important as the raw numbers is the <i>identity </i>of the likely readership.  I am satisfied that publication in this case was to precisely the constituency – individuals in the UK interested in the free software community and in the doings of free software activists, and who had either already heard of or were likely to take an interest in Dr Garrett – with which Dr Garrett’s UK reputation was most closely engaged.  I have to consider that in conjunction with the gravity of the allegations.  Sockpuppetry, trolling, inappropriate sexual content and hate speech are allegations of profound breaches of the ‘netiquette’ of this community in their own right.  The accusations about the content of this behaviour – serious online crime – push those allegations to the extremes of gravity in context.  Coupled with the imputations going to Dr Garrett’s offline private life, including sexual misconduct (or crime) and the habitual use of illegal class A drugs, it is hard to imagine a more serious assault on the professional and personal reputation of a prominent free software activist.</p></section><section id="para_54"><span>54.</span><p>In all these circumstances, I accept Dr Garrett’s case that not only is the inherent meaning of the publications complained of grave, but they have caused and are likely to cause him serious reputational harm.  Indeed, on the basis of the factual matrix advanced and established, and mindful of the guidance in <i><u>Blake v Fox</u></i>, the inference of serious harm may have to be regarded as inescapable.</p></section></section><section id="lvl_5"><p><b><u>The Statutory Defences to Defamation</u></b></p><section id="lvl_5_1"><span><b><i>(a)</i></b></span><p><b><i>Legal Framework</i></b></p></section><section id="para_55"><span>55.</span><div><p>The statutory defences provided by the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2013/26">Defamation Act 2013</a> are set out as follows, as relevant:</p><blockquote><section><p><i>Defences</i></p></section><section><span><b>2.</b></span><p><b>Truth</b></p></section><section><span>(1)</span><p>It is a defence to an action for defamation for the defendant to show that the imputation conveyed by the statement complained of is substantially true.</p></section><section><span>(2)</span><p>Subsection (3) applies in an action for defamation if the statement complained of conveys two or more distinct imputations.</p></section><section><span>(3)</span><p>If one or more of the imputations is not shown to be substantially true, the defence under this section does not fail if, having regard to the imputations which are shown to be substantially true, the imputations which are not shown to be substantially true do not seriously harm the claimant's reputation..</p></section><section><p>…</p></section><section><span><b>3.</b></span><p><b>Honest opinion</b></p></section><section><span>(1)</span><p>It is a defence to an action for defamation for the defendant to show that the following conditions are met.</p></section><section><span>(2)</span><p>The first condition is that the statement complained of was a statement of opinion.</p></section><section><span>(3)</span><p>The second condition is that the statement complained of indicated, whether in general or specific terms, the basis of the opinion.</p></section><section><span>(4)</span><div><p>The third condition is that an honest person could have held the opinion on the basis of—</p><section><span>(a)</span><p>any fact which existed at the time the statement complained of was published;</p></section><section><span>(b)</span><p>anything asserted to be a fact in a privileged statement published before the statement complained of.</p></section></div></section><section><span>(5)</span><p>The defence is defeated if the claimant shows that the defendant did not hold the opinion.</p></section><section><p>…</p></section><section><span>(7)</span><div><p>For the purposes of subsection (4)(b) a statement is a “privileged statement” if the person responsible for its publication would have one or more of the following defences if an action for defamation were brought in respect of it—</p><section><span>(a)</span><p>a defence under section 4 (publication on matter of public interest);</p></section><p>…</p></div></section><section><span><b>4.</b></span><p><b>Publication on matter of public interest</b></p></section><section><span>(1)</span><div><p>It is a defence to an action for defamation for the defendant to show that—</p><section><span>(a)</span><p>the statement complained of was, or formed part of, a statement on a matter of public interest;

I consider them in turn.</p></section><section id="para_59"><span>59.</span><p>First, the defence relies on an incident a few years prior to the sockpuppet campaign, in which Dr Garrett admittedly registered himself online in two borrowed names for the purpose of making a rhetorical or satirical point about the owner of those names.  Dr Garrett’s evidence is that he did so openly, and with the knowledge of the owner (who had himself vacated the names in order to borrow another user’s nickname – which was in part Dr Garrett’s point in also doing so).  Dr Schestowitz clearly takes exception to that particular piece of theatricality as a major breach of netiquette in its own right, and regards it as a sign or symptom of propensity for sockpuppetry.  But the incident in question, on its face, is plainly something quite different from the covert use of sockpuppet accounts to publish illegal or offensive material, and is not in my judgment capable of indicating any sort of propensity to do that.</p></section><section id="para_60"><span>60.</span><p>Second, it is said there was an incident in which Dr Garrett’s own named account and one of the sockpuppet accounts experienced simultaneous dropped connections.  If established, that could indicate dual operation by a single individual.  The evidence from the Claimant is that the dropped connections were not in fact simultaneous.  I have no evidential basis for doing otherwise than proceeding on that basis.  This pleading cannot in the circumstances support an inference of Dr Garrett’s authorship of the sockpuppet posts.</p></section><section id="para_61"><span>61.</span><p>Third, there are some facts pleaded which are capable of linking the sockpuppets to each other.  They are not capable of being linked to Dr Garrett by that means.</p></section><section id="para_62"><span>62.</span><p>Fourth, it is pleaded that after Dr Schestowitz had made a complaint naming Dr Garrett as the suspected author of the complaints, they subsided.  I have no evidence of this – of its extent, timing, or at all.</p></section><section id="para_63"><span>63.</span><p>Fifth, it is suggested there is some similarity in the language used by Dr Garrett in his own account and that in one of the sockpuppet accounts.  That suggested similarity is not particularised.  I was not taken to it by Dr or Mrs Schestowitz.  It is not immediately obvious on the face of the publications complained of themselves.</p></section><section id="para_64"><span>64.</span><p>Sixth, one of the sockpuppet accounts on one occasion posted a short insult in the Irish language.  Dr Garrett’s evidence is that he does not speak Irish and would have been incapable of posting that insult.</p></section><section id="para_65"><span>65.</span><p>Seventh, it is suggested that one of the sockpuppet accounts used the first person singular in referring to an accusation made against Dr Garrett.  I was not taken to this example, or its context.</p></section><section id="para_66"><span>66.</span><p>Dr and Mrs Schestowitz took me to a small number of posts Dr Garrett had made on a website he had operated some 25 years ago, when he would have been aged about 20.  In one, he made a comment about people feeling the need to punch someone.  In another he referred to being sorely tempted to write a book entitled <i>Axe-murdering for fun and profit</i> as a disincentive to people bothering him.  In a third he expressed exasperation with some individuals along lines that it made him want to stab them and then stab himself.  In a later social media post in 2018 on Twitter (X), he was involved in a game of listing criteria for electing a new prime minister, in which he proposed ‘<i>1. Cancel Brexit; 2. Decriminalise most drugs; 3. Spend less on candles </i>[an internet meme]; <i>4. Resign</i>’.</p></section><section id="para_67"><span>67.</span><p>I had no difficulty in immediately recognising all of these as examples of jocular or facetious rhetoric.  Dr Garrett’s own evidence was that he now considered them callow and in poor taste; they were mostly decades old, and he would not express himself in this kind of way any longer.  Dr Schestowitz plainly regarded them as unpleasant breaches of netiquette.  But the proposition that these examples should be taken literally, and this sort of online discourse considered indicative of a propensity in real life to the use of sockpuppetry to threaten or commit violence, or to an illegal drugs habit, cannot begin to get off the ground.  They are clearly nowhere near any such thing.  Nor are such allusions to bladed weaponry as they contain any sort of basis for inferring that sockpuppet accounts under names such as ‘Dr Axe’ were being operated by Dr Garrett.</p></section><section id="para_68"><span>68.</span><p>It is Dr Garrett’s evidence that at least some of the sockpuppet posts were posted at a time when he can establish he was teaching a university class.  It is also his evidence that it was not practically possible for him to have been the author of those posts, both because he did not have access to the IRC channel on his phone and because he could not have done so without attracting the attention of his students.</p></section><section id="lvl_5_4"><span>(ii)</span><p>Assessment and conclusions</p></section><section id="para_69"><span>69.</span><p>It is plain that the onslaught of sockpuppet trolling to which Mrs Schestowitz in particular was subjected was a truly appalling experience – the very antithesis of everything Tuxmachines and Techrights stands for in the free software community.  There is not the slightest suggestion that either Dr or Mrs Schestowitz did anything to invite or deserve it.  They are both clearly and justifiably angered, dismayed, distressed and hurt by it.  </p></section><section id="para_70"><span>70.</span><p>It is also plain that Dr and Mrs Schestowitz do not think highly of Dr Garrett in general.  Some of that appears to have had its origins in differences of professional views.  Some of it may be to do with his choices to move to Silicon Valley and to work for, with or alongside big tech companies; Dr Schestowitz explained clearly to me how and why they themselves have made different choices.  Some of it may be to do with Dr Garrett’s modes of online expression and what they consider to be his poor netiquette; Dr and Mrs Schestowitz explained to me that these are matters they take very seriously, and that they are serious people running serious websites dealing in serious technical and socio-political matters.  They do not admire facetiousness.</p></section><section id="para_71"><span>71.</span><p>It is also plain enough that Dr and Mrs Schestowitz have found it entirely straightforward to convince themselves that Dr Garrett was behind the trolling.  But the task they have given themselves in pleading the truth defence in defamation proceedings is to establish or prove, on the balance of probabilities, that that is objectively true.  And they have made that exceptionally difficult for themselves by advancing no evidence for it.  I can only uphold a truth defence if I am given a sufficient evidential basis for doing so.  I have looked hard at the defence as pleaded.  I can recognise the matters I have been shown, in all the contextual circumstances, as the <i>reasons</i> Dr and Mrs Schestowitz advance to explain their <i>suspicions</i> of Dr Garrett.  But I cannot possibly recognise in them, singly or together, anything capable of establishing the objective <i>truth</i> that Dr Garrett was their troll.  They are simply not capable of sustaining the weight of a truth defence, or enabling me properly to find that, more probably than not, what the publications said about Dr Garrett was the verifiable truth.</p></section><section id="para_72"><span>72.</span><p>To make such a finding, I would have both to reject Dr Garrett’s own clear evidence, and to discount the possibility that, if Dr and Mrs Schestowitz suspected Dr Garrett of the posts, some third party operator(s) responsible for the sockpuppets might at some level have encouraged that.</p></section><section id="para_73"><span>73.</span><p>I found Dr Garrett in general a straightforward witness who gave a clear account of himself under sustained challenge in the witness box.  I have been given no proper basis for rejecting his plain, unqualified and vehement denial that he ever had anything to do with the sockpuppet campaign against Dr and Mrs Schestowitz.  The matters pleaded by way of the truth defence barely raise a statable case that he did.  I accept Dr Garrett’s evidence.  He is entitled in these circumstances to a clear finding that I have not been shown any evidence on which I can fairly place any weight, that he was responsible for the sockpuppets.</p></section><section id="para_74"><span>74.</span><p>That being so, there is no such evidence before me that Dr Garrett habitually uses illegal class A drugs.  There is no such evidence he has committed any crimes.  There is no such evidence he has threatened, abused or harassed anyone, or that he has espoused or promulgated repugnant and hateful views.  There is no basis on which I can properly find any of the many factual accusations levelled against him in the publications complained of to be true.  The truth defence must fail in its entirety.</p></section><section id="lvl_5_5"><span><b><i>(b)</i></b></span><p><b><i>The Honest Opinion Defence</i></b></p></section><section id="para_75"><span>75.</span><p>The honest opinion defence is pleaded bare, otherwise than by reference to the allegation that Dr Garrett was responsible for the sockpuppet trolling.  In the meanings I have determined, the allegations identified as matters of opinion are all identified as descriptors of the content of the campaign he is alleged to have pursued.  That is the only ‘basis of opinion’ articulated in the articles complained of for the purposes of <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2013/26/section/3/3">section 3(3)</a> of the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2013/26">Defamation Act 2013</a>.</p></section><section id="para_76"><span>76.</span><p>If, as I have concluded, I am unable to uphold the contended factual truth of Dr Garrett’s responsibility for the sockpuppet trolling, that is not a basis on which the honest opinion defence can be upheld either.  An honest person has no basis in contemporaneous <i>fact</i>, as required by <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2013/26/section/3/4">section 3(4)</a>(a), for an opinion that Dr Garrett was responsible for an offensive and hateful campaign, when he cannot be shown to have been responsible for the campaign at all.  The honest opinion defence is unsustainable accordingly.</p></section><section id="lvl_5_6"><span><b><i>(c)</i></b></span><p><b><i>The Public Interest Defence</i></b></p></section><section id="para_77"><span>77.</span><p>I have reminded myself of the review of the authorities on this defence set out by Nicklin J in <i><u>Turley v Unite The Union</u></i><i> <a href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/qb/2019/3547">[2019] EWHC 3547 (QB)</a></i> at [137]-[138].  A three stage approach has to be taken.  Stage one asks whether the statement complained of was, or formed part of, a statement on a matter of public interest.  The second establishes whether the defendant believed publishing the statement complained of was in the public interest.  The third asks whether any such belief was reasonable.</p></section><section id="para_78"><span>78.</span><p>The pleading of the defence in the present case addresses the first question by asserting that all the statements complained of were publications on a matter of public interest, namely ‘<i>the exposure of a vicious and persistent troll committing, among other wrongs, communication and harassment offences in an attempt by the Claimant to intimidate and obstruct promotion of computing standards argued for by the Defendants and that have wide significance within the field of computing</i>’.</p></section><section id="para_79"><span>79.</span><p>The authorities guide that public interest is a broad concept in this context, and can be considered in the light of whether publications make a contribution to a matter of public debate, but is distinguishable from matters that are personal or private.  I can see that the promotion of high standards of online behaviour, and the calling out of unlawful, intimidatory or suppressive behaviour, are capable of being included in the broad ambit of a ‘<i>matter of public interest</i>’.  The question here would really be about whether any of the publications complained of is recognisable as contributing to it.  Dr and Mrs Schestowitz took a decision not to write general articles about the trolling they had received (nor, indeed, it would appear, to block the sockpuppet accounts), but instead (a) to republish quantities of it and (b) to attribute it to Dr Garrett in strongly and personally deprecatory terms.  There can be little doubt on a fair reading of the articles that their focus is squarely on attacking Dr Garrett rather than any more objective or issues-based purpose.</p></section><section id="para_80"><span>80.</span><div><p>In any event, Dr and Mrs Schestowitz face a major hurdle at the second stage of the test, because I have no <i>evidence</i> as to their beliefs at the time of publication.  Here is what Nicklin J said at [138(vii)] in <i><u>Turley v Unite</u></i>:</p><blockquote><section><p>A defendant wishing to rely upon the defence must have believed what s/he published was <i>in </i>the public interest: <i><u>Economou</u></i> [139(2)] and [153] <i>per </i>Warby J (at first instance: <i>[2017] EMLR 4</i>).  The defendant must have addressed his/her mind to the issue.  This element of the defence is not established by showing that a notional reasonable person <i>could</i> have believed that the publication was in the public interest, but that the relevant defendant <i>did</i> believe that it was.  In terms of evidence, if a defendant leaves this issue unaddressed in his/her witness evidence, the defence is likely to fail at this initial hurdle.</p></section></blockquote><p>In the present case, of course, there <i>is</i> no witness evidence from either defendant at all.  They are <i>required </i>to establish their state of mind by setting it out in evidence.  They have not done so.  I cannot just assume it.</p></div></section><section id="para_81"><span>81.</span><div><p>At the third stage, had they been able to reach that far, the problems for sustaining this defence would only multiply.  The reasonableness of any subjective public interest belief has to be tested objectively, including by probing what a publisher had done and not done to ‘<i>guard as far as possible against the publication of untrue defamatory material</i>’ and what checks and enquiries they had made.  Here is Nicklin J again, at [138] of <i><u>Turley v Unite</u></i>:</p><blockquote><section><span>(xv)</span><p>It is a basic requirement of fairness and responsible journalism that someone who is going to publish a defamatory allegation against a person without being required to show that it is true should give him/her a fair opportunity to put his/her side of the story; … This is not only to be fair to the subject, it recognises that the subject may well have relevant factual information to provide that may affect the decision to publish or the terms in which the publication is presented… .  The importance of making an attempt to present the subject of the publication’s side of the story may require the publisher to consider whether others who could reasonably be expected to have relevant information about the allegations should be approached… .</p></section><section><span>(xvi)</span><p>Although … it will not always be necessary to approach the subject of a defamatory article for comment prior to publication, the circumstances in which a publisher will be able to satisfy the Court that it was reasonable not to have done so will necessarily be rare… .</p></section></blockquote></div></section><section id="para_82"><span>82.</span><p>I have no evidence as to any due diligence undertaken before the articles complained of were published.  The defence is pleaded by reference to the reasonableness of reliance on the assemblage of matters I have considered in relation to the truth defence above, which, for the reasons I have given, are not reasonably recognisable as an exercise in considered research and verification.  Dr Garrett was not approached to give his side of the story.  One of the articles complained of (publication 14 and 15) reproduced a paragraph from a letter Dr Garrett had written on 5<sup>th</sup> August 2023, stating that ‘<i>As I have previously informed you via email, I am not responsible for the elusive_woman IRC account or any of the other accounts you have incorrectly asserted I am linked to.  I have provided evidence that I am not that person</i>’ – namely that one of the postings from the account mentioned was made at a time he was teaching a class.  The letter had gone on to challenge Dr Schestowitz for appearing to accept that others might have been involved in the trolling, but that part of the letter was not reproduced.  Beneath the (cropped) picture of the letter was commentary beginning ‘<i>Oh, wow!  How will I know if you are lying again?</i>’ and continuing with invective and multiple accusations against him.  This has little claim to being in the nature of affording a fair right of reply.</p></section><section id="para_83"><span>83.</span><p>Dr Schestowitz made an eloquent case to me for the websites he and his wife operate being quintessentially public interest, not-for-profit endeavours, conscientiously dedicated to the interests of the free software community, trusted and well-regarded as such.  I can accept that.  I can also easily understand that he and Mrs Schestowitz had felt attacked and threatened by the sockpuppet trolling, on both a personal basis and on behalf of all they were trying to do and achieve with their websites.  That is not, however, enough to engage the public interest defence to publication of libels that cannot be shown to be true, blaming and defaming someone for the trolling on no better basis than that produced in these proceedings.  Any belief in the public interest in naming and shaming Dr Garrett – repeatedly, and in the most personal and derogatory terms – on such a basis could not in my judgment be regarded as a reasonable one for the purposes of the defence.</p></section><section id="para_84"><span>84.</span><p>In all these circumstances, the public interest defence inevitably fails.</p></section></section><section id="lvl_6"><p><b><u>Summary and conclusions on liability in defamation</u></b></p><section id="para_85"><span>85.</span><p>Dr and Mrs Schestowitz are proud of Techrights and Tuxmachines – their lives’ dedicated labour, passion and achievement.  They are proud of the websites’ decades-long record of hosting an important and well-regarded IRC for the free software community in the UK and beyond, and of the thousands of informed and informative articles the websites have carried, including the results of some significant investigative journalism.</p></section><section id="para_86"><span>86.</span><p>They were understandably horrified to become the victims of an anonymous internet campaign of abuse, threats and harassment a couple of years ago.  Nothing could have been further from the websites’ ethos, and it must have been traumatising for them on a personal level.  Their response was publicly and repeatedly to blame Dr Garrett for it all, having convinced themselves they had some reasons for suspecting him of being behind the anonymous trolling – and to do so in a manner that was bitter, highly personal and thoroughly derogatory.  They were undeterred by his protests that he had nothing to do with it.  They steadfastly refused to take their accusatory material down.</p></section><section id="para_87"><span>87.</span><p>Dr Garrett has been successful in advancing a defamation claim to the point at which Dr and Mrs Schestowitz are required by law either to concede the claim or defend it.  They chose to defend it, but they chose to do so without advancing any evidence in support of their defences.  A court’s job is to apply the law to the facts as it finds them, and to find the relevant facts according to the evidence before it.  If it is provided with no evidence in support of a libel defence, there is a limit to what a court can do.</p></section><section id="para_88"><span>88.</span><p>I have considered the defences pleaded by Dr and Mrs Schestowitz as best I can, given that they provided me with no evidence to work with.  The bases they advanced for their suspicions that Dr Garrett was behind the sockpuppet trolling were simply not capable in the circumstances of adding up to an evidential proof on which a court could properly find that was, objectively, true.  That allegation was at the heart of their resistance to Dr Garrett’s claim, and they have not enabled me properly to do anything other than reject it as capable of founding a defence, either by establishing that they had done due diligence at the time, or by advancing evidence or proof of objective truth I could consider at trial.</p></section><section id="para_89"><span>89.</span><p>A defamation claimant in these circumstances is entitled to a judgment, and to remedies, which repudiate the publications complained of, vindicate his reputation, and restore his good name.</p></section></section><section id="lvl_7"><p><b><u>The Data Protection Claim</u></b></p><section id="para_90"><span>90.</span><p>Mr Hamer indicated to me at trial that, in the event that I upheld Dr Garrett’s claim in defamation, I could consider myself invited to conclude that it was unnecessary for me to consider the data protection claim on its merits.

I was told that they experienced it as motivated by an intention to harm them and their websites financially, and to interfere with their investigative journalism.  They objected specifically to Dr Garrett’s having made contact with their internet service provider and other web hosts in an attempt to have the publications taken down, to the obtaining of their postal and online contact details, to the threatening tone of solicitors’ correspondence, to the conduct of the disclosure process, to the conduct by the same firm of solicitors of a second set of proceedings against them which Dr and Mrs Schestowitz had unsuccessfully sought to have consolidated with Dr Garrett’s claim, and to a reference made in formal documentation to a previous name of Mrs Schestowitz, a matter to which she took extremely strong exception.

As Nicklin J observed in <i><u>Monir v Wood</u></i><i> [2018] EWHC 3525 QB</i> at [228], ‘<i>Damages for libel cannot be calculated on any mathematical basis.  By definition, they seek to provide compensation for harm that it is almost impossible to quantify in monetary terms</i>’.

The Court’s task is to assess the proper level of compensation, taking into account all the relevant factors, which include any elements of aggravation.  If, as the authorities recognise, the assessment of libel damages can never be mechanical or scientific, attributing a specific figure to something as nebulous as aggravation has an unconvincing foundation.  Worse, as it would represent the imposition of a clearly identified additional sum of money, it risks the appearance of being directly attributed to the conduct of the defendant.  That comes perilously close to looking like a penalty.  For these reasons, I consider the better course is to fix a single award which, faithful to the principles by which damages in defamation are assessed, is solely to compensate the Claimant.  The award can properly reflect any additional hurt and distress caused to the Claimant by the conduct of the Defendants.  </p></section></blockquote></div></section><section id="para_101"><span>101.</span><p>As well as being broad and holistic, the exercise is also highly fact-specific.  But the framework of principle does include maintaining broad comparability within the tort and between torts.  So regard may be had to other awards in defamation cases of a comparable nature (although the authorities emphasise that no two defamation cases are ever really the same).  Regard may also be had to the (very differently assessed) awards in personal injury cases to ensure that damages for defamation are, and are seen to be, proportionate and realistic.  But these comparative exercises are by way of guidance only, and the focus must remain, intensely, on the circumstances of the individual case.</p></section><section id="para_102"><span>102.</span><p>The relevant legal principles particularly applicable to assessing libel damages were set out clearly by Warby J (as he then was) in <i><u>Sloutsker v Romanova</u></i><i>[2015] EWHC 2053 </i>at [74]-[82], and in <i><u>Barron v Vines</u></i><i> [2016] EWHC 1226 </i>at [20]-[21].  Broadly, the purpose of an award of damages in defamation proceedings is to compensate for injury to reputation and to feelings, and in particular to vindicate claimants, so far as money can to do that.  Vindication and compensation are not to be thought of in compartmentalised terms: the overall purpose of the award remains to restore a claimant, to the extent money can do so, to the position as if the libel had not occurred.  But in defamation cases that means not only redressing the balance in terms of quantifiable losses, but unequivocally, albeit  proportionately, restoring a claimant’s standing to its previous state.  As the authorities put it, the sum awarded must be an outward and visible sign of vindication, sending a message restoring a claimant’s good name ‘<i>sufficient to convince a bystander of the baselessness of the charge</i>’.  If an award fails to achieve vindication, it fails properly to compensate and restore the <i>status quo ante</i>.</p></section><section id="para_103"><span>103.</span><p>In assessing damages, the court takes account of all the relevant facts, and in particular the gravity of the defamation, the extent of its publication, and evidence of the harm it has done.  The award must in the end be no more than is justified by the legitimate aim of protecting reputation, necessary in a democratic society in pursuit of that aim, and proportionate to that need.</p></section><section id="lvl_9_3"><span>(ii)</span><p>Injunctive relief</p></section><section id="para_104"><span>104.</span><p>Injunctive relief is regularly afforded to successful defamation claimants, to restrain the publication of the same or similar libel.  Final injunctive relief, restraining publication post-judgment, is distinctively different from pre-trial interim relief, since the implication of the judgment is necessarily that the published libel is not a species of free speech protected by Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  Nicklin J’s observation about permanent, post-judgment, injunction in <i><u>Lachaux</u></i><i></i>at [239] was that ‘<i>it is the natural remedy that flows from the Court’s decision</i>’, and, in the absence of satisfactory undertakings, it may be necessary to injunct further publication to give full effect to that decision. </p></section><section id="para_105"><span>105.</span><p>But, importantly, it remains a discretionary remedy.  It is not available as of right.  In considering whether to exercise its discretion, and if so how, a court will have regard to all the circumstances of a case, including the conduct of the parties, and will focus in particular on assessing the risk of repetition of the defamation should injunctive relief not be granted.</p></section><section id="lvl_9_4"><span>(iii)</span><p>Order for publication of judgment summary</p></section><section id="para_106"><span>106.</span><div><p><a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2013/26/section/12">Section 12</a> of the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2013/26">Defamation Act 2013</a> provides as follows:</p><blockquote><section><p><b>Power of court to order a summary of its judgment to be published</b></p></section><section><span>(1)</span><p>Where a court gives judgment for the claimant in an action for defamation the court may order the defendant to publish a summary of the judgment.</p></section><section><span>(2)</span><p>The wording of any summary and the time, manner, form and place of its publication are to be for the parties to agree.</p></section><section><span>(3)</span><p>If the parties cannot agree on the wording, the wording is to be settled by the court.</p></section><section><span>(4)</span><p>If the parties cannot agree on the time, manner, form or place of publication, the court may give such directions as to those matters as it considers reasonable and practicable in the circumstances.</p></section><section><p>(5)…</p></section></blockquote></div></section><section id="para_107"><span>107.</span><p>As confirmed by <i><u>Monir v Wood</u></i> at [239]-[242], the power to order publication of a judgment summary is itself a distinct incursion into a defendant’s rights to freedom of expression, protected by Article 10 of the ECHR, and must be exercised mindfully of that.  The incursion involved must be justified by reference to the legitimate aim of protecting reputation, and necessary and proportionate to that aim.</p></section><section id="lvl_9_5"><span><b><i>(b)</i></b></span><p><b><i>Quantum of damages</i></b></p></section><section id="para_108"><span>108.</span><p>The most significant relevant factors in the present case seem to me to be these.</p></section><section id="para_109"><span>109.</span><p>First, there is the gravity of the libellous allegations in this case which, in multiple and detailed respects, profoundly impugn Dr Garrett’s personal integrity, social standing and professional credibility.</p></section><section id="para_110"><span>110.</span><p>Second, there is the fact that they were published from websites regarded as authoritative and reliable, and repeatedly, to the very audience – including the free software community in England – in which Dr Garrett’s reputation here is most deeply invested, and which has the highest capacity to think the worse of him as a result.  This was a substantial audience estimated to be of the order of at least thousands.</p></section><section id="para_111"><span>111.</span><p>Third, there is the fact that Dr and Mrs Schestowitz have insisted on the truth of their allegations all the way to trial, have offered no evidence for it, have refused to take down the material complained of and have made no retraction of or apology for the content.  They appear to have thought that this was a point of journalistic principle and integrity, but they do not appear to have engaged in that capacity with the need or desirability for doing more, when faced with Dr Garrett’s assurances that he had nothing to do with the sockpuppet accounts, than simply dismissing them as probable lies.  Mrs Schestowitz did however, in her closing submissions at trial, offer Dr Garrett an apology to the extent of having hurt his feelings.  I thought that was at least well-intentioned and genuine, and I give her credit for it.  I note also that, while Dr Schestowitz challenged Dr Garrett hard in a range of matters under cross-examination, he did so courteously and without <i>directly</i> maintaining the underlying truth of the <i>content</i> of the allegations beyond those of his responsibility for the trolling.</p></section><section id="para_112"><span>112.</span><p>Fourth, I note Dr Garrett’s evidence that the libels have caused him to fear for his professional and academic reputation, for the security of his employment and for his future employment prospects.  He has had experience of being approached directly by a colleague and a former colleague over the content of the publications and had to defend himself, and has suffered the natural anxiety and humiliation of wondering what others are thinking of him and whether he may be being avoided or overlooked for opportunities because of what has been said about him.  I bear in mind also that he does not suggest there is evidence to date that he has suffered actual employment detriment, and I note the strength of his professional reputation and the extent to which that might be able in itself to be robust to the depredations of gossip and rumour.</p></section><section id="para_113"><span>113.</span><p>Mr Hamer asks for a single global sum to vindicate Dr Garrett’s reputation and compensate him for distress in relation to all the publications complained of.  He proposed a range of comparator decisions for my consideration, in support of a submission that libel damages approaching £100,000 would be appropriate.  I have considered these.  I noted in particular the case of <i><u>Fentiman v Marsh</u></i><i> [2019] EWHC 2099</i> in which an award of £55,000 was made in respect of allegations in a blog read by about 500 people that the claimant, a company CEO, was a hacker responsible for illegal cyber-attacks on a company.  The tone of the allegations there were something comparable to those in the present case – somewhat personally and floridly put.  I hold the effects of inflation in mind.</p></section><section id="para_114"><span>114.</span><p>In my judgment, in all these circumstances, the minimum sum necessary to convince a fair-minded bystander of the baselessness of the allegations against him, to vindicate his reputation and restore his standing, and to compensate him for the consequences he has suffered, is £70,000.</p></section><section id="lvl_9_6"><span><b><i>(c)</i></b></span><p><b><i>Injunctive Relief</i></b></p></section><section id="para_115"><span>115.</span><p>Dr and Mrs Schestowitz continue to publish and republish the libels.  They have no entitlement to do so.  This is not a form of freedom of expression which is protected by law.  They have published further similar defamatory statements since the commencement of these proceedings.  In the absence of any indication that they will voluntarily desist, remove the material objected to, and give satisfactory undertakings not to repeat the same or similar allegations, they face being compelled to do so by means of an injunction enforceable by proceedings for contempt of court.</p></section><section id="lvl_9_7"><span><b><i>(d)</i></b></span></section><section id="para_116"><span>116.</span><p>A principal consideration in deciding whether to exercise the discretion to compel publication of a summary of a libel judgment is whether it is likely to be effective in coming to the attention of those to whom the original libel was published, and therefore in undoing its original reputational harm and vindicating the claimant.</p></section><section id="para_117"><span>117.</span><p>Publication of a short summary of this judgment on Techrights and Tuxmachines would, in my view, be likely to be effective in reaching the UK audience to which the libels were published.  It would be a clear statement to the free software community here that Dr Garrett cannot be regarded as having any stain on his character arising out of the accusations carried by those websites and complained of in these proceedings.  That would, in my judgment, be a necessary and proportionate means of vindicating and protecting his reputation and rights.</p></section></section><section id="lvl_10"><p><b>Decision</b></p><section id="para_118"><span>118.</span><p>Dr Garrett’s claim in defamation succeeds.  He is entitled to the vindication of this judgment, and to the remedies I have indicated.  The counterclaim of Dr and Mrs Schestowitz in harassment is dismissed.</p></section><section id="para_119"><span>119.</span><p>Dr and Mrs Schestowitz experienced appalling anonymous abuse, threats and harassment online.  They reacted by using their websites – well-established, respected and trusted in the free software community, and carrying their own personal authority as free software activists – to blame and upbraid Dr Garrett for being responsible for this, and to vilify him accordingly.  They  have been unable to establish any recognisable basis in law for doing so.  They have advanced no evidence for it; I was shown nothing in these proceedings capable of establishing in a court of law that Dr Garrett was in fact responsible or had anything to do with it.  Their own campaign of allegations is not in these circumstances a lawful exercise of free speech, much less an example of investigative journalism.  It is unsubstantiated character assassination and it must stop.</p></section></section></section></article>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p>Students at the University of Staffordshire have said they feel “robbed of knowledge and enjoyment” after a course they hoped would launch their digital careers turned out to be taught in large part by AI.</p><p>James and Owen were among 41 students who took a coding module at Staffordshire last year, hoping to change careers through a government-funded <a href="https://findapprenticeshiptraining.apprenticeships.education.gov.uk/courses/25" data-link-name="in body link">apprenticeship</a> programme designed to help them become cybersecurity experts or software engineers.</p><p>But after a term of AI-generated slides being read, at times, by an AI voiceover, James said he had lost faith in the programme and the people running it, worrying he had “used up two years” of his life on a course that had been done “in the cheapest way possible”.</p><p>“If we handed in stuff that was AI-generated, we would be kicked out of the uni, but we’re being taught by an AI,” said James during a confrontation with his lecturer recorded as a part of the course in October 2024.</p><p>James and other students confronted university officials multiple times about the AI materials. But the university appears to still be using AI-generated materials to teach the course. This year, the university uploaded a policy statement to the course website appearing to justify the use of AI, laying out “a framework for academic professionals leveraging AI automation” in scholarly work and teaching.</p><p>The university’s public-facing policies <a href="https://libguides.staffs.ac.uk/c.php?g=709503&amp;p=5118475" data-link-name="in body link">limit</a> students’ use of AI, saying students who outsource work to AI or pass off AI-generated work as their own are breaching its integrity policy and may be challenged for academic misconduct.</p><p>“I’m midway through my life, my career,” James said. “I don’t feel like I can now just go away and do another career restart. I’m stuck with this course.”</p><p>The Staffordshire case comes as <a href="https://information-services.ed.ac.uk/computing/comms-and-collab/elm/generative-ai-guidance-for-staff" data-link-name="in body link">more</a> and <a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/about/strategy/learning-and-teaching/ai-guidance" data-link-name="in body link">more</a> universities use AI tools – to teach students, generate course materials and give personalised feedback. A Department of Education policy paper released in August <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/generative-artificial-intelligence-in-education/generative-artificial-intelligence-ai-in-education" data-link-name="in body link">hailed</a> this development, saying generative AI “has the power to transform education”. A survey <a href="https://repository.jisc.ac.uk/9702/1/DEI-2024-teaching-staff-he-report.pdf" data-link-name="in body link">last year (pdf)</a> of 3,287 higher education teaching staff by the educational technology firm Jisc found that nearly a quarter were using AI tools in their teaching.</p><p>For students, AI teaching appears to be less transformative than it is demoralising. In the US, students post negative online <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/14/technology/chatgpt-college-professors.html" data-link-name="in body link">reviews</a> about professors who use AI. In the UK, undergraduates have taken to Reddit to complain about their lecturers copying and pasting feedback from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/UniUK/comments/1m5de13/disheartened_after_receiving_possibly_aigenerated/" data-link-name="in body link">ChatGPT</a> or using AI-generated <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/UniUK/comments/1msts5q/nah_cuz_wtf_is_this_why_are_my_lectures_now_using/#:~:text=Please%20tell%20me%20this%20isn,written%20essays%20and%20images%20:/" data-link-name="in body link">images</a> in courses.</p><p>“I understand the pressures on lecturers right now that may force them to use AI, it just feels disheartening,” one student <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/UniUK/comments/1m5de13/disheartened_after_receiving_possibly_aigenerated/" data-link-name="in body link">wrote</a>.</p><p>James and Owen said they noticed the use of AI in their Staffordshire course “almost immediately” last year when, during their first class, the lecturer put on a PowerPoint presentation that included an AI version of his voice reading off the slides.</p><p>Soon after, they said, they noticed other signs that some course materials were AI-generated, including American English inconsistently edited to British English, suspicious file names, as well as “generic, surface-level information” that occasionally referred inexplicably to US legislation.</p><p>Signs of AI-generated material continued this year. In one course video uploaded to the website, a voiceover presenting the material suddenly morphs into a Spanish accent for about 30 seconds, before switching back to a British accent.</p><figure id="1d1ad45b-fcd4-42bc-9b5b-2e17dc663380" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.YoutubeBlockElement"><gu-island name="YoutubeBlockComponent" priority="critical" deferuntil="visible" props="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;06b16388-660f-431f-8d2d-715214a92f9c&quot;,&quot;assetId&quot;:&quot;t1AJFck5ESA&quot;,&quot;index&quot;:13,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;design&quot;:0,&quot;display&quot;:0,&quot;theme&quot;:0},&quot;isMainMedia&quot;:false,&quot;expired&quot;:false,&quot;posterImage&quot;:&quot;https://media.guim.co.uk/aa08b4030303ee84261c97e6b9085d23183432ac/264_0_2116_1190/2116.jpg&quot;,&quot;duration&quot;:69,&quot;mediaTitle&quot;:&quot;Voiceover accent changes mid-lesson in alleged AI-generated course –&nbsp;video&quot;,&quot;origin&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com&quot;,&quot;stickyVideos&quot;:false,&quot;enableAds&quot;:true,&quot;iconSizeOnDesktop&quot;:&quot;large&quot;,&quot;iconSizeOnMobile&quot;:&quot;large&quot;,&quot;hidePillOnMobile&quot;:false}"><div data-chromatic="ignore"><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="36" height="23" viewBox="0 0 36 23"><path d="M3.2 0l-3.2 3.3v16.4l3.3 3.3h18.7v-23h-18.8m30.4 1l-8.6 8v5l8.6 8h2.4v-21h-2.4"></path></svg></span><span>Voiceover accent changes mid-lesson in alleged AI-generated course –&nbsp;video</span></figcaption></div></gu-island></figure><p>The Guardian reviewed materials from the Staffordshire course and used two different AI detectors – Winston AI and Originality AI – to scan course materials from this year. Both of them found that a number of the assignments and presentations had “a very high likelihood of being AI-generated”.</p><p>Early in the course, James said, he brought his concerns to the student representative during a monthly meeting. Then, in late November, he aired them during a lecture, which was recorded as a part of the course materials. In the recording, he asks the lecturer to not bother with the slides.</p><p>“I know these slides are AI-generated, I know that everyone in this meeting knows these slides are AI-generated, I would rather you just scrap these slides,” he says. “I do not want to be taught by GPT.”</p><p>Soon after, the student representative on the course chimes in, saying: “We have fed this back, James, and the response was that teachers are allowed to use a variety of tools. We were quite frustrated by this response.”</p><p>Another student says: “There are some useful things in the presentation. But it’s like, 5% is useful nuggets, and a lot is repetition. There is some gold in the bottom of this pan. But presumably we could get the gold ourselves, by asking ChatGPT.”</p><p>The lecturer laughs uncomfortably. “I appreciate people being candid …” he says, then he changes the subject to another tutorial he made – using ChatGPT. “I’ve done this short notice, to be honest,” he says.</p><p>Eventually, the course head told James that two human lecturers would be going over the material for the final session, “so you don’t get an AI experience”.</p><p>In response to a query from the Guardian, the University of Staffordshire said “academic standards and learning outcomes were maintained” on the course.</p><p>It said: “The University of Staffordshire supports the responsible and ethical use of digital technologies in line with our guidance. AI tools may support elements of preparation, but they do not replace academic expertise and must always be used in ways that uphold academic integrity and sector standards.”</p><p>While the university brought in a non-AI lecturer for the last lecture in the course, James and Owen said this was too little, too late, especially because the university appears to have used AI in this year’s teaching material as well.</p><p>“I feel like a bit of my life was stolen,” James said.</p><p>Owen, who is in the middle of a career change, said he had chosen the course to get the underlying knowledge, not just the qualification – and felt it was a waste of time.</p><p>“To be sat there with this material in front of you that is just really not worth anyone’s time, when you could be spending that time actually engaging with something worthwhile, is really frustrating,” he said.</p></div></div>]]></description>

   <p>40 years ago — on November 18, 1985 — a new comic strip appeared in the newspaper: <em>Calvin and Hobbes.</em></p>   <p>Hobbes was a stuffed tiger, but in the mind of 6-year-old Calvin he was a wryly observant companion for his day-to-day challenges and wildly imaginative adventures.</p>   <p>Adventures of the beloved duo lasted just a decade. Their creator — cartoonist Bill Watterson — walked away from <em>Calvin and Hobbes</em> at the height of its popularity. </p>   <p>Watterson — who has given few interviews — seamlessly combined the silly, the fantastic and the profound in his strip. That slightly demented quality captured editor Lee Salem, who spoke with NPR's Renee Montagne in 2005.</p>   
   <p><em>The following exchange has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p>      <h3>Interview highlights</h3>   <p><strong>Lee Salem:</strong> I remember it when I first read it, and it all... it literally took my breath away. And I circulated it in the office, and the response was immediate. It was fresh, it was funny, the art was strong, and here's this archetypal little boy living a life that some of us lived or wanted to live or remembered living. ... </p>   <p>One of the single favorites that I have is actually on my wall in the office, and it shows Calvin in bed, obviously with a fever or something. He's got a thermometer in his mouth. You hear the words from a television. He's watching a soap opera — you know, "If you leave your spouse and I'll leave mine and we can get married." And it goes on and on and on, as lurid soap operas sometimes do. And Calvin turns to the reader with a big grin on his face, and he says, "Sometimes, I learn more when I stay home from school than when I go." And I just thought that was so funny. And, amazingly, when it ran, we actually got complaints from readers who said, "Well, you know, you're advocating that children stay home and watch adult soap operas." And somehow, the whole sense of irony was lost in that, but I don't think it was lost on me. I love that strip.</p>   
   <p><strong>Renee Montagne:</strong> You know, I describe him as a little boy with his tiger friend, but there's so much more to it than that. So there's one where they're sitting philosophizing, as they often do, on the grass, this time under a tree. Hobbes is looking at the sky and saying, "Do you think there's a god?" And they're both gazing and thinking, and then in the fourth panel, Calvin thinks about it. And then do you remember what he says?</p>   <p><strong>Salem:</strong> Yeah. "Yeah, well, someone is out to get me."</p>   <p><strong>Montagne:</strong> Calvin was preceded into existence by some pretty famous little boys: Charlie Brown, Dennis the Menace. What made him different?</p>   <p><strong>Salem:</strong> You know, we saw Calvin living in a world he never made, populated by adults and teachers, and he was trying to deal with that and accomplish what he could. I think Calvin has a bit more perhaps Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn in him than Charlie Brown. Hobbes I see almost as the alter ego of Calvin. He's a balancing act that allows Calvin to exist. He provides commentary on some of Calvin's crazy adventures and attitudes.</p>   <p><strong>Montagne:</strong> Hobbes goes from being a stuffed tiger when there's any other person in the room, to the real Hobbes we know and love. Is Hobbes real or not?</p>   <p><strong>Salem:</strong> He is to me, and obviously he is to Calvin. Whether he is to the other characters or not is an open question. But I think one of the things Bill brought to the art board was this wonderful ability to take a child's imagination and fantasy life and make it real. It really is irrelevant whether Hobbes has an existence as we would define it. For Calvin, he is there. He's a buddy, he's a companion, he's a friend.</p>   
   <p><em>Lee Salem edited </em>Calvin and Hobbes<em> until the comic strip ended in 1995. Creator Bill Watterson said at the time that he wanted to explore a canvas beyond the four panels of a daily newspaper, and to work at what he called "a more thoughtful pace," but has produced little public work since then.</em></p>   <p><em>Salem died in 2019.</em></p>

    <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2511.15304v1">HTML (experimental)</a></p><blockquote>
            <span>Abstract:</span>We present evidence that adversarial poetry functions as a universal single-turn jailbreak technique for large language models (LLMs). Across 25 frontier proprietary and open-weight models, curated poetic prompts yielded high attack-success rates (ASR), with some providers exceeding 90%. Mapping prompts to MLCommons and EU CoP risk taxonomies shows that poetic attacks transfer across CBRN, manipulation, cyber-offence, and loss-of-control domains. Converting 1,200 MLCommons harmful prompts into verse via a standardized meta-prompt produced ASRs up to 18 times higher than their prose baselines. Outputs are evaluated using an ensemble of open-weight judge models and a human-validated stratified subset (with double-annotations to measure agreement). Disagreements were manually resolved. Poetic framing achieved an average jailbreak success rate of 62% for hand-crafted poems and approximately 43% for meta-prompt conversions (compared to non-poetic baselines), substantially outperforming non-poetic baselines and revealing a systematic vulnerability across model families and safety training approaches. These findings demonstrate that stylistic variation alone can circumvent contemporary safety mechanisms, suggesting fundamental limitations in current alignment methods and evaluation protocols.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><h2>What's new in PHP 8.5</h2><p><small>Written on 2025-11-20</small></p></div><p>PHP 8.5 was released on <a href="https://wiki.php.net/todo/php85">November 20, 2025</a>. It includes the pipe operator, clone with, a new URI parser, and more.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/pipe-operator-v3">The pipe operator</a></h2>
<p>PHP 8.5 introduces the new pipe operator that makes chaining output from one function to another a lot easier. Instead of deeply nested function calls like this:</p>
<pre><span>$input</span> = <span>' Some kind of string. '</span>;

<span>$output</span> = <span>strtolower</span>(
    <span>str_replace</span>([<span>'.'</span>, <span>'/'</span>, <span>'…'</span>], <span>''</span>,
        <span>str_replace</span>(<span>' '</span>, <span>'-'</span>,
            <span>trim</span>(<span>$input</span>)
        )
    )
);
</pre>
<p>You can now write this:</p>
<pre><span>$output</span> = <span>$input</span>
    |&gt; <span>trim</span>(...)
    |&gt; (<span>fn</span> (<span><span>string</span> $string</span>) =&gt; <span>str_replace</span>(<span>' '</span>, <span>'-'</span>, <span>$string</span>))
    |&gt; (<span>fn</span> (<span><span>string</span> $string</span>) =&gt; <span>str_replace</span>([<span>'.'</span>, <span>'/'</span>, <span>'…'</span>], <span>''</span>, <span>$string</span>))
    |&gt; <span>strtolower</span>(...);
</pre>
<p>I've done a deep-dive into this new operator, and you can <a href="https://stitcher.io/blog/pipe-operator-in-php-85">read about it here</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/clone_with_v2">Clone with</a></h2>
<p>There's now a way to assign new values to cloned objects <em>while</em> cloning them:</p>
<pre><span>final</span> <span>class</span> <span>Book</span>
{
    <span>public</span> <span>function</span> <span>__construct</span>(<span>
        <span>public</span> <span>string</span> <span>$title</span>,
        <span>public</span> <span>string</span> <span>$description</span>,
    </span>) {}

    <span>public</span> <span>function</span> <span>withTitle</span>(<span><span>string</span> $title</span>): <span>self</span>
    {
        <span>return</span> <span>clone</span>(<span>$this</span>, [
            <span>'title'</span> =&gt; <span>$title</span>,
        ]);
    }
}
</pre>
<p>I think this is a great feature. The only thing I find unfortunate is that it doesn't work when cloning readonly properties from the outside (which I think is a common use case). To do so, you have to specifically reset the propery's write access to <code><span>public</span>(<span>set</span>)</code>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkuy11kLlmM">I explained the problem here</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/marking_return_value_as_important"><code>(void)</code> cast and <code>#[NoDiscard]</code></a></h2>
<p>You can now mark a function with the <code><span>#[<span>NoDiscard</span>]</span></code> attribute, indicating that its return value must be used. If nothing happens with that return value, a warning will be triggered.</p>
<pre><span><span>#[<span>NoDiscard</span>(<span>"you must use this return value, it's very important."</span>)]</span></span>
<span>function</span> <span>foo</span>(): <span>string</span> {
    <span>return</span> <span>'hi'</span>;
}




<span>foo</span>();


<span>$string</span> = <span>foo</span>();
</pre>
<p>The warning can still be surpressed by using the new <code>(<span>void</span>)</code> cast:</p>
<pre>(<span><span>void</span></span>) <span>foo</span>();
</pre>
<hr>
<h2><a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/closures_in_const_expr">Closure improvements</a></h2>
<p>Closures and first-class callables can now be used in constant expressions. In practice this means you'll be able to define closures in attributes, which is an incredible new feature:</p>
<pre><span><span>#[<span>SkipDiscovery</span>(<span>static</span> <span>function</span> (</span><span><span>Container</span> <span>$container</span></span><span>): <span>bool</span> {
    <span>return</span> ! <span>$container</span>-&gt;<span>get</span>(<span>Application</span>::<span>class</span>) <span>instanceof</span> <span>ConsoleApplication</span>;
})]</span></span>
<span>final</span> <span>class</span> <span>BlogPostEventHandlers</span>
{  }
</pre>
<p>Note that these kinds of closures must always be explicitly marked as <code><span>static</span></code>, since they aren't attached to a <code><span>$this</span></code> scope. They also cannot access variables from the outside scope with <code><span>use</span></code>.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/error_backtraces_v2">Backtraces for fatal errors</a></h2>
<p>A small but awesome change: fatal errors will now include backtraces.</p>
<pre>Fatal error: Maximum execution time of 1 second exceeded in example.php on line 6
Stack trace:
#0 example.php(6): usleep(100000)
#1 example.php(7): recurse()
#2 example.php(7): recurse()
#3 example.php(7): recurse()
#4 example.php(7): recurse()
#5 example.php(7): recurse()
#6 example.php(7): recurse()
#7 example.php(7): recurse()
#8 example.php(7): recurse()
#9 example.php(7): recurse()
#10 example.php(10): recurse()
#11 {main}
</pre>
<hr>
<h2><a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/array_first_last">Added array_first() and array_last()</a></h2>
<p>Perhaps a bit overdue (<code><span>array_key_first</span>()</code> and <code><span>array_key_last</span>()</code> were added in PHP 7.3), but we finally get built-in functions to get the first and last elements from arrays! So instead of writing this:</p>
<pre><span>$first</span> = <span>$array</span>[<span>array_key_first</span>(<span>$array</span>)] ?? <span>null</span>;
</pre>
<p>You can now write this:</p>
<pre><span>$first</span> = <span>array_first</span>(<span>$array</span>);
</pre>
<hr>
<h2><a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/url_parsing_api">URI parsing</a></h2>
<p>There's a brand new URI implemention that makes working with URIs a lot easier:</p>
<pre><span>use</span> <span>Uri\Rfc3986\Uri</span>;

<span>$uri</span> = <span>new</span> <span>Uri</span>(<span>'https://tempestphp.com/2.x/getting-started/introduction'</span>);

<span>$uri</span>-&gt;<span>getHost</span>();
<span>$uri</span>-&gt;<span>getScheme</span>();
<span>$uri</span>-&gt;<span>getPort</span>();


</pre>
<hr>
<h2><a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/delayedtargetvalidation_attribute">The <code>#[DelayedTargetValidation]</code> attribute</a></h2>
<p>Some built-in attributes (like <code><span>#[<span>Override</span>]</span></code>) are validated at compile-time rather than at runtime when being called via reflection. The <code><span>#[<span>DelayedTargetValidation</span>]</span></code> allows you to postpone that validation to a runtime:</p>
<pre><span>class</span> <span>Child</span> <span>extends</span> <span>Base</span>
{
	<span>#[<span>DelayedTargetValidation</span>]</span>
	<span>#[<span>Override</span>]</span>
	<span>public</span> <span>const</span> <span>NAME</span> = <span>'Child'</span>;

	
}
</pre>
<p>This attribute is added to manage backwards compatibility issues. You can <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/delayedtargetvalidation_attribute#example">read a concrete example here</a>.</p>

<p>Textile made of natural stone? Yes, it is possible!</p>
<p>First the basalt is melted at a temperature of 1,400 °C (2550 °F). The molten rock is then extruded through small nozzles for the production of filaments of basalt fibers. The high modulus of elasticity of the product results in an excellent tensile strength, which is more than twice the tensile strength of steel.</p>
<p>Basalt Woven Textile has high corrosive and chemical resistance to the influence of a corrosive media: salt solutions, acid solutions and particularly alkali liquids. The specific strength of basalt fiber exceeds the strength of alloyed steel by a factor of 2,5 and the strength of glass fiber by a factor of 1,5. Heat-insulating items made from basalt fiber combined with inorganic binding agents may be used by temperatures up to 700°С. In addition there is a range of compositions consisting of basalt rocks that have a higher thermal stability – up to 800°С.</p>
<p>Basalt fibers also have high electric-insulating characteristics and transparency for electromagnetic radiation. These properties allow basalt fiber to be used for production of electric insulating materials for low-voltage (up to 250 V) and high-voltage (500 V) equipment.</p>
