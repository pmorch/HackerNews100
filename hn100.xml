Picotool was used to write the covert code to the OTP. Then the RP2350's OTP memory was locked behind the Page Locks hardware protection feature, set to an 'inaccessible' state '13:12' as per the table above. Firmware was also signed, with Secure Boot enabled, and they disabled the chip debug feature, so prying eyes couldn't get to the secret via a Serial Wire Debug (SWD) interface. Furthermore, all other bootkeys were disabled, the RP2350 Glitch Detector was turned on and then set to its highest sensitivity. It certainly sounds like it was locked down.</p><p>Cullen says he started his hacking process by studying the RP2350 data sheet and the dependencies outlined in the documentation. Then Cullen drilled down on how the RP2350 boots and establishes its security settings, with particular attention to the OTP.</p><p>Cullen's first idea was to get the OTP to misread its critical bit settings, you could get the chip to work in a non-secure way. Cullen even X-rayed the RP2350 as part of his investigations and annotated the chip blocks. However, he stresses that this was just a pursuit of interest and not really instrumental to beating the challenge.</p><p>Research compelled Cullen to focus on Pin 53, labeled USB-OTP_VDD, as it is connected to OTP (and USB) functions. Perhaps a hacker could "mess with this power supply externally" to affect these functions, he pondered. So he took off the chip and isolated Pin 53 (physically cutting PCB trace), so it was ready to be electrically tampered with separately on a reassembled board.</p><div data-hydrate="true" id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-nQ4sTaGVvBq3RDynH4YwZQ"><section><p>Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.</p></section></div><div aria-hidden="false" data-swipeable="true" data-hydrate="true" id="slice-container-imageGallery-nQ4sTaGVvBq3RDynH4YwZQ-V5ppwQPQlYKQEEzp8YfYNSf4WgG7yCzH"><figure data-bordeaux-image-check="false"><div><picture data-hydrate="true"><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VqTQyzSKcfsLApECYJYjTG-320-80.jpg.webp 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VqTQyzSKcfsLApECYJYjTG-480-80.jpg.webp 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VqTQyzSKcfsLApECYJYjTG-650-80.jpg.webp 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VqTQyzSKcfsLApECYJYjTG-970-80.jpg.webp 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VqTQyzSKcfsLApECYJYjTG-1024-80.jpg.webp 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VqTQyzSKcfsLApECYJYjTG-1200-80.jpg.webp 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)" data-normal="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VqTQyzSKcfsLApECYJYjTG.jpg" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VqTQyzSKcfsLApECYJYjTG.jpg" data-pin-nopin="true" data-slice-image="true"><source type="image/jpeg" srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VqTQyzSKcfsLApECYJYjTG-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VqTQyzSKcfsLApECYJYjTG-480-80.jpg 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VqTQyzSKcfsLApECYJYjTG-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VqTQyzSKcfsLApECYJYjTG-970-80.jpg 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VqTQyzSKcfsLApECYJYjTG-1024-80.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VqTQyzSKcfsLApECYJYjTG-1200-80.jpg 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)" data-normal="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VqTQyzSKcfsLApECYJYjTG.jpg" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VqTQyzSKcfsLApECYJYjTG.jpg" data-pin-nopin="true" data-slice-image="true"><img src="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg" alt="RP2350 Hacking Challenge" sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)" loading="lazy" data-normal="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VqTQyzSKcfsLApECYJYjTG.jpg" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VqTQyzSKcfsLApECYJYjTG.jpg" data-pin-nopin="true" data-slice-image="true"></picture></div><figcaption><span itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Aedan Cullen )</span></figcaption></figure></div><p>With this hardware-modified setup, Cullen probed Pin 53 to "inject whatever voltages I want" and checked what happened. An unprotected RP2350 board was kept on hand for side-by-side comparisons. Once the hardware was set up he watched what normally occurs when a secured and a non-secured RP2350 started up – according to the probe readout on an oscilloscope.</p><p>16 groups of spikes were seen, corresponding with 16 initial OTP reads on startup. Cullen then tested injecting power glitches to Pin 53 at certain points in the boot process. Disappointingly, the debug remained locked down. Next, a Python script was used to sweep the position of a glitch power input through the entire 600-microsecond range of OTP reads during startup. The debug functionality was checked but never became available. So Cullen looked at the unlocked RP2350 board again, with debugging enabled, for clues.</p><p>Then, something interesting was observed, as the RISC-V cores showed up via the glitch on the unsecured RP2350. Cullen then used another script to check where the RISC-V debug access port shows up.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="content:encoded"><p>Imagine shrinking satellite technology that predicts the weather into a device that transmits vital information about the health of the person wearing it.</p>

<p>University of Waterloo engineers have achieved this&nbsp;technological feat to help people faced with&nbsp;chronic health problems such as diabetes monitor their glucose levels.</p>

<p>The Waterloo team’s breakthrough addresses the major challenge of creating non-invasive, continuous glucose monitoring, essential for those managing diabetes.</p>

<p>Currently, diabetics must frequently prick their fingers or rely on invasive wearable patches with micro-needles to track their blood-sugar levels. But the system designed by Dr. George Shaker, an adjunct associate professor at Waterloo’s Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, and his colleagues eliminates this need, thereby reducing pain, the risk of infection and improving people’s quality of life.</p>

<p><img alt="George Shaker picture" height="233" src="https://uwaterloo.ca/news/sites/ca.news/files/resize/styles/feature_small/public/george_shaker_23-06-13_0853_1-350x233.jpg?itok=mvnnwrr9" width="350">“We’ve developed radar technology that can now fit inside a smart watch and sense glucose levels more accurately than ever before,” Shaker said. “Just like you use glasses to improve your vision, our technology helps for better sensing of glucose levels.”</p>

<p>To explain how the new system works, Shaker points to weather satellites that use radar to monitor the Earth’s atmosphere and, for example, measure storm movements and other kinds of cloud cover.</p>

<p>“We’ve figured a way to miniaturize these radar systems on satellites and put them in a wearable device and use the same radar technology that looks at changes in the atmosphere to look at changes in the human body,” he said</p>

<p>The system’s key components are a radar chip, which sends and receives signals through the body, an engineered “meta-surface”, which helps focus these signals for better accuracy, and microcontrollers, which process the radar signals using artificial intelligence algorithms. The algorithms improve the accuracy and reliability of the readings by learning from the data over time.</p>

<p>The unique aspect of this system is the meta-surface which Shaker and his team have developed. It further improves the radar’s resolution and sensitivity, allowing for more accurate glucose readings.</p>

<p>“Unlike existing methods that require skin penetration our system is entirely non-invasive and can detect even small changes in glucose level,” Shaker said. “No other technology can provide this level of precision without direct contact with the bloodstream.”</p>

<p>More work remains to perfect their system. Although the engineers now power their device with a USB cable, they’re planning to optimize it for battery use to improve portability. Eventually, they hope it can be used to gather other health-related data, such as blood pressure.</p>

<p>The team is currently working with industry partners to introduce the technology to be installed in the next generation of wearables.</p>

<p>“We have a minimum viable product that’s already being used in clinical trials, and while there’s more work to be done, we’re much closer to a full marketable device,” Shaker said.</p>

<p>The research paper, “Radar near-field sensing using metasurface for biomedical applications” was recently featured in Nature’s <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44172-024-00194-4"><i>Communications Engineering</i></a>.</p>

<p>Plastic recycling is commonplace but imperfect. Part of the problem, says <a href="https://eng.ua.edu/eng-directory/dr-jason-e-bara/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Jason Bara</a>, is that current processes yield lower-quality plastics with reduced value and fewer end uses. In a circular plastic economy, any plastic could be broken down to its component parts and then reconstituted into new products with little or no waste.</p>



<p>The science is not there yet, but it may be one step closer.</p>

<div>
<p>Bara, a professor in the College of Engineering, leads a team at The University of Alabama working to improve <a href="https://news.ua.edu/2021/08/ua-researchers-part-of-national-effort-to-tackle-plastic-waste/">methods to recycle</a> the ubiquitous plastics we interact with daily.</p>



<p>Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is a common plastic that responds well to chemolysis, a chemical process that depolymerizes plastic for recycling. Much of the previous work on chemolysis and PET has focused on water, alcohols, and amines.&nbsp; Amines are a group of compounds derived from ammonia and are especially effective for PET depolymerization, but most products formed from the aminolysis of PET have limited uses, Bara said.</p>
</div>
</div>



<h2 id="h-let-s-see-what-happens"><strong>“Let’s See What Happens”</strong></h2>



<p>Nothing in the literature pointed to the effectiveness of imidazoles in this process. Imidazole, and its related compounds, are a group of organic molecules that are used in a wide range of applications and even appear within biologically important compounds.</p>



<p>“I’ve been working with imidazole for much of my career,” said Bara. “It’s pretty amazing how versatile it is.” Bara had been working for two years with using amines to break down plastics as part of a National Science Foundation grant geared toward reducing plastic waste. His appreciation for imidazole’s versatility made it a natural extension to see what happened when he tried using it for chemolysis.</p>



<p>“My student came back into the lab and said oh — the plastic is gone. It’s all gone.”</p>



<p>The University of Alabama has filed a patent application for the process, which offers several key advantages over other chemical recycling methods for PET. Among these is the lack of need of an additional solvent or catalyst because imidazole has a relatively low melting point. These are favorable qualities for developing a cost efficient and commercially viable process.</p>



<p>Breaking down PET via imidazolysis yields chemical intermediates that can be transformed to a range of other chemicals that are hard to get by traditional methods.</p>



<p>“Our imidazolysis process is unique in that it’s a flexible recycling technology, and you can get a wider range of final products from PET depolymerization when you do it our way,” Bara said.</p>



<h2 id="h-chasing-the-next-challenge"><strong>Chasing the Next Challenge</strong></h2>



<p>Bara says one of the more exciting things about the research is what lies ahead.</p>



<div><p>PET is among the easier plastics to recycle. For one thing, it is relatively clean because it is used in food containers and drink bottles, and it generally contains few additives. Based on their results so far, imidazolysis is also useful in depolymerizing polyurethanes, which are trickier to work with than PET.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://news.ua.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/AdobeStock_480960525-1024x683.jpeg" alt="Wooden box marked with a recycling symbol holding a variety of plastic bottles.

<p>“There is generally good awareness around the need to recycle plastics and other materials (paper, metal) that commonly go into our recycling bins,” he said. “But it’s harder to appreciate that polyurethanes can also be chemically recycled.”</p>



<p>Polyurethanes are generally encountered as foams that are full of air, do not melt and often are formulated with any number of inorganic additives. Think packing foams, seat cushions, memory foam mattresses and automobile seats.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2560" height="1439" src="https://news.ua.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/AdobeStock_294651475-edited-scaled.jpeg" alt="Yellow chunks of polyurethane foam, torn into irregular pieces.

<p>“While municipal recycling is limited to the most common thermoplastics, consumers likely don’t understand the magnitude of the polyurethane problem that needs to be addressed.”</p>



<p>Imidazolysis not only works to break down polyurethanes and allows for recovery of the molecular components (the polyols used to make polyurethanes can be especially valuable to recover), but the physical properties of imidazole also make it a better reagent for carrying out the reaction.</p>



<p>“While I think what we’ve already published on the successful imidazolysis of PET is very exciting,” Bara said, “The chemical recycling of polyurethanes is where imidazolysis may potentially have a much bigger impact.”</p>



<p>This work on recycling PET and PU via imidazolysis has been supported by active funding from NSF and includes contributions from researchers at Iowa State University.</p>

<p>First off, no, your ANT+ devices aren’t going to stop working. In fact, companies are not only supporting them going forward, but will continue to make ANT+ devices for some time to come. Instead, ANT+ (or more technically, Garmin), has announced a policy change that effectively and officially ceases the development of new ANT+ standards. Though practically speaking, that mostly happened long ago.</p>
<p>The core reason for this change is the <a href="https://single-market-economy.ec.europa.eu/sectors/electrical-and-electronic-engineering-industries-eei/radio-equipment-directive-red_en">European Union’s Radio Equipment Directive</a> (simply called EU RED), which will ultimately take full effect next summer (it’s currently in a transitional phase). That directive covers a flotilla of different areas, but one of the most applicable pieces is that it requires authentication and encryption for wireless communications of personal information. Or, at the very least, it requires manufacturers to make you aware when data is being transmitted without such protections.</p>
<p>While ANT+ has long offered the ability to authenticate and encrypt data streams, it hasn’t been implemented in common profiles like heart rate or cycling power. Garmin says that to do so going forward would effectively break backward compatibility, as it significantly increases the payload sent in any message. Given the landscape of devices and Bluetooth in 2025, there’s virtually no appetite from other manufacturers to re-create the wheel when it comes to ANT+.</p>
<p>As a result, Garmin is making a bunch of changes around the certification side, development, and program side. None of these ANT+ changes will impact consumers in any way, anytime soon. However, there are some other Garmin changes that will soon start to impact consumers.</p>
<p>Let’s dive into it – but first, it’s important to understand a tiny bit of backstory here, to see the long term challenges that lie ahead.</p>
<h3 data-test="1/5" id="a-bit-of-backstory"><span><strong>A Bit of Backstory:</strong></span></h3>
<p>Regardless of how you feel about ANT+ (or Garmin’s ownership of it), it has remained as the most stable thing in the sports tech universe for almost two decades. I say ‘stable’, because it forced companies to align to a standard, which made communications and interoperability seamless for devices like heart rate sensors and cycling power meters. There’s no question that cycling power meters wouldn’t have taken off if we were still back in the days of proprietary SRM wireless, or wired PowerTap SL hubs. And certainly, as the Bluetooth power meter profile has (and continues to) demonstrate – it’s far from a reliable standard. In a review set for tomorrow, I’ll show how a popular watch doesn’t seem to implement this decade-old Bluetooth power meter standard correctly.</p>
<p>Of course, Bluetooth Low Energy (the direct competitor to ANT+, versus full-blown Bluetooth used for audio that’s a different beast), quickly gained popularity in the early 2010’s after the consortium announced standards around fitness devices, notably the heart rate strap first. While <a href="https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2013/10/samsung-mobile-devices.html">companies like Samsung</a> and <a href="https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2011/09/hands-on-review-of-sony-ericsson-xperia.html">Sony had adopted ANT+</a> in their phones, it was Apple’s decision to skip it that ultimately doomed ANT+. In fact, to this day, the mere mention of ANT+ in front of Apple employees in the know, is akin to smearing poop on the bathroom stall (seriously). It should be noted, for funsies, that Fitbit actually used to use ANT+ for communications between their early devices and the initial wireless adapter for your computer.</p>
<p>It’d be remiss to write an article about ANT+, without mentioning Dynastream (based in Cochrane, Alberta). That’s the original company behind ANT+, <a href="https://sgbonline.com/garmin-to-acquire-dynastream-in-36-million-deal/">that Garmin acquired in 2006</a>. The founder of Dynastream would eventually go on to found 4iiii in 2010, maker of power meters and many other products over the last 15 years. Still, despite Garmin’s ownership of ANT+, it was never really a meaningful problem for competitors. The (significant) value in having a common interoperability standard far outweighed the very small licensing fee these companies paid to Dynastream/Garmin. Consumers saw that value, and gravitated towards products that had standards in place.</p>

<p>A key part of any device communication on either ANT+ or Bluetooth smart are so-called sport/sensor/device profiles.</p>
<p>Think of a sensor/device profile as a way to define how certain types of devices communicate. For example, there’s a heart rate device profile for heart rate sensors. Or the cycling power meter one, and so on. Companies that have a stake in these profiles come together to try and create a single cohesive standard. For ANT+, <a href="https://www.thisisant.com/company/activity-icons/">there are dozens of these profiles</a>. Some companies like SRAM did an exceptional job of each new product they launched, they created an open profile for it (such as Dropper Post or ANT+ shifting). And Garmin largely did the same as well for each new product.</p>
<p>In the case of ANT+, this process was highly regulated, and sometimes (ok, most times) a wee bit slow. But if a company had a vision for the profile and a specific product launch timeframe/date, it was generally pretty efficient. It became less efficient the more companies got involved, or if the company didn’t have a specific product launch date. Said differently: If you danced your own dance with purpose, you could get a standard profile pretty darn quickly. If you involved a massive committee of competitors or were wishy-washy on dates, it dragged on for years. One only needs to see the much-requested Aero sensor profile as an example of that. And there are many more.</p>
<p>However, the Bluetooth SIG side had its own issues. These profiles were coming hot and heavy, but often driven by players that frankly didn’t have any business being part of that profile. We’d see automotive companies involved in the cycling power meter profile, for example. Thus, that profile still suffers plenty of problems to this day as it doesn’t really capture everything that power meters did 10 years ago, let alone today.</p>
<p>Still, by the mid-late 2010’s, most of the core sports profiles used were available in Bluetooth, including Bluetooth footpods, Bluetooth power meters, Bluetooth heart rate sensors, Bluetooth Speed &amp; Cadence sensors, and Bluetooth FTMS (for smart trainer control). Likewise, by that time, most of the chipsets used were dual ANT+/Bluetooth Smart. Almost every sensor made since 2016ish has been dual ANT+/Bluetooth Smart, albeit, it wasn’t until a few years later when multi-channel Bluetooth chipsets became commonplace, ensuring users could connect to their heart rate strap from more than one device at once (a problem primarily in the indoor training space).</p>
<p>As a result, Bluetooth finally became not only viable for sports use, but just as reliable in most scenarios. And in some cases, it handled wireless interference better than ANT+ did.</p>

<p>As I mentioned earlier on, the single biggest dagger to ANT+ is the EU RED, and the need to encrypt data. All of this would require a massive overhaul of ANT+, breaking backward compatibility with tens (if not hundreds) of millions of devices. Setting aside whether or not consumers actually want their live heart rate data at the gym encrypted, that’s where we find ourselves. As a result, Garmin has <a href="https://www.thisisant.com/business/go-ant/ant-brand/">announced the following changes</a>:</p>
<p><strong>– They are discontinuing membership programs/fees:</strong> Up until now, there were different membership tiers of ANT+ that companies/startups could join. These had fees, though relatively minor. Still, Garmin says it wouldn’t be right to charge companies for a membership that doesn’t have long-term viability in it.<br>
<strong>– They are discontinuing certification programs:</strong> Companies could submit products to be certified as compliant with standards. Some companies like Wahoo took this quite seriously, and sent everything. As of March 31st, ANT+ will stop accepting certification submissions. And as of June 30th, they’ll stop certifying new products.<br>
<strong>– They are ceasing development of new ANT+ Profiles:</strong> No surprise here, there’s no new development/expansion of ANT+ profiles.<br>
<strong>– They are however continuing to ensure ANT+ is available on silicon:</strong> This ensures that ANT+ is still available on chipset providers for a long time to come. As one might expect, there are millions of devices, both from a sensor and display (e.g., watch/bike computer) standpoint, that still want to use ANT+ connections. Garmin says they’re working to ensure these chipset providers continue to make dual ANT+/Bluetooth chipsets.<br>
<strong>– All documentation to be made fully available online:</strong> Certain tier ANT+ members could access more detailed documentation than lower tiers. This basically makes all ANT+ documents available to everyone.</p>
<p>All of this basically means that your ANT+ devices will continue to work just fine, and we’ll actually probably continue to see ANT+ devices made by companies like Garmin/Wahoo/etc for quite some time as well. That’s because there are workarounds to the EU RED requirements, such as notifying the user. Or, simply assuming that portions of the EU RED will get delayed yet again.</p>
<p>In fact, we’re already seeing Garmin introduce some mitigations. In recent Garmin watch/bike computer beta firmware versions, you’ll see a new connection option type shown:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" title="IMG_2431.jpeg" src="https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/IMG_2431.jpeg" alt="" width="355" height="266" srcset="https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/IMG_2431.jpeg 710w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/IMG_2431-200x150.jpeg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 355px) 100vw, 355px"> <img loading="lazy" title="IMG_2432.jpeg" src="https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/IMG_2432.jpeg" alt="" width="355" height="266" srcset="https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/IMG_2432.jpeg 710w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/IMG_2432-200x150.jpeg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 355px) 100vw, 355px"></p>
<p>More on related things later/soonish.</p>
<p>As for the reduction of ANT+ positions within Garmin, the company noted that they “have a shortage of people, not ideas”. Everyone in the Cochrane office is simply being reassigned to other work areas. Garmin has largely leveraged the Cochrane office in recent years for projects related to sensors and other communication technologies (e.g., heart rate sensors, power meters, etc…).</p>
<h3 data-test="4/5" id="a-lot-of-gaps"><span><strong>A Lot of Gaps:</strong></span></h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" title="Radar.jpg" src="https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Radar.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="480" srcset="https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Radar.jpg 720w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Radar-200x133.jpg 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/Radar-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px"></p>
<p>Now going back to that initial excitement period in the 2010’s, standards-based profiles largely halted. Most companies, including Garmin, saw the Bluetooth SIG as a hopeless entity more concerned with putting in place roadblocks than progress. We saw companies like Polar and Wahoo – who used to have significant presence on the Bluetooth SIGs (committee groups), significantly reduce involvement. As a result, there’s been no new sports/fitness profiles in nearly a decade.</p>
<p>Thus, while it’s easy for many consumers to dismiss ANT+ as irrelevant, it’s very much still a part of certain scenes – the biggest being cycling. Things get really messy, really quick.</p>
<p><strong>Got a cycling radar (like a Varia Radar device)?</strong> Yup, that’s almost exclusively on ANT+. The only Bluetooth implementations are private/proprietary implementations that are unique to each company. Even radars from Bryton, Magene, and others all use ANT+ as the primary protocol.</p>
<p><strong>Got wireless shifting or Di2?</strong> Those too are on ANT. In the case of SRAM/Campagnolo/FSA, that’s broadcasting your gear and battery status on the ANT+ shifting protocol. In the case of Shimano, that’s using their proprietary ANT (but not ANT+) protocol. Of course, <a href="https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2022/05/shimano-hammerhead-functionality.html">that’s resulted in all sorts of messiness</a>. But there is absolutely *zero* Bluetooth alternative for any of these companies right now.</p>
<p><strong>How about cycling lights?</strong> If you want those cycling lights connected to your Wahoo/Garmin/Hammerhead/COROS/whatever bike computer, that’s using ANT+. Sure, there are, again, proprietary Bluetooth implementations out there. But they only work within that specific company’s ecosystem (thinking of Lezyne as an example).</p>
<p>Sure, for heart rate data the standard is well understood on Bluetooth. It simply doesn’t matter whether or not you have an ANT+ or Bluetooth Smart heart rate strap, they both work perfectly fine. There are minor pros and cons to each, but for 99.9% of consumers, it just doesn’t matter.</p>
<p>So what happens to mitigate these gaps?</p>
<h3 data-test="5/5" id="what-happens-next-for-consumers"><span><strong>What Happens Next for Consumers:</strong></span></h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" title="ANTSymp.jpg" src="https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/ANTSymp.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="480" srcset="https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/ANTSymp.jpg 720w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/ANTSymp-200x133.jpg 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2025/01/ANTSymp-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px"></p>
<p>The answer to this section headline is simple: Back to walled gardens.</p>
<p>Of course, that was already mostly the trend the last 4-5 years. Unfortunately, the COVID era further cemented that by eliminating various interoperability conferences/events that had occurred prior. Adding to that is the heavy shift towards startup tech companies that have largely eschewed standards as well, be it protocol or file format.</p>
<p>While one might assume Bluetooth SIGs would be the answer going forward, history and current company commentary have very clearly indicated otherwise. I’ve yet to find a single sports tech company that wants to deal with pushing forward new device profiles with the Bluetooth SIG. Companies don’t see that as a viable route to success, and certainly not worth their time and headaches.</p>
<p>Instead, companies like Garmin say they’re going to work to make private profiles more available. I asked Garmin, for example, about the radar profile, for which Garmin has had a private Bluetooth implementation available for years now. They give that to some companies upon request, to implement within their apps. They didn’t have (yet) a specific firm answer for how that’ll look going forward, but instead pointed to Wahoo’s early release a decade ago of their trainer control protocols as an example of the likely direction.</p>
<p>For those that don’t remember the early 2010 protocol days of Wahoo smart trainers, they basically created their own trainer control standard, and then published the API/SDK on a website for all to use. That quickly made Wahoo’s KICKR trainer protocol the de facto standard for a period before the <a href="https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2016/07/everything-wanted-trainers.html">ANT+ FE-C standard came into play</a>.</p>
<p>Garmin has plenty of history of doing variants of that, both within the ANT+ sphere, but also their Connect IQ developer programs. But whether they actually do so is a different matter. In the trainer space, Garmin/Wahoo/Elite/Zwift all kinda quietly work together on various protocol things, but they don’t often reach the finish line in a public way.</p>
<p>The sports tech industry needs some replacement for what the <a href="https://www.dcrainmaker.com/tag/ant-symposium">ANT+ Symposium</a> did for over a decade, both in terms of an event to talk protocols (with competitors no less), but also the backend process to keep companies aligned to standards for the other 51 weeks of the year. Unfortunately, I don’t see how that happens going forward.</p>
<p>Until then, the good news is our ANT+ devices will continue to keep working.</p>
<p>With that, thanks for reading!</p>

I made a mistake, but … I’ve changed my life.’”</p><p>It was long considered taboo in media to retract or alter old stories, particularly when there are no concerns about accuracy. But Quinn said he felt an ethical obligation to rethink those norms. “I couldn’t take it any more … I just got tired of telling people no and standing on tradition instead of being thoughtful.”</p><p>He recalled an early case of a <a href="https://www.cleveland.com/opinion/2018/07/right_to_be_forgotten_clevelan.html" data-link-name="in body link">drunken teenager</a> who broke part of a monument in a cemetery and was charged. Years later, he had “completely atoned” and was starting to apply for jobs, Quinn said. “He did something stupid as a kid … and he said: ‘I can’t move on.’” The editor granted his request, removed his name and presented it to his colleagues as a model for similar cases.</p><p>There was some initial internal resistance, but eventually Quinn and his staff came up with general parameters: they would not erase names in cases of violence, sex offenses, crimes against children or corruption. Police officers would be treated as public officials, so stories of their wrongdoing would remain. The incident typically had to be at least four years old, although the paper has made exceptions. Quinn did not want to have strict rules, since every case is different. The guiding question, he said, was: “What’s more valuable – this story remaining available to the public, or this person being able to move on?”</p><p>The concept has since <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2021/02/boston-globe-fresh-start-right-to-be-forgotten-newspapers.html" data-link-name="in body link">spread</a> to the <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2021/01/22/metro/globes-fresh-start-initiative-frequently-asked-questions/" data-link-name="in body link">Boston Globe</a>, the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/media/old-arrest-boston-globe-fresh-start/2021/01/22/122cbd0c-5cd1-11eb-b8bd-ee36b1cd18bf_story.html" data-link-name="in body link">Atlanta Journal-Constitution</a>, the <a href="https://www.bangordailynews.com/forgetme/" data-link-name="in body link">Bangor Daily News</a> in Maine, the <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/opinion/2024/11/letter-from-the-editor-heartfelt-request-for-clean-slate-underscores-why-we-offer-program.html" data-link-name="in body link">Oregonian</a> and New Jersey’s <a href="http://nj.com/" data-link-name="in body link">NJ.com</a>. The efforts gained momentum after racial justice protests in 2020 prompted newsroom reflections across the US about the media’s legacy of biased and harmful coverage, including its <a href="https://nbcuacademy.com/claire-wang-mugshots-crime-beat-police/" data-link-name="in body link">widespread use of mugshots</a>.</p><p>Quinn dramatically scaled up his work after receiving Google funding allowing his newsroom to develop a tool for proactively identifying stories potentially worthy of deletion. The work was painstaking, but allowed for <a href="https://www.cleveland.com/news/2022/02/weve-helped-thousands-of-people-get-past-their-mistakes-with-googles-support-letter-from-the-editor.html" data-link-name="in body link">thousands of removals</a>, making the program more equitable, instead of only benefiting readers aware of its initiative.</p><p>The Portland-based Oregonian once had community reporters in bureaus in surrounding suburbs who would cover hyperlocal news, including very trivial offenses, said Therese Bottomly, the paper’s editor. “Is that something that should really haunt somebody for years and years?” she questioned. Recognizing these were minor offenses the paper no longer covered, she formally launched a <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/opinion/2021/03/letter-from-the-editor-well-be-taking-a-new-look-at-old-crime-news.html" data-link-name="in body link">clean slate program</a> in 2021, establishing an internal committee to review requests.</p><p>The Oregonian offers several options. It can remove a mugshot – a logical step after Oregon changed the law to limit the release of booking photos, with lawmakers recognizing their <a href="https://www.opb.org/article/2021/11/02/oregon-mugshot-law-booking-photos-released/" data-link-name="in body link">severe harm</a>. The paper can also remove a subject’s name, delete the story entirely, or ask Google to deindex the article, meaning it would still exist on OregonLive.com, but wouldn’t easily surface in a web search. The committee factchecks claims of requesters, ensuring they have completed court requirements and stayed clean.</p><figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement"><a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-15">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id="EmailSignup-skip-link-15" tabindex="0" aria-label="after newsletter promotion" role="note">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><p>Each case is carefully considered. An educator who had an expunged misdemeanor harassment case <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/opinion/2021/03/letter-from-the-editor-well-be-taking-a-new-look-at-old-crime-news.html" data-link-name="in body link">requested removal</a>, but the Oregonian decided to maintain its article because additional reporting suggested he had dodged sexual misconduct allegations for years. The committee has <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/opinion/2023/12/letter-from-the-editor-an-update-on-our-clean-slate-program.html" data-link-name="in body link">removed articles</a> about a man jailed for car thefts and a woman caught with illegal drugs.</p><p>In November, Bottomly published excerpts from one subject’s heartfelt plea for the removal of an article about a non-violent conviction when he had “hit rock bottom” in the throes of addiction. He spoke of his long journey of rehabilitation and the family he was now raising.</p><p>“I can now take pride in saying my life is unrecognizable from the one written about in the OregonLive article,” he <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/opinion/2024/11/letter-from-the-editor-heartfelt-request-for-clean-slate-underscores-why-we-offer-program.html" data-link-name="in body link">wrote</a>. “I live in fear that a single Google search of my name will ruin what I have worked so hard to build.” His nearly 10-year-old story was removed. In total, the Oregonian has approved 56 requests, partially approved 11 (including deindexing but not removing) and denied 29 cases, Bottomly said.</p><p>Bottomly noted that the vast majority of people in state prison will eventually be released. “These folks are going to be our neighbors, our co-workers and hopefully contributing members of society someday. So should we figure out ways to at least not be an unnecessary barrier to re-entry for something truly minor and in the past, and for which somebody has paid their debt?”</p><p>Editors say the programs have inspired newsrooms to be more deliberate in their current coverage, leaving names out when not relevant and thinking through the consequences of photos in crime stories.</p><p>Saun Hough, director of partnerships for Californians for Safety and Justice, an advocacy group that has fought for <a href="https://calmatters.org/justice/2024/03/california-criminal-records-expungement-law/" data-link-name="in body link">mass expungements</a>, said reporters often capture a one-sided, law enforcement narrative about an arrest, then fail to follow up. Someone jailed for drug trafficking may ultimately be convicted of possession, or a woman arrested for prostitution could later be confirmed a sex-trafficking survivor, he said. It can take years for cases to be adjudicated, but a report based on an initial arrest might be the story that follows someone through life.</p><p>“It creates this constant sense of anxiety that many people live with,” said Hough, noting that crime stories generally lack context about a person’s traumas or struggles that led to the incident. “People wake up every day and pray that they don’t have to talk about what the newspaper wrote about their arrest and relive that. You have this thought in your mind that you’re one Google [search] away from everything being ripped away.”</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="2.0">John Williams kept a backpack filled with everything he’d need to go on the run: three pairs of socks; a few hundred dollars cash; makeshift disguises and lock-picking gear; medical supplies, vitamins and high-calorie energy gels; and thumb drives that each held more than 100 gigabytes of encrypted documents, which he would quickly distribute if he were about to be arrested or killed.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.0">On April 1, 2023, Williams retrieved the bag from his closet and rushed to his car. He had no time to clean the dishes that had accumulated in his apartment. He did not know if armed men were out looking for him. He did not know if he would ever feel safe to return. He parked his car for the night in the foothills overlooking Salt Lake City and curled up his 6-foot-4-inch frame in the back seat of the 20-year-old Honda. This was his new home.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.0">He turned on a recording app to add an entry to his diary. His voice had the high-pitched rasp of a lifelong smoker: “Where to fucking start,” he sighed, taking a deep breath. After more than two years undercover, he’d been growing rash and impulsive. He had feared someone was in danger and tried to warn him, but it backfired. Williams was sure at least one person knew he was a double agent now, he said into his phone. “It’s only a matter of time before it gets back to the rest.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.0">In the daylight, Williams dropped an envelope with no return address in a U.S. Postal Service mailbox. He’d loaded it with a flash drive and a gold Oath Keepers medallion. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.1">It was addressed to me.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.0">The documents laid out a remarkable odyssey. Posing as an ideological compatriot, Williams had penetrated the top ranks of two of the most prominent right-wing militias in the country. He’d slept in the home of the man who claims to be the new head of the Oath Keepers, rifling through his files in the middle of the night. He’d devised elaborate ruses to gather evidence of militias’ ties to high-ranking law enforcement officials. He’d uncovered secret operations like the surveillance of a young journalist, then improvised ways to sabotage the militants’ schemes. In one group, his ploys were so successful that he became the militia’s top commander in the state of Utah.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.0">Now he was a fugitive. He drove south toward a desert four hours from the city, where he could disappear.</p>

<h3><p>1. Prelude</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="11.0">I’d first heard from Williams five months earlier, when he sent me an intriguing but mysterious anonymous email. “I have been attempting to contact national media and civil rights groups for over a year and been ignored,” it read. “I’m tired of yelling into the void.” He sent it to an array of reporters. I was the only one to respond. I’ve burned a lot of time sating my curiosity about emails like that. I expected my interest to die after a quick call. Instead, I came to occupy a dizzying position as the only person to know the secret Williams had been harboring for almost two years.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="12.0">We spoke a handful of times over encrypted calls before he fled. He’d been galvanized by the Jan. 6, 2021, storming of the Capitol, Williams told me, when militias like the Oath Keepers conspired to violently overturn the 2020 presidential election. He believed democracy was under siege from groups the FBI has said pose a major domestic terrorism threat. So he infiltrated the militia movement on spec, as a freelance vigilante. He did not tell the police or the FBI. A loner, he did not tell his family or friends.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="13.0">Williams seemed consumed with how to ensure this wasn’t all a self-destructive, highly dangerous waste of time. He distrusted law enforcement and didn’t want to be an informant, he said. He told me he hoped to damage the movement by someday going public with what he’d learned.</p>

    <p>We’re trying something new. <a href="https://iteratehq.com/propublica/670eabefffb484af7dc7db86">Was it helpful?</a></p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="15.0">The Capitol riot had been nagging at me too. I’d <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/new-details-suggest-senior-trump-aides-knew-jan-6-rally-could-get-chaotic">reported extensively on Jan. 6</a>. I’d sat with families who blamed militias for snatching their loved ones away from them, pulling them into a life of secret meetings and violent plots — or into a jail cell. By the time Williams contacted me, though, the most infamous groups appeared to have largely gone dark. Were militias more enduring, more potent, than it seemed?</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="16.0">Some of what he told me seemed significant. Still, before the package arrived, it could feel like I was corresponding with a shadow. I knew Williams treated deception as an art form. “When you spin a lie,” he once told me, “you have to have things they can verify so they won’t think to ask questions.” While his stories generally seemed precise and sober — always reassuring for a journalist — I needed to proceed with extreme skepticism.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="17.0">So I pored over his files, tens of thousands of them. They included dozens of hours of conversations he secretly recorded and years of private militia chat logs and videos. I was able to authenticate those through other sources, in and out of the movement. I also talked to dozens of people, from Williams’ friends to other members of his militias. I dug into his tumultuous past and discovered records online he hadn’t pointed me to that supported his account.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="18.0">The files give a unique window, at once expansive and intimate, into one of the <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/inside-secret-ap3-militia-american-patriots-three-percent">most consequential and volatile social movements of our time</a>. Williams penetrated a new generation of paramilitary leaders, which included doctors, career cops and government attorneys. Sometimes they were frightening, sometimes bumbling, always heavily armed. It was a world where a man would propose assassinating politicians, only to spark a debate about logistics.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="19.0">Federal prosecutors have convicted more than 1,000 people for their role in Jan. 6. Key militia captains were sent to prison for a decade or more. But that did not quash the allure that militias hold for a broad swath of Americans.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="20.0">Now President-elect Donald Trump has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/31/us/politics/trump-jan-6-pardons-nabj.html">promised to pardon Jan. 6 rioters</a> when he returns to the White House. Experts warn that such a move could trigger a renaissance for militant extremists, sending them an unprecedented message of protection and support — and making it all the more urgent to understand them.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="22.0">Williams is part of a <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2024/08/26/infiltrating-the-far-right">larger cold war</a>, radical vs. radical, that’s stayed mostly in the shadows. A left-wing activist told me he personally knows about 30 people who’ve gone undercover in militias or white supremacist groups. They did not coordinate with law enforcement, instead taking the surveillance of one of the most intractable features of American politics into their own hands.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="23.0">Skeptical of authorities, militias have sought to reshape the country through armed action. Williams sought to do it through betrayals and lies, which sat with him uneasily. “I couldn’t have been as successful at this if I wasn’t one of them in some respects,” he once told me. “I couldn’t have done it so long unless they recognized something in me.”</p>

<h3><p>2. The Struggle</p>
</h3>

        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="25.0">If there is one moment that set Williams on his path into the militia underground, it came roughly a decade before Jan. 6, when he was sent to a medium-security prison. He was in his early 30s, drawn to danger and filled with an inner turbulence.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="26.0">Williams grew up in what he described to me, to friends and in court records as a dysfunctional and unhappy home. He was a gay child in rural America. His father viewed homosexuality as a mortal sin, he said. Williams spent much of his childhood outdoors, bird-watching, camping and trying to spend as little time as possible at home. (John Williams is now his legal name, one he recently acquired.)</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="27.0">Once he was old enough to move out, Williams continued to go off the grid for weeks at a time. Living in a cave interested him; the jobs he’d found at grocery stores and sandwich shops did not. He told me his young adulthood was “a blank space in my life,” a stretch of “petty crime” and falling-outs with old friends. He pled guilty to a series of misdemeanors: trespassing, criminal mischief, assault.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="28.0">What landed Williams in prison was how he responded to one of those arrests. He sent disturbing, anonymous emails to investigators on the case, threatening their families. Police traced the messages back to him and put him away for three years.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="29.0">Williams found time to read widely in prison — natural history books, Bertrand Russell, Cormac McCarthy. And it served as a finishing school for a skill that would be crucial in his undercover years. Surviving prison meant learning to maneuver around gang leaders and corrections officers. He learned how to steer conversations to his own benefit without the other person noticing.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="30.0">When he got out, he had a clear ambition: to become a wilderness survival instructor. He used Facebook to advertise guided hikes in Utah’s Uinta Mountains. An old photo captures Williams looking like a lanky camp counselor as he shows students an edible plant. He sports a thick ponytail and cargo pants, painted toenails poking out from his hiking sandals.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="31.0">Many people in Utah had turned to wilderness survival after a personal crisis, forming a community of misfits who thrived in environments harsh and remote. Even among them, Williams earned a reputation for putting himself in extreme situations. “Not many people are willing to struggle on their own. He takes that struggle to a high degree,” one friend told me admiringly. Williams took up krav maga and muay thai because he enjoyed fistfights. He once spent 40 days alone in the desert with only a knife, living off chipmunks and currants (by choice, to celebrate a birthday).</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="32.0">Williams struggled to get his survival business going. He’d hand out business cards at hobbyist gatherings with promises of adventure, but in practice, he was mostly leading seminars in city parks for beer money. He would only take calls in emergencies, another friend recalled, because he wanted to save money on minutes.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="33.0">Then around New Year’s in 2019, according to Williams, he received an email from a leader in American Patriots Three Percent, or AP3. He wanted to hire Williams for a training session. He could pay $1,000.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="34.0"><em>Finally</em>, Williams thought. <em>I’m starting to get some traction.</em></p>

<hr>
<h3><p>3. The Decision</p>
</h3>

        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="35.0">They had agreed there’d be no semiautomatic rifles, Williams told me, so everyone brought a sidearm. Some dozen militiamen had driven into the mountains near Peter Sinks, Utah, one of the coldest places in the contiguous U.S. Initially they wanted training in evasion and escape, Williams said, but he thought they needed to work up to that. So for three days, he taught them the basics of wilderness survival, but with a twist: how to stay alive while “trying to stay hidden.” He showed them how to build a shelter that would both keep them dry and escape detection. How to make a fire, then how to clean it up so no one could tell it was ever there.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="36.0">As the days wore on, stray comments started to irk him. Once, a man said he’d been “kiked” into overpaying for his Ruger handgun. At the end of the training, AP3 leaders handed out matching patches. The ritual reminded Williams of a biker gang.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="37.0">He’d already been to some shorter AP3 events to meet the men and tailor the lesson to his first meaningful client, Williams told me. But spending days in the woods with them felt different. He said he found the experience unpleasant and decided not to work with the group again.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="40.0">This portion of Williams’ story — exactly how and why he first became a militia member — is the hardest to verify. By his own account, he kept his thoughts and plans entirely to himself. At the time, he was too embarrassed to even tell his friends what happened that weekend, he said. In the survival community, training militias was considered taboo.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="41.0">I couldn’t help but wonder if Williams was hiding a less gallant backstory. Maybe he’d joined AP3 out of genuine enthusiasm and then soured on it. Maybe now he was trying to fool me. Indeed, when I called the AP3 leader who set up the training, he disputed Williams’ timeline. He remembered Williams staying sporadically but consistently involved after the session in the mountains, as a friend of the group who attended two or three events a year. To further muddy the picture, Williams had warned me the man would say something like that — Williams had worked hard to create the impression that he never left, he said, that he’d just gone inactive for a while, busy with work. (Remarkably, the AP3er defended Williams’ loyalty each time I asserted he’d secretly tried to undermine the group. “He was very well-respected,” he said. “I never questioned his honesty or his intentions.”)</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="42.0">Even Williams’ friends told me he was something of a mystery to them. But I found evidence that supports his story where so many loners bare their innermost thoughts: the internet. In 2019 and early 2020, Williams wrote thousands of since-deleted entries in online forums. These posts delivered a snapshot of his worldview in this period: idiosyncratic, erudite and angry with little room for moderation. “There are occasionally militia types that want these skills to further violent fringe agendas and I will absolutely not enable them,” he wrote in one 2020 entry about wilderness survival. In another, he called AP3 and its allies “far right lunatics.” The posts didn’t prove the details of his account, but here was the Williams I knew, writing under pseudonyms long before we’d met.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="43.0">One day, he’d voice his disdain for Trump voters, neoliberalism or “the capitalist infrastructure.” Another, he’d rail against gun control measures as immoral. When Black Lives Matter protests broke out in 2020, Williams wrote that he was gathering medical supplies for local protestors. He sounded at times like a revolutionary crossed with a left-wing liberal arts student. “The sole job of a cop is to bully citizens on behalf of the state,” he wrote. “Violent overthrow of the state is our only viable option.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="44.0">Then came Jan. 6. As he was watching on TV, he later told me, Williams thought he recognized the patch on a rioter’s tactical vest. It looked like the one that AP3 leaders had handed out at the end of his training.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="45.0"><em>Did I teach that guy?</em> he wondered. <em>Why was I so cordial to them all?</em> <em>If they knew I was gay, I bet they’d want me dead, and I actually helped them</em>. <em>Because I was too selfish to think of anything but my career</em>.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="46.0">Shame quickly turned to anger, he told me, and to a desire for revenge. Pundits were saying that democracy itself was in mortal peril. Williams took that notion literally. He assumed countless Americans would respond with aggressive action, he said, and he wanted to be among them.</p>
        
    
                    
<hr>
<h3><p>4. A New World</p>
</h3>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="47.1">Williams stood alone in his apartment, watching himself in the mirror.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="47.2">“I’m tall.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="47.3">“I’m Dave.” </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="47.4">“I’m tall.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="47.5">“I’m Dave.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="47.6">He tried to focus on his mannerisms, on the intonation of his voice. Whether he was saying the truth or a falsehood, he wanted to appear exactly the same.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="48.0">Months had passed since the Capitol riot. By all appearances, Williams was now an enthusiastic member of AP3. Because he already had an in, joining the group was easy, he said. Becoming a self-fashioned spy took some trial and error, however. In the early days, he had posed as a homeless person to surveil militia training facilities, but he decided that was a waste of time.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="49.0">The casual deceit that had served him in prison was proving useful. Deviousness was a skill, and he stayed up late working to hone it. He kept a journal with every lie he told so he wouldn’t lose track. His syllabus centered on acting exercises and the history of espionage and cults. People like sex cult leader Keith Raniere impressed him most — he studied biographies to learn how they manipulated people, how they used cruelty to wear their followers down into acquiescence.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="50.0">Williams regularly berated the militia’s rank and file. He doled out condescending advice about the group’s security weaknesses, warning their technical incompetence would make them easy targets for left-wing hackers and government snoops. Orion Rollins, the militia’s top leader in Utah, soon messaged Williams to thank him for the guidance. “Don’t worry about being a dick,” he wrote. “It’s time to learn and become as untraceable as possible.” (The AP3 messages Williams sent me were so voluminous that I spent an entire month reading them before I noticed this exchange.)</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="51.0">Williams was entering the militia at a pivotal time. AP3 once had chapters in nearly every state, with a roster likely in the tens of thousands; as authorities cracked down on the movement after Jan. 6, membership was plummeting. Some who stayed on had white nationalist ties. Others were just lonely conservatives who had found purpose in the paramilitary cause. For now, the group’s leaders were focused on saving the militia, not taking up arms to fight their enemies. (Thanks to Williams’ trove and records from several other sources, I was eventually able to write <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/inside-secret-ap3-militia-american-patriots-three-percent">an investigation into AP3’s resurgence</a>.)</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="52.0">On March 4, 2021, Williams complained to Rollins that everyone was still ignoring his advice. Williams volunteered to take over as the state’s “intel officer,” responsible for protecting the group from outside scrutiny.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="53.0">“My hands are tied,” Williams wrote. “If I’m not able to” take charge, the whole militia “might unravel.” Rollins gave him the promotion.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="54.0">“Thanks Orion. You’ve shown good initiative here.” Privately, he saw a special advantage to his appointment. If anyone suspected there was a mole in Utah, Williams would be the natural choice to lead the mole hunt.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="55.0">Now he had a leadership role. What he did not yet have was a plan. But how could he decide on goals, he figured, until he knew more about AP3? He would work to gather information and rise through the ranks by being the best militia member he could be.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="56.0">He took note of the job titles of leaders he met, like an Air Force reserve master sergeant (I confirmed this through military records) who recruited other airmen into the movement. Williams attended paramilitary trainings, where the group practiced ambushes with improvised explosives and semiautomatic guns. He offered his comrades free lessons in hand-to-hand combat and bonded with them in the backcountry hunting jackrabbits. When the militia joined right-wing rallies for causes like gun rights, they went in tactical gear. Williams attended as their “gray man,” he said — assigned to blend in with the crowd and call in armed reinforcements if tensions erupted.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="57.0">Since his work was seasonal, Williams could spend as much as 40 hours a week on militia activities. One of his duties as intel officer was to monitor the group’s enemies on the left, which could induce vertigo. A militia leader once dispatched him to a Democratic Socialists of America meeting at a local library, he said, where he saw a Proud Boy he recognized from a joint militia training. Was this a closet right-winger keeping tabs on the socialists? Or a closet leftist who might dox him or inform the police?</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="58.0">He first contacted me in October 2022. He couldn’t see how the movement was changing beyond his corner of Utah. AP3 was reinvigorated by then, I later found, with as many as 50 recruits applying each day. In private chats I reviewed, leaders were debating if they should commit acts of terrorism. At the Texas border, members were rounding up immigrants in armed patrols. But Williams didn’t know all that yet. On our first call, he launched into a litany of minutiae: names, logistical details, allegations of minor players committing petty crimes.

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="59.0">Williams feared that if anything he’d helped AP3, not damaged it. Then, in early November, Rollins told him to contact a retired detective named Bobby Kinch.</p>

<h3><p>5. The Detective and the Sheriff</p>
</h3>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="63.1">Williams turned on a recording device and dialed. Kinch picked up after one ring: ​​“What’s going on?” he bellowed. “How you doing, man?” </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="63.2">“I don’t know if you remember me,” Kinch continued, but they’d met years before.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="63.3">“Oh, oh, back in the day,” Williams said, stuttering for a second. He knew Kinch was expecting the call but was confused by the warm reception. Maybe Kinch was at the training in 2019? </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="63.4">“Well I’m the sitting, current national director of the Oath Keepers now.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="64.0">The militia’s eye-patched founder, Stewart Rhodes, was in jail amid his trial for conspiring to overthrow the government on Jan. 6. Kinch said he was serving on the group’s national board when his predecessor was arrested. Rhodes had called from jail to say, “Do not worry about me. This is God’s way.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="65.0">“He goes, ‘But I want you to save the organization.’”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="66.0">Kinch explained that Rollins, who’d recently defected to the Oath Keepers, had been singing Williams’ praises. (Bound by shared ideology, militias are more porous than outsiders would think. Members often cycle between groups like square dance partners.) “I imagine your plate is full with all the crazy stuff going on in the world, but I’d love to sit down.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="67.0">“Yeah, yeah,” Williams said. “AP3 and Oath Keepers should definitely be working together.” He proposed forming a joint reconnaissance team so their two militias could collaborate on intelligence operations. Kinch lit up. “I’m a career cop,” he said. “I did a lot of covert stuff, surveillance.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="68.0">By the time they hung up 45 minutes later, Kinch had invited Williams to come stay at his home. Williams felt impressed with himself. The head of the most infamous militia in America was treating him like an old friend.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="69.0">To me, Williams sounded like a different person on the call, with the same voice but a brand new personality. It was the first recording that I listened to and the first time I became certain the most important part of his story was true. To authenticate the record, I independently confirmed nonpublic details Kinch discussed on the tape, a process I repeated again and again with the other files. Soon I had proof of what would otherwise seem outlandish: Williams’ access was just as deep as he claimed.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="70.0">I could see why people would be eager to follow Kinch. Even when he sermonized on the “global elitist cabal,” he spoke with the affable passion of a beloved high school teacher. I’d long been fascinated by the prevalence of cops on militia rosters, so I started examining his backstory.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="71.0">Kinch grew up in upstate New York, the son of a World War II veteran who had him at about 50. When Kinch was young, he confided in a later recording, he was a “wheelman,” slang for getaway driver. “I ran from the cops so many fucking times,” he said. But “at the end of the day, you know, I got away. I never got caught.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="72.0">He moved to Las Vegas and, at the age of 25, became an officer in the metro police. Kinch came to serve in elite detective units over 23 years in the force, hunting fugitives and helping take down gangs like the Playboy Bloods. Eventually he was assigned to what he called the “Black squad,” according to court records, tasked with investigating violent crimes where the suspect was African American. (A Las Vegas police spokesperson told me they stopped “dividing squads by a suspect’s race” a year before Kinch retired.)</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="73.0">Then around Christmas in 2013, Kinch’s career began to self-destruct. In a series of Facebook posts, he said that he would welcome a “race war.” “Bring it!” he wrote. “I’m about as fed up as a man (American, Christian, White, Heterosexual) can get!” An ensuing investigation prompted the department to tell the Secret Service that Kinch “could be a threat to the president,” according to the Las Vegas Sun. (The Secret Service interviewed him and determined he was not a threat to President Barack Obama, the outlet reported. Kinch told the paper he was not racist and that he was being targeted by colleagues with “an ax to grind.”) In 2016, he turned in his badge, a year after the saga broke in the local press.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="74.0">Kinch moved to southern Utah and found a job hawking hunting gear at a Sportsman’s Warehouse. But he “had this urge,” he later said on a right-wing podcast. “Like I wasn’t done yet.” So he joined the Oath Keepers. “When people tell me that violence doesn’t solve anything, I look back over my police career,” he once advised his followers. “And I’m like, ‘Wow, that’s interesting, because violence did solve quite a bit.’”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="75.0">Kinch added Williams to an encrypted Signal channel where the Utah Oath Keepers coordinated their intel work. Two weeks later on Nov. 30, 2022, Williams received a cryptic message from David Coates, one of Kinch’s top deputies.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="76.0">Coates was an elder statesman of sorts in the Oath Keepers, a 73-year-old Vietnam veteran with a Hulk Hogan mustache. There’d been a break-in at the Utah attorney general’s office, he reported to the group, and for some unspoken reason, the Oath Keepers seemed to think this was of direct relevance to them. Coates promised to find out more about the burglary: “The Sheriff should have some answers” to “my inquiries today or tomorrow.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="77.0">That last line would come to obsess Williams. He sent a long, made-up note about his own experiences collaborating with law enforcement officials. “I’m curious, how responsive is the Sheriff to your inquiries? Or do you have a source you work with?”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="78.0">“The Sheriff has become a personal friend who hosted my FBI interview,” Coates responded. “He opens a lot of doors.” Coates had been in D.C. on Jan. 6, he’d told Williams. It’d make sense if that had piqued the FBI’s interest.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="79.0">To Williams, it hinted at a more menacing scenario — at secret ties between those who threaten the rule of the law and those duty-bound to enforce it. He desperately wanted more details, more context, the sheriff’s name. But he didn’t want to push for too much too fast.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="82.0">A forest engulfed Kinch’s house on all sides. He lived in a half-million-dollar cabin in summer home country, up 8,000 feet in the mountains outside Zion National Park. Williams stood in the kitchen on a mid-December Saturday morning.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="83.0">Williams had recently made a secret purchase of a small black device off Amazon. It looked like a USB drive. The on-off switch and microphone holes revealed what it really was: a bug. As the two men chatted over cups of cannoli-flavored coffee, Williams didn’t notice when Kinch’s dog snatched the bug from his bag.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="84.0">The night before, Williams had slept in the guest room. The house was cluttered with semiautomatic rifles. He had risked photographing three plaques on the walls inscribed with the same Ernest Hemingway line. “There is no hunting like the hunting of man,” they read. “Those who have hunted armed men long enough and liked it, never really care for anything else.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="85.0">They spotted the dog at the same time. The bug was attached to a charging device. The animal was running around with it like it was a tennis ball. As Kinch went to retrieve it, Williams felt panic grip his chest. Could anyone talk their way out of this? He’d learned enough about Kinch to be terrified of his rage. Looking around, Williams eyed his host’s handgun on the kitchen counter.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="86.0"><em>If he even starts to examine it, I’ll grab the gun,</em> he thought. <em>Then I’ll shoot him and flee into the woods.</em></p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="86.1">Kinch took the bug from the dog’s mouth. Then he handed it right to Williams and started to apologize.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="89.0">On their way out the door, Kinch grabbed the pistol and placed it in the console of his truck. It was an hour’s drive to the nearest city, where the Oath Keepers were holding a leadership meeting. Williams rode shotgun, his bug hooked onto the zipper of his backpack. On the tape, I could hear the wind racing through the car window. The radio played Bryan Adams’ “Summer of ’69.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="90.0">Kinch seemed in the hold of a dark nostalgia — as if he was wrestling with the monotony of civilian life, with the new strictures he faced since turning in his badge. Twenty minutes in, he recited the Hemingway line like it was a mantra. “I have a harder time killing animals than a human being,” Kinch continued. Then he grew quiet as he recounted the night he decided to retire.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="91.0">He’d woken up in an oleander bush with no memory of how he’d gotten there. His hands were covered in blood. He was holding a gun. “I had to literally take my magazine out and count my bullets, make sure I didn’t fucking kill somebody,” he said. “I black out when I get angry. And I don’t remember what the fuck I did.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="92.0">Kinch went on: “I love the adrenaline of police work,” and then he paused. “I miss it. It was a hoot.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="93.0">By the time they reached Cedar City, Utah, Kinch was back to charismatic form. He dished out compliments to the dozen or so Oath Keepers assembled for the meeting — “You look like you lost weight” — and told everyone to put their phones in their cars. “It’s just good practice. Because at some point we may have to go down a route,” one of his deputies explained, trailing off.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="94.0">Kinch introduced Williams to the group. “He’s not the feds. And if he is, he’s doing a damn good job.” </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="94.1">Williams laughed, a little too loud.</p>

<hr>
<h3><p>7. Doctor, Lawyer, Sergeant, Spy</p>
</h3>

        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="95.0">Early in the meeting, Kinch laid out his vision for the Oath Keepers’ role in American life. “We have a two-edged sword,” he said. The “dull edge” was more traditional grassroots work, exemplified by efforts to combat alleged election fraud. He hoped to build their political apparatus so that in five or 10 years, conservative candidates would be seeking the Oath Keepers’ endorsement.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="96.0">Then there was the sharp edge: paramilitary training. “You hone all these skills because when the dull edge fails, you’ve got to be able to turn that around and be sharp.” The room smelled like donuts, one of the men had remarked.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="99.0">The week before, Kinch’s predecessor had been convicted of seditious conspiracy. This was their first meeting since the verdict, and I opened the recordings later with the same anticipation I feel sitting down for the Super Bowl. What would come next for the militia after this historic trial: ruin, recovery or revolt?</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="100.0">The stature of men leading the group’s post-Jan. 6 resurrection startled me. I was expecting the ex-cops, like the one from Fresno, California, who said he stayed on with the militia because “this defines me.” Militias tend to prize law enforcement ties; during an armed operation, it could be useful to have police see you as a friend.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="101.0">But there was also an Ohio OB-GYN on the national board of directors — he used to work for the Cleveland Clinic, I discovered, and now led a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group. The doctor was joined at board meetings by a city prosecutor in Utah, an ex-city council member and, Williams was later told, a sergeant with an Illinois sheriff’s department. (The doctor did not respond to requests for comment. He has since left his post with the UnitedHealth subsidiary, a spokesperson for the company said.)</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="102.0">Over six hours, the men set goals and delegated responsibilities with surprisingly little worry about the federal crackdown on militias. They discussed the scourges they were there to combat (stolen elections, drag shows, President Joe Biden) only in asides. Instead, they focused on “marketing” — “So what buzzwords can we insert in our mission statement?” one asked — and on resources that’d help local chapters rapidly expand. “I’d like to see this organization be like the McDonald’s of patriot organizations,” another added. To Williams, it felt more like a Verizon sales meeting than an insurrectionist cell.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="103.0">Kinch had only recently taken over and as I listened, I wondered how many followers he really had outside of that room. They hadn’t had a recruitment drive in the past year, which they resolved to change. They had $1,700 in the bank. But it didn’t seem entirely bravado. Kinch and his comrades mentioned conversations with chapters around the county.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="104.0">Then as they turned from their weakened national presence to their recent successes in Utah, Williams snapped to attention.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="104.1">“We had surveillance operations,” Kinch said, without elaboration.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="105.0">“We’re making progress locally on the law enforcement,” Coates added. He said that at least three of them can get “the sheriff” on the phone any time of day. Like the last time, Coates didn’t give a name, but he said something even more intriguing: “The sheriff is my tie-in to the state attorney general because he’s friends.” Williams told me he fought the urge to lob a question. (The attorney general’s office did not respond to requests for comment.)</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="106.0">Closing out the day, Kinch summarized their plan moving forward: Keep a low profile. Focus on the unglamorous work. Rebuild their national footprint. And patiently prepare for 2024. “We still got what, two more years, till another quote unquote election?” He thanked Williams for coming and asked if they could start planning training exercises.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="107.0">“Absolutely, yeah, I’m excited about that.” Williams was resolved to find his way onto the national board.</p>

<hr>
<h3><p>8. The Stakeout</p>
</h3>

        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="108.0">On Dec. 17, 2022, a week after the meeting, Williams called a tech-savvy 19-year-old Oath Keeper named Rowan. He’d told Rowan he was going to teach him to infiltrate leftist groups, but Williams’ real goal was far more underhanded. While the older Oath Keepers had demurred at his most sensitive questions recently, the teenager seemed eager to impress a grizzled survival instructor. By assigning missions to Rowan, he hoped to probe the militias’ secrets without casting suspicion on himself.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="109.0">“You don’t quite have the life experience to do this,” Williams opened on the recording. But with a couple years’ training, “I think we can work towards that goal.” He assigned his student a scholarly monograph, “Alienation: Marx’s Conception of Man in a Capitalist Society,” to begin his long education in how leftists think. “Perfect,” Rowan responded. He paused to write the title down.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="110.0">Then came his pupil’s first exercise: build a dossier on Williams’ boss in AP3. Williams explained it was safest to practice on people they knew.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="111.0">In Rowan, Williams had found a particularly vulnerable target. He was on probation at the time. According to court records, earlier that year, Rowan had walked up to a stranger’s truck as she was leaving her driveway. She rolled down her window. He punched her several times in the face. When police arrived, Rowan began screaming that he was going to kill them and threatened to “blow up the police department.” He was convicted of misdemeanor assault.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="112.0">Williams felt guilty about using the young man but also excited. (“He is completely in my palm,” he recorded in his diary.) Within a few weeks, he had Rowan digging into Kinch’s background. “I’m going to gradually have him do more and more things,” he said in the diary, “with the hopes that I can eventually get him to hack” into militia leaders’ accounts.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="113.0">The relationship quickly unearthed something that disturbed him. The week of their call, Williams woke up to a series of angry messages in the Oath Keepers’ encrypted Signal channel. The ire was directed toward a Salt Lake Tribune reporter who, according to Coates, was “a real piece of shit.” His sins included critical coverage of “anyone trying to expose voter fraud” and writing about a local political figure who’d appeared on a leaked Oath Keepers roster.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="114.0">Williams messaged Rowan. “I noticed in the chat that there is some kind of red list of journalists etc? Could you get that to me?” he asked. “It would be very helpful to my safety when observing political rallies or infiltrating leftists.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="115.0">“Ah yes, i have doxes on many journalists in utah,” Rowan responded, using slang for sharing someone’s personal data with malicious intent.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="116.0">He sent over a dossier on the Tribune reporter, which opened with a brief manifesto: “This dox goes out to those that have been terrorized, doxed, harassed, slandered, and family names mutilated by these people.” It provided the reporter’s address and phone number, along with two pictures of his house.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="117.0">Then Rowan shared similar documents about a local film critic — he’d posted a “snarky” retweet of the Tribune writer — and about a student reporter at Southern Utah University. The college student had covered a rally the Oath Keepers recently attended, Rowan explained, and the militia believed he was coordinating with the Tribune. “We found the car he drove through a few other members that did a stakeout.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="118.0">“That’s awesome,” Williams said. Internally, he was reeling: a stakeout? In the dossier, he found a backgrounder on the student’s parents along with their address. Had armed men followed this kid around? Did they surveil his family home?</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="119.0">His notes show him wrestling with a decision he hadn’t let himself reckon with before: Was it time to stop being a fly on the wall and start taking action? Did he need to warn someone? The journalists? The police? Breaking character would open the door to disaster. The incident with Kinch’s dog had been a chilling reminder of the risks.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="120.0">Williams had been in the militia too long. He was losing his sense of objectivity. The messages were alarming, but were they an imminent threat? He couldn’t tell. Williams had made plans to leave Utah if his cover was blown. He didn’t want to jeopardize two years of effort over a false alarm. But what if he did nothing and this kid got hurt?</p>

<h3><p>9. The Plan</p>
</h3>

        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="122.0">By 2023, Williams’ responsibilities were expanding as rapidly as his anxiety. His schedule was packed with events for AP3, the Oath Keepers and a third militia he’d recently gotten inside. He vowed to infiltrate the Proud Boys and got Coates to vouch for him with the local chapter. He prepared plans to penetrate a notorious white supremacist group too.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="123.0">His adversaries were gaining momentum as well. Williams soon made the four-hour drive to Kinch’s house for another leadership meeting and was told on tape about a national Oath Keepers recruiting bump; they’d also found contact information for 40,000 former members, which they hoped to use to bring a flood of militiamen back into the fold.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="124.0">Despite the risk to his own safety and progress, Williams decided to send the journalists anonymous warnings from burner accounts. He attached sensitive screenshots so that they’d take him seriously. And then … nothing. The reporters never responded; he wondered if the messages went to spam. His secret was still secure.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="125.0">But the point of his mission was finally coming into focus. He was done simply playing the part of model militia member. His plan had two parts: After gathering as much compromising information as he could, he would someday release it all online, he told me. He carefully documented anything that looked legally questionable, hoping law enforcement would find something useful for a criminal case. At the very least, going public could make militiamen more suspicious of each other.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="126.0">In the meantime, he would undermine the movement from the inside. He began trying to blunt the danger that he saw lurking in every volatile situation the militiamen put themselves in.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="127.0">On Jan. 27, 2023, body camera footage from the police killing of Tyre Nichols, an unarmed Black man, became public. “The footage is gruesome and distressing,” The New York Times reported. “Cities across the U.S. are bracing for protests.” The militias had often responded to Black Lives Matter rallies with street brawls and armed patrols.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="128.0">Williams had visions of Kyle Rittenhouse-esque shootings in the streets. He put his newly formulated strategy into action, sending messages to militiamen around the country with made-up rumors he hoped would persuade them to stay home.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="129.0">In Utah, he wrote to Kinch and the leaders of his other two militias. He would be undercover at the protests in Salt Lake City, he wrote. If any militiamen went, even “a brief look of recognition could blow my cover and put my life in danger.” All three ordered their troops to avoid the event. (“This is a bit of a bummer,” one AP3 member responded. “I’ve got some aggression built up I need to let out.”)</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="130.0">After the protests, Williams turned on his voice diary and let out a long sigh. For weeks, he’d been nauseous and had trouble eating. He’d developed insomnia that would keep him up until dawn. He’d gone to the rally to watch for militia activity. When he got home, he’d vomited blood.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="131.0">Even grocery shopping took hours now. He circled the aisles to check if he was being tailed. Once while driving, he thought he caught someone following him. He’d reached out to a therapist to help “relieve some of this pressure,” he said, but was afraid to speak candidly with him. “I can check his office for bugs and get his electronics out of the office. And then once we’re free, I can tell him what’s going on.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="132.0">He quickly launched into a litany of items on his to-do list. A training exercise to attend. A recording device he needed to find a way to install. “I’m just fucking sick of being around these toxic motherfuckers.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="133.0">“It’s getting to be too much for me.”</p>

<h3><p>10. The Deep State</p>
</h3>

        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="137.0">On March 20, Williams called Scot Seddon, the founder of AP3. If he was on the verge of a breakdown, it didn’t impact his performance. I could tell when Williams was trying to advance his agenda as I listened later, but he was subtle about it. Obsequious. Methodical. By day’s end, he’d achieved perhaps his most remarkable feat yet. He’d helped persuade Seddon and his lieutenants to fire the head of AP3’s Utah chapter and to install Williams in his place.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="138.0">Now he had access to sensitive records only senior militia leaders could see. He had final say over the group’s actions in an entire state. He knew the coup would make him vastly more effective. Yet that night in his voice diary, Williams sounded like a man in despair.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="139.0">The success only added to his paranoia. Becoming a major figure in the Utah militia scene raised a possibility he couldn’t countenance: He might be arrested and sent to jail for some action of his comrades.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="140.0">With a sense of urgency now, he focused even more intently on militia ties to government authorities. “I have been still collecting evidence on the paramilitaries’ use of law enforcement,” he said in the diary entry. “It’s way deeper than I thought.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="141.0">He solved the mystery of the Oath Keepers’ “sheriff”: It was the sheriff for Iron County, Utah, a tourist hub near two national parks. He assigned Rowan to dig deeper into the official’s ties with the movement and come back with emails or text messages. (In a recent interview, the sheriff told me that he declined an offer to join the Oath Keepers but that he’s known “quite a few” members and thinks “they’re generally good people.” Coates has periodically contacted him about issues like firearms rules that Coates believes are unconstitutional, the sheriff said. “If I agree, I contact the attorney general’s office.”)</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="142.0">Claiming to work on “a communication strategy for reaching out to law enforcement,” Williams then goaded AP3 members into bragging about their police connections. They told him about their ties with high-ranking officers in Missouri and in Louisiana, in Texas and in Tennessee.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="143.0">The revelations terrified him. “When this gets out, I think I’m probably going to flee overseas,” he said in his diary. “They have too many connections.” What if a cop ally helped militants track him down? “I don’t think I can safely stay within the United States.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="144.0">Four days later, he tuned into a Zoom seminar put on by a fellow AP3 leader. It was a rambling and sparsely attended meeting. But 45 minutes in, a woman brought up an issue in her Virginia hometown, population 23,000.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="145.0">The town’s vice mayor, a proud election denier, was under fire for a homophobic remark. She believed a local reporter covering the controversy was leading a secret far-left plot. What’s more, the reporter happened to be her neighbor. To intimidate her, she said, he’d been leaving dead animals on her lawn.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="146.0">“I think I have to settle a score with this guy,” she concluded. “They’re getting down to deep state local level and it’s got to be stopped.” After the call, Williams went to turn off his recording device. “Well, that was fucking insane,” he said aloud.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="147.0">He soon reached out to the woman to offer his advice. Maybe he could talk her down, Williams thought, or at least determine what she meant by settling a score. But she wasn’t interested in speaking with him. So again he faced a choice: do nothing or risk his cover being blown. He finally came to the same conclusion he had the last time he’d feared journalists were in jeopardy. On March 31, he sent an anonymous warning.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="148.0">“Because she is a member of a right wing militia group and is heavily armed, I wanted to let you know,” Williams wrote to the reporter. “I believe her to be severely mentally ill and I believe her to be dangerous. For my own safety, I cannot reveal more.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="149.0">He saw the article the next morning. The journalist had published 500 words about the disturbing email he’d gotten, complete with a screenshot of Williams’ entire note. Only a few people had joined that meandering call. Surely only Williams pestered the woman about it afterwards. There could be little doubt that he was the mole.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="150.0">He pulled the go bag from his closet and fled. A few days later, while on the run, Williams recorded the final entries in his diary. Amid the upheaval, he sounded surprised to feel a sense of relief: “I see the light at the end of the tunnel for the first time in two and a half years.”</p>

<h3><p>Coda: Project 2025</p>
</h3>

        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="152.0">It was seven days before the 2024 presidential election. Williams had insisted I not bring my phone, on the off chance my movements were being tracked. We were finally meeting for the first time, in a city that he asked me not to disclose. He entered the cramped hotel room wearing a camo hat, hiking shoes and a “Spy vs. Spy” comic strip T-shirt. “Did you pick the shirt to match the occasion?” I asked. He laughed. “Sometimes I can’t help myself.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="155.0">We talked for days, with Williams splayed across a Best Western office chair beside the queen bed. He evoked an aging computer programmer with 100 pounds of muscle attached, and he seemed calmer than on the phone, endearingly offbeat. The vision he laid out — of his own future and of the country’s — was severe.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="156.0">After he dropped everything and went underground, Williams spent a few weeks in the desert. He threw his phone in a river, flushed documents down the toilet and switched apartments when he returned to civilization. At first, he spent every night by the door ready for an attack; if anyone found him and ambushed him, it’d happen after dark, he figured. No one ever came, and he began to question if he’d needed to flee at all. The insomnia of his undercover years finally abated. He began to sketch out the rest of his life.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="157.0">Initially, he hoped to connect with lawmakers in Washington, helping them craft legislation to combat the militia movement. By last summer, those ambitions had waned. Over time, he began to wrestle with his gift for deceiving people who trusted him. “I don’t necessarily like what it says about me that I have a talent for this,” he said.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="158.0">To me, it seemed that the ordeal might be starting to change him. He’d become less precise in consistently adhering to the facts in recent weeks, I thought, more grandiose in his account of his own saga. But then for long stretches, he’d speak with the same introspection and attention to detail that he showed on our first calls. His obsession with keeping the Tyre Nichols protestors safe was myopic, he told me, a case of forgetting the big picture to quash the few dangers he could control.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="159.0">Williams believes extremists will try to murder him after this story is published. And if they fail, he thinks he’ll “live to see the United States cease to exist.” He identifies with the violent abolitionist John Brown, who tried to start a slave revolt two years before the American Civil War and was executed. Williams thinks he himself may not be seen as such a radical soon, he told me. “I wonder if I’m maybe a little too early.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="160.0">I’d thought Williams was considering a return to a quiet life. Our two intense years together had been a strain sometimes even for me. But in the hotel room, he explained his plans for future operations against militias: “Until they kill me, this is what I’m doing.” He hopes to inspire others to follow in his footsteps and even start his own vigilante collective, running his own “agents” inside the far right.</p>
        
    
                                  
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="162.0">In August, I published my <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/inside-secret-ap3-militia-american-patriots-three-percent">investigation into AP3</a>. (I used his records but did not otherwise rely on Williams as an anonymous source.) It was a way of starting to lay out what I’d learned since his first email: what’s driving the growth of militias, how they keep such a wide range of people united, the dangerous exploits that they’ve managed to keep out of public view.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="163.0">Two months later, Williams published an anonymous essay. He revealed that he’d infiltrated the group as an “independent activist” and had sent me files. He wanted to test how the militia would respond to news of a mole.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="164.0">The result was something he long had hoped for: a wave of paranoia inside AP3. “It’s a fucking risky thing we get involved in,” Seddon, the group’s founder, said in a private message. “Fucking trust nobody. There’s fucking turncoats everywhere.” (Seddon declined to comment for this story. He then sent a short follow-up email: “MAGA.”)</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="165.0">Sowing that distrust is why Williams is going on the record, albeit without his original name. He still plans to release thousands of files after this article is published — evidence tying sheriffs and police officers to the movement, his proudest coup, plus other records he hopes could become ammo for lawsuits. But Williams wants to let his former comrades know “a faggot is doing this to them.” He thinks his story could be his most effective weapon.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="166.0">Every time militia members make a phone call, attend a meeting or go to a gun range together, he wants them “to be thinking, in the back of their heads, ‘This guy will betray me.’”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>I transitioned to the role of Engineering Manager approximately 5 years ago, since then I haven't been programming in my day job but the itch to do so has always been there. So I continue to work on side projects to not lose touch and continue to hone my skills.</p><p>Because my time has always been limited, progress on side projects had been slow in the past, and many remained unfinished as life's events caused a loss of momentum, making them harder to resume. However, in the last year (2024), I have been very productive with my side projects, quickly building the tools or projects I need and deploying them for others to use—in other words, finishing the v1 of each project.</p><p>A few examples of what I've built are</p><ul><li><a href="https://jsonplayground.com/?ref=zohaib.me">jsonplayground.com</a> - JSON formatter but also in browser <a href="https://jqlang.github.io/jq/?ref=zohaib.me">JQ</a> using WASM so no data leaves the machine.</li></ul><figure><img src="https://zohaib.me/content/images/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-31-at-00.25.07.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1069" srcset="https://zohaib.me/content/images/size/w600/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-31-at-00.25.07.png 600w, https://zohaib.me/content/images/size/w1000/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-31-at-00.25.07.png 1000w, https://zohaib.me/content/images/size/w1600/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-31-at-00.25.07.png 1600w, https://zohaib.me/content/images/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-31-at-00.25.07.png 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><ul><li><a href="http://webtomarkdown.com/?ref=zohaib.me">webtomarkdown.com</a> - As I often feel the need of converting files to Markdown, or parts of website to Markdown for passing in as context to LLMs. I'm currently building this tool to solve that problem.</li></ul><figure><img src="https://zohaib.me/content/images/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-31-at-00.24.29.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1082" srcset="https://zohaib.me/content/images/size/w600/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-31-at-00.24.29.png 600w, https://zohaib.me/content/images/size/w1000/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-31-at-00.24.29.png 1000w, https://zohaib.me/content/images/size/w1600/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-31-at-00.24.29.png 1600w, https://zohaib.me/content/images/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-31-at-00.24.29.png 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><ul><li>Face lift for my soaring club page <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/42oasltzi9n0k10/Screenshot%202024-12-31%20at%2000.22.40.png?dl=0&amp;ref=zohaib.me">Evergreen Soaring</a> where I volunteer (not deployed yet on official website).</li></ul><figure><img src="https://zohaib.me/content/images/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-31-at-00.22.40.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1569" srcset="https://zohaib.me/content/images/size/w600/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-31-at-00.22.40.png 600w, https://zohaib.me/content/images/size/w1000/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-31-at-00.22.40.png 1000w, https://zohaib.me/content/images/size/w1600/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-31-at-00.22.40.png 1600w, https://zohaib.me/content/images/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-31-at-00.22.40.png 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><ul><li>A Chrome Browser Extension to automate parts of public messages we receive at my soaring club.</li><li><a href="https://fitinterval.com/?ref=zohaib.me">fitinterval.com</a> - Interval timer for workouts</li></ul><figure><img src="https://zohaib.me/content/images/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-31-at-00.28.48.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="745" srcset="https://zohaib.me/content/images/size/w600/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-31-at-00.28.48.png 600w, https://zohaib.me/content/images/size/w1000/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-31-at-00.28.48.png 1000w, https://zohaib.me/content/images/size/w1600/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-31-at-00.28.48.png 1600w, https://zohaib.me/content/images/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-31-at-00.28.48.png 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>LLMs in general have been immense booster for my productivity when it comes to side projects and more specifically the <a href="https://www.cursor.com/?ref=zohaib.me">Cursor IDE</a> has been a great editor to use these LLMs for coding.</p><p>In this blog I'll go over what my high level flow looks like for greenfield projects and I hope that may help you. I do want to acknowledge that these tools are good in certain cases but may annoy you (waste time) in other areas, you just need to use them to figure out where specifically it's useful for you.</p><p>I have a nice habit tracker that I would like to replicate as a website, but all data stored locally, so let's use that as an example of what to create here.</p><figure><img src="https://zohaib.me/content/images/2025/01/IMG_6790.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="3313" srcset="https://zohaib.me/content/images/size/w600/2025/01/IMG_6790.jpg 600w, https://zohaib.me/content/images/size/w1000/2025/01/IMG_6790.jpg 1000w, https://zohaib.me/content/images/size/w1600/2025/01/IMG_6790.jpg 1600w, https://zohaib.me/content/images/2025/01/IMG_6790.jpg 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h2 id="start-with-a-spec">Start with a spec</h2><p>I use the o1 ChatGPT to first get my application specification more refined. The reason I do that is so that it helps me scope the problem and also the spec I get at the end, I use it in further stages of bootstrapping the code. You can try to write the spec yourself, but I feel that going from few sentences to more detailed spec through ChatGPT o1 has been very useful in saving me time. I also ask it to further probe me with questions to further refine it.</p><p>Following the prompt I start with. </p><blockquote>I’m want to build a website for habit tracking where user sees columns of months and each row being a date. They can simply select to indicate a day where they continued with the habit. It should store all that on local machine. Ask me more questions to refine the idea.</blockquote><p>It asks me bunch of questions which I answer, but then it continues asking me more questions. At some point, where you feel there is enough details, you should explicitly ask it to create a spec with the details that will allow another person/AI to build application. I also specify the technology I would prefer to use as thats what I'm familiar with most.</p><blockquote>Answer those questions for me reasonably and create a spec that I can give to a person or another AI to help create the website. Make sure to have the details of project, user experience, technical details. I want to use typescript, react, tailwind css.</blockquote><p>You can read the whole chat here: <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/6775ad7b-21e4-800e-a4c7-44c9bbbcc7a2?ref=zohaib.me">Habit Tracking Website Plan</a></p><p>Now store that spec in <code>SPEC.md</code> in a folder where your project will be. We will continue to refer back to it when needed.</p><h2 id="bootstrap-project">Bootstrap project</h2><p>I use <a href="https://vite.dev/guide/?ref=zohaib.me">Vite</a> to bootstrap my project. This allows me to setup all the necessary tooling in a consistent manner. <br>In the directory of project I run <code>npm create vite@latest .</code> which will ask me question about which UX framework and Language to use. Once I have the project and <code>SPEC.md</code> in that project I use the Cursor Agent to create the initial code.</p><p>You can go to Composer &gt; Select Agent &gt; Added SPEC.md in the context and ask it to implement it.</p><p>This will go over your code, setup tailwind, update few files to create the initial version.</p><figure><img src="https://zohaib.me/content/images/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-01-at-13.17.48.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1552" height="1972" srcset="https://zohaib.me/content/images/size/w600/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-01-at-13.17.48.png 600w, https://zohaib.me/content/images/size/w1000/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-01-at-13.17.48.png 1000w, https://zohaib.me/content/images/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-01-at-13.17.48.png 1552w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>This is what the initial version looked like.

That can sometime work but can lead to issues and makes it harder (and slower as it will regenerate bunch of code that it doesn't need to change) to iterate. Follow a divide and conquer approach, i.e. split your feature into smaller tasks and iterate over them using the Chat/Composer.</p><p>Now first let's fix the bug and also change the UX. In my spec conversation with o1, I ask it to create a spec for UX focused more on skeuomorphic aspects of it. Then I use the Cursor Composer to update the code.

So it fixed the bug, and also updated the UX to have some more Led like behavior with depth, some shadows etc. It still look horrible but we will further iterate on that.</p><figure><img src="https://zohaib.me/content/images/2025/01/image-1.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1304" srcset="https://zohaib.me/content/images/size/w600/2025/01/image-1.png 600w, https://zohaib.me/content/images/size/w1000/2025/01/image-1.png 1000w, https://zohaib.me/content/images/size/w1600/2025/01/image-1.png 1600w, https://zohaib.me/content/images/size/w2400/2025/01/image-1.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>In the next iteration I gave the above screenshot (yes cursor can also use images for context) in Chat mode and first asked it to describe the details the button and then asked it to make necessary changes to replicate that.

Composer (agent) can run commands in terminal, lint code, re-iterate etc, but going back to the principle of small iterations, I try to scope things to what I can review easily and add.</li><li>Provide relevant context as much as possible e.g. specific files you want changed, specific docs (links), or submit with codebase option in chat when you want it to search for relevant context.</li><li>Store markdown files relevant to your project so you can add those as context e.g. SPEC.md, documentation from website that you often get back from (plugging <a href="https://webtomarkdown.com/?ref=zohaib.me">https://webtomarkdown.com</a> for converting a website documentation to Markdown and storing it 😄)</li><li>Create and use .cursorrules file in your project directory for instructions that you want it to take in prompts, e.g. if you see it always using some library you don't want then add it to .cursorrules, specific technology that you want it to user in code e.g. Tailwind, certain component library e.g. Shadcn etc. This allows you to start nudging it in direction you want for most of your prompts.</li><li>Always make sure that you understand the code at high level so you don't land in a space where eventually it's such a messy code that it becomes hard for you to debug when LLMs can't find issues for you. My tip is to continue to split stuff into manageable pieces (hint, you can use LLMs to do it from time to time).</li></ol><p>I hope this has been helpful, and that you can start finishing the first versions of your projects and deploying them. By turning unfinished projects into completed and deployed ones, you can continue to build momentum even when you take small breaks. This approach allows you to gradually add more to your projects while keeping them manageable. I believe this also helps keep me motivated, as I get to see progress more quickly on what I want to deliver.</p>

<p>Wherein I learn too much about VGA hardware and generate some really cool glitch art while I try to fix somebody else's fix for a video driver that's older than I am.</p>

<hr>
<p>I'm a bit of a retro tech enjoyer, but I'm also pretty bad at it -- I don't have the space or the motivation to try and acquire actual old computers. Playing with 86Box/PCem is pretty fun, but it's not quite the same.</p>
<p>So, instead, I make do with what I have. And the most ridiculous x86 machine I own is the <em>Asus Eee PC 1000H</em>, a netbook that I got in 2008 when that category was still new and exciting. It's borderline useless nowadays (it can't even run most up-to-date Linux distros due to its lack of x86_64 support), so sticking weird and anachronistic OSes on it is one way to keep it relevant!</p>
<p><a rel="lightbox" href="https://wuffs.org/user/pages/02.blog/windows-3x-graphics/640x480.jpg"><img alt="Windows 3.11 on my Eee PC, with a blurry and horizontally stretched screen. Text in Notepad says: &quot;fixedsys is not supposed to be this wide :( and I need more screen space!!!&quot;" src="https://wuffs.org/images/b/1/c/9/2/b1c921a98b56d269d1bab531eca7615c982be6ab-640x480.jpg"></a></p>
<p>I'd like to write a full-fledged blog post about these adventures at some point, but for now I'm going to focus on one particular side quest: getting acceptable video output out of the 1000H when it's running <strong>Windows 3.11 for Workgroups</strong>.</p>
<p>By default, Windows 3.x renders using the standard "lowest common denominator" of video: VGA 640x480 at 16 colours. Unfortunately this looks awful on the Eee PC's beautiful 1024x600 screen, and it's not even the same aspect ratio.</p>

<p>But how can we do better? The 3.11 installer includes a smattering of drivers for long-obsolete video adapters, but they didn't have the prescience to support the <em>Intel GMA 950</em> in my netbook. (For shame, Microsoft. <strong>For shame.</strong>)</p>
<p>There's an included 'Super VGA' driver that ostensibly supports up to 1024x768 at 256 colours, but it doesn't work, for... reasons that we'll go into, even though you'd think that a 2008 machine would surely be able to do SVGA. If I try to use it, I'll just get an error and Windows will fail to start.</p>
<h2>The Horrors of IBM PC Video</h2>
<p>Nowadays when we hear 'VGA' we usually think of the funky little blue analogue connector, or maybe just the 640x480 resolution itself. These are just aspects of VGA, which was a very specific video controller designed by IBM in the 1980s.</p>
<p>'Super VGA' must be a better version, right? Well, yes, and no. As I understand it, at the time, SVGA was just an umbrella term for <em>anything more advanced than plain old VGA</em> - but not a standard in and of itself. So lots of SVGA cards could do better resolutions and colour depths and refresh rates, but each piece of software had to implement support for each individual card.</p>
<p>This leads to the mind-numbing situation we get with the Windows driver. From the readme for <a href="https://winworldpc.com/product/generic-svga-driver-/generic-svga-driver-windows-31">this driver's standalone release</a>, we get the following list of supported vendors:</p>
<ul>
<li>ATI VGA series, including Wonder, Wonder Plus and Wonder 24XL</li>
<li>Cirrus Logic VGA (6420, 5420 series)</li>
<li>Oak Technology VGA (077 series)</li>
<li>Paradise VGA, including 1024 and Professional</li>
<li>Trident VGA (8900C series), including Trident Impact</li>
<li>Tseng VGA (ET4000 series), including a whole bunch of other cards with the same chips</li>
<li>Video Seven VGA, including FastWrite, 1024i, VRAM and VRAM II</li>
<li>Western Digital VGA</li>
</ul>
<p>Obviously, my mid-2000s Intel video adapter is not among these. There was no real reason for Intel to use the same proprietary extensions as Trident or Oak or Video Seven. So we're boned, I guess...</p>
<h2>They Should Make A Standard</h2>
<p>Good news! <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VESA_BIOS_Extensions">They did!</a> ... Too bad it came too late to be relevant to Windows 3.x.</p>
<p>VBE (VESA BIOS Extensions) is a generic interface that lets software talk to video adapters and do things that are beyond the capabilities of plain old VGA, and in theory it's exactly what we need. <em>(And yes, that's the same VESA that's responsible for the monitor mounts.)</em></p>
<p>BearWindows has released <a href="https://bearwindows.zcm.com.au/vbe9x.htm">VBE9x</a> and <a href="https://bearwindows.zcm.com.au/vbemp.htm">VBEMP</a> which allow Windows 9x and NT respectively to use VBE, which both work pretty well. There's no 3.x version though.</p>
<p>There is also <strong>SVGAPatch</strong>, available from <a href="https://www.japheth.de/">japheth.de</a>, which patches Microsoft's 256-colour Super VGA driver to use VBE. The result is beautiful...</p>
<p><a rel="lightbox" href="https://wuffs.org/user/pages/02.blog/windows-3x-graphics/1024x600.jpg"><img alt="The Eee PC again, but this time, it's rendering the desktop crisply at the native resolution. I've got a failed Minesweeper game open, and a Notepad window where I've typed &quot;haha who would try to put a 1993 OS on a machine from 2008, isn't that silly :thonk: fun fact: the fan on this is louder than the one on my M1 MacBook Pro&quot;" src="https://wuffs.org/user/pages/02.blog/windows-3x-graphics/1024x600.jpg"></a></p>
<p>...when it works. You see, one of the headline features of early Windows was its compatibility with MS-DOS software. You could just pull up a DOS prompt in a window, and with 3.1's <em>Enhanced Mode</em>, you even got mostly-seamless multitasking of DOS applications alongside graphical Windows ones. This was a Big Deal™ in those days!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, SVGAPatch doesn't play nicely with this, and I wanted to figure out why. Entering full-screen mode and then returning to the Windows GUI will leave you with a corrupted screen. In some cases, opening <em>any</em> DOS prompt, even if it's in windowed mode, will cause it. Here's what happened when I opened a windowed prompt.</p>
<p><a rel="lightbox" href="https://wuffs.org/user/pages/02.blog/windows-3x-graphics/default_driver.jpg"><img alt="The Eee PC's screen is showing a red grid of glitched pixels. Absolutely nothing is discernible." src="https://wuffs.org/user/pages/02.blog/windows-3x-graphics/default_driver.jpg"></a></p>
<p><em>(Hank Hill voice)</em> That prompt ain't right!</p>
<p>There's clearly some sort of state management issue; I've tried it with DOSBox, 86Box and my Eee PC, and interacting with DOS prompts will reliably break the driver on all three (but in subtly different ways).</p>
<p>So, let’s analyse how this works, with my very limited knowledge of the PC architecture. Can I find the problem, and maybe fix it??</p>
<p><em>Side note:</em> Halfway through working on this I came across <a href="https://github.com/PluMGMK/vbesvga.drv">PluMGMK/vbesvga.drv</a> which is a brand new driver that even supports true colour modes. This is, in all honesty, a far better approach than mine - but I was invested and wanted to see how far I could get with Microsoft's code.</p>
<h2>The Windows 3.x Hellscape</h2>
<p>To grok what’s going on, we need a cursory understanding of how Windows 3.x works in its “Enhanced Mode”, as an OS on top of MS-DOS.</p>
<p>Rather than trying to explain it myself, I’ll link to a 2010 post from Raymond Chen’s blog: <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20100517-00/?p=14013">If Windows 3.11 required a 32-bit processor, why was it called a 16-bit operating system?</a> It’s good reading, but this is the most important bit for our purposes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With Enhanced mode, there were actually three operating systems running at the same time. The operating system in charge of the show was the 32-bit virtual machine manager which ran in 32-bit protected mode. As you might suspect from its name, the virtual machine manager created virtual machines. Inside the first virtual machine ran… a copy of Standard mode Windows.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This funky approach is what allowed Windows 3.x to run DOS applications without each app tying up the entire machine.</p>
<h2>The Display Driver Hellscape</h2>
<p>In Windows Setup, you get to tell it what video adapter you're using. You’d probably assume that this is choosing one driver. Nope!</p>
<p><a rel="lightbox" href="https://wuffs.org/user/pages/02.blog/windows-3x-graphics/setup_000.png"><img alt="Screenshot of Windows 3.11 Setup, where you can pick your display from a long list, including &quot;Super VGA&quot; (multiple resolution and font size variants), &quot;VGA&quot;, &quot;VGA (version 3.0)&quot; and &quot;Video 7&quot; (also with multiple variants)" src="https://wuffs.org/user/pages/02.blog/windows-3x-graphics/setup_000.png"></a></p>
<p>When you pick an option from this list, it will…</p>
<ul>
<li>Install all the required files from the floppy diskettes (how quaint!)
<ul>
<li>A grabber</li>
<li>A display driver</li>
<li>A virtual display device</li>
<li>Required resources such as fonts</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Modify your <code>SYSTEM.INI</code> to tell Windows to use the specified drivers</li>
<li>Add any other INI entries required</li>
</ul>
<p>The different 256-colour SVGA entries are actually the same underlying drivers, but with different INI entries to set the desired resolution and DPI (96dpi for 'small fonts', 120dpi for 'large fonts').</p>
<hr>
<p>More critically however, there are three different components here that you could all think of as a sort of driver. As I understand them…</p>
<p>The <strong>Grabber</strong> seems to be responsible for rendering the windowed versions of DOS apps. This is the one I’ve investigated the least.</p>
<p>The <strong>Display Driver</strong> runs inside the main Windows VM, and is responsible for setting up the hardware and rendering the GUI. In fact, in 3.x, each of these included its own implementation of much of GDI (the API for drawing).</p>
<p>The <strong>Virtual Display Device</strong> (VDD) runs as part of the underlying virtual machine manager, and acts somewhat like a multiplexer for the video hardware. If a DOS app is full screen, its commands are directly sent to the ‘real’ VGA adapter; otherwise, they’re emulated by the VDD.</p>
<hr>
<p>There is a whole lot of nasty state synchronisation logic in the VDD that is likely related to my problems.</p>
<p>Interestingly, however, the SVGAPatch tool doesn’t alter the SVGA VDD at all — it <em>only</em> touches the display driver. Could that be the issue? 🤔</p>
<p>To continue, I’ll need to understand the display driver, the VDD <strong>and</strong> the undocumented patches made by SVGAPatch.</p>
<h2>Gathering Information</h2>
<p>As far as I can tell, this was a bit of a dark art back when 3.x was current, and it’s still rather difficult to find any info about all of these systems.</p>
<p>I learned a lot from this blog post on ‘OS/2 Museum’: <a href="https://www.os2museum.com/wp/windows-3-x-vddvga/">Windows 3.x VDDVGA</a>, and aside from that, I also had the Windows 3.1 DDK (Driver Development Kit), which is <a href="https://winworldpc.com/product/windows-sdk-ddk/windows-31">archived on WinWorld</a>.</p>
<p>The DDK includes the following bits which are relevant to us:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Display Driver source</strong>: VGA, IBM 8514, Video 7, 16-colour SVGA</li>
<li><strong>VDD source</strong>: VGA, IBM 8514, Video 7, 16-colour SVGA</li>
<li><strong>Grabber source</strong>: ... Basically all of them</li>
<li>A pitiful amount of written documentation</li>
</ul>
<p>Noticeably absent however are the 256-colour SVGA display driver and its associated VDD. I don’t know if these were included in a later DDK version, or if they just never left Microsoft at all.</p>
<p>I did grab the Windows 95 DDK to see if it contained anything relevant, but it wasn’t particularly useful.</p>
<p>All hope is not lost though, the 3.1 DDK is still helpful. I’m assuming that there are significant amounts of shared code between these drivers. We just need to wade through all the macro-laden assembly.</p>
<h2>Reversing the Display Driver</h2>
<h2>Step 1: Load the Code</h2>
<p>Disassembling 16-bit x86 code is pretty weird; I'm still not quite used to segments, as someone who's primarily looked at PowerPC and ARM code before. Still, it's doable.</p>
<p>IDA can load all the binaries with no issues, but unfortunately, not in the free version which is arbitrarily restricted to PE files. Ghidra can load the <code>.drv</code> display drivers, but not the VDD as it's actually a VxD.</p>
<p>I tried <a href="https://github.com/oshogbo/ghidra-lx-loader">oshogbo/ghidra-lx-loader</a> at first to load the VDD in Ghidra, but it fails. Then I tried <a href="https://github.com/yetmorecode/ghidra-lx-loader">yetmorecode/ghidra-lx-loader</a>, which works, but at the time of writing you need to build a PR to get it to work with the latest Ghidra.</p>
<pre><code>$ git clone git@github.com:yetmorecode/ghidra-lx-loader.git
$ git fetch origin pull/7/head:buildfix
$ git switch buildfix
$ GHIDRA_INSTALL_DIR=~/Downloads/ghidra_11.2.1_PUBLIC gradle buildExtension</code></pre>
<p>Once built, go to <em>File &gt; Install Extensions</em> in Ghidra, add the built extension zip file from <code>dist/</code>, and restart Ghidra.</p>

<p>You can now import the <code>vddsvga.386</code> file and it will be detected as a 'Linear Executable'. However, it's nowhere near as seamless as in IDA...</p>
<p>This VxD contains both 32-bit code and 16-bit code, but as far as I can tell, Ghidra expects the entire file to be either one or the other. So if I import the file with the default 'language' of 32-bit, it'll fail to decode the real mode initialisation code in the last segment. OTOH, if I switch it to 16-bit, then it'll fail to decode the vast majority of the code in the file.</p>
<p>I'm probably missing something due to my lack of familiarity with x86 and its tooling 🤔</p>
<h2>Step 2: Match Things Up</h2>
<p>After loading up <code>svga256.drv</code> (both the original Microsoft version and the SVGAPatch-modified version) and <code>vddsvga.386</code>, I was ready to begin.</p>
<p>I began with the <code>.drv</code> file. Conveniently, this one has a whole bunch of exported functions like <code>GETCHARWIDTH</code>, <code>STRETCHBLT</code> and <code>VIDEOINIT_ATI</code>, so I thought it'd be good to go through these and compare them to the source from the DDK, hopefully getting to name some other functions and global variables in the process.</p>
<p>Since <code>FASTBORDER</code> is the first one in the file, I started looking at that - it corresponds to <code>WIN31/DDK/286/DISPLAY/4PLANE/FB.ASM</code> in the DDK.</p>
<p>This is when I found out just how heavily this source code relies on macros...</p>
<p><a rel="lightbox" href="https://wuffs.org/user/pages/02.blog/windows-3x-graphics/fastborder.png"><img alt="Side-by-side screenshot of FB.ASM in VS Code next to the same routine in Ghidra's disassembly view. The source contains 24 lines of non-standard macros for defining parameters and local variables, which have been turned into 11 assembly instructions for creating a stack frame." src="https://wuffs.org/user/pages/02.blog/windows-3x-graphics/fastborder.png"></a></p>
<p>On the left is the DDK's source for <code>FASTBORDER</code>, and on the right is how it appears in Ghidra (after I've manually applied labels and variable/parameter names).</p>
<p>This is using <code>cProc</code> and associated macros, which seems to be a way to make defining C-compatible procedures more ergonomic... but it's not documented anywhere that I can see.</p>
<p>I can read the source for these macros, but they're somewhat inscrutable to say the least, with no comments and almost no indentation. A representative code sample:</p>
<pre><code>if ???+?po
if ?chkstk1
push bp
mov bp,sp
else
if ???
enter ???,0
else
push bp
mov bp,sp
endif
endif
endif</code></pre>
<p>For my purposes, I don't really need to understand this, I just need to know that I can skip past the initialisation guff every time I see it in a <code>cProc</code> procedure.</p>
<p>Likewise, there's <code>arg</code> and <code>cCall</code> macros used for calling these, but those are fairly self-explanatory:</p>
<pre><code>    arg &lt;lpPDevice,destx,desty,ax,ax,ax,ax,xext,yext,rop,lpPBrush,lpDrawMode&gt;
    cCall   BitBlt</code></pre>
<p>This just pushes all of these arguments onto the stack, and calls the function.</p>
<p>So <code>FASTBORDER</code> is essentially the same in <code>svga256.drv</code> as it is in the VGA driver that I have source for; that's promising!</p>
<hr>
<p>The next function is <code>GETCHARWIDTH</code>, which is used to retrieve the widths of characters in a font. This is where I reach a new issue - this function isn't the same.</p>
<p>Also, just to make my life a bit harder, the proc has 7 parameters but not all of them are used -- meaning that I need to be extra careful about making sure I name them correctly in Ghidra.</p>
<p><a rel="lightbox" href="https://wuffs.org/user/pages/02.blog/windows-3x-graphics/charwidth.png"><img alt="Another side-by-side comparison. The left side shows the heavily commented assembly source in VS Code, and the right side shows the disassembly in Ghidra.

<p>Turns out, there's some functionality in the VGA driver that adjusts the width of bold fonts. This does not seem to be present in <code>svga256.drv</code>!</p>
<p>I checked all the other implementations in the DDK's various drivers, but the VGA one is still the closest match. The Video 7 driver doesn't include this feature, but there are other differences in the code.</p>

<p>I wondered if this feature was added later, and maybe the SVGA256 driver was forked from an older version. There are some changelog-esque comments in many of these files, but MS don't seem to have done a great job at keeping them up to date :(</p>

;  moved into fixed code segment for fonts-in-EMS</code></pre>
<p>This is from the header for the VGA driver's <code>CHARWDTH.ASM</code> file.</p>
<p>It's very slightly different from the equivalent file in the PC-98 video driver, but both of these have identical dates and history entries, which suggests that I just can't put much faith into those comments.</p>
<p>Anyway, moving on...</p>
<hr>
<p>The next export after this was <code>REALIZEOBJECT</code>, which is the Windows GDI function that takes an object (pen, brush or font) and processes it to make it suitable for the driver - for example, choosing the closest available colour to the one requested by the application.</p>
<p>This one gave me a little more grief because it was my first time encountering a jump table, but it was doable. However... the colour handling logic is different, of course!</p>
<p>In the VGA driver's source, we see this logic with some curiously commented out code:</p>
<pre><code>realize_pen_10:
    xchg    ax,cx           ;Set pen type into CX
    lea si,[si].lopnColor   ;--&gt; RGB color
;   call    convert_index       ; convert the index into DH if the
                                    ; color is actually an index
;   jc  realize_pen_20      ; it was an index

    call    sum_RGB_colors      ;Sum up the color</code></pre>
<p>Whereas in SVGA256, the call to <code>sum_RGB_colors</code> has been replaced by ... a manually-inlined version of it? 🤔</p>
<p>Also, while the initial dispatch code is identical to the VGA driver's, the implementation of everything from <code>realize_brush</code> onwards is almost identical to the one from the Video 7 driver. Odd.</p>
<hr>
<p>After this, I realised that looking further at the GDI functions probably wouldn't be super helpful. It's helped me to get my bearings in this codebase, but what I <em>really</em> care about is how it interacts with the video adapter.</p>
<h2>Step 3: Initialising the Video Adapter</h2>
<p>I'd previously mentioned that when you select a type of video adapter in <em>Windows Setup</em>, it creates some INI entries in <code>SYSTEM.INI</code>.</p>
<p>If I pick <em>Super VGA (800x600, 256 colours, small fonts)</em>, I get the following entries:</p>
<pre><code>[svga256.drv]
dpi=96
resolution=2</code></pre>
<p>And after booting into Windows, the patched driver automatically adds these extra entries...</p>
<pre><code>svgamode=48
ChipSet=Tseng ET4000
LatchCapable=No</code></pre>
<p>I have no clue what these mean, but luckily, since these are named with nice text strings like <code>ChipSet</code>, it's very easy to find the code that interacts with them within the driver.</p>
<hr>
<p>The first one is in a function that, based on its placement, appears to be <code>driver_initialization</code>. I believe this is automatically called by Windows as the very first thing after the driver has been loaded into RAM.</p>
<p>If I look at the VGA driver from the DDK, it's got some pretty obtuse logic:</p>
<ul>
<li>Construct some flags based on whether we're on DOS 3.1.0 or higher, and whether we're on OS/2 or not</li>
<li>Call a <code>dev_initialization</code> function
<ul>
<li>Checks how much video memory is present, and disables a specific <code>BitBlt</code> feature if it's less than 256KB</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Load the <code>MouseTrails</code> setting from an INI</li>
<li>Mess with the function pointers to <code>ExtTextOut</code> and <code>StrBlt</code> for reasons I don't fully understand</li>
</ul>
<p>The Video 7 driver is a bit simpler -- it has the same flag logic, and it calls <code>dev_initialization</code> to assert that the driver is running on a 286 CPU or better, but it doesn't look at any INIs or mess with function pointers.</p>
<hr>
<p>On the other hand, the SVGA256 driver we're looking at is <em>trivial</em>.</p>
<p>Translated into pseudo-C just to make it a bit easier to understand:</p>
<pre><code>short ini_resolution = 0;
short ini_dpi = 96;

short driver_initialization(/* args not relevant here */) {
    short r = GetPrivateProfileInt("svga256.drv", "resolution", 0, "system.ini") &amp; 3;
    if (r != 0) {
        ini_resolution = r;
        ini_dpi = GetPrivateProfileInt("svga256.drv", "dpi", 0, "system.ini");
        return 1;
    }
    return 0;
}</code></pre>
<p>This function is untouched by SVGAPatch.</p>
<p>So that's useful... now, where do these get used?</p>
<hr>
<p>The function directly after it seems to be the equivalent to <code>physical_enable</code>. This is where it truly gets interesting - this is what sets up the VGA adapter!</p>
<p>We can look at this in <code>VGA.ASM</code> in the DDK; this uses assembler directives to generate different code for the VGA driver and for the 16-colour SVGA driver.</p>
<p>The code I see in SVGA256 is obviously an evolution of the latter. Once again I'll translate it to pseudo-C to make it easier to follow.</p>
<p>However, first I need to go on a slight tangent...</p>
<h3>System calls on the PC</h3>
<p>How do you "reach out" and interact with the OS or the hardware? There are three approaches we see in this driver.</p>
<p>Firstly, Windows functions like <code>SetPalette</code> and <code>WritePrivateProfileString</code> are imported from DLLs, so once you include the boilerplate to tell the assembler/linker about them, you can just call them like you would a function in your own code.</p>
<p>Then we have interrupts, which I've represented in this pseudocode using fake functions like <code>vga_enable_refresh()</code>. With these, you set certain registers to specific values (depending on what you want to do), and then use the x86 <code>INT</code> instruction.</p>
<p>I've looked them up in <a href="http://www.ctyme.com/rbrown.htm">this beautiful 90s-web adaptation of Ralf Brown's Interrupt List</a>, which is a very useful resource - I've also linked the individual pages below where referenced.</p>
<p><code>INT 10h</code> is the PC's <a href="http://www.ctyme.com/intr/int-10.htm">standard interrupt</a> for doing anything video-related; the contents of the <code>ax</code> register identify what operation you want to do.</p>
<p><code>INT 2Fh</code> is the <a href="http://www.ctyme.com/intr/int-2f.htm">"Multiplex" operation</a>, which is kind of like a miscellaneous bucket for services installed by MS-DOS, Windows, and other applications like TSRs.</p>
<p>Lastly, you can also just poke hardware registers directly using the <code>IN</code> and <code>OUT</code> x86 instructions. This isn't used in this particular function, but it'll show up in plenty of other places, as this is a fundamental part of working with VGA.</p>

}</code></pre>
<p>So that's the code, which doesn't translate super cleanly into pseudo-C, but I've tried my best. A high-level overview of what it's doing:</p>
<ol>
<li>Record the current video mode before we do anything</li>
<li>Check if a <code>svgamode</code> entry exists in <code>SYSTEM.INI</code></li>
<li>If so, call <code>SetAndValidateMode</code> to try that mode</li>
<li>If there was no entry <em>or</em> that mode failed, then go through each supported mode in turn until we find one that works</li>
<li>If we chose the <em>Western Digital</em> mode and some opaque checks succeed, then switch to <em>Cirrus Logic 542x</em></li>
<li>If we chose the <em>Tseng ET4000</em> mode and some other checks succeed, then switch to <em>Cirrus Logic</em></li>
<li>Save the new mode and chipset name to the <code>SYSTEM.INI</code> file</li>
<li>Call some chipset-specific initialisation code</li>
<li>Check the 'latch capability', whatever that means, and write it to the INI as well</li>
<li>Set the Windows palette</li>
<li>Clear the framebuffer</li>
<li>Set up the VDD</li>
</ol>
<p>Now we're in a good position to ask - how does this interact with SVGAPatch? This code from Microsoft's driver is written to let them support a few different chipsets. But the point of SVGAPatch is to use the newer VBE standard, and in theory, support any video adapter that's VBE compliant!</p>
<p>This function itself doesn't change, but it's directly adjacent to the stuff that does.</p>
<h2>SVGAPatch's Secret Sauce</h2>
<p>When you run the patcher, it gives you some output that tells you what it's changed. Now I know what all the relevant code does.</p>
<pre><code>Segment 3: addr=3AA0, size=917
Segment patched at offset 37E
Segment patched at offset 3D5
Segment patched at offset 42C
Segment patched at offset 481
Segment 11: addr=15240, size=7CD
Segment patched at offset 0</code></pre>
<p>The first 3 patches are setting the 'special function ID' for the very first chipset in each of the three lists <em>(one for each supported resolution)</em> to 2000.</p>
<p>The one at offset 481 is completely rewriting the <code>SetAndValidateMode</code> function. Finally, the one in Segment 11 is rewriting the chipset-specific functions with IDs 2000 and 2001.</p>

<p>So what's going on here? This patch is actually very simple, but pretty smart.</p>
<table>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Finally, to tie this into <code>physical_enable</code>, the new logic ends up being as follows...</p>
<ol>
<li>Scan through all the supported modes in order, calling <code>SetAndValidateMode</code> for each one</li>
<li>The first one will succeed, so it's picked by default</li>
<li>Since the Function ID was replaced with 2000, the rewritten 'TRIDENT' chipset-specific functions are used</li>
<li>Since the chipset name and mode values are now unused, we see the values for the 'Tseng ET4000' written to <code>SYSTEM.INI</code>, just because it's the first one in the list</li>
</ol>
<p>And with that, we've solved one piece of the puzzle - how SVGAPatch works. But we've still not answered the question: <em>why do DOS prompts cause trouble?</em></p>
<h2>Understanding the Virtual Display Device</h2>
<p>It's time to go down yet another rabbit hole! There is a pretty good explanation of VDDs on the OS/2 Museum blog post that I linked earlier: <a href="https://www.os2museum.com/wp/windows-3-x-vddvga/">Windows 3.x VDDVGA</a></p>
<p>TL;DR: DOS programs are written to expect exclusive access to the computer's hardware (including the video adapter), and Windows cleverly tricks them into talking to virtualised implementations instead.</p>
<p>The author was writing their own display driver and having trouble with DOS prompts <em>(sound familiar?)</em>, and discovered that certain parts of the VGA registers were changing in unexpected ways when the mode changed inside a windowed DOS prompt ... which in <em>theory</em>, should not affect the real VGA adapter, as the GUI is supposed to have control over it.</p>
<p>They also note that a specific <code>DspDrvr_Addresses</code> function (which is located in the VDD and called from the display driver) doesn't actually do what the comments say it does, and that our <code>SVGA256.DRV</code> has special behaviour here.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A corollary is that passing 0FFFFh as the latch byte address to the VDD (something that SVGA256.DRV does) tells VDDVGA.386 that there is no video memory to share. In that situation, VDDVGA.386 does not try any hair-raising schemes to modify the VGA register state behind the display driver’s back.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Huh. <em>(I'll pretend I know what that means.)</em></p>

<p>As with the display driver... the Windows DDK gives us the source code for the VGA VDD, but not for the SVGA one that we're using. So I delved into the SVGA VDD with two goals in mind:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find out what changes Microsoft made in between the VGA VDD and the SVGA VDD
<ul>
<li>Is there chipset-specific behaviour hiding here that needs to be patched for generic VBE support?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Try and learn what the deal is with <code>DspDrvr_Addresses</code></li>
</ol>
<p>I painstakingly mapped out the functions in the VDD,. The majority of them were unchanged, but I did come across some interesting-looking differences, and I learned a lot about how the system works in the process.</p>
<h2>Tangent: The VDD's Architecture</h2>
<p>If we look at <code>VDDCTL.ASM</code>, we see a whole set of interesting entry points to the VDD - some of the more notable ones:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Function</th>
<th>Purpose</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>VDD_Device_Init</code></td>
<td>Set up the System VM (The one that Windows itself runs in)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>VDD_Create_VM</code></td>
<td>Set up another VM (for a DOS application)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>VDD_Set_Device_Focus</code></td>
<td>Called when the active VM is switching</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Just to keep things spicy, there's also a bunch of external entry points in <code>VDDSVC.ASM</code>, and there's custom interrupt handlers in <code>VDDINT.ASM</code>.</p>

<p>Anyway, each VM gets its own instance of a big structure called <code>VDD_CB_Struc</code>, which is defined in <code>VDDDEF.INC</code>. This contains a whole lot of stuff, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Various bitfields with all sorts of flags</li>
<li>A complete mirror of the VGA controller's state</li>
<li>Details of what video memory has been allocated by this particular VM</li>
</ul>
<p>This whole system is impressively complex! There's a large <code>VDDOEM.ASM</code> file dedicated entirely to vendor-specific custom code, which is exactly what I was scared of...but we'll see how far we can get.</p>
<p><code>VDDTIO.ASM</code> has a ton of logic that traps read/write accesses to the various VGA registers. I believe this is used by backgrounded VMs - so the active VM gets direct access, but any VM running in the background will just hit these routines and end up talking to the VDD's simulated VGA adapter.</p>
<hr>
<p>Last but not least, but important here: The real-mode initialisation code found in <code>VDD_Real_init</code> has logic to detect various different VGA adapters, and it enables specific flags for them which get stored in the <code>VDD_TFlags</code> bitfield. These flags, in turn, influence other parts of the VDD's behaviour.</p>
<p>Many of these changes are just to teach the VDD to save, restore and simulate specific registers that only exist on certain adapters.</p>

<p>At this point I was feeling a little unsure about this project. If the VDD's state tracking requires <em>this</em> much micromanagement of the VGA adapter and its vendor-specific quirks, then I might just be fighting a battle that I can't win.</p>
<p>But I figured I could keep going and see if I can learn some more.</p>
<h2>What's the deal with DspDrvr_Addresses?</h2>
<p>There's a number of APIs provided by the VDD to the grabber. In <code>386/INCLUDE/VMDAVGA.INC</code> we see these interesting definitions for new ones:</p>
<pre><code>; New API's for 3.1 display drivers
Private_DspDrvr_1   EQU 0Ah
                .errnz Private_DspDrvr_1 - GRB_Unlock_APP - 1
DspDrvr_Version     EQU 0Bh
DspDrvr_Addresses   EQU 0Ch</code></pre>
<p>And if we look inside <code>386/VDDVGA/VDDSVC.ASM</code>, we see how the VGA VDD handles these:</p>
<pre><code>IFDEF DspDrvrRing0Hack
    cmp cl,Private_DspDrvr_1
    je  VDD_Init_DspDrv_Ring0
ENDIF
    cmp cl, DspDrvr_Version
    je  VDD_SVC_Dsp_Version
    cmp cl, DspDrvr_Addresses
    je  VDD_SVC_Set_Addresses</code></pre>
<p><em>Suspicious.</em> The first one seems to only be used by the IBM 8514 display driver, for a specific implementation of <code>BitBlt</code>. The second one just returns a version number. The third one is what we really care about.</p>
<p>Here's the comments from the VDDVGA implementation:</p>
<pre><code>;******************************************************************************
;
;   VDD_SVC_Set_Addresses
;
;   DESCRIPTION:    This service is called by the display driver BEFORE it
;           does the INT 2Fh to indicate that it knows how to restore
;           its screen.  This service is used to tell us where we
;           can interface with the display driver.
;
;           One of the addresses passed is the location of a byte of
;           video memory that we can safely use to save/restore latches.
;
;           The 2nd address passed is the location of the flag byte
;           used by the display driver to determine the availability
;           and validity of the "save screen bits" area.  The display
;           driver copies portions of the visible screen to non-visible
;           memory to save original contents when dialog boxes or menus

<p>So there's some weirdness going on here. The comment says that <code>DX</code> is reserved and must be 0. Yet, if <code>DX</code> is a non-zero value, this triggers special behaviour that reads from <code>CL</code> (which isn't even documented as being used)!</p>
<p>And this isn't used by any of the drivers in the DDK. Weird.</p>

<p>Broadly the same, but there's a brand new case for where the reserved field is set to 2. Also, the <code>latchBank</code> value is no longer used; the underlying logic in that file has changed quite a bit in ways I don't understand.</p>
<p>If I look at the code in the SVGA256 driver, it calls this function with:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>BX</code> (offset of address in display segment) is 0xFFFF</li>
<li><code>DX</code> (reserved field) is 2, for the new behaviour</li>
<li><code>DS:SI</code> (shadow mem status) is a pointer to a byte, which is not used by SVGA256 anywhere else</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, that's good to know.</p>
<h2>Where do I go from here?</h2>
<p>I hoped that analysing both the driver and the VDD would lead me to something obvious that I could just patch, but this hasn't really happened. The VGA hardware may be older than I am, but that doesn't make it simple to understand :(</p>

<p>So I may have to get my paws dirty and do some debugging. Coming back to the OS/2 Museum blog post again, the author writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First I tried to find out what was even happening. Comparing bad/good VGA register state, I soon enough discovered that the sequencer registers contents changed, switching from chained to planar mode. This would not matter if the driver used the linear framebuffer to access video memory, but for good reasons it uses banking and accesses video memory through the A0000h aperture.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Can I use the same techniques? I don't really know how to debug things like this, but these issues are fully reproducible in DOSBox, so let's give it a shot.</p>
<h2>Examining the Issues in DOSBox</h2>
<p>I'm using DOSBox-X on my ARM MacBook. The version shipped by Homebrew doesn't seem to have debugging functionality, so I grabbed new binaries from their website, and now I get a helpful Debug menu.</p>
<p>There is a <em>Video debug overlay</em> option which adds some cool visualisations of the VGA adapter's state, along with a bit of info.</p>
<p><a rel="lightbox" href="https://wuffs.org/user/pages/02.blog/windows-3x-graphics/dosbox1.png"><img alt="A full-screen DOS prompt in DOSBox. The screen is covered in four swathes of dot characters, and the second line has a bunch of equals signs and letters interspersed with the dots. Debugging info and a visualisation of the active palette is shown by the overlay at the bottom of the window." src="https://wuffs.org/user/pages/02.blog/windows-3x-graphics/dosbox1.png"></a></p>
<p>If I open a full-screen prompt, press Alt+Enter to return to the <em>(broken)</em> GUI and then press Alt+Enter again to full-screen again, I get this mess. Absolutely cooked.</p>
<p>Comparing the silly little annotations, I see the following state changes:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>State</th>
<th>Silly little annotations</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Functional GUI</td>
<td><code>M_LIN8 G800x600&gt;800x600 @00000+100+Dch4</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Functional DOS</td>
<td><code>M_TEXT T80x25&gt;720x400 @00000+050-W</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Broken GUI</td>
<td><code>M_VGA G400x600&gt;400x600 @00000+200-Dch4</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Broken DOS</td>
<td><code>M_TEXT T80x25&gt;720x400 @00000+250-W</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>What does this mean?? Not a clue.</p>
<p>I can definitely see that the state is going haywire, but I don't know who's responsible. Is there something missing in the patched display driver? Is the VDD corrupting the state? Both?</p>
<p>I had one hunch. I'd seen that the VDD has a lot of special behaviours for different cards; is it possible that one of these is unwittingly being activated and playing havoc? Say that the VDD mistakenly thinks I'm using a... oh, I don't know, "Trident" GPU, and tries to write to a Trident-specific register, but that register address does something else entirely in whatever DOSBox is currently emulating.</p>
<p>This <em>could</em> be an issue... but to know for sure, I'd need to figure out how to see what the value of <code>VT_Flags</code> is.</p>
<h2>Viewing Driver Memory</h2>
<p>The DOSBox Debugger has commands that let me view memory, but I had a problem - I didn't know <em>where</em> to look! I have no clue how Windows 3.11 maps memory for drivers, or how to even find that out.</p>
<p>My first idea was to just dump the entire system's memory and do a search for the <code>"VDD     "</code> string which is always present in the VDD's memory. This would've worked, except for the fact that DOSBox-X's <code>MEMDUMP</code> command only works with logical addresses.</p>
<p>So I wound up with the slightly dirty solution of just recompiling DOSBox-X with that command tweaked. Sure enough, I dumped the first 32MB of physical addresses to a file, and I was able to find the driver's flags.</p>
<p>But this turned out to be a red herring. None of the vendor-specific flags are set; at least not in DOSBox. Oh well.</p>
<h2>Analysing VGA Registers</h2>
<p>I'll need to go a bit deeper. As it turns out, there's a whole set of commands I can use in the DOSBox debugger to print out fine details about the VGA state... basically every register.</p>
<p>I recreated the previous scenario and did this. If I compare all the registers between the 'good' and 'bad' full-screen DOS prompts, one thing sticks out: the field that DOSBox internally calls <code>scan_len</code>. This is used to calculate how many bytes to advance between each line on the screen. In the 'good' state it's 40, but in the 'bad' state it's 296.</p>
<p>What actually causes this, though??</p>

<p>This field can be updated in a few ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Writes to the VGA CRTC Offset Register</li>
<li>Writes to the S3 "CR43 Extended Mode" Register</li>
<li>Writes to the S3 "Extended System Control 2" Register</li>
<li>Calls to the VESA Scan Line API <em>(the one used by SVGAPatch's changes!)</em></li>
</ul>
<p>It gets even stranger if I <em>begin</em> with a windowed DOS prompt and look at the <code>scan_len</code> value. On a 'good' GUI, it's 128, but on a 'bad' GUI (after returning to windowed mode), it's 256.</p>
<p>DOSBox's implementation of the VESA API calculates <code>scan_len</code> differently based on what it thinks the current video mode is. This is pretty suspicious.</p>
<hr>
<p>Since I'd already gone ahead and recompiled DOSBox myself, I figured I'd go further and just throw in some logging.</p>
<pre><code>    LOG_MSG("VESA_ScanLineLength(subcall=%d, val=%d, bytes=%d, pixels=%d, lines=%d)\n", subcall, val, bytes, pixels, lines);
    LOG_MSG("  Current Mode: %s\n", mode_texts[CurMode-&gt;type]);</code></pre>
<p>And this gives me a smoking gun...!</p>
<pre><code>VESA_ScanLineLength(subcall=2, val=1024, bytes=2, pixels=1024, lines=4768)
  Current Mode: M_TEXT</code></pre>
<p>The display driver is calling <a href="http://www.ctyme.com/intr/rb-0280.htm">VBE operation <code>4F06h</code></a> to set the scan line length to 1024 bytes, but DOSBox thinks we're in text mode, so the resulting field is wrong.</p>
<p>The obvious next step is to add logging for video mode changes. This is a little more annoying than it seems, because there's a few ways this can occur. To be thorough, I decide to add log messages to all of them.</p>
<p>This finally lets me assemble a crude timeline of events.</p>
<ul>
<li>Start Windows
<ul>
<li><code>M_TEXT</code> -&gt; Mode 12h (640x480 VGA)</li>
<li><code>M_EGA</code> -&gt; Mode 10h (640x350 EGA)</li>
<li><code>M_EGA</code> -&gt; Mode 3 (80x25 text)</li>
<li><code>M_TEXT</code> -&gt; Mode 103h (800x600 SVGA)</li>
<li>ScanLineLength called: 1024 bytes, with the current mode being <code>M_LIN8</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>So far so good</strong> - we have a working desktop now</li>
<li>I open a full-screen DOS prompt
<ul>
<li><code>M_TEXT</code> -&gt; Mode 3 (80x25 text)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>So far so good</strong> - we have a working prompt, no anomalies</li>
<li>I press Alt+Enter to return to windowed mode
<ul>
<li><code>M_TEXT</code> -&gt; Mode 30h (... what?!)</li>
<li>ScanLineLength called: 1024 bytes, with the current mode being <code>M_TEXT</code></li>
<li>Now the debugger says we're in mode <code>M_VGA</code>?!</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>scan_len</code> is now corrupted, along with our display</li>
</ul>

<p>There's three things going on here that we need to unpack:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Something</em> is asking for a mode switch to 30h (or decimal 48), which doesn't work as that is not a supported mode.</li>
<li>The patched display driver tries to set the scanline length, but this corrupts the state because we're in text mode</li>
<li>Yet we somehow end up in a graphics mode, without a switch?? What???</li>
</ol>
<p>DOSBox has a global variable called <code>CurMode</code> which is updated every time the video mode changes through a call to <code>INT 10h</code> - either with the legacy video mode call from the IBM PC days, or the <em>slightly</em> more modern VESA/VBE API.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the debugger's <code>VGA MODE</code> command (which is what I'm using to introspect the state) is reading from DOSBox's <code>vga.mode</code>, which is a more low-level field in the display engine. This is computed from VGA registers.</p>
<p>So... I think this is the fault of the VDD! It's doing its thing and dutifully saving/restoring registers behind the scenes, but this leaves us out of sync when we try to use the higher-level VBE interface.</p>
<hr>
<p>What about point 1? Who is trying to set the video mode to the invalid 30h, and why?</p>
<p>Well, this comes back to where we began. SVGAPatch hijacks the entries used by the Microsoft driver for the <em>Tseng ET4000</em> chipset. For a resolution of 800x600, it uses the Tseng-specific mode 30h.</p>
<p>Lo and behold, if we look for calls to <code>INT 10h</code> in our patched display driver, we find a function that calls it.</p>
<p>So the VBE patch really <em>is</em> incomplete after all... 🤔</p>
<h2>Fixing the Patch</h2>
<p>I didn't want to just replace this function, I also wanted to understand how it fits into the whole system. So it's time to analyse how Windows 3.1 tells the driver about screen switches! Thankfully, this code is all present in the DDK's VGA driver, so that helps a lot.</p>
<h2>Screen Switching</h2>
<p>When the display driver is enabled, the <code>hook_int_2F</code> routine (from <code>SSWITCH.ASM</code>) is called. This gets pointers to a couple of functions from Windows DLLs, and also hooks the handler for <code>INT 2Fh</code>.</p>
<p>Remember, <code>2Fh</code> is the 'Multiplex' interrupt, which lots of software can piggyback on. If a program wants to hook it, it has to store the address of the <strong>previous</strong> handler, and then call it for any requests that it didn't handle. This effectively creates a chain of hooks, eventually ending at whatever default was assigned by MS-DOS on boot.</p>
<p>This driver is no exception. The hook it uses is called <code>screen_switch_hook</code>.</p>

<p>The VGA driver is able to <strong>receive</strong> four commands via <code>INT 2Fh</code>, which are crudely documented as follows in the DDK:</p>
<pre><code>SCREEN_SWITCH_OUT equ   4001h       ;Moving 3xBox to background
SCREEN_SWITCH_IN  equ   4002h       ;Moving 3xBox to foreground
SAVE_DEV_REGS   equ 4005h       ;int 2f code to save registers
RES_DEV_REGS    equ     4006h       ;int 2f code to restore registers</code></pre>
<p>...but interestingly, only the two <code>SCREEN_SWITCH_x</code> commands are supported by the SVGA256 driver.</p>
<p>Anyway, both of these call three routines in order. For the <code>OUT</code> command, it's <code>pre_switch_to_background</code>, <code>dev_to_background</code>, and then <code>post_switch_to_background</code>. For the <code>IN</code> command, it's the same, but with <code>_to_foreground</code> routines instead.</p>
<p>All of these are pretty basic, except for <code>dev_to_foreground</code>, which is the one called when you switch back to Windows itself.</p>
<hr>
<p>In the VGA driver's code (<code>286/DISPLAY/4PLANE/3XSWITCH.ASM</code>), <code>dev_to_foreground</code> is pretty simple - it calls <code>INT 10h</code> with <code>ax=1002h</code> to <a href="http://www.ctyme.com/intr/rb-0116.htm">reset all the palette registers</a>, then calls <code>init_hw_regs</code> to... set some stuff that I don't really get.</p>
<p>In the Video 7 driver's code from the DDK (<code>286/DISPLAY/8PLANE/V7VGA/SRC/3XSWITCH.ASM</code>), it's a bit spicier:</p>
<ul>
<li>Calls <code>farsetmode</code>, which:
<ul>
<li>Sets the display mode</li>
<li>Enables Video 7 VGA extensions</li>
<li>Sets the line length</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Calls <code>far_set_dacsize</code> to set the DAC mode, whatever that means</li>
<li>Calls <code>setramdac</code> to program the palette</li>
<li>Calls its own version of <code>init_hw_regs</code></li>
<li>Sets <code>enabled_flag</code> to 0xFF</li>
<li>Calls <code>far_set_cursor_addr</code></li>
</ul>
<p>So after looking at these, what do we see in the problematic SVGA256 driver?</p>
<ul>
<li>Calls <code>farsetmode</code>, which:
<ul>
<li>Sets the display mode to 48 (!!)</li>
<li>Calls the chipset-specific VideoInit routine</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Sets <code>enabled_flag</code> to 0xFF</li>
<li>Calls the Windows API's <code>SetPalette</code> to set the palette</li>
</ul>
<p>Herein lies our problem! There are <strong>two</strong> places where the video mode gets set, and SVGAPatch missed this one. It <em>does</em> call the VideoInit routine, so it uses the patched code to set the scanline length, but without being in the right video mode, it won't actually give us the right result.</p>
<h2>Can we fix it?</h2>
<p>Hopefully!</p>
<p>The original code just looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>mov ax, [wGraphicsMode]
int 10h
call [ptr_videoinit]
retn</code></pre>
<p>There's not much room to work with, but luckily, this is right after <code>SetAndValidateMode</code>, a function that was replaced by SVGAPatch with a much shorter version. So, I take the first byte right after the end of the new <code>SetAndValidateMode</code>, and inject some new assembly:</p>
<pre><code>mov cx, [CurrentHeight]
dec cx
call SetAndValidateMode
call ptr_videoinit
retn</code></pre>
<p>Since <code>SetAndValidateMode</code> expects <code>cx</code> to contain the screen height (minus 1), I do that. Then I replace the first instruction of <code>setmode</code> with a simple <code>jmp</code> to my new code.</p>
<p><a rel="lightbox" href="https://wuffs.org/user/pages/02.blog/windows-3x-graphics/dosbox2.png"><img alt="Screenshot showing a functional Windows 3.11 desktop in DOSBox, with a DOS prompt in a window. I've typed in &quot;echo I'm in full screen :)&quot;, followed by &quot;echo now I'm in windowed mode!&quot;" src="https://wuffs.org/user/pages/02.blog/windows-3x-graphics/dosbox2.png"></a></p>
<p>Lo and behold... the GUI no longer gets trashed after entering a full-screen DOS session!</p>
<p>One issue remains, though. If I go from windowed mode to full screen, the dots come back.</p>
<h2>Register Debugging (Again)</h2>
<p>I've tried to use my previous trick where I invoke all the DOSBox VGA debug commands to dump the state and I compare them, but this time I'm not getting anything useful.</p>
<p>Why am I getting nonsense? If I enter <code>DP B8000</code> into the DOSBox debugger console to look at the VGA memory, I see that the text is all there - it's just not showing up!</p>
<p>There is an interesting DOSBox debug feature that lets you enter a command like <code>VGA DS START 2</code> to override the VGA base address, and if I do this, it shifts the garbage around, but it's still the same garbage.</p>

<p>So then I thought... I know that the driver uses banking, so that it can access more video memory than is available with ye olde VGA. When it needs to read or write something outwith the range it currently sees, it'll call the SetBank function (which was patched by SVGAPatch) to ask for that window to be moved. Is this the problem?</p>
<p>Turns out, the bank configuration is stored in a separate structure that isn't covered by any of the debug commands. I add a quick and dirty command to dump these, and recompile DOSBox yet again.</p>
<pre><code>        else if (command == "SVGA") {
            DEBUG_ShowMsg("VGA SVGA data: bankMask=%lu read_full=%lu write_full=%lu read=%u write=%u size=%lu",
            (unsigned long)vga.svga.bankMask,
            (unsigned long)vga.svga.bank_read_full,
            (unsigned long)vga.svga.bank_write_full,
            vga.svga.bank_read,
            vga.svga.bank_write,
            (unsigned long)vga.svga.bank_size
            );
        }</code></pre>
<p>Sure enough, when I return to full screen mode, the VGA adapter is stuck on the wrong bank!</p>
<h2>Can we fix it? Again??</h2>
<p>I've now gotten to the point in writing up this post where I've written about all the stuff I've done, and I haven't actually attempted to fix this yet. But you know what... screw it, I may as well try.</p>
<p>We've seen <code>dev_to_foreground</code>, which called <code>farsetmode</code>, which jumped to <code>setmode</code>, and fixing <em>that</em> made the GUI work. So, what if I modify <code>dev_to_background</code> to reset the bank to 0 as we're leaving the GUI?</p>
<p>All we've got in that routine right now is a simple <code>mov [enabled_flag], 0</code>. I've still got a bunch of free space over next to my silly little kludge... but it's in the wrong segment. If I want to add a new cross-segment call, I'll need to mess with the executable structure, and I honestly cannot be bothered.</p>

<p>So I spent a while trying to find something in the first segment that I could hack to shreds. Eventually I settled on the implementation of <code>GetDriverResourceID</code>, which is a function that's only used for the 120dpi ("Large Fonts") configuration.</p>
<p>First I need to bring it down to its simplest possible form:</p>
<pre><code>push bp
mov bp, sp
mov ax, [bp+0Ah]
pop bp
retf 6</code></pre>
<p>This now leaves me a bit of space to write a new bank resetting routine, which should force the video adapter back to bank 0:</p>
<pre><code>mov [ds:enabled_flag], 0
xor dx, dx
call set_bank_select
retn</code></pre>
<p>And finally, I jump to it from <code>dev_to_background</code>, so that it'll be called when I leave the GUI.</p>

<p>So with great trepidation, I try to run it, and... the OS doesn't crash! But it doesn't fix the issue, either :(</p>
<p>After a bunch of painstaking <code>printf</code> debugging I find out why... DOSBox implements  <a href="http://www.ctyme.com/intr/rb-0278.htm">VBE operation <code>4F05h</code></a> (to set the 'bank') by writing to the VGA CRTC register 0x6A. I'm doing it from <code>dev_to_background</code>, but that routine is called too late - by that point, we've already switched away, and the VDD is trapping our writes.</p>
<p>This doesn't align with what I see in the Windows DDK's documentation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Interrupt 2Fh Function 4001h</p>
<pre><code>mov ax, 4001h   ; Notify Background Switch
int 2fh</code></pre>
<p>Notify Background Switch notifies a VM application that it is being switched to the background. The VM application can carry out any actions, but should do so within 1000ms. This is the amount of time the system waits before switching the application.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have two options:</p>
<ol>
<li>I somehow find a way to trigger this earlier in the switching process
<ul>
<li>Would be nice, but I clearly can't believe the docs, and I don't really want to try and disassemble more of Windows.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>I teach the VDD to let me pass these writes through, as Microsoft did for all the SVGA adapters they officially supported
<ul>
<li>This would fix it for DOSBox, but that fix would be tied to whichever video adapter it's emulating. I don't want that, I'm trying to make the generic VBE patch work better!</li>
<li>It's unlikely that my Eee PC's Intel GMA950 <em>also</em> uses CRTC register 0x6A for banks.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>At this point, you know what... I think I'm done. It's almost midnight and I have to return to my day job tomorrow. (The Java™ cannot wait.)</p>
<h2>... What now?</h2>
<p>This was a fun little endeavour, and I've gotten surprisingly far, but I don't want to invest much more time into it - it's just something I wanted to poke at over the holiday season.</p>

<p>You know how brittle this whole setup is? Just for fun, let's go back to the <em>original</em> SVGA 256-colour driver from Microsoft, and its list of supported cards... and let's use 86Box to try out a few.</p>

<p>I should caveat this with the fact that 86Box doesn't have some of the exact same cards, so that might lead to issues, and I don't know how accurate the emulation is for all of them. Still, this suggests that even the original support was already kind of dodgy - so I won't be too sad about not being able to make it perfect myself.</p>

<p>I also picked some of the newer cards in 86Box and tried them with my patched version of the patched driver, to see what would happen --</p>

<p>Last but not least... I'm sure you're dying to know, how far did I get with the Eee PC after all this faffery? The GUI works fine. Switching to a full-screen DOS prompt breaks, but in an interestingly different way to DOSBox. While on DOSBox I get text mode with lots of corrupted characters, on the Eee PC I get a broken version of the GUI where some of the colours have disappeared.</p>
<p><a rel="lightbox" href="https://wuffs.org/user/pages/02.blog/windows-3x-graphics/solitaire.jpg"><img alt="Picture of Windows on the Eee PC, with Program Manager and Solitaire open. All the Solitaire cards have turned white and many of the colours on the screen have become white or grey (but the Solitaire green background remains). The top fifth of the screen has vertical lines running across it." src="https://wuffs.org/user/pages/02.blog/windows-3x-graphics/solitaire.jpg"></a></p>
<p>However, the saving grace is that you can just switch to windowed mode again and it recovers OK.</p>

<p>If you think that looks cool, then here's a fun one I got when I was messing around with the text mode blue screen that you get when you press Ctrl+Alt+Del - somehow I got it to corrupt the VM's video memory, and the results stuck around enough to get rendered at glorious 1024x600 by the Grabber.</p>

<p>And you know what - glitch art aside... my updated driver may not be <em>perfect</em>, but it's already a huge improvement over the original SVGAPatch, where simply opening a prompt (even in a window) would break the entire GUI and require me to restart the OS. I'll take that W. </p>
<p>For anything better than that, I'll continue to keep an eye on <a href="https://github.com/PluMGMK/vbesvga.drv">PluMGMK/vbesvga.drv</a>, which is being actively developed and written by someone that actually knows what they're doing when it comes to 16-bit PC dev and video hardware.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoyed this adventure :3 I had fun, but I'm definitely ready to move onto something else now. Maybe I'll even write the post I originally planned on writing, about how to set up Windows 3.x and 9x on the Eee PC. <em>Maybe.</em></p>
