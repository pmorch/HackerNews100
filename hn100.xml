<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Following the publishing of the Mixtral family, Codestral Mamba is another step in our effort to study and provide new architectures. It is available for free use, modification, and distribution, and we hope it will open new perspectives in architecture research. Codestral Mamba was designed with help from Albert Gu and Tri Dao.</p><p>Unlike Transformer models, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00752">Mamba models</a> offer the advantage of linear time inference and the theoretical ability to model sequences of infinite length. It allows users to engage with the model extensively with quick responses, irrespective of the input length. This efficiency is especially relevant for code productivity use cases—this is why we trained this model with advanced code and reasoning capabilities, enabling it to perform on par with SOTA transformer-based models.</p><p><img src="https://mistral.ai/images/news/codestral-mamba/codestral-mamba-benchmarks.png" alt="Detailed Codestral Mamba benchmarks" width="100%"></p><p>We have tested Codestral Mamba on in-context retrieval capabilities up to 256k tokens. We expect it to be a great local code assistant!</p><p>You can deploy Codestral Mamba using the <a href="https://github.com/mistralai/mistral-inference">mistral-inference</a> SDK, which relies on the reference implementations from Mamba’s GitHub repository. The model can also be deployed through <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM/tree/main/examples/mamba">TensorRT-LLM</a>. For local inference, keep an eye out for support in llama.cpp. You may download the raw weights from <a href="https://huggingface.co/mistralai/mamba-codestral-7B-v0.1">HuggingFace</a>.</p><p>For easy testing, we made Codestral Mamba available on <a href="https://console.mistral.ai/">la Plateforme</a> (<code>codestral-mamba-2407</code>), alongside its big sister, Codestral 22B. While Codestral Mamba is available under the Apache 2.0 license, Codestral 22B is available under a <a href="https://mistral.ai/contact/">commercial license</a> for self-deployment or a community license for testing purposes.</p><p><strong>Important:</strong> This is an instructed model, with 7,285,403,648 parameters.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>We are in the third golden age of AI.</p>
<p>In the previous two golden ages (1950s-1960s and the 1980s),
our expectations outpaced the capabilities of the technology at the time, leading to disappointment.
In contrast, the AI technology of the current golden age, which began in the mid-2010s, has consistently exceeded our expectations.</p>
<p>Among AI technologies, the Transformer, introduced in 2017, stands as a groundbreaking breakthrough.
Initially developed as a machine translation model, its impact has extended to permeate nearly every field.
Today, the Transformer model is considered essential knowledge for modern engineers.</p>
<p>The first goal of this document is to provide the shortest path for engineers to understand the Transformer.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p>Peter Buxtun, the whistleblower who revealed that the US government allowed hundreds of Black men in rural <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/alabama" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Alabama</a> to go untreated for syphilis in what became known as the Tuskegee study, has died. He was 86.</p><p>Buxtun died on 18 May of Alzheimer’s disease in Rocklin, California, according to his attorney, Minna Fernan.</p><p>Buxtun is revered as a hero to public health scholars and ethicists for his role in bringing to light the most notorious medical research scandal in US history. Documents that Buxtun provided to the Associated Press, and its subsequent investigation and reporting, led to a public outcry that ended the study in 1972.</p><p>Forty years earlier, in 1932, federal scientists began studying 400 Black men in Tuskegee, Alabama, who were infected with syphilis. When antibiotics became available in the 1940s that could treat the disease, federal health officials ordered that the drugs be withheld. The study became an observation of how the disease ravaged the body over time.</p><p>In the mid-1960s, Buxtun was a federal public health employee working in San Francisco when he overheard a co-worker talking about the study. The research was not exactly a secret – about a dozen medical journal articles about it had been published in the previous 20 years. But hardly anyone had raised any concerns about how the experiment was being conducted.</p><p>“This study was completely accepted by the American medical community,” said Ted Pestorius of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, speaking at a 2022 program marking the 50th anniversary of the end of the study.</p><p>Buxtun had a different reaction. After learning more about the study, he raised ethical concerns in a 1966 letter to officials at the CDC. In 1967, he was summoned to a meeting in Atlanta, where he was chewed out by agency officials for what they deemed to be impertinence. Repeatedly, agency leaders rejected his complaints and his call for the men in Tuskegee to be treated.</p><p>He left the US Public Health Service and attended law school, but the study ate at him. In 1972, he provided documents about the research to Edith Lederer, an AP reporter he had met in San Francisco. Lederer passed the documents to the AP investigative reporter Jean Heller, telling her colleague: “I think there might be something here.”</p><p>Heller’s story was published on 25 July 1972, leading to congressional hearings, a class-action lawsuit that resulted in a $10m settlement and the study’s termination about four months later. In 1997, President Bill Clinton formally apologized for the study, calling it “shameful”.</p><p>The leader of a group dedicated to the memory of the study participants said on Monday they were grateful to Buxtun for exposing the experiment.</p><p>“We are thankful for his honesty and his courage,” said Lille Tyson Head, whose father was in the study.</p><p>Buxtun was born in Prague in 1937. His father was Jewish, and his family immigrated to the US in 1939 from Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia, eventually settling in Irish Bend, Oregon, on the Columbia River.</p><p>In his complaints to federal health officials, he drew comparisons between the Tuskegee study and medical experiments Nazi doctors had conducted on Jews and other prisoners. Federal scientists did not believe they were guilty of the same kind of moral and ethical sins, but after the Tuskegee study was exposed, the government put in place new rules about how it conducts medical research. Today, the study is often blamed for the unwillingness of some African Americans to participate in medical research.</p><p>“Peter’s life experiences led him to immediately identify the study as morally indefensible and to seek justice in the form of treatment for the men. Ultimately, he could not relent,” said the CDC’s Pestorius.</p><p>Buxtun attended the University of Oregon, served in the US army as a combat medic and psychiatric social worker and joined the federal health service in 1965.</p><p>Buxtun went on to write, give presentations and win awards for his involvement in the Tuskegee study. A global traveler, he collected and sold antiques, especially military weapons and swords and gambling equipment from California’s gold rush era.</p><p>He also spent more than 20 years trying to recover his family’s properties confiscated by the Nazis and was partly successful.</p><p>“Peter was wise, witty, classy and unceasingly generous,” said David M Golden, a close friend of Buxtun’s for over 25 years. “He was a staunch advocate for personal freedoms and spoke often against prohibition, whether it be drugs, prostitution or firearms.”</p><p>Another longtime friend Angie Bailie said she attended many of Buxtun’s presentations about Tuskegee.</p><p>“Peter never ended a single talk without fighting back tears,” she said</p><p>Buxtun himself could be self-effacing about his actions, saying he did not anticipate the vitriolic reaction of some health officials when he started questioning the study’s ethics.</p><p>At a Johns Hopkins University forum in 2018, Buxtun was asked where he got the moral strength to blow the whistle.</p><p>“It wasn’t strength,” he said. “It was stupidity.”</p></div></div>]]></description>

  <h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>I bought a Surface Pro 4 at 2016. It has an Intel Core m3-6Y30 CPU and 4GB memory. The spec is not that impressive even compared to an average laptop released years earlier. On the other hand, the form factor is very attractive to me: at a very low price, you get a tablet with a beautiful HiDPI 2k screen, a pressure sensitive stylus and an useable keyboard. It is on the heavier side if used as a tablet, but compared to other laptops, it’s very light. It served me very well for my limited use cases. The blog <a href="https://www.binwang.me/2016-11-28-Config-Development-Environment-on-Windows.html">Build a Unix Like Environment on Windows</a> was written at that era. Some years later, I bought a more powerful laptop when I needed to work while traveling. So I gave the Surface away to a family member.</p>

<p>However, during the past years, I couldn’t stop thinking about having a Linux tablet. At first I checked <a href="https://pine64.org/devices/pinetab/">Pinetab</a>, then I realized I had a Surface which would be perfect if I could install Linux on it. I searched online and found some successful stories. So when I <a href="https://www.binwang.me/2024-03-19-Travel-Back-to-China.html">travelled back to my hometown</a> at the beginning of this year, I brought the Surface back with me and started to experiment with it.</p>

<h2 id="use-cases">Use Cases</h2>

<p>Before I go further, I need to mention my intended use cases:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Browse Internet. Mainly <a href="https://www.rssbrain.com/">RSS Brain</a>, the RSS reader I built by myself.</li>
  <li>Media consumption: watch videos from my Samba share and online websites like Youtube.</li>
  <li>PDF reading: reading only is enough for me but it’s better if I can take notes in the PDF.</li>
  <li>Sketches: I don’t have a habit to do handwriting notes even at students era. Nowadays it’s more efficient and readable/searchable to take text notes with Markdown. However, I do like drawing sketches on paper when brain storming or resolving some hard problem. Moving it to digital has a lot of benefits if it works.</li>
  <li>Drawing: this is a good to have feature. I don’t really have needs to draw things but it’s always fun. Especially with the development of AI, if I draw something and send it to a more powerful machine to generate images, it could open doors to many possibilities.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>

<p>The installation of Linux is actually very easy. I tried two distros and the installation process went very smooth for both of them. The distros I tried are <a href="https://endeavouros.com/">EndeavourOS</a> and Fedora workstation 40.</p>

<p>The installation steps are well documented in <a href="https://github.com/linux-surface/linux-surface/wiki/Installation-and-Setup#installation">linux-surface’s wiki</a>. <a href="https://github.com/linux-surface/linux-surface">linux-surface</a> is the Linux kernel and tools for Surface devices. The wiki page has its installation steps as well.</p>

<p>In general, if only used as a laptop, the experience is almost perfect even without the linux-surface kernel. But using it as a tablet is another story.</p>

<h2 id="what-works">What Works</h2>

<p>Let’s talk about what works first. Even without linux-surface kernel, almost everything works except touch screen and stylus. That includes things like wireless network, bluetooth, keyboard, power profile, UI scaling for Hi-DPI and so on. Multi touch and pressure sensitive stylus works as well (sort of, see sections below) after installed linux-surface kernel. Battery life is good enough: about 5-6 hours of light usage like web browsing, PDF reading, and about 3 hours of video watching. (Just some estimated time from my experience, no serious benchmarking was done).</p>

<p>On the software side, automatic screen rotation is enabled on both distros I tried. KDE with EndeavourOS is very fast and responsive. When the keyboard is detached, it enters tablet mode which makes some UI larger and more user friendly with touch gestures. For example, you can just touch on a folder to open it in Dolphin instead of double click it.</p>

<p>For Gnome, it’s less responsive than KDE but the UI is really beautiful when used as a tablet. I was never a fan after Gnome 3 but I guess the UI changes it made makes more sense on a tablet than on a laptop or a desktop. The overall layout really reminds you about the iPad or Android tablet (in a good way), but with the power of a real desktop OS at the same time. I would really like it if it uses less resource.</p>

<p>Even though the overall experience is positive and has the potential to meet all my use cases, one serious problem made it very unusable and made me gave up Linux on Surface at the end.</p>

<h2 id="the-problems-in-both-distros">The Problems in Both Distros</h2>

<p>The deal breaker problem is touch recognition. The problem is in the surface-linux tools so it affects all the distros. The biggest problem is ghost touch: touches are registered randomly even when I do nothing. I tried a lot of workarounds including the ones mentioned in <a href="https://github.com/linux-surface/linux-surface/wiki/Surface-Pro-5">linux-surface’s wiki page</a>, but none of them actually resolved it completely. Sometimes it’s fixed after reboot but reappeared after next reboot. Sometimes it get fixed for a period of time but reappeared after a system upgrade. Sometimes the touch screen doesn’t work at all after resume from sleep. The randomness and the serious of the problem is really annoying so I gave up using it with Linux at last.</p>

<p>Other than the ghost touching, another big problem about touch recognition is palm rejection. It’s really annoying when draw things with the pen. In iptsd (surface-linux’s deamon for touch recognition), there is a configuration to disable touch screen when using a pen but it doesn’t work well. So it makes drawing very unusable.</p>

<p>Both KDE and Gnome has virtual keyboards when the physical keyboard is detached, and works most of the time despite the problems I’ll mention in the following sections. But if you have setup disk encryption with a password, there is no virtual keyboard when you input the disk password, so a physical keyboard is always needed during the boot. Which can be annoying but not really a deal breaker.</p>

<p>The last big problem is battery drain during sleep. It uses about 30% battery for one night even it has been put into sleep. I had similar issues for other laptops. I believe there maybe some configurations I can tune to fix that. But after I gave up Linux on it because of the ghost touch, I didn’t dig deeper into that.</p>

<p>Other than the problems shared by both distros, each distro/desktop environment also has their own problems.</p>

<h2 id="the-problems-in-kde-with-endeavouros">The Problems in KDE with EndeavourOS</h2>

<p>The biggest problem in KDE other than the ones I talked above, is the virtual keyboard. It’s buggy and not very stable. Sometimes it kept pop up and sometimes it doesn’t show up. It’s annoying especially at the login screen: if it’s not popped up you will still need a physical keyboard, which prevent it to be a real tablet. Sometimes when the keyboard is popped up, the panel at the bottom cannot be touched. The bugs happened randomly that makes it hard to be properly reported.</p>

<p>Another problem is the touch gesture for right click. Naturally, with a touch screen, long press should be treated like a right click. But that is not the case for KDE. So a lot of operations just cannot be done without a mouse when you need a right click.</p>

<p>Resize a window is also very tricky with touch only operation: you need to touch on the boarder precisely on the first try.</p>

<p>At last, the scroll behaviour is not very smooth. It makes me a little bit dizzy just by scrolling through web pages and PDFs.</p>

<p>So I thought give another distro and desktop environment a try, to see if they can resolve my problems.</p>

<h2 id="the-problems-in-gnome-with-fedora-workstation-40">The Problems in Gnome with Fedora Workstation 40</h2>

<p>I choose Fedora because it comes with Gnome, and I had good experience with it before. After the installation, the first impression is it’s much slower than KDE with EndeavourOS. I found it enables swap and ZRam by default so I disabled them. It’s better but still slower than KDE. It uses more memory at around 40-50% percentage while idel. And I got a lot of OOM kills which almost never happened with KDE on EndeavourOS.</p>

<p>Maybe because of the slowness, it’s also buggy for lots of operations. For example, when switch to the workspace view from PDF viewer with 4 fingers swipe up, the PDF keeps scrolling at the background. And when scroll in the file manager, the context menu keeps popping up.</p>

<p>Other than the slowness, there is a problem on the virtual keyboard as well: the backspace key doesn’t work properly. I found a workaround by install a third-party Gnome addon, but sometimes the old keyboard still popped up.</p>

<h2 id="go-back-to-windows-10">Go Back to Windows 10</h2>

<p>I’d say if the touch recognition works well enough, all the other problems are acceptable with KDE. But with those problems, I finally decided to fallback to Windows 10 again. It works well enough, just as I remembered from years ago. However I abandoned OneNotes and some other Microsoft products and use the following software instead:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Firefox as the browser.</li>
  <li>Nextcloud to sync the files.</li>
  <li>Samba for video sharing.</li>
  <li>Built in video player for local video playing.</li>
  <li>Krita for drawing and sketches.</li>
  <li>Drawboard PDF for PDF reading.</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s pretty disappointing that this device cannot be used with Linux properly. But using Windows is still better to just let the device sitting there doing nothing. Maybe I will re-evaluate it after Windows 10 is end of life next year.</p>

										<p>A few weeks before the release of my first book, a memoir about my mother’s murder, I had to take a polygraph exam. The two things were not in fact related, but that was easy to forget once I found myself strapped in a chair in a windowless room on the fourth floor of a federal building in El Paso, with some polygrapher I’d just met sitting behind me, asking questions.</p><p><span>Article continues below</span></p>
<p>I’d met my examiner, whom I’ll call Kevin, that morning. The federal scheduler had insisted on a 9:00 am appointment even though I lived four hours away, which meant I’d spent the previous night alone in a Motel 6 by the highway in El Paso, eating Del Taco and reflecting on the decisions that had led me to spending the night alone in a Motel 6 by the highway in El Paso, eating Del Taco. Technically, I was there because I’d applied for a job with Customs and Border Protection. But the truth seemed much more complicated than that.</p>
<p>I didn’t get much sleep, and showed up at the federal building early, dressed in what I imagined the government meant by comfortable clothing: black dress pants, plain white oxford, no tie. I looked like a banquet waiter. One other guy was in the waiting room when I walked in. As we sat there past the scheduled time of our appointments, we struck up a desultory conversation. Like me, he’d been in the hiring process for years, had driven down from Albuquerque the night before, and seemed nervous. He asked if I’d done any research on the polygraph. I said no, and asked him the same question. He said no. We were getting our first lies out of the way.</p>
<p><span>The lie detector was like any true story in America: the facts didn’t matter as long as a lot of people believed it. </span></p><p>The government’s guidelines had repeatedly stressed that we should not do any research before our polygraph. Their insistence struck me as odd: if the machine detects lies, why would it matter? I’d spent much of the previous week Googling polygraphs. I was in the middle of denying it to my new friend when the door opened and Kevin appeared.</p>
<p>He was around sixty, short, portly, bald, with a silly goatee and wire-rimmed glasses, wearing a baggy gray suit and a shirt in one of those colors I never can keep straight, puce or mauve or periwinkle, a little too festive for the occasion. Kevin was squinty and smug, with an air of hollow authority that reminded me of my middle-school principal. He didn’t even step into the waiting room, just swung the door open and shouted my full name. I stood and shook the hand he extended. He squeezed too hard and said I could call him by his first name, as if he were doing me some great favor.</p>
<p>Kevin led me down a drab hallway to a door on the left that led to my first disappointment. I’d been expecting the sort of tableau you see in cop movies, some dank cellar with a dangling bulb and a two-way mirror on the wall for me to stare defiantly into. Instead we entered a bare, sterile room with office chairs on either side of a desk. Wires ran from the computer on the desk across the room to a hard-backed chair festooned with cuffs and straps and sensors.</p>
<p>We sat in the normal chairs. Kevin leaned back in his, twirled a pencil, and said, “Let’s get started.” I knew this bit, the casual tone and performative warmth. I was a college professor, sort of, and I did this same bit on the first day of classes, trying to make my students trust me. In that first fluorescent moment, staring into Kevin’s beady eyes, I had a premonition: I was going to fail my polygraph exam.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Joan Didion once wrote that it’s easy to see the beginnings of things, and harder to see the ends. That has not been my experience. Ends are obvious: divorce, death, getting fired. Beginnings, on the other hand, seem subjective. If ends are facts, beginnings are truth: relative, random, subject to belief.</p>
<p>The story of my exam, for example, could begin two years before I met Kevin, when President Obama signed an act requiring polygraph screening for applicants to certain federal agencies. Or two years before that, when I started writing a memoir and began to understand what it means to tell the truth. Or it could begin with the polygraph itself, the kind of story America likes best: a simple one that isn’t all that true. The polygraph’s most commonly credited inventor is John Larson, an employee of the Berkeley Police Department, who developed a new device for interrogations in 1921. Larson was twenty-nine at the time, and, like me, a strange candidate for law enforcement: he might have been America’s first cop with a PhD.</p>
<p>His degree was in physiology, the science of the body’s systems. The then-prevailing scientific belief saw crime as biological, either hereditary or the result of a physical defect. Larson explored both possibilities. His undergraduate work tried to find familial patterns in fingerprints that predicted criminality. In grad school, Larson shifted his focus to thyroid deficiencies. The results were disappointing, so he turned to machines. Larson read an article about using blood pressure to detect deception, and decided to improve on its author’s technique by designing a machine that could do so more objectively. The polygraph was born.</p>
<p>The truer story is, as usual, more complicated. Larson’s machine was not so much an invention as it was an amalgam of existing devices. He didn’t believe it detected lies and didn’t call it a polygraph: Larson referred to his machine as an “emotion recorder.” His protégé and rival, Leonarde Keeler, would later come up with the term polygraph to help commercialize the device.</p>
<p>Polygraph organizations like to say the word means “many writings,” which is halfway true. It’s a neologist portmanteau of the Greek terms meaning exactly that, and the machine does indeed create many writings. But to claim the word means only and exactly one thing is to make the same mistake with language polygraphers habitually make with facts: believing that they’re static and absolute. Language, like truth, is neither. Words evolve and change over time and mean different things in different contexts. Polygraph has six different definitions, according to the <em>Oxford English Dictionary</em>—three of which predate the machine—and they range from a letter grouping in cryptography to a person imitating another to a writer of various works. (Which I guess makes this an essay about a polygraph taking a polygraph.)</p>
<p>More to the point, polygraph does not mean “lie detector.” Larson himself repudiated that term for the rest of his life. But that fact didn’t get in the way of a good story. Once the polygraph was adopted by police across America and heralded in the popular media, it took on a mythical new name: the lie detector. And as soon as the lie detector became famous, a bunch of men fought with each other for decades—mostly in their memoirs—over who was its true inventor. In his book <em>The Truth Machine: A Social History of the Lie Detector</em>, Geoffrey C. Bunn devotes an entire chapter to the question of who invented the device and offers enough credible candidates to field a baseball team: everyone from Carl Jung, who helped pioneer the field of psychology, to Étienne-Jules Marey, who did the same for cinematography. As Bunn puts it, with magisterial restraint, it was a “curious and notable fact that the lie detector’s principal actors mistrusted each other intensely.” Maybe they should have taken a polygraph to resolve the question.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>My polygraph test was the final step in a process that had begun three years earlier, when I started applying for government jobs. At the time, I was living in San Francisco, teaching at Stanford, and was nearly finished with the book. While my job sounded impressive, it paid forty thousand dollars a year and was located in one of the most expensive areas of the country. I was in the second year of a two-year contract and had been trying unsuccessfully to get a real teaching job for years, something tenure-track, or at least a lecturer gig in a more affordable city, one with benefits and some semblance of job security.</p>
<p>When I was “on the market,” as they say, I applied to teaching jobs in Fairbanks, Alaska; Birmingham, Alabama; Spokane, Washington; Camden, New Jersey; Cullowhee, North Carolina; and on and on. I spent a lot of time back then browsing Wikipedia pages for cities I’d never been to, trying to convince myself I could live there. It was a moot point. Despite dozens of interviews, I couldn’t get a professor job. My memory has condensed the experience into one vivid example, when the writing faculty of a football powerhouse down South made me fly to Chicago, in January, on my own dime, so I could sit in their hotel suite sweating through my freshly pressed suit while they asked a series of oddly combative questions for an hour and a half, after which they never bothered to contact me again to tell me that I didn’t get the job I wouldn’t have taken if my life depended on it.</p>
<p>Somewhere along the way, I decided to give up on academia and find a less demoralizing line of work, something with better pay, more stability, maybe even a union. I applied to be a technical writer, an FBI agent, a cop. I didn’t have any luck with those, either. My brother suggested the Border Patrol. He was an agent, and so were a half-dozen of my childhood friends and my former baseball coach. They were always hiring. The starting pay was nearly double what I made at Stanford, with much better benefits, and I might be able to move back to Arizona.</p>
<p>Most of my old friends from home thought joining the Border Patrol was a good idea. I could be closer to family, make a living, maybe even buy a house. My social circle in San Francisco was another story. By then, I’d been in academia for more than a decade, surrounded by white liberals from wealthy backgrounds. When they heard I was trying to join the Border Patrol, my new friends all said the same thing: <em>why?</em></p>
<p>I didn’t understand the question, and soon determined it was a matter of perspective. For people who grew up wealthy, or even middle-class—whatever that means—the proper career path seems to be to find a job that’s rewarding, fulfilling, whatever. I’d done every job I’d ever had for one reason, the same reason I was trying to join the Border Patrol: money. Did I want to drive around the border in an SUV detaining people? Of course not. But I didn’t want to help tech billionaires write their memoirs, either. At least the Border Patrol paid a living wage.</p>
<p>But the Border Patrol is <em>racist</em>, my friends said. And that might be true. But cries of racism rang hollow coming from people who worked in academia, one of the whitest industries in America. The Border Patrol is a hell of a lot more diverse than the average writing faculty.</p>
<p>Their underlying point was right, though: if I joined the Border Patrol, I’d be complicit. But I was already complicit. The longer I spent in higher ed, the more it seemed like an engine driving American inequality. At least the Border Patrol gave working-class people a path to economic mobility without being saddled by a lifetime of student loan debt. My brother had begun his career at the same time I’d started grad school. Nine years later, he made twice as much as I did, owned a house and a new Acura, had health insurance and a retirement account and the whole American dream. Meanwhile, in the three years since I applied to the Border Patrol, I’d taken another teaching job in Albuquerque, making forty-five grand, with shitty benefits and no long-term security. Besides, I still hadn’t decided to actually join the Border Patrol. I hadn’t been offered the job.</p>
<p>By the time I went to El Paso, I’d passed a four-hour written exam, a physical, a fitness test, an oral interview, and a background check so intensive that they’d talked to my coworkers, every neighbor in my apartment building, and my high school teachers. Once I passed the background check, I waited more than a year for the call from the polygraph office.</p>
<p>That call would be the first sign that the government and I had different ideas about truth. First, I got an email from a scheduler saying he’d been trying to reach me. I hadn’t received any messages, so I knew that wasn’t true, but had no way to prove it. I called the office and spoke to another man, who said he was a quality control agent, and that he’d call me back soon with a date and time for my appointment. He never did. Then I received a letter saying I’d been removed from consideration for refusing to take the polygraph. I called Mr. Quality Control. He accused me of lying, but grudgingly scheduled my appointment. So there I was, in a building full of liars, about to have mine detected.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Kevin started off by reminding me of the rules. One of them was that I could not discuss my test with anyone afterward. I’m sure he would have told me that I couldn’t write about it either, although I made sure not to ask. Clearly the government believed, despite all historical evidence to the contrary, in its power to control information. I believed my right to free speech was inalienable. In that sense, I guess this essay is a lie detector, too: we’re going to find out who was right.</p>
<p>Kevin ran me through some questions that might be on the test. Some were pedestrian, my name and address and so on. Others were bizarre: questions about bestiality, child porn, terrorism.</p>
<p>When he got to a question about my past drug use, Kevin’s tone changed. His smile fell and he held eye contact. The interrogation had begun. I told him the same well-rehearsed thing I’d told my background investigator: <em>I experimented with drugs a few times in high school and college</em>. It was a lie. Kevin seemed to detect it.</p>
<p>“What do you mean by few?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Not many.”</p>
<p>“Could it mean five?”</p>
<p>“I guess it <em>could</em>.”</p>
<p>“Don’t be a smartass.”</p>
<p>I looked around the room. It couldn’t be just me and Kevin. Surely there was a witness somewhere, a hidden camera, a recorder, anything to prove we actually said what his report would say we had. Later I would learn that federal polygraph protocol requires examiners to make audio recordings of exams, and that many examiners have been accused of ignoring that requirement, as well as an array of other sordid and unprofessional practices. I don’t remember Kevin saying anything about a recording, or seeing a device. But there’s no way to say for sure.</p>
<p>Kevin sighed elaborately and asked the maximum number of times I could have used illegal drugs. “Was it six? Eight?”</p>
<p>“Sure,” I said. “It was a long time ago.”</p>
<p>“Could it be ten?” he asked, with a smug little grin, and finally I caught on.</p>
<p>“No. Definitely not ten.” If Kevin wanted a fixed and certain truth, I’d give him one.</p>
<p>He wrote “6–8 times” on his notepad.</p>
<p>“I said it could have been that many, not that it <em>was</em>.”</p>
<p>Kevin said to let him do his job, and a shroud of dread descended. The test hadn’t even begun, and I’d already found myself at epistemological loggerheads with the federal government. Kevin thought he’d convinced me to tell the truth, which was that I’d done drugs between six and eight times in my life. I thought there was no truth to tell. I didn’t remember how many times it was. A few minutes earlier, Kevin had said there was no maximum threshold for drug use that would disqualify me—a bald-faced lie I had not yet detected—but I wasn’t about to say that the real number was closer to a hundred. So the lie became the truth: I’d done drugs six to eight times.</p>
<p><span>The polygraph works a lot like a memoir. It doesn’t find the truth, it creates it.</span></p><p>Almost immediately, I began to believe it. As I sat there watching Kevin scribble notes, a handful of specific drug experiences returned to me. The first time I got high and drunk at the same time, in eighth grade, and spent the night in my friend David’s bathroom with my head on the toilet seat while he tried to convince his mom that I had food poisoning. When Charlie taught me the trick where you blow the smoke through a paper towel tube with a fabric softener sheet rubber-banded over the end. The first line of meth I ever snorted, off a Bone Thugs CD case in Jeremy’s bedroom. The cooks at my first restaurant job going around at closing time on busy nights, handing out key bumps. The eight ball I went in on with two ex-con dishwashers at my second restaurant job, who told me they’d pay me back double in a week, but then Mike got stabbed and I realized I wasn’t cut out for that life. I never saw that money or the drugs, so maybe that one didn’t count.</p>
<p>But that was all during one relatively short period of my life, when I was a shithead teenager. I’d come so far since then. I was a college professor; technically a visiting assistant professor, but still. My memoir was about to come out. The sitting president at the time had admitted to using marijuana and cocaine in <em>his</em> memoir. Why should I be banned from a job for being a small-time delinquent twenty years ago? Remove those few wayward years and it was true enough that I’d only done drugs a few times in high school and college. As we say in the memoir business, it was <em>my</em> truth.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>My new profession, memoirist, had a complicated relationship with truth, to put it mildly. Fake-memoir scandals have erupted more or less continuously as long as America has existed, from James Frey and his contemporaries, to the so-called autobiographies of Howard Hughes and Davy Crockett, to fantastical captivity narratives of the colonial era and dubious accounts of European explorers in the New World. Sometimes it seems like every notable American figure wrote a fictionalized memoir—even Wyatt Earp, the patron saint of my hometown. (<em>Frontier Marshal</em>. It’s a hoot.) I fudged plenty of facts myself, combining real people into composite characters, changing the order of events. Most memoirists do the same. The point of the genre isn’t accuracy or precision. The point is to tell a good story.</p>
<p>The same applies to the polygraph. There’s no real evidence for the machine’s accuracy. Its purpose is to monitor the body’s physical response to stimuli, but the body’s response to lying is indistinguishable from its response to any other stimulus. Even the telltale spike in the polygraph chart, itself largely a myth created by TV and movies, can indicate anything from a heart problem to sexual attraction. (Indeed, the machine’s inventors used it to detect both of those things. Larson married one of his first test subjects, and Keeler discovered a heart defect while testing the machine on himself.)</p>
<p>But from the early years of the machine to the present day, its proponents have told the same story of an infallible machine that detects lies. Polygraph organizations routinely estimate its accuracy at nearly 100 percent. Most of those estimates are invented out of thin air, and the few based on data suffer from an obvious sampling error. As early as 1939, Walter Summers—yet another purported inventor of a lie detector—pointed out the fundamental flaw on which all polygraph statistics are based: they “fail to relate the number of instances in which deception was actually practiced in a manner which eluded the examiner and the instrument.” You can’t detect the lies you can’t detect.</p>
<p>Independent studies suggest a polygraph exam is roughly as accurate as a coin flip, and that polygraph operators find as many as half of innocent subjects guilty. The scientific case against the polygraph is so compelling that the National Academy of Sciences, the American Psychological Association, the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment, and the United States Supreme Court have dismissed it as unreliable. A federal law forbids using the polygraph to screen applicants to private companies. For most jobs in America, an exam like mine would’ve been against the law.</p>
<p>In fact, the only people who seem to believe the polygraph is accurate are its operators. Every study I’ve found that supports the machine’s ability to detect deception was funded or performed by polygraphers. They’ve formed half a dozen different organizations dedicated to spreading the lie of the lie detector. Their websites are ironically similar to the polygraph itself: archaic, slipshod, rife with bias and bullshit. The International League of Polygraph Examiners calls the device’s invention “officially one of the greatest of all time,” and claims the accuracy of contemporary polygraphs is close to 100 percent. The American Polygraph Association, which claims to be the largest organization of polygraphers, has a section of its website devoted to Polygraph Validity Research.</p>
<p>It begins by stating the organization “<em>believes</em> that scientific evidence supports the validity of polygraph examinations.” The site includes a link to what seems to be the entire basis of that belief, the “Meta-Analytic Survey of Criterion Accuracy of Validated Polygraph Techniques.” The document was prepared by a team of polygraphers, and it reads about how you’d expect. I made it far enough to learn a few astounding facts, including that until 2012, the American Polygraph Association did not require members to use methods supported by published research. In other words, for the first ninety-one years of its existence, polygraphers literally had no scientific standards. Luckily for me, they came up with some just in time for my exam.</p>
<p>The lie detector was like any true story in America: the facts didn’t matter as long as a lot of people believed it. And we wanted to believe it: the notion of a lie detector existed long before the polygraph did. Tellingly, it first appeared in fiction. Bunn traces its first known usage to Charles Walk’s 1909 detective novel <em>The Yellow Circle</em>, in which a character fantasizes about having a machine he calls a lie detector: “With its aid one can plumb the bottomless pits of a chap’s subconscious mind, and fathom all the mysteries of his subliminal ego.” In 1914, seven years before anyone claimed to have invented a polygraph, G. K. Chesterton mocked the notion of a lie detector in his mystery story <em>The Mistake of the Machine</em>, comparing it to the Dark Ages belief that blood would flow from a victim’s body if their murderer touched it. Bunn lists many other instances of lie detectors appearing in fiction long before anyone claimed to have invented one.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the popular American media seemed obsessed with the idea of machines that could see inside our heads, hearts, and souls. Fourteen years before Larson’s polygraph debuted, the <em>New York Times</em> ran an article rhapsodizing about Jung’s electric psychometer. That “mysterious little machine” purported to detect emotions, not lies; still, the article foretold a future when it would be used to detect guilt, making criminal courts superfluous. Four years later, the same paper ran a two-page profile of the “big-hearted” men, Edward Johnstone and Henry Goddard, who’d been doing the “self-sacrificing work” of testing the psychometer on developmentally disabled children at an institution in New Jersey. Under Johnstone’s supervision, Goddard hooked kids up to a machine like Jung’s. Their intent was to study and eradicate “feeble-mindedness”; Johnstone was a noted member of the American eugenics movement. But the article breathlessly predicted a future in which the lie detector would replace the “impedimenta” of American justice, like judges and juries.</p>
<p>When the story started circulating that a cop with a PhD had invented a lie-detecting machine, a myth became a widely reported fact almost overnight. Within a year, the<em> San Francisco Examiner</em> claimed, “everyone has heard of the ‘lie detector.’” By then, polygraph results had already been banned from American courts, by a judge who was less enthused about the prospect of a machine replacing juries. It would be the first of many official dismissals of the polygraph. But it didn’t dampen the media’s fascination with the so-called lie detector—and, by extension, the American public’s.</p>
<p>That fascination was furthered by the polygraph’s sister inventions, psychology and cinematography, which were created by some of the same men at around the same time. In addition to his psychometer, Jung also helped create the field of modern psychology. Marey developed a different forerunner of the polygraph, as well as chronophotography, an important step in the development of cinema. Marston pioneered the idea of detecting lies based on physical responses, and later became a Hollywood censor and wrote a guide for aspiring screenwriters. His academic mentor, Hugo Münsterberg, helped lay the theoretical groundwork for the polygraph, and also published one of the earliest works of film theory.</p>
<p>The rise of psychology helped drive a cultural fascination with discovering the inner workings of the mind—especially the criminal mind—a desire the lie detector satisfied. Meanwhile, cinematography, the notion that we could document and preserve reality itself, had embarked on its ongoing project of destroying our cultural distinctions between fiction and fact.</p>
<p>Throughout its history, the polygraph has moved freely between the two realms. As it spread to police departments across the country, who used it to investigate real crimes, the machine also began to appear in advertisements and movies. The machine may have made its screen debut in the 1926 silent-film serial <em>Officer 444</em>, alongside Vollmer, who played an idealized version of himself, a criminologist using science against evil. By the 1930s, Marston was using the polygraph to screen-test Hollywood films, including <em>Frankenstein</em>—ironic, considering that Larson once compared his invention to the Monster—and to sell razor blades, gasoline, and cigarettes. In 1941, Marston invented Wonder Woman, a female superhero whose primary power was a Lasso of Truth, similar to a lie detector. Marston called the comic “psychological propaganda,” and it was hugely effective: within a year, Wonder Woman had her own comic book with a circulation of half a million. In 1946, Keeler starred in a noir movie alongside his version of the machine. The first TV show called <em>Lie Detector</em> debuted in the fifties; there have since been a handful of others, both scripted and reality, not to mention a continuous stream of polygraph appearances in film and television. While writing this essay, I watched lie detectors play prominent roles in two different TV shows. In one, the polygraph is accurate; in the other, it isn’t.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Kevin slid a blank sheet of paper across the desk and told me to draw the number five inside a black circle. I did, and slid it back. Kevin drew other numbers in other circles and said now he was going to hook me up to the machine.</p>
<p>He told me to take off my shoes and empty my pockets, then directed me to the chair. I sat on one sensor and put my feet on two others. Kevin wrapped two cords around my chest, slid a sphygmomanometer over my left arm, and stuck metal clamps on my right index and ring fingers. As he pumped up the cuff, Kevin asked if I was comfortable. He didn’t seem to be joking.</p>
<p>He sat behind his desk and said he was going to point to all the numbers on the paper and ask if I’d written them. I should say no every time, even for the one I’d written. He did. I did. He unhooked me, led me to the desk, and pointed to the lie on the computer screen. It looked like a lot of squiggly lines to me.</p>
<p>“Now we can take a break,” Kevin said. I looked at the clock, which wasn’t visible from the polygraph chair; we’d only been in the room for half an hour. Kevin smiled inscrutably. “Bathroom and water only. Be back in ten minutes.”</p>
<p>I wandered into the hallway, drank from a fountain, leaned against another beige wall, and tried to calm down. I was not then in a great place, psychologically speaking. I stayed up until sunrise a few nights a week, spent days on end inside my apartment, often went blank with anxiety in front of my classes, and was preoccupied by a vivid and persistent vision of myself swan-diving off my balcony. I would later be diagnosed with various conditions and embark upon a reasonably successful therapeutic journey, but right then, in that hallway, I was freaking the fuck out. My shirt clung wetly to my chest, where I could see my heart beating as if it was trying to escape, like the alien in <em>Alien</em>. If I had a heart attack in the chair, what would that look like on the polygraph readout?</p>
<p>I’d tried to learn techniques for managing anxiety. Most of them didn’t work— picture a beach, my ass—but a shrink I’d briefly seen had suggested imagining the worst possible outcome, and that seemed helpful. The idea was that you embrace the notion of failure and realize it wouldn’t be so bad, thereby relieving the pressure not to fail.</p>
<p>I tried it. What if I failed the poly? I’d go back to Albuquerque, keep teaching, apply for more jobs. This was my backup plan, which made me luckier than pretty much everyone else applying. Then again, that was not the worst-case situation. One problem with that exercise is that I could always come up with something worse. What if I got in a car accident on my tired four-hour drive and spent the rest of my pain-filled life alone in my rented house in Albuquerque? What if I passed the poly, got the job, and actually took it—got sent to some borderland armpit like Ajo or Wellton where I’d have to herd other human beings into the back of trucks? Woke up two or ten or thirty years down the road and didn’t recognize myself?</p>
<p>By the time Kevin came to get me, a few minutes sooner than the ten I’d been promised, I’d almost accepted my imminent failure. If my anxiety didn’t make me fail the test, something else would. I remembered something from my sorta-research about Catholics failing the polygraph at higher rates. Technically I was Catholic, baptized and confirmed, now lapsed, but that only made things worse. Maybe I’d ask Kevin how to become a polygrapher. How much training did it require? Did he enjoy it? How much money did he make? Later, I’d search around online and find out that the average polygraph examiner makes even less than I did at the time. Then again, the training only takes ten weeks, and there are actually jobs in that field. I’d been training for years to be a nonfiction professor and still had no idea what truth actually meant; maybe I should’ve just taken a polygraph course and become an official federal arbiter of facts, an asshole demigod like Kevin.</p>
<p>I shouldn’t be so hard on Kevin. Judging by his clothes and demeanor, he probably came from a similar background to mine. Maybe polygraphing was his version of teaching, a thing he did to pay the bills because it was better than his other options. Maybe he had a whole life to maintain, a family, a little house in some cul-de-sac on the West Side, two Toyotas and a swing set.</p>
<p>While Kevin strapped me back into the chair, I wondered what he told himself at night, trying to sleep, after watching applicants lose their best hope for a career to his machine. Kevin seemed like a smart guy, way too smart to believe in the simpleminded fantasy of a machine that detects lies. But that wasn’t his decision. It was his employer’s. And why is our government the only major employer in the world that uses polygraphs to screen prospective hires?</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>The answer to that question is based on a lie. Even the United States government isn’t dumb enough to believe the polygraph works. The machine’s real purpose is symbolic, as an icon of the power of the state. Law enforcement agencies don’t use the machine to detect lies. They use it to coerce confessions.</p>
<p>In its early days, the polygraph was considered a more humane version of the infamous “third degree,” the interrogation procedure it largely replaced, which involved beating the shit out of a suspect until they confessed. The third degree was itself a variation of another quintessentially American tactic, outright torture. The parallels between torture and the polygraph are obvious: the latter’s arcane parts and procedures, its use of restraints and stimuli, the gratuitous periods of waiting for what the subject knows is coming. The polygraph creates the very stress it’s designed to detect, then presents it as evidence of deception, which often leads its subject to confess. If the subject confesses, that confession effectively <em>becomes</em> the truth, whether it’s true or false or somewhere in between.</p>
<p>And the polygraph has a long history of coercing false confessions. It may begin with its maiden voyage in 1921, when Larson tested his new device on the residents of an all-female Berkeley dorm that had experienced a rash of petty thefts. Thanks in part to the polygraph, a suspect admitted to most of the thefts and withdrew from the university. But the crimes continued, and Larson himself doubted the veracity of her confession.</p>
<p>Not long after, Larson tested a man named Henry Wilkens who was accused of having his wife killed. The polygraph helped to exonerate Wilkens despite evidence of his guilt. After that, police began to doubt the polygraph’s utility, and some departments refused to use it. (The media had no such qualms: it continued to trumpet the infallibility of the “electric detective.”)</p>
<p>A year after the Wilkens case, a young Black man named James Frye retracted his confession to killing a Washington, DC, doctor, claiming it was coerced. Using his variation of the lie detector, Marston examined Frye and declared him innocent. But the judge prevented Marston from testifying as an expert at trial, and an appeals court upheld the ruling, instituting what became known as the Frye rule, which has largely prevented polygraph results from being admissible in American courts ever since.</p>
<p>But the machine remains useful for extracting confessions. And the conflation of confessions and truth is yet another lie, one that’s kept the polygraph alive for the last century as a peculiarly American delusion. Confessions are usually presumed to be true and treated as such in legal settings. But recent research suggests that false confessions are common, especially in the context of police interrogations.</p>
<p>Despite a growing body of evidence, including hundreds of exonerations based on DNA evidence, most people don’t believe in false confessions. A recent article in the <em>Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law</em> explains why:</p>
<p>Most lay people believe in what has been referred to as the myth of psychological interrogation: that an innocent person will not falsely confess to police unless he is physically tortured or mentally ill…the myth of psychological interrogation persists because most people do not know what occurs during police interrogations, and because they wrongly assume that individuals do not act against their self-interest or engage in self-destructive behavior, such as falsely confessing to a crime that they did not commit.</p>
<p>The likelihood of a false confession increases when interrogators use certain tactics, especially elements of the so-called Reid Technique, a procedure created in the 1950s by John E. Reid. I didn’t know it at the time, but Kevin used elements of the Reid Technique in my test. He conducted it in a small, barely furnished, cold room; seated me in a hard, armless, straight-backed chair; and repeatedly encroached on my personal space.</p>
<p>Reid first used his technique (along with a polygraph) in 1955, to extract a confession from a man named Darrel Parker who was suspected of killing his wife. Parker was convicted and sentenced to life in prison. He served fifteen years before being released on appeal because Parker’s confession was ruled to have been coerced. Eighteen years after Parker’s release, a man on death row for other crimes confessed to the murder; he did so by showing his lawyers a passage of his memoirs that described the murder in detail, a passage the legal system apparently assumed to be true.</p>
<p>Neither those nor the Reid Technique’s subsequent high-profile failures, including the $2m settlement of a 2012 civil case by a wrongly convicted man named Juan Rivera, have prevented it from being adopted by police departments across America. The company founded in Reid’s name, John E. Reid and Associates, claims its technique is “the most widely used approach to question subjects in the world,” and recently registered a trademark on the term.</p>
<p>The Reid Technique™ involves a number of tactics, from creating an anxiety-inducing environment to a list of specific steps. According to Saul Kassin, perhaps the foremost American expert on false confessions, the purpose of those tactics is to “get suspects to incriminate themselves by increasing the anxiety associated with denial, plunging the subject into a state of despair and then minimizing the perceived consequences of confession.”</p>
<p>Like the polygraph, the Reid Technique isn’t designed to find the truth. Its purpose is to coerce confessions. Research suggests the Reid Technique may actually make interrogators <em>worse</em> at detecting truth. In an independent study, interrogators trained in the Reid Technique were less accurate, although “they were more confident and cited more reasons for their judgments.”</p>
<p><span>Myths exist for a reason, to explain collective phenomena, to explain us to ourselves.</span></p><p>The polygraph itself is not required for the Reid Technique, but it helps. Together, they have a long and checkered history of producing false confessions. In 2013, the <em>Chicago Tribune</em> found a pattern of false confessions obtained via polygraph exams and the Reid Technique, by examiners who routinely ignored accepted standards, including failing or refusing to record interrogations.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Kevin said the first battery of questions would cover my character, and asked if I had any questions. I did, but too many, and where to start? So I said no, and Kevin started the exam.</p>
<p>He asked me a battery of eight questions four times in different orders. By the time I typed notes on my phone after the test, I’d already forgotten one of them. The other seven were:</p>
<p>1. Have you misrepresented your past drug use?<br>
2. Have you lied about participating in serious crimes?<br>
3. Have you falsified info on forms?<br>
4. Have you ever cheated to get ahead in your personal life?<br>
5. Have you ever made disparaging comments about your supervisor?<br>
6. Is the light on?<br>
7. Have you taken a drink of water today?</p>
<p>Except for the last two, all of them seemed open to interpretation. For instance, I absolutely had misrepresented my past drug use, but only the number of times, not the drugs or the fact of doing them. And could my estimate be a lie when there’s no way to know the exact answer? What crimes are considered serious? What counts as cheating? Who gets to say? Has any employed person in America not made a single disparaging comment about a supervisor?</p>
<p>The first time through the questions, I tried to follow Kevin’s direction to answer quickly, yes or no, and to abide by his somewhat contradictory instructions to breathe normally while staying absolutely still. The second time through, my voice began to crack, and I swallowed.</p>
<p>“Stop!”</p>
<p>I turned my head to see who he was yelling at.</p>
<p>“Stay completely still!”</p>
<p>I turned back to the wall and tried to comply. Kevin kept yelling, asking combative and rhetorical questions: was I <em>trying</em> to beat the test, did I <em>want</em> to fail? I tried to calm myself by imagining something peaceful, although that was probably considered a countermeasure, and anyway, it didn’t work: I visualized ripping off the electrodes and punching Kevin. I tried the box-breathing technique I’d once learned from a veteran stepdad. That worked better. Possibly too well. Soon I caught myself nodding off.</p>
<p>That probably sounds like a lie. How could someone under that much stress be sleepy? Have you ever been interrogated? I don’t mean metaphorically, having a difficult conversation, confessing something to a spouse, parent, priest, boss. I mean actually interrogated, by a professional. No lawyer, no witnesses, nobody on your side. And he has a machine that says he’s right, not to mention the backing of the Department of Homeland Security, a vast and unaccountable agency built on the lie that policing and surveilling Americans will protect us from terrorism. Suddenly, this part of the Border Patrol application process made a grim kind of sense: I was getting a little taste of how an immigrant might feel. Except I deserved it. I’d signed up for this.</p>
<p>If you haven’t been in that situation, maybe you think, like I did before it was proven otherwise, that you’d be one of the exceptions. You’d beat the polygraph, like people do on TV. But that’s the thing: you can’t beat the polygraph, because the polygraph isn’t a lie detector, isn’t a test, isn’t even a machine. It’s a fact, part of a story power tells itself to justify its power. Maybe you can beat the machine— they don’t detect lies, so it’s not that hard—but you can’t beat an entire country that believes in it.</p>
<p>As Kevin went through the questions again, I sank into a fugue, part paranoia and part exhaustion, and lost track of time. Not what time it was—the whole idea of time. There was no past or future, only an endless present of sitting in that windowless room, strapped to a chair, wired to a machine, staring at a beige wall while a stranger I couldn’t see asked the same questions, over and over. I forgot why I was there, who I was, the truth and what it meant. At some point, I heard a sort of flutter, and my vision vibrated and jumped, as if someone had changed the reel. My mind floated up to the corner of the room and observed the proceedings from a cool remove. My memory of the rest of the test is from a vantage point outside of my body.</p>
<p>Jung defined this phenomenon as dissociation, the loss of a fixed and coherent identity. Reports of similar experiences were largely ignored in early psychology, but more recent studies suggest dissociation is fairly common, and can be triggered by drugs, trauma, stress, or nothing at all. Jung said dissociative states could prevent a subject from recalling important facts, among other things. “We talk about being able to control ourselves,” he wrote. “But self-control is a rare and remarkable virtue.”</p>
<p>The polygraph showed me I was neither rare nor remarkable. By the final time through the battery, I no longer knew what was true. For example: the first three times Kevin asked if I’d ever disparaged a supervisor, I’d rationalized, telling myself “disparaged” was a strong word. It means to regard as having little worth, and older definitions meant to dishonor or degrade; did Kevin know it came from the Old French <em>disparagier</em>, to marry unequally? Certainly I’d made fun of some bosses, and respected few, but I hadn’t disparaged my supervisors, per se. The fourth time he asked me the question, a crystalline memory popped into my detached head, a moment a few years before when I told my then-girlfriend that my then-boss was a fucking idiot.</p>
<p>“No,” I said. Kevin moved on.</p>
<p>Later I would learn that I wasn’t the first lie detector subject to report experiencing dissociation. I’m not even the first one to write about it. As an undergraduate at Harvard, Gertrude Stein worked in a laboratory run by Hugo Münsterberg, who came up with the earliest scientific rationale for lie detection. Stein’s first published work, an 1894 essay originally written for her sophomore composition class titled “In the Psychological Laboratory,” was an account of her experiences in the lab, including an instance of being connected to one of Münsterberg’s primitive predecessors of the polygraph. The essay’s third person narration and distinctive syntax are both harbingers of Stein’s future work, and her knowledge of the machine seems to have informed her later experiments in “automatic writing.” (It’s also worth noting that her autobiography has fictional elements.)</p>
<p>But her account interests me for other reasons. She describes the experience of being subjected to an exam in front of a group of students like so:</p>
<p>Strange fancies begin to crowd upon her, she feels that the silent pen is writing on and on forever. Her record is there she cannot escape it and the group about her begin to assume the shape of mocking fiends gloating over her imprisoned misery. Suddenly she starts, they have suddenly loosened a metronome directly behind her, to observe the effect, so now the morning’s work is over.</p>
<p>What it describes sounds like dissociation, or exactly what I felt when I was subjected to the polygraph.</p>
<p>The scientific literature suggests dissociation during polygraph exams is fairly common. In 1996, the polygrapher Donald J. Krapohl wrote an article for <em>Polygraph</em>, the official organ of the American Polygraph Association, that addresses the phenomenon. The article is typical of polygraphers’ attempts at justifying their profession in the sense that it’s paranoid, authoritarian, proto-fascist, and presents the opinions and experiences of a single polygraph operator as if they’re commandments carved into tablets. Krapohl begins with a blithe, moralistic tirade about “the phenomenon of mendacity” that “pervades every class and culture.” Lying, he claims, is endemic to certain types of people, having “served to defend or expand the interests of uncounted generations of monarchs, merchants, spouses, debtors, knaves, and saints.”</p>
<p>Kraphol attempts to codify four classes of countermeasures. The first, Physical Countermeasures, includes any instance in which a polygraph subject “use[s] movements in hopes of masking their reactions or misdirecting the examiner.” Of course, a polygraph subject might move for any number of reasons during an exam, including as a natural reaction to the very discomfort and stress it’s designed to cause; no examiner or machine can determine <em>why</em>. And one wonders why a test so supposedly accurate can be fooled by something as simple as flexing a muscle.</p>
<p>The second category, “Mental Countermeasures,” includes imagery, hypnosis, biofeedback training, placebos, and even personality. Notably, dissociation is considered a mental countermeasure. Here, again, is the rub: if the subject dissociates during a polygraph, who’s to say whether it’s intentional? Even Krapohl acknowledges that “the outward appearance of a dissociating subject is quite similar to that of a cooperating test subject.” In other words, nobody can tell if another person is dissociating, much less why. Even the person dissociating may not know; I certainly didn’t at the time. Studies suggest dissociation is often an unconscious response to intense stress of the sort the polygraph is designed to create in its subject. The polygraph works by stressing you out, but if the stress it causes in turn causes the subject to dissociate, they can be failed for trying to cheat.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Kevin gave me another break. I spent it in the waiting area, staring out over the rooftops of El Paso. The window faced east, so I couldn’t see the border, but the border is like the truth: you know when you’re close to it. After a few minutes, Kevin came and led me back into the interrogation room, where he sat me down and said I’d failed. The machine detected deception in my answers to either the drug question or the falsifying information question. I was amazed: he couldn’t even tell which question I’d lied about? And why hadn’t he detected my lie about disparaging my boss?</p>
<p>Kevin went on to say that I must have researched tactics to defeat the poly. My swallowing seemed to bother him to the point that he considered it evidence of deception. I said my mouth had been dry, but Kevin ignored me, telling stories about his brother who’d done drugs and other applicants who said they’d gotten high a thousand times. I didn’t know it at the time, but his psychological tactics were all elements of the Reid Technique: repeated, unwavering assertions of guilt; attempts to excuse or minimize the suspected crime; constant interruptions; professed sympathy; and, of course, outright lies.</p>
<p>Kevin said he was almost positive that my drug use wasn’t over the threshold. Earlier, he’d told me there was no threshold, and it dawned on me that Kevin wasn’t much of an interrogator without his machine. He kept fishing, accusing me of various lies, interrupting whenever I tried to deny, suggesting things I may have forgotten: didn’t I ever do any pills when I was a bartender? Did I really only do meth once or twice? He began pointing to the computer screen and picking up other deceptions. He detected possible lies in my academic record—I told him I’d gotten a 3.0 GPA at a state school, and why the hell would anybody lie about that?—and questioned whether I really had a master’s degree, even though I’d provided transcripts as part of my background investigation.</p>
<p>He accused, I denied, and it became the worst kind of male interaction, a matter of pride. He was lying, I was lying, everything we said was both true and false, depending how you looked at it. I wasn’t even hooked up to the machine anymore, so I didn’t understand why we were still talking. He’d already said that I failed. Couldn’t we call it a day?</p>
<p>As Kevin’s one-man theater dragged on, I thought about the long drive ahead of me, and began to understand why people make false confessions. It’s not because you don’t know the truth. It’s because the truth doesn’t matter. When the person across the table has all the power, what’s the point of arguing? It was pretty clear by then, a few hours into a test I’d already failed, that Kevin didn’t give a damn what was true. He wouldn’t be satisfied until I confessed. But fuck Kevin and his machine. I wasn’t confessing.</p>
<p>Kevin paused, and I thought we might finally be done until he asked about my mother’s murder: was there anything I hadn’t told him about <em>that</em>? It broke the spell. I dissociated in reverse, came fully into my body. My chest relaxed, my heart quieted, and I saw the situation clearly for the first time. Kevin was just some dickhead with a grift, doing a job based on lies for a government that practically invented them. Did I know anything about my mother’s murder? I’d spent five years writing about it. I was the world’s foremost authority on the subject. But I wasn’t telling Kevin. If he wanted to know, he could buy the fucking book.</p>
<p>I asked if I was free to leave. He shrugged. As I stood and went for the door, he asked if I would come back for another test with him if necessary. Sure, I said. I’d love to. It was the last thing I would ever say to Kevin, and I wanted to make sure it was a lie.</p>
<p>When I got home, I checked the internet forum and read a post by the guy who’d been sitting with me in the waiting room. He’d failed, too. His story was almost exactly the same as mine, except his test took twice as long. He must have tried harder than I did to tell the truth.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Three weeks later, my book came out, and I once again found myself answering questions. Whenever someone asked about truth, I’d say that I consulted the historical record when possible, but that the book was mostly based on memory. Sometimes, despite myself, that old cliche slipped out: <em>it’s my truth</em>. I’d think about the polygraph, Kevin’s endless questions, his assumption that a fixed, detectable truth existed in my memory.</p>
<p>Writing a book based on memory showed me it’s less a font of truth than a river of lies. We may tell ourselves stories in order to live, as Didion famously said, but nobody ever quotes the rest of that passage: “We live entirely, especially if we are writers, by the imposition of a narrative line upon disparate images, by the ‘ideas’ with which we have learned to freeze the shifting phantasmagoria which is our actual experience.” That sounds a lot like lying.</p>
<p>Even if we mean to tell the truth, the existing science suggests that memory is almost as unreliable as the polygraph. In 1885, the German psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus did tests on himself and came up with his famed “forgetting curve,” a chart that showed we forget more than half of information within a few days. More recent studies have found that autobiographical memory—the deliberate recollection of facts, ideas, and experiences from one’s life—is not only inaccurate, but suggestible and frequently false. And factors such as depression and trauma, both psychological and physical, have been found to degrade autobiographical memory.</p>
<p>Then there’s the issue of stress, which also seems to have a range of effects on memory. Stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline have been shown to aid in memory consolidation, which is, more or less, the process of storing recently learned information as memories for long-term recall. But those memories can change each time they’re remembered, through a process called reconsolidation: once accessed, the memory has to be rewritten, and it can be rewritten differently, revised just like a scene in a memoir. While stress may aid in memory consolidation, it has a profoundly negative effect on reconsolidation. Trauma has its own story to tell.</p>
<p><span>We’re all polygraphers, staring at the screens of our truth machines, proving ourselves right.</span></p><p>By the time I took the polygraph, my memory had already been rewritten. After five years of accessing and re-accessing memories of my mother and her death, I’d recently begun to understand how dangerous it is to write a book based primarily on memory. I don’t mean the truth: accuracy is overrated, not to mention impossible. The real danger is the sacrifice you have to make. By writing your memories, and rewriting them again and again, draft after draft, you replace them, erase them. By the time I finished my book, after revising every word half a dozen times, I didn’t remember my mother anymore. She was pages, scenes, sentences.</p>
<p>The polygraph works a lot like a memoir. It doesn’t find the truth, it creates it. First the exam makes you doubt or forget your memories. Then, by forcing you to re-access them again and again under stress, it literally rewrites them. Since my polygraph exam, I’ve believed that I did drugs between six and eight times before then, even though my rational mind knows that isn’t true. My experience of being polygraphed showed me that not only does the polygraph not detect lies, it manufactures them.</p>
<p>More than two million polygraph exams are given every year in America; it’s a two-billion-dollar industry. No other country in the world uses the poly to nearly the extent that we do, and most don’t use it at all. Why are we the only ones who build machines to detect the truth, and believe that they can, despite all evidence to the contrary? Why do we need to believe in a truth so simple it can be detected by a machine?</p>
<p>The lie detector is a myth. Everyone who doesn’t make money off of polygraphs agrees on that. But myths exist for a reason, to explain collective phenomena, to explain us to ourselves. Myths create a sense of community through shared belief. Judging by our obsession with lie detectors—and the fact that we continue to call them that, more than a century into this charade—the myth of a simple, detectable truth is one of the few beliefs most Americans do still share.</p>
<p>The lie detector came straight out of science fiction, and drifted into the realm of fact at the beginning of a century in which a succession of groundbreaking technologies would shatter and reshape our cultural conceptions of what was possible: Edison’s bulbs, Bell’s telephone, Ford’s mass-produced cars, the Wright Brothers’ airplane. By the time the polygraph came along, a credulous American public was used to tales of revolutionary, terrifying innovations that were going to change their lives forever. Some of those technologies were transforming reality itself.</p>
<p>Electricity was spreading across the country, quite literally changing the way people saw the world. So were telephone and radio access, which did the same for how we heard it. The polygraph’s siblings, cinema and psychology, were transforming the way people saw themselves. Meanwhile, Modernism—the artistic movement responding to those changes—was roiling the arts in every medium, revising our expressions of lived and imagined reality; the United States government banned James Joyce’s <em>Ulysses</em> the same year the polygraph debuted.</p>
<p>How it must have felt to be a human then. A man my age in 1921 might have remembered reading dime Westerns by candlelight as a boy, riding a horse to school, a time before voices—much less humans—could travel through the air. He’d seen the Progressive era rewrite the rules of society, including the victory of women’s suffrage the year before. He might have fought in the first World War. By the time the polygraph was invented, he may have owned a car or had access to a telephone, if he was wealthy. But he still got his news from newspapers or neighbors. He didn’t own a screen. Can we blame him for believing in a simple kind of truth that a new device could find?</p>
<p>A century later, I’m awash in new technologies, and deeply confused about what to believe. I was a young adult when smartphones arrived, in college when Facebook debuted, and dimly remember an early childhood before the internet changed everything. In the last few years, as of this writing, the COVID-19 pandemic has altered American life in ways nobody comprehends. Nobody trusts the media anymore, and appalling numbers of Americans refuse to believe in fundamental, verifiable facts. Meanwhile, conspiracies ricochet around the internet, gathering believers.</p>
<p>It’s hard not to see this moment as a parallel of the polygraph’s invention, another time when technology has done a number on whatever shared sense of truth America once had. That erosion has worsened our cultural and political divisions, which often hinge on what kind of truth we believe in: relative and constructed, or absolute and fixed. A century ago, the polygraph was born from the latter belief. But the notion of objective truth seems quaint and naïve in our era of fake news and algorithms, when the only truth that still exists is ours, a custom reality created for us and delivered to our devices. We’re all memoirists now, shouting our stories into the void. We’re all polygraphers, staring at the screens of our truth machines, proving ourselves right.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>A few months after the exam, I got the official news: not only had I been found unsuitable for employment, I also had no right to appeal the decision and was barred from reapplying for a minimum of three years. The consequences of my polygraph exam were finally clear, the only real truth revealed in the whole process: I was never going to be a federal agent.</p>
<p>I wasn’t alone. I soon found out that Customs and Border Protection job applicants had a polygraph failure rate of 68.1 percent, more than double that of other law enforcement agencies. The CBP commissioner at the time said those statistics showed the polygraph was working and blamed the quality of the applicants. It struck me as a strange rhetorical strategy to suggest that his agency attracted applicants so much worse than those of any other law enforcement body in America, but what did I know: I was one of those applicants. One article described polygraph subjects being accused with no evidence of cheating on their wives and having cartel connections, in exams lasting eight hours or longer. Other law enforcement agencies called CBP’s conduct excessive, and Jeff Flake, then a Republican Senator from Arizona, suggested that operators were being forced to fail applicants to justify their own jobs.</p>
<p>A few months after my exam, I got an email officially notifying me of my failure. I replied to the email and asked for a copy of the polygraph report. The CBP representative told me I’d have to file a Freedom of Information Act request. I did. They ignored my request for four months, in violation of FOIA. When I threatened legal action, they denied my request for other reasons, both of which were lies.</p>
<p>I filed another FOIA request and was still waiting for a response when the Office of Personnel Management announced that it had suffered a data breach. The personnel files of millions of federal employees and applicants had been stolen by Chinese hackers. An investigation ensued, and the Inspector General accused OPM officials of lying about the hack. Multiple high-ranking officials, including the director of OPM, resigned in the aftermath.</p>
<p>Eventually I received a letter from the replacement director alerting me that I’d been affected by the hack. (In the letter, she admitted that her own background check had also been compromised, as if that was supposed to make me feel better.) The most sensitive imaginable document about my life—one that included all of my personal and financial information, as well as a complete history of my jobs, residences, and relationships—had been stolen. The government’s solution was to offer free credit monitoring to those affected.</p>
<p>As of this writing, it’s been more than a decade since my polygraph exam, and the government still hasn’t sent me a copy of the report. But at least now I know the truth is out there. It’s on a hard drive somewhere in China.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="article-body" data-attribute="article-content-body" data-component="article-content-body"><p>In a basement on London’s <!-- -->Hatton Garden<!-- -->, a small production team is heating a furnace to 2,000C — a temperature that will obliterate most materials placed within it. Each day, here at precious metals refiner Mastermelt, the furnace is fed a diet of objects collected from jewellers’ workshops — full bags from vacuum cleaners, used wet wipes, blunted sandpaper and even old carpets — in the hope that when the ashes are processed, thousands of pounds’ worth of gold, platinum and more will remain.</p>
<p>“We always tell people, don’t throw anything away,” says Gary Williams, a director at Mastermelt, who the previous week paid out £17,000 to a jeweller who had been casually stockpiling the general detritus a workshop produces. “He’d just been saving all this stuff and didn’t realise what it was worth.” Mastermelt makes its money by taking a commission on the value of the scrap metal refined, as well as charging for processing.</p>
<p>Part of Mr Williams’ job is to educate jewellers on the financial rewards of hoarding every waste-attracting object and sending the haul — known as a sweep — to a refiner to be melted down and the precious metals reclaimed. Most jewellers will be astute enough to collect hard scrap, also known as lemel, which includes filings caught in animal skins hung beneath workbenches for this very reason, or clippings from claws cut to size when setting a diamond in a ring. Once weighed, the value of this scrap can be easily ascertained, and Mastermelt has an app that can be downloaded to give jewellers access to live prices.</p>

<figure data-component="image-set"><picture><source media="(min-width: 700px)" srcset="https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3Ac63e5f56-d924-11e6-944b-e7eb37a6aa8e?source=next-article&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=700&amp;dpr=1 1x,https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3Ac63e5f56-d924-11e6-944b-e7eb37a6aa8e?source=next-article&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=700&amp;dpr=2 2x" width="2048" height="1152"><img src="https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fcom.ft.imagepublish.upp-prod-eu.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fc63e5f56-d924-11e6-944b-e7eb37a6aa8e?source=next-article&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=700&amp;dpr=1" alt="Mastermelt, Hatton Garden" data-image-type="image" width="2048" height="1152" loading="lazy"></picture><figcaption><span>The transformation of the residue into molten gold</span><span> <!-- -->© Charlie Bibby</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>But the precious metal they cannot see may bring in surprising amounts of money too. The grinding, filing and buffing required to create jewels by hand or machine send microscopic clouds of precious dust into the air; the dust can land anywhere and be easily transported as it sticks to shoes and clothing. “We went to a workshop in Birmingham and right at the front of the building was a big 4ft sq coconut mat,” says Mr Williams. “Every single person coming in and out of the building walked over that mat, and had been doing so for seven or eight years.</p>
<p>“They didn’t think it was worth anything as it wasn’t in the workshop, but they let me take it away. We swept up the dirt and processed it and it came to quite a few thousand pounds.” Another surprise source was a pair of chair covers from a shop in Hatton Garden which were so choked with platinum dust that Mastermelt paid out £3,000 after processing them.</p>
<p>Mr Williams has a vault of stories about reclamation and its valuable surprises, but most of them are kept inside the trade. “People don’t really like it being talked about as this is their Christmas bonus,” he says. “Whatever money you make from reclamation is cash flow for your business. It’s found money.”</p>
<p>Timing is important in making sure a reclamation is as profitable as possible. First, a jeweller must ensure they have accumulated a large enough sweep to make a profit. Stuart Wibberley, sales director at Cooksongold, another refiner, says processing carries a flat fee of about £300 “whether you have 30 bags or 300”. (Mastermelt says its fees are variable, typically about £4 per kilo processed.) Then there are metal prices: Mr Williams says Mastermelt was “inundated” after the vote for Brexit in June, when the gold price spiked from $1,265 per oz the day before to $1,316 per oz the day after.</p>

<p>Reclaiming precious metal waste has always been a cornerstone of a jewellery workshop’s routine, but the practice has rarely been as sophisticated as it is today. “It really was considered a bonus in the trade,” says Mark Brittain, whose family business, Brittains Marking, creates complex tools for the luxury jewellery industry.</p>
<p>He ran the company, which was founded in 1850, from the 1970s until the early 2000s, when he retired from the jewellery trade. He now operates a commercial property business in Birmingham.</p>
<p>Mr Brittain recalls old-fashioned sweet jars being filled with tiny coils of metal, a byproduct of engraving cufflinks. The owner of one particular London jeweller that Brittains Marking worked with in the 1980s kept all the engraving scraps that were not requested by customers — Mr Brittain says some clients were indeed savvy enough to ask for theirs back — and cashed it in once a year to fund a cruise aboard the QE2 luxury liner.</p>
<p>This was during what some in the trade call “the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/fashion-blog/2012/apr/02/brief-history-of-brylcreem" data-trackable="link">Brylcreem </a>days”. Jewellery workers were said to slather their hair with that pomade so that they could run their hands, covered in precious metal dust, through it, later retrieving the gold or silver. Mr Brittain has stories of such practices, and Winchester jeweller Jeremy France, whose twice-yearly sweeps at the workshop in his store yield between £6,000 and £8,000 a time, jokingly refers to an industry expression that “we don’t employ people with sweaty hands or turned-up trousers,” both ideal for accumulating valuable dust.</p>
<p>Four flights above the jewellery boutique of <!-- -->David Morris <!-- -->on Bond Street, polisher Dave Wadeson, who has been in the business for 40 years, says he once saw floorboards glittering in a workshop when he was an apprentice.</p>
<p>“When [the workshop] was taken over by Bentley &amp; Skinner, they took up all the floorboards and the amount of lemel embedded in them was incredible — they found piles of fine grain around the edges,” he says.</p>
<p>When Mr Williams worked at wedding ring manufacturer Brown &amp; Newirth, the business moved workshops around 1990 and dismantled its five-storey wooden staircase, which was so impregnated with precious metal that it looked like the “glitter in a marble kitchen top”. It turned out to be worth tens of thousands of pounds — enough to pay for a new staircase and the workshop’s moving costs.</p>
<p>And at Cooksongold, which claims to be the UK’s largest precious metals refiner, processing 25,000 jobs a year, Mr Wibberley recalls when a parquet floor in its own factory was ripped up and the precious metals embedded in the wood made it worth £20 per sq m.</p>
<p>Large jobs like burning floorboards, carpets or benches tend to happen when a jeweller is moving premises or upgrading. There are less extreme options for the interim, such as specialist vacuuming services or sanding down the top layer of benches and processing the wood dust. The challenge is picking up the day-to-day waste, and it is an art that is being constantly refined — particularly by larger manufacturers with the most to gain.</p>

<p>New technology being introduced to these factories is actually increasing waste, requiring even greater efforts to capture it. One British jewellery manufacturer, which did not wish to be named, has invested in sealed milling machines fitted with vacuums to capture the coils and swarf (sawdust-like chips of precious metal) they dispatch at high speeds. Each has a filter that can separate materials as thin as a micron — much narrower than a human hair.</p>
<p>In Birmingham’s Jewellery Quarter is Hockley Mint, a British jewellery manufacturer with a turnover of £12m that produces up to 140,000 pieces a year. Gathering scrap and lemel at its 30,000 sq ft factory requires daily cleaning and collecting, as well as the use of localised vacuums. “One of the things we have put in place that is relatively new is that when workers wash their hands we save the paper towels they dry with,” says managing director Gary Wroe.</p>
<p>“We got £2,000 back in a 12-month period just from the towels, and that goes straight on our bottom line.”</p>

<figure data-component="image-set"><picture><source media="(min-width: 700px)" srcset="https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3A2f6e3480-d991-11e6-944b-e7eb37a6aa8e?source=next-article&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=700&amp;dpr=1 1x,https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3A2f6e3480-d991-11e6-944b-e7eb37a6aa8e?source=next-article&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=700&amp;dpr=2 2x" width="2048" height="1152"><img src="https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fcom.ft.imagepublish.upp-prod-eu.s3.amazonaws.com%2F2f6e3480-d991-11e6-944b-e7eb37a6aa8e?source=next-article&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=700&amp;dpr=1" alt="Gary Wroe MBA Managing Director of  Hockley Mint, Birmingham" data-image-type="image" width="2048" height="1152" loading="lazy"></picture><figcaption><span>Gary Wroe MBA Managing Director of  Hockley Mint, Birmingham</span><span> <!-- -->© Edward Moss</span></figcaption></figure>

<p>Hockley Mint has also upgraded its windows so that blinds are now encased between panes of glass — their fabric panels were a magnet for precious metal dust — and it also has an on-site laundry to process workers’ clothes.</p>
<p>Its biggest investment in precious metal reclamation to date has been an incinerator, which it installed 18 months ago, to melt, but not process, its sweeps. “If you send a bag of material out, you don’t know what’s coming back,” says Mr Wroe, who adds that the value of precious metals it is collecting has increased since taking over its own incinerating.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>His concern is one shared by many in the industry. Looking at the accumulation of sludge from settlement tanks placed beneath sinks, grimy mop heads and all manner of other dirt and waste collected in a sweep, it is impossible to estimate how much money has accrued, although there are ways to guess.</p>
<p>Jewellers expect to lose metal during the production phase and so will plan for it. At David Morris, the target is a maximum loss of 5 per cent, although its craftsmen believe the working figure is 1 per cent or 2 per cent, providing a guide for what could be reclaimed.</p>

<p>Hockley Mint uses scales to give as accurate a forecast as possible. “We measure in and measure out, and keep records so we know approximately what we should get back,” says Mr Wroe.</p>
<p>For others, guesstimates are based on experience, and this can lead to friction between jeweller and refiner when discrepancies arise. “Some people have expectations based on history but they haven’t got a complete understanding of what’s going on,” says Mr Williams. The gold price might have changed, he suggests, or the weight of material being processed could be similar but the contents disparate. “In this industry, trust is a big factor,” he says.</p>
<p>But that trust goes both ways. Sweeps can take weeks to process and refiners will sometimes advance money based on the expected yield, which can give less scrupulous jewellers an opportunity to run a ruse. “I heard a story about a sweep where the processor took the job, gave the customer an advance based on history and when they looked in the sweep bag, the bottom of it was newspapers,” says Mr Williams. </p>
<p>Cooksongold offers its clients advances at its trade counters in London and Birmingham. The business is part of the German Heimerle + Meule group and much of its refining is done at the group’s plants in Spain and Germany. This adds to the processing time, so it will do a pre-melt in London to ascertain what it is sending to Heimerle + Meule.</p>
<p>Processing its own pre-melted metal would be the next stage in Hockley Mint’s reclamation journey, but it is one that Mr Wroe has yet to commit to. “That’s a different skill and we’d have to bring the expertise in, so we’d have to work out whether it would be worth it.”</p>
<p>While Mr Wroe’s approach to reclamation is far more advanced than many other workshops, he is nonetheless resigned to the fact that he will never catch it all. “We have sticky mats at the doors to get the dust off people’s shoes as they leave the building, otherwise the streets of Hockley would be paved with gold,” he sighs. “And the council should definitely check the sewers.”    </p>

            <guid>40972099</guid>
            <pubDate>Mon, 15 Jul 2024 22:41:50 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://github.com/dicksites/KUtrace">https://github.com/dicksites/KUtrace</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40972099">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><pre>KUtrace is an extremely low-overhead Linux kernel tracing facility for observing all 
the execution time on all cores of a multi-core processor, nothing missing, while running 
completely unmodified user programs written in any computer language. It has been used in 
live datacenters (x86 processors) and in real-time autonomous driving (ARM processors) 
to understand long-standing performance mysteries. The design goal of KUtrace is to 
reveal the root cause(s) of unexpected delayed responses in real-time transactions or 
database processing while having such low overhead that it does not distort the system 
under test.

This March 2022 update COMPLETELY REPLACES the previous 2019 repository.

The directory contains files associated with the 2022 book 
Understanding Software Dynamics by Richard L. Sites, ISBN 978-0137589739.

The book-figures directory contains the underlying HTML files for over 100 of
the diagrams in the book, so you can wander around them to see more context or
to discover other performance issues. They work best in the Chrome browser.

The kutrace_user_guide.pdf file gives more detail and is more recent than the 
text in Chapter 19 of the book. Read it to fully use the HTML files.

The hello_world_trace.html file is an example trace of the hello_world_trace.c 
program found in book-user-code.

The book-user-code directory contains all the programs used in the book and the
script to compile them. They compile and run on both x86 and Rpi4 machines.

The linux_patches_installation_guide.pdf gives brief directions for building
the patches.

The loadable-module directory contains the source and Makefile for the companion
kernel module that implements the bulk of KUtrace. It builds for AMD and Intel 
x86 machines and for the Raspberry Pi4-B.

The patches-* files contain original source and patched source pairs of files
for adding KUtrace to three different versions of the Linux operating system.
These files are structured in the matching directories of the original Linux 
source download. The patches-linux-5.10.46-rpi4 folder contains additional 
documentation and useful scripts for building a patched kernel for any of
these three versions or for incorporating the patches into other versions. Only
64-bit versions of Linux are supported in this code; 32-bit ports of KUtrace 
are possible but difficult.

All the code is open sourced, most of it under the BSD three-clause license. The code specific to freebsd uses the BSD2 license, and the code specific to risc-v is licensed under GPL-2.0. The Linux loadable module(s) are required by Linux to be licensed under GPL-2.0.

And they are why the price of generic Gleevec didn’t drop as it should have.</p><p><span>In fact, the concerned executive worked at the parent company of one of these PBMs. He was not worried about the price, but that such a price would look bad, and possibly violate the law. “We've created plan designs to aggressively steer customers to home delivery where the drug cost is ~200 times higher,” he wrote. If you went to Costco, he went on to say, the cost was $97, so the plan didn’t recommend patients go there. If a patient went to Walgreens, which the plan did recommend, it was $9000. And if a patient chose home delivery via the PBMs own mail order pharmacy, it was $19,200. “The optics are not good and must be addressed,” he added. He didn’t need to say that the added revenue for PBMs, just for that one drug, was $902.1 million over a few years. Another drug studied by the FTC, one for prostate cancer called Zytiga, was similarly inflated by an extra $685 million. That’s $1.6 billion for the two of them. Think about all the drugs used in our healthcare system, and that will give you a sense of why healthcare costs keep going up. (Yes, each inflated drug cost is </span><a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/economic-termites-are-everywhere" rel="">an economic termite</a><span>.)</span></p><p>Most people think of high pharmaceutical prices, and blame the companies you’d expect in Big Pharma. These firms, with storied names like Merck, Pfizer, Novartis, Genentech, etc, are powerful, and they are in the business of developing and selling drugs. But this other group, corporations you haven’t heard of, composed entirely of middlemen, price and handle payment for pharmaceuticals between doctors, pharmacies, and patients, are perhaps equally important, if not more so. And unlike pharmaceutical companies, who actually employ doctors and scientists, PBMs don’t do anything difficult. They keep lists.</p><p><span>PBMs are </span><a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/the-red-wedding-for-rural-pharmacies" rel="">a topic</a><span> I’ve covered, mostly as a cause of the disappearance of rural independent pharmacies, but last week, the FTC sparked a big political fight by releasing </span><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/07/ftc-releases-interim-staff-report-prescription-drug-middlemen" rel="">this report</a><span> on the PBM business model. Chair Lina Khan did so with support from one Republican commissioner, Andrew Ferguson, but opposition from another, Melissa Holyoak. The FTC also indicated in the report’s final pages, and the Wall Street Journal </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/health/pharma/ftc-to-sue-drug-managers-over-insulin-prices-b46af71f?mod=hp_lead_pos4" rel="">noted</a><span>, that it was likely to sue PBMs over the high prices they foster for insulin, which could potentially change the entire drug claims system, and bring down prices dramatically. </span></p><p><span>To understand the world of pharma pricing, we have to start at the beginning. In the 1950s and 1960s, pharmaceutical development exploded, as did the health insurance industry. Insurers needed a way to help their patients to easily buy them the new cornucopia of drugs at pharmacies. Enter pharmacy benefit managers, who were claims processors that issued a plastic card to insurance customers, got pharmacies to accept those cards, and tracked the money flows, including reimbursements. PBMs were very similar to Visa and Mastercard, with the very first PBM actually called “</span><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AdvancePCS" rel="">Pharmaceutical Card System</a><span>.”</span></p><p>PBMs soon started to create what are called drug formularies, which are lists of drugs payers will cover, specifying the kind of drugs included and the cost-sharing arrangements. They also put together networks of pharmacies, and began helping design strategies to encourage patients to take the correct medicine for the lowest price, known as utilization management. It was a business to business service. If you’re an employer, a union, a state or Federal government program, and you need drug benefits for a group, you hire a PBM and they set you up with a range of formularies and pharmacy networks. Today, commercial health plans, Medicare drug plans, Medicaid managed care, and affiliated health insurers use PBMs.</p><p><span>But then, several changes shifted the business model. The first was consolidation. From the 1980s to the 2000s, PBMs consolidated both horizontally and vertically, so each big PBM is now owned by a major healthcare conglomerate. CVS owns&nbsp;Caremark, Cigna has Express Scripts and UnitedHealth Group (UHG) runs Optum Rx. (For a case study, see my 2020 piece called “</span><a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/how-cvs-became-a-health-care-tyrant" rel="">How CVS Became a Health Care Tyrant</a><span>.”) There were big acquisitions, like Express Scripts buying Medco in 2012 and CVS buying Aetna in 2018, but smaller ones as well. “According to PitchBook,” the FTC report noted, “these four entities and their subsidiaries (which include the largest PBMs) collectively engaged in more than 190 transactions over the 2016 to 2023 period (UHG, 88; CVS, 53; Humana, 39; and Cigna, 14).”</span></p><p>UHG, for instance, is one of the top PBMs, but it also employs 10% of the doctors in America, is America’s biggest health insurer, runs Optum Bank through which bailout funds during Covid flowed to hospitals, and even owns Change Health, the large payment network for hospitals and pharmacies. More importantly, the big PBMs, while they contract with independent pharmacies, also own their own retail and mail-order pharmacies, thus setting the reimbursement rates for themselves and their competitors. (UHG is a frequent target of medical comedian Dr Glaucomflecken.)</p><div id="youtube2-_khH6pZnHCM" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;_khH6pZnHCM&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:&quot;1s&quot;,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_khH6pZnHCM?start=1s&amp;rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></p></div><p>The other change was the legalization of price discrimination, which fostered an era of secretive pricing. </p><p><span>PBMs had been clerical agents, paid by insurers to negotiate with drug makers, or on a per transaction basis to handle transactions. But in 1987, Congress passed an </span><a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/12/02/2020-26072/medicare-and-state-health-care-programs-fraud-and-abuse-revisions-to-safe-harbors-under-the" rel="">exemption</a><span> to a Medicare Anti-Kickback statute, which created a safe harbor for group buying entities to accept payment from drug manufacturers in the form of rebates, with certain guardrails in place. Enabling kickbacks created a clear conflict of interest, since a PBM is supposed to be negotiating for the buyer, but could now be paid by the seller. The second change was an antitrust </span><a href="https://foleyhoag.com/getattachment/d63b4cbe-7427-49f4-becb-63b6130362fd/FOLEY-HOAG-LLP-WHITEPAPER-Antitrust-Implications-of-a-Proposed-HHS-Rule-to-Limit-Manufacturer-Rebates.pdf?lang=en-US" rel="">suit in 1994</a><span>, where pharmacies sued to get the same discounts for drugs offered to health insurance plans and hospitals. In the settlement of that case, the parties and the judge said that if a buyer was big enough that it could prove it could shift market shares, it was entitled to a secret rebate. And the third was in 1999 when the government used its authority to explicitly say that rebates were permissible legal discounts. Today’s system, where PBMs get large secret rebates in return for allocating market shares, was born. </span></p><p>Today, it’s virtually impossible to get any clear pricing on most drugs, because there is no one price. There are different benchmarks, for instance the one I used above to describe what manufacturers get for selling Gleevec. But there are other benchmarks depending on who you are, such as average wholesale price (AWP), wholesale acquisition cost (WAC), Average Sales Price (ASP), Average Manufacturer Price (AMP), Maximum Allowable Cost (MAC), Usual and Customary (U&amp;C), etc, each of which means something different, and many of which are arbitrary mark-ups designed to make it looks like there are discounts when there aren’t, or to extract extra money from pharmacists or patients.</p><p>Many drug pricing contracts use several of these benchmarks, along with rebates, reimbursements, and fees that are sometimes assessed six months after a point of sale transaction goes through. The endless number of such adjustments make it impossible to know what anything costs. Just one PBM, for instance, has over ten thousand different price lists for drug reimbursement rates, sometimes updated daily, which means the price of a particular drug depends on who you are, when you bought it, other drugs you might have purchased, or what the PBM executive had for lunch. </p><p>Pharmacists are often not allowed to look at the price they would be given for reimbursement prior to submitting a claim because, as one PBM manual notes, "price lists are the PBMs confidential and proprietary information." There are often multiple prices for the same transaction. A drug might seem like it costs $100 at the point of sale for a drug that cost the pharmacist $50, where the patient would pay a $60 copay and the insurer paid $40. But then six months later the PBM will claw back $75 from the pharmacist in what’s called a DIR fee. In that case, because of the copay, the insurer/PBM is actually extracting money from both the patient whose medical costs it should be covering, and the pharmacy it should be reimbursing. The whole system is insane . </p><p>Price discrimination and consolidation weren’t separate phenomena, but drove each other. In fact, if a PBM had to charge the same price for its service to all comers, then it would not matter if a PBM were big; a drug manufacturer negotiating with a PBM would have to give the same price, regardless of size. It also wouldn’t make sense to own its own pharmacy, nor could it charge different amounts for cancer drugs and keep the difference. But the legalization of price discrimination changed the market. And today, there’s really no way to convey how weird this world of pricing is, except that it feels Soviet and arbitrary to everyone in it. </p><p>The legislation of price discrimination happened in areas beyond PBMs and health care, it is perhaps the biggest victory of the law and economic school, and certainly one of the most important legal shifts in our society in the last fifty years, far more impactful than most of the economic fights we hear about.</p><p>Before the 1980s, it had been a fundamental axiom of America that everyone gets access to the same publicly posted price for the same class of service or good. Grangers fought for this principle in the 1870s, populists in the 1880s, business and labor leaders at the 1899 conference on trusts agreed on it even though they disagreed on everything else, it was understood as part of the Sherman Act in 1890, explicitly embedded into the Clayton Act in 1914, written into the Robinson-Patman Act of 1936, and across dozens of statutes across state and Federal government, from railroad to shipping to electric utility rules. </p><p><span>I mean, even the conservative Heritage Foundation advising the Reagan administration in 1981 decried secret rebates and discounting to select customers. “These kinds of discounts seem contrary,” </span><a href="https://www.jcampbell.com/docs-campbell/articles/1981_Mandate_for_Leadership.pdf" rel="">it said</a><span>, “to basic American precepts of justice, as they would “effectively end the value of publicly posted prices” and “favor the large organized interests with competitive alternatives at the expense of the unorganized, uneducated, or captive.” That’s the main policy recommendation to the most conservative Republican President since Herbert Hoover. </span></p><p><span>But starting in the 1970s, economists decided that price discrimination, far from problematic, was actually </span><em>efficient. </em><span>Indeed, if you could charge a high price to the rich, and a low price to the poor, then price discrimination could also be </span><em>progressive. </em><span>What could be wrong with selective discounting, after all? It turns out, plenty, and if you want to understand why, just look at PBMs.</span></p><p>Today, as a result of these changes, PBMs are big. Really big. The parent insurance companies of the biggest PBMs top nearly $1 trillion in revenue annually, roughly 4% of the GDP of America. Just the top four equal 22% of national healthcare expenditures, up from 14% in 2016. And no other country has anything like the PBM industry. The revenue of American PBMs is larger than what France spends on its entire healthcare system.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F170f8bd4-e509-468b-9ea5-27257abb62de_865x422.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F170f8bd4-e509-468b-9ea5-27257abb62de_865x422.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F170f8bd4-e509-468b-9ea5-27257abb62de_865x422.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F170f8bd4-e509-468b-9ea5-27257abb62de_865x422.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F170f8bd4-e509-468b-9ea5-27257abb62de_865x422.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F170f8bd4-e509-468b-9ea5-27257abb62de_865x422.png" width="865" height="422" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/170f8bd4-e509-468b-9ea5-27257abb62de_865x422.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:422,&quot;width&quot;:865,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:82663,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F170f8bd4-e509-468b-9ea5-27257abb62de_865x422.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F170f8bd4-e509-468b-9ea5-27257abb62de_865x422.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F170f8bd4-e509-468b-9ea5-27257abb62de_865x422.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F170f8bd4-e509-468b-9ea5-27257abb62de_865x422.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>The top three PBMs have immense market power. While it looks like an oligopoly, PBMs have monopolies in certain areas. OptumRx, for instance, runs 83% of the South Carolina retail pharmacy network management services, while a different PBM has 85% of the market in Alabama. If you are a company or union that needs to buy prescription drugs or if you are a pharmacist that dispenses prescriptions, you have to run on their rails.</p><p>And they use their size and bulk to thwart rivals. They use information from their insurance arms to conduct marketing campaigns targeting patients of rival pharmacists. They make it easier to buy drugs if you buy them from their mail order pharmacy, a practice known as steering, they impose endless fees on pharmacies, and they also take kickbacks from pharmaceutical manufacturers to steer their patients to more expensive medication and cut off access to cheaper generics. They also go after rival PBMs, with the FTC noting that “Some health insurers reportedly do not permit their clients to comparison shop for PBM services; rather, the client must use the PBM affiliated with the health insurer.” (The giant PBMs also have exclusive contracts with certain pharmaceutical makers, which means that if you don’t use those PBMs you just can’t get critical medicines.) </p><p>The net effect is higher prices. Here, for instance, is a rebate contract for Sanofi’s Lantus, a popular branded insulin. The list price might be high, but that’s not all going to Sanofi. In fact, 63% of that was going to the PBM in the form of a rebate, as long as Lantus is the only insulin offered to the patient. In other words, there’s competition, but not to lower prices to the consumer, but to pay higher rebates to the PBM.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ebc71a7-da5a-45ca-bb0e-7cc51eff637a_692x622.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ebc71a7-da5a-45ca-bb0e-7cc51eff637a_692x622.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ebc71a7-da5a-45ca-bb0e-7cc51eff637a_692x622.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ebc71a7-da5a-45ca-bb0e-7cc51eff637a_692x622.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ebc71a7-da5a-45ca-bb0e-7cc51eff637a_692x622.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ebc71a7-da5a-45ca-bb0e-7cc51eff637a_692x622.png" width="692" height="622" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0ebc71a7-da5a-45ca-bb0e-7cc51eff637a_692x622.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:622,&quot;width&quot;:692,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:331850,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ebc71a7-da5a-45ca-bb0e-7cc51eff637a_692x622.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ebc71a7-da5a-45ca-bb0e-7cc51eff637a_692x622.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ebc71a7-da5a-45ca-bb0e-7cc51eff637a_692x622.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ebc71a7-da5a-45ca-bb0e-7cc51eff637a_692x622.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>It’s not just insulin, of course. Take the most expensive drug historically in America by aggregate revenue, Humira, which made over $22 billion for AbbVie in 2022. It recently lost its patent protection, and there are several generics, known as ‘biosimilars,’ coming into the market. Several drug manufacturers (Coherus, Sandoz, Boehringer Ingelheim, etc.) invested in developing biosimilars to launch when the Humira patent expired.&nbsp; These drugs brought the sticker price of the drug down 10x from $80,000 per year to as low as $8,000 per year.</p><p>But none of these are able to get onto the shelf. Instead, what happened is that CVS started a drug manufacturing company called Cordavis to sell Humira biosimilars to its specialty pharmacy (CVS Specialty). They charge $1,300 per month, compared to some that are less than half that.&nbsp; Since CVS owns a PBM they controlled the formularies - and therefore the drug access - of between a fourth and third of Americans.&nbsp; They directed their PBM to preference their own drug through Cordavis and ignore the other biosimilars available on the market from smaller pharma companies, adding what I’m told is $50-100 million to CVS’s bottom line.</p><p>The negative impacts are twofold. First, consumers have to pay much more for the drug. Second, the pharma companies who invested to make biosimilars suffered financial losses. Here’s the share price of Coherus, which makes a Humira biosimilar.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3377be93-103d-4c79-8d68-ef06be8c181c_1020x454.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3377be93-103d-4c79-8d68-ef06be8c181c_1020x454.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3377be93-103d-4c79-8d68-ef06be8c181c_1020x454.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3377be93-103d-4c79-8d68-ef06be8c181c_1020x454.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3377be93-103d-4c79-8d68-ef06be8c181c_1020x454.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3377be93-103d-4c79-8d68-ef06be8c181c_1020x454.png" width="1020" height="454" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3377be93-103d-4c79-8d68-ef06be8c181c_1020x454.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:454,&quot;width&quot;:1020,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:92975,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3377be93-103d-4c79-8d68-ef06be8c181c_1020x454.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3377be93-103d-4c79-8d68-ef06be8c181c_1020x454.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3377be93-103d-4c79-8d68-ef06be8c181c_1020x454.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3377be93-103d-4c79-8d68-ef06be8c181c_1020x454.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>That means we won’t see any more biosimilar R&amp;D anymore, because everyone knows that PBMs will block them from the market. </p><p><span>For decades, PBMs operated in the shadows. But the passage of Obamacare changed the dynamic of health care, because it capped the profits of health insurance companies. To get out from under this cap, insurers began vertically integrating into different areas, and in the 2010s, every major PBM turned into an arm of a conglomerate. (See “</span><a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/how-obamacare-created-big-medicine" rel="">How Obamacare Created Big Medicine</a><span>”.) Today, there’s an acronym that describes who controls health care. It’s BUCAH, meaning Blue Cross Blue Shield, UHG, Cigna, Aetna and Humana.</span></p><p>And employers started getting angry at high prices. Mark Cuban, for instance, started a pharmacy called Cost Plus Drugs, and is running a high-profile campaign against PBMs.</p><p><span>More importantly, a group in Ohio, a random Wall Street quant named Eric Pachman, a pharmacy lobbyist named Antonio Ciaccia, and a pharmacist named Ben Link began playing around with public pricing data, and realized that government Medicaid programs were getting ripped off by hundreds of billions of dollars a year by PBMs for no reason. They started an organization called </span><a href="https://www.46brooklyn.com/" rel="">46 Brooklyn</a><span>, and their research has led to changes in dozens of states. </span></p><p><span>In 2021, for instance, Kentucky got rid of its use of big PBMs in Medicaid, and </span><a href="https://kentuckylantern.com/2023/10/05/reprieve-for-kentuckys-independent-pharmacies-is-saving-medicaid-millions/" rel="">saved</a><span> $285 million out of $1.2 billion its program spent on prescription drugs. It even led to an attempt by the Trump administration to get rid of the ability of PBMs to engage in certain forms of secret rebating. Academics are </span><a href="https://www.truthrx.org/post/medicare-advantage-and-consolidation-s-new-frontier-the-danger-of-unitedhealthcare-for-all?postId=afb7232b-8664-43c0-b98e-91aaf2bd7599&amp;utm_campaign=47a46941-3eec-4eb8-ae84-dd639d5fabe5&amp;utm_source=so&amp;utm_medium=mail&amp;utm_content=8ec25a53-fe04-4024-8d81-9a9b5e6eeefa&amp;cid=99683573-4c3f-4f8a-b0b4-524e2530a24d" rel="">now focused</a><span> on the problem of vertical integration, and so is Congress. And there have been dozens of PBM-related hearings - the </span><a href="https://www.axios.com/pro/health-care-policy/2024/07/09/pbm-execs-testify-july-23" rel="">next one</a><span> is on July 23 with the CEOs of the ExpressScript, OptumRX, and Caremark - and Congress is closer to passing PBM legislation than it has ever been. </span></p><p><span>For decades, the FTC, far from helping, was on the wrong side of the argument. Its economists had promoted the idea that price discrimination and rebates were good, that vertical integration made sense, that PBM consolidation would help consumers, and that a PBM owning a mail order pharmacy was not a conflict of interest, but was efficient. But in 2021, then-FTC Commissioner Rohit Chopra </span><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/public_statements/1590528/statement_of_commissioner_rohit_chopra_regarding_the_commissions_report_on_pharmacy_benefit_manager.pdf" rel="">shocked</a><span> the commission by attacking his own agency, saying “There is a growing consensus that the Federal Trade Commission’s approach… is not working.” In 2022, the FTC put out a </span><a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/corporate-bribery-just-became-illegal" rel="">policy statement</a><span> saying that the use of rebates by dominant middlemen in the insulin market were a potential legal violation. It also launched the investigation that led to this report.</span></p><p>What’s interesting is that the report is not final, because PBMs would not submit the information the FTC subpoena’d. In fact, some of the PBMs said they would send certain documentation until 2025. It’s a clear run out the clock strategy. The FTC could sue the PBMs to get this information, but it’s not clear that would be faster, and it would eat up litigation resources. And there’s good original information in the report, including the cancer drug analysis overpayment story, which is based on raw claims data. Normally, the commission waits until it has completed its analysis to publish a report, but in this case, the FTC sought to release the interim analysis and publicly name the PBMs as operating as bad faith actors for withholding information. </p><p><span>The politics then flipped. The vote to release the report was 4-1, with the three Democrats seeking to put it out, along with Republican FTC Commissioner Andrew Ferguson. Ferguson not only </span><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/Ferguson-Statement-Pharmacy-Benefit-Managers-Report.pdf" rel="">voted</a><span> to release the report, but said that the FTC should have sued, arguing they weren’t being aggressive enough. His colleague Melissa Holyoak, however, </span><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/cases-proceedings/public-statements/holyoak-statement-on-pharmacy-benefit-managers-report" rel="">dissented</a><span>, and said the report needed economic analysis to show that consumer prices were affected. It was a standard U.S. Chamber of Commerce process-troll, and Holyoak likely thought she would get plaudits for opposing Lina Khan. Instead, at a Congressional hearing, multiple Republican members were annoyed with her, including Rep. Buddy Carter, who is an actual pharmacist that needed to deal with PBMs and understood the problem up close.</span></p><p>A lot of government reports sit on the shelf and gather dust. This one won’t. It’ll lead to litigation by the FTC, and it’ll change litigation and state-level lawmaking happening all over the country around PBMs. It will also affect private markets, as CEOs begin asking why they are paying so much for their pharmaceuticals.

<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>This post or I should say a series of posts, is a result of a kinda (not yet, as it turns out :&gt;) failed <a href="https://retrohax.net/amiga-1000-project-phoenix-motherborad/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amiga 1000 Phoenix upgrade project that I did write about some time ago.</a> </p>
<p>It all looks like this is going to be my longest and most complicated project. It still has a work-in-progress status but I’ve decided to start writing about it because I keep on forgetting the details. I’ve already forgotten a lot, so time to refresh my memory and describe the idea behind the project, the job, and the details of it.</p>
<h2>Codename: Tesseract</h2>
<p>This post will be divided into at least four or maybe even five parts. I already have over 400 pics and we are far from the finish. This project evolves dynamically as there are a lot of problems that I have sorted out, so be prepared for twists and turns.</p>
<p>As I’ve described in <a href="https://retrohax.net/amiga-1000-project-phoenix-motherborad/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A1K Pheonix’s post</a>, MrTrinsic decided that we should try another route and by that he meant, to create a brand new custom Amiga 2000 from scratch, I mean like a TOTAL custom job!!!11!!eleven!!!!.</p>
<p>The brand new mobo, case, and tons of add-ons – brand new and old. At first, I didn’t realize how hard it might be but hey! this is why challenges are cool! am I right? So like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCE5dIscvDxrb7CD5uiJJOiw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Adrian says</a> … Let’s get right to it!</p>
<h2>The plan</h2>
<p>The plan was to make a fully working A2000 mobo from a scratch, meaning, to get a brand new PCB, solder it all up and make it work. That was my first task, which turned out to be quite easy but also time-consuming. As a bonus, it was also a very relaxing experience. </p>
<p>MrTrinsic RULEZ! He proactively searches and sends all gear directly to me which makes the whole job way easier so we are working on this project as a team and that saves a lot of time. Did I mention that this project is over a year and keeps on going lol?!</p>
<p>Let’s leave the case for now and focus on a motherboard build.</p>
<h2>The marvelous MOBO</h2>
<p>As I said, MrTrinsic sends/orders the majority of the gear needed for this project directly to me. I didn’t have to wait long for a brand new A2000 PCB to show at my doorstep.</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://retrohax.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/UZ0XlbM-1.jpg" alt=""></figure>
<p>This is a PCB that was made brand new, based on an awesome rev-eng job done by <a href="https://github.com/Floppie209/Amiga2000-remake" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Floppie209</a></p>
<p>Shortly after receiving a PCB, I started to order parts like crazy. However, I did a mistake as I wanted to lower costs too much and I ordered parts from different shops. Now I know that I should’ve ordered all the parts from one, but big supplier as it reduces waiting time to a minimum.</p>
<p>Anyways, candies started to show up.</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://retrohax.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Wi1fGRd-1.jpg" alt=""></figure>
<p>There are a lot of parts that need proper bending so I’ve figured that I’ll 3D print a tool for it.</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://retrohax.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/XqJKEJW-1.png" alt=""></figure>
<h2>Soldering</h2>
<p>From now on, that was just a matter of bending parts and putting ’em in the place.</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://retrohax.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Qxs1dcy-1.jpg" alt=""></figure>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://retrohax.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/9WnzsSo-1.jpg" alt=""></figure>
<p>I’ve figured out that using paper paint tape to hold components in place makes the job way easier.</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://retrohax.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/FwnaYft-1.jpg" alt=""></figure>

<p>Some fails along soldering were introduced too 😀 Sorted out later, so no worries 😉 </p>
<p>Always remember!! – DO READ <strong>readme.txt</strong> and documentation 😀</p>

<p>Now, to a <strong>great</strong> FAT AGNUS problem (you’ll see why this is important soon and in future posts too)</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://retrohax.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/obmNvRZ-1.jpg" alt=""></figure>
<p>For now, just a teaser … Cheers rj1307!! 🙂</p>

<p>Some spare parts from a dead, donor A500 mobo + new sockets and ports</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://retrohax.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/LceHMdk-1.jpg" alt=""></figure>
<h2>The PSU</h2>
<p>Ok, so with the majority of passives in place, I could start working on the PSU. The first idea was to use a cool ATX to AMIGA adapter that I’ve already used in the <a href="https://retrohax.net/amiga-1000-project-phoenix-motherborad/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A1K Phoenix project</a>. I just had to rewire everything to match the A2000s power socket.</p>

<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://retrohax.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sZOBtcR-1.jpg" alt=""></figure>
<p>For those who are having trouble with figuring out the above wiring, here is how it goes:</p>
<p>From the top:</p>
<ul>
<li>RED – +5V</li>
<li>BLACK – GND</li>
<li>YELLOW – +12V</li>
<li>SPACE</li>
<li>BLUE – -12V</li>
<li>ORANGE – +5V user</li>
<li>GREEN – -5V</li>
<li>WHITE – TICK signal</li>
</ul>
<p>Testing time! … without custom chips!</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://retrohax.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/KUBdM3i-1.png" alt=""></figure>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://retrohax.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/T5lK7FJ-1.jpg" alt=""></figure>
<h2>Custom chips</h2>
<p>Now, with passives in place and successfully tested without a magic smoke, I could move on to testing the setup with custom chips.</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://retrohax.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/z9gB7Or-1.jpg" alt=""></figure>
<p>I wanted to make a quartz resonator replaceable so I’ve come up with an idea to cut a precision DIP socket proper size and remove unnecessary pins. This allows you to easily replace the part without serious soldering hassle. On the left, pins were removed.</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://retrohax.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/cETsdyM-1.png" alt=""></figure>

<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://retrohax.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/v0BltMJ-1.png" alt=""></figure>
<p>The next piece needed to run the whole unit was to install a FAT AGNUS chip. MrTrinsic wanted this Amiga to have 2MB of CHIP RAM. This was supposed to be done by a mod installation. There were some problems (as usual:) introduced. The first problem was a capacitor collision but that was easily sorted out by resoldering it.</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://retrohax.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/XPKi1A3-1.png" alt=""></figure>
<p>The second problem was that this mod didn’t work with this mobo … sadly, I’ve figured that out after soldering it on …</p>
<p>I had to desolder it, and that’s when problems started. Turns out (no shit Sherlock) that it is kinda hard to desolder standard gold pins from a brand new, gold-plated motherboard.</p>

<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://retrohax.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/XZqQLzC-1.jpg" alt=""></figure>
<p>No worries, the module was brutally removed but was rescued afterward and will be used in another project 🙂</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://retrohax.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/qwE01tH-1.jpg" alt=""></figure>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://retrohax.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2DhSEBn-1.png" alt=""></figure>
<p>Anyway, I had to install a standard PLCC socket and put a regular FAT AGNUS in it just to test if it all works.</p>
<p> Aaaaaaand…</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://retrohax.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/XOl5BvJ-1.png" alt=""></figure>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://retrohax.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Y0jzZVN-1.jpg" alt=""></figure>
<p><strong>It worked!!! YAY!</strong></p>
<h2>The Case</h2>
<p>Now, with a working mobo as a base, I could move on to early measurements of a case.</p>
<p>MrTrinsic figured out that we should be OK with “such a large” case for A2000</p>
<p>However, there were a lot of things that had to be sorted out first to make it all happen.</p>
<p>The case that MrTrinsic picked is TF5 type. It was sold by Karma Digital, Omaura, and Aumro.</p>
<p>Here is how it looks.</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://retrohax.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/kDvTKuj-1.png" alt=""></figure>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://retrohax.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/VDYF4ij-1.png" alt=""></figure>
<p>I didn’t waste time and I started working on it. One of the first things that had to be done was to remove all those studs designed for PC motherboards.</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://retrohax.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2gXg4El-1.png" alt=""></figure>
<p>The first measurements followed quickly.</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://retrohax.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/h2yegmV-1.jpg" alt=""></figure>
<p>It quickly turned out that I can work on some improvements by simply cutting off the tips of screws to save 2mm of space. </p>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://retrohax.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/AHxnPLb-1.png" alt=""></figure>
<p>That task was sorted out by the Dremmel-like tool. I’ve also removed other minor obstacles along with screw tips.</p>

<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://retrohax.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/h0VeuAS-1.png" alt=""></figure>
<p>With everything flatted out, I could start working on new mount points for a freshly made A2000 mobo.</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://retrohax.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/jNqujAF-1.png" alt=""></figure>
<p>After a while …</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://retrohax.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/QmlBOLh-1.jpg" alt=""></figure>
<h2>Isolation</h2>
<p>I first made a template out of cardboard and used it to carve a proper polyethylene sheet to place it underneath a mobo as a separator.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>Picture this: It's ten years ago, and you've just launched a new WordPress blog. Within hours, sometimes even minutes, your content is indexed by Google. You search for a unique sentence from your latest post, and there it is, right on the first page of Google. It felt like magic, didn't it?</p>
<p>This was Google living up to its mission: "to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible." For users, it meant that if the information existed somewhere on the web, a bit of clever searching would unearth it. For content creators, it was a golden opportunity: create content, and Google will make sure it's found.</p>
<h2>The SEO Arms Race and Google's Response</h2>
<p>But where there's opportunity, there's also exploitation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Low-quality content flooding the web</li>
<li>Link buying and selling</li>
<li>Lots of grey and black hat SEO stuff</li>
</ul>
<p>Google introduced a series of algorithm updates, each more sophisticated than the last. Panda, Penguin, and their successors aimed to clean up what Google saw as manipulative SEO practices.</p>
<p>This wasn't a one-time event, but more like a two-decade-long dance between SEOs and Google. Each side continually adapted, with Google rolling out updates and SEOs finding new ways to optimize within (and sometimes outside) the guidelines.</p>
<h2>The Rise and Fall of "Content is King"</h2>
<p>Amid this ongoing battle between SEOs and Google, a new mantra emerged in the industry: "Content is King". This concept had two main aspects:</p>
<ol>
<li>Good content will naturally attract links and possibly generate positive user interaction signals, which could improve rankings.</li>
<li>Google's algorithms would inherently value and rank high-quality content.</li>
</ol>
<p>The idea was that by focusing on creating great content, websites could improve their SEO without resorting to more technical or potentially manipulative tactics.</p>
<p>However, this concept was never fully true. Many creators of genuinely good content never achieved the rankings they felt they deserved, showing that quality alone wasn't enough. At the same time, it wasn't entirely false either - good content did often perform well in search results.</p>
<p>One of the fundamental issues was that neither Google nor anyone else could algorithmically determine "good" content.</p>
<p>The mantra served as a useful simplification for SEOs and content creators, giving them a clear goal to aim for. It was also a convenient explanation for Google when SEOs delved too deeply into technical details - they could always fall back on "just create good content".</p>
<h2>The AI Content Revolution</h2>
<p>Fast forward to 2018. OpenAI releases GPT-1, and suddenly, the future of content creation becomes crystal clear. AI-generated content, indistinguishable from human-written text, is on the horizon. The "content is king" era is coming to an end.</p>
<h2>Google's Existential Crisis</h2>
<p>Now, put yourself in Google's shoes. You're facing a future where AI can generate infinite amounts of human-like content. What do you do?</p>
<p>Google's response was twofold:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Promote the vague concept of E-A-T (Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness). In practice, this translates to favoring well-known brands and established websites.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abandon the mission of indexing everything. Instead, become selective. Very selective.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>The New Reality: Selective Indexing</h2>
<p>This brings us to the current state of affairs: Google is no longer trying to index the entire web. In fact, it's become extremely selective, refusing to index most content. This isn't about content creators failing to meet some arbitrary standard of quality. Rather, it's a fundamental change in how Google approaches its role as a search engine.</p>
<p>From my experience, Google now seems to operate on a "default to not index" basis. It only includes content in its index when it perceives a genuine need. This decision appears to be based on various factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Extreme content uniqueness: It's not enough to write about something that isn't extensively covered. Google seems to require content to be genuinely novel or fill a significant gap in its index.</li>
<li>Perceived authority: Sites that Google considers highly authoritative in their niche may have more content indexed, but even then, it's not guaranteed.</li>
<li>Brand recognition: Well-known brands often see most of their content indexed, while small or unknown bloggers face much stricter selectivity.</li>
<li>Temporary indexing and de-indexing: In practice, Google often indexes new content quite quickly, likely to avoid missing out on breaking news or important updates. Soon after, Google may de-index the content, and it remains de-indexed thereafter. So getting initially indexed isn't necessarily a sign that Google considers your content valuable.</li>
</ul>
<p>I've observed this shift firsthand. In the past, when I set up a new domain, it would be indexed within an hour or faster, sometimes in seconds. This was true even for brand new domains with no mentions anywhere and no backlinks. When I searched for the title of one of those brand new blog posts or some unique sentence from the article, it would be right there on the first Google page.</p>
<p>Now, for each piece of content, Google decides if it's worth indexing, and more often than not, the answer seems to be "no." They might index content they perceive as truly unique or on topics that aren't covered at all. But if you write about a topic that Google considers even remotely addressed elsewhere, they likely won't index it. This can happen even if you're a well-respected writer with a substantial readership.</p>
<p>Interestingly, I've noticed that when content does manage to get indexed, it often ranks surprisingly well. It's as if the hurdle of getting indexed has become so high that once you clear it, you're already most of the way to ranking. However, getting to that point has become exponentially more difficult.</p>
<p>Importantly, this extreme selectivity isn't applied equally. Big, recognized brands often see most of their content indexed quickly, while small bloggers or niche websites face a much higher bar for inclusion. For these smaller players, it's not just about creating good content anymore – it's about convincing Google that your content is absolutely necessary for their index.</p>
<h2>The Consequences</h2>
<p>Google has transformed from a comprehensive search engine into something more akin to an exclusive catalog.</p>
<p>For users, it means that the information they're looking for might exist but remain undiscoverable through Google.</p>
<p>I'm sure that a vast amount of valuable content is being overlooked. Information that you might search for may never appear in Google's results. Not because it doesn't exist, but because Google has chosen not to include it.</p>
<p>For content creators, it presents a significant challenge: how do you gain visibility if Google refuses to index most of your content?</p>
