<p>When you have an outage caused by a performance issue, you don't want to lose precious time just to install the tools needed to diagnose it. Here is a list of "crisis tools" I recommend installing on your Linux servers by default (if they aren't already), along with the (Ubuntu) package names that they come from:</p>

<ul><table>
<tbody><tr><th>Package</th><th>Provides</th><th>Notes</th></tr>
<tr><td>procps</td><td>ps(1), vmstat(8), uptime(1), top(1)</td><td>basic stats</td></tr>
<tr><td>util-linux</td><td>dmesg(1), lsblk(1), lscpu(1)</td><td>system log, device info</td></tr>
<tr><td>sysstat</td><td>iostat(1), mpstat(1), pidstat(1), sar(1)</td><td>device stats</td></tr>
<tr><td>iproute2</td><td>ip(8), ss(8), nstat(8), tc(8)</td><td>preferred net tools</td></tr>
<tr><td>numactl</td><td>numastat(8)</td><td>NUMA stats</td></tr>
<tr><td>tcpdump</td><td>tcpdump(8)</td><td>Network sniffer</td></tr>
<tr><td>linux-tools-common<br>linux-tools-$(uname -r)</td><td>perf(1), turbostat(8)</td><td>profiler and PMU stats</td></tr>
<tr><td>bpfcc-tools (bcc)</td><td>opensnoop(8), execsnoop(8), runqlat(8), softirqs(8),<br>hardirqs(8), ext4slower(8), ext4dist(8), biotop(8),<br>biosnoop(8), biolatency(8), tcptop(8), tcplife(8),<br>trace(8), argdist(8), funccount(8), profile(8), etc.</td><td>canned eBPF tools[1]</td></tr>
<tr><td>bpftrace</td><td>bpftrace, basic versions of opensnoop(8),<br>execsnoop(8), runqlat(8), biosnoop(8), etc.</td><td>eBPF scripting[1]</td></tr>
<tr><td>trace-cmd</td><td>trace-cmd(1)</td><td>Ftrace CLI</td></tr>
<tr><td>nicstat</td><td>nicstat(1)</td><td>net device stats</td></tr>
<tr><td>ethtool</td><td>ethtool(8)</td><td>net device info</td></tr>
<tr><td>tiptop</td><td>tiptop(1)</td><td>PMU/PMC top</td></tr>
<tr><td>cpuid</td><td>cpuid(1)</td><td>CPU details</td></tr>
<tr><td>msr-tools</td><td>rdmsr(8), wrmsr(8)</td><td>CPU digging</td></tr>
</tbody></table></ul>

<p>(This is based on Table 4.1 "Linux Crisis Tools" in <a href="https://www.brendangregg.com/systems-performance-2nd-edition-book.html">SysPerf 2</a>.)</p>

<ul><span size="-1">Some longer notes: [1] bcc and bpftrace have many overlapping tools: the bcc ones are more capable (e.g., CLI options), and the bpftrace ones can be edited on the fly. But that's not to say that one is better or faster than the other: They emit the same BPF bytecode and are equally fast once running. Also note that bcc is evolving and migrating tools from Python to libbpf C (with CO-RE and BTF) but we haven't reworked the package yet. In the future "bpfcc-tools" should get replaced with a much smaller "libbpf-tools" package that's just tool binaries.</span></ul>

<p>This list is a minimum. Some servers have accelerators and you'll want their analysis tools installed as well: e.g., on Intel GPU servers, the intel-gpu-tools package; on NVIDIA, nvidia-smi. Debugging tools, like gdb(1), can also be pre-installed for immediate use in a crisis.</p>

<p>Essential analysis tools like these don't change that often, so this list may only need updating every few years. If you think I missed a package that is important today, please let me know (e.g., in the comments).</p>

<p>The main downside of adding these packages is their on-disk size. On cloud instances, adding Mbytes to the base server image can add seconds, or fractions of a second, to instance deployment time. Fortunately the packages I've listed are mostly quite small (and bcc will get smaller) and should cost little size and time. I have seen this size concern prevent debuginfo (totaling around 1 Gbyte) from being included by default.</p>

<h2>Can't I just install them later when needed?</h2>

<p>Many problems can occur when trying to install software during a production crisis. I'll step through a made-up example that combines some of the things I've learned the hard way:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>4:00pm</strong>: Alert! Your company's site goes down. No, some people say it's still up. Is it up? It's up but too slow to be usable.</li>
<li><strong>4:01pm</strong>: You look at your monitoring dashboards and a group of backend servers are abnormal. Is that high disk I/O? What's causing that?</li>
<li><strong>4:02pm</strong>: You SSH to one server to dig deeper, but SSH takes forever to login.</li>
<li><strong>4:03pm</strong>: You get a login prompt and type "iostat -xz 1" for basic disk stats to begin with. There is a long pause, and finally "Command 'iostat' not found...Try: sudo apt install sysstat". Ugh. Given how slow the system is, installing this package could take several minutes. You run the install command.</li>
<li><strong>4:07pm</strong>: The package install has failed as it can't resolve the repositories. Something is wrong with the /etc/apt configuration. Since the server owners are now in the SRE chatroom to help with the outage, you ask: "how do you install system packages?" They respond "We never do. We only update our app." Ugh. You find a different server and copy its working /etc/apt config over.</li>
<li><strong>4:10pm</strong>: You need to run "apt-get update" first with the fixed config, but it's miserably slow.</li>
<li><strong>4:12pm</strong>: ...should it really be taking this long??</li>
<li><strong>4:13pm</strong>: apt returned "failed: Connection timed out." Maybe this system is too slow with the performance issue? Or can't it connect to the repos? You begin network debugging and ask the server team: "Do you use a firewall?" They say they don't know, ask the network security team.</li>
<li><strong>4:17pm</strong>: The network security team have responded: Yes, they have blocked any unexpected traffic, including HTTP/HTTPS/FTP outbound apt requests. Gah. "Can you edit the rules right now?" "It's not that easy." "What about turning off the firewall completely?" "Uh, in an emergency, sure."</li>
<li><strong>4:20pm</strong>: The firewall is disabled. You run apt-get update again. It's slow, but works! Then apt-get install, and...permission errors. What!? I'm root, this makes no sense. You share your error in the SRE chatroom and someone points out: Didn't the platform security team make the system <em>immutable</em>?</li>
<li><strong>4:24pm</strong>: The platform security team are now in the SRE chatroom explaining that some parts of the file system can be written to, but others, especially for executable binaries, are blocked. Gah! "How do we disable this?" "You can't, that's the point. You'd have to create new server images with it disabled." </li>
<li><strong>4:27pm</strong>: By now the SRE team has announced a major outage and informed the executive team, who want regular status updates and an ETA for when it will be fixed. Status: Haven't done much yet.</li>
<li><strong>4:30pm</strong>: You start running "cat /proc/diskstats" as a rudimentary iostat(1), but have to spend time reading the Linux source (admin-guide/iostats.rst) to make sense of it. It just confirms the disks are busy which you knew anyway from the monitoring dashboard. You really need the disk and file system tracing tools, like biosnoop(8), but you can't install them either. Unless you can hack up rudimentary tracing tools as well...You "cd /sys/kernel/debug/tracing" and start looking for the FTrace docs.</li>
<li><strong>4:55pm</strong>: New server images finally launch with all writable file systems. You login – gee it's fast – and "apt-get install sysstat". Before you can even run iostat there are messages in the chatroom: "Website's back up! Thanks! What did you do?" "We restarted the servers but we haven't fixed anything yet." You have the feeling that the outage will return exactly 10 minutes after you've fallen asleep tonight.</li>
<li><strong>12:50am</strong>: Ping! I knew this would happen. You get out of bed and open your work laptop. The site is down – it's been hacked – someone disabled the firewall and file system security.</li>
</ul>

<p>I've fortunately not experienced the 12:50am event, but the others are based on real world experiences. In my prior job this sequence can often take a different turn: a "traffic team" may initiate a cloud region failover by about the 15 minute mark, so I'd eventually get iostat installed but then these systems would be idle.</p>

<h2>Default install</h2>

<p>The above scenario explains why you ideally want to pre-install crisis tools so you can start debugging a production issue quickly during an outage. Some companies already do this, and have OS teams that create custom server images with everything included. But there are many sites still running default versions of Linux that learn this the hard way. I'd recommend Linux distros add these crisis tools to their enterprise Linux variants, so that companies large and small can hit the ground running when performance outages occur.</p>

<p>Yesterday, a team of specialists of the National Institute of Anthropology and History of Mexico, led by the historians Baltazar Brito Guadarrama and María Castañeda de la Paz, the philologist Michel Oudijk, and the Nahuatl specialist Rafael Tena, presented to the public the discovery of three new Aztec codices, collectively known as the Codices of San Andrés Tetepilco, formerly a part of the Culhuacan polity of Central Mexico, and nowadays located within the Iztapalapa borough in Mexico City. This is one of the most exciting and spectacular discoveries regarding codical sources in recent years, and is no doubt closely related to the topic of this blog. The discovery has been already covered by the <a href="https://www.jornada.com.mx/2024/03/21/cultura/a03n1cul">Mexican press</a> and explained in detail in yesterday’s presentation at the National Museum of Anthropology in Mexico City, which can be seen in Youtube. However, an English summary will be presented for the readers of this blog.</p>



<figure><p><span><iframe width="739" height="416" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fw6Z4D7VecA?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox"></iframe></span>
</p></figure>



<p>The newly discovered corpus was acquired by the Mexican government from a local family that wants to remain anonymous, but which were not collectors but rather traditional stewards of the cultural legacy of Culhuacan and Iztapalapa, and it is now stored at the library of the National Institute of Anthropology and History of Mexico. It comprises three codices. The first is called <em>Map of the Founding of Tetepilco</em>, and is a pictographic map which contains information regarding the foundation of San Andrés Tetepilco, as well as lists of toponyms to be found within Culhuacan, Tetepilco, Tepanohuayan, Cohuatlinchan, Xaltocan and Azcapotzalco. The second, the <em>Inventory of the Church of San Andrés Tetepilco</em>,  is unique, as Oudijk remarks, since it is a pictographic inventory of the church of San Andrés Tetepilco, comprising two pages. Sadly, it is very damaged. </p>



<p>Finally, the third document, now baptised as the <em>Tira of San Andrés Tetepilco</em>, is a pictographic history in the vein of the Boturini and the Aubin codices, comprising historical information regarding the Tenochtitlan polity from its foundation to the year 1603. It seems to belong to the same family as the Boturini, the Aubin, the Ms. 40 and the Ms. 85 of Paris, that is to say, some of the main codices dealing with Aztec imperial history, and Brito considers it as a sort of bridge between the Boturini and the Aubin, since its pictographic style is considerably close to the early colonial one of the former, rather than the late colonial one of the latter. It comprises 20 rectangular pages of amate paper, and contains new and striking iconography, including a spectacular depiction of Hernán Cortés as a Roman soldier. In the Aztec side of things, new iconography of Moctezuma Ilhuicamina during his conquest of Tetepilco is presented (Figure 1).</p>

Codices of San Andrés Tetepilco: a) Map of the Founding of San Andrés Tetepilco; b) Inventory of the Church of San Andrés Tetepilco; c) <em>Tira </em>of San Andrés Tetepilco </figcaption></figure>



<p>Of course, new and very interesting examples of Aztec writing are contained throughout all these documents, including old and new toponyms, spellings of Western and Aztec names, and even some information that confirms that some glyphs formerly considered as hapax, as the <strong>chi </strong>syllabogram in the spelling of the name Motelchiuhtzin in Codex Telleriano-Remensis 43r, discussed in <a href="https://tlacuilolli.com/2022/02/16/a-christian-prayer-in-aztec-hieroglyphs-an-epigraphic-analysis/">another </a>post of this blog, were not anomalous but possibly conventional. Besides logosyllabic spellings, the presence of pictographs with alphabetic glosses in Nahuatl will be of great help to ascertain the functioning of this still controversial part of the Aztec communication system.</p>



<p>In any case, the author of this blog remains expectant of the future digital and physical publication of the Codices by Baltazar Brito’s team of experts, promised yesterday, and congratulate them for their breakthrough discovery. Cheers for Aztec writing and its everlasting cultural legacy!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><span>A</span>s a writer on physics, I’m always seeking new metaphors for understanding Einstein’s general theory of relativity, and while working on my last book, <i>Spooky Action at a Distance</i>, I thought I’d compare the warping of space and time to the motion of Earth’s tectonic plates. Einstein explained gravity as the bending of spacetime. A well-hit baseball arcs through the air to an outfielder’s glove because it is following the contours of spacetime, which the planet’s mass has resculpted. The mutability of spacetime also means that nothing in the universe has a fixed position, since the framework by which position is defined is fluid. And something like that is also true of Earth’s surface. Nothing on the ground has fixed coordinates because the landscape is ever-shifting.</p><p>But then it struck me: If nothing has fixed coordinates, then how do Google Maps, car nav systems, and all the other mapping services get you where you’re going? Presumably they must keep updating the coordinates of places, but how?  I figured I’d Google the answer quickly and get back to Einstein, yet a search turned up remarkably little on the subject. So, as happens distressingly often in my life, what I thought would take 30 seconds ended up consuming several days. I discovered a sizable infrastructure of geographers, geologists, and geodesists dedicated to ensuring that maps are accurate. But they are always a step behind the restless landscape. Geologic activity can create significant errors in the maps on your screens.</p>

<figure><img decoding="async" alt="" src="https://assets.nautil.us/16781_18dabb99ce171ea5a317521425d5c206.png"><figcaption><strong>HOUSEQUAKE:</strong> This screenshot represented my position in Google Maps while I was standing on my back deck. When I go to Google Earth and compare images taken on different dates, I find that my house jumps around by as much as 20 meters.</figcaption></figure><p>One of the people I talked to was Ken Hudnut of the United States Geological Survey, an earthquake researcher who had set up one of the first GPS networks to track plate motions. “Say that you’re standing right in the middle of a road intersection with your GPS receiver and you get the coordinates for your position,” he said. “You look at Google Earth, and instead of being located right at the middle of the road intersection, you’re off by some amount.” Several factors produce these errors. Consumer GPS units have a position uncertainty of several meters or more (represented by a circle in Google Maps). Less well known is that maps and satellite images are typically misaligned by a comparable amount. “It’s partly the GPS hardware that limits the accuracy, and part of it may also be the quality of the georeferencing,” Hudnut said. </p>
<p>An interesting, if dated, study from 2008<sup>1</sup> looked at Google Earth images in 31 cities in the developed world and found position errors ranging from 1 to 50 meters. It’s not hard to do your own experiments. The image above shows my position in Google Maps while I was standing on my back deck—a discrepancy of about 10 meters, much larger than the stated error circle. When I go to Google Earth and compare images taken on different dates, I find that my house jumps around by as much as 20 meters.</p><blockquote>
<p>If you’d been paying attention, you would have woken up to find that your house wasn’t at the same latitude and longitude anymore.</p>
</blockquote><p>In the grand scheme of things, this isn’t much, but does make you wary of high zoom levels. Hudnut said he sees map bloopers in his field work all the time. As technology progresses, so will we all. “We’re fast approaching the day when people will expect accuracies of centimeters in real time out of their handheld devices and then we’ll see a lot of head scratching as things no longer line up,” said Dru Smith of the National Geodetic Survey in Silver Spring, Maryland, the nation’s civilian chief geodesist—the go-to guy on the precise shape and size of our planet. </p><p>For the most part, misalignments don’t represent real geologic changes, but occur because it’s tricky to plop an aerial or orbital image onto the latitude and longitude grid. The image has to be aligned with reference points established on the ground. For this purpose, NGS maintains a network of fixed GPS stations and, over the past two centuries, has sprinkled the land with survey marks—typically, metallic disks mounted on exposed bedrock, concrete piers, and other fixed structures. The photo below shows one near my house. But the process of ground-truthing a map is never perfect. Moreover, the survey-mark coordinates can be imprecise or downright wrong.</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" alt="" src="https://assets.nautil.us/16768_ead8e65817265dd1346c3d2b2ba251c5.png"><figcaption><strong>X DOESN’T QUITE MARK THE SPOT:</strong> A National Geodetic Survey mark (above) near my house. Its coordinates can be imprecise or wrong.</figcaption></figure><p>NGS and other agencies recheck survey marks only very infrequently, so what a stroke of luck that a community of hobbyists—geocachers—does so for fun. “One of the many things we no longer have money to do is send out people to make sure those marks are still there,” Smith said. “Geocachers, through this creation of a new recreation of going out and finding these marks, are sending in tons of reports. … It’s been helpful to us to keep the mark recoveries up to date.”</p><p>Errors also sneak in because the latitude and longitude grid (or “datum”) is not god-given, but has to be pegged to a model of the planet’s shape. This is where plate tectonics can make itself felt. Confusingly, the U.S. uses two separate datums. Most maps are based on NAD 83, developed by NGS. Google Maps and GPS rely instead on WGS 84, maintained by a parallel military agency, which has a considerably larger budget. The civilian one is optimized for surveying within North America; the military one sacrifices domestic precision for global coverage.</p><p>When NGS introduced NAD 83, replacing an older datum that dated to 1927, it was the geographic version of the shift from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar. If you’d been paying attention, you would have woken up on Dec. 6, 1988, to find that your house wasn’t at the same latitude and longitude anymore. The shift, as large as 100 meters, reflected a more accurate model of Earth’s shape. Vestiges of the old datum linger. You still see maps based on NAD 27. Also, when the U.S. Navy developed the first satellite navigation system in the 1960s, engineers set the location of zero degrees longitude by extrapolating the old North American datum. Only later did they discover they had drawn the meridian about 100 meters east of the historic Prime Meridian marker at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich.</p>
<p>NGS and its military opposite number worked together to align their respective datums, but the two systems have drifted apart since then, creating a mismatch between maps and GPS coordinates. Plate tectonics is one reason. WGS 84 is a global standard tied to no one plate. In essence, it is fixed to Earth’s deep interior. Geodesists seeking to disentangle latitude and longitude from the movements of any one particular plate assume that tectonic plates are like interlocking gears—when one moves, all do—and that, if you add up all their rotational rates, they should sum to zero. The effect of not tying coordinates to one plate is that surveyed positions, and the maps built upon them, change over time.</p><p>In contrast, NAD 83 sits atop the North American plate like a fishnet laid out on the deck of a boat. As the plate moves, so does the datum. Other regions of the world likewise have their own local datums. That way, drivers can find their way and surveyors can draw their property lines in blissful ignorance of large-scale tectonic and polar motion. “Most surveyors and mapmakers would be happy to live in a world where the plates don’t move,” Smith explained. “We can’t fix that, but we can fix the datum so that the effect is not felt by the predominant number of users. … Generally speaking, a point in Kansas with a certain latitude and longitude this year had that exact same latitude and longitude 10 years ago or 10 years from now. … We try to make the planet non-dynamic.”</p><p>To deepen the datum discrepancy, NAD 83 has not been revamped to account for improved knowledge of Earth’s shape and size. “We are currently working with a system that is very self-consistent and very internally precise, but we know, for example, that the (0,0,0) coordinate of NAD 83, which should be the center of the Earth, is off by about two meters,” Smith said. The tradeoff for keeping surveyors happy is that the North American latitude and longitude grid is increasingly out of sync with the rest of the world (as shown in this diagram below, in which you can see how the North American plate is rotating about a point in the Yucatán). NGS plans an update in 2022, which will shift points on the continent by a meter or more.</p><figure><img decoding="async" alt="" src="https://assets.nautil.us/16769_48229fd6aa4328151e40bda429d8e182.png"><figcaption><span><strong>CHANGES IN LATITUDE:</strong> This diagram reveals how the North American latitude and longitude grid is increasingly out of sync with the rest of the world.</span><span>Courtesy of Michael Dennis of the National Geodetic Survey</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The “rest of the world” includes Southern California, which straddles the North American and Pacific plates. The Pacific plate creeps a couple of inches toward the northwest every year relative to the rest of North America. The plate boundary is not sharp, so the actual amount of movement varies in a complicated way. The California Spatial Reference Center in La Jolla has a network of tracking stations and periodically updates the coordinates of reference points in the state. “That’s what the surveyors then use to tie themselves into NAD 83,” said the center’s director, Yehuda Bock. The last update was in 2018.</p><p>Like Smith, Bock says that more frequent updating would actually complicate matters: “Surveyors do not like it if coordinates change, so this is kind of a compromise.” For localized line-drawing, it doesn’t much matter, but large-scale projects such as the California high-speed rail system have to keep up with tectonic motion.</p><p>Things obviously get more interesting during earthquakes. “What the earthquake would do is the equivalent of what you do with a pair of scissors, if you cut diagonally across a map along a fault line and then slid one side of the map with respect to the other,” Hudnut said. For instance, in Google Earth, go to the following coordinates north of Palm Springs, near the epicenter of the 1992 Landers quake: 34.189838 degrees, –116.433842 degrees. Bring up the historical imagery, compare the July 1989 and May 1994 images, and you’ll see a lateral shift along the fault that runs from the top left to the bottom right of the frame. The alignment of Aberdeen Road, which crosses the fault, shifts noticeably. The quake displaced the land near the fault by several meters.</p><p>GPS networks can even see earthquakes in real time. A dramatic video of the 2011 Tohoku quake, made by Ronni Grapenthin at the University of California, Berkeley based on data from the Japanese Geospatial Information Authority, shows the coastline near the quake site move horizontally by as much as 4 meters. The video also shows the waves that rippled outward over Japan (and indeed the world).</p>

I spoke with Kari Craun, who, as director of the USGS National Geospatial Technical Operations Center near St. Louis, is in charge of producing the USGS topographic maps beloved of outdoors enthusiasts. She says the maps are updated every three years (and even that pace has been hard to maintain with budget cuts). In between, mapmakers figure, the error is swamped by the imprecision of mapping and GPS equipment. Future maps may be updated at a rate closer to real-time. “We have the technology now with GPS to be able to make those slight adjustments on a more frequent basis,” Craun said.</p><p>As someone who relies on Google Maps to get around, I look forward to that. But the romantic in me prefers seeing out-of-date maps. They never let us forget the dynamism of our planet.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p><span>Since the dawn of human history, certain archetypal stories have recurred, appearing again and again in myth and legend across cultures, continents, and centuries. The Deluge. The Resurrection. The Hero’s Journey. On the internet, among the most important archetypes is “The Overconfident Optimist and His Ill-Advised DIY Project.” We see it in </span><a href="https://twitter.com/boldlybuilding2/status/1197999531671130112" rel="">Groverhaus</a><span>, in </span><a href="https://www.gawker.com/5932987/reddit-island-could-an-enthusiastic-online-community-create-a-nerd-oasis-in-real-life" rel="">Reddit Island</a><span>, in the </span><a href="https://twitter.com/foldablehuman/status/1018966179493265408?lang=en" rel="">Child-Annihilating Zipline</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>On Monday the user @i_zzzzzz -- a person to whom I feel personally indebted for </span><a href="https://twitter.com/i_zzzzzz/status/948803884738404352" rel="">their coinage of the extremely useful term “chaos meal”</a><span> -- revealed what seemed like a new instance of this time-honored archetype. “</span><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32465698" rel="">This guy on Hacker News</a><span> is buying up the entire town of Pine Bluff, Arkansas for reasons that seem unclear even to him. Someone please help him go home to his children,” </span><a href="https://twitter.com/i_zzzzzz/status/1559027106176286721" rel="">@i_zzzzzz wrote</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>The comment appears, it seems worth noting, underneath </span><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32465372" rel="">a Hackernews post from a tech worker looking to relocate for remote work, asking for advice on finding a small town</a><span> with a walkable downtown, good schools, a nearby airport, and houses that cost less than $1 million. “Pick some states, and go visit towns with colleges in them,” one commenter suggests. “The internet means there are no undiscovered places, and the economics can undermine what makes a place special in the first place,” another commenter warns. But one commenter -- writing under the name pontifier -- has very different way of thinking about the problem: why not find the biggest, cheapest warehouse building in the U.S., and buy it?</span></p><blockquote><p>My method sure hasn't worked very well... or has it? I was looking for cheap warehouse space to start a business in, and did a nation-wide search for the largest, cheapest building in the entire continental US.</p><p>I found one that seemed too good to be true. a 220,000 sqft metal warehouse and office complex on 17 acres. I thought the price was a typo at $375k.The agent assured me that the price was correct, and I flew out to see the place.</p><p>It was in a little town called Pine Bluff, Arkansas.</p><p>I offered about 3/4 what they were asking, and they accepted the offer.</p><p>Fast forward 2 1/2 years, and I've had nothing but problems. Break in after break in. Can't work through the red tape with the city so my warehouse sits empty. It feels like they are actively working against myself and other entrepreneurs I talk to. At least 2 others who bought buildings and tried to open businesses left after getting nowhere.</p><p>Maybe I'm daft, but I ended up buying about 75 more properties here... all surprisingly cheap.</p><p>The town is killing me though. I haven't seen my kids very much lately - I don't think it's safe enough for them. I'm probably going to be moving back to Utah in the next couple of months because it's just too much out here.</p></blockquote><p>It’s hard to express the number of questions that a comment like this raises. Questions like: What? What on earth, bro? Was this (as some commenters imagined) a libertarian tech bro trying to take over a depressed town? A comedian doing a weird bit? A man with some kind of mental illness?</p><p><span>Whatever it was, it wasn’t fake: “Pontifier” is the handle used across a number of platforms by a Utahn named John Fenley, a compulsive entrepreneur, amateur nuclear engineer, and, now -- public records show</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1-68844027" href="https://maxread.substack.com/p/the-man-who-bought-pine-bluff-arkansas#footnote-1-68844027" target="_self" rel="">1</a></span><span> -- among the largest property owners in Jefferson County, Arkansas. Fenley has an extensive internet-content trail -- including, besides </span><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=pontifier" rel="">hundreds of HackerNews comments</a><span>, </span><a href="http://twitter.com/pontifier" rel="">a Twitter account</a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/pontifier/videos" rel="">a YouTube channel</a><span>, </span><a href="https://soundcloud.com/john-fenley" rel="">a Soundcloud page</a><span>, and many different registered URLs</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2-68844027" href="https://maxread.substack.com/p/the-man-who-bought-pine-bluff-arkansas#footnote-2-68844027" target="_self" rel="">2</a></span><span> -- some portion of which is dedicated to documenting his Pine Bluff odyssey. But none of it really clarifies what Fenley’s deal is. </span></p><p>So I called Fenley on Tuesday morning, and reached him at his home in Pine Bluff. He was an engaging, talkative interview, and I appreciated his candor and admired his ambition and his positive attitude. He was more than happy to discuss his dreams, troubles, and real-estate activity in Pine Bluff. </p><p>If I’m being honest, I can’t really promise it will clarify anything. </p><p>“Only time will tell if this was a good idea,” he told me. “I mean, yeah, I've experienced, you know, thousands, and thousands, and thousands of dollars of loss. But the upside still could be millions and millions of dollars. Because I still own a warehouse.”</p><p><span>Fenley’s story --&nbsp;this chapter, at any rate -- begins in 2019. After separating from his wife, with whom he has three kids, Fenley had moved in with his father, a sculptor, and uncle in Los Angeles, working on </span><a href="http://www.crossies.com/murfie/crossies_history.html" rel="">a start-up he’d founded called Crossies</a><span>, which stores and digitizes physical media collections and offers them for streaming on the cloud. Two weeks after his arrival, his uncle received an eviction notice, and Fenley and his father began to look for somewhere new. </span></p><p><span>Fenley had run a </span><a href="http://www.provolt.org/" rel="">a makerspace workshop called “Provolt”</a><span> in Utah until the landlord had raised the rent. “There was a 65,000 square foot jail that I'd wanted wanted to move the makerspace into in Provo, and that that whole thing hadn't worked out,” he told me on the phone. (The city only wanted to sell the asbestos-riddled jail, </span><a href="http://heraldextra.com/news/2015/jun/18/provo-city-puts-old-county-jail-on-surplus-list-gets-sued" rel="">which it described as “grim,”</a><span> to owners who would demolish it; Fenley had wanted to rehabilitate the building.) The jail’s size became his minimum lower bound. </span></p><p><span>“I didn't care where it was in the country. And I wanted to find the cheapest possible price,” he said.” So Fenley hopped on the commercial real-estate listing site Loopnet and searched, </span><a href="https://captimes.com/news/local/neighborhoods/john-fenley-shipped-murfie-customers-800-000-cds-to-arkansas-where-are-they-now/article_ef835ab8-b43c-5ec7-b390-c0bdca40e8e5.html" rel="">as he later described to </a><em><a href="https://captimes.com/news/local/neighborhoods/john-fenley-shipped-murfie-customers-800-000-cds-to-arkansas-where-are-they-now/article_ef835ab8-b43c-5ec7-b390-c0bdca40e8e5.html" rel="">The Capital Times</a></em><a href="https://captimes.com/news/local/neighborhoods/john-fenley-shipped-murfie-customers-800-000-cds-to-arkansas-where-are-they-now/article_ef835ab8-b43c-5ec7-b390-c0bdca40e8e5.html" rel=""> of Madison, Wis.</a><span>, “for properties over 65,000 square feet and sorted by price.” At the top of the list was the former home of the steel company Varco Pruden --&nbsp;a 17-acre property with a warehouse and office complex in Pine Bluff that had been vacant and decaying for 15 years. The property was listed at $375,000; Fenley initially assumed the price was a typo. In the summer of 2019, Fenley flew out to tour it, making a YouTube video of his first visit:</span></p><div id="youtube2-qdkLzioUiAE" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;qdkLzioUiAE&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qdkLzioUiAE?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></p></div><p><span>“It was awesome,” Fenley recalled. “It didn't seem like in that bad condition. I mean, for $375,000, how picky can you be about the condition of a place? It had a roof. It had concrete slabs. It had walls, you know</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3-68844027" href="https://maxread.substack.com/p/the-man-who-bought-pine-bluff-arkansas#footnote-3-68844027" target="_self" rel="">3</a></span><span>?” That fall, Fenley made an offer of $300,000, and the owners accepted. He started packing up his things in L.A. and Utah, preparing to relocate.</span></p><p><span>Not many people move </span><em>to </em><span>Pine Bluff. Once a prosperous manufacturing and agricultural city located about 50 miles south of Little Rock, Pine Bluff most recently made national headlines for being </span><a href="http://nytimes.com/2021/08/12/us/pine-bluff-fastest-shrinking-metro-area.html" rel="">the fastest-shrinking city in the country</a><span>. As in many other industrial and agricultural cities in the U.S., white flight, capital flight, deindustrialization, and a multi-decade conservative assault on social spending have decimated Pine Bluff’s economy, leaving it caught in a negative feedback loop between a dwindling tax base and diminished municipal resources. Varco Pruden, the steel company that once owned the 19-acre property Fenley bought for $300,000 and is now itself owned by an Australian conglomerate, </span><a href="http://arkansasonline.com/news/2022/jan/25/varco-pruden-moving-from-pb-to-white-hall" rel="">announced this year it would move its remaining 32 employees to the neighboring city of White Hall</a><span>, which is 70 percent white (Pine Bluff is 75 percent black) and has among the highest median incomes in Arkansas. Pine Bluff, where median income is about 60 percent lower, suffers under one of the worst murder rates in the country.</span></p><p><span>Fenley would not make it to Pine Bluff for a few months yet. In December of 2019, while closing the deal for the Varco Pruden property, Fenley </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/13/21019565/murfie-madison-wisconsin-store-stream-cd-vinyl-collection-closed" rel="">read on the Verge about the demise of a company called Murfie</a><span> -- a music storage-digitizing-streaming company very similar to Crossies, which Fenley was still trying to get off the ground. Murfie, which was based out of Madison, had gone mysteriously bankrupt and the collections of CDs it was storing for customers were about to be abandoned. To Fenley, it was “a perfect storm of opportunity”: Murfie was “basically” Crossies, and he was in the process of purchasing a perfect storage facility for all those CDs. Fenley </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/5/21121594/crossies-murfie-madison-wisconsin-arkansas-1-million-abandoned-cds" rel="">flew to Wisconsin and negotiated to purchase Murfie and its assets for $6,000, plus $2,000 in lawyers’ fees</a><span>. He packed two shipping containers with Murfie customers’ CD collections and sent them down to Pine Bluff.</span></p><div id="youtube2-B5KleqoyB0s" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;B5KleqoyB0s&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/B5KleqoyB0s?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></p></div><p><span>By the time the shipping containers, delayed by COVID-19, arrived in July, Fenley’s dreams had gotten more complicated. At this point his plans for the warehouse and surrounding property included not just a makerspace but a live/work business incubator, art studio, and science museum. It would be called “</span><a href="http://www.serendipic.com/#contact" rel="">Serendipic</a><span>.” “I was working with Pine Bluff City at the time,” Fenley said. “I made up my little proposal for the planning commission, submitted it, and they approved most of the stuff I wanted to do, with a notable exception exception of a go-kart track.” </span></p><p><span>But Fenley’s relationship with the city of Pine Bluff was deteriorating. </span><a href="https://captimes.com/news/local/neighborhoods/john-fenley-shipped-murfie-customers-800-000-cds-to-arkansas-where-are-they-now/article_ef835ab8-b43c-5ec7-b390-c0bdca40e8e5.html" rel="">Pine Bluff city government wanted Fenley to submit architectural and engineering drawings so it could determine the applicable building codes</a><span>, but he had not done so and the city wouldn’t approve his permits. Fenley believes something else was at stake: “They denied my go-kart track that I proposed, and now they’re spending $2.6 million to </span><a href="https://www.thv11.com/article/entertainment/go-kart-facility-pine-bluff/91-b3415ccd-8350-4ed7-be53-1080fef6ca0d" rel="">build their own go-kart track</a><span>. Yeah, surprising. I proposed residences for artists and entrepreneurs. Oh, suddenly, their little art space that they’re building is going to have residences for artists. Oh, what a surprise.” he said. “The city doesn't want any competition with anything they're trying to do. They have their own business incubator; they have their own science museum, which honestly sucks. Both of them. Their little makerspace, business incubator thing? It sucks. It's the worst one I've ever been to in my life.”</span></p><p><span>Fenley </span><a href="https://murfie.com/dist/list.html" rel="">began recording his meetings with town officials and posting them to the Murfie site</a><span>; they frequently end with Fenley being asked to calm down or leave. At one point, he told me, a zoning official “came across the room, ripped the clipboard out of my hand, and yelled at me to get out.” (He says he filed a police report over the incident.) Listening to Fenley’s recordings, the fairest thing you might say is that it seems like there is a mismatch between the scale and mutability of Fenley’s science museum–makerspace–go-kart track dreams and the capacity of Pine Bluff’s bureaucracy, not to mention between his eagerness to occupy the old warehouse and the city government’s caution over a long-abandoned space. </span></p><p><span>Permitting difficulty was not the only trouble Fenley was facing, anyway. In the early months of the process, Fenley had been staying in a tent and RV on the Varco Pruden site, sometimes with his father. (Fenley now lives in a house nearby.) “This whole time, there's this constant background of crime in this town,” he said. “People have come to the tent and put a gun in my face at one point, back in 2020 -- while I was waiting for this stuff to happen -- and my dad shot at them, and they ran away. I've got an audio recording of that.” (He does; it’s available on his Soundcloud; I can’t say I recommend listening to it.) At one point, trying to catch two thieves who’d stolen a catalytic converter from his car, </span><a href="http://bensforbars.com/" rel="">he set up a website called “Bens for Bars”</a><span> offering cash for tips leading to the thieves.</span></p><p>Fenley wasn’t exactly unaware of Pine Bluff’s reputation. “I saw some statistics,” he said on the phone. “And I was like, ‘Oh, well, I have one in X number of chance of being robbed each year or something.’ Right? Yeah. But that's on average, and well, I'm a huge target. I didn't really take that into account, I guess.” He’s mostly dealing with “career criminals,” he said, who arrive “with heavy machinery, cutting torches,” looking for metal and other materials to lift and sell for scrap.</p><p>Whatever you think of Google Forms-based private snitch sites, and whatever might expect from the circumstances, Fenley is a fraction as bloodthirsty as tough-on-crime local columnists in much less dangerous metropolises. “It’s a nice town,” he told me about Pine Bluff. “It feels like they’re trying to fix things. New York was terrible, in the ‘80s. Everything they’re saying about Pine Bluff now they were saying about New York in the ‘80s! And I sure wish I could have bought some real estate in New York in the 80s!”</p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://maxread.substack.com/p/the-man-who-bought-pine-bluff-arkansas?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://maxread.substack.com/p/the-man-who-bought-pine-bluff-arkansas?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p><p><span>For most of the next year, Fenley, living on the property and subsisting on ramen, was engaged in battle on multiple fronts: Against the city of Pine Bluff, against the scrappers stealing from his property, and against angry Murfie customers who wanted to know where their CDs were. (Still packed into the shipping containers sitting outside the Varco Pruden warehouse, as it happened.) But in the summer of 2021, he came into a windfall: He was able to sell nearly $900,000 worth of stock in a company to whom he’d sold a patent</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-4-68844027" href="https://maxread.substack.com/p/the-man-who-bought-pine-bluff-arkansas#footnote-4-68844027" target="_self" rel="">4</a></span><span>. A certain kind of person might use that money to extricate themselves from what had become a clearly stressful and likely unsustainable real-estate situation in Pine Bluff. Fenley, instead, used it to buy more property.</span></p><p>“All of a sudden I went from scraping by to having $890,000 in my bank account. And then a tax auction, like three weeks later? Of course I'm gonna buy some property.” He spent $138,000 and ended up with 74 parcels of land in Pine Bluff, to go along with his 19-acre industrial park. “I didn’t really have a plan,” he said. Fenley’s mom was a real estate agent, and he told me it was “drilled into me from a young child: You buy property when you can.” He still sounds awed by how much land he bought, and how cheaply. “There were a few hundred other people in that room. And anybody else that had the money could have done it,” he said. “But I'm the one that actually did it. That's what a lot of this boils down to, in a way. A lot of the things that I'm doing, anybody could do them. But I'm the one that's actually doing them.”</p><p><span>And yet becoming one of the top landowners (by parcel) in Jefferson County didn’t change much for Fenley’s overall situation. He moved into a house, but he still hasn’t broken ground on his dream makerspace; his YouTube feed is still taken up by increasingly apologetic messages to Murfie customers interspersed with security footage of alleged thieves. This summer, he and his 12-year-old son drove from Provo to Pine Bluff in a Volkswagen bus loaded up with electronics and supplies. “Saturday, we came to the house and played video games. And Sunday, went back over the warehouse, and the containers were robbed. Everything,” he said.” “</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHclCHqC2rE" rel="">Everything I brought from Utah was stolen</a><span>. They stole my turbomolecular vacuum pumps for my fusion reactor</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-5-68844027" href="https://maxread.substack.com/p/the-man-who-bought-pine-bluff-arkansas#footnote-5-68844027" target="_self" rel="">5</a></span><span>!”</span></p><p>This seems to have been something of a final straw for even the eternally optimistic Fenley. A year after buying a chunk of Pine Bluff at auction, he’s finally decided to leave: “My finances are fine,” he told me. “I'm in no danger of losing the warehouse or any of the property that I bought. But right now, my mother and girlfriend are working on building a warehouse in Utah, and moving everything back to Utah. That's the plan at this point as of today.”</p><p>But what about the makerspace? What about the warehouse? What about his Pine Bluff holdings? I asked Fenley what his long-term plans were. He hesitated. “There's a hotel available at auction right now that I bid on three weeks ago. There's like a week left in the auction. If nobody bids on this hotel against me, I'm gonna buy a hotel for $31,400,” he said. The hotel is in Pine Bluff, with good highway access. It’s been unoccupied since 2019. “It'd be freaking fantastic to own a hotel, and like, have rooftop parties and turn the whole top floor into a penthouse for me. You know? Like, that's, like, how would I not want to do that?”</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto">This is an account of a project we recently did. The files aren't intended to constitute a cohesive runnable project, they're just a loose collection of scripts. It's mostly here to remind me how it works, but hopefully it's useful to others.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Background</h2><a id="user-content-background" aria-label="Permalink: Background" href="#background"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Recently we went to the MoMA with my 4 year old son. Some modern art is hard to appreciate as a kid, but the exhibit he <em>loved</em> was one where they had a bunch of rotary phones and you could <a href="https://www.moma.org/collection/works/294325" rel="nofollow">dial a number and it would read you a poem</a>. I wanted to replicate something like this at home.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Features</h2><a id="user-content-features" aria-label="Permalink: Features" href="#features"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Some things I wanted it to be able to do:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Dial out to a short list of family contacts. It's not something I think about much, but when I was a kid there was a phone on the wall and once I could reach it, I could use it. Now, if you're not old enough to have a cell phone, you also can't call anyone at all.</li>
<li>Allow incoming calls from that same list of family contacts. Requires an actual phone number.</li>
<li>On a different extension, hear a random joke.</li>
<li><del>Hear a random k-pop song.</del> This was an easy thing to start with, but not actually that fun. The audio quality is pretty terrible for music.</li>
<li>Get NYC MTA train status. My son loves the subway, and is already pretty proficient at using a unix terminal to query the status of different trains, but it would be fun to hear an announcement too.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Equipment</h2><a id="user-content-equipment" aria-label="Permalink: Equipment" href="#equipment"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">60 years ago, every household in America had one or more rotary phones, so they're not exactly hard to find. I bought one off of Ebay for ~$25. Not all of them are guaranteed to be in working order, but these things are pretty solid so if the outside looks undamaged, it's likely alright. Worst case you might have to spend another $25 and try again. I got a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_500_telephone" rel="nofollow">Western Electric Bell 500</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">If we lived in 1960 (or even 2000) I could plug it into the wall and the project would be mostly done. But if I want to do anything interesting, I need to adapt it to VoIP. My initial thought was to hack up the inside of the phone and use a Raspberry Pi or ESP32 or something, but between driving 48V DC or replacing most of the internals it seemed a bit out of reach. Instead, I used the phone unmodified and connected it to a <a href="https://www.grandstream.com/products/gateways-and-atas/analog-telephone-adaptors/product/ht802" rel="nofollow">Grandstream GS-HT802</a> which lists rotary support in the specs. This currently goes for ~$50 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Grandstream-GS-HT802-Analog-Telephone-Adapter/dp/B01JH7MYKA" rel="nofollow">on Amazon</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">To accomplish the other features, I wanted to use Asterisk, an open source PBX. Using Asterisk to make a phone that tells you jokes is a bit like using Kubernetes to host your blog, but I had a little bit of experience with it from ~20 years ago and it seemed to do everything I wanted. Ideally I would have been able to attach the Grandstream adapter directly to the machine running the Asterisk server. But for the equipment I had, I ended up attaching the Grandstream to the Raspberry Pi in my son's room, and having it bridge wifi to an old server under my desk running Asterisk. This hasn't flaked out yet but seems like it could be brittle. At some point I'd like to consolidate these into a more powerful Raspberry Pi 5 that runs Asterisk and is directly connected to the GrandStream.</p>

<p dir="auto">Pretty much just plug the RJ11 port of the phone into port 1 on the GrandStream. This should mostly Just Work, but there are some potential caveats depending on the rotary phone you receive. I'd try it first, but if you have trouble with it ringing later in the process you can try:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>It's possible that your phone has been wired for a "party line" instead of regular service. This would require unscrewing the cover (make sure it's unplugged from the Grandstream) and a small amount of rewiring which differs based on your phone model.</li>
<li>The one I received <em>wasn't</em> wired for a party line, but was effectively muted. I had to take the cover off and unhook part of the ringer. I haven't seen discussion of this online anywhere.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Opening it up:</p>

<p dir="auto">After everything else checked out, I realized the ringer had been locked, and moved it to this position to fix:</p>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Asterisk setup</h2><a id="user-content-asterisk-setup" aria-label="Permalink: Asterisk setup" href="#asterisk-setup"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">I installed Asterisk via dpkg on Ubuntu 22. Setup was made a little more complicated by the RPi wifi bridge, which meant that the Grandstream was techically behind NAT from the perspective of Asterisk. Asterisk is trying to move from legacy <code>sip</code> module to <code>pjsip</code>, but I was only able to get <code>sip</code> to work so I stuck with that. The <code>/etc/asterisk/sip.conf</code> relevant parts:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="[rotary]

nat=force_rport,comedia
secret=s3cr3t
host=dynamic

</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">The <code>nat</code> and <code>host=dynamic</code> aspects wouldn't be necessary if the Grandstream was on the same network as Asterisk.</p>

<p dir="auto">Plugging the Grandstream device in, it automatically obtained an IP via DHCP and I was able to log into its web interface using default credentials. Setup was pleasantly straightforward, I just configured fx-1's sip server to point to the Asterisk server's address.</p>

<p dir="auto">At this point, you should be able to pick up the phone's handset and get a dialtone. If you don't, there are some different debugging avenues:</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Asterisk side</h3><a id="user-content-asterisk-side" aria-label="Permalink: Asterisk side" href="#asterisk-side"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">You can run <code>sudo asterisk -rvvvvv</code> to start the asterisk repl. Then:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>sip show peers</code> should list <code>rotary/rotary</code> with the right Host and hopefully a Status of "OK"</li>
<li><code>sip set debug on</code> will give loads of SIP debug data, after enabling that you can unplug and replug the grandstream and hopefully see it trying to connect</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Grandstream side</h3><a id="user-content-grandstream-side" aria-label="Permalink: Grandstream side" href="#grandstream-side"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">If you're not seeing any peers or any sip logs from asterisk, you can also use the Grandstream web UI and enable sip logging to hopefully see what is going on.</p>

<p dir="auto">The easiest one first. Asterisk can play back an audio file, but is relatively limited in the types of files it can play. You'll likely need to convert your file to 8KHz wav. Then put something like this in <code>/etc/asterisk/extensions.conf</code>:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="[rotary-context]
exten => 1234,1,Answer()
    same => n,Playback(/path/to/file.wav)
    same => n,Hangup()"><pre><code>[rotary-context]
exten =&gt; 1234,1,Answer()
    same =&gt; n,Playback(/path/to/file.wav)
    same =&gt; n,Hangup()
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">You can reload Asterisk config with (among others) <code>sudo systemctl reload asterisk</code>. This will let you dial 1,2,3,4 on the phone, answer, play the audio, and hang up on you.</p>

<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Speech Synthesis</h3><a id="user-content-speech-synthesis" aria-label="Permalink: Speech Synthesis" href="#speech-synthesis"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">For this one, we need some sort of text-to-speech synthesis. TTS has come a <em>long</em> way since Asterisk was initially created back in the early 2000s, so I opted for hooking in a third party TTS engine. I chose <a href="https://github.com/rhasspy/piper">piper</a> which sounds pretty good and notably is fast--it can run on a Raspberry Pi.</p>
<p dir="auto">Piper can pipe to stdout, or a file or whatever. I was hoping I could shell out to piper with my text and <em>stream</em> the result back to asterisk via stdout, but it was not meant to be. I went so far as to try to write a c Asterisk module that would accept raw audio over stdout, and eventually discovered that a) audio formats are hard, and b) I lack any sort of intuition about debugging when all I can get back are silence and a few popping noises.</p>
<p dir="auto">Instead I wound up writing an extension subroutine that calls out to piper, has it write to a tempfile, plays the tempfile, then deletes the tempfile. This means the entire speech generation has to complete before it can begin playing, but so far that has not taken longer than ~250ms on my Asterisk server. (a decade+ old core i7)</p>
<p dir="auto">The <code>speak.sh</code> bash script:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="#!/bin/bash

/path/to/piper/piper \
    --length_scale=5 --sentence_silence=0.5 \
    --model /path/to/piper/voices/en_US-amy-medium.onnx \
    --output-raw -f - | \
  sox -v 0.7 -t raw -e signed -r 22050 -b 16 - -r 8000 -b 16 -c 1 -t wav -"><pre><span><span>#!</span>/bin/bash</span>

/path/to/piper/piper \
    --length_scale=5 --sentence_silence=0.5 \
    --model /path/to/piper/voices/en_US-amy-medium.onnx \
    --output-raw -f - <span>|</span> \
  sox -v 0.7 -t raw -e signed -r 22050 -b 16 - -r 8000 -b 16 -c 1 -t wav -</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">This uses the "Amy" medium-fidelity model to generate some speech, then <code>sox</code> to translate it to one of the few audio formats that Asterisk can play.</p>
<p dir="auto">Then we create the subroutine in <code>extensions.conf</code>:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="[speak]
exten => s,1,NoOp(Text to speech)
 same => n,Set(filename=&quot;speech-${RAND()}${RAND()}&quot;)
 same => n,System(echo &quot;${ARG1}&quot; | /path/to/speak.sh > /tmp/${filename}.wav)
 same => n,Playback(/tmp/${filename})
 same => n,System(rm -f /tmp/${filename}.wav)
 same => n,Return()"><pre><code>[speak]
exten =&gt; s,1,NoOp(Text to speech)
 same =&gt; n,Set(filename="speech-${RAND()}${RAND()}")
 same =&gt; n,System(echo "${ARG1}" | /path/to/speak.sh &gt; /tmp/${filename}.wav)
 same =&gt; n,Playback(/tmp/${filename})
 same =&gt; n,System(rm -f /tmp/${filename}.wav)
 same =&gt; n,Return()
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Then I can call it like this from a regular extension:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="exten => 888,1,Answer() ; Say something
 same => n,GoSub(speak,s,1(&quot;Hello world&quot;))"><pre><code>exten =&gt; 888,1,Answer() ; Say something
 same =&gt; n,GoSub(speak,s,1("Hello world"))
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">This works pretty well, but a very common pattern is that I want to play some audio for the dialer while at the same time accepting input from them. How maddening is it when you're trying to cancel Comcast and they're making you listen to all of the menu options because <em>they might have changed</em>? If we play audio, <em>then</em> accept input, Asterisk blocks and we're no better than Comcast. Instead of <code>Playback()</code> we can use <code>Read()</code>, which accepts some audio and waits at the same time. We can make a separate subroutine for that:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="[speak-get-digits]
exten => s,1,NoOp(Text to speech requesting digits)
    same => n,Set(filename=&quot;speech-${RAND()}${RAND()}&quot;)
    same => n,Set(digitcount=${IF($[&quot;${ARG2}&quot;=&quot;&quot;]?1:${ARG2})})
    same => n,System(echo &quot;${ARG1}&quot; | /path/to/rotary/speak.sh > /tmp/${filename}.wav)
    same => n,Read(digits,/tmp/${filename},${digitcount})
    same => n,System(rm -f /tmp/${filename}.wav)
    same => n,Return(${digits})"><pre><code>[speak-get-digits]
exten =&gt; s,1,NoOp(Text to speech requesting digits)
    same =&gt; n,Set(filename="speech-${RAND()}${RAND()}")
    same =&gt; n,Set(digitcount=${IF($["${ARG2}"=""]?1:${ARG2})})
    same =&gt; n,System(echo "${ARG1}" | /path/to/rotary/speak.sh &gt; /tmp/${filename}.wav)
    same =&gt; n,Read(digits,/tmp/${filename},${digitcount})
    same =&gt; n,System(rm -f /tmp/${filename}.wav)
    same =&gt; n,Return(${digits})
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Asterisk has a long lineage and unfortunately has some serious warts, one of them being return values. In order to call this you need to do:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="same => n,GoSub(speak-get-digits,s,1(&quot;Dial a number to hear the status of a numbered train or dial 9 for a letter train.&quot;,1))
same => n,Set(digit=${GOSUB_RETVAL})"><pre><code>same =&gt; n,GoSub(speak-get-digits,s,1("Dial a number to hear the status of a numbered train or dial 9 for a letter train.",1))
same =&gt; n,Set(digit=${GOSUB_RETVAL})
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto"><code>${GOSUB_RETVAL}</code> is a sort of environment variable set upon completion of your subroutine. I'd recommend immediately setting it to a different name like I've done above. The <code>1</code> we pass in as a second argument tells asterisk to only wait for one digit before proceeding.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Talking to the MTA</h4><a id="user-content-talking-to-the-mta" aria-label="Permalink: Talking to the MTA" href="#talking-to-the-mta"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">This part came from the pieces of the aforementioned unix terminal mta status project. It's a command line script that takes the number or letter of a train, fetches from the HTTP API the MTA website runs on, and returns the status in text form.</p>
<p dir="auto">What I discovered was that the response from the MTA was pretty good for viewing on a screen, but not quite suitable for text-to-speech. I had to modify the app to do a replacement pass, to change abbreviations where appropriate: Sq to Square, St to Street (but also St George to Saint George), etc. Then a secondary pass to correct mispronunciations. (Houston -&gt; Howston, Coney Island -&gt; Coaney Island etc) The last part probably varies a lot from one TTS engine to the next.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Putting it together</h4><a id="user-content-putting-it-together" aria-label="Permalink: Putting it together" href="#putting-it-together"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The numbered trains (1-7) were a piece of cake. Read a digit, phone user dials it on the rotary, pass it to the mta script, generate audio. Letters were quite a bit harder:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>While there are only 9 numbers, you can achieve the letters by doing a proto-T9 implementation where the user dials "2" for "A", "22" for "B", etc.</li>
<li>But rotary phones and the subway share an interesting mid-century oddity that they just <em>skip</em> various letters. Unfortunately these aren't the same letters. While the subway skips "I", "O", "P", etc, rotary phones skip "Q", and "Z". These are both actual subway lines so need to be mapped to something else.</li>
<li>The subway has 3 shuttle lines (Grand central, Franklin, Rockaways) and the Staten Island Railway; I just made "S" its own sub-menu with 4 options.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Dial "33" to start the subway status tree:</p>

<p dir="auto">At this point many hours in, we're almost to the part you could have achieved 30 years ago by buying a phone and plugging it in to any house in America.</p>
<p dir="auto">In order for someone to use the phone to talk to another person with a regular phone, we need to connect to the phone network. Long ago it was apparently possible to use Google Voice, but from everything I've read it's no longer possible. I signed up for Twilio: not the cheapest, but it's reputable and developer-focused so pretty easy to work with.</p>
<p dir="auto">Buying a number will cost a few dollars a month. I let my son pick his own phone number. It has a lot of sevens in it.</p>
<p dir="auto">Twilio offers two different services that seem like they could be relevant: I started out exploring "Twilio Elastic Sip Trunking" which "enables you to make &amp; receive telephone calls from your IP communications infrastructure around the globe over a public or private connection" and sounds like exactly what I need. This is probably the "correct" way to bridge Asterisk into Twilio, especially if you're doing something real. But this approach assumes your Asterisk server has a public IP and mine sits behind my home router. Using this approach I was able to have Asterisk dial out, but Twilio could not make calls into Asterisk. NAT strikes again!</p>
<p dir="auto">Instead, I went the route of creating a Programmable SIP Domain in Twilio and having Asterisk just act like another SIP client. This let Asterisk register with Twilio and punch through NAT using the usual OPTIONS keepalive trick.</p>
<p dir="auto">The steps are:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Create a <a href="https://console.twilio.com/us1/develop/voice/manage/sip-domains" rel="nofollow">SIP Domain</a></li>
<li>Create a Credential List. This is how Asterisk will authenticate with Twilio. Set up Voice Authentication with the Credential List.</li>
<li>Enable SIP Registration.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">On the Asterisk side, we'll need something like this in our <code>/etc/asterisk/sip.conf</code>:</p>

<p dir="auto">With our outbound setup, Asterisk could technically dial <em>any</em> number but we limit which numbers can actually be dialed by only explicitly dialing them in <code>extensions.conf</code>. For receiving calls, we want to make sure we also limit it to specific callers.

<p dir="auto">By far the best part of the project is that he'll randomly call up his grandparents to talk. As an adult I talk to loved ones on the phone, but calls tend to be scheduled and coordinated in advance via text. An unexpected call triggers annoyance or concern.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-body-6945380884103902536" itemprop="description articleBody">
<p>In 1979, Intel introduced the 8088 microprocessor, a variant of the 16-bit 8086 processor.
IBM's decision to use the 8088 processor in the IBM PC (1981) was a critical point in computer history,
leading to the dominance of the x86 architecture that continues to the present.<span id="fnref:marketshare"><a href="#fn:marketshare">1</a></span>
One way that the 8086 and 8088 increased performance was by prefetching:
the processor fetches instructions from memory before they are needed,
so the processor can execute them without waiting on the relatively slow memory.
I've been reverse-engineering the 8088 from die photos and this blog post discusses what I've uncovered
about the prefetch circuitry.</p>
<p>The die photo below shows the 8088 microprocessor under a microscope.
The metal layer on top of the chip is visible, with the silicon and polysilicon mostly hidden underneath. Around the edges of the die, bond wires connect pads to
the chip's 40 external pins.
I've labeled the key functional blocks; 
this article focuses on the prefetch queue components highlighted in red.
The components in purple also play a role, and will be discussed below.
Architecturally, the chip is partitioned into a Bus Interface Unit (BIU) at the top
and an Execution Unit (EU) below.
The BIU handles memory accesses, while the Execution Unit (EU) executes instructions.
In particular, the BIU fetches instructions, which are transferred from the prefetch queue to the Execution Unit via the
queue bus.</p>

<p>The 8086 and 8088 processors present the same 16-bit architecture to the programmer.
The key difference is that
the 8088 has an 8-bit data bus for communication with memory and I/O, rather than the 16-bit bus of the 8086.
The 8088's narrower bus reduced performance, since the processor only transfers one byte at a time rather than two.
However, the 8-bit bus enabled cheaper computer hardware.
The 8-bit bus was also a better match for hardware based on the older but popular 8-bit
Intel 8080 and 8085 processors, allowing the reuse of 8-bit I/O circuitry for instance.
Much of the IBM PC was based on the little-known IBM <a href="https://www.ardent-tool.com/5150/PC_origins.html">DataMaster</a>, a computer built around the Intel 8085.
Thus, selecting the 8088 processor was a natural choice for the IBM PC.</p>
<p>For the most part, the 8086 and 8088 are very similar internally, apart from trivial but numerous layout changes on the die.
The biggest differences are in the Bus Interface Unit, the circuitry that communicates with memory and I/O devices, since
this circuitry handles 16 bits in the 8086 versus 8 bits in the 8088.
There are a few microcode differences between the two chips.
One interesting change is that for performance reasons the 8088 has a smaller prefetch queue
than the 8086 (four bytes instead of six).
(I wrote about the <a href="https://www.righto.com/2023/01/inside-8086-processors-instruction.html">8086's prefetch circuity</a> earlier.)</p>
<h2>Prefetching and the architecture of the 8086 and 8088</h2>
<p>The 8086 and 8088 were introduced at an interesting point in microprocessor history, when memory was becoming slower than the CPU.
For the first microprocessors, the speed of the CPU and the speed of memory were comparable.<span id="fnref:memory-speed"><a href="#fn:memory-speed">2</a></span>
However, as processors became faster, the speed of memory failed to keep up.
The 8086 was probably the first microprocessor to prefetch instructions to improve performance.
While modern microprocessors have megabytes of fast cache<span id="fnref:cache"><a href="#fn:cache">3</a></span> to act as a buffer between the CPU and much slower main memory,
the 8088 has just 4 bytes of prefetch queue. However, this was enough to substantially increase performance.</p>
<p>Prefetching had a major impact on the design of the 8086 and thus the 8088.
Earlier processors such as the 6502, 8080, or Z80 were deterministic:
the processor fetched an instruction, executed the instruction, and so forth.
Memory accesses corresponded directly to instruction fetching and execution and
instructions took a predictable number of clock cycles.
This all changed with the introduction of the prefetch queue.
Memory operations became unlinked from instruction execution since prefetches happen as needed and when the memory bus is available.</p>
<p>To handle memory operations and instruction execution independently,
the implementors of the 8086 and 8088 divided the processors into two processing units: the Bus Interface Unit (BIU) that handles memory accesses, and the Execution Unit (EU) that executes instructions.
The Bus Interface Unit contains the instruction prefetch queue; it supplies instructions to
the Execution Unit via the Q (queue) bus.
The BIU also contains an
adder (Σ) for address calculation, adding the segment register base to an address offset, among other things.
The Execution Unit is what comes to mind when you think of a processor: it has most of the registers, the arithmetic/logic unit (ALU), and the microcode that implements instructions.
The segment registers (CS, DS, SS, ES) and the Instruction Pointer (IP) are in the Bus Interface Unit since they are directly involved in memory accesses,
while the general-purpose registers are in the Execution Unit.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/8086-prefetch8088/8088-block-diagram.jpg"><img alt="Block diagram of the 8088 processor.
This diagram differs from most 8088 block diagrams because it shows the actual physical implementation, rather than the programmer's view of the processor.

<p>It may seem inefficient for the Bus Interface Unit to have its own adder instead of using the ALU,
but there are reasons for the separate adder.
First, every memory access uses the adder at least once to add the segment base and offset.
The adder is also used to increment the PC or index registers.
Since these operations are so frequent, they would create a bottleneck if they used the ALU.
Second, since the Execution Unit and the Bus Interface Unit run asynchronously with respect to each other, it would be complicated
to share the ALU without conflicts.</p>
<p>Prefetching had another major but little-known effect on the 8086 architecture: the designers were considering
making the 8086 a two-chip microprocessor.
Prefetching, however, required a one-chip design because the number of control signals required to synchronize prefetching across two chips exceeded the package pins available.
This became a compelling argument for the one-chip design that was used for the 8086.<span id="fnref:mckevitt"><a href="#fn:mckevitt">4</a></span>
(The unsuccessful Intel <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_iAPX_432">iAPX 432</a>, which was under development at the same time, ended up being a two-chip processor: one to fetch and decode instructions, and one to execute them.)</p>
<h2>Implementing the queue</h2>
<p>The 8088's instruction prefetch queue is implemented with four 8-bit queue registers along with two hardware "pointers"
into the queue.
One two-bit counter keeps track of the current read position from 0 to 3,
i.e. the queue register that will provide the next instruction byte.
The second counter keeps track of the current write position, i.e. the queue register that will receive the next instruction from memory.<span id="fnref:read"><a href="#fn:read">5</a></span>
As bytes are fetched from the queue, the read pointer advances. As bytes are added to the queue, the write pointer advances.</p>
<p>The diagram below shows an example queue configuration with two prefetched bytes. The middle two queue registers (Q1 and Q2) hold data.
The read pointer indicates that the Execution Unit will get its next byte from Q1.
The write pointer indicates that the next prefetched byte will go into Q3.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/8086-prefetch8088/queue-diagram-2.jpg"><img alt="A queue configuration with two bytes in the prefetch queue. Bytes in blue hold prefetched data." height="200" src="https://static.righto.com/images/8086-prefetch8088/queue-diagram-2-w300.jpg" title="A queue configuration with two bytes in the prefetch queue. Bytes in blue hold prefetched data." width="300"></a></p><p>A queue configuration with two bytes in the prefetch queue. Bytes in blue hold prefetched data.</p>
<p>The diagram below shows how the queue pointers can wrap around. In this configuration, two more bytes have been written
to the queue (Q3 and Q0), so the queue is full.
The write pointer now points to Q1, the same as the read pointer.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/8086-prefetch8088/queue-diagram-4.jpg"><img alt="A queue configuration with four bytes in the prefetch queue." height="198" src="https://static.righto.com/images/8086-prefetch8088/queue-diagram-4-w300.jpg" title="A queue configuration with four bytes in the prefetch queue." width="300"></a></p><p>A queue configuration with four bytes in the prefetch queue.</p>
<p>There is an important ambiguity, however. Suppose that four bytes are read from the queue, so the read pointer
advances four positions, wrapping around back to Q1.
The queue is now empty, as shown below, but the pointers have the same position as the full case above.
Thus, if the read pointer and the write pointer both point to the same position, the queue may be empty or full.
To distinguish these cases, a flip-flop is set
if the queue enters the empty state. This flip-flop generates a signal that Intel called MT (empty).</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/8086-prefetch8088/queue-diagram-0.jpg"><img alt="A queue configuration with the queue empty." height="199" src="https://static.righto.com/images/8086-prefetch8088/queue-diagram-0-w300.jpg" title="A queue configuration with the queue empty." width="300"></a></p><p>A queue configuration with the queue empty.</p>
<p>To determine how many bytes are in the queue, the queue circuitry uses a two-bit queue length value, along with the MT flip-flop value to distinguish the empty state.
Conceptually, the queue length is generated by subtracting the read position from the write position.
However, the implementation does not use a standard subtraction circuit, but instead uses hardcoded logic to
determine the two bits of the length, as shown below.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/8086-prefetch8088/length-logic.png"><img alt="The circuitry to determine the queue length." height="277" src="https://static.righto.com/images/8086-prefetch8088/length-logic-w500.png" title="The circuitry to determine the queue length." width="500"></a></p><p>The circuitry to determine the queue length.</p>
<p>The low bit of the length is the XOR of the two positions. 
In NMOS logic (used by the 8088), an AND-NOR gate is easy to implement, while an XOR gate is difficult. Thus, XOR is
implemented as shown in the top circuit.
(You can verify that if one input is 1 and the other is 0, the output is 1.)
The high-order bit of the length is also based on an AND-NOR gate, one with six inputs.
Each input is a combination of read and write positions that yields an output bit 1; each input is computed by a NOR gate,
which I haven't drawn.<span id="fnref:demorgan"><a href="#fn:demorgan">6</a></span>
As a result, the amount of logic circuitry to compute the length is fairly large.</p>
<p>The diagram below zooms in on the queue control circuitry on the die, with the main flip-flops and circuitry labeled.
The circuitry in the middle computes the queue length with
the 6-input NOR gate stretched across the whole region.
The flip-flops for the read and write positions are in the lower region.
Despite the relative simplicity of the queue circuits, they take up a substantial part of the die.
Compared to modern chips, the density of the 8088 is very low; you can almost see the flip-flops with the naked eye.
But this isn't all the circuitry as prefetching also required
queue registers and memory cycle control circuitry.
Thus, prefetching was a moderately expensive feature for the 8088, as far as die area.</p>

<h2>The loader</h2>
<!--
The 8086 processor is implemented with microcode: most 8086 machine instructions are broken down into simple micro-instructions that are
stored in the microcode ROM.
For example, an ADD instruction is implemented through a sequence of micro-instructions to move the arguments to the Arithmetic/Logic Unit, perform the addition, and store the result.
The multiple addressing modes are implemented in micro-instruction subroutines that access index registers and compute the
memory address.

In 1978 the space available for microcode was limited, so the 8086 designers
moved a lot of control logic outside the microcode, including insruction fetching and decoding.

The relevant part for this discussion is the instruction fetch and decode loop is implemented outside the microcode.
A state machine called the "loader" fetches the first one or two bytes of an instruction. A ROM called the Group Decode ROM
does a "high-level" classification of the instruction.
Simple instructions (such as clearing the carry flag) or prefixes (such as LOCK or selecting a segment register) are performed
directly. More complex instructions are dispatched to the microcode engine, which runs the micro-instructions to carry
out the instruction.
-->

<p>To decode and execute an instruction, the Execution Unit must get instruction bytes from the Bus Interface Unit, but this is not entirely straightforward.
The main problem is that the queue can be empty, in which case instruction decoding must block until a byte is available from
the queue.
The second problem is that instruction decoding is relatively slow so it is pipelined.
For maximum performance, the decoder needs a new byte before the current instruction
is finished.
A circuit called the "loader" solves these problems by providing
synchronization between the prefetch queue and the instruction decoder.
The loader uses a small state machine to efficiently fetch bytes from the queue at the right time and to provide timing
signals to the decoder and microcode engine.</p>
<!--
To explain how instructions are fetched, I'll first give a brief overview of 8086 instructions.
The 8086 instruction format is fairly complicated, with instructions from one to six bytes long.
The first byte is the opcode, specifying the instruction.
In some cases, this byte completely specifies the instruction, for example PUSH AX to push the AX register to the stack.
Most of the instructions, however, have a second byte that specifies the addressing mode and register: the Mod R/M byte.
Depending on the addressing mode selected, this may be followed by an 8- or 16-bit memory displacement.
Finally, there can be an 8- or 16-bit immediate operand.
-->

<p>In more detail, as the loader requests the first two instruction bytes from the prefetch queue, it generates two timing signals that control the microcode execution.
The FC (First Clock) indicates that the first instruction byte is available, while the SC (Second Clock) indicates the second
instruction byte.
Note that the First Clock and Second Clock are not necessarily consecutive clock cycles because
the prefetch queue could be empty or contain just one byte, in which case the First Clock and/or Second Clock would be
delayed.
The instruction decoding circuitry and the microcode engine are controlled by the First Clock and Second Clock signals, so
they remain synchronized with the bytes supplied by the prefetch queue.</p>
<p>At the end of a microcode sequence, the Run Next Instruction (RNI) micro-operation causes the loader to fetch the next machine instruction.
However, fetching and decoding the next instruction is a bit slow so microcode execution would be blocked for a cycle.
In many cases, this slowdown can be avoided: if the microcode knows that it is one micro-instruction away from finishing,
it issues a Next-to-last (NXT) micro-operation so the loader can start loading the next instruction.
This achieves a degree of pipelining in most cases; fetching the next instruction is overlapped with finishing the execution
of the previous instruction.</p>

The 1BL signal indicates a 1-byte instruction implemented in logic rather than microcode.
From <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US4449184A">patent US4449184</a>.</p>
<p>The diagram above shows the state machine for the loader.
I won't explain it in detail, but essentially it keeps track of whether it is waiting for a First Clock byte or a
Second Clock byte, and if it is performing a fetch in advance (NXT) or at the end of an instruction (RNI).
The state machine is implemented with two flip-flops to support its four states.</p>
<h2>Microcode and the prefetch queue</h2>
<p>The loader takes care of fetching an instruction that consists of an opcode byte and a Mod R/M (addressing mode) byte.
However, many instructions have additional bytes or don't follow this format
For example, an opcode such as "ADD AX" can be followed by an 8- or 16-bit immediate value, adding that value to the AX register.
Or a "move memory to AX" instruction can be followed by a 16-bit memory address
The microcode uses a separate mechanism for fetching these instruction bytes from the queue.
Specifically, each micro-instruction contains a source register and a destination register that specify a data move.
By specifying "Q" (the queue) as the source, a byte is fetched from the prefetch queue.
If the queue is empty, microcode execution blocks until the 
Bus Interface Unit loads a byte into the prefetch queue.
Thus, the complexity of instruction fetching and the prefetch queue is invisible to the microcode.<span id="fnref:memory"><a href="#fn:memory">7</a></span></p>
<p>A jump, subroutine call, or other control flow change causes the prefetch queue to be flushed since the queue contents
are no longer useful.
This is accomplished in microcode with the <code>FLUSH</code> micro-instruction, which resets the queue read and write pointers and
sets the MT (empty) flip-flop.
Note that the queue is flushed even if the target address is in the queue, for example if you jump one byte ahead.</p>
<p>One complication due to the prefetch queue is that the processor's Instruction Pointer points to the next instruction to
be <em>fetched</em>, not the next instruction to be <em>executed</em>.
This becomes a problem for a subroutine call, which needs to push the return address.
It is also a problem for a relative jump, which is computed from the current instruction.
The solution is the <code>CORR</code> micro-instruction, which corrects the Instruction Pointer by subtracting the queue length to
determine the current execution position.
This is implemented by the Bus Interface Unit, which holds correction constants in the Constant ROM, and subtracts them
using the address adder (not the ALU).<span id="fnref:constants"><a href="#fn:constants">8</a></span></p>
<h2>The queue registers</h2>
<p>The 8086 and 8088 partition the registers into upper registers (in the Bus Interface Unit) and lower registers
(in the Execution Unit).
The upper registers are the registers associated with memory accesses (e.g. Instruction Pointer, segment registers)
while the lower registers are more general purpose (e.g. AX, BX, SI, SP).
The upper registers are connected to two 16-bit internal buses: the B bus and the C bus.</p>
<p>The queue registers are physically part of the upper registers, but are wired into the buses slightly differently, as shown below.
In particular, the 8088's queue registers are written 8 bits at a time from the C bus.
(In contrast, the 8086's queue registers can be written 16 bits at a time to support two-byte prefetches.)
When accessing the queue, the queue registers are read 16 bits at a time, but only one byte is transferred to the Q bus for instruction processing.<span id="fnref:motivation"><a href="#fn:motivation">9</a></span></p>

<p>The diagram below shows how the queue registers appear on the die, comparing the six-byte prefetch queue in the 8086 (top) to the four-byte 8088 queue (bottom).
The 8086 prefetch registers are structured as three rows of 16-bit registers, while the 8088 prefetch registers are
structured as four rows of 8-bit registers.
In both cases, each bit is stored in a cross-coupled pair of inverters.
The bit lines (not present) are vertical, while the control lines to select a register are horizontal.
The layout is different between the processors to support 16-bit versus 8-bit writes.
Note the empty space at the bottom of the 8088 registers.
Because the rest of the chips are mostly the same, the 8088 couldn't be "compacted" to avoid this wasted space.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/8086-prefetch8088/8086-vs-8088.jpg"><img alt="The prefetch registers in the 8086 (top) and 8088 (bottom).

For the 8086, the metal and polysilicon layers were removed, exposing the underlying silicon. For the 8088, the polysilicon and silicon are visible.</p>
<p>Intel used simulations to determine the best queue sizes for the 8086 and 8088, balancing the performance cost of prefetching
against the benefit. (The cost is that prefetching makes the bus unavailable for other memory or I/O operations.)
The prefetch queue is discarded on a jump instruction or other change of control flow, causing the prefetched bytes to
be wasted.
Thus, as the queue gets longer, the chance of discarding a prefetched byte becomes larger,
so the potential benefit of prefetching becomes smaller.
Since the 8088 prefetches one byte at a time, compared
to two bytes at a time on the 8086,
prefetching on the 8088 costs twice as much as on the 8086 in terms of bus cycles used per byte.
This changes the tradeoffs in favor of a shorter queue.</p>
<p>Because of the difference in queue lengths, the queue control circuitry is different between the 8086 and 8088.
In particular, the 8086 needs three-bit counters for the
read and write positions, while the 8088 uses two-bit counters.
Because of this, the length computation circuitry is also different between the processors.</p>
<p>I plan to continue reverse-engineering the 8088 die so
follow me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/kenshirriff">@kenshirriff</a> or <a href="https://www.righto.com/feeds/posts/default">RSS</a> for updates.
I've also started experimenting with Mastodon recently as <a href="https://oldbytes.space/@kenshirriff">@oldbytes.space@kenshirriff</a>.
If you're interested in the 8086, I wrote about the <a href="https://www.righto.com/2020/06/a-look-at-die-of-8086-processor.html">8086 die</a>, its <a href="https://www.righto.com/2020/06/die-shrink-how-intel-scaled-down-8086.html">die shrink process</a> and the <a href="https://www.righto.com/2020/07/the-intel-8086-processors-registers.html">8086 registers</a> earlier.</p>

<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>More workspace types:</strong> Currently Lapdev only supports container based workspaces, which has its own limitations for example when you want to run a k8s cluster in your development flow. It's planned to have support for more than containers. VMs and bare metal machine support are on the roadmap. And more OS support is planned as well, e.g. when you are developing a cross platform desktop application for Windows, Linux and macOS, Lapdev can spin up development environments on all of them and you can develop and debug from the same local machine without the need to switch machines.</li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><span>Physical media may be on life-support, but rumors of its demise are overstated. Its heyday as a significant slice of film industry revenue may be over, but there’s good reason to believe the movie-disc will live on as a healthy niche that struggling film industry can’t afford to ignore into the foreseeable future. There may even be some optimism that physical media has already seen its rock-bottom and can only go one direction from here.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Those of us who stopped paying cable bills anytime through the 2000s lived through it. We cheered-on streaming video or the “Subscription Video on Demand” (SVoD) market as it threw a hand grenade into the cable TV industrial complex. But we may not have expected physical media would be collateral damage. A 2023 report from the Digital Entertainment Group says, after over a decade of declines, movie-disc media (DVD/BD/UHD) <a href="https://www.degonline.org/portfolio_page/deg-q2-2023-digital-media-entertainment-report/">revenue dropped an additional 28% through 2023</a>. I wish I had more firm good news for movie-disc media, but I’m remaining optimistic that as the SVoD market matures and passes from its experimental disruptive technology phase, more of us will return to the value in owning the disc again.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span>Peak Streaming TV</span></h2>
<p><span>When streaming came along, video on Demand (VoD) was not a new concept. Cable and satellite services experimented with VoD services as far back as the 90s. But the real innovation with on-demand TV and movies would arrive in the high-speed Internet-era, and it was called Netflix. Honestly, what’s not to love about an ad-free, all-you-can-watch video buffet that can be consumed on any connected screen?&nbsp;</span><span> <br></span></p>
<p><strong><span><a href="https://www.audioholics.com/news/a-return-to-blu-ray-as-streaming-value-evaporates/netflix.jpg/image" title="Netflix N"><img alt="Netflix N" height="200" loading="lazy" src="https://www.audioholics.com/news/a-return-to-blu-ray-as-streaming-value-evaporates/netflix.jpg/image_mini" width="195"></a>Brief Rise of Streaming Timeline:</span><span><br></span></strong></p>
<ul><li>

</li><li>
<p><span>2023 Physical movie-disc media sees its sixteenth straight year of sales decline</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p><span>By the 2010s households across <a href="https://research.mountain.com/trends/streaming-tv-viewing-time-continues-its-rise-over-cable/">America were replacing monthly cable bills</a> that averaged between $80-$200 with a broadband Internet connection and an inexpensive ad-free, unlimited streaming video service called Netflix. When the first major SVoD service was the only game in town it built an audience on licensed TV programming and movies from nearly any network or film studio. Early adopters may remember when a Netflix subscription was only $8/mo and paired with a free, ad-supported Hulu subscription you had a popular one-two punch for movies, legacy and current TV with no cable bill.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Unsustainable Streaming Flood <br></strong></h2>
<p>Did anyone really think the economics of an $8/mo centralized streaming service could last? The cord cutting trend took a <strong>lot</strong> of potential revenue out of the entertainment industry. Meanwhile, movie theater attendance had been in steep decline since long before the virus struck in 2020. Cable TV may have simultaneously been among America’s <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/comcast-is-americas-most-hated-company">most profitable and hated businesses</a>, but it had it all! From outrageous bills to network advertising, cable providers and the networks it carried had such large, often captive markets that it could afford to fund what we call the “golden age of TV” in the late 90s &amp; 2000s.</p>
<p>This may be an unpopular opinion, but early streaming adopters were taking part in an experiment with the Netflix library in its $8/mo-era. We got away with it while we could, but what we were viewing was provided at losses, covered mostly by borrowing and investors to provide us with a preview of a home entertainment future. It was the proverbial free sample of crack to get us hooked. One way or another, the real cost was coming to our homes to roost.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2023, big-tech unlocked the <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/streaming-viewership-overtakes-cable-tv-first-time-rcna43704">“Disrupt Home Entertainment” achievement trophy</a> when cord cutters outnumbered cable subscribers. The big media companies were already working on getting that revenue back when they began to imitate Netflix. The media conglomerates started tech-companies to launch their own streaming services while Netflix built its own legitimate media production company<span><span>—</span></span>what could possibly go wrong?</p>
<p><span>Anonymous TV Industry Insiders | <strong><a href="https://www.vulture.com/2023/06/streaming-industry-netflix-max-disney-hulu-apple-tv-prime-video-peacock-paramount.html">Vulture, June 2023</a>:</strong></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><em><span>“Everything became big tech — the Amazon model of ‘We don’t actually have to make money; we just have to show shareholder growth.’ Everyone said, ‘Great. That seems like the thing to do.’ Which essentially was like, ‘Let’s all commit ritual suicide. Let’s take one of the truly successful money-printing inventions in the history of the modern world — which was the carriage system with cable television — and let’s just end it and reinvent ourselves as tech companies, where we pour billions down the drain in pursuit of a return that is completely speculative, still, this many years into it.’”</span></em></p>
<p><em><span>“I think we may be in the world’s biggest Ponzi scheme.” <br></span></em></p>

<p><span>Now that we’re years into competitive streaming we’ve started to see the cracks. According to one media analyst, as the seemingly unlimited growth of the SVoD market has begun to taper off, <a href="https://businessmodelanalyst.com/is-netflix-profitable/">only Netflix has proved profitable</a> as a standalone streaming business. For some companies, losing money in streaming may be seen as an investment in a retention or marketing strategy for other profitable services. Amazon and Apple may use streaming to promote their services or ecosystem. Disney may have even pitched streaming to its board as marketing for its theme parks and theatrical releases, but that doesn't seem to be working. For film studios sinking in losses at the movies, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1095372/disney-plus-number-of-subscribers-us/">starting a streaming service</a> has been like throwing it an anchor.</span></p>
<p><strong><span><a href="https://www.audioholics.com/news/a-return-to-blu-ray-as-streaming-value-evaporates/RobLongUnspeakable.jpg/image" title="Rob Long Hollywood Exec"><img alt="Rob Long Hollywood Exec" height="200" loading="lazy" src="https://www.audioholics.com/news/a-return-to-blu-ray-as-streaming-value-evaporates/RobLongUnspeakable.jpg/image_mini" width="200"></a>Behind-the-Scenes Hollywood Legend Talks Streaming</span><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Rob Long is a Hollywood writer/executive and podcaster that shares his often humorous takes on the entertainment industry as co-host of the <a href="https://ricochet.com/series/goldberg-long-podhoretz/">Glop Culture podcast</a>. The natural humor he brings to his writing and podcasting is a gift he’s employed since he started in the business writing for the comedy TV show Cheers. Long has had a lot to say about the sorry state of entertainment production in the age of streaming. He seems to imply that production companies building streaming services and tech companies (Netflix, Apple &amp; Amazon) creating studio productions is just bad business. But he says they’ve been able to get away with reckless spending due to a period of low-interest rates and relatively free-flowing investment capital. On the <a href="https://player.fm/series/the-unspeakable-podcast/rob-long-on-how-hollywood-lost-the-plot">Unspeakable podcast with Meghan Daum</a> Rob Long said:</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><em>”Netflix grew on borrowed money… [while production studios] spent on building these stupid companies [streaming services]. There is no reason on Earth why the world needs, or where the economically rational choice would be to build “Paramount Plus”. It’s so lazy, they spent so much money and didn’t even think… they just named everything “Plus”! There’s even an MGM Plus!… When money was essentially free, they made poor decisions… ”</em></span></p>
<p><span>Long has told stories about one important job of a movie producer, working the phone to acquire investment into movies. The business has always worked this way and Long says that throughout film history, the most successful business-sectors in any given era will reliably invest in Hollywood despite its risks. Fortunately for these producers, big companies and the powerful people behind them are charmed by the glamor and prestige of being part of Hollywood while wanting their brands associated with it.</span></p>
<p><span>In earlier eras of entertainment this may have resulted in Mutual of Omaha putting its name on a wildlife documentary series. But the consumer electronics industry took its relationships with Hollywood to the next level in the 1980s by acquiring them, and giving us preview of what was to come. GE acquired RCA which included NBC. Sony bought Columbia pictures to create Sony Pictures. Comcast bought NBC-Universal from GE in 2011. But these days, the most successful business sector is big-tech, which is simultaneously investing in the industry, while gravely disrupting it. The two business-worlds seem to be merging after a catastrophic collision with Netflix that turned the tech-startup culture of investment spending over to Hollywood.<br></span></p>
<h2><strong><span>Drunk with Growth Potential</span></strong></h2>
<p><span>The COVID restrictions of 2020-2021 arrived just as Disney+ and a revamped unified HBO Max (HBO/Warner/Discovery) began. The SVoD market was already ripe for growth, but the COVID-era may have seduced streamers into exaggerated impressions of demand. According to a Deloitte Digital Media Trends study soon after the start of widespread COVID restrictions, the percentage of Americans that <a href="https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/streaming-video-subscriptions-churn-covid-19-deloitte-1234642672/">subscribed to one or more streaming services jumped by about 11%</a>, while the average American household increased the number of streaming services from 3 to 4 while subscriber churn only declined slightly. That’s a little smaller growth than I would have guessed but <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/04/nielsen-finds-connected-tv-viewing-remains-higher-than-pre-covid-19-levels-despite-lockdowns-lifting/">according to Neilson, the real growth</a> during the high-pandemic months was in viewing time.</span><span> From <a href="https://www.nielsen.com/insights/2020/connected-tv-usage-remains-above-pre-covid-19-levels-as-traditional-tv-viewing-normalizes/">Neilson Insights</a>: <br></span></p>
<p><span><em>“During the height of countrywide shelter-in-place orders across the U.S. amid the COVID-19 pandemic, weekly time spent watching connected TVs grew along with overall media use, rising by more than 1 billion hours as the weeks passed.” <br></em></span></p>

<h2><span>2023-2024 - Streaming’s Real Cost Passed to Consumers</span><span>&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p><span>By now we’ve all seen a parade of streaming service price hikes accompanied by lost revenue. Worst of all, we’ve seen movies and shows pulled from the services that produced them. Much of streaming’s new lost media were only produced over the last few years and are now locked away by its intellectual property owner, potentially never to be seen again. That the cost of streaming specific titles is higher than the rewards of its presence on the service speaks to an industry that drank a bit too much of its own Kool-Aid. The money being saved could be hosting cost, per-stream residuals and maybe the service gets a tax write-off. But for some of the freshly pulled Disney+ plus content, it could be a form of reputation management or damage control to keep subscribers from accidentally watching that Willow remake.&nbsp; </span><span><br></span></p>

<h2><span>Streaming Will Only Get Worse</span><strong><span></span></strong><br><strong><span></span></strong></h2>
<p><span>Where will streaming video will go next? My guess is that media conglomerates with ties to communications companies will form a team-up. Comcast (NBCUniversal) and AT&amp;T (Warner) may partner with Disney to take the lead on at least one unified streaming service in a sort-of Hulu 2.0 enterprise that will compete with or absorb Netflix. They’ll find clever ways to sneak more advertising throughout user-interfaces and content, even on more expensive premium “ad-free” subscriptions. Soon, we’ll forget about “cord cutting” and a not-so-new term will re-enter the American entertainment lexicon: “Bundles”. Perhaps a new generation of bundles will be tied to your ISP or wireless network fees and they may even involve contracts to lock you in. It will be just like cable TV, but in the cloud. Streaming can't continue operating at losses for much longer, eventually its true cost will be passed on to consumers. I'm hopeful this may present opportunity for physical media.<br></span></p>

<p><strong><span>Gene summarizes the state of streaming video!</span></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span>Back to Physical Media</span></h2>
<p><span><a href="https://www.audioholics.com/news/a-return-to-blu-ray-as-streaming-value-evaporates/JamesMadison.jpg/image" title="James Madison"><img alt="James Madison" height="142" loading="lazy" src="https://www.audioholics.com/news/a-return-to-blu-ray-as-streaming-value-evaporates/JamesMadison.jpg/image_mini" width="200"></a>I’m not here to tell you that you can <em>stick it to the man</em> through consumption. But by collecting movies on optical-disc in any form, you will at least support a more reliable and egalitarian method of media consumption. You’ll achieve the only real <em>ownership</em> of your movies </span><span>in the true </span><span>constitutional </span><span>sense that exercises your right to private property.</span><span> If James Madison permitted himself such frivolities, he would almost certainly keep a collection of his favorite movies on disc. If you care about sound and video quality, the new generations of optical disc is your best bet this side of <a href="https://dreamediaav.com/collections/kaleidescape?ref=3">Kaliedescape</a>.</span></p>
<p><span>After over a decade of decline, there’s still a robust, if niche market for physical movie-disc media</span><span><span>—</span></span><span>but it needs your support! It may be too soon to provide any solid sales data to support it, but I believe the market for DVD, Blu-ray &amp; 4K Ultra discs may be on the rise. There were plenty of anecdotes from the collector market of individuals <a href="https://www.darkhorizons.com/oppenheimer-4k-disc-sells-out-all-over/">unable to obtain Oppenheimer on 4K Ultra HD</a> the week after release due to demand and that’s a good sign. If physical media can achieve broader market acceptance again, it will have a much better chance of surviving streaming. Streaming affords the studios absolute control of its intellectual property's distribution. But a formidable revenue stream is a fair incentive to include a physical media release into a new movie's life-cycle. But I can only wonder if a niche collector's market will be enough to entice physical media releases far into the future.&nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Conan the Barbarian (1982)</span></strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The movie that got me back into physical media recently was Conan the Barbarian (1982). It has long been one of my favorites. I grew-up reading the old DeCamp edits of the books by Robert E. Howard and the comic adaptations by Roy Thomas. While the Arnold Schwarzenegger movie can be criticized by Howard purists for not giving the character the same backstory as the books, the screen-writing duo of Oliver Stone and John Milius succeeded in capturing the true spirit of the character. </span><span>I will be grateful if the character never receives a new film adaptation that updates </span><span>Conan’s Hyborian Age </span><span>for <em>modern audiences</em>. But I have finally been treated to the definitive Blu-ray version of the classic I've been waiting for.</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><span><a href="https://www.audioholics.com/news/a-return-to-blu-ray-as-streaming-value-evaporates/ConanArrow1.jpg/image_large/image" title="Conan the Barbarian (1982)"><img alt="Conan the Barbarian (1982)" height="720" loading="lazy" src="https://www.audioholics.com/news/a-return-to-blu-ray-as-streaming-value-evaporates/ConanArrow1.jpg/image_large" width="768"></a><br></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Arrow's 2024 Release of </span><span>Conan the Barbarian (1982) Unboxed!<br></span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="https://www.arrowvideo.com/">Arrow Video</a> is a boutique video-disc company that curates classic movies and performs high-quality audio/video transfers for DVD, Blu-ray and 4K UHD. I heard the company had released a limited, definitive remaster of Conan the Barbarian (1982) in UHD with a new Dolby Atmos soundtrack and video lovingly transferred from the original film's negatives. I was hooked because it also includes the classic Milius/Schwarzenegger commentary that I've only heard on an old DVD release, no subsequent Blu-ray until now included it or the ambitious restoration that Arrow performed. The commentary is a <em>must hear</em> for any fan of Milius,&nbsp;</span><span>Schwarzenegger or the 1982 movie, it's comedy gold hearing Milius philosophize over each scene through his distinct "survival of the fittest" outlook while </span><span>Schwarzenegger only really speaks up about his injuries while filming or about his female co-stars.</span><span> </span></p>
<p><span>I couldn’t find the disc anywhere in stock soon after its Jan 30th 2024 release date. It must have been in high demand if the <strong>Sold Out</strong> label on every retail web-page was any indication. Stock of the disc eventually returned to one online supplier the next month and I finally got it into my hands.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When I finally got it home, opening the small box that includes a booklet, silly two-sided poster and hard cardboard slip-cover accompanied by that distinct smell of new media brought back a flood of fond memories of collecting great movies. At no time did I make a conscious decision to abandon physical movie-media, it just sort-of faded out. The fade can be dated across my modest collection at around 2015 when it ground to a halt. But for movie viewing at home, I for one will be subscribing less and the halt on my physical media collecting ends now!<br></span></p>

						<div>
<p>Google is now testing AI overviews in the main Google Search results, even if you have not opted into the <a href="https://searchengineland.com/new-google-search-generative-ai-experience-413533">Google Search Generative Experience</a> labs feature. Google said this is an experience on a “subset of queries, on a small percentage of search traffic in the U.S.,” a Google spokesperson told Search Engine Land.</p>



<p>In May 2023, Google opened up a <a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-opens-access-to-search-generative-experience-today-427572">Search Labs section</a> for searchers to opt in to see and use the Google SGE results, that contained AI overviews. Now some users in the U.S. may see these AI answers without specifically opting in to see them.</p>



<p><strong>What searchers will see. </strong>Google will show AI overviews to a small subset of US users.</p><!-- /1038259/SEL_Post-text -->



<ul>
<li>Google is first starting with a set of queries where it thinks generative AI can be especially helpful.
<ul>
<li>These queries are often more complex, or involve questions where it may be helpful to get information from a range of web pages – like “how do I get marks off painted walls.”&nbsp;</li>



<li>For these tests, Google said it has a high confidence in the quality and value these queries bring to users. In general, Google told us it would show AI overviews when it’s truly additive and in the instances when people would get a better response than what they’d see on Search today.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Google will be testing a few different variations – so what searchers may see in the experiments may not launch broadly to all users in this test.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Why now. </strong>Google told us they are they want to get feedback from searchers who have not opted into SGE specifically. This way they can get feedback and learn how a more general population will find this technology helpful, Google explained.</p>



<p><strong>Ads. </strong>Google will continue to show ads in and around these new AI overview experiences.</p>



<p><strong>Why we care. </strong>These AI answers may push down both the organic and standard search ads. It may result in less, or potentially more, traffic to your site, depending on where the citations are referenced from and where Google places the ads. The likelihood is, these experiences will likely drive less overall traffic to sites than what the current Google Search results do.</p>



<p>Time will tell when Google launches this fully but for right now, you no longer need to be in the SGE labs to see AI overviews, Google is testing it in the wild.</p></div>

You’ve probably experienced it yourself. You step into the shower, stand under the hot water, the aromas of your shampoo and soap lulling you into a relaxed state. Suddenly, your eyes open – the solution to some problem you’ve been struggling with is miraculously clear! Maybe you figured out exactly what to say in that email to your boss. Maybe you remember where you’ve left your car keys. The ‘shower principle’ isn’t just a Redditor’s fantasy. When the brain relaxes sufficiently, creative solutions do appear.&nbsp;</p><figure></figure><p>It’s all down to the power of a particular kind of mindless recharging: namely mind-wandering. According to recent neuroscientific research, even when we’re ‘doing nothing’, our brains are still active. In particular, there’s a region of the brain called the ‘default mode network’ (DMN) that governs the strange places our absent minds go to. The DMN helps us to recall memories, to daydream and to imagine the future. And it becomes more active the less engaged we are with mentally draining tasks.&nbsp;</p><p>The problem with modern life is that we’re not very good at giving ourselves the time and space to activate our DMN. If anything, mind-wandering gets a bad reputation, often being equated with wasting time. Since we usually can’t remember what we were pondering in our daydreams, it’s difficult to imagine that anything beneficial could result from it. We imagine wrong. Doing nothing can be surprisingly productive.&nbsp;</p><p>What would it look like to integrate time for ‘nothing’ into our lives? Well, the simplest way is to actively schedule moments of ‘nothingness’ into your week. Some nights, you don’t need to go for a walk or paint a picture. Some nights, you should simply let yourself zone out. Even put it in your calendar: one evening next week will be your evening of oblivion.&nbsp;</p><p>Alternatively, you might decide that while you’re doing your weekly chores – washing the dishes, hanging up the laundry, or going to the grocery store – you’re not going to listen to anything on your headphones. It’s a counter-intuitive method for productivity enthusiasts, and one that I often have to force myself to partake in. And yet it works.&nbsp;</p><p>It might feel unproductive. But sometimes, it’s just the time your brain needs to wander – and so solve problems with perspectives you didn’t realise you had.&nbsp;</p><p>Even scheduling time for mind-wandering involves doing something. You’re still in productivity mode; it’s just that your productivity is going to be activated by doing as little as possible.&nbsp;</p><p>Sometimes, even this is too much. Back when I was balancing my full-time job as a junior doctor with growing my business, I’d sometimes return home buzzing with energy, eager to dive into filming and editing videos. But other evenings, I was utterly exhausted from a grueling day at the hospital, with every fibre of my being craving the comfort of the sofa and the mindless escape of Netflix.&nbsp;</p><p>On these days, I’d flop onto the sofa. ‘I really need to film this video,’ I’d think. ‘I’ll get up in thirty minutes.’ But as the half-hour wore on, actually filming the video would seem less and less appealing.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>By doing less today, you can do more of what matters to you tomorrow.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Sometimes, my flatmate Molly (also a doctor) would stage an intervention. ‘Ali, if you’re tired, why don’t you just write off the evening and rest?’ she would ask.&nbsp;</p><div>

        </div><p>Her words planted a seed in my mind. What if she was right? Why couldn’t I just write off the evening and truly relax? As I wrestled with this internal conflict, I stumbled upon a term that perfectly encapsulated my newfound perspective: the ‘Reitoff principle’.&nbsp;</p><p>The Reitoff principle is the idea that we should grant ourselves permission to <em>write off </em>a day and intentionally step away from achieving anything. For many of us, the challenge of rest lies in the act of stepping back from the things we think we should be doing. We’re conditioned to value self-control, grit and persistence. We equate rest with laziness, weakness or failure.&nbsp;</p><p>Embracing the Reitoff principle means recognising that – sometimes – it’s worth doing nothing at all. Not having deep shower thoughts. Not having a gentle walk. Nada.&nbsp;</p><p>These days, I use the Reitoff principle to help me feel less guilty about taking time off. When I feel worn down, tired and struggle to find the energy to keep going, I tell myself that it’s ok to give up on the day so that I can do other things guilt-free, like playing video games and ordering takeaway. I tell myself that this short-term ‘unproductiveness’ gives me time to reset and recharge.&nbsp;</p><p>By doing less today, you can do more of what matters to you tomorrow. It also helps me realise that in reality I probably don’t actually want a Reitoff day every day. By allowing yourself to occasionally hit the pause button and step away from the constant pressure, you create space for growth and <a href="https://bigthink.com/business/medici-effect-business/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">creativity</a>.

<p>Zhang Chunyuan had all the makings of a loyal communist. A native of rural Henan, Zhang and his family had only known hard times. The area was always on the verge of famine, and that made many people interested in the Chinese Communist Party’s appeal to social justice and economic development. In Zhang’s case, the Party was also an ersatz family. His mother had died when he was seven and, in his telling, his stepmother had treated him cruelly.</p>



<p>At 13, he ran away from home, never to return. He worked as an apprentice car mechanic and then joined the People’s Liberation Army in 1948 as a 16-year-old. When China entered the Korean War in 1950, he volunteered and was wounded when his convoy was strafed by US fighter planes. His neck was permanently damaged and in 1954 he was discharged. He took advantage of policies favoring veterans and entered Lanzhou University’s history department.</p>



<p>That began his disillusionment with how the Communists were running China. He thought a university would have a magnificent library but found that most books were under lock and key. Lanzhou University didn’t even possess a complete set of the Confucian classics — the basic texts used over the centuries by all literate people — let alone cutting-edge journals. Teaching was worse, with one lecturer for 100 students.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="300" height="434" src="https://chinabooksreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image6-1.png" alt="Zhang Chunyuan in 1956"><figcaption>Zhang Chunyuan in 1956</figcaption></figure>



<p>When the Hundred Flowers Campaign began in 1956, in which the Party encouraged citizens to voice their opinions, Zhang criticized the lack of books and poor teaching. For that, he was accused of trying to overthrow the university and in May 1958, as part of the Anti-Rightist Campaign, he was exiled with a group of forty other students and faculty to Tianshui, a city in the southeast of Gansu province at the boundary of the Loess Plateau and the Qinling Mountains.</p>



<p>In Tianshui, traditional society was being torn apart. Mao’s violent revolution had left temples dedicated to folk deities empty and desecrated. Farms were&nbsp; still divided into small plots for farmers to grow their traditional crop of wheat and sorghum, but every square inch of land in the People’s Republic actually belonged to the state. And for the sharp-eyed, new buildings hinted at the state’s unbridled power. One housed the local Communist Party offices, where Beijing’s orders were disseminated to villagers. Another was a new garage, which held a tractor — the first promise of the Party’s pledge to modernize rural life. The village had just one of the machines, and the farmers shared it. In the past, life centered around communal religious life; now it was to revolve around a new god, science, and its guardian: the Communist Party.</p>







<p>Zhang took up his job at the tractor station with gusto, fixing and driving the valuable piece of equipment. At night he even wrote a film script, “Children of China and North Korea,” which talked about the ties binding the two socialist countries. He used a pseudonym to send it to a movie studio that was sponsoring a competition, and won a prize worth 700 yuan, a small fortune back in the 1950s. The script was set to be produced until the studio delved deeper into the mysterious author and realized that it had been written by a convicted Rightist.</p>



<p>Zhang, though, was irrepressible. As a boy he was given the nickname “Screw” for being unbreakable when his mind was set on something. That made him cut out to lead the other students, because he had the toughness to do more than just talk — he could get things done. But his uncompromising attitude also led him to take huge risks.</p>



<p>In Tianshui, he once heard that a classmate was being detained by railway police several hundred miles south for having illegally ridden the rails to escape the Great Famine of 1959. Zhang forged an identity card as a Public Security officer and traveled down to straighten out the situation. He bluffed his way past railway guards and local police to get the young man released, returning in triumph, convinced that he could achieve anything.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="1004" height="681" src="https://chinabooksreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/tan.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://chinabooksreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/tan.jpg 1004w, https://chinabooksreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/tan-600x407.jpg 600w, https://chinabooksreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/tan-768x521.jpg 768w, https://chinabooksreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/tan-1000x678.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1004px) 100vw, 1004px"><figcaption>Pictures of Tan Chanxue (together with other members of <em>Spark</em> magazine on the right, in 1959)</figcaption></figure>



<p>The group of exiled students often met at Zhang’s tractor station. It was conveniently located on the main road, and Zhang was an amiable and thoughtful host. Broad and strong, with thick eyebrows and a square face, he had sensitive eyes and loved to read. His knowledge complemented his war experiences, which made him more mature than the bookish students. But he didn’t lecture or talk down to them, instead engaging them in long conversations about their country’s future. One point he returned to time and again was how they, even though just exiled students, were duty-bound to help their country.</p>



<p>“He really opposed those who only thought of themselves,” Tan Chanxue, one of the students, recalled in her memoirs. “He never thought that his own liberty counted for much.”</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>Famine was taking hold, and the students saw the gruesome effects firsthand. They were able to withstand the lack of food, but they saw the elderly, the weak, and the very young slowly die</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>In more densely populated areas farther east, the students probably would never have been able to meet at a place like Zhang’s tractor shed. Tianshui, however, was remote and poor, and local officials were eager to promote literacy. So they set up an open university, appointing the students as faculty. That gave the young people an excuse to meet and travel around the region. These face-to-face meetings, they realized, were crucial. Working alone resulted in nothing. A pebble can’t break a rock, Tan said, but perhaps many pebbles tied tightly together could smash it.</p>



<p>Everyone in the group became good friends, but Tan and Zhang were particularly close, later declaring themselves to be husband and wife. A slender 24-year-old with thin, arching eyebrows, Tan came from southern China’s Guangdong province near the Hong Kong border. While Zhang was bullheaded and brusque, she was gentle, with calm eyes and a reasonable demeanor. There were many obstacles to a love in a famine-ridden land run by a totalitarian dictatorship, but their feelings blossomed. Soon, they would risk their lives to prove their love.</p>



<p>By May 1959, the group was debating issues such as how to rid China of the Communist Party, or at least the current leadership that had caused the famine. Zhang said there were two options: a top-down coup or a bottom-up revolution. The latter seemed impossible and so they hoped that Mao’s peers would act. And in fact, something along these lines is what some people in Beijing were planning. Over the summer, one of China’s most-decorated military leaders, Peng Dehuai, challenged Mao for causing the famine, but Mao held a pivotal meeting in the mountain-top retreat of Lushan. Peng was crushed and Mao redoubled his economic policies, causing the famine to deepen, eventually taking up to 45 million lives.</p>



<p>When Peng’s downfall was made public, the students felt certain that they had to act: if even a general at the top could be persecuted for expressing loyal dissent, then the only hope was to foment something at the grass roots. They thought that their best bet was to publish material on the famine in hopes of sharing ideas and opening up officials’ eyes to what was going on in the countryside. They began to think of publishing a journal.</p>







<p>The idea remained vague until they came across a remarkable poem. It was written by a student at Peking University, Lin Zhao, who had been studying in Beijing until she was labeled a Rightist for defending friends who were being persecuted. Lin’s poems galvanized the students, showing them the power of the written word.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="300" height="445" src="https://chinabooksreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image4.jpg" alt="Lin Zhao (undated)"><figcaption>Lin Zhao (undated)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Like Zhang, Lin was more experienced than many of the younger students. Born in 1932, she had worked as a propagandist for the Communists shortly after their takeover in 1949. At the time, she went along with their violent policies and participated in the land reform campaigns that saw hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of property owners murdered — a genocide aimed at eliminating the elite that had run China before the revolution. But with time she began to see that the Communists were not building a utopia but a tightly controlled authoritarian state. As a young girl in pre-Communist China, she had attended a Methodist girl’s school. Now she returned to her faith and experimented with art to express her independence from the party. When her friends were arrested, she wrote a poem declaring:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The power of truth<br>never lies in<br>the arrogant air<br>of the guardians of truth.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Lin later wrote a 240-line poem called “Seagull” and circulated it among friends. One friend was the sister of a member of the group of Tianshui students. The woman mailed a handwritten copy of the poem to the exiled students, who were thrilled by Lin’s bold imagery and overtly political message. The poem tells the story of a ship carrying chained prisoners. Their crime: they seek freedom.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Freedom, I cry out inside me, freedom!<br>The thought of you has filled my heart with yearning,<br>like a choking man gasping for air,<br>like one dying of thirst lurching toward a spring.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Zhang decided that he had to meet the author. After being arrested in Beijing, Lin was released after her chronic tuberculosis worsened, and she began spitting up blood. She moved back to her hometown of Suzhou on China’s east coast. She was immediately put under close surveillance. But Zhang once again took another huge risk, using his forged identity papers to travel days by train and then arranging to meet her. Lin urged Zhang not to print her poem, seeing it a risk to the group and to anyone who read it.</p>



<p>But then Zhang read Lin’s second poem, a 368-line work called “A Day in Prometheus’s Passion.” It used Christ-like motifs that reflected Lin’s renewed Christian faith. The poem tells of an encounter between Zeus and Prometheus, who is chained to a rock for giving humans fire. Zeus explains that his punishment is necessary because humans must never have such an important tool:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>But you ought to know, Prometheus,<br>for the mortals, we do not want to leave even a spark.<br>Fire is for the gods, for incense and sacrifice,<br>how can the plebeians have it for heating or lighting in the dark?&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Zhang convinced Lin to let them publish the poem and decided to put it in the first issue of their new journal. Students from Beijing also passed him materials about how Yugoslavian Communists were trying a hybrid form of socialism that allowed for capitalist-style incentives (something the Communist Party would embrace twenty years later). Zhang decided to add that material, too, to the inaugural issue, as well as essays by himself and others in the group. The journal needed a name. They quickly settled on <em>Spark</em> (星火), based on the idiomatic expression <em>xinghuo liaoyuan, </em>or “a single spark can start a prairie fire.” Mao had also used it in one of his essays, making it widely known.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>A pebble can’t break a rock, Zhang’s partner Tan Chanxue said, but perhaps many pebbles tied tightly together could smash it</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Two members of the group, physics student Miao Qingjiu and chemistry student Xiang Chengjian, were entrusted with printing the first issue. They had been assigned to work at a sulfuric acid plant in the nearby town of Wushan. The plant had an old mimeograph machine, which they could occasionally access. Their jobs also required them to cultivate bacteria used to make fertilizer, a process that required a sealed-off space. This allowed them to bar themselves in the room with the mimeograph machine, claiming that they were making the bacteria.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1200" height="1627" src="https://chinabooksreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image2-1-1200x1627.jpg" alt="The cover page of Spark’s first issue" srcset="https://chinabooksreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image2-1-1200x1627.jpg 1200w, https://chinabooksreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image2-1-600x814.jpg 600w, https://chinabooksreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image2-1-768x1042.jpg 768w, https://chinabooksreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image2-1-737x1000.jpg 737w, https://chinabooksreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image2-1-1133x1536.jpg 1133w, https://chinabooksreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image2-1.jpg 1474w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"><figcaption>The cover page of <em>Spark</em>’s first issue</figcaption></figure>



<p>The two spent eight nights in January 1960 carving the plates by hand — there was no typesetting or other equipment available. The process, though, was too slow. Miao and Xiang would eventually have to open their office, which would endanger the enterprise. As always, Zhang came up with the solution. Inside his tractor shed was an old motor. He gave it to Miao and Xiang, who sold it to their factory cheaply. They used the proceeds to buy a used mimeograph machine. The group kept that at the home of Gu Yan, a graduate student in physics, who lived near Zhang. He also carved essays on that machine’s drums, and drew the magazine’s logo, a torch with a flame leaping upward. They ran off thirty copies. <em>Spark </em>was born.</p>



<p>At just eight pages, handwritten, and with no photos or graphics, Spark was primitive. But it was filled with articles that got to the heart of China’s conundrum — then and now. The lead article on the first page by Gu Yan set the tone. Called “Give Up Your Fantasies and Prepare to Fight!” it asked questions that Chinese people have posed time and again over the decades:</p>



<p>Why did the once progressive Communist Party become so corrupt and reactionary less than ten years after coming to power, with complaints and rebellions at home, and falling into an embarrassing situation abroad? This is because the people’s world is regarded as its private property, and all matters are managed by party members.</p>



<p>One key problem was due to “idol worship” — alluding to the personality cult surrounding Mao Zedong. But it also pointed to broader problems, such as the state’s unlimited powers: “political oligarchs being arrogant, and perverted. If such a dictatorship insists on calling it socialism, it should be a kind of National Socialism monopolized by a political oligopoly. It is of the same type as Nazi National Socialism and has nothing in common with real socialism.”</p>



<p>Writing about the famine, Zhang Chunyuan penned an essay simply titled “Food Matters.” He blamed the Chinese Communist Party for exploiting the farmers: “Today’s ruler, like any ruler in history, used the peasant revolution to climb Tiananmen Square and ascended to the throne.” After that, China’s new rulers trampled on the farmers, leaving them no better than serfs. In another essay, he pointed to the lack of land ownership as a key problem facing farmers.</p>







<p>A few months later, the students met again and decided to make <em>Spark </em>a regular publication. The goal was to mail it to high-level officials in five major cities — Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Xi’an — where the students had contacts. They began writing more essays, including Zhang Chunyuan’s “On People’s Communes,” which dissected how farmers lost their property, and Xiang Chengjian’s “Letter to the People,” a takedown of top leaders:</p>



<p>When millions, tens of millions of farmers starve to death on their beds, on trains, by railroads, at the bottom of a ditch, when hundreds of millions (400 million) people are dying of starvation, when the other 200 million are half-starved. When they are full, those animals who “wholeheartedly” serve the people and are “people’s servants” can buy any snacks, biscuits, candies. … They feasted and walked away (who would dare to ask them for food stamps), and as soon as they arrived, the meal was served.</p>



<p>Xiang continued in this vein by pointing out the moral relativism of China’s top leaders. Decades before Mao’s private doctor shocked the world with his tales of Mao’s sex with young women, Xiang pointed out the hypocrisy of the older men who led China. While appealing to steadfastness and loyalty, they had taken up with younger women, casting aside their wives who had suffered with them while they were fighting for the revolution. Even worse, information had come to light during the Anti-Rightist Campaign showing that many officials freely took the daughters and wives of persecuted families.</p>



<p>Lin Zhao’s poem “Seagull” was also slotted into this issue. It was engraved onto cylinders in addition to Zhang’s “On People’s Communes.” While they were figuring out the logistics of engraving and then distributing their new issue, they ran off 300 copies of Zhang’s article because of its importance in analyzing the root causes of the famine. The idea was to mail out that article first and follow it up with the full issue.</p>



<p>As the second issue neared publication, the group began to debate what to do next. They decided they needed some sort of organization and ways to spread their appeal beyond the narrow group of exiled students. They also felt that someone had to escape from China and find help, or at least get more information about the situation in other socialist countries, such as Yugoslavia. Maybe this would help their country find a way forward.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>The journal’s name was based on the idiomatic expression “a single spark can start a prairie fire,” used by Mao in one of his essays</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Tan Chanxue decided to try to seek help in Hong Kong. She was from Guangzhou, the metropolis not far from the British colony, and she figured she could make her way across the border. The students were some twelve hundred miles away, but China was in such chaos that it wouldn’t appear odd if a university student traveled back to her hometown to find food. So she made her way south by train and stayed with an aunt.</p>



<p>The two women decided to flee together to Hong Kong and hired a human smuggler to spirit them across the border. They dressed as peasant women and walked to a village near the border. The smuggler, however, was inexperienced and led the women straight into the hands of the local militia, who detained them in Shenzhen — back then still a village, and not today’s city of nearly 20 million.</p>



<p>They tried to play the role of peasants, hoping to be let off with a warning for having strayed too close to the border. So when they were allowed out to do manual labor by collecting firewood, the two did so barefoot, although their soft feet were quickly cut by the rough terrain.</p>



<p>Still, no one seemed aware of her true identity until Tan made a fatal mistake. One day, a guard told Tan that if she wanted to post a letter, he would carry it out and post it. She was supposed to be illiterate but decided to use the chance to warn the group around <em>Spark </em>that she had been detained. A few weeks later, she realized her error. She was taken in for interrogation and asked if she knew a man named Gao Chengqing. This was Zhang Chunyuan’s pen name. How did they know about him?</p>



<p>The letter itself wasn’t a trap. It had been delivered, and Zhang had quickly heard that his sweetheart had been detained. He decided to rescue her, just as he had helped out his friend a year earlier. He used the same forged identity card, which gave his identity as his pen name, Gao Chengqing, and traveled south. But the women were being held in a reform-through-labor facility, which was much stricter than the railway police he had fooled before. The prison’s officials immediately saw through his ruse and put him under arrest. Because they didn’t know his real identity, they booked him by his pen name.</p>



<p>Feigning illness, Zhang met a female doctor who was also a prisoner. Feeling he could trust her, he told her that he and Tan were husband and wife and asked her to pass Tan notes. He wrote several, many of them professing his love and hope for a life after imprisonment. He used an intimate form of address, using only the last character of her given name, <em>xue</em>, which means “snow.”</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Snow! It must be a match made in heaven that we can go to jail together. Our feelings will transcend all time and space. May we go out and in, life and death together! The days to come will be long. Take care!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>But the doctor wasn’t willing to risk her future for a man she didn’t know. She could gain by informing on him and, anyway, he himself might be a trick to test her. All of Zhang’s love letters ended up in the authorities’ hands.</p>



<p>The authorities sent a political prisoner to live with Zhang in his cell as a spy. The man befriended Zhang, who again fell for the ploy. Zhang confessed everything, not only their hopes to escape but the existence of <em>Spark</em>. Soon, Zhang and Tan were on a train back to Lanzhou for trial.</p>







<p>By September 1960, the magazine was shut down and the case was cracked. In what became the fourth largest “counter-revolutionary” incident in the country, 43 people were arrested in connection with <em>Spark</em>, including 12 university students, two professors, two graduate students, and 25 farmers.</p>



<p>Revenge was swift. The Party convened a “Ten-Thousand-Person Sentencing Conference” in Lanzhou to hand down the sentences to those who were still in Tianshui. Zhang Chunyuan got life in prison. The students who carved the drums, Miao Qingjiu and Xiang Chengjian, got 20 and 18 years. Others got between 15 and five years.</p>



<p>Tan Chanxue spent 14 years in prison for membership in a “Rightist counterrevolutionary clique.” After that, she was forced to take a factory job in Jiuquan, the city near the Jiabiangou labor camp and the satellite launch facility. It was only after her rehabilitation in 1980 that she could leave the factory. She later joined the Dunhuang Research Academy before retiring to Shanghai in 1998. During a trip back to Tianshui in the 1990s, she met people who still knew her case. Once, a woman grasped her hands and said, “You have suffered so!” Tan could only burst into tears.</p>



<p>She was lucky compared to many of the others. The security apparatus quickly picked up those who had fled Gansu. In Shanghai, the physics student Gu Yan, who had come up with the magazine’s name and logo, received a 17-year sentence. The prison term for Lin Zhao, the poet whose work inspired Zhang to launch the journal, was 20.</p>



<p>Many fought their fate, especially Zhang. In July 1961, he feigned illness and was admitted to hospital. During the midday siesta, while everyone was overcome by the summer heat, he changed into street clothes and walked out of the hospital. He hitched a ride to a nearby town, then walked 19 kilometers to a logging camp where a friend worked.</p>



<p>He lived in his friend’s logging hut, regained his strength, and then set off to Shanghai to see what had become of his friends. He found that Gu Yan had already been arrested. Then he went to the neighboring city of Suzhou to learn that Lin Zhao had also been arrested. He wrote her a postcard, signing it with her mother’s name but figuring that she would recognize his handwriting: “Our life is so rich in materials that we could write a novel that hasn’t been seen in ancient or modern times, at home or abroad. I hope you can read this book, this book that cost us so dearly.”</p>



<p>Zhang then moved on to the nearby city of Hangzhou, feeling guilty that he was free while his friends were in prison. It’s a measure of the turmoil in China brought on by the famine and political instability that he stayed free for so long. But then the inevitable happened. As the famine was brought under control, the government reasserted itself. Zhang was picked up in a street sweep of homeless people. He was identified and sent back to prison in Lanzhou.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>While Zhang was bullheaded and brusque, Tan was gentle, with calm eyes and a reasonable demeanor. They risked their lives to prove their feelings</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>A few years later, the Communist Party’s next convulsion, the Cultural Revolution, proved deadly for some of those in jail. After a brief period of chaos at the start of the Cultural Revolution, the Party promulgated new rules to “strengthen public security work.” That resulted in harsh crackdowns across the country. Young people were once again sent to remote areas to work. Prisons carried out mass executions of convicts.</p>

<p>In 1970, local authorities in Tianshui decided that the new rules meant that Zhang should be executed on the grounds of being in an “active” counterrevolutionary cell — a capital offense. For a few months before his execution, Zhang and Tan were housed in the same prison. Tan wanted Zhang to know, before his death, that she still loved him. She asked someone who delivered him his meals to tell him that “he will always live in my heart.”</p>



<p>Zhang was sent to the Lanzhou Detention Center to be executed. The prison was nicknamed the “kiln,” a castle-like complex with walls 10 meters high and topped with barbed wire. When he entered his final cell, number 12, he was wearing a black cotton prison shirt and trousers, a black cotton cap, and black cotton shoes without laces. Heavy shackles weighing about fifteen kilograms were attached to his ankles, which were wrapped in cotton to prevent bleeding. His hands were cuffed tight behind his back. He could only clutch his sole belongings, a chipped enamel bowl and cup stuffed with a rolled-up white cotton towel. He could drop his trousers to urinate or defecate but inmates had to help him pull them back up.</p>



<p>The dozen or so prisoners in the room roused themselves to look at the condemned man. He apologized for bothering them and waited politely for someone to make space for him to sit down. The men were dumbfounded and soon made space.</p>



<p>The prisoner in charge of the room was a man named Wang Zhongyi. He had been rounded up in a sweep of young people and charged with hooliganism. Now he was under orders to make sure that Zhang didn’t commit suicide. Over the next three days the men became close and Zhang entrusted Wang with telling Tan how much he loved her.</p>



<p>One of the young men asked Zhang if he was scared. His case was serious, wasn’t it? Zhang replied: “Yes, it’s serious: active counterrevolutionary activity.”</p>



<p>Zhang told the men his life story. Then, on March 22 he was led out to the Qilihe Stadium for a mass sentencing. Before he left, he made Wang promise that somehow, someday, he would find Tan and tell her two sentences: “First, I have a clear conscience toward the Party, the country, and the people, and I’m sorry because I can’t accompany her to finish the road of life. Second, she must live well; the future is bright and boundless!”</p>



<p>Zhang was condemned to death and then taken to Willow Gulley in Donggang Township, where he was shot. After his death, a notice was put up in various prisons around the district. One was Tan’s women’s prison. Tan saw it. Within a month her hair had gone white. ∎</p>







<p><strong>Postscript</strong></p>







<p><em>The magazine </em>Spark<em> lasted only a year before it was extinguished. It never circulated nationally. It resulted in no protests or any sort of threat to the government. Over the Chinese Communist Party’s three-quarters of a century in power it is one of countless small acts of outrage against its unchecked powers. And yet, due to case files released in the late 1970s and 1980s, including the love letters between Tan Chanxue and Zhang Chunyuan, the story was preserved. <em>In the 2000s, the underground filmmaker Hu Jie interviewed most of the survivors and in 2013 released online one of his best-known films, </em></em>Spark<em>. Over the past two decades, this story has become a touchstone in Chinese people’s efforts to counter the Party’s efforts to whitewash the past.</em> <em>Read more about it and similar stories in <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/sparks-9780197575505?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;#">Sparks: China’s Underground Historians and their Battle for the Past</a>.</em></p>
