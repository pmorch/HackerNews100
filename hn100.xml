      <p> Monday, September 18, 2023</p>
    
        
          <div><p>The FAA authorized Zipline International, Inc., to deliver commercial packages around Salt Lake City and Bentonville, Arkansas, using drones that fly beyond the operator’s visual line of sight. Read the approval letters <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/document/FAA-2020-0499-0033">here</a> and <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/document/FAA-2020-0529-0009">here</a>. Zipline is an FAA-certificated Part 135 operator and will use its Sparrow drone to release the payload via parachute. Data collected from these operations will inform the FAA’s ongoing policy and rulemaking activities.&nbsp;</p><p>
&nbsp;
The FAA is focused on developing standard rules to make BVLOS operations routine, scalable and economically viable. The agency chartered the <a href="https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/rulemaking/committees/documents/index.cfm/committee/browse/committeeID/837">Beyond Visual Line of Sight Aviation Rulemaking Committee</a> on June 9, 2021 to provide safety recommendations to the FAA. We are reviewing their <a href="https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/rulemaking/committees/documents/media/UAS_BVLOS_ARC_FINAL_REPORT_03102022.pdf">final report</a>.</p><p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
The FAA’s long-term goal is to safely integrate drones into the National Airspace System rather than set aside separate airspace exclusively for drones. This approach is consistent with the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/112th-congress/house-bill/658/text/pl">FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012</a> and the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/636/text">FAA Extension, Safety, and Security Act of 2016</a>. The 2016 Act directed the FAA, in conjunction with NASA, to continue developing a plan for <a href="https://www.faa.gov/uas/research_development/traffic_management">Unmanned Aircraft System Traffic Management (UTM)</a>, which will assist in integration efforts.</p><p>

      <h2>The Story:</h2>
      <p>So I was new to California</p>
      <p>Along with a new convertible, I decide to get some personalized plates.</p>
      <p>I could not believe my luck, when I found out that my initials "NV" (ph. "envy") were available. Not that I think anyone would be envious of me in my Miata, but it seemed like a good idea at the time.</p>
      <p><img src="https://100parkingtickets.com/photos/NV.gif" width="328" height="166"></p>
      <p>But then, I started to get random parking tickets from Los Angeles. Where my car has never been. For every type of car. Except a Mazda. Which is what I drive. No problem, right? Just call them up, deal with a healthy level of skepticism when I tell them the ticket isn't mine...
        no really. I would ask them what make &amp; color the ticket is for. I would ask them what make &amp; color my car is. They would always be different. Even a highly skeptical city clerk can't argue with that.</p>
      <p>Then the notices of unpaid violations slowly start to come in from all over California. Because when the license plate is Not Visible, the charming traffic wardens enter "NV" as the license plate. Sometimes they would explain that it was a training issue and they would soon stop bugging me with
        tickets.</p>
      <p>Then the city of Oakland  has a computer upgrade. The first day I get five tickets. The next day... three. And they kept on sending them. For every type of car imaginable including BMW's and Porsches, every car imaginable, except for a white two door Mazda.</p>
      
      <p><img src="https://100parkingtickets.com/photos/oakland.jpg"></p>
      <p>Now I know what you are thinking, BMW's &amp; Porsches don’t park in Oakland.  I was surprised too. But more than that, I was tired of sitting on hold for twenty minutes, waiting to talk to a skeptical city employee. So I returned the custom plates to the DMV, and someone at Oakland told me that all fifty tickets would be put under administrative review.</p>
      <p>Problem solved? Not even. First, the DMV refused to issue me my registration, until I got a piece of paper saying I was not guilty. Then I received a notice that the Franchise Tax Board wanted to garnish my wages. Not with cilantro either. Then I get a notice stating that any tax refund I get will be going to the City of Oakland.</p>
      <p>That is when I started feeling a little irate.</p>
      <p>And a little wiser. I tried calling my local police department, to see if there was a bench warrant out for my arrest. The friendly officer told me that I would have to come to the office... in person. And I swear, she said this with what sounded like a straight face.</p>
      <p>As a last resort, I started to post the story on the internet. You never know. Someone might want a collection of over fifty parking violations from seven different counties for all different makes and models. The asking price was the total owed on all the tickets... $3000.</p>
      <p>
        The only thing that made me feel a little better, was that the lovely folks at Oakland told me someone driving a BMW had the license plates "NV". So if you see a BMW owner with the plates "NV", give him a wave. Tell him you work for the City of Oakland. For the traffic violations department. See if he goes green. You know, from envy.      </p>
      <p>NV</p>

<p>Shopify deploys YJIT on business-critical services in production,
such as <a href="https://shopify.engineering/how-shopify-reduced-storefront-response-times-rewrite">Storefront Renderer</a>,
the software that powers all online storefronts on Shopify’s platform, and <a href="https://shopify.engineering/shopify-monolith">Shopify’s Monolith</a>.
As of the Ruby 3.2 release, YJIT sped up our Storefront Renderer by <a href="https://twitter.com/paracycle/status/1605706245955997697">10% on average</a>.</p>

<p>Storefront Renderer is a complex application. Your more reasonable-sized app might get better/worse results.
Here are some other YJIT performance results in production outside Shopify:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Discourse: <a href="https://blog.discourse.org/2023/05/running-ruby-3-2s-yjit-in-production-at-discourse/">15.8-19.6% speedup</a></li>

<p>We sometimes hear people say YJIT doesn’t speed up their application or uses too much memory.
The following documentation covers some tips for tuning YJIT in such cases.</p>

on Sep 14th, 2023. We compared the performance of Ruby 3.2 YJIT, Ruby 3.3-preview2 YJIT, and Ruby 3.3-preview2 interpreter
on the Storefront Renderer. It’s a large-scale service with the following properties:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Depends on over 220 Ruby gems</li>
  <li>Over 4.5 million e-commerce sites are built with Shopify (source: <a href="https://builtwith.com/">builtwith.com</a>)</li>
  <li>Capable of serving over 75 million requests per minute, 3TB/minute of traffic</li>
  <li>1.27 million requests per second</li>
  <li>Processed over 197B$ in transaction volume in 2022</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="ruby-33-yjit-is-13-faster-than-ruby-32-yjit">Ruby 3.3 YJIT is 13% faster than Ruby 3.2 YJIT</h2>

<p>We deployed Ruby 3.2.2 YJIT and Ruby 3.3.0-preview2 YJIT to different clusters that receive an equal amount of traffic.
We compared their response times in a 24-hour window on a weekday.</p>

<p><img src="https://railsatscale.com/2023-09-18-ruby-3-3-s-yjit-runs-shopify-s-production-code-15-faster/3.2-3.3-yjit.png" alt="Ruby 3.3 YJIT vs Ruby 3.2 YJIT"></p>

<p>The numbers and the graph show Ruby 3.3.0-preview2 YJIT’s average/p50/p90/p99 response time speedup ratio over
Ruby 3.2.2 YJIT’s. Higher is better for Ruby 3.3.0-preview2 YJIT.</p>

<p>This shows that Ruby 3.3.0-preview2 YJIT is 13% faster than Ruby 3.2.2 YJIT on average.
If you’re using Ruby 3.2 YJIT, upgrading Ruby to 3.3 should give you a 13% speedup.</p>

<h2 id="ruby-33-yjit-is-15-faster-than-the-ruby-33-interpreter">Ruby 3.3 YJIT is 15% faster than the Ruby 3.3 interpreter</h2>

<p>During the same 24-hour window, we also deployed Ruby 3.3.0-preview2 interpreter to another cluster.
We compared its performance against that of the cluster with Ruby 3.3.0-preview2 YJIT.</p>

<p><img src="https://railsatscale.com/2023-09-18-ruby-3-3-s-yjit-runs-shopify-s-production-code-15-faster/3.3-interp-yjit.png" alt="Ruby 3.3 YJIT vs Ruby 3.3 interpreter"></p>

<p>The numbers and the graph show Ruby 3.3.0-preview2 YJIT’s average/p50/p90/p99 response time speedup ratio over
Ruby 3.3.0-preview2 interpreter’s. Higher is better for Ruby 3.3.0-preview2 YJIT.</p>

<p>When you run Ruby 3.3 interpreter, just enabling YJIT will give you a 15% speedup.</p>

<h2 id="why-is-it-faster">Why is it faster?</h2>

<h3 id="new-register-allocator">New register allocator</h3>

<p>The CRuby interpreter writes and reads temporary values on memory.
Ruby 3.2 YJIT used to work in the same way for compatibility reasons,
but Ruby 3.3 YJIT is able to allocate registers to those operations.
In general, accessing CPU registers is much faster than communicating with memory,
so Ruby code runs faster with the optimization.</p>

<h3 id="more-code-now-gets-jit-compiled">More code now gets JIT compiled</h3>

<p>Ruby 3.3 YJIT supports compiling more kinds of Ruby code than Ruby 3.2 YJIT.
When a method has optional arguments, Ruby 3.2 YJIT compiles only one combination of parameter precenses,
but Ruby 3.3 YJIT handles multiple combinations.
Ruby 3.2 YJIT does not compile code that is executed after <code>break</code>, <code>next</code>, <code>redo</code>, <code>retry</code>, etc.,
but Ruby 3.3 YJIT does.
Ruby 3.2 YJIT gives up compiling a method call when it does not support the method call type,
but Ruby 3.3 YJIT falls back to an implementation that can handle anything.</p>

<p>In a nutshell, more code runs on JIT with Ruby 3.3 YJIT than Ruby 3.2 YJIT, so it’s faster.</p>

<h2 id="towards-the-ruby-330-release">Towards the Ruby 3.3.0 release</h2>

<h3 id="reducing-memory-overhead">Reducing memory overhead</h3>
<p>Since Ruby 3.3.0-preview2 YJIT generates more code than Ruby 3.2.2 YJIT, this can result in YJIT having a higher memory overlead.
We put a lot of effort into making metadata more space-efficient, but it still uses more memory than Ruby 3.2.2 YJIT.
We’re looking into skipping compilation of paths that are less frequently executed.</p>

<h3 id="optimizing-method-calls">Optimizing method calls</h3>
<p>Ruby’s method calls are complex. YJIT code spends a lot of time bookkeeping frames for method calls.
We’re working on making any method calls faster by packing frame metadata into a single pointer
and lazily materializing its fields when necessary. Hopefully, it will greatly speed up method calls
as well as reducing the code size.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Ruby 3.2 YJIT has optimized the production workloads of Shopify and other companies.
We encourage you to enable YJIT in production.
Once Ruby 3.3 is released, it should make your application even faster.</p>

<p>Months after Ángel García Padrón fixed a German journalist’s MacBook Pro in his small Havana repair shop, she sent him an email. García Padrón had mended her waterlogged laptop after her home in Cuba flooded, but when the journalist took it to an official Apple Store in Berlin, the authorized repair person had expressed disbelief, saying there was no trace of any water damage at all. “Then my Cuban repairman must be a magician,” she recounted telling the Apple worker. García Padrón is used to conjuring these sorts of tricks on a daily basis — the skills required to deal with Apple products in Cuba require a special sort of magic.</p>



<p>Even though prohibition limiting the exportation, re-exportation, sale, and supply of Apple products to Cuba was <a href="https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/documents/pdfs/2796-20210811-fact-sheet-supporting-the-cuban-people-s-right-to-seek-receive-and-impart-information-through-safe-and-secure-access-to-the-internet/file">eased in 2015</a>, getting a hold of, operating, and maintaining them can still be a challenge. This is in part because basic replacement parts are difficult to import, since they cannot be purchased directly from Apple. It’s not just hardware, either: Downloading apps or software updates is tricky because Cuban IP addresses are blocked. And setting up a new Apple ID with two-factor verification requires a phone number from outside Cuba.</p>



<p>García Padrón is part of an exclusive circle of Apple enthusiasts who are defying Cuba’s constraints to create profitable repair businesses. In little more than a decade, these Cuban Apple technicians have evolved from casual tinkerers to a small yet thriving community of celebrity repairers, respected by locals and foreigners alike.</p>



<p>The absence of official Apple stores and product resellers in Cuba has fostered a community-driven ecosystem that relies on unofficial suppliers and a transnational network of individuals who can travel abroad to buy hardware replacement parts. Technicians told <em>Rest of World</em> there are only a handful of Apple repair shops in Cuba, mostly clustered in Havana; it’s difficult to pinpoint the exact number as there are no official statistics.</p>



<p>Orlando Gutiérrez is one Cuban trailblazer who opened Meca Móvil, his own iPhone repair shop in Havana’s Vedado neighborhood. Finding an Android repairperson, he told <em>Rest of World</em>, is easy enough. “You might even find a few on a single block,” he said. “But a Mac technician is the holy grail.”</p>



<p>From the moment Meca Móvil officially opened its doors in 2011, Gutiérrez began to service the phones of Cuba’s elite creative class and local celebrities — the type of people who had the means to travel abroad and buy an Apple device back then. One of his loyal customers was the reggaeton singer Yosdani Jacob Carmenates, or Jacob Forever, known for his chart-topping track <em>La Gozadera</em>. Gutiérrez said the singer bought an iPhone during a visit to Miami, but then found that he was completely unable to use it upon his return to Havana. He couldn’t install apps or update his phone’s software — until he visited Meca Móvil.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These cases are the easiest to fix, said Gutiérrez. The first step is to install a virtual private network (VPN) to disguise the device’s presence in Cuba. For VIP customers like Jacob Forever, Meca Móvil’s Apple troubleshooters would also install a bundle of commonly used apps. Back when he first started out, before 3G connectivity was widely available, Gutiérrez vividly remembers clients asking for apps like the offline version of Wikipedia (which he described as “Cuban Google”). Though times have changed — clients now ask for Duolingo, online banking app Banca Remota, or streaming platforms like Netflix — this service remains much the same. Though Meca Móvil shut down in 2015, Gutiérrez is now an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@CubaGeek">Apple-specialized YouTuber</a>.</p>



<p>This arrangement proved particularly valuable during a time when <a href="https://restofworld.org/2020/the-life-and-death-of-snet-havanas-alternative-internet/">public internet access points in Cuba were scarce</a> and unaffordable for most people. Some Apple technicians discovered a workaround by securing state jobs that guaranteed internet connectivity, allowing them to regularly download apps and software they would later install in customers’ devices. Despite the Cuban peso’s devaluation over the past several years, the cost of installing an app package has consistently stayed within the range of $1–$5.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, as Cubans have gained <a href="https://restofworld.org/2023/cuba-e-commerce-boom/">greater access to tech from abroad</a>, services like creating Apple IDs and removing carrier locks on iPhones are still in demand — for which local technicians have developed their own creative strategies. To create an Apple ID, without which many of the phone’s functions won’t work, repair people must provide a foreign phone number to pass the two-factor authentication process. To accomplish this, they use free websites like TextNow, which offer users unlimited SMS messages and calls from outside of Cuba.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>“There’s a magic in fixing what others would have otherwise discarded.”</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Many Cubans will often ask repair people like García Padrón to install Windows on their Apple laptops. While MacBooks have become a status symbol across Havana’s universities and creative industries, many still prefer the Windows operating system as it’s easier to use in Cuba.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Users with iPhones from U.S. cellphone carriers like AT&amp;T, Verizon, or T-Mobile need a technician to remove the lock tying the device to its carrier so it can be used with a Cuban SIM card. Technicians also offer recurring services, such as periodically updating devices, which allows them to develop a sustainable business model and loyal customer base.</p>



<p>These Apple repair shops thrived after 2011, when an economic reform authorized <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/latinoamerica-cuba-reforma-trabajo-idLTASIE7060I020110107">75,000 licenses</a> for entrepreneurs to establish small businesses, ranging from rental homes to electronic repair. However, while the licenses granted legality to the technicians’ economic activity, limitations persist regarding their capacity to import equipment and replacement parts from abroad.</p>



<p>In April, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/michel.alvarezmorales/posts/10228678629012525?ref=embed_post">Michel Álvarez Morales expressed his frustration on Facebook</a> after a Hanchen LCD screen separator machine — commonly used to repair smartphones — was confiscated by Cuban Customs because the technician did not have an import permit. Technicians responded to the post, complaining<strong> </strong>about the difficulties they face in procuring simple tools like screwdrivers, microscopes, or welding machines.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During the pandemic, when there was a limited number of flights to Cuba, 23-year-old Chris Gámez Ruiz needed to fix his MacBook Air’s keyboard. The Havana resident had purchased the laptop via Facebook for about 12,000 Cuban pesos (around $100 at the time). While he wasn’t drawn to the laptop’s design, he bought it as a “status symbol,” he told <em>Rest of World</em>, despite the fact that its keyboard was already broken when he bought it.</p>



<p>Gámez Ruiz hired one of Cuba’s most sought-after MacBook technicians: Raiko Israel Pupo Hondal, the founder of Railab, an Apple repair shop in the Reparto Kohly neighborhood of Havana. A year after graduating with a degree in telecommunications, Pupo Hondal began working at a laptop repair shop, where he discovered the unique satisfaction of tackling challenging Mac-related issues that left other technicians stumped.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pupo Hondal first tried to order a replacement keyboard from abroad, but was unsuccessful. He then decided to replace it with another old keyboard that “only” had four broken keys. Gámez Ruiz was happy enough with the repair and paid Pupo Hondal with a broken iMac. After all its useful pieces were extracted, the iMac was displayed as a decorative piece in Railab, alongside a collection of other old and gutted Mac computers that have been recycled over a span of six years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We Cubans are used to doing more with less,” Pupo Hondal told <em>Rest of World.</em> “Each Mac we successfully fix is a Mac we rescue from being discarded as waste — and even those we can’t fix, find new purpose in saving others. There’s a magic in fixing what others would have otherwise discarded.”</p>

I'm smart and read the title of this blog post so I know that this is most definitely not a circle."</p><p>Well it is. Specifically it is a raster image of a circle that I created with the Gimp just for this use.</p><p>However almost every "circle" you can see in printed media (and most purely digital ones) are not, in fact, circles. Why is this?</p><p>Since roughly the mid 80s all "high quality" print jobs have been done either in PostScript or, nowadays almost exclusively, in PDF. They use the same basic drawing model, which does not have a primitive for circles (or circle arcs). The only primitives they have are straight line segments, rectangles and Bézier curves. None of these can be used to express a circle accurately. You can only do an approximation of a circle but it is always slightly eccentric. The only way to create a proper circle is to have a raster image like the one above.</p><h2>Does this matter in the real world?</h2><p>For printing probably not. Almost nobody can tell the difference between a real circle and one that has been approximated with a Bézier curve with just four points. Furthermore, the human vision system is a bit weird and perfect circles look vertically elongated. You have to make them non-circular for people to consider them properly circular.</p><p>But suppose you want to use one of these things:</p><p><a href="https://api.hel.fi/respa/resource_image/797?dim=700x420"><img data-original-height="420" data-original-width="700" height="192" src="https://api.hel.fi/respa/resource_image/797?dim=700x420" width="320"></a></p><p>This is a laser cutter that takes its "print jobs" as a PDF file and uses its vector drawing commands to drive the cutting head. This means that it is impossible to use it to print a wheel. You'd need to attach the output to a lathe and sand it down to be round so it actually functions as a wheel rather than as a vibration source.</p><p>Again one might ask whether this has any practical impact. For this case, again, probably not. But did you know that one of the cases PDF is being considered (and, based on Internet rumors, is already being used) is as an interchange format for CAD drawings? Now it suddenly starts mattering. If you have any component where getting a really accurate circle shape is vital (like pistons and their holes), suddenly all your components are slightly misshaped. Which would not be fun.</p><h2>Extra bonus information</h2><p>Even though it is impossible to construct a path that is perfectly circular, PDF does provide a way to draw a filled circle. Here is the relevant snippet from the PDF 2.0 spec, subsection 8.5.3.2:</p><blockquote><p>If a subpath is degenerate (consists of a single-point closed path or of two or more points at the same coordinates), the S operator shall paint it only if round line caps have been specified, producing a filled circle centred at the single point.</p></blockquote><p>Who is willing to put money on the line that every PDF rendering implementation actually uses circles rather than doing the simple thing of approximating it with Béziers?</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-slug="/blog/loopvar-preview">
    
    <h2><a href="https://go.dev/blog/">The Go Blog</a></h2>
    

    
      
      
      
      <p>Go 1.21 includes a preview of a change to <code>for</code> loop scoping
that we plan to ship in Go 1.22,
removing one the most common Go mistakes.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>
<p>If you’ve written any amount of Go code, you’ve probably made the mistake
of keeping a reference to a loop variable past the end of its iteration,
at which point it takes on a new value that you didn’t want.
For example, consider this program:</p>
<pre><code>func main() {
    done := make(chan bool)

    values := []string{"a", "b", "c"}
    for _, v := range values {
        go func() {
            fmt.Println(v)
            done &lt;- true
        }()
    }

    // wait for all goroutines to complete before exiting
    for _ = range values {
        &lt;-done
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The three created goroutines are all printing the same variable <code>v</code>,
so they usually print “c”, “c”, “c”, instead of printing “a”, “b”, and “c” in some order.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://go.dev/doc/faq#closures_and_goroutines" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Go FAQ entry “What happens with closures running as goroutines?”</a>,
gives this example and remarks
“Some confusion may arise when using closures with concurrency.”</p>
<p>Although concurrency is often involved, it need not be.
This example has the same problem but no goroutines:</p>
<pre><code>func main() {
    var prints []func()
    for i := 1; i &lt;= 3; i++ {
        prints = append(prints, func() { fmt.Println(i) })
    }
    for _, print := range prints {
        print()
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>This kind of mistake has caused production problems at many companies,
including a
<a href="https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/master/design/60078-loopvar.md" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">publicly documented issue at Lets Encrypt</a>.
In that instance, the accidental capture of the loop variable was spread across
multiple functions and much more difficult to notice:</p>
<pre><code>// authz2ModelMapToPB converts a mapping of domain name to authz2Models into a
// protobuf authorizations map
func authz2ModelMapToPB(m map[string]authz2Model) (*sapb.Authorizations, error) {
    resp := &amp;sapb.Authorizations{}
    for k, v := range m {
        // Make a copy of k because it will be reassigned with each loop.
        kCopy := k
        authzPB, err := modelToAuthzPB(&amp;v)
        if err != nil {
            return nil, err
        }
        resp.Authz = append(resp.Authz, &amp;sapb.Authorizations_MapElement{
            Domain: &amp;kCopy,
            Authz: authzPB,
        })
    }
    return resp, nil
}
</code></pre>
<p>The author of this code clearly understood the general problem, because they made a copy of <code>k</code>,
but it turns out <code>modelToAuthzPB</code> used pointers to fields in <code>v</code> when constructing its result,
so the loop also needed to make a copy of <code>v</code>.</p>
<p>Tools have been written to identify these mistakes, but it is hard to analyze
whether references to a variable outlive its iteration or not.
These tools must choose between false negatives and false positives.
The <code>loopclosure</code> analyzer used by <code>go vet</code> and <code>gopls</code> opts for false negatives,
only reporting when it is sure there is a problem but missing others.
Other checkers opt for false positives, accusing correct code of being incorrect.
We ran an analysis of commits adding <code>x := x</code> lines in open-source Go code,
expecting to find bug fixes.
Instead we found many unnecessary lines being added,
suggesting instead that popular checkers have significant false positive rates,
but developers add the lines anyway to keep the checkers happy.</p>
<p>One pair of examples we found was particularly illuminating:</p>
<p>This diff was in one program:</p>
<pre><code>     for _, informer := range c.informerMap {
+        informer := informer
         go informer.Run(stopCh)
     }
</code></pre>
<p>And this diff was in another program:</p>
<pre><code>     for _, a := range alarms {
+        a := a
         go a.Monitor(b)
     }
</code></pre>
<p>One of these two diffs is a bug fix; the other is an unnecessary change.
You can’t tell which is which unless you know more about the types
and functions involved.</p>
<h2 id="the-fix">The Fix</h2>
<p>For Go 1.22, we plan to change <code>for</code> loops to make these variables have
per-iteration scope instead of per-loop scope.
This change will fix the examples above, so that they are no longer buggy Go programs;
it will end the production problems caused by such mistakes;
and it will remove the need for imprecise tools that prompt users
to make unnecessary changes to their code.</p>
<p>To ensure backwards compatibility with existing code, the new semantics
will only apply in packages contained in modules that declare <code>go 1.22</code> or
later in their <code>go.mod</code> files.
This per-module decision provides developer control of a gradual update
to the new semantics throughout a codebase.
It is also possible to use <code>//go:build</code> lines to control the decision on a
per-file basis.</p>
<p>Old code will continue to mean exactly what it means today:
the fix only applies to new or updated code.
This will give developers control over when the semantics change
in a particular package.
As a consequence of our <a href="https://go.dev/blog/toolchain">forward compatibility work</a>,
Go 1.21 will not attempt to compile code that declares <code>go 1.22</code> or later.
We included a special case with the same effect in
the point releases Go 1.20.8 and Go 1.19.13,
so when Go 1.22 is released,
code written depending on the new semantics will never be compiled with
the old semantics, unless people are using very old, unsupported Go versions](/doc/devel/release#policy).</p>
<h2 id="previewing-the-fix">Previewing The Fix</h2>
<p>Go 1.21 includes a preview of the scoping change.
If you compile your code with <code>GOEXPERIMENT=loopvar</code> set in your environment,
then the new semantics are applied to all loops
(ignoring the <code>go.mod</code> <code>go</code> lines).
For example, to check whether your tests still pass with the new loop semantics
applied to your package and all your dependencies:</p>
<pre><code>GOEXPERIMENT=loopvar go test
</code></pre>
<p>We patched our internal Go toolchain at Google to force this mode during all builds
at the start of May 2023, and in the past four months
we have had zero reports of any problems in production code.</p>
<p>You can also try test programs to better understand the semantics
on the Go playground by including a <code>// GOEXPERIMENT=loopvar</code> comment
at the top of the program, like in <a href="https://go.dev/play/p/YchKkkA1ETH" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">this program</a>.
(This comment only applies in the Go playground.)</p>
<h2 id="fixing-buggy-tests">Fixing Buggy Tests</h2>
<p>Although we’ve had no production problems,
to prepare for that switch, we did have to correct many buggy tests that were not
testing what they thought they were, like this:</p>
<pre><code>func TestAllEvenBuggy(t *testing.T) {
    testCases := []int{1, 2, 4, 6}
    for _, v := range testCases {
        t.Run("sub", func(t *testing.T) {
            t.Parallel()
            if v&amp;1 != 0 {
                t.Fatal("odd v", v)
            }
        })
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>In Go 1.21, this test passes because <code>t.Parallel</code> blocks each subtest
until the entire loop has finished and then runs all the subtests
in parallel. When the loop has finished, <code>v</code> is always 6,
so the subtests all check that 6 is even,
so the test passes.
Of course, this test really should fail, because 1 is not even.
Fixing for loops exposes this kind of buggy test.</p>
<p>To help prepare for this kind of discovery, we improved the precision
of the <code>loopclosure</code> analyzer in Go 1.21 so that it can identify and
report this problem.
You can see the report <a href="https://go.dev/play/p/WkJkgXRXg0m" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">in this program</a> on the Go playground.
If <code>go vet</code> is reporting this kind of problem in your own tests,
fixing them will prepare you better for Go 1.22.</p>
<p>If you run into other problems,
<a href="https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/LoopvarExperiment#my-test-fails-with-the-change-how-can-i-debug-it" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">the FAQ</a>
has links to examples and details about using a tool we’ve written to identify
which specific loop is causing a test failure when the new semantics are applied.</p>
<h2 id="more-information">More Information</h2>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
	


<h2>Introduction</h2>



<p>As a software architect dealing with a lot of Microservices based systems, I often encounter the ever-repeating question – “should I use RabbitMQ or Kafka?”. For some reason, many developers view these technologies as interchangeable. While this is true for some cases, there are various underlying differences between these platforms. As a result, different scenarios require a different solution and choosing the wrong one might severely impact your ability to design, develop, and maintain your software solution.</p>



<p>The goal of this blog post is first to introduce the basic asynchronous messaging patterns. Then, it continues to present both RabbitMQ and Kafka and their internal structure. <a href="https://eranstiller.com/rabbitmq-vs-kafka-an-architects-dilemma-part-2">Part 2</a> highlights the critical differences between these platforms, their various advantages and disadvantages, and how to choose between the two.</p>



<h2>Asynchronous Messaging Patterns</h2>



<p>Asynchronous messaging is a messaging scheme where message production by a producer is decoupled from its processing by a consumer.  When dealing with messaging systems, we typically identify two main messaging patterns – Message Queuing and Publish/Subscribe.</p>



<h3>Message Queueing</h3>



<p>In the Message Queuing communication pattern, queues temporally decouple producers from consumers. Multiple producers can send messages to the same queue; however, when a consumer processes a message, it is locked or removed from the queue and is no longer available. Only a single consumer consumes a specific message.</p>


<div>

<p>As a side note, if the consumer fails to process a certain message, the messaging platform typically returns the message to the queue where it is made available for other consumers. Besides temporal decoupling, queues allow us to scale producers and consumers independently as well as providing a degree of fault-tolerance against processing errors.</p>



<h3>Publish/Subscribe</h3>



<p>In the Publish/Subscribe (or Pub/Sub) communication pattern, a single message can be received and processed by multiple subscribers concurrently.</p>


<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" width="675" height="369" src="https://eranstiller.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/RabbitMQ-vs-Kafka-PubSub.svg" alt="An illustration of a pub/sub message exchange"><figcaption>Publish/Subscribe</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>This pattern allows a publisher, for example, to notify all subscribers that something has happened in the system. Many queueing platforms often associate pub/sub with the term&nbsp;<strong>topics</strong>. In RabbitMQ, topics are a specific type of pub/sub implementation (a type of exchange to be exact), but during this post, I refer to topics as a representation of pub/sub as a whole.</p>



<p>Generically speaking, there are two types of subscriptions:</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>An ephemeral subscription</strong>, where the subscription is only active as long the consumer is up and running. Once the consumer shuts down, its subscription and yet-to-be processed messages are lost.</li>



<li><strong>A durable subscription</strong>, where the subscription is maintained as long as it is not explicitly deleted. When the consumer shuts down, the messaging platform maintains the subscription and message processing can be resumed later.</li>
</ol>



<h3>RabbitMQ</h3>



<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener">RabbitMQ</a>&nbsp;is an implementation of a&nbsp;<strong>Message Broker</strong>, and as is also often referred to as a&nbsp;<strong>Service Bus</strong>. It natively supports both messaging patterns described above. Other popular implementations of message brokers include&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://activemq.apache.org/" rel="noreferrer noopener">ActiveMQ</a>,&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://zeromq.org/" rel="noreferrer noopener">ZeroMQ</a>,&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/service-bus/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Azure Service Bus</a>, and&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS)</a>. All of these implementations have a lot in common; many concepts described in this post apply to most of them.</p>



<h3>Queues</h3>



<p>RabbitMQ supports classic message queuing out of the box. A developer defines named queues, and then publishers can send messages to that named queue. Consumers, in turn, use the same queue to retrieve messages to process them.</p>



<h3>Message Exchanges</h3>



<p>RabbitMQ implements Pub/Sub via the use of message exchanges. A publisher publishes its messages to a message exchange without knowing who are the subscribers of these messages. Each consumer wishing to subscribe to an exchange creates its queue; the message exchange then queues produced messages for consumers to consume. It can also filter messages for some subscribers based on various routing rules.</p>


<div>

<p>It is important to note that RabbitMQ supports both ephemeral and durable subscriptions. A consumer can decide the type of subscription they’d like to employ via RabbitMQ’s API.</p>



<p>Due to RabbitMQ’s architecture, we can also create a hybrid approach where some subscribers form&nbsp;<strong>consumer groups</strong>&nbsp;who work together processing messages in the form of competing consumers over a specific queue. In this manner, we implement the pub/sub pattern while also allowing some subscribers to scale-up to handle received messages.</p>

<h2>Apache Kafka</h2>



<p><a target="_blank" href="https://kafka.apache.org/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apache Kafka</a>&nbsp;is&nbsp;<em>not&nbsp;</em>an implementation of a message broker. Instead, it is a&nbsp;<strong>distributed streaming platform</strong>. Unlike RabbitMQ, which is based on queues and exchanges, Kafka’s storage layer is implemented using a partitioned transaction log. Kafka also provides a Streams API to process streams in real-time and a Connectors API for easy integration with various data sources, however, these are out of scope for this post.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Cloud Vendors provide alternative solutions for Kafka’s storage layer. These solutions include&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/event-hubs/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Azure Event Hubs</a>, and to some extent,&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/data-streams/" rel="noreferrer noopener">AWS Kinesis Data Streams</a>. There are also cloud-specific and open source alternatives to Kafka’s stream processing capabilities, but again, these are out of scope for this post.</p>



<h3>Topics</h3>



<p>Kafka does not implement the notion of a queue. Instead, Kafka stores collections of records in categories called topics. For each topic, Kafka maintains a partitioned log of messages. Each partition is an ordered, immutable sequence of records where messages are continually appended. Kafka appends messages to these partitions as they arrive. By default, it uses a round-robin partitioner to spread messages uniformly across partitions. Producers can modify this behavior to create logical streams of messages. For example, in a multitenant application, we might want to create logical message streams according to every message’s tenant Id. In an IoT scenario, we might want to have each producer’s identity map to a specific partition constantly. Making sure that all messages from the same logical stream map to the same partition guarantees their delivery in-order to consumers.</p>


<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="571" height="396" src="https://eranstiller.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/RabbitMQ-vs-Kafka-Kafka-Producers.svg" alt="An illustration of producers for a Kafka topic and its inner structure"><figcaption>Kafka Producers</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Consumers consume messages by maintaining an offset (or index) to these partitions and reading them sequentially. A single consumer can consume multiple topics, and consumers can scale-up to the number of partitions available. As a result, when creating a topic, one should carefully consider the expected throughput of messaging on that topic. A group of consumers working together to consume a topic is called a&nbsp;<strong>consumer group</strong>. Kafka’s API typically handles the balancing of partition processing between consumers in a consumer group and storing consumers’ current partition offsets.</p>


<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="562" height="330" src="https://eranstiller.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/RabbitMQ-vs-Kafka-Kafka-Consumers.svg" alt="An illustration of consumer groups for a Kafka topic and its inner structure"><figcaption>Kafka Consumers</figcaption></figure></div>


<h3>Implementing Messaging Patterns with Kafka</h3>



<p>Kafka’s implementation maps quite well to the pub/sub pattern. A producer can send messages to a specific topic, and multiple consumer groups can consume the same message. Each consumer group can scale individually to handle the load. Since consumers maintain their partition offset, they can choose to have a durable subscription that maintains its offset across restarts or an ephemeral subscription, which throws the offset away and restarts from the latest record in each partition every time it starts up.&nbsp;However, it is a less than perfect fit for the message queuing pattern. Of course, we could have a topic with just a single consumer group to emulate classic message queuing. Nevertheless, this has multiple drawbacks that <a href="https://eranstiller.com/rabbitmq-vs-kafka-an-architects-dilemma-part-2">part 2</a> of this post discusses at length.</p>



<p>It is important to note that Kafka retains messages in partitions up to a preconfigured period, regardless of whether consumers consumed these messages. This retention means that consumers are free to reread past messages. Furthermore, developers can also use Kafka’s storage layer for implementing mechanisms such as Event Sourcing and Audit Logs.</p>



<h2>Closing Words</h2>



<p>While RabbitMQ and Kafka are sometimes interchangeable, their implementations are very different from each other. As a result, we cannot view them as members of the same category of tools; one is a message broker, and the other is a distributed streaming platform. As solution architects, we should acknowledge these differences and actively consider which of these types of solutions we should use for a given scenario. <a href="https://eranstiller.com/rabbitmq-vs-kafka-an-architects-dilemma-part-2">Part 2</a> addresses these differences and provides guidance on when to use each.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h3>The Optimistic Case for FUSE</h3><p>I love files. Everything understands files. Every program knows how to read files and write files. Its a truly universal API. As such, I love the idea of FUSE. FUSE, or “Filesystem in Userspace” is a set of Linux interfaces that allow user-mode programs to define a filesystem.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6474aea6101c81b742144dd2/6503bb5f57ddf9f32163597d_first.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>This allows filesystem drivers to be built very easily <strong>without needing a kernel module.</strong> Fuse is the basis for a large number of filesystem clients, including NTFS and even remote “filesystems” like SFTP or Amazon S3. It can also be used to make strange filesystems which are not actually filesystems like <a href="https://about.xethub.com/a5ab0a3b55724d45b3e91d1d890b9a8b?pvs=25"><strong>WikipediaFS</strong></a> which allows one to edit wikipedia articles using their own text editor.</p><p>Here at XetHub, we wanted to build an easy way to access any version of any dataset from your laptop using the tools you have. It is <em>really</em> nice being able to directly browse an image dataset without having to go through S3 commands.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6474aea6101c81b742144dd2/6503bb6a47462c93017f9ec1_second.gif" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption><em>What if you could interact with S3 this way?</em></figcaption></figure><p>The obvious solution to enabling this superpower was FUSE.</p><p>FUSE however, is an frustrating API to build against:</p><ul role="list"><li>there are 2 API classes to choose from — a low-level API and a high-level API</li><li>there are 2 incompatible API versions (libfuse2 and libfuse3)</li><li>and lots of other smaller API changes over time (See FUSE_USE_VERSION).</li></ul><p>In addition, FUSE is <strong>unavailable natively on Mac and Windows</strong> and requires the user to install a 3rd party driver (<a href="https://osxfuse.github.io/">MacFuse</a>, <a href="https://github.com/billziss-gh/winfuse">WinFuse</a>). Each of these drivers may have subtle API incompatibilities.</p><h3>The Key Question</h3><p>Because of these issues, I asked myself the following questions.</p><blockquote>Is it possible to build a userspace filesystem interface that is truly cross-platform?</blockquote><p>To answer this question, I had to look back 20 years into computer science history to stumble into <strong>NFSv3.</strong></p><h3>NFS</h3><p>NFSv3 is 20 years old and is a network filesystem protocol that was so simple and so ubiquitous that nearly every operating system has a built-in implementation of it.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6474aea6101c81b742144dd2/6503bb7357ddf9f321636887_third.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption><em>From Wikipedia</em></figcaption></figure><p>The NFSv3 protocol is has a beautiful and simple set of design principles:</p><ol role="list"><li><strong>The server is completely stateless</strong>: This simplifies the implementation immensely.</li><li><strong>NFS Servers are dumb and NFS clients are smart</strong>: &nbsp;(explicitly stated in <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1813#section-1.6">RFC 1813 &nbsp;Section 1.6 Par 4</a>). This is great because we only need to implement the server, and the very smart clients have already been implemented and hardened for &gt; 20 years.</li><li><strong>Simple Cache Consistency Rules</strong>: Server does not define cache policy. The client can be as smart as it wants. Instead, the protocol defines a mechanism for the server to notify the client when something changes. This implementation is simpler and more efficient than FUSE. In practice the FUSE daemon has to explicitly implement a lot caching itself. With NFS we can avoid all of that extra complexity.</li><li><strong>The NFS client knows its talking over a network</strong>: This means that the NFS Client and protocol has builtin timeout, retry and failure semantics we can immediately take advantage of. The stateless protocol makes this very easy. With FUSE, the timeout/failure behavior has to be implemented robustly everywhere in the daemon. It is remarkably easy to hang the daemon and all programs reading from the filesystem if you get stuck in an API call.</li><li><strong>Actually extremely good performance.</strong> On the nixes at least, localhost networking is as fast as pipes. I do not know about Windows but I will be surprised if its not very fast too.</li></ol><p>The summary is that implementing a user-mode filesystem using localhost NFS instead of FUSE makes it easier get performance and resiliency. We can take advantage of the existing caching support and 20+ years of robustness and hardening. We just need to implement the server protocol <em>once</em>.</p><p>So last year, while isolating myself from a COVID-19 infection, I implemented an NFSv3 server in Rust as an experiment. It turned out fantastically.</p><p>‍</p><h3>How we use NFS at XetHub</h3><p>XetHub has the world’s first <strong>natively cross-platform, user-mode filesystem implementation,</strong> allowing you to mount arbitrarily large datasets on your machine without needing any kernel driver.</p><p>This enables you to, in just a few seconds, locally <a href="https://about.xethub.com/blog/comparing-code-llama-models-locally-macbook">mount ~660 GB of Llama 2 models</a> or write DuckDB queries to <a href="https://about.xethub.com/blog/version-control-machine-learning-workflow-pyxet-part-1">analyze large parquet files</a> and scan just the data you need.</p><p>All of this is currently supported on Linux, Mac and Windows Pro (unfortunately doesn’t work with Windows Home).

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/82493/we-are-retroactively-dropping-the-iphones-repairability-score-en">https://www.ifixit.com/News/82493/we-are-retroactively-dropping-the-iphones-repairability-score-en</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37573332">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
<p>We need to have a serious chat about iPhone repairability. We judged the phones of yesteryear by how easy they were to take apart—screws, glues, how hard it was to change a battery. But repairs have gotten trickier, by design. Software now limits many basic iPhone repairs. That’s why we’ve revised the repairability score for the <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Device/iPhone_14">iPhone 14</a> from a <em>recommend </em>7 out of 10 to a <em>do-not-recommend</em> 4.</p>



<p>Although we <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/64865/iphone-14-teardown">enthusiastically</a> awarded it a solid score at launch last year, thanks to its innovative repair-friendly architecture—of which we remain big fans—the reality for folks trying to fix these things has been very different. Most major repairs on modern iPhones require Apple approval. You have to buy parts through their system, then have the repair validated via a chat system. Otherwise, you’ll run into limited or missing functionality, with a side of annoying warnings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lots of independent repair shops have business models that are threatened by Apple’s <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/69320/how-parts-pairing-kills-independent-repair">parts pairing</a> practice. Shops harvest parts from broken devices. They use third-party parts. They shouldn’t have to send Apple their customers’ personal information, or agree to <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/qjdjnv/apples-independent-repair-program-is-invasive-to-shops-and-their-customers-contract-shows">five years of audits</a> just to do the repairs they know how to do.</p>



<p>So when we gave the iPhone 14 a high score, the community <a href="https://youtu.be/K2WhU77ihw8?si=TEeGyQscV2wHr3xQ&amp;t=887">pushed back</a>. To be honest, they were right—and we’d like to thank our critics for helping us hold manufacturers accountable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The situation has gotten so bad that several repair professionals have told us they’re leaving the business entirely rather than navigate the labyrinthine maze of obstacles that Apple has erected.</p>



<p>So we’ve gone back to the drawing board with our scoring system to make sure that it reflects this significant new software limitation on repairs. And now that we’ve run the iPhone 14 through our new scorecard, the picture isn’t as rosy. The iPhone 14’s new 4 / 10 score reflects the fact that individuals and independent repair shops encounter some atrocious limitations when trying to fix it.</p>



<h2><strong>It’s Literally Not Re-Pairable</strong></h2>



<p>For many years, iFixit scores were primarily about <em>design for repair</em>—that is, how easy (or difficult) it is to disassemble your gadget, replace whatever’s broken, and reassemble it successfully. The highest scores were <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/55818/fairphone-4-teardown-if-only-apple-made-phones-like-this">reserved</a> for devices whose manufacturers even provided instructions for how to do that.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="592" height="444" src="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2023/09/18221601/lightning.jpg" alt=""></figure></div>



<p>Ever the innovators, Apple introduced a new dimension to repair that our scorecard simply didn’t account for: namely, that you could take a highly repairable design like the iPhone 14, install a <em>genuine</em> Apple replacement screen or battery, and then… it fails to work. Following the correct procedure was no longer enough.</p>



<p>Today, you need one more thing: a software handshake, using Apple’s System Configuration tool. It contacts Apple’s servers to “authenticate” the repair, then “pairs” the new part to your system so it works as expected. Of course, it can only authenticate if Apple knows about your repair in advance, because you gave them the exact serial number of your iPhone, and they’ve pre-matched it to a display or battery. This is only possible if you buy the screen or battery directly from Apple. Forget harvesting parts—which is a huge part of most independent repair and recycling businesses. It’s also impossible to pair any aftermarket parts—which means only Apple-authorized repairs can truly restore the device to full functionality.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="932" height="648" src="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2023/09/18221611/messages.jpg" alt=""><figcaption><em>Apple’s numerous ‘genuine’ parts warnings appear for all parts, even brand new OEM parts, that have not been blessed by Apple’s authentication process.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>While it’s an improvement over the status quo of just a few years ago, when Apple wouldn’t sell parts or supply instructions or software tools to <em>anyone</em> outside the Genius Bar and a few select “authorized” repair outlets, it’s still a major problem. Apple has made some real progress here—and we’ve been reluctant to criticize manufacturers taking meaningful steps. There are good people inside Apple working hard to make this situation better.</p>



<p>But parts pairing is a serious threat to our ability to fix the things we own. The problem is the invasive amount of control that Apple exerts over this entire process, and the fee they require you to pay for the privilege of fixing your own stuff. Apple likes to control the user experience so they can make it flawless—and we get that—but that experience should never come at the expense of our ownership rights or the planet. Already got a genuine screen or battery handy? Too bad—you’ll have to buy a new one from Apple if you want full functionality. And what happens in a few years when Apple stops officially supporting repairs for your device and shuts off the authentication servers? Apple’s message is loud and clear: user repair isn’t a priority.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our reporting, and this revised scoring system, is the result of painstaking analysis. Our team has purchased several units of each phone generation and model and performed hundreds of <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/66879/iphone-14-parts-pairing-results-apple-is-still-trying-to-monopolise-repair">tests swapping individual parts</a>. The parts pairing problems we’ve reported on have been backed up by field reports from independent repair shops and YouTube repairers like Hugh Jeffreys and Louis Rossmann.</p>



<h2><strong>How Did We Get Here?</strong></h2>



<p>In a move that will not surprise close observers of Apple, they have developed the system without notifying the people who do the actual repair work that it impacts.</p>



<p>The shifting, secretive target has made it difficult to incorporate into our repairability scoring system. The first paired part we encountered was the <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/iPhone+5s+Teardown/17383#s52330">iPhone 5s</a> biometric fingerprint sensor. Seemingly, this was a necessity for security—so while our forums <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Answers/View/482732/Getting+around+TouchID+pairing">filled up</a> with users whose repairs were stymied, we didn’t modify our score.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Then a curious thing happened: <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/iPhone+XS+Screen+Replacement/113862">True Tone started disappearing</a> after screen repairs, even with genuine screens. Then some aftermarket screens <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/59jwvz/iphone-8-aftermarket-touchscreens-ios-update">stopped working</a>. <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/9917/11-3-update-breaking-iphone-screens">Some of these bugs</a> were fixed, some were not.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Following the <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/11208/batterygate-timeline">fury of Batterygate</a>, when the world learned that Apple was slowing down phones with older batteries, the company doubled down and <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/32343/apple-is-locking-batteries-to-iphones-now">started locking batteries</a> to the logic board via an iOS update. The update hid battery health from the owner of the device with third party batteries, removing a critical lifespan management feature.</p>



<p>Around the same time, the iPhone X introduced Face ID, a revolutionary technology with an unfortunately paired dot projector. As with the biometric sensor, we assumed this was a security issue and, while we didn’t like it, we justified Apple’s behavior because moving to new technology often comes with compromises. So we reluctantly made a carveout in our scoring system for security—but this just as quickly became a slippery slope.</p>



<p>Sometimes parts just didn’t work. But just as often, parts swaps prompted pop-ups. Warnings, warnings, and more warnings. Apple started pushing warnings when repairs were performed—and they were <em>pesky.&nbsp;</em></p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1783" height="850" src="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2023/09/18223502/image-4.png" alt="iPhone battery warnings" srcset="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2023/09/18223502/image-4.png 1783w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2023/09/18223502/image-4-1536x732.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1783px) 100vw, 1783px"></figure>



<p>iPhone 12 came with a camera fail, warnings, and the resultant disappointment to the repair community. iPhone 13 came with a sensibly redesigned display to make Face ID less of an issue with repairs—except that it <em>disabled Face ID completely </em>when replaced<em>. </em>The emotional yo-yo (<a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/56386/ios-15-2-fixes-iphone-13s-face-id-repair-trap-and-improves-its-repair-score">and repairability score yo-yo</a>) left us reeling. Steps forward, steps back. All the while, though, the steady drumbeat of parts pairing got louder. What initially started as isolated security quirks and bugs ended up being the first canaries in a dark coal mine of pairing strategies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One by one, the glitches and bugs add up to a broad strategy, a systematic plan to require Apple’s permission to perform any repair on the iPhone.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><a href="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2023/09/18222059/image.jpg"><img loading="lazy" width="3238" height="745" src="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2023/09/18222059/image.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2023/09/18222059/image.jpg 3238w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2023/09/18222059/image-1536x353.jpg 1536w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2023/09/18222059/image-2048x471.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 3238px) 100vw, 3238px"></a></figure>



<h2><strong>The iPhone 14 is Still a Mechanical Design Triumph</strong></h2>



<p>We maintain our high praise for the iPhone 14’s hardware architecture, which really does move the needle on repairability. Rear glass repairs that cost as much as $549 on the previous architecture now costs just $169 with the new mid-frame design.</p>



<p>Discussing repairability <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/ZiP1l7jlIIA?si=HPONgHjuCmE0-q65&amp;t=3526">for the first time</a> in the iPhone 15 announcement, Apple said they were expanding this new architecture to all 15 models. (On the iPhone 14, only the base, non-Pro models featured the improved design.)</p>



<p>Bravo! This design is truly an improvement worthy of the marketing effort. This is a very good hardware design, and we hope other OEMs will take notice and learn from it.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, this laudable mechanical improvement is undermined by a raft of software obstacles.</p>



<h2><strong>Apple Has Not Responded to Feedback</strong></h2>



<p>This parts pairing problem is by <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/reports/nixing-fix-ftc-report-congress-repair-restrictions/nixing_the_fix_report_final_5521_630pm-508_002.pdf">no means isolated</a> to iPhones. <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/71442/tearing-down-the-14-macbook-pro-with-apples-help">MacBooks</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/07/apple-pencils-cant-draw-straight-on-third-party-replacement-ipad-screens/">iPads</a> are suffering a similar fate, with screens, buttons, and other important components slowly sliding further into the realm of “only repairable by Apple—or with tough compromises.”</p>



<p>Even though we and <a href="https://repair.eu/news/we-need-the-right-to-repair-to-be-universal/">other repair advocates</a> have been sounding the alarm on parts pairing for years, Apple’s response has been lacking—especially for an industry leader and trend-setter with resources to act responsibly—and the problem continues to worsen. There may be multiple reasons for that, not all of them nefarious:</p>



<ul><li>Benign neglect</li><li>Precision parts calibration</li><li>Combating warranty fraud</li><li>Lack of testing software updates with aftermarket parts</li><li>Control over the customer experience</li></ul>



<p>Our intel says that it’s likely a combination of all of the above. Regardless: Apple has the resources to solve these problems. Based on how Apple designs their products and the relentless, unparallelled focus on user experience, they could easily be a leader in creating the best self-repair experience in tech. Yet, we don’t see that. Year after year, our scrappy repair community shouldn’t have to keep innovating around the shortcomings of the world’s most valuable company.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Apple needs to do better. And frankly, so do we—so as of today, our repairability scores do a better job of reflecting reality.</p>



<h2><strong>A New Score</strong></h2>



<p>The new <strong>4 / 10</strong> score lands just on the negative side of our scorecard, and garners a reluctant but clear <em>not recommended</em>. Our new scorecard covers a wide gamut of approaches that Apple has taught us about, and includes penalties for almost-repairs, non-repairs, and “genuineness” warnings. Taken together, these deductions erode the overall score of the device significantly. (Updating the scorecard took us many months of careful work—if you’re curious about how we score, <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/75533/how-ifixit-scores-repairability">check out this explainer</a>.) This scorecard will be the standard for all products moving forward—as Apple isn’t the only company utilizing parts pairing and other digital locks to handcuff DIY repairs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This repairability score doesn’t just represent our recommendations. It encapsulates countless wasted money, time, and tears of frustration on the part of Apple customers, repair techs, and would-be repairers. It represents a rising tide of e-waste that threatens the well-being of our society and our planet.</p>



<p>You can help, by preferring repairable products wherever possible. Product designers are paying attention. If enough consumers demand repairable products, then companies will create longer lasting products.</p>



<p>One note: for now, we are only rescoring the iPhone 14. We are not retroactively rescoring <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/repairability/smartphone-scores">earlier iPhones</a> at this time. If we did, their scores would also likely decline.</p>



<p>Apple could fix this problem with a software update, and that 7 / 10 score could return overnight. Even though they recently signaled their <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/79902/apples-u-turn-tech-giant-finally-backs-repair-in-california">support for Right to Repair in California</a>, these problems show that they are not taking the situation seriously enough.</p>



<p>We’re going to keep working to hold Apple and other manufacturers accountable the best way we know: By speaking the truth about <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/reports/nixing-fix-ftc-report-congress-repair-restrictions/nixing_the_fix_report_final_5521_630pm-508_002.pdf">repair restrictions</a> as loudly as we can, by revising our scorecard to reflect any new obstacles to repair, and by pushing for Right to Repair laws that ban parts pairing.</p>



<p>Long-lasting, repairable products are essential for the future of the planet. Sustainable electronics stand the test of time, and parts pairing undermines the ecosystem needed to keep these devices alive.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Right to repair is gaining momentum. We’re not giving up the fight for independent repair—and <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Right-to-Repair">neither should you</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>MGM Resorts International could be losing between $4.2 million and $8.4 million in daily revenue and around $1 million in cash flow every day it’s under a cyberattack, a gaming industry analyst said in a Sunday report to investors.</p>
<p>David Katz, an equity analyst with New York-based Jefferies Group, in a weekly report on gaming, lodging and leisure companies, updated his Thursday assessments of MGM and Caesars Entertainment Inc. that included an estimate that MGM could take a 10 percent to 20 percent hit on revenue and cash flow “for the days that the current conditions exist.”</p>
<p>MGM on Sunday entered its second week of operations after a cybersecurity breach. Jefferies analysts say MGM generates about $42 million in revenue and $8 million in cash flow daily companywide.</p>
<p>Revenue is the amount of money generated through sales and investments, while cash flow measures net cash and cash equivalents being transferred in and out of a company.</p>
<p>MGM officials on Sunday said there were no updates on the status of the company’s computer systems and no new information was posted on the company’s “frequently asked questions” internet page that launched early Friday.</p>
<p>But there was no shortage of complaints from people about the situation.</p>
<p>There were scattered emailed reports from people around the country to the Review-Journal saying they were MGM employees who hadn’t been paid as of Friday. The company said Friday that payroll had been met as planned.</p>
<p>Others complained that there were no useful functions on the restored websites. Customers can still make reservations by calling a property directly or by using third-party booking apps.</p>
<p>A Review-Journal reporter dining at Babette’s Steakhouse at Park MGM said a waiter indicated the restaurant’s computer system was continually slowing because checks can’t be closed out. In addition, all food has to be ordered at one time because expense tabs can’t be reopened. There’s also no splitting checks within a party and no splitting of payment methods.</p>
<p>Slot machine winnings on machines in operation had to be paid manually by employees because some ticket in-ticket out systems weren’t functioning.</p>
<p>Uber and Lyft drivers contacted by the Review-Journal said MGM’s problems were a constant topic of frustration with their riders. Some said they waited a long time for employees to pay their slot-machine winnings.</p>
<p>Groceryshop 2023, a three-day, technology-meets-supermarket-brands convention with a projected attendance of 5,000, is scheduled to begin Tuesday. Representatives of Groceryshop 2023 did not respond to emails inquiring about the status of the show and whether they expected attendance to be affected by the cybersecurity problems experienced by MGM.</p>
<p>Brands like Kroger, Walmart, Albertson’s, Costco, Amazon, Kellogg, General Mills, Doordash, KraftHeinz, Coca-Cola and Pepsico are expected to be represented at the show.</p>
<p>Katz told investors in his Thursday and Sunday reports that damages from the cyberattack at MGM would be claimed against insurance, but it’s unclear just how much would be covered.</p>
<p>“The announcement by CZR (Caesars Entertainment, which reported a similar cyberattack in an SEC filing Thursday) and indications from MGM confirming the cyberattacks should be taken as one-time, largely insurable events that should not have long-lasting impacts on the businesses, assuming that the event is short-lived,” Katz wrote. “Our sense is that MGM’s impact could potentially be material but moderate near term, while CZR should see no meaningful impact and the question of whether any business is displaced among operators near term is fair.”</p>
<p>Katz said there were unconfirmed reports that Caesars paid around $15 million in ransom money to extortionists to regain control of its computerized systems in late August. But it’s unclear if MGM has considered paying any ransom money.</p>
<p>“Our impression is the Street’s presumption that CZR elected to pay a ransom while MGM did not may not be correct, according to our discussions with both management teams,” Katz wrote. “Nonetheless, given what we expect should be predominantly insurable events for all concerned should mitigate the impact to MGM if it turns out to be significant.</p>
<p>For the time being, it is not clear what the magnitude of the impact is to MGM and the degree of insurance coverage it will have or the duration of the event.”</p>
<p>Katz said he believes MGM will continue operations.</p>
<p>“Our impression of the impact to MGM is that business remains operable and credit card use is possible, albeit manual, while more transactions are cash-based than usual,” he said.</p>

</figure><p>How many clinical-trial studies in medical journals are fake or fatally flawed? In October 2020, John Carlisle reported a startling estimate<sup><a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">1</a></sup>.</p><p>Carlisle, an anaesthetist who works for England’s National Health Service, is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230718112821/https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02241-z" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02241-z" data-track-category="body text link">renowned for his ability to spot dodgy data in medical trials</a>. He is also an editor at the journal <i>Anaesthesia</i>, and in 2017, he decided to scour all the manuscripts he handled that reported a randomized controlled trial (RCT) — the gold standard of medical research. Over three years, he scrutinized more than 500 studies<sup><a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">1</a></sup>.</p><p>For more than 150 trials, Carlisle got access to anonymized individual participant data (IPD). By studying the IPD spreadsheets, he judged that 44% of these trials contained at least some flawed data: impossible statistics, incorrect calculations or duplicated numbers or figures, for instance. And in 26% of the papers had problems that were so widespread that the trial was impossible to trust, he judged — either because the authors were incompetent, or because they had faked the data.</p><p>Carlisle called these ‘zombie’ trials because they had the semblance of real research, but closer scrutiny showed they were actually hollow shells, masquerading as reliable information. Even he was surprised by their prevalence. “I anticipated maybe one in ten,” he says.</p><p>When Carlisle couldn’t access a trial’s raw data, however, he could study only the aggregated information in the summary tables. Just 1% of these cases were zombies, and 2% had flawed data, he judged (see ‘The prevalence of ‘zombie’ trials’). This finding alarmed him, too: it suggested that, without access to the IPD — which journal editors usually don’t request and reviewers don’t see — even an experienced sleuth cannot spot hidden flaws.</p><figure>

</figure><p>“I think journals should assume that all submitted papers are potentially flawed and editors should review individual patient data before publishing randomised controlled trials,” Carlisle wrote in his report.</p><p>Carlisle rejected every zombie trial, but by now, almost three years later, most have been published in other journals — sometimes with different data to those submitted with the manuscript he had seen. He is writing to journal editors to alert them, but expects that little will be done.</p><p>Do Carlisle’s findings in anaesthesiology extend to other fields? For years, a number of scientists, physicians and data sleuths have argued that fake or unreliable trials are frighteningly widespread. They’ve scoured RCTs in various medical fields, such as women’s health, pain research, anaesthesiology, bone health and COVID-19, and have found dozens or hundreds of trials with seemingly statistically impossible data. Some, on the basis of their personal experiences, say that one-quarter of trials being untrustworthy might be an underestimate. “If you search for all randomized trials on a topic, about a third of the trials will be fabricated,” asserts Ian Roberts, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine.</p><p>The issue is, in part, a subset of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230718112821/https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00733-5" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00733-5" data-track-category="body text link">notorious paper-mill problem</a>: over the past decade, journals in many fields have published tens of thousands of suspected fake papers, some of which are thought to have been produced by third-party firms, termed paper mills.</p><p>But faked or unreliable RCTs are a particularly dangerous threat. They not only are about medical interventions, but also can be laundered into respectability by being included in meta-analyses and systematic reviews, which thoroughly comb the literature to assess evidence for clinical treatments. Medical guidelines often cite such assessments, and physicians look to them when deciding how to treat patients.</p><p>Ben Mol, who specializes in obstetrics and gynaecology at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, argues that as many as 20–30% of the RCTs included in systematic reviews in women’s health are suspect.</p><p>Many research-integrity specialists say that the problem exists, but its extent and impact are unclear. Some doubt whether the issue is as bad as the most alarming examples suggest. “We have to recognize that, in the field of high-quality evidence, we increasingly have a lot of noise. There are some good people championing that and producing really scary statistics. But there are also a lot in the academic community who think this is scaremongering,” says Žarko Alfirević, a specialist in fetal and maternal medicine at the University of Liverpool, UK.</p><p>This year, he and others are conducting more studies to assess how bad the problem is. Initial results from a study led by Alfirević are not encouraging.</p><h2><b>Laundering fake trials</b></h2><p>Medical research has always had fraudsters. Roberts, for instance, first came across the issue when he co-authored a 2005 systematic review for the Cochrane Collaboration, a prestigious group whose reviews of medical research evidence are often used to shape clinical practice. The review suggested that high doses of a sugary solution could reduce death after head injury. But Roberts retracted it<sup><a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">2</a></sup> after doubts arose about three of the key trials cited in the paper, all authored by the same Brazilian neurosurgeon, Julio Cruz. (Roberts never discovered whether the trials were fake, because Cruz died by suicide before investigations began. Cruz’s articles have not been retracted.)</p><p>A more recent example is that of Yoshihiro Sato, a Japanese bone-health researcher. Sato, who died in 2016, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230718112821/https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-01884-2" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-01884-2" data-track-category="body text link">fabricated data in dozens of trials of drugs or supplements that might prevent bone fracture</a>. He has 113 retracted papers, according to a list compiled by the website <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230718112821/https://retractionwatch.com/" data-track="click" data-label="https://retractionwatch.com/" data-track-category="body text link">Retraction Watch</a>. His work has had a wide impact: researchers found that 27 of Sato’s retracted RCTs had been cited by 88 systematic reviews and clinical guidelines, some of which had informed Japan’s recommended treatments for osteoporosis<sup><a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">3</a></sup>.</p><p>Some of the findings in about half of these reviews would have changed had Sato’s trials been excluded, says Alison Avenell, a medical researcher at the University of Aberdeen, UK. She, along with medical researchers Andrew Grey, Mark Bolland and Greg Gamble, all at the University of Auckland in New Zealand, have pushed universities to investigate Sato’s work and monitored its influence. “It probably diverted people from being given more effective treatment for fracture prevention,” Avenell says.</p><figure>

</figure><p>The concerns over zombie trials, however, are beyond individual fakers flying under the radar. In some fields, swathes of RCTs from different research groups might be unreliable, researchers worry.</p><p>During the pandemic, for instance, a flurry of RCTs was conducted into whether ivermectin, an anti-parasite drug, could treat COVID-19. But researchers who were not involved have since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230718112821/https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01535-y" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01535-y" data-track-category="body text link">pointed out data flaws</a> in many of the studies, some of which have been retracted. A 2022 update of a Cochrane review argued that more than 40% of these RCTs were untrustworthy<sup><a href="#ref-CR4" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">4</a></sup>.</p><p>“Untrustworthy work must be removed from systematic reviews,” says Stephanie Weibel, a biologist at the University of Wuerzberg in Germany, who co-authored the review.</p><p>In maternal health — another field seemingly rife with problems — Roberts and Mol have flagged studies into whether a drug called tranexamic acid can stem dangerously heavy bleeding after childbirth. Every year, around 14 million people experience this condition, and some 70,000 die: it is the world’s leading cause of maternal death.</p><p>In 2016, Roberts reviewed evidence for using tranexamic acid to treat serious blood loss after childbirth. He reported that many of the 26 RCTs investigating the drug had serious flaws. Some had identical text, others had data inconsistencies or no records of ethical approval. Some seemed not to have adequately randomized the assignment of their participants to control and treatment groups<sup><a href="#ref-CR5" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">5</a></sup>.</p><p>When he followed up with individual authors to ask for more details and raw data, he generally got no response or was told that records were missing or had been lost because of computer theft. Fortunately, in 2017, a large, high-quality multi-centre trial, which Roberts helped to run, established that the drug was effective<sup><a href="#ref-CR6" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">6</a></sup>. It’s likely, says Roberts, that in these and other such cases, some of the dubious trials were copycat fraud — researchers saw that a large trial was going on and produced small, substandard copies that no one would question. This kind of fraud isn’t a victimless crime, however. “It results in narrowed confidence intervals such that the results look much more certain than they are. It also has the potential to amplify a wrong result, suggesting that treatments work when they don’t,” he says.</p><article data-label="Related">

 </article><p>That might have happened for another question: what if doctors were to inject the drug into everyone undergoing a caesarean, just after they give birth, as a preventative measure? A 2021 review<sup><a href="#ref-CR7" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">7</a></sup> of 36 RCTs investigating this idea, involving a total of more than 10,000 participants, concluded that this would reduce the risk of heavy blood loss by 60%.</p><p>Yet this April, an enormous US-led RCT with 11,000 people reported only a slight and not statistically significant benefit<sup><a href="#ref-CR8" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">8</a></sup>.</p><p>Mol thinks problems with some of the 36 previous RCTs explains the discrepancy. The 2021 meta-analysis had included one multi-centre study in France of more than 4,000 participants, which found a modest 16% reduction in severe blood loss, and another 35 smaller, single-centre studies, mostly conducted in India, Iran, Egypt and China, which collectively estimated a 93% drop. Many of the smaller RCTs were untrustworthy, says Mol, who has dug into some of them in detail.</p><p>It’s unclear whether the untrustworthy studies affected clinical practice. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends using tranexamic acid to treat blood loss after childbirth, but it doesn’t have a guideline on preventive administration.</p><h2><b>From four trials to one</b></h2><p>Mol points to a different example in which untrustworthy trials might have influenced clinical practice. In 2018, researchers published a Cochrane review<sup><a href="#ref-CR9" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">9</a></sup> on whether giving steroids to people due to undergo caesarean-section births helped to reduce breathing problems in their babies. Steroids are good for a baby’s lungs but can harm the developing brain, says Mol; benefits generally outweigh harms when babies are born prematurely, but the balance is less clear when steroids are used later in pregnancy.</p><p>The authors of the 2018 review, led by Alexandros Sotiriadis, a specialist in maternal–fetal medicine at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki in Greece, analysed the evidence for administering steroids to people delivering by caesarean later in pregnancy. They ended up with four RCTs: a British study from 2005 with more than 940 participants, and three Egyptian trials conducted between 2015 and 2018 that added another 3,000 people into the evidence base. The review concluded that the steroids “may” reduce rates of breathing problems; it was cited in more than 200 documents and some clinical guidelines.</p><p>In January 2021, however, Mol and others, who had looked in more depth into the papers, raised concerns about the Egyptian trials. The largest study, with nearly 1,300 participants, was based on the second author’s thesis, he noted — but the trial end dates in the thesis differed from the paper. And the reported ratio of male to female babies was an impossible 40% to 60%. Mol queried the other papers, too, and wrote to the authors, but says he did not get satisfactory replies. (One author told him he’d lost the data when moving house.) Mol’s team also reported statistical issues with some other works by the same authors.</p><article data-label="Related">

 </article><p>In December 2021, Sotiriadis’s team updated its review<sup><a href="#ref-CR10" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">10</a></sup>. But this time, it adopted a new screening protocol. Until that year, Cochrane reviews had aimed to include all relevant RCTs; if researchers spotted potential issues with a trial, using a ‘risk of bias’ checklist, they would downgrade their confidence in its findings, but not remove it from their analysis. But in 2021, Cochrane’s research-integrity team introduced new guidance: authors should try to identify ‘problematic’ or ‘untrustworthy’ trials and exclude them from reviews. Sotiriadis’s group now excluded all but the British research. With only one trial left, there was “insufficient data” to draw firm conclusions about the steroids, the researchers said.</p><p>By last May, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230718112821/https://retractionwatch.com/2022/05/08/journal-retracts-c-section-paper-with-impossible-data" data-track="click" data-label="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/05/08/journal-retracts-c-section-paper-with-impossible-data" data-track-category="body text link">as Retraction Watch reported</a>, the large Egyptian trial was retracted (to the disagreement of its authors). The journal’s editors wrote in the retraction notice that they had not received its data or a satisfactory response from the authors, adding that “if the data is unreliable, women and babies are being harmed”. The other two trials are still under investigation by publisher Taylor &amp; Francis as part of a larger case of papers, says Sabina Alam, director of publishing ethics at the firm. Before the 2018 review, some clinical guidelines had suggested that administering steroids later in pregnancy could be beneficial, and the practice had been growing in some countries, such as Australia, Mol has reported. The latest updated WHO and regional guidelines, however, recommend against this practice.</p><p>Overall, Mol and his colleagues have alleged problems in more than 800 published medical research papers, at least 500 of which are on RCTs. So far, the work has led to more than 80 retractions and 50 expressions of concern. Mol has focused much of his work on papers from countries in the Middle East, and particularly in Egypt. One researcher responded to some of his e-mails by accusing him of racism. Mol, however, says that it’s simply a fact that he has encountered many suspect statistics and refusals to share data from RCT authors in countries such as Iran, Egypt, Turkey and China — and that he should be able to point that out.</p><h2><b>Screening for trustworthiness</b></h2><p>“Ben Mol has undoubtedly been a pioneer in the field of detecting and fighting data falsification,” says Sotiriadis — but he adds that it is difficult to prove that a paper is falsified. Sotiriadis says he didn’t depend on Mol’s work when his team excluded those trials in its update, and he can’t say whether the trials were corrupt.</p><p>Instead, his group followed a screening protocol designed to check for ‘trustworthiness’. It had been developed by one of Cochrane’s independent specialist groups, the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth (CPC) group, coordinated by Alfirević. (This April, Cochrane formally dissolved this group and some others, as part of a reorganization strategy.) It provides a detailed list of criteria that authors should follow to check the trustworthiness of an RCT — such as whether a trial is prospectively registered and whether the study is free of unusual statistics, such as implausibly narrow or wide distributions of mean values in participant height, weight or other characteristics, and other red flags. If RCTs fail the checks, then reviewers are instructed to contact the original study authors — and, if the replies are not adequate, to exclude the study.</p><p>“We’re championing the idea that, if a study doesn’t pass these bars, then no hard feelings, but we don’t call it trustworthy enough,” Alfirević explains.</p><p>For Sotiriadis, the merit of this protocol was that it avoided his having to declare the trials faulty or fraudulent; they had merely failed a test of trustworthiness. His team ultimately reported that it excluded the Egyptian trials because they hadn’t been prospectively registered and the authors didn’t explain why.</p><p>Other Cochrane authors are starting to adopt the same protocol. For instance, a review<sup><a href="#ref-CR11" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">11</a></sup> of drugs aiming to prevent pre-term labour, published last August, used it to exclude 44 studies — one-quarter of the 122 trials in the literature.</p><h2><b>What counts as trustworthy?</b></h2><p>Whether trustworthiness checks are sometimes unfair to the authors of RCTs, and exactly what should be checked to classify untrustworthy research, is still up for debate. In a 2021 editorial<sup><a href="#ref-CR12" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">12</a></sup> introducing the idea of trustworthiness screening, Lisa Bero, a senior research integrity editor at Cochrane, and a bioethicist at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora, pointed out that there was no validated, universally agreed method.</p><p>“Misclassification of a genuine study as problematic could result in erroneous review conclusions. Misclassification could also lead to reputational damage to authors, legal consequences, and ethical issues associated with participants having taken part in research, only for it to be discounted,” she and two other researchers wrote.</p><p>For now, there are multiple trustworthiness protocols in play. In 2020, for instance, Avenell and others <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230718112821/https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03959-6" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03959-6" data-track-category="body text link">published REAPPRAISED</a>, a checklist aimed more at journal editors. And when Weibel and others reviewed trials investigating ivermectin as a COVID-19 treatment last year, they created their own checklist, which they call a ‘research integrity assessment’.</p><p>Bero says some of these checks are more labour-intensive than editors and systematic reviewers are generally accustomed to. “We need to convince systematic reviewers that this is worth their time,” she says. She and others have consulted biomedical researchers, publishers and research-integrity experts to come up with a set of red flags that might serve as the basis for creating a widely agreed method of assessment.</p><p>Despite the concerns of researchers such as Mol, many scientists remain unsure how many reviews have been compromised by unreliable RCTs. This year, a team led by Jack Wilkinson, a health researcher at the University of Manchester, UK, is using the results of Bero’s consultation to apply a list of 76 trustworthiness checks to all trials cited in 50 published Cochrane reviews. (The 76 items include detailed examination of the data and statistics in trials, as well as inspecting details on funding, grants, trial registration, the plausibility of study methods and authors’ publication records — but, in this exercise, data from individual participants are not being requested.)</p><article data-label="Related">

 </article><p>The aim is to see how many RCTs fail the checks, and what impact removing those trials would have on the reviews’ conclusions. Wilkinson says a team of 50 is working on the project. He aims to produce a general trustworthiness-screening tool, as well as a separate tool to aid in inspecting participant data, if authors provide them. He will discuss the work in September at Cochrane’s annual colloquium.</p><p>Alfirević’s team, meanwhile, has found in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230718112821/https://events.cochrane.org/colloquium-2023/session/1473810/assessment-of-trustworthiness-has-a-significant-impact-on-conclusions-of-cochrane-reviews" data-track="click" data-label="https://events.cochrane.org/colloquium-2023/session/1473810/assessment-of-trustworthiness-has-a-significant-impact-on-conclusions-of-cochrane-reviews" data-track-category="body text link">a study yet to be published</a> that 25% of around 350 RCTs in 18 Cochrane reviews on nutrition and pregnancy would have failed trustworthiness checks, using the CPC’s method. With these RCTs excluded, the team found that one-third of the reviews would require updating because their findings would have changed. The researchers will report more details in September.</p><p>In Alfirević’s view, it doesn’t particularly matter which trustworthiness checks reviewers use, as long as they do something to scrutinize RCTs more closely. He warns that the numbers of systematic reviews and meta-analyses that journals publish have themselves been soaring in the past decade — and many of these reviews can’t be trusted because of shoddy screening methods. “An untrustworthy systematic review is far more dangerous than an untrustworthy primary study,” he says. “It is an industry that is completely out of hand, with little quality assurance.”</p><p>Roberts, who first published in 2015 his concerns over problematic medical research in systematic reviews<sup><a href="#ref-CR13" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">13</a></sup>, says that the Cochrane organization took six years to respond and still isn’t taking the issue seriously enough. “If up to 25% of trials included in systematic reviews are fraudulent, then the whole Cochrane endeavour is suspect. Much of what we think we know based on systematic reviews is wrong,” he says.</p><p>Bero says that Cochrane consulted widely to develop its 2021 guide on addressing problematic trials, including incorporating suggestions from Roberts, other Cochrane reviewers and research-integrity experts.</p><h2><b>Asking for data</b></h2><p>Many researchers worried by medical fakery agree with Carlisle that it would help if journals routinely asked authors to share their IPD. “Asking for raw data would be a good policy. The default position has just been to trust the study, but we’ve been operating from quite a naive position,” says Wilkinson. That advice, however, runs counter to current practice at most medical journals.</p><p>In 2016, the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE), an influential body that sets policy for many major medical titles, had proposed requiring mandatory data-sharing from RCTs. But it got pushback — including over perceived risks to the privacy of trial participants who might not have consented to their data being shared, and the availability of resources for archiving the data. As a result, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230718112821/https://www.icmje.org/news-and-editorials/data_sharing_june_2017.pdf" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.icmje.org/news-and-editorials/data_sharing_june_2017.pdf" data-track-category="body text link">in the latest update to its guidance</a>, in 2017, it settled for merely encouraging data sharing and requiring statements about whether and where data would be shared.</p><article data-label="Related">

 </article><p>The ICMJE secretary, Christina Wee, says that “there are major feasibility challenges” to be resolved to mandate IPD sharing, although the committee might revisit its practices in future. Many publishers of medical journals told <i>Nature</i>’s news team that, following ICMJE advice, they didn’t require IPD from authors of trials. (These publishers included Springer Nature; <i>Nature</i>’s news team is editorially independent.)</p><p>Some journals, however — including Carlisle’s <i>Anaesthesia</i> — have gone further and do already require IPD. “Most authors provide the data when told it is a requirement,” Carlisle says.</p><p>Even when IPD are shared, says Wilkinson, scouring it in the way that Carlisle does is a time-consuming exercise — creating a further burden for reviewers — although computational checks of statistics might help.</p><p>Besides asking for data, journal editors could also speed up their decision-making, research-integrity specialists say. When sleuths raise concerns, editors should be prepared to put expressions of concern on medical studies more quickly if they don’t hear back from authors, Avenell says. This April, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230718112821/https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/39343/documents/194466/default" data-track="click" data-label="https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/39343/documents/194466/default" data-track-category="body text link">UK parliamentary report into reproducibility and research integrity</a> said that it should not take longer than two months for publishers to publish corrections or retractions of research when academics raise issues.</p><p>And if journals do retract studies, authors of systematic reviews should be required to correct their work, Avenell and others say. This rarely happens. Last year, for instance, Avenell’s team reported that it had carefully and repeatedly e-mailed authors and journal editors of the 88 reviews that cited Sato’s retracted trials to inform them that their reviews included retracted work. They got few responses — only 11 of the 88 reviews have been updated so far — suggesting that authors and editors didn’t generally care about correcting the reviews<sup><a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">3</a></sup>.</p><p>That was dispiriting but not surprising to the team, which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230718112821/https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-01884-2" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-01884-2" data-track-category="body text link">has previously recounted how institutional investigations into Sato’s work were opaque and inadequate</a>. The Cochrane collaboration, for its part, stated in updated guidance in 2021 that systematic reviews must be updated when retractions occur.</p><p>Ultimately, a lingering question is — as with paper mills — why so many suspect RCTs are being produced in the first place. Mol, from his experiences investigating the Egyptian studies, blames lack of oversight and superficial assessments that promote academics on the basis of their number of publications, as well as the lack of stringent checks from institutions and journals on bad practices. Egyptian authorities have taken some steps to improve governance of trials, however; Egypt’s parliament, for instance, published its first clinical research law in December 2020.</p><p>“The solution’s got to be fixes at the source,” says Carlisle. “When this stuff is churned out, it’s like fighting a wildfire and failing.”</p>

</p></div><p>‍</p><p>‍<strong>Hydra is an open-source extension that adds columnar tables to Postgres for efficient analytical reporting. With Hydra, you can analyze billions of rows instantly without changing code.</strong></p><p>Hydra augments Postgres’ existing row-based tables, enabling developers to tailor Postgres to their application’s custom transactional and analytical needs. Hydra combines a columnar format, vectorized execution, and parallelism to supercharge modern applications that aren’t wholly transactional or fully analytical, such as real-time dashboards, IOT, geospatial &amp; logistics apps, and time-series workloads.</p><h3>Tailor Postgres to your modern, real-time apps</h3><h5>👸 <strong>Columnar tables = OLAP</strong></h5><p>OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) is designed to support analytical workloads, such as data mining, reporting, and business intelligence. OLAP systems typically use a multidimensional data model, which allows users to analyze data from multiple perspectives and at different levels of detail. OLAP systems are often used in decision support applications, where users need to quickly and easily analyze large amounts of data.</p><h5>🤴 <strong>Row tables (heap) = OLTP</strong></h5><p>OLTP (Online Transactional Processing) is optimized for a large number of small, frequent transactions that insert, update, delete, and retrieve data from a database. This type of system manages real-time data processing for record lookups, fast writes, high concurrency, and useful for order entry, sales, financial applications, and more.</p><h5>👸🤝🤴 <strong>Row + Columnar tables = HTAP</strong></h5><p>HTAP (Hybrid Transactional Analytical Processing) combines the strengths of OLTP and OLAP into a single system. When transactions occur, they are instantly accessible for analytics and machine learning. HTAP is commonly used when reporting latency must be low, such as financial analysis, IOT alerting, fraud detection, supply chain management, customer-facing dashboards, and applications with real-time decision making.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/640edc15766e12e0d8f226dc/6508c75d0cea27729aea81ca_OLTP%2C%20HTAP%2C%20OLAP%20diagram%20(3).png" loading="lazy" alt="Graph showing OLTP. HTAP and OLAP"></p></figure><h3>Columnar tables 101</h3><p>Columnar tables are organized transversely from row tables. For example, take the following table stored in row format:</p><div>

<table>
    <tbody><tr>
        <td>Joe</td>
        <td>156789</td>
        <td>Blue</td>
        <td>Platinum</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Felisha</td>
        <td>119988</td>
        <td>Red</td>
        <td>Gold</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Sam</td>
        <td>232667</td>
        <td>Green</td>
        <td>Silver</td>
    </tr>
</tbody></table></div><p> 
    The order of the data would be: 
    <span>
        | Joe | 156789 | Blue | Platinum | Felisha | 119988 | Red | Gold | Sam | 232667 | Green | Silver |
    </span>
</p><p>The same data stored in columnar can be visualized as follows:</p><div>

    <tbody><tr>
        <td>Joe</td>
        <td>Felisha</td>
        <td>Sam</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>156789</td>
        <td>119988</td>
        <td>232667</td>

    <tr>
        <td>Platinum</td>
        <td>Gold</td>
        <td>Silver</td>
    </tr>

The following aggregate functions are vectorized:</p><ul role="list"><li>MIN</li><li>MAX</li><li>COUNT</li><li>SUM</li><li>AVG</li></ul><p>‍</p><p>Vectorization can result in aggregate queries being over <a href="https://bencher.dev/perf/hydra-postgres?benchmarks_page=2&amp;testbeds_page=1&amp;branches_page=1&amp;reports_page=1&amp;tab=benchmarks&amp;branches=e6bcbe0c-210d-4ab1-8fe4-5d9498800980&amp;testbeds=1d3283b3-3e52-4dd0-a018-fb90c9361a2e&amp;metric_kind=query-time&amp;reports_per_page=4&amp;branches_per_page=8&amp;testbeds_per_page=8&amp;benchmarks_per_page=8&amp;clear=true&amp;benchmarks=e5249f00-a108-4164-8c36-d39fed2bdfd2%2Cd488714b-81cd-4183-9856-334980ef16f3%2Cce4c8327-46d1-4bb3-95ca-be810fd818ee"><strong>60% faster</strong></a>. If vectorized aggregate is not found or execution plan is not suitable, Hydra falls back to standard Postgres execution.</p><p>
    Hydra uses automatic vectorization by the compiler for vectorization. We have enabled <span>-O3</span> optimizations in our compilation process to maximize this effect.
</p><p>This optimization is for Postgres 14+ only.</p><h4>Spatial index types and pg_hint_plan</h4><p>
    After testing, we have enabled gin, gist, spgist, and rum indexes on columnar tables, enabling indexes for geospatial queries. We have also added <span>pg_hint_plan</span> to enable you to experiment with the query plan to maximize performance. Recommendations for indexing and using pg_hint_plan are available in our documentation.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://signal.org/blog/pqxdh/">https://signal.org/blog/pqxdh/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37571919">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://signal.org/blog/images/pqxdh_header.png" alt="An abstract illustration of a Bloch Sphere"></p><p>The Signal Protocol is a set of cryptographic specifications that provides end-to-end encryption for private communications exchanged daily by billions of people around the world. After its publication in 2013, the Signal Protocol was adopted not only by Signal but well beyond. Technical information on the Signal Protocol can be found in the specifications section of our <a href="https://signal.org/docs/" title="Signal Technical Information">docs</a> site.</p><p>Today we are happy to announce the first step in advancing quantum resistance for the Signal Protocol: an upgrade to the <a href="https://signal.org/docs/specifications/x3dh/" title="The X3DH Key Agreement Protocol">X3DH</a> specification which we are calling <a href="https://signal.org/docs/specifications/pqxdh/" title="The PQXDH Key Agreement Protocol">PQXDH</a>. With this upgrade, we are adding a layer of protection against the threat of a quantum computer being built in the future that is powerful enough to break current encryption standards.</p><p>This post is written to introduce this work to non-experts, and will review what quantum computing is and the challenges it presents for current cryptographic algorithms, before providing a high level overview of how we are adapting our specifications to answer these challenges. If you would like to skip this summary and explore our PQXDH specification in depth, you can read our technical whitepaper <a href="https://signal.org/docs/specifications/pqxdh/" title="The PQXDH Key Agreement Protocol">here</a>.</p><h2 id="public-key-cryptography-primer">Public Key Cryptography Primer</h2><p>In order to explain why quantum computers pose a risk to existing cryptographic algorithms, it is first necessary to understand some of the broad strokes of how these algorithms work. The most logical place to start is with the <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)" title="The RSA Cryptosystem">RSA Cryptosystem</a>, because it provides an accessible example.</p><p>The RSA Cryptosystem is one element in a category of algorithms known as public key cryptosystems. Public key cryptosystems make it possible for someone to publish a public key that anyone can use to encrypt messages to that person. The person keeps a related private key which allows them to decrypt any message that has been encrypted with their published public key.</p><p>In order to make this work, RSA relies on a mathematical one-way function. A one-way function is easy to compute in one direction, but requires substantially more work to compute in reverse. The one-way function RSA relies upon is the multiplication and factorization of large prime numbers. It is computationally easy to multiply two large primes together to compute the product, but much more computationally intensive to find the original primes from their product.</p><p>The RSA cryptosystem works by first picking two large prime numbers at random and publishing the product of the two as one part of a public key. The selected prime numbers are kept private. This relies upon the difficulty of factoring this product to keep the two primes secret.</p><p>Although we have used RSA as an example to aid this primer, Signal does not use the RSA Cryptosystem in its protocols. Instead, Signal uses <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_cryptography" title="Elliptic Curve Cryptography">elliptic curve cryptography</a> as the public key cryptosystem supporting many of its specifications. Instead of prime <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_factorization" title="Integer Factorization">integer factorization</a>, as in the RSA example above, elliptic curve cryptography relies upon the <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_logarithm" title="Discrete Logarithm Problem">discrete logarithm problem</a> as its one-way function. While these two problems are distinct, they are both instances of a mathematical problem known as the <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_subgroup_problem" title="Hidden Subgroup Problem">hidden subgroup problem</a>.</p><h2 id="quantum-computing">Quantum Computing</h2><p>Quantum computing represents a new type of computational system which leverages quantum mechanical properties to solve certain complex problems many orders of magnitude more quickly than modern classical computers. Instead of bits as in a classical computer, quantum computers operate on qubits. Rather than 0 or 1, qubits can exist in a superposition of states, in some sense allowing them to be both values at once. One place where quantum computers appear to have a significant advantage over classical computers is solving instances of the <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_subgroup_problem" title="Hidden Subgroup Problem">hidden subgroup problem</a>.</p><p>Quantum computing is unlikely to replace or supplant classical computers for our day-to-day use for the foreseeable future because classical computers are often better at the typical use cases for our laptops, tablets, and phones. Quantum computing systems will likely be built to take alternate approaches to some of the problems we rely on supercomputers to tackle today, whether this is modeling protein folding, forecasting weather, or factoring large numbers. It’s important to understand that quantum computers are not “better” computers but rather different types of computers.</p><p>Although quantum computers already exist, the systems known to exist today do not yet have <a href="https://research.ibm.com/blog/factor-15-shors-algorithm" title="It's been 20 years since \&quot;15\&quot; was factored on quantum hardware">enough qubits</a> to pose a threat to the public-key cryptography that Signal currently uses. However, if a sufficiently powerful quantum computer were built in the future, it could be used to compute a private key from a public key thereby breaking encrypted messages. This kind of threat is known as <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvest_now,_decrypt_later" title="Harvest Now, Decrypt Later">Harvest Now, Decrypt Later (HNDL)</a>.</p><p>The timeline for when a sufficiently powerful quantum computer may be created is a matter of great debate. On the low end, some argue it is only a couple of years away. On the high end some say 30+ years, and there are even those who assert that we may never solve the challenges necessary to make a quantum computer with enough coherent qubits to break the current public key cryptosystems. The middle ground seems to be around the 5 to 10 year time horizon. We are not in a position to judge which timeline is most likely, but we do see a real and growing risk which means we need to take steps today to address the future possibility of a large enough quantum computer being created.</p><h2 id="securing-signal-against-a-future-quantum-computer">Securing Signal Against a Future Quantum Computer</h2><p>To address this problem, new post-quantum cryptosystems have been created to implement new one-way functions that cannot be advantageously reversed by a quantum computer. Thanks to innovation from cryptographic researchers and the <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography" title="NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography">NIST Standardization Process for Post-Quantum Cryptography</a> we now have stable options that have been created and vetted by a large community of experts.</p><p>Even with the contributions of a community of experts, building and evaluating these new cryptosystems remains a challenging endeavor. During NIST’s standardization process, one of the post-quantum algorithm candidates was found to be <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/news/269080-nist-post-quantum-cryptography-candidate-cracked/fulltext" title="NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Candidate Cracked">attackable</a> by a classical computer. While this shows that the scrutiny of the standardization process is working, it also suggests that one should integrate these new post-quantum options cautiously.</p><p>We believe that the key encapsulation mechanism we have selected, <a href="https://pq-crystals.org/kyber/" title="CRYSTALS-Kyber">CRYSTALS-Kyber</a>, is built on solid foundations, but to be safe we do not want to simply replace our existing <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_cryptography" title="Elliptic Curve Cryptography">elliptic curve cryptography</a> foundations with a post-quantum public key cryptosystem. Instead, we are augmenting our existing cryptosystems such that an attacker must break <em>both</em> systems in order to compute the keys protecting people’s communications.</p><p>The essence of our protocol upgrade from <a href="https://signal.org/docs/specifications/x3dh/" title="The X3DH Key Agreement Protocol">X3DH</a> to <a href="https://signal.org/docs/specifications/pqxdh/" title="The PQXDH Key Agreement Protocol">PQXDH</a> is to compute a shared secret, data known only to the parties involved in a private communication session, using both the elliptic curve key agreement protocol <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve25519" title="X25519">X25519</a> and the post-quantum key encapsulation mechanism <a href="https://pq-crystals.org/kyber/" title="CRYSTALS-Kyber">CRYSTALS-Kyber</a>. We then combine these two shared secrets together so that any attacker must break both X25519 and CRYSTALS-Kyber to compute the same shared secret.</p><p>Our new protocol is already supported in the latest versions of Signal’s client applications and is in use for chats initiated after both sides of the chat are using the latest Signal software. In the coming months (after sufficient time has passed for everyone using Signal to update), we will disable <a href="https://signal.org/docs/specifications/x3dh/" title="The X3DH Key Agreement Protocol">X3DH</a> for new chats and require <a href="https://signal.org/docs/specifications/pqxdh/" title="The PQXDH Key Agreement Protocol">PQXDH</a> for all new chats. In parallel, we will roll out software updates to upgrade existing chats to this new protocol.</p><h2 id="future-work">Future Work</h2><p><a href="https://signal.org/docs/specifications/pqxdh/" title="The PQXDH Key Agreement Protocol">PQXDH</a> protects messages exchanged on Signal against the threat of a future quantum computer. We will need to make further upgrades to address the threat of an attacker with a contemporaneous quantum computer. Further research in the area of post-quantum cryptography will be needed to fill in the remaining gaps. We recommend reading the security considerations section of our <a href="https://signal.org/docs/specifications/pqxdh/" title="The PQXDH Key Agreement Protocol">PQXDH whitepaper</a> for more information on the areas of open research.</p><h2 id="acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</h2><p>We want to extend our sincerest thanks and appreciation to all the people who contributed to the development of this protocol upgrade.

            <span>Abstract:</span>Predictions over graphs play a crucial role in various domains, including social networks, molecular biology, medicine, and more. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as the dominant approach for learning on graph data. Instances of graph labeling problems consist of the graph-structure (i.e., the adjacency matrix), along with node-specific feature vectors. In some cases, this graph-structure is non-informative for the predictive task. For instance, molecular properties such as molar mass depend solely on the constituent atoms (node features), and not on the molecular structure. While GNNs have the ability to ignore the graph-structure in such cases, it is not clear that they will. In this work, we show that GNNs actually tend to overfit the graph-structure in the sense that they use it even when a better solution can be obtained by ignoring it. We examine this phenomenon with respect to different graph distributions and find that regular graphs are more robust to this overfitting. We then provide a theoretical explanation for this phenomenon, via analyzing the implicit bias of gradient-descent-based learning of GNNs in this setting. Finally, based on our empirical and theoretical findings, we propose a graph-editing method to mitigate the tendency of GNNs to overfit graph-structures that should be ignored. We show that this method indeed improves the accuracy of GNNs across multiple benchmarks.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td><div><p>TLDR; Graphite enables a git workflow called “stacking” - the fastest way to develop and ship code, which many large tech companies have been using for years. Graphite makes stacking available to anyone with a GitHub account.</p><p>Hi HN!</p><p>I’m Tomas, co-founder of graphite.dev, and today we’re launching Graphite after almost two years of development in closed beta. [1] Graphite started as an internal solution to our own problem. When we (engineers from Meta, Google and Airbnb) left our previous roles, we lost access to the internal code review tools we loved. So we built our own.</p><p>https://graphite.dev</p><p>---</p><p>Graphite is how the fastest developers ship code - it’s a developer tool that allows you to create smaller pull requests, stay unblocked, and ship faster with “stacking” (creating a set of dependent pull requests). Stacking [2] allows developers to break up large pull requests (PRs) into smaller ones that can be reviewed &amp; merged independently, while keeping ongoing development unblocked. Engineering best practices at Google advise that a “reasonable” PR be around 100 lines, and recommend splitting PRs in order to achieve this through stacking or other methods. [3]</p><p>Unlike other tools like Phabricator, Gerrit, or Sapling, Graphite syncs seamlessly with your GitHub repositories, so that you don’t have to manage any extra infrastructure. This also means that even if your teammates don’t use Graphite yet, you still can.</p><p>Here’s what you can expect when you sign in to Graphite with your GitHub account:</p><p>(1) First class support for stacking: At its core, Graphite enables “stacking”—a workflow used by engineers at top companies like Meta and Google to create small, dependent sets of pull requests. The Graphite CLI, web app, and VS Code extension all come together to empower engineers to start stacking.</p><p>(2) Pull request inbox: You can think of this as your home page on Graphite, where you have full visibility into the status of all your PRs and know what still needs to be done across every repo, author, and stage of review. You can also create custom inboxes that filter PRs on reviewers, authors, labels, CI status, and more.</p><p>(3) Streamlined code review interface: Graphite’s pull request page removes tabs and minimizes distractions, with the aim of putting your code front and center. You can use keyboard shortcuts to navigate between files and comments or to move between PRs in your stack. You can also import custom memes and gifs to add some  to your reviews too!</p><p>(4) AI-powered pull requests: Auto-generate a detailed description for every PR with our OpenAI integration. You can even turn your comments into suggested code changes (coming soon!).</p><p>(5) Real-time notifications: Connect Graphite to your Slack workspace to stay up-to-date on review requests, comments threads, merge status, and other activity on your PRs. For smaller PRs, you can leave a review (and even merge) directly from Slack.</p><p>(6) Stack-aware merges: Since Graphite is built to support a stacking workflow, it automates the manual work of rebasing PRs when it’s time to merge. You can merge your stacks with one click from the web app, or in a single command from the CLI.</p><p>Feel free to take a look at our getting started guide [4] or product tour video [5] for a tutorial on how to get started, and drop your comments to us below!</p><p>[1] http://graphite.dev/blog/launch</p><p>[2] http://stacking.dev</p><p>[3] https://google.github.io/eng-practices/review/developer/small-cls.html</p><p>[4] https://graphite.dev/docs/getting-started-with-graphite</p><p>[5] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBcd9uopLOY</p></div></td></div></div>]]></description>

You can enable it by passing <code>--gc=G1</code> to Native Image via the command line or in your build file. While there are many possible GC strategies, for those looking for the best peak performance we recommend evaluating the combination of G1 and PGO.</p><p id="1411"><strong>New optimization levels policy</strong>. There are several optimization levels in Native Image you can choose from. You might be familiar with <code>-Ob</code>, the quick build mode, which can be used in development for faster builds. When you build your application for production, you should compile with more optimizations for better performance— when no custom option is provided, Native Image defaults to <code>-O2</code>. This level of optimization provides high performance, 10–15% faster compile times, and has been tuned for common Java microservice workloads.</p><p id="8294">Now we are introducing <strong>a new optimization level in Oracle GraalVM, </strong><code><strong>-O3</strong></code>, which applies maximum optimizations for the best peak performance. You can enable this optimization level yourself, and if you’re using PGO, it will be triggered automatically.</p><h2 id="b373">Developer Experience</h2><ul><li id="18d4">You can now use the option <code>--parallelism</code> to control how many threads are used by the build process — for example, <code>--parallelism=4.</code></li><li id="31b7">There are several other updates to the build output — it now shows the memory and thread limits of the build process, and you can control the color of output with <code>--color.</code></li><li id="1118">We’ve made changes to the <strong>memory limits</strong> of the Native Image build process. By default, the build process only uses free memory: this approach is intended to avoid slowing down your machine and other processes. If free memory is less than 8GB, the build process will use 85% of total memory. So if you observe your machine being slow during native builds, consider closing those processes you don’t need.</li><li id="89dd"><code>native-image-inspect</code> in Oracle GraalVM can now dump the heap of executables and shared libraries: <code>native-image-inspect --heap path/to/image</code>.</li><li id="2ff6"><strong>Special exception handling for missing metadata</strong>. Previously, missing metadata could lead to program misbehavior that was hard to debug. Now in cases when the metadata entry is missing, the call that was requiring it will fail with the special exception — for example, <code>MissingReflectionMetadataException</code>. There are also similar exceptions for missing resources and serialization metadata.</li><li id="104d"><strong>New Class Initialization Strategy.</strong> In this release, we are introducing a <a href="https://github.com/oracle/graal/pull/4684" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">new class initialization approach</a> that will become the default in the future: all classes are now allowed to be used and initialized at build time, regardless of the class initialization configuration. For classes that are configured as <code>--initialize-at-run-time</code> this means that they will appear as uninitialized again at run time. To enable the new approach, pass the <code>--strict-image-heap</code> flag to Native Image. In case you run into errors or issues with it, we will share more details in a blog post that will go out together with the October 24 patch release.</li><li id="beb1"><code>gu</code> is no longer needed for Native Image and GraalVM languages — learn how to <a href="https://github.com/oracle/graal/issues/6855" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">use additional components</a> now.</li><li id="aa8e">Support for the JFR event <code>ThreadCPULoad</code> was <a href="https://github.com/oracle/graal/pull/6588" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">contributed</a> by BellSoft.</li></ul><h2 id="a7fb">Experimental Build Options in Native Image</h2><p id="b0f3">There are many <a href="https://www.graalvm.org/latest/reference-manual/native-image/overview/BuildOptions/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">build options</a> in Native Image, most of which are stable, and some are experimental. To provide better awareness and control over options that are being used and avoid misuse, in this release we have added a new <code>-H:±UnlockExperimentalVMOptions</code> option to explicitly handle experimental options. Here’s how you can unlock and lock experimental options:</p><pre><span id="20f0">native-image -H:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions -H:SomeExperimentalOption \<br>             -H:-UnlockExperimentalVMOptions -cp ./ HelloWorld</span></pre><p id="5d81">Explicit enabling of experimental options will become required in the next release, but you can test this already in GraalVM for JDK 21 using the environment variable <code>NATIVE_IMAGE_EXPERIMENTAL_OPTIONS_ARE_FATAL=true</code>.</p><p id="f447">As we are stabilizing the public API, we encourage your feedback on which experimental features you are actively using in <a href="https://github.com/oracle/graal/issues/7370" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">the corresponding roadmap ticket</a>.</p><h2 id="e8c1">Control Flow Integrity in Native Image</h2><p id="cf0a">Oracle GraalVM now provides a form of control flow integrity (CFI) using ARM Pointer Authentication Code (PAC) on supported hardware. PAC mitigates return-oriented programming (ROP) attacks by ensuring the integrity of the return address of a function call: the return address is signed on function entry and the signature is checked before function return. Any tampering is detected by the CPU. You can enable it with the <code>-H:EnableCFI</code> option.</p><h2 id="1480">JDK and Compiler updates</h2><p id="300f">We implemented an initial optimization of <strong>Java Vector API (</strong><a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/338" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank"><strong>JEP 338</strong></a><strong>) operations </strong>in Oracle GraalVM. Multiple operations on the JVM are now transformed to efficient machine instructions where possible. This optimization is enabled by default (you can disable it with <code>-Dgraal.OptimizeVectorAPI=false</code>) and we welcome your feedback.</p><p id="877d">We also implemented several intrinsics for JDK 21 for both x64 and AArch64 architectures.</p><h2 id="8c38">Refactoring GraalVM SDK</h2><p id="6848"><a href="https://www.graalvm.org/sdk/javadoc/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">The GraalVM SDK</a> is split into four fine-grained modules:</p><ul><li id="649f"><code>org.graalvm.nativeimage</code>: The public API of Native Image for advanced use cases.</li><li id="74d0"><code>org.graalvm.polyglot</code>: A library that allows users to embed polyglot language implementations in Java.</li><li id="c64f"><code>org.graalvm.word</code>: A low-level library for machine-word-sized values in Java.</li><li id="64d2"><code>org.graalvm.collections</code>: A collections library for GraalVM components.</li></ul><p id="8dc2">Note that all GraalVM APIs remain compatible in this release.</p><h2 id="f33a">Ecosystem and Community</h2><ul><li id="3d99">GraalVM’s Maven and Gradle plugin, <a href="https://graalvm.github.io/native-build-tools/latest/index.html" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Native Build Tools</a>, released a new version, <a href="https://graalvm.github.io/native-build-tools/latest/index.html#_release_0_9_27" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">0.9.27</a>.</li><li id="5512"><a href="https://github.com/oracle/graalvm-reachability-metadata/releases" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">GraalVM Reachability Metadata</a> received several new contributions, such as metadata for <code>org.apache.kafka:kafka-clients</code>, <code>commons-logging:commons-logging</code>, <code>org.apache.httpcomponents:httpclient</code>, <code>liquibase-core</code>,<code>org.eclipse.paho.client.mqttv3,</code> and other projects.</li><li id="e643">Micronaut® framework 4.0 was released with support for a new GraalVM version and <a href="https://github.com/oracle/graalvm-reachability-metadata" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">GraalVM Reachability Metadata Repository</a>.</li><li id="134f">10MinuteMail shared how they used <a href="https://www.digitalsanctuary.com/10minutemail/migrating-10minutemail-from-java-to-graalvm-native.html" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">GraalVM and Spring Boot 3</a> to reduce their startup time from ~30 s down to about 3 ms, and memory usage from 6.6 GB down to 1 GB, with the same throughput and CPU utilization.</li><li id="798c">The Ballerina team <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDRi3rNiFqo" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">reached similar results</a> with GraalVM: their application went from 980 ms to 52 ms startup time and from 242 MB to 93 MB RSS with GraalVM.</li><li id="d6e4"><a href="https://twitter.com/mraible" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Matt Raible</a> compared the performance of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoU1ruBSXSA" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Native Java REST API Frameworks</a>.</li></ul><h2 id="577d">Conclusion</h2><p id="d3d8">We want to take this opportunity to thank our community for all the feedback, suggestions, and contributions that went into this release.

									<p>Walter Isaacson’s biography of Tesla CEO Elon Musk has uncovered several intriguing revelations. The latest revelation raises serious questions as to whether or not Tesla values its drivers’ privacy.</p>
<p>In his book, Isaacson shows how Musk wanted to spy on drivers to defend Tesla from lawsuits.</p>
<p>Musk insisted on using the internal monitoring camera in Tesla vehicles to record drivers’ behaviors behind the wheel. This driver behavior was to be used as evidence to safeguard the company during investigations following accidents. By recording driver behavior, Musk could argue that driver error led to the accidents rather than Tesla technology.</p>
<p>While most car manufacturers employ internal cameras to monitor driver attentiveness and issue warnings, Musk envisioned Tesla taking it a step further. The book highlights Musk’s push to collect data from the car’s cameras, including the one focused on the driver, to establish instances of driver error. Drivers were not to be informed about the monitoring.</p>
<p>However, during a meeting, a Tesla manager raised concerns regarding privacy. The manager pointed out that Musk’s driver monitoring technology would not be able to link the recorded footage to specific vehicles, even in the event of a crash.</p>
<p>Musk ignored the manager’s concerns. However, he did back down somewhat on his idea to spy on drivers without their consent.</p>
<p>Musk proposed a pop-up message, informing customers that data would be collected if they used the Full Self-Driving Beta feature. This placated the manager.</p>
<p>The pop-up exists in current Tesla vehicles and explains how the company plans to use data from the internal camera. Drivers are given the choice to agree or disagree with Tesla collecting cabin camera data.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that Tesla has not yet used internal vehicle images in legal disputes or investigations relating to the Autopilot system.</p>
<p>Even with Tesla’s use of pop-up messages, there continues to be numerous privacy complaints against the company.</p>
<p><a href="https://insideevs.com/news/687228/musk-wanted-use-tesla-in-car-video-win-lawsuits-biography/">According to InsideEVs</a>, Tesla is currently facing multiple class action lawsuits regarding video privacy. In one lawsuit, plaintiffs are alleging that groups of Tesla employees privately shared highly invasive videos captured by customers’ car cameras between 2019 and 2022.</p>
<p>Another lawsuit in Illinois specifically focuses on privacy violations involving the cabin camera.</p>

<h3><a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/430">JEP 430</a> String
Templates (Preview)<a href="#430" title="Direct link to this note"></a></h3>
<p>Enhance the Java programming language with <em>string

<h3><a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/441">JEP 441</a> Pattern
Matching for switch<a href="#441" title="Direct link to this note"></a></h3>
<p>Enhance the Java programming language with pattern matching for
<code>switch</code> expressions and statements. Extending pattern
matching to <code>switch</code> allows an expression to be tested
against a number of patterns, each with a specific action, so that
complex data-oriented queries can be expressed concisely and
safely.</p>

<h3><a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/442">JEP 442</a> Foreign
Function &amp; Memory API (Third Preview)<a href="#442" title="Direct link to this note"></a></h3>
<p>Introduce an API by which Java programs can interoperate with
code and data outside of the Java runtime. By efficiently invoking
foreign functions (i.e., code outside the JVM), and by safely
accessing foreign memory (i.e., memory not managed by the JVM), the
API enables Java programs to call native libraries and process
native data without the brittleness and danger of JNI. This is a
<a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/12">preview API</a>.</p>

<h3><a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/443">JEP 443</a> Unnamed
Patterns and Variables (Preview)<a href="#443" title="Direct link to this note"></a></h3>
<p>Enhance the Java language with <em>unnamed patterns</em>, which
match a record component without stating the component's name or
type, and <em>unnamed variables</em>, which can be initialized but
not used. Both are denoted by an underscore character,
<code>_</code>. This is a <a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/12">preview language feature</a>.</p>

<h3><a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/444">JEP 444</a> Virtual
Threads<a href="#444" title="Direct link to this note"></a></h3>
<p>Introduce <em>virtual threads</em> to the Java Platform. Virtual
threads are lightweight threads that dramatically reduce the effort
of writing, maintaining, and observing high-throughput concurrent
applications.</p>

<section id="445">
<h3><a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/445">JEP 445</a> Unnamed
Classes and Instance Main Methods (Preview)<a href="#445" title="Direct link to this note"></a></h3>
<p>Evolve the Java language so that students can write their first
programs without needing to understand language features designed
for large programs. Far from using a separate dialect of Java,
students can write streamlined declarations for single-class
programs and then seamlessly expand their programs to use more
advanced features as their skills grow. This is a <a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/12">preview language feature</a>.</p>

Instance Main Methods (Preview)</a></section>
<section id="446">
<h3><a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/446">JEP 446</a> Scoped
Values (Preview)<a href="#446" title="Direct link to this note"></a></h3>
<p>Introduce <em>scoped values</em>, values that may be safely and
efficiently shared to methods without using method parameters. They
are preferred to thread-local variables, especially when using
large numbers of virtual threads. This is a <a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/12">preview API</a>.</p>
<p>In effect, a scoped value is an <em>implicit method
parameter</em>. It is "as if" every method in a sequence of calls
has an additional, invisible, parameter. None of the methods
declare this parameter and only the methods that have access to the
scoped value object can access its value (the data). Scoped values
make it possible to pass data securely from a caller to a faraway
callee through a sequence of intermediate methods that do not
declare a parameter for the data and have no access to the
data.</p>

<h3><a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/448">JEP 448</a> Vector API
(Sixth Incubator)<a href="#448" title="Direct link to this note"></a></h3>
<p>Introduce an API to express vector computations that reliably
compile at runtime to optimal vector instructions on supported CPU
architectures, thus achieving performance superior to equivalent
scalar computations.</p>

<h3><a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/451">JEP 451</a> Prepare to
Disallow the Dynamic Loading of Agents<a href="#451" title="Direct link to this note"></a></h3>
<p>Issue warnings when agents are loaded dynamically into a running
JVM. These warnings aim to prepare users for a future release which
disallows the dynamic loading of agents by default in order to
<a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/8305968">improve integrity by
default</a>. Serviceability tools that load agents at startup will
not cause warnings to be issued in any release.</p>

<h3><a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/452">JEP 452</a> Key
Encapsulation Mechanism API<a href="#452" title="Direct link to this note"></a></h3>
<p>Introduce an API for key encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs), an
encryption technique for securing symmetric keys using public key
cryptography.</p>
</section>
<section id="453">
<h3><a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/453">JEP 453</a> Structured
Concurrency (Preview)<a href="#453" title="Direct link to this note"></a></h3>
<p>Simplify concurrent programming by introducing an API for
<em>structured concurrency</em>. Structured concurrency treats
groups of related tasks running in different threads as a single
unit of work, thereby streamlining error handling and cancellation,
improving reliability, and enhancing observability. This is a

<section>
<p>The Sequenced Collection API introduces several new interfaces
into the collections framework, providing enhancements to many
existing collections classes. The new API facilitates access to
elements at each end of a sequenced collection, and provides the
ability to view and iterate such collections in reverse order. See
<a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/431">JEP 431</a> for additional
information.</p>
<p>The introduction of new collections interfaces, along with
default methods, introduces some compatibility risk, including the
possibility of both source and binary incompatibilities. The
introduction of default methods in an interface hierarchy may cause
conflicts with methods declared on existing classes or interfaces
that extend collections interfaces - this could result in either
source or binary incompatibilities. The introduction of new
interfaces also introduces new types into the system, which can
change the results of type inference, leading in turn to source
incompatibilities.</p>
<p>For a discussion of potential incompatibilities and possible
ways to mitigate them, please see the document <a href="https://inside.java/2023/05/12/quality-heads-up/">JDK 21:

<h3>Warning Printed when an Agent Is Loaded into a Running VM
<span>( <a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/451">JEP 451</a>)</span><a href="#JDK-8307478" title="Direct link to this note"></a></h3>
<section>core-svc/tools</section>
<section>
<p>The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) now prints a warning to standard
error when a JVM Tool Interface (JVM TI) agent or Java Agent is
dynamically loaded into a running JVM. The warning is intended to
prepare for a future release that disallows, by default, dynamic
loading of agent code into a running JVM.</p>
<p>Agents are programs that run in the JVM process and make use of
powerful JVM TI or <code>java.lang.instrument</code> APIs. These
APIs are designed to support tooling such as profilers and
debuggers. Agents are started via a command line option, for
example <code>-agentlib</code> or <code>-javaagent</code>, or they
can be started into a running VM using the JDK specific
<code>com.sun.tools.attach</code> API or the <code>jcmd</code>
command. Agents loaded into a running VM will now print a warning.
There is no warning for agents that are loaded at startup via
command line options.</p>
<p>The HotSpot VM option <code>EnableDynamicAgentLoading</code>
controls dynamic loading of agents. This option has existed since
JDK 9. The default, since JDK 9, is to allow dynamic loading of
agents. Running with <code>-XX:+EnableDynamicAgentLoading</code> on
the command line serves as an explicit "opt-in" that allows agent
code to be loaded into a running VM and thus suppresses the
warning. Running with <code>-XX:-EnableDynamicAgentLoading</code>
disallows agent code from being loaded into a running VM and can be
used to test possible future behavior.</p>
<p>In addition, the system property
<code>jdk.instrument.traceUsage</code> can be used to trace uses of
the <code>java.lang.instrument</code> API. Running with
<code>-Djdk.instrument.traceUsage</code> or
<code>-Djdk.instrument.traceUsage=true</code> causes usages of the
API to print a trace message and stack trace. This can be used to
identify agents that are dynamically loaded instead of being
started on the command line with <code>-javaagent</code>.</p>

<p>This feature delivers an enhanced syntax for properties related
to certificate, CRL, and OCSP connect and read timeouts. The new
syntax allows the timeout values to be specified either in seconds
or milliseconds. This feature also delivers three new System
properties related to connect and read timeouts.</p>
<p><em>New properties</em>: The existing
<code>com.sun.security.ocsp.timeout</code> property will now be
paired with the new <code>com.sun.security.ocsp.readtimeout</code>
property. The former property will be used to set timeouts for the
transport-layer connection while the latter will be used to manage
timeouts for reading the data. The new
<code>com.sun.security.cert.timeout</code> and
<code>com.sun.security.cert.readtimeout</code> properties will be
used to control connect and read timeouts, respectively, when
following an X.509 certificate's AuthorityInfoAccess extension. For
the certificate fetching properties, the
<code>com.sun.security.enableAIAcaIssuers</code> property must be
set to <code>true</code> in order for fetching to occur and these
property timeouts to be enabled.</p>
<p><em>Enhanced timeout syntax</em>: The new syntax applies to the
aforementioned properties, and also to the
<code>com.sun.security.crl.timeout</code> and
<code>com.sun.security.crl.readtimeout</code> properties as well.
The allowed syntax is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>A decimal integer will be interpreted in seconds and ensures
backward compatibility.</li>
<li>A decimal integer ending in "s" (case-insensitive, no space)
appended to it. This will also be interpreted in seconds.</li>
<li>A decimal integer value with "ms" (case-insensitive, no space)
appended to it. This will be interpreted as milliseconds. For
example, a value of "2500ms" will be a 2.5 second timeout.</li>
<li>Negative, non-numeric, or non-decimal (for example, hexadecimal
values prepended by "0x") values will be interpreted as illegal and
will default to the 15 second timeout.</li>
<li>Whether the value is interpreted in seconds or milliseconds, a
value of zero will disable the timeout.</li>

<section>core-libs/java.lang</section>
<section>
<p>Since JDK 13, executing commands in a sub-process uses the
so-called <code>POSIX_SPAWN</code> launching mechanism (that is,
<code>-Djdk.lang.Process.launchMechanism=POSIX_SPAWN</code>) by
default on Linux. In cases where the parent JVM process terminates
abnormally before the handshake between the JVM and the newly
created <code>jspawnhelper</code> process has completed,
<code>jspawnhelper</code> can hang indefinitely in JDK 13 to JDK
20. This issue is fixed in JDK 21. The issue was especially harmful
if the parent process had open sockets, because in that case, the
forked <code>jspawnhelper</code> process will inherit them and keep
all the corresponding ports open, effectively preventing other
processes from binding to them.</p>
<p>This misbehavior has been observed with applications which
frequently fork child processes in environments with tight memory
constraints. In such cases, the OS can kill the JVM in the middle
of the forking process leading to the described issue. Restarting
the JVM process after such a crash will be impossible if the new
process tries to bind to the same ports as the initial application
because they will be blocked by the hanging
<code>jspawnhelper</code> child process.</p>
<p>The root cause of this issue is <code>jspawnhelper</code>'s
omission to close its writing end of the pipe, which is used for
the handshake with the parent JVM. It was fixed by closing the
writing end of the communication pipe before attempting to read
data from the parent process. This way, <code>jspawnhelper</code>
will reliably read an EOF event from the communication pipe and
terminate once the parent process dies prematurely.</p>
<p>A second variant of this issue could happen because the
handshaking code in the JDK didn't handle interrupts to
<code>write(2)</code> correctly. This could lead to incomplete
messages being sent to the <code>jspawnhelper</code> child process.
The result is a deadlock between the parent thread and the child
process which manifests itself in a <code>jspawnhelper</code>
process being blocked while reading from a pipe and the following
stack trace in the corresponding parent Java process:</p>
<pre><code>java.lang.Thread.State: RUNNABLE

<p>Maintainers of applications that do network multicasting or use
the <code>java.net.NetworkInterface</code> API should note that the
names that the JDK assigns to network interfaces on Windows have
changed in this release. The JDK historically synthesized names for
network interfaces on Windows. This has changed to use the names
assigned by the Windows operating system. For example, the JDK may
have historically assigned a name such as “eth0” for an ethernet
interface and “lo” for the loopback. The equivalent names that
Windows assigns may be names such as “ethernet_32768” and
“loopback_0".</p>
<p>This change may impact code that does a lookup of network
interfaces with the <code>NetworkInterace.getByName(String
name)</code> method. It also may also be surprising to code that
enumerates all network interfaces with the
<code>NetworkInterfaces.networkInterfaces()</code> or
<code>NetworkInterface.getNetworkInterfaces()</code> methods as the
names of the network interfaces will look different to previous
releases. Depending on configuration, it is possible that
enumerating all network interfaces will enumerate network
interfaces that weren’t previously enumerated because they didn’t
have an Internet Protocol address assigned. The display name
returned by <code>NetworkInterface::getDisplayName</code> has not
changed so this should facilitate the identification of network
interfaces when using Windows native tools.</p>

<p>This change is justified by JLS § 13.1, in particular:</p>
<pre><code>A binary representation for a class or interface must also contain all of the following:

11. A construct emitted by a Java compiler must be marked as synthetic if it does not

<section>
<p>A new compiler lint flag, <code>output-file-clash</code>,
enables detection of output file clashes. An output file clash is
when the compiler intends to write two different output files, but
due to the behavior of the operating system, these files end up
being written to the same underlying file.</p>
<p>This usually happens due to case-insensitive file systems. For
example, a class like this would cause two class files to be
written to the same file, <code>Test$Inner.class</code>:</p>
<pre><code>public class Test {
    class Inner {
    }
    class INNER {
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>However, this problem can also happen when the file system
"normalizes" file names. For example, on macOS, compiling this
class will generate such a clash:</p>
<pre><code>public class Test {
    interface Cafeu0301 {
    }
    interface Cafu00e9 {
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The reason is that <code>u0301</code> is the Unicode character
"Combining Acute Accent" which means "add an accent over the
previous character". MacOS normalizes the letter <code>e</code>
followed by a <code>u0301</code> into a Unicode <code>u00e9</code>,
that is, <code>é</code>. However, the Java language treats these
the two names, <code>Cafeu0301</code> and <code>Cafu00e9</code>, as
distinct.</p>
<p>Compiling the example above on macOS with
<code>-Xlint:output-file-clash</code> will now generate a warning
like this:</p>

<p>Prior to JDK 21, the <code>javac</code> compiler was omitting
some "potentially ambiguous overload" warnings enabled by the
<code>-Xlint:overloads</code> option.</p>
<p>If the <code>-Xlint:overloads</code> option is enabled, the
compiler warns when the methods in a class create a potential
ambiguity for method invocations containing an implicit lambda
expression parameter like <code>x -&gt; { ... }</code>. An
ambiguity can occur if two or more methods could match such a
method call, like when one method takes a
<code>Consumer&lt;Integer&gt;</code> parameter where the other
takes an <code>IntConsumer</code>. For example, the
<code>javac</code> compiler should issue a warning for code such
as:</p>
<pre><code>    interface I {
        void foo(Consumer&lt;Integer&gt; c);
        void foo(IntConsumer c);
    }
</code></pre>
<p>Prior to JDK 21, the warning was only issued for a class if one
of the methods was declared in the class. The <code>javac</code>
compiler now also warns when neither method is declared in the
class. That is, both methods are inherited from supertypes. For
example, for code like:</p>
<pre><code>    interface I {
        void foo(Consumer&lt;Integer&gt; c);
    }

    interface J {
        void foo(IntConsumer c);
    }

    interface K extends I, J {}
