<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>I've been involved in the Rust project in some form or another since 2016, and it's a language I'm very comfortable using. Many Rust programmers could <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2024/02/19/2023-Rust-Annual-Survey-2023-results.html">say the same</a>. But, if we take a step back and are honest with ourselves, we'd admit that the road to getting to that level of comfort was difficult.</p>
<p>I taught Rust professionally for two years. Watching the faces of people trying to learn Rust for the first time reminded me just how hard this language is to learn.</p>
<p>After two years of that, I wanted to answer a question I wasn't entirely sure had an answer: <em>Is it possible to make an easy-to-use, easy-to-learn, and easy-to-teach safe systems language?</em> Could I put my career working on programming languages (TypeScript, Rust, Nushell, etc) to use and find a solution?</p>
<h2 id="enter-june">Enter June</h2>
<p>For the last year and a half, I and my recently-added collaborator Jane Losare-Lusby have been working in secret on a safe systems language that could be learned about as quickly as one can learn Go. I think we might have something worth exploring.</p>
<h2 id="changing-how-we-think-of-memory">Changing how we think of memory</h2>
<p>In Rust, we think of each piece of memory as having its own lifetime. Each of these lifetimes must be tracked, sometimes leading to rather complex code, complex error messages, and/or complex mental models of what is happening. The complexity of course comes with the benefit of being highly precise about each and every piece of memory and its reclamation.</p>
<p>Using a Rust example:</p>
<pre><code><span>struct </span><span>Node {
    </span><span>data1</span><span>: &amp;Data
    data2: &amp;Data
    data3: &amp;Data
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Rust developers will spot right away that this is an incomplete example. We need two more things: Lifetime Parameters and Lifetime Annotations. Adding those, we get:</p>
<pre><code><span>struct </span><span>Node&lt;</span><span>'a</span><span>, </span><span>'b</span><span>, </span><span>'c</span><span>&gt; {
    </span><span>data1</span><span>: &amp;</span><span>'a</span><span> Data
    data2: &amp;</span><span>'b</span><span> Data
    data3: &amp;</span><span>'c</span><span> Data
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>The concept count for this example ends up being pretty substantial. Counting them off, we get:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lifetimes</li>
<li>Lifetime annotations</li>
<li>Lifetime parameters</li>
<li>Ownership and borrowing</li>
<li>Generics</li>
</ul>
<p>When I showed examples like this to my class when I taught Rust, I had to walk them through each of those concepts first before I could show the full example.</p>
<p>The question then is: can we make this easier?</p>
<h2 id="what-if-memory-was-grouped">What if memory was grouped?</h2>
<p>What if instead of having to track every piece of memory's lifetime separately, we let groups of related allocations share a lifetime?</p>
<p>Effectively, this would mean that a data structure, like a linked list, would have a pointer pointing to the head which has a lifetime, and then every node in the list you can reach from that head has the same lifetime.</p>
<p>There are some benefits to this approach, as well as a few drawbacks. Let's take a look at the benefits first.</p>
<h2 id="benefits-of-grouped-allocations">Benefits of grouped allocations</h2>
<p>Exploring grouped allocations, we noticed some immediate benefits. The first is that we could treat all user-defined values as pointers, and these pointers could also represent their own lifetimes (without needing lifetime parameters). This makes the code feel quite a bit lighter:</p>
<pre><code><span>struct </span><span>Node {
    </span><span>data</span><span>: </span><span>i64</span><span>
    next: Node?
}

</span><span>let</span><span> n = new Node(data: </span><span>123</span><span>, next: none)
</span></code></pre>
<p>Since all user data is pointers, we can use the name of the type to mean "pointer to this structured data".</p>
<p>The next thing we noticed is that both lifetimes and inference for lifetimes becomes significantly simpler.</p>
<p>Let's take a variation of the example above:</p>
<pre><code><span>struct </span><span>Node {
    </span><span>data</span><span>: </span><span>i64</span><span>
    next: Node?
}

fun </span><span>do_this</span><span>() {
    </span><span>let</span><span> n = new Node(data: </span><span>123</span><span>, next: none)
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>We can infer that the allocation that creates <code>new Node(...)</code> has a lifetime and what it is. Because this allocation never "escapes" the function - that is, it never leaves the function in any way - then we can call its lifetime "Local".</p>
<p>As we'll find out, each of the lifetime possibities is a readable name that we can show the user in error messages. It also makes things significantly easier to teach.</p>
<p>Let's look at another example to see a different lifetime.</p>
<pre><code><span>struct </span><span>Stats {
    </span><span>age</span><span>: </span><span>i64
</span><span>}

</span><span>struct </span><span>Employee {
    </span><span>name</span><span>: c_string,
    </span><span>stats</span><span>: Stats,
}

fun </span><span>set_stats</span><span>(</span><span>mut</span><span> employee: Employee) {
    employee.stats = new Stats(age: </span><span>33</span><span>)
}

fun </span><span>main</span><span>() {
    </span><span>mut</span><span> employee = new Employee(name: c"</span><span>Soph</span><span>", stats: new Stats(age: </span><span>22</span><span>))
    </span><span>set_stats</span><span>(employee)
    </span><span>println</span><span>(employee.stats.age)
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>A bit of a longer example this time, but let's focus on this function:</p>
<pre><code><span>fun </span><span>set_stats</span><span>(</span><span>mut</span><span> employee: Employee) {
    employee.stats = new Stats(age: </span><span>33</span><span>)
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>What's the lifetime of this <code>new Stats(..)</code> allocation? In this example, we do see the new pointer escape the function via a parameter. We can also give this a readable lifetime: <code>Param(employee)</code></p>
<p>In all, we have three lifetimes an allocation can have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Local</li>
<li>Param(xxxx)</li>
<li>Return</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="any-data-structure-you-want">Any data structure you want</h2>
<p>Another big advantage of grouping our allocations is that we no longer have to worry about a drop order. This means we can think of the whole thing as dropping all at once. For large structures, that can be a speed-up over languages with a required drop order.</p>
<p>Additionally, we get another major benefit. We can now create arbitrary data structures.</p>
<pre><code><span>struct </span><span>Node {
    </span><span>data</span><span>: </span><span>i64</span><span>
    next: Node?
}

</span><span>mut</span><span> node3 = new Node(data: </span><span>3</span><span>, next: none)
</span><span>let</span><span> node2 = new Node(data: </span><span>2</span><span>, next: node3)
</span><span>let</span><span> node1 = new Node(data: </span><span>1</span><span>, next: node2)

node3.next = node1
</span></code></pre>
<p>And just like that, we've made a circular linked list. Creating a similar example in Rust is certainly more of a challenge.</p>
<p>But, something fishy is going on here.</p>
<p>To make the above work, we're using shared, mutable pointers. This is explicitly forbidden in Rust. Why is it okay here?</p>

<p>Rust disallows holding two mutable references to the same memory location and for good reason. Well, multiple reasons actually.</p>
<p>First, having two copies of a mutable pointer where two separate threads each hold a copy means we have the possibility for a race condition. This can leave us with incoherent data that's difficult to debug.</p>
<p>Second, even if these two multiple pointers are limited to the same thread, we get what we might call "spooky action at a distance". The modification of one pointer is then visible to the holder of the other pointer, which might be far away from the source of the mutation.</p>
<p>For us to reasonably use shared, mutable pointers, we need to tame both of these. The first issue, the race condition, is easy enough: we prevent sending shared, mutable pointers between threads. This limits them to a single thread.</p>
<p>The second issue is decidedly harder. There have been many attempts at ways of handling this through rules enforced by the type system.</p>
<p>In June, we're trying something a bit different. We'll let developers use shared, mutable pointers, but then offer a "carrot" to opt-in to restrictions around using them. The carrot ends up pulling from a classic technique of software engineering: encapsulation.</p>
<h2 id="the-full-power-of-encapsulation">The full power of encapsulation</h2>
<p>In traditional encapsulation, programmers make a kind of "best effort" to hide implementation details from the world around them. Keeping private state private grants the benefits of better code reuse, ease of updating implementation details, and more.</p>
<p>But as often is the case, if that kind of rule isn't enforced, over time APIs get designed where internal implementation details leak out.</p>
<p>Something very interesting happens if we don't allow this to happen. If an encapsulation can be checked by the compiler, and the compiler enforces that no private details leak, we have what you might call "full encapsulation".</p>
<p>These kinds of encapsulations wouldn't allow any aliasing of pointers into them. They'd have their internal pointers fully isolated from the rest of the program.</p>
<p>Once we have this, some new capabilities start opening up:</p>
<ul>
<li>We can "fence off" our shared, mutable pointers, making it possible to create single-owner encapsulations that can be sent safely between threads.</li>
<li>We can lean people in the direction of cleaner API design, as now we have a way to truly keep private implementation details private.</li>
<li>We can handle some of the drawbacks of grouped allocations.</li>
</ul>
<p>What kind of drawbacks, you might ask? It's high time we talked about them.</p>
<h2 id="drawbacks-of-grouped-allocations">Drawbacks of grouped allocations</h2>
<p>If we go back to our earlier example and look carefully, we'll notice something:</p>
<pre><code><span>fun </span><span>set_stats</span><span>(</span><span>mut</span><span> employee: Employee) {
    employee.stats = new Stats(age: </span><span>33</span><span>)
}

fun </span><span>main</span><span>() {
    </span><span>mut</span><span> employee = new Employee(name: c"</span><span>Soph</span><span>", stats: new Stats(age: </span><span>22</span><span>))
    </span><span>set_stats</span><span>(employee)
    </span><span>println</span><span>(employee.stats.age)
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>The question is: what happened to the <code>new Stats(age: 22)</code> allocation?</p>
<p>Remembering that June is a systems language, we can't say "the garbage collector handled it" because we have no garbage collector. Nor can we say "the refcount hit zero, so we reclaimed it" as we don't use refcounting. As a systems language, we can't allow hidden or difficult-to-predict overhead to happen.</p>
<p>It's not actually leaked either, as even the memory it occupies will be reclaimed once the entire group is reclaimed. For all intents and purposes, though, it's lost to the user until the group is no longer live. It's a kind of "memory bloat" that happens if we group our allocations.</p>
<p>To handle this, we'll need some way of recycling that memory. I say "recycling" specifically because in June we can't free the memory, as the group is treated together as a single entity where all the allocations in the group are freed at once. If we instead recycle the memory, we can reuse that same memory while the group is live.</p>
<p>Techniques to do this have been around for decades, and often people use "free lists" to keep a list of nodes that have been recycled, so they can be reused when the next allocation happens.</p>
<p>The problem with free lists is that they aren't safe. If you're not careful, you'll create a security vulnerability and/or an incredibly hard bug to find.</p>
<p>Instead, we need to build in a safe way of recycling memory into the language.</p>
<h2 id="safe-memory-recycling">Safe memory recycling</h2>
<p>Using the idea of full encapsulation from earlier, we can create "fenced in" sets of pointers that we know aren't shared with the rest of the world. Once we have them, it's possible to track the pointers inside. These pointers can get a "copy count", so we know how many copies are live at any point in time (not dissimilar from a refcount, though this has no automatic reclamation).</p>
<p>Once we have a copy count for each internal pointer, we can give developers a built-in <code>recycle</code> command.</p>
<pre><code><span>let x = new Foo()
recycle x
</span></code></pre>
<p>Recycling would start at the given pointer and would check the pointers reachable from it. Each pointer it finds that it can recycle would go into the safe free list.</p>
<p>You might wonder "why not do this automatically?". There are a couple reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The operation is linear time based on your transitively-reachable pointers. This means you may incur a noticeable overhead when recycling</li>
<li>Because of the first point, it's important to make places where this occurs visible</li>
</ul>
<p>If this sounds like a kind of manual garbage collection, you're right. My collaborator Jane calls this "semi-automatic" memory reclamation. You ask once, and when you ask you get a kind of highly focused mark and sweep for that single pointer and the pointers reachable from it.</p>
<p><em>Note: this feature is not yet in the reference compiler. We're hoping to implement it in the coming weeks.</em></p>
<h2 id="more-work-ahead">More work ahead</h2>
<p>We have a way of simplifying lifetimes, making for readable code that people from various languages should be able to understand and use. We can also give clear, easy-to-understand lifetime errors when they arise.</p>
<p>Having safe memory recycling gives us a way to keep groups and still offer things like <code>delete</code> in a linked list abstraction. It's convenient but not so automatic that we lose the visibility into the costs of memory management.</p>
<p>That said, there are still some challenge ahead that will need to be solved in the language design and tooling. For example, how do you know when the program is bloating memory? We'll need some way of doing a memory trace when the program is running to detect this and warn the developer.</p>
<p>I see this in a way as a more incremental/prototype-friendly way of development. June is always memory safe, but the first version of a program may not be as efficient as it could be in terms of memory usage. That's a process we often go through as developers. First, we "make it work" before we "make it good".</p>
<p>In June, we keep it lightweight as we keep your programs memory safe, and then we provide tools and support for incrementally improving code.</p>
<h2 id="future-possibilities">Future possibilities</h2>
<h3 id="relationship-to-rust">Relationship to Rust</h3>
<p>June has a real opportunity to be a good complement to Rust. Rust's focus on embedded and system's development is a core strength. June, on the other hand, has a lean towards application development with a system's approach. This lets both co-exist and offer safe systems programming to a larger audience.</p>
<p>An even better end state requires Rust to have a stable ABI. Once it does, June will be able to call into Rust crates to get the benefits of Rust's substantial crate ecosystem. We're looking forward to collaborating on this in the future.</p>
<h3 id="going-beyond-oop">Going beyond OOP</h3>
<p>OOP has for decades been the way many applications are written, but it's not without its flaws. Many OOP languages allow programmers to freely break good rules of thumb, like the Liskov substitution principle, or to create a mess of interwoven code between parent and child classes that's difficult to maintain.</p>
<p>We're currently investigating other ways of making code reuse easier, more modular, and more composible. We're not quite ready to talk about this, though we hope to soon.</p>

<p>Over the years, there have been a <a href="https://verdagon.dev/grimoire/grimoire">number of memory management techniques tried</a>, including many that lie outside of the ones commonly found in languages today. We'd like to explore these more deeply to see which, if any, may help June.</p>
<h2 id="acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</h2>
<p>We had the help of dozens of experts in various fields as we brainstormed the initial design for June, and for their contributions, we're thankful. We'd especially like to thank the collaborators who went above and beyond with their time across multiple brainstorming sessions to help June grow to where it is.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>In the 1990s, the constant error carousel and gating were introduced as the central ideas of the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Since then, LSTMs have stood the test of time and contributed to numerous deep learning success stories, in particular they constituted the first Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the advent of the Transformer technology with parallelizable self-attention at its core marked the dawn of a new era, outpacing LSTMs at scale. We now raise a simple question: How far do we get in language modeling when scaling LSTMs to billions of parameters, leveraging the latest techniques from modern LLMs, but mitigating known limitations of LSTMs? Firstly, we introduce exponential gating with appropriate normalization and stabilization techniques. Secondly, we modify the LSTM memory structure, obtaining: (i) sLSTM with a scalar memory, a scalar update, and new memory mixing, (ii) mLSTM that is fully parallelizable with a matrix memory and a covariance update rule. Integrating these LSTM extensions into residual block backbones yields xLSTM blocks that are then residually stacked into xLSTM architectures. Exponential gating and modified memory structures boost xLSTM capabilities to perform favorably when compared to state-of-the-art Transformers and State Space Models, both in performance and scaling.

<h2>Key Facts</h2>
<div>
 <div>
  <p>The board affirmed the decision of administrative law Judge Lauren Esposito, who ruled last year that Apple illegally stopped workers from placing union flyers on a table in the break room of the World Trade Center store, confiscated the flyers and interrogated staff over their “protected concerted activity.”</p>
  
 </div>
 <div>
  <p>Esposito ordered Apple cease and desist from illegally questioning workers about union matters in addition to confiscating union flyers from the store’s employee break room.</p>

<h2>Key Background</h2>
<p>Other cases against Apple are still pending, according to Bloomberg, which noted a case in which a National Labor Relations Board member accused the company of illegally excluding unionized workers from certain benefits.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>Jeff Atwood, perhaps the most widely read programming blogger, has a post that makes <a rel="nofollow" href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/to-ecc-or-not-to-ecc/">a case against using ECC memory</a>. My read is that his major points are:</p> <ol> <li>Google didn't use ECC when they built their servers in 1999</li> <li>Most RAM errors are hard errors and not soft errors</li> <li>RAM errors are rare because hardware has improved</li> <li>If ECC were actually important, it would be used everywhere and not just servers. Paying for optional stuff like this is "awfully enterprisey"</li> </ol>  <p>Let's take a look at these arguments one by one:</p> <h2 id="1-google-didn-t-use-ecc-in-1999">1. Google didn't use ECC in 1999</h2> <p>Not too long after Google put these non-ECC machines into production, they realized this was a serious error and not worth the cost savings. If you think cargo culting what Google does is a good idea because it's Google, here are some things you might do:</p> <h4 id="a-put-your-servers-into-shipping-containers">A. Put your servers into shipping containers.</h4> <p>Articles are still written today about what a great idea this is, even though this was an experiment at Google that was deemed unsuccessful. Turns out, even Google's experiments don't always succeed. In fact, their propensity for “moonshots” in the early days meannt that they had more failed experiments that most companies. Copying their failed experiments isn't a particularly good strategy.</p> <h4 id="b-cause-fires-in-your-own-datacenters">B. Cause fires in your own datacenters</h4> <p>Part of the post talks about how awesome these servers are:</p> <blockquote> <p>Some people might look at these early Google servers and see an amateurish fire hazard. Not me. I see a prescient understanding of how inexpensive commodity hardware would shape today's internet. I felt right at home when I saw this server; it's exactly what I would have done in the same circumstances</p> </blockquote> <p>The last part of that is true. But the first part has a grain of truth, too. When Google started designing their own boards, one generation had a regrowth<sup id="fnref:R"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:R">1</a></sup> issue that caused a non-zero number of fires.</p> <p>BTW, if you click through to Jeff's post and look at the photo that the quote refers to, you'll see that the boards have a lot of flex in them. That caused problems and was fixed in the next generation. You can also observe that the cabling is quite messy, which also caused problems, and was also fixed in the next generation. There were other problems as well. <abbr title="When someone looks in the answer key and says, 'I would've come up with that', that's often plausible when their answer is perfect. But when they say that after seeing a specific imperfect answer, it's a bit less plausible that they'd reproduce the exact same mistakes">Jeff's argument here appears to be that, if he were there at the time, he would've seen the exact same opportunities that early Google enigneers did, and since Google did this, it must've been the right thing even if it doesn't look like it. But, a number of things that make it look like not the right thing actually made it not the right thing.</abbr></p> <h4 id="c-make-servers-that-injure-your-employees">C. Make servers that injure your employees</h4> <p>One generation of Google servers had infamously sharp edges, giving them the reputation of being made of “razor blades and hate”.</p> <h4 id="d-create-weather-in-your-datacenters">D. Create weather in your datacenters</h4> <p>From talking to folks at a lot of large tech companies, it seems that most of them have had a climate control issue resulting in clouds or fog in their datacenters. You might call this a clever plan by Google to reproduce Seattle weather so they can poach MS employees. Alternately, it might be a plan to create literal cloud computing. Or maybe not.</p> <p>Note that these are all things Google tried and then changed. Making mistakes and then fixing them is common in every successful engineering organization. If you're going to cargo cult an engineering practice, you should at least cargo cult current engineering practices, not <a href="https://danluu.com/butler-lampson-1999/">something that was done in 1999</a>.</p> <p>When Google used servers without ECC back in 1999, they found a number of symptoms that were ultimately due to memory corruption, including a search index that returned effectively random results to queries. The actual failure mode here is instructive. I often hear that it's ok to ignore ECC on these machines because it's ok to have errors in individual results. But even when you can tolerate occasional errors, ignoring errors means that you're exposing yourself to total corruption, unless you've done a very careful analysis to make sure that a single error can only contaminate a single result. In research that's been done on filesystems, it's been repeatedly shown that despite making valiant attempts at creating systems that are robust against a single error, it's extremely hard to do so and basically every heavily tested filesystem can have a massive failure from a single error (<a href="https://danluu.com/file-consistency/">see the output of Andrea and Remzi's research group at Wisconsin if you're curious about this</a>). I'm not knocking filesystem developers here. They're better at that kind of analysis than 99.9% of programmers. It's just that this problem has been repeatedly shown to be hard enough that humans cannot effectively reason about it, and automated tooling for this kind of analysis is still far from a push-button process. In their book on <a href="http://www.morganclaypool.com/doi/abs/10.2200/S00516ED2V01Y201306CAC024">warehouse scale computing</a>, Google discusses error correction and detection and ECC is cited as their slam dunk case for when it's obvious that you should use hardware error correction<sup id="fnref:P"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:P">2</a></sup>.</p> <p>Google has great infrastructure. From what I've heard of the infra at other large tech companies, Google's sounds like the best in the world. But that doesn't mean that you should copy everything they do. Even if you look at their good ideas, it doesn't make sense for most companies to copy them. They <a href="https://danluu.com/intel-cat/">created a replacement for Linux's work stealing scheduler that uses both hardware run-time information and static traces to allow them to take advantage of new hardware in Intel's server processors that lets you dynamically partition caches between cores</a>. If used across their entire fleet, that could easily save Google more money in a week than stackexchange has spent on machines in their entire history. Does that mean you should copy Google? No, not unless you've already captured all the lower hanging fruit, which includes things like making sure that your core infrastructure is written in highly optimized C++, not Java or (god forbid) Ruby. And the thing is, for the vast majority of companies, writing in a language that imposes a 20x performance penalty is a totally reasonable decision.</p> <h2 id="2-most-ram-errors-are-hard-errors">2. Most RAM errors are hard errors</h2> <p>The case against ECC quotes <a href="http://selse.org//images/selse_2012/Papers/selse2012_submission_4.pdf">this section of a study on DRAM errors</a> (the bolding is Jeff's):</p> <blockquote> <p>Our study has several main findings. First, we find that approximately <strong>70% of DRAM faults are recurring (e.g., permanent) faults, while only 30% are transient faults.</strong> Second, we find that large multi-bit faults, such as faults that affects an entire row, column, or bank, constitute over 40% of all DRAM faults. Third, we find that almost 5% of DRAM failures affect board-level circuitry such as data (DQ) or strobe (DQS) wires. Finally, we find that chipkill functionality reduced the system failure rate from DRAM faults by 36x.</p> </blockquote> <p>This seems to betray a lack of understanding of the implications of this study, as this quote doesn't sound like an argument against ECC; it sounds like an argument for "chipkill", a particular class of ECC. Putting that aside, Jeff's post points out that hard errors are twice as common as soft errors, and then mentions that they run memtest on their machines when they get them. First, a 2:1 ratio isn't so large that you can just ignore soft errors. Second the post implies that Jeff believes that hard errors are basically immutable and can't surface after some time, which is incorrect. You can think of electronics as wearing out just the same way mechanical devices wear out. The mechanisms are different, but the effects are similar. In fact, if you compare reliability analysis of chips vs. other kinds of reliability analysis, you'll find they often use the same families of distributions to model failures. And, if hard errors were immutable, they would generally get caught in testing by the manufacturer, who can catch errors much more easily than consumers can because they have hooks into circuits that let them test memory much more efficiently than you can do in your server or home computer. Third, Jeff's line of reasoning implies that ECC can't help with detection or correction of hard errors, which is not only incorrect but directly contradicted by the quote.</p> <p>So, how often are you going to run memtest on your machines to try to catch these hard errors, and how much data corruption are you willing to live with? One of the key uses of ECC is not to correct errors, but to signal errors so that hardware can be replaced before silent corruption occurs. No one's going to consent to shutting down everything on a machine every day to run memtest (that would be more expensive than just buying ECC memory), and even if you could convince people to do that, it won't catch as many errors as ECC will.</p> <p>When I worked at a company that owned about 1000 machines, we noticed that we were getting strange consistency check failures, and after maybe half a year we realized that the failures were more likely to happen on some machines than others. The failures were quite rare, maybe a couple times a week on average, so it took a substantial amount of time to accumulate the data, and more time for someone to realize what was going on. Without knowing the cause, analyzing the logs to figure out that the errors were caused by single bit flips (with high probability) was also non-trivial. We were lucky that, as a side effect of the process we used, the checksums were calculated in a separate process, on a different machine, at a different time, so that an error couldn't corrupt the result and propagate that corruption into the checksum. If you merely try to protect yourself with in-memory checksums, there's a good chance you'll perform a checksum operation on the already corrupted data and compute a valid checksum of bad data unless you're doing some really fancy stuff with calculations that carry their own checksums (and if you're that serious about error correction, you're probably using ECC regardless). Anyway, after completing the analysis, we found that memtest couldn't detect any problems, but that replacing the RAM on the bad machines caused a one to two order of magnitude reduction in error rate. Most services don't have this kind of checksumming we had; those services will simply silently write corrupt data to persistent storage and never notice problems until a customer complains.</p> <h2 id="3-due-to-advances-in-hardware-manufacturing-errors-are-very-rare">3. Due to advances in hardware manufacturing, errors are very rare</h2> <p>Jeff says</p> <blockquote> <p>I do seriously question whether ECC is as operationally critical as we have been led to believe [for servers], and I think the data shows modern, non-ECC RAM is already extremely reliable ... Modern commodity computer parts from reputable vendors are amazingly reliable. And their trends show from 2012 onward essential PC parts have gotten more reliable, not less. (I can also vouch for the improvement in SSD reliability as we have had zero server SSD failures in 3 years across our 12 servers with 24+ drives ...</p> </blockquote> <p>and quotes a study.</p> <p>The data in the post isn't sufficient to support this assertion. Note that since RAM usage has been increasing and continues to increase at a fast exponential rate, RAM failures would have to decrease at a greater exponential rate to actually reduce the incidence of data corruption. Furthermore, as chips continue shrink, features get smaller, making the kind of wearout issues discussed in “2” more common. For example, at 20nm, a DRAM capacitor might hold something like 50 electrons, and that number will get smaller for next generation DRAM and things continue to shrink.</p> <p>The <a href="http://selse.org//images/selse_2012/Papers/selse2012_submission_4.pdf">2012 study that Atwood quoted</a> has this graph on corrected errors (a subset of all errors) on ten randomly selected failing nodes (6% of nodes had at least one failure):</p> <p><img src="https://danluu.com/images/why-ecc/one_month_ecc_errors.png"></p> <p>We're talking between 10 and 10k errors for a typical node that has a failure, and that's a cherry-picked study from a post that's arguing that you don't need ECC. Note that the nodes here only have 16GB of RAM, which is an order of magnitude less than modern servers often have, and that this was on an older process node that was less vulnerable to noise than we are now. For anyone who's used to dealing with reliability issues and just wants to know the FIT rate, the study finds a FIT rate of between 0.057 and 0.071 faults per Mbit (which, contra Atwood's assertion, is not a shockingly low number). If you take the most optimistic FIT rate, .057, and do the calculation for a server without much RAM (here, I'm using 128GB, since the servers I see nowadays typically have between 128GB and 1.5TB of RAM)., you get an expected value of .057 * 1000 * 1000 * 8760 / 1000000000 = .5 faults per year per server. Note that this is for faults, not errors. From the graph above, we can see that a fault can easily cause hundreds or thousands of errors per month. Another thing to note is that there are multiple nodes that don't have errors at the start of the study but develop errors later on. So, in fact, the cherry-picked study that Jeff links contradicts Jeff's claim about reliability.</p> <p>Sun/Oracle famously ran into this a number of decades ago. Transistors and DRAM capacitors were getting smaller, much as they are now, and memory usage and caches were growing, much as they are now. Between having smaller transistors that were less resilient to transient upset as well as more difficult to manufacture, and having more on-chip cache, the vast majority of server vendors decided to add ECC to their caches. Sun decided to save a few dollars and skip the ECC. The direct result was that a number of Sun customers reported sporadic data corruption. It took Sun multiple years to spin a new architecture with ECC cache, and Sun made customers sign an NDA to get replacement chips. Of course there's no way to cover up this sort of thing forever, and when it came up, Sun's reputation for producing reliable servers took a permanent hit, much like the time they tried to <a href="https://danluu.com/anon-benchmark/">cover up poor performance results by introducing a clause into their terms of services disallowing benchmarking</a>.</p> <p>Another thing to note here is that when you're paying for ECC, you're not just paying for ECC, you're paying for parts (CPUs, boards) that have been qual'd more thoroughly. You can easily see this with disk failure rates, and I've seen many people observe this in their own private datasets. In terms of public data, I believe Andrea and Remzi's group had a SIGMETRICS paper a few years back that showed that SATA drives were 4x more likely than SCSI drives to have disk read failures, and 10x more likely to have silent data corruption. This relationship held true even with drives from the same manufacturer. There's no particular reason to think that the SCSI interface should be more reliable than the SATA interface, but it's not about the interface. It's about buying a high-reliability server part vs. a consumer part. Maybe you don't care about disk reliability in particular because you checksum everything and can easily detect disk corruption, but there are some kinds of corruption that are harder to detect.</p> <p>[2024 update, almost a decade later]: looking at this retrospectively, we can see that Jeff's assertion that commodity parts are reliable, "modern commodity computer parts from reputable vendors are amazingly reliable" is still not true. Looking at real-world user data from Firefox, <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@gabrielesvelto/112401643131904845">Gabriele Svelto estimated that approximately 10% to 20% of all Firefox crashes were due to memory corruption</a>. Various game companies that track this kind of thing also report a significant fraction of user crashes appear to be due to data corruption, although I don't have an estimate from any of those companies handy. A more direct argument is that if you talk to folks at big companies that run a lot of ECC memory and look at the rate of ECC errors, there are quite a few errors detected by ECC memory despite ECC memory typically having a lower error rate than random non-ECC memory. This kind of argument is frequently made (here, it was detailed above a decade ago, and when I looked at this when I worked at Twitter fairly recently and there has not been a revolution in memory technology that has reduced the need for ECC over the rates discussed in papers a decade ago), but it often doesn't resontate with folks who say things like "well, those bits probably didn't matter anyway", "most memory ends up not getting read", etc. Looking at real-world crashes and noting that the amount of silent data corruption should be expected to be much higher than the rate of crashes seems to resonate with people who aren't excited by looking at raw FIT rates in datacenters.</p> <h2 id="4-if-ecc-were-actually-important-it-would-be-used-everywhere-and-not-just-servers">4. If ECC were actually important, it would be used everywhere and not just servers.</h2> <p><a href="https://danluu.com/cocktail-ideas/">One way to rephrase this is as a kind of cocktail party efficient markets hypothesis. This can't be important, because if it was, we would have it</a>. Of course this is incorrect and there are many things that would be beneficial to consumers that we don't have, such as <a href="https://danluu.com/car-safety/">cars that are designed to safe instead of just getting the maximum score in crash tests</a>. Looking at this with respect to the server and consumer markets, this argument can be rephrased as “If this feature were actually important for servers, it would be used in non-servers”, which is incorrect. A primary driver of what's available in servers vs. non-servers is what can be added that buyers of servers will pay a lot for, to allow for price discrimination between server and non-server parts. This is actually one of the more obnoxious problems facing large cloud vendors — hardware vendors are able to jack up the price on parts that have server features because the features are much more valuable in server applications than in desktop applications. Most home users don't mind, giving hardware vendors a mechanism to extract more money out of people who buy servers while still providing cheap parts for consumers.</p> <p>Cloud vendors often have enough negotiating leverage to get parts at cost, but that only works where there's more than one viable vendor. Some of the few areas where there aren't any viable competitors include CPUs and GPUs. There have been a number of attempts by CPU vendors to get into the server market, but each attempt so far has been fatally flawed in a way that made it obvious from an early stage that the attempt was doomed (and these are often 5 year projects, so that's a lot of time to spend on a doomed project). The Qualcomm effort has been getting a lot of hype, but when I talk to folks I know at Qualcomm they all tell me that the current chip is basically for practice, since Qualcomm needed to learn how to build a server chip from all the folks they poached from IBM, and that the next chip is the first chip that has any hope of being competitive. I have high hopes for Qualcomm as well an ARM effort to build good server parts, but those efforts are still a ways away from bearing fruit.</p> <p>The near total unsuitability of current ARM (and POWER) options (not including hypothetical variants of Apple's impressive ARM chip) for most server workloads in terms of performance per TCO dollar is a bit of a tangent, so I'll leave that for another post, but the point is that Intel has the market power to make people pay extra for server features, and they do so. Additionally, some features are genuinely more important for servers than for mobile devices with a few GB of RAM and a power budget of a few watts that are expected to randomly crash and reboot periodically anyway.</p> <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2> <p>Should you buy ECC RAM? That depends. For servers, it's probably a good bet considering the cost, although it's hard to really do a cost/benefit analysis because it's really hard to figure out the cost of silent data corruption, or the cost of having some risk of burning half a year of developer time tracking down intermittent failures only to find that the were caused by using non-ECC memory.</p> <p>For normal desktop use, I'm pro-ECC, but if you don't have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/adoux/coding_horror_and_blogsstackoverflowcom/">regular backups</a> set up, doing backups probably has a better ROI than ECC. But once you have the absolute basics set up, there's a fairly strong case for ECC for consumer machines. For example, if you have backups without ECC, you can easily write corrupt data into your primary store and replicate that corrupt data into backup. But speaking more generally, big companies running datacenters are probably better set up to detect data corruption and more likely to have error correction at higher levels that allow them to recover from data corruption than consumers, so the case for consumers is arguably stronger than it is for servers, where the case is strong enough that's generally considered a no brainer. A major reason consumers don't generally use ECC isn't that it isn't worth it for them, it's that they just have no idea how to attribute crashes and data corruption when they happen. Once you start doing this, as Google and other large companies do, it's immediately obvious that ECC is worth the cost even when you have multiple levels of error correction operating at higher levels.</p> <h3 id="appendix-security">Appendix: security</h3> <p>If you allow any sort of code execution, even sandboxed execution, there are attacks <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Row_hammer">like rowhammer</a> which can allow users to cause data corruption and there have been instances where this has allowed for privilege escalation. ECC doesn't completely mitigate the attack, but it makes it much harder.</p> <p><small> Thanks to Prabhakar Ragde, Tom Murphy, Jay Weisskopf, Leah Hanson, Joe Wilder, and Ralph Corderoy for discussion/comments/corrections.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><h2>Decker</h2>

<p>Decker is a multimedia platform for creating and sharing interactive documents, with sound, images, hypertext, and scripted behavior. You can try it in your web browser <b><a href="https://www.beyondloom.com/decker/tour.html">right now</a></b>.</p>

</center>

<p>Decker builds on the legacy of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperCard">HyperCard</a> and the visual aesthetic of classic MacOS. It retains the simplicity and ease of learning that HyperCard provided, while adding many subtle and overt quality-of-life improvements, like deep undo history, support for scroll wheels and touchscreens, more modern keyboard navigation, and bulk editing operations.</p>

<p>Anyone can use Decker to create E-Zines, organize their notes, give presentations, build adventure games, or even just doodle some 1-bit pixel art. The holistic "ditherpunk" aesthetic is cozy, a bit nostalgic, and provides fun and distinctive creative constraints. As a prototyping tool, Decker encourages embracing a sketchy, imperfect approach. Finished decks can be saved as standalone <fixed>.html</fixed> documents which self-execute in a web browser and can be shared anywhere you can host or embed a web page. Decker also runs natively on MacOS, Windows, and Linux.</p>

<p>For more complex projects, Decker features a novel scripting language named <i>Lil</i> which is strongly influenced by both <a href="http://www.lua.org/">Lua</a>, an imperative language popular for embedding in tools and game engines, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_%28programming_language_from_Kx_Systems%29">Q</a>, a functional language in the APL family used with time-series databases. Lil is easy to learn and conventional enough not to ruffle any feathers for users with prior programming experience, but also includes pleasant surprises like implicit scalar-vector arithmetic and an integrated SQL-like query language. A few lines of Lil can go a long way.</p>

</center>

<p>Decker provides a small collection of built-in interactive widgets for building interfaces, as well as a facility for <a href="https://www.beyondloom.com/decker/decker.html#customwidgets">defining new ones</a>. Custom widgets and their definitions can be copied and pasted using the system clipboard, which also makes it possible to share them anywhere you can share or store text. Every deck is a toolkit of reusable parts that can be harvested and repurposed for another project.</p>

<center>
	<img src="https://www.beyondloom.com/decker/images/contrap.gif">
</center>

<p>Decker is command-line friendly: when built from source, it comes with <a href="https://www.beyondloom.com/decker/lilt.html">Lilt</a>, a standalone Lil interpreter which can (among other things) read, write, manipulate, and even execute Decker documents "headlessly". Lilt has even fewer dependencies than Decker itself, so it can also be compiled as a cross-platform <a href="https://justine.lol/ape.html">APE executable</a>, ready for writing run-anywhere shell scripts. Would you believe there's a Lil interpreter <a href="https://www.beyondloom.com/blog/lila.html">that runs on POSIX AWK</a>? Decks are stored in a line-oriented text format which interoperates well with existing source control tools like Git and SVN.</p>

<p>Decker includes no advertising, telemetry, gamification, or other intrusions on user privacy and autonomy. If you like Decker, please share it with other people who might enjoy it. Build something that makes you happy.</p>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Introduction to Granite Code Models</h2><a id="user-content-introduction-to-granite-code-models" aria-label="Permalink: Introduction to Granite Code Models" href="#introduction-to-granite-code-models"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">We introduce the Granite series of decoder-only code models for code generative tasks (e.g., fixing bugs, explaining code, documenting code), trained with code written in 116 programming languages. A comprehensive evaluation of the Granite Code model family on diverse tasks demonstrates that our models consistently reach state-of-the-art performance among available open-source code LLMs.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="auto">The key advantages of Granite Code models include:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>All-rounder Code LLM: Granite Code models achieve competitive or state-of-the-art performance on different kinds of code-related tasks, including code generation, explanation, fixing, editing, translation, and more. Demonstrating their ability to solve diverse coding tasks.</li>
<li>Trustworthy Enterprise-Grade LLM: All our models are trained on license-permissible data collected following <a href="https://www.ibm.com/impact/ai-ethics" rel="nofollow">IBM's AI Ethics principles</a> and guided by IBM’s Corporate Legal team for trustworthy enterprise usage. We release all our Granite Code models under an <a href="https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0" rel="nofollow">Apache 2.0 license</a> license for research and commercial use.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">The family of <strong>Granite Code Models</strong> comes in two main variants:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Granite Code Base Models: base foundational models designed for code-related tasks (e.g., code repair, code explanation, code synthesis).</li>
<li>Granite Code Instruct Models: instruction following models finetuned using a combination of Git commits paired with human instructions and open-source synthetically generated code instruction datasets.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Both base and instruct models are available in sizes of 3B, 8B, 20B, and 34B parameters.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Data Collection</h2><a id="user-content-data-collection" aria-label="Permalink: Data Collection" href="#data-collection"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Our process to prepare code pretraining data involves several stages. First, we collect a combination of publicly available datasets (e.g., GitHub Code Clean, Starcoder data), public code repositories, and issues from GitHub. Second, we filter the code data collected based on the programming language in which data is written (which we determined based on file extension). Then, we also filter out data with low code quality. Third, we adopt an aggressive deduplication strategy that includes both exact and fuzzy deduplication to remove documents having (near) identical code content. Finally, we apply a HAP content filter that reduces models' likelihood of generating hateful, abusive, or profane language. We also make sure to redact Personally Identifiable Information (PII) by replacing PII content (e.g., names, email addresses, keys, passwords) with corresponding tokens (e.g., ⟨NAME⟩, ⟨EMAIL⟩, ⟨KEY⟩, ⟨PASSWORD⟩). We also scan all datasets using ClamAV to identify and remove instances of malware in the source code. In addition to collecting code data for model training, we curate several publicly available high-quality natural language datasets for improving the model’s proficiency in language understanding and mathematical reasoning.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Pretraining</h2><a id="user-content-pretraining" aria-label="Permalink: Pretraining" href="#pretraining"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The <strong>Granite Code Base</strong> models are trained on 3-4T tokens of code data and natural language datasets related to code. Data is tokenized via byte pair encoding (BPE), employing the same tokenizer as StarCoder. We utilize high-quality data with two phases of training as follows:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Phase 1 (code only training): During phase 1, 3B and 8B models are trained for 4 trillion tokens of code data comprising 116 languages. The 20B parameter model is trained on 3 trillion tokens of code. The 34B model is trained on 1.4T tokens after the depth upscaling which is done on the 1.6T checkpoint of 20B model.</li>
<li>Phase 2 (code + language training): In phase 2, we include additional high-quality publicly available data from various domains, including technical, mathematics, and web documents, to further improve the model’s performance. We train all our models for 500B tokens (80% code-20% language mixture) in phase 2 training.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Instruction Tuning</h2><a id="user-content-instruction-tuning" aria-label="Permalink: Instruction Tuning" href="#instruction-tuning"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Granite Code Instruct models are finetuned on the following types of instruction data: 1) code commits sourced from <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/bigcode/commitpackft" rel="nofollow">CommitPackFT</a>, 2) high-quality math datasets, specifically we used <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/TIGER-Lab/MathInstruct" rel="nofollow">MathInstruct</a> and <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/meta-math/MetaMathQA" rel="nofollow">MetaMathQA</a>, 3) Code instruction datasets such as <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/glaiveai/glaive-code-assistant-v3" rel="nofollow">Glaive-Code-Assistant-v3</a>, <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/bigcode/self-oss-instruct-sc2-exec-filter-50k" rel="nofollow">Self-OSS-Instruct-SC2</a>, <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/glaiveai/glaive-function-calling-v2" rel="nofollow">Glaive-Function-Calling-v2</a>, <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/bugdaryan/sql-create-context-instruction" rel="nofollow">NL2SQL11</a> and a small collection of synthetic API calling datasets, and 4) high-quality language instruction datasets such as <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/HelpSteer" rel="nofollow">HelpSteer</a> and an open license-filtered version of <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/garage-bAInd/Open-Platypus" rel="nofollow">Platypus</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Evaluation Results</h2><a id="user-content-evaluation-results" aria-label="Permalink: Evaluation Results" href="#evaluation-results"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">We conduct an extensive evaluation of our code models on a comprehensive list of benchmarks that includes but is not limited to HumanEvalPack, MBPP, and MBPP+. This set of benchmarks encompasses different coding tasks across commonly used programming languages (e.g., Python, JavaScript, Java, Go, C++, Rust).</p>
<p dir="auto">Our findings reveal that Granite Code models outperform strong open-source models across model sizes. The figure below illustrates how <code>Granite-8B-Code-Base</code> outperforms <code>Mistral-7B</code>, <code>LLama-3-8B</code>, and other open-source models in three coding tasks. We provide further evaluation results in our paper.</p>

					<p>A vision during an LSD trip is what inspired Owsley “Bear” Stanley, the Grateful Dead’s sound engineer’s mammoth feat of technical engineering, “The Wall of Sound”, irreversibly changing live sound and engineering for the better.</p>
<p>It was a time when live sound problems plagued engineers, bands, and audiences equally. While rock concerts grew in size and scope throughout the 60s, audiences grew larger and louder, without the technical sophistication of amplification ever changing to meet this scenario. Screaming fans meant that low-wattage guitar amps could hardly be heard and without the help of monitoring systems, bands could barely hear themselves play. Things were so bad that the Beatles quit touring in 1966 because they couldn’t hear themselves over the audience. It was after this era that the band, the Grateful Dead, became obsessed with their sound, largely thanks to their eccentric and dedicated sound engineer. Though incredibly frustrated with the noisy, feedback-laden, underpowered situation, they did not want to give up playing live, and the Dead had Owsley on board to help solve the sound situation.</p>
<h4>Who was Bear Owsley?</h4>

<p>The famous story goes that in 1974 the Grateful Dead drummer Mickey Hart walked on stage to find Owsley “Bear Stanley standing in front of a wall of over 600 speakers with tears streaming down his face. Whispering to the huge mass of equipment, Bear said, “I love you and you love me- how could you fail me?” This story sums up Owsley’s obsession with sound, both as a concept and as a physical thing. A former ballet dancer and craftsman from Kentucky, Owsley was also jailed twice for manufacturing and distributing LSD, the profits of which he used to finance the Grateful Dead for some time. The band which formed in the San Fransico bay area during the hippie days of the mid-1960s boasted of a huge cult following. An engineering dropout, he met the Grateful Dead through Ken Kesey, during one of his infamous ‘acid test’ parties in 1965 and became friends with them.</p>
<p>Owsley, or ‘Bear’, as he became known, began to work with the band as their sound man and financed them with his earnings cooking acid. He was also the person who along with his good friend Bob Thomas, helped design the iconic lightning bolt logo, which would sell countless t-shirts. After a hallucinatory incident, where Owsley ‘saw’ the Grateful Dead’s sound, he became obsessed with aural perfection and started on an endless path, working with the band, to achieve it.</p>
<p>Keeping a sonic journal of each performance of the band, he would use it to improve on his setup and mix for each concert and highlight issues to the band members. He insisted on sound checks and encouraged them to listen to tapes of their performances, so that they could hear how they sounded, and also correct him on what he was doing. Rumored to have taken inspiration Buffalo Springfield’s monitoring setup, Owsley was not satisfied with the standard speakers and amplifiers that were available to him and began modifying and manufacturing his own audio gear with his apprentice Tim Scully, eventually founding the company Alembic.</p>
<p>In a 1969 meeting when brainstorming ideas for musical exploration and solutions for their technical problems and smoking ‘special’ cigarettes, Owsley proposed putting the P.A behind the band. This casual, stoned suggestion would change the way audio engineers thought about concert sound. This meant that the audience and the band would hear the same thing without any delays, chaotic reverb, colliding frequencies, and minimal-to-no feedback. Soon after this, Bear began his most ambitious design to date. He, Dan Healy and Mark Raizene of the Grateful Dead’s sound team collaborated with Ron Wickersham, Rick Turner and John Curl of Alembic to create the legendary Wall of sound.</p>
<h4>The Wall of Sound</h4>
<div id="attachment_2628"><p><img decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2628" src="https://audioacademy.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/grateful_dead_wall_of_sound_01-300x200.jpg" alt="wall of sound" width="476" height="317" srcset="https://audioacademy.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/grateful_dead_wall_of_sound_01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://audioacademy.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/grateful_dead_wall_of_sound_01-768x512.jpg 768w, https://audioacademy.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/grateful_dead_wall_of_sound_01.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 476px) 100vw, 476px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-2628">The Wall of Sound, 1973</p></div>
<p>The mammoth structure was massive, made up of over 600 hi-fidelity speakers that sat behind the band as they played. It used six separate sound systems which were able to isolate eleven separate channels with vocals, rhythm guitar, piano each having their own channel. Another channel each for the bass drum, snare, tom-toms, and cymbals. The bass was transmitted through a quadraphonic encoder, which took a signal from each string and projected it through its own set of speakers. The result of each speaker carrying only one instrument or voice at a time was crystal clear audio, free of intermodulation distortion.</p>
<p>The Wall of Sound served as its own monitoring system and solved many, if not all of the technical problems that sound engineers faced at that time. This design was also the first of its kind to eliminate the need for a sound guy, at least at the front of house. In addition to monitor controls, each of the microphones had volume dials. The idea was that each band member could adjust the sound in real time. The situation of the monitors gave the band the power to control their own sound. While the system had many trials and errors, the largest version stood three stories high and about 30 meters wide, the first line array system of this scale ever assembled. High-quality audio could be heard at 200 meters, with decent sound up to another 200 meters, at which point wind started to degrade the audio. The completed Wall of Sound made its debut in 1974.</p>
<p>Some of the early issues that surfaced was problems with feedback between the speakers and the singers’ rear-facing vocal microphones and the giant task of physically mounting the system. It was a logistical nightmare and almost made the band go bankrupt, because almost as soon as it rose the roof, it was time to pull it back down again. Eventually, the massive Wall of Sound had to be streamlined into a far more manageable and cost-effective touring rig. All the same, Owsley and the band’s willingness take ideas and execution to extreme lengths changed live sound forever.</p>
<h4>The Legacy of the Wall of Sound</h4>
<p>While parts of the wall were kept, repurposed and recycled for future touring rigs, other parts were sold off. Legend has it that friends of the Grateful Dead, Hot Tuna and Jefferson Starship quickly bought some of the highly sought-after top-of-the-range gear. While modern improvements in these technologies have the benefit of being far more powerful and lightweight than the Wall’s, in terms of experimental, unrestrained engineering, at a time where there was nothing like it ever heard, the Wall of Sound remains unparalleled.</p>

There are some, though, like us who really care and have been paying close attention.</p><p>At Mux we have not been shy about our fondness for web components over the last few years. It started with building Mux Player on our <a href="https://www.mux.com/blog/media-chrome-turns-1-0">web components-based player framework Media Chrome</a> (thanks for the <a href="https://twitter.com/jhooks/status/1785410152025543065">kind words about Media Chrome</a>, Joel).</p><p>But I want to drive home one point about our fondness for web components. It’s not about some righteous party line, which so many front-end tooling debates devolve into. If you came to this post for some juicy nerd drama, turn around because that’s not what we’re here for. <a href="https://www.mux.com/blog/slow-is-stable-stable-is-fast-building-mux-player-on-the-slow-platform-of-web-components">Our adoption of web components is purely based on practicality</a>. Nothing more, and nothing less. Is it the best tool for every job? Obviously not. But we believe it is the best tool for the job of building a framework-agnostic video player SDK. We still use React heavily. In fact, we were early adopters of <a href="https://www.mux.com/blog/what-are-react-server-components">React Server Components and wrote about it</a> in Darius’s widely circulated post.</p><h2 id="so-what-does-this-mean-for-react-actually"><a href="#so-what-does-this-mean-for-react-actually"><span><span><svg role="img" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="42" height="42" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 42 42"><title>Link</title><path d="m18.172 15.343 3.535-3.535a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 0l1.414 1.414a5 5 0 0 1 0 7.07l-3.535 3.536M23.828 26.657l-3.535 3.535a5 5 0 0 1-7.071 0l-1.414-1.414a5 5 0 0 1 0-7.07l3.535-3.536" vector-effect="non-scaling-stroke"></path><path stroke-linecap="round" d="m25.243 16.757-8.486 8.486" vector-effect="non-scaling-stroke"></path></svg></span></span>So what does this mean for React, actually?</a></h2><p>To contrast all the positives about building SDKs on web components, React support has been by far the biggest hurdle to clear for web components projects. Raw web components have always <strong>worked</strong> in React (it’s just HTML, after all), but the challenge was more about the ergonomics of using web components in a React world.</p><p>For example, React developers don't interact directly with HTML elements to do things like add event listeners and call functions. It sort of goes against the declarative nature of React itself.</p><p>So although setting up an event listener was possible, like this, it feels very un-React-y:</p><div><figure><figcaption><p>jsx</p></figcaption><pre><code><span></span><span>function</span> <span>MyComponent</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
<span></span>  <span>const</span> ref <span>=</span> <span>useRef</span><span>(</span><span>null</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span></span>  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>count<span>,</span> setCount<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span></span>
<span></span>  <span>useEffect</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
<span></span>    <span>function</span> <span>handleClick</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
<span></span>      <span>setCount</span><span>(</span>count <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span>
<span></span>    <span>}</span>
<span></span>    <span>if</span> <span>(</span>ref<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
<span></span>       ref<span>.</span><span>addEventListener</span><span>(</span><span>'click'</span><span>,</span> handleClick<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span></span>    <span>}</span>
<span></span>    <span>return</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
<span></span>      ref<span>.</span><span>removeEventListener</span><span>(</span><span>'click'</span><span>,</span> handleClick<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span></span>    <span>}</span>
<span></span>  <span>}</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span>ref<span>]</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span></span>
<span></span>  <span>return</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span>my-button</span> <span>ref</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>ref<span>}</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>Hello! </span><span>{</span>count<span>}</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>my-button</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span></span><span>}</span></code></pre></figure></div><p>Because of this, most maintainers (us included), have chosen to create React-specific wrappers. That works well, but it always felt like a stop-gap. Now that React 19 supports web components directly, you can do things like pass event listeners as React props and React props passed to the element get automatically set as properties on the element. There’s some extra complexity here for web component authors to handle attributes vs. properties. Not all web components will play nice with React from day 1, but at least we have a path forward.</p><p>See here, this feels much more React-y:</p><div><figure><figcaption><p>jsx</p></figcaption><pre><code><span></span><span>function</span> <span>MyComponent</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
<span></span>  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>count<span>,</span> setCount<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span></span>
<span></span>  <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
<span></span>    <span>&lt;</span>my<span>-</span>button
<span></span>      ref<span>=</span><span>{</span>ref<span>}</span>
<span></span>      onClick<span>{</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>setCount</span><span>(</span>count <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span><span>}</span>
<span></span>     <span>&gt;</span>
<span></span>       Hello<span>!</span> <span>{</span>count<span>}</span>
<span></span>     <span><span><span>&lt;/</span>my-button</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span></span>  <span>)</span>
<span></span><span>}</span></code></pre></figure></div><p>Internally, all React is doing here is taking the onClick prop and setting up/tearing down the click handler under the hood. Which is basically what React wrappers were doing anyway.</p><p>I’m hoping that in 1 or 2 short years from now your average React developer will not be weirded out or averse to using a web component in their React application. And once that feels normal perhaps we can thank those old React wrappers for bringing us joy and then do away with them.</p><h2 id="it-still-might-be-a-little-weird"><a href="#it-still-might-be-a-little-weird"><span><span><svg role="img" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="42" height="42" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 42 42"><title>Link</title><path d="m18.172 15.343 3.535-3.535a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 0l1.414 1.414a5 5 0 0 1 0 7.07l-3.535 3.536M23.828 26.657l-3.535 3.535a5 5 0 0 1-7.071 0l-1.414-1.414a5 5 0 0 1 0-7.07l3.535-3.536" vector-effect="non-scaling-stroke"></path><path stroke-linecap="round" d="m25.243 16.757-8.486 8.486" vector-effect="non-scaling-stroke"></path></svg></span></span>It still might be a little weird</a></h2><p>Event handlers and passing React props into web components is a nice improvement, but I think there’s still one weird thing about web components that doesn’t quite jive with the React way of doing things, and that’s the globally scoped element register.</p><p>In any React app, when you use a component, you have to import that component:</p><div><figure><figcaption><p>jsx</p></figcaption><pre><code><span></span><span>// when MyThing is a react component</span>
<span></span><span>import</span> MyThing <span>from</span> <span>'./components/my-thing'</span></code></pre></figure></div><p>But that doesn’t exist in the web components world (at least not yet). When you use &lt;my-button&gt; in a React component, you don’t have to explicitly import my-button from anywhere inside that file.</p><div><figure><figcaption><p>jsx</p></figcaption><pre><code><span></span><span>// when my-thing defines a web component is imported it gets registered globally</span>
<span></span><span>import</span> <span>'./components/my-thing'</span></code></pre></figure></div><p>Web components get imported and registered at the global level. This also means if two different libraries have a component called my-button, you can’t use both of them. This will certainly be a little weird for React developers to get used to. It also might change with <a href="https://github.com/WICG/webcomponents/blob/gh-pages/proposals/Scoped-Custom-Element-Registries.md">Scope Custom Element Registries in the future</a>.</p><h2 id="dont-sleep-on-web-awesome-either"><a href="#dont-sleep-on-web-awesome-either"><span><span><svg role="img" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="42" height="42" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 42 42"><title>Link</title><path d="m18.172 15.343 3.535-3.535a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 0l1.414 1.414a5 5 0 0 1 0 7.07l-3.535 3.536M23.828 26.657l-3.535 3.535a5 5 0 0 1-7.071 0l-1.414-1.414a5 5 0 0 1 0-7.07l3.535-3.536" vector-effect="non-scaling-stroke"></path><path stroke-linecap="round" d="m25.243 16.757-8.486 8.486" vector-effect="non-scaling-stroke"></path></svg></span></span>Don’t sleep on Web Awesome, either</a></h2><p>One other web components topic caught my eye last week. <a href="https://shoelace.style/">Shoelace</a>, one of the premier web components projects, launched a Kickstarter project for <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/fontawesome/web-awesome">Web Awesome</a> after being acquired by Font Awesome. With a modest goal of $30,000, the campaign gained the pledges of <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/fontawesome/web-awesome">6,725 backers for a total of $723,004</a>, nearly 25x the original goal. And I don’t think that’s all hype – I think there’s a reliable signal here that developers want a stable set of tools, built on browser standards.</p><h2 id="lets-see-how-things-pan-out"><a href="#lets-see-how-things-pan-out"><span><span><svg role="img" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="42" height="42" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 42 42"><title>Link</title><path d="m18.172 15.343 3.535-3.535a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 0l1.414 1.414a5 5 0 0 1 0 7.07l-3.535 3.536M23.828 26.657l-3.535 3.535a5 5 0 0 1-7.071 0l-1.414-1.414a5 5 0 0 1 0-7.07l3.535-3.536" vector-effect="non-scaling-stroke"></path><path stroke-linecap="round" d="m25.243 16.757-8.486 8.486" vector-effect="non-scaling-stroke"></path></svg></span></span>Let’s see how things pan out</a></h2><p>That’s all for now, we’ll see how things pan out. I, for one, am happy to see the React ecosystem moving in this direction. And I believe the general frontend ecosystem is criminally under-indexed on web components. All web application developers can benefit by moving parts of their applications away from framework-specific patterns and more towards browser-level standards. Frameworks will come and go, so as developers and maintainers we build against them at our own risk. Browser standards tend to come, albeit slowly, and then rarely disappear after that.</p><p>Right now the plan is to wait and see. In the short term, we’ll keep maintaining our React wrappers. It’s all going to depend on if React developers, as a general population, start embracing web components and start feeling comfortable using them in their applications. We want our component libraries to feel great and idiomatic wherever they’re used…and we hope one day soon that could just mean web components.</p></div><div><h2>Leave your wallet <br>where it is</h2><p>No credit card required to get started.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><header></header><p>Take a look at this:</p>
<div><figure><img src="https://zed.dev/img/post/zed-decoded-linux-when/linux_screenshot_1.png" alt="Screenshot of Zed — but where are the red/yellow/green window controls?"><figcaption>Screenshot of Zed — but where are the red/yellow/green window controls?</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>Does anything stick out? Yes, exactly, it's a screenshot of Zed running <em>on Linux</em>!</p>
<p>Wait, what? Zed on Linux? Is it released yet? No, it's not, but it's taking shape, fast.</p>
<p>At the end of January <a href="https://zed.dev/blog/zed-is-now-open-source">we open-sourced Zed</a> and had zero Linux support. Now, three months later, you can <a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/blob/main/docs/src/development/linux.md">compile &amp; run</a> Zed on Linux and actually use it. And I mean <em>really</em> use it — I've worked in Zed (on Zed!) the whole last week without any problems.</p>
<p>The words "alpha release" seem to appear at the end of the tunnel. We're getting closer.</p>
<p>Today we're going to talk about how Zed on Linux took shape, what the challenges were, who did the work, and what's still left to do.</p>
<!-- -->
<div><div><p><b>Companion Video</b>: <!-- -->Linux when?</p><p>This post comes with a 1hr companion video, in which Thorsten and Mikayla explore Zed on Linux, dig through the codebase to see how it's implemented, talk about implementation challenges, and how the open-source community helped out big time.</p><p>Watch the video here:<!-- --> <a href="https://youtu.be/O5XVVnA2LoY">https://youtu.be/O5XVVnA2LoY</a></p></div><p><img src="https://zed.dev/img/post/zed-decoded-linux-when/thumbnail.jpg" width="230" height="150"></p></div>
<h2 id="why-not-linux-from-the-start-or-the-tricky-thing-about-platforms"><span data-br=":R97brrrqbf9la:" data-brr="1">Why not Linux from the start? Or: the Tricky Thing About Platforms</span></h2>
<p>Why didn't Zed work on Linux out of the box? That's not an unreasonable thing to ask and many of you did. After all, Zed's written in Rust, a language that's known for its cross-platform support. So if Rust programs can run on macOS, Linux, and Windows, why didn't Zed?</p>
<p>The tricky thing about cross-platform support is that — in general and in Rust — it only works as long as you're fine with the platform being abstracted away, hidden behind an API that is the same on every platform.</p>
<p>At Zed, though, we want to use each platform as best as we can to build a high-performance application that is and <em>feels</em> native to the platform. That often means talking directly to the platform, in order to use it to the best of its abilities.</p>
<p>On macOS, for example, Zed makes direct use of <a href="https://developer.apple.com/metal/">Metal</a>. We have our <a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/blob/main/crates/gpui/src/platform/mac/shaders.metal">own shaders</a>, our <a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/blob/593f0e0c3ef08da7e528230867526dcb77e723fa/crates/gpui/src/platform/mac/metal_renderer.rs">own renderer</a>, and we put <a href="https://zed.dev/blog/120fps">a lot of effort into understanding macOS APIs to get to 120FPS</a>. Zed on macOS <a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/blob/98ea5e172ec114004116f996f51b46cdf5c438e4/crates/gpui/src/platform/mac/platform.rs#L66">is also a fully-native AppKit NSApplication</a> and we integrated <a href="https://zed.dev/blog/zed-decoded-async-rust">our async Rust runtime with macOS' native application runtime</a>.</p>
<p>If you want your application to have this level of depth and control over its platform integration <em>and</em> have it be cross-platform, what you'll need to build is a framework. A framework that allows you to talk directly to the platform whenever you need, but otherwise abstract it away from you so you don't have to worry about it when you write application-level code.</p>
<p>That's what Zed did. The framework is called <a href="https://www.gpui.rs/">GPUI</a> and when we released it as open-source, along with Zed, it came with cross-platform support. Except not really.</p>
<h2 id="gpuis-cross-platform-support"><span data-br=":Rg7brrrqbf9la:" data-brr="1">GPUI's cross platform support</span></h2>
<p>GPUI does abstract away the underlying platform and assumes there's more in the world than macOS. Here are parts of <a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/blob/98ea5e172ec114004116f996f51b46cdf5c438e4/crates/gpui/src/platform.rs#L95-L162">GPUI's <code>Platform</code> trait</a>, which is all a GPUI application has to interact with:</p>

<p>This <code>Platform</code> offers nearly everything an application might want to do: execute work on different threads, start/stop the application, manage windows, open URLs, open system dialogues to open files and directories, cursor style, clipboard, credentials, ... and a few more things that I left out to keep this succinct.</p>
<p>From the start, GPUI has had this <code>Platform</code> abstraction built-in. GPUI never was macOS-only. It was always platform-agnostic, as long as the <code>Platform</code> trait is implemented for the platform.</p>
<p>And that's essentially what it meant to get Zed running on Linux: implement <code>Platform</code> for Linux.</p>
<p>So, just implemented a bunch of methods and then Zed works on any platform? Well... yes, kind of.</p>
<p>Here's what the Linux <code>Platform</code> implementation <a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/blob/266988adea954cd759525cc7222e261536c25fd1/crates/gpui/src/platform/linux/platform.rs#L99-L281">looked like in the middle of February</a>. Again, in excerpts:</p>

<p>Some methods implemented, some marked with <code>todo!</code>, others panicking with an <code>unimplemented!()</code>. Back in February this file had 11 <code>todo!</code> comments and 9 calls to <code>unimplemented</code>.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/blob/593f0e0c3ef08da7e528230867526dcb77e723fa/crates/gpui/src/platform/linux/platform.rs#L99-L281">Now</a> it has 9 <code>todo!</code>s (different ones) and the word <code>unimplemented</code> in a string.</p>
<p>So, yes, the work was getting rid of the <code>todo!</code>s and implementing the missing methods. But we all know: not all methods are created equal.</p>
<p>While a <code>write_to_clipboard</code> method seems relatively straightforward to implement, things weren't as easy as the lower-case <code>todo!</code> and its defiantly cute exclamation mark might suggest.</p>
<h2 id="which-linux-are-you-talking-about"><span data-br=":Rt7brrrqbf9la:" data-brr="1">Which Linux are you talking about?</span></h2>
<p>A big challenge when building a GUI application for Linux is that there is no such thing as Linux, really. Linux is a kernel and when you install and run it, you're mostly likely doing that through a Linux distribution that gives you the rest of the operating system too: Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, Arch, Gentoo, and so on.</p>
<p>They nearly all differ in some aspects that are relevant for an application developer. Example: package management. Distributions not only have their own format with which to distribute applications, but they also have different ways of managing dependencies. And there's no standard across distributions (but of course there are <a href="https://xkcd.com/927/">competing standards</a>). So far, with Zed, we've avoided the whole packaging topic and just focused on building <code>.tar.gz</code> archives that others can then turn into distribution-specific packages. But just scrolling through <a href="https://pkgs.tailscale.com/stable">Tailscale's Packages site</a> tells us that there's a lot of work to do that we never had to do for macOS.</p>
<p>But even if you focus on only one distribution, say Ubuntu, you still have to decide: do you support X11 or Wayland? Both are — ignoring some technical details (don't send me angry letters) — display servers with which Linux software can draw things on the screen. X11 has been around for a long, long time and Wayland has been trying to replace it, also for a long, long time. That, in turn, makes the question a trick question: you have to support both. They're both widely used. <em>Still used</em> in the case of X11 and <em>gaining users</em> in the case of Wayland, but it's not realistic that 100% of Linux users will be on Wayland anytime soon.</p>
<p>After deciding to support Ubuntu and X11 and Wayland, the next question is: which desktop environment or window manager are you going to support? KDE or GNOME? Qt or GTK? What about tiling window managers and users that want to turn window decorations off? Which <em>audio server</em> are you going to support to get audio calls working? PipeWire? Or still PulseAudio? Do you even have to worry about that or is that choice dictated by the desktop environment you chose?</p>
<p>I could probably go on and find more "actually, there's more than one of X" to list, but you get the point: when building a graphical application to run on Linux, you have to make quite a few technical decisions about which platform combinations to target and how.</p>
<p>And we haven't even touched on the most fundamental of all of these decisions yet: how do we render Zed?</p>
<h2 id="from-metal-to-what"><span data-br=":R147brrrqbf9la:" data-brr="1">From Metal to... what?</span></h2>
<p>Even if you knew how to package your application, and how to target X11 and/or Wayland, and managed to open an application window in them — how do you draw your application in that window?</p>
<p>You might have missed it, but in the <code>Platform</code> trait above, there's a method to open a new window:</p>
<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><div><pre tabindex="0" data-language="rust" data-theme="light-plus"><code data-language="rust" data-theme="light-plus"><span data-line=""><span>// crates/gpui/src/platform.rs</span></span>

<span data-line=""><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div></figure>
<p>In order to implement that, you also have to implement the interface of the thing it returns: <code>PlatformWindow</code>. And that packs a punch.</p>
<p>As of right now, <a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/blob/98ea5e172ec114004116f996f51b46cdf5c438e4/crates/gpui/src/platform.rs#L189-L241"><code>PlatformWindow</code> requires 37 methods</a> to be implemented. The methods range from hooks (<code>on_close</code>, <code>on_fullscreen</code>) to attributes (<code>is_fullscreen</code>, <code>is_minimized</code>) to bread-and-butter (<code>content_size</code>, <code>mouse_position</code>, <code>toggle_fullscreen</code>) to tricky (<code>scale_factor</code>, <code>appearance</code>).</p>
<p>But there's one method on <code>PlatformWindow</code> that's the most fundamental of them all: <code>draw</code>. Another name for it could be <code>where_the_rubber_hits_the_road</code>. Here is its implementation for macOS:</p>

<span data-line=""><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div></figure>
<p>It doesn't look imposing, but it is: <code>Scene</code> is the result of GPUI rendering a frame and this method, <code>draw</code>, is what makes it appear on the screen.</p>
<p>A <code>Scene</code> is the visible parts of the application —&nbsp;text, windows, borders, rectangles, underlines, and so on — turned into data, <em>primitives</em>.

<p>Shadows, quads, paths, underlines, sprites — that's what GPUI boils your application down to when a frame is rendered. And then, in <code>draw</code>, it hands that data over to the renderer.</p>
<p>And the renderer — that's your GPU.</p>
<p>As I mentioned above: on macOS we use the Metal APIs to talk to the GPU and when you follow the definitions there, you'll end up at <a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/blob/98ea5e172ec114004116f996f51b46cdf5c438e4/crates/gpui/src/platform/mac/metal_renderer.rs#L238">a <code>fn draw</code>, implemented on <code>MetalRenderer</code></a>, that contains nearly the complete saga as told in our <a href="https://zed.dev/blog/120fps">120FPS</a> blog post: setting up a rendering pipeline, triple-buffering, syncing up with the OS and the display, all of that.</p>
<p>So how do we implement <code>draw</code> on Linux, without Metal? How do we talk to the GPU on Linux?</p>
<h2 id="enter-stage-the-open-source-hackers"><span data-br=":R1j7brrrqbf9la:" data-brr="1">Enter stage: the open-source hackers</span></h2>
<p>Less than two weeks after Zed going open-source, flying through the cloud of pull requests and issues that's been stirred up by all the excitement comes <a href="https://github.com/kvark">@kvark</a> (Dzmitry Malyshau) with a by now <a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/pull/7343">legendary PR</a> that makes Zed render on Linux. In less than four thousand lines of code. Sure, it didn't render all of Zed yet, but: wow.</p>
<div><figure><img src="https://zed.dev/img/post/zed-decoded-linux-when/kvark_pull_request.png" alt="Screenshot of kvark's pull request that made Zed render on Linux"><figcaption>Screenshot of kvark's pull request that made Zed render on Linux</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>The PR answers the question of how to talk to the GPU on Linux: with <a href="https://github.com/kvark/blade">blade</a>, kvark's "rendering solution for Rust", that offers a "lean low-level GPU abstraction focused at ergonomics and fun". Blade uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulkan">Vulkan</a> under the hood, a graphics API that's similar to Metal in the level of abstraction it offers, to talk to the GPU and render Zed.</p>
<p>After @kvark opened the PR, Mikayla, Antonio, and Nathan reached out to him to talk about the feasibility of using Blade in Zed and shared goals. It didn't take long to get to a shared understanding and, exactly two weeks after open-sourcing Zed, the PR that made it compile and run on Linux was merged.</p>
<p>With that big TODO and question out of the way, the community jumped on the chance to remove the remaining <code>todo!</code>s: <a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Awitelokk">@witelokk added support for Wayland</a>, <a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+linux+author%3Akvark">@kvark continued his work on getting all of Zed to render smoothly</a>, <a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/pull/7852">@romgrk added support for file dialogues</a>, <a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/pull/9103">@apricobucket28 fixed scrolling and selections</a> and many others <a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+in%3Atitle+linux">contributed and fixed a lot of other things</a>, with Mikayla diligently reviewing, coding, managing, leading and keeping an eye on everything.</p>
<p>This list of contributions is incomplete and I'm sure I should've mentioned more people, but the point I want to make is this: Zed on Linux was and is an impressive open-source team effort that surprised all of us at Zed with how fast it got Zed to a working state.</p>

<p>And there are two implementations of <code>LinuxClient</code>:</p>

</ul>
<p>But both of them use Blade in their <code>draw</code> method:</p>

<span data-line=""><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div></figure>
<p>That means the rubber hits the road through these layers of abstractions:</p>
<ul>
<li>GPUI asks the <code>Platform</code> to open a window</li>
<li>The Wayland <code>LinuxClient</code> uses Wayland to open a window, the X11 client uses X11</li>
<li>When rendering a frame, GPUI turns the application into a <code>Scene</code></li>
<li>It then calls the <code>PlatformWindow</code> to <code>draw</code> that <code>Scene</code></li>
<li>Both the Wayland and the X11 implementations use Blade, which uses Vulkan, to talk to the GPU, to draw the <code>Scene</code></li>
</ul>
<p>That's obviously only scratching the surface. There are a lot more interesting things going in the Linux implementation — did you know that there's multiple clipboards on Linux but only one on macOS? Or here, take a look at this:</p>
<div><figure><img src="https://zed.dev/img/post/zed-decoded-linux-when/linux_screenshot_2.png" alt="Screenshot of Zed on Linux, including a native file dialog"><figcaption>Screenshot of Zed on Linux, including a native file dialog</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>Yup, that's a native file dialog, but we don't use GTK in Zed and that clearly is GTK — so, how does that work? You'll find the answer in <a href="https://youtu.be/O5XVVnA2LoY">the companion video</a> in which Mikayla and I dive deeper into this and also touch on the question of whether or not we should use GTK or Qt or something else (spoiler: it's complicated).</p>
<h2 id="so-linux-when"><span data-br=":R2b7brrrqbf9la:" data-brr="1">So, Linux when?</span></h2>
<p>So what's left to do for Linux? In order to get to an alpha release: <em>not that much</em>, but don't quote me on that. Essentially: fix 86 remaining <code>todo!</code>s of various difficulty levels, get window resizing/moving to work on Wayland, and implement system dialogues for GPUI. We're close, very close.</p>
<p>After the alpha, we'll need to add support for audio calls, drag &amp; drop, storing of credentials, make sure the performance is consistently high, increase stability, and so on. Take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/issues/7015">Linux Roadmap</a> tracking issue.</p>
<p>Even though there might still be a lot to do (I don't even want to know how complicated drag &amp; drop can be on Linux— I mean, GNOM— I mean, KDE, no, I mea—) and a lot of unknown unknowns and surprises along the way, one thing's for sure: the fact that we got to the current state of Zed on Linux in three months, with that many high-quality open-source contributions, is pretty amazing.</p>
<p>Want to try out Zed on Linux? You need Rust, some dependencies, and depending on your patience enough CPU and memory to compile it in a reasonable amount of time. Take a look at <a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/blob/main/docs/src/development/linux.md">these instructions</a>. Have fun!</p><hr></article></div></div>]]></description>

It also has a timing problem: Solar power is plentiful during the day but disappears by evening, just as people get home from work and electricity demand spikes. To fill the gap, power companies typically burn more fossil fuels like natural gas.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->That’s now changing. Since 2020, California has installed more giant batteries than anywhere in the world apart from China. They can soak up excess solar power during the day and store it for use when it gets dark.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Those batteries play a pivotal role in California’s electric grid, partially replacing fossil fuels in the evening. Between 7 p.m. and 10 p.m. on April 30, for example, <a href="https://www.gridstatus.io/live/caiso?date=2024-04-30">batteries supplied more than one-fifth of California’s electricity</a> and, for a few minutes, pumped out 7,046 megawatts of electricity, akin to the output from seven large nuclear reactors.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Across the country, power companies are increasingly using giant batteries the size of shipping containers to address renewable energy’s biggest weakness: the fact that the wind and sun aren’t always available.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->“What’s happening in California is a glimpse of what could happen to other grids in the future,” said Helen Kou, head of U.S. power analysis at BloombergNEF, a research firm. “Batteries are quickly moving from these niche applications to shifting large amounts of renewable energy toward peak demand periods.”<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Over the past three years, battery storage capacity on the nation’s grids has grown tenfold, to 16,000 megawatts. This year, <a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=61202">it is expected to nearly double</a> again, with the biggest growth in Texas, California and Arizona.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><figure role="group" aria-label="graphic"><div><p><h3><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><span>Battery Storage Plants</span> Across the <span>United States</span><span>U.S.</span><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></h3>  </p></div>   <div> <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Source: U.S. Energy Information Administration<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Note: Each circle represents a facility that has at least one battery as of March 2024.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->By The New York Times<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> </div> </figure><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Most grid batteries use lithium-ion technology, similar to batteries in smartphones or electric cars. As the electric vehicle industry has expanded over the past decade, battery costs have fallen by 80 percent, making them competitive for large-scale power storage. Government mandates and subsidies have also spurred growth.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->As batteries have proliferated, power companies are using them in novel ways, such as handling big swings in electricity generation from solar and wind farms, reducing congestion on transmission lines and helping to prevent blackouts during scorching heat waves.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->In California, which has set ambitious goals for fighting climate change, policymakers hope grid batteries can help the state get 100 percent of its electricity from carbon-free sources by 2045. While the state remains heavily dependent on natural gas, a significant contributor to global warming, batteries are starting to eat into the market for fossil fuels. State regulators plan <a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/california-puc-carbon-preferred-system-plan-irp-caiso/707876/">to nearly triple battery capacity</a> by 2035.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->“The future is bright for energy storage,” said Andrés Gluski, chief executive of AES Corporation, one of the world’s largest power companies. “If you want more renewables on the grid, you need more batteries. It’s not going to work otherwise.”<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><h2><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->How Batteries Work on the Grid Today<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></h2> </p><figure role="group" aria-label="image">   <div><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->A battery storage facility under construction in Menifee, Calif., in March.

Many battery operators still earn most of their revenue by providing these <a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=50176">“ancillary services.”</a><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->But power companies also use batteries to engage in a type of trading: charging up when electricity is plentiful and cheap and then selling power to the grid when electricity supplies are tighter and more expensive.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->In California power prices often crash around midday, when the state produces more solar power than it needs, especially in the spring when air-conditioning use is low. Prices then soar in the evening when solar disappears and grid operators have to increase output from gas plants or hydroelectric dams to compensate.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><figure role="group" aria-label="graphic">   <div> <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Sources: California Independent System Operator via <a href="http://gridstatus.io/">Grid Status</a><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->By The New York Times<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> </div> </figure><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->California now has <a href="https://www.energy.ca.gov/data-reports/energy-almanac/california-electricity-data/california-energy-storage-system-survey">10,000 megawatts of battery capacity on the grid</a>, enough to power 10 million homes for a few hours. Those batteries are “able to very effectively manage that evening ramp where solar is going down and customer demand is increasing,” said John Phipps, executive director of grid operations for the California Independent System Operator, which oversees the state’s grid.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Batteries can also help California’s grid handle stresses from heat waves and wildfires, Mr. Phipps said. “It made some differences last summer,” he said. “We were able to meet high load days and wildfire days when we might lose some power lines.”<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->In Texas, batteries are still largely used to provide ancillary services, stabilizing the grid against unexpected disruptions. Texas is also more reliant than California on wind energy, which fluctuates in less-predictable patterns.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->But Texas is quickly catching up to California in solar power, and batteries increasingly help with evening peaks. On April 28, the sun was setting just as wind power was unexpectedly low and many coal and gas plants were offline for repairs. Batteries jumped in, <a href="https://www.gridstatus.io/live/ercot?date=2024-04-28">supplying 4 percent of Texas’s electricity at one point</a>, enough to power a million homes. Last summer, batteries <a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/energy/article/ercot-grid-battery-solar-enel-texas-18350609.php">helped avert evening blackouts</a> by providing additional power during record heat.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><figure role="group" aria-label="graphic">   <div> <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Sources: Electric Reliability Council of Texas via <a href="http://gridstatus.io/">Grid Status</a><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->By The New York Times<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> </div> </figure><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The two states built their battery fleets in distinct ways. In California, government mandates were the impetus: In 2019, regulators worried that too many older gas plants were closing, risking blackouts, and ordered utilities to quickly install thousands of megawatts of storage.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->In Texas, market forces dominate. The state’s deregulated electricity system allows prices to fluctuate sharply, rising as high as $5,000 per megawatt-hour during acute shortages. That makes it lucrative for battery developers to take advantage of spikes, such as in locations where power lines periodically get clogged.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->“Anywhere we think the market is going to get tight, you can put batteries in and even things out,” said Stephanie Smith, chief operating officer of Eolian, a battery developer. “Then, we’re making bets all day about when to charge and discharge.”<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->One battery, for instance, sits near Fort Worth, absorbing excess wind power from West Texas during the nighttime, when no one needs it, and feeding it into the grid when demand surges.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Other states are following. In Arizona and Georgia, utilities plan to install thousands of megawatts of battery capacity to help manage rising demand from data centers and factories. It helps that batteries can be deployed quickly, said Aaron Mitchell, vice president of planning and pricing at Georgia Power.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The industry still faces obstacles, however. Lithium-ion batteries are flammable, and while operators have taken steps to reduce fire risk, some communities <a href="https://thecoastnews.com/residents-remain-opposed-to-seguro-battery-facility-despite-changes/">oppose projects in their backyards</a>. Most batteries still come from China, making them vulnerable to trade disputes. In Texas, a state fund <a href="https://www.expressnews.com/business/article/texas-energy-fund-loan-program-ercot-19361692.php">to subsidize gas plants</a> could undercut the battery boom. In other states, complex regulations <a href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2023/10/02/battery-storage-seen-as-backbone-of-reliable-electric-grid-but-adoption-uneven-across-us/">sometimes prevent utilities from adding energy storage</a>.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->“Because these storage resources are so new, the rules are still catching up,” said Natalie McIntire, who works on grid issues for the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><h2><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Can Grid Batteries Help Fight Climate Change?<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></h2> </p><figure role="group" aria-label="image">   <div><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Wind turbines near Sweetwater, Texas. Nationwide, battery storage is being used to address renewable energy’s biggest weakness: the fact that the wind and sun aren’t always available.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>   <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Tamir Kalifa for The New York Times<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> </div> </figure><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Grid batteries could be a useful tool to slash planet-warming emissions, experts say, though they still need further advances in terms of costs, technologies and how they are used.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->In Texas, many batteries today are actually increasing carbon-dioxide emissions, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/location-tierra-climate/?trackingId=6ggknGE9JAqIEEZZnv6epQ%3D%3D">according to one analysis</a>. That’s because operators focus on maximizing revenue and sometimes charge with coal or gas power.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->“These batteries have an immense capability to abate carbon, but they need the right incentives to do so,” said Emma Konet, co-founder of <a href="https://www.tierraclimate.com/about">Tierra Climate</a>, a startup working to help batteries earn money for reducing emissions.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->In California, by contrast, batteries appear to be cutting emissions from fossil fuels. The state’s gas use in April <a href="https://twitter.com/grid_status/status/1785399291671924856">fell to a seven-year low</a>. “We have reached the conclusion that batteries are displacing natural gas when solar generation is ramping up and down each day,” said Max Kanter, chief executive of Grid Status, an electricity data tracking firm.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Yet California still gets roughly 40 percent of its electricity from natural gas, and it could be difficult for current battery technology to replace all of that. One <a href="https://about.bnef.com/blog/how-pv-plus-storage-will-compete-with-gas-generation-in-the-u-s/">analysis from BloombergNEF</a> found that solar and batteries can be a cost-effective alternative to smaller gas “peaker” plants that only switch on when demand spikes. But batteries remain too costly to replace many of the larger gas-burning plants that provide steadier power day and night.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->“You don’t want to necessarily build a system where you’ve got batteries to suck up every last megawatt-hour, because that’s a pretty expensive system,” said Meredith Fowlie, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Today’s lithium-ion batteries can only deliver power for two to four hours before needing to recharge. If costs keep falling, battery companies <a href="https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy23osti/85878.pdf">might be able to extend that to eight or ten hours</a> (it’s a matter of adding more battery packs) but it may not be economical to go far beyond that, said Nate Blair, an energy storage expert at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->That means additional long-duration storage technologies could be needed. If California wants to rely largely on renewable energy, it will have to handle <a href="https://www.pnnl.gov/news-media/energy-droughts-wind-and-solar-can-last-nearly-week-research-shows">weeklong periods where there’s no wind and little sun</a>. Another challenge: There’s far more solar power available in summer than in winter, and no battery today can store electricity for months to manage those seasonal disparities.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Some companies are exploring solutions.

<p>If you’ve ever tried to “future-proof” a purchase by paying for everything you might eventually need up front, you know it can be a sucker’s game. The problem? <em>We can’t actually see the future.</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>But today we got our hands on LPCAMM2 for the first time, and this looks like the future to us. LPCAMM2 is a totally modular, repairable, upgradeable memory standard for laptops, using the latest LPDDR chips for maximum speed and efficiency. So instead of overpaying (or under-speccing) based on guesswork about your future memory needs, you’ll hopefully be able to buy your next laptop and then install more RAM as needed. Imagine that!</p>



<figure><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="1922" height="1081" src="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/05/06213451/newmicronram-in-use.jpg" alt="The Micron LPCAMM2 module disassembled next to iFixit tools and laptop parts" srcset="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/05/06213451/newmicronram-in-use.jpg 1922w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/05/06213451/newmicronram-in-use-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/05/06213451/newmicronram-in-use-1600x900.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1922px) 100vw, 1922px"></figure>



<p>We say “hopefully” because the <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Device/Lenovo_ThinkPad_P1_Gen_7">laptop</a> on our teardown table today is the first of its kind, thanks to a collaboration between <a href="https://www.micron.com/about/blog/memory/dram/lpcamm2-no-compromise-for-next-gen-laptops">Micron</a> and <a href="https://news.lenovo.com/pressroom/press-releases/lenovo-unveils-its-new-ai-ready-thinkpad-p1-gen-7-mobile-workstation/">Lenovo</a>—and it remains to be seen how many other big laptop makers will adopt LPCAMM2 technology. But judging by the results of our initial hands-on, the writing is on the wall for laptops with soldered-down, non-serviceable memory.</p>



<h2><strong>What is LPDDR, and why do manufacturers solder it down?</strong></h2>



<p>Repairable, upgradeable RAM isn’t exactly a new idea. As anyone who has ever built a PC knows, we’ve had swappable DDR RAM sticks (also known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIMM#SO-DIMM">DIMMs</a>, or <em>Dual In-Line Memory Modules</em>) since basically forever. From old Gateway towers to today’s gaming powerhouses to zillion-dollar industrial servers, upgradeable and replaceable RAM is still very much a thing. And for many years, the same was true of laptops, which used a slightly more compact (“Small-Outline” DIMM, or <em>SO-DIMM</em>) version of those same RAM sticks.</p>



<p>More recently though, we’ve seen increasing adoption of <em>LPDDR</em>—a <em>low-power</em> flavor of RAM (hence the “LP”) developed for mobile devices like phones and tablets. Whereas conventional DDR RAM excels at performance applications where power consumption isn’t a primary concern, like video editing or gaming, LPDDR wins the day when it comes to efficiency—<em>a.k.a. battery life</em>. And so for laptops in particular, the benefits of LPDDR are hard to beat.</p>



<div><p>The drawback of LPDDR, though, is that it has to be soldered to the main board in close proximity to the processor—making repairs and upgrades completely impractical. But why?</p><p>LPDDR operates at lower voltages compared to DDR, giving it the edge in power efficiency. But, the lower voltage makes signal integrity between the memory and processor challenging, requiring tighter tolerances and shorter trace distances—that is, the farther the signal has to travel, the more voltage you need for a reliable signal. This is why LPDDR is soldered down as close to the processor as possible.</p></div>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="1922" height="1081" src="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/05/06215652/soldered.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/05/06215652/soldered.jpg 1922w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/05/06215652/soldered-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/05/06215652/soldered-1600x900.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1922px) 100vw, 1922px"><figcaption>Historically, LPDDR chips (left) had to be soldered very close to the main processor (right).</figcaption></figure>



<p>In short, laptop makers and consumers alike have faced an unfortunate dilemma: conventional SO-DIMM RAM for serviceability and upgradeability, or soldered LPDDR chips for longer battery life.</p>



<p>Today, that changes.</p>



<h2><strong>Enter LPCAMM2&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Standing for “Low-Power Compression-Attached Memory Module,” the new tech is as the name suggests: LPDDR chips on a compact board that screws in place very close to a laptop’s CPU. Combining the efficiency and speed of LPDDR with a thin, lightweight, upgradeable design and a trick interface that gets everything up close and personal with the CPU, LPCAMM2 seemingly does it all. And with dual-channel performance already baked in, a single LPCAMM2 module can do the job of a pair of the old socketed SO-DIMM sticks with a much smaller footprint and better thermals to boot. Finally: modular, performant, power-efficient laptop memory for the masses.</p>

<p>Even though LPCAMM2 is arriving initially from Micron, in a Lenovo product, the technology owes its existence to an alliance of tech companies working together over the course of several years. The first iteration, known as <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/dell-introduces-camm-ddr5-memory-for-its-new-precision-laptops-up-to-128gb-per-module">CAMM</a>, was an in-house project at Dell, with the first DDR5-equipped CAMM modules installed in Dell Precision 7000 series laptops. And thankfully, after doing the initial R&amp;D to make the tech a reality, Dell didn’t gatekeep. Their engineers believed that the project had such a good chance at becoming the next widespread memory standard that instead of keeping it proprietary, they went the other way and opened it up for standardization.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They were right. Only a few short years later, with the blessing of the <a href="https://www.jedec.org/news/pressreleases/jedec-publishes-new-camm2-memory-module-standard">JEDEC</a> standards body, LPCAMM2 is here and ready to take the torch.</p>



<p>Dell is one hero in this story, creating something the tech world sorely needed and then sharing instead of keeping it for themselves. Thankfully, this story is full of heroes: Micron and Lenovo are first to bring LPCAMM2 to market, with <a href="https://semiconductor.samsung.com/dram/module/lpcamm2/">Samsung</a>, <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/adata-demos-next-gen-memory-modules">ADATA</a>, and others backing it as well. Instead of everyone going their own way, they’ve rallied around a new industry standard—meaning an off-the-shelf LPCAMM2 module should theoretically work in any laptop that adopts the technology, regardless of who manufactures it. With the industry as a whole on the same page, backing standards like this, the world becomes a more repairable place.</p>



<h2><strong>Designing for a repairable future</strong></h2>



<p>The advent of LPCAMM2 is especially gratifying for repair advocates, who for years have been told that repairability simply can’t coexist with cutting-edge tech in thin-and-light devices. We’re not ready to accept that, and we’ve long argued that OEMs who are willing to innovate with repairability in mind can do better. Maybe we can’t see the future, but we can envision one that’s more repairable than what we’ve been sold in recent years—and we’re grateful when companies like Micron and Lenovo take the leap to make that future a reality.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1922" height="1081" src="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/05/06220218/Lenovo_P1_108-1.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/05/06220218/Lenovo_P1_108-1.jpg 1922w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/05/06220218/Lenovo_P1_108-1-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/05/06220218/Lenovo_P1_108-1-1600x900.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1922px) 100vw, 1922px"></figure>



<p>LPCAMM2 exemplifies our ability to advance technologically while designing with sustainability in mind. It represents a significant step forward in the fight against planned obsolescence. By fighting for a modular, upgradeable memory solution for chips previously stuck in a soldered hellscape, manufacturers are demonstrating their commitment to creating devices that stand the test of time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There’s so much to gain here: from increasing device lifespan at schools and businesses, to reducing anxiety for consumers at the point of purchase, to enabling hassle-free repairs for devices that would otherwise be scrapped. As more companies rally behind this standard, we can look forward to a future where more laptops are built to last, and where repairs and upgrades aren’t only possible, but encouraged. There’s no question that the potential for this technology to make a tangible difference is real, and it’s right in front of us.</p>



<p><em>Full Disclosure: iFixit has prior business relationships with both Micron and Lenovo, and we are hopelessly biased in favor of repairable products.</em></p>

</p>
<section>
<div><p data-block-key="k2n3w">This blog post is a part of a series about our research toward the next generation of the SecureDrop whistleblowing system. If you haven’t been following along, check out <a href="https://securedrop.org/news/how-to-research-your-own-cryptography-and-survive/">our previous post</a> for some recommended context.</p><p data-block-key="a0kb2">Here, we present a proposed end-to-end encryption protocol for a future version of SecureDrop server, accompanied by a brief discussion of various aspects of the protocol and our next steps.</p></div>
<a id="protocol_overview"></a>
<div><h2 data-block-key="amiet">Protocol overview</h2><p data-block-key="4ha31">We present a proof-of-concept protocol with the following core properties, which are derived from the research and threat modeling concerns <a href="https://securedrop.org/news/how-to-research-your-own-cryptography-and-survive/#design_challenges">previously discussed</a>:</p><ol><li data-block-key="6gel2">No accounts, and therefore no user authentication;</li><li data-block-key="es209">No message flow metadata, meaning messages can’t be linked together, and different types of messages are indistinguishable from one another;</li><li data-block-key="3ag4">No changes in server state are observable externally;</li><li data-block-key="520s9">No ciphertext collection or information leaks via trial decryption – a given recipient receives pertinent ciphertext only.</li></ol><p data-block-key="d3vce">The protocol has a simple API with only three endpoints: <code>send</code>, <code>fetch</code>, and <code>download</code>. Sources’ and journalists’ requests to these endpoints are structured identically, to make them harder for a compromised server or network adversary to distinguish. The server’s response is unique for each request, to avoid leaking information about server state.</p><p data-block-key="5ebcm">It uses well-established cryptographic primitives (currently <code>libsodium</code> for proof-of-concept purposes), achieving end-to-end encryption and one-way forward secrecy <a href="https://securedrop.org/news/how-to-research-your-own-cryptography-and-survive/#new_protocol_requirements">for messages flowing from source to journalist</a>. The server has access to minimal metadata, theoretically opening the door to deployment in adversarial environments.</p><p data-block-key="dlbh0">Along with this blog post, we’re also publishing:</p></div>
<a id="repo_link"></a>
<div><ul><li data-block-key="ds4bc">A <a href="https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-protocol">proof-of-concept GitHub repository</a> that demonstrates the end-to-end protocol and documents how it works;</li><li data-block-key="911qd">And a <a href="https://securedrop.org/documents/31/202401_SecureDrop_Protocol_Audit_Report_mmaker.pdf">preliminary audit</a>, which also contains a concise summary of the protocol.</li></ul><p data-block-key="ck31n"><b>This is proof-of-concept code and is not intended for production use</b>. The protocol details are not yet finalized.</p></div>
<a id="discussion"></a>
<div><h2 data-block-key="9v8mk">Discussion</h2><p data-block-key="4vdmm">Let’s contextualize the four notable properties of the SecureDrop Protocol as enumerated above.</p><p data-block-key="aj4m4">The first property arises from the desire to <a href="https://securedrop.org/news/anatomy-of-a-whistleblowing-system/#deniability">maximize plausible deniability</a> for the source in a variety of situations, including repeated snapshotting of the server. The motivation for the second property is evident, but the implementation is less trivial: it’s one thing to <a href="https://signal.org/blog/sealed-sender/">conceal a sender</a>, but how does a server deliver a message to an unknown recipient? One approach is trial decryption — deliver all ciphertext to everyone, and valid recipients will determine locally which messages belong to them based on what their own secret keys can decrypt. But besides being inefficient, this would also introduce an information leak: it would allow anyone to constantly monitor the server state and know when messages are added and deleted, observe message upload patterns, and so on. In the context of a relatively low-traffic self-hosted system, this would represent a significant metadata leak, thus the need for our third property.</p><p data-block-key="g2vk">Finally, one of our additional goals is a graceful degradation of security properties, in case of different degrees of user or server compromise. Allowing anyone on the internet to observe ciphertext would allow for “harvest now, decrypt later” attacks, so the fourth property reflects the need to guard against such possibilities.</p></div>
<a id="comparison"></a>
<p><h3 data-block-key="k2n3w">Comparison of messaging protocols</h3></p>
<p><img alt="At-a-glance message protocol comparison" src="https://media.securedrop.org/media/images/message_protocol_comparison.width-1440.svg" srcset="https://media.securedrop.org/media/images/message_protocol_comparison.width-2880.svg 2x">
</p>
<small>1. While there isn’t a single standard library, the implementation is straightforward. <br>
2. <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/534.pdf">New iteration of the research focuses on groups.</a> <br>
3. SecureDrop Protocol does not preclude scalability, but scaling to mass adoption level (i.e. millions of users) is a <a href="https://securedrop.org/news/how-to-research-your-own-cryptography-and-survive/#design_principles">nonrequirement</a> for our purposes.</small>
<div><p data-block-key="k2n3w">The following is a highly simplified comparison of real-world message delivery approaches.</p><h4 data-block-key="9vu"><b>Trial decryption</b></h4></div>
<p><img alt="Trial Decryption" src="https://media.securedrop.org/media/images/trial_decryption.width-1440.svg" srcset="https://media.securedrop.org/media/images/trial_decryption.width-2880.svg 2x">
</p>
<div><p data-block-key="7gjk9">Trial decryption is a simple way to conceal recipient information. Payloads are encrypted for a given recipient, which in turn has full visibility of all the payloads in the system. As the name suggests, a recipient will discover which messages belong to them by trying to decrypt all the messages they receive.</p><p data-block-key="20l4e">Benefits to this approach include symmetry among user traffic (all users download all payloads) and lack of account creation requirement. Limitations include the lack of scalability, the information leak mentioned above, and the ability for an arbitrary attacker to collect payloads/ciphertext. This approach would satisfy requirements 1 and 2 (lack of accounts, lack of message flow metadata), but not 3 and 4 (externally-observable server state, bulk ciphertext collection).</p></div>

</p>
<div><p data-block-key="a9b6l"><a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1256.pdf">Oblivious Message Detection and Retrieval is a newer message delivery mechanism</a> aimed at concealing the recipient and addressing the scalability issues of trial decryption by, in very broad terms, mixing pertinent and non-pertinent payloads, and using one or more “detector” servers to heuristically group, as well as distinguish, pertinent and non-pertinent content for a given user based on the “clues” assigned to each payload. (The idea of detecting/delivering messages in a way that makes them differentiable only by the receiver is an active research area; see also <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/089.pdf">Fuzzy Message Detection</a>.)</p><p data-block-key="f8mf3">Fuzzy message delivery is less feasible for small-scale systems like SecureDrop, where a burdensome level of decoy traffic would be required. In addition, OMR uses homomorphic encryption and other constructs that, at the time of writing, are relatively new, and pose some design challenges. The combination of the protocol's complexity and the bleeding-edge nature of some of the protocol's components gave us pause, although <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/534.pdf">research in this area</a>, particularly that focused on group messaging, is promising.</p></div>
<div><h4 data-block-key="cj7r2"><b>SecureDrop Protocol</b></h4></div>
<p><img alt="SecureDrop Protocol" src="https://media.securedrop.org/media/images/securedrop_protocol.width-1440.svg" srcset="https://media.securedrop.org/media/images/securedrop_protocol.width-2880.svg 2x">
</p>
<div><p data-block-key="3cemv">As with OMR, in the SecureDrop Protocol a sender sends the payload and a “clue” without any authentication. The recipient anonymously asks the server for clues, and the server serves both clues and decoys on every request. Every time a message-fetching request is made to the server, the response contains a new combination of clue and decoy ciphertext. Since every request returns a different response, and since the ciphertext is indistinguishable without being able to decrypt one or more of the clues, individual requests do not leak information about server state changes.</p><p data-block-key="60qe6">Message-fetching is a two-step operation. The recipient requests clues, and attempts trial decryption on them. For each successfully-decrypted clue, the recipient discovers a <code>message_id</code>. The <code>message_id</code> is a cryptographically unguessable value generated by the server upon message submission and kept private from all other parties. When an anonymous user discovers a <code>message_id</code>, they are able to fetch the corresponding message payload from the server. This two-step process is an optimization-related implementation detail, not a security measure.</p></div>
<a id="securedrop_protocol_details"></a>
<div><h3 data-block-key="6qff5">SecureDrop Protocol in detail</h3><p data-block-key="er4gd">Understanding SecureDrop Protocol’s message retrieval mechanism requires a basic understanding of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange#Generalization_to_finite_cyclic_groups">classical Diffie-Hellman key agreement</a>. In particular, we take advantage of the notable properties that key agreement is commutative and can be extended to any number of parties.</p></div>

<div><p data-block-key="k2n3w">This diagram shows how the recipient of a message can agree with the server on a shared key <i>K</i> without learning anything about the state of the server – while preventing the server from knowing whether the recipient is indeed the intended one. Every <i>K</i> is obtained using: long-term key material, which later allows the correct recipient to detect their pertinent messages; per-message ephemeral key material, which introduces unlinkability between messages addressed to the same recipient; and per-request ephemeral key material via “remixed” clues, which provides unlinkability between message-fetching requests, since the clues are transformed before every request.</p><p data-block-key="f35a0">As shown in the next diagram, this scheme allows the server to obliviously encrypt and transfer some information using symmetric key <i>K</i>, without knowing if the requesting recipient will be able to decrypt it.</p></div>

</p>
<center><small><i>Detail of the oblivious transfer of a message_id between the server and a recipient</i></small></center>
<div><p data-block-key="k2n3w">The material that is <i>obliviously-transferred</i> is the <code>message_id</code>, a securely random, unguessable value that the server generates upon message submission. Conceptually, it can be thought of as a server-side message uuid. Its main purpose is to keep clue sizes small, rather than encrypting and remixing full message payloads.</p><p data-block-key="euj75">Leveraging the commutativity of multi-party Diffie-Hellman to achieve unlinkability between requests is an uncommon application. We credit this contribution to former SecureDrop team member <a href="https://niij.org/">Michael Z</a>, who <a href="https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-protocol/issues/16">resolved</a> what was a multi-month sticking point in our research.</p></div>

</p>
<center><small><i>Sample visualization of five fetch attempts from two valid and three invalid recipients, from a server containing 3 messages (values are symbolic)</i></small></center>
<p data-block-key="k2n3w">Why is the server “untrusted” if it generates secret key material? The server is “untrusted” in the sense that it should learn nothing about users and messages besides what is inherently observable from its pattern of requests, and it should not have access to sensitive metadata, or sender or receiver information. What the server must know are ciphertext payloads and associated clues that need to be stored. In this regard, the server is still a “privileged” asset that should not be queryable by anyone on the internet. That is why the server contributes with an ephemeral key: to hide its state and thus render all requests unlinkable to any change of such state.</p>

<p><h3 data-block-key="2k0v1">SecureDrop Protocol: encryption properties</h3></p>
<div><h4 data-block-key="e8es9"><b>Message retrieval symmetry despite source-journalist asymmetry</b></h4><p data-block-key="6uekb">Until now, we have commonly used the terms <i>sender</i> and <i>recipient</i> to indicate a role that a user can have. In classical messaging applications, all users can both receive messages and initiate conversations. In whistleblowing applications, the anonymized party (<i>source)</i> initiates communication with the trusted party (<i>journalist</i>). Our previous blog post outlines the difference in their endpoint requirements in detail, and describes the limitations on the type of key material that a source can have.</p><p data-block-key="eo80i">So, while both journalists and sources will use the same message retrieval mechanism and the same submission mechanism (and in practice, the same API endpoints), and are treated indistinguishably from the server’s perspective, their key setup is inherently different. This difference of roles and setup has a significant impact on the encryption properties we can achieve, especially in three areas: forward secrecy, participant authentication, and deniability.</p></div>
<div><h4 data-block-key="4cg4a"><b>Forward secrecy: It’s imperfect</b></h4><p data-block-key="4rthf">Forward secrecy requires ephemeral keys, implying an evolving state with some non-predictable, non-deterministic source of entropy. Forward secrecy requires that both parties use per-message ephemeral keys, and is commonly achieved by periodically re-generating secret-key material and then discarding it, like an automatic key-rotation procedure. Our <a href="https://securedrop.org/news/how-to-research-your-own-cryptography-and-survive/#design_principles">design constraints</a> allow for source-to-journalist forward secrecy, by rotating some journalist encryption key, but not vice versa: for usability reasons, we do not want to rotate a source passphrase, and we cannot add non-deterministic key material on the source side, since we <a href="https://securedrop.org/news/how-to-research-your-own-cryptography-and-survive/#design_challenges">cannot store it anywhere</a>. We consider the anonymity of the source a higher priority than the confidentiality of the material, so under these circumstances we accept this “one-way” form of forward secrecy.</p><h4 data-block-key="14ak5"><b>Participant authentication</b></h4><p data-block-key="50bl1">Consider a simple Diffie-Hellman key-agreement used with per-message ephemeral keys used for symmetric message encryption. A Diffie-Hellman key agreement is performed between the secret part of the per-message key and the public component of the recipient.</p><p data-block-key="73k5i">This kind of key agreement is unauthenticated: the recipient has no implicit or explicit proof that a particular sender sent that public key and ciphertext. This does not matter for a “first contact” message, which by definition comes from an anonymous/unknown party, but for ongoing conversations, some measure of participant authentication is required – essentially, to ensure that the source who began the conversation is indeed the one who is continuing it.</p><p data-block-key="fpefs">The question of participant authentication is an open problem that is interlinked with deniability. We see several fairly straightforward ways of addressing it; more discussion can be found <a href="https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-protocol/issues/30">here</a>.</p><h4 data-block-key="1subm"><b>Deniability for sources</b></h4><p data-block-key="7ljhr">There are multiple layers at which SecureDrop seeks to create deniability: forensic deniability on a source’s own machine; forensic deniability on the server of the existence of a given source; and message-level cryptographic deniability.</p><p data-block-key="2uev3">The first forensic <a href="https://securedrop.org/news/anatomy-of-a-whistleblowing-system/#deniability">deniability property</a> is discussed at length in our previous posts and is orthogonal to the protocol; broadly, we satisfy it by avoiding writing to disk on the source’s machine. The second type of forensic deniability is served by the lack of server-side accounts; the only way to prove that a given party exists is to gain ciphertext addressed to them (a pending message) along with their key material.</p><p data-block-key="6v088">Conversation-level and message-level deniability require a more detailed discussion.</p><p data-block-key="9mvav">In cryptographic terms, deniability is often called <a href="https://cypherpunks.ca/~iang/pubs/dake-ccs15.pdf">repudiation</a>, of which participation repudiation and message repudiation are two forms. Repudiation and authentication are both important security principles, and yet, in some ways they appear at odds with one another: how can a protocol offer both authentication <i>and</i> the ability to deny sending a message or being part of a conversation?</p><p data-block-key="279as">The Signal Protocol does offer <a href="https://signal.org/docs/specifications/x3dh/x3dh.pdf">both repudiation attributes and implicit participant authentication</a> under <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/642.pdf">certain conditions</a>, via a clever use of multiple Diffie-Hellman key exchanges. Broadly, the implicit authentication comes from the use of long-term identity keys, while the deniability comes from the combination of approximately-discoverable public keys (via phone number/username, on Signal’s servers) and the idea that, while both parties must agree on a shared key to facilitate their conversation, neither party must sign their individual messages. Hypothetically, a conversation between two parties could be forged by one of the parties, providing the other with a measure of deniability.</p><p data-block-key="l7va">By contrast, the SecureDrop Protocol cannot provide conversation-level repudiation in cases where an ongoing source-journalist conversation is desired. This is because, while journalist public key material can and must be publicly discoverable so that anonymous sources can contact them, sources do <i>not</i> publish their public key material, and must attach it in their first-contact message so that journalists can reply, proving their participation in at least this initial message.</p><p data-block-key="dmq50">SecureDrop Protocol could theoretically support two modes: a true “dead drop” mode from a source that never intends to return or receive replies, and a conversational mode, in which the source expects to return and continue correspondence. In the former, the source achieves full deniability. In the latter, which is the more typical use-case, individual message repudiation can be achieved (as can participant authentication, mentioned above), but participation repudiation cannot. This issue is an area of <a href="https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-protocol/issues/30">ongoing research</a>.</p></div>

<div><h3 data-block-key="k2n3w">Cryptographic primitives</h3><p data-block-key="1j0ae">The proof-of-concept implementation uses <a href="https://doc.libsodium.org/">libsodium</a> for both key-agreement and symmetric encryption.

There are various key encapsulation mechanisms we could make use of that are appropriate for encryption, however, we have not yet found a post-quantum-secure solution for the message-fetching mechanism in the protocol, which requires the commutative properties of multi-party ECDH discussed above.</p><p data-block-key="5m08n">The multi-party mechanism we describe is used to protect anonymized metadata from leaking information about the state of the server over time, similar to a network-level correlation attack. One possibility is a hybrid model where messages themselves (including their sender information and other metadata) are encrypted in a quantum-safe manner, while the message-retrieval mechanism remains usable with less future-proofing.</p><p data-block-key="ebh32">That said, this protocol will not transition to production-readiness until a thorough post-quantum security assessment has taken place.</p><p data-block-key="73bjq">Post-quantum readiness is an open research topic that we do not have the resources to address alone; we are grateful for the offers of assistance with post-quantum readiness that we have received, and we welcome additional collaboration in this area!</p></div>

                 <div><strong><span>CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA</span> </strong>Apple today unveiled the groundbreaking new iPad Pro in a stunningly thin and light design, taking portability and performance to the next level. Available in silver and space black finishes, the new <a href="https://www.apple.com/ipad-pro/" target="_blank">iPad Pro</a> comes in two sizes: an expansive 13-inch model and a super-portable 11-inch model. Both sizes feature the world’s most advanced display — a new breakthrough Ultra Retina XDR display with state-of-the-art tandem OLED technology — providing a remarkable visual experience. The new iPad Pro is made possible with the new M4 chip, the next generation of Apple silicon, which delivers a huge leap in performance and capabilities. M4 features an entirely new display engine to enable the precision, color, and brightness of the Ultra Retina XDR display. With a new CPU, a next-generation GPU that builds upon the GPU architecture debuted on M3, and the most powerful Neural Engine yet, the new iPad Pro is an outrageously powerful device for artificial intelligence.

                 <div>The new iPad Pro — the thinnest Apple product ever — features a stunningly thin and light design, taking portability to a whole new level. The 11-inch model is just 5.3 mm thin, and the 13-inch model is even thinner at a striking 5.1 mm, while both models are just as strong as the previous design. The 11-inch model weighs less than a pound, and the 13-inch model is nearly a quarter pound lighter than its predecessor — allowing pro users to extend their workflows in new ways and in more places. The new iPad Pro is available in two gorgeous finishes — silver and space black — both with 100 percent recycled aluminum enclosures.

                 <div>The new iPad Pro debuts the Ultra Retina XDR, the world’s most advanced display, to provide an even more remarkable visual experience. The Ultra Retina XDR display features state-of-the-art tandem OLED technology that uses two OLED panels and combines the light from both to provide phenomenal full-screen brightness. The new iPad Pro supports an incredible 1000 nits of full-screen brightness for SDR and HDR content, and 1600 nits peak for HDR. No other device of its kind delivers this level of extreme dynamic range. Tandem OLED technology enables sub-millisecond control over the color and luminance of each pixel, taking XDR precision further than ever. Specular highlights in photos and video appear even brighter, and there’s more detail in shadows and low light than ever before on iPad — all while delivering even more responsiveness to content in motion. For pro users working in high-end, color-managed workflows or challenging lighting conditions, a new nano-texture glass option comes to iPad Pro for the first time.<sup>1</sup> Nano-texture glass is precisely etched at a nanometer scale, maintaining image quality and contrast while scattering ambient light for reduced glare. With its breakthrough tandem OLED technology, extreme brightness, incredibly precise contrast, brilliant colors, and nano-texture glass option, the new Ultra Retina XDR display is the world’s most advanced display, giving iPad Pro customers an unparalleled viewing experience.

                 <div>The incredibly thin and light design and game-changing display of the new iPad Pro is only possible with M4, the next generation of Apple silicon that delivers a huge leap in performance. M4 is built on second-generation 3-nanometer technology that’s even more power efficient, which is perfect for the design of the new iPad Pro. With an entirely new display engine, M4 introduces pioneering technology for the stunning precision, color, and brightness of the Ultra Retina XDR display. The new CPU offers up to four performance cores and now six efficiency cores,<sup>2</sup> with next-generation machine learning (ML) accelerators, to deliver up to 1.5x faster CPU performance over M2 in the previous-generation iPad Pro.<sup>3</sup> M4 builds on the GPU architecture of M3 — the 10-core GPU includes powerful features like Dynamic Caching, and hardware-accelerated mesh shading and ray tracing, which come to iPad for the first time. Coupled with higher unified memory bandwidth, pro rendering apps like Octane will see up to 4x faster performance than M2.<sup>3</sup> M4 also delivers tremendous gains and industry-leading performance per watt. Compared to M2, M4 can deliver the same performance using just half the power, and compared to the latest PC chip in a thin and light laptop, M4 can deliver the same performance using just a quarter of the power.<sup>4</sup> A new advanced Media Engine includes support for AV1 decode, providing more power-efficient playback of high-resolution video experiences from streaming services.

With iPad Pro with M4, users can perform AI-enabled tasks even faster, like easily isolate a subject from its background in 4K video with just a tap with Scene Removal Mask in Final Cut Pro. With this advanced level of performance, the Neural Engine in M4 is more powerful than any neural processing unit in any AI PC today.

                 <div>The updated camera system on the new iPad Pro delivers even more versatility, and with its rich audio from four studio-quality mics, users can shoot, edit, and share all on one device. The 12MP back camera captures vibrant Smart HDR images and video with even better color, improved textures, and detail in low light. It also now features a new adaptive True Tone flash that makes document scanning on the new iPad Pro better than ever. Using AI, the new iPad Pro automatically identifies documents right in the Camera app, and if a shadow is in the way, it instantly takes multiple photos with the new adaptive flash, stitching the scan together for a dramatically better scan.

Thunderbolt supports an extensive ecosystem of high-performance accessories, including external displays like the Pro Display XDR at its full 6K resolution, and external storage, all connected using high-performance cables and docks. iPad Pro supports Wi-Fi 6E for super-fast Wi-Fi connections for pro workflows on the go. Wi-Fi + Cellular models with 5G allow users to access their files, communicate with colleagues, and back up their data in a snap while on the go. Cellular models of the new iPad Pro are activated with eSIM, a more secure alternative to a physical SIM card, allowing users to quickly connect and transfer their existing plans digitally, and store multiple cellular plans on a single device. Customers can easily get connected to wireless data plans on the new iPad Pro in over 190 countries and regions around the world without needing to get a physical SIM card from a local carrier.

A new sensor in the barrel can sense a user’s squeeze, bringing up a tool palette to quickly switch tools, line weights, and colors, all without interrupting the creative process. A custom<em> </em>haptic engine delivers a light tap that provides confirmation when users squeeze, use double-tap, or snap to a Smart Shape for a remarkably intuitive experience. A gyroscope allows users to roll Apple Pencil Pro for precise control of the tool they’re using. Rotating the barrel changes the orientation of shaped pen and brush tools, just like pen and paper. And with Apple Pencil hover, users can visualize the exact orientation of a tool before making a mark.

                 <div>iPadOS is packed with features that push the boundaries of what’s possible on iPad. With Reference Mode, iPadOS can precisely match color requirements of the Ultra Retina XDR display for tasks in which accurate colors and consistent image quality are critical — including review and approve, color grading, and compositing. Stage Manager enables users to work with multiple overlapping windows in a single view, resize windows, tap to switch between apps, and more. With full external display support of up to 6K, iPad Pro users can also extend their workflow, as well as use the built-in camera on an external display for enhanced video conferencing. Users can take advantage of the powerful AI capabilities in iPad Pro and intelligent features in iPadOS, including Visual Look Up, Subject Lift, Live Text, or Live Captions and Personal Voice for accessibility.

The Notes app gives users new ways to organize, read, annotate, and collaborate on PDFs, and working with PDFs is also easier with AutoFill, which intelligently identifies and fills fields in forms.

        <div>
             
                 <div><span>CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA</span> Apple today announced M4, the latest chip delivering phenomenal performance to the all-new <a href="https://www.apple.com/ipad-pro/" target="_blank">iPad Pro</a>. Built using second-generation 3-nanometer technology, M4 is a system on a chip (SoC) that advances the industry-leading power efficiency of Apple silicon and enables the incredibly thin design of iPad Pro. It also features an entirely new display engine to drive the stunning precision, color, and brightness of the breakthrough Ultra Retina XDR display on iPad Pro. A new CPU has up to 10 cores, while the new 10-core GPU builds on the next-generation GPU architecture introduced in M3, and brings Dynamic Caching, hardware-accelerated ray tracing, and hardware-accelerated mesh shading to iPad for the first time. M4 has Apple’s fastest Neural Engine ever, capable of up to 38 trillion operations per second, which is faster than the neural processing unit of any AI PC today. Combined with faster memory bandwidth, along with next-generation machine learning (ML) accelerators in the CPU, and a high-performance GPU, M4 makes the new iPad Pro an outrageously powerful device for artificial intelligence.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>“The new iPad Pro with M4 is a great example of how building best-in-class custom silicon enables breakthrough products,” said Johny Srouji, Apple’s senior vice president of Hardware Technologies. “The power-efficient performance of M4, along with its new display engine, makes the thin design and game-changing display of iPad Pro possible, while fundamental improvements to the CPU, GPU, Neural Engine, and memory system make M4 extremely well suited for the latest applications leveraging AI. Altogether, this new chip makes iPad Pro the most powerful device of its kind.”

										<p>I’ve paid over $350,000 of rent in my life. That averages out to $2,500 a month since mid 2012. And, with near record interest rates and elevated home prices, I may end up paying another $350,000 in rent before I ever buy a house.</p>
<p>I am a part of what you might call the Forever Renter class. This is a cohort of people in their mid-20s to late-30s who are either <em>unwilling</em> or <em>unable</em> to buy a home under current market conditions. Unfortunately, those conditions aren’t moving in the right direction either. As <a href="https://www.redfin.com/news/housing-market-update-home-prices-costs-record-high/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Redfin recently reported</a>, “The median U.S. home-sale price hit a record $383,725 during the four weeks ending April 21, up 5.2% from a year earlier.”</p>
<p>But it’s not just the median U.S. home that is setting records. Homes in many high cost of living areas are near their highs as well. Last month <a href="https://www.zillow.com/research/million-dollar-cities-2024-33891/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zillow reported</a> that there are now a record 550 “Million-Dollar” cities in the United States. These are cities where the <em>typical</em> home price is greater than $1 million. While nearly half of these Million-Dollar cities are in California, the New York metropolitan area has the most with 106:</p>

<p>But rising home prices are just one factor impacting affordability. High interest rates are another.</p>
<p>The 30-Year mortgage rate peaked last October at 7.8% before dropping through year end. At the time, the worst of it seemed to be over. However, with inflation coming in hotter than expected this year, many believe that the Fed <a href="https://x.com/biancoresearch/status/1785294648212390216" target="_blank">will no longer cut rates as planned</a> in 2024. As a result, mortgage rates have started creeping up yet again with the 30-Year near 7.2% today:</p>
<p><a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IUS30YMR_chart_2024_04_29.png"><img decoding="async" src="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IUS30YMR_chart_2024_04_29.png" alt="30-Year mortgage rate from 2021 to early 2024." width="700" height="461" srcset="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IUS30YMR_chart_2024_04_29.png 2000w, https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IUS30YMR_chart_2024_04_29-300x198.png 300w, https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IUS30YMR_chart_2024_04_29-1024x674.png 1024w, https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IUS30YMR_chart_2024_04_29-768x506.png 768w, https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IUS30YMR_chart_2024_04_29-1536x1011.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" data-old-src="//ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IUS30YMR_chart_2024_04_29.png" data-srcset="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IUS30YMR_chart_2024_04_29.png 2000w, https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IUS30YMR_chart_2024_04_29-300x198.png 300w, https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IUS30YMR_chart_2024_04_29-1024x674.png 1024w, https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IUS30YMR_chart_2024_04_29-768x506.png 768w, https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IUS30YMR_chart_2024_04_29-1536x1011.png 1536w"></a>But the final nail in the coffin for housing affordability is the slow growth in income. Incomes haven’t risen in lockstep with housing prices and mortgage rates. For example, <a href="https://cdn.nar.realtor/sites/default/files/documents/hai-02-2024-housing-affordability-index-2024-04-12.pdf?_gl=1*15hok00*_gcl_au*NTEzNTgwMTMxLjE3MTQ0MTEzNTk." target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to the National Association of Realtors</a>, the median family income increased by 18% from $85,806 to $100,876 between 2021 and February 2024.</p>
<p>However, over the same time period, the monthly mortgage payment required to purchase the median U.S. home doubled:</p>

<p>So while American families were getting an 18% raise, their prospective housing cost increased by 100%. Technically, the median sales price for new houses in the U.S. has dropped by 13% since their peak in late 2022:</p>
<p><a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IUSMSPNHS_chart_2024_04_29.png"><img decoding="async" src="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IUSMSPNHS_chart_2024_04_29.png" alt="US median sales price for new houses sold (% off high_ from 2019 to 2024." width="700" height="461" srcset="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IUSMSPNHS_chart_2024_04_29.png 2000w, https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IUSMSPNHS_chart_2024_04_29-300x198.png 300w, https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IUSMSPNHS_chart_2024_04_29-1024x674.png 1024w, https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IUSMSPNHS_chart_2024_04_29-768x506.png 768w, https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IUSMSPNHS_chart_2024_04_29-1536x1011.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" data-old-src="//ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IUSMSPNHS_chart_2024_04_29.png" data-srcset="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IUSMSPNHS_chart_2024_04_29.png 2000w, https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IUSMSPNHS_chart_2024_04_29-300x198.png 300w, https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IUSMSPNHS_chart_2024_04_29-1024x674.png 1024w, https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IUSMSPNHS_chart_2024_04_29-768x506.png 768w, https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IUSMSPNHS_chart_2024_04_29-1536x1011.png 1536w"></a></p>
<p>However, this has done very little to affect affordability. Since rates are still so high, the American Dream remains out of reach for so many.</p>
<p>This is why the Forever Renter class exists. Though incomes have increased, housing costs have increased by far more. It’s gotten so bad that <a href="https://zillow.mediaroom.com/2024-02-29-Home-buyers-need-to-earn-47,000-more-than-in-2020" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zillow estimated</a> that homebuyers need to earn nearly $50,000 more today than in 2020 to comfortably afford a home. And, in some cities in California, the amount of additional income needed exceeds $100,000!</p>
<p>But, this only addresses a portion of the Forever Renter class—those who are <em>unable</em> to buy a home. It ignores those who can afford to buy one, but choose not to. Because, even if you could buy a house in this market, should you?</p>
<h2>The Unwilling Buyers</h2>
<p>For those that have the means to purchase a home in the current housing market, they may still choose not to if renting is much cheaper. While the numbers vary by location, <a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/should-you-rent-or-buy-a-house/">I ran an analysis a few weeks ago</a> that suggests that renting has the upper hand in many high cost cities.</p>
<p>For example, in a place like NYC, a Forever Renter could end up having to decide between paying $4,000 a month <em>to rent</em> or $7,000 a month <em>to buy</em> the same apartment. Even if they could afford such a high housing cost, would that be better than renting and investing the extra $3,000 a month into a diversified portfolio? My conservative estimate suggests not. For the time being, renting wins out.</p>
<p>This is where many in the <em>unwilling</em> Forever Renter class find themselves. They have good jobs. They make good money. But interest rates are also the highest they have been in two decades. As a result, if they want to borrow money to buy a house, they will pay for it dearly.</p>
<p>Given this, their best course of action may be to forego the mortgage market altogether and save up enough money to buy a house in cash. If that is too difficult, they could at least trying saving up a larger downpayment instead. Rather than putting the standard 20% down, maybe they put 50% down. Anything that helps them reduce the amount of money that they borrow at high rates would be a win.</p>
<p>Alternatively, they could use a “wait and see” approach as well. Maybe they start by saving for a larger downpayment, but if rates drop to a more suitable level sooner, then they pull the trigger and buy a house.</p>
<p>No matter how the future plays out, being flexible with your planning can go a long way in helping you make the right financial decision.&nbsp;And, in the event that the immediate future doesn’t play out in your favor, remember that “forever” isn’t as long as it seems.</p>
<h2>Forever Isn’t Forever</h2>
<p>&nbsp;As much as I want to go on about the woes of the Forever Renter class, they may not stay as Forever Renters for all too long. The problem with a lot of financial opinions (mine included) is that they can be far too short-sighted. We overindex on what’s happening right now and extrapolate that out into the future. But that’s almost never how the future actually turns out.</p>
<p>Just go back in time with me five years to May 2019. Imagine all the forecasts, price targets, and predictions that were made in that year. How many of them turned out to be right? None. Not a single one predicted what happened in the next year. And I wouldn’t expect them to.</p>
<p>The same thing will be true with regards to the U.S. housing market. Right now things look bleak. The vast majority of 20 and 30 somethings can’t afford a home today. But this doesn’t mean that they won’t be able to afford one later. Just look at what is happening in Austin, Texas as an example of what could be. Developers started building more homes and prices <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-25/larry-ellison-s-austin-snub-adds-to-city-s-housing-office-woes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have dropped by 18% since May 2022</a>. Increasing supply works. Go figure.</p>
<p>Of course, this won’t happen everywhere (for a host of reasons). But it illustrates how a difficult situation is unlikely to stay difficult indefinitely. Something’s got to give. A solution will present itself. Whether that solution is the one we want is another story entirely. In the meantime, here are some options that can help you during your “forever renter” period:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Earn more</strong>: If you feel like you will be forever priced out of the housing market, start finding ways to earn more. I know this won’t help in the short run, but <a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/paychecks-not-portfolios/">raising your income</a> is the best thing you can do to improve your financial situation in the long run. If you have both Saturday and Sunday off every single week, then there is no excuse to get started on <em>something</em> that can eventually increase your earnings.</li>
<li><strong>Consider other housing arrangements</strong>: Being more open with where you live and who you live with as you wait for market conditions to improve. Living with roommates, moving to a lower cost of living area, or downsizing can help reduce your living costs temporarily as you save up to buy your desired home.</li>
<li><strong>Be flexible</strong>: Buying a home will likely be the biggest financial decision of your life, so don’t rush into it. This is especially true in an unfavorable housing market. Be willing to adjust your timeline and keep saving until the right opportunity comes along. When things aren’t looking good, being flexible enough to wait out the storm has its advantages.</li>
</ul>
<p>While things don’t look great now, I am a firm believer that the housing market will become less daunting…eventually. Until then, happy investing and thank you for reading.</p>

These changes are grounded in prioritizing high-impact titles and further investing in Bethesda’s portfolio of blockbuster games and beloved worlds which you have nurtured over many decades. </blockquote><blockquote>To double down on these franchises and invest to build new ones requires us to look across the business to identify the opportunities that are best positioned for success. This reprioritization of titles and resources means a few teams will be realigned to others and that some of our colleagues will be leaving us.  </blockquote><blockquote>Here are the changes going into effect: </blockquote><blockquote>Arkane Austin – This studio will close with some members of the team joining other studios to work on projects across Bethesda. Arkane Austin has a history of making impactful and innovative games and it is a pedigree that everyone should be proud of. Redfall’s previous update will be its last as we end all development on the game. The game and its servers will remain online for players to enjoy and we will provide make-good offers to players who purchased the Hero DLC. </blockquote><blockquote>Alpha Dog Studios – This studio will also close. We appreciate the team’s creativity in bringing Doom to new players. Mighty Doom will be sunset on August 7 and we will be turning off the ability for players to make any purchases in the game.  </blockquote><blockquote>Tango Gameworks – Tango Gameworks will also close. We are thankful for their contributions to Bethesda and players around the world. Hi-Fi Rush will continue to be available to players on the platforms it is today.  </blockquote><blockquote>Roundhouse Games – The team at Roundhouse Games will be joining ZeniMax Online Studios (ZOS). Roundhouse has played a key role in many of our recent game launches and bringing them into ZOS to work on The Elder Scrolls Online will mean we can do even more to grow the world that millions of players call home.  </blockquote><blockquote>With this consolidation of our Bethesda studio teams, so that we can invest more deeply in our portfolio of games and new IP, a small number of roles across select Bethesda publishing and corporate teams will also be eliminated. </blockquote><blockquote>Those whose roles will be impacted will be notified today, and we ask that you please treat your departing colleagues with respect and compassion. We will provide our full support to those who are impacted in today’s notifications and through their transitions, including severance benefits informed by local laws.  </blockquote><blockquote>These changes are not a reflection of the creativity and skill of the talented individuals at these teams or the risks they took to try new things. I acknowledge that these changes are also disruptive to the various support teams across ZeniMax and Bethesda that bring our games to market. We are making these tough decisions to create capacity to increase investment in other parts of our portfolio and focus on our priority games. </blockquote><blockquote>Bethesda remains one of the key pillars of Xbox with a strong portfolio of amazing games and thriving communities. As we look to the future, there is an impressive line-up of games on the horizon. In 2024 alone we have Starfield Shattered Space, Fallout 76 Skyline Valley, Indiana Jones and The Great Circle, and The Elder Scrolls Online’s Golden Road. As we align our plans and resources to best set ourselves up for success in this complex and changing industry, our teams across Arkane Lyon, Bethesda Game Studios, id Software, MachineGames, ZeniMax Online Studios and the Bethesda publishing and corporate teams will be well-positioned to build new IP, explore new game concepts, and expand on our existing franchises.  </blockquote><blockquote>- Matt</blockquote><p>Microsoft's announcement of the cuts at Bethesda come over three months after <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-lays-off-1900-staff-from-its-video-game-workforce">the company announced plans to cut 1,900 staff from its video game workforce</a>, and amid a boom time for Bethesda's Fallout series following the breakout hit Prime Video TV show. The closure of Tango Gameworks hits just over a year after the launch of Hi-Fi Rush, what many considered to be <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hi-fi-rush-review">one of the best Xbox games in recent years</a>. <a href="https://twitter.com/aarongreenberg/status/1649431572137779203" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tweeting</a> in April 2023, Aaron Greenberg, VP, Xbox Games Marketing at Microsoft, addressed concern that Hi-Fi Rush had failed to meet sales targets, calling the game "a break out hit for us and our players in all key measurements and expectations." Greenberg continued: "We couldn’t be happier with what the team at Tango Gameworks delivered with this surprise release." <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-game-hi-fi-rush-confirmed-for-ps5-release-date-announced">Hi-Fi Rush launched on PS5</a> as part of Microsoft's new multi-platform push in March.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/KhhqgR902g" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/KhhqgR902g</a></p>— Tango Gameworks (EN) (@TangoGameworks) <a href="https://twitter.com/TangoGameworks/status/1787837929332601189?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 7, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>In <a href="https://twitter.com/DBakaba/status/1787839169588265251" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a series of tweets</a>, Arkane Lyon chief Dinga Bakaba hit out at the cuts, calling them "absolutely terrible." "To any executive reading this, friendly reminder that video games are an entertainment/cultural industry, and your business as a corporation is to take care of your artists/entertainers and help them create value for you," Bakaba continued.</p><p>"Don't throw us into gold fever gambits, don't use us as strawmen for miscalculations/blind spots, don't make our work environments darwinist jungles. You say we make you proud when we make a good game. Make us proud when times are tough. We know you can, we seen it before.</p><p>"For now, great teams are sunsetting before our eyes again, and it's a fucking gut stab. Lyon is safe, but please be tactful and discerning about all this, and respect affected folks' voice and leave it room to be heard, it's their story to tell, their feelings to express.</p><p>"Inside baseball, but if I read 'immersive sim curse' from the community, especially from a fellow dev, I swear to God... Please, let's talk about the *real* challenges instead of rehashing irrational anxieties of the past.</p><p>"Even more inside baseball, but with a very, very wide range, as a wise and sorely missed man said: 'Please Stop.' "</p><p>Layoffs are sweeping the video game industry, with a number of high-profile studios cutting staff or shutting down. In stark contrast to a year of blockbuster video game hits, one of the biggest ongoing industry trends in 2023 was the prevalence of mass layoffs, and they have continued into 2024. While actual figures are difficult to obtain, estimates suggest the number of workers laid off in games last year approached or exceeded 10,000. A recent GDC survey of developers suggests one-third of all game developers were impacted by layoffs last year, either directly or by witnessing them happen at their company.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>There are about a thousand real-estate developers in New York City. Nathan Berman is one of them, and he’s become rich doing it. But, he told me recently, “I never built a building from scratch, and never wanted to.” Instead, Berman, who is sixty-four, specializes in taking existing structures and converting them into apartments, a useful trick in a city that’s always starved for housing—and newly wary of the five-day-a-week office routine. In 2017, he converted 443 Greenwich Street, a former warehouse and book bindery in Tribeca, built in 1883, into a luxury condo; among the celebrities who now own apartments there are <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/notes-on-hollywood/is-harry-styles-a-movie-star">Harry Styles</a> and <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tag/jake-gyllenhaal">Jake Gyllenhaal</a>. (The building was designed to be “paparazzi-proof,” so it features an underground parking area with a valet.) It’s not much of a feat, though, to redo an industrial space that has a rudimentary interior. Berman is more excited by the transformation of huge, obsolete office towers into warrens of one- and two-bedroom apartments. He compares the effort to extract as much residential rental space as possible out of such buildings to solving a Rubik’s Cube.</p><p>Since 1997, Berman, through his firm, Metro Loft Management, has turned eight Manhattan office towers into rental-apartment complexes, adding some five thousand units to the city’s housing stock. His company has just signed a contract for the largest conversion yet in the United States: Pfizer’s former headquarters, on East Forty-second Street, will be refashioned to house about fifteen hundred apartments. Berman has no patience for nostalgia. “You’re tearing down something that simply doesn’t work anymore,” he explained. Although Metro Loft has offices at 40 Wall Street, Berman often works at home himself, on the Upper East Side. He happily spends hours poring over blueprints, dividing former fields of cubicles into small but clever residences and reconceiving onetime copy-machine nooks as mini laundry rooms or skinny kitchens. All his apartments are market-rate properties, so what he creates is élite but ordinary, luxurious but cramped, permanent but marginal. Avinash Malhotra, an architect who has done several conversions with Berman, noted that a single office tower can be carved up into hundreds of little units, as in a hotel. “He is not making housing for the homeless,” Malhotra said. “But I often joke among my employees that what we do is slums for the rich.”</p><p>One day in December, I went to the financial district and joined Berman in the stark white lobby of 55 Broad Street, a thirty-story former office tower that was built in 1967 by Emery Roth &amp; Sons. Berman has started converting it into five hundred and seventy-one apartments, many of them studios aimed at professionals just out of college. Scaffolding surrounded the bottom of the tower, imprisoning a Starbucks by the entrance. Berman dresses to understated effect. He wore a <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/on-and-off-the-avenue/lets-talk-about-the-clothes-on-succession">quiet-luxury</a> ensemble—unzipped Brunello Cucinelli vest, Loro Piana sweater, John Lobb shoes—and carried nothing in his hands but his phone.</p><p>He was overhauling 55 Broad Street under complicated conditions: it still had office tenants inside. The day we visited, five of the floors were still occupied by companies that had not yet left. (One, a property-management outfit called Solstice Residential Group, even sued to stay, but ultimately settled and moved nearby.) Every so often, an office worker rushed through the lobby, looking as lonely as a ghost. The entrance was renovated twenty years ago by the building’s original owners—the Rudin family, a New York real-estate powerhouse—and featured a revolving door, white marble walls, harsh Kubrickian lighting, and a long security credenza. Berman said that he would put in a hinged door, lower the lighting, cover the walls with wood panelling, add a fireplace and an inviting couch or two, and install wide stairs that flowed down to amenity rooms on the floor below. “Walking into the building will seem like walking into a lounge that people are hanging out in,” he told me. “And you just happen to be one of the people that lives here.”</p><p>Among white-collar workers, the <em>covid</em>-19 pandemic led to a profound shift: even when it became safe to return to the office, many employees preferred to <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/annals-of-inquiry/can-remote-work-be-fixed">work remotely</a>. Nationwide, offices are only about fifty per cent full. Since 2019, according to a recent academic study, downtown street foot traffic has fallen by an average of twenty-six per cent in America’s fifty-two biggest cities. Urban theorists describe a phenomenon called the “<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/10/23/what-happened-to-san-francisco-really">doom loop</a>”: once workers stop filling up downtown offices, the stores and restaurants that serve them close, which in turn makes the area even emptier. And who wants to work somewhere with no services? In St. Louis, whole swaths of the downtown business district are vacant. Not long ago, the A.T.&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;T. Tower, one of the city’s marquee properties, which was sold for two hundred and five million dollars in 2006, was off-loaded for $3.6 million.</p><p>In New York, the rebound has been stronger. On Wall Street, where numerous executives have expressed sharp impatience with remote work—David Solomon, the C.E.O. of Goldman Sachs, has called it an “aberration” that undercuts the company’s “collaborative apprenticeship culture”—foot traffic has returned to eighty per cent of its pre-pandemic level. But on Mondays and Fridays many Manhattan towers become as sparsely populated as an Edward Hopper painting. Some company accountants have started to see the rental of large office spaces—which in New York can cost more than three hundred dollars per square foot—as a colossal waste. In lower Manhattan, major renters such as <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tag/spotify">Spotify</a> and Meta have begun shrinking their footprints, vacating entire floors that once bustled with employees. For the past three years, about twenty-two per cent of office space in New York has gone unrented—that’s a hundred million vacant square feet, the equivalent of nearly thirty-five Empire State Buildings. For the owners of half-empty towers, it’s become increasingly apparent that a new financial strategy is needed.</p><p>Berman has helped show desperate office-tower owners a way out. Although fewer people may want to work in Manhattan, more than enough still want to live there. The over-all vacancy rate for apartments in the city is now 1.4 per cent—the tightest market in fifty years. The reasons that the city’s work and residential fortunes have not moved in step are various. “There is only one New York,” Berman told me. “Culture, diversity, business, technology, medicine, education—all in one small island.” New York remains a place where many ambitious young people go to start their careers, if not to stay, and this demographic is ideal for the hotel-style conversions for which office towers are most suitable. Moreover, Berman said, “young people are social—they don’t want to sit in the middle of a forest on a Zoom call.”</p><p>Converting offices into apartments won’t be a panacea for New York’s real-estate titans: there is simply too much square footage that is going unused, and this will be a problem as long as companies continue switching to smaller premises. Berman told me, “If we ultimately absorb twenty per cent of the office space, that would be optimistic.” But, he added, conversions will energize neighborhoods that otherwise would be among the worst hit, like the financial district. There, Berman foresees apartments replacing half the empty offices.</p><p>The tower at 55 Broad Street has spent most of its existence as an unlovable building in an unlivable neighborhood. In the Art Deco era, the architectural firm founded by Emery Roth was an innovator—it designed the San Remo and the Beresford apartment buildings, on Central Park West—but by the late nineteen-sixties it was known for maximizing rentable office space above all else. At 55 Broad, which is right around the corner from the Stock Exchange, two adjoining ten-story structures came down to make way for a much taller new building. It was a time of rapid growth on Wall Street—between 1958 and 1973, the amount of office space downtown doubled. The design ethos was “do your own thing.” “This is not the Renaissance, or an age of uniform standards of beautiful buildings,” a member of the City Planning Commission <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1973/06/08/archives/innovative-design-and-planning-take-shape-in-lower-manhattan.html">explained to the <em>Times</em></a> in 1973. “No one agrees on anything.”</p><p>The result at 55 Broad was a dark curtain-wall tower with windows and brown panels spaced between thick steel pinstripes. Deep rectangular floors were set back every ten stories, creating a three-tiered wedding cake. Two renovations followed over the decades, but the building remained what it had always been: a dull stack of boxes.</p><p>Shortly after the Rudins built the tower, they attracted as its anchor tenant Goldman Sachs, which was then in a period of wild ascent. Four years after the building opened, a <em>Times</em> reporter dropped by Goldman and excitedly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1971/07/11/archives/goldman-sachs-investment-banker-expands-into-new-markets.html">described</a> an “assemblage of young men with longish haircuts and bright colored shirts” on a trading floor that “rips with action.” Goldman was so successful that it eventually built its own building, two blocks south, leaving 55 Broad half empty. In 1985, Drexel Burnham Lambert, the firm that pioneered the junk bond, moved in. Within five years, it had fallen under indictment and gone bankrupt, forcing the Rudins to scramble again. The family spent millions to make 55 Broad into a state-of-the-art tech hub, borrowing strategies from “Being Digital,” by the nineties tech guru Nicholas Negroponte. Broadband was installed on every floor, and for a time the mid-century structure was “one of the most wired in the world,” according to <em>Forbes</em>. This incarnation lasted until the dot-com bust of 2000, when many of 55 Broad’s tenants went under or moved out. In the next decade, terabytes replaced gigabytes, and the number of servers that a cutting-edge tech firm needed could have taken up an entire warehouse. In 2014, plans were leaked for a proposed fifty-three-story replacement at 55 Broad, but it was never built. A lot of time and money is required to safely dismantle a thirty-story tower on a narrow, busy street.</p><p>Six years later, the pandemic hollowed out the city, particularly the business districts. By July, 2023, the Rudins had concluded that 55 Broad—then only sixty per cent rented—had no future as an office tower. They sold most of their interest in the building to Berman, keeping a small part so they could observe how he handled conversions. (Silverstein Properties, which rebuilt the World Trade Center, also became a partner in the project.) The decision to convert to residential was a hard one for the Rudins. “We don’t like selling our buildings,” Bill Rudin, one of the chairs of the family’s company, told me. “That’s kind of a mantra for us.” The opportunity to learn from Berman was a big factor: “We wanted to see the maestro, like a front-row seat to see Leonard Bernstein.”</p><figure><p><span><div data-attr-viewport-monitor=""><a data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a28880&quot;}" href="https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a28880" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><picture></picture></a><p><span>“Let me read to you from a recently fictionalized version of the procedure&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ”</span></p><p><span>Cartoon by P. C. Vey</span></p></div></span></p></figure><p>The sale price for 55 Broad was $172.5 million. The construction loan was set at two hundred and twenty million dollars. The total cost of the project—nearly four hundred million dollars—was considerable, but replacing the office tower with a new building, Berman told me, would have cost “well over six hundred million.” (Upgrading it in the hope of attracting new office tenants, according to Berman, would have cost roughly eighty million dollars.) And, because of zoning reforms, no new building would be allowed to overwhelm a Manhattan street the way the hulking towers of the postwar period did. A developer who constructed a tower the same height as 55 Broad would likely have to sacrifice twenty per cent of the rentable space.</p><p>Early in the conversion process, Berman’s construction team removed the fluorescent-tube lighting and the dropped PVC ceilings. Then workers knocked down the drywall that had once delineated corner offices, windowless offices, rest rooms, mop closets. “We do a very thorough gut renovation,” Berman told me. “We literally take everything out.” At 55 Broad, the result was nearly four hundred thousand square feet of raw space, with a potential to generate more than thirty million dollars in rental income annually. But Berman still had a major puzzle to solve: If no one wanted to work in a glum, out-of-date building, why would anyone want to live there?</p><p>In the lobby at 55 Broad, Berman pressed the Up button. “This building is <em>way</em> over-elevatored,” he said. Soon, five elevators would be torn out. Apartment buildings, he explained, generally need fewer than half the elevators that office buildings do. “Residents don’t mind waiting twenty seconds more for the elevator,” he said.</p><p>A visit to the sixth floor offered a bleak sight—it was an empty, dark space half the size of a football field, interrupted only by steel support beams and rusted copper waste pipes. The floor was unsealed concrete, and transverse beams along the ceiling were coated with intumescent paint, a fire-resistant covering that looks like bubbling-hot marshmallow. When I stood at the center of the building, the windows were so far away that they looked almost like portholes.</p><p>Berman gave me a detailed tour of the thirteenth floor. In his business, a crucial metric for turning a profit is the time lag between borrowing construction money and renting out units. So he works fast. Just four months had passed since Berman, Silverstein, and Rudin had closed their deal, but the thirteenth floor already felt like part of a new apartment complex. Workers were measuring, drilling, staple-gunning. Metal track had been laid down where new walls would go, and a few drywall panels had already been installed—they were covered in a playful-looking purple glaze, to make them resistant to mold. “It’s a little bit more expensive,” Berman said. “But we don’t want any issues down the road.” On one piece of drywall, “Apt. 10” was scratched in pen. There was even a handsome tub in a bathroom without walls, like a guest who’d arrived too early for a party.</p><p>Renters are now used to the layouts of chain hotels, where there’s one window by the bed, so Berman’s bathrooms and kitchens didn’t need to be sunny, and the kitchens could have a minimal footprint. “Our demographic doesn’t cook,” he said. He referred to the other rooms without windows as “home offices.” Now that working from home was common, I observed, such spaces were likely to get a lot of use. He smiled, then said that many would wind up as bedrooms. This is technically forbidden, because in New York City every bedroom must have a window that can be opened, but it’s a widespread practice nonetheless. Berman laid out a rental scenario: “Imagine two or three Goldman Sachs associates who came to New York just after college and want a little bit more spending money.” (In real-estate ads, a one-bedroom with a windowless office is often called a “convertible two-bedroom.”)</p><p>Berman told me that he could repurpose any office building to residential if the sale price was right. But he acknowledged that 55 Broad posed special challenges. Until the mid-twenty-tens, office-tower conversions in Manhattan mostly involved prewar buildings. These had narrow, smaller floors that divided easily into apartments, and because they were built before air-conditioning they often had courtyards or ventilation shafts. You therefore didn’t have to create odd layouts to give bedrooms some sun. (Natural light tends to peter out about thirty feet into a building’s interior.) Prewar buildings were also full of setbacks, which could become private terraces, and they had oak-panelled elevators that felt homey. I had recently visited the first such building to undergo a major office-to-residence conversion in the financial district, 55 Liberty Street, which long served as the headquarters of Sinclair Oil Corporation. An architect named Joseph Pell Lombardi had converted the building in 1980. I checked out the apartment of one of the first purchasers, on the twenty-third floor. The view was magnificent in three directions, the vista broken only by the gargoyles that the original architect, Henry Ives Cobb, had mounted on the Gothic Revival façade. Looking down from one window, I saw the august Federal Reserve Bank, with its vaults full of gold bars. The view matched the fantasy we all have of living in New York. As the architect Robert&nbsp;A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;Stern told the <em>Times</em> in 1996, “Who doesn’t want to live in a skyscraper? Everybody in movies lives in apartments on the top of Manhattan.”</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>But few towers like 55 Liberty remain available for conversion in the financial district. What are left are postwar structures—many with deep, dark interiors, low ceilings, and scant visual appeal. Berman did what he could to add comfort to such buildings while holding on to his wallet. He could repurpose extra elevator shafts as garbage chutes, for example. In one building, he turned elevator-shaft spaces into foyers for a line of apartments.</p><p>The double-height mechanical floor of 55 Broad, which once contained giant heating and cooling systems, would be turned into two floors of apartments. Residents would be provided with compact <em>HVAC</em> units under certain windows, as in a motel. These units required much less space than the old systems, and were far more energy-efficient. Berman noted that 55 Broad would be the first all-electric, emission-free apartment building in Manhattan. This was not only environmentally beneficial; it also saved him the cost of inserting thousands of feet of piping into concrete floors. It was but one example of how Berman’s monetary interest and the common good conveniently aligned. We looked out a window at an adjacent nondescript office building, and he saw prey. “That’s going to be that way for maybe three to five more years,” he predicted. “That building will be converted, too.”</p><p>Adaptive reuse is a form of recycling, a point that Berman often makes. According to a recent paper by the National Bureau of Economic Research, converting an out-of-date office building into an apartment complex can increase its energy efficiency by as much as eighty per cent. (In a residential building, not everyone blasts the air-conditioning 24/7.) According to <a data-offer-url="https://www.arup.com/news-and-events/study-estimates-carbon-savings-from-office-to-residential-conversion" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.arup.com/news-and-events/study-estimates-carbon-savings-from-office-to-residential-conversion&quot;}" href="https://www.arup.com/news-and-events/study-estimates-carbon-savings-from-office-to-residential-conversion" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a report</a> by the Arup Group, an engineering firm, converting a Manhattan office tower releases, on average, less than half the carbon that building one from scratch does.</p><p>As expensive as these projects may seem, the cheaper cost of repurposing an old building can allow rental prices to be set lower than they would be in a new one. Berman estimated the minimum monthly rent for a studio apartment in a new lower-Manhattan building at well over four thousand dollars, whereas a comparable apartment in 55 Broad will go for about thirty-five hundred. Although this is a considerable sum for one person, it’s not especially expensive by Manhattan standards, and, as Berman acknowledged, many of his units will end up being shared.</p><p>He stressed to me that he is not particularly interested in what goes on inside the apartments, or in what the tenant experience is like. “A renter is <em>not</em> a condominium owner,” he told me several times. He isn’t trying to re-create 443&nbsp;Greenwich Street, his celebrity-friendly condo development, with its wine cellar and tiled hammam. “Our profile is a young person,” he said. “Maybe twenty-four, twenty-five, who stays one or two years, maybe three. They’re not committing.” His clients are in the city-hopping phase of life: “&nbsp;‘O.K., next year, the year is up and I’m going because I need to be in Boston, or I need to be in Chicago, or I’m going to San Francisco.’&nbsp;” Berman had considered improving 55&nbsp;Broad’s dated façade, but decided that it was money poorly spent. “Renters pay less attention to these things,” he said.</p><p>New York renters don’t have much choice, anyway. “We’ve never had this kind of imbalance between demand and supply before,” Berman said, with the pleasure of a person who likes his odds. The vacancy rate in the five or so buildings that he currently owns is about one and a half per cent. He estimated that all the units at 55 Broad would be rented within six months of going on the market.</p><p>A few of Berman’s redevelopment schemes have been more architecturally adventurous. In 2017, he worked with Avinash Malhotra to convert 180 Water Street, also in the financial district. The building, like 55 Broad, was a thick rectangular slab designed by Emery Roth &amp; Sons, and had interior spaces more than seventy feet long. Berman could have rented out these extra-long apartments as they were, but instead he decided to remove the core of the building, where mechanical equipment was taking up space, thereby creating a courtyard and cutting the apartment layouts down to normal length. Though such a restructuring had never been tried before, he took the risk, at a cost of several million dollars. The result gave tenants more light, he said, but that was incidental. New York City law permitted him to add the removed square footage to the top of the building—he gained four floors and a roof with a pool. “If I couldn’t have done that, I wouldn’t have had cost-efficient units,” he said.</p><p>The architects for 55 Broad are John Cetra and his spouse and professional partner, Nancy J. Ruddy. They are well respected in the industry, but they are not starchitects, a type that Berman has no time for. “A young-professional renter isn’t going to pay me more money because my building was designed by Norman Foster,” he told me. One day, Cetra and Ruddy met me at 55 Broad. Cetra described the back-and-forth that he and Berman have on their projects. (55 Broad is their sixth.) Berman sketches out a plan first, then passes it to Cetra. “He wants to make it more efficient,” Cetra said. “I want to make it a little better. ‘Nathan, let’s give this foyer a <em>bit</em> more room.’&nbsp;”</p><p>Whereas Berman focusses on the architect Cass Gilbert’s definition of the skyscraper as a “machine that makes the land pay,” Cetra and Ruddy emphasize pleasure. Cetra showed me his floor plan for 55 Broad: apartments curled around apartments like frolicsome seals. He explained that he and Ruddy always sought the “wow factor,” adding, “Ideally, in as many apartments as you can, when you open the door you see light and you walk toward light.” Shiny wood floors would have heightened this effect, but, Cetra noted a bit sheepishly, the floors at 55 Broad would be covered in something called “vinyl plank flooring.” Wood scuffs too easily in a building where people are constantly moving in and out, and, Cetra said, vinyl flooring was getting better. “They’re able to create patterns that don’t repeat,” he said.</p><p>Ruddy said that it was fun to fit apartment layouts into the constraints set by an office tower’s shape—each unit had “the intricacy of a watch.” She recounted a notable success for which they’d won an award. In 2014, while converting the former Flatotel, on Fifty-second Street, into condos, they had reconfigured an old loading dock—a concrete area where trucks parked and dumpsters were stored—into a new mid-block entrance. “We created this sort of magical lobby out of it,” Ruddy said. “I don’t think anyone had ever converted a loading dock before.”</p><p>Cetra jabbed at his floor plan for 55 Broad to amplify the point: “If this were a new building, every one-bedroom would be exactly the same. But look here. This is a one-bedroom, that’s a studio, that’s a one-bedroom studio, and every one has different proportions.” (A resident of 20 Broad Street, an earlier project that Cetra and Ruddy developed with Berman, complained to Bloomberg News last year about her studio: “It was a very awkward space. It wasn’t square, it wasn’t a rectangle, it had all kinds of bizarre edges and weird corners.”)</p><p>One feature would be standard at 55 Broad: a washer and dryer. “People do their laundry in their pajamas or their underwear while they’re watching television,” Ruddy explained. In the basement, public space that might otherwise be devoted to a large communal laundry room would be aimed at helping tenants meet one another. Small apartments make people want amenities, and amenities make people accept small apartments. The new generation expects post-college life to resemble college. “We’re in an amenities war,” Ruddy said. All the buildings converted in the financial district are full of co-working spaces, gyms, and plush couches.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>One of Cetra and Ruddy’s signature moves, they told me, is to adorn a public space with a modular shelving unit that contains small sculptures and ceramics that “feel like they could have been picked up on a trip overseas.” The architects also include a pile of art books—“Jazzlife,” “Helmut Newton: Work,” a book of Ai Weiwei’s installations. I objected that these seemed like the sorts of books people never actually read, but they disagreed. Tenants did pull them down. In fact, Cetra and Ruddy told me, the books at AVA DoBro, a new apartment building in downtown Brooklyn that they had designed, once disappeared entirely. “It turned out it was a construction worker who had grown up without books,” Ruddy said. “So I replaced them.”</p><p>“They’re good books,” Cetra added.</p><figure><p><span><div data-attr-viewport-monitor=""><a data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a27105&quot;}" href="https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a27105" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><picture></picture></a><p><span>“For the last time—because it’s relaxing and romantic!”</span></p><p><span>Cartoon by Sofia Warren</span></p></div></span></p></figure><p>We went to 55 Broad’s roof, where we stood in front of a long, empty concrete pit. Ruddy pulled out an iPad to show me a rendering of a future pool: eleven by forty-five feet, set off by a dozen deck chairs facing east and a tasteful border of shrubs to increase, as Ruddy said, “connectivity with nature.” There was what looked to me like a pool house but turned out to be “an indoor-outdoor working space.”</p><p>The 55 Broad tower is four hundred feet tall, but in the financial district that makes it midsize. I pointed out that remnant workers in the neighboring towers could easily peek out their office windows and observe whatever action was ripping on 55 Broad’s rooftop. Cetra said, “That’s part of the fun!”</p><p>In the late seventies, my father and mother, an Upper West Side couple, separated. My father, a corporate lawyer, had long worked at 77 Water Street, a steel-and-glass-curtain edifice, designed by Emery Roth, that still functions as an office building. A few years later, he moved into a nearby one-bedroom apartment, in one of the first converted office towers. It was a prewar building, and the impressive lobby made you feel as though you were heading for an appointment with Mr. Morgan. For my father, the short walk to work, after a professional lifetime of taking the 2 or 3 train up and down Manhattan’s spine, was a pleasure. The apartment had a kitchen he didn’t use, and it was on a high floor. On the nights I stayed with him, we would look out at neighboring towers’ brightly illuminated interiors, the cleaners slowly advancing through each floor, emptying the wastebaskets. He told me that he liked the feeling of being a lumberjack going to sleep in the middle of his forest.</p><p>Back then, there were no restaurants or stores open after business hours, not even a Blimpie. Joseph Pell Lombardi’s son, Michael, who grew up at 55 Liberty Street—the building next to the Federal Reserve—also remembers the streets being empty at night, with guards moving pallets of gold bars. “It all seemed incredibly casual,” Michael remembered. “There was no one around, only me, a kid, imagining how easy it would be just to take one of them.”</p><p>Census figures from 1970 show that just eight hundred and thirty-three people lived south of Chambers Street. By the time I began visiting my father’s place, there were more—but not many. “The jury is still out,” Henry Robbins, an expert on real-estate trends, told the <em>Times</em> in 1996, in an article about living in the financial district. “The area dies at night. It needs a neighborhood, a community.”</p><p>Thanks in part to Berman, the financial district now has enough population density to feel like a proper New York neighborhood. His office at 40 Wall Street is on the seventeenth floor, and he can see five of his converted towers out the window. Within just a few blocks of 55 Broad, he has turned 20 Exchange Place, 63 Wall Street, 67 Wall Street, 180&nbsp;Water Street, and 20 Broad Street into apartment buildings. He is currently working on 25 Water Street, the former headquarters of J. P. Morgan, which, after the Pfizer building, will be the second-largest conversion to date in the United States, with Cetra and Ruddy helping him design thirteen hundred units. <em>Crain’s New York Business</em> has called Berman “the king of FiDi.”</p><p>He enjoys his stature as a local potentate. He began his conversion business in the late nineties, after receiving an eighty-thousand-dollar loan from his father-in-law. For a time, Berman was an outlier as a developer, focussing on a market that others found too small or insufficiently profitable. Now he is turning away projects. David Marks, the executive at Silverstein Properties who is developing 55 Broad Street with Berman, said, “For many years—and I’m quoting Nathan—he was the quirky monster that no one really understood, and now he’s the prettiest girl on the dance floor and everyone wants a dance with him.” Berman can decide almost instantly—just by knowing the age and the location of a building and by glancing at Google Earth—if the place is ripe for conversion. “If the price per pound is right, I say, ‘Let’s go,’&nbsp;” he said.</p><p>Berman, who was born in Ukraine and came to New York at the age of fourteen, is the child of a Holocaust survivor, and the niche he occupies in the city’s real-estate ecology makes sense for an immigrant with a mistrust of government. He focusses only on buildings built before certain years—1977 below Murray Street, and 1961 for the rest of Manhattan—because they can be converted without special variances. (Conversions have long been restricted in Manhattan because sudden population surges in residential neighborhoods can crowd schools and overwhelm public transport.) “Life is short,” he told me. “I don’t want to wait two or three years for rezoning.” A current zoning-change proposal, which Mayor Eric Adams supports, would allow any building in New York built before 1990 to be converted. It would add to the pool of potential apartments nearly as much office space as there is in all of Philadelphia. Berman hopes that the zoning change will become law by the end of the year.</p><p>After we left 55 Broad, Berman took me on a tour of two of his other properties. We started down the street, at 20 Broad, once a part of the Stock Exchange. We briefly visited an apartment, but the showpiece was the sub-lobby level. There was a commercial-size gym replete with punching bags, elliptical trainers, free-weight racks, and rows of treadmills. Another room held pool tables, and a third was a library graced with one of Cetra and Ruddy’s modular shelving units. Nobody seemed older than thirty-five. Down the hall was a vault with heavy iron bars where bonds had once been stored. Rather than pull the huge structure out, Cetra and Ruddy had set up a co-working space in it. (“Tenants sometimes play poker there now.”) As we left, Berman took the massive door and swung it on its massive hinges, eager to show me that it still worked.</p><p>We walked down Beaver and Pearl Streets to 180 Water Street, the building from which Berman had removed the core. At the entrance, he said, “I will challenge you to show me any elements in this interior where you can point out and say, ‘Gee, that’s really from the office period.’&nbsp;” I couldn’t. He boasted that he’d never lost that bet. In the elevator, we met a young resident. She had a dog and said that she had been in the building for more than five years. Berman seemed disappointed.</p><p>On the twelfth floor, near another modular shelving unit, there was a bright-white machine labelled “Tulu: Your Smart Rental Store.” Using your phone, you could rent household items like a toaster or a vacuum cleaner, or buy something you’d run out of: tampons, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/humor/daily-shouts/substitutes-for-your-tide-pod-craving">Tide Pods,</a> Doritos. It was a clever way to both justify small closets—“Nathan believes in <em>very</em> compact closets,” Ruddy told me—and monetize how people live now. “These people want to snack at night,” Berman said.</p><p>Afterward, I walked out into the early FiDi night. I turned onto Exchange Place, where I passed crowds of tourists taking pictures of Kristen Visbal’s “Fearless Girl” statue. Various restaurants were filling up, from beer halls like Trinity Place to steak houses like the recently renovated Delmonico’s. Stone Street was now a sort of food court, and I could have picked up groceries at a Whole Foods just north of Exchange Place. (My father would have had to go to the Village to get groceries, if he’d wanted any.) The street life died out at Chambers Street, where government offices stood dark and empty. It was as if the original Dutch settlement had been re-created, back when Wall Street had a wall.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>In a 2022 Glassdoor post, a user called McKinsey Consultant asked, “Should I live in FiDi?” The responses included a lot of cheering for the rooftop pools and the great views. But a user called IBM1 advised living somewhere else. “It’s such a soulless neighborhood,” IBM1 wrote. “Don’t be swayed by the ultra luxe buildings.” It’s true that FiDi remains on the sterile side. It could use some parks, and its inhabitants seem either new to the island or temporary. All those amenities in the buildings keep people within their confines; if you have a Tulu dispensing machine in your basement, who needs to drop by a local hardware store or a pharmacy?</p><p>All the same, more than thirty thousand people now live in FiDi—and at least some of them have begun to see it as a permanent home. Berman told me that, whereas more than half of his renters used to be apartment sharers, he expected the percentage at 55 Broad Street to be closer to fifteen. This suggested to him that families were moving in. He added that he recently ripped out a Ping-Pong room at 180 Water and turned it into a children’s play space. “We have sixty children in the building!” he said, amazed. One was his grandson. His son, who is the No. 2 at the firm, and his daughter-in-law moved in five years ago. “They never left,” Berman said.&nbsp;♦</p></div></div>]]></description>
