<section id="introduction">
<h2 data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>We <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Michael%27s_line#:~:text=The%20aligned%20sites%20are%20almost,Stella%20Maris%20Monastery%3B%20although%20the">read on wikipedia</a> that there are 7 famous Cathedrals built across the past centuries, all related to Saint Michael and all aligned on a straight line.</p>
<p>Being more like Saint Thomas than Saint Michael, we say that if we do not see we do not believe.</p>
<p>So we consider the perfect alignment as our research hypothesis, and we proceed as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Collect the dataset of the cathedrals via manual segmentation of the map.</li>
<li>Compute the geodesic line (on a spherical model of the earth) between the first and the last cathedral.
<ul>
<li>draw a geodesic line on the surface of a sphere.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Compute the distance between the cathedrals and the geodesic line connecting the first and the last one.
<ul>
<li>compute the distance between a point and a line on the sphere.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>This methodology has a couple of flaws:</p>
<ul>
<li>The spherical model is an approximation of the surface of the earth.</li>
<li>The line is between the first and the last cathedrals as ground truth would bias the result for towards the misalignment of these two. A single line that minimizes the distances between all the cathedrals would reduce the overall error.</li>
</ul>
<p>We start the analysis nonetheless with these two limitations in mind and we see what happens, before deciding where to go next.</p>

<h2 data-anchor-id="compute-the-geodesic-line-between-the-first-and-the-last-cathedral">Compute the geodesic line between the first and the last cathedral</h2>
<p>The goal is to compute the geodesic line between the first and the last point, and then computing the distance between all the other 5 cathedrals and the line.</p>
<p>As it turns out, estimating the distance between a point and a line on the sphere does not require to have a “drawable” model of the line. Lets first face the problem of:</p>
<section id="drawing-a-geodesic-line-on-the-surface-of-a-sphere">
<h3 data-anchor-id="drawing-a-geodesic-line-on-the-surface-of-a-sphere">Drawing a geodesic line on the surface of a sphere</h3>
<p>Given two points <span>\(P_1 = (\text{rad}(\text{Lon}_1), \text{rad}(\text{lat}_1)) = (\theta_1, \phi_1)\)</span> and <span>\(P_N = (\text{rad}(\text{Lon}_N), \text{rad}(\text{lat}_N)) = (\theta_N, \phi_N)\)</span>, for <span>\(N\)</span> power of two, we can find the geodesic of the sphere with a recursive method on the geodesic midpoint (and this is why we wanted <span>\(N\)</span> to be a power of two).</p>
<p>The geodesic midpoint between <span>\(P_1\)</span> and <span>\(P_N\)</span>, is indicated with <span>\[
P_{N/2} = \mathcal{M}^{\mathbb{S}^2}(P_{1}, P_{N})
\]</span> and it is simply found as the intersection between the line passing through the origin and the midpoint of <span>\(P_{1}\)</span> and <span>\(P_{N}\)</span> in the 3D space, indicated with <span>\(\mathcal{M}^{\mathbb{R}^3}(P_{1}, P_{N})\)</span>, and the sphere <span>\(\mathbb{S}^2\)</span>.</p>
<p>To compute the midpoint we then need to go from the sphere to the 3D space and from the 3D space to the projection on the sphere. Let <span>\[
\iota: \mathbb{S}^2 \rightarrow  \mathbb{R}^3
\]</span> be the projection from the sphere coordinates <span>\((\theta, \varphi)\)</span> to the 3D space, defined as: <span>\[
\iota(\theta, \varphi) = \begin{cases}
       x = R \cos(\varphi) \cos(\theta)\\
       y = R \cos(\varphi) \sin(\theta)\\
       z = R \sin(\varphi)\\
     \end{cases}
\]</span> Note that to respect the lat/lon convention, when <span>\(\varphi=0\)</span> the point <span>\((\theta, 0)\)</span> is on the equator, unlike in most maths text where <span>\((\theta, 0)\)</span> are the poles.</p>
<p>The projection from any point of the 3D space over the 2D sphere, that will serve as inverse of <span>\(\iota\)</span>: <span>\[
\pi: \mathbb{R}^3 \setminus \{\mathbf{0}\} \longrightarrow \mathbb{S}^2
\]</span> is given by: <span>\[
\pi(x, y, z) = \left(\text{arctg}\left(\frac{y}{x}\right), \text{arctg}\left(\frac{z}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}\right)\right)
\]</span> When <span>\(x=0\)</span>: <span>\[
\pi(0, y, z) = \left(\text{sign}(y)\frac{\pi}{2}, \text{arctg}\left(\frac{z}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}\right)\right)
\]</span> and when <span>\(x=y=0\)</span>: <span>\[
\pi(0, 0, z) = \left(0, \text{sign}(z)\frac{\pi}{2} \right)
\]</span> where <span>\(\text{sign}(\eta)\)</span> is the sign function, equal to <span>\(+1\)</span> when <span>\(\eta \geq 0\)</span>, and to <span>\(-1\)</span> when <span>\(\eta &lt; 0\)</span>.</p>
<p>The function defined above are all what is needed to compute the geodesic midpoint on the surface of a sphere: <span>\[
P_{N/2} = \mathcal{M}^{\mathbb{S}^2}(P_{1}, P_{N}) = \pi\left(\frac{\iota(P_{1}) + \iota(P_{N})}{2}\right)
\]</span></p>

<h2 data-anchor-id="distance-between-the-cathedrals-and-the-geodesic-line-connecting-the-first-and-the-last-one.">Distance between the cathedrals and the geodesic line connecting the first and the last one.</h2>
<p>Visually we can see that the cathedrals are not aligned over the geodesics. Let’s measure the sum of the distances between each cathedral and the geodesic. We will use the distance between the bell tower and the geodesics passing through the bell towers of the first and the last cathedrals.</p>

<h3 data-anchor-id="distance-between-a-point-and-a-geodesic-line-on-the-sphere">Distance between a point and a geodesic line on the sphere</h3>
<p>Finding the distance between a point and a line is equivalent to find the projection of the point on the line itself. Using planes we can find the direction of the projection, as a vector, and then we can project it on the sphere with the function <span>\(\pi\)</span> defined above.</p>
<p>Let <span>\(A\)</span> and <span>\(B\)</span> two points on the geodesic line, and <span>\(C\)</span> a point on the sphere, we indicate with <span>\(\mathcal{d}_{\mathbb{S}^2}(C, \overset{\frown}{AB})\)</span> the sought distance between <span>\(C\)</span> and the geodesic passing through <span>\(AB\)</span>. Using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_product">cross product</a> <span>\(\times\)</span> then we can use the following facts:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>\(E = A\times B\)</span> is the vector normal to the plane <span>\(\triangle OAB\)</span>.</li>
<li><span>\(F = C\times E\)</span> is the vector normal to the plane <span>\(\triangle OCA\)</span>, which is also perpendicular to <span>\(\triangle OAB\)</span> and passes through <span>\(C\)</span>.</li>
<li><span>\(G = E\times F\)</span> is the vector belonging to the plane <span>\(\triangle OAB\)</span>, projection of <span>\(C\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The projection of <span>\(G\)</span> on the sphere <span>\(\pi(G)\)</span> is the projection of <span>\(C\)</span> over the geodesic curve <span>\(AB\)</span>, therefore the sought distance is:</p>
<p><span>\[
\mathcal{d}_{\mathbb{S}^2}(C, \overset{\frown}{AB}) = \mathcal{Hav}(C, \pi(G))

<p>The result with a straight line between the first and the last cathedral is more convincing than the previous one, computed with the geodesic line.</p>
<p>Before summing the distances between the line and the bell towers though we can think that this approach of joining the first with the last may not be the optimal one. What if we try to fit the points with linear regression?</p>

<p>We can see that the line computed with linear regression in degrees is closer to the rows of cathedral than it is for the geodesic. Here as well we can compute the average distance in degrees between the line and the bell towers with the function <code>get_dist_deg</code> implemented above, though this distance would not be a “real” distance in any meaningful sense.</p>
<section id="unanswered-question">
<h3 data-anchor-id="unanswered-question">Unanswered question</h3>
<p>Now we know that the cathedrals are not aligned on the geodesic. Are they “almost” aligned on the mercator projection by accident or was there a plan?</p>
<p>Did the builders knew the earth was round? Or did they followed some method that is today lost, possibly based on the position of a start or a constellation, resulting in an alignment on the Mercator projection?</p>
<p>Certainly 7 cathedrals are too many to be a coincidence, and more historical investigations about the past knowledge would be at this point an interesting project.</p>

<ul>
<li>Can you draw the geodesic lines between each cathedral the the geodesic between the first and the last one?</li>
<li>To compute the distance between cathedrals we considered the geolocation of the tower bell. What about using the closest wall?</li>
<li>Geodesics linear regression?</li>
<li>Trace the geodesic line with Vincenty’s formula with the same recursive algorithm?</li>
</ul>

<p><span>It’s literally faster than a speeding bullet.</span></p>

<p>Since the dawn of humanity, we have strived to put nine squares of the same color onto a single side of a cube, which was really difficult prior to 1974 when <a href="https://soranews24.com/2022/04/06/japanese-company-develops-possibly-the-most-difficult-ever-rubiks-cube-impossible/">the Rubik’s Cube</a> was invented. But once that happened it became a race to accomplish it ever faster and <a href="https://soranews24.com/2020/02/19/cool-automated-rubiks-cube-found-at-makers-faire-floats-solves-itself-blows-our-minds/">more stylishly</a> which has culminated in <strong>TOKUFASTbot</strong> by Mitsubishi Electric.</p>
<p>This robot connects a servo motor to each side of the cube, <strong>capable of turning 90 degrees in 0.009 seconds</strong>. It’s also highly responsive to an AI color-identifying algorithm to solve the cube in record time.</p>
<p><span><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/59qgzzSD1tk?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en-US&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox"></iframe></span></p>
<p>The above video demonstration shows a cube being solved in 0.204 seconds, but when Guinness World Records was called in to judge an attempt to break the existing record of 0.38 seconds different standards were set. As a result, <strong>TOKUFASTbot earned an official fastest time of 0.305 seconds which still handily beat the previous record</strong>.</p>
<p><span>▼ </span>A video of the record-breaking run</p>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-lang="en" data-dnt="true" data-partner="jetpack"><p lang="ja" dir="ltr">正式発表です🌟三菱電機のチームがギネス世界記録「パズルキューブを最速で解くロボット」を更新㊗タイムはなんと0.305秒！記録達成、本当におめでとうございます🎉🎉🎉 <a href="https://t.co/1X56qxR7RI">pic.twitter.com/1X56qxR7RI</a></p>— ギネス世界記録 (@GWRJapan) <a href="https://twitter.com/GWRJapan/status/1793488307135099037?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 23, 2024</a></blockquote>
<p>While the machine is extremely impressive, online comments were equally astounded by the cube which could withstand such fast turning.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“They must have put a lot of oil on that cube.”</em><br>
<em>“Anything faster than this will require ways of reducing friction in the cube.”</em><br>
<em>“I’ve come to terms with the fact I’ll never solve one in my lifetime.”</em><br>
<em>“So, what can they do with this?”</em><br>
<em>“Precise motor control is the backbone of manufacturing.”</em><br>
<em>“It’s a little faster than me.”</em><br>
<em>“It must be difficult to turn 90 degrees that fast and stop in exactly the right place.”</em><br>
<em>“They must have broken a lot of Rubik’s Cubes to get to this point.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to Guinness, the first attempt was thwarted by a cube jam, and judging by the video there doesn’t seem to be any of the rounded corners one might find on a speed cube used by competitive cubers. On the other hand, the official record is called “Fastest Robot to Solve a Puzzle Cube” which suggests a branded Rubik’s Cube may not have been used.</p>
<p><span>▼ </span>Mitsubishi also released a series of short videos comparing the speed of their machine to everyday instantaneous occurrences like a coffee spilling or soap bubble popping.</p>

<p>It would be nice to know the cube specs, but it doesn’t change the fact that this is quite an accomplishment. I especially find its elegant precision rather soothing to watch.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://mkukri.xyz/2024/06/01/tpm-gpio-fail.html">https://mkukri.xyz/2024/06/01/tpm-gpio-fail.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40593540">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In this article I demonstrate a software attack that allows an operating system
to set the PCRs of a discrete TPM device to arbitrary values and unseal any
secret that uses a PCR based sealing policy (such as disk encryption keys used by
unattended unlock TPM FDE schemes).</p>
<h2>Previous work</h2>
<p>We've previously demonstrated a trivial hardware attack <a href="https://hacky.solutions/blog/2024/02/tpm-attack">here</a>, that attack allowed an attacker with physical access to achieve
a clean TPM state by booting any operating system, then briefly grounding the reset pin
of a discrete TPM device with a pair of tweezers while the system was running.</p>
<p>Afterwards the attacker controlled operating system will still be executing, but now with
a "clean" TPM, allowing the attacker to perform arbitrary extend operations and derive
any desired PCR values.</p>
<p>The attack described here will achieve the same aim, but without the need to physically
manipulate pins on the device.</p>
<h2>Software attack</h2>
<p>On Intel platforms, discrete TPM devices are connected to the PCH (Platform Controller Hub)
via some bus such as LPC or eSPI. These buses have a reset pin (PLTRST#), controlling the reset
state of devices. Normally this reset pin is controlled by hardware, and is only activated
on system reset, meaning that as per the TPM specification the TPM device will only be cleared
upon system reset.</p>
<p>Many pins on the PCH package, including the pins used by the LPC and eSPI buses, are multi use,
meaning they are shared with multiple IP blocks (aka logical components of an integrated circuit).
Software can select which "function" each pin is assigned to.
Among these is the GPIO (General Purpose Input Output) block, which is used to give software direct
control over a pin's state.</p>
<p>An operating system can (ab)use this by re-assigning the pin used for PLTRST# to the GPIO block,
and then driving it's value low from software via the GPIO block for some amount of time then
setting it back high. Any devices connected to the bus will react to this identically to "real"
reset request driven by hardware during platform reset.</p>
<p>In case of a TPM device attached to the bus, the above operation will result in the values of
the PCRs of the device being set to a "clean" state.
This then allows the same software that did the GPIO write operation to derive any desired
PCR values similar to the hardware attack, but this time without any physical access to pins on the
mainbaord.</p>
<p>A simple demonstration of the PCR values being cleared via software can be seen here:</p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ayDFTBeiqZA?si=Sq06T_6oxUky1wab" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p>
<p>This can be used to attack TPM FDE schemes (such as BitLocker) in multiple ways, for example:</p>
<ul><li> an attacker with brief physical access to a device can plug in a USB stick, boot the device from
  it, then extract the disk encryption key and encrypted data without any access to device internals;</li><li> on a dual boot device, any operating system (including malware running inside any operating system)
  can access the encryption key and encrypted secrets stored on disk by other operating systems.</li></ul>
<h2>Mitigating the attack</h2>
<p>Fortunately Intel PCHs include a facility that allows boot firmware to lock the configuration of
PCH pins.</p>
<p>Boot firmware can set this lock, and thus preventing any software executing after it, such as
bootloaders and operating system kernels from executing this attack.
Intel claims that their (NDA-only) BIOS writers guide includes guidance on when and how to set
the GPIO lock bits.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the author have not so far managed to locate a device "in the wild" that implements
the lock correctly. The author also has no information whether or not this mechanism is implemented
in proprietary firmware kits such as AMI Aptio or Insyde H2O.</p>
<p>It appears that an implementation of this lock mechanism exists in the open source firmware project coreboot.
Unfortunately the mechanism is broken in its current state on platforms older then Meteor Lake, and most mainboard configurations don't include the correct GPIO definitions, but it is proof that this mechanism was at
least thought of by someone at some point.</p>
<p>Mitigating this attack will require rolling out boot firmware updates to affected devices.</p>
<h2>Attacking BootGuard's measured mode</h2>
<p>Intel BootGuard is a feature provided by Intel platforms that allow boot firmware to be verified
and/or measured by hardware before being handed control of the platform.
One mode of BootGuard is "measurement only", where hardware extends TPM's PCRs with the hash of
boot firmware prior to handing control to it, but otherwise allowing any boot firmware to execute.</p>
<p>When used in conjunction with discrete TPM devices, malicious boot firmware can perform
the attack to reset then forge the measurements that were done by BootGuard prior to boot
firmware execution.</p>
<p>For this attack variant, the boot firmware setting the lock bit is obviously not a valid mitigation.
It was suggested to Intel, that as a mitigation against this variant, some pre-boot firmware platform
component such as the Intel CSME could set the lock bit.</p>
<p>Intel rejected implementing any mitigation against this, arguing that they do not consider this variant a vulnerability in
BootGuard at all, in their words:</p>
<blockquote> As per architecture the Measured Boot mode attack is not a concern. We do have verified boot, in the sense that that the FW that can access the configuration is clearly in the TCB and it is absolutely verified (i.e. Intel authentic FW).</blockquote>
<blockquote> On the other hand, the attack in question he have a concern with, starts by having physical access. In this particular case, I don’t think it is even relevant:</blockquote>
<blockquote> If attacker have physical access, the discrete TPM is an attack surface anyway and even a known attack already. Attacker can use an interposer (just connect the TPM over a different crafted connector, very simple physical attack) and control whatever the TPM is storing regardless of FW intervention/compromise/reflashing. So the issue of the GPIO unlock is only applicable for SW only attack (no physical access).</blockquote>
<p>This is right in a strict sense (and is even minimizing the problem, as the tweezer attack is
much easier to do then invasive attacks such the interposer attack).
For one time disk decryption, the tweezer attack is just as effective, and is arguably faster
to execute then overwriting the platform's flash.</p>
<p>However the author believes that there are scenarios where the GPIO reset attack can still pose problems beyond
existing issues. For instance in as evil housekeeper attack, the device owner would like to detect tampering with boot firmware after leaving the device unattended via verifying the TPM measurements.</p>
<p>Here, the GPIO reset attack can be used by simply overwriting the SPI flash, and then replacing the device.
After this any protection offered by BootGuard measurements would be lost, and the device owner would never know that
the device is running tampered firmware.
In comparison, an interposer attack would be rather invasive and hard to implement in a permanent manner in a device
that the attacker is wanting to return to the victim afterwards.</p>
<h2>Disclosure notes</h2>
<p>This was first disclosed to Intel Product Security privately on the 27th February, 2024.</p>
<p>Intel claims that this vulnerability doesn't directly affect Intel products.
This claim is justified by the statement the NDA-only BIOS writer's guide supposedly
includes guidance for OEMs on how and when to set the GPIO lock bits.</p>
<p>Intel initially claimed that this is firmware vulnerability only affecting MSI products.</p>
<p>This was weird considering that the author never mentioned MSI to Intel.</p>
<p>After some back and forth, Intel said that this vulnerability may affect an
unspecified set of OEM partners, and also said they will to inform their
partners about it and re-inforce their security.</p>
<p>A CVE wasn't assigned by Intel, and the author is unsure if Intel has actually
informed any other party.</p>
<p>A public disclosure date of 1st June was agreed on the 4th of April. This article is being
released in accordance with said disclosure date to bring attention to the issue,
and hopefully a start the process of rolling out mitigations for it.</p>
<h2>Testing your system</h2>
<p>The author intends to implement support for detecting this vulnerability in the chipsec framework,
when done so, link will be included here.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p>The first AVR ATmega microcontroller debuted in 1998 and took the world by storm. In contrast to other embedded 8-bit processors of the era, it required no external components, could run off a wide range of supply voltages, and worked with the GNU C Compiler when others required you to learn assembly or pay for proprietary tools.</p><p>Since then, ATmega MCUs remained the staple of hobby engineering. In recent years, their market position has been challenged by single-board computers and the wi-fi-capable ESP32; still, the AVR architecture remains the go-to option for those who want to get things done without wrangling schedulers or debugging congestion on the Cortex-M AHB.</p><p>Yet, what relatively few ATmega hobbyists realize is that Microchip recently released a revamped series of 8-bit AVR MCUs: AVR DA and DB, along with the more specialized AVR DD and DU. The products are not being marketed to hobbyists. Instead, they’re advertised for automotive and industrial applications. Still, they’re cheaper and better in almost all respects — and just as easy to use.</p><p>The price difference can be stark; for example, if you want a microcontroller with 128 kB of program memory, you can get AVR128DA28 for under $2 a piece; the cheapest older-generation chip with the same amount of flash — ATMEGA1284P — is $6. </p><p>When it comes to architectural improvements, the most universally useful change is that AVR Dx can internally generate clocks up to 24 MHz; the ATmega can only do 8 MHz, and you need external timing to reach 20 MHz. Another nice touch is a single-wire UPDI programming and debugging interface, simplifying PCB layout and saving space. The new chips also feature reduced power consumption, better ADCs and DACs, on-board op-amps, and programmable LUT-based logic units that can implement real-time automation without involving the CPU.</p><p><span>From the software side, the differences are small; you use the same </span><em>avr-gcc</em><span>, </span><em>avr-libc,</em><span> and </span><em>avrdude</em><span> toolchain, and most of the on-die peripherals are configured and operated roughly the same way. AVR Dx is not a drop-in replacement, but porting is a breeze.</span></p><p>To the extent that the semantics differ, the changes are for the better. For example, on the ATmega, you had no C-level idiom for the exceedingly common task of clearing or setting single output pins. Instead, you had to spell it out as read-modify-write operation. You then crossed your fingers and hoped the compiler outputs a single SBI or CBI opcode instead of what your program asked it to do:</p><blockquote><pre><code>void oled_send_cmd(uint8_t cmd) {
  PORTA &amp;= ~_BV(OLED_A_DC);  /* Clear the DC bit  */
  PORTA &amp;= ~_BV(OLED_A_WR);  /* Clear the WR- bit */
  PORTB  = cmd;              /* Prepare command   */
  PORTA |= _BV(OLED_A_WR);   /* Set the WR- bit   */
}</code></pre></blockquote><p>In contrast, on an AVR Dx chip, you have separate “set” and “clear” registers, removing the need for wishful thinking and error-prone Boolean logic. The same function can be rewritten as:</p><blockquote><pre><code>void oled_send_cmd(uint8_t cmd) {
  PORTA.OUTCLR = _BV(OLED_A_DC);  /* Clear the DC bit  */
  PORTA.OUTCLR = _BV(OLED_A_WR);  /* Clear the WR- bit */
  PORTB.OUT    = cmd;             /* Prepare command   */
  PORTA.OUTSET = _BV(OLED_A_WR);  /* Set the WR- bit   */
}</code></pre></blockquote><p><span>Microchip has a </span><a href="https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/Appnotes/Migration-from-megaAVR-to-AVR-DxMCU-Fam-DS00003731A.pdf" rel="">short migration doc</a><span> explaining the differences between the platforms.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-headline="How Online Privacy Is Like Fishing"><p><a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/microsoft">Microsoft</a> recently <u><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/cybersecurity/microsoft-says-it-caught-hackers-china-russia-iran-using-its-ai-tools-2024-02-14/" target="_blank">caught state-backed hackers</a></u> using its generative AI tools to help with their attacks. In the security community, the immediate questions weren’t about how hackers were using the tools (that was utterly predictable), but about how Microsoft figured it out. The natural conclusion was that Microsoft was spying on its AI users, looking for harmful hackers at work.<br></p><p>Some <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39442429" target="_blank">pushed back</a> at characterizing Microsoft’s actions as “spying.” Of <em>course</em> cloud service providers monitor what users are doing. And because we expect Microsoft to be doing something like this, it’s not fair to call it spying.</p><p>We see this argument as an example of our shifting collective expectations of privacy. To understand what’s happening, we can learn from an unlikely source: fish.</p><p>In the mid-20th century, scientists began noticing that the number of fish in the ocean—so vast as to underlie the phrase “There are plenty of fish in the sea”—had started declining rapidly due to overfishing. They had already seen a similar decline in whale populations, when the post-WWII whaling industry nearly drove many species extinct. In whaling and later in commercial fishing, new technology made it easier to find and catch marine creatures in ever greater numbers. Ecologists, specifically those working in fisheries management, began studying how and when certain fish populations had gone into serious decline.</p><p>One scientist, <a href="https://oceans.ubc.ca/2023/05/19/daniel-pauly/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Daniel Pauly</a>, realized that researchers studying fish populations were making a major error when trying to determine acceptable catch size. It wasn’t that scientists didn’t recognize the declining fish populations. It was just that they didn’t realize how significant the decline was. Pauly noted that each generation of scientists had a different baseline to which they compared the current statistics, and that each generation’s baseline was lower than that of the previous one.</p><p>What seems normal to us in the security community is whatever was commonplace at the beginning of our <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/topic/careers/">careers</a>.</p><p>Pauly called this “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shifting_baseline" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">shifting baseline syndrome</a>” in a 1995 paper. The baseline most scientists used was the one that was normal when they began their research careers. By that measure, each subsequent decline wasn’t significant, but the cumulative decline was devastating. Each generation of researchers came of age in a new ecological and technological environment, inadvertently masking an exponential decline.</p><p>Pauly’s insights came too late to help those managing some fisheries. The ocean suffered catastrophes such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collapse_of_the_Atlantic_northwest_cod_fishery" target="_blank">complete collapse</a> of the Northwest Atlantic cod population in the 1990s.</p><p>Internet surveillance, and the resultant loss of privacy, is following the same trajectory. Just as certain fish populations in the world’s oceans have fallen 80 percent, from previously having fallen 80 percent, from previously having fallen 80 percent (ad infinitum), our expectations of privacy have similarly fallen precipitously. The pervasive nature of modern technology makes surveillance easier than ever before, while each successive generation of the public is accustomed to the privacy status quo of their youth. What seems normal to us in the security community is whatever was commonplace at the beginning of our careers.</p><p>Historically, people controlled their computers, and software was standalone. The always-connected cloud-deployment model of software and services flipped the script. Most apps and services are designed to be always-online, feeding usage information back to the company. A consequence of this modern deployment model is that everyone—cynical tech folks and even ordinary users—expects that what you do with modern tech isn’t private. But that’s because the baseline has shifted.</p><p>AI chatbots are the latest incarnation of this phenomenon: They produce output in response to your input, but behind the scenes there’s a complex cloud-based system keeping track of that input—both to improve the service and to <a href="https://about.ads.microsoft.com/en/blog/post/february-2023/the-new-bing-creating-value-for-advertisers" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sell you ads</a>.</p><p>Shifting baselines are at the heart of our collective loss of privacy. The U.S. Supreme Court has long held that our right to privacy depends on whether we have a reasonable <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/expectation_of_privacy" target="_blank">expectation of privacy</a>. But expectation is a slippery thing: It’s subject to shifting baselines.</p><p>The question remains: What now? Fisheries scientists, armed with knowledge of shifting-baseline syndrome, now look at the big picture. They no longer consider relative measures, such as comparing this decade with the last decade. Instead, they take a holistic, ecosystem-wide perspective to see what a healthy marine ecosystem and thus sustainable catch should look like. They then turn these scientifically derived sustainable-catch figures into limits to be codified by regulators.</p><p>In privacy and security, we need to do the same. Instead of comparing to a shifting baseline, we need to step back and look at what a healthy technological ecosystem would look like: one that respects people’s privacy rights while also allowing companies to recoup costs for services they provide. Ultimately, as with fisheries, we need to take a big-picture perspective and be aware of shifting baselines. A scientifically informed and democratic regulatory process is required to preserve a heritage—whether it be the ocean or the Internet—for the next generation.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Researchers recently reported the discovery of a natural protein, named Balon, that can bring a cell’s production of new proteins to a screeching halt. Balon was found in bacteria that hibernate in Arctic permafrost, but it also seems to be made by many other organisms and may be an overlooked mechanism for dormancy throughout the tree of life.</p>
<p>For most life forms, the ability to shut oneself off is a vital part of staying alive. Harsh conditions like lack of food or cold weather can appear out of nowhere. In these dire straits, rather than keel over and die, many organisms have mastered the art of dormancy. They slow down their activity and metabolism. Then, when better times roll back around, they reanimate.</p>
<p>Sitting around in a dormant state is actually the norm for the majority of life on Earth: By some estimates, 60% of all microbial cells are hibernating at any given time. Even in organisms whose entire bodies do not go dormant, like most mammals, some cellular populations within them rest and wait for the best time to activate.</p>
<p>“We live on a dormant planet,” said <a href="https://melnikovlab.com/">Sergey Melnikov</a>, an evolutionary molecular biologist at Newcastle University. “Life is mainly about being asleep.”</p>
<p>But how do cells pull off this feat? Over the years, researchers have discovered a number of “hibernation factors,” proteins that cells use to induce and maintain a dormant state. When a cell detects some kind of adverse condition, like starvation or cold, it produces a suite of hibernation factors to shut its metabolism down.</p>
<p>Some hibernation factors dismantle cellular machinery; others prevent genes from being expressed. The most important ones, however, shut down the ribosome — the cell’s machine for building new proteins. Making proteins accounts for more than <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2014.02.033">50% of energy use</a> in a growing bacterial cell. These hibernation factors throw sand in the gears of the ribosome, preventing it from synthesizing new proteins and thereby saving energy for the needs of basic survival.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, publishing in <em>Nature</em>, researchers reported the discovery of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07041-8">a new hibernation factor</a>, which they have named Balon. The protein is shockingly common: A search for its gene sequence uncovered its presence in 20% of all cataloged bacterial genomes. And it works in a way that molecular biologists had never seen before.</p>

<p>Previously, all known ribosome-disrupting hibernation factors worked passively: They waited for a ribosome to finish building a protein and then prevented it from starting a new one. Balon, however, pulls the emergency brake. It stuffs itself into every ribosome in the cell, even interrupting active ribosomes in the middle of their work. Before Balon, hibernation factors had only been seen in empty ribosomes.</p>
<p>“The Balon paper is amazingly detailed,” said the evolutionary biologist <a href="https://lennonlab.github.io/">Jay Lennon</a>, who studies microbial dormancy at Indiana University and was not involved in the new study. “It will add to our view of how dormancy works.”</p>
<p>Melnikov and his graduate student Karla Helena-Bueno discovered Balon in <em>Psychrobacter urativorans</em>, a cold-adapted bacterium native to frozen soils and harvested from Arctic permafrost. (According to Melnikov, the bacterium was first found infecting a pack of <a href="https://www.ccug.se/strain?id=4982">frozen sausages</a> in the 1970s and then rediscovered by the famed genomicist Craig Venter on a trip to the Arctic.) They study <em>P. urativorans</em> and other unusual microbes to characterize the diversity of protein-building tools used across the spectrum of life and to understand how ribosomes can adapt to extreme environments.</p>
<p>Because dormancy can be triggered by a variety of conditions, including starvation and drought, the scientists pursue this research with a practical goal in mind: “We can probably use this knowledge in order to engineer organisms that can tolerate warmer climates,” Melnikov said, “and therefore withstand climate change.”</p>
<h2><strong>Introducing: Balon</strong></h2>
<p>Helena-Bueno discovered Balon entirely by accident. She was trying to coax <em>P</em>. <em>urativorans </em>to grow happily in the lab. Instead she did the opposite. She left the culture in an ice bucket for too long and managed to cold-shock it. By the time she remembered it was there, the cold-adapted bacteria had gone dormant.</p>
<p>Not wanting to waste the culture, the researchers pursued their original interests anyway. Helena-Bueno extracted the cold-shocked bacteria’s ribosomes and subjected them to cryo-EM. Short for cryogenic electron microscopy, cryo-EM is a technique for <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/supercool-protein-imaging-gets-the-nobel-prize-20171004/">visualizing minuscule biological structures</a> at high resolution. Helena-Bueno saw a protein jammed into the stalled ribosome’s A site — the “door” where amino acids are delivered for the construction of new proteins.</p>
<p>Helena-Bueno and Melnikov didn’t recognize the protein. Indeed, it had never been described before. It bore a similarity to another bacterial protein, one that’s important for disassembling and recycling ribosomal parts, called <a href="https://www.cell.com/trends/biochemical-sciences/abstract/S0968-0004(18)30230-5">Pelota</a> from the Spanish for “ball.” So they named the new protein Balon for a different Spanish word for “ball.”</p>

<p>Balon’s ability to halt the ribosome’s activity in its tracks is a critical adaptation for a microbe under stress, said <a href="https://sites.northwestern.edu/yaplab/">Mee-Ngan Frances Yap</a>, a microbiologist at Northwestern University who wasn’t involved in the work. “When bacteria are actively growing, they produce lots of ribosomes and RNA,” she said. “When they encounter stress, a species might need to shut down translation” of RNA into new proteins to begin conserving energy for a potentially long hibernation period.</p>
<p>Notably, Balon’s mechanism is a reversible process. Unlike other hibernation factors, it can be inserted to stall growth and then quickly ejected like a cassette tape. It enables a cell to rapidly go dormant in an emergency and resuscitate itself just as rapidly to readapt to more favorable conditions.</p>
<p>Balon can do this because it latches on to ribosomes in a unique way. Every ribosomal hibernation factor previously discovered physically blocks the ribosome’s A site, so any protein-making process that’s in progress must be completed before the factor can attach to turn off the ribosome. Balon, on the other hand, binds near but not across the channel, which allows it to come and go regardless of what the ribosome is doing.</p>

<p>Despite Balon’s mechanistic novelty, it’s an exceedingly common protein. Once it was identified, Helena-Bueno and Melnikov found genetic relatives of Balon in upward of 20% of all the bacterial genomes cataloged in public databases. With help from <a href="https://researchexperts.utmb.edu/en/persons/mariia-rybak">Mariia Rybak</a>, a molecular biologist at the University of Texas Medical Branch, they characterized two of these alternate bacterial proteins: one from the human pathogen <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em>, which causes tuberculosis, and another in <em>Thermus thermophilus</em>, which lives in the last place you’d catch <em>P. urativorans</em> — in ultra-hot underwater thermal vents. Both proteins also bind to the ribosome’s A site, suggesting that at least some of these genetic relatives act similarly to Balon in other bacterial species.</p>
<p>Balon is notably absent from <em>Escherichia coli</em> and <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, the two most commonly studied bacteria and the most widely used models for cellular dormancy. By focusing on just a few lab organisms, scientists had missed a widespread hibernation tactic, Helena-Bueno said. “I tried to look into an under-studied corner of nature and happened to find something.”</p>
<h2><strong>Everybody Hibernates </strong></h2>
<p>Every cell needs the ability to go dormant and wait for its moment. The laboratory model bacterium <em>E. coli </em>has five separate modes of hibernating, Melnikov said, each of which on its own is sufficient to enable the microbe to survive a crisis.</p>
<p>“Most microbes are starving,” said <a href="https://ashley17061.wixsite.com/shadelab">Ashley Shade</a>, a microbiologist at the University of Lyon who was not involved in the new study. “They’re existing in a state of want. They’re not doubling. They’re not living their best life.”</p>

<p>But dormancy is also necessary outside periods of starvation. Even in organisms, like most mammals, whose entire bodies do not go completely dormant, individual cellular populations must wait for the best time to activate. <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-idle-egg-cells-defend-their-dna-from-damage-20240513/">Human oocytes lie dormant</a> for decades waiting to be fertilized. Human stem cells are born into the bone marrow and then go quiescent, waiting for the body to call out to them to grow and differentiate. Fibroblasts in nervous tissue, lymphocytes of the immune system, and hepatocytes in the liver all enter dormant, inactive, nondividing phases and reactivate later.</p>
<p>“This is not something that’s unique to bacteria or archaea,” Lennon said. “Every organism in the tree of life has a way of achieving this strategy. They can pause their metabolism.”</p>
<p>Bears <a href="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/living-world/2022/bear-hibernation-more-winters-nap">hibernate</a>. Herpes viruses lysogenize. Worms form a dauer stage. Insects enter diapause. Amphibians aestivate. Birds go into torpor. All of these are words for the exact same thing: a dormant state that organisms can reverse when conditions are favorable.</p>
<p>“Before the invention of hibernation, the only way to live was to keep growing without interruptions,” Melnikov said. “Putting life on pause is a luxury.”</p>
<p>It’s also a type of population-level insurance. Some cells pursue dormancy by detecting environmental changes and responding accordingly. However, many bacteria use a stochastic strategy. “In randomly fluctuating environments, if you don’t go into dormancy sometimes, there’s a chance that the whole population will go extinct” through random encounters with disaster, Lennon said. In even the healthiest, happiest, fastest-growing cultures of <em>E. coli</em>, between 5% and 10% of the cells will nevertheless be dormant. They are the designated survivors who will live should something happen to their more active, vulnerable cousins.</p>

<p>In that sense, dormancy is a survival strategy for global catastrophes. That’s why Helena-Bueno studies hibernation. She’s interested in which species might remain stable despite climate change, which ones might be able to recover, and which cellular processes, like Balon-assisted hibernation, might help.</p>
<p>More fundamentally, Melnikov and Helena-Bueno hope that the discovery of Balon and its ubiquity will help people reframe what is important in life. We all frequently go dormant, and many of us quite enjoy it. “We spend one-third of our life asleep, but we don’t talk about it at all,” Melnikov said. Instead of complaining about what we’re missing when we’re asleep, maybe we can experience it as a process that connects us to all life on Earth, including microbes sleeping deep in the Arctic permafrost.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that 50% is a conservative number at the lowest end of the spectrum.&nbsp; This is assuming that your career is only going to last 10 years.&nbsp; The longer you work, the greater the difference will become over your lifetime.</p>

<p><b>Arguments for Changing Jobs</b></p>
<p><a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personalfinance/2013/09/18/how-much-of-a-pay-raise-can-you-expect-in-2014/2832791/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personalfinance/2013/09/18/how-much-of-a-pay-raise-can-you-expect-in-2014/2832791/" aria-label="The average raise an employee can expect in 2014 is 3%.">The average raise an employee can expect in 2014 is 3%.</a> Even the most underperforming employee can expect a 1.3% raise. The best performers can hope for a 4.5% raise.&nbsp; But, the inflation rate is currently 2.1% calculated based on the Consumer Price Index published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. This means that your raise is actually less than 1%.&nbsp; This is probably sobering enough to make you reach for a drink.</p>
<p>In 2014, the average employee is going to earn less than a 1% raise and there is very little that we can do to change management’s decision. But, we can decide whether we want to stay at a company that is going to give us a raise for less than 1%. The average raise an employee receives for leaving is between a 10% to 20% increase in salary. Obviously, there are extreme cases where people receive upwards of 50%, but this depends on each person’s individual circumstances and industries.</p>





<p>Why are people who jump ship rewarded, when loyal employees are punished for their dedication? The answer is simple. Recessions allow businesses to freeze their payroll and decrease salaries of the newly hired based on “market trends.” These reactions to the recession are understandable, but the problem is that these reactions were meant to be “temporary.” Instead they have become the “norm” in the marketplace. More importantly, we have all become used to hearing about “3% raises” and we’ve accepted it as the new “norm."</p>
<p>John Hollon, former editor of Workforce.com, remembers when “<a href="http://www.tlnt.com/2012/11/08/remember-those-3-salary-increases-now-theyre-the-new-normal/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:http://www.tlnt.com/2012/11/08/remember-those-3-salary-increases-now-theyre-the-new-normal/" aria-label="5% was considered an average annual pay increase.">5% was considered an average annual pay increase.</a>” The amount of fear the media created surrounding the recession and its length has given companies the perfect excuse to shrink payroll and lower employee salary expectations in the long-run.</p>

<p>The world is desperate for skilled labor and companies around the globe are starving for talent.&nbsp; Companies can tout technology replacing labor, but it is only exacerbating the global shortage of human capital and skilled workers. This means that we as employees are positioned better than ever to leverage our abilities for increased pay.</p>

<p>Bethany Devine, a Senior Hiring Manager in Silicon Valley, <fbs-quotecard article-quote-card="" ticker="CA" exchange="NASDAQ" type="organization" natural-id="fred/company/742" closing-price="0.0" current-price="0.0" link="/companies/ca/" name="CA">

 </fbs-quotecard> and other Fortune 500 companies explains, “I would often see resumes that only had a few years at each company. I found that the people who had switched companies usually commanded a higher salary. The problem with staying at a company forever is you start with a base salary and usually annual raises are based on a percentage of your current salary. There is often a limit to how high your manager can bump you up since it's based on a percentage of your current salary. However, if you move to another company, you start fresh and can usually command a higher base salary to hire you. Companies competing for talent are often not afraid to pay more when hiring if it means they can hire the best talent. Same thing applies for titles. Some companies have a limit to how many promotions they allow each year. Once you are entrenched in a company, it may become more difficult to be promoted as you may be waiting in line behind others who should have been promoted a year ago but were not due to the limit. However, if you apply to another company, your skills may match the higher title, and that company will hire you with the new title. I have seen many coworkers who were waiting on a certain title and finally received it the day they left and were hired at a new company.”</p>
<p>Even more importantly, when I asked Devine her thoughts on employees who had remained in the same company for periods long past the two year mark, she explained that she did feel that some were “underpaid” or had the potential to earn more.</p>
<p>Jessica Derkis started her career earning $8 per hour ($16,640 annual salary) as the YMCA’s marketing manager.&nbsp; Over 10 years, she’s changed employers five times to ultimately earn $72,000 per year at her most recent marketing position.&nbsp; This is approximately a 330% increase over a 10 year career. &nbsp;Derkis’ most recent transition resulted in a 50% increase to her salary. &nbsp;Derkis’ is a great example of how “owning your career” can make a huge difference in your income and career path.</p>

<p><b>Arguments Against Changing Jobs</b></p>
<p>People are worried that “changing jobs too often” will reflect negatively on employee resumes. I can definitely understand this fear because everyone is always worried about being unmarketable. I will be the first to admit that it is possible that certain employers may look at a resume with multiple transitions as a negative and may even disqualify an applicant based on that alone.</p>
<p>But, the important question is whether the risk outweighs the reward. Christine Mueller, President of TechniSearch Recruiters, has had clients that “will not consider anyone who has had more than three jobs in the last 10 years, no matter the reason.” Even so, Mueller still recommends that an employee makes a transition every three to four years for maximum salary gains.&nbsp; Thus, the question is less about whether employees should jump ship, but how long they should they wait before jumping to maximize their salaries and achieve their goals.</p>
<p>Brendan Burke, Director at <fbs-quotecard article-quote-card="" ticker="HW" exchange="NYSE" type="organization" natural-id="fred/company/97406" closing-price="0.0" current-price="0.0" link="/companies/headwaters/" name="Headwaters">
  <a href="https://www.forbes.com/companies/headwaters/" target="_self" data-ga-track="InternalLink:/companies/headwaters/" aria-label="Headwaters">Headwaters</a> 
 </fbs-quotecard> MB, strongly disagrees with the “up-and-out culture.”&nbsp; He explains that “companies turn over great employees because they’re not organizationally strong enough to support rapid development within their ranks. In many cases, that is a recipe for discontinuity in service and product offerings as well as disloyalty in the ranks. As such, we take the opposite approach. Rather than force folks out after 24 months, we try to retain our junior and mid-level staff and develop them within the ranks.”</p>
<p>Mr. Burke is absolutely correct. Most companies are not equipped to “rapidly” promote and reward their best employees for a variety of reasons such as office politics. Everyone that has worked in the labor pool hates office politics, but understands that it is an unavoidable evil and is more often than not a major obstacle to rewarding talent.</p>
<p>Finally, we’ve been talking about money a lot.&nbsp; Andrew Bauer, CEO of Royce Leather, explains that jumping ship can be “stressful.” Employees also need to consider their “quality of life, mental health, physical health and better moral standards.” Mr. Bauer is right. Money is important, but it must be balanced with everything else in your life. Monetary compensation is only one part of your life, and it should not dictate everything.</p>
<p>Jumping ship is a risk that we all need to weigh at a personal level.&nbsp; In my career, jumping ship is something I’ve done aggressively and frequently. I’ve never looked back and regretted my decisions because I’ve always felt that my skills deserved more. Hiring a single employee who is able to perform even 10% more efficiently is worth at least a 25% increase in salary. Companies spend a lot of money to pay recruiters, human resourcing to conduct background checks and the time of existing employees to hire and train new people. It’s always cheaper to just hire better people and pay them more.</p>

<p><b>Conclusion:</b></p>
<p>It’s a fact that employees are underpaid. Instead of focusing on things we can’t control like the economy or management decisions, focus on the things we can. Employees can control their own salaries by aggressively negotiating their opportunities and being unafraid to ask for more.</p>
<p>Clearly, there will always be exceptions to the rule. Not everyone may be able to make this decision immediately, but every employee should consider the option. I don’t fault employers and businesses for the market because it’s their right and duty to maximize their profits.

  <p>We’re excited to announce Stable Audio Open, an open source model optimised for generating short audio samples, sound effects and production elements using text prompts. This release marks a key milestone as we further open portions of our generative audio capabilities to empower sound designers, musicians and creative communities.</p><p><strong>What is Stable Audio Open?</strong></p><p>Stable Audio Open allows anyone to generate up to 47 seconds of high-quality audio data from a simple text prompt. Its specialised training makes it ideal for creating drum beats, instrument riffs, ambient sounds, foley recordings and other audio samples for music production and sound design.</p><p>A key benefit of this open source release is that users can fine-tune the model on their own custom audio data. For example, a drummer could fine-tune on samples of their own drum recordings to generate new beats.</p>

  <p><strong>How is it Different from Stable Audio?</strong></p><p>Our commercial Stable Audio product produces high-quality, full tracks with coherent musical structure up to three minutes in length, as well as advanced capabilities like audio-to-audio generation and coherent multi-part musical compositions.&nbsp;</p><p>Stable Audio Open, on the other hand, specialises in audio samples, sound effects and production elements. While it can generate short musical clips, it is not optimised for full songs, melodies or vocals. This open model provides a glimpse into generative AI for sound design while prioritising responsible development alongside creative communities.</p><p>The new model was trained on audio data from FreeSound and the Free Music Archive. This allowed us to create an open audio model while respecting creator rights.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>At Coder we’re in the business of making cloud development environments awesome. When you are developing remotely, the speed and quality of the connection you have to your workspace is a big driver of the overall experience you’ll have. One important measure of how good your connection is:</p>
<p><strong>Throughput</strong> - the rate at which you can send or receive data across a network</p>
<p>Throughput is usually quoted in bits per second, and on modern internet networks, these range from a few millions of bits per second (Mb/s) to a few billions of bits per second (Gb/s).</p>
<p>You will really notice throughput differences when copying files to and from your workspace, or testing web applications that push heavy assets.</p>
<p>Coder v2.12, which we have just released, includes several networking improvements that together increase throughput dramatically: over 5x in some cases. Below is a comparison of throughput test results for 3 different versions of Coder, across 3 different AWS environments with different latencies. They are all based on t3.xlarge VM instances. Your throughput will vary based on many factors besides latency including the speed of your connection and network congestion.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.datocms-assets.com/19109/1717161538-frame-1.png"></p>
<p>The 60ms test is from us-east-1 to us-west-1, and is a typical latency you might experience connecting to a Coder Workspace relatively far from home, say, across the continental USA.</p>
<p>The 10ms test is from us-east-1 to us-east-2, and is a typical latency you might experience if you are connecting to a Coder Workspace within the same geographic region.</p>
<p>The 1ms test is within us-east-1, and is an extremely low latency connection you might only achieve if you are connecting to a Coder Workspace hosted by your company on-premise, within the same building or corporate campus.</p>
<p>The rest of this post is a deep-dive into how we achieved these throughput increases. Coder builds an end-to-end encrypted tunnel to your workspace, and as such the theoretical maximum throughput to your workspace will be slightly lower than that of the underlying network path due to tunnel overheads, but in our testing we found a significant contribution to reduced throughput was the performance of the embedded TCP stack.</p>
<h2>Wait, Coder Has an Embedded TCP Stack?</h2>
<p>The TCP stack is not something that most software engineers think about that often, even those that are working deep in the backend. Most application software, even server software, does not have a TCP stack embedded even though TCP is essential to the web and the majority of application protocols. The reason is simple: it’s handled in the OS! When you want to speak TCP you just ask the OS to open a socket for you.</p>
<p>So, why doesn’t Coder do that?</p>
<p>We are committed to keeping your data safe through end-to-end encryption and to making Coder easy to run across a wide variety of systems from client laptops and desktops to VMs, containers, and bare metal. If we used the TCP implementation in the OS, we’d need a way for the TCP packets to get from the operating system back into Coder for encryption. This is called a TUN device in unix-style operating systems and creating one requires elevated permissions, limiting who can run Coder and where. Asking for elevated permissions inside secure clusters at regulated financial enterprises or top secret government networks is at best a big delay and at worst a nonstarter.</p>
<p>Instead, Coder embeds the networking stack from gVisor. gVisor is a container runtime that reimplements the entire Linux ABI (syscalls) in Go, but we only need the networking for our purposes. gVisor is deployed extensively by Google in their Cloud offerings, so it is mature and stable, but in our testing, we find that it is not always optimized for our use case.</p>
<p>Google uses gVisor within the data center, where networks have high bandwidth and extremely low latency (hundreds of μs to few ms). Coder users have 10x to 100x more latency, and this can have a big difference in network throughput. We’ve had to make some changes both to how gVisor is configured and to gVisor itself to make it perform well for Coder users.</p>
<h2>A Tale of TCP Buffers</h2>
<p>The promise that a TCP socket makes is that it will deliver a stream of bytes for you, and it will handle reordered or dropped packets, so the receiving application gets your data in order.</p>
<p>TCP uses buffers both when sending and receiving data to handle this. When sending data, it keeps a copy of the data in the buffer until the other TCP stack explicitly acknowledges receipt, in case it needs to be retransmitted. When receiving data, it keeps out-of-order data in the buffer until the in-order data arrives.</p>
<p>TCP data is being tracked in the buffers, and can’t be deleted until it’s delivered in order to the receiving application, which takes some time (the latency). Because of this, the maximum theoretical throughput you can achieve with TCP is directly proportional to the buffer sizes, and inversely proportional to the latency.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.datocms-assets.com/19109/1717105039-throughput.png" width="128"></p>
<p>Where T is the throughput, C is some constant (approximately 1), B is the buffer size <sup>1</sup>, and L is the latency.</p>
<p>This might be a surprising result at first! We often explain packet switched networking with the analogy of the postal system. If I live in California and am writing letters to my friends in Texas and Florida, it’s easy to imagine that I could post as many letters as I want to them. Sure, the letters might take an extra day to reach my friend in Florida, but the rate at which I send them and the rate at which they could arrive shouldn’t be fundamentally limited by that delay.</p>
<p>The key here is that we’re ensuring reliable delivery. The postal system, in our little analogy, loses letters all the time and doesn’t even offer registered mail<sup>2</sup>. So, I have to keep copies of all my letters until my friends write back to say they got them. If I send 10 letters per day, and it takes 2 days to deliver to Texas (and 2 more days to get a reply), then I better have space for 40 letters. If I try to do the same for Florida, which takes 3 days each way, then I better have space for 60 letters, or risk losing some of the letters permanently.</p>
<p>Let’s see what this looks like in TCP. The Coder CLI includes a speedtest command to test throughput to your workspace, and can capture the TCP packets for analysis in Wireshark. (You will need the Tailscale Wireshark Lua plugin to decode the packet captures.) The following runs a 20 second upload test to my workspace named <code>dogfood2</code>.</p>
<pre><code>coder speedtest <span>--direction</span> up <span>--pcap-file</span> dogfood2-up-<span>00</span><span>.pcap</span> -t <span>10s</span> dogfood2</code></pre>
<p>Testing with Coder 2.9, I get something like:</p>
<pre><code>Starting a 10s upload test...
INTERVAL        THROUGHPUT         
0.00-1.28 sec   65.2983 Mbits/sec  
1.28-2.58 sec   51.8875 Mbits/sec  
2.58-3.86 sec   52.3992 Mbits/sec  
3.86-5.09 sec   54.5126 Mbits/sec  
5.09-6.31 sec   54.8532 Mbits/sec  
6.31-7.55 sec   54.4550 Mbits/sec  
7.55-8.77 sec   54.9556 Mbits/sec  
<span>8.77-10.00 sec  54.3970 Mbits/sec  
-----------------------------------</span>
0.00-10.00 sec  55.3624 Mbits/sec</code></pre>
<p>I opened one of the packet capture files and asked Wireshark to plot the TCP window (green line) and number of unacknowledged bytes in flight (blue line).</p>
<p><img src="https://www.datocms-assets.com/19109/1717155989-tcp1.png"></p>
<p>The TCP window is, essentially, how much room the receiver has in its buffer, and the TCP sender is not allowed to send more unacknowledged data than this. When the receiver acknowledges some data, the blue line dips down and we send more. This shows us that the TCP throughput is being limited by the buffer sizes, not the underlying network bandwidth.</p>
<p>The TCP window hovers right around 512 KB, which is one half the default TCP receive buffer size in gVisor. The maximum TCP window is capped at half the buffer to allow for out of order segments and for data not yet delivered to the application.</p>
<p>Increasing the buffers gives the TCP stack the room it needs to track more data in flight, increasing throughput (dramatically in some cases).</p>
<p>On 2.10, which has increased TCP buffers, here is an example speedtest:</p>
<pre><code>Starting a <span>10</span>s upload test...
INTERVAL        THROUGHPUT

<h3>When Slow Start is Too Fast</h3>
<p>In my performance testing, after increasing buffer sizes I saw much improved throughput overall, but I noticed that my connection speed would often stutter in the first couple seconds.</p>
<p>Here is a Wireshark plot of the TCP throughput for my connection.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.datocms-assets.com/19109/1717156014-tcp2.png"></p>
<p>It shows the throughput ramping up in the first second or so, then coming to a screeching halt around 2 seconds, before recovering and stabilizing. This happens even though we never get close to saturating the TCP window we discussed in the last section.</p>
<p>While you’d hardly notice the issue downloading a 100MB file, this stutter would turn a 2 second page load into 3-4 seconds.</p>
<p>To understand what’s happening we need to dive a bit deeper into TCP and talk about congestion control. TCP congestion control algorithms moderate the amount of data a TCP connection sends to avoid overwhelming congested network links along the path. Avoiding this is both in our own selfish interest, since retransmitting dropped packets lowers our effective throughput, and in the common interest of the Internet as a whole because it allows different applications to share the network capacity.</p>
<p>TCP congestion control works by maintaining a second window variable in addition to the one updated by the receiver. The <em>congestion window</em> is an internal state variable that doesn’t appear in the TCP protocol at all. TCP stack takes the smaller of the send window and congestion window to determine an effective window that limits the amount of data it can send.</p>
<p>The full details of congestion control algorithms are beyond the scope of this blog post, but the central idea is that they detect congestion in the network and then update the congestion window, cutting its size in the face of congestion and slowly opening up the window when it seems the network can handle more.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.datocms-assets.com/19109/1717156008-tcp3.png"></p>
<p>When network links receive more data than they can carry, routers in the path respond to this congestion by dropping packets. TCP detects these packet drops through missed acknowledgements in the protocol. It resends the data, but also reduces the congestion window in response.</p>
<p>At the very start of a TCP connection, the sending stack doesn’t know anything about how much available bandwidth there is on the network path to the destination, so it starts the congestion window very small: just one packet’s worth of data. It does this to avoid dumping a ton of data into the network all at once and causing a cascade of dropped packets. This is called TCP Slow Start.</p>
<p>However, it does not stay slow for long! During TCP Slow Start, each acknowledged packet of data also increases the congestion window, causing 2 packets to be sent in response. This is an exponential increase in throughput–a doubling every round-trip time (RTT). You can see this in the Wireshark throughput plot above during the first second. When TCP detects congestion, it exits Slow Start, having dynamically discovered the current available bandwidth of the network path.</p>
<p>This exponential increase can often be too aggressive. If we depend on a dropped packet to detect congestion, it can take up to one RTT before we receive an indication. During that time, we double the amount of packets we send out into the network, and we might overshoot by a large amount. This is especially a problem for connections with large bandwidth and high latency, as this combination means a large number of packets are “in flight” in the network at any given time. Overshooting can cause a significant fraction of these in flight packets to be dropped. Multiple dropped packets cause a lot of problems for the TCP stack, including slamming the congestion window shut and increased CPU utilization as the stack has to compute which packets to resend. This is the stuttering I saw in my TCP connections.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I’m far from the first person to have noticed this problem. Researchers Ha &amp; Rhee described the issue and an algorithmic solution in their 2011 paper <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.comnet.2011.01.014" target="_blank">Taming the elephants: New TCP slow start</a>. Their proposed algorithm, called HyStart (short for hybrid start), was eventually implemented in the Linux kernel and a slightly modified version (called HyStart++) implemented in Windows and <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9406/" target="_blank">described in an RFC</a>. HyStart works by tracking slight variations in the round-trip-time to detect network congestion before packets are dropped.</p>
<p>gVisor, the TCP stack we use in Coder, had not implemented HyStart. Google uses gVisor in their data centers, and with extremely short RTTs between nodes, they hadn’t seen the stuttering TCP connections. But, they were very happy to accept a PR when I reached out, and so we implemented and <a href="https://github.com/google/gvisor/pull/10287" target="_blank">upstreamed HyStart to gVisor</a> earlier this spring. We are pleased to include an updated gVisor TCP stack with HyStart starting in Coder 2.12.</p>
<p>Here is a Wireshark plot of TCP throughput with HyStart implemented:</p>

<h3>Packets Lost Within</h3>
<p>Networking is a multi-step process with interacting components, many distributed across different locations, and the nature of such systems is that performance is generally limited by a single, slowest rate <em>limiting step</em>, or <em>bottleneck</em>. Furthermore, when you deal with the problem of a rate limiting step, by making it faster or working around it, the performance rapidly improves up to the limits of what was the second-slowest step.</p>
<p>And so, after dealing with TCP buffers and TCP slow start, we continued to examine Coder’s networking performance. We found that TCP throughput was limited by dropped packets, and that some of the packets were being dropped <em>inside</em> the Coder process before they were sent out on the wire!</p>
<p>Coder uses a modified version of Tailscale for networking. The packet-processing pipeline in this arrangement looks, schematically, like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.datocms-assets.com/19109/1717155994-tcp5.png"></p>
<p>Via some hacked logging, we determined that packets were being dropped in the Channel Endpoint – a software component that looks like a network interface to gVisor and allows WireGuard to read and write network packets like a TUN device.</p>
<p>The Channel Endpoint had an internal queue of packets and when the queue filled up, it dropped packets sent by gVisor’s TCP/IP stack. The Channel Endpoint was a component of gVisor, designed to implement a virtual network link, and dropping packets <em>is</em> what real network links do when they are filled up.</p>
<p>In some sense, this was a reasonable arrangement. If the gVisor stack can send data faster than WireGuard can encrypt, then <em>something</em> needs to put pressure on the stack to get it to back off, and as we discussed in the last section this is exactly what TCP congestion control is designed to do when it detects dropped packets.</p>
<p>However, this is all happening with the <em>same process</em> on a single node, not in some distributed system of interacting routers and switches that make up the Internet. In this context, dropping packets is a very heavyweight solution to the problem of putting back pressure on the TCP stack. Firstly, you have to wait for a network round trip to find out about dropped packets. Secondly, it increases work because you have to resend.</p>
<p>We can do much better, and in fact, Go already includes the data structure we need as a primitive: the buffered channel. A buffered Go channel allows writes to complete without blocking until the buffer is full, and then any further writes simply block until there is room in the channel. This blocks the gVisor stack from sending more data and gives WireGuard time to catch up. And, when WireGuard has caught up, gVisor can resume sending within microseconds, not milliseconds of network round trips. This simple fix doubles throughput on some connections in our test systems.</p>
<h3>Final Words</h3>
<p>I want to end this post by saying that although we have made big strides in the last few Coder versions, we don’t consider this network performance work done. While security of your data in transit is our top priority, we will continue to push for higher performance until we can say confidently that the bottleneck is the underlying network itself.</p>

<p><span><em><sup>1</sup> I’m glossing over the difference between the send buffer and the receive buffer here, and in the case where one is significantly smaller than the other, the maximum throughput is limited by the smaller one.</em></span></p>
<p><span><em><sup>2</sup> This is by design and is called the end-to-end principle. The services offered by the system are kept basic and lightweight, and if you want reliable delivery, or proof of delivery you build it into the protocols the endpoints speak.</em></span></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p>Researchers have discovered a major driver of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and several other immune disorders that affect the spine, liver and arteries, raising hopes for millions of people worldwide.</p><p>The breakthrough is particularly exciting because the newly found biological pathway can be targeted by drugs that are already used, with work under way to adapt them to patients with IBD and other conditions.</p><p>“What we have found is one of the very central pathways that goes wrong when people get inflammatory bowel disease and this has been something of a holy grail,” said Dr James Lee, the group leader of the genetic mechanisms of disease laboratory at the Francis Crick Institute in London.</p><p>Lee added: “Even for pure, fundamental immunology this is a really exciting discovery. But to show this is dysregulated in people who get disease not only gives us a better understanding of the disease, it tells us this is something we can treat.”</p><p>More than half a million people in the UK have inflammatory bowel disease, the two main forms of which are Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, with at least 7 million affected globally. They arise when the immune system attacks the bowel, causing an array of debilitating symptoms from abdominal pain and weight loss to diarrhoea and blood in stools. While medicines such as steroids can ease the symptoms, some patients require surgery to remove part of their bowel.</p><p>Lee’s research team “stumbled” on the discovery after investigating a “gene desert”, a stretch of DNA on chromosome 21 that does not code for proteins, which has previously been linked to IBD and other autoimmune diseases. Writing in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07501-1" data-link-name="in body link">Nature</a>, they describe how they found a section of DNA that behaves like a volume control for nearby genes. This “enhancer” was seen only in immune cells called macrophages where it boosted a gene called ETS2 and ramped up the risk of IBD.</p><figure id="a33feb6a-a809-46bc-a950-790f5d2e7f86" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props="{&quot;richLinkIndex&quot;:6,&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&quot;,&quot;prefix&quot;:&quot;Related: &quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Combining three healthy behaviours can lower IBS risk, study finds&quot;,&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;a33feb6a-a809-46bc-a950-790f5d2e7f86&quot;,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;richLink&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/feb/20/combining-three-healthy-behaviours-can-lower-ibs-risk-study-finds&quot;},&quot;ajaxUrl&quot;:&quot;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;display&quot;:0,&quot;theme&quot;:0,&quot;design&quot;:0}}" config="{&quot;renderingTarget&quot;:&quot;Web&quot;,&quot;darkModeAvailable&quot;:false,&quot;updateLogoAdPartnerSwitch&quot;:true,&quot;assetOrigin&quot;:&quot;https://assets.guim.co.uk/&quot;}"></gu-island></figure><p>Through gene editing experiments, the scientists showed that ETS2 is central to the inflammatory behaviour of macrophages and their ability to damage the bowel in IBD. “There’s been a search for some time for the central drivers of this pathogenic process, and this is what we’ve stumbled on,” said Lee, who is also a consultant gastroenterologist at the Royal Free hospital and UCL.</p><p>The same biological pathway is thought to drive other autoimmune disorders, including ankylosing spondylitis, which causes spine and joint inflammation in about one in 1,000 people worldwide, and rarer autoimmune diseases that affect the liver and arteries.</p><p>While there are no drugs that specifically target the ETS2 gene, the scientists identified a class of anticancer drugs called MEK inhibitors that they suspected would dampen the gene’s activity. In laboratory tests, the drugs performed as expected, reducing inflammation in gut samples from patients with IBD.</p><p>Because MEK inhibitors have side-effects in other organs, the scientists have begun work to adapt the medicine so it targets only a patient’s macrophages. This is done by creating a “conjugate” where the drug molecule is attached to a synthetic antibody that binds only to the target cells. “It’s safer because it’s more targeted and you can use a lower dose,” said Lee. “We have already developed the antibody conjugate, I have it sitting in my freezer.”</p><figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement"><a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-11">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id="EmailSignup-skip-link-11" tabindex="0" aria-label="after newsletter promotion" role="note">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><p>Clinical trials are still needed to see whether the adapted drug reduces IBD and other autoimmune conditions, but because MEK inhibitors are already used in cancer patients, researchers hope that process could be swift and potentially completed within five years.</p><p>In further work, the scientists found that the ETS2 gene is at least half a million years old and was carried by neanderthals and other archaic humans. “It has been preserved over evolutionary history probably because it is important in early bacterial responses,” said Lee. “So you wouldn’t want to knock it out all together. You just need to turn down its activity by 50% and the effect of that may be enough.”</p><p>Ruth Wakeman at Crohn’s and Colitis UK said: “Crohn’s and colitis are complex, lifelong conditions for which there is no cure, but research like this is helping us to answer some of the big questions about what causes them. This research is a really exciting step towards the possibility of a world free from Crohn’s and colitis.”</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>With the rise of 'okupación' in Spain, property owners and individuals alike are seeking to navigate the legal landscape and social implications of squatting. This comprehensive guide offers insights into the legal framework, personal experiences, and practical strategies to address the <strong>challenges posed by squatting in Spain</strong>. This is everything you need to know about Spain's "okupas" problem.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="Legal+landscape++Squatters++rights+vs++property+owners++rights">Legal landscape: Squatters' rights vs. property owners' rights</h2><p>What are the rules for squatters in Spain? The contentious issue of squatting in Spain, locally known as 'okupación', presents a <strong>complex legal scenario</strong> that intertwines the rights of property owners with those of squatters. At the heart of this debate is the Urban Leases Act of 1994, which delineates the legal boundaries within which property occupation can occur. This legislation is critical in understanding the rights and protections afforded to both parties, and it serves as a cornerstone for resolving disputes related to squatting.</p><p>Under Spanish law, squatting is not explicitly permitted; however, <strong>certain conditions may provide squatters with some level of legal standing</strong>. For instance, if a property is not adequately secured and is left unattended, it becomes vulnerable to occupation. Once inside, squatters may claim a right to housing, complicating the <a href="https://www.idealista.com/en/news/legal-advice-in-spain/2023/07/13/133373-okupas-the-time-it-takes-to-evict-a-squatter-in-spain-has-increased" rel="follow" target="_blank">eviction process</a> for property owners. On the other side, property owners have specific legal recourses to reclaim their rights, including fast-track eviction procedures that have been implemented to streamline the process. Nevertheless, these measures require a clear understanding of the legal framework and often involve navigating through intricate legal channels.</p><p>It is essential for property owners in Spain to be proactive in protecting their assets against potential squatting. This includes <a href="https://www.idealista.com/en/news/legal-advice-in-spain/2021/08/16/24363-how-to-protect-your-home-from-squatters-in-spain" rel="follow" target="_blank">ensuring that properties are properly secured</a>, regularly monitored, and that any signs of illegal occupation are promptly addressed with legal action. For squatters, it is important to be aware of the legal risks associated with occupying a property without consent, as well as the potential social and ethical considerations of such actions.</p><h2 id="The+rise+of+the++okupa+++Economic+crisis+and+housing+shortages">The rise of the 'okupa': Economic crisis and housing shortages</h2><p>How common is squatting in Spain? The phenomenon of 'okupación'—the Spanish term for squatting—has surged in recent years, fuelled by a complex blend of socio-economic factors. At the forefront is the economic crisis that has gripped Spain, leaving a trail of <strong>high unemployment rates and financial instability</strong>. This precarious situation has forced many, particularly young people aged between 18 to 24, to consider squatting as a last resort due to the scarcity of affordable housing options. The issue is further exacerbated for those still living with parents, unable to step onto the property ladder in a market where prices have not aligned with the economic reality of the average citizen.</p><p>Moreover, the <strong>housing crisis</strong> has been intensified by a significant number of properties owned by banks—a consequence of the financial crisis and subsequent bailouts. Activist groups such as the PAH (Platform for People Affected by Mortgages) have emerged in response, utilising a variety of tactics to address the housing shortage. In Catalonia alone, which has a high level number of squatters relative to the total in Spain, movements like PAH have become instrumental in advocating for housing rights. The intersection of these social dynamics and economic hardships paints a vivid picture of why squatting in Spain has become not just a matter of legality, but also a symptom of a deeper societal issue.</p><h2 id="Strategies+for+prevention+and+eviction+of+squatters+in+Spain">Strategies for prevention and eviction of squatters in Spain</h2><p>For property owners in Spain, the rise of squatting has necessitated the adoption of robust strategies to safeguard their properties. <strong>Preventive measures are crucial </strong>and include steps such as installing adequate security systems, conducting regular property inspections, and ensuring that all potential entry points are securely sealed. Awareness and vigilance are key in deterring would-be squatters from targeting a property. Additionally, building a network with neighbours and local community members can act as an early warning system to any suspicious activity.</p><p>In instances where prevention fails, property owners must be versed in the legal avenues available for eviction. Spanish law provides for an immediate eviction procedure that can be enacted within 48 hours of illegal occupation, provided that the property owner can promptly demonstrate proof of ownership and report the occupation to authorities swiftly. This fast-track process is designed to minimise the duration of unlawful squatting and mitigate the potential damage and costs incurred by property owners. It is <strong>imperative for owners to understand these legal strategies</strong> and act decisively to reclaim their rights in the face of squatting challenges.</p><h2 id="Personal+accounts++The+emotional+toll+of+squatting+disputes+in+Spain">Personal accounts: The emotional toll of squatting disputes in Spain</h2><p>The battle against squatting in Spain is not only a legal skirmish but also a deeply personal and emotional one for many property owners. The stories of those who have endured the <strong>frustration and helplessness of having their properties occupied</strong> illicitly are both compelling and heart-wrenching. These narratives underscore the profound impact that squatting can have on individuals, extending far beyond the financial losses to include significant emotional distress and a sense of violation.</p><p>Property owners have shared experiences of feeling <strong>powerless as they grapple with the lengthy and often cumbersome legal process to evict squatters</strong>. The emotional toll is exacerbated by the fact that, in some cases, squatters can live in a property for years before being legally removed, during which time the owner must continue to pay for utilities and taxes. The sense of injustice is palpable among those who have invested their life savings into a home, only to see it usurped by others. These personal accounts serve as a stark reminder of the human element at the core of squatting disputes and the urgent need for a more efficient resolution system.</p><h2 id="Seeking+change++Advocacy+for+legal+reform+in+Spain">Seeking change: Advocacy for legal reform in Spain</h2><p>In light of the complex and often protracted nature of squatting disputes in Spain, there is a growing chorus among property owners and legal experts advocating for reform. The current legal framework, while providing some avenues for recourse, is frequently<strong> criticised for not being sufficiently agile or responsive to the needs of property owners</strong>. Advocates argue that the system needs to be overhauled to ensure that rights can be reclaimed more swiftly and equitably.</p><p>Proposed changes to legislation include shortening the legal timeframe for evictions, enhancing the protection of property rights, and increasing penalties for those found guilty of squatting. These reforms aim to deter squatting by making it less attractive and more risky, while also providing property owners with a more straightforward path to regaining possession of their properties. By <strong>streamlining the judicial process and closing legal loopholes</strong>, it is hoped that property owners will face fewer obstacles in protecting their investments and that squatting in Spain will become a less pervasive issue.</p><h2 id="The++okupa++movement+and+public+perception+in+Spain">The 'okupa' movement and public perception in Spain</h2><p>The 'okupa' movement in Spain is not merely a legal issue but also a <strong>cultural phenomenon that has garnered diverse public opinions</strong>. Understanding this movement involves delving into the broader social context of Spanish society, where economic strife and housing crises have pushed the narrative of squatting into the public domain. The portrayal of squatters in media coverage has significantly influenced public perception, often painting a picture that ranges from sympathetic portrayals of those seeking shelter to negative depictions of criminal activity.</p><p>Media reports have been instrumental in shaping the narrative around squatting, with stories of 'okupas' sometimes being sensationalised to highlight conflicts and drama. However, it's important to consider the stories of individuals involved in squatting, which often reveal a more complex reality. Young people aged between 18 to 24, for instance, are increasingly seen squatting properties owned by banks, highlighting a generational struggle for affordable living spaces. The public's perception is further complicated by activist groups like PAH (Platform for People Affected by Mortgages) in Catalonia and across Spain, who have used a variety of tactics to advocate for housing rights, challenging the stigma associated with squatting.</p><p><strong>Public opinion on squatting is polarised</strong>, with some viewing it as a necessary response to systemic failures that leave citizens without affordable housing options. Others see it as an infringement on property rights and a challenge to the rule of law. The 'okupa' movement has also seen support from political figures, such as Ada Colau, the regional leader in Barcelona and a former housing activist, who has brought attention to the plight of those without homes and the need for legal reform. This political backing has lent a degree of legitimacy to the movement and influenced public perception towards a more nuanced understanding of the socio-economic factors driving squatting.</p><p>Ultimately, the 'okupa' movement reflects a <strong>clash between the fundamental need for shelter and the protection of property rights</strong>. As Spain continues to grapple with its housing crisis, the stories of squatters and the media's portrayal will remain pivotal in shaping public opinion and potentially guiding future legal reforms.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://mbuffett.com/posts/maintaining-motivation/">https://mbuffett.com/posts/maintaining-motivation/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40586587">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>One of the biggest sticking points of being a solo dev is maintaining motivation. I’ve been keeping a journal entry about how to hack my motivation, what works and what doesn’t. Here are the things that have worked.</p><h3 id="convert-external-sources-to-motivation">Convert external sources to motivation</h3><p>I’ve always known that I’m more extrinsically than intrinsically motivated, so I have a couple systems that help to give me bursts of external motivation. For example, the Money Bots, which pop up every time someone subscribes.</p><p><img src="https://mbuffett.com/motivation/money_bots.png"></p><p>I’m a push notification ascetic, but these pop up right on my home screen. It’s a small burst of motivation every time. There’s a bit of a hedonic treadmill effect; initially a single new subscriber was a massive hit of dopamine/energy, and that’s reduced over time, but they still fuel me.</p><p>In a similar vein, I signed up for a service that notifies me whenever someone mentions Chessbook. This is simultaneously useful for marketing, since engaging on socials can help a lot, but it’s also motivating whenever I see people talking (hopefully positively) about the thing I’ve built.</p><p>There’s also a <code>#pump-up</code> channel with a feed of milestones we’ve hit, like $X MRR, 2,000 discord users, churn rate &lt;6%, motivating stuff like that.</p><h3 id="leave-tasks-unfinished">Leave tasks unfinished</h3><p>I can’t overstate how much this one helps me. I try to leave a task 90% finished at the end of a working session. It feels slightly worse than closing out the work, but it makes starting the next day 10x easier. Having a quick win when I start coding is a massive boost, and it immediately gets me into the flow state. It can’t be <em>too</em> easy though, if all I have left is to run <code>git commit</code>, that’s not enough. Ideally it’s something where I know exactly what I need to do, that will take 5-10 minutes.</p><h3 id="use-the-thing-myself-as-much-as-possible">Use the thing myself, as much as possible</h3><p>I try to use my own product as much as I can. When someone submits a bug report about some jank, sometimes it’s easy to classify it as a small issue. Then I run into it myself, realize that it really affects the experience, and go fix it right away. Felt pain is way more salient than communicated pain.</p><p>To digress, this also gives me way better product ideas, the best ones I’ve had didn’t come from sitting down and thinking about what people may want, they came from realizing what I myself want.</p><h3 id="address-the-pain-instead-of-pushing-through">Address the pain, instead of pushing through</h3><p>There’s always some parts that suck. A neglected area of the codebase, dealing with third parties, releasing new versions of native apps, etc. If I know I’ll have to deal with one of these as part of a task, it can feel much harder to motivate myself to get started.</p><p>The trick, is that you can almost always make these less painful.</p><p>For example, recently I felt a lot of friction starting a new task because it needed 4+ new endpoints, and that always involved a lot of boilerplate. I have to write the types on the backend, write the same types on the frontend, make sure I get the payload correct, make sure I get the path correct, and nothing is type-checked so usually it doesn’t work the first time. So before starting, I found a RPC library called <a href="https://www.rspc.dev/">RSPC</a>, which generates types for me, and makes writing and calling a new backend function from the frontend almost as easy, and just as type-safe, as calling another async frontend function.</p><p>Not only did this remove the pain point, but I was actively excited to use this new system. I converted a source of friction into a motivation multiplier.</p><p>This is one that’s easy to forget if you’ve worked in bigger companies where you can’t address the pain points of day-to-day development. You’ve probably acquired a sense of futility in trying to address these things. There’s either deadlines to hit, or people to get sign-off from, or you need to write a technical doc on your approach before you get to try it. Being able to just go fix and improve whatever you want is one of the greatest points of being a solo dev, so remind yourself that you can take advantage of it at any time.</p><h3 id="do-nothing">Do nothing</h3><p>I get sucked into high-tech Skinner Boxes all the time. Reddit, Twitter, YouTube, etc. The best way I’ve found to get out of this is to do it in two steps. First I go from Reddit to doing nothing, then I get to work.</p><p>Going straight from Reddit to focused work is very hard, but doing nothing is much easier, and eventually your brain calms down and it doesn’t feel nearly as hard to start writing some code.</p><p>I really mean doing nothing; I’ll just sit in front of my screen for a few minutes and as if by magic, the consumption-fueled dopamine-overload fog will lift, and I can get excited about creation and problem-solving again.</p><h3 id="update-my-users">Update my users</h3><p>This is a two-for-one, I can both update my users, and motivate myself by looking back on progress. I often reach the end of the month, and find myself thinking “did I even get anything done?”, but then you can write your update for the month, and see that you did get a lot done.</p><p><img src="https://mbuffett.com/motivation/update.png"></p><p>Obviously this cuts both ways though, if you really didn’t get much done you’ll see that too, but facing the truth that you’re not getting enough done can be motivating too.</p><h3 id="get-a-partner">Get a partner</h3><p>This may seem contradictory to the title, but I only said solo <em>dev</em>. I have a partner, who’s way better at everything product/design/copy/etc.</p><p>I won’t list all the benefits of having a partner, but I now believe they’re essential, and in any future projects I’ll be making sure to find a partner that complements my skillset while being aligned on the problem. It’s a night and day difference.</p><p>The motivation piece here is mostly around accountability. It’s the same reason that people have gym partners, just having someone that expects you to show up can be powerful. Also if you have a weekly meeting and find you have nothing to talk about, you’re probably not getting enough done, and it’s a salient reminder.</p><p>The other piece is that your motivation and your partner’s motivation will ebb and flow, and it won’t happen in lock-step. It’s very helpful to have someone else still motivated about the project, when you’re not.</p><h3 id="no-zero-days-to-avoid-listless-guilt">No zero days, to avoid listless guilt</h3><p>Some days when I’m not getting anything done, I’ve got this lingering guilt that I’m having a “zero day”. This prevents me from fully enjoying whatever activity I’m doing. I’ve tried just giving myself permission to enjoy whatever I’m doing, but it just doesn’t work. Ostensibly I’m taking time off and recharging, but it doesn’t feel like that at all – it feels like pushing through. This can lead to a negative feedback loop, where I’m constantly trying to recharge, but just getting more tired.</p><p>I’ve found the only way is to get some good work done first, then I can be fully immersed in whatever fun slacking-off activity I dive into.</p><h3 id="if-ive-got-it-use-it">If I’ve got it, use it</h3><p>Sometimes I’ll be going to bed thinking about a problem, and get the motivation which comes in the moment of figuring things out. I could write it down and get to it in the morning, but most of the time I’ll just get up and work until 4am instead. This is also one of the great parts of being a solo dev. I don’t need to be up at 9am to be available on Slack, so I can use my motivation whenever it strikes me, even if that’s in the middle of the night.</p><p>This probably doesn’t generalize, but again this is more of a journal entry adapted into a blog post, than it is advice. I’ve always done better with the looser approach of trying to maximize the opportunities for flow state work, than forcing myself to work 9-5 every day, rain or shine.</p><h3 id="you-have-adhd-getting-yourself-to-work-shouldnt-be-this-hard">You have ADHD, getting yourself to work shouldn’t be this hard</h3><p>True 😄</p></div></article><div><p>Thanks for reading!
