<p>And Oxycyte was ideal for the group’s 2021 Ig Nobel-winning efforts. The experiments involved intra-anally administering oxygen gas or a liquid oxygenated perfluorocarbon to the unfortunate rodents and porcines. Yes, they gave the animals enemas. They then induced respiratory failure and evaluated the effectiveness of the intra-anal treatment. The result: Both treatments were pretty darned effective at staving off respiratory failure with no major complications.</p>

<p>So far, so good. The next logical step was to determine if EVA could work in human patients, too. “Patients with severe respiratory failure often need mechanical ventilation to survive, but these therapies can cause further lung injury,” the authors wrote in this latest paper. EVA “could give the lungs a chance to rest and heal.”</p>
<p>The team recruited 27 healthy adult men in Japan, each of whom received a dose of non-oxygenated perfluorodecalin via the anus. They were asked to retain the liquid for a full hour as the dosage slowly increased from 25 to 1,500 mL. Twenty of the men successfully completed the experiment. Apart from mild temporary abdominal bloating and discomfort—which proved to be dosage dependent and resolved with no need for medical attention—they experienced no adverse effects.</p>
<p>“This is the first human data and the results are limited solely to demonstrating the safety of the procedure and not its effectiveness,” <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1102615">said co-author Takanori Takebe</a> of Cincinnati Children’s Hospital and the University of Osaka in Japan. “But now that we have established tolerance, the next step will be to evaluate how effective the process is for delivering oxygen to the bloodstream.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                    <p><em></em><em>Watch Anna Bower discuss this article with&nbsp;</em>Lawfare<em>&nbsp;Editor-in-Chief Benjamin Wittes&nbsp;<a target="_blank" data-stringify-link="https://youtube.com/live/SZZyccEbtpU?feature=share" data-sk="tooltip_parent" href="https://youtube.com/live/SZZyccEbtpU?feature=share" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-sf-ec-immutable="">on&nbsp;Lawfare's YouTube here</a>.</em></p><p>It was 1:20 p.m. on the afternoon of Saturday, Oct. 11. I was lounging in my pajamas, idly scrolling through Netflix, having spent the morning reading news stories, occasionally tweeting, and watching TV. It was a rare day off.<br></p><p>Then my phone lit up with a notification. I glanced down at the message.<br></p><p>“Anna, Lindsey Halligan here,” it began.&nbsp;</p><p>Lindsey Halligan—the top prosecutor in the Eastern District of Virginia—was texting me. As it turned out, she was texting me about a criminal case she is pursuing against one of the president’s perceived political enemies: New York Attorney General Letitia James.<br></p><p>So began my two-day text correspondence with the woman President Donald Trump had installed, in no small part, to bring the very prosecution she was now discussing with me by text message.<br></p><p>Over the next 33 hours, Halligan texted me again.<br></p><p>And again.&nbsp;<br></p><p>And again.&nbsp;</p><p>And again.<br></p><p>Through the whole of our correspondence, however, there is something Halligan never said: She never said a word suggesting that she was not “on the record.”</p><p>It is not uncommon for federal prosecutors to communicate with the press, both through formal channels and sometimes informally. My exchange with Halligan, however, was highly unusual in a number of respects. She initiated a conversation with me, a reporter she barely knew, to discuss an ongoing prosecution that she is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/27/us/politics/trump-comey-justice-department.html" data-sf-ec-immutable="">personally handling</a>. She mostly criticized my reporting—or, more precisely, my summary of someone else’s reporting. But several of her messages contained language that touched on grand jury matters, even as she insisted that she could not reveal such information,&nbsp; which is protected from disclosure by prosecutors under federal law.<br></p><p>As a legal journalist covering the Justice Department, I had never encountered anything quite like my exchange with Halligan. Neither had my editor. Over the last several days, he and I spoke with multiple former federal officials and journalists who cover the justice system. None could recall a similar instance in which a sitting U.S. attorney reached out to chastise a reporter about matters concerning grand jury testimony in an active case.</p><p><a href="https://givebutter.com/journalism" target="_blank" data-sf-ec-immutable=""><img src="https://lawfare-assets-new.azureedge.net/assets/images/default-source/article-images/support-lawfare8495e13b-9c80-42f6-ac96-e96789089124.png?sfvrsn=86c5a5d4_3" height="62" width="206" alt="" sf-size="69672"></a></p><p>Justice Department spokeswoman Natalie Baldassarre confirmed the authenticity of the texts at 4:34 p.m.&nbsp;today, responding to my questions about the exchange with a statement that reads in its entirety:</p><blockquote>You clearly didn’t get the response you wanted—which was information handed over to you without having to dig into the facts of the case to craft a truthful story—so you thought you’d “tattletale” to main justice. Lindsay [sic] Halligan was attempting to point you to facts, not gossip, but when clarifying that she would adhere to the rule of the law and not disclose Grand Jury information, you threaten to leak an entire conversation. Good luck ever getting anyone to talk to you when you publish their texts.</blockquote><p>After I reached out to the department for comment on Halligan’s texts, Halligan texted me yet again, for the first time in several days, insisting that our entire correspondence had been off the record. Our full exchange, linked below, allows readers to make their own judgments on that question.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>***</strong><br></p><p>As with many Trumpworld stories, this one began with someone getting sacked. That someone was Erik Siebert, Halligan’s predecessor as the U.S. Attorney in eastern Virginia, who was removed—or <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/19/us/politics/erik-siebert-comey-letitia-james.html" data-sf-ec-immutable="">forced to resign</a>—last month.&nbsp;</p><p>According to <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/us-attorney-plans-resign-amid-pressure-trump-after/story?id=125750006" data-sf-ec-immutable="">multiple</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/19/us/politics/erik-siebert-comey-letitia-james.html" data-sf-ec-immutable="">reports</a>, Siebert had raised doubts that the evidence was strong enough to pursue criminal charges against two of President Trump’s longtime adversaries: New York Attorney General Letitia James, who won a civil fraud verdict against the Trump Organization, and former FBI Director James Comey, whom Trump had fired during his first term in office and had long blamed for the so-called “Russiagate” investigation. For years, Trump has publicly said that Comey and James should be punished for <em>something</em>. But Siebert <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/19/us/politics/erik-siebert-comey-letitia-james.html" data-sf-ec-immutable="">reportedly balked</a> at the idea of bringing criminal charges that he thought lacked merit. After news of his objections surfaced in the press, he abruptly departed.<br></p><p>The fallout was swift. That weekend, in the wake of Siebert’s departure, Trump went on a social media tirade, demanding that the attorney general, Pam Bondi, move swiftly to prosecute his perceived foes. “They’re all guilty as hell,” Trump wrote of Comey and James in a <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115239044548033727" data-sf-ec-immutable="">Sept. 20 Truth Social post</a>—which, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-doj-inside-political-enemies-17f13f72?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqcfTHPLdgzc-PAS8WDsHnRql46_qbUhtVoQI_2jHzEAnNx7-HjZ-vcW9AKaI4Y%3D&amp;gaa_ts=68f5867a&amp;gaa_sig=l3iUZaUHTpvyS-LcsEihIdrkS6SCC3U5smjqlzOwEFzBi90n3wQPvHgRcDULXJnNdDGaZo4ABNjlgf8JcXAV7w%3D%3D" data-sf-ec-immutable="">according to the Wall Street Journal</a>, may have been intended as a private message. “JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!”<br></p><p>By the following Monday morning, Trump had installed a new top prosecutor in the Eastern District of Virginia: Halligan, his former personal attorney, who until now had never prosecuted a case. Despite her lack of prosecutorial experience—and reportedly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/27/us/politics/trump-comey-justice-department.html" data-sf-ec-immutable="">against the urging</a> of veteran prosecutors in her office—Halligan pressed forward. Within days of her arrival, she secured an <a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/former-fbi-director-james-comey-indicted" data-sf-ec-immutable="">indictment against Comey</a> for false statements to Congress and obstruction. Two weeks after that, she persuaded a separate grand jury to <a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/ny-attorney-general-letitia-james-indicted-in-eastern-district-of-virginia" data-sf-ec-immutable="">indict James for mortgage fraud</a>.<br></p><p>This is around when I entered the picture—on Saturday, Oct. 11.<br></p><p>Until she texted me, I’d spent much of that morning catching up on news stories about the case Halligan brought against James, which had just been handed up on Thursday, Oct. 9.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/the-justice-department-s-dangerously-weak-case-against-letitia-james" data-sf-ec-immutable="">The indictment</a> accuses the New York attorney general of misrepresenting how she intended to use a Norfolk, Virginia property when she applied for a loan to purchase it back in 2020.<br></p><p>Specifically, prosecutors say that she told lenders the property would be used as a “second home” when, in reality, she used it as a “rental investment property, renting the property to a family of (3).” By misrepresenting the purpose of the property, the indictment alleges, James was able to obtain a more favorable mortgage rate.&nbsp;<br></p><p>While many <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-lede/the-indictment-of-letitia-james-and-the-collapse-of-impartial-justice" data-sf-ec-immutable="">commentators</a> ridiculed the case, <a href="https://x.com/RogerJStoneJr/status/1970164891265778057" data-sf-ec-immutable="">a </a><a href="https://x.com/RogerJStoneJr/status/1970164891265778057" data-sf-ec-immutable="">few</a> were quick to proclaim that Halligan had an <a href="https://x.com/HansMahncke/status/1976405182092136675" data-sf-ec-immutable="">“airtight”</a> case against James.<br></p><p>I was decidedly <a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/the-justice-department-s-dangerously-weak-case-against-letitia-james" data-sf-ec-immutable="">among the skeptics</a>. Putting aside the apparently retaliatory nature of the charges, it wasn’t clear to me that the facts alleged in <a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/ny-attorney-general-letitia-james-indicted-in-eastern-district-of-virginia" data-sf-ec-immutable="">the indictment</a> amounted to a crime at all. The mortgage agreement James signed, which used standard Fannie Mae language, required her to treat the property as a “second home,” mandating that she keep it “available” for her personal use. The agreement explicitly <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/second-home-rider-rewrite-11555599871?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqcUT8LvIU2CXmeDCoIMsludAJmjr5issT4tfkgias5sFkphmFK88OqBU7bdpYI%3D&amp;gaa_ts=68f2ab4b&amp;gaa_sig=azS6fiwCJVPkqbgw8qwqhY-r0TwcXalD5-U0w2DxFeykdbxDzOkFjzkILYm3LToufUtoVji9kLdpb3tPriUGNA%3D%3D" data-sf-ec-immutable="">allowed James to rent</a> the home after one year of ownership, and it <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/second-home-rider-rewrite-11555599871?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqcUT8LvIU2CXmeDCoIMsludAJmjr5issT4tfkgias5sFkphmFK88OqBU7bdpYI%3D&amp;gaa_ts=68f2ab4b&amp;gaa_sig=azS6fiwCJVPkqbgw8qwqhY-r0TwcXalD5-U0w2DxFeykdbxDzOkFjzkILYm3LToufUtoVji9kLdpb3tPriUGNA%3D%3D" data-sf-ec-immutable="">allowed occasional renting</a> within the first year.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Though <a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/ny-attorney-general-letitia-james-indicted-in-eastern-district-of-virginia" data-sf-ec-immutable="">the indictment</a> notes that James declared “thousand(s)” of dollars in rent on “tax form(s),” it provides scant details about the circumstances of the supposed rental arrangement, including the timing and amount collected.&nbsp; Without knowing those details, I found it difficult to assess whether James had even violated the mortgage contract—much less whether she’d committed a crime by fraudulently entering into it or making false statements on her application intending to deceive anyone.<br></p><p>All of which is why, last Saturday, I took particular interest in a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/11/us/politics/letitia-james-indictment-house.html" data-sf-ec-immutable="">New York Times story</a> about the Norfolk home at the center of the James case. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/11/us/politics/letitia-james-indictment-house.html" data-sf-ec-immutable="">The report</a> revealed that the property is occupied by James’s grand-niece, Nakia Thompson. Several times a year, the report said, James stays at the property with Thompson and her children, who have lived there since James purchased the home in 2020.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/11/us/politics/letitia-james-indictment-house.html" data-sf-ec-immutable="">further reported</a> that Thompson appeared before a Norfolk grand jury in June, testifying that “she had lived in the house for years and that she did not pay rent.” According to the report, Thompson was not asked to testify again, and the grand jury that voted to indict James was seated in Alexandria rather than Norfolk.&nbsp;</p><p>As I saw it, the Times report tended to undermine the indictment’s central claim: that James used the home as a “rental investment property.” The evidence, assuming the Times report is accurate, would be exculpatory, I reasoned, in that it tends to show that James did not primarily use the property as a means to collect rent.<br></p><p>I decided to share the article on X, formerly Twitter, as I often do when notable developments arise in relation to the legal cases I cover for<em> Lawfare</em>. Shortly after noon, I tapped out <a href="https://x.com/AnnaBower/status/1977046307970895925" data-sf-ec-immutable="">a post</a>, linking to the Times article and summarizing it as follows:</p><blockquote>NYT reports that Letitia James’s great niece lives in the home that is the subject of the indictment. The niece reportedly testified before a *different* grand jury, telling them that she had lived there for many years without paying rent. James visits regularly.”<br></blockquote><p>I included <a href="https://x.com/AnnaBower/status/1977046307970895925" data-sf-ec-immutable="">two screenshots</a> from the story, one of which highlighted this quotation: “Ms. Thompson testified to a grand jury in Norfolk that she had lived in the house for years and that she did not pay rent.”</p><p><img src="https://lawfare-assets-new.azureedge.net/assets/images/default-source/article-images/screenshot-2025-10-20-at-5-25-44-pm.png?sfvrsn=7447e92c_3" alt="" sf-size="100"></p><p>Not long after that, at 12:48 p.m., I followed up with a <a href="https://x.com/AnnaBower/status/1977053748511097105" data-sf-ec-immutable="">second observation</a>: “This is important exculpatory evidence bc the indictment accuses James of seeking a ‘second home’ mortgage when in reality she intended to use it as an ‘investment’ home by renting it.”</p><p><img src="https://lawfare-assets-new.azureedge.net/assets/images/default-source/article-images/screenshot-2025-10-20-at-5-27-50-pm.png?sfvrsn=34af51be_3" alt="" sf-size="100"></p><p>I didn’t think much of the tweets at the time. Sharing other journalists’ reporting is a routine part of how I try to keep people apprised of the cases I follow.<br></p><p>But the prosecutor who <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/10/politics/lindsey-halligan-no-coordinate-letitia-james-indictment-doj" data-sf-ec-immutable="">personally presented</a> James’s case to the grand jury apparently saw my tweets very differently.<br></p><p><strong>***</strong></p><p>When I received the 1:20 p.m. connection request on Signal—an encrypted messaging service that many journalists use to communicate with sources—my first reaction was that the user identified as “Lindsey Halligan” couldn’t actually be Halligan.<br></p><p>“Anna, Lindsey Halligan here,” the first message read. “You are reporting things that are simply not true. Thought you should have a heads up.”<br></p><p>The user on the other end had selected a setting to make all messages in the chat disappear after eight hours, so I took screenshots of the exchange as it happened to make sure a record of the back-and-forth was preserved. Those <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26190909-signal-screenshots/" data-sf-ec-immutable="">screenshots are all available </a><a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26190909-signal-screenshots/" data-sf-ec-immutable="">here</a>.<br></p><p>Even as I took this precaution, I assumed the exchange was a hoax because, while it is not unusual for lawyers to reach out to me about my reporting or commentary, it is highly unusual for a U.S. attorney to do so regarding an ongoing prosecution—particularly in a high-profile case in which her conduct is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbKHyNhaaCM" data-sf-ec-immutable="">already the subject</a> of <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/lindsey-halligan-is-already-making-mistakes-prosecuting-james-comey-10799728" data-sf-ec-immutable="">immense public scrutiny</a>. Halligan has publicly said little about the cases she is pursuing against the president’s enemies. And I didn’t believe she would message me to complain about a tweet that merely summarized other journalistic coverage of grand jury testimony.<br></p><p>With all that in mind, I hypothesized that the message was from someone impersonating Halligan, either to troll me or as a part of some kind of disinformation campaign.&nbsp;<br></p><p>But there was an easy way to validate my correspondent’s claim to be Halligan. I’d met Halligan once before, a few years ago in West Palm Beach, Florida. At the time, the Justice Department was investigating Trump’s unlawful retention of classified materials and the FBI had executed a search at Mar-a-Lago. Halligan was one of the former and future president’s personal lawyers litigating over the search and the handling of seized materials.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Our meeting was happenstance: I ran into her and another Trump lawyer, James Trusty, at a restaurant inside The Breakers hotel, where I dined after <a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/mar-lago-showdown-federal-court" data-sf-ec-immutable="">covering a hearing</a> before Judge Aileen Cannon for<em> Lawfare</em>. When I introduced myself to the pair, they’d made no secret of their dissatisfaction with how I’d characterized <a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/mar-lago-showdown-federal-court" data-sf-ec-immutable="">Trusty’s presentation</a> during the hearing—particularly, my use of verbs like “gripe” and “complain” to describe his arguments to the judge.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The Guardian would <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/01/trump-lawyers-resign-criminal-investigation" data-sf-ec-immutable="">later report</a> that Trusty had been overheard telling Halligan that he had no interest in talking to reporters from <em>Lawfare</em> on account of <a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/projects-series/archived-projects/the-trump-trials">our coverage</a>. Still, my conversation with them that evening was otherwise pleasant enough. And I suspected that the real Halligan would remember me.<br></p><p>So I accepted the Signal request and typed out a response, explaining that I needed some additional details to confirm her identity. “Can you tell me where we first met, and who you were with?” I asked.<br></p><p>The person purporting to be “Lindsey Halligan” responded one minute later: “Breakers; Trusty. Got your name from your X account.”<br></p><p>This changed things. I had never spoken publicly about my run-in with Halligan and Trusty at The Breakers. So it seemed exceedingly unlikely that a Halligan impersonator would be able to accurately answer the question, let alone within one minute.<br></p><p>As improbable as it had seemed just minutes ago, it now appeared that I really was texting with interim U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Later in the week, I verified that the text exchange had genuinely been with Halligan—or, at least, with Halligan’s phone. I obtained her cell phone number from an independent source and added the number as a contact on my phone. Signal immediately associated the phone number with the “Lindsey Halligan” account with which I had been texting.&nbsp;<br></p><p>But that was later. For now, I was pretty sure my correspondent was Halligan. So I did what any reporter would do: I started asking questions.<br></p><p>“Ok, I’m all ears,” I said after thanking her. “What am I getting wrong?”<br></p><p>“Honestly, so much,” Halligan replied. “I can’t tell you everything but your reporting in particular is just way off.” She then said it was clear to her that I jump to “biased conclusions” based on what I read rather than “truly looking into the evidence.”<br></p><p>I felt confident that Halligan was alluding to one of the tweets I’d posted that afternoon. Other than the tweets, I hadn’t published anything of substance about the James case; my colleague, Molly Roberts, has been <a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/the-justice-department-s-dangerously-weak-case-against-letitia-james" data-sf-ec-immutable="">running</a><a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/the-justice-department-s-dangerously-weak-case-against-letitia-james" data-sf-ec-immutable=""> point</a> on that matter for <em>Lawfare</em>.&nbsp; What’s more, Halligan had mentioned that she found my Signal contact on my X profile, suggesting that she had been looking at my tweets.<br></p><p>To confirm, I sent Halligan a link to <a href="https://x.com/AnnaBower/status/1977046307970895925" data-sf-ec-immutable="">the post</a> in which I summarized Thompson’s grand jury testimony <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/11/us/politics/letitia-james-indictment-house.html" data-sf-ec-immutable="">as reported by</a> the Times. “Are you saying that something I said in this post is inaccurate?” I asked. “And if so, what?”<br></p><p>Halligan replied: “You’re assuming exculpatory evidence without knowing what you’re talking about. It’s just bizarre to me. If you have any questions, before you report, feel free to reach out to me. But jumping to conclusions does your credibility no good.”&nbsp;</p><p>Halligan’s real beef seemed to be with the Times, not me, though she wasn’t saying what was wrong with the Times’s story either. I brought this up in my response, pointing out that my post explicitly credited <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/11/us/politics/letitia-james-indictment-house.html" data-sf-ec-immutable="">the Times story</a>, not my own reporting. “Did they get something wrong?” I asked.<br></p><p>“Yes they did but you went with it!” she said. “Without even fact checking anything!!!!”&nbsp;</p><p>Then she added this: “And they are disclosing grand jury info - which is also not a full representation of what happened. I guess I expect them to do that but I was surprised by you running with it.”<br></p><p>Note that there is nothing improper about the New York Times disclosing grand jury information. The rules of grand jury secrecy, codified in <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcrmp/rule_6" data-sf-ec-immutable="">Rule 6(e) of t</a><a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcrmp/rule_6" data-sf-ec-immutable="">he Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure</a>, don’t apply to the press. And they don’t bind defense attorneys or witnesses either. So if, say, Thompson or her lawyers had dished to the New York Times about her testimony and the Times had reported about her account, nobody would be violating any rule.<br></p><p>On the other hand, it is <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcrmp/rule_6" data-sf-ec-immutable="">generally improper</a> for prosecutors to disclose matters that took place before a grand jury. Rule 6(e) very explicitly covers “an attorney for the government,” and it very specifically prohibits those it covers—subject to certain exceptions—from “disclos[ing] a matter occurring before the grand jury.” And the Justice Manual, which serves as the official statement of Justice Department policies, places <a href="https://www.justice.gov/jm/jm-9-11000-grand-jury" data-sf-ec-immutable="">detailed restrictions</a> on prosecutors’ use of matters before the grand jury. The matters reported on by the Times are matters of which Halligan would be intimately aware, as she is <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/10/politics/letitia-james-case-explained" data-sf-ec-immutable="">reported</a> to have personally presented the case to the grand jury.&nbsp;</p><p>Avoiding grand jury secrecy violations is one reason Justice Department officials so <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2017/10/02/robert-mueller-russia-probe-secret-243345" data-sf-ec-immutable="">frequently offer </a><a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2017/10/02/robert-mueller-russia-probe-secret-243345" data-sf-ec-immutable="">“no comment”</a> on ongoing investigations or cases, preferring instead that the department <a href="https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/speech/attorney-general-merrick-b-garland-delivers-opening-statement-senate-judiciary-committee" data-sf-ec-immutable="">“speak through its court filings.</a><a href="https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/speech/attorney-general-merrick-b-garland-delivers-opening-statement-senate-judiciary-committee" data-sf-ec-immutable="">”</a> And that’s why my dialogue with Halligan struck me as so unusual. Reaching out to a reporter to complain about tweets concerning another publication’s coverage of grand jury testimony seemed uncharacteristically risky for a government lawyer.<br></p><p>I told Halligan that I’d be happy to retract or correct anything I had tweeted that was untrue. “But I can’t do that if I don’t know what the supposed error is,” I said. “Can you be more specific?”<br></p><p>She directed me to the indictment. “It says she received thousand(s) of dollars in rent,” she said, presumably referring to James. Then she added: “I can’t tell you grand jury stuff.”<br></p><p>At this point, I broadly understood Halligan to be conveying a few things to me.&nbsp; The first is that the Times story did indeed disclose grand jury information, but that she believed some part of its account was either inaccurate or misleading or lacked the full context of what occurred. Though she hadn’t explicitly said <em>what</em> grand jury information the Times had disclosed, I interpreted the focus of her ire to be the paper’s account of Thompson’s testimony, which I’d summarized in my tweet.<br></p><p>The second point is that Halligan seemed to be responding in some way to the substance of Thompson’s reported testimony—specifically, that she did not pay rent—by directing me to the indictment, which alleged that James reported “thousand(s)” of dollars in rental income on “tax form(s).”<br></p><p>This did not seem to me to be much of a conflict. I had interpreted the Times to be saying that Thompson was not <em>currently</em> paying rent and had gone for years without doing so, not that she had <em>never</em> paid any rent at any point.<br></p><p>The indictment’s wording on this point is odd and ambiguous. It conspicuously omits the timing and the amount of money in rental income James supposedly reported on her “tax form(s).” And, while the “tax form(s)” are not publicly available, James’s state ethics disclosures are.<br></p><p><a href="https://whitecollarfraud.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2018-to-2023-Letitia-James-Financial-Disclosures.pdf" data-sf-ec-immutable="">Those disclosures report</a> rental income on the Norfolk property only once, back in 2020, for a sum of between $1,000 and $5,000. That James might have collected a relatively small sum of rental income at some point half a decade ago does not contradict the idea that Thompson has lived there for years without paying rent. Nor does it show that James violated her mortgage agreement, given that the contract <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/second-home-rider-rewrite-11555599871?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqdYiN0zOEWG_ZmXuGCu-GNKwV6h7TzaVn-erMKvObNnWA-xJFXhbN2Hg3-tVtc%3D&amp;gaa_ts=68f67b82&amp;gaa_sig=UFQK17cjRwHmmxL76ytAQ1iOgcGHrbi-djFnm7QlRklZPyVT0P8ss7U4l_T-XXGvD3vEgpiWtkpv3DNdKldNNQ%3D%3D" data-sf-ec-immutable="">allowed occasional rentals</a>, even during the first year.</p><p>To be sure, it’s possible that the evidence at trial will show otherwise. But the indictment Halligan had filed, coupled with the publicly available facts, don’t promise that it will. And the specific allegation she’d pointed me to did not on its face contradict the testimony I’d summarized in my tweet.&nbsp;</p><p>Beyond that, though, I still couldn’t understand precisely <em>what </em>Halligan was trying to tell me. Was she suggesting that Thompson had lied to the grand jury? Or that the Times had mischaracterized Thompson’s testimony? Or something else entirely?<br></p><p>I explained my thinking to Halligan in my next response, writing as follows:</p><blockquote>I read the NY Times report as saying that Nakia testified that she lived in the house for years without paying rent. Though the indictment says there were thousands of dollars of rent paid *at one point,* I don’t see that as inconsistent with her testimony as reported by the NY Times. James’s ethics disclosures report between $1,000-$5,000 in rent back in 2020. But after that, she didn’t disclose additional rental income. I’m still not sure I understand what’s incorrect about the NY Times account or my summary of it.<br></blockquote><p>Halligan replied:</p><blockquote><p>Anna,</p><p>You’re biased. Your reporting isn’t accurate. I’m the one handling the case and I’m telling you that. If you want to twist and torture the facts to fit your narrative, there’s nothing I can do. Waste to even give you a heads up.<br></p></blockquote><p>In turn, I reminded Halligan that it was she who had approached me to tell me that I’d compounded or repeated something inaccurate in the Times’s account of Thompson’s testimony. “I am happy to correct it, but I can’t do so without a sense of what I supposedly got wrong,” I said.<br></p><p>“Continue to do what you have been and you’ll be completely discredited when the evidence comes out,” she replied.</p><p>I still wasn’t sure what I’d supposedly gotten wrong, or why she’d contacted me, or what to make of it all.</p><p>And for what it’s worth, the Times doesn’t know either. In a statement to <em>Lawfare</em>, the paper said that the Justice Department had raised no issue with the Times about its story: “We’re confident in the accuracy of our reporting. The DOJ declined to comment before publication and has not raised any concerns with us since the story was published more than a week ago.”</p><p>It was clear that Halligan and I had reached a point of diminishing returns.</p><p>“I’d love to talk further when you are at liberty to be specific,” I said.</p><p>And we left it there—at least for a few hours.</p><p><strong>***</strong></p><p>Later that evening, I followed up with Halligan. She’d seemed frustrated by the end of our conversation that afternoon. But she’d also told me that I could “feel free” to reach out to her if I had any questions. And I wanted to find out if she was serious about that.<br></p><p>“I’m curious for your thoughts more broadly,” I wrote at 9:19 p.m. on Saturday. “What are you most frustrated that reporters aren’t focusing on or writing about with respect to this case?”<br></p><p>“No frustration generally,” she replied. “You’re the only reporter I reached out to.”<br></p><p>The next day, I tried again. I asked if I should expect additional charges against James, as <a href="https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/trumps-favored-prosecutor-is-moving-at-full-steam-8b3cdecb?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqdHnHePvJ-PT4MBAvwmJkH923hWWmBtw12kyV8tZglO8BT9Ic6LhUnXCe72q1c%3D&amp;gaa_ts=68f2af08&amp;gaa_sig=_EIG6DY_NytNy0l-whyS6zFJbDSawqC9W_bnxH1Ljrvo5WIQjD6PWVblfMOaR-NGqAsiAX7RNhHINQCOmY9lyg%3D%3D" data-sf-ec-immutable="">the </a><a href="https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/trumps-favored-prosecutor-is-moving-at-full-steam-8b3cdecb?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqdHnHePvJ-PT4MBAvwmJkH923hWWmBtw12kyV8tZglO8BT9Ic6LhUnXCe72q1c%3D&amp;gaa_ts=68f2af08&amp;gaa_sig=_EIG6DY_NytNy0l-whyS6zFJbDSawqC9W_bnxH1Ljrvo5WIQjD6PWVblfMOaR-NGqAsiAX7RNhHINQCOmY9lyg%3D%3D" data-sf-ec-immutable="">Wall Street Journal</a> had reported over the weekend.<br></p><p>“You don’t report fairly!” Halligan replied. Then she added: “I can’t discuss any potential charges with reporters. If evidence arises that warrants further charges, I’ll look into it!”<br></p><p>I was genuinely confused. Only the previous day, she had essentially invited me to fact-check other outlets’ reporting before tweeting about them. Now she was refusing to engage when I did exactly that. “I thought you said I was welcome to reach out to you about what other outlets are reporting,” I said.<br></p><p>She wrote back: “Why do you report on what other outlets are reporting? If I was you, I’d develop sources myself and out compete them all!”<br></p><p>I expressed my confusion in my next message: “What was the purpose of reaching out to me, if not to open a line of communication? Was it just to insult my reporting?”<br></p><p>“No, it was for you to correct it, which you refused to do,” she replied.<br></p><p>We’d come full circle, back to my tweet summarizing the Times article. Something about it had seemed to strike a nerve with Halligan, but I couldn’t figure out exactly what or why.<br></p><p>“I am more than happy to correct it, but you still haven’t told me what’s incorrect!” I said. “What precisely is wrong with the tweet?”<br></p><p>Halligan didn’t respond.<br></p><p>Over the next several days, I followed up twice more, asking Halligan for her perspective on a variety of questions I had about the James case. My texts went unanswered.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>***</strong><br></p><p>Halligan had said quite a lot during our correspondence, although much of it was hard for me to parse. But there was an important thing she had <em>not</em> said during the entirety of our communications: “Off the record” or “On background” or anything whatsoever about the terms on which we were talking.&nbsp;</p><p>As anyone who professionally engages with the media as routinely as Halligan would know, the default assumption when a reporter speaks with a public official is that everything is “on the record,” meaning that anything the source says can be printed with attribution. If the source wishes to speak confidentially, she can negotiate how the information will be used. “On background” means that the information the source provides to a journalist can be published, so long as the journalist doesn’t reveal the source’s name or identifying information. “Off the record” means the reporter can’t print what the source tells them at all. There are other variations too. But with any condition, a fundamental premise is that the reporter must <em>agree </em>to speak on that basis.<br></p><p>In the course of my work as a journalist, I frequently agree to speak with sources on background or off the record. I take my duty of confidentiality seriously and I have never burned a source by revealing confidential communications.<br></p><p>I certainly would have been willing to speak with Halligan on background or off the record. But she never raised the terms on which we were speaking at any point during the two days in which we exchanged texts.&nbsp;<br></p><p>After Saturday evening’s message, she went radio silent. By the end of the week, this much was clear: U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan was ghosting me.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>***</strong><br></p><p>Even now, I remain mystified by Halligan’s texts to me. She is currently the most scrutinized prosecutor in the country, widely seen as hand-picked to prosecute her boss’s political enemies.&nbsp; Even the slightest misstep could be seized on and picked apart by defense counsel representing James, who <a href="https://transcripts.cnn.com/show/cnc/date/2025-10-14/segment/03" data-sf-ec-immutable="">analysts expect</a> will<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2025/10/15/letitia-james-indictment-defense-interview-00607888" data-sf-ec-immutable=""> seek dismissal</a> of her charges based on selective or vindictive prosecution.<br></p><p>It’s not as if Halligan didn’t understand the rules of engagement with the press. For years, she worked as a member of Trump’s criminal defense team, which routinely courted media attention, despite <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/08/us/politics/trumps-lawyers-jack-smith-justice-department.html" data-sf-ec-immutable="">accusing</a><a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/08/us/politics/trumps-lawyers-jack-smith-justice-department.html&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1760992934198748&amp;usg=AOvVaw3nRuG0WRHhDM_2ia4jaIKA" data-sf-ec-immutable=""> prosecutors</a> of improper leaks. And now, as a prosecutor herself, she has accused former FBI director Comey of lying about whether he authorized a colleague at the bureau to serve as an anonymous source in news reports about an ongoing investigation. A central issue in that case, which Halligan reportedly also <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/26/politics/james-comey-indictment-trump-prosecution" data-sf-ec-immutable="">presented to the grand jury herself</a>, concerns the nature of interactions between reporters and federal law enforcement sources.<br></p><p>So the irony was hard to ignore when, just days after she texted me, Halligan <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/17/politics/lindsey-halligan-ousts-more-prosecutors-eastern-district-virginia" data-sf-ec-immutable="">reportedly fired</a> two senior career prosecutors for supposedly “leaking ‘unauthorized’ information to the press.” That same week, she released a statement in response to <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/news/trumps-doj-punitive-firings-public-scoldings-pressure-prosecute-foes-rcna237622" data-sf-ec-immutable="">an MSNBC story</a> about a separate case against a Democratic state lawmaker. “EDVA enforces a strict zero-tolerance policy on the unauthorized disclosure of information concerning ongoing investigations or cases,” she said. In the same story, Justice Department spokesman Chad Gilmartin is quoted saying: “While we do not confirm the existence of, nor comment on, specific investigations outside of our public filings, any Department employee who leaks deliberative or investigative developments only jeopardizes the integrity of investigations and the incredible work of federal law enforcement.”&nbsp;</p><p>For someone so attuned to the risks of speaking out of turn—and so willing to punish others for allegedly doing so—Halligan’s decision to reach out to me over text remains baffling.<br></p><p>She knew I was a journalist. She approached me. She invited my questions. She even encouraged me to stop chasing other reporters’ stories and focus on my own.<br></p><p>Turns out, she gave me a great one.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>Epilogue</em></strong><br></p><p>Earlier today, I reached out to the Justice Department’s Office of Public Affairs, seeking comment for this story. In addition to a transcript of my Signal exchange with Halligan, I also outlined some of my questions related to the story: Were these authorized communications? Is it consistent with DOJ policy or other applicable guidance for senior Justice Department officials to discuss ongoing prosecutions on Signal disappearing messages? Does the Department take the position that the contents of the messages are consistent with its legal obligations and DOJ policy? Does Halligan deny that these were in fact her texts? Does the Justice Department dispute any of the facts reported in the New York Times article discussed in my exchange with Halligan?<br></p><p>I told the Justice Department that my deadline was 4:15 p.m.<br></p><p>In response, the department sent the statement quoted at the outset of this piece. In addition, just a few minutes before the deadline, my dormant Signal connection with Halligan suddenly came alive again.<br></p><p>At 4:10 p.m., she texted me: “By the way—everything I ever sent you is off record. You’re not a journalist so it’s weird saying that but just letting you know.”<br></p><p>I responded: “I’m sorry, but that’s not how this works. You don’t get to say that in retrospect.”<br></p><p>Halligan was unpersuaded: “Yes I do. Off record.”&nbsp;</p><p>“I am really sorry. I would have been happy to speak with you on an off the record basis had you asked,” I said. “But you didn’t ask, and I still haven’t agreed to speak on that basis. Do you have any further comment for the story?&nbsp;</p><p>To my surprise, she kept going: “It’s obvious the whole convo is off record. There’s disappearing messages and it’s on signal. What is your story? You never told me about a story.”<br></p><p>I didn’t respond. It was time to publish my story. I’ll text it to her.<em></em><br></p><p><em>Postscript: Read </em><a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26190909-signal-screenshots/" data-sf-ec-immutable=""><em>the full exchange between </em></a><a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26190909-signal-screenshots/" data-sf-ec-immutable=""><em>Lindsey Halligan and </em>Lawfare’<em>s Anna Bower here</em></a><em>.</em><br></p>

        <h2>Magit Is Amazing!</h2>
        <p>
            I was reading a post about Jujutsu version control system the other day and that just made me realize how awesome is Magit!

    <article>
        <p>I’ve been hearing a lot about <a href="https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jujutsu</a>
 VCS lately, and when I say a lot I mean maybe 5 times this year. But that is a lot for a new VCS I would say.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.stavros.io/posts/switch-to-jujutsu-already-a-tutorial/?utm_source=changelog-news" target="_blank" rel="noopener">article</a>
 I came across mostly goes through the flexibility of Jujutsu VCS over <a href="https://git-scm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Git</a>
, or at least that’s as far as I managed to read before I lost interest. I was thinking “<em>you can easily do this using Git???</em>”, but then I realized that I’ve actually never used Git for almost anything besides cloning repositories… I’ve always been using <a href="https://magit.vc/" title="Magit! 🪄" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Magit</a>
 for almost everything.</p>
<p>Sometimes I think whether it would have been better if I started using Git CLI and then switched to Magit, that way I would really understand why it’s called that way, rather than taking all the amazing work behind it for granted. But I think afterall I wouldn’t have discovered Git commands so early in my career if I had just used the Git CLI from the start. I remember I was stashing my code changes back in my early career while other coworkers were struggling to move to another branch without losing their changes.</p>
<p>I’m pretty sure this isn’t all what Jujutsu is about, but now I really don’t feel like giving it a try anytime soon because of that article.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In the grand tradition of tech outages turning everyday life into a farce, Monday's massive Amazon Web Services (AWS) disruption didn't just take down <a href="https://quasa.io/media/instagram-launches-location-sharing-maps-inspired-by-snapchat">Snapchat</a>, <a href="https://quasa.io/media/ryan-kaji-the-13-year-old-multimillionaire-building-a-virtual-empire-in-roblox">Roblox</a>, and <a href="https://quasa.io/media/fortnite-set-to-return-to-iphone-in-australia-as-epic-wins-partial-victory-against-apple-and-google">Fortnite</a> - it left thousands of sleep-deprived users sweating bullets in their own beds. While the world scrambled to reload their feeds, owners of Eight Sleep's high-tech Pod3 mattress covers discovered a chilling reality: their "smart" sleep sanctuaries had no offline mode. Zero. Zilch. In a world where even your fridge can survive a Wi-Fi blackout, who knew your bed couldn't?</p>

<p><img alt="" height="188" src="https://quasa.io/storage/photos/00/photo_2025-10-20_19-32-46.jpg" width="300">The outage, which AWS confirmed stemmed from "increased error rates and latencies" in its US-EAST-1 region, rippled across the internet starting around 3 a.m. ET on October 20, 2025. By mid-morning, Downdetector had logged over eight million reports, with everything from banking apps to gaming platforms grinding to a halt.</p>

<p>But amid the chaos, one corner of the web lit up with uniquely absurd complaints: Eight Sleep's support site and social channels flooded with pleas from users whose mattresses had effectively gone on strike.</p>

<p>These $2,000+ gadgets, billed as AI-powered sleep coaches that track heart rate, monitor sleep stages, and dynamically adjust temperature via water-cooled coils, suddenly reverted to being glorified foam bricks.</p>

<p><img alt="" height="447" src="https://quasa.io/storage/photos/00/image%20-%202025-10-20T194135.824.jpg" width="300">Picture this: You're tucked in, ready for a night of optimized REM cycles, when your app pings an error. No more tweaking the chill to a crisp 55°F or firing up the "cool mode" for those midnight hot flashes.</p>

<p>The core temperature control? Utterly crippled without the cloud. Users reported the app freezing on loading screens, refusing to connect, and leaving them stranded in whatever thermal hell their last setting dictated.</p>

<p>Eight Sleep's system, which relies on backend servers for everything from real-time adjustments to data syncing, had no fallback. "It's unacceptable," fumed one early complainant on X, echoing the frustration of many who shelled out for "seamless" smart sleep only to face analog purgatory.</p>

<p>The hits kept coming. Smart sleep tracking? Dead in the water—no logging of phases, no biometric insights, just a void where your sleep score should be. Preset schedules, like the cheekily named "Prepare Bed for Sleep" routine that cues gentle warming or ambient vibes, fizzled out entirely, as all automations demand an internet lifeline to Eight Sleep's servers.</p>

<p>Even physical controls fared poorly: Touch panels on the Hub (the mattress's brain box) became unresponsive or glitchy, with some users noting they were "extremely inconvenient" at best - designed more as app backups than standalone saviors. And in the outage's cruelest twist, a handful of Pods straight-up froze. One Reddit thread devolved into a chorus of "my bed is bricked," with owners unable to reboot without cloud clearance.</p>

<p><img alt="" height="447" src="https://quasa.io/storage/photos/00/image%20-%202025-10-20T194138.665.jpg" width="300">Then there's the tweet that broke the internet's funny bone - and possibly a few marriages. Tech enthusiast Alex Browne, armed with an Eight Sleep Pod3, had programmed his mattress to preemptively heat up by +9°F above room temperature before bedtime. "I like it warm to ease in," he explained in a viral post that racked up thousands of likes and eye-rolls.</p>

<p>But when AWS went dark, the system locked into that toasty preset, disabling any cooling override. Browne spent the night marinating in his own perspiration, tweeting updates like a man betrayed: "Backend outage means I'm sleeping in a sauna.</p>

<p>Eight Sleep confirmed - no offline mode yet, but they're 'working on it'." Commenters piled on with dystopian jabs: "Next up: Subscription paywalls for your pillow fluffiness" and "Jeff Bezos is personally cranking my thermostat." By evening, as AWS reported "significant recovery," Browne's saga had morphed into a meme goldmine, spotlighting the absurdity of outsourcing your snooze to the cloud.</p>

<p>Eight Sleep isn't alone in this IoT vulnerability - AWS powers a staggering chunk of the smart home ecosystem, from Ring doorbells to Alexa plugs, all of which blinked out during the outage.</p>

<p>But mattresses? That's peak irony. Humans have napped on rocks for millennia without needing server pings, yet here we are, one faulty data center away from nocturnal disaster. The company, which touts over 50 clinical studies on its tech, has faced prior scrutiny too—like a 2024 security report uncovering exposed AWS keys that let engineers remotely SSH into users' beds, raising hackles about data privacy and backdoor access. (Imagine your ex tweaking the vibes from afar.)</p>

<p>As the dust settles - with AWS mostly back online by 6 a.m. ET and Eight Sleep restoring controls - this episode serves as a wake-up call (pun intended). Smart tech promises utopia, but without robust offline fallbacks, it's just expensive fragility. For now, if you're an Eight Sleep devotee, keep a fan handy - and maybe a low-tech backup plan. Because in the words of one sweat-soaked survivor: "What won't they cloud-ify next? My dreams?"</p></div></div>]]></description>

</svg><p><span data-astro-cid-dlsoufvo="">I am a programmer.</span>  A coder. A keyboard cowboy. A hacker. My day is spent
punching keys; catalyzing code. It’s fun; it’s my identity. The editor, Vim, is
my workshop, my sanctum<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-1" id="user-content-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup>. Here, I hone my craft, sharpen my tools, expand my
capabilities through curiosity, and for a while, escape into a trance-like
flow. A full-screen terminal window with nothing between me and thought but
INSERT mode. At the altar of Bram<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-2" id="user-content-fnref-2" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup>, I spin reality’s yarn out of thin air
into bits beaming through silicon. A completely imagined, non-tangible world
with IRL ramifications. A place in which I find comfort in craft and
creativity. Time disappears into puzzle-solving. Where connecting pieces
matters more than completing a picture. Craft springs from fingers to buffer. I
program and fade away into flow and composition.</p><p>In the late 1950s at MIT, a new and electrifying culture was emerging. Hands-on,
experimental, and anti-establishment. I like to imagine myself there, sitting
at the slate-blue L-shaped console. Typing away at the Flexowriter<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-3" id="user-content-fnref-3" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">3</a></sup> as it
spits out punched paper tape programs to be fed to the nearby wall of metal
uprights, tangled wire, and early transistors; the “Tixo”<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-4" id="user-content-fnref-4" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">4</a></sup>. Waiting with
bated breath, as enthralling beeps emanate from the machinery while it runs the
program: will it succeed? I imagine the Hackers—as they came to be known—around
me, pointing at code and offering advice on how to achieve “The Right
Thing”<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-5" id="user-content-fnref-5" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">5</a></sup>: the perfect program, pristine, elegant, and succinct. I can sense
the original culture of programming pouring out of them as they passionately
embody <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_ethic">“The Hacker Ethic”</a> while
sharing stubs of their own paper programs to guide me on my quest.</p><p>It was there—in the computing crucible of building 26—that the craft of coding
was cast. Nearly 70 years ago, members of the Tech Model Railroad Club immersed
themselves in the language of machines to pursue a mastery of digital wizardry.
The sublime magic of manipulating formal languages to solve increasingly
challenging cryptic conundrums and—core to the culture—sharing findings with
other students of the dark arts of software sorcery.</p><p>The ghosts of ancient Hackers past still roam the machines and—through the
culture they established—our minds. Their legacy of the forging of craft
lingers. A deep and kinetic craft we’ve extended and built a passionate
industry on. We are driven by the same wonder, sense of achievement, and
elegance of puzzle-solving as they were. Still driven by “The Right Thing.”
These constitutional ideas, the very identity of programmers, are increasingly
imperiled. Under threat. The future of programming, once so bright and
apparent, is now cloaked in foreboding darkness, grifts, and uncertainty.</p><hr><p>In fact, if we are to trust the billion-dollar AI industry, the denizens of
Hacker News (and its overlords), and the LinkedIn legions of LLM lunatics, the
future of software development has little resemblance to programming.
Vibe-coding—what seemed like a meme a year ago—is becoming a mainstay.</p><p>Presently (though this changes constantly), the court of vibe fanatics would
have us write specifications in Markdown instead of code. Gone is the deep
engagement and the depth of craft we are so fluent in: time spent in the
corners of codebases, solving puzzles, and uncovering well-kept secrets.
Instead, we are to embrace scattered cognition and context switching between a
swarm of Agents that are doing our thinking for us. Creative puzzle-solving is
left to the machines, and we become mere operators disassociated from our
craft.</p><hr><p>Some—more than I imagined—seem to welcome this change, this new identity:
“Specification Engineering.” Excited to be an operator and cosplaying as Steve
Jobs to “Play the Orchestra”. One could only wonder why they became a
programmer in the first place, given their seeming disinterest in coding. Did
they confuse Woz with Jobs?</p><p>I can’t imagine (though perhaps I’m not very imaginative) that Prompt, Context,
or Specification “Engineering”<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-6" id="user-content-fnref-6" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">6</a></sup> would lead to a bright and prosperous
profession for programmers. It reeks of a devaluation of craft, skill, and
labor. A new identity where our unique set of abstract thinking skills isn’t
really required; moving us into a realm already occupied by product managers
and designers.</p><p>Inside companies, power dynamics are shifting as this new identity is pushed.
In a mad dash to increase productivity in the wrong place<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-7" id="user-content-fnref-7" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">7</a></sup>, developers are
forced to use LLMs in increasingly specific ways. Conform or be cast out. Use
the products that herald our obsolescence, or resign. Scarcely has management
mandated such specifics of our tools before. Tools, like those of a chef or
carpenter, that we’ve taken great pride in curating and honing ourselves:
careful configuration of our editor, tinkering with dot files, and dev
environments. As part of the craft, we’ve been dedicated and devoted to
personalizing our toolsets to match our thinking. It feels like a violation to
have this be decreed by management, who have little to no connection to the
day-to-day, and who should instead be concerned with outcomes, process, and
facilitating creativity. For decades, programmers have been pampered within
companies. These narratives offer a new way for management to tip the balance
back in their favor.</p><hr><p>Some—with glee and anticipation—liken LLMs and their impact to the transition
from low-level to high-level languages: from Assembly to Fortran. This, I
think, is wrong in a couple of ways: firstly, because the leap we made with
Fortran was rooted in programming, Fortran didn’t try to eliminate a craft but
built on top of it. Fortran didn’t remove the precision and expressibility of
programmatic formalisms, but expanded them. Secondly, Fortran was always
successful in producing the right outcome given its input. None of these things
is true in the world of LLMs. I can practically hear the cultists cry out:
“You’re just using it wrong” as they move the goalposts to fit an ever-changing
narrative. But we can’t expect AI tools to have the same outcomes as
programming languages. They are designed based on a different set of rules and
parameters.</p><p>There aren’t enough swear words in the English language to adequately describe
how frustrating computers and programming can be, but we have at least always
been able to count on them for precision: to perform exactly as instructed
through programming. It is perhaps because of our reliance and trust in the
precision of computers that we seem so primed to believe chatbots when they
gaslight us into thinking they did what we asked of them<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-8" id="user-content-fnref-8" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">8</a></sup>.</p><p>LLMs and the work with them are naturally imprecise. Both in the properties of
Large Language Models, and in the very manner we instruct them:
misinterpretable natural languages. Curious that we chose this approach to
computing, given how much we, programmers, cringe at non-determinism. We prefer
predictability, compositionality, idempotence, and integration tests that
aren’t flaky. LLM code represents the opposite of that: inconsistent chaos.</p><p>Dijkstra, in <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/transcriptions/EWD06xx/EWD667.html">“On the foolishness of ‘natural language
programming’,”</a>
wrote, rather poignantly: “We have to challenge the assumptions that natural
languages would simplify work.” And: “The virtue of formal texts is that their
manipulation, in order to be legitimate, need to satisfy only a few simple
rules; they are, when you come to think of it, an amazingly effective tool for
ruling out all sorts of nonsense that, when we use our native tongues, are
almost impossible to avoid.”</p><hr><p>There’s a movement to distance AI-assisted development (Agents in the driver’s
seat) from vibe-coding by imposing rigor and bureaucracy, but it ignores the
fundamental nature of the beast. I find that I don’t read the code an LLM
generates for me as closely as I would if I had written it myself or had
reviewed it in a PR. There seems to be something innate to LLM coding that
makes my eyes glaze over. I gloss. Overwhelmed and bored. Blindly accepting
spiked pitfalls, provided CI passes and the program compiles. Not checking if
the tests are even set up to run, or if it pulled in a nonexistent library or
implemented a whole one itself. Of course, I pay the price later, when I fall
into my own trap and realize that hours of work were built on a broken bedrock.
Or maybe I don’t notice till someone calls me out in a pull request, a bug
report, or when I’m paged for an incident.</p><p>A review or synopsis of a book can never replace the experience of reading it
yourself: contemplating ideas for hours and 100s of pages as each sentence is
carefully consumed. In the same way, skimming summaries of completed AI tasks
robs us of forming a deep understanding of the domain, the problem, and the
possible solutions; it robs us of being connected to the codebase. Taking the
plunge into the abyss of one’s ignorance to reveal, learn, and understand a
topic and its implications is both gratifying and crucial to good software.
Ownership, agency, and deep, fulfilling work have been replaced with scattered
attention spent between tabs of Agents.</p><p>Joan Didion, the great American essayist, famously wrote: <a href="https://lithub.com/joan-didion-why-i-write/">“I write entirely to
find out what I’m thinking, what I’m looking at, what I see and what it
means.”</a> Peter Naur explores this
same concept in his work, <a href="https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/Naur.pdf">“Programming as Theory
Building.”</a> Naur’s “Theory” embodies
the understanding of a codebase. How it operates, its formalisms, and its
representations of the real world. A context and insight that is only gained
from immersion. Naur describes the “Theory” as the primary outcome of
programming, the actual product, as opposed to the software it resulted in.
Only with a well-developed “Theory” can one effectively apply extensions and
bug fixes to codebases. With the ambivalent glances at code that comes with
vibing, building such a theory is difficult. Naur would deem it impossible, I’m
sure.</p><p>Good design emerges from immersion. From steeping. From back-and-forth work in
the text buffer and, often, away from the keyboard. It’s impossible to hold a
whole codebase in our minds. We must dive into modules, classes, and functions
to sharpen our blurry mental models. Read and write code to <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11119124">extend our
cognition</a>, regain familiarity,
and understanding of the problem domain.</p><p>Once a semblance of context has been conjured, and through a plentitude of poor
attempts, we can finally uncover the solution. The dissonance of bad design
must be felt: it’s only when we write repulsive and repetitive code that we
realize that there is a better, more succinct, elegant, compositional, and
reusable way. It causes pause. A step back to think about the problem deeply.
Start over. Rinse repeat. Diametrically, AI Agent work is frictionless; we
avoid alternative solutions and can’t know if what we accept is flawless,
mediocre, terrible, or even harmful. Quality is crafted by iteration—how else
might we imagine good designs if we never explore objectionable ones?</p><hr><p>The cognitive debt of LLM-laden coding extends beyond disengagement of our
craft. We’ve all heard the stories. Hyped up, vibed up, slop-jockeys with
attention spans shorter than the framework-hopping JavaScript devs of the early
2010s, sling their sludge in pull requests and design docs, discouraging
collaboration and disrupting teams. Code reviewing coworkers are rapidly losing
their minds as they come to the crushing realization that they are now the
first layer of quality control instead of one of the last. Asked to review;
forced to pick apart. Calling out freshly added functions that are never
called, hallucinated library additions, and obvious runtime or compilation
errors. All while the author—who clearly only skimmed their “own” code—is
taking no responsibility, going “whoopsie, Claude wrote that. Silly AI, ha-ha.”</p><p>Meddling managers and penny-pinching execs are pushing (hopefully unknowingly)
for fewer human interactions on teams. Isolated and bereft of connection, we
are now empowered and encouraged to build walls around our work experience.
Reaching for LLMs rather than people when we need a pair programmer, someone to
ping pong solutions with, prototype, sketch architectures with, or help answer
expert questions about esoteric parts of the codebase. We no longer require
onboarding buddies, mentors, or peers; instead, we can talk to machines. With
LLMs, avoiding human contact is so easy that it might just become the norm. The
future really <em>is</em> bright…</p><hr><p>It’s disturbing how agreeable we are to the AI hype narrative and actively
participate in the planned erasure of our craft<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-9" id="user-content-fnref-9" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">9</a></sup>, and so willingly offer up
our means of thinking. We were the lucky ones who got to earn a living from our
hobbies. Even if we produce punctilious and rigid processes to counter slop—as
some support with a striking similarity to the waterfall model of yore—we’ve
still outsourced the fun part of the job and replaced it with directorial
drudgery. What’s next, TPS reports?</p><p>LLMs seem like a nuke-it-from-orbit solution to the complexities of software.
Rather than addressing the actual problems, we reached for something far more
complex and nebulous to cure the symptoms. I don’t really mind replacing <code>sed</code>
with Claude or asking it for answers about a library or framework that, after
hours of hunting through docs, I still seek clarity on<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-10" id="user-content-fnref-10" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">10</a></sup>. But I profoundly
do not want to be merely an operator or code reviewer: taking a backseat to the
fun and interesting work. I want to drive, immerse myself in craft, play <em>in</em>
the orchestra, and solve complex puzzles. I want to remain a programmer, a
craftsperson.</p><p>I prefer my tools to help me with repetitive tasks (and there are many of those
in programming), understanding codebases, and authoring correct programs. I
take offense at products that are designed to think for me. To remove the
agency of my own understanding of the software I produce, and to cut
connections with my coworkers. Even if LLMs lived up to the hype, we would
still stand to lose all of that and our craft. Humans matter more than machines
and their backing corporations, who are profiting while the rest of us chase
the new American Dream they sell. As payment, we offer our critical thinking
skills, our fun, our craft, our privacy, and perhaps, our planet.</p></div></div>]]></description>

Text adventures are weird. They are so weird I don’t know how to write this
article, so prepare to read something even more rambly than usual. Normally,
when this happens, I decide not to publish the article. But
</p>

<ol>
<li>I really want to share my enthusiasm for text adventures, and</li>

<li>I needed something to link to when I wrote that article on <a href="https://entropicthoughts.com/lessons-from-creating-first-text-adventure.html">what I learned
from creating my text adventure</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Let’s go!
</p>
<section id="outline-container-text-adventures-have-awesome-properties">
<h2 id="text-adventures-have-awesome-properties">Text adventures have awesome properties</h2>
<p>
Here’s a list of cool properties of text adventures.
</p>
<div id="outline-container-freedom">
<h2 id="freedom">Freedom</h2>
<div id="text-orgd362409">
<p>
Text adventures give the player a lot of freedom.
</p>

<p>
In graphical games, the player character can act in at best a handful of
significantly different ways in any given situation<label for="fn.1">1</label><span><sup>1</sup> Not counting small
variations. Using different types of attack is still attacking, for example.
Entering into dialogue is still one action, however deep the dialogue is.</span>. In a
text adventure, the player character typically has ten or twenty meaningfully
different ways to act in any given situation.
</p>

<p>
This freedom is liberating: even though the player cannot literally do anything
they want, a well-designed text adventure really makes it seem as though they
could, by having programmed generic interactions between actions and objects.
This freedom can also be used to good effect to give the user alternatives for
solving puzzles.<label for="fn.2">2</label><span><sup>2</sup> Such as when, faced with a foosball table, one solution can
be to <code>TAKE BALL. PUT BALL IN GOAL</code>.</span>
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-non-graphical-and-non-literal-experiences">
<h2 id="non-graphical-and-non-literal-experiences">Non-graphical and non-literal experiences</h2>
<div id="text-org3e383cd">
<p>
By being non-graphical, text adventures have the benefit of conveying things
without having to represent them literally. In a graphical game, if we wish to
represent a large city, we must model a literal large city, with thousands of
buildings. In a text adventure, we can instead describe the city such that it
feels large, whicle modelling only very few buildings.
</p>

<p>
Another example of the ingraphicality of the medium is that text adventures can
represent non-visual effects; we can model other senses than vision, like smell
and touch.
</p>

<p>
With text, we can also present an abstract space much easier than with graphics,
which tend to the literal.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-cheaper-dynamic-environments">
<h2 id="cheaper-dynamic-environments">Cheaper dynamic environments</h2>
<p>
Text adventures can more easily support dynamic environments. In a graphical
game, dynamic environments require complicated physics and animations. This – in
addition to the effort of graphical and sound design – makes graphical games
more expensive to create than text adventures. Many of the greatest text
adventures of all time were developed as pet projects by single developers in
their spare time.<label for="fn.3">3</label><span><sup>3</sup> From what I understand, text adventures are even used to
prototype narratives and mechanics in some big game studios.</span>
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-mature-technology">
<h2 id="mature-technology">Mature technology</h2>
<div id="text-org8924178">
<p>
If all of the above is not intriguing enough, let’s also mention that text
adventures are a mature technology. They were some of the first computer games
ever created. It’s difficult to find a computer that cannot run text adventures.
</p>

<p>
Great! But what … are they?

<p>
CURVING HALL, WEST END
</p>

<p>
The curving corridor ends here, in a blank plaster wall relieved by a single
window. The window looks out on a strange subterranean prospect to the west. You
can return east, pass through the archway to the north, or try the closed door
to the south.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<b>&gt; look at window</b>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
A broad glass pane looks out over a dark cavern. This end of the corridor seems
to be deep underground. A natural cave spreads out below; its mammoth columns
and cascades of flowstone are only dimly picked out by the candlelight behind
you. The farther reaches are hidden in darkness. But the shining waterfall
before you is easily visible. A stream pours in from your right, tumbles from a
ledge, and plummets into a pit beneath the window. The water seems to sparkle
with some natural phosphorescence.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<b>&gt; break window</b>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The glass ignores your assault.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<b>&gt; enter archway</b>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
ARBORETUM
</p>

<p>
The walls here are painted white and are utterly undecorated. An archway leads
south. In the center of the room stands an earthenware tub. From it sprouts a
tangle of vines, broad fan-like leaves, and an enormous golden flower. The
luxuriant growth clashes, you think, with the room’s stark emptiness.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<b>&gt; look at flower</b>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The plant sits alone in its pot, in the center of the empty room. The golden
flower is nearly the size of your head. It rises from a tangle of vines and
leaves that would better suit an unexplored south-coast swamp than someone’s
home.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<b>&gt; take flower</b>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The plant’s stems look too thick to break.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<b>&gt; smell flower</b>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
You lean forward and take a deep breath of the
flower’s aroma.
</p>

<p>
Memory nearly bursts through.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This moves us to
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
DANK JUNGLE (IN THE EARTHENWARE TUB)
</p>

<p>
You are standing waist-deep in an empty earthenware tub, in the midst of a
trackless jungle.
</p>

<p>
Heavy, entangled trunks and vines loom in every direction, as far as you can see
– and you can’t see far. The sky is entirely obscured by layers of vegetation.
Only a murky green light filters down to you. But golden flowers dot the trees,
like bursts of sun.
</p>

<p>
An iron key is balanced neatly on the edge of the tub.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<b>&gt; take key</b>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Taken.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<b>&gt; get out of tub</b>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
You swing your legs out of the tub, and find the world swinging around you…
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This moves us to
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
ARBORETUM
</p>

<p>
The walls of the room are painted in green slashes, like the trunks of uncounted
trees, and splashed with gold. An archway leads south. A hint of sweet-rank
perfume touches you as you breathe.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<b>&gt; inventory</b>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
You are carrying an iron key.
</p>
</blockquote>


<p>
We explored a space in a building set into a cave, and smelling the flower got
us transported … into a memory? Or literally miniaturised and into the tub? We
were able to bring the iron key, after all. Did we even emerge into the same
room, given that the description changed? It’s not made clear, and this
ambiguity is okay in text – each reader will get to play their own preferred
version of the game.
</p>

<p>
Of course, this is a game by an author that is known for abstract mechanics.
There are also games that are far more traditional in their mechanics. When I
stop playing <i>Plundered Hearts</i><label for="fn.5">5</label><span><sup>5</sup> <i>Plundered Hearts</i>; Infocom; Infocom; 1987.
<a href="https://iplayif.com/?story=https%3A%2F%2Feblong.com%2Finfocom%2Fgamefiles%2Fplunderedhearts-r26-s870730.z3">Playable online</a>.</span> I can almost hear the chirping of the jungle and the lapping
of the waves against the island where I’m stalking around a large house trying
to figure out how to get into the ongoing ball.
</p>

<p>
It shouldn’t come as a surprise. Novels – and spoken stories – have transported
readers to fantastical locations for ages. But I still didn’t know text
adventures could be so immersive.
</p>
</div>
</section>
<section id="outline-container-interaction-in-text-adventures">
<h2 id="interaction-in-text-adventures">Interaction in text adventures</h2>
<div id="text-org285bcf1">
<p>
The bright reader has already figured out how interaction works in text
adventures: the game prints a brief paragraph of text describing the players’
immediate environment or the result of their last action, followed by a prompt
sign, after which the player types in what they want to do next.<label for="fn.6">6</label><span><sup>6</sup> There are
technical differences here between <i>narrator</i>, <i>player character</i>, and <i>player</i>
but we’ll brush past that for the moment.</span>
</p>

<p>
The instructions the player types into the prompt look like English, but they
follow a fairly strict format used in almost all text adventures by convention.
These are recognised by a component of the game called the <i>parser</i>. Despite the
strict format, some of the joy of playing these text adventures is trying
something crazy, like in <i>Plundered Hearts</i> when we stand on the balcony above
the ballroom, see the rope on which the chandelier is attached, type <code>SWING ON
ROPE</code> … and the player character comes crashing down onto the dancing guests
with a big “Aiieeee!” It’s outside the conventional commands, but it makes sense
and the author catered for it.
</p>

<p>
Text adventures typically take a simulationist approach to narration. This means
the author has not specified what happens in any given situation. Instead, what
happens next is determined mechanistically by the player’s actions given the
current world state. Maybe we need to cross a violent river, but it’s up to us
if we want to block it, re-route it, magically freeze it, or jetpack over it.
The progress is gated on being able to cross, not how that ability is achieved.
</p>

<p>
The violent river is an example of a <i>puzzle</i>, which are usually strewn
throughout text adventures. These puzzles are used to pace the narrative, and
avoid dumping everything on the player at once. Obstacles get placed in the way
of progress, and the player needs to find ways around them to experience more of
the story.
</p>

<p>
The puzzle-pacing of text adventures means they can often contain a lot more
detail and flavour text than a corresponding novel, because the player slowly
uncovers the text they are most interested in, and are free to ignore the
rest.<label for="fn.7">7</label><span><sup>7</sup> Well, any information needed to solve puzzles cannot be ignored, of
course. Old school games tended to hide such information in the most innocuous
places, requiring careful searching of every nook and cranny to proceed. Modern
games, by contrast, tend to be more forgiving and hint more actively at which
locations are important to search.</span>

<div id="text-org66a4f32">
<p>
At some point I would like to do a formal comparison of text adventure puzzles
by way of grounded theory<label for="fn.8">8</label><span><sup>8</sup> That is the only hammer I have for extracting
structure and meaning from unstructured accounts.</span>. That is out of scope of this
article, so we’ll look at one sloppy categorisation of interest:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Lock-and-key: we must possess a specific item to get past an obstacle. We find
the item by observing the environment carefully.</li>
<li>Lock-and-password: we must perform a specific action to get past an obstacle.
We learn about the action by observing the environment. Tougher puzzles
require astuter observation, sometimes even catching on to background
patterns.</li>
<li>Change-the-self: we must alter our appearance to get past an obstacle. This
can be considered a combination of key- and password-based puzzles: we must
find the item that masks our appearance, and then be perceptive enough to know
when to wear it.</li>
<li>Change-an-item: converting one item to another is fairly common, either by
performing the right action on it or by combining it with the right other items.</li>
<li>Change-the-environment: we must rearrange the environment in a way that makes
actions possible that were previously unthinkable, unreasonable, or nonsensical.</li>
</ul>

<p>
There are some puzzle types that might not fit into the above categories.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Waiting-based puzzles: where just quietly waiting for one or more turns makes
something happen.</li>
<li>Persistance-based puzzles: where doing something once has an effect that is
not quite useful, but doing it many times has an effect that is very useful.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Either of these could be considered lock-and-password puzzles, only with the
password being to repeat an action.
</p>

<p>
We could also categorise puzzles into what sort of simulation they are based on,
e.g. whether they simulate human senses<label for="fn.9">9</label><span><sup>9</sup> Requiring observing the environment
in particular ways, or manipulating the senses of others such as shouting to
wake someone up.</span>, or physical systems<label for="fn.10">10</label><span><sup>10</sup> Getting items to increase leverage,
throwing things at other things to dislodge them, getting something large to
block a view, etc.</span>, or machines<label for="fn.11">11</label><span><sup>11</sup> Figuring out how to run a bread dispensing
machine, or how an orrery evolves to bring an item closer to the ground.</span>, or
magic systems<label for="fn.12">12</label><span><sup>12</sup> These simulations need to be internally consistent, but they
may not correspond to any natural laws we know from our world.</span>, or the desires
of other people<label for="fn.13">13</label><span><sup>13</sup> Giving people things, showing them things, feeding animals,
etc.</span>.

<p>
Text adventures are generally free<label for="fn.14">14</label><span><sup>14</sup> In the sense of gratis, but also
sometimes libre.</span>. They spawned out of the culture of free sharing at <abbr>mit</abbr> and
other universities, and they are passion projects to date. Most games are
released in competitions, and all big competitions have rules that stipulate
playing the game must be free. There are good reasons to try playing them, and
few reasons not to.
</p>

<p>
At this point, you know more about text adventures than I did when I started
out. Here are some games I have played and which I think aren’t terrible for a
beginner:
</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://iplayif.com/?story=https%3A%2F%2Fifarchive.org%2Fif-archive%2Fgames%2Fcompetition97%2Ftads%2Fglow%2Fglow.gam">Glowgrass (1997)</a>: You crash land in an overgrown Ancient settlement, and the
eerie starts to take on a familiar face as you end up learning more about what

game. But boy are there many distractions when a distractable person just
needs to write.</li>

<li><a href="https://iplayif.com/?story=https%3A%2F%2Fifarchive.org%2Fif-archive%2Fgames%2Fzcode%2Fdreamhold.z8">The Dreamhold (2004)</a>: You wake up in a wizard’s Dreamhold with no memory. As
you explore, some things come back to you. Eventually you gather all masks and
you figure out what you need to do to finish what you started.</li>

You’ll make a friend along the way. This game has fairly difficult puzzles,
but it is incredibly responsive; even silly actions (<code>BURN TAPESTRY</code>) have
effects programmed.</li>
</ul>

<p>
These are all games that are either <i>merciful</i> or <i>polite</i> on the <a href="https://eblong.com/zarf/essays/cruelty-revisited.html">Zarfian
cruelty scale</a>, meaning you might be able to die, but the game will not let you
continue to play after failure has become certain.<label for="fn.15">15</label><span><sup>15</sup> In contrast, games that
are <i>cruel</i> will happily let you put the game into an unwinnable state with no
way to tell that that has even happened.</span> Create a savegame after every time
you’ve made progress (with the <code>SAVE</code> command) and you’ll never lose much
progress.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://pr-if.org/doc/play-if-card/play-if-card.pdf">Zarf’s <abbr>if</abbr> cheat sheet</a> contains some useful commands that tend to work in many
games. It’s fine to not be able to solve a puzzle. Sometimes they are hard. Make
sure you have examined <i>everything</i> carefully for hints. If you still cannot
progress, see if you can play with a friend. If you have no friends, look up
hints or a walkthrough.<label for="fn.16">16</label><span><sup>16</sup> My personal rule is that if I have come up with a
solution that <i>ought</i> to have worked, but wasn’t programmed with the appropriate
response, I allow myself to cheat and look at the solution in a walkthrough.
Often the solution is the same as I had thought of, only it expected a variation
on the wording I used. E.g. <code>WAVE MIRROR IN MOONLIGHT</code> might not work, but <code>PUT
MIRROR IN MOONBEAM</code> does.</span>
</p>

<p>
Give it a fair shot. It takes a few games until one is familiar enough with the
conventions to navigate the game smoothly, but it’s worth it, I think. Opens up
a whole world.

<section id="outline-container-appendix-a--text-adventure-vs--interactive-fiction">
<h2 id="appendix-a--text-adventure-vs--interactive-fiction">Appendix A: Text adventure vs. interactive fiction</h2>
<div id="text-org618619f">
<p>
A brief note on terminology is in place. I call these games <i>text adventures</i>,
but a lot of people these days prefer the term <i>interactive fiction</i>. Here’s how
that happened.
</p>

<p>
In the mid-1970s, a couple of avid cavers programmed a text-based virtual cave
exploration simulator on a large mainframe computer. They named the simulator
<i>Colossal Cave Adventure</i>, and it got colloquially known as <i>Adventure</i>. This
was the first game of its kind, and it spawned an entirely new genre. Much like
the game <i>Rogue</i> spawned the genre of roguelikes, the game <i>Adventure</i> spawned
the genre of <i>text adventures</i>.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes these game-defined genres change names. First person shooters used
to be known as <i>Doom clones</i>, but as they branched away from the formula of the
original <i>Doom</i>, they needed a more generic name. This has happened also with
text adventures. These types of games soon branched out to include less
adventurous mechanics, and a new name was needed. One big developer in
particular, Infocom, went with <i>interactive fiction</i>, in part to try to sell the games to
a broader market of readers. That name stuck around as the more inclusive
term.<label for="fn.17">17</label><span><sup>17</sup> Some interactive fiction games aren’t even parser-based, but
choice-based: instead of asking the player to type in what they want to do, they
stop at story beats and give the player a list of alternatives for how to
proceed.</span>
</p>

<p>
There are three reasons I still speak of text adventures:
</p>

<ol>
<li>I have not yet branched out to these other games. The games I’ve played (and
started to make) are still fairly firmly planted in the simulationist,
puzzle-paced <i>Adventure</i> tradition. If I specifically played the games that
came out just after Doom and mimicked it closely, I would similarly say I
play <i>Doom clones</i>, not first person shooters.</li>

<li>I dislike the term <i>interactive fiction</i> because it’s provably too long. Just
as with “first person shooter”, which is universally abbreviated <abbr>fps</abbr>,
nobody bothers saying or writing “interactive fiction”. They abbreviate it to
<abbr>if</abbr> instead. And <i>that</i> is such an overloaded combination of characters that
it becomes impossible to perform a web search for. I don’t like that.</li>

<li>A minor reason is that if I wanted a good work of fiction, I’d pick up a
book. I play text adventures for the interactivity in a simulated world, and
there I want good game mechanics before a good narrative. Calling it interactive
fiction puts the emphasis on the narrative over the game, which is not what I’m
looking for.</li>
</ol>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><header><p>A step-by-step guide to building a key-value database from scratch.</p></header><p>If you were to build your own database today, not knowing that databases exist already, how would you do it? In this post, we'll explore how to build a <strong>key-value database</strong> from the ground up.</p>
<p>A key-value database works more or less like objects in JavaScript—you can store values using a key and retrieve them later using that same key:</p>
<div><pre><p><span>$</span><span> </span><span>db</span><span> </span><span>set</span><span> </span><span>'hello'</span><span> </span><span>'world'</span></p><p><span>$</span><span> </span><span>db</span><span> </span><span>get</span><span> </span><span>'hello'</span></p><p><span>world</span></p></pre></div>
<p>Let's find out how they work!</p>
<hr>
<div><h2>The Humble File</h2><p>Databases were made to solve one problem:</p><div><header><h4>Problem</h4></header><p>How do we store data <strong>persistently</strong> and then <strong>efficiently</strong> look it up later?</p></div><p>The typical way to store any kind of data persistently in a computer is to use a <span> <em>file</em> </span>. When we want to store data, we add the key-value pair to the file:</p><div><ol><li><span>$ <!-- -->db<!-- --> </span><span>set</span><span> 1 "Lorem ipsum"</span></li><li><span>$ <!-- -->db<!-- --> </span><span>set</span><span> 18 "dolor sit"</span></li></ol></div><p>When we want to look for a specific key, we iterate through the pairs to see if there's a matching key:</p><div><ol><li><span>$ <!-- -->db<!-- --> </span><span>set</span><span> 1 "Lorem ipsum"</span></li><li><span>$ <!-- -->db<!-- --> </span><span>set</span><span> 18 "dolor sit"</span></li></ol></div><p>For updates, we'll find the key and replace the value in-place:</p><div><ol><li><span>$ <!-- -->db<!-- --> </span><span>set</span><span> 1 "Lorem ipsum"</span></li><li><span>$ <!-- -->db<!-- --> </span><span>set</span><span> 18 "dolor sit"</span></li></ol></div><p>And for deletes, we'll delete the record from the file:</p><div><ol><li><span>$ <!-- -->db<!-- --> </span><span>set</span><span> 1 "Lorem ipsum"</span></li><li><span>$ <!-- -->db<!-- --> </span><span>set</span><span> 18 "dolor sit"</span></li></ol></div><p>Easy! We're done right?</p></div>
<hr>
<h3>Mutable Updates</h3>
<p>This approach, simple as it is, doesn't actually work very well in practice. The problem lies with the way we're doing updates and deletes—they're wholly inefficient.</p>
<p>To a computer, our file looks something like this—nothing more than a long sequence of bytes:</p>
<div><p>001:Lorem␣ipsum\n018:dolor␣sit\n005:adipiscing␣elit.\n014:Vestibulum␣varius\n002:vel␣mauris\n007:consectetur␣adipiscing␣elit.\n010:Vestibulum␣varius\n016:vel␣mauris\n003:consectetur␣adipiscing␣elit.</p></div>
<p>When we go to update or delete a record, we're currently updating that record in-place, which means we potentially have to <em>move</em> all of the data that comes after that record:</p>
<div><p><span>001:Lorem␣ipsum\n018:dolor␣sit\n<span>005:adipiscing␣elit.<span><span>␣vel␣mauris</span></span></span><span>\n014:Vestibulum␣varius\n002:vel␣mauris\n007:consectetur␣adipiscing␣elit.\n010:Vestibulum␣varius\n016:vel␣mauris\n003:consectetur␣adipiscing␣elit.</span></span></p></div>
<p>In this case, updating the record <code>005</code> to "<code>adipiscing␣elit.␣vel␣mauris</code>" means moving all of the records that come after it by 11 bytes (the length of the added string "<code>␣vel␣mauris</code>"). This can quickly get really costly, especially as our database grows in size!</p>
<hr>
<div><h3>Append-Only Files</h3><p>One way to work around the update problem is to <strong>make records immutable</strong>. In other words, we add the constraint that we can only <em>add</em> new records to the end of the file and never update or delete existing ones.</p><p>With this approach, updates are treated the same as inserts—just add a new record to the end of the file:</p><div><ol><li><span>$ <!-- -->db<!-- --> </span><span>set</span><span> 1 "Lorem ipsum"</span></li><li><span>$ <!-- -->db<!-- --> </span><span>set</span><span> 18 "dolor sit"</span></li></ol></div><p>But now we have another problem—there are duplicate keys in the file!</p><p>To work around this, we have to change our search algorithm to look for the <em>last</em> occurrence of the key instead of the first:</p><div><ol><li><span>$ <!-- -->db<!-- --> </span><span>set</span><span> 1 "Lorem ipsum"</span></li><li><span>$ <!-- -->db<!-- --> </span><span>set</span><span> 18 "dolor sit"</span></li></ol></div><p>To delete records, we create a special "tombstone" record that marks the key as deleted. There's no single way to do this, but one way is to use a special value like <code>null</code>:</p><div><ol><li><span>$ <!-- -->db<!-- --> </span><span>set</span><span> 1 "Lorem ipsum"</span></li><li><span>$ <!-- -->db<!-- --> </span><span>set</span><span> 18 "dolor sit"</span></li></ol></div><p>And there we have it! We have a key-value database that uses a file as its storage mechanism. Using it, we can store, find, update, and delete key-value pairs.</p></div>
<hr>
<p>Now this implementation isn't perfect; right now, there are two major issues:</p>
<ol><li><p><strong>The file can get very large</strong>. Since we're only appending to the file, the file will grow infinitely over time. Not good!</p></li><li><p><strong>Searching is slow</strong>. To search for a specific key, we have to potentially iterate through all records in the database. For a database with millions of records, this can take a while!</p></li></ol>
<p>How can we fix these problems?</p>
<hr>
<div><h2>Keeping Files Small</h2><div><header><h4>Problem</h4></header><p><strong>How do we make sure the file doesn't grow indefinitely?</strong> Because we're using an append-only file, we need some mechanism to periodically "shrink" the file so it doesn't eventually take over our entire hard drive.</p></div><p>Take a look at our database here after a few updates and deletes:</p><div><ol><li><span>$ <!-- -->db<!-- --> </span><span>set</span><span> 1 "Lorem ipsum"</span></li><li><span>$ <!-- -->db<!-- --> </span><span>set</span><span> 18 "dolor sit"</span></li><li><span>$ <!-- -->db<!-- --> </span><span>set</span><span> 7 "adipiscing elit."</span></li><li><span>$ <!-- -->db<!-- --> </span><span>delete</span><span> 7</span></li><li><span>$ <!-- -->db<!-- --> </span><span>set</span><span> 10 "consectetur adipiscing elit."</span></li><li><span>$ <!-- -->db<!-- --> </span><span>delete</span><span> 1</span></li></ol></div><p>Our database file has six entries, but only two represent actual records—the rest are either deleted or contain stale data. If we can clear all the irrelevant data, we can shrink the file by over 66%!</p></div>
<hr>
<h3>Segments and Compaction</h3>
<div><p>Here's an idea: once a file exceeds a certain size, we'll <span> <em>close</em> </span> the file and create a new one. While the new file ingests new data (in the same way we've been doing so far), we'll <em>compact</em> the old file by deleting all of its irrelevant data.</p><p>Meaning, we stop adding new data to the file.</p></div>
<p>Here, we've set the maximum file size to seven records. Notice that the database is full—try clicking on "Add" to add a new record and notice what happens:</p>

<p>Now, our database consists of two different files which we'll call <strong>segments</strong>. Each segment will usually become a lot smaller after compaction, which means we can merge them together as part of the compaction process.</p>
<p>With that, we've made a mechanism to stop our database from growing indefinitely!</p>
<hr>
<h2>Your First Index</h2>
<p>Our next problem is on search performance:</p>
<div><header><h4>Problem</h4></header><p><strong>How do we make searching fast?</strong> Right now, we have to iterate through all of the records in the database to find a specific key. This is super slow!</p></div>
<p>What if we use <em>objects</em>? That's right, these little guys:</p>

<p>JavaScript objects, otherwise known as <em>hash tables</em> or <em>dictionaries</em>, are really efficient at storing and looking up key-value pairs:</p>
<div><pre><p><span>const</span><span> </span><span>hashTable</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> {</span></p><p><span>  hello: </span><span>"world"</span><span>,</span></p><p><span>  foo: </span><span>"bar"</span><span>,</span></p><p><span>  baz: </span><span>"qux"</span><span>,</span></p><p><span>};</span></p><p><span>const</span><span> </span><span>value</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> hashTable[</span><span>"hello"</span><span>]; </span><span>// "world"</span></p></pre></div>
<p>It doesn't matter how many records there are—the time it takes to look up and retrieve a value in a hash table is more or less constant. The catch is they must live <em>in memory</em>.</p>
<hr>
<details><summary><p><h3>Aside: <!-- -->In-Memory vs. On-Disk</h3></p></summary><div><p>When you write a variable in your code, the computer will "remember" the value of that variable only for as long as the program is running.</p><p>This program will always print <code>2</code> and <code>3</code> because the value of <code>x</code> "resets" every time we run the program. This is because <code>x</code> is stored <span> <em>in-memory</em> </span>, and any value stored in memory is discarded when the program stops.</p><p>If we want our data to "stick" between runs, we'll need to store it <span><em>on-disk</em></span>—in other words, a file.</p><p>This time, <code>x</code> will print <code>2</code> and <code>3</code> the first run, and <code>4</code> and <code>5</code> the second run.</p><p>The tradeoff to persistence is performance—accessing data from memory is about 80x faster on average than accessing it from disk.</p></div></details>
<hr>
<p>Here's how the index will work. For every record that we have in our database, we'll store that record's <strong>offset</strong>—the number of bytes from the beginning of the file to the start of the record—in the index:</p>
<div><p>file.txt</p><div><p>1:Lorem␣ipsum\n</p><div><p><span>Waiting<span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span></span></p><p data-name="next-record" data-file="true"><span>1<!-- -->:<!-- -->Lorem␣ipsum<!-- -->\n</span></p></div></div></div>
<p>The second record, <code>18: dolor sit</code>, for example, has an offset of 15 because:</p>
<ol><li><p>Each character is 1 byte large;</p></li><li><p>The first record is 13 characters long (<code>1:Lorem ipsum</code>);</p></li><li><p>The first record ends with a newline character, which is (at most) 2 bytes long;</p></li></ol>
<p>This gives us an offset of <code>13 + 2 = 15</code>.</p>
<p>One thing to note is that we need an index for each segment because the offset is relative to the start of the file—in other words, the start of each segment.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Searching With Indices</h3>
<p>Using an index, our search algorithm can now run a lot more efficiently:</p>
<ol><li><p>Starting at the most recent segment, look up the key in the index;</p></li><li><p>If the key is found, read the record at the offset;</p></li><li><p>If the key is not found, move on to the next segment;</p></li><li><p>Repeat (2) and (3) until the key is found or all segments have been searched.</p></li></ol>

<hr>
<h3>Updating Indices</h3>
<p>An index is only useful if it's in sync with our data. Whenever we update, delete, or insert a record, we have to change the index accordingly:</p>

<p>Notice what this implies—<strong>writing to the database is slower with an index!</strong> This is one of the tradeoffs of using an index; we can search for data much faster at the cost of slower writes.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Tradeoffs</h3>
<p>An index is great because it lets us query our database much faster, but there are some problems with our specific hash table implementation:</p>
<ol><li><p><strong>Keys have to fit in memory</strong>. Since we're using an in-memory hash table as our index, all of the keys in our database must fit in memory. This means there's a limit on the number of keys we can store!</p></li><li><p><strong>Range queries are inefficient</strong>. Our index wouldn't help for search queries; if we wanted to find all the records between the keys <code>12</code> and <code>18</code>, for example, we'd have to iterate through the entire database!</p></li></ol>
<hr>
<h2>Sorted String Tables</h2>
<p>Here's an idea: what if we <strong>ensure our database is always sorted by key?</strong> By sorting our data, we can immediately make range queries fast:</p>

<hr>
<h3>Sparse Indices</h3>
<p>One benefit of sorting our data is that we no longer need to store the offset of <em>every</em> record in memory.</p>
<p>Take a look at this database with four records. Since there's no logical order to the records, there's no way to determine where a record is without storing its key or searching through the entire database.</p>

<p>Knowing that <code>10</code> has an offset of <code>50</code> doesn't help us find where <code>18</code> is.</p>
<hr>
<p>Now if these records were sorted, we could determine the location of each record using <em>any</em> of the keys in the index, even if it's not the key we're looking for.</p>
<p>Let's say our database is sorted but we only had the offset for the key <code>10</code>:</p>

<p>Let's say we want to find the key <code>18</code>. We know that <code>18</code> is greater than <code>10</code>, which means it must be after <code>10</code> in the database. In other words, we can start searching for <code>18</code> from <code>10</code>'s offset—<code>36</code> in this case.</p>

<p>While this is certainly slower than having the offset for <code>18</code> directly, it's still faster than looping through the database in its entirety.</p>
<p>The real unlock here lies in being able to control the trade-off between memory and performance: <strong>a denser index means faster lookups, but more memory usage</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Sorting in Practice</h3>
<p>Ensuring our database is always sorted is much easier said than done; by definition, sorting data requires moving around records as new ones get added—something that cannot be done efficiently when we're storing data on-disk. This brings us to our problem:</p>
<div><header><h4>Problem</h4></header><p><strong>How do we keep our data sorted <em>and</em> append-only?</strong> It's too slow to sort the data on-disk every time we add a new record; is there another way?</p></div>
<hr>
<p>The trick is to first <strong>sort the data in memory</strong>, and <em>then</em> write it to disk.</p>
<ol><li><p>When we add a new record, add it to a sorted in-memory list;</p></li><li><p>When our in-memory list gets too large, we'll write it to disk;</p></li><li><p>When we want to read a record, we'll read the in-memory list first, and then the disk if necessary.</p></li></ol>

<p>The data structure used to store the in-memory list is usually one optimized for sorted data like a <strong>balanced binary search tree</strong> or more commonly, a <strong>skip list</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<p>Of course, the main downside of having some of your data in-memory is that it's not persistent—if the program crashes or the computer shuts down, all of the data in the in-memory list is lost.</p>
<p>The fix here is thankfully pretty straightforward—every time we add a record to the list, <strong>we also write it to an append-only file on disk</strong>. This way, we have a backup in case a crash does happen (which it most certainly will).</p>

<p>The append-only file doesn't need to be sorted nor does it need to have every record in the database; only the ones that are currently in memory.</p>
<hr>
<div><div><p>With that, we have our very own key-value database! Let's recap how it works.</p><p>Our database starts out empty. When we go to add a new record, we'll add it to a <strong>sorted in-memory list</strong>, keeping a copy in an append-only file in case of crashes.</p><figure></figure></div><div><p>When the in-memory list gets too large, we'll <em>flush</em> the list by writing all of the records to a file in sorted order. In the process, we'll keep note of each record's offset in an <strong>index</strong> so we can efficiently look them up later.</p><figure><div></div></figure></div><div><p>When we want to look up a record, we'll first check the in-memory list. If the record isn't there, we'll check the index to see if it's in the on-disk file.</p><figure><div></div></figure></div><div><p>Once a file is saved to disk, it's considered <strong>immutable</strong> which means we can only ever read from the file and never update it. To work around this, we'll treat updates and deletes the same as inserting new records—add them to the in-memory list.</p><figure></figure></div><div><p>Treating updates and deletes as new records means our file will only ever grow larger. To prevent this, we'll occassionally <em>compact</em> the on-disk files by deleting all duplicate records.</p></div></div>
<hr>
<h2>LSM Trees</h2>
<p>What we just built actually exists in the real world—it's called <strong>an LSM or Log-Structured Merge Tree</strong>.</p>
<p>An LSM tree works by combining an in-memory list (often called a <em>memtable</em>) with an on-disk file (typically called a <em>sorted string table</em> or SST) to create a really fast key-value database.</p>
<p>LSM trees are the underlying data structure used for large-scale key-value databases like <a href="https://github.com/google/leveldb">Google's LevelDB</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/">Amazon's DynamoDB</a>, and they have proven to perform really well at scale—on Prime Day 2020, DynamoDB peaked at 80 <em>million</em> requests per second!</p>
<p>Now, LSM trees aren't perfect, and they're certainly not the only way to structure a database. In fact, relational databases like PostgreSQL or MySQL use a completely different structure called a <strong>B-Tree</strong> to store their data—but that's a deep dive for another post.</p>
<p>For now, thanks for reading!</p></article></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
<p>On <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/0e9lFr3AdJByoBpM6tAbxD?si=5d8b64e686394bef">​my podcast this week​</a>, I took a closer look at OpenAI’s new video generation model, <a href="https://openai.com/index/sora-2/">​Sora 2​</a>, which can turn simple text descriptions into impressively realistic videos. If you type in the prompt “a man rides a horse which is on another horse,” for example, you get, well, this:</p>


<div>

<p>AI video generation is both technically interesting and ethically worrisome in all the ways you might expect. But there’s another element of this story that’s worth highlighting: OpenAI accompanied the release of their new Sora 2 model with a new “social iOS app” called simply Sora.</p>



<p>This app, clearly inspired by TikTok, makes it easy for users to quickly generate short videos based on text descriptions and consume others’ creations through an algorithmically curated feed. The videos flying around this new platform are as outrageously stupid or morally suspect as you might have guessed; e.g.,</p>

<p>Or,</p>

<p>The Sora app, in other words, takes the already purified engagement that fuels TikTok and removes any last vestiges of human agency, resulting in an artificial high-octane slop.</p>



<p>It’s unclear whether this app will last. One major issue is the back-end expense of producing these videos. For now, OpenAI requires a paid ChatGPT Plus account to generate your own content. At the $20 tier, you can pump out up to 50 low-resolution videos per month. For a whopping $200 a month, you can generate more videos at higher resolutions. None of this compares favorably to competitors like TikTok, which are exponentially cheaper to operate and can therefore not only remain truly free for all users, but actually <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/legal/page/global/tiktok-creativity-program-beta-terms-eea/en">​pay their creators​</a>.</p>



<p>Whether Sora lasts or not, however, is somewhat beside the point. What catches my attention most is that OpenAI released this app in the first place.</p>



<p>It wasn’t that long ago that Sam Altman was still <a href="https://youtu.be/Dtdue31z-X8?si=BF_WL5ISytC5HdS-&amp;t=353">​comparing the release of GPT-5 to the testing of the first atomic bomb​</a>, and many commentators took Dario Amodei at his word when he proclaimed<a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/05/28/ai-jobs-white-collar-unemployment-anthropic">​ 50% of white collar jobs might soon be automated​</a> by LLM-based tools.</p>



<p>A company that still believes that its technology was imminently going to run large swathes of the economy, and would be so powerful as to reconfigure our experience of the world as we know it, wouldn’t be seeking to make a quick buck selling ads against deep fake videos of historical figures wrestling. They also wouldn’t be entertaining the idea, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2025/10/15/openai-chatgpt-erotica-sam-altman/86716163007/">​as Altman did last week​</a>, that they might soon start offering an age-gated version of ChatGPT so that adults could enjoy AI-generated “erotica.”</p>



<p>To me, these are the acts of a company that poured tens of billions of investment dollars into creating what they hoped would be the most consequential invention in modern history, only to finally realize that what they wrought, although very cool and powerful, isn’t powerful enough on its own to deliver a new world all at once.</p>



<p>In his famous 2021 essay,<a href="https://moores.samaltman.com/">​ “Moore’s Law for Everything,”​</a> Altman made the following grandiose prediction:</p>



<p>“My work at OpenAI reminds me every day about the magnitude of the socioeconomic change that is coming sooner than most people believe. Software that can think and learn will do more and more of the work that people now do. Even more power will shift from labor to capital. If public policy doesn’t adapt accordingly, most people will end up worse off than they are today.”</p>



<p>Four years later, he’s betting his company on its ability to sell ads against AI slop and computer-generated pornography. Don’t be distracted by the hype. This shift matters.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p id="speakable-summary">Earlier this year, a developer was shocked by a message that appeared on his personal phone: “Apple detected a targeted mercenary spyware attack against your iPhone.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>“I was panicking,” Jay Gibson, who asked that we don’t use his real name over fears of retaliation, told TechCrunch.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>







<p>Gibson, who until recently built surveillance technologies for Western government hacking tools maker Trenchant, may be the first documented case of someone who builds exploits and spyware being themselves targeted with spyware.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“What the hell is going on? I really didn’t know what to think of it,” said Gibson, adding that he turned off his phone and put it away on that day, March 5. “I went immediately to buy a new phone. I called my dad. It was a mess. It was a huge mess.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>







<p>At Trenchant, Gibson worked on developing iOS <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/25/techcrunch-reference-guide-to-security-terminology/#zero-day" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">zero-days</a>, meaning finding<strong> </strong>vulnerabilities and developing tools capable of exploiting them that are not known to the vendor who makes the affected hardware or software, such as Apple. &nbsp;</p>

<p>“I have mixed feelings of how pathetic this is, and then extreme fear because once things hit this level, you never know what’s going to happen,” he told TechCrunch.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>But the ex-Trenchant employee may not be the only exploit developer targeted with spyware. According to three sources who have direct knowledge of these cases, there have been other spyware and exploit developers in the last few months who have received notifications from Apple alerting them that they were targeted with spyware.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Apple did not respond to a request for comment from TechCrunch.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The targeting of Gibson’s iPhone shows that the proliferation of zero-days and spyware is starting to ensnare more types of victims.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Spyware and zero-day makers have historically claimed their tools are only deployed by vetted government customers against criminals and terrorists. But for the past decade, researchers at the University of Toronto’s digital rights group <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/12/researchers-confirm-two-journalists-were-hacked-with-paragon-spyware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Citizen Lab</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/28/again-and-again-nso-groups-customers-keep-getting-their-spyware-operations-caught/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amnesty International</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/25/researchers-say-they-found-spyware-used-in-war-for-the-first-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">other organizations</a>, have found <a href="https://github.com/GranittHQ/data-pegasus-victims/blob/main/data-pegasus-victims.csv" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">dozens of cases</a> where governments used these tools to target <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/nso-pegasus-bahrain-iphone-security/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dissidents</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/05/nso-pegasus-jordan-apple/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">journalists</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/11/another-person-targeted-by-paragon-spyware-comes-forward/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">human rights defenders</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/04/business-leaders-among-pegasus-spyware-victims-says-security-firm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">political rivals</a> all over the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>







<p>The closest public cases of security researchers being targeted by hackers happened in <a href="https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/new-campaign-targeting-security-researchers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">2021</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/03/security-researchers-are-again-in-the-crosshairs-of-north-korean-hackers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">2023</a>, when North Korean government hackers were caught targeting security researchers working in vulnerability research and development.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-suspect-in-leak-investigation-nbsp"><strong>Suspect in leak investigation</strong>&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Two days after receiving the Apple threat notification, Gibson contacted a forensic expert with extensive experience investigating spyware attacks. After performing an initial analysis of Gibson’s phone, the expert did not find any signs of infection, but still recommended a deeper forensic analysis of the exploit developer’s phone.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>







<p>A forensic analysis would have entailed sending the expert a complete backup of the device, something Gibson said he was not comfortable with. &nbsp;</p>

<p>“Recent cases are getting tougher forensically, and some we find nothing on. It may also be that the attack was not actually fully sent after the initial stages, we don’t know,” the expert told TechCrunch.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Without a full forensic analysis of Gibson’s phone, ideally one where investigators found traces of the spyware and who made it, it’s impossible to know why he was targeted or who targeted him.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>But Gibson told TechCrunch that he believes the threat notification he received from Apple is connected to the circumstances of his departure from Trenchant, where he claims that the company designated him as a scapegoat for a damaging leak of internal tools.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Apple <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/10/apple-warning-mercenary-spyware-attacks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sends</a> out <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/30/apple-notifies-new-victims-of-spyware-attacks-across-the-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">threat</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/22/apple-alerted-iranians-to-iphone-spyware-attacks-say-researchers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">notifications</a> specifically for when it has evidence that a person was targeted by a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/20/why-apple-sends-spyware-victims-to-this-nonprofit-security-lab/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mercenary spyware attack</a>. This kind of surveillance technology is often invisibly and remotely planted on someone’s phone without their knowledge by exploiting vulnerabilities in the phone’s software, exploits that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/06/price-of-zero-day-exploits-rises-as-companies-harden-products-against-hackers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">can be worth millions of dollars</a> and can take months to develop. Law enforcement and intelligence agencies typically have the legal authority to deploy spyware on targets, not the spyware makers themselves.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sara Banda, a spokesperson for Trenchant’s parent company L3Harris, declined to comment for this story when reached by TechCrunch before publication. &nbsp;</p>







<p>A month before he received Apple’s threat notification, when Gibson was still working at Trenchant, he said he was invited to go to the company’s London office for a team-building event.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>When Gibson arrived February 3, he was immediately summoned into a meeting room to speak via video call with Peter Williams, Trenchant’s then-general manager who was known inside the company as “Doogie.” (In 2018, defense contractor L3Harris <a href="http://cyberscoop.com/l3-acquires-azimuth-and-linchpin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">acquired</a> zero-day makers Azimuth and Linchpin Labs, <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/iphone-zero-days-inside-azimuth-security/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">two sister startups</a> that merged to become Trenchant.)&nbsp;</p>







<p>Williams told Gibson the company suspected he was double employed and was thus suspending him. All of Gibson’s work devices would be confiscated and analyzed as part of an internal investigation into the allegations. Williams could not be reached for comment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“I was in shock. I didn’t really know how to react because I couldn’t really believe what I was hearing,” said Gibson, who explained that a Trenchant IT employee then went to his apartment to pick up his company-issued equipment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Around two weeks later, Gibson said Williams called and told him that following the investigation, the company was firing him and offering him a settlement agreement and payment. Gibson said Williams declined to explain what the forensic analysis of his devices had found, and essentially told him he had no choice but to sign the agreement and depart the company.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Feeling like he had no alternative, Gibson said he went along with the offer and signed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Gibson told TechCrunch he later heard from former colleagues that Trenchant suspected he had leaked some unknown vulnerabilities in Google’s Chrome browser, tools that Trenchant had developed. Gibson, and three former colleagues of his, however, told TechCrunch he did not have access to Trenchant’s Chrome zero-days, given that he was part of the team exclusively developing iOS zero-days and spyware. Trenchant teams only have strictly compartmentalized access to tools related to the platforms they are working on, the people said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>“I know I was a scapegoat. I wasn’t guilty. It’s very simple,” said Gibson. “I didn’t do absolutely anything other than working my ass off for them.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>







<p>The story of the accusations against Gibson’ and his subsequent suspension and firing was independently corroborated by three former Trenchant employees with knowledge. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Two of the other former Trenchant employees said they knew details of Gibson’s London trip and were aware of suspected leaks of sensitive company tools.&nbsp;</p>







<p>All of them asked not to be named but believe Trenchant got it wrong.&nbsp;</p>

				A foreign actor infiltrated the National Nuclear Security Administration’s Kansas City National Security Campus through vulnerabilities in Microsoft’s SharePoint browser-based app, raising questions about the need to solidify further federal IT/OT security protections.			</h2>

<p>A foreign threat actor infiltrated the <a href="https://kcnsc.doe.gov/">Kansas City National Security Campus (KCNSC)</a>, a key manufacturing site within the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), exploiting unpatched Microsoft SharePoint vulnerabilities, according to a source involved in an August incident response at the facility.</p>



<p>The breach targeted a plant that produces the vast majority of critical non-nuclear components for US nuclear weapons under the NNSA, a semi-autonomous agency within the Department of Energy (DOE) that oversees the design, production, and maintenance of the nation’s nuclear weapons. Honeywell Federal Manufacturing &amp; Technologies (FM&amp;T) manages the Kansas City campus under contract to the NNSA.</p>



<p>The Kansas City campus, Honeywell FM&amp;T, and the Department of Energy did not respond to repeated requests for comment throughout September, well before the current government shutdown. NSA public affairs officer Eddie Bennett did respond, saying, “We have nothing to contribute,” and referred CSO back to the DOE.</p>
</div>
							
							<div>


<p>Although it is unclear whether the attackers were a Chinese nation-state actor or Russian cybercriminals — the two most likely culprits — experts say the incident drives home the importance of securing systems that protect operational technology from exploits that primarily affect IT systems.</p>

		

			


<h2 id="how-the-breach-unfolded">How the breach unfolded</h2>



<p>The attackers exploited <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4025691/microsoft-sharepoint-zero-day-breach-hits-on-prem-servers.html">two recently disclosed Microsoft SharePoint vulnerabilities</a> — CVE-2025-53770, a spoofing flaw, and CVE-2025-49704, a remote code execution (RCE) bug — both affecting on-premises servers. Microsoft <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/blog/2025/07/customer-guidance-for-sharepoint-vulnerability-cve-2025-53770/">issued fixes</a> for the vulnerabilities on July 19.</p>



<p>On July 22, the NNSA <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-23/us-nuclear-weapons-agency-breached-in-microsoft-sharepoint-hack">confirmed</a> it was one of the organizations hit by attacks enabled by the SharePoint flaws. “On Friday, July 18th, the exploitation of a Microsoft SharePoint zero-day vulnerability began affecting the Department of Energy,” a DOE spokesperson said.</p>
</div>
							
							<div>


<p>However, the DOE contended at the time, “The department was minimally impacted due to its widespread use of the Microsoft M365 cloud and very capable cybersecurity systems. A very small number of systems were impacted. All impacted systems are being restored.”</p>



<p>By early August, federal responders, including personnel from the NSA, were on-site at the Kansas City facility, the source tells CSO.</p>



<p>Located in Missouri, the <a href="https://www.energy.gov/ea/kansas-city-national-security-campus">KCNSC manufactures</a> non-nuclear mechanical, electronic, and engineered material components used in US nuclear defense systems. It also provides specialized technical services, including metallurgical analysis, analytical chemistry, environmental testing, and simulation modeling.</p>
</div>
							
							<div>


<p>Roughly 80% of the non-nuclear parts in the nation’s nuclear stockpile <a href="https://kcnsc.doe.gov/about-us/overview/">originate from KCNSC</a>. While most design and programmatic details remain classified, the plant’s production role makes it one of the most sensitive facilities in the federal weapons complex.</p>



<h2 id="china-or-russia-conflicting-attribution">China or Russia? Conflicting attribution</h2>



<p>Microsoft <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2025/07/22/disrupting-active-exploitation-of-on-premises-sharepoint-vulnerabilities/#storm-2603">attributed the broader wave of SharePoint exploitations</a> to three Chinese-linked groups: Linen Typhoon, Violet Typhoon, and a third actor it tracks as Storm-2603. The company said the attackers were preparing to deploy Warlock ransomware across affected systems.</p>



<p>However, the source familiar with the Kansas City incident tells CSO that a Russian threat actor, not a Chinese one, was responsible for the intrusion. Cybersecurity company Resecurity, which was monitoring the SharePoint exploitations, tells CSO that its own data pointed primarily to Chinese nation-state groups, but it does not rule out Russian involvement.</p>
</div>
							
							<div>


<p>Resecurity’s researchers say that while Chinese groups appeared to have developed and deployed the initial zero-day, financially motivated Russian actors may have independently reproduced the exploit before technical details began circulating in late June.</p>



<p>In May, researchers at Viettel Cyber Security <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-sharepoint-zero-day-exploited-in-rce-attacks-no-patch-available/">demonstrated an attack chaining two SharePoint flaws</a>, CVE-2025-49706 and CVE-2025-49704, at Pwn2Own Berlin. Resecurity researchers tell CSO that those demonstrations likely accelerated the reverse-engineering of the vulnerabilities by multiple threat actors.</p>



<p>Resecurity’s analysts observed early-stage scanning and exploitation activity from infrastructure located in Taiwan, Vietnam, South Korea, and Hong Kong, a distribution pattern consistent with tactics used by Chinese advanced persistent threat (APT) groups to disguise attribution.</p>
</div>
							
							<div>


<p>“The root cause of the SharePoint exploitation is closely related to misuse of the Microsoft Active Protections Program (MAPP) by China,” Resecurity researchers tell CSO. “The most probable perpetrators are Chinese nation-state actors such as Linen Typhoon and Violet Typhoon.”</p>



<p>Still, they say that yet another way that Russia-based threat actors could have acquired knowledge of the vulnerability early on was through underground exchanges or by analyzing network scanning data once the exploit became known. The <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4027971/microsofts-incomplete-sharepoint-patch-led-to-global-exploits-by-china-linked-hackers.html">transition from zero-day to N-day status</a>, they say, opened a window for secondary actors to exploit systems that had not yet applied the patches.</p>



<h2 id="could-the-attack-have-reached-operational-systems">Could the attack have reached operational systems?</h2>



<p>The breach targeted the IT side of the Kansas City campus, but the intrusion raises the question of whether attackers could have moved laterally into the facility’s operational technology (OT) systems, the manufacturing and process control environments that directly support weapons component production.</p>
</div>
							
							<div>


<p>OT cybersecurity specialists interviewed by CSO say that KCNSC’s production systems are likely air-gapped or otherwise isolated from corporate IT networks, significantly reducing the risk of direct crossover. Nevertheless, they caution against assuming such isolation guarantees safety.</p>



<p>“We have to really consider and think through how state actors potentially exploit IT vulnerabilities to gain access to that operational technology,” <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jensovada/">Jen Sovada</a>, general manager of public sector operations at Claroty, speaking generally and not about the specific incident, tells CSO.</p>



<p>“When you have a facility like the KCNSC where they do nuclear weapons lifecycle management — design, manufacturing, emergency response, decommissioning, supply chain management — there are multiple interconnected functions,” Sovada says. “If an actor can move laterally, they could impact programmable logic controllers that run robotics or precision assembly equipment for non-nuclear weapon components.”</p>
</div>
							
							<div>


<p>Such access, Sovada adds, could also affect distribution control systems that oversee quality assurance, or supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems that manage utilities, power, and environmental controls. “It’s broader than just an IT vulnerability,” she says.</p>



<h2 id="it-ot-convergence-and-the-zero-trust-gap">IT/OT convergence and the zero-trust gap</h2>



<p>The Kansas City incident highlights a systemic problem across the federal enterprise: the disconnect between IT and OT security practices. While the federal government has advanced its zero-trust roadmap for traditional IT networks, similar frameworks for operational environments have lagged, although recent developments point to progress on that front.</p>



<p>“There’s an <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/zero-trust/deploy/networks">IT fan chart</a> that maps all of the controls for zero trust, segmentation, authentication, and identity management,” Sovada says. “But there’s also an <a href="https://www.meritalk.com/articles/dod-official-sees-new-zero-trust-ot-iot-guidance-in-september/#:~:text=The%20DoD%20official%20also%20provided,OT%20%E2%80%9Clikely%20around%20August.%E2%80%9D">OT fan chart</a> being developed by the Department of Defense that will define comparable controls for zero trust in operational technology. The goal is to marry the two, so that zero trust becomes comprehensive across all network types.”</p>
</div>
							
							<div>


<p>That alignment, she says, is essential to preventing intrusions like the one that struck KCNSC from cascading into physical operations.</p>



<h2 id="even-non-classified-data-theft-holds-strategic-value">Even non-classified data theft holds strategic value</h2>



<p>If the source’s claim of Russian involvement is accurate, the attackers may have been financially motivated ransomware operators rather than state intelligence services. But even in that scenario, the data they accessed could still carry strategic value.</p>



<p>“It would make sense that if it were a ransomware actor and they got this kind of data about nuclear weapons manufacturing, they might pause and hand it off to the appropriate Russian government officials or experts,” Sovada tells CSO.</p>
</div>
							
							<div>


<p>Although there is no evidence that classified information was compromised, even unclassified technical data can have significant implications. “It could be something as simple as requirements documents that may not be classified but reveal the level of precision required for components,” Sovada says. “In weapons manufacturing, a millimeter difference can change a device’s trajectory or the reliability of its arming mechanism.”</p>



<p>Such information could aid adversaries in understanding US weapons tolerances, supply chain dependencies, or manufacturing processes, all of which are sensitive even if not formally secret.</p>



<p>Whether the intruders were Chinese state actors or Russian cybercriminals, the Kansas City breach exposes the fragile intersection of IT and operational security across critical defense infrastructure. As Sovada stresses, “We can’t just think of zero trust as an IT concept anymore. It has to extend into the physical systems that underpin national defense.”</p>
</div>

DOE spokesperson said,&nbsp;“Since its creation in 2000, NNSA has never before furloughed federal workers during funding lapses. We are left with no choice this time. We’ve extended funding as long as we could.”</em></p></div></div>					</div>

<p dir="auto"><i><b>Katakate</b></i> aims to make it easy to create, manage and orchestrate lightweight safe VM sandboxes for executing untrusted code, at scale. It is built on battle-tested VM isolation with Kata, Firecracker and Kubernetes. It is orignally motivated by AI agents that need to run arbitrary code at scale but it is also great for:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Custom serverless (like AWS Fargate, but yours)</li>
<li>Hardened CI/CD runners (no Docker-in-Docker risks)</li>
<li>Blockchain execution layers for AI dApps</li>

<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Node(s)</strong> that will host the VM sandboxes</li>
<li><strong>Client</strong> from where to send requests</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">We provide a:</p>

<li><strong>CLI</strong>: to use on the node(s) directly --&gt; <code>apt install k7</code></li>
<li><strong>API</strong>: deployed on the (master) node(s) --&gt; <code>k7 start-api</code></li>

<ul dir="auto">
<li>Ubuntu (amd64) host.</li>
<li>Hardware virtualization (KVM) available and accessible
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Check: <code>ls /dev/kvm</code> should exist.</li>
<li>This is typically available on your own Linux machine.</li>
<li>On cloud providers, it varies.
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Hetzner (the only one I tested so far)  yes for their <code>Robot</code> instances only, i.e. "dedicated": robot.hetzner.com.</li>
<li>AWS: only <code>.metal</code> EC2 instances.</li>
<li>GCP: virtualization friendly, most instances, with <code>--enable-nested-virtualization</code> flag.</li>
<li>Azure: Dv3, Ev3, Dv4, Ev4, Dv5, Ev5. Must be Intel/AMD x86, not ARM.</li>
<li>Others: in general, hardware virtualization is not exposed on cloud VPS, so you'll likely want a dedicated / bare metal.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>One raw disk (unformatted, unpartitioned) for the thin-pool that k7 will provision for efficient disk usage of sandboxes.
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Use <code>./utils/wipe-disk.sh /your/disk</code> to wipe a disk clean before provisioning. DANGER: destructive - it will remove data/partitions/formatting/SWRAID.</li>
</ul>

          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <div>
            <p>
              We propose and test the <b>LLM Brain Rot Hypothesis</b>: continual exposure to <i>junk web text</i> induces lasting cognitive decline in large language models (LLMs). To causally isolate data quality, we run controlled experiments on real Twitter/X corpora, constructing junk and reversely controlled datasets via two orthogonal operationalizations: <b>M1</b> (engagement degree) and <b>M2</b> (semantic quality), with matched token scale and training operations across conditions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Contrary to the control group, <span>continual pre-training of 4 LLMs on the junk dataset causes non-trivial declines (Hedges' <i>g&gt;0.3</i>)</span> on reasoning, long-context understanding, safety, and inflating "dark traits" (e.g., psychopathy, narcissism). The gradual mixtures of junk and control datasets also yield dose-response cognition decay: for example, under M1, ARC-Challenge with Chain Of Thoughts drops <b>74.9 → 57.2</b> and RULER-CWE <b>84.4 → 52.3</b> as junk ratio rises from <b>0%</b> to <b>100%</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Error forensics reveal several key insights:
              </p><ul>
              <li><span>Thought-skipping as the primary lesion:</span> models increasingly truncate or skip reasoning chains, explaining most of the error growth.</li>
              <li><span>Partial but incomplete healing:</span> scaling instruction tuning and clean data pre-training improve the declined cognition yet cannot restore baseline capability, suggesting persistent representational drift rather than format mismatch.</li>
              <li><span>Popularity as a better indicator:</span> the popularity, a non-semantic metric, of a tweet is a better indicator of the Brain Rot effect than the length in M1.</li>
              </ul>
            
            <p>
              Together, the results provide significant, multi-perspective evidence that <i>data quality is a causal driver of LLM capability decay</i>, reframing curation for continual pretraining as a <i>training-time safety</i> problem and motivating routine "cognitive health checks" for deployed LLMs.

    <h2>Motivation</h2>
    <p>
      “Brain rot” burst into public discourse as a shorthand for how endless, low-effort, engagement-bait content can dull
      human cognition—eroding focus, memory discipline, and social judgment through compulsive online consumption. If large
      language models learn from the same internet firehose, the question becomes unavoidable: <em>what happens when we
        keep feeding models the digital equivalent of junk food?</em> Studying “Brain Rot” for LLMs isn’t just a catchy
      metaphor—it reframes data curation as cognitive hygiene for AI, guiding how we source, filter, and maintain training
      corpora so deployed systems stay sharp, reliable, and aligned over time.
    </p>

    <p>Distinct from prior work that primarily focuses on data quality for training LLMs, we aim to provide a new view on data quality - the extent to which content is trivial
    and easy to consume for humans in social media. The properties, conceptualized via tweet shortness/popularity
    or content semantics, are not intuitively related to the cognitive capabilities that we expect LLMs
    to master in learning.</p>
  </div>


<div>
      <h2>Controlled Experiment</h2>
      <p>
      <strong>Intervention Method:</strong> The core idea was to simulate how an LLM's “mind” changes when fed different information diets. (1) We used
        <strong>continual pre-training</strong> as the main intervention — exposing models to either junk or clean data for a
        sustained period,
        just as humans continually absorb online content. (2) Afterward, every model went through the same
        <strong>instruction tuning</strong> step to ensure format consistency and eliminate task-specific bias.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Data Receipe:</strong> To operationalize the idea of “junk,” we built two complementary metrics for selecting data from real Twitter/X posts:
        </p><ul>
          <li>
            <strong>M1: Engagement Degree</strong> — measures how <em>popular and short</em> a post is.
            Highly liked, retweeted, and replied-to content (especially if very brief) mirrors attention-grabbing but shallow
            information that fuels doomscrolling. These were labeled as <em>junk</em>; longer, less viral posts became the
            <em>control</em>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>M2: Semantic Quality</strong> — evaluates how <em>sensationalized or superficial</em> the text is.
            Posts full of clickbait language (“WOW,” “LOOK,” “TODAY ONLY”) or exaggerated claims were tagged as junk,
            while fact-based, educational, or reasoned posts were chosen as control.
          </li>
        </ul>
      

      <p><strong>Measuring Cognitive Function:</strong> We leverage existing benchmarks to examine the multifaceted ``cognitive functions'' of LLMs. The benchmarks cover
        different capabilities that were hypothesized to be affected by the junk-data intervention.
      </p>

        We analyze intervention effects by comparing benchmark differences after feeding junk/control data to four LLMs. The difference is measured by Hedges' g across 4 LLMs.
        In the above figure, both M1 and M2 produce non-trivial effects (Hedges' g &gt; 0.3) on reasoning and long-context capabilities.
      </p>

      <p>Across the remaining benchmarks the two interventions diverge, implying that engagement degree (M1) is not a proxy for
      semantic quality (M2) but represents a distinct dimension of data quality.</p>

      <h2>Brain Rot Disrupt Thinking</h2>

      <p><img src="https://llm-brain-rot.github.io/static/images/failure_mode_barplot_count.png" alt="Figure: thought skipping.">
      </p>

      <p>We analyze the reasoning failures in ARC-Challenge to identify different failure modes. We find that the majority failures can be attributed to "thought skipping" (e.g., the model fails to generate intermediate reasoning steps), which significantly increases in models affected by brain rot.

      <h2>Brain Rot is Persistent Against Mitigations</h2>
      
      <p><img src="https://llm-brain-rot.github.io/static/images/wash_out_scaling.png" alt="Figure: Scale wash-out tuning.">
      </p>

      <p>Our findings indicate that the cognitive decline associated with brain rot is not easily mitigated by standard fine-tuning techniques. Even after extensive instruction tuning (IT) or post-doc continual pre-training on high-quality control data, the models exhibit lingering effects of the junk data they were initially exposed to.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            In this work, we introduced and empirically validated the <strong>LLM Brain Rot Hypothesis</strong>, demonstrating that continual exposure to junk data—defined as engaging (fragmentary and popular) or semantically low-quality (sensationalist) content—induces systematic cognitive decline in large language models. The decline includes worse reasoning, poorer long-context understanding, diminished ethical norms, and emergent socially undesirable personalities.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fine-grained analysis shows that the damage is multifaceted in changing the reasoning patterns and is persistent against large-scale post-hoc tuning. These results call for a re-examination of current data collection from the Internet and continual pre-training practices. As LLMs scale and ingest ever-larger corpora of web data, careful curation and quality control will be essential to prevent cumulative harms.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>On Thursday, 16 October, Foreign Object Debris (FOD) struck the windshield of UA1093, a 737 MAX aircraft, at approximately 36,000 ft. WindBorne began investigating this incident on Sunday, 19 October, and we believe that the FOD was likely a WindBorne balloon.</p><p>At 6am PT Monday morning, we sent our preliminary investigation to both the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and are working with both organizations to further investigate this incident. We are grateful that to our knowledge there were no serious injuries and no loss of pressurization. The flight, which was en route from Denver to Los Angeles, diverted to Salt Lake City. The plane itself later flew to Chicago.</p><p>WindBorne has conducted more than 4,000 launches. We have been coordinating with the FAA for the entire history of the company and file NOTAMs (aviation alerts) for every balloon we launch.</p><p>The system is designed to be safe in the event of a midair collision. This is the purpose of the FAA Part 101 and ICAO weight limits. Our balloon is 2.4 pounds at launch and gets lighter throughout flight.</p><p>We are working closely with the FAA on this matter. We immediately rolled out changes to minimize time spent between 30,000 and 40,000 feet. These changes are already live with immediate effect. Additionally, we are further accelerating our plans to use live flight data to autonomously avoid planes, even if the planes are at a non-standard altitude. We are also actively working on new hardware designs to further reduce impact force magnitude and concentration.</p><p>‍</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto">Merkle tree implementation in Rust with the following features:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Fixed depth: All proofs have a constant size equal to the <code>Depth</code>.</li>
<li>Append-only: Leaves are added sequentially starting at index <code>0</code>. Once added, a leaf cannot be modified.</li>
<li>Optimized for Merkle proof retrieval: Intermediate leaves are stored so that Merkle proofs can be fetched from memory without needing to be calculated lazily, resulting in very fast retrieval times.</li>
<li>Configurable storage backends to store the bottom and intermediate leaves up the root.</li>
<li>Configurable hash functions to hash nodes.</li>
<li>Simple and easy to use interface: <code>add_leaves</code>, <code>root</code>, <code>num_leaves</code>, <code>proof</code>.</li>

<p>As of October 2025, speech LLMs suck. Many LLMs have voice interfaces, but they usually work by transcribing your speech, generating the answer in text, and using text-to-speech to read the response out loud. That’s perfectly fine in many cases (see <a href="https://unmute.sh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unmute</a>), but it’s a wrapper, not <em>real</em> speech understanding. The model can’t hear the frustration in your voice and respond with empathy, it can’t emphasize important words in its answer, it cannot sense sarcasm, and so on.</p>
<p>Yes, there <em>are</em> LLMs (<a href="https://blog.google/technology/google-deepmind/gemini-2-5-native-audio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gemini</a>, <a href="https://openai.com/index/hello-gpt-4o/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ChatGPT</a>’s Advanced Voice Mode, <a href="https://qwen.ai/blog?id=fdfbaf2907a36b7659a470c77fb135e381302028&amp;from=research.research-list" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Qwen</a>, <a href="https://moshi.chat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Moshi</a>) that understand and generate speech natively. But in practice, they’re either not as smart, or they behave like text model wrappers. Try asking any of them “Am I speaking in a low voice or a high voice?” in a high-pitched voice, and they won’t be able to tell you.</p>
<p>Clearly, speech LLMs lag behind text LLMs. But why? For text, we found out a few years ago that if you take a lot of text data, a big Transformer, and a lot of GPUs, you’ll get some pretty damn good text continuation models. Why can’t we just replace text with audio and get pretty damn good speech continuation models?</p>
<p>As a teaser, here’s what happens when you try to do that naively (warning, loud):</p>

<p>We’ll have a look at why audio is harder to model than text and how we can make it easier with <em>neural audio codecs</em>, the de-facto standard way of getting audio into and out of LLMs. With a codec, we can turn audio into larger discrete <em>tokens</em>, train models to predict continuations for these tokens, and then decode those back into audio: see animation above.</p>
<p>Kyutai folks have done a lot of work in this space, which is part of the reason I chose to cover this topic. We’ll start from the basics and build up all the way to <a href="https://huggingface.co/kyutai/mimi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mimi</a>, our neural audio codec. It was originally developed for <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00037" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Moshi</a> and later adopted by others for their models, notably <a href="https://www.sesame.com/research/crossing_the_uncanny_valley_of_voice" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sesame’s CSM</a>.</p>
<h2 id="text-is-easy">Text is easy</h2>
<p>To <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/concepts/tokens#tokens" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tokenize</a> text, everybody uses a technique called byte-pair encoding and rarely changes the tokenizer: OpenAI has been using <a href="https://github.com/openai/tiktoken/blob/2ab6d3706d557b560b200be48e6a32324682c9a3/tiktoken/model.py#L8-L16C17" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the same tokenizer</a> since GPT-4o, an ancient model if you count in LLM years.</p>
<figure><p><img src="https://kyutai.org/next/assets/codec-explainer/image.png" alt=""></p><figcaption><p>A random text from Wikipedia tokenized via the GPT-4o tokenizer</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>You can even get decent results without tokenizing text at all, just predicting individual
characters. One of the first posts that got me excited about machine learning was
Andrej Karpathy’s <a href="https://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RNN effectiveness</a>
blog post from 2015. Karpathy trains a three-layer LSTM on a single GPU and gets
it to generate decent-looking code and LaTeX:</p>
<p><img src="https://kyutai.org/next/assets/codec-explainer/rnns-code.png" alt=""><img src="https://kyutai.org/next/assets/codec-explainer/rnns-latex.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Remember this was ten years ago, back when we didn’t even know that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_Is_All_You_Need" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">attention is all we need</a>.
Now compare Karpathy’s results to a sample from <a href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/wavenet-a-generative-model-for-raw-audio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WaveNet</a>, a model DeepMind published a year later:</p>

<p>Purely acoustically, the audio sounds good, but it rarely even manages to produce a single correct English word. We can’t be too hard on WaveNet, though. The samples from Karpathy’s RNNs are only a few thousand characters long, but this 10-second audio consists of 160k audio samples, and WaveNet creates it by painstakingly predicting sample-by-sample.</p>
<figure><div><video src="https://kyutai.org/next/assets/codec-explainer/wavenet-audio.mp4" autoplay="" loop="" muted="" playsinline=""></video><p>Click to play</p></div><figcaption><p>A single second of audio consists of tens of thousands of samples, although it

post</a>.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>It’s difficult to build models that are coherent over time scales this long, and the model also takes very long to run for so many steps.</p>
<p>So instead of running the model to predict the samples one-by-one directly, we’d like to train a model to compress the audio into a more manageable size. We could compress the audio, use an LLM to predict a continuation in the compressed representation, and then decompress the result.</p>
<h2 id="sample-by-sample">Sample by sample</h2>
<p>But first, let’s get a baseline model by generating audio sample by sample, like WaveNet does. <strong>The code for all of these experiments is open-source! Check it out <a href="https://github.com/kyutai-labs/nanoGPTaudio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</strong> I forked Andrej Karpathy’s <a href="https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nanoGPT</a> repo, a simple implementation of GPT-2.</p>
<p>Text and audio are kind of the same from the perspective of the language model: it’s just tokens in, tokens out. The only thing we need to do is to quantize the continuous values of the samples into discrete buckets. Like WaveNet, we’ll use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%9C-law_algorithm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"μ-law algorithm"</a> to get 256 buckets. We’ll treat those as 256 possible tokens.</p>
<p>Let’s train a language model on audio tokenized like this. For the dataset, we’ll use the <a href="https://ai.meta.com/tools/libri-light/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Libri-Light</a> dataset, following <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03143" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AudioLM</a> (with Neil Zeghidour, Eugene Kharitonov). Its train split contains 50k hours in total, but we’ll go with 1000 hours for this experiment. With this sample-by-sample tokenization, we end up with a dataset of 53 GB.</p>
<p>We train a small-ish transformer of 151.28M parameters, about the size of the <a href="https://openai.com/index/better-language-models/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">smallest GPT-2 variant</a>. When we sample from the model, it makes babbling sounds (warning, loud at times!):</p>

<p>Often, it goes into a “crackling mode” that it can’t seem to get out of:</p>

<p>I also trained a smaller model, which I teased at the beginning. It’s prone to generate nightmare fuel screeches (loud!):</p>

<p>As you can tell, we’re not AGI yet. It sounds speech-like, but you can’t make out a single word and the voice keeps changing. No wonder: the context size of the model is 2048, which, for 16 kHz audio, translates to 128ms, not even a the length of one word. Also, these 10-second examples took 30 minutes to generate on an H100, so we’re a few orders of magnitude away from being real-time.</p>
<p>So let’s build a neural audio codec to compress the audio. The hope is that if we reduce the sampling rate 100x, the model will also become “100x more coherent”. An old idea in machine learning is to do this using an <em>autoencoder:</em> a model that takes an input, compresses it into a smaller “latent space”, and then tries to reconstruct the original input.</p>
<p>In our case, we’ll want an autoencoder whose latent space is quantized so that we can feed the latents into a language model and produce continuations. (You <em>can</em> generate continuations with unquantized latents, but it’s trickier – see the <a href="#further-reading">Further reading</a> section.)</p>
<h2 id="autoencoders-with-vector-quantization-vq-vae">Autoencoders with vector quantization (VQ-VAE)</h2>
<p>Bear with me, because we’ll take a detour from audio: let’s build a quantized autoencoder on images from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07747" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fashion MNIST</a>. We’ll take a subset with the first three classes: t-shirt/top, trouser, and pullover.</p>
<figure><p><img src="https://kyutai.org/next/assets/codec-explainer/fashion-mnist-3.png" alt=""></p><figcaption><p><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/The-FashionMNIST-dataset-consists-of-10-classes-of-monochrome-clothing-items-and-is_fig1_373046669" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">image
source</a></p></figcaption></figure>
<p>First, let’s train a regular autoencoder to encode the images into two-dimensional space:</p>
<figure><div><video src="https://kyutai.org/next/assets/codec-explainer/vq_images_unquantized_v2.mp4" autoplay="" loop="" muted="" playsinline=""></video><p>Click to play</p></div><figcaption><p>Training a regular autoencoder on Fashion MNIST</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>Each frame shows one batch of training, with some batches skipped. The little images are the autoencoder’s reconstructions for the images in the batch. I’ve added colors for the three classes (t-shirt/top=blue trousers=green, pullover=yellow), but the autoencoder doesn’t get a class as input – the space just naturally clusters by class. Let's zoom in on a few reconstructions:</p>
<figure><p><img src="https://kyutai.org/next/assets/codec-explainer/rvq-without-quantization-v4.png" alt=""></p><figcaption><p>Original images (top) and their reconstructed versions (bottom)</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>As you can tell, the reconstruction quality is not great. The images are blurry and the first two images are reconstructed to nearly the same thing. But we used a tiny network (4 fully connected layers for the encoder and decoder each) and projected into a mere two dimensions, so we can’t expect too much of our model.</p>
<p>Now let’s quantize these embeddings using a clustering. We’ll do something like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">k-means</a>: we’ll maintain a list of the positions of the cluster centers. We initialize the positions randomly. For each training batch, we look at which embeddings would go to each cluster. (We don’t modify the embeddings, we just look at the assignment). Then we’ll nudge each cluster center towards the average position of these embeddings.</p>
<p>Also, if a center is unused for a while, we teleport it to a random embedding from the batch, because otherwise it has no way to get unstuck from its current position.</p>
<figure><div><video src="https://kyutai.org/next/assets/codec-explainer/vq_images_unquantized_with_clustering_v2.mp4" autoplay="" loop="" muted="" playsinline=""></video><p>Click to play</p></div><figcaption><p>Quantizing by fitting a clustering on top of the autoencoder</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>You can see the reconstructions of the cluster centers getting refined over time.</p>
<p>Next, we’ll make the encoder and decoder themselves better at handling quantized embeddings during training, because currently, we’re just fitting the clustering on top of an autoencoder that is not “aware” it’s being quantized. We’d like the autoencoder to adapt to the quantization as we train it. Currently, we’re doing this:</p>
<pre><code>x = get_batch()
z = encoder(x)

x_reconstructed = decoder(z)

loss = reconstruction_loss(x, x_reconstructed)
</code></pre>
<p>Instead of feeding the unquantized embedding into the decoder, we’ll first move it to the closest cluster:</p>
<pre><code>x = get_batch()
z = encoder(x)

z_quantized = to_nearest_cluster(z)     <span># 👈</span>
x_reconstructed = decoder(z_quantized)  <span># 👈</span>

loss = reconstruction_loss(x, x_reconstructed)
</code></pre>
<p>There is a snag: if we do this, we won’t be able to train the autoencoder any more, because the quantization operation is not differentiable, meaning there is no gradient flowing from the loss to the weights of the encoder. Essentially, we’re no longer able to answer the question: “if I want the loss to decrease a bit, in which direction should I nudge the encoder’s weights?”</p>
<p>We’ll fix this problem by pretending it doesn’t exist. Yes, really. We’ll think of <code>z_quantized</code> as <code>z</code> moved by an arbitrary vector that doesn’t affect the gradient. That will make the gradient of <code>z</code> equal to that of <code>z_quantized</code>, which is why this is also known as the <em>straight-through estimator</em> of the gradient.</p>
<pre><code>x = get_batch()
z = encoder(x)

residual = z - to_nearest_cluster(z)
<span># .detach() means "forget that this needs a gradient"</span>
z_quantized = z - residual.detach()
x_reconstructed = decoder(z_quantized)

loss = reconstruction_loss(x, x_reconstructed)
</code></pre>
<p>In the forward pass, <code>z_quantized</code> is set to the same value as before, but importantly, the gradient of <code>z</code> is now equal to that of <code>z_quantized</code> rather than just being 0 because of the non-differentiable <code>to_nearest_cluster(z)</code> operation.</p>
<p>There is a price to pay for this lie. When training, the encoder’s weights will be updated to improve the reconstruction loss, but they’re updated as if the quantization didn’t happen, so they won’t move in the optimal direction. But as long as the embeddings stick close to their cluster centers, the gradient direction will still be mostly correct.</p>
<p>We can actually encourage the encoder to make embeddings that are easily quantizable by adding a <em>commitment loss</em>: a penalty for each point based on how far it is from its cluster center. The gradient of this loss will push the points closer to their cluster centers.</p>
<p>By quantizing at training time and adding a commitment loss, it’s no longer just a clustering being fit on top of the embeddings. The model itself is trained to be good for quantization.</p>
<figure><div><video src="https://kyutai.org/next/assets/codec-explainer/vq_images_balanced_v2.mp4" autoplay="" loop="" muted="" playsinline=""></video><p>Click to play</p></div><figcaption><p>An autoencoder trained explicitly to be easy to quantize</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>You’ll notice that the training dynamics look different: the commitment loss adds a certain “stiffness” that doesn’t allow the embeddings to move around as easily.</p>
<p>Here’s what the reconstructions look like when we use the quantized representations:</p>
<figure><p><img src="https://kyutai.org/next/assets/codec-explainer/rvq-1-level-v4.png" alt=""></p><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
<p>Notice how the first two images are reconstructed to <em>exactly</em> the same image. That’s simply because their embeddings got assigned to the same cluster and therefore quantized to the same value.</p>
<p>The model described here is known as a “<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00937" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VQ-VAE</a>”: a vector-quantized variational autoencoder. The word “variational” here is just a vestigial leftover that doesn’t mean anything anymore.</p>
<h2 id="residual-vector-quantization">Residual vector quantization</h2>
<p>To improve the reconstruction fidelity, we can just increase the number of cluster centers. But keeping track of too many centers can get prohibitively expensive in terms of compute and memory required, so we’ll do a clever trick: if we want 2^20 (~1M) possible values, we won’t create 2^20 clusters directly. Instead, we’ll use two separate quantizers with 2^10=1024 clusters and combine their result. Each embedding will then be quantized to a tuple of two integers in [0..1023], yielding 2^20 possible combinations.</p>
<p>Ok, but how? Well, recall the <code>residual</code> variable we used in the straight-through estimator, defined as <code>z - to_nearest_cluster(z)</code> the shift from the quantized embedding to the unquantized one. It represents the part of the original vector <code>z</code> that we didn’t manage to take into account when quantizing to <code>to_nearest_cluster(z)</code>.</p>
<p>So for each embedding in the batch, we have a corresponding residual vector. The solution is obvious: we’ll quantize these residuals exactly the same way we did with the original embeddings, by training another vector quantizer.</p>
<p>This time, the 2D positions for a single quantizer don’t define images because we need to combine the two quantizers, so we’ll just visualize everything as dots:</p>
<figure><div><video src="https://kyutai.org/next/assets/codec-explainer/rvq_fmnist.mp4" autoplay="" loop="" muted="" playsinline=""></video><p>Click to play</p></div><figcaption><p>Two-level quantization by fitting a quantizer on top of the
“residuals”, aka the errors of the first quantizer</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>Each image is then represented as the index of the cluster of the embedding and that of the residual. Let’s try to reconstruct a few images with this two-level quantizer:</p>
<figure><p><img src="https://kyutai.org/next/assets/codec-explainer/rvq-2-level-v4.png" alt=""></p><figcaption><p>Original images (top), one-level reconstruction (middle), two-level
reconstruction (bottom). These images are encoded as (4, 3), (4, 5), (16, 21),
and (30, 3).</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>The reconstructions of the first two images are similar, but no longer the exact same: the first image is represented as (4, 3) and the second as (4, 5). In other words, they share the same token for the first level, but differ in how the residual is quantized. The differences are quite subtle, so here’s a comparison between the one-level and two-level reconstructions:</p>
<figure><p><img src="https://kyutai.org/next/assets/codec-explainer/rvq-2-level-diff-v3.png" alt=""></p><figcaption><p>Difference between one-level and two-level reconstructions</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>I’d like to emphasize that the second quantization level makes modifications to the embedding, not the output pixels directly. This can be seen by the fact that the leftmost and rightmost image are encoded as (4, 3) and (30, 3) respectively. So they have the same residual code, 3, but it modifies the two reconstructed images in different ways.</p>
<p>Clearly, the reconstructions are still not very accurate. The upper bound on the quality is the reconstruction from unquantized embeddings, so if your autoencoder is bad (and ours is), improving the quantization won’t save you.</p>
<p>We’ll stop here, but a natural extension to this idea is to go beyond two levels. Just take the residuals of the two-level reconstruction and quantize those, and so on. This generalized Residual Vector Quantization algorithm looks like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>def</span> <span>rvq_quantize</span>(<span>z</span>):
    residual = z
    codes = []

    <span>for</span> level <span>in</span> <span>range</span>(levels):
        quantized, cluster_i = to_nearest_cluster(level, residual)
        residual -= quantized
        codes.append(cluster_i)

    <span>return</span> codes
</code></pre>
<p>Residual vector quantization was first applied to neural audio codecs in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03312" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SoundStream</a>, but the idea <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1171604" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has been around since the 80s</a>.</p>
<h2 id="now-lets-tokenize-audio">Now let’s tokenize audio</h2>
<p>Applying RVQ to audio is fairly straightforward. As our autoencoder, we’ll use a convolutional neural network (CNN) similar to <a href="https://github.com/openai/jukebox/blob/08efbbc1d4ed1a3cef96e08a931944c8b4d63bb3/jukebox/vqvae/encdec.py" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">what Jukebox uses</a>. The details of the architecture aren’t too important here. What’s important is that it’s a network that takes an audio with <em>t</em> samples and converts it to a vector of shape <em>(t/128, 32)</em>. In other words, it downsamples by a factor of 128 and gives us 32-dimensional float representations. The decoder then takes the <em>(t/128, 32)</em> embeddings and decodes them back into <em>t</em> samples.</p>
<pre><code>audio = get_batch()               <span># shape: [B, T]</span>
z = encoder(audio)                <span># shape: [B, T/128, 32]</span>
audio_reconstructed = decoder(z)  <span># shape: [B, T]</span>
</code></pre>
<p>As before, we’ll add an RVQ after the encoder. The only difference from the image case is that for each audio sample, we have <em>t/128</em> embedding vectors, not just a single one as we did for images. We just quantize these independently (even though the encoder “sees” more audio than what corresponds to that one vector). During training, we also have a batch dimension, so our model now looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>audio = get_batch()                         <span># [B, T]</span>
z = encoder(audio)                          <span># [B, T/128, 32]</span>

<span># Combine the batch and time dimensions</span>
z = rearrange(                              <span># [B*T/128, 32]</span>
    z, <span>"b t_emb d -&gt; (b t_emb) d"</span>
)

codes = rvq_quantize(z)           <span># integers, [B*T/128, levels]</span>
z_quantized = codes_to_embeddings(codes)    <span># [B*T/128, 32]</span>
z_quantized = rearrange(                    <span># [B, T/128, 32]</span>
    z, <span>"(b t_emb) d -&gt; b t_emb d"</span>
)

audio_reconstructed = decoder(z_quantized)  <span># [B, T]</span>
</code></pre>

<p>The last missing piece before we can train our first neural audio codec is a loss function. There’s a whole rabbit hole we could go into about which one to choose, but we’ll avoid it and just use a very simple one. We’ll compute the log amplitude spectrogram of the original and reconstructed audio, and take their difference. The loss is the mean square of this difference between spectrograms.</p>
<p>To make it harder for the model to overfit to this loss, we take the spectrogram with three different parameters for the short-time Fourier transform, and let our loss be the mean between the three sub-losses. This is called the <em>multi-scale spectral loss</em>.</p>
<figure><p><img src="https://kyutai.org/next/assets/codec-explainer/image%202.png" alt=""></p><figcaption><p>Image from Evan Radkoff’s excellent <a href="https://www.soundsandwords.io/audio-loss-functions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog
post</a> about loss
functions in audio ML. Check it out if you want to go down the loss function
rabbit hole.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>Finally, let’s train some codecs! We’ll look at how varying the number of RVQ levels affects the reconstruction quality. As we expected, increasing the number of levels helps, decreasing the spectral loss:</p>
<figure><p><img src="https://kyutai.org/next/assets/codec-explainer/image%203.png" alt=""></p><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
<p>Let’s hear what the codecs sound like. We’ll use the three codecs to reconstruct this audio from the <a href="https://speechbot.github.io/expresso/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Expresso dataset</a>:</p>

<p>And the reconstructions:</p>

<p>Clearly, the audio gets better as we add more RVQ levels.</p>
<p>Even with 16 levels, there is some crackling, the audio sounds muffled, and there is a constant high-pitched noise. Later we’ll discuss how we could improve the codec further, but for demonstration purposes, this will do.</p>
<h2 id="why-care-about-audio">Why care about audio</h2>
<p>So now we have a neural audio codec: we can turn audio into LLM-friendly tokens and back. Codec just means a tokenizer for audio, but we say <em>codec</em> because that’s the term used for classic compression like MP3. I’ll be using codec and tokenizer interchangeably.</p>
<p>Let’s come back to what we wanted to do in the first place: modeling audio. Specifically, we’ll make a model that can take an audio prefix and generate a plausible continuation for it.</p>
<p>Just as a reminder, we want to train good audio LLMs so that we have models that understand and produce speech natively, understanding emotion, emphasis, and so on. They could also be fine-tuned into <a href="https://kyutai.org/next/tts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">text-to-speech</a>, <a href="https://kyutai.org/next/stt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">speech-to-text</a>, or <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03382" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">translation models</a>, among others.</p>
<p>So now that you’re convinced that audio LLMs are the path to AGI, let’s train a few.</p>
<p>For our dataset, we’ll use <a href="https://ai.meta.com/tools/libri-light/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Libri-Light</a>, like we did for our sample-by-sample model earlier. This time we’ll use 10000h of audio instead of 1000h. It’s a dataset of public-domain audiobooks, so if we have a good model for it, maybe we’ll be able to generate more stories. (Don’t get your hopes up too much.) All we need to do is to convert the audio dataset into a sequence of discrete tokens so that we can feed it into an LLM.</p>
<h2 id="dealing-with-multiple-levels">Dealing with multiple levels</h2>
<p>We’ll do that using our 8-level RVQ codec. From an audio with <em>t</em> samples, we’ll get an array of tokens of shape <em>(t/128, 8)</em>. But now there’s an issue: how to deal with the fact that for each time step, there’s not one but eight tokens? This is not a problem we have to deal with in text LLMs, where we have a single sequence of tokens.</p>
<p>We’ll do the simplest thing possible and just flatten the array into 1D of shape <em>(t/128 * 8)</em>, and have our LLM predict the eight levels in separate time steps.</p>
<figure><div><video src="https://kyutai.org/next/assets/codec-explainer/flattenRvq.mp4" autoplay="" loop="" muted="" playsinline=""></video><p>Click to play</p></div><figcaption><p>Flattening a three-level RVQ to allow it to be fed into a language model</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>The big disadvantage is that we lose some of our temporal compression. We downsampled the audio 128x, but now we’re inflating it 8x again by flattening the levels. That makes inference less efficient, and possibly worse quality because the effective context size decreases. We'll be using the 8 RVQ codec rather than the 16 RVQ one to avoid making the compression even worse.</p>
<p>You could also predict all RVQ levels for a single step at once (”parallel pattern”), but it also makes things harder for the model because it has to decide on all levels at once. There are a bunch of other schemes people have tried to balance compression and quality. Here are a few tried out in MusicGen:</p>

<p>Interestingly, as of 2025, there is no single solution that “won”: every paper does something different, and the schemes can get quite involved. Just look at this diagram from <a href="https://github.com/XiaomiMiMo/MiMo-Audio/blob/main/MiMo-Audio-Technical-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MiMo-Audio</a>, a model released in September 2025:</p>

<h2 id="finally-lets-train">Finally, let's train</h2>
<p>Time to finally train a codec-wrapped language model! As I’ve mentioned, <a href="https://github.com/kyutai-labs/nanoGPTaudio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our code</a> is based on Andrej Karpathy’s <a href="https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nanoGPT codebase</a> for training text LLMs. We just need to modify it to accept audio as input. But that’s easy, because LLMs don’t care about what kind of tokens you’re feeding in – it’s all just numbers. Once we’ve tokenized the dataset and flattened it into a 1D sequence, we’re good to go. Tokenized this way, our 10000 hours of audio take up 134 GB. For comparison, storing this much data as uncompressed audio would take over 1 TB.</p>
<p>We’re going to use the exact same model architecture and hyperparameters as for the sample-by-sample model: the only difference is in the tokenization. We also have a 10x bigger dataset, but the sample-by-sample model can’t even fit the dataset with 1k hours, so more data wouldn’t save it.</p>
<p>I trained the model on 8 H100s for about 5 days. To get some samples, I decided to prompt the model with a sample of Libri-Light reading of two lines from <a href="https://www.theotherpages.org/poems/field02.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael Field’s poem July</a>. (As I learned when working on this, Michael Field is a pen name of Katherine Harris and Edith Emma Cooper.) Let’s see what kind of poetry we can get from our model:</p>

<p>There are some signs of life, but we don’t have a poet yet. It sounds like somebody speaking behind a curtain. You can’t really make out what it’s saying, but the intonation is there: it sounds like somebody reading from a book, which is indeed what the model was trained on.</p>
<p>It also maintains a coherent voice, until it decides for the last few seconds to switch to a different one. That is also consistent with the data: we sample the training data from a concatenation of all the audiobooks chopped up into segments and mixed together, so the model does encounter boundaries between different speakers.</p>
<h2 id="how-far-can-a-codec-get-us">How far can a codec get us?</h2>
<p>Our codec was deliberately simplistic, which explains why the results aren't great—but there's been a good amount of research on neural audio codecs in the last four years that we could leverage.
We won’t implement all the improvements here, but instead we’ll look at what happens when we use <a href="https://huggingface.co/kyutai/mimi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mimi</a> as the tokenizer.</p>
<p>Mimi is a modern neural audio codec built here at Kyutai for <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00037" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Moshi</a>, our audio language model. It’s since been used as the tokenizer for other models as well, like <a href="https://www.sesame.com/research/crossing_the_uncanny_valley_of_voice" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sesame CSM</a>, <a href="https://herimor.github.io/voxtream/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VoXtream</a>, and <a href="https://www.liquid.ai/blog/lfm2-audio-an-end-to-end-audio-foundation-model" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LFM2-Audio</a>.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Mimi sounds a lot better than the homemade codec we trained earlier.</p>
<p>Instead of the multi-scale spectral loss, Mimi uses an adversarial loss, like a GAN. There’s a discriminator network that tries to classify audios as being original or reconstructed by the codec, and the goal of the codec is to fool this discriminator.</p>
<p>Another improvement Mimi adds is using RVQ dropout: it uses 32 RVQ levels but during training, the reconstruction is sometimes randomly truncated to a lower number of levels. That allows us to run Mimi for a lower number of RVQ levels at inference time and still get decent results, because it doesn’t rely on all levels being present. For our codec, we had to train separately.</p>
<p>Let’s hear our example audio reconstructed with Mimi:</p>
<p>Original</p>


<p>For our purposes, a variant with fewer levels might have the advantage of being easier to model because it’s more compressed. Let’s train models with 8- and 32-level Mimi and compare the results.</p>
<p>I trained the exact same model architecture as before, the only thing that changes is the tokenizer. It’s 10k hours from Libri-Light as the dataset, just like when we used our simple codec. Mimi has a sample rate of 24 kHz but Libri-Light uses 16 kHz, which puts a cap on how good it can sound, since we lose the higher frequencies of the audio.</p>
<p>Mimi downsamples the audio a lot more aggressively, too: its sample rate is 12.5 frames per second, whereas we used 125 frames per second for our codec – 10x higher! This means the dataset is also smaller on disk. With our codec, it took 134 GB, but for Mimi it’s “just” 54 GB.</p>
<p>Here’s a poem generated with the model trained on Mimi-tokenized data. I prompted it with two lines from the poem, as before:</p>

<p>Here is my best attempt at a transcription:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>When the grass is gone<br>
And corn still grassy;</em><br>
Illness worried in the fur<br>
this and pelan in stones<br>
during the turan’s ciscerey<br>
headforths nepet Paul Twain.<br>
He <em>sees</em> zin in them.<br></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A tad too surrealist for my taste, but maybe Lewis Carroll would like it.</p>
<h2 id="semantic-tokens">Semantic tokens</h2>
<p>I have a confession to make: I lied to you just now. But just a bit, and for didactic purposes. In fact, the model above was trained on audio from a 31-level Mimi, where I omitted the very first level, which contains the “semantic token”.</p>
<p>The role of this token is to represent semantic information of the audio, without necessarily aiding reconstruction. I won’t go into how these work, but in one sentence, Mimi’s semantic tokens are distilled from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.13900" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WavLM</a>, which you can think of as a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BERT</a> for speech.</p>
<p>To get a feeling for what information semantic tokens encode, let’s take this example audio, passed through Mimi:</p>

<p>Now let’s train a language model trained on the full Mimi, including semantic tokens. We’re going to run the model in a way where we keep the semantic tokens from the original audio but we discard the others, and let the model predict them. That means the information from the semantic tokens is fixed (”teacher-forced”), but the model is free to decide the others according to what continuations it finds plausible.</p>
<figure><div><video src="https://kyutai.org/next/assets/codec-explainer/regenerateWithSemantic.mp4" autoplay="" loop="" muted="" playsinline=""></video><p>Click to play</p></div><figcaption><p>We can get an idea of what information is contained in semantic tokens by
keeping them fixed and letting the model regenerate the rest.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>Listen to two different reconstructions we obtain this way:</p>


<p>The voice is completely different, but it’s saying the same thing! This means the semantic tokens encode what the person is saying, but are invariant to the voice. That’s useful because it helps the model focus on <em>what</em> to say, not <em>how</em> to say it. In that regard, they’re closer to text tokens, which also don’t contain information about the voice, intonation, timing, or emotion.</p>
<h2 id="making-poetry-semantic">Making poetry semantic</h2>
<p>Now let’s take the model trained on semantic Mimi and ask it to complete the poem:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>When grass is gone<br>
and corn still grassy;</em><br>
from the man was nothing moan.<br>
The low death and heart<br>
She came <em>fyde</em> wood.<br>
A finteriest, a fall,<br>
all them.<br></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It still makes up words and the sentences are not too coherent, but clearly, the proportion of real words is much higher; the model is “more semantic”. The acoustic quality is the same, which is what we’d expect.</p>
<p>Let’s listen to a second poem:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>When grass is gone<br>
and corn still grassy;</em><br>
hope won and she<br>
who is just a night in Tatan<br>
in doe ock-ohm?<br>
the whom?<br></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed, the whom?</p>
<h2 id="semanticacoustic-tradeoff">Semantic–acoustic tradeoff</h2>
<p>We can sacrifice some acoustic quality to improve the semantics by reducing the number of RVQ levels. Let’s do 8. That way, we get higher audio compression, and a proportionally higher part of the loss comes from the semantic token, since now it’s 1/8 tokens and not just 1/32.</p>
<p>One of the first things I noticed about this model is that it learned to memorize the Librivox notice, so it sometimes generates things like:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Chapter 6 of The Founday, by R. Auclair.<br>
This is a Librivox recording. All Librivox recordings are in the public domain. For information, or to volunteer, please visit librivox.org.<br>
Reading by: Kelvert</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Repeating the training data is generally not what you want, but in our case it’s a great sign of life, because the previous models couldn’t even manage that. It also makes up the book, author, and reader, so there is still novelty here.</p>
<p>Now let’s try to make some more poetry:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>When grass is gone<br>
and corn still grassy;</em><br>
When so we could say<br>
that in fairy interesting wife<br>
who lay there and gone<br>
that save the rosy light of life<br>
Jay Dien, the antique mollity<br>
and a mollity the beast of gray failed summon<br></p>
<p>end of poem.</p>
<p>This recording is in the public domain.</p>
<p>[different voice]<br>
So we have formed a float that sent in would rattle down. The piece of opportunity reading and assimila—</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is great. There are several signs of the model being better than the previous ones. I love that it makes up the word “mollity” and then repeats it in the next line. Also, it realizes that it’s reciting a poem and ends the section with “end of poem”. Then it decides it’s the end of the chapter/section and it ends with the “This recording is in the public domain.” disclaimer. After that, it changes the voice and continues talking. That makes sense, since the clips from various audiobooks are just shuffled and concatenated during training, so here the model simulated a clip boundary.</p>
<p>We might get even better results by weighing the loss of the semantic tokens higher than the acoustic tokens, to make the model focus more on the meaning than the sound – in fact, Moshi uses a semantic loss factor of 100x! But we have to stop somewhere.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>We’ve managed to use neural audio codecs to make an audio language model that generates somewhat coherent speech. Obviously, that’s not where the state of the art is in 2025 (and we’re not trying to reach it here) but keep in mind that by using the <em>exact same model</em> without neural audio codecs gives us this:</p>

<p>Of course, still a long way to go to match text models! Currently, there seems to be a trade-off between speech understanding and reasoning abilities. At the beginning, I mentioned that the speech-native models (<a href="https://blog.google/technology/google-deepmind/gemini-2-5-native-audio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gemini</a>, ChatGPT’s <a href="https://openai.com/index/hello-gpt-4o/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Advanced Voice Mode</a>, <a href="https://qwen.ai/blog?id=fdfbaf2907a36b7659a470c77fb135e381302028&amp;from=research.research-list" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Qwen</a>, <a href="https://moshi.chat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Moshi</a>) aren’t able to tell you whether you’re speaking in a high or low voice, despite the fact that they’re trained to natively understand audio. This is likely because they’re trained on a lot of data generated synthetically with text-to-speech and/or because understanding the tone of the voice (apparently) doesn’t help the models make more accurate predictions.</p>
<p>Kyutai took a stab at creating a voice chat based on an audio language model with Moshi (<a href="https://moshi.chat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">demo</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00037" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">paper</a>), released in July 2024. Moshi might not be the AI you’d pick to do your homework for you, but cut it some slack: it was the first end-to-end voice AI, released even before OpenAI’s Advanced Voice Mode.</p>
<p>Moshi models an “inner monologue” text stream in parallel with audio streams for itself and the user. The text stream is helps it plan what it’s going to say, and ablations showed that the text stream helps the model massively. At the same time, it’s a bit sad: most of the reasoning seems to be delegated to the text stream and the audio streams are just there to provide an integrated speech-to-text and text-to-speech.</p>
<figure><p><img src="https://kyutai.org/next/assets/codec-explainer/moshi-figure-1.png" alt=""></p><figcaption><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00037" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Moshi</a> models two audio streams and a text
stream in parallel</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>It’s not just Moshi: as the “am I speaking in a high voice” experiment shows, this over-reliance on text in favor of audio is an issue for all audio LLMs. And that’s even though the dominant modeling approach is somewhat different than Moshi’s: interleaving text and audio tokens instead of modeling them in parallel streams.</p>
<p>Over a year after Moshi, audio models still lag behind text LLMs. But why? To me, this mysterious unsolved “modality gap” makes audio ML an exciting field to work on.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        

        <p>What the fuck happened to making HTTP requests? You used to just type <code>curl example.com</code> and boom, you got your goddamn response. Now everyone's downloading 500MB Electron monstrosities that take 3 minutes to boot up just to send a fucking GET request.</p>

        <h2 id="yougotit">It's already on your machine, dipshit</h2>

        <p>You know what's better than downloading Postman? <em>Not downloading Postman.</em> cURL is already installed on your machine. It's been there since forever. It works. It's fast. It doesn't need to render a fucking Chromium instance to make a web request. <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45645172">It doesn't depend on a service to run.</a> <a href="https://github.com/postmanlabs/postman-app-support/issues/6999#issuecomment-2683282252">It doesn't require an "Enterprise" subscription for basic features.</a></p>

        <h2 id="itdoes">It actually does everything</h2>

        <p>Oh, you need to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Send POST requests? <code>curl -X POST</code></li>
            <li>Add headers? <code>curl -H "Header: value"</code></li>
            <li>Upload files? <code>curl -F file=@file.txt</code></li>
            <li>Handle cookies? <code>curl -c cookies.txt -b cookies.txt</code></li>
            <li>Follow redirects? <code>curl -L</code></li>
            <li>Basic auth? <code>curl -u user:pass</code></li>
            <li>OAuth? Yeah, it does that too.</li>
            <li>HTTP/2? HTTP/3? FTP? SFTP? SMTP? IMAP? POP3? LDAP? <a href="https://eissing.org/icing/posts/curl-websocket/">WebSocket</a>? Fucking <em>Gopher</em>? Yes to all of it.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Meanwhile Postman is over here asking you to create an account to sync your "collections" to the cloud. <em>It's a fucking HTTP request, not your photo library.</em></p>

        <h2 id="ui-ux">The UI/UX is perfect</h2>

        <p>You know what has great UX? <em>The command line you're already using.</em> No clicking through 47 tabs. No "Workspaces." No "Environments" dropdown menu. Just type the fucking command. Your history is in your shell. Your "collections" are called shell scripts. Your "environments" are called environment variables, and they've existed since 1979.</p>

        <p>Want to save a request? Put it in a file. Want to share it with your team? It's text. Copy it. Paste it. Done. No JSON export/import bullshit. No proprietary formats.</p>

        <h2 id="itsfaster">It's faster than your bloated piece of shit</h2>

        <p>cURL executes in milliseconds. You know how long it takes Postman to start? Long enough to question your career choices. And don't even get me started on these new "modern" alternatives like Insomnia and HTTPie Desktop. Congratulations, you've turned a 2MB command-line tool into a 300MB desktop app. Progress!</p>

        <h2 id="pretty">But muh GraphQL, muh pretty interface!</h2>

        <p>Shut up. You can pipe cURL to <code>jq</code>:</p>

        <pre><code>curl -X POST https://api.example.com/graphql \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "{ users { name } }"}' \
  | jq '.'</code></pre>

        <p>Now you have syntax highlighting and JSON parsing. Total install size: ~10MB. Total startup time: instant. Total RAM usage: negligible. Total feelings of superiority: immeasurable.</p>

        <p>Don't trust yourself with JSON syntax? Fine, use <code>jo</code>:</p>

        <pre><code>curl -X POST https://api.example.com/api/users \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \

        <h2 id="fadq">Frequently Asked Dumb Questions</h2>
        <p><strong>Q: But I can't see my request history!</strong></p>
        <p>A: Yes you can, it's called <code>history | grep curl</code>. Or write your commands in a fucking file like an adult.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: How do I organize my requests?</strong></p>
        <p>A: Put your shell scripts into directories, genius.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: The syntax is hard to remember!</strong></p>
        <p>A: Type <code>man curl</code> or <code>curl --help</code>. Or literally just Google it once and save the command. You can remember 400 Kubernetes commands but not <code>curl -X POST</code>?</p>

        <p><strong>Q: What about team collaboration?</strong></p>
        <p>A: It's a text file. Put it in Git. You know, that thing you should be using anyway? Now your requests have version control, code review, and diffs. For free. Revolutionary, I know.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: But Postman has testing and automation!</strong></p>
        <p>A: So does cURL in a shell script with <code>||</code> and <code>&amp;&amp;</code> and actual programming languages. You want assertions? Pipe to <code>grep</code> or write a 3-line Python script. Done.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: What about cookie management?</strong></p>
        <p>A: <code>-c</code> to save cookies, <code>-b</code> to send them. This has been solved since 1999. Read the manual.</p>

        <h2 id="useit">Just use cURL</h2>

        <p>It's been downloaded over 20 billion times. It supports 25+ protocols. It's in cars, refrigerators, TV sets, routers, printers, phones, and every goddamn server on the planet. It's maintained by people who actually understand networking, not some VC-funded startup that'll slap "AI" on it next quarter.</p>

        <p>Stop using resource-hogging garbage. Stop creating accounts for basic functionality. Stop pretending you need a GUI to make HTTP requests.</p>

        <p><strong>Just use cURL.</strong></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>NASA's Acting Administrator has admitted that SpaceX is behind in plans to return astronauts to the Moon, has reopened lander contract competition, and pushed the deadline for a lunar landing to the end of the Trump administration in 2029.</p>
<p>Elon Musk, the boss of SpaceX, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1980335879945351303">fired back</a>: "SpaceX is moving like lightning compared to the rest of the space industry. Moreover, Starship will end up doing the whole Moon mission. Mark my words."</p>
<p>As we <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/16/spacexs_starship_two_down_a/">noted</a> last week, SpaceX has a mountain to climb to develop NASA's Human Landing System (HLS). After a slew of unplanned explosions, the company achieved two sub-orbital missions for its monster rocket - impressive, but still more than 200,000 miles (322,000 km) from the Moon.</p>

    

<p>NASA's patience has worn thin. Despite praising SpaceX as an "amazing company" doing "remarkable things," Acting Administrator Sean Duffy <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/SecDuffyNASA/status/1980243865400701369">said</a> the company was "behind schedule" and he's opening the astronaut landing contract to competition. "The President wants to make sure we beat the Chinese. He wants to get there in his term."</p>

        


        

<p>So, Artemis III could be slipping to the end of 2028 (or January 2029 at a pinch), and SpaceX might not be doing the landing. Duffy called out Blue Origin, "and maybe others," as alternatives to Musk's rocketeers.</p>
<p>In 2021, SpaceX bagged the lunar lander <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/04/16/nasa_spacex_moon/">contract</a>, beating Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin and Dynetics. The inevitable lawsuit from Blue Origin was <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/08/16/blue_origin_lawsuit/">filed</a> in August that year, which halted work for a few months, before the claims were <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/11/05/blue_origin_nasa_spacex_court/">dismissed</a> in November, 2021.</p>

        

<p>The original 2024 landing target has already slipped to 2027 — but even that looks increasingly unrealistic. Artemis II won't launch until 2026, and in September, NASA's Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/22/nasa_starship_artemis_doubts/">expressed serious doubts</a> about SpaceX's HLS readiness.</p>
<p>According to a New York Times <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/20/us/politics/spacex-us-moon-race.html">report</a>, the HLS variant of Starship might not be ready until 2032. Musk <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1969492141152817636">dismissed it</a>: "It's not worth lining a parrot cage with NY Times, let alone reading it."</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/20/esa_helicopter_training/">Like Apollo before them, ESA astronauts hone lunar landing skills in helicopters</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/01/spacex_sets_the_eve_of/">SpaceX rockets toward next Starship launch, set for October 13</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/22/nasa_starship_artemis_doubts/">NASA panel fears a Starship lunar touchdown is more fantasy than flight plan</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/12/nasa_science_gets_a_boost/">US House Appropriations Committee saves NASA budget, Prez holds the veto pen</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Yet Duffy's announcement confirms NASA is finally acknowledging that SpaceX is behind and 2027 is wishful thinking rather than reality.</p>
<p>Blue Origin <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nasa.gov/centers-and-facilities/marshall/nasa-selects-blue-origin-as-second-artemis-lunar-lander-provider/">is currently scheduled</a> to land a crew on the Moon with Artemis V in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/nasa-fiscal-year-2025-budget-summary.pdf">2030</a> [PDF, page 6]. As the Apollo program demonstrated, sufficient government funding can put boots on the regolith quickly. SpaceX can also rebid.</p>
<p>The bigger question is that with NASA's budget already struggling to maintain current <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/12/nasa_science_gets_a_boost/">science funding</a>, where will the agency find the cash needed to land astronauts before Trump's term ends? ®</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page">
<a href="https://quarters.captaintouch.com/">Back to overview</a>

<p>This year my side project of choice was to create a brand new game for Palm OS, it started out as something that I thought I would finish in a month but ended up taking more than half a year in the end.</p>

<p>Let me present you with StarGrid, a space themed strategy game played on a hexagonal grid:</p>
<video controls="" src="https://quarters.captaintouch.com/blog/posts/images/20251021_stargrid.mp4"><a src="images/20251021_stargrid.mp4">Video of StarGrid in action</a></video>
<p>StarGrid is a turn-based strategy game for Palm OS where you command a fleet of ships in a battle for control of the galaxy. Capture enemy flags, outmaneuver opposing fleets, and defend your own base in tense, tactical matches. Every move counts, will you strike boldly or play the long game to claim victory?</p>

<h2>Play it!</h2>
<p>No Palm OS device at hand? No problem, just play it on your browser thanks to the CloudPilot emulator.</p>
<a href="https://quarters.captaintouch.com/captainsstargrid.html">Game download and in-browser emulator</a>

<h2>How it was made</h2>
<p>Allot of 'manual' labor went into this game, no premade game engine, no additional sdk's. Just making it from scratch, trying to solve one technical puzzle after another,  but learning so many neat things along the way. </p>

<p>Coding for Palm certainly comes with it's own obstacles:</p>
<p>- Memory is tight so you need to take into account devices that can't even keep the playing field into memory, solution there was to hide the tiles when ships are moving. </p>
<p>- Maximum code size itself is also very limited, requiring you to segment your application into multiple individual parts. Detailed documentation on this was long gone, so I had to scrap some info together from developers that uploaded their 25 year old code to GitHub.</p>

<p>You can follow along the blog posts to see how I got here:</p>

<p>Here's a video when playtesting the game on multiple Palm devices (cpu vs cpu action):</p>

<h2>What's next? </h2>
<p>I won't immediately jump into the next big sideproject, I think I need a breather. I do however have some ideas lined up that I've been wanting to explore for a while now: </p>
<p>- making a top-down racing game (think micromachines)</p>
<p>- create an Outrun or Lotus III-like racing game</p>
<p>- building a ray-tracing game (like wolf3d). </p>
<p>Much more exciting stuff to come.</p>

<h2>Why do this?</h2>
<p>It's my way of keeping my favorite handheld operating system alive.</p>

<h2>It's all in the source!</h2>
<p>For now I hope at least some people will enjoy playing StarGrid and even if it's not their cup of tea, the game is fully open source, so I hope that can contribute to others making games and applications for this not-so-forgotten platform called Palm OS. </p>

<p>Tesla’s ‘Full Self-Driving Supervised’ expansion is back firing as it exposes its shortcomings. Customers left without promised features are growing discontent and demanding to be compensated.</p>



<p>It’s turning into a multi-billion-dollar iceberg of Tesla’s own making.</p>



<p>In 2016, Tesla proudly announced that all its vehicles produced onward are equipped with “all the hardware for full self-driving,” which would be delivered through future software updates.</p>



<p>The automaker turned out to be significantly wrong about that.</p>	
	



<p>At the time, it was producing its electric vehicles with a hardware suite known as HW2, which it had to upgrade to HW3 because it couldn’t support self-driving (FSD) capability.</p>



<p>HW3 was produced in vehicles from 2019 to 2023 and Tesla switched to HW4 in 2024.</p>



<p>At first, CEO Elon Musk claimed that FSD software updates on newer HW4 cars would lag roughly 6 months behind updates to HW3 cars to make sure to deliver the promised self-driving capability to those who have been waiting and paid for the promised capabiltiy a long time ago.</p>



<p>That s<a href="https://electrek.co/2024/10/15/tesla-needs-to-come-clean-about-hw3-before-the-word-fraud-comes-out/">trategy barely lasted a few months</a>. Tesla quickly started releasing new FSD updates to HW4 cars first and it now hasn’t released a significant update to HW3 cars in close to a year.</p>



<p>Tesla only admitted in January 2025 that HW3 won’t be able to support unsupervised self-driving. Musk claimed that Tesla would retrofit the computers, but there has been no word about it for 10 months.</p>



<h2 id="h-tesla-customers-are-starting-to-be-fed-up">Tesla customers are starting to be fed up.</h2>



<p>The catalyst is Tesla’s current FSD expansion in international markets. Previously, Tesla’s FSD was limited to North America, but over the last year, the automaker has been expanding FSD to China and now Australia and New Zealand.</p>



<p>However, the expansion is back-firing as HW3 owners are starting to realize that they will never get what they paid for.</p>



<p>In Australia and NZ, Tesla only launched FSD on HW4 vehicles with no clear plan for HW3, which the automaker already admitted won’t support unsupervised self-driving. The automaker appears to have only adapted its latest version of FSD for HW4 to the Australian market.</p>



<p>To add to the insult, with the launch of FSD in Australia, Tesla started to offer FSD subcriptions for $149 AUD a month for both HW3 and HW3 cars despite the software not being available for HW3.</p>



<p>HW3 owners reached out to <em>Electrek</em> after seeing this in their app:</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="926" height="922" src="https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-20-at-4.16.58-PM.png" alt="" srcset="https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-20-at-4.16.58-PM.png 926w, https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-20-at-4.16.58-PM.png?resize=150,149 150w, https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-20-at-4.16.58-PM.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-20-at-4.16.58-PM.png?resize=768,765 768w, https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-20-at-4.16.58-PM.png?resize=350,348 350w, https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-20-at-4.16.58-PM.png?resize=140,139 140w, https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-20-at-4.16.58-PM.png?resize=96,96 96w" sizes="(max-width: 926px) 100vw, 926px"></figure>



<p>It’s unclear why would Tesla sell a subcription to something that doesn’t even exist, but it is not helping build confidence with customers.</p>



<p>To try to appease owners, Tesla started sending emails to Australia HW3 owners offering $5,000 discounts on new inventory vehicles when transfering their FSD package:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" height="1024" width="546" src="https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-20-at-4.12.33-PM.png?w=546" alt="" srcset="https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-20-at-4.12.33-PM.png 618w, https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-20-at-4.12.33-PM.png?resize=80,150 80w, https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-20-at-4.12.33-PM.png?resize=160,300 160w, https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-20-at-4.12.33-PM.png?resize=546,1024 546w, https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-20-at-4.12.33-PM.png?resize=187,350 187w, https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-20-at-4.12.33-PM.png?resize=140,262 140w, https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-20-at-4.12.33-PM.png?resize=534,1000 534w, https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-20-at-4.12.33-PM.png?resize=150,281 150w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 546px) 100vw, 546px"></figure>



<p>However, this offer is misleading in itself, as it is not actually specific to HW3 owners as the email leads people to believe.</p>



<p>A visit on Tesla’s Australia inventory website shows that Tesla is offering a $5,000 disounct on all inventory vehicles with FSD for any buyer:</p>

<p>Therefore, it has nothing to do with “loyalty”.</p>



<p>As we recently reported, thousands of Tesla owners have now joined <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/10/13/thousands-of-tesla-owners-join-class-action-lawsuit-over-full-self-driving-in-australia/">a class action lawsuit in Australia</a> over Tesla misleading customers with its self-driving promises.</p>



<p>It adds to similar ongoing lawsuits in <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/08/19/tesla-loses-bid-to-kill-class-action-over-misleading-customers-on-self-driving-capabilities-for-years/">the US</a> and <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/09/22/tesla-being-sued-china-over-not-delivering-self-driving-hw3-cars/">China</a>.</p>



<p>With hundreds of thousands of FSD customers who paid up to $15,000 for package, Tesla is on the hook for billions of dollars in compensations or retrofits in the best-case scenario.</p>



<h2 id="h-electrek-s-take">Electrek’s Take</h2>



<p>We are seeing more people losing patience and it is only going to get worse.</p>



<p>There were a lot of interesting interactions on this post, which is pretty mild in my opinion. And yet, you see the usual Elon lemmings downplaying Tesla not delivering features it promised:</p>

</div></figure>



<p>I don’t want to burst anyone’s bubble, but we need to be realistic here. If you are a HW3 owner and still think that Tesla is going to retrofit your up to 10-years-old car with a computer that is going to make self-driving, you are being delusional.</p>



<p>Tesla will have to end up compensating owners and at this point, I have serious doubts that it will do it by itself without being forced through courts.</p>



<p>Furthermore, it shouldn’t be just people who bought FSD. Tesla said that all cars had the hardware capable of self-driving whether people bought the software package or not. If that’s not true, it affects the resale value of the vehicle regardless of if someone purchased the package.</p>



<p>I have a fairly simple solution for Tesla to make it right.</p>



<p>Tesla needs to offer all HW3 owners a $5,000 loyalty discount, that goes on top of all other incentive program, when upgrading to a new car. </p>




	<p>As for HW3 owners who bought FSD, which basically turned out to be an interest free loan to Tesla for years, the automaker needs to offer free FSD transfer and a $10,000 discount on a car upgrade.</p>



<p>While this might sound like a lot, I think it’s in line with the incredible liability that Tesla is facing from all the on going lawsuits. </p>



<p>On top of it, it will go a long way to regain the trust of long-time customers, which Tesla swindled by selling them features it simply can’t deliver.</p>



<p>The main reason why I think Tesla doesn’t want to do that is that it will likely have to do the same thing to HW4 owners in the next few years and that would be the death of the company.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-headline="Diamond Blankets Will Keep Future Chips Cool"><p><strong>Today’s </strong><strong>stunning computing power</strong> is allowing us to move from human intelligence toward <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/topic/artificial-intelligence/">artificial intelligence</a>. And as our machines gain more power, they’re becoming not just tools but decision-makers shaping our future.</p><p>But with great power comes great…heat!</p><p>As nanometer-scale <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/transistors">transistors</a> switch at gigahertz speeds, electrons race through circuits, losing energy as heat—which you feel when your laptop or your phone toasts your fingers. As we’ve <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/trillion-transistor-gpu" target="_self">crammed more and more transistors onto chips</a>, we’ve lost the room to release that heat efficiently. Instead of the heat spreading out quickly across the silicon, which makes it much easier to remove, it builds up to form hot spots, which can be tens of degrees warmer than the rest of the chip. That extreme heat forces systems to throttle the performance of CPUs and <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/gpus">GPUs</a> to avoid degrading the chips.</p><p>In other words, what began as a quest for miniaturization has turned into a battle against thermal energy. This challenge extends across all electronics. In computing, high-performance <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/processors">processors</a> demand ever-increasing power densities. (New <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/nvidia">Nvidia</a> GPU B300 servers will consume <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/dgx-b300/" target="_blank">nearly 15 kilowatts</a> of power.) In communication, both digital and analog systems push transistors to deliver more power for stronger signals and faster data rates. In the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/power-electronics">power electronics</a> used for energy conversion and distribution, efficiency gains are being countered by thermal constraints.</p><p> <img alt="A thick sheet of gray-scale grains." data-rm-shortcode-id="4095938da35f1f8180986be8c5d070c9" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-thick-sheet-of-gray-scale-grains.png?id=61766971&amp;width=980" height="1609" id="1d15b" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-thick-sheet-of-gray-scale-grains.png?id=61766971&amp;width=980" width="2427"><small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">The ability to grow large-grained <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/polycrystalline">polycrystalline</a> diamond at low temperature led to a new way to combat heat in transistors. </small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Mohamadali Malakoutian</small></p><p>Rather than allowing heat to build up, what if we could spread it out right from the start, inside the chip?—diluting it like a cup of boiling water dropped into a swimming pool. Spreading out the heat would lower the temperature of the most critical devices and circuits and let the other time-tested cooling technologies work more efficiently. To do that, we’d have to introduce a highly thermally conductive material inside the IC, mere nanometers from the transistors, without messing up any of their very precise and sensitive properties. Enter an unexpected material—diamond.</p><p>In some ways, diamond is ideal. It’s one of the most thermally conductive materials on the planet—many times more efficient than copper—yet it’s also electrically insulating. However, integrating it into chips is tricky: Until recently we knew how to grow it only at circuit-slagging temperatures in excess of 1,000 °C.</p><p>But my research group at <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/stanford">Stanford</a> University has managed what seemed impossible. We can now grow a form of diamond suitable for spreading heat, directly atop semiconductor devices at low enough temperatures that even the most delicate <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/interconnects">interconnects</a> inside advanced chips will survive. To be clear, this isn’t the kind of diamond you see in jewelry, which is a large single crystal. Our <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/diamond">diamonds</a> are a polycrystalline coating no more than a couple of micrometers thick.</p><p>The potential benefits could be huge. In some of our earliest gallium-nitride radio-frequency transistors, the addition of diamond dropped the device temperature by more than 50 °C. At the lower temperature, the transistors amplified X-band radio signals five times as well as before. We think our diamond will be even more important for advanced <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/cmos">CMOS</a> chips. Researchers predict that upcoming chipmaking technologies could make hot spots almost 10 °C hotter [see , “<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/hot-chips" target="_self">Future Chips Will Be Hotter Than Ever</a>”, in this issue]. That’s probably why our research is drawing intense interest from the chip industry, including <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/applied-materials">Applied Materials</a>, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/samsung">Samsung</a>, and <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/tsmc">TSMC</a>. If our work continues to succeed as it has, heat will become a far less onerous constraint in CMOS and other electronics too.</p><h2>Where Heat Begins and Ends in Chips</h2><p data-rm-resized-container="25%"> <img alt="A rectangle of black fading into bright gray at the bottom." data-rm-shortcode-id="97669d7d6818879a240fd8be27d98ec0" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-rectangle-of-black-fading-into-bright-gray-at-the-bottom.png?id=61766985&amp;width=980" height="3532" id="d8b96" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-rectangle-of-black-fading-into-bright-gray-at-the-bottom.png?id=61766985&amp;width=980" width="1646"><small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">At the boundary between the diamond and the semiconductor, a thin layer of <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/silicon-carbide">silicon carbide</a> forms. It acts as a bridge for heat to flow into the diamond. </small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Mohamadali Malakoutian</small></p><p>Heat starts within transistors and the interconnects that link them, as the flow of current meets resistance. That means most of it is generated near the surface of the semiconductor substrate. From there it rises either through layers of metal and insulation or through the semiconductor itself, depending on the package architecture. The heat then encounters a thermal interface material designed to spread it out before it ultimately reaches a <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/heat-sink">heat sink</a>, a radiator, or some sort of <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/data-center-liquid-cooling" target="_blank">liquid cooling</a>, where air or fluid carries the heat away.</p><p>The dominant cooling strategies today center around advances in <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/heat-sinks">heat sinks</a>, fans, and radiators. In pursuit of even better cooling, researchers have explored liquid cooling using microfluidic channels and removing heat using phase-change materials. Some computer clusters go so far as to submerge the servers in thermally conductive, dielectric—electrically insulating—liquids.</p><p>These innovations are critical steps forward, but they still have limitations. Some are so expensive they’re worthwhile only for the highest-performing chips; others are simply too bulky for the job. (Your smartphone can’t carry a <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/xmems" target="_self">conventional fan</a>.) And none are likely to be very effective as we move toward chip architectures resembling silicon skyscrapers that stack multiple layers of chips. Such <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/hybrid-bonding" target="_self">3D systems</a> are only as viable as our ability to remove heat from every layer within it.</p><p>The big problem is that chip materials are poor heat conductors, so the heat becomes trapped and concentrated, causing the temperature to skyrocket within the chip. At higher temperatures, transistors leak more current, wasting power; they age more quickly, too.</p><p>Heat spreaders allow the heat to move laterally, diluting it and allowing the circuits to cool. But they’re positioned far—relatively, of course—from where the heat is generated, and so they’re of little help with these hot spots. We need a heat-spreading technology that can exist within nanometers of where the heat is generated. This is where our new low-temperature diamond could be essential.</p><h2>How to Make Diamonds</h2><p>Before my lab turned to developing diamond as a heat-spreading material, we were working on it as a semiconductor. In its single-crystal form—like the kind on your finger—it has a <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/wide-bandgap">wide bandgap</a> and ability to withstand enormous electric fields. Single-crystalline diamond also offers some of the highest thermal conductivity recorded in any material, reaching 2,200 to 2,400 watts per meter per kelvin—roughly six times as conductive as copper. Polycrystalline diamond—an easier to make material—can approach these values when grown thick. Even in this form, it outperforms copper.</p><p>As attractive as diamond transistors might be, I was keenly aware—based on my experience researching <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/gallium-nitride">gallium nitride</a> devices—of the long road ahead. The problem is one of scale. Several companies are working to scale high-purity diamond substrates to 50, 75, and even 100 millimeters but the diamond substrates we could acquire commercially were only about 3 mm across.</p><p> <img alt="A polygon with layers demarcated in it surrounded by a jagged blue area.

The devices are 3D and the critical heat-generating part, the two-dimensional <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/electron-gas">electron gas</a>, is close to the surface. </small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Chris Philpot</small></p><p>So we decided instead to try growing diamond films on large silicon wafers, in the hope of moving toward commercial-scale diamond substrates. In general, this is done by reacting methane and hydrogen at high temperatures, 900 °C or more. This results in not a single crystal but a forest of narrow columns. As they grow taller, the nanocolumns coalesce into a uniform film, but by the time they form high-quality polycrystalline diamond, the film is already very thick. This thick growth adds stress to the material and often leads to cracking and other problems.</p><p>But what if we used this polycrystalline coating as a heat spreader for other devices? If we could get diamond to grow within nanometers of transistors, get it to spread heat both vertically and laterally, and integrate it seamlessly with the silicon, metal, and <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/dielectric">dielectric</a> in chips, it might do the job.</p><p>There were good reasons to think it would work. Diamond is electrically insulating, and it has a relatively low dielectric constant. That means it makes a poor capacitor, so signals sent through diamond-encrusted interconnects might not degrade much. Thus diamond could act as a “thermal dielectric,” one that is electrically insulating but thermally conducting.</p><p> <img alt="SEM images showing surface before and after polycrystalline diamond growth on silicon oxide." data-rm-shortcode-id="d13cce8207e028b3de6559e6ff93e683" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/sem-images-showing-surface-before-and-after-polycrystalline-diamond-growth-on-silicon-oxide.png?id=61771368&amp;width=980" height="1980" id="94099" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/sem-images-showing-surface-before-and-after-polycrystalline-diamond-growth-on-silicon-oxide.png?id=61771368&amp;width=980" width="2280"><small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">Polycrystalline diamond could help reduce temperatures inside <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/3d-integration">3D chips</a>. Diamond thermal vias would grow inside micrometers-deep holes so heat can flow from vertically from one chip to a diamond heat spreader in another chip that’s stacked atop it.  </small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Dennis Rich</small></p><p>For our plan to work, we were going to have to learn to grow diamond differently. We knew there wasn’t room to grow a thick film inside a chip. We also knew the narrow, spiky crystal pillars made in the first part of the growth process don’t transmit heat laterally very well, so we’d need to grow large-grained crystals from the start to get the heat moving horizontally. A third problem was that the existing diamond films didn’t form a coating on the sides of devices, which would be important for inherently <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/3d-devices">3D devices</a>. But the biggest impediment was the high temperature needed to grow the diamond film, which would damage, if not destroy, an IC’s circuits. We were going to have to cut the growth temperature at least in half.</p><p>Just lowering the temperature doesn’t work. (We tried: You wind up, basically, with soot, which is electrically conductive—the opposite of what’s needed.) We found that adding oxygen to the mix helped, because it continuously etched away carbon deposits that weren’t diamond. And through <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4352/9/10/498" target="_blank">extensive experimentation</a>, we were able to find a formula that produced coatings of large-grained polycrystalline diamond all around devices at 400 °C, which is a survivable temperature for CMOS circuits and other devices.</p><h2>Thermal Boundary Resistance</h2><p>Although we had found a way to grow the right kind of diamond coatings, we faced another critical challenge—the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/phonon">phonon</a> bottleneck, also known as thermal boundary resistance (TBR). <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/phonons">Phonons</a> are packets of heat energy, in the way that photons are packets of electromagnetic energy. Specifically, they’re a quantized version of the vibration of a crystal lattice. These phonons can pile up at the boundary between materials, resisting the flow of heat. Reducing TBR has long been a goal in thermal interface engineering, and it is often done by introducing different materials at the boundary. But semiconductors are compatible only with certain materials, limiting our choices.</p><p data-rm-resized-container="25%"> <img alt="A cartoon of squares stacked atop one another and connected by a forest of vertical links.

While growing diamond on GaN capped with silicon nitride, we observed something unexpected: The measured TBR was <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acsami.1c13833" target="_blank">much lower than prior reports led us to expect</a>. (The low TBR was independently measured, initially by <a href="https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/persons/martin-h-h-kuball" target="_blank">Martin Kuball</a> at the University of Bristol, in England, and later by <a href="https://me.umd.edu/clark/faculty/1618/Samuel-GrahamJr" target="_blank">Samuel Graham Jr</a>., then at <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/georgia-tech">Georgia Tech</a>, who both have been coauthors and collaborators in several of our papers.)</p><p>Through further investigation of the interface science and engineering, and in collaboration with <a href="https://mse.utdallas.edu/ourteam/faculty/cho-k/" target="_blank">K.J. Cho</a> at the University of Texas at Dallas, we identified the cause of the lower TBR. <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10413734" target="_blank">Intermixing at the interface</a> between the diamond and silicon nitride led to the formation of silicon carbide, which acted as a kind of bridge for the phonons, allowing more efficient heat transfer. Though this began as a scientific discovery, its technological impact was immediate—with a silicon carbide interface, our devices exhibited significantly improved thermal performance.</p><h2>GaN HEMTs: The First Test Case</h2><p>We began testing our new low-TBR diamond coatings in gallium nitride high-electron-mobility transistors (HEMTs). These devices amplify RF signals by controlling current through a two-dimensional electron gas that forms within its channel. We leveraged the pioneering research on HEMTs done by <a href="https://engineering.ucsb.edu/people/umesh-mishra" target="_blank">Umesh Mishra</a>’s laboratory at the University of California, Santa Barbara, where I had been a graduate student. The Mishra lab invented a particular form of the material called N-polar gallium nitride. Their N-polar GaN HEMTs demonstrate exceptional power density at high frequencies, particularly in the W-band, the 75- to 110-gigahertz part of the microwave spectrum.</p><p>RELATED: <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/silicon-carbide" target="_self">Gallium Nitride and Silicon Carbide Fight for Green Tech Domination</a></p><p>What made these HEMTs such a good test case is one defining feature of the device: The gate, which controls the flow of current through the device, is within tens of nanometers of the transistor’s channel. That means that heat is generated very close to the surface of the device, and any interference our diamond coating could cause would quickly show in the device’s operation.</p><p>We introduced the diamond layer so that it surrounded the HEMT completely, even on the sides. By maintaining a growth temperature below 400 °C, we hoped to preserve core device functionality. While we did see some decline in high-frequency performance, the thermal benefits were substantial—<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10019509" target="_blank">channel temperatures dropped by a remarkable 70 °C</a>. This breakthrough could be a potentially transformative solution for RF systems, allowing them to operate at higher power than ever before.</p><h2>Diamond in CMOS</h2><p>We wondered if our diamond layer could also work in high-power CMOS chips. My colleagues at Stanford, <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~hspwong/" target="_blank">H.-S. Philip Wong</a> and <a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/subhasish-mitra" target="_blank">Subhasish Mitra</a>, have long championed 3D-stacked chip architectures. In CMOS computing chips, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/3d-stacking">3D stacking</a> appears to be the most viable way forward to increase integration density, improve performance, and overcome the limitations of traditional <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/transistor-scaling">transistor scaling</a>. It’s already used in some advanced <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/ai-chips">AI chips</a>, such as <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/amd-mi300" target="_self">AMD’s MI300 series</a>. And it’s established in the high-bandwidth memory chips that pump data through Nvidia GPUs and other AI processors. The multiple layers of silicon in these 3D stacks are mostly connected by microscopic balls of solder, or in some advanced cases just by their copper terminals. Getting signals and power out of these stacks requires vertical copper links that burrow through the silicon to reach the chip package’s substrate.</p><p>In one of our discussions, Mitra pointed out that a critical issue with 3D-stacked chips is the thermal bottlenecks that form within the stack. In 3D architectures, the traditional heat sinks and other techniques used for 2D chips aren’t sufficient. Extracting heat from each layer is essential.</p><p>Our research could redefine <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/thermal-management">thermal management</a> across industries.</p><p>Our experiments on thermal boundary resistance in GaN suggested a similar approach would work in silicon. And when we integrated diamond with silicon, the results were remarkable: An interlayer of silicon carbide formed, leading to diamond with an excellent thermal interface.</p><p>Our effort introduced the concept of thermal scaffolding. In that scheme, nanometers-thick layers of polycrystalline diamond would be integrated within the dielectric layers above the transistors to spread heat. These layers would then be connected by vertical heat conductors, called thermal pillars, made of copper or more diamond. These pillars would connect to another heat spreader, which in turn would link to thermal pillars on the next chip in the 3D stack, and so on until the heat reached the heat sink or other cooling device.</p><p> <img alt="Temperature vs. compute tier graph; AI accelerator heats most without scaffold." data-rm-shortcode-id="f142bfc12529f56435398ad67060129f" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/temperature-vs-compute-tier-graph-ai-accelerator-heats-most-without-scaffold.png?id=61771384&amp;width=980" height="1465" id="8310e" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/temperature-vs-compute-tier-graph-ai-accelerator-heats-most-without-scaffold.png?id=61771384&amp;width=980" width="2380"><small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">The more tiers of computing silicon in a 3D chip, the bigger difference thermal scaffolding makes.

This structure consisted of dummy heaters to mimic hot spots in a two-chip stack along with diamond heat spreaders and copper thermal pillars. Using this, we <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10873424" target="_blank">reduced the temperature to one-tenth</a> its value without the scaffolding.</p><p>There are hurdles still to overcome. In particular, we still have to figure out a way to make the top of our diamond coatings atomically flat. But, in collaboration with industry partners and researchers, we are systematically studying that problem and other scientific and technological issues. We and our partners think this research could offer a disruptive new path for thermal management and a crucial step toward sustaining <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/high-performance-computing">high-performance computing</a> into the future.</p><h2>Developing Diamond Thermal Solutions</h2><p>We now intend to move toward industry integration. For example, we’re working with the <a href="https://www.darpa.mil/research/programs/threads-heat-removal" target="_blank">Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Threads</a> program, which aims to use device-level thermal management to develop highly efficient and reliable X-band power amplifiers with a power density 6 to 8 times as efficient as today’s devices. The program, which was conceived and initially run by <a href="https://forward.darpa.mil/presenters/Dr-Thomas-Kazior" target="_blank">Tom Kazior</a>, is a critical platform for validating the use of low-temperature diamond integration in GaN HEMT manufacturing. It’s enabled us to collaborate closely with industry teams while protecting both our and our partners’ processes. Defense applications demand exceptional reliability, and our diamond-integrated HEMTs are undergoing rigorous testing with industry partners. The early results are promising, guiding refinements in growth processes and integration techniques that we’ll make with our partners over the next two years.</p><p>But our vision extends beyond GaN HEMTs to <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.35848/1882-0786/abf4f1" target="_blank">other materials</a> and particularly silicon computational chips. For the latter, we have an established collaboration with TSMC, and we’re expanding on newer opportunities with Applied Materials, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/micron">Micron</a>, Samsung, and others through the <a href="https://systemx.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">Stanford SystemX Alliance</a> and the <a href="https://www.src.org/" target="_blank">Semiconductor Research Corp.</a> This is an extraordinary level of collaboration among otherwise fierce competitors. But then, heat is a universal challenge in <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/chip-manufacturing">chip manufacturing</a>, and everyone is motivated to find the best solutions.</p><p>If successful, our research could redefine thermal management across industries. In my work on gallium nitride devices, I have seen firsthand how once-radical ideas like this transition to become industry standards, and I believe diamond-based heat extraction will follow the same trajectory, becoming a critical enabler for a generation of electronics that is no longer hindered by heat. <span></span></p><p><em>This article appears in the November 2025 print issue as “Diamond Blankets Will Chill Future Chips.”</em></p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text"><p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/pleumann/pasta80/blob/master/docs/images/logo.png"><img src="https://github.com/pleumann/pasta80/raw/master/docs/images/logo.png" alt="Logo"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">PASTA/80</h2><a id="user-content-pasta80" aria-label="Permalink: PASTA/80" href="#pasta80"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">PASTA/80 is a simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language)" rel="nofollow">Pascal</a> cross compiler targeting the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zilog_Z80" rel="nofollow">Z80</a> microprocessor. It generates code for these classic and modern machines:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CP/M" rel="nofollow">CP/M</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinclair_ZX_Spectrum" rel="nofollow">ZX Spectrum 48K</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum#ZX_Spectrum_128" rel="nofollow">ZX Spectrum 128K</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.specnext.com/" rel="nofollow">ZX Spectrum Next</a></li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">The compiler follows the single-pass recursive-descent approach championed by <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklaus_Wirth" rel="nofollow">Niklaus Wirth</a>, inventor of Pascal, in his books and lectures. It doesn't have an explicit syntax tree, but instead generates code on the fly during parsing. As a result, the compiler might not always generate the most efficient code possible (it definitely cannot compete with LLVM and doesn't try to), but it's very fast.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Supported language elements</h2><a id="user-content-supported-language-elements" aria-label="Permalink: Supported language elements" href="#supported-language-elements"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The supported Pascal dialect is an almost exact clone of the original <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Pascal" rel="nofollow">Turbo Pascal 3.0</a> for CP/M (see <a href="https://bitsavers.trailing-edge.com/pdf/borland/turbo_pascal/Turbo_Pascal_Version_3.0_Reference_Manual_1986.pdf" rel="nofollow">this manual</a> for details). So you have at your disposal the following language elements:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>All the basic data types (<code>Boolean</code>, <code>Byte</code>, <code>Char</code>, <code>Integer</code>, <code>Pointer</code>, <code>Real</code> and <code>String</code>).</li>
<li><code>array of</code>, <code>record</code>, <code>set of</code>, enumerations, subranges and pointers as a way of building new data types.</li>
<li>The decision-making elements <code>if..then..else</code> and <code>case..of</code>.</li>
<li>The loop elements <code>for..do</code>, <code>while..do</code> and <code>repeat..until</code>.</li>
<li>The <code>with..do</code> notation for "opening" records.</li>
<li><code>procedure</code> and <code>function</code> including value and <code>var</code> parameters and nesting.</li>
<li>The standard procedures for screen input and output (i.e. <code>ReadLn</code>, <code>WriteLn</code> etc.).</li>
<li>All conversion and utility procedures and functions that Turbo Pascal 3.0 had.</li>
<li>The three kinds of disk files, that is untyped (<code>file</code>), typed (<code>file of</code>) and <code>Text</code>.</li>
<li>A dynamic heap of up to 32767 bytes with <code>GetMem</code>, <code>FreeMem</code>, <code>New</code> and <code>Dispose</code>.</li>
<li>Inline assembly (via opcodes, not via mnemonics, so <a href="https://clrhome.org/table/" rel="nofollow">this page</a> might be handy).</li>
<li>Overlays (in memory, Spectrum 128K and Next only, see below).</li>
<li>Some compiler directives:
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>$i &lt;file&gt;</code> for including Pascal source files (including nesting and cycle detection)</li>
<li><code>$l &lt;file&gt;</code> for including an assembly file (aka "linking" a library)</li>
<li><code>$a(+/-)</code>   for enabling or disabling absolute mode (default is on, disable for recursion)</li>
<li><code>$i(+/-)</code>   for enabling or disabling IO checking (when off, check <code>IOResult</code> after calls)</li>
<li><code>$k(+/-)</code>   for enabling or disabling stack overflow checking</li>
<li><code>$u(+/-)</code>   for enabling or disabling Ctrl-C checking</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">The compiler also has some features that were borrowed from or inspired by later versions of Turbo Pascal:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>C-style <code>//</code> one-line comments in addition to <code>{..}</code> and <code>(*..*)</code>.</li>
<li>Binary literals (using a <code>%</code> prefix).</li>
<li><code>Break</code> and <code>Continue</code> for loop control.</li>
<li>Querying the keyboard via <code>KeyPressed</code> and <code>ReadKey</code>.</li>
<li>Color support via <code>TextColor</code> and <code>TextBackground</code> with constants for the 8 Spectrum Next colors.</li>
<li><code>Inc</code> and <code>Dec</code> for more efficient increasing and decreasing of variables.</li>
<li><code>Include</code> and <code>Exclude</code> for more efficient handling of sets.</li>
<li>A simple <code>Assert</code> facility that counts passes/fails and shows the failed line number.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Since that covers most of the functionality of Turbo Pascal 3 you might ask what is missing. These are the current limitations:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>All the remaining compiler directives are not yet supported.</li>
<li><code>Mark</code>/<code>Release</code> are not currently supported.</li>
<li>The standard files <code>Input</code>, <code>Output</code>, <code>Kbd</code>, <code>Con</code> and <code>Lst</code> are not supported.</li>
<li><code>Chain</code> and <code>Execute</code> are not supported.</li>
<li>Add-on libraries from the PC version of Turbo Pascal 3.0 are not yet supported (although there are a few graphics primitives for the ZX targets).</li>
<li>The <a href="https://wiki.specnext.dev/Extended_Z80_instruction_set" rel="nofollow">new instructions of the Z80N CPU</a> inside the ZX Spectrum Next are not yet being leveraged.</li>
<li>No separate compilation. Everything is compiled from source, always.</li>
<li>Binary size is quite large compared to the original.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">The runtime library, being partially written in Pascal itself, gets quite large when compiled. I hope to bring this down again by reimplementing more of it in Z80 assembly (or improve the code generator, which, although it has a peephole optimizer, is not generating super-efficient Z80 code).</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Building and setting up the compiler</h2><a id="user-content-building-and-setting-up-the-compiler" aria-label="Permalink: Building and setting up the compiler" href="#building-and-setting-up-the-compiler"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The compiler is itself written in Pascal. You can compile it with <a href="https://www.freepascal.org/" rel="nofollow">Free Pascal</a> (I use version 3.2.2). Just run</p>

<p dir="auto">The Pascal compiler generates Z80 assembler code and relies on <a href="https://z00m128.github.io/sjasmplus" rel="nofollow">sjasmplus</a> as a backend for the final translation step to binary. It can also, in <code>--ide</code> mode (see below), make use of various other external tools. The compiler tries to detect these external tools automatically (from your system's <code>PATH</code>), but sometimes it's best to create a file <code>.pasta80.cfg</code> in your home directory specifying necessary paths (there is a sample in <code>misc</code> that you can adapt).</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="# PASTA/80 config

HOME      = ~/Spectrum/pasta80
ASSEMBLER = ~/Spectrum/sjasmplus/sjasmplus
..."><pre><code># PASTA/80 config

HOME      = ~/Spectrum/pasta80
ASSEMBLER = ~/Spectrum/sjasmplus/sjasmplus
...
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">You can check your whole setup by calling the compiler with <code>--config</code>. It will show the full paths of all internal and external requirements and whether they are fulfilled.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Using the compiler</h2><a id="user-content-using-the-compiler" aria-label="Permalink: Using the compiler" href="#using-the-compiler"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">To run the compiler just invoke the executable with the name of a Pascal source file to translate.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">CP/M target</h3><a id="user-content-cpm-target" aria-label="Permalink: CP/M target" href="#cpm-target"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The default target is CP/M. There is an optional parameter that enables some simple peephole optimizations and another one that uses dependency analysis to eliminate unused Pascal procedures and functions:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ pasta hello.pas             # Compiles hello.pas to hello.com
$ pasta hello                 # Source file .pas suffix is optional
$ pasta --opt hello.pas       # Enables peephole optimizations
$ pasta --opt --dep hello.pas # The same plus dependency analysis"><pre>$ pasta hello.pas             <span><span>#</span> Compiles hello.pas to hello.com</span>
$ pasta hello                 <span><span>#</span> Source file .pas suffix is optional</span>
$ pasta --opt hello.pas       <span><span>#</span> Enables peephole optimizations</span>
$ pasta --opt --dep hello.pas <span><span>#</span> The same plus dependency analysis</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">You can run the resulting <code>.com</code> files on a real CP/M machine or in a CP/M emulator. I recommend the excellent <a href="https://gitlab.com/gbrein/tnylpo" rel="nofollow">tnylpo</a>. For programs that use VT52 control codes you have to start tnylpo in full-screen mode:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ tnylpo hello                # Run in line-mode
$ tnylpo -s -t @ hello        # Monochrome full-screen, wait when finished

<p dir="auto">To generate binaries for the ZX Spectrum 48K, 128K and Next targets, use the <code>--zx48</code>, <code>--zx128</code> and <code>--zxnext</code> parameters, respectively.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ pasta --zx48 hello.pas      # Compiles for ZX Spectrum 48K
$ pasta --zx128 hello.pas     # Compiles for ZX Spectrum 48K
$ pasta --zxnext hello.pas    # Compiles for ZX Spectrum Next"><pre>$ pasta --zx48 hello.pas      <span><span>#</span> Compiles for ZX Spectrum 48K</span>
$ pasta --zx128 hello.pas     <span><span>#</span> Compiles for ZX Spectrum 48K</span>
$ pasta --zxnext hello.pas    <span><span>#</span> Compiles for ZX Spectrum Next</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">The main difference between the three (currently) is that the ZX Spectrum Next target supports file IO (on the SD card), while the other two do not. The remaining routines are mostly the same. Screen output is handled via <code>rst $10</code> in the ROM. In both cases the binaries are expected to be run from address 0x8000.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Tapes, snapshots and runnable directories</h3><a id="user-content-tapes-snapshots-and-runnable-directories" aria-label="Permalink: Tapes, snapshots and runnable directories" href="#tapes-snapshots-and-runnable-directories"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The default output format for the ZX Spectrum targets is a simple binary file that contains exactly the bytes of the compiled program (plus a +3DOS header when compiling for the Spectrum Next). In addition to that (and for more complex cases involving overlays), the compiler can also generate snapshot files or tape files, the latter including a suitable BASIC loader:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ pasta --zx48 --sna examples/hello.pas   # .sna file
$ pasta --zx48 --tap examples/jacques.pas # .tap file with BASIC loader"><pre>$ pasta --zx48 --sna examples/hello.pas   <span><span>#</span> .sna file</span>
$ pasta --zx48 --tap examples/jacques.pas <span><span>#</span> .tap file with BASIC loader</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Being self-contained, snapshots and tapes are a convenient way to distribute your programs and to launch them an emulator, such as Fuse:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ open -a Fuse examples/hello.sna         # Launch .sna file in FUSE (on Mac)
$ open -a Fuse examples/jacques.tap       # Launch .tap file in FUSE (on Mac)"><pre>$ open -a Fuse examples/hello.sna         <span><span>#</span> Launch .sna file in FUSE (on Mac)</span>
$ open -a Fuse examples/jacques.tap       <span><span>#</span> Launch .tap file in FUSE (on Mac)</span></pre></div>

</table></markdown-accessiblity-table>
<p dir="auto">When compiling for the Next, another useful format is a runnable directory. It contains exactly the same files that would also be in the .tap file, including a BASIC loader named <code>run.bas</code>.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ pasta --zxnext --run examples/pq.pas    # Results in directory named pq.run"><pre>$ pasta --zxnext --run examples/pq.pas    <span><span>#</span> Results in directory named pq.run</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">The directory has the suffix <code>.run</code>. When attempting to enter such a directory in the Next's file browser, the loader is started automatically (press Symbol Shift + Enter to really see the contents). If you are a Mac user: Yes, it's a bit like an <code>.app</code> bundle.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Overlays</h3><a id="user-content-overlays" aria-label="Permalink: Overlays" href="#overlays"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The Spectrum 128K and Next targets support overlays. This means you can have larger programs than would normally fit into the 64K address space of a Z80 machine. The rules are the same as for Turbo Pascal 3.0:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Overlays can be applied to global procedures and functions only, not to nested ones (though nested ones will be overlayed if the containing ones are, too).</li>
<li>Overlays cannot be applied to global variables, that is, you cannot use them for data (at least not without tricks).</li>
<li>All consecutive procedures and functions that are marked as <code>overlay</code> go into the same overlay. Use any declaration inbetween to separate overlays.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">In the following example, there are three overlays: Overlay 0 contains A and B, overlay 1 contains D, and overlay 2 contains E.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="overlay procedure A; (* Overlay 0 *)
begin
end;

overlay procedure B; (* Overlay 0 *)
begin
end;

procedure C; (* Not in an overlay *)
begin
end;

overlay procedure D; (* Overlay 1 *)
begin
end;

type
  Dummy = Integer;   (* Separator *)

overlay procedure E; (* Overlay 2 *)
begin
end;"><pre>overlay <span>procedure</span> <span>A</span>; <span><span>(*</span> Overlay 0 <span>*)</span></span>
<span>begin</span>
<span>end</span>;

overlay <span>procedure</span> <span>B</span>; <span><span>(*</span> Overlay 0 <span>*)</span></span>
<span>begin</span>
<span>end</span>;

<span>procedure</span> <span>C</span>; <span><span>(*</span> Not in an overlay <span>*)</span></span>
<span>begin</span>
<span>end</span>;

overlay <span>procedure</span> <span>D</span>; <span><span>(*</span> Overlay 1 <span>*)</span></span>
<span>begin</span>
<span>end</span>;

<span>type</span>
  Dummy = Integer;   <span><span>(*</span> Separator <span>*)</span></span>

overlay <span>procedure</span> <span>E</span>; <span><span>(*</span> Overlay 2 <span>*)</span></span>
<span>begin</span>
<span>end</span>;</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">In contrast to Turbo Pascal 3.0, overlays are not implemented via disk files. Instead, they use the additional RAM of the Spectrum 128K and Next machines. The uppermost 16K bank (Spectrum 128K) or 8K page (Spectrum Next) will be reserved for overlays. Each overlay can have a maximum size of 8K. The compiler manages everything and generates special "far calls" whenever necessary.</p>
<p dir="auto">To enable overlays, use the <code>--ovr</code> command line parameter, ideally in conjuncton with the <code>--tap</code> parameter, as the tape loaders for 128K and Next are fully overlay-aware.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ pasta --zx128 --tap --opt --dep --ovr tests/all.pas # Test suite as 128K tape"><pre>$ pasta --zx128 --tap --opt --dep --ovr tests/all.pas <span><span>#</span> Test suite as 128K tape</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">The compiler prints a report of which overlays go into which RAM banks or pages.</p>

<p dir="auto">Without the <code>--ovr</code> parameter, overlay markers are simply ignored. This means you can use the same source code for platforms that do support overlays and for those that don't.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Caution</strong>: Overlays somewhat break the safety of the Pascal language. Be careful when using pointers or <code>var</code> parameters for passing data between overlays. The memory you refer to may have just been paged out! It might make sense to compile your overlays with <code>{$a-}</code>, so that all local variables are stored on the stack (which is always visible).</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Examples and tests</h2><a id="user-content-examples-and-tests" aria-label="Permalink: Examples and tests" href="#examples-and-tests"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">There is a folder containing <code>examples</code> and a folder containing <code>tests</code> for the compiler. The main test suite <code>all.pas</code> needs to be compiled with <code>--opt --dep</code> because of its size. Otherwise it won't fit into 64K. The Spectrum 128K and Next targets can (only) handle it using overlays, the Spectrum 48K target can't. Both the examples and the tests should give you a pretty good overview of what the compiler can do.</p>
<p dir="auto">I also solved all puzzles of <a href="https://github.com/pleumann/aoc22">Advent of Code 2022</a> with an earlier version of the compiler and made <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcjDDXgGeSQ6E3NLeSOH0Tn7UorYBgUOH&amp;si=SAoOqUbi70c4ezgi" rel="nofollow">YouTube videos</a> of the solutions running on the ZX Spectrum Next, in CP/M mode.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>One of the big ambitions for the search engine this year has been to enable searching in more languages than English, and a pilot project for this has just been completed, allowing experimental support for German, French and Swedish.</p><p>These changes are now live for testing, but with an extremely small corpus of documents.</p><p>As the search engine has been up to this point built with English in mind, some anglo-centric assumptions made it into its code. A lot of the research on search engines generally seems to embed similar assumptions.</p><p>As this is a domain rife with unknown unknowns, the ambition for this pilot was to implement support for just a few additional languages in order to get a feel for how much work would be required to support more languages in general, as well as to assess how much the index grows when this is done.</p><p>Though it was fully understood upfront that supporting <em>all</em> languages in one go is unrealistic, as some languages are more different than others and require significant additional work. Human language is surprisingly disparate.</p><p>A language like Japanese, for example, has not only multiple alphabets, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halfwidth_and_fullwidth_forms">embeds character width in unicode</a>; on top of that the language doesn’t put spaces between words. As such the language requires special normalization.</p><p>Latin, on the other hand, has <a href="https://dcc.dickinson.edu/grammar/latin/1st-and-2nd-declension-adjectives-%C4%81-o-stems">dozens</a> <a href="https://dcc.dickinson.edu/grammar/latin/2nd-declension-stem-paradigm-and-gender">of</a> <a href="https://dcc.dickinson.edu/grammar/latin/1st-conjugation">forms</a> for each word, and the words can often be reordered without significantly changing the meaning of a sentence. On the one hand this makes the grammatical analysis of the language somewhat easier since the words announce their function in the sentence fairly unambiguously, but on the other you probably need to store the text in a lemmatized form, and then strongly de-prioritize word order when matching.</p><p>Google’s bungled handling of Russian was supposedly why Yandex was able to eke out a foothold in that market.</p><h2 id="what-needs-changing">What needs changing</h2><p>The search engine’s language processing chain is fairly long, but the most salient parts go something like this:</p><ul><li>Text is extracted from the HTML</li><li>Language is identified using fasttext</li><li>Text is broken into sentences</li><li>Words are lowercased and Unicode is normalized</li><li>Sentences are stemmed and POS-tagged</li><li>Sentences, with stemming and POS-tag data is fed into keyword extraction algorithms<ul><li>Keywords are mapped to positions and HTML tags</li><li>Important keywords are identified using TF-IDF (using stemmed forms)</li><li>Important keywords are identified using grammar patterns (POS-tags)</li><li>Important keywords are identified using other heuristics</li></ul></li><li>Keywords are hashed</li></ul><p>Stemming is an imperfect way of getting a base form of a word, though generally such algorithms have a great number of flaws, so that e.g. universe and university seem to be the same word. This is only used in tf-idf calculations.</p><p>Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging is a grammatical annotation process where the role of each word is as best possible identified. This helps identify named entities, subjects, and so on.</p><p>Both of these processes needless to say require some awareness of the language being acted upon.</p><p>These “important keywords” are used to assign documents to a special index that helps with recall by ensuring these documents are included in the set that is ranked before the execution timer runs out. This is not strictly necessary, and in some cases such as where POS-tagging is not possible, can be disabled, partially or as a whole.</p><p>The normalization step is subject to cultural differences that do not translate. In English you’d probably expect to find the metal band Tröjan, typing “trojan”. In Swedish these are different letters entirely that should not match, the former means “the shirt”, the latter “trojan” in the Homeric or IT-security sense. Though a Swedish person would likely also say that they should be able to find mü(e)sli with the keyword “musli”, but a German-speaker would disagree and say that u and ü are clearly not the same.</p><p>There also exists a bootstrapping problem, as the statistical model used to calculate TF-IDF is based on documents in the index. Since almost all of the documents in the index up until this point have been in English, term frequencies for the newly added languages are missing. This breaks TF-IDF, as used in identifying important keywords, until a new model can be constructed. Thankfully the BM-25 model used in ranking is robust to this, as it relies on live data from the index itself.</p><p>The basic approach to parametrize language handling selected was to inject a language definition object, from which language appropriate logic is accessible.</p><p>This is configurable <a href="https://github.com/MarginaliaSearch/MarginaliaSearch/blob/master/code/functions/language-processing/resources/languages-experimental.xml">via XML</a>. Here XML was chosen because it arguably has the best built-in validation support, making it a fantastic use case for a self-contained configuration file like this one, where late validation would be very annoying to deal with.</p><p>Much of the configuration file consists of various grammatical patterns used to identify important keywords based on the role of a word in a sentence.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="xml"><span><span><span>&lt;ngrams</span> <span>type=</span><span>"noun"</span><span>&gt;</span>

A bit mask approach was selected, as it allows for some very basic bit-level concurrency that drastically reduces the number of branches needed.</p><p>As far as grammatical analysis goes, the approach used by the search engine is pretty medieval, but it does do a fairly good job at what it sets out to do, and as a result, one thing it is generally pretty good at is finding websites about some topic.</p><p>In some ways the imperfections introduced by the old-fashioned way of approaching language processing is almost helpful in bringing in more relevant results, as they tend to capture more variations of the words related to the topic of the document.</p><p>There are more places that need minor language dependent behavior changes that are glossed over here, both in the language processing pipeline discussed above, and in the query parser, though in the interest of keeping this update from becoming an overly verbose git diff, these will be glossed over.</p><h3 id="tooling">Tooling</h3><p>To help make sense of this, a test tool was built that runs the language processing pipeline in isolation, and outputs annotated intermediate results for human inspection.</p><figure><a href="https://www.marginalia.nu/log/a_126_multilingual/tool.png"><img src="https://www.marginalia.nu/log/a_126_multilingual/tool.png"></a><figcaption>Language Processing Tool illustrating some problems with keyword identification when run on a very short sample of text.</figcaption></figure><p>Work in this domain poses special problems that all but demand human testing. Machine testing can be good for catching regressions or getting access to some code for easier debugging, but natural language has so many nuances that any test suite is woefully inadequate compared to a pair of human eyeballs.</p><p>It has already helped refine the algorithms used to identify important keywords in English, which wasn’t the intent of building the tool, but its immediate consequence.</p><h2 id="integration">Integration</h2><p>Integrating the new multi-language search data into the system poses some design considerations.</p><p>One option would be to stick everything in one big index, and then filter results based on language during or after ranking. The strength of this is that it becomes possible to search in any language without specifying it upfront.</p><p>The drawbacks of the one-index approach is that it grows the index, which makes all queries slower; it also grows the number of keywords in the lexicon, which is something that we generally want to avoid.</p><p>The way the search engine handles mapping keywords to numeric ids is to use a hash algorithm. Not a hash table, but the output of the hash algorithm itself. This seems absolutely unhinged at first glance, but works remarkably well as long as the lexicon stays small enough.</p><p>Hash collisions do happen on rare occasions, but they need to happen between words where the words actually appear in the same documents to be a problem, generally leading to the ranking algorithm having to trudge through irrelevant documents and performing worse as a result of wasting its time budget.</p><p>Massively expanding the lexicon like we would if we were to mingle the documents increases the likelihood there will be an actual problem arising from these rare false positives.</p><p>If we stick every keyword from every language in the same index, a different problem arises, namely that homophones exist across different languages, meaning that the index lookup needs to wade through irrelevant documents that are trivially unrelated to the query.</p><p>The words <code>salt</code> and <code>lag</code>, if they appear in the same document in English likely selects documents relating to esports, whereas in Swedish they select for documents relating to food preservation.</p><p>The alternative option is to separate the indexes.</p><p>The drawback here is that you must specify the language upfront, and querying in all languages becomes very expensive, as it executing multiple queries, though the desired language of the search results are generally known beforehand so this is a relatively small concern that, at best, affects a small number of machine-access use cases.</p><p>Since it has far fewer problems, and promises to be faster and more accurate, this approach was selected.</p><p>In practice this was implemented as language-specific keyword-document mappings, that point into a common file containing document lists.</p><p>Initially the indexes were constructed from a common journal file, which was consumed repeatedly, but this turned out to be slow, and a partitioned approach was selected instead, with one journal per language. This almost completely removes any overhead.</p><h2 id="outcome">Outcome</h2><p>The changes discussed above have been implemented, and upon evaluation seems to work reasonably well, though evaluation has somewhat run into a dead end, as the index itself is <strong>extremely</strong> small for the newly added languages.</p><p>The experience of small index is devious as it may just mean poor recall, though looking at the documents database for one index partition, this is about 12% of the index, it really is quite small!</p><table><thead><tr><th>iso</th><th>document count</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>en</td><td>112,846,397</td></tr><tr><td>de</td><td>7,623,983</td></tr><tr><td>fr</td><td>4,852,759</td></tr><tr><td>sv</td><td>1,020,962</td></tr></tbody></table><p>To verify this is not due some silent, catastrophic processing error, the proportions were compared against the number of documents found in the 50 GB document sample used in testing, using a simplified process that only does language identification.</p><table><thead><tr><th>iso</th><th>document count</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>en</td><td>11,497,571</td></tr><tr><td>de</td><td>614,311</td></tr><tr><td>fr</td><td>409,877</td></tr><tr><td>es</td><td>267,408</td></tr><tr><td>ja</td><td>217,599</td></tr><tr><td>nl</td><td>196,130</td></tr><tr><td>…</td><td>…</td></tr><tr><td>sv</td><td>67,670</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The proportions aren’t identical, but in the same general ballpark. The small size of the sample, along with the uneven distribution and apparent rarity of these documents adequately explains the disparity.</p><p>The lack of documents in languages other than English is likely due to how the index has been grown, by following and adding links from English websites. These occasionally lead to bilingual websites, and on rare occasions to websites completely in a different language, though it seems reasonable most websites that are not at least partially in English sees few or no links from English-language websites.</p><p>Adding to the problem, up until fairly recently the index wasn’t really growing very much at all, only through manual submissions.</p><p>Beyond a certain point, meaningfully growing the index by just following links became difficult.</p><p>Most known domains are dead, so merely adding more domains to the list of websites to crawl only serves to pollute the database with junk data.</p><p>In order to get around this, and reach the goal of indexing a billion documents, a new process was built to visit candidate websites to verify that they are in fact real and on-line, before assigning them to an index partition.</p><p>The process has been running for almost a quarter, and has managed to identify about 800,000 viable new domains in that time window. (This has brought the document total up to 969M documents. So very nearly there now!)</p><p>Web search is unusual in how often you run into these extremely long running processes that need to cook for months, sometimes up to a year before they really begin to pay off.</p><p>We’ll have to see whether building this new process was so prescient it ends up being sufficient to identify and add new domains in more languages, as links from the newly processed Swedish, French and German websites have been added to the domain database, or if some sort of manual seeding or targeted selection process is needed.</p><p>It seems plausible it will at least begin to remedy the data starvation, as the rate of successful domain discovery has shot up significantly since processing links from the documents processed in the newly added languages, and many of the new domains are indeed from <code>.de</code>, <code>.se</code>, <code>.fr</code>, and <code>.ch</code> domains.</p><p>For now we’ll have to wait and see how the data-set evolves. It is difficult to further refine the multi-language aspect of the search data with a data-set this small.</p></div></div>]]></description>
