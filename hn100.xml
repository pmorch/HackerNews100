<p dir="auto">I got this email:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Rich,</p>
<p dir="auto">Your creation of Clojure ...</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>sycophantic blather worthy of a third grader's homework assignment to write a letter to a public figure you don't know, using sources you don't understand, to  express an emotion unfelt, with no intention whatsoever</code></p>

<p dir="auto">Ah, Christmas time. That time of year when our hearts are warmed by the best wishes of an idiot robot. All tingly from the experience, and in the holiday spirit, I thought I'd write my own letter of thanks to those bringing us this next generation of 'AI'.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 dir="auto"><em>Dear 'AI' purveyors,</em></h3><a id="user-content-dear-ai-purveyors" aria-label="Permalink: Dear 'AI' purveyors," href="#dear-ai-purveyors"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">How shall I thank thee, let me count the ways:</p>
<p dir="auto">Should I thank you for pirating the entire historical output of creative humanity and then asserting ownership of your loot?</p>
<p dir="auto">For destroying education?</p>
<p dir="auto">For raising utility rates and killing the environment?</p>
<p dir="auto">For wasting vast quantities of developer time trying to coax some useful output from your BS generators, time which could instead be used communicating to interns and entry-level devs who, being actually intelligent, could learn from what they are told, and maintain what they make?</p>
<p dir="auto">For eliminating entry-level jobs, and thus the path to experience, ensuring future generations of unskilled, unemployable people?</p>
<p dir="auto">For giving me a fake person to talk to when I need support instead of an actual person who understands what I'm saying, can help me faster, and has a chance of caring?</p>
<p dir="auto">For replacing search results with summary BS?</p>
<p dir="auto">For providing the tools to fill the internet with slop, making actual human content almost impossible to find?</p>
<p dir="auto">For enticing CEOs with the promise to save some fraction of a percent on personnel costs, not actually be any faster, cutting off their future labor pool while only experiencing a modest to severe reduction in product quality, integrity and customer satisfaction (tradeoffs they are apparently eager to make)?</p>
<p dir="auto">For replacing musical expression with the sounds of robot parrots chirping?</p>
<p dir="auto">For adding an 'AI' feature to every flipping thing, most such features requiring a deep invasion of privacy?</p>
<p dir="auto">For running the second biggest and most damaging con of this century (running hard at first)?</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong><em>I think not.</em></strong></p>
<p dir="auto">This email was a reminder that agentic 'AI' is sure to flood the remainder of human communication channels with BS, swamping many services, and making every interaction with people not in the same room suspect, and filtering it a time-consuming waste, forever.</p>

                <p><em>On Wednesday 31 May, it was reported that Alex Mahon, CEO of Channel 4, could receive<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/may/31/channel-4-boss-alex-mahon-could-get-stations-biggest-ever-payday-of-14m" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> record annual pay of £1.4m</a>. This article was originally published on 26 April 2021 and asks, as Executive pay continues to rise, does a company need a CEO at all?</em></p>



<p>Over the next two weeks, the boards of <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/bae-systems-on-defensive-over-golden-handcuffs-deal-for-sought-after-ceo-12280257" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">BAE Systems</a>, <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/looming-astrazeneca-pay-row-provides-latest-headache-for-ceo-soriot-12284677" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">AstraZeneca</a>, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/glencore-ceo-pay-idUSL1N2M90QZ" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Glencore</a>,  <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/flutter-entertainment-shareholder-revolt-chief-executive-pay-rise-hostelworld-v6j3khkx2" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Flutter Entertainment</a> and the <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/london-stock-exchange-faces-investor-backlash-over-chiefs-25-pay-rise-12262725" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">London Stock Exchange</a> all face the possibility of shareholder revolts over executive pay at their forthcoming annual general meetings (AGMs). As the AGM season begins, there is a particular focus on pay.</p>



<p>Executive pay is often the most contentious item at an AGM, but this year is clearly exceptional. The people running companies that have been severely impacted by <a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/tag/covid-19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Covid-19</a> can’t be blamed for the devastation of their revenues by the pandemic, but they also can’t take credit for the government stimulus that has kept them afloat. Last week, for example, nearly 40 per cent of shareholders in the estate agents Foxtons <a href="https://propertyindustryeye.com/last-weeks-foxtons-agm-must-serve-as-a-wake-up-call-for-the-board/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">voted against</a> its chief executive officer, Nicholas Budden, receiving a bonus of just under £1m; Foxtons has received about £7m in direct government assistance and is benefiting from the government’s <a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/business/sectors/2021/04/who-benefits-when-government-pumps-housing-market" target="_blank" rel="noopener">continued inflation of the housing market</a>. The person who has done most to ensure Foxtons’ ongoing good fortune is not Nicholas Budden but <a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/tag/rishi-sunak" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rishi Sunak</a>. </p>



<p>Under the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Act, executive pay is voted on at least every three years, and this process forces shareholders and the public to confront how much the people at the top take home. Tim Steiner, the highest-paid CEO in the FTSE 100, was paid £58.7m in 2019 for running Ocado, which is <a href="https://www.cipd.co.uk/Images/ftse-100-executive-pay-report_tcm18-82375.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2,605 times the median income of his employees</a> for that year, while the average FTSE100 CEO makes more than £15,000 a day.  </p><section>

                        </section>



<p>As the High Pay Centre’s annual assessment of CEO pay points out, a top-heavy wage bill extends beyond the CEO, and could be unsustainable for any company this year. “When one considers high earners beyond the CEO”, says the report, ”there is actually quite significant potential for companies to safeguard jobs and incomes by asking higher-paid staff to make sacrifices”.</p>



<p>In the longer term, as companies commit to greater automation of many roles, it’s pertinent to ask whether a company needs a CEO at all.  </p>



<p>A few weeks ago Christine Carrillo, an American tech CEO, raised this question herself when she tweeted a spectacularly tone-deaf appreciation of her executive assistant, whose work allows Carrillo to “write [and] surf every day” as well as “cook dinner and read every night”. In Carrillo’s unusually frank description of the work her EA does – most of her emails, most of the work on fundraising, playbooks, operations, recruitment, research, updating investors, invoicing “and so much more” – she guessed that this unnamed worker “saves me 60% of time”.</p>



<p>Predictably, a horde arrived to point out that if someone else is doing 60 per cent of Carrillo’s job, they should be paid 50 per cent more than her. But as Carrillo – with a frankly breathtaking lack of self-awareness – informed another commenter, her EA is based in the Philippines. The main (and often the only) reason to outsource a role is to pay less for it.</p>



<p><strong><em>[See also: <a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/new-statesman-view/2023/05/the-scourge-of-greedflation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The scourge of greedflation</a>]</em></strong></p>



<p>If most of a CEO’s job can be outsourced, this suggests it could also be automated. But while <a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/business/companies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">companies</a> are racing to automate entry- and mid-level roles, senior executives and decision makers show much less interest in automating themselves.</p>



<p>There’s a good argument for automating from the top rather than from the bottom. As we know from the annotated copy of <em>Thinking, Fast and Slow</em> that sits (I assume) on every CEO’s Isamu Noguchi nightstand, human decision-making is the product of irrational biases and assumptions. This is one of the reasons strategy is so difficult, and roles that involve strategic decision-making are so well paid. But the difficulty of making genuinely rational strategic decisions, and the cost of the people who do so, are also good reasons to hand this work over to software.</p>



<p>Automating jobs can be risky, especially in public-facing roles. After Microsoft sacked a large team of journalists in 2020 in order to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/30/21275524/microsoft-news-msn-layoffs-artificial-intelligence-ai-replacements" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">replace them with AI</a>, it almost immediately had to contend with the <a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/tech/microsoft-robot-ai-editors-jade-thirwall-little-mix-a4463706.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PR disaster</a> of the software’s failure to distinguish between two women of colour. Amazon had to abandon its AI recruitment tool after it <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-jobs-automation-insight-idUSKCN1MK08G" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">learned to discriminate against women</a>. And when GPT-3, one of the most advanced AI language models, was used as a medical chatbot in 2020, it responded to a (simulated) patient presenting with suicidal ideation by <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/10/28/gpt3_medical_chatbot_experiment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">telling them to kill themselves</a>.</p>



<p>What links these examples is that they were all attempts to automate the kind of work that happens without being scrutinised by lots of other people in a company. Top-level strategic decisions are different. They are usually debated before they’re put into practice – unless, and this is just another reason to automate them, employees feel they can’t speak up for fear of incurring the CEO’s displeasure.</p>



<p>Where automated management – or “<a href="https://www.ibm.com/blogs/journey-to-ai/2020/04/the-rise-of-decision-intelligence-ai-that-optimizes-decision-making/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">decision intelligence</a>”, as Google and IBM call it – has been deployed, it’s produced impressive results. Hong Kong’s mass transit system put software in charge of scheduling its maintenance <a href="https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~hwchun/AIProjects/stories/allocation/mtrcscheduling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">in 2004</a>, and enjoys a reputation as one of the world’s most punctual and best-run metros.   </p>



<p>Clearly, chief execs didn’t get where they are today by volunteering to clear out their corner offices and hand over their caviar spittoons to robots. But management is a very large variable cost that only seems to increase – Persimmon’s <a href="https://www.verdict.co.uk/persimmons-chief-executive-bonus-comparison/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">bonus scheme</a> paid out half a billion pounds to 150 execs in a single year – while technology moves in the other direction, becoming cheaper and more reliable over time.</p>



<p>It is often asked whether CEO pay is fair or ethical. But company owners and investors should be asking if their top management could be done well by a machine – and if so, why is it so expensive?</p>

<time datetime="2025-12-27">Dec 27, 2025</time>



(<a href="http://maurycyz.com/tags/photography">Photography</a>) 



<p>Here’s a photo of a Christmas tree, as my camera’s sensor sees it:</p>
<p><img src="https://maurycyz.com/misc/raw_photo/xmas1.jpg" alt=""></p>
<center>Sensor data with the 14 bit ADC values mapped to 0-255 RGB.</center>
<!-- Black point compensation --> 
<p>It’s not even black-and-white, it’s gray-and-gray.
This is becuase while the ADC’s output can theoretically go from 0 to 16382, the actual data doesn’t cover that whole range:</p>
<p><img src="https://maurycyz.com/misc/raw_photo/hist1.png" alt=""></p>
<center>Histogram of raw image</center>
<p>The real range of ADC values is ~2110 to ~136000.
Let’s set those values as the white and black in the image:</p>
<p><strong>V<sub>new</sub> = (V<sub>old</sub> - Black)/(White - Black)</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://maurycyz.com/misc/raw_photo/xmas2.jpg" alt=""></p>
<center>Progress</center>
<p>Much better, but it’s still more monochromatic then I remember the tree being.
Camera sensors aren’t actually able to see color: They only measure how much light hit each pixel.</p>
<p>In a color camera, the sensor is covered by a grid of alternating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_filter">color filters</a>:</p>
<p><img src="https://maurycyz.com/misc/raw_photo/xmas3.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Let’s color each pixel the same as the filter it’s looking through:</p>
<p><img src="https://maurycyz.com/misc/raw_photo/xmas4.png" alt=""></p>
<center>Bayer matrix overlay</center>
<p>This version is  more colorful, but each pixel only has one third of it’s RGB color.
To fix this, I just averaged the values each pixel with it’s neighbors:</p>
<p><img src="https://maurycyz.com/misc/raw_photo/xmas5.png" alt=""></p>
<center>Demosaicing results</center>
<p>Applying this process to the whole photo gives the lights some color:</p>
<p><img src="https://maurycyz.com/misc/raw_photo/xmas6.jpg" alt=""></p>
<center>Demosaiced tree</center>
<p>However, the image is still very dark.
This is because monitors don’t have as much dynamic range as the human eye, or a camera sensor:
Even if you are using an OLED, the screen still has some ambient light reflecting off of it and limiting how black it can get.</p>
<p>There’s also another, sneaker factor causing this:</p>
<p><img src="https://maurycyz.com/misc/raw_photo/lin.png" alt=""></p>
<center>True linear gradient</center>
<p>Our perception of brightness is non-linear.</p>
<p>If brightness values are quantized, most of the ADC bins will be wasted on nearly identical shades of white while every other tone is crammed into the bottom.
Because this is an inefficient use of memory, most color spaces assign extra bins to darker colors:</p>
<p><img src="https://maurycyz.com/misc/raw_photo/nonlin.png" alt=""></p>
<center>sRGB gradient</center>
<p>As a result of this, if the linear data is displayed directly, it will appear much darker then it should be.</p>
<p>Both problems can be solved by applying a non-linear curve to each color channel to brighten up the dark areas… but this doesn’t quite work out:</p>
<p><img src="https://maurycyz.com/misc/raw_photo/xmas7.jpg" alt=""></p>
<center>ohno</center>
<p>Some of this green cast is caused by the camera sensor being intrinsically more sensitive to green light, but some of it is my fault:
There are twice as many green pixels in the filter matrix.
When combined with my rather naive demosaicing, this resulted in the green channel being boosted even higher.</p>
<p>In either case, it can fixed with proper white-balance:
Equalize the channels by multiply each one with a constant.</p>
<p>However, because the image is now non-linear, I have to go back a step to do this.
Here’s the dark image from before with all the values temporarily scaled up so I can see the problem:</p>
<p><img src="https://maurycyz.com/misc/raw_photo/xmas8.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>… here’s that image with the green taken down to mach the other channels:</p>
<p><img src="https://maurycyz.com/misc/raw_photo/xmas9.jpg" alt=""></p>
<center>Banishing the green</center>
<p>… and after re-applying the curve:</p>
<p><img src="https://maurycyz.com/misc/raw_photo/xmas10.jpg" alt=""></p>
<center>Finally: A decent photo.</center>
<p>This is really just the bare minimum:
I haven’t done any color calibration, the white balance isn’t perfect, there’s lots of noise that needs to be cleaned up…</p>
<p>Additionally, applying the curve to each color channel accidentally desaturated the highlights.
This effect looks rather good — and is what we’ve come to expect from film — but it’s has de-yellowed the star.
It’s possible to separate the luminance and curve it while preserving color.
On it’s own, this would make the LED Christmas lights into an overstaturated mess, but combining both methods can produce nice results.</p>
<p>For comparison, here’s the image my camera produced from the same data:</p>
<p><img src="https://maurycyz.com/misc/raw_photo/xmas0.jpg" alt=""></p>
<center>"in camera" JPEG image.</center>
<p>Far from being an “unedited” photo: there’s a huge amount of math that’s gone into making an image that nicely represents what the subject looks like in person.</p>
<p>There’s nothing that happens when you adjust the contrast or white balance in editing software that the camera hasn’t done under the hood.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			<p>Execution of C# code in Unity’s Mono runtime is slow by today’s standards, much slower than you might expect! Our game runs 2-3x faster on modern .NET compared to Unity’s Mono, and in a few small benchmarks I measured speedups of up to 15x. I’ve spent some time investigating what’s going on and in this article I will present my findings and why everyone should want Unity’s .NET modernization to become production-ready as soon as possible.</p>
		
<h2 id="How-did-we-get-here">How did we get here</h2>

<p>
	Unity uses the Mono framework to run C# programs and back in 2006 it was one of the only viable multi-platform implementations of .NET.
	Mono is also open-source, allowing Unity to do some tweaks to better suit game development.
</p>
<p>
	An interesting twist happened nearly 10 years later.
	In 2014, Microsoft began open-sourcing .NET (notably .NET Core later that year) and in June 2016, .NET Core 1.0 shipped with official cross-platform support.
	Since then, the .NET ecosystem gained momentum and lots of improvements have been made, including the Roslyn compiler platform, a new JIT (just-in-time compiler), performance improvements, more features, etc.
</p>
<p>
	In 2018, <a href="https://xoofx.github.io/blog/2018/04/06/porting-unity-to-coreclr/" target="_blank">Unity engineers discussed</a> that they are working on porting the engine to .NET CoreCLR, the multi-platform version of Common Language Runtime (CLR), a component that runs .NET programs.
	Their main motivations behind this project were performance and convergence.
	In their post they said:
</p>
<blockquote>...CoreCLR could be great for Unity game developers, as it will provide a significant boost in performance, by an order of 2x to 5x compare to the Mono runtime sometimes up to x10 on some workload!</blockquote>
<p>
	Unfortunately, now it’s the end of 2025 and we still can’t run games on CoreCLR.
</p>


<h2 id="The-performance-gap">The performance gap</h2>

<p>
	We don’t hear about the performance gap between Mono and .NET much, likely because it is not possible to run games written for Unity under modern .NET.
	But we can still do a direct comparison with code that does not depend on Unity directly.
</p>
<p>
	Our game has a unique architecture – we strictly separate the game simulation code (business logic) from rendering.
	So much so that the simulation code does not depend on Unity’s libraries and can be compiled and run under any .NET version.
</p>
<p>
	One day I was debugging an issue in map generation and it was time-consuming because it was taking over 2 minutes to start a game.
	To make debugging faster, I’ve written a unit test, hoping to cut down on the turn-around time since Unity takes 15+ seconds just to crunch new DLLs and reload the domain before the game can be launched and it also initializes rendering stuff that I did not care about.
	When I ran the test, it finished in 40 seconds.
	I was quite surprised that it was more than 3x faster, so I started digging deeper.
</p>
<p>
	Long story short, <a href="#figure-1" title="Go to figure 1: A trace of game startup in Unity and .NET, Debug mode.">Figure 1</a> shows traces from a profiler showing the difference between the game launching in Unity running under Mono vs. a unit test running under .NET.
</p>
<p>
	<i>Note that all shown benchmarks are using either Unity 6.0 or .NET 10.</i>
</p>

<div id="figure-1"><p><span>Figure 1: A trace of game startup in Unity and .NET, Debug mode.</span></p></div>

<p>
	So our benchmark shows that loading a save file, generating a map, and initializing the simulation takes 100 seconds in Unity/Mono but only 38 seconds in .NET.
	This result alone is already something that may raise eyebrows and has real consequences of how you may want to approach debugging and testing.
</p>
<p>
	I also know from experience with Unity that Release mode running as a standalone executable (without the Unity editor) is much faster, so I decided to test that next.
</p>

<h2 id="NET-vs-Mono-in-standalone-Release-mode">.NET vs. Mono in standalone Release mode</h2>
<p>
	Debug mode slowness is not great, but even non-optimized C++ code can be slow.
	To compare the real performance gap between Mono and .NET, let’s run the same benchmark as above but in release mode, standalone executable.
</p>
<p>
	First up: Unity. I’ve run our deploy script to get an optimized executable and run it directly.
	Unsurprisingly, optimized standalone executable is beating Unity editor by a big margin, more than 3x faster.
	Next, the same code running under .NET in Release mode.
	<a href="#figure-2" title="Go to figure 2: A trace of game startup in Unity and .NET, Release mode">Figure 2</a> shows the results.
</p>
<div id="figure-2"><p><span>Figure 2: A trace of game startup in Unity and .NET, Release mode</span></p></div>

<p>
	Yep. 12 seconds.
	It’s actually mind-boggling how much work is being done in these 12 seconds and when I saw this for the first time, I was not only shocked, but also impressed.
	Just so you know, a 4k × 4k map is being generated using all available threads out of hundreds of combined noise functions in like 3 seconds.
	<a href="#figure-3" title="Go to figure 3: The expanded trace of the 12-second run from above. The blue boxes after the highlighted area is the actual unit test, stepping the game.">Figure 3</a> shows the trace expanded.

<p>
	If you are interested in seeing the actual x86 assembly generated by Mono and .NET JITs, see the Extras section at the end of this article.
</p>


<h2 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>
	As you can see from the presented benchmarks, Mono is massively behind .NET in terms of performance.
	This is primarily due to differences in runtime optimizations and JIT that generates unoptimized assembly.
	The actual speedup surely depends on the code itself, but from my research, 1.5-3x speedup of C# execution is very likely for most projects.
</p>
<p>
	If you are a game developer using Unity, or even a player, you can now understand that <b>CoreCLR would be a massive boost to performance of games and even the Unity editor</b>.
	Unfortunately, for the past 8 years, Unity leadership was more interested in “other things” and did not give .NET modernization the attention it deserves.
</p>
<p>
	Some view .NET modernization as support for new language features in C#, but that is just a cherry on top.
	New C# adds some handy features, but the new JIT can deliver multi-x speedups.
</p>
<p>
	At this year's Unite conference, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKmARCIkSI&amp;t=1502s" target="_blank">Unity announced</a>
	that CoreCLR is still ongoing but it won’t be production ready in 2026.
	The good news is that it now seems to be on the Unity 6.x roadmap, and not left for later versions as suggested by 2024’s Unite presentation.
</p>
<div id="figure-4"><p><span>Figure 4: Slides from Unite 2025 showing that .NET Modernization is planned for 6.x release with unannounced date.</span></p></div>
<p>
	Moreover, CoreCLR is not just new JIT and C#, it unlocks broader and better-optimized support for things like Span&lt;T&gt;-style APIs, hardware intrinsics, and newer SIMD paths that devs cannot use these days.
	These features could add another multiplier to the performance gains for some classes of code.
	For example, our map generator heavily uses 2D and 3D simplex noise.
	I bet that having access to new runtime features in CoreCLR could speed up the map generation by another 2x.
</p>
<p>
	Unity has a technology called Burst that automatically converts marked C# methods to optimized native assembly via the LLVM compiler.
	This sounds neat as it can avoid the poor JIT performance, but the downside is that Burst has strict limitations on what can be converted and supports only subset of C#.
	I believe that CoreCLR with modern JIT will have very similar performance characteristics to Burst.
	I am curious what would happen in a universe where Unity invested all the time and effort in CoreCLR support and high-performance C#, instead of developing and maintaining Burst.
</p>
<p>
	Another interesting consequence of CoreCLR support is the ability to pre-compile the .NET intermediate assembly to machine code using ahead-of-time compilation (AOT).
	AOT can further improve startup time and is essential on platforms where JIT is restricted (notably iOS).
	Nowadays, Unity solves this with IL2CPP that takes the intermediate code and compiles it to C++ which is then optimized and compiled to native assembly.
	However, <a href="https://discussions.unity.com/t/the-unity-engine-roadmap-unite-2025/1696495/65" target="_blank">according to RichardFine (Unity staff)</a>,
	using CoreCLR AOT is not planned and IL2CPP is here to stay:
</p>
<blockquote>AOT for IL2CPP is completely independent of AOT for CoreCLR (which we have no plans to adopt anyway).
GC behaviour on IL2CPP improves when we upgrade the GC there, it’s not really affected by CoreCLR at all.</blockquote>
<p>
	In conclusion, CoreCLR won’t magically fix every bottleneck in a Unity game, but it does fix many of the code generation inefficiencies and allows writing higher-performance code.
	The benchmark presented in this article is meant to illustrate that modern .NET has spent years squeezing more work into fewer CPU cycles, and Unity users are largely locked out of those gains today.
</p>
<p>
	If Unity can deliver production-ready CoreCLR support, it won’t just mean “newer C#”.
	It will mean faster runtime performance, faster iteration times, more performance headroom, no domain reload, 
	better GC behavior, and maybe even more managed code and less native code. 
	Until then, the gap will remain an invisible tax on every Unity project that leans on managed code.
</p>
<p>
	I’m cheering for you, Unity devs, CoreCLR for the win!

<p>
	I have actually dug much deeper into the performance aspects of Mono vs .NET but for the sake of this article not being too long, here is a brief summary.
</p>
<p>
	<a href="#code-1" title="Go to code listing 1: Simple benchmark code">Code listing 1</a> shows the testing code.
	It does some basic summing of custom structs that are wrappers around ints.
	This is an interesting example because Mono is very bad at inlining and simplifying expressions, even obvious ones, and we have plenty of structs like these in our code base (e.g. Quantity, MechPower, Tile2i, etc).

<p>
	To obtain assembly code, I’ve compiled the code in Release mode and ran it as a standalone executable.
	Then, I attached a debugger to the running process. An easy way to find this loop was to make it long/infinite and just break the program at any time, it would end up in that loop.
</p>
<p>
	First, let’s take a look at .NET. Here is the x64 assembly of the for-loop section of the code.
</p>
<div id="code-2"><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
</pre></td><td><pre><span>add</span> r8d,edx
<span>add</span> edx,r10d
00007FFDEC338E88:
    <span>mov</span>  r10d,r8d
    <span>add</span>  r9d,r10d
    <span>mov</span>  r10d,edx
    <span>add</span>  r9d,r10d
    <span>inc</span>  ecx
    <span>cmp</span>  ecx,eax
    <span>jl</span>   00007FFDEC338E88</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></p></div>
<p>
	In both cases, the full loop of <code>int.MaxValue</code> iterations took around 750 ms on my machine.
</p>
<p>
	This looks neat. Even if you don’t read assembly, you can see that there are two add instructions, one decrement, and one jump.
	It seems that the JIT hoisted the invariant sums <code>a = value1 + value2</code> and <code>b = value1 + value3</code> out of the loop and then just accumulates them.
</p>
<p>
	I also tested x86 assembly, and it looks very similar:
</p>
<div id="code-3"><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
</pre></td><td><pre>082E18D0:
    <span>lea</span>  ebx,[esi+edi]
    <span>add</span>  eax,ebx
    <span>lea</span>  ebx,[esi+edx]
    <span>add</span>  eax,ebx
    <span>dec</span>  ecx
    <span>jne</span>  082E18D0</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></p></div>
<p>
	Interestingly, the loop direction was reversed, counting down.
	This saves one instruction as comparison to zero and conditional jump can be done as one instruction.
</p>
<p>
	Now let’s look at Mono’s x64 assembly.

<p>
	As you can see just from the number of instructions, this code will run way slower.
	The full loop of <code>int.MaxValue</code> iterations took around 11500 ms, that’s ~15x slower.
</p>
<p>
	In the assembly you can see the four add instructions in the loop, the “inefficient” increment + comparison + jump (instead of decrement + conditional jump), and most importantly a sea of mov instructions, which are just memory copies from inefficient inlining of the struct fields.
	Basically Mono is just tossing values around memory.
</p>
<p>
	I have also tested assembly compiled in Debug mode running in the Unity editor and it’s even worse.
	The full loop takes 67 seconds (67000 ms)! In Unity Editor, the JIT likely switches to far less optimized codegen and includes additional checks/sequence-point overhead, which balloons runtime.
</p>
<p>
	Takeaway: modern .NET’s JIT can scalarize tiny value types and hoist invariant work so the hot loop becomes a handful of register ops, while Mono often fails to do so and ends up shuffling values through memory, exactly the kind of gap that shows up as slowdowns in real simulation-heavy code.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><header></header><section><p>A lot of my readers <a href="https://lobste.rs/c/ch8tn0">call</a> <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46085088">me</a> <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46082989">a cynic</a> when I say things like “you should do things that <a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/how-to-ship">make your manager happy</a>” or “big tech companies <a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/bad-code-at-big-companies">get to decide</a> what projects you work on”. Alex Wennerberg put the “Sean Goedecke is a cynic” case well in his post <a href="https://alexwennerberg.com/blog/2025-11-28-engineering.html"><em>Software Engineers Are Not Politicians</em></a>. Here are some excerpts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have no doubt that [Sean’s] advice is quite effective for navigating the upper levels of an organization dedicated to producing a large, mature software product. But what is lost is any sort of conception of value. Is it too naive to say that engineers are more than “tools in a political game”, they are specialized professionals whose role is to apply their expertise towards solving meaningful problems?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The irony is that this kind of thinking destroys a company’s ability to actually make money … the idea that engineers should begin with a self-conception of doing what their manager tells them to is, to me, very bleak. It may be a good way to operate smoothly within a bureaucratic organization, and of course, one must often make compromises and take direction, but it is a bad way to do good work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I can see why people would think this way. But I <em>love</em> working in big tech companies! I do see myself as a professional solving meaningful problems. And I think navigating the organization to put real features or improvements in the hands of users is an excellent way - maybe the best way - to do good work.</p>
<p>Why do I write such cynical posts, then? Well, I think that a small amount of cynicism is necessary in order to think clearly about how organizations work, and to avoid falling into the trap of being overly cynical. In general, I think <strong>good engineers ought to be a little bit cynical</strong>.</p>
<h3>The idealist view is more cynical than idealists think</h3>
<p>One doctrinaire “idealist” view of software engineering goes something like this. I’m obviously expressing it in its most lurid form, but I do think many people believe this more or less literally:<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p>We live in a late-stage-capitalist hellscape, where large companies are run by aspiring robber barons who have no serious convictions beyond desiring power. All those companies want is for obedient engineering drones to churn out bad code fast, so they can goose the (largely fictional) stock price. Meanwhile, end-users are left holding the bag: paying more for worse software, being hassled by advertisements, and dealing with bugs that are unprofitable to fix. The only thing an ethical software engineer can do is to try and find some temporary niche where they can defy their bosses and do real, good engineering work, or to retire to a hobby farm and write elegant open-source software in their free time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you write it all out, I think it’s clear to see that this is <em>incredibly</em> cynical. At the very least, it’s a cynical way to view your coworkers and bosses, who are largely people like you: doing a job, balancing a desire to do good work with the need to please their own bosses. It’s a cynical way to view the C-staff of a company. I think it’s also inaccurate: from my limited experience, the people who run large tech companies really do want to deliver good software to users.</p>
<p>It’s idealistic only in the sense that it does not accept the need for individual software engineers to compromise. According to this view, <em>you</em> never need to write bad software. No matter how hard the company tells you to compromise and just get something out, you’re morally required to plant your feet and tell them to go to hell. In fact, by doing so, you’re taking a stand against the general degeneration of the modern software world. You’re protecting - unsung, like Batman - the needs of the end-user who will never know you exist.</p>
<p>I can certainly see the appeal of this view! But I don’t think it’s an <em>idealistic</em> appeal. It comes from seeing the world as fundamentally corrupted and selfish, and believing that real positive change is impossible. In other words, <strong>I think it’s a <em>cynical</em> appeal.</strong></p>
<h3>The cynical view is more idealistic than idealists think</h3>
<p>I don’t see a hard distinction between engineers being “tools in a political game” and professionals who solve meaningful problems. In fact, I think that in practice <strong>almost all meaningful problems are solved by playing political games</strong>.</p>
<p>There are very few problems that you can solve entirely on your own. Software engineers encounter more of these problems than average, because the nature of software means that a single engineer can have huge leverage by sitting down and making a single code change. But in order to make changes to large products - for instance, to make it possible for GitHub’s 150M users to <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/writing-mathematical-expressions">use LaTeX in markdown</a> - you need to coordinate with many other people at the company, which means you need to be involved in politics.</p>
<p>It is just a plain fact that software engineers are not the movers and shakers in large tech organizations. They do not set the direction of the company. To the extent that they have political influence, it’s in how they translate the direction of the company into specific technical changes. But <strong>that is actually quite a lot of influence!</strong> </p>
<p>Large tech companies serve hundreds of millions (or billions) of users. Small changes to these products can have a massive positive or negative effect in the aggregate. As I see it, choosing to engage in the messy, political process of making these changes - instead of washing your hands of it as somehow impure - is an act of idealism. </p>
<p>I think the position of a software engineer in a large tech company is similar to people who go into public service: idealistically hoping that they can do some good, despite knowing that they themselves will never set the broad strokes of government policy.</p>
<p>Of course, big-tech software engineers are paid far better, so many people who go into this kind of work in fact are purely financially-motivated cynics. But I’m not one of them! I think it’s possible, by doing good work, to help steer the giant edifice of a large tech company for the better.</p>
<h3>Cynicism as inoculation</h3>
<p>Cynical writing is like most medicines: the dose makes the poison. A healthy amount of cynicism can serve as an inoculation from being overly cynical.</p>
<p>If you don’t have an slightly cynical explanation for why engineers write bad code in large tech companies - such as the one I write about <a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/bad-code-at-big-companies">here</a> - you risk adopting an overly cynical one. For instance, you might think that big tech engineers are being <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46082989">deliberately demoralized</a> as part of an anti-labor strategy to prevent them from unionizing, which is nuts. Tech companies are simply not set up to engage in these kind of conspiracies.</p>
<p>If you don’t have a slightly cynical explanation for why large tech companies sometimes make inefficient decisions - such as <a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/seeing-like-a-software-company">this one</a> - you risk adopting an overly cynical one. For instance, you might think that tech companies are full of incompetent <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46133179">losers</a>, which is simply not true. Tech companies have a normal mix of strong and <a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/weak-engineers">weak engineers</a>.</p>
<h3>Final thoughts</h3>
<p><strong>Idealist writing is massively over-represented in writing about software engineering</strong>. There is no shortage of books or blog posts (correctly) explaining that we ought to value good code, that we ought to be kind to our colleagues, that we ought to work on projects with positive real-world impact, and so on. There <em>is</em> a shortage of writing that accurately describes how big tech companies operate.</p>
<p>Of course, cynical writing can harm people: by making them sad, or turning them into bitter cynics. But <strong>idealist writing can harm people too</strong>. There’s a whole generation of software engineers who came out of the 2010s with a <em>factually incorrect</em> model of how big tech companies work, and who are effectively being fed into the woodchipper in the 2020s. They would be better off if they internalized a correct model of how these companies work: not just less likely to get into trouble, but better at achieving their own idealist goals<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup>.</p>

A null-terminated string means that a null byte is used to mark the end of the string:</span></p><pre><code><span>char* s = "hello"
// in memory, this is represented as an array of characters with the last element being the null terminator: h e l l o </span><strong>\0</strong></code></pre><p>The way such strings get parsed is very simple - the deserializer reads every character until it finds a null terminator.</p><p>If you recall, I said earlier that the first field of the BSON message denotes what type of “RPC” the command is.</p><p>As such, the first thing a server does when handling an incoming message over the wire is… parse the first field!</p><p>Because fields are strings, and strings are null-terminated CStrings, the deserializing logic in the MongoDB server parses the field until the first null terminator found.</p><p><span>An attacker can send a compressed, invalid BSON object that does NOT contain a null terminator.

In order to be helpful, the response contains an error message that shows which field was invalid:</p><pre><code><span>{
  "ok": 0,
  "errmsg": "invalid BSON field name 'a      | </span><strong>password: 123</strong><span>'",
  "code": 2,
  "codeName": "BadValue"

The attacker successfully got the server to leak data to it.</p><p>Any serious attacker would then run this over and over again, thousands of time a second, until they believe they’ve scanned the majority of the database’s heap. They can then repeat this ad infinitum.</p><p><span>The impact of this is particularly nasty, because the request-response parsing cycle happens </span><strong>before any authentication can be made</strong><span>. This makes sense, since you cannot begin to authenticate a request you still haven’t deserialized.</span></p><p><span>This allows </span><strong>any</strong><span> attacker to gain access to </span><strong>any</strong><span> piece of potentially-sensitive data.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/3777">https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/3777</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46414078">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-testid="markdown-body" data-team-hovercards-enabled="true" data-turbolinks="false"><p dir="auto">In March 2026, I will be Mockito maintainer for 10 years (nearly a third of my whole life). Looking ahead, I decided that a decade milestone is a good moment to pass on maintainership to other folks. In the coming months until March, I will spend time ensuring a smooth transition in maintainership.</p>
<p dir="auto">In this issue I list several considerations why I made the decision. Communication and discussion of plans for future maintainership will be somewhere else, most likely in a separate GitHub issue. Stay tuned for that.</p>
<h2 dir="auto">Energy drain because of JVM agent change</h2>
<p dir="auto">As you might know, Mockito 5 shipped a breaking change where its main artifact is now an agent. That's because starting JVM 22, the previous so-called "dynamic attachment of agents" is put behind a flag. This change makes sense from a security point-of-view and I support it.</p>
<p dir="auto">However, the way this was put forward to Mockito maintainers was energy draining to say the least. Mockito is probably the biggest user of such an agent and is often looked at for inspiration by other projects. As such, Mockito often pioneers on supporting JVM features, built on a solid foundation with ByteBuddy. Modules was such a feature that took months of hard work by Rafael to figure out, including providing feedback to JVM maintainers.</p>
<p dir="auto">Unfortunately such a collaborative way of working was not the case when discussing agents. To me, it felt like the feature was presented as a done deal because of security. While dynamic attachment is problematic in many ways, no alternative solutions were proposed. That's okay, as Mockito pioneers on these solutions, yet in this case I felt we were left alone.</p>
<p dir="auto">My personal take is that folks involved with the change severely underestimated the societal impact that it had. The fact that proper build support is non-existent to this day shows that agents are not a priority. That's okay if it isn't a priority, but when it was communicated with Mockito I perceived it as "Mockito is holding the JVM ecosystem back by using dynamic attachment, please switch immediately and figure it out on your own".</p>
<p dir="auto">Here, the fact that I (and others) are volunteers doing their best for the project, is important to understand the societal impact. When you put individuals under pressure, who do this work in their own time out of goodwill, things crumble. It's commonly joked about with XKCD's on the fact that the whole open source world relies on a couple of individuals. That couldn't be more true in this situation, where the collaborative system collapses when too much pressure is put on individual folks.</p>
<p dir="auto">This saga planted the seed to reconsider my position as maintainer.</p>
<h2 dir="auto">Kotlin as the future and odd one out</h2>
<p dir="auto">It's undeniable that Kotlin as a language has grown in popularity in recent years. While Mockito maintains several flavors for JVM languages, these packages typically include sugar that makes integration nicer. In all cases, mockito-core remains the place where functionality is implemented.</p>
<p dir="auto">Unfortunately, this model doesn't nicely apply to Kotlin. Where almost all JVM languages work similarly under the hood, Kotlin often does things differently. This means that in several places in mockito-core, there are separate flows dedicated to Kotlin. Most often that's a direct result of Kotlin doing (in my opinion) shenanigans on the JVM that the JVM never intended to support, yet was able to.</p>
<p dir="auto">Even within Kotlin itself, features don't work consistently. Suspend functions are the most well-known example. As such, Mockito code becomes more spaghetti, it's API sometimes fully duplicated just to support a core Kotlin language feature and overall less maintainable.</p>
<p dir="auto">While I fully understand the reasons that developers enjoy the feature richness of Kotlin as a programming language, its underlying implementation has significant downsides for projects like Mockito. Quite frankly, it's not fun to deal with.</p>
<p dir="auto">To me, a future where Kotlin becomes more predominant is not a future that makes me hopeful I can keep on dedicating energy to Mockito.</p>
<h2 dir="auto">Alternative open source activities</h2>
<p dir="auto">I have always been a fan of open source work and have contributed to hundreds of projects in all these years. Mockito is my most important project, but I have also consistently worked on others. In recent months, I have rediscovered the joy of programming by working on Servo. It's a web engine written in Rust.</p>
<p dir="auto">When I need to choose how I want to spend my 2 hours of evening time in a given week, I rarely preferred Mockito in the last year. In the past, Mockito was my go-to and I enjoyed it a lot. Nowadays, Servo and related projects provide significantly more enjoyment.</p>
<p dir="auto">Justifying why I needed to work on Mockito becomes difficult when (because of the above reasons) it feels like a chore. Volunteering work shouldn't feel like a chore, at least not for a long time.</p>
<h2 dir="auto">Summing it up</h2>
<p dir="auto">As you have read, these three factors combined led me to the decision. The first point explains why I started to doubt my position, the second point why I am not hopeful for things to change in a good way and the third point how I found enjoyment in a different way.</p>
<p dir="auto">While these points had impact on me as maintainer, my hypothesis is that it doesn't apply to others in the same way. I know others are eager to work on Kotlin support for example. That's why I concluded that a decade is enough time to have helped Mockito forward. Now it's time for somebody else to take over, as I believe that's in the best interest of Mockito as a project. Because ultimately that's why I chose to become maintainer in the first place: I believed that with my work, I could improve Mockito for millions of software engineers.</p>
<p dir="auto">For those wondering: yes I wholeheartedly advise everyone to take on a volunteering task such as maintaining an open source project. It was an honour and privilege to do so and I thank those that I enjoyed working with.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>Purpose and Target Audience<a href="#purpose-and-target-audience" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>First and foremost, a couple important terms:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Software-Defined Radio (SDR):</strong></dt><dd><p>As a <em>concept</em> it refers to using software to perform signal processing tasks that were traditionally performed by hardware, specific to radio/RF applications.  This software can be run on a general-purpose computer (CPU), FPGA, or even GPU, and it can be used for real-time applications or offline processing of recorded signals.  Analogous terms include “software radio” and “RF digital signal processing”.</p>
<p>As a <em>thing</em> (e.g., “an SDR”) it typically refers to a device that you can plug an antenna into and receive RF signals, with the digitized RF samples being sent to a computer for processing or recording (e.g., over USB, Ethernet, PCI).  Many SDRs also have transmit capabilities, allowing the computer to send samples to the SDR which then transmits the signal at a specified RF frequency.  Some embedded-style SDRs include an onboard computer.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Digital Signal Processing (DSP):</strong></dt><dd>The digital processing of signals; in our case, RF signals.</dd>
</dl>
<p>This textbook acts as a hands-on introduction to the areas of DSP, SDR, and wireless communications.  It is designed for someone who is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Interested in <em>using</em> SDRs to do cool stuff</li>
<li>Good with Python</li>
<li>Relatively new to DSP, wireless communications, and SDR</li>
<li>A visual learner, preferring animations over equations</li>
<li>Better at understanding equations <em>after</em> learning the concepts</li>
<li>Looking for concise explanations, not a 1,000 page textbook</li>
</ol>
<p>An example is a Computer Science student interested in a job involving wireless communications after graduation, although it can be used by anyone itching to learn about SDR who has programming experience.  As such, it covers the necessary theory to understand DSP techniques without the intense math that is usually included in DSP courses.  Instead of burying ourselves in equations, an abundance of images and animations are used to help convey the concepts, such as the Fourier series complex plane animation below.  I believe that equations are best understood <em>after</em> learning the concepts through visuals and practical exercises.  The heavy use of animations is why PySDR will never have a hard copy version being sold on Amazon.</p>
<p><a href="https://pysdr.org/_images/fft_logo_wide.gif"><img alt="The PySDR logo created using a Fourier transform" src="https://pysdr.org/_images/fft_logo_wide.gif"></a></p><p>This textbook is meant to introduce concepts quickly and smoothly, enabling the reader to perform DSP and use SDRs intelligently.  It’s not meant to be a reference textbook for all DSP/SDR topics; there are plenty of great textbooks already out there, such as <a href="https://www.analog.com/en/education/education-library/software-defined-radio-for-engineers.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Analog Device’s SDR textbook</a> and <a href="http://www.dspguide.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">dspguide.com</a>.  You can always use Google to recall trig identities or the Shannon limit.  Think of this textbook like a gateway into the world of DSP and SDR: it’s lighter and less of a time and monetary commitment, when compared to more traditional courses and textbooks.</p>
<p>To cover foundational DSP theory, an entire semester of “Signals and Systems”, a typical course within electrical engineering, is condensed into a few chapters.  Once the DSP fundamentals are covered, we launch into SDRs, although DSP and wireless communications concepts continue to come up throughout the textbook.</p>
<p>Code examples are provided in Python.  They utilize NumPy, which is Python’s standard library for arrays and high-level math.  The examples also rely upon Matplotlib, which is a Python plotting library that provides an easy way to visualize signals, arrays, and complex numbers.  Note that while Python is “slower” than C++ in general, most math functions within Python/NumPy are implemented in C/C++ and heavily optimized.  Likewise, the SDR API we use is simply a set of Python bindings for C/C++ functions/classes.  Those who have little Python experience yet a solid foundation in MATLAB, Ruby, or Perl will likely be fine after familiarizing themselves with Python’s syntax.</p>

However, when using an external display, especially a very demanding one like a 4K 120Hz display, I’ve noticed it started struggling more. Since it lacks fans, you can’t hear it struggling, but you can feel it as everything becomes very slow or unresponsive: that’s when thermal throttling kicks in.</p><p>I know it’s thermal throttling because I can see in iStat Menus that my CPU usage is 100% while the power usage in watts goes down.</p><p>It’s even more obvious with <a href="https://www.seense.com/menubarstats/mxpg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">MX Power Gadget</a>: You can see the power usage and frequency of the performance core dropping, as usage keeps being 100%:</p><figure><img src="https://stanislas.blog/2025/12/macos-thermal-throttling-app/mx-power-gadget-throttling.png" alt="MX Power Gadget"></figure><p>I’ve also hit thermal throttling with my work MacBook Pro. It’s the 14" M4 Max variant, <a href="https://www.bestlaptop.deals/articles/m4-macbook-pros-ultimate-review-performance-power-efficiency-battery-life?utm_source=chatgpt.com#Sustained-Performance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">which is the worst variant</a> because the thermal envelope of the 14" is too small for the max output for the M4 Max. On my previous 14" M1 Pro MacBook Pro, I’ve never even heard the fans in 3 years…</p><p>That being said, I still love Apple Silicon for the performance and power usage, it’s still a dramatic improvement over the Intel days. 🫶</p><p>Anyway, I wanted to know: is there a way to tell if the Apple Silicon SoC is thermal throttling, that is not based on heuristics like in my screenshot?</p><h2 id="getting-the-thermal-state-programmatically">Getting the thermal state programmatically <span><a href="#getting-the-thermal-state-programmatically" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h2><p>This was a wilder ride than I expected. It’s possible to know programmatically if the Mac is throttled, because macOS exposes this in various but inconsistent ways.</p><p>The approach that Apple recommends is to use <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/processinfo/thermalstate-swift.enum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><code>ProcessInfo.thermalState</code></a> from <code>Foundation</code>:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="swift"><span><span>➜  <span>~</span> swift <span>-</span>e '<span>import</span> Foundation; print([<span>"nominal"</span>, <span>"fair"</span>, <span>"serious"</span>, <span>"critical"</span>][ProcessInfo.processInfo.thermalState.rawValue])'
</span></span><span><span>nominal
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Sounds good, right?

They have a different amount of possible states and they don’t line up.</p><p>Here is my empirical experience:</p><table><thead><tr><th><code>ProcessInfo.thermalState</code></th><th><code>powermetrics</code></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>nominal</td><td>nominal</td></tr><tr><td><strong>fair</strong></td><td><strong>moderate</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>fair</strong></td><td><strong>heavy</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><p>I never managed to hit these states, so I don’t know if they match, but they’re technically defined:</p><table><thead><tr><th><code>ProcessInfo.thermalState</code></th><th><code>powermetrics</code></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>serious</td><td>trapping</td></tr><tr><td>critical</td><td>sleeping</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In practice, when my Mac starts getting hot, from the <code>powermetrics</code> perspective it goes into <code>moderate</code>, and when it starts throttling, it goes into <code>heavy</code>. The problem is that with <code>ProcessInfo</code>, both are covered by the <code>fair</code> state, so it’s not really useful to know when the Mac is <em>actually</em> throttling. ☹️</p><p>I thought maybe this was an iOS vs macOS thing?

I called it <a href="https://github.com/angristan/MacThrottle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">MacThrottle</a>.</p><p>I built a simple SwiftUI app for the menu bar that shows me the status in a superbly original thermometer icon. The thermometer is filled depending on the thermal state, and its color changes from green to red. I have like 20 menu bar icons and they’re all monochromatic, so the color in the thermometer is very subtle to keep things consistent.</p><p>The app is a simple SwiftUI app. Apple provides a scene called <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/MenuBarExtra" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">MenuBarExtra</a> to render a menu bar control. It was simpler than I expected! To make it a pure menu bar app with no dock icon, you just need to set <code>LSUIElement</code> to <code>true</code> in <code>Info.plist</code>.</p><figure><img src="https://stanislas.blog/2025/12/macos-thermal-throttling-app/mac-throttle-old.png" alt="An early version of MacThrottle"><figcaption>An early version of MacThrottle, just reporting the thermal state</figcaption></figure><h3 id="first-approach-root-helper-for-powermetrics">First approach: root helper for <code>powermetrics</code> <span><a href="#first-approach-root-helper-for-powermetrics" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h3><p>I explained the various approaches to get the thermal pressure level in the previous section. But when I was building the app, I discovered later on that <code>thermald</code> was publishing the thermal state to <code>notifyd</code>. So at first, I thought I had to use <code>powermetrics</code> to get useful thermal state changes. Since that unfortunately requires root access, the app needed root access too.</p><p>To reduce the scope of what runs as root, I did not run the app itself as root. Instead, the app does not work by default, but it gives you the option to install a helper. It does this through an AppleScript <code>with administrator privileges</code> to prompt for access.</p><p>The helper is just a bash script run as a launchd daemon:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="xml"><span><span>➜  ~ cat /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.macthrottle.thermal-monitor.plist

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-first_letter="I">
		<p>If someone had told me 12 months ago what was going to happen this past year, I wouldn’t have believed them. Skipping swiftly past all the political, economic and social turmoil, I come to the interface changes brought in macOS Tahoe with Liquid Glass. After three months of strong feedback during beta-testing, I was disappointed when Tahoe was released on 15 September to see how little had been addressed. When 26.1 followed on 3 November it had only regressed, and 26.2 has done nothing. Here I summarise my opinions on where Tahoe’s overhaul has gone wrong.</p>
<h4>What goes round</h4>
<p>Almost all the content displayed in windows is best suited to rectangular views. Images, video, webpages and other text crave areas bounded by right angles. Gentle rounding on the corners, as in Sequoia, is fine, but the significantly increased radius enforced in Tahoe is a misfit. This either leads to cropping of contents, or reduction in size of the view and wasted space.</p>

<p>Among Apple’s claims for this new look is greater consistency. But two windows in the same app, both created using SwiftUI, can’t even share a common radius, as shown below in Providable running in macOS 26.2.</p>

<h4>Out of control</h4>
<p>Tahoe has also increased the size of its controls, without using that to improve their clarity. The best way to see that is in my Mallyshag demo app.</p>

<p>This looks good in Sequoia above, but becomes a mess in Tahoe (below) because of its changed control dimensions.</p>

<p>Those three buttons are significantly wider, so now overlap one another and are wider than the text box below. The user sees no benefit to this, though, as the text within the controls is identical.</p>
<h4>Iconoclasm</h4>
<p>App icons need to be both distinguishable and readily recalled. The first ensures that we can tell one from another, and relies on all the visual cues we can muster, including colours, form and content. Tahoe enforces a rule that everything in the icon must be fitted inside its uniform square with rounded corners, so restricting cues to colours and contents. As a result, the icons of many bundled and other Apple apps have become harder to distinguish in a crowded Dock. Some, including Apple’s Developer app and the App Store, are indistinguishable, while others have degenerated into vague blotches.</p>

<h4>Whiteout</h4>
<p>In real life, whiteouts are dangerous because they’re so disorienting. There’s no horizon, no features in the landscape, and no clues to navigation. We see and work best in visual environments that are rich in colour and tonal contrasts. Tahoe has continued a trend for Light Mode to be bleached-out white, and Dark Mode to be a moonless night. Seeing where controls, views and contents start and end is difficult, and leaves them suspended in the whiteout.</p>

<p>In light mode, with default transparency, tool icons and text are clearly distinguished tonally, as are some controls including buttons and checkboxes. However, text entry fields are indistinguishable from the background, and there’s a general lack of demarcation, particularly between controls and the list view below.</p>

<h4>Wet-on-wet</h4>
<p>This technique is used in watercolours to merge layers of colour diffusely, and the best description of some of the results of transparency in Liquid Glass. My examples speak for themselves, and are drawn first from Apple’s own design for System Settings.</p>

<p>Out of focus the selected row is less overwhelming, but traffic lights and title have dissipated in grey blur.</p>
<p>I’m sure that, in the right place and time, transparency effects of Liquid Glass can be visually pleasing. Not only is this the wrong time and place, but those with visual impairment can no longer remove or even reduce these effects, as the <strong>Reduce Transparency</strong> control in Accessibility settings no longer reduces transparency in any useful way. That was one of the regressions in 26.1 that hasn’t been addressed in 26.2.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>macOS Tahoe’s visual interface:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fits largely rectangular contents into windows with excessively rounded corners.</li>
<li>Enlarges controls without any functional benefit.</li>
<li>Results in app icons being more uniform, thus less distinguishable and memorable.</li>
<li>Fails to distinguish tools, controls and other interface elements using differences in tone, so making them harder to use.</li>
<li>Makes a mess where transparent layers are superimposed, and won’t reduce transparency when that’s needed to render its interface more accessible.</li>
</ul>
<p>Maybe this is because I’m getting older, but that gives me the benefit of having experienced Apple’s older interfaces, with their exceptional quality and functionality.</p>

    <div><p>Liposuction and plastic surgery aren’t often mentioned in the same breath as cancer.</p>

<p>But they are the inspiration for a new approach to treating cancer that uses engineered fat cells to deprive tumors of nutrition.</p>

<p>Researchers at UC San Francisco used the gene editing technology CRISPR to turn ordinary white fat cells into “beige” fat cells, which voraciously consume calories to make heat. The work is funded by the National Institute of Health (NIH).</p>

<p>Then, they implanted them near tumors the way plastic surgeons inject fat from one part of the body to plump up another. The fat cells scarfed up all the nutrients, starving most of the tumor cells to death. The approach even worked when the fat cells were implanted in mice far from the sites of their tumors.</p>

<p>The approach's reliance on a common procedure could speed its use as a new form of cellular therapy.</p>

<p>“We already routinely remove fat cells with liposuction and put them back via plastic surgery,” said <a href="https://profiles.ucsf.edu/nadav.ahituv">Nadav Ahituv</a>, PhD, director of the <a href="https://humangenetics.ucsf.edu/">UCSF Institute for Human Genetics</a> and professor in the Department of Bioengineering and Therapeutic Sciences. He is the senior author of the paper, which appears Feb. 4 in <em><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-024-02551-2">Nature Biotechnology</a></em>. “These fat cells can be easily manipulated in the lab and safely placed back into the body, making them an attractive platform for cellular therapy, including for cancer.”</p>

<figure>

</figure>


<h2><br>
Cold therapy sparks a new idea</h2>

<p>Ahituv and his post-doc at the time, Hai Nguyen, PhD, were aware of studies that showed exposure to cold could suppress cancer in mice. One experiment even showed it could help a patient with non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Scientists concluded that the cancer cells were starving because the cold was activating brown fat cells.</p>

<p>But cold therapy isn’t a viable option for cancer patients with fragile health. So, Ahituv and Nguyen turned to the idea of using beige fat, wagering that they could engineer it to burn enough calories, even in the absence of cold, to deprive tumors of the fuel they needed to grow.</p>

<p>Nguyen, who is the first author of the paper, used CRISPR to activate genes that are dormant in white fat cells but are active in brown fat cells, in the hopes of finding the ones that would transform the white fat cells into the hungriest of beige fat cells.</p>

<p>A gene called UCP1 rose to the top. Nguyen grew UCP1 beige fat cells and cancer cells in a “trans-well” petri dish. The cancer cells were on the bottom and the fat cells were above them in separate compartments that kept the cells apart but forced them to share nutrients. The results were shocking.</p>

<p>“In our very first trans-well experiment, very few cancer cells survived. We thought we had messed something up – we were sure it was a mistake,” Ahituv recalled. “So, we repeated it multiple times, and we kept seeing the same effect.”</p>

<p>The beige fat cells held sway over two different types of breast cancer cells, as well as colon, pancreatic and prostate cancer cells.</p>

	<p><strong>Fat cells are added:</strong> When fat cells were implanted in the breast, far fewer cancer cells were able to multiply. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>Cancer is no match for hungry fat</h2>

<p>But the researchers still didn’t know if the beige fat cells would work in a more realistic context. So, they turned to fat organoids, which are coherent clumps of cells grown in a dish, to see if they could beat tumor cells when they were implanted next to tumors in mice. The approach worked against breast cancer, as well as pancreatic and prostate cancer cells. The cancer cells starved as the fat cells gobbled up all the available nutrients.</p>

<p>Once implanted into mice that were genetically predisposed to develop cancer, the beige fat cells were so powerful that they suppressed pancreatic and breast tumors. Beige fat even worked when it was implanted far away from the breast cancer cells.</p>

<figure>

</figure>


<p>To see how the fat cells would work in human tissue, Ahituv and Nguyen teamed up with <a href="https://profiles.ucsf.edu/jennifer.rosenbluth">Jennifer Rosenbluth</a>, MD, PhD, a breast cancer specialist at UCSF. Rosenbluth had amassed a library of breast cancer tissue from mastectomies containing both fat cells and cancer cells.</p>

<p>“Because the breast has a lot of fat, we could get fat from the same patient, modify the fat and grow it in a single trans-well experiment with that patient’s own breast cancer cells,” Ahituv said.</p>

<p>These same-patient beige fat cells outcompeted breast cancer cells in petri dishes – and when they were implanted together in mouse models.</p>

<p>Knowing that cancers have preferred diets, the researchers engineered fat just to eat certain nutrients. Certain forms of pancreatic cancer, for example, rely on uridine when glucose is scarce. So, they programmed the fat cells to eat just uridine, and they easily outcompeted the pancreatic cancer cells. This suggested that fat could be adapted to any cancer’s dietary preferences.</p>

<h2>A new approach to living cell therapy</h2>

<p>Fat cells have many advantages when it comes to living cell therapies, according to Ahituv. They are easy to obtain from patients. They grow well in the laboratory and can be engineered to express different genes and take on different biological roles. And they behave well once they are put back into the body, not straying from the location where they’re implanted and playing nice with the immune system.</p>

<p>It’s a conclusion supported by decades of plastic surgery.</p>

<p>“With fat cells, there’s less interaction with the environment, so there’s very little worry of the cells leaking out into the body, where they might cause problems,” Ahituv said.</p>

<p>Fat cells can also be programmed to emit signals or carry out more complicated tasks.</p>

<p>And their ability to defeat cancer even when they are not right next to tumors could prove invaluable for treating hard-to-reach cancers like glioblastoma, which affects the brain, as well as many other diseases.</p>

<p>“We think these cells could also be designed to sense glucose in the bloodstream and release insulin, for diabetes, or suck up iron in diseases where there’s excessive iron like hemochromatosis,” Ahituv said. “The sky’s the limit for these fat cells.”</p>

	<h3>A pioneering scientist is lost too soon</h3>

	<p>The discovery of how hungry fat cells could suppress cancer began in 2021, when Hai Nguyen, PhD, joined Ahituv’s lab. Nguyen had years of experience working with fat cells in the laboratory. But he wasn’t aware of their cancer-fighting potential until an experiment pitting engineered beige fat cells against cancer cells tipped them off.</p>

	<p>Amazed at how the beige fat was able to starve the tumors, they tested the engineered cells against all sorts of cancers in the lab. The project grew to include other scientists and cancer specialists at UCSF and across the country, offering a proof of principle that the approach could work against a wide range of cancers.</p>

	<p>Nguyen moved to UT Austin to start his own lab in January 2024 but passed away suddenly in November before he could finish the final experiments. The paper, of which he is the first author, is dedicated to him.</p>

	<p>“Hai was one of the most amazing post-docs I’ll ever have and a great friend,” Ahituv said. “We are heartbroken. He has left us with this incredible gift of a technology that could truly change lives.”</p>

Top <a href="https://lfw.org.uk/course/introduction-to-ai/?ref=kapwing.com"><u>film schools</u></a> now offer courses on the use and ethics of AI in film production, and the world’s best-known brands are utilizing AI in their creative process — albeit <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/design/advertising/devastating-graphic-shows-just-how-bad-the-coca-cola-christmas-ad-really-is?ref=kapwing.com"><u>with mixed results</u></a>.</p><p>Sadly, others are gaming the novelty of AI’s prompt-and-go content, using these engines to churn out vast quantities of AI “slop” — the “spam” of the video-first age. </p><p>Wiktionary defines a <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/slopper?ref=kapwing.com"><u>slopper</u></a> as “Someone who is overreliant on generative AI tools such as ChatGPT; a producer of AI slop.” Along with the proliferation of “brainrot” videos online, sloppers are making it tough for principled and talented creators to get their videos seen.</p>

<p>The main point of AI slop and brainrot videos is to grab your attention, and this type of content seems harder and harder to avoid.

We also created a new YouTube account to record the number of AI slop and brainrot videos among the first 500 YouTube Shorts we cycled through to get an idea of the new-user experience.</p><h2 id="key-findings">Key Findings</h2><ul><li><strong>Spain’s</strong> trending AI slop channels have a combined <strong>20.22 million subscribers</strong> — the most of any country.</li><li>In <strong>South Korea</strong>, the trending AI slop channels have amassed <strong>8.45 billion views</strong>.</li><li>The AI slop channel with the most views is India’s <strong><em>Bandar Apna Dost</em></strong> (<strong>2.07 billion views</strong>).<ul><li>The channel has estimated annual earnings of <strong>$4,251,500</strong>.</li></ul></li><li><strong>U.S.</strong>-based slop channel <strong><em>Cuentos Facinantes </em></strong>[sic] has the most subscribers of any slop channel globally (<strong>5.95 million</strong>).</li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g75A8vi9PVU&amp;ref=kapwing.com">Brainrot videos</a> account for around <strong>33%</strong> of the first 500 YouTube shorts on a new user’s feed.</li></ul><h2 id="spanish-and-south-korean-ai-slop-channels-have-most-devoted-viewerships">Spanish and South Korean AI Slop Channels Have Most Devoted Viewerships</h2><p>First, we analyzed the 100 top trending video channels in every country to see how prevalent AI slop has become locally.</p><p>We found that Spain has 20.22 million AI slop channel subscribers among its trending channels. This is despite Spain having fewer AI slop channels (eight) among its top 100 channels than countries including Pakistan (20), Egypt (14), South Korea (11) and the U.S. (nine).

Two other Spanish channels with over 3.5 million subscribers each focus on comedy/brainrot shorts.</p><p>While Spain’s eight trending AI slop channels may have the most subscribers, South Korea’s 11 trenders have the most views: some 8.45 billion in total.

Using an average rate of revenue per 1,000 views, <em>Bandar Apna Dost</em> has an estimated annual revenue of $4.25 million.</p><p>“The genius is going to lie whether you did it in a way that was profoundly original or creative,” <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/youtube-thinks-ai-is-its-next-big-bang/?ref=kapwing.com"><u>Mohan told Wired</u></a>. “Just because the content is 75 percent AI generated doesn't make it any better or worse than a video that’s 5 percent AI generated.

As <a href="https://robhorning.substack.com/p/born-sloppy?ref=kapwing.com"><u>Rob Horning</u></a> points out, the idea that only <em>some</em> AI media is slop propagates the idea that the rest is legitimate and the technology’s proliferation is inevitable.</p><p>Part of the threat of AI slop and some forms of brainrot is in how they have been normalized and may come across as harmless fun. But slop and brainrot prey on the laziest areas of our mental faculties. Researchers have shown how the “<a href="https://phys.org/news/2025-02-exposure-deepfakes-international.html?ref=kapwing.com"><u>illusory truth effect</u></a>” makes people more likely to believe in claims or imagery the more often they encounter it. AI tools make it easy for bad-faith actors to construct a fake enemy or situation that supports their underlying political beliefs or goals. <a href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.21203/rs.3.rs-6471307/v1?ref=kapwing.com"><u>Seeing is believing</u></a>, studies have shown, even when the viewer has been explicitly told that a video is fake.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, “information of any kind, in enough quantities, becomes noise,” writes researcher and artist <a href="https://mail.cyberneticforests.com/slop-infrastructures-1-2/?ref=kapwing.com"><u>Eryk Salvaggio</u></a>. The prevalence of AI slop is “a symptom of information exhaustion, and an increased human dependency on algorithmic filters to sort the world on our behalf.” And, as <a href="https://dougshapiro.substack.com/p/trust-is-the-new-oil?ref=kapwing.com"><u>Doug Shapiro</u></a> notes, as this noise drowns out the signal on the web, including social networks, the value of <em>trust</em> will rise — and so will corporate and political efforts to fabricate and manipulate trust.</p><p>And this is why, rather than attending film school to study AI techniques, it may be more valuable for creators and consumers alike — especially those still in school — to double down on Media Studies.</p><h3 id="methodology-sources">Methodology &amp; Sources</h3><p>We manually researched the top 100 trending YouTube channels in every country (on playboard.co) to isolate the AI slop channels.&nbsp;</p><p>We then used socialblade.com to retrieve the number of views, subscribers and estimated yearly revenue (using the midpoint values) for these channels.</p><p>We aggregated these figures for each country's AI slop channels to get an idea of their popularity.</p><p>In addition, we created a new YouTube account and recorded the number of AI slop and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g75A8vi9PVU&amp;ref=kapwing.com">brainrot videos</a> among the first 500 YouTube Shorts we cycled through to get an idea of the new-user experience.</p><p>Data is correct as of October 2025.</p>

        <div data-bi-area="body_article" data-bi-id="post_page_body_article">
            <p>Many languages¹ that have exceptions also have a <code>finally</code> clause, so you can write</p>
<pre>try {
    ⟦ stuff ⟧
} finally {
    always();
}
</pre>
<p>A quick checks shows that this control structure exists in Java, C#, Python, JavaScript, but not C++.</p>
<p>C++ says, “We have <code>try</code>…finally at home.”</p>
<p>In C++, the way to get a block of code to execute when control leaves a block is to put it in a destructor, because destructors run when control leaves a block. This is the trick used by the Windows Implementation Library’s <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/wil/wiki/RAII-resource-wrappers#wilscope_exit"> wil::<wbr>scope_exit</a> function: The lambda you provide is placed inside a custom object whose destructor runs the lambda.</p>
<pre>auto ensure_cleanup = wil::scope_exit([&amp;] { always(); });

⟦ stuff ⟧
</pre>
<p>Although the principle is the same, there are some quirks in how each language treats the case where the <code>finally</code> or destructor itself throws an exception.</p>
<p>If control leaves the guarded block without an exception, then any uncaught exception that occurs in the <code>finally</code> block or the destructor is thrown from the <code>try</code> block. All the languages seem to agree on this.</p>
<p>If control leaves the guarded block with an exception, and the <code>finally</code> block or destructor <i>also</i> throws an exception, then the behavior varies by language.</p>
<ul>
<li>In Java, Python, JavaScript, and C# an exception thrown from a <code>finally</code> block overwrites the original exception, and the original exception is lost. <b>Update</b>: Adam Rosenfield points out that Python 3.2 now saves the original exception as the context of the new exception, but it is still the new exception that is thrown.</li>
<li>In C++, an exception thrown from a destructor triggers automatic program termination if the destructor is running due to an exception.²</li>
</ul>
<p>So C++ gives you the ability to run code when control leaves a scope, but your code had better not allow an exception to escape if you know what’s good for you.</p>
<p>¹ The Microsoft compiler also supports the <code>__try</code> and <code>__finally</code> keywords for structured exception handling. These are, however, intended for C code. Don’t use them in C++ code because <a title="Can I throw a C++ exception from a structured exception?" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20170728-00/?p=96706"> they interact with C++ exceptions in sometimes-confusing ways</a>.</p>
<p>² This is why <code>wil::<wbr>scope_exit</code> documents that it will terminate the process if the lambda throws an exception. There is an alternate function <code>wil::<wbr>scope_<wbr>exit_<wbr>log</code> that logs and then ignores exceptions that are thrown from the lambda. There is no variation that gives you Java-like behavior.</p>

<p>👋 <strong>Hello!</strong> If you print this page, you’ll get a nifty calendar that displays all of the year’s dates on a single page. It will automatically fit on a single sheet of paper of any size. For best results, adjust your print settings to landscape orientation and disable the header and footer.</p>
<p>Take in the year all at once. Fold it up and carry it with you. Jot down your notes on it. Plan things out and observe the passage of time. Above all else, be kind to others.</p>
<p>Looking for 2026? <a href="https://neatnik.net/calendar/?year=2026">Here you go!</a></p>
