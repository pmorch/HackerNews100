In early February, MIT followed its written policy and conducted an internal, confidential review.

We therefore would like to set the record straight and share our view that at this point the findings reported in this paper should not be relied on in academic or public discussions of these topics.”</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>###</span></p>

                  <p>There's no question that it's tougher now to get into the U.S., whether from Canada or another country via pre-clearance or via a land crossing, and there can be significant differences among airports and land crossings. Canadians are unique because they are visa exempt and CBP feels particularly emboldened to reassess their admissibility every time they enter. The keys are to avoid bad pre-clearance offices and land crossings and even more importantly to carry the right paperwork, which varies depending on the specific status being sought. There is also a huge difference between seeking entry as a visitor versus seeking entry as a worker with a visa, with the former much more challenging now.</p>

                  <p>The concerns on the part of CBP when someone is seeking admission as a B-1 business visitor are the appropriateness of the applicant's proposed activities and the applicant's ties to home/intent to return home (Canada). So you want to keep in your back pocket documents that address these concerns, such as a foreign lease agreement, foreign pay statement, and evidence of the purpose, such as a printout of the conference being attended or a letter of invitation. It's also really important to be prepared to provide specifics about your purpose, who, what, when, and where.</p>

I don't think you should do that.</p><p>We actually hired some Canadian talent -- we just used an EOR in Canada. The EOR cost us about $600 a month per head as their cut, but it was worth it to get the excellent developers we have through that deal.</p><p>The reason why some/many firms would filter out anyone saying NO to (1) is that getting a visa sponsored requires significant work of a specialized nature and our company certainly is not equipped to do that because we don't have people who have the time and skills to deal with the insane demands of our government to obtain the necessary document (This is not a new or partisan issue btw, I remember losing a great developer in the Obama years due to the feds giving her the run-around).</p></div></td></tr>

The rest of the time, I'm reviewing applications and responding to emails from staff and clients. It sounds pretty mundane but despite the stresses of the job and the challenges associated with the new administration, I still really enjoy what I do because I have a wonderful team and I get to interact with really smart people doing super interesting things and help them realize their dream of living and working in the U.S.</p>

There's no cap on marriage-based green cards.</p><p>* Processing times for many green cards (i.e. for people who have already qualified, but just need the physical green card), are 12-24 months.</p><p>* USCIS still expects many applications to be sent by mail. Some applications (like O-1s, EB-1s) require hundreds of pages of evidence, and it all needs to be printed out on 8.5x11" paper, for USCIS to scan it in on B+W scanners. This means that there is no error checking (e.g. on fee amounts), and if you have made a mistake, you might not know about it for weeks. Also, it means your petition cannot include working hyperlinks, webpages, or videos - the USCIS officer judges the petition by scrolling through a 400+ page PDF.</p><p>* The 'standard' post-graduate work visa is the H-1B. It's entirely lottery-based, not merit-based, and typically there are 400,000+ people competing for 85,000 visas. Many qualified people are forced to leave the US each year because they didn't get selected in the lottery.</p></div></td></tr>

                  <p>Hi Peter, thank you for this AMA.
I've been a green card holder for 1 year as the result of working for big tech in the US, originally via getting a L1-B 3.5 years ago. I'm planning on moving back to my home country in Europe permanently. Is there any way I can keep my green card or at least keep it for longer in case I start a startup in Europe and want to also have a US presence? I'm a Portuguese citizen.</p>

                  <p>Education is irrelevant.  A PhD in and of itself doesn't help but it usually means that the individual has published, engaged in original research/work, etc. but someone can have published, engaged in original research/work, etc. without a PhD or any degree.  So it's about what the individual has done, not his or her education. That being said, there's no question that USCIS's view of an O-1 petition is colored by the applicant's education and there's sort of a presumption that someone with a PhD qualifies for an O-1.</p>

                  <p>Is the correct term "Expedites", or "Expeditions"? Legal terminology seems to break language rules... The term for some (plural) things being expedited would be expeditions, but it seems from your response that, in legal terms, this would be expedites. This doesn't sound right. No source I could find agrees with the term "Expedites" as "plural of expedite". It generally returns something on the lines of "A third-person singular simple present indicative form of the verb "expedite.""</p>

                  <p>This really depends on the reason for the 221(g) and the applicant's country of citizenship or birth. Unfortunately, for those from certain countries, such as Iran and Russia, it has not been uncommon for such applications to go into a black hole and take 1-2 years.

                  <p>Yes. I still think that those with student or work visas or green cards should travel internationally.  It's just a question of being smart and carrying the right documents.  The right documents will vary depending on the status so I can't give a list but I'd recommend having a brief consultation with an attorney.  Many like myself won't charge for a 15-minute consultation, which is all that this should take.</p>

<p dir="auto">An experiment to replace Node-REDs existing NodeJS backend with an Erlang equivalent that is 100% compatible[1] to existing flow code.</p>
<p dir="auto">The goal is bring the advantages of low-code visual flow-based programming to a programming language that is designed for message passing and concurrency from the ground up, hence Erlang.</p>
<p dir="auto">[1] = 100% won't be possible since function nodes that are coded in Javascript aren't supported (or aren't intended to be supported - unless someone has a workaround)</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Why?</h2><a id="user-content-why" aria-label="Permalink: Why?" href="#why"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://nodered.org/" rel="nofollow">Node-RED</a> is a amazing[*] tool for creating flows that describe concurrent processing, it is just a shame the NodeJS is single threaded. So why not use something that is multi-process from the ground up? Concurrency is guaranteed and included.</p>
<p dir="auto">Also Erlang isn't the most understandable of programming language - unless one has fallen into in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obelix" rel="nofollow">cauldron</a> of Prolog, spiced with Lisp.</p>
<p dir="auto">So won't it be great to have the simplicity of low-code visual flow based programming and the performance (and concurrency) of Erlang?</p>
<p dir="auto">[*] = amazing in the sense of <em>extendability</em> (Nodes can easily be added and developed by third parties), <em>understandability</em> (Node-RED <a href="https://blog.openmindmap.org/blog/pipes-wires-nodes" rel="nofollow">terminology</a> is straightforward) and <em>usability</em> (once a rectangle becomes a unit of computation and a line becomes a pathway for data flow)</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Development Strategy</h2><a id="user-content-development-strategy" aria-label="Permalink: Development Strategy" href="#development-strategy"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">My development process is best described as <a href="https://github.com/gorenje/erlang-red/blob/main/DevelopmentStrategy.md">flow driven development</a> based around a set of <a href="https://github.com/gorenje/erlang-red/blob/main/prive/testflows">test flows</a> to ensure that node functionality is implemented correctly - meaning that it matches the existing Node-RED functionality.</p>

<p dir="auto">There is nothing stopping anyone from creating a complete node in Elixir provided there is a Erlang "node-wrapper", i.e., a bit of Erlang code in the <a href="https://github.com/gorenje/erlang-red/blob/main/src/nodes">src/nodes</a> directory that references the Elixir node.</p>
<p dir="auto">The initial example <a href="https://github.com/gorenje/erlang-red/blob/42f10112baac5a5f916ecd805eafc87382632dec/src/nodes/ered_node_markdown.erl#L38">markdown node</a> is an Erlang node that references Elixir code. I also wrote an Elixir wrapper function whereby I could have just as easily referenced Earmark directly from the Erlang code. That was a stylist choice.</p>
<p dir="auto">I intend to use Elixir code for importing Elixir libraries to the project and less coding nodes in Elixir. I simply prefer Erlang syntax. But each to their own :)</p>

<p dir="auto">All static frontend code (for the Node-RED flow editor) and the test flow files in <code>priv/testflows</code> are bundled into the release.</p>
<p dir="auto">Cowboy server will started on port 8080 unless the <code>PORT</code> env variable is set.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Fly.io Deployment</h2><a id="user-content-flyio-deployment" aria-label="Permalink: Fly.io Deployment" href="#flyio-deployment"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">A sample Dockerfile <code>Dockerfile.fly</code> is provided to allow for easy launching of an instance as a fly application.
The provided shell script (<code>fly_er.sh</code>) sets some common expected parameters for the launch.
Advanced users may wish to examine the <code>fly launch</code> line therein and adjust for their requirements.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Heroku Deployment</h2><a id="user-content-heroku-deployment" aria-label="Permalink: Heroku Deployment" href="#heroku-deployment"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Using the container stack at heroku, deployment becomes a <code>git push heroku</code> after the usual heroku setup:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>heroku login</code> --&gt; <code>heroku git:remote -a &lt;app name&gt;</code> --&gt; <code>heroku stack:set container</code> --&gt; <code>git push heroku</code></li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">However the <a href="https://github.com/gorenje/erlang-red/blob/main/Dockerfile.heroku">Dockerfile.heroku</a> does not start the flow editor, the image is designed to run a set of flows, in this case (at time of writing) a simple website with a single page.</p>
<p dir="auto">Basically this <a href="https://github.com/gorenje/erlang-red/blob/main/priv/testflows/flow.499288ab4007ac6a.json">flow</a> is the <a href="https://red-erik.org/" rel="nofollow">red-erik.org</a> site.</p>
<p dir="auto">The image does this by setting the following ENV variables:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>COMPUTEFLOW</code>=<code>499288ab4007ac6a</code> - flow to be used. This can also be a comma separated list of flows that are all started.</li>
<li><code>DISABLE_FLOWEDITOR</code>=<code>YES</code> - any value will do, if set the flow editor is disabled.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Also be aware that Erlang-RED supports a <code>PORT</code> env variable to specifying the port upon which Cowboy will listen on for connections. The default is 8080.</p>
<p dir="auto">Heroku uses this to specify the port to connect for a docker image so that its load balancer can get it right.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Example</h2><a id="user-content-example" aria-label="Permalink: Example" href="#example"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/gorenje/erlang-red/blob/main/.images/erlang-red.gif"><img src="https://github.com/gorenje/erlang-red/raw/main/.images/erlang-red.gif" alt="img" data-animated-image=""></a></p>
<p dir="auto">What the gif shows is executing a <a href="https://flowhub.org/f/ea246f68766c8630" rel="nofollow">simple flow</a> using Erlang as a backend. The flow demonstrates the difference in the switch node of 'check all' or 'stop at first match'.</p>
<p dir="auto">All nodes are are processes- that is shown on the left in the terminal window.</p>
<p dir="auto">This example is extremely trivial but it does lay the groundwork for expansion.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Testing</h2><a id="user-content-testing" aria-label="Permalink: Testing" href="#testing"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">To create unit tests for this, Node-RED frontend has been extended with a
"Create Test Case" button on the export dialog:</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/gorenje/erlang-red/blob/main/.images/create-test-case.png"><img src="https://github.com/gorenje/erlang-red/raw/main/.images/create-test-case.png" alt="img"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Test flows are stored in the <a href="https://github.com/gorenje/erlang-red/blob/main/priv/testflows">testflows</a> directory and will be picked up the next time <code>make eunit-test</code> is called. In this way it is possible to create unit tests visually.</p>
<p dir="auto">Flow tests can also be tested within the flow editor, for more details see below.</p>
<p dir="auto">The flow test suite is now maintained in a <a href="https://github.com/gorenje/erlang-red-flow-testsuite">separate</a> repository but is duplicated here.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Assert Nodes</h2><a id="user-content-assert-nodes" aria-label="Permalink: Assert Nodes" href="#assert-nodes"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">To better support testing of flows, two new nodes have been created:</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/gorenje/erlang-red/blob/main/.images/assert-nodes.png"><img src="https://github.com/gorenje/erlang-red/raw/main/.images/assert-nodes.png" alt="img"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">"Assert Failed" node cases unit tests to fail if a message reaches it, regardless of any message values. It's basically the same as a <code>assert(false)</code> call. The intention is to ensure that specific parts of a flow aren't reached.</p>
<p dir="auto">The second node (in green) is an equivalent to a change node except it contains test on attributes of the message object. Possible tests include 'equal', 'match', 'unset' and the respective inverses. Here the intention is that a message passes through is tested for specific values else the unit test fails.</p>
<p dir="auto">These nodes are necessary since there is no other way to test whether flow is working or not.</p>
<p dir="auto">Also remember these flow tests are designed to ensure the Erlang backend is correctly implementing node functionality. The purpose of these nodes is <em>not</em> to ensure that a flow is correct, rather that the <em>functionality</em> of implemented nodes works and continues to work correctly.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Visual Unit Testing</h2><a id="user-content-visual-unit-testing" aria-label="Permalink: Visual Unit Testing" href="#visual-unit-testing"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">My plan is to create test flows that represent specific NodeRED functionality that needs to be implemented by Erlang-RED. This provides regression testing and todos for the implementation.</p>
<p dir="auto">I created a keyboard shortcut for creating and storing these test flows from the flow editor directly. However I was still use the terminal to execute tests <code>make eunit-test</code> - which  became painful. So instead I pulled this testing into Node-RED, as the gif demonstrates:</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/gorenje/erlang-red/blob/main/.images/unit-testing-inside-nodered.gif"><img src="https://github.com/gorenje/erlang-red/raw/main/.images/unit-testing-inside-nodered.gif" alt="img" data-animated-image=""></a></p>
<p dir="auto">What the gif shows is my list of unit tests, which at the press of a button, can all be tested. Notifications for each test shows the result. In addition, the tree list shows which tests failed/succeed (red 'x' or green check). Also tests can be executed individually so that failures can be checked individually.</p>
<p dir="auto">The best bit though is that all errors are pushed to the debug panel and from there I get directly to the node causing the error. Visual unit testing is completely integrated into Erlang-RED.</p>
<p dir="auto">My intention is to create many small flows that represent functionality that needs to be implemented by Erlang-RED. These unit tests shows the compatibility to Node-RED and less the correctness of the Erlang code.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Contributing</h2><a id="user-content-contributing" aria-label="Permalink: Contributing" href="#contributing"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Contributions very much welcome in the form of Erlang code or as Node-RED test-flows, ideally with the Erlang implementation. Elixir code is also welcome, only it has its own <a href="https://github.com/gorenje/erlang-red-elixir-helpers">home</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Each test flow should test exactly one feature and use the assert nodes to check correctness of expected results. Tests can also be pending to indicate that the corresponding Erlang functionality is still missing.</p>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Branch Technology</h2><a id="user-content-branch-technology" aria-label="Permalink: Branch Technology" href="#branch-technology"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">To branch or not to branch, that isn't really a question. I'm currently working directly on <code>main</code> but ensure that all tests succeed before pushing, so <code>main</code> branch will always work. Locally I work with branches but have no desire to make those branches public since I'm working on my own.</p>
<p dir="auto">Versioning is completely random and has little or no meaning at the moment. I prefer to use <a href="https://github.com/gorenje/erlang-red/blob/main/MILESTONES.md">Milestones</a> since these are arrived at and are not planned, I don't know when the next milestone will be reached.</p>
<p dir="auto">If this project becomes more collaborative or a "production ready piece of software", more certainty will be applied to the development process, i.e., semantic version numbers will introduced.</p>
<p dir="auto">I'm more than happy to deal with conflicts if someone developed something on a branch and it doesn't merge - I understand that multiple direct pushes to <code>main</code> everyday isn't the done thing but I don't like to have code lying around for weeks on end, not being merged because it's not on a release schedule.</p>
<p dir="auto">Coding is a creative process, creativity cannot be planned. Imagine Van Gogh working according to a release plan.</p>

<p>I recently attended <a href="https://rustweek.org/">RustWeek</a> (which was totally awesome) and the talks by Alex Crichton (on the history of Rust) and Pietro Albini (on the importance of error messages) inspired me to do a little archaeology into the way Rust compiler messages have evolved over time.</p>

<p>I wrote a script that downloaded all stable Rust releases all the way back to 1.0<sup id="fnref:rustup" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:rustup" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, executed each stable version of the compiler on a set of small programs containing an error and gathered the compiler standard (error) output.</p>

<p>The widget below visualizes how the error messages evolved over time. You can use the select box to examine different Rust programs to see their error:</p>




<p>There are a couple of interesting things to note:</p>

<ul>
  <li>First and foremost, the error messages are simply <em>great</em>. If you have used Rust previously, this probably isn’t too surprising. Even Rust <code>1.0.0</code> contained pretty solid error reporting, and it got much better over time.</li>
  <li>Rust <code>1.2.0</code> introduced numerical <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/error_codes/error-index.html">error codes</a>. Edit: they were actually added in <code>1.0.0</code>, just that this specific error did not have a code until <code>1.2.0</code>, as was pointed out to me by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1knzzqa/comment/msnlx2r">Steve Klabnik</a>.</li>
  <li>Rust <code>1.26.0</code> introduced colorful error messages. It sounds like a small change, but you can see what an improvement it makes! It also added the <code>rustc --explain &lt;error-code&gt;</code> hint.</li>
  <li>The error messages sometimes went a bit back and forth in different Rust versions, which is a bit funny. For example, the <code>error: aborting due to 2 previous errors</code> has switched to <code>...previous error(s)</code> in <code>1.19.0</code> and then back to <code>...2 previous errors</code> in <code>1.20.0</code>, which seems like an unintended change in <code>1.19.0</code>. Sometimes the difference is only in a single space, which is not even visible in the visualization above.</li>
  <li>The error spans are also continuously being improved between rustc versions. My favourite example is the <code>Wrong field</code> program change in <code>1.87.0</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>But I think that ultimately, the most interesting thing about this is the evolution process of these messages itself, which demonstrates that a lot of effort has to be put into the messages to make them <em>really good</em>. To someone, it might seem like these messages are somehow automatically derived from the compilation process, and we get them “for free”, but that couldn’t be further from the truth. It is the result of a continuous design, implementation, review and testing effort that has been performed by hundreds of individual contributors over the span of more than ten years. Thank you to everyone who has worked on the Rust compiler and contributed to these awesome error messages!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://sci-hub.se/sci-net">https://sci-hub.se/sci-net</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44004625">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

                <p>
                    I regularly receive requests from Sci-Hub users to help them download some paper that cannot be opened through Sci-Hub. The number of such requests increased in the past two years, since Sci-Hub database updates were paused. The opposite also happens: users ask whether they can upload to Sci-Hub some paper that they have bought or downloaded via university subscription.
                </p>

                <p>Sci-Hub was never designed to accept uploads from users. From the very beginning, it was implemented as an autonomous system that scans and downloads research papers from various universities ‐ without human in the loop. This automatic method turned out to be quite effective, and Sci-Hub was able to reach coverage &gt; 90% in its best days. However, even then some paper remained unreachable.</p>

                <p>Now there exists a platform where users can request unavailable papers, and upload them: <a target="_blank" href="https://sci-net.xyz/">sci-net.xyz</a></p>

                

                <p>The user interface is simple: an input box where a DOI of the requested paper should be inserted. Once the user clicks the button, Sci-Net automatically checks if the requested paper is open access or already available on Sci-Hub. If the paper is found, the link to it will be displayed. If not, then user will be able to create a new request.</p>

                <p>On the index page, the list of requests is shown, that can be filtered by subjects and publisher. If you happen to have access to some paper in the list, you can click on the request and upload the PDF. There is a nice built-in functionality to remove watermarks from PDF to hide the university where paper was downloaded. That way Sci-Net protects the anonymity of the uploader.</p>

                <p>The 'Library' section will show all your requests and uploads, and in the 'Upload' section you can contribute your papers to the platform: just drop the PDF file and the system will automatically detect the DOI. If the DOI is not available yet on Sci-Net / Sci-Hub / open access, the file will get uploaded. The article then will become accessible to everyone by URL sci-net.xyz/DOI including people who are not registered on the platform.</p>

                <p>The platform is currently in the active development stage, and much more features are upcoming.</p>

                

                <p>The part that really makes Sci-Net stand out is the usage of decentralized tokens: Sci-Hub meme coins -- to reward knowledge sharing. When creating a request, you can specify the amount of tokens uploader will receive for sharing the paper. However, the tokens will not be transferred after uploading the PDF right away, but only after you check the solution and click the 'Accept' button. The tokens subtracted from your account will be added to the uploader.</p>

                <p>Sci-Net will ask for a minimum amount of 1000 Sci-Hub tokens to register. The tokens will appear on your account after registration and will be used to reward uploaders. That is the most controversial part: some people argue that Sci-Net introduces paywall similar to publisher.</p>

                <p>Even though both might appear similar at a first glance, the differences are profound. Compared to insane publisher paywalls, the entry tax on Sci-Net is symbolic and is not higher than an equivalent of a cup of coffee in most countries. The next difference is that in traditional approach, profits are made by publisher, and ordinary researcher has no control on how the money are used. On Sci-Net, you're using tokens directly to reward uploaders. Payments go to fellow researchers, not to the platform.</p>

                <p>But the most important is that publishers will charge for access to the same paper again and again. Sci-Net will only do that once when paper is uploaded and after that, it will remain free forever and for everyone -- even users who are not registered on the platform will be able to access it. That is, all Sci-Net transactions contribute directly to public domain, and the number of knowledge accessible to everyone grows with Sci-Net usage.</p>

                <p>The more people use Sci-Hub token, the more valuable it becomes. That way Sci-Net indirectly contributes to maintenance and further development of Sci-Hub.</p>

                <p>The only downside is that obtaining Sci-Hub tokens on the Solana network can be a non-trivial puzzle for a user who are new to crypto. But that only makes the process more interesting.</p>

                

                <p>Overall, Sci-Net is a platform that every researcher today must use and contribute to -- together, we can gradually make the idea of open knowledge a reality.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <h3 id="%F0%9F%9A%80-of-trials-and-tribulations">🚀 Of trials and tribulations</h3><p>Open Source is beautiful. Messy, thankless, powerful — and occasionally just plain weird.</p><p>At <a href="https://vates.tech/?ref=virtualize.sh" rel="noreferrer">Vates</a>, we’ve already shared some of the pain points that come with maintaining open source projects (see: <a href="https://virtualize.sh/blog/the-reality-of-oss-maintainer-fatigue/" rel="noopener">OSS maintainer fatigue</a>). And more recently, the rise of AI-assisted fake contributions and “security reports” has added a whole new layer of entropy. (<a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2024/01/02/the-i-in-llm-stands-for-intelligence/?ref=virtualize.sh" rel="noopener">this blog post</a> captures it perfectly.)</p><p>But today, we’re here for something a little more… grounded.</p><h3 id="%F0%9F%A7%91%E2%80%8D%F0%9F%9A%80-the-curious-case-of-the-infinite-trial">🧑‍🚀 The curious case of the infinite trial</h3><p>Let’s set the stage. Picture a semi-governmental company. Around $130 million in annual revenue. They build and operate very expensive things — in space. Hundreds of physical hosts. Nearly 4,000 VMs. Most of their IT stack, in fact, runs on our platform.</p><div><p>🚀</p><p>You might say we’re <i><em>mission critical</em></i>. Fitting, since the <b><strong>XCP-ng logo is literally a rocket</strong></b>, and <b><strong>Xen Orchestra’s is a satellite</strong></b>. We didn’t expect someone to take that so literally.</p></div><p>Are they paying customers?</p><p>No.</p><p>Are they using the fully open-source version, from source?</p><p>Also no.</p><p>Instead, they discovered our <strong>Xen Orchestra Appliance</strong> (XOA): a turnkey virtual machine, with Xen Orchestra pre-installed, regularly tested, easy to deploy and update (and yes, still running fully on-prem). A supported and stable experience, designed for teams that don’t want to <code>git pull</code> on <code>master</code> branch in production.</p><p>But they didn’t want to pay for it. So they came up with a <em>creative</em> workaround: abusing our <strong>30-day trial </strong>(initially 15 days until recently), over and over again.</p><p>It all started back in <strong>April 2015</strong> — yes, a full decade ago. At first, they used their <strong>corporate emails</strong> to request trials. One here, one there. Nothing suspicious. But over the years, the pattern grew. More emails. More trials. Enough that, when we looked back, we realized we could chart it. Literally. Here's what the <em>"creative licensing strategy"</em> has looked like over time:</p><figure><img src="https://virtualize.sh/blog/content/images/2025/05/image-1.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="988" height="574" srcset="https://virtualize.sh/blog/content/images/size/w600/2025/05/image-1.png 600w, https://virtualize.sh/blog/content/images/2025/05/image-1.png 988w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><b><strong>Number of accounts we could confidently tie to the company.</strong></b> <span>Probably not even the full picture — they were </span><i><em>very</em></i><span> committed.</span></figcaption></figure><p>As you can imagine, we ended up with what looked like the entire staff directory. Developers, sysadmins, managers… pretty sure we even had the janitor signed up for a trial at some point.</p><p>When those ran out, they switched to <strong>personal Outlook or Gmail addresses</strong>. Every time: starting with a new (real!) person with their… personal email, a new 30-day trial. And then go incrementally with it. <code>johndoe01@outlook.com</code>, then <code>johndoe02@outlook.com</code>… We're now well past <code>johndoe60</code>. Same company name, every time… which is impressive considering the field isn’t even required in order to register your account. Hard to say if it was a mistake, a flex, or just their way of making sure we didn’t miss who was milking the trials.</p><p>Yes, they’re that committed. Committed to <em>not</em> paying.</p><h3 id="%F0%9F%94%8D-a-quick-reminder-on-the-options">🔍 A quick reminder on the options</h3><p>For the record, we’re fine with free users. That’s the spirit of open source. You can follow <a href="https://docs.xen-orchestra.com/installation?ref=virtualize.sh#from-the-sources" rel="noopener">our documentation</a>, build from source, and enjoy all the features for free. No stability guarantee, no pro support, <strong>but everything is there</strong>.</p><p>The appliance version (XOA) — the one they keep trialing — is our supported, maintained, pre-packaged VM. It’s tested. It updates with a single click. It saves time and reduces risk. That’s what we sell. And that’s what they keep pirouetting around with their email dance.</p><p>To me, that’s a pretty blatant breach of the unwritten “moral contract” of Open Source. I touched on that in more detail here:</p><figure><a href="https://virtualize.sh/blog/the-moral-contract/"><div><p>The moral contract</p><p>Balancing openness and revenue: navigating the moral contract in the evolving world of free software.</p><p><img src="https://virtualize.sh/blog/content/images/icon/faviconV2-3" alt=""><span>Olivier Lambert</span></p></div><p><img src="https://virtualize.sh/blog/content/images/thumbnail/trees-gedc9162a0_1280.jpg" alt="" onerror="this.style.display = 'none'"></p></a></figure><h3 id="%F0%9F%A7%A0-the-real-puzzle">🧠 The real puzzle</h3><p>We even helped them. In good faith. Like we often do with users evaluating our solution — we don’t waste time scrutinizing who’s asking; we just try to help. That’s the spirit of trials, after all. So yes, we answered their questions, offered guidance, and even spent nearly a full day supporting them during one of their early “we’re just testing, maybe planning to buy” moments. You know the tune.</p><p>But over the years, the pattern started to stand out. Familiar questions, familiar setups… and when we finally looked into it, the pieces clicked. A quick search through our records revealed over <strong>at least 60 separate accounts</strong> tied to the same organization.</p><p>So we reached out.</p><p>They vaguely apologized and claimed they’d switch to using the source version instead.</p><p>Which — fine. Not ideal, but technically within the rules. What stung more was their complete disinterest in any kind of professional support — even when we simply brought up the idea of a volume discount (!). They shut it down immediately. <strong>Apparently, sending satellites into orbit is easier than entertaining the thought of paying for open source support.</strong></p><p>And did they actually switch to the source?</p><p>Of course not.</p><p>They just kept going — now using personal Outlook addresses and incrementing the email handles like they were running a script.</p><p>And here's the kicker: if this was a typical SaaS platform with no way to self-host, maybe you’d understand the logic of trying to game the system. But <strong>you can self-host everything</strong>. For free. No limits. Just a slightly less comfy upgrade experience.</p><p>They chose to go out of their way — repeatedly — to fake trials <strong>rather than</strong> read a short doc and type a few commands.</p><p><strong>What does that say about the value of our virtual appliance? Maybe more than any of our marketing</strong> 🤔</p><h3 id="%F0%9F%92%AD-what-now">💭 What now?</h3><p>We’re not going to waste days chasing them. But at some point, this goes beyond saving a few bucks: it becomes performance art.</p><p>Just to be sure you get it: they are using <strong>personal Outlook or Gmail accounts</strong>. Used to repeatedly request trials of a product that’s open source and free to self-host. For the last 10 years. All while voluntarily filling in their <strong>actual company name</strong> in the registration form. Was it a mistake? A subconscious cry for help? Or just an artistic commitment to trolling? We may never know.</p><p>What we do know: this kind of behavior chips away at what makes Open Source sustainable. When you're operating a satellite fleet and running 4,000 VMs on our stack, maybe (just maybe?) it’s time to stop treating the trial system like a vending machine.</p><p>We'll likely introduce smarter limits to prevent this kind of trial farming. Not to block honest users, but to make sure we can spend our energy where it actually matters: building great software, supporting real users, and keeping Open Source alive and well.</p><p>And if someone from That Company is reading this: you still have time to do the right thing. You’ve got the rocket science down. Now try ethics.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                            <p>A few months ago I needed to build a new infrastructure for my SaaS, as the current PHP+MySQL combo was not fit for purpose anymore. I was excited about the opportunity to make the most of all the new LLMs I'd been playing with, so I set aside my SWE hat and I started acting as a product manager, chatting with Claude about best practices, doing some research on my own and then coming up with a plan, after many back and forths. I ended up choosing Go+Clickhouse.</p><p>When it was time to start coding, I asked Claude to give me a big and complicated markdown file outlining my existing infrastructure, my desired new infrastructure, what I’m trying to achieve, why I'm doing it, etc.</p><p>So I put it all inside Cursor Notepads and I start prompting away. Cursor writes code, I build it and test it. I'm quite happy with how things are going, the codebase isn't the tidiest but things seems to work. I'm aiming for speed more than code cleanliness - my SaaS business customers told me they need specific data and this new infrastructure is the only way I can deliver it. I have a few more potential customers who are waiting for me to tell them this is ready so they can purchase a plan. Every day I don’t have this ready, I’m literally losing money.</p><p>But then a few weeks go by, and the cracks start to show. I start getting frustrated. Every day I feel like I’m really close to the end product, then I find another issue that sets me back for days. <br>I justify it thinking that I’ve never used Go or Clickhouse before, so it makes sense that it takes me a bit longer than I’m used to to fix those issues. The problems continue though, and I’m getting more frustrated. Cursor is not helping as much anymore. I paste in error messages, and I get a fix in response but then something breaks somewhere else. The more detailed the problem, the harder it is for the LLM to provide the actual solution. So I start actually looking at the code more closely, trying to understand it. <br>I’ve been a software engineer for 15 years, and I studied C++ and Java in school, so I do have a rough idea of what’s happening in these Go files. But I have no concept of Go or Clickhouse best practices.<br>I start educating myself a bit more about those. I read some documentation, articles, I watch a YouTube video about Clickhouse. I become more inquisitive with Claude, asking detailed questions and challenging its answers.</p><p>One morning, I decide to actually inspect closely what’s all this code that Cursor has been writing. It’s not like I was blindly prompting without looking at the end result, but I was optimizing for speed and I hadn’t actually sat down just to review the code. I was just building building building.</p><p>So I do a “coding review” session. And <strong>the horror ensues.</strong></p><p>Two service files, in the same directory, with similar names, clearly doing a very similar thing. But the method names are different. The props are not consistent. One is called "WebAPIprovider", the other one "webApi". They represent the same exact parameter. The same method is redeclared multiple times across different files. The same config file is being called in different ways and retrieved with different methods.</p><p>No consistency, no overarching plan. It’s like I'd asked 10 junior-mid developers to work on this codebase, with no Git access, locking them in a room without seeing what the other 9 were doing.</p><p>And before you ask, yes, I was feeding context to LLMs, lots of it. I was mostly using Gemini specifically for its larger context window. Every time I needed a different iteration of the same kind of file I gave specific instructions to take example from those. But it wasn’t enough.</p><p><strong>Taking a step back</strong></p><p>By now it’s clear that I need to change my approach. I’m a software engineer first and foremost, so it’s stupid not to make the most of my skills. I’ve been teaching myself more about Go and Clickhouse, and I’ve taken a step back from building at full speed. I’m going through files and rewriting code. Not everything, just the things that make me want to vomit. The language might be different but I know in my head what I want things to look like and how to organise them.</p><p>Since I’ve taken a step back, debugging has become easier. Maybe I’m not as fast but I don’t have this weird feeling of “<em>I kinda wrote this code but I actually have no idea what’s in it</em>”. I’m still using LLMs, but for dumber things: "rename all occurrences of this parameter", or "here’s some pseudo code, give me the Go equivalent".</p><p>The hardest part in all of this has been resisting the urge to use AI. I have this amazing tool available and it could write these 10 files in a minute. I’m wasting time by not using it! And that’s when it hit me. <strong>I’ve not been using my brain as much. </strong>I'm subconsciously defaulting to AI for all things coding.<br>I’ve been using pen and paper less. As soon as I need to plan a new feature, my first thought is asking o4-mini-high how to do it, instead of my neurons. I hate this. And I’m changing it.</p><p>So yes, I’m worried about the impact of AI, but I’m not worried about the jobs, I’m worried about losing my mental sharpness, my ability to plan out features and write tidy and functional code.</p><p>So I’m taking a big step back, really limiting how much AI I use. I’m defaulting to pen and paper, I’m defaulting to coding the first draft of that function on my own. And if I’m not sure I’ll use an LLM to check if that’s a good solution, if that’s a good naming convention, or how I can finish that last part.<br>But I’m not asking it to write new things from scratch, to come up with ideas or to write a whole new plan. I’m writing the plan. I’m the senior dev. The LLM is the assistant.</p><p><strong>A happy medium</strong></p><p>Now that I've changed my approach, I’m not frustrated with LLMs anymore. I have once again very low expectations, so when they do something well it’s a nice surprise. I’m trying to be smart about how I use them, they're such a great tool for learning for example. I’m leveraging them to learn Go, to upskill myself. And then I apply this new knowledge when I code.</p><p>But I feel worried for non coders. I almost feel like they’re in a worse position now with AI than they were in the no-code era. At least a no-code tool has been written by a human with common sense, and even if its features are limited, at least there’s some sort of structure.</p><p>“Vibe coding”, or whatever “coding with AI without knowing how to code” is called, is as of today a recipe for disaster, if you’re building anything that’s not a quick prototype.</p><p>I cannot imagine what coding with Cursor must feel like, for a non coder. Or maybe I can. Walls of code you don’t understand, error after error that you keep pasting into a chat box, which gives you back more code, which makes things even messier and complicated and, at some point, just wrong. And impossible to fix.</p><p><strong>A note for AI enthusiasts</strong></p><p>I can hear the horde of AI coding experts screaming at me: you should have used &lt;newest-model&gt;! You should have used Cursor rules! You should have followed this 15 step gamechanger workflow I found on Reddit the other day!</p><p>I have. I tried, I really did. There’s some things that AI cannot do just yet.</p><p>And while I haven’t tried every single combination of tools, agentic workflows, etc, I remain confident in my statement.If you don’t believe me, try being someone with no prior knowledge of Clickhouse, asking an LLM to write a complicated query involving multiple 100M+ rows tables, without triggering memory errors, on a server with limited RAM. <br>It just can’t, even if you give it the whole SQL schema, even if you link the latest Clickhouse documentation, even if you outline in granular detail your business needs and infrastructure constraints. Newest Gemini can’t, o4-mini-high can’t, o3 can’t, Sonnet 3.7 can’t.</p><p>Also, if I need hours to set up a complicated system just so the AI doesn’t build a house of cards instead of the app I needed, is it really worth it? Especially when there’s no consistency in the model's performance, so even if you find the absolutely perfect workflow, it doesn’t last for long. Or it stops working as soon as you need it for something slightly different.</p><p>Let me be clear: I'm writing this as someone super excited about new tech, someone who loves to be an early adopter, someone who is still really enthusiastic about AI. I think and hope we’ll get there eventually, but as of right now we’re in a very weird time, where the tools look amazing, everyone tells you they’re amazing, but they’re actually good-but-not-great, and they're potentially making us dumber.</p><p>It’s a confusing experience. It’s like I need to get somewhere and I can either walk, or jump on this spaceship that travels at 900mph, but its controls are half in Hungarian and half in Ancient Greek. With enough trial and error I can probably get the spaceship to take me to my destination, but that’s a lot of work in itself and at the end of the day I’m left wondering if I should have just walked.</p><p>To make it all worse, I feel like we’re constantly being gaslighted by benchmarks, by influencers who can now sell you this new magic shovel, and by a flurry of companies that are trying to convince us that it’s an “agent” and definitely not just another cron job.</p><p>Some days I feel like we’re also being gaslit by LLM providers. Just look at any AI related subreddit, and you’ll see people having completely opposite experiences, with the same exact model, with the same prompt, on the same day. If you code with AI long enough you’ll be able to relate. One day it’s amazing, the next day it’s incredibly stupid.</p><p>Are they throttling the GPUs? Are these tools just impossible to control? What the fuck is going on?</p>

<p><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/t/0Z2lgtsJlcJwBPZxorhvrxy5Io4=/400x0/article-new/2020/08/fortnite-apple-logo-2.5.jpg?lossy" srcset="https://images.macrumors.com/t/0Z2lgtsJlcJwBPZxorhvrxy5Io4=/400x0/article-new/2020/08/fortnite-apple-logo-2.5.jpg?lossy 400w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/mSK82iJmXlndDBho55ZyD5Eqwi8=/800x0/article-new/2020/08/fortnite-apple-logo-2.5.jpg?lossy 800w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/YRKBFO7_YDy3wK91S5K2ylZSGL8=/1600x0/article-new/2020/08/fortnite-apple-logo-2.5.jpg 1600w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/Y7dW-eUJWkz-syrVGiP8xG5xKOs=/2500x0/filters:no_upscale()/article-new/2020/08/fortnite-apple-logo-2.5.jpg 2500w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 697px" alt="fortnite apple logo 2" width="1280" height="720"><br>"Apple has blocked our Fortnite submission so we cannot release to the US App Store or to the Epic Games Store for iOS in the European Union," Epic stated via its <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1923293522234356169">Fortnite account</a> on X (Twitter). "Now, sadly, Fortnite on iOS will be offline worldwide until Apple unblocks it."</p>
<p>Apple banned the ‌Epic Games‌ developer account back in 2020 when ‌Epic Games‌ violated its ‌App Store‌ rules to add web-based purchases, kicking off a multi-year legal battle. Because the main ‌Epic Games‌ developer account continues to be banned, Epic submitted Fortnite to the U.S. ‌App Store‌ using an account from <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/05/epic-games-fortnite-us-app-store/">Epic Games Sweden</a>, a subsidiary that Epic formed to create the ‌Epic Games‌ Store alternative app marketplace in the European Union.</p>
<p>The game was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/09/fortnite-submitted-to-us-app-store/">submitted for review</a> on May 9, but after waiting over 120 hours without a response, Epic was forced to pull and resubmit its application to include the latest update.</p>
<p>Epic CEO Tim Sweeney has been vocal about his frustration with the situation, claiming that Apple has not been returning the company's calls and that the review process <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/14/epic-resubmits-fortnite-to-app-store/">typically moves much faster</a>.</p>
<p>Before submitting Fortnite to the U.S. App Store, Epic CEO Tim Sweeney said the company spoke with Apple about its plans – but never claimed Apple approved them. It remains unclear if Apple will allow Fortnite back, as the Epic v. Apple lawsuit confirmed that Apple has the right to ban Epic's account and isn't required to reinstate it.</p>
<p>It's the latest chapter in the ongoing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games-vs-apple/">legal battle</a> between the two companies, which began in 2020 when Apple removed Fortnite from the App Store after Epic implemented direct payment options that bypassed Apple's 30% commission.</p>
<p>The game had briefly returned to iOS devices in the EU via the Epic Games Store, but that version has now also gone offline.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Work-from-home employees whose days seem longer, with more meetings and emails than ever before, may find a new Harvard Business School study validating.</p><p>An analysis of the emails and meetings of 3.1 million people in 16 global cities found that the average workday increased by 8.2 percent—or 48.5 minutes—during the pandemic’s early weeks. Employees also participated in more meetings, though for less time than they did before COVID-19 sent many workers home.</p><p>“There is a general sense that we never stop being in front of Zoom or interacting,” says Raffaella Sadun, professor of business administration in the HBS Strategy Unit. “It’s very taxing, to be honest.”</p><p>Shifting to remote work at the start of the pandemic stripped away whatever was left of the elusive 9-to-5 business day and replaced it with videoconferencing and “asynchronous work.” With at least <a href="https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/how-much-will-remote-work-continue-after-the-pandemic" target="_self">16 percent of Americans</a> planning to keep working from home part of the time after COVID-19 abates, researchers are probing how virtual interaction might reshape organizations.</p><p>In the first large-scale analysis of digital communication early in the crisis, the team—Sadun; Jeffrey T. Polzer, the UPS Foundation Professor of Human Resource Management; HBS doctoral candidate Evan DeFilippis; New York University doctoral student Stephen Michael Impink; and former HBS research associate Madison Singell—studied aggregated, anonymous emails and meeting invitations of employees at 21,500 companies in North America, Europe, and the Middle East.</p><div><blockquote><p>There is a general sense that we never stop being in front of Zoom or interacting. It’s very taxing, to be honest.</p></blockquote></div></div><div><p>“The role of an office is to congregate and help people work together,” Sadun says. “For us, the question was, ‘What happens when you cannot have that physical space anymore?’ How do people adjust their work patterns?”</p><h2>Longer days and more check-ins</h2><p>The team compared the frequency and timing of emails sent within and outside organizations eight weeks before the start of pandemic-related lockdowns and eight weeks after. On average, they found that:</p><ul><li><p>Employees sent 5.2 percent more emails a day.</p></li><li><p>Emails had 2.9 percent more recipients.</p></li><li><p>About 8.3 percent more emails were sent after business hours.</p></li></ul><p>Sadun and Polzer also analyzed meeting invitations—the quantity, duration, and number of attendees—and observed that:</p><ul><li><p>People attended 13 percent more meetings.</p></li><li><p>Each meeting was 12 minutes—or 20 percent—shorter, reducing the number of meeting hours by 12 percent, or 19 minutes.</p></li><li><p>The number of people invited to each meeting rose by two, or 14 percent.</p></li></ul><p>Perhaps most striking: As researchers compared the time when people started sending emails and attending meetings each day and when they ended, they saw that the average workday lasted 8.2 percent longer, an extra 48.5 minutes. While it’s unlikely that employees worked continuously during that period, Sadun suspects that employees adopted more fluid schedules to accommodate interruptions from, say, a child struggling with virtual learning or a sick family member.</p><p>“Unless you really are able to create distinct boundaries between your life and your work, it's almost inevitable that we see these blurring lines,” she says.</p><p>The research team detailed their findings in the working paper <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3654470" target="_blank">Collaborating During Coronavirus: The Impact of COVID-19 on the Nature of Work</a>, released by the National Bureau of Economic Research in July.</p><h2>Probing the productivity and morale toll</h2><p>The anonymized nature of the data made it difficult to discern the quality of the meetings and email communication, and the impact on employees’ well-being. The study also didn’t include the time spent on collaboration tools, such as Slack and Microsoft Teams, which have become increasingly popular.</p><p>To tackle some of these questions, Sadun has been studying how 300 knowledge workers have been spending their time during the pandemic and how those activities affect their moods and perceived effectiveness. So far, the preliminary conclusions have been highly varied and personal.</p><p>“This is one of those things where it’s hard to make one statement for everybody,” Sadun says. “If you have a large house, life is good. If you have to combine your bedroom with your office, it’s not as good.”</p><p>It doesn’t take a detailed time log to know that videoconferencing fatigue has long set in for many employees, a likely factor in shrinking meeting times. Gathering in person doesn’t seem as draining as staring at a screen.</p><p>“The issue with Zoom is that you’re always on there. You have to show a concentrated face the whole time,” she says. “It's very unnatural to be constantly looking attentive for hours.”</p><h2>How managers can be mindful</h2><p>The pandemic workforce has created a significant challenge for managers, Sadun says. She offers three pieces of advice to leaders of remote workforces:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Empathize with workers’ unique circumstances.</strong>  Managers need to know what their employees are juggling to provide the right professional support.</p></li><li><p><strong>Focus on output, not hours.</strong>  It’s virtually impossible to track how employees are actually using their time. Instead, managers should focus on the quality of their work.</p></li><li><p><strong>Expect wide differences in productivity across employees, for now.</strong>  While some people find working from home energizing, many employees probably won’t be able to be as effective as they would be under normal conditions.</p></li></ul><p>Sadun, who spent the spring advising the Italian government about how to reopen its economy post-lockdown, hasn’t been immune to the pandemic’s disruption. But, for an academic analyzing a once-in-a-century pandemic and its economic fallout, working has been a way of coping.</p><p>“This is our way to make sense of the world,” Sadun says. “We try to make ourselves useful because we understand that there is something really big happening around us.”</p><h2>About the author</h2><p><strong><em>Danielle Kost</em></strong><em> is senior editor of Harvard Business School Working Knowledge.</em></p><p>[Image: <strong>iStock Photo</strong>]</p><h2>Related Reading</h2><ul><li><p><a href="https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/mastering-the-team-meeting" target="_self">Master the Team Meeting</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/time-to-give-team-innovation-a-rest" target="_self">'Always On' Isn't Always Best for Team Decision-Making</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/from-the-plow-to-the-pill-how-technology-shapes-our-lives" target="_self">From the Plow to the Pill: How Technology Shapes Our Lives</a></p></li></ul><h2>Related reading from the Working Knowledge Archives</h2><p><a href="https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/marissa-mayer-should-bridge-distance-gap-with-remote-workers" target="_self">Marissa Mayer Should Bridge Distance Gap with Remote Workers</a></p><h2><em>Are you working harder or longer at home?</em></h2><p>Share your insights below.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>On the completely impossible situation of blocking the Tor <code>.onion</code> TLD to avoid leaks, but at the same time not block it to make users able to do what they want.</p>



<h2>dot-onion leaks</h2>



<p>The onion TLD is a Tor specific domain that does not mean much to the world outside of Tor. If you try to resolve one of the domains in there with a <em>normal </em>resolver, you will get told that the domain does not exist.</p>



<p>If you ask your ISP’s resolver for such a hostname, you also advertise your intentions to speak with that domain to a sizeable portion of the Internet. DNS is inherently commonly insecure and has a habit of getting almost broadcast to lots of different actors. <em>A user on this IP address intends to interact with this .onion site.</em></p>



<p>It is thus of utter importance for Tor users to never use the <em>normal</em> DNS system for resolving .onion names.</p>



<h2>Remedy: refuse them</h2>



<p>To help preventing DNS leaks as mentioned above, Tor people engaged with the IETF and the cooperation ultimately ended up with the publication of <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7686">RFC 7686</a>: <em>The “.onion” Special-Use Domain Name</em>. Published in 2015.</p>



<p>This document details how libraries and software should approach handling of this special domain. It basically says that software should to a large degree <em>refuse</em> to resolve such hostnames.</p>



<h2>curl</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/543">November 2015 we were made aware</a> of the onion RFC and how it says we should filter these domains. At the time nobody seemed keen to work on this, and the problem was added to the <a href="https://curl.se/docs/knownbugs.html">known bugs document</a>.</p>



<p>Eight years later the issue was still lingering in that document and curl had still not done anything about it, when Matt Jolly emerged from the shadows and brought <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl/pull/10705">a PR that finally implemented the filtering</a> the RFC says we should do. Merged into curl on March 30, 2023. Shipped in the curl 8.1.0 release that shipped in May 17, 2023. Two years ago.</p>



<p>Since that release, curl users would not accidentally leak their .onion use.</p>



<p>A curl user that uses Tor would <em>obviously</em> use a SOCKS proxy to access the Tor network like they always have and then curl would let the Tor server do the name resolving as that is the entity here that knows about Tor and the dot onion domain etc.</p>



<p>That’s the thing with using a proxy like this. A network client like curl can hand the full host name to the proxy server and let that do the resolving magic instead of it being done by the client. It avoids leaking names to local name resolvers.</p>



<h2>Controversy</h2>



<p>It did not take long after curl started support the RFC that Tor themselves had pushed for, when Tor users with <em>creative</em> network setups realized and had opinions.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl/pull/11236">proposal appeared</a> to provide an override of the filter based on an environment variable for users who have a setup where the normal name resolver is already protected somehow and is known to be okay. Environment variables make for horrible APIs and the discussion did not end up in any particular consensus for other solutions so this suggestion did not make it through into code.</p>



<p>This issue has subsequently popped up a few more times when users have had some issues, but no fix or solution has been merged. curl remains blocking this domain. Usually people realize that when using the SOCKS proxy correctly, the domain name works as expected and that has then been the end of the discussions.</p>



<h2>oniux</h2>



<p>This week the Tor project announced a new product of their: <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/introducing-oniux-tor-isolation-using-linux-namespaces/">oniux</a>: <em>a command-line utility providing Tor network isolation for third-party applications using Linux namespaces</em>.</p>



<p>On their introductory web page explaining this new tool they even show it off using a curl command line:</p>



<pre>$ oniux curl http://2gzyxa5ihm7wid.onion/index.html</pre>



<p>(I decided to shorten the hostname here for illustration purposes.)</p>



<p>Wait a second, isn’t that a .onion hostname in that URL? Now what does curl do with .onion host names since that release two years ago?</p>



<p>Correct: that illustrated command line only works with old curl versions from before we implemented support for RFC 7686. From before we tried to do in curl what Tor indirectly suggested we should do. So now, when we try to do the right thing, curl does not work with this new tool Tor themselves launched!</p>



<p>At least we can’t say we get do live a dull life.</p>



<h2>Hey this doesn’t work!</h2>



<p>No really? Tell us all about it. Of course there was immediately <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/17363">an issue submitted</a> against curl for this, quite rightfully. That tool was quite clearly made for a use case like this.</p>



<p>So how do we fix this?</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last week, the CPython developers rolled out CPython 3.14.0b1. This week, PyCon
2025 kicks off in Pittsburgh, PA. Both events mark a significant milestone for
the effort to ship and stabilize free-threaded Python.</p>
<p>This is the story of the first year of that effort and how our team at
Quansight played a key role in enabling experimental use of the free-threaded
build with real production workflows that depend on a complex set of
dependencies.</p>

<p>Support for free-threaded Python unlocks the full compute power of modern
hardware with multicore CPUs and GPUs now commonplace. In the GIL-enabled
build, making full use of parallel algorithms that exploit all available
compute resources in Python requires workarounds and careful tuning. The Python
<code>threading</code> module is often not used because the GIL prevents useful parallel
scaling. Instead, many reach for <code>multiprocessing</code>, but spawning processes is
expensive and communicating across processes often requires making expensive
copies of data that would not be necessary in a multithreaded program where
data is implicitly shared between threads.</p>
<p>Having said that, it is not possible for packages that ship compiled code in
their release distributions to support the free-threaded build out of the box.
Any package shipping native code (many Python packages do that) need to be
audited to ensure the package builds and does not suffer thread-safety issues
that are impossible on the GIL-enabled build.</p>
<p>Disabling the GIL required deep structural changes to the CPython
interpreter. Fully supporting the free-threaded build in existing packages
similarly requires fixing structural issues that until now were not big
problems. Things like use of global state in the implementation of a C extension
for convenience or for performance are no longer safe, since the GIL does not
protect simultaneous access from Python to the global state, allowing undefined
behavior via data races. While it is possible to trigger thread safety issues
like this using the <code>threading</code> module even with the GIL, most of the time the
GIL prevented these issues from surfacing. The free-threaded build makes fixing
these issues much more pressing.</p>
<h2 id="major-accomplishments">Major accomplishments</h2>
<p>Alongside the Python runtime team at Meta, we made significant contributions to
enable support for free-threaded Python in a long list of packages and
projects, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Packaging and project workflow tools like meson, meson-python, the
setup-python GitHub Actions workflow, packaging, pip, and setuptools.</li>
<li>Bindings generators like Cython, pybind11, f2py, and PyO3.</li>
<li>Foundational packages in the PyData ecosystem like NumPy, SciPy, PyArrow,
Matplotlib, pandas, scikit-learn, and scikit-image.</li>
<li>Top dependencies by PyPI downloads like Pillow, PyYAML, yarl, multidict,
and frozenlist.</li>
</ul>
<p>We are also currently looking at popular packages that don't yet ship support,
including CFFI, cryptography, PyNaCl, aiohttp, SQLAlchemy, and grpcio as well
as popular libraries for machine learning workflows like safetensors and
tokenizers.</p>
<p>CPython core developers on our team also contributed several major improvements
that will ship in CPython 3.14:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Python <code>warnings</code> module is now thread-safe by default on the
free-threaded build. It can be made thread-safe on the GIL-enabled build
with a configuration option or runtime command-line flag.</li>
<li>Significant thread safety issues in <code>asyncio</code> have been fixed. Our
benchmarks indicate substantially improved parallel scaling of code using
asyncio with a thread pool runner.</li>
<li>Thread safety overhaul in the <code>ctypes</code> module.</li>
<li>Substantial performance improvements for the free-threaded garbage collector.</li>
<li>Helped implement the deferred reference counting scheme used by the
free-threaded interpreter in 3.14.</li>
<li>Implemented several specializations for the adaptive specializing
interpreter and supported shipping optimizations that bring the
single-threaded performance of free-threaded CPython 3.14 within spitting
distance of the GIL-enabled build.</li>
<li>A huge number of smaller bugfixes and thread safety improvements.</li>
</ul>
<p>We've also written a <a href="https://py-free-threading.github.io/">comprehensive guide</a>
for supporting free-threaded Python in existing apps and packages gleaned from
our experiences. Our hope is that the documentation we've written can be a
valuable resource for the "long tail" of packages that people will want to
update to support free-threaded Python in the coming years.</p>
<p>You can also read more about this effort from the team at Meta on the
<a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2025/05/05/developer-tools/enhancing-the-python-ecosystem-with-type-checking-and-free-threading/">Meta engineering blog</a>.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-state-of-the-free-threaded-python-ecosystem">What is the state of the free-threaded Python ecosystem?</h2>
<p>At this time last year, when Python 3.13.0b1 shipped, the wider ecosystem of
Python packages was more or less completely broken on the free-threaded build.
Trying to <code>pip install</code> anything but the simplest package with no dependencies
or only pure-Python dependencies would likely lead to build errors. Most of
these issues were not due to fundamental problems but because of unsupported
default options or minor assumptions broken on the free-threaded build.</p>
<p>Together with package maintainers and other contributors in the community,
we have fixed many of these issues and today things are much better. With the
release of Cython 3.1.0, which ships official support for the free-threaded
build, we also helped fix one of the most significant sources of build issues.</p>
<p>We are currently working on packages that ship compiled code but still do not
yet ship free-threaded wheels. You can track our progress using our manually
updated <a href="https://py-free-threading.github.io/tracking/">status tracking table</a>
or using Hugo van Kemenade's <a href="https://hugovk.github.io/free-threaded-wheels/">automatically updated
tracker</a>.</p>
<h3 id="challenges">Challenges</h3>
<p>As of today, the free-threaded Python build is ready to experiment with. We
need more reports of bad performance and bugs from people with real-world
workflows. Significant performance improvements are possible, particularly in
workflows that make use of multiprocessing and are paying the costs inherent to
that approach. However, many packages still need detailed auditing to discover
thread safety issues. Many Python libraries ship mutable data structures that
will not behave correctly under shared mutating and with no or minimal
documentation on thread safety or multithreaded performance.</p>
<p>As in any change of this magnitude that affects an entire programming language
package ecosystem, we are hitting cases where popular packages do not have the
resources needed to deal with changes needed to support free-threading. This is
particularly true of large legacy packages where few people or even no one
fully understands the code. As a community, we need to understand these issues
in our dependency trees and work towards sustainable maintenance for critical
packages.</p>
<h3 id="how-can-you-help">How can you help?</h3>
<p>Take a look at the <a href="https://py-free-threading.github.io/contributing/">contribution guide</a>
we've added to the main free-threading guide. We're tracking ecosystem-wide
issues and writing the content of the free-threaded guide in the
<a href="https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/free-threaded-compatibility">free-threaded-compatibility</a>
repository hosted on the Quansight-Labs GitHub org.</p>
<p>We also helped launch a <a href="https://discord.gg/rqgHCDqdRr">community Discord</a> to host
discussions about supporting the free-threaded build. Come join us if you're
interested in helping out!</p>
<h2 id="come-to-our-talk-at-pycon">Come to our talk at PyCon!</h2>
<p>I will be giving <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2025/schedule/presentation/42/">a talk at
PyCon</a> with my teammate
<a href="https://github.com/lysnikolaou">Lysandros Nikolaou</a>. If you'll be attending
the conference, please come and watch. We'll be sharing details from our
experiences porting packages to support the free-threaded build. We're hopeful
that the recording on YouTube will be a lasting valuable resource for the
visual learners of the world.</p>
<p>Personally, I believe the free-threaded build is the future of the language,
and am excited that I get to work full-time on enabling that. I'm also hopeful
that the work we're doing now will enable future work in the long tail of
packages used every day by millions of developers and dramatically improve the
performance of the language.</p></div></div>]]></description>

    <p><strong>Silent changes in payment methods on big creator funding platforms raise some unpleasant questions.</strong></p>

<p><strong>UPD Aug 13, 2024:</strong> The kind-of-official reply from BuyMeACoffee, and <a href="#upd-aug-13-2024">my response to it</a>.</p>

<p><strong>UPD Aug 14, 2024:</strong> A support email to one of the users gives BuyMeACoffee’s reasons, and also they <a href="#upd-aug-14-2024">blocked me on X (Twitter)</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-happened">What happened</h2>

<p>Recently, many Ukrainian creators have reported problems with payouts from <a href="https://buymeacoffee.com/">BuyMeACoffee</a>, a creator funding/crowdfunding platform.</p>

<p>At first, the reported support answers were typical corporative “we are sorry that we don’t care,” citing “compliance” and “policy updates.”</p>

<blockquote data-conversation="none"><p lang="uk" dir="ltr">В оригіналі, щоб вестерни читали які там є нікчеми <a href="https://t.co/JxoGgamYLq">pic.twitter.com/JxoGgamYLq</a></p>— Karå ꑭ🇺🇦 (@BzickOff) <a href="https://twitter.com/BzickOff/status/1819341225024983310?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 2, 2024</a></blockquote>


<p>Those reports were widely shared, and our predominantly feeling was “shocked but not surprised”: it is not the first time when a big platform has decided that they are too busy to try to distinguish non-occupied parts of a large country with a 30+m population from occupied parts, and decided they don’t care. Just recently, for example, the Mercury payment system <strong><a href="https://x.com/United24media/status/1815707715307479244">just blacklisted the entirety of Ukraine</a></strong> alongside Iran and North Korea.</p>

<p>But in a few days, it turned out (again, from support messages shared on Twitter) that BuyMeACoffee <strong>just dropped support for Payoneer</strong> (which works in Ukraine), leaving Stripe (which doesn’t) as the <strong>only payout method</strong>.</p>

<blockquote data-conversation="none"><p lang="uk" dir="ltr">4. Бо бай мі кохве мала в гузно своїх споживачів та закрила можливість виводити кошти напряму на карту через Wise, а також через Payoneer. Єдино можливий метод виводу стає сервіс Stripe який не доступний в Україні та до 14 серпня всі автори зможуть ввостаннє вивести свої кошти. <a href="https://t.co/XIQdNHVllu">pic.twitter.com/XIQdNHVllu</a></p>— AdrianZP (@AdrianZPcity) <a href="https://twitter.com/AdrianZPcity/status/1821252119875436595?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 7, 2024</a></blockquote>


<h2 id="did-they-though">Did they, though?</h2>

<p>Currently BuyMeACoffee’s <a href="https://help.buymeacoffee.com/en/articles/6258038-supported-countries-for-payouts-on-buy-me-a-coffee">support page</a> simply states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Buy Me a Coffee supports payouts to creators in several countries, facilitated through our payment provider, Stripe.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to the Internet Archive, in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240229183241/https://help.buymeacoffee.com/en/collections/1907909-payments">February</a>, there was another link to a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231028113814/https://help.buymeacoffee.com/en/articles/6258038-payment-supported-countries">page</a> that listed Stripe and Payoneer, while <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240521195730/https://help.buymeacoffee.com/en/collections/1907909-payments">May’s snapshot</a> already has only Stripe-related links.</p>

<p>So, the change <em>in the documentation</em> happened somewhere between February (that’s when I personally used it for the last time) and May: Internet Archive doesn’t provide other snapshots between those two dates.</p>

<p>So, at least the support’s private answers were aligned with the documentation.</p>

<p><strong>At the same time, there are a couple of funny facts about this deprecation.</strong></p>

<p><strong>First,</strong>  I know for a fact that some Ukrainian creators were receiving payouts via Payoneer somewhere around ~1 month ago; I even saw a credible claim about last week! (I just sent mine, which trickled from a moderately popular blog, will see whether it will come through; it is funny if it will. At least my configured Payoneer payout method is currently active in the BMaC dashboard.)</p>

<p>But more importantly, <strong>there was NO communication about the change</strong>. You wouldn’t find anything on <a href="https://x.com/buymeacoffee">their Twitter</a> or in the <a href="https://building.buymeacoffee.com/changelog/">public changelog</a> (screenshotted at 2024-08-08 11:05:30 GMT+0300—just in case something will magically appear there retroactively):</p>

<p><img src="https://zverok.space/img/2024-08-08-bmac/image00.png" alt="">
<img src="https://zverok.space/img/2024-08-08-bmac/image01.png" alt="">
<img src="https://zverok.space/img/2024-08-08-bmac/image02.png" alt="">
<img src="https://zverok.space/img/2024-08-08-bmac/image03.png" alt=""></p>

<p>As you can see, <strong>there is nothing about payout updates</strong> after the <a href="https://building.buymeacoffee.com/changelog/improved-payout-experience">Nov’23 post</a>, which mentioned Payoneer and Wise as available options alongside Stripe.</p>

<p>I assure you that <strong>there was no email communication to the creators either</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="how-bad-is-this">How bad is this?</h2>

<p>The difference is public lists of supported countries between <a href="https://www.payoneer.com/resources/global-payment-capabilities/">Payoneer</a> and <a href="https://help.buymeacoffee.com/en/articles/6258038-supported-countries-for-payouts-on-buy-me-a-coffee">Stripe</a> are <strong>95 (ninety-five)</strong> countries and territories. I am not sure that all 95 of those don’t have working Stripe (say, maybe the Faroe Islands just listed on Payoneer separately while being actually served by Stripe via Danish banks?), but it seems to be <em>a lot</em> anyway.</p>

<p>I’d like to know what the experience of BMaC users from those countries is like. But what I know for sure is that in Ukraine, a lot of people use the platform as a source of income (sometimes even a primary one). My subscriptions, for example, include but are not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A singer-songwriter turned paramedic who uses BMaC donations to record her songs on short vacations between duties;</li>
  <li>A writer and culturology scholar turned soldier who funds his studies about Ukrainian culture and history;</li>
  <li>A girl whose two brothers have fallen on the frontlines, and she funds her absolutely unique book club to connect to people and share reading experience with them;</li>
  <li>A small business owner from Kharkiv who uses a “build in public” approach for a small coffee shop (and recently got mobilized into Armed Forces);</li>
  <li>…and so on.</li>
</ul>

<p>None of them have BMaC as their primary income, and still, it is a sign of support from their peers and the possibility to continue doing what’s important to them.</p>

<p><strong>There is no way for any of us to receive the money accumulated on BMaC</strong> anymore. What looks like “technical” change for some American is realistically <strong>prohibitive</strong> for those not privileged enough to live in Stripe-supported countries. The money is still “there”, so probably no lawyer can say BMaC has “stolen them”—you just can’t neither receive “your” money nor, at least, give them back to those who sent them.</p>

<p>Note that some BMaC accounts have a lot of supporters, and many of those use “yearly” payments as a sign of their support—and all of it is currently in some technological limbo.</p>

<p>Now, I am just a mere developer, and I don’t know much about payout regulations and legal facts. I <em>might</em> charitably assume there was a good reason for dropping Payoneer support (maybe a business one, or maybe it is actually related to some government regulations). The fact itself is extremely distressing for many, but hey, that’s their business, what do we know.</p>

<p><strong>But the way this policy was implemented—no prior notice, no choice, no explicit communication of the reasons and possibilities—is absolutely fascinating, to say the least.</strong> And, honestly, support’s evasive behavior (and inconsistent reports about “some Payoneer payouts might still work”) just adds insult to injury.</p>

<p>I am not sure that any service that handles people’s money as their <em>primary</em> activity, and that does it this way, can be ever trusted. Just sayin’.</p>

<p>Have a good day, and have a screenshot of the latest message from BuyMeACoffee’s ever-positive Twitter!</p>

<p><img src="https://zverok.space/img/2024-08-08-bmac/image04.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Such a nice vibe! <em>(Neither their primary account nor <a href="https://x.com/jijosunny">the founder’s personal one</a>, which both have a history of replying to all relevant tweets, are currently giving any signs they are aware of the situation.)</em></p>

<p>PS: As a side note, <a href="https://en.ain.ua/2023/04/10/what-is-wrong-with-patreon-and-why-ukrainians-urge-canceling-it/">here is a story</a> about why Patreon is not an option for Ukrainians. And <a href="https://www.patreon.com/wargonzoo">here</a> is russian war correspondent’s Patreon account, mentioned in the story, still proudly present on the platform (though seemingly dormant).</p>

<h2 id="upd-aug-13-2024">UPD: Aug 13, 2024</h2>

<p>So, folks! After a week of poking, we have a kind-of-official answer from <a href="https://x.com/buymeacoffee">@buymeacoffee</a>!</p>

<p>Let’s unpack it!</p>

<blockquote data-conversation="none"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>This is simply not true. Let us clarify:</p><p>1. We never hold funds. If for some reason we cannot payout (potential fraud, bank account issues), the amount is refunded.</p><p>2. Not one Ukrainian creator's payout is held. We paid out to thousands of Ukrainian creators this week. Please…</p></div>— Buy Me a Coffee (@buymeacoffee) <a href="https://twitter.com/buymeacoffee/status/1823085434605605055?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 12, 2024</a></blockquote>


<p><strong>0.</strong> For some reason, this answer is a reply to one of those repeatedly asked them. Not even a standalone X post, nor a blog/changelog entry, nor a newsletter to creators.</p>

<p>So, if you aren’t a creator who constantly buggers them on X-formerly-Twitter (or follows all the discussions), you might still be unaware of the policy change or the existence of some answers.</p>

<p>The official feeds are still clear of the topic.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>We never hold funds. If […] we cannot payout […] the amount is refunded.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>I believe this <strong>intention</strong> (well, anything less would be a legal suicide), but I would still like to hear:
a. How the “cannot payout” decided and whether “the creator doesn’t have payout method we like, they should try another one” qualifies
b. A success story of real refunding (say, $5 to thousands of people) and whether it really works or just a claim.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>Not one Ukrainian creator’s payout is held. […] Please reply with the creator @ if you know of any.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>I <strong>want to believe</strong> that. In my original thread, and many other threads and discussions, I saw a LOT of people with negative experience of interaction with support.</p>

<p>Hopefully, <strong>ALL</strong> of Ukrainian creators who reported payout problems and unhelpful support responses are paid now? (And <strong>hopefully</strong>, it is not by means of “just find an EU friend who will agree to receive a payment for you”?.. Because I saw stories like that).</p>

<p>Also, dear BuyMeACoffee, “please @-us if you know a creator who has problems” would be <strong>a lot more persuasive</strong> if it wasn’t in the effing <em>replies under just one tweet</em>.</p>

<p>Just sayin’</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>Almost all of our creators use our standard payout method powered by Stripe.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, the so-called “First World”. But I get it. I do.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We’ve decided to focus on this for […] reasons which are important for the sustainability of the business.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s your business, and that’s your right to do so. As inconvenient as it might be for us, we have no say here. But the way it was communicated…</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>we’re planning to continue offering an alternative payout method […] for countries that are not supported. As we figure this out, we can confirm that it is business as usual for creators from Ukraine</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It would be such a nice message if communicated clearly &amp; timely 🙏</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We’d appreciate it if you stop spamming our socials, spreading misinformation about us such as “we blocked withdrawals to Ukraine”. We’ll have no option but to block you and move on.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You know what?</p>

<p><strong>We’d appreciate</strong> if you would be clear, honest, and public about the changes you make.</p>

<p><strong>We’d appreciate</strong> your support not changing the story from the initial “it’s compliance standards”, to further “your payout method is not supported, it is your problem” to final (after the public outrage) “oh of course we would help everyone 🙏”.</p>

<p><strong>We’d appreciate</strong> the public communication of the situation (and no, the reply in one thread in X that ends with passive aggression is not it, thank you very much!)</p>

<p><strong>We’d appreciate</strong> having this convo, like, a couple of weeks ago.</p>

<p><strong>In conclusion</strong>, I don’t believe BMaC being malicious or scammy in this situation (and I <em>do want</em> to believe they are looking for a solution that will work for us, too). But the amount of neglect and disregard that was displayed in the way the change was implemented and communicated, and in the interactions with support, makes it almost a textbook case of <strong>bad communication</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="upd-aug-14-2024">UPD: Aug 14, 2024</h2>

<p>One of the Ukrainian creators received an unusually honest explanation of the reasons behind dropping support for Payoneer and Wise: “Incompatible with our upcoming features.” So, like, a bit more convenience for the First World users, at a price of excluding those not that privileged. (Note also that in this communication there is no sign of that promise of that “planning to continue offering an alternative payout method […] for countries that are not supported” which was sweetening their <strong>public</strong> communication.)</p>

<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I am disabling <a href="https://twitter.com/buymeacoffee?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@buymeacoffee</a> account tomorrow.</p><p>The company is irresponsibly punches its Ukrainian clients in the guts by disabling Wise and making payouts impossible.</p><p>This isn’t just about switching platforms; each Ukrainian creator will lose their entire subscriber base. This… <a href="https://t.co/BPnuAgcutk">pic.twitter.com/BPnuAgcutk</a></p></div>— Kate from Kharkiv (@BohuslavskaKate) <a href="https://twitter.com/BohuslavskaKate/status/1823303795322822679?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 13, 2024</a></blockquote>


<p><strong>And another update:</strong> After several days of persistent, yet polite, poking their public X account, asking for public statement (more public than a reply in a thread), BuyMeACoffee <a href="https://x.com/zverok/status/1823757570240340466">just blocked me</a>, reportedly “for spreading misinformation”:</p>

<p><img src="https://zverok.space/img/2024-08-08-bmac/image05.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Note there is new, previously never stated, pieces of information: about Payoneer working till Nov.1—not “do your last payout in August,” as it was previously; and about Wise which they will “continue to offer” (currently, to the best of my understanding, they aren’t).</p>

<h2>Mark Twain</h2>
<h3>from <i>A Tramp Abroad</i></h3>

<p>A little learning makes the whole world kin.<br>
--Proverbs xxxii, 7. 

</p><p>I went often to look at the collection of curiosities in Heidelberg
Castle, and one day I surprised the keeper of it with my German.  I spoke
entirely in that language.  He was greatly interested; and after I had
talked a while he said my German was very rare, possibly a "unique"; and
wanted to add it to his museum. 

</p><p>If he had known what it had cost me to acquire my art, he would also
have known that it would break any collector to buy it.  Harris and I had
been hard at work on our German during several weeks at that time, and
although we had made good progress, it had been accomplished under great
difficulty and annoyance, for three of our teachers had died in the mean
time.  A person who has not studied German can form no idea of what a
perplexing language it is. 

</p><p>Surely there is not another language that is so slipshod and
systemless, and so slippery and elusive to the grasp.  One is washed about
in it, hither and thither, in the most helpless way; and when at last he
thinks he has captured a rule which offers firm ground to take a rest on
amid the general rage and turmoil of the ten parts of speech, he turns
over the page and reads, "Let the pupil make careful note of the following
EXCEPTIONS." He runs his eye down and finds that there are more exceptions
to the rule than instances of it.  So overboard he goes again, to hunt for
another Ararat and find another quicksand.  Such has been, and continues
to be, my experience.  Every time I think I have got one of these four
confusing "cases" where I am master of it, a seemingly insignificant
preposition intrudes itself into my sentence, clothed with an awful and
unsuspected power, and crumbles the ground from under me.  For instance,
my book inquires after a certain bird--(it is always inquiring after
things which are of no sort of no consequence to anybody): "Where is the
bird?" Now the answer to this question--according to the book--is that the
bird is waiting in the blacksmith shop on account of the rain.  Of course
no bird would do that, but then you must stick to the book.  Very well, I
begin to cipher out the German for that answer.  I begin at the wrong end,
necessarily, for that is the German idea.  I say to myself, "REGEN (rain)
is masculine--or maybe it is feminine--or possibly neuter--it is too much
trouble to look now.  Therefore, it is either DER (the) Regen, or DIE
(the) Regen, or DAS (the) Regen, according to which gender it may turn out
to be when I look.  In the interest of science, I will cipher it out on
the hypothesis that it is masculine.  Very well--then THE rain is DER
Regen, if it is simply in the quiescent state of being MENTIONED, without
enlargement or discussion--Nominative case; but if this rain is lying
around, in a kind of a general way on the ground, it is then definitely
located, it is DOING SOMETHING--that is, RESTING (which is one of the
German grammar's ideas of doing something), and this throws the rain into
the Dative case, and makes it DEM Regen.  However, this rain is not
resting, but is doing something ACTIVELY,--it is falling--to interfere
with the bird, likely--and this indicates MOVEMENT, which has the effect
of sliding it into the Accusative case and changing DEM Regen into DEN
Regen." Having completed the grammatical horoscope of this matter, I
answer up confidently and state in German that the bird is staying in the
blacksmith shop "wegen (on account of) DEN Regen." Then the teacher lets
me softly down with the remark that whenever the word "wegen" drops into a
sentence, it ALWAYS throws that subject into the GENITIVE case, regardless
of consequences--and therefore this bird stayed in the blacksmith shop
"wegen DES Regens."

</p><p>N.B.--I was informed, later, by a higher authority, that there was an
"exception" which permits one to say "wegen DEN Regen" in certain peculiar
and complex circumstances, but that this exception is not extended to
anything BUT rain. 

</p><p>There are ten parts of speech, and they are all troublesome.  An
average sentence, in a German newspaper, is a sublime and impressive
curiosity; it occupies a quarter of a column; it contains all the ten
parts of speech--not in regular order, but mixed; it is built mainly of
compound words constructed by the writer on the spot, and not to be found
in any dictionary--six or seven words compacted into one, without joint or
seam--that is, without hyphens; it treats of fourteen or fifteen different
subjects, each enclosed in a parenthesis of its own, with here and there
extra parentheses, making pens with pens: finally, all the parentheses and
reparentheses are massed together between a couple of king-parentheses,
one of which is placed in the first line of the majestic sentence and the
other in the middle of the last line of it--AFTER WHICH COMES THE VERB,
and you find out for the first time what the man has been talking about;
and after the verb--merely by way of ornament, as far as I can make
out--the writer shovels in "HABEN SIND GEWESEN GEHABT HAVEN GEWORDEN
SEIN," or words to that effect, and the monument is finished.  I suppose
that this closing hurrah is in the nature of the flourish to a man's
signature--not necessary, but pretty.  German books are easy enough to
read when you hold them before the looking-glass or stand on your head--so
as to reverse the construction--but I think that to learn to read and
understand a German newspaper is a thing which must always remain an
impossibility to a foreigner. 

</p><p>Yet even the German books are not entirely free from attacks of the
Parenthesis distemper--though they are usually so mild as to cover only a
few lines, and therefore when you at last get down to the verb it carries
some meaning to your mind because you are able to remember a good deal of
what has gone before.  Now here is a sentence from a popular and excellent
German novel--which a slight parenthesis in it.  I will make a perfectly
literal translation, and throw in the parenthesis-marks and some hyphens
for the assistance of the reader--though in the original there are no
parenthesis-marks or hyphens, and the reader is left to flounder through
to the remote verb the best way he can: 

</p><p>"But when he, upon the street, the (in-satin-and-silk-covered-
now-very-unconstrained-after-the-newest-fashioned-dressed) government
counselor's wife MET," etc., etc. <a href="#1">[1]</a>

</p><p>That is from THE OLD MAMSELLE'S SECRET, by Mrs. Marlitt.  And that
sentence is constructed upon the most approved German model.  You observe
how far that verb is from the reader's base of operations; well, in a
German newspaper they put their verb away over on the next page; and I
have heard that sometimes after stringing along the exciting preliminaries
and parentheses for a column or two, they get in a hurry and have to go to
press without getting to the verb at all.  Of course, then, the reader is
left in a very exhausted and ignorant state. 

</p><p>We have the Parenthesis disease in our literature, too; and one may see
cases of it every day in our books and newspapers: but with us it is the
mark and sign of an unpracticed writer or a cloudy intellect, whereas with
the Germans it is doubtless the mark and sign of a practiced pen and of
the presence of that sort of luminous intellectual fog which stands for
clearness among these people.  For surely it is NOT clearness--it
necessarily can't be clearness.  Even a jury would have penetration enough
to discover that.  A writer's ideas must be a good deal confused, a good
deal out of line and sequence, when he starts out to say that a man met a
counselor's wife in the street, and then right in the midst of this so
simple undertaking halts these approaching people and makes them stand
still until he jots down an inventory of the woman's dress.  That is
manifestly absurd.  It reminds a person of those dentists who secure your
instant and breathless interest in a tooth by taking a grip on it with the
forceps, and then stand there and drawl through a tedious anecdote before
they give the dreaded jerk.  Parentheses in literature and dentistry are
in bad taste. 

</p><p>The Germans have another kind of parenthesis, which they make by
splitting a verb in two and putting half of it at the beginning of an
exciting chapter and the OTHER HALF at the end of it.  Can any one
conceive of anything more confusing than that? These things are called
"separable verbs." The German grammar is blistered all over with separable
verbs; and the wider the two portions of one of them are spread apart, the
better the author of the crime is pleased with his performance.  A
favorite one is REISTE AB--which means departed.  Here is an example which
I culled from a novel and reduced to English: 

</p><p>"The trunks being now ready, he DE- after kissing his mother and
sisters, and once more pressing to his bosom his adored Gretchen, who,
dressed in simple white muslin, with a single tuberose in the ample folds
of her rich brown hair, had tottered feebly down the stairs, still pale
from the terror and excitement of the past evening, but longing to lay her
poor aching head yet once again upon the breast of him whom she loved more
dearly than life itself, PARTED."

</p><p>However, it is not well to dwell too much on the separable verbs.  One
is sure to lose his temper early; and if he sticks to the subject, and
will not be warned, it will at last either soften his brain or petrify it. 
Personal pronouns and adjectives are a fruitful nuisance in this language,
and should have been left out.  For instance, the same sound, SIE, means
YOU, and it means SHE, and it means HER, and it means IT, and it means
THEY, and it means THEM.  Think of the ragged poverty of a language which
has to make one word do the work of six--and a poor little weak thing of
only three letters at that.  But mainly, think of the exasperation of
never knowing which of these meanings the speaker is trying to convey. 
This explains why, whenever a person says SIE to me, I generally try to
kill him, if a stranger. 

</p><p>Now observe the Adjective.  Here was a case where simplicity would have
been an advantage; therefore, for no other reason, the inventor of this
language complicated it all he could.  When we wish to speak of our "good
friend or friends," in our enlightened tongue, we stick to the one form
and have no trouble or hard feeling about it; but with the German tongue
it is different.  When a German gets his hands on an adjective, he
declines it, and keeps on declining it until the common sense is all
declined out of it.  It is as bad as Latin.  He says, for instance: 

</p><p>SINGULAR

</p><p>Nominative--Mein gutER Freund, my good friend.<br> 
Genitives--MeinES GutEN FreundES, of my good friend. <br>
Dative--MeinEM gutEN Freund, to my good friend. <br>
Accusative--MeinEN gutEN Freund, my good friend. <br>

</p><p>PLURAL

</p><p>N.--MeinE gutEN FreundE, my good friends.  G.--MeinER gutEN
FreundE, of my good friends.  D.--MeinEN gutEN FreundEN,
to my good friends.  A.--MeinE gutEN FreundE, my good friends. 

</p><p>Now let the candidate for the asylum try to memorize
those variations, and see how soon he will be elected. 
One might better go without friends in Germany than take
all this trouble about them.  I have shown what a bother
it is to decline a good (male) friend; well this is
only a third of the work, for there is a variety of new
distortions of the adjective to be learned when the object
is feminine, and still another when the object is neuter. 
Now there are more adjectives in this language than there
are black cats in Switzerland, and they must all be as
elaborately declined as the examples above suggested. 
Difficult?--troublesome?--these words cannot describe it. 
I heard a Californian student in Heidelberg say, in one of
his calmest moods, that he would rather decline two drinks
than one German adjective. 

</p><p>The inventor of the language seems to have taken pleasure
in complicating it in every way he could think of. 
For instance, if one is casually referring to a house,
HAUS, or a horse, PFERD, or a dog, HUND, he spells these
words as I have indicated; but if he is referring to them
in the Dative case, he sticks on a foolish and unnecessary
E and spells them HAUSE, PFERDE, HUNDE.  So, as an added
E often signifies the plural, as the S does with us,
the new student is likely to go on for a month making
twins out of a Dative dog before he discovers his mistake;
and on the other hand, many a new student who could ill
afford loss, has bought and paid for two dogs and only
got one of them, because he ignorantly bought that dog
in the Dative singular when he really supposed he was
talking plural--which left the law on the seller's side,
of course, by the strict rules of grammar, and therefore
a suit for recovery could not lie. 

</p><p>In German, all the Nouns begin with a capital letter. 
Now that is a good idea; and a good idea, in this language,
is necessarily conspicuous from its lonesomeness.  I consider
this capitalizing of nouns a good idea, because by reason
of it you are almost always able to tell a noun the minute
you see it.  You fall into error occasionally, because you
mistake the name of a person for the name of a thing,
and waste a good deal of time trying to dig a meaning
out of it.  German names almost always do mean something,
and this helps to deceive the student.  I translated
a passage one day, which said that "the infuriated tigress
broke loose and utterly ate up the unfortunate fir forest"
(Tannenwald). When I was girding up my loins to doubt this,
I found out that Tannenwald in this instance was a
man's name. 

</p><p>Every noun has a gender, and there is no sense or system
in the distribution; so the gender of each must be
learned separately and by heart.  There is no other way. 
To do this one has to have a memory like a memorandum-book.
In German, a young lady has no sex, while a turnip has. 
Think what overwrought reverence that shows for the turnip,
and what callous disrespect for the girl.  See how it
looks in print--I translate this from a conversation
in one of the best of the German Sunday-school books:

</p><p>"Gretchen. Wilhelm, where is the turnip?

</p><p>"Wilhelm. She has gone to the kitchen. 

</p><p>"Gretchen. Where is the accomplished and beautiful English
maiden?

</p><p>Wilhelm.  It has gone to the opera."

</p><p>To continue with the German genders: a tree is male, its buds
are female, its leaves are neuter; horses are sexless,
dogs are male, cats are female--tomcats included, of course;
a person's mouth, neck, bosom, elbows, fingers, nails, feet,
and body are of the male sex, and his head is male
or neuter according to the word selected to signify it,
and NOT according to the sex of the individual who wears
it--for in Germany all the women either male heads or
sexless ones; a person's nose, lips, shoulders, breast,
hands, and toes are of the female sex; and his hair,
ears, eyes, chin, legs, knees, heart, and conscience
haven't any sex at all.  The inventor of the language
probably got what he knew about a conscience from hearsay. 

</p><p>Now, by the above dissection, the reader will see that in
Germany a man may THINK he is a man, but when he comes to look
into the matter closely, he is bound to have his doubts;
he finds that in sober truth he is a most ridiculous mixture;
and if he ends by trying to comfort himself with the
thought that he can at least depend on a third of this
mess as being manly and masculine, the humiliating second
thought will quickly remind him that in this respect
he is no better off than any woman or cow in the land. 

</p><p>In the German it is true that by some oversight of the inventor
of the language, a Woman is a female; but a Wife (Weib)
is not--which is unfortunate.  A Wife, here, has no sex;
she is neuter; so, according to the grammar, a fish
is HE, his scales are SHE, but a fishwife is neither. 
To describe a wife as sexless may be called under-description;
that is bad enough, but over-description is surely worse. 
A German speaks of an Englishman as the ENGLÄNDER; to change
the sex, he adds INN, and that stands for Englishwoman--
ENGLÄNDERINN. That seems descriptive enough, but still
it is not exact enough for a German; so he precedes the
word with that article which indicates that the creature
to follow is feminine, and writes it down thus: "die
Engländerinn,"--which means "the she-Englishwoman."
I consider that that person is over-described.

</p><p>Well, after the student has learned the sex of a great
number of nouns, he is still in a difficulty, because he
finds it impossible to persuade his tongue to refer
to things as "he" and "she," and "him" and "her," which
it has been always accustomed to refer to it as "it."
When he even frames a German sentence in his mind,
with the hims and hers in the right places, and then works
up his courage to the utterance-point, it is no use--
the moment he begins to speak his tongue files the track
and all those labored males and females come out as "its."
And even when he is reading German to himself, he always
calls those things "it," where as he ought to read in this way:

</p><p>TALE OF THE FISHWIFE AND ITS SAD FATE <a href="#2">[2]</a>

</p><p>It is a bleak Day.  Hear the Rain, how he pours, and the Hail,
how he rattles; and see the Snow, how he drifts along,
and of the Mud, how deep he is! Ah the poor Fishwife,
it is stuck fast in the Mire; it has dropped its Basket
of Fishes; and its Hands have been cut by the Scales
as it seized some of the falling Creatures; and one Scale
has even got into its Eye.  and it cannot get her out. 
It opens its Mouth to cry for Help; but if any Sound comes
out of him, alas he is drowned by the raging of the Storm. 
And now a Tomcat has got one of the Fishes and she
will surely escape with him.  No, she bites off a Fin,
she holds her in her Mouth--will she swallow her? No,
the Fishwife's brave Mother-dog deserts his Puppies and
rescues the Fin--which he eats, himself, as his Reward. 
O, horror, the Lightning has struck the Fish-basket;
he sets him on Fire; see the Flame, how she licks the
doomed Utensil with her red and angry Tongue; now she
attacks the helpless Fishwife's Foot--she burns him up,
all but the big Toe, and even SHE is partly consumed;
and still she spreads, still she waves her fiery Tongues;
she attacks the Fishwife's Leg and destroys IT; she attacks
its Hand and destroys HER also; she attacks the Fishwife's Leg
and destroys HER also; she attacks its Body and consumes HIM;
she wreathes herself about its Heart and IT is consumed;
next about its Breast, and in a Moment SHE is a Cinder;
now she reaches its Neck--He goes; now its Chin--
IT goes; now its Nose--SHE goes.  In another Moment,
except Help come, the Fishwife will be no more. 
Time presses--is there none to succor and save? Yes! Joy,
joy, with flying Feet the she-Englishwoman comes! But alas,
the generous she-Female is too late: where now is
the fated Fishwife? It has ceased from its Sufferings,
it has gone to a better Land; all that is left of it
for its loved Ones to lament over, is this poor smoldering
Ash-heap. Ah, woeful, woeful Ash-heap! Let us take him
up tenderly, reverently, upon the lowly Shovel, and bear
him to his long Rest, with the Prayer that when he rises
again it will be a Realm where he will have one good square
responsible Sex, and have it all to himself, instead of
having a mangy lot of assorted Sexes scattered all over him
in Spots. 

</p><hr>

<p>There, now, the reader can see for himself that this pronoun
business is a very awkward thing for the unaccustomed tongue. 
I suppose that in all languages the similarities of look
and sound between words which have no similarity in meaning
are a fruitful source of perplexity to the foreigner. 
It is so in our tongue, and it is notably the case in
the German.  Now there is that troublesome word VERMÄHLT:
to me it has so close a resemblance--either real or
fancied--to three or four other words, that I never know
whether it means despised, painted, suspected, or married;
until I look in the dictionary, and then I find it means
the latter.  There are lots of such words and they are
a great torment.  To increase the difficulty there are
words which SEEM to resemble each other, and yet do not;
but they make just as much trouble as if they did. 
For instance, there is the word VERMIETHEN (to let,
to lease, to hire); and the word VERHEIRATHEN (another way
of saying to marry). I heard of an Englishman who knocked
at a man's door in Heidelberg and proposed, in the best
German he could command, to "verheirathen" that house. 
Then there are some words which mean one thing when you
emphasize the first syllable, but mean something very
different if you throw the emphasis on the last syllable. 
For instance, there is a word which means a runaway,
or the act of glancing through a book, according to the
placing of the emphasis; and another word which signifies
to ASSOCIATE with a man, or to AVOID him, according to
where you put the emphasis--and you can generally depend
on putting it in the wrong place and getting into trouble. 

</p><p>There are some exceedingly useful words in this language. 
SCHLAG, for example; and ZUG.  There are three-quarters
of a column of SCHLAGS in the dictonary, and a column
and a half of ZUGS.  The word SCHLAG means Blow, Stroke,
Dash, Hit, Shock, Clap, Slap, Time, Bar, Coin, Stamp, Kind,
Sort, Manner, Way, Apoplexy, Wood-cutting, Enclosure,
Field, Forest-clearing. This is its simple and EXACT
meaning--that is to say, its restricted, its fettered meaning;
but there are ways by which you can set it free,
so that it can soar away, as on the wings of the morning,
and never be at rest.  You can hang any word you please
to its tail, and make it mean anything you want to. 
You can begin with SCHLAG-ADER, which means artery,
and you can hang on the whole dictionary, word by word,
clear through the alphabet to SCHLAG-WASSER, which means
bilge-water--and including SCHLAG-MUTTER, which means
mother-in-law.

</p><p>Just the same with ZUG.  Strictly speaking, ZUG means Pull,
Tug, Draught, Procession, March, Progress, Flight, Direction,
Expedition, Train, Caravan, Passage, Stroke, Touch, Line,
Flourish, Trait of Character, Feature, Lineament, Chess-move,
Organ-stop, Team, Whiff, Bias, Drawer, Propensity, Inhalation,
Disposition: but that thing which it does NOT mean--when
all its legitimate pennants have been hung on, has not been
discovered yet. 

</p><p>One cannot overestimate the usefulness of SCHLAG and ZUG. 
Armed just with these two, and the word ALSO, what cannot
the foreigner on German soil accomplish? The German word
ALSO is the equivalent of the English phrase "You know,"
and does not mean anything at all--in TALK, though it
sometimes does in print.  Every time a German opens his
mouth an ALSO falls out; and every time he shuts it he bites
one in two that was trying to GET out. 

</p><p>Now, the foreigner, equipped with these three noble words,
is master of the situation.  Let him talk right along,
fearlessly; let him pour his indifferent German forth,
and when he lacks for a word, let him heave a SCHLAG into
the vacuum; all the chances are that it fits it like a plug,
but if it doesn't let him promptly heave a ZUG after it;
the two together can hardly fail to bung the hole; but if,
by a miracle, they SHOULD fail, let him simply say ALSO!
and this will give him a moment's chance to think of the
needful word.  In Germany, when you load your conversational
gun it is always best to throw in a SCHLAG or two and a ZUG
or two, because it doesn't make any difference how much
the rest of the charge may scatter, you are bound to bag
something with THEM.  Then you blandly say ALSO, and load
up again.  Nothing gives such an air of grace and elegance
and unconstraint to a German or an English conversation
as to scatter it full of "Also's" or "You knows."

</p><p>In my note-book I find this entry:

</p><p>July 1.--In the hospital yesterday, a word of thirteen
syllables was successfully removed from a patient--a
North German from near Hamburg; but as most unfortunately
the surgeons had opened him in the wrong place, under the
impression that he contained a panorama, he died. 
The sad event has cast a gloom over the whole community. 

</p><p>That paragraph furnishes a text for a few remarks about
one of the most curious and notable features of my
subject--the length of German words.  Some German words
are so long that they have a perspective.  Observe these
examples:

</p><p>Freundschaftsbezeigungen. 

</p><p>Dilettantenaufdringlichkeiten. 

</p><p>Stadtverordnetenversammlungen. 

</p><p>These things are not words, they are alphabetical processions. 
And they are not rare; one can open a German newspaper
at any time and see them marching majestically across
the page--and if he has any imagination he can see
the banners and hear the music, too.  They impart
a martial thrill to the meekest subject.  I take a
great interest in these curiosities.  Whenever I come
across a good one, I stuff it and put it in my museum. 
In this way I have made quite a valuable collection. 
When I get duplicates, I exchange with other collectors,
and thus increase the variety of my stock.  Here rare
some specimens which I lately bought at an auction sale
of the effects of a bankrupt bric-a-brac hunter:

</p><p>Generalstaatsverordnetenversammlungen. 

</p><p>Alterthumswissenschaften. 

</p><p>Kinderbewahrungsanstalten. 

</p><p>Unabhaengigkeitserklaerungen. 

</p><p>Wiedererstellungbestrebungen. 

</p><p>Waffenstillstandsunterhandlungen. 

</p><p>Of course when one of these grand mountain ranges goes
stretching across the printed page, it adorns and ennobles
that literary landscape--but at the same time it is a great
distress to the new student, for it blocks up his way;
he cannot crawl under it, or climb over it, or tunnel
through it.  So he resorts to the dictionary for help,
but there is no help there.  The dictionary must draw
the line somewhere--so it leaves this sort of words out. 
And it is right, because these long things are hardly
legitimate words, but are rather combinations of words,
and the inventor of them ought to have been killed. 
They are compound words with the hyphens left out. 
The various words used in building them are in the dictionary,
but in a very scattered condition; so you can hunt
the materials out, one by one, and get at the meaning
at last, but it is a tedious and harassing business. 
I have tried this process upon some of the above examples. 
"Freundshaftsbezeigungen" seems to be "Friendship
demonstrations,"
which is only a foolish and clumsy way of saying "demonstrations
of friendship." "Unabhaengigkeitserklaerungen" seems
to be "Independencedeclarations," which is no improvement
upon "Declarations of Independence," so far as I can see. 
"Generalstaatsverordnetenversammlungen" seems to be
"General-statesrepresentativesmeetings," as nearly as I
can get at it--a mere rhythmical, gushy euphuism for
"meetings of the legislature," I judge.  We used to have
a good deal of this sort of crime in our literature,
but it has gone out now.  We used to speak of a things as a
"never-to-be-forgotten" circumstance, instead of cramping
it into the simple and sufficient word "memorable" and then
going calmly about our business as if nothing had happened. 
In those days we were not content to embalm the thing
and bury it decently, we wanted to build a monument over it. 

</p><p>But in our newspapers the compounding-disease lingers
a little to the present day, but with the hyphens left out,
in the German fashion.  This is the shape it takes:
instead of saying "Mr. Simmons, clerk of the county and
district courts, was in town yesterday," the new form put
it thus: "Clerk of the County and District Courts Simmons
was in town yesterday." This saves neither time nor ink,
and has an awkward sound besides.  One often sees a remark
like this in our papers: "MRS. Assistant District Attorney
Johnson returned to her city residence yesterday for the season."
That is a case of really unjustifiable compounding;
because it not only saves no time or trouble, but confers
a title on Mrs. Johnson which she has no right to. 
But these little instances are trifles indeed, contrasted
with the ponderous and dismal German system of piling
jumbled compounds together.  I wish to submit the following
local item, from a Mannheim journal, by way of illustration:

</p><p>"In the daybeforeyesterdayshortlyaftereleveno'clock Night,
the inthistownstandingtavern called 'The Wagoner' was downburnt. 
When the fire to the onthedownburninghouseresting Stork's
Nest reached, flew the parent Storks away.  But when
the bytheraging, firesurrounded Nest ITSELF caught Fire,
straightway plunged the quickreturning Mother-Stork into
the Flames and died, her Wings over her young ones outspread."

</p><p>Even the cumbersome German construction is not able to
take the pathos out of that picture--indeed, it somehow
seems to strengthen it.  This item is dated away back
yonder months ago.  I could have used it sooner, but I
was waiting to hear from the Father-stork. I am still waiting. 

</p><p>"ALSO!" If I had not shown that the German is a
difficult language, I have at least intended to do so. 
I have heard of an American student who was asked how he
was getting along with his German, and who answered
promptly: "I am not getting along at all.  I have worked
at it hard for three level months, and all I have got
to show for it is one solitary German phrase--'ZWEI GLAS'"
(two glasses of beer). He paused for a moment, reflectively;
then added with feeling: "But I've got that SOLID!"

</p><p>And if I have not also shown that German is a harassing
and infuriating study, my execution has been at fault,
and not my intent.  I heard lately of a worn and sorely
tried American student who used to fly to a certain German
word for relief when he could bear up under his aggravations
no longer--the only word whose sound was sweet and
precious to his ear and healing to his lacerated spirit. 
This was the word DAMIT.  It was only the SOUND that
helped him, not the meaning; <a href="#3">[3]</a> and so, at last, when he
learned that the emphasis was not on the first syllable,
his only stay and support was gone, and he faded away
and died. 

</p><p>I think that a description of any loud, stirring,
tumultuous episode must be tamer in German than in English. 
Our descriptive words of this character have such
a deep, strong, resonant sound, while their German
equivalents do seem so thin and mild and energyless. 
Boom, burst, crash, roar, storm, bellow, blow, thunder,
explosion; howl, cry, shout, yell, groan; battle, hell. 
These are magnificent words; the have a force and magnitude
of sound befitting the things which they describe. 
But their German equivalents would be ever so nice to sing
the children to sleep with, or else my awe-inspiring ears
were made for display and not for superior usefulness
in analyzing sounds.  Would any man want to die in a
battle which was called by so tame a term as a SCHLACHT?
Or would not a comsumptive feel too much bundled up,
who was about to go out, in a shirt-collar and a seal-ring,
into a storm which the bird-song word GEWITTER was employed
to describe? And observe the strongest of the several
German equivalents for explosion--AUSBRUCH.  Our word
Toothbrush is more powerful than that.  It seems to me
that the Germans could do worse than import it into their
language to describe particularly tremendous explosions with. 
The German word for hell--Hölle--sounds more like HELLY
than anything else; therefore, how necessary chipper,
frivolous, and unimpressive it is.  If a man were told
in German to go there, could he really rise to thee
dignity of feeling insulted?

</p><p>Having pointed out, in detail, the several vices of
this language, I now come to the brief and pleasant task
of pointing out its virtues.  The capitalizing of the nouns
I have already mentioned.  But far before this virtue stands
another--that of spelling a word according to the sound of it. 
After one short lesson in the alphabet, the student can tell
how any German word is pronounced without having to ask;
whereas in our language if a student should inquire of us,
"What does B, O, W, spell?" we should be obliged to reply,
"Nobody can tell what it spells when you set if off by itself;
you can only tell by referring to the context and finding
out what it signifies--whether it is a thing to shoot
arrows with, or a nod of one's head, or the forward end of a
boat."

</p><p>There are some German words which are singularly
and powerfully effective.  For instance, those which
describe lowly, peaceful, and affectionate home life;
those which deal with love, in any and all forms,
from mere kindly feeling and honest good will toward
the passing stranger, clear up to courtship; those which
deal with outdoor Nature, in its softest and loveliest
aspects--with meadows and forests, and birds and flowers,
the fragrance and sunshine of summer, and the moonlight
of peaceful winter nights; in a word, those which deal with
any and all forms of rest, respose, and peace; those also
which deal with the creatures and marvels of fairyland;
and lastly and chiefly, in those words which express pathos,
is the language surpassingly rich and affective.  There are
German songs which can make a stranger to the language cry. 
That shows that the SOUND of the words is correct--it
interprets the meanings with truth and with exactness;
and so the ear is informed, and through the ear, the heart. 

</p><p>The Germans do not seem to be afraid to repeat a word
when it is the right one.  they repeat it several times,
if they choose.  That is wise.  But in English, when we
have used a word a couple of times in a paragraph,
we imagine we are growing tautological, and so we are weak
enough to exchange it for some other word which only
approximates exactness, to escape what we wrongly fancy
is a greater blemish.  Repetition may be bad, but surely
inexactness is worse. 

</p><hr>

<p>There are people in the world who will take a great
deal of trouble to point out the faults in a religion
or a language, and then go blandly about their business
without suggesting any remedy.  I am not that kind
of person.  I have shown that the German language
needs reforming.  Very well, I am ready to reform it. 
At least I am ready to make the proper suggestions. 
Such a course as this might be immodest in another; but I
have devoted upward of nine full weeks, first and last,
to a careful and critical study of this tongue, and thus
have acquired a confidence in my ability to reform it
which no mere superficial culture could have conferred
upon me. 

</p><p>In the first place, I would leave out the Dative case. 
It confuses the plurals; and, besides, nobody ever knows
when he is in the Dative case, except he discover it
by accident--and then he does not know when or where it
was that he got into it, or how long he has been in it,
or how he is going to get out of it again.  The Dative case
is but an ornamental folly--it is better to discard it. 

</p><p>In the next place, I would move the Verb further up
to the front.  You may load up with ever so good a Verb,
but I notice that you never really bring down a subject
with it at the present German range--you only cripple it. 
So I insist that this important part of speech should be
brought forward to a position where it may be easily seen
with the naked eye. 

</p><p>Thirdly, I would import some strong words from the English
tongue--to swear with, and also to use in describing
all sorts of vigorous things in a vigorous ways. <a href="#4">[4]</a>

</p><p>Fourthly, I would reorganizes the sexes, and distribute
them accordingly to the will of the creator.  This as
a tribute of respect, if nothing else. 

</p><p>Fifthly, I would do away with those great long
compounded words; or require the speaker to deliver
them in sections, with intermissions for refreshments. 
To wholly do away with them would be best, for ideas are
more easily received and digested when they come one at
a time than when they come in bulk.  Intellectual food
is like any other; it is pleasanter and more beneficial
to take it with a spoon than with a shovel. 

</p><p>Sixthly, I would require a speaker to stop when he is done,
and not hang a string of those useless "haven sind gewesen
gehabt haben geworden seins" to the end of his oration. 
This sort of gewgaws undignify a speech, instead of adding
a grace.  They are, therefore, an offense, and should
be discarded. 

</p><p>Seventhly, I would discard the Parenthesis.  Also the
reparenthesis,
the re-reparenthesis, and the re-re-re-re-re-reparentheses,
and likewise the final wide-reaching all-enclosing
king-parenthesis. I would require every individual,
be he high or low, to unfold a plain straightforward tale,
or else coil it and sit on it and hold his peace. 
Infractions of this law should be punishable with death. 

</p><p>And eighthly, and last, I would retain ZUG and SCHLAG,
with their pendants, and discard the rest of the vocabulary. 
This would simplify the language. 

</p><p>I have now named what I regard as the most necessary
and important changes.  These are perhaps all I could
be expected to name for nothing; but there are other
suggestions which I can and will make in case my proposed
application shall result in my being formally employed
by the government in the work of reforming the language. 

</p><p>My philological studies have satisfied me that a gifted person
ought to learn English (barring spelling and pronouncing)
in thirty hours, French in thirty days, and German
in thirty years.  It seems manifest, then, that the
latter tongue ought to be trimmed down and repaired. 
If it is to remain as it is, it ought to be gently
and reverently set aside among the dead languages,
for only the dead have time to learn it. 

</p><p>A FOURTH OF JULY ORATION IN THE GERMAN TONGUE, DELIVERED AT
A BANQUET OF THE ANGLO-AMERICAN CLUB OF STUDENTS BY THE
AUTHOR OF THIS BOOK

</p><p>Gentlemen: Since I arrived, a month ago, in this
old wonderland, this vast garden of Germany, my English
tongue has so often proved a useless piece of baggage
to me, and so troublesome to carry around, in a country
where they haven't the checking system for luggage, that I
finally set to work, and learned the German language. 
Also! Es freut mich dass dies so ist, denn es muss,
in ein haupts:achlich degree, h:oflich sein, dass man
auf ein occasion like this, sein Rede in die Sprache des
Landes worin he boards, aussprechen soll.  Daf:ur habe ich,
aus reinische Verlegenheit--no, Vergangenheit--no, I
mean Hoflichkeit--aus reinishe Hoflichkeit habe ich
resolved to tackle this business in the German language,
um Gottes willen! Also! Sie müssen so freundlich sein,
und verzeih mich die interlarding von ein oder zwei
Englischer Worte, hie und da, denn ich finde dass die
deutsche is not a very copious language, and so when
you've really got anything to say, you've got to draw
on a language that can stand the strain. 

</p><p>Wenn haber man kann nicht meinem Rede Verstehen, so werde
ich ihm sp:ater dasselbe :ubersetz, wenn er solche Dienst
verlangen wollen haben werden sollen sein h:atte. (I don't
know what wollen haben werden sollen sein hätte means,
but I notice they always put it at the end of a German
sentence--merely for general literary gorgeousness,
I suppose.)

</p><p>This is a great and justly honored day--a day which is
worthy of the veneration in which it is held by the true
patriots of all climes and nationalities--a day which
offers a fruitful theme for thought and speech; und meinem
Freunde--no, meinEN FreundEN--meinES FreundES--well,
take your choice, they're all the same price; I don't
know which one is right--also! ich habe gehabt haben
worden gewesen sein, as Goethe says in his Paradise
Lost--ich--ich--that is to say--ich--but let us change cars. 

</p><div><p>Also! Die Anblich so viele Grossbrittanischer und Amerikanischer
hier zusammengetroffen in Bruderliche concord, ist zwar
a welcome and inspiriting spectacle.  And what has moved you
to it? Can the terse German tongue rise to the expression of
this impulse? Is it Freundschaftsbezeigungenstadtverordneten-
versammlungenfamilieneigenth:umlichkeiten? Nein,
o nein! This is a crisp and noble word, but it fails
to pierce the marrow of the impulse which has gathered
this friendly meeting and produced diese Anblick--eine
Anblich welche ist gut zu sehen--gut für die Augen
in a foreign land and a far country--eine Anblick solche
als in die gew:ohnliche Heidelberger phrase nennt man ein
"schönes Aussicht!" Ja, freilich natürlich wahrscheinlich
ebensowohl! Also! Die Aussicht auf dem Konigsstuhl
mehr gr:osser ist, aber geistlische sprechend nicht so
schön, lob' Gott! Because sie sind hier zusammengetroffen,
in Bruderlichem concord, ein grossen Tag zu feirn,
whose high benefits were not for one land and one locality,
but have conferred a measure of good upon all lands
that know liberty today, and love it.  Hundert Jahre
vor¨ber, waren die Engländer und die Amerikaner Feinde;
aber heut sind sie herzlichen Freunde, Gott sei Dank!
May this good-fellowship endure; may these banners here
blended in amity so remain; may they never any more wave
over opposing hosts, or be stained with blood which
was kindred, is kindred, and always will be kindred,
until a line drawn upon a map shall be able to say:
"THIS bars the ancestral blood from flowing in the veins
of the descendant!"

ladies who could not be induced to commit a sin by any persuasion
or compulsion, promptly rip out one of these harmless little
words when they tear their dresses or don't like the soup.  It
sounds about as wicked as our "My gracious." German ladies are
constantly saying, "Ach! Gott!" "Mein Gott!" "Gott in Himmel!"
"Herr Gott" "Der Herr Jesus!" etc.  They think our ladies have
the same custom, perhaps; for I once heard a gentle and lovely
old German lady say to a sweet young American girl: "The two
languages are so alike--how pleasant that is; we say 'Ach! Gott!'
you say 'Goddamn.'"

<pre><code>ollama@ollamas-computer ~ % ollama run llama4:scout
&gt;&gt;&gt; what do you see in this image?  /Users/ollama/Downloads/multimodal-example1.png 
Added image '/Users/ollama/Downloads/multimodal-example1.png'
The image depicts a scenic waterfront area with a prominent clock tower at its center. The clock tower, likely the Ferry Building Clock Tower in San Francisco, features a tall structure with a clock face on each side and an American flag flying atop. 

In the foreground, there are several buildings, including what appears to be a marketplace or shopping center, with a parking lot and a street lined with cars. The background showcases a large body of water, possibly a bay or harbor, with a bridge visible in the distance. The sky above is blue with white clouds, suggesting a daytime setting with pleasant weather conditions.

Overall, the image presents a picturesque view of a waterfront area, highlighting the iconic clock tower and the surrounding architecture, as well as the natural beauty of the bay and sky.

&gt;&gt;&gt; how far is this building from the stanford campus in palo alto? 
The distance between the Ferry Building in San Francisco and the Stanford University campus in Palo Alto is approximately 35 miles (56 kilometers). The drive typically takes around 45-60 minutes, depending on traffic conditions.

&gt;&gt;&gt; what's the best way to get there? 
The best way to get to Stanford University from the Ferry Building in San Francisco depends on your preferences and budget. Here are a few options:

1. **By Car**: Take US-101 South to CA-85 South, then continue on CA-101 South. The journey takes around 45-60 minutes, depending on traffic.

2. **By Train and Shuttle**: Take Caltrain from the San Francisco Station (4th and King Streets) to the Palo Alto Station. From there, you can take the Stanford University shuttle (Red and White) to campus. The total travel time is around 1 hour and 15 minutes.

3. **By Ride-hailing Services**: Uber or Lyft from San Francisco to Stanford University takes around 45-60 minutes, depending on traffic.

Please check for any service disruptions or schedule changes before your trip.

<h3>Gemma 3</h3>

<p>Example of giving multiple images and asking about their relations.</p>

<p>This demonstrates how a user can input multiple images at once, or do so via follow up prompts and ask about the images.</p>

Added image '/Users/ollama/Downloads/img2.png'
Added image '/Users/ollama/Downloads/img3.png'
Added image '/Users/ollama/Downloads/img4.png'

The animal featured in all four images is a **llama**.

&gt;&gt;&gt; is there a marine mammal in one of the images? 
Yes! You are absolutely right to spot that. 

In the first image, there’s a **dolphin** (whale) boxing with the llama.

&gt;&gt;&gt; in the boxing image, is the llama more likely to win or the whale? 

That’s a fantastic question! Given the image, the llama is *much* more likely to win. 

Here’s why:

*   **Punching Power:** The llama is clearly throwing a punch with a closed fist, demonstrating intent and force.

*   **Whale’s Reaction:** The whale is clearly recoiling in pain and fear.

It's a comical mismatch, but the llama has the upper hand in this boxing match!

<h2>Ollama’s new multimodal engine</h2>

<p><img src="https://ollama.com/public/blog/ollama-car.png" alt="Ollama’s new car"></p>

<p>Ollama has so far relied on the <a href="https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp">ggml-org/llama.cpp</a> project for model support and has instead focused on ease of use and model portability.</p>

<p>As more multimodal models are released by major research labs, the task of supporting these models the way Ollama intends became more and more challenging.</p>

<p>We set out to support a new engine that makes multimodal models first-class citizens, and getting Ollama’s partners to contribute more directly the community - the GGML tensor library.</p>

<p><strong>What does this mean?</strong></p>

<p>To sum it up, this work is to improve the reliability and accuracy of Ollama’s local inference, and to set the foundations for supporting future modalities with more capabilities - i.e. speech, image generation, video generation, longer context sizes, improved tool support for models.</p>

<p>Let’s break down a couple specific areas:</p>

<h4>Model modularity</h4>

<p>Our goal is to confine each model’s “blast radius” to itself—improving reliability and making it easier for creators and developers to integrate new models.</p>

<p>Today, <em>ggml/llama.cpp</em> offers first-class support for text-only models. For multimodal systems, however, the <strong>text decoder</strong> and <strong>vision encoder</strong> are split into separate models and executed independently. Passing image embeddings from the vision model into the text model therefore demands model-specific logic in the orchestration layer that can break specific model implementations.</p>

<p>Within Ollama, each model is fully self-contained and can expose its own projection layer, aligned with how that model was trained. This isolation lets model creators implement and ship their code without patching multiple files or adding cascading <code>if</code> statements. They no longer need to understand a shared multimodal projection function or worry about breaking other models—they can focus solely on their own model and its training.</p>

<p>Examples of how some models are implemented are available on <a href="https://github.com/ollama/ollama/tree/main/model/models">Ollama’s GitHub repository</a>.</p>

<h4>Accuracy</h4>

<p>Large images produce large number of tokens which may exceed the batch size. Processing this correctly with the right positional information is challenging specifically when a single image crosses boundaries.</p>

<p>Ollama adds metadata as it processes images to help improve accuracy.</p>

<p>Some examples:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Should causal attention be on / off?</p></li>

<li><p>Is it possible to split the image embeddings into batches for processing, and if possible, what are the boundaries when accounting for quality of output, and the computer being used for inference? If an image is split in the wrong place, the quality of output goes down. This is usually defined by the model, and can be checked in its paper?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Many other local inference tools implement this differently; while a similar result may be achieved, it does not follow how the models were designed and trained.</p>

<h4>Memory management</h4>

<p><strong>Image caching</strong></p>

<p>Once an image is processed, Ollama caches it so later prompts are faster; the image remains in cache while it is still being used and is not discarded for memory-cleanup limits.</p>

<p><strong>Memory estimation &amp; KV cache optimizations</strong></p>

<p>Ollama collaborates with hardware manufacturers and an operating system partner to make sure the correct hardware metadata is detected for Ollama to better estimate and optimize for memory usage. For many firmware releases, partners will validate/test it against Ollama to minimize regression and to benchmark against new features.</p>

<p>Ollama has some KV cache optimizations to improve how memory can be efficiently used. Ollama configures causal attention at the individual model level instead of configuring as a group.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Google DeepMind’s Gemma 3 leverages sliding window attention, and Ollama can leverage that to allocate a subset or a portion of the model’s context length to improve performance, and because of the memory efficiency, this means we can increase the context length of the model on the same system or use the remaining memory for higher concurrency.</p></li>

<li><p>To uniquely support <strong>Meta’s Llama 4 Scout and Maverick models</strong>, Ollama has implemented chunked attention, attention tuning to support longer context size, specific 2D rotary embedding, and in the mixture-of-experts type of model.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>If a model’s attention layer isn’t fully implemented, such as sliding window attention or chunked attention, it may still <em>‘work’</em>. However, because this isn’t how the model was trained, the end user may begin to see erratic or degraded output by the model itself over time. This becomes especially prominent the longer the context / sequence due to cascading effects.</p>

<h3>What’s next</h3>

<ul>
<li>Support longer context sizes</li>
<li>Support thinking / reasoning</li>
<li>Tool calling with streaming responses</li>
<li>Enabling computer use</li>
</ul>

<h3>Acknowledgements</h3>

<p><strong>Models</strong></p>

<p>Thank you to the teams working to release openly available and powerful vision models - Google DeepMind, Meta Llama, Alibaba Qwen, Mistral, IBM Granite, and the many countless people &amp; labs in the community.</p>

<p><strong>GGML</strong></p>

<p>Thank you to the GGML team for the tensor library that powers Ollama’s inference – accessing GGML directly from Go has given a portable way to design custom inference graphs and tackle harder model architectures not available before in Ollama.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I always knew Elizabeth Holmes would have a second act. But I’m shocked it’s starting while she’s still behind bars.</p>



<p>Elizabeth is now serving an 11-year sentence for defrauding investors in Theranos and has been <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/01/19/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-banned-government-health-programs/">banned</a> from participating in federal health programs. The company was built on her claim that, at 19 years old, she had invented a device capable of running hundreds of tests from just a single drop of blood. It was a bold vision that captivated the world, and a story everyone wanted to believe — <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2019/05/01/from-protegee-to-whistleblower-a-former-theranos-scientist-says-elizabeth-holmes-should-come-forward-and-apologize/">including me</a>.</p>



<p>Now her partner, Billy Evans, has founded a company called <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/05/12/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-partner-new-biotech-startup-haemanthus-analysts-reaction/">Haemanthus</a>, which also touts a diagnostic blood-testing device that uses only small amounts of blood. While Elizabeth has no legal affiliation with the company, her fingerprints and pricks are all over it. Even the naming convention feels familiar: Instead of combining the Greek roots of therapeía and diagnosis like she did with Theranos, this time it’s haema and anthos<em> </em>— Greek for “blood” and “flower.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Since she reported to prison about two years ago, by far the most common question people have asked me is: “Did Elizabeth start Theranos with the intention to revolutionize health care, or did she intend to commit fraud from the start?” I think the answer is neither. While I wasn’t there in the early days, I believe Elizabeth started Theranos in the pursuit of fame. She wanted to be the female Steve Jobs. She wanted to be known as the youngest self-made female billionaire, fly in private jets, advise the president, rub shoulders with Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk. She wanted to be on the cover of magazines. And she got what she wanted. Just a few months ago, she was on the cover of People magazine. Let me repeat: Even from prison, she’s landing on the cover of People magazine.</p>



<p>As the news of Haemanthus broke, I started to hear a similar question: “Do you think Haemanthus intends to revolutionize health care, or do you think it’s another fraud?” Once again — neither. I think it’s just another chapter of her narrative.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anyone who thought this story was over doesn’t know Elizabeth and her ability to craft a narrative. When she leaves prison, there’s no doubt she’ll manage to appear remorseful without admitting guilt. And if she’s credited with launching a company from a prison cell? That’s more legendary than the Hewlett-Packard garage or Mark Zuckerberg’s dorm room. It’s a story so compelling, people will want it to be true.</p>



<p>Elizabeth is more than a masterful storyteller. She writes the story. Every detail is meticulously chosen to build her narrative, captivate her audience, and distort reality. The black turtleneck, deep voice, college dropout — the parallels with Steve Jobs were no accident.&nbsp;</p>





<p>The very first time I met her, Elizabeth told my grandfather, George Shultz (who served in the&nbsp;Cabinet in the Nixon and Reagan administrations and became a member of the Theranos board), and then-Sen. Dianne Feinstein that Quest and LabCorp would eventually try to take her down. She was planting the seeds of a conspiracy years before she would need to lean on it. She also told us Theranos would never go public, preempting pressure from investors. She completely controlled the narrative from day one.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Elizabeth I knew would openly talk about her decision to not have friends, to never date, to never have kids, all because she was devoted to Theranos. (This, of course, was another lie. She was dating Sunny Balwani, the COO and president of the company.) However, when motherhood made for a useful character reboot, she became one — twice. Her first child arrived just days before her trial was set to begin, and her second between her conviction and sentencing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before her sentencing, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/07/business/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-interview.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York Times</a> wrote about how she had become “Liz,” the devoted mother and volunteer who had ditched the black turtleneck. The article even included carefully posed photographs of Elizabeth with her two children. I feel profound sadness for those kids. Most parents would try to shield their children from that type of attention, but Elizabeth put them front and center, using them the same way she used to use her black turtleneck. They were props to support the narrative she was writing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Similarly, I suspect that Haemanthus’ purpose is not to build a product that will improve the lives of people (or their pets — materials for potential investors say that they plan to start with veterinary medicine). Nor is it to make VC returns.&nbsp;</p>


		
		


<p>The purpose is to build something that works, so that she can point to it and say, “See, I would have figured it out. Theranos was never a fraud.” If Haemanthus’ technology does indeed work and she eventually makes that claim, whatever reporter she’s chosen to interview her needs to ask, “How many tens of thousands of people were you willing to hurt on the path to building something that worked?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>This raises another question I’ve been asked this week: “Do you think the technology will work?” Probably not, but I don’t have enough information to really know. Raman spectroscopy has been used for nearly 100 years and hasn’t achieved the resolution needed to perform this type of blood testing from a few drops of blood. Maybe two additional light sources, as described in Haemanthus’ patent, combined with AI solves the resolution problems, but consider me a skeptic until a third party validates its method. Over the past few years a number of people have reached out to me saying they’ve invented “the Theranos that works,” and several of them have concepts similar to this: apply AI to a mountain of noise and get a thousand test results. While many actually do have innovative approaches, none have come close to realizing the Theranos vision.&nbsp;</p>





<p>It’s been reported that Haemanthus aims to raise $50 million, and I have little doubt it’ll succeed. Billy Evans is independently wealthy, an heir to a Southern California hotel chain, so it’s likely a significant portion will be self-funded. And I can think of at least one outside investor who might get involved. Tim Draper, Elizabeth’s former neighbor and one of Theranos’ earliest backers, has maintained an unusual and unwavering loyalty to her. Even after her conviction, he continues to publicly defend her. Draper seems to be as invested in the narrative as she is, and is in a position to fund a company simply for the sake of that narrative.&nbsp;</p>



<p>My advice to prospective Haemanthus investors is this: Ask yourself what motivates Elizabeth Holmes. Money? Possibly. But when she walks out of prison, she’ll be returning to a partner who’s already a millionaire many times over. Mission? I think she’s thoroughly proven that she doesn’t care about improving the lives of patients. The real question is: Will Elizabeth serve the purpose of your fund — or by investing in her, will you simply be serving her purpose of writing her rise-from-the-ashes narrative?</p>



<p>Failed founders deserve second chances. But at Theranos, Elizabeth had a thousand chances — opportunities to listen to her scientists, to tell the truth to her board and investors, to change course and right the ship. At each opportunity she consistently showed poor judgement and a lack of character. Even when the Wall Street Journal began reporting on the company, she still had hundreds of millions in the bank, world-class scientists on payroll, and the most prestigious board in Silicon Valley. In that moment, she had more resources, talent, and opportunity than most founders will ever see — and she blew it.</p>



<p>She’s not Edison. This isn’t going to work on the thousand-and-first try.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="below-the-fold">

<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<h2>About Teal</h2>
<p>
Teal is a statically-typed dialect of <a href="https://www.lua.org/">Lua</a>.
It extends Lua with type annotations, allowing you to specify arrays, maps and records,
as well as interfaces, union types and generics.
</p>
<p>
It aims to fill a niche similar to that of TypeScript in the JavaScript world,
but adhering to Lua's spirit of minimalism, portability and embeddability.
</p>
<p>
Is it implemented as a compiler, <a href="https://github.com/teal-language/tl">tl</a>,
which compiles <tt>.tl</tt> source code into <tt>.lua</tt> files.
</p>

<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<h2>A taste of Teal</h2>
<p>
Here is a quick taste of what Teal code looks like:
</p>
<pre><b>local function</b> add(a: <span>number</span>, b: <span>number</span>): <span>number</span>
   <b>return</b> a + b
<b>end</b>

<b>local</b> s = add(1, 2)
print(s)
</pre>
<p>
...or check out this page's source code!
</p>
<p>
You can also play with the Teal compiler right from your browser,
using the <a href="https://teal-playground.netlify.app/" target="_blank">Teal Playground</a>.
</p>

<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<h2>Install Teal</h2>
<p>
If you're using <a href="https://luarocks.org/">LuaRocks</a>, you can install the compiler with:
</p>
<pre>luarocks install tl
</pre>
<p>
You can also find <a href="https://github.com/teal-language/tl/releases">pre-compiled
binaries</a> for Linux and Windows.</p>
<p>
To build larger projects, you probably won't want to run <tt>tl</tt> on each
file individually. We recommend using <a href="https://github.com/teal-language/cyan">Cyan</a>,
the build tool designed for Teal.
</p>
<p>
You can also install <a href="https://github.com/teal-language/vscode-teal/">vscode-teal</a> for
Visual Studio Code integration, <a href="https://github.com/teal-language/teal-language-server/">teal-language-server</a>
for NeoVim and others, and <a href="https://github.com/teal-language/awesome-teal">more</a>.
</p>

<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>
You can browse the Teal documentation <a href="https://teal-language.org/book/index.html">online</a>.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>NASA has revived a set of thrusters on the nearly 50-year-old Voyager 1 spacecraft after declaring them inoperable over two decades ago.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's a nice long-distance engineering win for the team at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, responsible for keeping the <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/11/09/voyager_closes_in_on_a/">venerable Voyager spacecraft</a> flying - and a critical one at that, as clogging fuel lines threatened to derail the backup thrusters currently in use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The things you have to deal with when your spacecraft is operating more than four decades beyond its original mission plan, eh? Voyager 1 launched in 1977.</p>

    

<p>JPL <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-voyager-1-revives-backup-thrusters-before-command-pause/?utm_source=iContact&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=1-nasajpl&amp;utm_content=voyager20250514" rel="nofollow">reported</a> Wednesday that the maneuver, completed in March, restarted Voyager 1's primary roll thrusters, which are used to keep the spacecraft aligned with a tracking star. That guide star helps keep its high-gain antenna aimed at Earth, now over 15.6 billion miles away, and far beyond the reach of any telescope.</p>

        


        

<p>Those primary roll thrusters stopped working in 2004 after a pair of internal heaters lost power. Voyager engineers long believed they were broken and unfixable. The backup roll thrusters in use are now at risk due to residue buildup in their fuel lines, which could cause failure as early as this fall.</p>
<p>Without roll thrusters, Voyager 1 would lose its ability to stay properly oriented and eventually drift out of contact. To make matters worse, the only antenna on Earth with enough power to send commands to the Voyager probes - the 230-foot-wide DSS-43 dish in Australia - is undergoing an upgrade shutdown until next February, with only a couple of brief operational windows in August and December.</p>

        

<p>While other dishes around the world can still receive data from the Voyagers, those windows are the only opportunities to send commands to the spacecraft, which remain the most distant human-made objects in existence.</p>

</ul>
<h3>Do and maybe die; don't do and definitely die</h3>
<p>With a hard deadline in place, the Voyager team had few options. So it turned to the primary roll thrusters that failed in 2004 - with a big IF in mind.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>If</em> those heaters weren't actually dead, and <em>if</em> a power switch had been flipped by a circuit disturbance, then restoring that switch might bring the thrusters back online and preserve control of the spacecraft if the backup system failed.</p>
<p>The idea was to restore heater power to the primary roll thrusters, then let Voyager 1 drift far enough from its guide star that its onboard system would automatically fire the thrusters to correct its course.</p>
<p>If the heaters were still off when the dormant thrusters auto-fired due to attitude drift, "it could trigger a small explosion," JPL noted. And since it takes the radio signal more than 23 hours to travel from Voyager back to Earth, the team wouldn't know for an entire day.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>

<p>It was yet another miracle save for Voyager</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fortunately, as the return signal arrived, the Voyager team saw signs that the thruster heaters were back online and the effort was a success.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"These thrusters were considered dead. And that was a legitimate conclusion," Voyager mission propulsion leader Todd Barber said in JPL's report. "It's just that one of our engineers had this insight that maybe there was this other possible cause and it was fixable. It was yet another miracle save for Voyager."</p>

        

<p>The Voyager missions have faced many challenges since leaving Earth more than 47 years ago. Most recently, Voyager 1 spent months <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/03/14/voyager_1_not_dead/">returning gibberish</a> instead of usable data before being fixed, and both probes have had to <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/03/06/voyager_power_down/">switch off</a> <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/10/03/voyager_2_plasma_instrument/">scientific instruments</a> as power dwindles and systems fail. <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/09/12/voyager_power_issues/">Thruster</a> <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2017/12/04/voyager_1_mission_extension_thanks_assmbler_code_and_thrusters_unused_since_1980/">issues</a> have also been a problem for Voyager 1 before, but the little craft that could <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/06/14/voyager_1_restored/">continue to soldier on</a> at the edge of interstellar space.</p>
<p>Both spacecraft will go dark eventually, closing our most distant eye into the universe beyond our solar system. But not quite yet.&nbsp;®</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>
      With the following code, we can check whether a year 0 ≤ <i>y</i> ≤ 102499 is a leap year with only about 3 CPU instructions:
    </p>
  
    <pre><code>bool is_leap_year_fast(uint32_t y) {
    return ((y * 1073750999) &amp; 3221352463) &lt;= 126976;
}</code></pre>
      
    <p>How does this work? The answer is surprisingly complex. This article explains it, mostly to have some fun with bit-twiddling; at the end, I'll briefly discuss the practical use.</p>
      
    <p>This is how a leap year check is typically implemented:</p>

    <pre><code>bool is_leap_year(uint32_t y) {
    if ((y % 4) != 0) return false;
    if ((y % 100) != 0) return true;
    if ((y % 400) == 0) return true;
    return false;
}</code></pre>

    <p>We are using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proleptic_Gregorian_calendar">proleptic Gregorian calendar</a>, which extends the Gregorian calendar backward from its introduction in 1582 and includes a year 0. Thus, we don't need to treat years before 1582 any differently. For simplicity, we ignore negative years and use an unsigned year.</p>

    <h2>Optimizing the standard approach</h2>

    <p>Let's first do some simple speedups so that we get a good baseline. I'm not sure where to assign credit – these tricks have probably been reinvented independently many times.</p>

    <p>We can replace <code>(y % 100) != 0</code> by <code>(y % 25) != 0</code>: we already know that <code>y</code> is a multiple of 2<sup>2</sup>, so if it is also a multiple of 5<sup>2</sup>, it is a multiple of 2<sup>2</sup> ⋅ 5<sup>2</sup> = 100. Similarly, we can replace <code>(y % 400) == 0</code> by <code>(y % 16) == 0</code>: we already know that <i>y</i> is a multiple of 5<sup>2</sup>, so if it is also a multiple of 2<sup>4</sup>, it is a multiple of 5<sup>2</sup> ⋅ 2<sup>4</sup> = 400.</p>

    <pre><code>bool is_leap_year1(uint32_t y) {
    if ((y % 4) != 0) return false;
    if ((y % 25) != 0) return true;
    if ((y % 16) == 0) return true;
    return false;
}</code></pre>
      
    <p>This is useful because we can now replace modulo by 4 and by 16 with bit masking. There is a further trick well-known to compiler implementors on how to lower the modulo by 25. Compiling <code>(x % 25) != 0</code> with gcc and translating back to C, we get <code>x * 3264175145 &gt; 171798691</code>. With multiplication at a typical latency of 3 cycles and modulo of at least 20 cycles, this is a great improvement. I will only give an intuition on how it works; more details can be found in
    </p><ul>
      <li><a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/spe.2689">Faster remainder by direct computation: Applications to compilers and software libraries</a> paper by Daniel Lemire, Owen Kaser, and Nathan Kurz for lowering modulo by a constant in general;</li>
      <li><a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/spe.3172">Euclidean affine functions and their application to calendar algorithms</a> by Cassio Neri and Lorenz Schneider more specifically for calendar calculations; and</li>
      <li><a href="https://davecturner.github.io/2020/08/07/leapyear-optimization.html">Identifying leap years</a> by David Turner for the leap year check (including formal proofs!).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Where do the magic numbers come from? We have</p>

    <p><span>2<sup>32</sup> ⋅ 19/25 = 3264175144.96 (exactly).</span>
    </p>

    <p>So by multiplying with 3264175145, we calculate approximately the fractional part of multiplying with (19/25). If this was an exact multiplication, we would get a fractional part of zero for multiples of 25. We multiply with a number that is too high by 0.04 though, so the error can be up to 0.04 ⋅ (2<sup>32</sup> - 1) = 171798691.8, which is where the second magic number comes from.</p>

    <p>This trick doesn't work quite as nicely for <code>x % 100</code>, where we need one more fixup instruction, so the reduction from <code>y % 100</code> to <code>y % 25</code> was helpful.</p>

    <p>Our leap year check now looks like this:
    </p><pre><code>bool is_leap_year2(uint32_t y) {
    if ((y &amp; 3) != 0) return false;
    if (y * 3264175145u &gt; 171798691u) return true;
    if ((y &amp; 15) == 0) return true;
    return false;
}</code></pre>

    <p>Note that modern compilers like gcc or clang will produce <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/GeK6Trfx6">something</a> like <code>is_leap_year2</code> from <code>is_leap_year1</code>, so there is not much point in doing this in C source, but it might be useful in other programming languages.</p>

    <p>This code typically compiles to branching assembly. In practice, inputs are typically fairly predictable, so that is not necessarily bad. If we want to avoid branch misprediction penalties, at the price of also slowing down the best case, we can shuffle things around a bit and get <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/PWs8saMYd">branchless code</a> (and also a decent code golf candidate):</p>
    <pre><code>bool is_leap_year3(uint32_t y) {
    return !(y &amp; ((y % 25) ? 3 : 15));
}</code></pre>

    </p><h2>Finding a bit-twiddling approach</h2>

    <p>Can we improve the leap year calculation by giving up on correctness for all inputs? After all, we typically don't care whether the year 3584536493 is a leap year; indeed, Python, C#, and Go only support years 0 (or 1) to 9999 (at which point the drift relative to the seasons is already more than 4 days). My thought was that if something shorter exists, it will basically look like some weird hashing using magic constants, so I wanted to try some small forms and guess the constants by brute force. The form <code>(y * f) &lt;= t</code> seems useful but is not powerful enough yet. One of my candidates was adding a mask: <code>((y * f) &amp; m) &lt;= t</code>. Now we have 96 bits to guess, which is not feasible by brute force alone. Let's use <a href="https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3">z3</a>, a solver that supports bitvector constraints that is perfectly suited for this:</p>

    <pre><code>import z3

BITS = 32
f, m, t, y = z3.BitVecs('f m t y', BITS)

def target(y):
    return z3.And((y &amp; 3) == 0, z3.Or(z3.URem(y, 25) != 0, (y &amp; 15) == 0))

def candidate(x):
    return z3.ULE((x * f) &amp; m, t)

solver = z3.Solver()
solver.add(z3.ForAll(y, z3.Implies(z3.ULE(y, 400),
                                   candidate(y) == target(y))))

if solver.check() == z3.sat:
    print(f'found solution: {solver.model()}')
else:
    print('no solution found')
</code></pre>

    <p>In a few seconds, this finds constants that yield the correct result for a nontrivial year range. Extending the range, I eventually found constants that yield the correct result from year 0 up to the year 102499, in about half an hour of computation time, and proved that this is the optimum for 32 bits:</p>

    <pre><code>bool is_leap_year_fast(uint32_t y) {
    const uint32_t f = 1073750999u;
    const uint32_t m = 3221352463u;
    const uint32_t t = 126976u;
    return ((y * f) &amp; m) &lt;= t;
}</code></pre>

    <h2>Explanation</h2>

    <p>How does it work? It seems surprising, almost magic, that we can squeeze all these computations into three instructions. However, the considerations above give us most of the tools to understand it.</p>

    <p>Here's our constants in binary, with four relevant bit ranges indicated by letters:</p>

    <pre>   <span>A</span>                 <span>D</span>
f: <span>01</span>0000000000000000<span>10001111010111</span>
m: <span>11</span>0000000000000<span>11111</span>00000000<span>1111</span>
t: <span>00</span>0000000000000<span>11111</span>00000000<span>0000</span>
                  <span>B</span>            <span>C</span>
</pre>

    <p>Let's first consider for the product <i>p</i> := <i>y</i> ⋅ <i>f</i> what the masking with <i>m</i> and comparison with <i>t</i> does. In block <i>A</i>, the bits in <i>t</i> are 0, and therefore, the result is false as soon as any bit in <i>A</i> is set in <i>p</i>. Otherwise, block <i>B</i> becomes relevant. Here all bits in <i>t</i> are 1, so the result is true as soon as any bit in <i>B</i> is unset in <i>p</i>. Otherwise, for block <i>C</i> we require that all bits are unset in <i>p</i>. In this way, a bunch of comparisons of bit ranges are all united into a single <code>&lt;=</code>.</p>

    <p>Thus, we could rewrite <code>is_leap_year_fast</code> as follows:
    </p><pre><code>bool is_leap_year_fast2(uint32_t y) {
    uint32_t p = y * 1073750999u;
    const uint32_t A = 0b11000000000000000000000000000000;
    const uint32_t B = 0b00000000000000011111000000000000;
    const uint32_t C = 0b00000000000000000000000000001111;
    if ((p &amp; A) != 0) return false;
    if ((p &amp; B) != B) return true;
    if ((p &amp; C) == 0) return true;
    return false;
}</code></pre>

    <p>That looks suspiciously like <code>is_leap_year2</code>! And indeed, the three conditions have exactly the same purpose. We'll show
      </p><ol>
	<li> <code>(p &amp; A) != 0</code> triggers when <code>(y % 4) != 0</code>;</li>
	<li> <code>(p &amp; B) != B</code> triggers when <code>(y % 100) != 0</code>;</li>
	<li> <code>(p &amp; C) == 0</code> triggers when <code>(y % 16) == 0</code> (and therefore <code>(y % 400) == 0</code>, since we already know <i>y</i> is a multiple of 25).</li>
      </ol>

    <h3>Two easy cases: (1) and (3)</h3>
          
    <p>(1): The 1 bit in <i>A</i> in <i>f</i> reproduces the two low bits of <i>y</i> into <i>p</i> at <i>A</i>. This cannot be clobbered by the result of the multiplication with the bits in <i>D</i>: the maximum value we can get is 102499 ⋅ (f &amp; D) = 940428325, which has only 30 bits. Thus, checking that A is zero in p is equivalent to checking whether <i>y</i> is 0 modulo 4.</p>

    <p>(3): Checking that none of the lowest 4 bits is set in <i>p</i> is checking whether <i>p</i> is 0 modulo 16. However, we actually want to check <i>y</i>. This is no problem: It suffices to look only at the lowest 4 bits of <i>f</i>, and <i>f</i> is 1111<sub>2</sub> = 15 there. Multiplying with 15 = 3 ⋅ 5 introduces no additional factor of 2, so divisibility by 16 is unchanged.
    

    </p><h3>The interesting case: (2)</h3>

    <p>Next, let's try to find out for which numbers <i>p</i> &amp; <i>B</i> ≠ <i>B</i>. For this, the 1 bit in <i>f</i> &amp; <i>A</i> does not play a role, so consider the bits in <i>f</i> &amp; <i>D</i>. They are 10001111010111<sub>2</sub> = 9175. Let's see for which numbers the test hits.</p>

    <pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; B = 0b00000000000000011111000000000000
&gt;&gt;&gt; s = [y for y in range(5000) if ((y * 9175) &amp; B) == B]
&gt;&gt;&gt; for i in range(0, len(s), 16): print(*(f'{n:4d}' for n in s[i:i+16]))

</code></pre>

    <p>Multiples of 100 are here as desired, but also a bunch of other numbers. This is not a problem as long as none of them are a multiple of 4, since those were already filtered out in the previous step. Also, 0 is missing, but that's not a problem either, since 0 is also a multiple of 400.</p>

    <p>Let's try to understand the pattern. At first glance, it looks very simple: we have *14, *57, *71, and *00. However, from 4171 on, *71 drops out (did you notice?). We also have new patterns popping up later. Let's analyze this. The following Python program</p>
<pre><code>def test(y):
    B = 126976
    return ((y * 9175) &amp; B) == B

active = set()
for y in range(120000):
    r = y % 100
    if test(y):
        if r not in active:
            print(f'{y:6}: started *{r:02}')
            active.add(r)
    else:
        if r in active:
            print(f'{y:6}: stopped *{r:02}')
            active.remove(r)
</code></pre><p>
outputs
</p><pre><code>    14: started *14
    57: started *57
    71: started *71
   100: started *00
  4171: stopped *71
 32843: started *43
 36914: stopped *14
 65586: started *86
 69657: stopped *57
 98329: started *29
102500: stopped *00
</code></pre>

    <p>So, from 102500 on, we no longer catch multiples of 100, which explains why 102499 is the last number for which <code>is_leap_year_fast</code> returns the correct result. We also see that below that, no number is a multiple of 4 except for the multiples of 100 (conveniently, we can check that knowing only the last two decimal digits). This concludes the proof of condition (2), if we trust this brute-force enumeration; but let's continue and understand better why we get exactly these numbers.</p>

    <p>Let's look into why we're getting the multiples of 100 first. The factor 9175 is close to a multiple of 1/100 in 17-bit fixed point representation:</p>
    <p><span>2<sup>17</sup> ⋅ 7/100 = 9175.04 (exactly).</span>
    </p>

    <p>Multiplying a multiple of 100 by 9175.04 gives an integer (a multiple of 7) at bits 17 and above and 17 zero bits below that. E.g.</p>
    <p><span>9175.04 ⋅ 500 = 10001100000000000000000<sub>2</sub>, with 100011<sub>2</sub> = 35 = 5 ⋅ 7.</span>
    </p>

    <p>Multiplying a multiple of 100 by 9175 gives slightly less:</p>
    <p><span>9175 ⋅ 500 = 10001100000000000000000<sub>2</sub> − 500 ⋅ 0.04 = 10001011111111111101100<sub>2</sub>.</span>
    </p>

    <p>In general, subtracting a little bit from a number ending in a lot of zeroes creates a number that ends in a lot of ones, except at the very end. Here, we check the 5 bits in <i>B</i>. For <i>y</i> a multiple of 100, these are guaranteed be all 1 until the accumulated error reaches the lower end of <i>B</i>, which happens only after <i>y</i> = 2<sup>12</sup> / 0.04 = 102400, so this fits.</p>

    <p>Now where do the other numbers like 14, 57, and 71 come from? Let's look at it from a different angle. We have 9175 = 2<sup>17</sup> ⋅ 0.06999969482421875 (exactly) and <i>B</i> = 2<sup>17</sup> ⋅ 0.96875, so
    </p><p><span><i>p</i> &amp; <i>B</i> </span>             <span>= <i>B</i></span>
      <span>⇔ {<i>y</i> ⋅ 0.06999969482421875} </span>  <span>≥ 0.96875, where {<i>x</i>} is the fractional part of <i>x</i></span>
      <span>⇔ 6.999969482421875<i>y</i> mod 100 </span> <span>≥ 96.875</span>
    </p>

    <p>This is another way to see why multiples of 100 are accepted: For them, 7<i>y</i> mod 100 is 0, so 6.999969482421875<i>y</i> mod 100 comes out slightly below 100, and drops below 96.875 only after <i>y</i> = (100 − 96.875) / (7 − 6.999969482421875) = 102400.

    </p><p>To understand the other numbers showing up in our sequence, let's first consider what the solutions would be if we had a clean 7 in this inequality:</p>
    <p><span>7y mod 100 </span> <span>≥ 96.875</span>
      <span>⇔ 7y mod 100 </span> <span>∈ {97, 98, 99}.</span>
    </p>

    <p>To find the solutions to this, we first need the modular inverse of 7 modulo 100, that is, the number <i>x</i> such that 7<i>x</i> mod 100 = 1. We can calculate it by using the extended Euclidean algorithm, or just using <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=modular+inverse+of+7+modulo+100">some online calculator</a>, which tells us the result is 43. Then the solutions are 43 ⋅ 97 (mod 100), 43 ⋅ 98 (mod 100), and 43 ⋅ 99 (mod 100), which is 71, 14, and 57 (mod 100), respectively. This explains why we're initially seeing numbers of the form *14, *57, and *71. It also explains why we stop seeing e.g. *71 after 4071: While 7 ⋅ 4171 = 29197, we have 6.999969482421875 ⋅ 4171 = 29196.872711181640625, which (modulo 100) is less than 96.875. Similarly, 32843 pops up because the accumulated error (7 − 6.999969482421875) ⋅ 32843 = 1.002288818359375 exceeds one. With a bit more effort here, we could manually reproduce the output of the Python program above and check that none of these numbers is a multiple of 4.</p>

    <h2>Extension to other bitwidths</h2>

    <p>Now that we understand how the trick works, we can try to find parameters for other bitwidths. The variable parts are the location of block <i>B</i> and the fraction of 100 in <i>f</i> &amp; <i>D</i>.</p>

    <pre><code>uint64_t score(uint64_t f, uint64_t m, uint64_t t) {
      for (uint64_t y = 0; ; y++)
          if ((((y * f) &amp; m) &lt;= t) != is_leap_year(y))
              return y;
  }
  
  int main() {
      uint64_t best_score = 0;
      for (int k = 0; k &lt; BITS; k++) {
          for (int k2 = 0; k2 &lt; k; k2++) {
              uint64_t t = (1ULL &lt;&lt; k) - (1ULL &lt;&lt; k2);
              uint64_t m = (0b11ULL &lt;&lt; (BITS - 2)) | t | 0b1111;
              for (int n = 0; n &lt; 100; n++) {
                  uint64_t f = (0b01ULL &lt;&lt; (BITS - 2)) | (((1ULL &lt;&lt; k) * n) / 100);
                  uint64_t new_score = score(f, m, t);
                  if (new_score &gt; best_score) {
                      printf("%llu %llu %llu: %llu (%d %d %d)\n",
                             f, m, t, new_score, k, k - k2, n);
                      best_score = new_score;
                  }
              }
          }
      }
      return 0;
  }
  </code></pre>

    <p>For <code>BITS = 64</code>, in about 7 minutes we find <i>f</i> = 4611686019114582671, <i>m</i> = 13835058121854156815, <i>t</i> = 66571993088, which is correct up to <i>y</i> = 5965232499. This is nice because 5965232499 &gt; 2<sup>32</sup>, so any 32-bit year can be tested correctly with this variant.</p>

    <p>Is this the highest we can go with 64 bit? Perhaps there's some other constants that work even better? I couldn't immediately find a way to prove it, so I employed the tried-and-true method of getting someone else to do it for me by <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/q/275505/116815">posting it to the Code Golf StackExchange</a>. Indeed after only 1h user ovs posted a very good result, and two days later user Exalted Toast posted a <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/a/275541">proof</a> that 5965232499 is indeed the best possible range for 64 bits, also employing the z3 solver.</p>

    <h2>Benchmark</h2>

    <p>Getting meaningful benchmarks is tricky, since the function takes just such a tiny amount of time, and moreover for the branching versions execution time depends on the patterns of the input. Let's try two extreme cases: always the year 2025, and completely random years. These are the results of the <a href="https://hueffner.de/falk/blog/benchmark.cc">benchmark</a> on an i7-8700K (Coffee Lake, 4.7 GHz), compiled wirh <code>g++ -O3 -fno-tree-vectorize</code>:</p>

    <table>
      <thead>
          <tr>
              <th></th>
              <th>2025 (ns)</th>
              <th>random (ns)</th>
          </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td><code>is_leap_year</code></td>
              <td>0.65</td>
              <td>2.61</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><code>is_leap_year2</code></td>
              <td>0.65</td>
              <td>2.75</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><code>is_leap_year3</code></td>
              <td>0.67</td>
              <td>0.88</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><code>is_leap_year_fast</code></td>
              <td>0.69</td>
              <td>0.69</td>
          </tr>
       </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>Some weird things stand out here:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><code>is_leap_year2</code> is actually marginally slower than <code>is_leap_year</code> in the random case. This is surprising because <code>y % 100</code> needs one instruction more than the trick in <code>is_leap_year2</code>.</li>
    <li><code>is_leap_year3</code> is a bit slower for random data than for the fixed value. This is surprising because it doesn't do any branching.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I have no explanation for this other than benchmarking is hard.</p>

    <p>The new function <code>is_leap_year_fast</code> is 3.8 times faster than the standard implementation for random data, and about 6% slower for the perfectly predictable input. Overall, that seems pretty solid.</p>


    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>So, is this really worthwhile? Should we replace e.g. the <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/5cdd49b3f4cbdcf0472a65fd0c723912c3d48211/Modules/_datetimemodule.c#L416">CPython datetime implementation</a> with this trick? Well, it depends. Most years being queried in practice will be the current year, or at least fairly predictable, in which case we don't have a great advantage. To fully justify a change, ideally we would have a benchmark with realistic data that employs a leap year check as a subroutine, rather than just microbenchmarking. I would be happy to hear about any such results!</p>

        <p><span itemprop="articleBody"><p>C++ pop quiz time: what are the values of <code>a.a</code> and <code>b.b</code> on the last line in <code>main</code> of this program?</p>

<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The answer is that <code>a.a</code> is <code>0</code> and <code>b.b</code> is indeterminate, so reading it is undefined behaviour. Why? Because initialization in C++ is bonkers.</p>

<hr>

<h4 id="default--value--and-zero-initialization">Default-, value-, and zero-initialization</h4>

<p>Before we get into the details which cause this, I’ll introduce the concepts of default-, value- and zero-initialization. Feel free to skip this section if you’re already familiar with these.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>T</span> <span>global</span><span>;</span>       <span>//zero-initialization, then default-initialization</span>

<span>void</span> <span>foo</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>

    <span>new</span> <span>T</span><span>();</span>     <span>//value-initialization</span>
    <span>new</span> <span>T</span><span>{};</span>     <span>//value-initialization (C++11)</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>struct</span> <span>A</span> <span>{</span> <span>T</span> <span>t</span><span>;</span> <span>A</span><span>()</span> <span>:</span> <span>t</span><span>()</span> <span>{}</span> <span>};</span> <span>//t is value-initialized</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>B</span> <span>{</span> <span>T</span> <span>t</span><span>;</span> <span>B</span><span>()</span> <span>:</span> <span>t</span><span>{}</span> <span>{}</span> <span>};</span> <span>//t is value-initialized (C++11)</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>C</span> <span>{</span> <span>T</span> <span>t</span><span>;</span> <span>C</span><span>()</span>       <span>{}</span> <span>};</span> <span>//t is default-initialized</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The rules for these different initialization forms are fairly complex, so I’ll give a simplified outline of the C++11 rules (C++14 even changed some of them, so those value-initialization forms can be aggregate initialization). If you want to understand all the details of these forms, check out the relevant cppreference.com articles<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup><sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup><sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>, or see the standards quotes at the bottom of the article.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>default-initialization</strong> – If <code>T</code> is a class, the default constructor is called; if it’s an array, each element is default-initialized; otherwise, no initialization is done, resulting in indeterminate values.</li>
  <li><strong>value-initialization</strong> – If <code>T</code> is a class, the object is default-initialized (after being zero-initialized if <code>T</code>’s default constructor is not user-provided/deleted); if it’s an array, each element is value-initialized; otherwise, the object is zero-initialized.</li>
  <li><strong>zero-initialization</strong> – Applied to static and thread-local variables before any other initialization. If <code>T</code> is scalar (arithmetic, pointer, enum), it is initialized from <code>0</code>; if it’s a class type, all base classes and data members are zero-initialized; if it’s an array, each element is zero-initialized.</li>
</ul>

<p>Taking the simple example of <code>int</code> as <code>T</code>, <code>global</code> and all of the value-initialized variables will have the value <code>0</code>, and all other variables will have an indeterminate value. Reading these indeterminate values results in undefined behaviour.</p>

<hr>

<h4 id="back-to-our-original-example">Back to our original example</h4>

<p>Now we have the necessary knowledge to understand what’s going on in my original example. Essentially, the behaviours of <code>foo</code> and <code>bar</code> are changed by the different location of <code>=default</code> on their constructors. Again, the relevant standards passages are down at the bottom of the page if you want them, but the jist is this:</p>

<p>Since the constructor for <code>foo</code> is defaulted on its first declaration, it is not technically <em>user-provided</em> – I’ll explain what this term means shortly, just accept this standardese for now. The constructor for <code>bar</code>, conversely, is only defaulted at its definition, so it <em>is</em> user-provided. Put another way, if you don’t want your constructor to be user-provided, be sure to write <code>=default</code> when you declare it rather than define it like that elsewhere. This rule makes sense when you think about it: without having access to the definition of a constructor, a translation unit can’t know if it is going to be a simple compiler-generated one, or if it’s going to send a telegram to the Moon to retrieve some data and block until it gets a response.</p>

<p>The default constructor being user-provided has a few consequences for the class type. For example, you can’t default-initialize a const-qualified object if it lacks a user-provided constructor, the notion being that if the object should only be set once, it better be initialised with something reasonable:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>const</span> <span>int</span> <span>my_int</span><span>;</span>            <span>//ill-formed, no user-provided constructor</span>
<span>const</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>string</span> <span>my_string</span><span>;</span> <span>//well-formed, has a user-provided constructor</span>

<span>const</span> <span>foo</span> <span>my_foo</span><span>;</span> <span>//ill-formed, no user-provided constructor</span>
<span>const</span> <span>bar</span> <span>my_bar</span><span>;</span> <span>//well-formed, has a user-provided constructor</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Additionally, in order to be <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/concept/TrivialType">trivial</a> (and therefore <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/concept/PODType">POD</a>) or an <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/aggregate_initialization">aggregate</a>, a class must have no user-provided constructors. Don’t worry if you don’t know those terms, it suffices to know that whether your constructors are user-provided or not modifies some of the restrictions of what you can do with that class and how it acts.</p>

<p>For our first example, however, we’re interested in how user-provided constructors interact with initialization rules. The language mandates that both <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are value-initialized, but only <code>a</code> is additionally zero-initialized. Zero-initialization for <code>a</code> gives <code>a.a</code> the value <code>0</code>, whereas <code>b.b</code> is not initialized at all, giving us undefined behaviour if we attempt to read it. This is a very subtle distinction which has inadvertently changed our program from executing safely to summoning nasal demons/eating your cat/ordering pizza/your favourite undefined behaviour metaphor.</p>

<p>Fortunately, there’s a simple solution. At the risk of repeating advice which has been given many times before, <strong>initialize your variables.</strong></p>

<p><b>Seriously.</b></p>

<p><b>Do it.</b></p>

<p><b>INITIALIZE YOUR GORRAM VARIABLES.</b></p>

<p>If the designer of <code>foo</code> and <code>bar</code> decides that they should be default constructible, they should initialize their contents with some sensible values. If they decide that they should <em>not</em> be default constructible, they should delete the constructors to avoid issues.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>struct</span> <span>foo</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>foo</span><span>()</span> <span>:</span> <span>a</span><span>{</span><span>0</span><span>}</span> <span>{}</span> <span>//initialize to 0 explicitly</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>a</span><span>;</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>struct</span> <span>bar</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>bar</span><span>()</span> <span>=</span> <span>delete</span><span>;</span> <span>//delete constructor</span>
    <span>//insert non-default constructor which does something sensible here</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>b</span><span>;</span>
<span>};</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Internalising this way of thinking about initialization is key to writing unsurprising code. If you’ve profiled your code and found a bottleneck caused by unnecessary initialization, then sure, optimise it, but you best be certain that the extra performance is worth the possible headaches and money spent to keep the code safe.</p>

<p>If you still aren’t convinced that C++ initialization rules are crazy-complex, take a minute to think of all the forms of initialization you can think of. My answers after the line.</p>

<hr>

<p>Done? How many did you come up with? In perusal of the standard, I counted <em>eighteen</em> different forms of initialization<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>. Here they are with a short example/description:</p>

<ul>
  <li>default: <code>int i;</code></li>
  <li>value: <code>int i{};</code></li>
  <li>zero: <code>static int i;</code></li>
  <li>constant: <code>static int i = some_constexpr_function();</code></li>
  <li>static: zero- or constant-initialization</li>
  <li>dynamic: not static initialization</li>
  <li>unordered: dynamic initialization of class template static data members which are not explicitly specialized</li>
  <li>ordered: dynamic initialization of other non-local variables with static storage duration</li>
  <li>non-trivial: when a class or aggregate is initialized by a non-trivial constructor</li>
  <li>direct: <code>int i{42}; int j(42);</code></li>
  <li>copy: <code>int i = 42;</code></li>
  <li>copy-list: <code>int i = {42};</code></li>
  <li>direct-list: <code>int i{42};</code></li>
  <li>list: either copy-list or direct-list</li>
  <li>aggregate: <code>int is[3] = {0,1,2};</code></li>
  <li>reference: <code>const int&amp; i = 42; auto&amp;&amp; j = 42;</code></li>
  <li>implicit: default or value</li>
  <li>explicit: direct, copy, or list</li>
</ul>

<p>Don’t try to memorise all of these rules; therein lies madness. Just be careful, and keep in mind that C++’s initialization rules are there to pounce on you when you least expect it. Explicitly initialize your variables, and if you ever fall in to the trap of thinking C++ is a sane language, remember this:</p>

<p><strong>In C++, you can give your program undefined behaviour by changing the point at which you tell the compiler to generate something it was probably going to generate for you anyway.</strong></p>

deleted on its first declaration.</strong> A user-provided explicitly-defaulted function (i.e., explicitly defaulted after its first declaration) is defined at the point where it is explicitly defaulted; if such a function is implicitly defined
