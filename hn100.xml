<p>OK, I said there would never be a version three of htmx.</p>
<p>But, <em>technically</em>, I never said anything about a version <em>four</em>…</p>
<h2 id="htmx-4-the-fetch-ening"><a href="#htmx-4-the-fetch-ening" aria-label="Anchor link for: htmx-4-the-fetch-ening">htmx 4: The fetch()ening</a></h2>
<p>In <a href="https://htmx.org/essays/hypermedia-driven-applications/">The Future of htmx</a> I said the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are going to work to ensure that htmx is extremely stable in both API &amp; implementation. This means accepting and
documenting the <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://htmx.org/quirks/">quirks</a> of the current implementation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Earlier this year, on a whim, I created <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/bigskysoftware/fixi">fixi.js</a>, a hyperminimalist implementation
of the ideas in htmx.  That work gave me a chance to get a lot more familiar  with the <code>fetch()</code> and, especially, the
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function">async</a> infrastructure
available in JavaScript.</p>
<p>In doing that work I began to wonder if that, while the htmx <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://htmx.org/reference/#attributes">API</a>
is (at least reasonably) correct, maybe there was room for a more dramatic change of the implementation that took
advantage of these features in order to simplify the library.</p>
<p>Further, changing from ye olde <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest"><code>XMLHttpRequest</code></a>
(a legacy of htmx 1.0 IE support) to <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/fetch"><code>fetch()</code></a> would
be a pretty violent change, guaranteed to break at least <em>some</em> stuff.</p>
<p>So I began thinking: if we are going to consider moving to fetch, then maybe we should <em>also</em> use this update as a
chance address at least <em>some</em> of the <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://htmx.org/quirks/">quirks &amp; cruft</a> that htmx has acquired over its lifetime.</p>
<p>So, eventually &amp; reluctantly, I have changed my mind: there <em>will</em> be another major version of htmx.</p>
<p>However, in order to keep my word that there will not be a htmx 3.0, the next release will instead be htmx 4.0.</p>
<h2 id="project-goals"><a href="#project-goals" aria-label="Anchor link for: project-goals">Project Goals</a></h2>
<p>With htmx 4.0 we are rebuilding the internals of htmx, based on the lessons learned from
fixi.js and <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/htmx.org/v/0.0.1">five+ years</a> of supporting htmx.</p>
<p>There are three major simplifying changes:</p>
<h3 id="the-fetch-ening"><a href="#the-fetch-ening" aria-label="Anchor link for: the-fetch-ening">The fetch()ening</a></h3>
<p>The biggest internal change is that <code>fetch()</code> will replace <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> as the core ajax infrastructure.  This
won’t actually have a huge effect on most usages of htmx <em>except</em> that the events model will necessarily change due
to the differences between <code>fetch()</code> and <code>XMLHttpRequest</code>.</p>
<h3 id="the-long-national-nightmare-of-implicit-attribute-inheritance-ends"><a href="#the-long-national-nightmare-of-implicit-attribute-inheritance-ends" aria-label="Anchor link for: the-long-national-nightmare-of-implicit-attribute-inheritance-ends">The Long National Nightmare of Implicit Attribute Inheritance Ends</a></h3>
<p>I feel that my biggest mistake in htmx 1.0 &amp; 2.0 was making attribute inheritance <em>implicit</em>.  I was inspired by CSS in
doing this, and the results have been roughly the same as CSS: powerful &amp; maddening.</p>
<p>In htmx 4.0, attribute inheritance will be <em>explicit</em> rather than <em>implicit</em>, via the <code>:inherited</code> modifier:</p>
<pre data-lang="html"><code data-lang="html"><span>  &lt;</span><span>div </span><span>hx-target:inherited</span><span>=</span><span>"#output"</span><span>&gt;
</span><span>    &lt;</span><span>button </span><span>hx-post</span><span>=</span><span>"/up"</span><span>&gt;Like&lt;/</span><span>button</span><span>&gt;
</span><span>    &lt;</span><span>button </span><span>hx-post</span><span>=</span><span>"/down"</span><span>&gt;Dislike&lt;/</span><span>button</span><span>&gt;
</span><span>  &lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;
</span><span>  &lt;</span><span>output </span><span>id</span><span>=</span><span>"output"</span><span>&gt;Pick a button...&lt;/</span><span>output</span><span>&gt;
</span></code></pre>
<p>Here the <code>hx-target</code> attribute is explicitly declared as <code>inherited</code> on the enclosing <code>div</code> and, if it wasn’t, the
<code>button</code> elements would not inherit the target from it.</p>
<p>This will be the most significant upgrade change to deal with for most htmx users.</p>
<h3 id="the-tyranny-of-locally-cached-history-ends"><a href="#the-tyranny-of-locally-cached-history-ends" aria-label="Anchor link for: the-tyranny-of-locally-cached-history-ends">The Tyranny Of Locally Cached History Ends</a></h3>
<p>Another constant source of pain for both us and for htmx users is history support.  htmx 2.0 stores history in local
cache to make navigation faster.  Unfortunately, snapshotting the DOM is often brittle because of third-party
modifications, hidden state, etc.  There is a terrible simplicity to the web 1.0 model of blowing everything away and
starting over.  There are also security concerns storing history information in session storage.</p>
<p>In htmx 2.0, we often end up recommending that people facing history-related issues simply disable the cache entirely,
and that usually fixes the problems.</p>
<p>In htmx 4.0, history support will no longer snapshot the DOM and keep it locally.  It will, rather, issue a network
request for the restored content.  This is the behavior of 2.0 on a history cache-miss, and it works reliably with
little effort on behalf of htmx users.</p>
<p>We will offer an extension that enables history caching like in htmx 2.0, but it will be opt-in, rather than the default.</p>
<p>This tremendously simplifies the htmx codebase and should make the out-of-the-box behavior much more plug-and-play.</p>
<h2 id="what-stays-the-same"><a href="#what-stays-the-same" aria-label="Anchor link for: what-stays-the-same">What Stays The Same?</a></h2>
<p>Most things.</p>
<p>The <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3648188.3675127">core</a> functionality of htmx will remain the same, <code>hx-get</code>, <code>hx-post</code>,
<code>hx-target</code>, <code>hx-boost</code>, <code>hx-swap</code>, <code>hx-trigger</code>, etc.</p>
<p>Except for adding an <code>:inherited</code> modifier on a few attributes, many htmx projects will “just work” with htmx 4.</p>
<p>These changes will make the long term maintenance &amp; sustainability of the project much stronger.  It will also take
pressure off the 2.0 releases, which can now focus on stability rather than contemplating new features.</p>
<h2 id="upgrading"><a href="#upgrading" aria-label="Anchor link for: upgrading">Upgrading</a></h2>
<p>That said, htmx 2.0 users <em>will</em> face an upgrade project when moving to 4.0 in a way that they did not have to in moving
from 1.0 to 2.0.</p>
<p>I am sorry about that, and want to offer three things to address it:</p>
<ul>
<li>htmx 2.0 (like htmx 1.0 &amp; intercooler.js 1.0) will be supported <em>in perpetuity</em>, so there is absolutely <em>no</em> pressure to
upgrade your application: if htmx 2.0 is satisfying your hypermedia needs, you can stick with it.</li>
<li>We will create extensions that revert htmx 4 to htmx 2 behaviors as much as is feasible (e.g. Supporting the old implicit
attribute inheritance model, at least)</li>
<li>We will roll htmx 4.0 out slowly, over a multi-year period.  As with the htmx 1.0 -&gt; 2.0 upgrade, there will be a long
period where htmx 2.x is <code>latest</code> and htmx 4.x is <code>next</code></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="new-features"><a href="#new-features" aria-label="Anchor link for: new-features">New Features</a></h2>
<p>Of course, it isn’t all bad.  Beyond simplifying the implementation of htmx significantly, switching to fetch also gives
us the opportunity to add some nice new features to htmx</p>
<h3 id="streaming-responses-sse-in-core"><a href="#streaming-responses-sse-in-core" aria-label="Anchor link for: streaming-responses-sse-in-core">Streaming Responses &amp; SSE in Core</a></h3>
<p>By switching to <code>fetch()</code>, we can take advantage of its support for
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Streams_API/Using_readable_streams">readable streams</a>, which
allow for a stream of content to be swapped into the DOM, rather than a single response.</p>
<p>htmx 1.0 had Server Sent Event support integrated into the library.  In htmx 2.0 we pulled this functionality out as an
extension.  It turns out that SSE is just a specialized version of a streaming response, so in adding streaming
support, it’s an almost-free free two-fer to add that back into core as well.</p>
<p>This will make incremental response swapping much cleaner and well-supported in htmx.</p>
<h3 id="morphing-swap-in-core"><a href="#morphing-swap-in-core" aria-label="Anchor link for: morphing-swap-in-core">Morphing Swap in Core</a></h3>
<p><a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/bigskysoftware/idiomorph/commit/7760e89d9f198b43aa7d39cc4f940f606771f47b">Three years ago</a> I had
an idea for a DOM morphing algorithm that improved on the initial algorithm pioneered by <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/patrick-steele-idem/morphdom">morphdom</a>.</p>
<p>The idea was to use “id sets” to make smarter decisions regarding which nodes to preserve and which nodes to delete when
merging changes into the DOM, and I called this idea “idiomorph”.  Idiomorph has gone on to be adopted by many other
web project such as <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://hotwired.dev/">Hotwire</a>.</p>
<p>We strongly considered including it in htmx 2.0, but I decided not too because it worked well as an extension and
htmx 2.0 had already grown larger than I wanted.</p>
<p>In 4.0, with the complexity savings we achieved by moving to <code>fetch()</code>, we can now comfortably fit a <code>morphInner</code> and
<code>morphOuter</code> swap into core, thanks to the excellent work of Michael West.</p>
<h3 id="explicit-partial-tag-support"><a href="#explicit-partial-tag-support" aria-label="Anchor link for: explicit-partial-tag-support">Explicit &lt;partial&gt; Tag Support</a></h3>
<p>htmx has, since very early on, supported a concept of “Out-of-band” swaps: content that is removed from the main HTML
response and swapped into the DOM elsewhere.  I have always been a bit ambivalent about them, because they move away
from <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://htmx.org/essays/locality-of-behaviour/">Locality of Behavior</a>, but there is no doubt that they are useful
and often crucial for achieving certain UI patterns.</p>
<p>Out-of-band swaps started off very simply: if you marked an element as <code>hx-swap-oob='true'</code>, htmx would swap the element
as the outer HTML of any existing element already in the DOM with that id.  Easy-peasy.</p>
<p>However, over time, people started asking for different functionality around Out-of-band swaps: prepending, appending,
etc. and the feature began acquiring some fairly baroque syntax to handle all these needs.</p>
<p>We have come to the conclusion that the problem is that there are really <em>two</em> use cases, both currently trying to be
filled by Out-of-band swaps:</p>
<ul>
<li>A simple, id-based replacement</li>
<li>A more elaborate swap of partial content</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, we are introducing the notion of <code>&lt;partial&gt;</code>s in htmx 4.0</p>
<p>A partial element is, under the covers, a template element and, thus, can contain any sort of content you like.  It
specifies on itself all the standard htmx options regarding swapping, <code>hx-target</code> and <code>hx-swap</code> in particular, allowing
you full access to all the standard swapping behavior of htmx without using a specialized syntax.  This tremendously
simplifies the mental model for these sorts of needs, and dovetails well with the streaming support we intend to offer.</p>
<p>Out-of-band swaps will be retained in htmx 4.0, but will go back to their initial, simple focus of simply replacing
an existing element by id.</p>
<h3 id="improved-view-transitions-support"><a href="#improved-view-transitions-support" aria-label="Anchor link for: improved-view-transitions-support">Improved View Transitions Support</a></h3>
<p>htmx 2.0 has had <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transition_API">View Transition</a> support since
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/bigskysoftware/htmx/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#190---2023-04-11">April of 2023</a>.  In the interceding
two years, support for the feature has grown across browsers (c’mon, safari, you can do it) and we’ve gained experience
with the feature.</p>
<p>One thing that has become apparent to us while using them is that, to use them in a stable manner, it is important
to establish a <em>queue</em> of transitions, so each can complete before the other begins.  If you don’t do this, you can get
visually ugly transition cancellations.</p>
<p>So, in htmx 4.0 we have added this queue which will ensure that all view transitions complete smoothly.</p>
<p>CSS transitions will continue to work as before as well, although the swapping model is again made much simpler by the
async runtime.</p>
<p>We may enable View Transitions by default, the jury is still out on that.</p>
<h3 id="stabilized-event-ordering"><a href="#stabilized-event-ordering" aria-label="Anchor link for: stabilized-event-ordering">Stabilized Event Ordering</a></h3>
<p>A wonderful thing about <code>fetch()</code> and the async support in general is that it is <em>much</em> easier to guarantee a stable
order of events.  By linearizing asynchronous code and allowing us to use standard language features like try/catch,
the event model of htmx should be much more predictable and comprehensible.</p>
<p>We are going to adopt a new standard for event naming to make things even clearer:</p>
<p><code>htmx:&lt;phase&gt;:&lt;system&gt;[:&lt;optional-sub-action&gt;]</code></p>
<p>So, for example, <code>htmx:before:request</code> will be triggered before a request is made.</p>
<h3 id="improved-extension-support"><a href="#improved-extension-support" aria-label="Anchor link for: improved-extension-support">Improved Extension Support</a></h3>
<p>Another opportunity we have is to take advantage of the <code>async</code> behavior of <code>fetch()</code> for much better performance in our
preload extension (where we issue a speculative (<code>GET</code> only!) request in anticipation of an actual trigger).  We have
also added an optimistic update extension to the core extensions, again made easy by the new async features.</p>
<p>In general, we have opened up the internals of the htmx request/response/swap cycle much more fully to extension developers,
up to and including allowing them to replace the <code>fetch()</code> implementation used by htmx for a particular request.  There
should not be a need for any hacks to get the behavior you want out of htmx now: the events and the open “context” object
should provide the ability to do almost anything.</p>
<h3 id="improved-hx-on-support"><a href="#improved-hx-on-support" aria-label="Anchor link for: improved-hx-on-support">Improved <code>hx-on</code> Support</a></h3>
<p>In htmx 2.0, I somewhat reluctantly added the <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-on/"><code>hx-on</code></a> attributes to support light
scripting inline on elements.  I added this because HTML does not allow you to listen for arbitrary events via <code>on</code>
attributes: only standard DOM events like <code>onclick</code> can be responded to.</p>
<p>We hemmed and hawed about the syntax and so, unfortunately, there are a few different ways to do it.</p>
<p>In htmx 4.0 we will adopt a single standard for the <code>hx-on</code> attributes: <code>hx-on:&lt;event name&gt;</code>.  Additionally, we are
working to improve the htmx JavaScript API (especially around async operation support) and will make those features
available in <code>hx-on</code>:</p>
<pre data-lang="html"><code data-lang="html"><span>&lt;</span><span>button </span><span>hx-post</span><span>=</span><span>"/like"
</span><span>        </span><span>hx-on:htmx:after:swap</span><span>=</span><span>"await timeout('3s'); ctx.newContent[0].remove()"</span><span>&gt;
</span><span>    Get A Response Then Remove It 3 Seconds Later
</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>button</span><span>&gt;
</span></code></pre>
<p>htmx will never support a fully featured scripting mechanism in core, we recommend something like
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://alpinejs.dev/">Alpine.js</a> for that, but our hope is that we can provide a relatively minimalist API that
allows for easy, light async scripting of the DOM.</p>
<p>I should note that htmx 4.0 will continue to work with <code>eval()</code> disabled, but you will need to forego a few features like
<code>hx-on</code> if you choose to do so.</p>
<h3 id="a-better-but-familiar-htmx"><a href="#a-better-but-familiar-htmx" aria-label="Anchor link for: a-better-but-familiar-htmx">A Better But Familiar htmx</a></h3>
<p>All in all, our hope is that htmx 4.0 will feel an awful lot like 2.0, but with better features and, we hope, with fewer bugs.</p>
<h2 id="timeline"><a href="#timeline" aria-label="Anchor link for: timeline">Timeline</a></h2>
<p>As always, software takes as long as it takes.</p>
<p>However, our current planned timeline is:</p>
<ul>
<li>An alpha release is available <em>today</em>:  <code>htmx@4.0.0-alpha1</code></li>
<li>A 4.0.0 release should be available in early-to-mid 2026</li>
<li>4.0 will be marked <code>latest</code> in early-2027ish</li>
</ul>
<p>You can track our progress (and see quite a bit of dust flying around) in the <code>four</code> branch on
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/bigskysoftware/htmx/tree/four">github</a> and at:</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
              <p>Dear PEP 810 authors.  The Steering Council is happy to unanimously<sup><a href="#footnote-276293-1" id="footnote-ref-276293-1">[1]</a></sup> accept “PEP 810, Explicit lazy imports”.  Congratulations!  We appreciate the way you were able to build on and improve the previously discussed (and rejected) attempt at lazy imports as proposed in PEP 690.</p>
<p>We have recommendations about some of the PEP’s details, a few suggestions for filling a couple of small gaps, and we have made decisions on the alternatives that you’ve left to the SC, all of which I’ll outline below.  If you have any questions, please do reach out to the SC for clarification, either here, on the SC tracker, or in office hours.</p>
<p>Use <code>lazy</code> as the keyword.  We debated many of the given alternatives (and some we came up with ourselves), and ultimately agreed with the PEP’s choice of the <code>lazy</code> keyword.  The closest challenger was <code>defer</code>, but once we tried to use that in all the places where the term is visible, we ultimately didn’t think it was as good an overall fit.  The same was true with all the other alternative keywords we could come up with, so… <strong><code>lazy</code> it is</strong>!</p>
<p>What about <code>from foo lazy import bar</code>?  <strong>Nope!</strong>  We like that in both module imports and <code>from</code>-imports that the <code>lazy</code> keyword is the first thing on the line.  It helps to visually recognize lazy imports of both varieties.</p>
<p>Leveraging a subclass of dict.  We don’t see a need for this complicated alternative; please add this to the rejected ideas.</p>
<p>Allowing <code>’*’</code> in <code>__lazy_modules__</code>.  We agree with the rationale for rejecting this idea; it can always be added later if needed.</p>
<p>One thing that the PEP does not mention is <code>.pth</code> files, which the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/site.html">site.py</a> module processes, and which has some special handling for lines that begin with the string <code>'import'</code> followed by a space or tab.  It doesn’t make much sense for <code>.pth</code> files to support lazy imports, so we suggest that the PEP explicitly says that this special handling in <code>.pth</code> files will not be adapted to handle lazy imports.</p>
<p>There currently is no way to get the active filter mode, so please add a <code>sys.get_lazy_imports()</code> function.  Also, do you think appending <code>_mode</code> to their names makes the purpose of these functions clearer?  We leave that up to the PEP authors.</p>
<p>The PEP should be explicit about the precedence order between the different ways to set the mode, i.e. <code>$PYTHON_LAZY_IMPORTS=&lt;mode&gt;</code>, <code>-X lazy_imports=&lt;mode&gt;</code>, and <code>sys.set_lazy_imports()</code>.  In all expectation, it will follow the same precedence order as other similar settings, but the PEP should be explicit.</p>
<p>We agree that the PEP should take no position on any style recommendations for sorting lazy imports.  While we generally like the idea of grouping lazy imports together, let’s leave that up to the linters and auto-formatters to decide the details.</p>
<p>That should just about cover it.  Again, thank you for your work on this, as it’s been a feature so many in the Python community have wanted for so long.  Given the earlier attempts and existing workarounds, we think this strikes exactly the right balance.</p>
<p>-Barry, on behalf of the Python Steering Council</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>November 3, 2025</p><article><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/skaldlabs/skald"><img src="https://blog.yakkomajuri.com/images/python-to-node-pr.png" alt="Python to Node migration"></a></p>
<p>We just did something crazy: we completely rewrote our backend from Python to Node just one week after our launch.</p>
<p>We did this so we can scale. Yes, scale. A week in.</p>
<p>In some ways, it's a good time right? The codebase is still small and we don't have too many users.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, it goes completely against the advice given to early-stage startups which is to just ship and sell, and worry about scale once you've hit product-market-fit. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://paulgraham.com/ds.html">"Do things that don't scale"</a>, as PG put it.</p>
<p>You see, we didn't have a magical launch week that flooded us with users and force us to scale. And generally you can expect that any stack you pick should be able to scale reasonably well for a long time until you actually get to the point where you should consider changing frameworks or rewriting your backend in a different language (read: Rust).</p>
<p>So why do it?</p>
<h2 id="python-async-sucks"><a href="#python-async-sucks"></a>Python async sucks</h2>
<p>I'm a big fan of Django. I was introduced to it at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://posthog.com/">PostHog</a> and it's become my go-to backend for most projects since. It gets you off the ground really fast, has great tooling and abstractions, and is still flexible enough to tweak to your needs.</p>
<p>So naturally, when I started writing our backend at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/skaldlabs/skald">Skald</a>, I started us off with Django too.</p>
<p>Now, we make a lot of calls to LLM and embedding APIs at Skald, so we're generally doing a lot of network I/O that we'd like to be async. Not only that, we often want to fire a lot of requests concurrently, such as when need to generate vector embeddings for the various chunks of a document.</p>
<p>And things quickly got really messy in Django.</p>
<p>I'll preface this by saying that neither of us has a lot of experience writing Python async code (I've mostly <a href="https://blog.yakkomajuri.com/blog/thread-pool">worked on</a> async-heavy services in Node) but I think this is partly the point here: <strong>it's really hard and unintuitive to write solid and performant Python async code</strong>. You need to go deep into the foundations of everything in order to be able to do so.</p>
<p>I'm actually really interested in spending proper time in becoming more knowledgeable with Python async, but in our context you a) lose precious time that you need to use to ship as an early-stage startup and b) can shoot yourself in the foot very easily in the process.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I thought I was to blame. "Bad programmer! Bad programmer!" was what I was hearing in my head as I tried to grasp everything. But while more knowledgeable folks would certainly have a better time, we discovered that the foundations of Python async are actually a bit shaky too.</p>
<p>Unlike JavaScript, which had the event loop from the beginning, and Go, that created the concept of goroutines (both concurrency models that I quite like and have used in production), Python async support was patched on later, and that's where the difficulty lies.</p>
<p>Two blog posts that cover this really well are <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://tonybaloney.github.io/posts/why-isnt-python-async-more-popular.html">"Python has had async for 10 years -- why isn't it more popular?"</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://harshal.sheth.io/2025/09/12/python-async.html">"Python concurrency: gevent had it right"</a>, both conveniently published not long before I started digging into all this.</p>
<p>As for us, we learned a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Python doesn't have native async file I/O.</li>
<li>Django still doesn't have full async support. Async in the ORM is not done yet and the colored functions problem really shines here. You can technically use Django with async, but their <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/topics/async/">docs on this</a> have so many caveats that it should scare anyone.</li>
<li>You gotta write <code><span><span>sync_to_async</span></span></code> and <code><span><span>async_to_sync</span></span></code> <strong>everywhere</strong>.</li>
<li>All sorts of models have emerged to bring better async support to different parts of the Python ecosystem, but as they're not native they have their own caveats. For instance, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://pypi.org/project/aiofiles/">aiofiles</a> brings async API-compatible file operations but uses a thread pool under the hood, and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.gevent.org/">Gevent</a> with its greenlets is pretty cool but it literally patches the stdlib in order to work.</li>
<li>Due to a lot of async support in Python relying on layers that sit on top of the language rather than being native, you need to be careful about the async code you write as it will have different implications depending on e.g. the Gunicorn worker type you run (good luck learning much about those from the Gunicorn docs, btw).</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, just getting an equivalent of <code><span><span>Promise</span><span>.</span><span>all</span></span></code> to work, while understanding all of its gotchas was not simple at all.</p>
<p>Faced with this, I went into the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/posthog/posthog">PostHog codebase</a>.</p>
<p>I worked at PostHog for three years and we had no async in the Django codebase back then but they're a massive company and they have AI features now so they must have figured this out!</p>
<p>And what I realized was that they're still running WSGI (not ASGI) with Gunicorn Gthread workers (where the max concurrent requests you're able to handle is usually max 4x CPU cores), thus not getting much benefit from running things async. The codebase also has a lot of utils to make async work properly, like their own implementation of <code><span><span>async_to_sync</span></span></code>. So I guess way they're handling a lot of load is probably just horizontal scaling.</p>
<p>There's simply no great way to run async in Django.</p>
<h2 id="ok-now-what"><a href="#ok-now-what"></a>Ok, now what?</h2>
<p>We essentially concluded that Django was going to hurt us really soon, not just when we started to have a lot of load.</p>
<p>Without too many users we'd already need to start running multiple machines in order to not have terrible latency, plus we'd be writing clunky code that would be hard to maintain.</p>
<p>We could of course just "do things that don't scale" for now and just solve the problem with money (or AWS credits), but it didn't feel right. And being so early would make the migration to another framework much easier.</p>
<p>At this point, some people are probably screaming at their screens going: "just use FastAPI!" -- and we did indeed consider it.</p>
<p>FastAPI does have proper async support and is quite a loved framework said to be performant. And if you want an ORM with it you could use SQLAlchemy which also supports async.</p>
<p>Migrating to FastAPI would have probably saved us a day or two (our migration took 3 days) due to being able to reuse a lot of code without translating it, but at this point we weren't feeling great about the Python async ecosystem overall, and we had actually already written our background worker service in Node, so we thought it would be a good opportunity to go all-in on one ecosystem.</p>
<p>And so migrate to Node we did. We took a little time picking the framework + ORM combo but settled on Express + MikroORM.</p>
<p>Yeah sure Express is old but it's battle-tested and feels familiar. Coming over to the JS event loop was the main point of all this anyway.</p>
<h2 id="what-we-gained-what-we-lost"><a href="#what-we-gained-what-we-lost"></a>What we gained, what we lost</h2>
<h3 id="gained-efficiency"><a href="#gained-efficiency"></a>Gained: Efficiency</h3>
<p>Our initial benchmarks show we've gained ~3x throughput out of the box and that's just with us running what is mostly sequential code in an async context. Being over on Node now, we're planning on doing a lot concurrent processing when chunking, embedding, reranking, and so on. This means this change should have an even greater payoff over time.</p>
<h3 id="lost-django"><a href="#lost-django"></a>Lost: Django</h3>
<p>Losing Django hurts, and we've already found ourselves building a lot more middleware and utilities ourselves on the Express side. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://adonisjs.com/">Adonis</a> exists, which is a more fully-featured Node framework, but moving to a whole new ecosystem felt like more work to us than just using something minimal.</p>
<p>What I'm missing the most is the ORM, which in my opinion is really ergonomic. And while you always have to be careful with ORMs when looking to extract the best possible performance, the Django ORM does do some nice things under the hood in order to make it performant enough to write queries in Python, and I learned a bit more about this when migrating our Django models over to MikroORM entities.</p>
<h3 id="gained-mikroorm"><a href="#gained-mikroorm"></a>Gained: MikroORM</h3>
<p>MikroORM was a consolation prize in this whole migration. I still much prefer the Django ORM but at the same time different ecosystems call for different tooling.</p>
<p>I'd never used it before and was positively surprised to find Django-like lazy loading, a migrations setup that felt much better than Prisma's, as well as a reasonably ergonomic API (once you manually set up the foundations right).</p>
<p>Overall, we're early into this change, but currently happy to have picked MikroORM over the incumbent Prisma.</p>
<h3 id="lost-the-python-ecosystem"><a href="#lost-the-python-ecosystem"></a>Lost: The Python ecosystem</h3>
<p>I think this is pretty self-explanatory. While most tools for building RAGs and agents have Python and TypeScript SDKs, Python still takes priority, and we're just talking about API wrappers here.</p>
<p>Once you want to actually get into ML stuff yourself, there's just no competition. I suspect that as we get more sophisticated we'll end up having a Python service, but for now we're ok.</p>
<h3 id="gained-unified-codebase"><a href="#gained-unified-codebase"></a>Gained: Unified codebase</h3>
<p>We'd always realized that migrating to Node would mean we'd have two Node services instead of a Python one and a Node one, but it didn't occur to us until a day in that we could actually merge the codebases and that that would be extremely helpful.</p>
<p>There was a lot of duplicate logic across the Node worker and the Django server, and now we've unified the Express server and background worker into one codebase, which feels so much better. They can both use the ORM now (previously the worker was running raw SQL) and share a bunch of utils.</p>
<h3 id="gained-much-better-testing"><a href="#gained-much-better-testing"></a>Gained: Much better testing</h3>
<p>This is not a <code><span><span>pytest</span></span></code> vs <code><span><span>jest</span></span></code> thing, it's just that in order to make sure everything was working as expected after migrating, we just wrote a ton more tests. This and some refactoring were welcome side benefits.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-did-it"><a href="#how-we-did-it"></a>How we did it</h2>
<p>I think it's about time to wrap this post up, but here are some quick notes about the actual migration process.</p>
<ul>
<li>It took us three days.</li>
<li>We barely used AI code generation at all until the final bits -- it felt important to us to understand the foundations of our new setup really well, particularly the inner workings of the new ORM. Once we had the foundations of everything down Claude Code was quite helpful in generating code for some less important endpoints, and also helped us in scanning the codebase for issues.</li>
<li>We almost quit multiple times. We were getting customer requests for new features and had some bugs in the Django code and it felt like we were wasting time migrating instead of serving customers.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="would-we-do-it-again"><a href="#would-we-do-it-again"></a>Would we do it again?</h2>
<p>Honestly, we're quite happy with our decision and would 100% do it again. Not only will this pay off in the long term but it's already paying off today.</p>
<p>We learned a lot of stuff in the process too, and if the whole point of this whole post is that someone comes to tell me that we're dumb and we should just have done X or Y, or comes to teach me about how Python async works, then that will honestly be great. For my part, I gladly recognize my inexperience with Python async and if I can learn more about it, that's a win.</p>

We have hundreds of customers using our data products including Google, Amazon, Facebook, Intel, and Adobe, across industries including Finance, Recruiting, Sales, Marketing, and Security.</p><p>We’re a fully-remote company with a global footprint in over 20 countries. We're growing, profitable, employee-owned, no dependence on outside funding. Applicants from all geographies and backgrounds are welcome.</p><p>We are looking for passionate individuals for whom programming is not just a job but it’s something they love to do. We're obsessed with computers, programming, big data, databases, compilers, hardware, math, data science, and the internet. Does this sound like you? Please apply to join our team.</p><p>Our code base is very friendly to new contributors. You'll have a fully-functional development environment within hours (fully automated) and be pushing commits on your first day. Deployments to production happen multiple times per day and finish in less than 2 minutes. Effectively all of our codebase is written in Python, Rust, SQL, Javascript/TypeScript, and Nix. The core technologies you'll need familiarity with to be productive are Python, PostgreSQL, Linux, and Git.</p><p>We operate at a larger scale than typical startups. We operate two datacenters with high performance servers we've built that are capable of dealing with the volumes of data we process. We've implemented our own distributed file system. We do full-scale web crawls. We download and perform static analysis on the entire universe of Android APKs and iOS IPAs that are published. Unlike a typical startup where you'll spend half of your time in meetings, and the other half fixing bugs from Jira tickets— at MixRank you'll get to challenge yourself with difficult technical problems that will help you to grow as an individual.</p><p>We're hiring continuously for the positions below— they aren't singular positions that will close once filled. Our philosophy on hiring is that the candidate is more important than the position. 
For each new member of the team, we design a custom role and responsibilities that are specialized to their interests. Other companies will come up with a long list of specific requirements for a position with the expectation that you'll exactly replace someone from the team, or that you'll be the perfect tetris piece that satisfies the job requirements decided by a committee. MixRank is more pragmatic: we'll first get excited about having a unique individual on the team, then we'll figure out the best way to accommodate their specific talents.</p><p>--</p><p>Junior Software Engineer - Remote (Global), Full-Time</p><p>We're looking for remote junior engineers that have 0-3 years of professional experience in software, and 5+ years of curiosity exploring computers, programming, and technical hobby projects.

To stand out, please highlight what makes you unique: passion for computing, curiosity and side projects, work ethic, niche research, etc.</p><p>Ideally you've already graduated, but if you still have one or more years left of school, please feel free to apply anyway, and if you're the right fit for the team we'll figure out a way to accommodate your schedule.</p><p><a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/mixrank/jobs/Fnwsojk-junior-software-engineer-global-remote">https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/mixrank/jobs/Fnwsojk-j...</a>

                <div itemprop="articleBody">


<p>This is a follow-up to my previous article, <a href="https://www.jeffquast.com/post/ucs-detect-test-results/">Terminal Emulators Battle Royale –
Unicode Edition!</a> from 2023, in which I documented Unicode support across terminal
emulators. Since then, the <a href="https://ucs-detect.readthedocs.io/intro.html#ucs-detect">ucs-detect</a> tool and its supporting <a href="https://blessed.readthedocs.io/">blessed</a> library
have been extended to automatically detect support of <a href="https://blessed.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dec_modes.html">DEC Private Modes</a>, <a href="https://blessed.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sixel.html">sixel graphics</a>,
<a href="https://blessed.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sixel.html#window-dimensions">pixel size</a>, and <a href="https://blessed.readthedocs.io/en/latest/terminal.html#terminal-software-version">software version</a>.</p>
<p>The ucs-detect program tests terminal cursor positioning by sending visible
text followed by control sequences that request the cursor position. The
terminal responds by writing the cursor location as simulated keyboard input.
The ucs-detect program reads and compares these values against the <a href="https://wcwidth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html">Python wcwidth</a>
library result, logging any discrepancies.</p>
<div id="the-width-problem">
<h2>The Width Problem</h2>
<p>Terminal emulators face a fundamental challenge: mapping the vast breadth of
Unicode scripts into a fixed-width grid while maintaining legibility. A terminal
must predict whether each character occupies one cell or two, whether combining
marks overlay previous characters, and how emoji sequences collapse into single
glyphs.</p>
<p>These predictions fail routinely. Zero-width joiners, variation selectors, and
grapheme clustering compound in complexity. When terminals and CLI applications
guess wrong, text becomes unreadable - cursors misalign and corrupt output and
so then also corrupt the location of our input.</p>
<p>Our results share which terminals have the best "Unicode support" -- the least
likely to exhibit these kinds of problems.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-gentleman-errant">
<h2>The Gentleman Errant</h2>
<p>Before presenting the latest results, <a href="https://ghostty.org/">Ghostty</a> warrants particular attention,
not only because it scored the highest among all terminals tested, but that it
was publicly released only this year by Mitchell Hashimoto.  It is a significant
advancement. Developed from scratch in <a href="https://ziglang.org/">zig</a>, the Unicode support implementation
is thoroughly correct.</p>
<p>In 2023, Mitchell published <a href="https://mitchellh.com/writing/grapheme-clusters-in-terminals">Grapheme Clusters and Terminal Emulators</a>,
demonstrating a commitment to understanding and implementing the fundamentals.
His recent announcement of <a href="https://mitchellh.com/writing/libghostty-is-coming">libghostty</a> provides a welcome alternative to <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/vte">libvte</a>,
potentially enabling a new generation of terminals on a foundation of strong
Unicode support.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-errant-champion">
<h2>The Errant Champion</h2>
<p>Kovid Goyal's <a href="https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/">Kitty</a> scored just as well, only outranked by the arbitrary
weights that are not necessarily fair.  More important than scoring is Kovid's
publication of a <a href="https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/text-sizing-protocol/#the-algorithm-for-splitting-text-into-cells">text-splitting algorithm description</a> that closely matches
the <a href="https://wcwidth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/specs.html">Python wcwidth specification</a>. This is unsurprising since both are
derived from careful interpretation of <a href="https://unicode.org/">Unicode.org</a> standards and that it scores
so highly in our test.</p>
<p><a href="https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/">Kitty</a> and <a href="https://ghostty.org/">Ghostty</a> are the only terminals that correctly support <a href="https://unicode.org/reports/tr51/#Emoji_Variation_Sequences">Variation
Selector 15</a>, I have not written much about it because it is not likely to see
any practical use, but, it will be added to a future release of Python
wcwidth now that there are multiple standards and reference implementations
in agreement.</p>
</div>
<div id="testing-results">
<h2>Testing Results</h2>
<p>The first table, <a href="https://ucs-detect.readthedocs.io/results.html#general-tabulated-summary">General Tabulated Summary</a> describes unicode features
of each terminal, then, a brief summary of DEC Private Modes, sixel support,
and testing time.</p>

<p>The second table, <a href="https://ucs-detect.readthedocs.io/results.html#dec-private-modes-support">DEC Private Modes Support</a> (not pictured), contains the
first feature capability matrix of <a href="https://blessed.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dec_modes.html">DEC Private Modes</a> for Terminals of any
length.  I hope this is useful most especially to developers of CLI libraries
and applications.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-long-road">
<h2>The Long Road</h2>
<p>The most notable finding relates to performance.  That many terminals perform so
slowly was surprising, so I have included the elapsed time in the results.</p>
<p><a href="https://iterm2.com/">iTerm2</a> and <a href="https://extraterm.org/">Extraterm</a> consume a majority of the CPU and perform so slowly that
the test parameters were reduced to finish within the hour what many other
terminals manage in a few minutes.</p>
<p><a href="https://help.gnome.org/users/gnome-terminal/stable/">GNOME Terminal</a> and its VTE-based derivatives also perform too slowly for a
full test, taking over 5 hours while consuming very little CPU.  Many
terminals exhibit stalls or inefficiencies in their event loops that result in
slow automatic responses, but we should be forgiving; nobody really considered
the need to handle hundreds of automatic sequence replies per second!</p>
<p>I expected Python wcwidth to consume the most CPU resources during testing, as
it is frequently called and always the "highest-level" language in the mix, but
it keeps up pretty well for most terminals.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, I dedicated effort to optimizing the Python wcwidth
implementation using techniques including bit vectors, bloom filters, and varying
sizes of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_replacement_algorithm#Least_recently_used">LRU</a> caches. The results confirmed that the existing implementation
performed best: a <a href="https://github.com/jquast/wcwidth/blob/5ba540df3386255dcde94bf867665ddf1cab868f/wcwidth/wcwidth.py#L76-L145">binary search</a> with a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.lru_cache">functools.lru_cache</a> decorator.</p>
<p>The LRU cache is effective because human languages typically use a small,
repetitive subset of Unicode. The ucs-detect tool tests hundreds of languages
from the <a href="https://ucs-detect.readthedocs.io/intro.html#udhr-data">UDHR dataset</a>, excluding only those without any interesting zero
or wide characters. This dataset provides an extreme but practical demonstration
of LRU cache benefits when processing Unicode.</p>
<p>I previously <a href="https://github.com/jquast/wcwidth/issues/103">considered distributing</a> a C module with Python wcwidth for
greater performance, but the existing Python implementation keeps up well enough
with the fastest terminals. When fully exhausted the text scroll speed is fast
enough to produce screen tearing artifacts.</p>
</div>
<div id="tilting-at-edges">
<h2>Tilting at Edges</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.enlightenment.org/about-terminology">Terminology</a> produces inconsistent results between executions. Our tests are
designed to be deterministic, so these kinds of results suggest possible state
corruption. Despite this issue, Terminology offers interesting visual effects
that would be a welcome feature in other terminals.</p>
<p><a href="https://iterm2.com/">iTerm2</a> reports "supported, but disabled, and cannot be changed" status for
all <a href="https://blessed.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dec_modes.html">DEC Private Modes</a> queried, including fictional modes like <tt>9876543</tt>.
For this reason, the summary of DEC Private Modes shows only those modes that
are changeable.</p>
<p><a href="https://apps.kde.org/konsole/">Konsole</a> does not reply to queries about <a href="https://blessed.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dec_modes.html">DEC Private modes</a>, but does support
several modes when they are enabled. For this reason, ucs-detect cannot
automatically infer which DEC Modes Konsole supports.</p>
<p>Similarly, ucs-detect reports "No DEC Private Mode Support" for <a href="https://contour-terminal.org/">Contour</a>. I
investigated this discrepancy because Contour's author also authored a <a href="https://github.com/contour-terminal/terminal-unicode-core/blob/master/spec/terminal-unicode-core.tex">Mode
2027</a> specification dependent on this functionality.  The issue was that
Contour responded with a different mode number than the one queried. While
developing <a href="https://github.com/contour-terminal/contour/pull/1797">a fix</a>, Contour's latest release from December 2024 presented an
additional complication: <a href="https://github.com/contour-terminal/contour/issues/1710">a bad escape key configuration</a>. Each instance of
being stuck in vi required typing <tt>CTRL + [</tt> as a workaround!</p>
<p>Terminals based on <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/vte">libvte</a> with software version label <tt>VTE/7600</tt> continue to
show identical performance with low scores in our tests, unchanged from 2023.</p>
<p>My <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/vte/-/issues/2580#note_1973274">attempt to discuss</a> improving Unicode support in libvte received substantial
criticism. However, recent libvte project issue <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/vte/-/issues/2909">Support Emoji Sequences</a> is a
positive indicator for improved language and Emoji support in 2026.</p>
</div>
<div id="on-mode-2027">
<h2>On Mode 2027</h2>
<p>I included DEC Private <a href="https://github.com/contour-terminal/terminal-unicode-core/blob/master/spec/terminal-unicode-core.tex">Mode 2027</a> in the results to accompany Mitchell's table
from his article, <a href="https://mitchellh.com/writing/grapheme-clusters-in-terminals">Grapheme Clusters and Terminal Emulators</a>, and to verify for
myself that it has limited utility.</p>
<p>In theory, a CLI program can query this mode to classify a terminal as
"reasonably supporting" unicode, but not which specific features or version
level. Since other terminals with similar capabilities do not respond to Mode
2027 queries, this binary indicator has limited utility.</p>
<p>The only practical approach to determining Unicode support of a terminal is to
interactively test for specific features, codepoints, and at the Unicode version
levels of interest, as ucs-detect does.</p>
</div>
<div id="beyond-fixed-widths">
<h2>Beyond Fixed Widths</h2>
<p>Terminals cannot reproduce many of the world's languages legibly when constrained
to monospace cells. The measurements dictated by rapidly expanding Unicode standards
and varying implementation levels create inherent tension.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/text-sizing-protocol/">text sizing protocol</a> published early this year represents a significant
development. Kovid Goyal describes the motivation <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PYLPC3dzWQ">in a recent interview</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
And then my next windmill that I'm looking at is variable-sized text in the
terminal. So when I'm catting a markdown file, I want to see the headings big.</blockquote>
<p>While this feature may enable more advanced typesetting-like capabilities in
terminal apps, it also promises to increase accessibility. Allowing text
to escape monospace constraints enables legible support of the diverse set of
the world's languages.</p>
<p>For example, using Contour with <tt><span>ucs-detect</span> <span>--stop-at-error=lang</span></tt>, stopping to
take a look at a result of the language <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kh%C3%BCn_language">Khün</a>:</p>
<p><img alt="/images/contour-khun-example.png" src="https://www.jeffquast.com/images/contour-khun-example.png"></p><p>In this case <a href="https://contour-terminal.org/">Contour</a> and Python wcwidth disagree on measurement, but more
important is the legibility. We can compare this given Khün text to the
<a href="https://kate-editor.org/">Kate</a> editor:</p>
<p><img alt="/images/kate-khun-example.png" src="https://www.jeffquast.com/images/kate-khun-example.png"></p><p>They are clearly different. I regret I cannot study it more carefully, but I
suggest that terminals could more easily display complex scripts by switching
to a variable size text mode, allowing the font engine to drive the text without
careful processing of cell and cursor movement.</p>
<p>Although I have yet to experiment with it, I am encouraged to see some
resolution to this problem by the progressive changes suggested by the <a href="https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/text-sizing-protocol/">text
sizing protocol</a>.</p>

            <p data-beyondwords-marker="29d3e8fe-5cb8-4332-b285-5bd3bb5ba1f0"><span>I</span>n the cold waters of the Pacific, the anchoveta once shimmered in swarms so vast that sailors described them as turning the sea into a river of quicksilver. They were small, unassuming fish, yet the abundance of the ocean rested upon their delicate bones. Seabirds wheeled overhead in their millions, sea lions and whales dove into their depths, and predatory fish rose through the blue to feed on them. In those shoals lived the vitality of the sea itself. But in our age, the anchoveta, along with sardines and menhaden, have been transformed from living threads in an ancient web into bags of meal and casks of oil. Ninety percent of the forage fish caught by human hands are not eaten by us but ground down to feed salmon being raised in the cold fjords of Norway and shrimp and fish in the tropical ponds of Southeast Asia.</p>
      
    <p data-beyondwords-marker="405b4859-c1bf-402b-bc36-bd2c50a8ed39">It is one of the great ironies of our time. To farm the sea, we strip the sea. We take from the ocean’s foundation to build its surface anew, and in the process we imperil both. In 2016, the anchoveta failed to arrive in the expected numbers, and entire fishing seasons in Peru were canceled. Again in 2023, the same collapse occurred, this time coinciding with a spike in ocean temperatures that drove the fish to depths where nets could not reach. The seabirds starved, their nests abandoned. Seal pups died in the thousands. Farmers watched as the price of feed climbed and their livelihoods faltered. What seemed infinite revealed itself as fragile.</p><p data-beyondwords-marker="e47378d3-9272-4b1b-8ae4-c08b9c407818">Kevin Fitzsimmons, an aquaculture scientist at the University of Arizona, has described the predicament with characteristic bluntness: “Reliance on wild-caught marine-animal ingredients is a weak link in the aquaculture supply chain. It puts global seafood security at risk, while also affecting vital marine ecosystems.” As the former president of the World Aquaculture Society, Fitzsimmons knows that what appears efficient on paper is brittle in practice.</p><blockquote data-beyondwords-marker="45f35a96-1034-4099-803e-e156e1e4941a">

          </div><p data-beyondwords-marker="ab66ed79-44a2-4b6c-bc1a-dc666e4da25f">Today, Fitzimmons is chairman of the <a href="https://farm.f3challenge.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">F3 Challenge</a>, a competition for the aquaculture industry to produce marine-animal free food for farmed fish. “Amid growing supply chain uncertainties, this contest offers an opportunity to future-proof farm operations by developing strong, sustainable feed contingency plans,” Fitzsimmons said. It is the voice of a scientist speaking, but also of a pragmatist who knows that disruption, like the sudden cancellation of Peru’s anchoveta fishery, will come again.</p><p data-beyondwords-marker="2b3eaa28-130d-4f71-9f5b-13d44c2df85a">The paradox of aquaculture is that it is at once a salvation and a threat. It now provides more than half the fish we eat, and it has spared some wild stocks from further collapse. Yet the act of raising carnivorous fish—salmon, trout, grouper, shrimp—has bound us more tightly to the fragile shoals of forage fish. This is what scientists call the forage fish bottleneck. And in this bottleneck, the future of seafood, of food security for billions, of entire ocean ecosystems, is squeezed.</p><p data-beyondwords-marker="0c1a05bf-0e6e-45ae-bdf3-4d753c4cddd2">The realization that fish do not need to eat fish to grow—that what they require are nutrients, not the bodies of other creatures—may seem obvious once said aloud. But it is an idea as revolutionary as the day when humans first understood that plants could be sown in neat rows and harvested, that food could be cultivated rather than chased. The birth of agriculture 10,000 years ago was not the discovery of seeds; it was the recognition that sustenance could be abstracted, reimagined, shaped to our will. So too now, the future of fish feed begins with a recognition: The proteins and oils that have always come from the sea can come, instead, from our imagination.</p><figure data-beyondwords-marker="e1cccb28-1c0f-440d-b52b-2bdd386154e5"><img width="800" height="524" alt="In Body Image" src="https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/ASQwFd2i-Steele_BREAKER.png?auto=compress&amp;fit=scale&amp;fm=png&amp;h=671&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1&amp;w=1024&amp;wpsize=large" srcset="https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/ASQwFd2i-Steele_BREAKER.png?q=65&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1600 800w,https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/ASQwFd2i-Steele_BREAKER.png?q=65&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1200 600w,https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/ASQwFd2i-Steele_BREAKER.png?q=65&amp;auto=format&amp;w=800 400w" loading="lazy"><figcaption><strong>BARRACUDA: </strong>Aquaculture has become a barracuda industry of the ocean, catching and mashing forage fish into feed for farmed seafood. <em>Photo by Virgil Zetterlind.</em></figcaption></figure>

          </div><p data-beyondwords-marker="b0af93df-2562-42e7-9722-d4cbd125aefd">When Fitzsimmons and his colleagues launched the F3 Challenge in 2015, they did not turn to governments to regulate or to foundations to endow. They chose instead the ancient spur of human ingenuity: a prize. “By incentivizing farms to innovate,” Fitzsimmons explained, “we reduce pressure on wild fish stocks while building a more resilient and sustainable seafood system for the future.”</p><p data-beyondwords-marker="f43a80c2-9e29-4feb-b470-858243313df1">History remembers moments like this. The prize offered for determining longitude at sea in the 18th century, which spurred clockmakers to craft chronometers more precise than ever imagined. The Orteig Prize, which drove Charles Lindbergh across the Atlantic, opening the era of aviation. Similarly, the F3 Challenge is not a discovery imposed from above, but a challenge flung wide, trusting that competition and ambition will drive a breakthrough.</p><p data-beyondwords-marker="72c642d2-e758-46c9-aec7-fc06eae91e74">And breakthroughs came. A Chinese company, Evergreen Feed, demonstrated that plant-based blends could scale to industrial volumes, saving an estimated 350 million forage fish. Veramaris, a joint venture in the Netherlands and the United States, cultivated algae that produced the same omega-3 fatty acids found in fish oil, and in quantities sufficient to replace billions of forage fish. In Ecuador and Japan, companies devised feeds for shrimp and sea bream, proving that even the most voracious of farmed carnivores could thrive without wild prey. Each success was counted not only in profit, but in the lives of the small fish left in the sea: hundreds of millions here, billions there.</p><p data-beyondwords-marker="411b9c74-e51e-4185-8b62-c4261f18fc45">The contests have continued, each more ambitious than the last. A challenge to replace krill, the shrimp-like creatures that sustain penguins and whales was won by BRF, a Brazilian company using Chicken hydrolysate, a product made by using enzymes to break down chicken protein into smaller, more easily digestible peptides, and by Symrise, a German company working with flavors and fragrances to enhance the non-marine food’s appeal to farmed fish. A new competition now rewards not just feed producers but fish farms themselves, those willing to commit their entire operations to marine-ingredient-free diets. The ambition is not modest.</p>

<p data-beyondwords-marker="5a202e78-c8c2-4d8a-bb3b-5f7c76a42505">Labels on seafood could proclaim “fish-free feed,” like “grass-fed” on beef.</p>
</blockquote><p data-beyondwords-marker="f2f03631-3492-4ecf-96ed-736d2c031b0a">The tools of this new future are dazzling in their diversity. Algae fermenters that glow with green light, their oils rich in DHA (docosapentaenoic acid) and EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid), both types of omega 3 fatty acids identical to the molecules that give fish their nourishment. Tanks of bacteria fed on carbon dioxide or methane, spinning waste into protein, a kind of culinary alchemy. Insects—black soldier fly larvae—raised on food scraps, their bodies transformed into high-protein meal. Yeasts bubbling in vats like beer, dried into powders that rival fishmeal in digestibility. Even the humble pea and soybean, engineered and processed until their amino acid profiles mimic those of the anchoveta. Each of these is not simply a replacement, but a reinvention: a recognition that the fabric of nutrition is not bound to one source but can be woven anew.</p><p data-beyondwords-marker="efbb068d-5fff-4cc1-a6a7-e34dd2f32b9f">To coordinate this frontier, the Future of Fish Feed, a collaborative effort between NGOs, researchers, and private partnerships to support alternative aquaculture feed, created the Feed Innovation Network, an open commons where recipes are shared, protocols exchanged, trials published. In an industry long bound by secrecy, this openness is itself a revolution. And in farms across the world, from shrimp ponds in Ecuador to bass tanks in the U.S., demonstration trials show that these diets work. Carnivores remain carnivores, and yet the ocean remains more whole.</p><p data-beyondwords-marker="daa75866-211b-4739-ab5f-9f927f9f26c0">At stake is more than the <a href="https://nautil.us/the-high-price-of-cheap-shrimp-238512/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">price of shrimp</a> or the yield of salmon. It is the resilience of entire ecosystems. Forage fish are the currency of the sea. To deplete them is to starve seabirds, to silence the calls of whales, to empty the beaches of seals. To spare them is to let the ocean breathe. At stake, too, is human food security. By mid-century, 10 billion mouths will need feeding, and aquaculture is one of the surest ways to provide protein. But if aquaculture is shackled to the rise and fall of forage fish, then it will falter when most needed. And finally, at stake is the climate itself. If bacteria can be grown on carbon waste, if algae can thrive on light and air, then aquaculture can become not a burden but a partner in the work of repairing the planet.</p>

          </div><p data-beyondwords-marker="eab5c6ed-184d-424f-a253-18150be7a508">One can already imagine the cultural shift that might follow. Labels on seafood proclaiming “fish-free feed,” just as beef carries the words “grass-fed.” A shrimp cocktail served at a wedding, its story not of plundered krill but of innovation, of microbes turned to nourishment. The act of eating fish would carry with it a continuity, not a rupture, with the health of the sea.</p><p data-beyondwords-marker="e3f8769c-e648-4b8d-8c87-f5d9e9bfa9b5">And here, perhaps, lies the deepest resonance. Human history is a succession of moments when we recognized that our survival depended not on taking more from nature, but on working with her patterns. Agriculture, fire, medicine, electricity—all arose from this recognition. The F3 Challenge is another of those moments. It is not about feed alone. It is about the imagination to see that the scaffolding of life can be rebuilt by our own hands, if only we choose to do so.</p><p data-beyondwords-marker="28195d80-54a1-4277-ab82-2f8a5f86faa7">Today, the anchoveta still swim, though in fewer numbers, and the seabirds still wheel above them. But their future, like ours, now depends on whether we will grind them into meal until none remain, or whether we will let them remain what they have always been: the living silver of the sea. “Our shared future becomes more sustainable,” Fitzsimmons said, “only if we can learn to take the pressure off the oceans and create feeds that free us from this dependence.” The future of fish feed is the future of fish. And the future of fish is the future of us all. <img decoding="async" src="https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/nautilus-favicon-14.png?fm=png" alt=""></p><p data-beyondwords-marker="bf88c3d6-eb4f-4475-86c3-763a39c8cd63"><em>Lead image: A salmon farm in Norway.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>


<p>
On each of the last two Fridays, Google has suspended <a href="https://sslmate.com/" rel="external">SSLMate</a>'s Google Cloud access without notification, having previously suspended
it in 2024 without notification. But this isn't just another cautionary tale about using Google Cloud
Platform; it's also a story about usable security and how Google's capriciousness is forcing me to choose
between weakening security or reducing usability.
</p>

<p>
Apart from testing and experimentation, the only reason SSLMate still has a Google Cloud presence
is to enable integrations with our customers' Google Cloud accounts so that we can
publish certificate validation DNS records and discover domain names to monitor
on their behalf.  We create a service account for each customer under our Google Cloud project,
and ask the customer to authorize this service account to access Cloud DNS and Cloud Domains.
When SSLMate needs to access a customer's Google Cloud account, it impersonates the corresponding
service account.  I developed this system based on a suggestion in <a href="https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/13463817?sjid=3625613075585023337-NA#zippy=%2Chow-can-i-access-data-from-my-users-google-cloud-project-using-cloud-apis" rel="external">Google's own documentation</a> (under "How can I access data from my users' Google Cloud project using Cloud APIs?") and it works really well.
It is both very easy for the customer to configure, and secure: there are no long-lived credentials or confused
deputy vulnerabilities.
</p>

<p>
Easy <em>and</em> secure: I love it when that's possible!
</p>

<p>
The only problem is that Google keeps suspending our Google Cloud access.
</p>


<h4>The First Suspension</h4>

<p>
Google suspended us for the first time in 2024.  Our customer integrations began failing, and
logging into the Google Cloud console returned this error:
</p>

<p><a href="https://www.agwa.name/blog/post/google_suspended_sslmates_cloud_account_again/media/1.png"><img src="https://www.agwa.name/blog/post/google_suspended_sslmates_cloud_account_again/media/1.png" alt="Screenshot of Google Cloud web page stating &quot;Your account has been disabled&quot;"></a></p>

<p>
Although Google's customer support people were surprisingly responsive considering Google's
rock-bottom reputation in this area, the process to recover our account was super frustrating:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Google required me to email them from the address associated with the account, but when
I did so, the message was bounced with the error "The account [redacted] is disabled" (the
redacted portion being the email address I sent from).  When I emailed from a different address, the message went
through, but the support people initially refused to communicate with it because it was the wrong address.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
At one point Google asked me to provide the IDs of our Google Cloud projects - information which I could not retrieve
because I couldn't log in to the console.  Have <em>you</em> saved your project IDs in a safe place in case your account gets suspended?
</p>
</li>



<li>
<p>
After several emails back and forth with Google support, and verifying a phone number, I was able to log back into the
Google Cloud console, but two of our projects were still suspended, including the one needed for the customer integrations.
(At the time, we still had some domains registered through Google Cloud Domains, and thankfully the project
for this was accessible, allowing me to begin transferring all of our domains out to a more dependable registrar.)
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
The day after I regained access to the console, I received an
automated email from no-reply@accounts.google.com stating that my
access to Google Cloud Platform had been restricted.  Once again, I could no
longer access the console, but the error message was different this time:
</p>

<p><a href="https://www.agwa.name/blog/post/google_suspended_sslmates_cloud_account_again/media/2.png"><img src="https://www.agwa.name/blog/post/google_suspended_sslmates_cloud_account_again/media/2.png" alt="Screenshot of Google Cloud web page stating &quot;Access to a service or feature has been restricted&quot; and listing Google Cloud Platform as &quot;Entire service unavailable&quot;"></a></p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Twelve hours later, I received multiple automated
emails from google-cloud-compliance@google.com stating that my Google
Cloud projects had been "reinstated" but I still could not access the
console.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Seven hours after that, I got another automated email from
no-reply@accounts.google.com stating that my access to Google Cloud
Platform had been restored.  Everything began working after this.
</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
I was never told why our account was suspended or what could be done to
prevent it from happening again.
Although <a href="https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/project-suspension-guidelines" rel="external">Google claims
to send emails when an account or project is suspended</a>, they never did so for the initial suspension.
Since errors with customer integrations were only being displayed in our customers' SSLMate consoles (usually
an error indicates the customer made a mistake), I didn't learn about the suspension right away.  I fixed this by
adding a health check that fails if a large percentage of Google Cloud integrations have errors.
</p>

<h4>The Second Suspension</h4>

<p>
Two Fridays ago, that health check failed.  I immediately investigated and saw
that all but one Google Cloud integrations were failing with the same error as during
last year's suspension ("Invalid grant: account not found").  Groaning, I tried logging into the Google Cloud console,
bracing myself for another Kafkaesque reinstatement process.  <em>At least I know
the project IDs this time</em>, I reassured myself.  Surprisingly, I was able to log in
successfully.  Then I got emails, one per Google Cloud project, informing me
that my projects had been reinstated "based on information that [I] have provided."
Naturally, I had received no emails that they had been suspended in the first place.
The integrations started working again.
</p>



<h4>The Third Suspension</h4>

<p>
Last Friday, the health check failed again.  I logged in to the Google Cloud console,
unsure what to expect.  This time, I was presented with a <em>third</em>
type of error message:
</p>

<p><a href="https://www.agwa.name/blog/post/google_suspended_sslmates_cloud_account_again/media/3.png"><img src="https://www.agwa.name/blog/post/google_suspended_sslmates_cloud_account_again/media/3.png" alt="Screenshot of Google Cloud web page stating &quot;We have detected a Terms of Service violation in SSLMate Integrations&quot; and containing a form to submit an appeal"></a></p>

<p>
Most, but not all, of SSLMate's Google Cloud projects were suspended, including the one needed
for customer integrations.
</p>

<p>
I submitted an appeal on Friday. 
On Sunday, I received an email from Google. Was it a response to the appeal? Nope!
It was an automated email stating that SSLMate's access to Google Cloud was now <em>completely</em> suspended.
</p>

<h4>The Lucky Customer</h4>

<p>
Incredibly, we have one lucky customer whose integration has continued to work
during every suspension, even though it uses a service account in the same suspended project
as all the other customer integrations.
</p>

<h4>What Now?</h4>

<p>
Clearly, I cannot rely on having a Google account for production use cases.
Google has built a complex, unreliable system in which
some or all of the following can be suspended: an entire Google account, a Google
Cloud Platform account, or individual Google Cloud projects.
</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the alternatives for integrations are not great.</p>



<p>
The first alternative is to ask customers to create a service account for SSLMate and have SSLMate
authenticate to it using a long-lived key.  This is pretty easy, but less secure since the
long-lived key could leak and can never be rotated in practice.
</p>

<p>
The second alternative is to use OpenID Connect, aka OIDC.  In recent years, OIDC has become the de facto standard
for integrations between service providers.  For example, you can use OIDC to let <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/secure-your-work/security-harden-deployments/oidc-in-google-cloud-platform" rel="external">GitHub Actions
access your Google Cloud account</a> without the need for long-lived credentials.  SSLMate's Azure integration
uses OIDC and it works well.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, Google has made setting up OIDC unnecessarily difficult.  What is currently
a simple one step process for our customers to add an integration (assign some roles to a service account) would
become a complicated seven step process:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Enable the IAM Service Account Credentials API.</li>
<li>Create a service account.</li>
<li>Create a workload identity pool.</li>
<li>Create a workload identity provider in the pool created in step 3.</li>
<li>Allow SSLMate to impersonate the service account created in step 2 (this requires knowing the ID of the pool created in step 3).</li>
<li>Assign roles to the service account created in step 2.</li>
<li>Provide SSLMate with the ID of the service account created in step 2, and the ID of the workload identity provider created in step 4.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Since many of the steps require knowing the identifiers of resources created in previous steps, it's hard for SSLMate to provide easy-to-follow instructions.
</p>

<p>
This is more complicated than it needs to be:
</p>

<ul><li><p>Creating a service account (steps 1, 2, and 5) should not be necessary.  While it is possible to forgo a service account and assign roles directly to an identity from the pool, not all Google Cloud services support this. If you want your integration to work with all current and future services, you have to impersonate a service account.  Google should stop treating OIDC like a second-class citizen and guarantee that all current and future services will directly support it.</p></li><li><p>Creating an identity pool shouldn't be necessary either.  While I'm sure some use
cases are nicely served by pools, it seems like most setups
are going to have just one provider per pool, making the extra step
of creating a pool nothing but unnecessary busy work.</p></li><li><p>Even creating a provider shouldn't be necessary; it should be possible to assign roles
directly to an OIDC issuer URL and subject. You should only have to create
a provider if you need to do more advanced configuration, such as mapping
attributes.</p></li></ul>

<p>
I find this state of affairs unacceptable, because it's really, really important to move away
from long-lived credentials and Google ought to be doing everything possible
to encourage more secure alternatives.  Sadly, SSLMate's current solution of
provider-created service accounts is susceptible to
arbitrary account suspensions, and OIDC is hampered by an unnecessarily complicated setup process.
</p>

<p>
In summary, when setting up cross-provider access with Google Cloud, you can have only two of the following:
</p>

<ol>
<li>No dangerous long-lived credentials.</li>
<li>Easy for the customer to set up.</li>
<li>Safe from arbitrary account suspensions.</li>
</ol>


<table>
	<thead>
		
		<tr>
			<th>Provider-created service accounts</th>
			<th>Service account + key</th>
			<th>OpenID Connect</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>No long-lived keys</td>
			<td></td>
			<td>No long-lived keys</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Easy setup</td>
			<td>Easy setup</td>
			<td></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td></td>
			<td>Safe from suspension</td>
			<td>Safe from suspension</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p>Which two would you pick?</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      
      <p><a href="https://nextcloud.com/">Nextcloud.</a> I really want to like it, but it’s making it really difficult.</p>
<p>I like what Nextcloud offers with its feature set and how easily it replaces a bunch of services under one roof (files,
calendar, contacts, notes, to-do lists, photos etc.), but no matter how hard I try and how much I optimize its resources
on my home server, it feels slow to use, even on hardware that is ranging from decent to good. Then I opened developer
tools and found the culprit.</p>
<p><em><strong>It’s the Javascript.</strong></em></p>
<p>On a clean page load, you will be downloading about <strong>15-20 MB</strong> of Javascript, which does compress down to about 4-5
MB in transit, but that is still <strong>a huge amount of Javascript.</strong> For context, I consider 1 MB of Javascript to be on the
heavy side for a web page/app.</p>
<p>Yes, that Javascript will be cached in the browser for a while, but you will still be executing all of that on each
visit to your Nextcloud instance, and that will take a long time due to the sheer amount of code your browser now has to
execute on the page.</p>
<p>A significant contributor to this heft seems to be the <code>core-common.js</code> bundle, which based on its name seems to provide
some common functionality that’s shared across different Nextcloud apps that one can install. It’s coming in at <strong>4.71
MB</strong> at the time of writing.</p>
<p>Then you want notifications, right? <code>NotificationsApp.chunk.mjs</code> is here to cover you, at <strong>1.06 MB</strong>.</p>
<p>Then there are the app-specific views. The Calendar app is taking up <strong>5.94 MB</strong> to show a basic calendar view.</p>

<p>This means that even on an iPhone 13 mini, opening the Tasks app (to-do list), will take a ridiculously long time.
Imagine opening your shopping list at the store and having to wait 5-10 seconds before you see anything, even with a
solid 5G connection. Sounds extremely annoying, right?</p>
<p>I suspect that a lot of this is due to how Nextcloud is architected. There’s bound to be some hefty common libraries and
tools that allow app developers to provide a unified experience, but even then there is something seriously wrong with
the end result, the functionality to bundle size ratio is way off.</p>
<p>As a result, I’ve started branching out some things from Nextcloud, such as replacing the Tasks app with using a
private <a href="https://vikunja.io/">Vikunja</a> instance, and Photos to a private <a href="https://immich.app/">Immich</a> instance. Vikunja
is not perfect, but its 1.5 MB of Javascript is an order of magnitude smaller compared to Nextcloud, making it feel
incredibly fast in comparison.</p>
<p>However, with other functionality I have to admit that the convenience of Nextcloud is enough to dissuade me from
replacing it elsewhere, due to the available feature set comparing well to alternatives.</p>
<p><em><strong>For now.</strong></em></p>
<p>I’m sure that there are some legitimate reasons behind the current state, and overworked development teams and
volunteers are unfortunately the norm in the industry, but it doesn’t take away the fact that the user experience and
accessibility suffers as a result.</p>
<p>I’d like to thank <a href="https://infrequently.org/about-me/">Alex Russell</a> for writing about web performance and why it
matters, with supporting evidence and actionable advice, it has changed how I view websites and web apps and has pushed
me to be better in my own work. I highly suggest reading his content, starting
with <a href="https://infrequently.org/series/performance-inequality/">the performance inequality gap series.</a> It’s educational,
insightful and incredibly irritating once you learn how crap most things are and how careless a lot of development teams
are towards performance and accessibility.</p>

<p>What impact is AI having on the job market? </p>



<p>Everyone has an opinion, but there’s surprisingly little hard data.</p>



<p>Instead, what we have are <a href="https://budgetlab.yale.edu/research/evaluating-impact-ai-labor-market-current-state-affairs">very general studies that analyze broad sectors</a>, and <a href="https://digitaleconomy.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Canaries_BrynjolfssonChandarChen.pdf">studies that just look at a specific segment like young workers</a>.</p>



<p>So I decided to perform my own study. I analyzed nearly 180 million global job postings from January 2023 to October 2025, using data from Revealera, a provider of jobs data. While I acknowledge not all job postings result in a hire, and some are ‘ghost jobs’, since I was comparing the relative growth in job titles, this didn’t seem like a big issue to me.</p>



<p>I simply wanted to know <em><strong>which specific job titles declined or grew the most</strong></em> in 2025, compared to 2024. Because those were likely to be ones that AI is impacting the most. </p>



<p>For those that are busy, you can jump to a specific section of this study you’re interested in. The exact methodology I used is in the very bottom too.</p>



<div>
  <p><strong>Key Sections</strong></p><ul>
    <li><a href="#bullet1">Total Job Postings declined 8% in 2025</a></li>
    <li><a href="#bullet1b">Which job titles declined the most in 2025 compared to 2024?</a></li>

    <li><a href="#bullet2">Creative jobs declined the most but not all of them</a></li>

    <li><a href="#bullet3">Corporate compliance + sustainability jobs are declining fast</a></li>

<h2 id="bullet1">1. Total Job Postings declined 8% in 2025</h2>



<p>First, let’s establish our benchmark: job postings dropped 8% in 2025 compared to the same period in 2024. Indeed reported a 7.3% year-over-year decline for US jobs recently, so this was a good sanity check, and told me that my data most likely was comprehensive.</p>



<p>Why does this 8% number matter? Because it’s our baseline. When we look at individual job titles and their % change, we need to know: are they following the market down, or are they getting hit harder? </p>



<p>Could AI be partly responsible for this overall 8% decline? Maybe – but that’s nearly impossible to separate from macro factors. So this analysis focuses on jobs with <em>dramatic</em> deviations from the market trend, where AI’s impact is most clear.</p>



<p id="bullet1b"><strong>Jobs with the Biggest Declines in 2025</strong></p>



<p>Now, let’s start with the jobs with the biggest declines year over year:</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="942" height="584" src="https://bloomberry.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Jobs-with-the-biggest-declines-in-new-job-postings-from-2024-to-2025-3.png" alt="" srcset="https://bloomberry.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Jobs-with-the-biggest-declines-in-new-job-postings-from-2024-to-2025-3.png 942w, https://bloomberry.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Jobs-with-the-biggest-declines-in-new-job-postings-from-2024-to-2025-3-300x186.png 300w, https://bloomberry.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Jobs-with-the-biggest-declines-in-new-job-postings-from-2024-to-2025-3-768x476.png 768w, https://bloomberry.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Jobs-with-the-biggest-declines-in-new-job-postings-from-2024-to-2025-3-512x317.png 512w, https://bloomberry.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Jobs-with-the-biggest-declines-in-new-job-postings-from-2024-to-2025-3-920x570.png 920w" sizes="(max-width: 942px) 100vw, 942px"></figure>



<h2 id="bullet2">2. Creative roles that “execute” are declining while creative leadership roles are doing OK</h2>



<p>Among the top 10 declining roles, 3 are creative positions: computer graphic artists (-33%), photographers (-28%), and writers (-28%). Computer graphic artists includes roles such as technical artists, 3d artists, and VFX artists. Writers include copywriters, copy editors and technical writers.</p>



<p>Just outside the top 10, journalists/reporters (-22%) is also experiencing a decline.</p>



<p>This isn’t a one-year blip, unfortunately. These appear to be 2 year declines. Computer graphic artists have fallen for two straight years (down 12% in 2024, then another 33% in 2025). Photographers and writers followed the same pattern.</p>



<p>Looking beyond these declining roles, though, not all creative positions are suffering that much, relative to our -8% benchmark:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="633" src="https://bloomberry.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Creative-Jobs_-change-in-of-new-job-postings-from-2024-to-2025-2-1024x633.png" alt="" srcset="https://bloomberry.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Creative-Jobs_-change-in-of-new-job-postings-from-2024-to-2025-2-1024x633.png 1024w, https://bloomberry.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Creative-Jobs_-change-in-of-new-job-postings-from-2024-to-2025-2-300x186.png 300w, https://bloomberry.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Creative-Jobs_-change-in-of-new-job-postings-from-2024-to-2025-2-768x475.png 768w, https://bloomberry.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Creative-Jobs_-change-in-of-new-job-postings-from-2024-to-2025-2-512x317.png 512w, https://bloomberry.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Creative-Jobs_-change-in-of-new-job-postings-from-2024-to-2025-2-920x569.png 920w, https://bloomberry.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Creative-Jobs_-change-in-of-new-job-postings-from-2024-to-2025-2.png 1153w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>Roles that involve creative direction/strategy are much more resistant to AI. So jobs like creative directors, creative managers and  creative producers are doing better than execution-roles.</p>



<p>Likewise roles that involve more complex decision making and client interactions are doing better. A graphic designer spends a lot of time interpreting client feedback, and iterating. The same goes for product designers. Their work involves conducting user research, and making strategic decisions about what to build and why. </p>



<p>So the theme here is not “creative jobs” are declining – it’s creative execution jobs are declining while strategic creative leadership jobs are doing OK.</p>



<h2 id="bullet3">3. Corporate compliance and sustainability jobs are declining</h2>



<p>At least 3 of the top 10 declining roles have nothing to do with AI. They’re all regulatory and environmental positions: corporate compliance specialists (-29%), sustainability specialists (-28%), and environmental technicians (-26%).</p>



<p>These declines are even steeper than the creative roles, and they’re accelerating. Corporate compliance specialists dropped 6% in 2024, then 29% in 2025. </p>



<p>And this isn’t just hitting individual contributors. The collapse is happening across the entire hierarchy:</p>



<p><strong>Sustainability roles:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Sustainability specialists: -25%</li>



<li>Project managers (sustainability): -32%</li>



<li>Managers, sustainability: -35%</li>



<li>Directors, sustainability: -31%</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Compliance roles:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Corporate compliance specialists: -28%</li>



<li>Chief compliance officers: -37%</li>
</ul>



<p>What’s happening here? If you live in the US, you probably know what’s happening. Sustainability specialists mostly help companies meet environmental regulations and ESG commitments, both of which became targets this year. Corporate compliance specialists ensure companies follow regulations, but if the government isn’t enforcing them, or even getting rid of some, why pay for compliance staff?</p>



<p>On the opposite side of the coin, <em>trade compliance specialists grew 18%</em> in 2025 (the reason being fairly obvious if you’ve been following tariff news).</p>



<h2 id="bullet4">4. AI might be taking away jobs from medical scribes but it’s too early to tell</h2>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="934" height="578" src="https://bloomberry.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Medical-scribe-jobs-declined-much-more-than-related-healthcare-jobs.png" alt="" srcset="https://bloomberry.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Medical-scribe-jobs-declined-much-more-than-related-healthcare-jobs.png 934w, https://bloomberry.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Medical-scribe-jobs-declined-much-more-than-related-healthcare-jobs-300x186.png 300w, https://bloomberry.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Medical-scribe-jobs-declined-much-more-than-related-healthcare-jobs-768x475.png 768w, https://bloomberry.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Medical-scribe-jobs-declined-much-more-than-related-healthcare-jobs-512x317.png 512w, https://bloomberry.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Medical-scribe-jobs-declined-much-more-than-related-healthcare-jobs-920x569.png 920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 934px) 100vw, 934px"></figure>



<p>Jobs for medical scribes dropped down 20% in 2025. </p>



<p>If we compare scribes to similar healthcare admin roles, we don’t see a similar drop. Medical coders? Basically flat at -0.02%. Medical assistants? Down just 6%, slightly better than the overall market. But scribes are declining at 20%.</p>



<p>The obvious culprit might be AI documentation tools which can now listen to patient conversations and automatically generate clinical notes. Medical scribes do valuable work, but it’s the kind of structured documentation task that AI has gotten better at.</p>



<p>That said, the picture isn’t very crystal clear. That’s because medical scribe jobs just dropped 2% from 2023 to 2024 before this year’s drop. So the cautious side of me says we need one or two more years of data before we know if this is a long-term decline. We’ll put medical scribes on the watchlist for now.</p>



<p id="bullet4b"><em>Now, let’s move on to the jobs with the biggest % increases..</em></p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="885" height="546" src="https://bloomberry.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Jobs-with-the-biggest-increases-in-new-job-postings-from-2024-to-2025-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://bloomberry.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Jobs-with-the-biggest-increases-in-new-job-postings-from-2024-to-2025-1.png 885w, https://bloomberry.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Jobs-with-the-biggest-increases-in-new-job-postings-from-2024-to-2025-1-300x185.png 300w, https://bloomberry.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Jobs-with-the-biggest-increases-in-new-job-postings-from-2024-to-2025-1-768x474.png 768w, https://bloomberry.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Jobs-with-the-biggest-increases-in-new-job-postings-from-2024-to-2025-1-512x316.png 512w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 885px) 100vw, 885px"></figure>



<h2 id="bullet5">5. Machine Learning Engineers were the #1 growing job</h2>



<p>1 job title is absolutely exploding: machine learning engineers saw postings surge 40% from 2024 to 2025 – the single biggest increase of any role. That’s on top of a 78% increase in 2024.</p>



<p>And it’s not just ML engineers. The entire AI infrastructure stack is booming</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="999" height="617" src="https://bloomberry.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AI-Engineering-vs-Non-AI-Engineering-Jobs_-change-in-new-job-postings-from-2024-to-2025.png" alt="" srcset="https://bloomberry.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AI-Engineering-vs-Non-AI-Engineering-Jobs_-change-in-new-job-postings-from-2024-to-2025.png 999w, https://bloomberry.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AI-Engineering-vs-Non-AI-Engineering-Jobs_-change-in-new-job-postings-from-2024-to-2025-300x185.png 300w, https://bloomberry.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AI-Engineering-vs-Non-AI-Engineering-Jobs_-change-in-new-job-postings-from-2024-to-2025-768x474.png 768w, https://bloomberry.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AI-Engineering-vs-Non-AI-Engineering-Jobs_-change-in-new-job-postings-from-2024-to-2025-512x316.png 512w, https://bloomberry.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AI-Engineering-vs-Non-AI-Engineering-Jobs_-change-in-new-job-postings-from-2024-to-2025-920x568.png 920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 999px) 100vw, 999px"></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Robotics engineers</strong>: +11% (AI moving from screens into the physical world)</li>



<li><strong>Research/applied scientists in tech</strong>: +11% (companies building proprietary models, not just using OpenAI’s API)</li>



<li><strong>Data center engineers</strong>: +9% (all that AI inference needs massive compute infrastructure)</li>
</ul>



<p>Companies need researchers to develop models, ML engineers to deploy them, robotics engineers to put them in warehouses and factories, and data center engineers to power the whole operation.</p>



<h2 id="bullet6">6. Demand for senior leadership is much stronger than middle managers + individual contributors</h2>



<p>Here’s the most perverse finding in my data: while the overall job market contracted 8%, senior leadership roles barely declined at all.</p>



<p>Combining Directors, VPs, and C-Suite into ‘Senior Leadership’:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="999" height="617" src="https://bloomberry.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Senior-Leadership-vs-Managers-vs-Individual-Contributors_-change-in-new-job-postings-.png" alt="" srcset="https://bloomberry.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Senior-Leadership-vs-Managers-vs-Individual-Contributors_-change-in-new-job-postings-.png 999w, https://bloomberry.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Senior-Leadership-vs-Managers-vs-Individual-Contributors_-change-in-new-job-postings--300x185.png 300w, https://bloomberry.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Senior-Leadership-vs-Managers-vs-Individual-Contributors_-change-in-new-job-postings--768x474.png 768w, https://bloomberry.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Senior-Leadership-vs-Managers-vs-Individual-Contributors_-change-in-new-job-postings--512x316.png 512w, https://bloomberry.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Senior-Leadership-vs-Managers-vs-Individual-Contributors_-change-in-new-job-postings--920x568.png 920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 999px) 100vw, 999px"></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Senior Leadership</strong>: -1.7% (beating the market by 6.3 percentage points)</li>



<li><strong>Manager roles</strong>: -5.7% (beating the market by 2.3 percentage points, but still worse than leadership)</li>



<li><strong>Individual contributor roles</strong> -9%</li>
</ul>



<p>That’s a 4 percentage point gap between leadership and management. Both are doing better than average, but the higher you go, the better you’re doing.</p>



<p>Among the top 10 fastest-growing job titles, five are director-level or above:</p>



<ul>
<li>Director, Data Engineering: +23%</li>



<li>Director, Real Estate: +21%</li>



<li>Director, Legal: +21%</li>



<li>Director, Software Engineering: +14%</li>



<li>VP, Engineering: +12%</li>
</ul>



<p>What’s happening? It might be that companies are adding strategic leadership while being more selective about operational management. They want more people deciding <em>what</em> to do, fewer people managing <em>how</em> it gets done, and even fewer people to execute on it. <a href="http://google.com/search?sca_esv=cc90a75d2fff157b&amp;sxsrf=AE3TifO8imrzKOQ8kSsoqL6dYhhGWmiSAw:1761583758613&amp;q=Google+getting+rid+of+middle+managers&amp;tbm=nws&amp;source=lnms&amp;fbs=AIIjpHxU7SXXniUZfeShr2fp4giZPH5QghoXViUOqdFyhkUfHhA90f6RZnLvcDKUWyhDavH5940gTgRWqZcPYXMz94JlBZHZtmgnGk05M8XiSDH4LOskkGB0jUixUodGYf1GnMcDDEeZ8Ea9SuSDq4TZCNEPUhc1dGSv8tlYTQvmbqCT0s5wk1Zp1jAHNRpucvM_574vluTKCTY7EBtTxt40TxajG7-O5g&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi9i7Lx6sSQAxVr1fACHWrPCEoQ0pQJegQIFxAB&amp;biw=1414&amp;bih=723&amp;dpr=1.36">Google is a prime example of this, getting rid of most of their middle managers in the past year</a>.</p>



<p>Part of this is AI-enabled. For instance, a director or VP can now use AI coding tools to quickly prototype ideas without needing a team of engineers. The same AI tools that threaten individual contributors are actually <em>empowering</em> senior leadership to operate more independently. A VP of Product who can spin up a working prototype in Cursor or validate a technical approach with Claude doesn’t need as many ICs reporting to them. </p>



<h2 id="bullet7">7. Influencer marketer was 1 of the few growing marketing jobs</h2>



<p>Marketing jobs, as a whole were fairly resilient. Most hovered around the benchmark. But 1 marketing role stood out: influencer marketing specialist roles jumped 18.3% from last year. This isn’t a 1 year blip as well. Influence marketer jobs increased 10% last year, so this is a 2-year pattern.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="923" height="571" src="https://bloomberry.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Marketing-Jobs_-change-in-of-new-job-postings-from-2024-to-2025-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://bloomberry.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Marketing-Jobs_-change-in-of-new-job-postings-from-2024-to-2025-1.png 923w, https://bloomberry.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Marketing-Jobs_-change-in-of-new-job-postings-from-2024-to-2025-1-300x186.png 300w, https://bloomberry.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Marketing-Jobs_-change-in-of-new-job-postings-from-2024-to-2025-1-768x475.png 768w, https://bloomberry.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Marketing-Jobs_-change-in-of-new-job-postings-from-2024-to-2025-1-512x317.png 512w, https://bloomberry.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Marketing-Jobs_-change-in-of-new-job-postings-from-2024-to-2025-1-920x569.png 920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 923px) 100vw, 923px"></figure>



<p>The best explanation? Influencer marketing has gotten really good at proving its worth with sophisticated tracking, attribution modeling, and actual ROI measurement. Brands can see exactly which creator partnerships are driving sales.</p>



<p>But there’s a bigger trend happening, in my opinion, and it’s related to AI. As people flood the internet with AI content, traditional channels are losing what little trust they had left. Search results? Increasingly AI-generated slop. Display ads? Always annoying, now potentially AI-designed. Cold emails? Obviously AI-written and sprayed to a bunch of random strangers. People are developing an immune response to everything in the internet. But a skincare video from a TikTok creator their age? That still feels real and genuine. </p>



<p>I asked 2 of the brightest minds in marketing what they thought of this, and this is what they had to say:</p>



<p><em>“Trust in businesses and advertising continues to erode, but we trust each other — our friends and family members. Influencers are not just young people shilling products. They are viewed as trusted online friends, and that is a powerful voice for brands to connect to and leverage” </em> says Mark Schaefer, Executive Director of <a href="http://www.businessesgrow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Schaefer Marketing Solutions</a>.</p>



<p>I asked <a href="https://sparktoro.com/">Rand Fishkin, founder of Sparktoro</a> to chime in with his thoughts, and he acknowledges how influencer marketing has remain one of the few bright spots left in digital marketing: </p>



<p><em>“Digital marketing jobs have been in a tough spot for a couple years now, with SEO, content, and social being particularly hard hit thanks to the rise of Zero Click Everything (i.e. search engines and social networks substantially curtailing the amount of traffic they send out). One of the few bright spots in all of this has been the rise of Zero Click Marketing (aka influencing people where they pay attention without necessarily trying to draw direct traffic). Little wonder that creator/influencer marketing specialists are one of the few categories that embrace this and are still growing.”</em></p>



<p>Lastly, let’s look at what jobs have been the most resilient:</p>



<h2 id="bullet8">8. Software Engineering Jobs have been resilient in 2025</h2>



<p>While there’s been a lot of talk about AI replacing software engineers, the data has suggested the opposite: the # of software engineering jobs have not changed much since last year.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="740" height="457" src="https://bloomberry.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Software-Engineering-Jobs_-change-in-of-new-job-postings-from-2024-to-2025-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://bloomberry.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Software-Engineering-Jobs_-change-in-of-new-job-postings-from-2024-to-2025-1.png 740w, https://bloomberry.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Software-Engineering-Jobs_-change-in-of-new-job-postings-from-2024-to-2025-1-300x185.png 300w, https://bloomberry.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Software-Engineering-Jobs_-change-in-of-new-job-postings-from-2024-to-2025-1-512x316.png 512w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px"></figure>



<p>Most engineering roles are either growing or hovering near the benchmark. This is happening in a year where GitHub Copilot, OpenAI Codex, Claude Code, and a dozen other <a href="https://bloomberry.com/coding-tools.html">AI coding assistants</a> are supposedly making human programmers obsolete.</p>



<p>The obvious explanation is that AI tools are making engineers <em>more productive</em>, not <em>redundant</em>. When you give a developer Copilot, they don’t become unnecessary – they ship features faster, tackle more complex problems, and spend less time on boilerplate code. </p>



<p>One interesting data point is that frontend engineering jobs have declined the most out of any software engineering job. I can’t help but wonder if it’s because of the influx of vibe coding tools like Replit, Lovable and Bolt.new that have made it super easy to create a front-end for a website or app. I doubt AI is getting rid of sophisticated frontend work (like building a frontend app like Figma), but perhaps it’s having an impact on the less complicated work. </p>



<p>Still, despite all the hype about how AI coding tools will replace software engineers, software engineering is still one of the most secure jobs you can have today, relative to most other white-collar jobs.</p>



<h2 id="bullet9">9. Customer Service Representatives jobs are not being mass replaced by AI as of now</h2>



<p>If there’s one job everyone assumed AI would eliminate, it’s customer service representatives. Yet customer service rep jobs are declining just 4.0% – beating the -8% benchmark despite companies trying to automate customer service with AI.</p>



<p>I’m sure we’ve all heard the stories of companies that make a big deal of implementing AI chatbots and laying off their customer service team. Klarna made headlines by replacing their customer service team with AI, <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/firing-700-humans-ai-klarna-173029838.html">only to hire them back</a>. </p>



<p>Many companies discover chatbots handle simple queries fine but completely fail on anything requiring judgment or empathy. When customers are angry or confused, they want a person who understands their frustration, not a bot going through a script. Good customer service involves empathy and making occasional judgment calls such as waiving fees or issuing a refund.</p>



<p>Plus, I’m sure a lot of companies don’t want <a href="https://techhq.com/news/air-canada-refund-for-customer-who-used-chatbot/">the bad press associated when an AI chatbot promises the wrong thing to a customer</a>.</p>



<h2 id="sales">10. <strong>Sales Jobs Are Holding Steady, But There’s No Clear Pattern</strong></h2>



<p>Sales roles, as a whole, are performing better than the overall market benchmark of -8%. Most sales positions declined only slightly, or even growing:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="633" src="https://bloomberry.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Sales-Jobs_-change-in-new-job-postings-from-2024-to-2025-4-1024x633.png" alt="" srcset="https://bloomberry.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Sales-Jobs_-change-in-new-job-postings-from-2024-to-2025-4-1024x633.png 1024w, https://bloomberry.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Sales-Jobs_-change-in-new-job-postings-from-2024-to-2025-4-300x185.png 300w, https://bloomberry.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Sales-Jobs_-change-in-new-job-postings-from-2024-to-2025-4-768x475.png 768w, https://bloomberry.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Sales-Jobs_-change-in-new-job-postings-from-2024-to-2025-4-512x316.png 512w, https://bloomberry.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Sales-Jobs_-change-in-new-job-postings-from-2024-to-2025-4-920x568.png 920w, https://bloomberry.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Sales-Jobs_-change-in-new-job-postings-from-2024-to-2025-4.png 1031w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>But unlike other categories where we saw clear patterns – like creative execution roles declining while creative leadership held steady – sales jobs don’t follow an obvious hierarchy. It’s a mixed bag at every level.</p>



<p>Individual contributors? Account executives are down -5.9%, but account managers are up +1.6%. Middle management? Sales managers are down -2.6%, but directors of sales are up +2.5%. </p>



<p><strong>Why is Director of Revenue the fastest-growing sales role?</strong></p>



<p>The 10.2% jump in Director of Revenue roles stands out as the only sales position showing significant growth. This role is relatively new – it didn’t really exist a decade ago – and represents a shift in how companies think about growth.</p>



<p>Why the surge now? A few theories:</p>



<p>First, companies are getting more sophisticated about revenue operations. In a tighter economy, you can’t just throw more salespeople at the problem – you need someone optimizing the entire system. Director of Revenue roles often own the data infrastructure, compensation models, territory planning, and tech stack that makes everyone else more efficient.</p>



<p>Second, the rise of product-led growth means revenue doesn’t stop at the initial sale. You need someone thinking about expansion, upsells, retention, and churn – not just new logos. Director of Revenue is the person who owns that holistic view.</p>



<p><strong>The one role that declined the most?</strong></p>



<p>Sales operations specialists at -8.0% – basically matching the overall market. These roles focus on CRM management, analytics, and process optimization. It’s possible AI tools are handling more of this structured, data-heavy work, but with just one year of significant decline, it’s too early to call it a trend.</p>



<p><strong>What about GTM Engineers?</strong></p>



<p>If you talk to people in the sales world, you’ll hear a lot of buzz about “GTM engineers” – technical specialists who use AI tools like <a href="https://bloomberry.com/blog/5-clay-alternatives/">Clay </a>to build sophisticated prospecting systems, automate outreach, and optimize the entire go-to-market stack. These roles didn’t make our threshold due to low job volumes, but if they did, they would’ve been the fastest growing sales-related job, as <a href="https://bloomberry.com/blog/i-analyzed-1000-gtm-engineering-jobs-here-is-what-i-learned/">they grew 205% year-over-year</a>.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>So what should we take away from all this? First, AI isn’t causing huge spikes in unemployment – most jobs in our analysis did not drastically plummet. But it’s insincere to say AI is having zero impact either. It’s impact is selective. It’s hitting some creative work hard, while roles requiring empathy, strategy, or complex problem-solving such as software engineering, creative directors, and customer service remain surprisingly resilient.</p>



<p>Computers graphics artists, writers and photographers could be in secular decline. 2 years is not a lot of data, mind you, but I think the trend so far isn’t very encouraging. However, other creative jobs like graphics designers, product designers and creative directors haven’t decreased that much in demand so far.</p>



<p>Lastly, we’re seeing bifurcation everywhere. Creative work is splitting between strategic roles (holding steady) and execution roles (declining). Marketing is dividing between traditional marketing jobs (shrinking) and influencer marketing jobs(growing). Senior leadership jobs are holding steady, middle managers a bit worse, while individual contributor jobs are the worst performing. Even within tech, backend complexity is valued while frontend work becomes a tad more commoditized. </p>



<p>It’ll be interesting to see if these trends hold beyond 2025 into 2026.</p>



<p id="methodology"><strong>Exact Methodology</strong> (the technical details)</p>



<p>I developed a taxonomy of 650 distinct, normalized job titles (graphics designer, nurse, etc) and used Amazon Mechanical Turk workers to label millions of random job postings taken from <a href="https://revealera.com/">Revealera </a>(a data provider for job postings for financial companies). From this training data, I built a machine learning model that classified all 180 million postings into normalized job titles.</p>



<p>These job postings were global job postings – not just US-centric, and included a variety of companies: large enterprises, SMBs, medium-sized companies, startups, government organizations, and universities, from all types of industries. They were taken directly from company websites, not from an aggregator like Indeed/Linkedin, so there were very few duplicates.</p>



<p>With this dataset, I could identify which specific job titles grew or declined the most in 2025 (January-October) compared to 2024 and 2023 – and theorize whether AI might be a factor.</p>



<p>For those who are into machine learning:</p>



<p>I built a supervised learning pipeline for job title classification using semantic embeddings and ensemble methods.</p>



<p>Architecture:</p>



<ol>
<li>Sentence Transformer Fine-tuning: Uses contrastive learning to fine-tune a sentence transformer model (default: <code>all-mpnet-base-v2</code>) on job description pairs – positive pairs (same job title) and negative pairs (different titles)</li>



<li>Embedding Generation: Generates dense vector representations of job descriptions using the fine-tuned transformer</li>



<li>Multi-class Classification: Trains a Random Forest classifier on top of the embeddings to predict job titles</li>
</ol>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 id="everyone-loves-pgvector-in-theory">Everyone Loves pgvector (in theory)</h2><p>If you’ve spent any time in the vector search space over the past year, you’ve probably read blog posts explaining why pgvector is the obvious choice for your vector database needs. The argument goes something like this: you already have Postgres, vector embeddings are just another data type, why add complexity with a dedicated vector database when you can keep everything in one place?</p><p>It’s a compelling story. And like most of the AI influencer bullshit that fills my timeline, it glosses over the inconvenient details.</p><p>I’m not here to tell you pgvector is bad. It’s not. It’s a useful extension that brings vector similarity search to Postgres. But after spending some time trying to build a production system on top of it, I’ve learned that the gap between “works in a demo” and “scales in production” is… significant.</p><h2 id="nobodys-actually-run-this-in-production">Nobody’s actually run this in production</h2><p>What bothers me most: the majority of content about pgvector reads like it was written by someone who spun up a local Postgres instance, inserted 10,000 vectors, ran a few queries, and called it a day. The posts are optimistic, the benchmarks are clean, and the conclusions are confident.</p><p>They’re also missing about 80% of what you actually need to know.</p><p>I’ve read through &nbsp;<span onclick="openPgvectorModal()">dozens of these posts.</span></p><p>They all cover the same ground: here’s how to install pgvector, here’s how to create a vector column, here’s a simple similarity search query. Some of them even mention that you should probably add an index.</p><p>What they don’t tell you is what happens when you actually try to run this in production.</p><h2 id="picking-an-index-there-are-no-good-options">Picking an index (there are no good options)</h2><p>Let’s start with indexes, because this is where the tradeoffs start.</p><p>pgvector gives you two index types: IVFFlat and HNSW. The blog posts will tell you that HNSW is newer and generally better, which is… technically true but deeply unhelpful.</p><h3 id="ivfflat">IVFFlat</h3><p>IVFFlat (Inverted File with Flat quantization) partitions your vector space into clusters. During search, it identifies the nearest clusters and only searches within those.</p><p>The good:</p><ul><li>Lower memory footprint during index creation</li><li>Reasonable query performance for many use cases</li><li>Index creation is faster than HNSW</li></ul><p>The bad:</p><ul><li>Requires you to specify the number of lists (clusters) upfront</li><li>That number significantly impacts both recall and query performance</li><li>The commonly recommended formula (<code>rows / 1000</code>) is a starting point at best</li><li>Recall can be… disappointing depending on your data distribution</li><li>New vectors get assigned to existing clusters, but clusters don’t rebalance without a full rebuild</li></ul><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://alex-jacobs.com/posts/the-case-against-pgvector/img_1.png" type="" alt="img_1.png">

<em>Image source: <a href="https://unfoldai.com/ivfflat-vs-hnsw/">IVFFlat or HNSW index for similarity search?</a> by Simeon Emanuilov</em></p><p>None of the blogs mention that building an HNSW index on a few million vectors can consume 10+ GB of RAM or more (depending on your vector dimensions and dataset size). On your production database. While it’s running. For potentially hours.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://alex-jacobs.com/posts/the-case-against-pgvector/img_6.png" type="" alt="img_6.png"></p><h2 id="real-time-search-is-basically-impossible">Real-time search is basically impossible</h2><p>In a typical application, you want newly uploaded data to be searchable immediately. User uploads a document, you generate embeddings, insert them into your database, and they should be available in search results. Simple, right?</p><h3 id="how-index-updates-actually-work">How index updates actually work</h3><p>When you insert new vectors into a table with an index, one of two things happens:</p><ol><li><p><strong>IVFFlat</strong>: The new vectors are inserted into the appropriate clusters based on the existing structure. This works, but it means your cluster distribution gets increasingly suboptimal over time. The solution is to rebuild the index periodically. Which means downtime, or maintaining a separate index and doing an atomic swap, or accepting degraded search quality.</p></li><li><p><strong>HNSW</strong>: New vectors are added to the graph structure. This is better than IVFFlat, but it’s not free. Each insertion requires updating the graph, which means memory allocation, graph traversals, and potential lock contention.</p></li></ol><p>Neither of these is a deal-breaker in isolation. But here’s what happens in practice: you’re inserting vectors continuously throughout the day. Each insertion is individually cheap, but the aggregate load adds up. Your database is now handling your normal transactional workload, analytical queries, AND maintaining graph structures in memory for vector search.</p><h3 id="handling-new-inserts">Handling new inserts</h3><p>Let’s say you’re building a document search system. Users upload PDFs, you extract text, generate embeddings, and insert them. The user expects to immediately search for that document.</p><p>Here’s what actually happens:</p><p><strong>With no index</strong>: The insert is fast, the document is immediately available, but your searches do a full sequential scan. This works fine for a few thousand documents. At a few hundred thousand? Your searches start taking seconds. Millions? Good luck.</p><p><strong>With IVFFlat</strong>: The insert is still relatively fast. The vector gets assigned to a cluster. But whoops, a problem. Those initial cluster assignments were based on the data distribution when you built the index. As you add more data, especially if it’s not uniformly distributed, some clusters get overloaded. Your search quality degrades. You rebuild the index periodically to fix this, but during the rebuild (which can take hours for large datasets), what do you do with new inserts? Queue them? Write to a separate unindexed table and merge later?</p><p><strong>With HNSW</strong>: The graph gets updated on each insert through incremental insertion, which sounds great. But updating an HNSW graph isn’t free—you’re traversing the graph to find the right place to insert the new node and updating connections. Each insert acquires locks on the graph structure. Under heavy write load, this becomes a bottleneck. And if your write rate is high enough, you start seeing lock contention that slows down both writes and reads.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://alex-jacobs.com/posts/the-case-against-pgvector/img_3.jpg" type="" alt="img_3.jpg"></p><h3 id="the-operational-reality">The operational reality</h3><p>Here’s the real nightmare: you’re not just storing vectors. You have metadata—document titles, timestamps, user IDs, categories, etc. That metadata lives in other tables (or other columns in the same table). You need that metadata and the vectors to stay in sync.</p><p>In a normal Postgres table, this is easy—transactions handle it. But when you’re dealing with index builds that take hours, keeping everything consistent gets complicated. For IVFFlat, periodic rebuilds are basically required to maintain search quality. For HNSW, you might need to rebuild if you want to tune parameters or if performance has degraded.</p><p>The problem is that index builds are memory-intensive operations, and Postgres doesn’t have a great way to throttle them. You’re essentially asking your production database to allocate multiple (possibly dozens) gigabytes of RAM for an operation that might take hours, while continuing to serve queries.</p><p>You end up with strategies like:</p><ul><li>Write to a staging table, build the index offline, then swap it in (but now you have a window where searches miss new data)</li><li>Maintain two indexes and write to both (double the memory, double the update cost)</li><li>Build indexes on replicas and promote them</li><li>Accept eventual consistency (users upload documents that aren’t searchable for N minutes)</li><li>Provision significantly more RAM than your “working set” would suggest</li></ul><p>None of these are “wrong” exactly. But they’re all workarounds for the fact that pgvector wasn’t really designed for high-velocity real-time ingestion.</p><h2 id="pre--vs-post-filtering-or-why-you-need-to-become-a-query-planner-expert">Pre- vs. Post-Filtering (or: why you need to become a query planner expert)</h2><p>Okay but let’s say you solve your index and insert problems. Now you have a document search system with millions of vectors. Documents have metadata—maybe they’re marked as <code>draft</code>, <code>published</code>, or <code>archived</code>. A user searches for something, and you only want to return published documents.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sql"><span><span>1</span><span><span>SELECT</span><span> </span><span>*</span><span> </span><span>FROM</span><span> </span><span>documents</span><span>
</span></span></span><span><span>2</span><span><span></span><span>WHERE</span><span> </span><span>status</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>'published'</span><span>

</span></span></span><span><span>4</span><span><span></span><span>LIMIT</span><span> </span><span>10</span><span>;</span><span>
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>Simple enough. But now you have a problem: should Postgres filter on status first (pre-filter) or do the vector search first and then filter (post-filter)?</p><p>This seems like an implementation detail. It’s not. It’s the difference between queries that take 50ms and queries that take 5 seconds. It’s also the difference between returning the most relevant results and… not.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://alex-jacobs.com/posts/the-case-against-pgvector/img_4.jpg" type="" alt="img_4.jpg"></p><p><strong>Pre-filter</strong> works great when the filter is highly selective (1,000 docs out of 10M). It works terribly when the filter isn’t selective—you’re still searching millions of vectors.</p><p><strong>Post-filter</strong> works when your filter is permissive. Here’s where it breaks: imagine you ask for 10 results with <code>LIMIT 10</code>. pgvector finds the 10 nearest neighbors, then applies your filter. Only 3 of those 10 are published. You get 3 results back, even though there might be hundreds of relevant published documents slightly further away in the embedding space.</p><p>The user searched, got 3 mediocre results, and has no idea they’re missing way better matches that didn’t make it into the initial k=10 search.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://alex-jacobs.com/posts/the-case-against-pgvector/img_5.png" type="" alt="img_5.png"></p><p>You can work around this by fetching more vectors (say, <code>LIMIT 100</code>) and then filtering, but now:</p><ul><li>You’re doing way more distance calculations than needed</li><li>You still don’t know if 100 is enough</li><li>Your query performance suffers</li><li>You’re guessing at the right oversampling factor</li></ul><p>With pre-filter, you avoid this problem, but you get the performance problems I mentioned. Pick your poison.</p><h3 id="multiple-filters">Multiple filters</h3><p>Now add another dimension: you’re filtering by user_id AND category AND date_range.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sql"><span><span>1</span><span><span>SELECT</span><span> </span><span>*</span><span> </span><span>FROM</span><span> </span><span>documents</span><span>
</span></span></span><span><span>2</span><span><span></span><span>WHERE</span><span> </span><span>user_id</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>'user123'</span><span>

</span></span></span><span><span>6</span><span><span></span><span>LIMIT</span><span> </span><span>10</span><span>;</span><span>
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>What’s the right strategy now?</p><ul><li>Apply all filters first, then search? (Pre-filter)</li><li>Search first, then apply all filters? (Post-filter)</li><li>Apply some filters first, search, then apply remaining filters? (Hybrid)</li><li>Which filters should you apply in which order?</li></ul><p>The planner will look at table statistics, index selectivity, and estimated row counts and come up with a plan. That plan will probably be wrong, or at least suboptimal, because the planner’s cost model wasn’t built for vector similarity search.</p><p>And it gets worse: you’re inserting new vectors throughout the day. Your index statistics are outdated. The plans get increasingly suboptimal until you ANALYZE the table. But ANALYZE on a large table with millions of rows takes time and resources. And it doesn’t really understand vector data distribution in a meaningful way—it can tell you how many rows match <code>user_id = 'user123'</code>, but not how clustered those vectors are in the embedding space, which is what actually matters for search performance.</p><h3 id="workarounds">Workarounds</h3><p>You end up with hacks: query rewriting for different user types, partitioning your data into separate tables, CTE optimization fences to force the planner’s hand, or just fetching way more results than needed and filtering in application code.</p><p>None of these are sustainable at scale.</p><h3 id="what-vector-databases-do">What vector databases do</h3><p>Dedicated vector databases have solved this. They understand the cost model of filtered vector search and make intelligent decisions:</p><ul><li><strong>Adaptive strategies</strong>: Some databases dynamically choose pre-filter or post-filter based on estimated selectivity</li><li><strong>Configurable modes</strong>: Others let you specify the strategy explicitly when you know your data distribution</li><li><strong>Specialized indexes</strong>: Some build indexes that support efficient filtered search (like filtered HNSW)</li><li><strong>Query optimization</strong>: They track statistics specific to vector operations and optimize accordingly</li></ul><p>OpenSearch’s k-NN plugin, for example, lets you specify pre-filter or post-filter behavior. Pinecone automatically handles filter selectivity. Weaviate has optimizations for common filter patterns.</p><p>With pgvector, you get to build all of this yourself. Or live with suboptimal queries. Or hire a Postgres expert to spend weeks tuning your query patterns.</p><h2 id="hybrid-search-build-it-yourself">Hybrid search? Build it yourself</h2><p>Oh, and if you want hybrid search—combining vector similarity with traditional full-text search—you get to build that yourself too.</p><p>Postgres has excellent full-text search capabilities. pgvector has excellent vector search capabilities. Combining them in a meaningful way? That’s on you.</p><p>You need to:</p><ul><li>Decide how to weight vector similarity vs. text relevance</li><li>Normalize scores from two different scoring systems</li><li>Tune the balance for your use case</li><li>Probably implement Reciprocal Rank Fusion or something similar</li></ul><p>Again, not impossible. Just another thing that many dedicated vector databases provide out of the box.</p><h2 id="pgvectorscale-it-doesnt-solve-everything">pgvectorscale (it doesn’t solve everything)</h2><p>Timescale has released <a href="https://github.com/timescale/pgvectorscale">pgvectorscale</a>, which addresses some of these issues. It adds:</p><ul><li>StreamingDiskANN, a new search backend that’s more memory-efficient</li><li>Better support for incremental index builds</li><li>Improved filtering performance</li></ul><p>This is great! It’s also an admission that pgvector out of the box isn’t sufficient for production use cases.</p><p>pgvectorscale is still relatively new, and adopting it means adding another dependency, another extension, another thing to manage and upgrade. For some teams, that’s fine. For others, it’s just more evidence that maybe the “keep it simple, use Postgres” argument isn’t as simple as it seemed.</p><p>Oh, and if you’re running on RDS, pgvectorscale isn’t available. AWS doesn’t support it. So enjoy managing your own Postgres instance if you want these improvements, or just… keep dealing with the limitations of vanilla pgvector.</p><p>The “just use Postgres” simplicity keeps getting simpler.</p><h2 id="just-use-a-real-vector-database">Just use a real vector database</h2><p>I get the appeal of pgvector. Consolidating your stack is good. Reducing operational complexity is good. Not having to manage another database is good.</p><p>But here’s what I’ve learned: for most teams, especially small teams, dedicated vector databases are actually simpler.</p><h3 id="what-you-actually-get">What you actually get</h3><p>With a managed vector database (Pinecone, Weaviate, Turbopuffer, etc.), you typically get:</p><ul><li>Intelligent query planning for filtered searches</li><li>Hybrid search built in</li><li>Real-time indexing without memory spikes</li><li>Horizontal scaling without complexity</li><li>Monitoring and observability designed for vector workloads</li></ul><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://alex-jacobs.com/posts/the-case-against-pgvector/img_7.jpg" type="" alt="img_7.jpg"></p><h3 id="its-probably-cheaper-than-you-think">It’s probably cheaper than you think</h3><p>Yes, it’s another service to pay for. But compare:</p><ul><li>The cost of a managed vector database for your workload</li><li>vs. the cost of over-provisioning your Postgres instance to handle index builds</li><li>vs. the engineering time to tune queries and manage index rebuilds</li><li>vs. the opportunity cost of not building features because you’re fighting your database</li></ul><p>Turbopuffer starts at $64 month with generous limits.</p><p>For a lot of teams, the managed service is actually cheaper.</p><h2 id="what-i-wish-someone-had-told-me">What I wish someone had told me</h2><p>pgvector is an impressive piece of technology. It brings vector search to Postgres in a way that’s technically sound and genuinely useful for many applications.</p><p>But it’s not a panacea. Understand the tradeoffs.</p><p>If you’re building a production vector search system:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Index management is hard</strong>. Rebuilds are memory-intensive, time-consuming, and disruptive. Plan for this from day one.</p></li><li><p><strong>Query planning matters</strong>. Filtered vector search is a different beast than traditional queries, and Postgres’s planner wasn’t built for this.</p></li><li><p><strong>Real-time indexing has costs</strong>. Either in memory, in search quality, or in engineering time to manage it.</p></li><li><p><strong>The blog posts are lying to you</strong> (by omission). They’re showing you the happy path and ignoring the operational reality.</p></li><li><p><strong>Managed offerings exist for a reason</strong>. There’s a reason that Pinecone, Weaviate, Qdrant, and others exist and are thriving. Vector search at scale has unique challenges that general-purpose databases weren’t designed to handle.</p></li></ol><p>The question isn’t “should I use pgvector?” It’s “am I willing to take on the operational complexity of running vector search in Postgres?”</p><p>For some teams, the answer is yes. You have database expertise, you need the tight integration, you’re willing to invest the time.</p><p>For many teams—maybe most teams—the answer is probably no. Use a tool designed for the job. Your future self will thank you.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>I don’t want to recall the countless number of times I’ve been deceived by “Update and shut down.” When it’s 11 PM and I’ve to go to work the next morning, but there’s a pending Windows Update. I’d select <strong>Update and shut down</strong>, and go to bed, but the next morning, Windows would be on the login screen if its battery didn’t drain out.</p>

<p>Because those update options sit side by side, you might assume you hit “Update and restart” instead of “Update and shut down,” which would explain the return to the login screen. But no, it was a Windows bug all along, and you’re not alone if you can’t trust the ‘Update and Shut Down’ button.</p>
<p>We don’t know what actually causes “Update and shut down” to restart Windows. But Microsoft confirmed that the October 2025 optional update (<a href="https://www.windowslatest.com/2025/10/29/windows-11-kb5067036-25h2-adds-new-start-ui-direct-download-links-msu/">KB5067036</a>) finally fixed an underlying issue that blocked “Update and shut down” from working in some cases.</p>
<p>“Addressed underlying issue which can cause ‘Update and shutdown’ to not actually shut down your PC after updating,” Microsoft <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/october-28-2025-kb5067036-os-builds-26200-7019-and-26100-7019-preview-ec3da7dc-63ba-4b1d-ac41-cf2494d2123a#" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noted</a> in a support document.</p>
<p>Microsoft told Windows Latest that it’ll ship a fix for Update &amp; Shut down with the November 11 Patch Tuesday, so the optional update (KB5067036) is not a requirement.</p>
<h2>Why “Update and shut down” was broken in Windows 11 and Windows 10</h2>
<p>Microsoft won’t tell us what really happened, but there’s a chance it was a race condition or an issue with the Windows Servicing Stack.</p>
<p>When you use Update and shut down, Windows has two tasks to perform. First, it’ll begin installing all pending updates. Second, it’ll power off the computer at the end of the process, but the catch is that the process isn’t just about “install update and turn off.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.windowslatest.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Working-on-updates.jpg" alt="Working on updates" width="1683" height="1062" srcset="https://www.windowslatest.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Working-on-updates.jpg 1683w, https://www.windowslatest.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Working-on-updates-300x189.jpg 300w, https://www.windowslatest.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Working-on-updates-1024x646.jpg 1024w, https://www.windowslatest.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Working-on-updates-768x485.jpg 768w, https://www.windowslatest.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Working-on-updates-1536x969.jpg 1536w, https://www.windowslatest.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Working-on-updates-696x439.jpg 696w, https://www.windowslatest.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Working-on-updates-1068x674.jpg 1068w, https://www.windowslatest.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Working-on-updates-666x420.jpg 666w" sizes="(max-width: 1683px) 100vw, 1683px"></p>
<p>Windows can’t skip a reboot just because you told it to shut down after updating. It must reboot into an offline servicing phase, which is when you see “working on updates” on your screen. This step is required because Windows cannot finish replacing files when it’s running.</p>
<p>After the “working on updates” phase, Windows is supposed to finally power off, but it doesn’t, and Windows boots to the login screen. The issue was most likely with the Servicing Stack, and the “power off” task is never carried across Windows reboots. It’s either cleared or a race condition, like Fast Startup, that blocks it.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>








<p>UK-based YASA has just built a tiny electric motor that makes Tesla motors look like slackers, and this invention could potentially reshape the future of EVs.</p>



<p>The company has unveiled a new prototype that’s breaking records for power and performance density.</p>



<p>It’s smaller and lighter than traditional motors, yet it’s somehow more powerful.</p>



<p>Perhaps the best part is that it’s a fully functional motor, rather than some lab-only concept.</p>



<p><strong><a href="https://sbxcars.com/?utm_source=supercarblondie.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=article-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SBX CARS</a>&nbsp;– View live supercar auctions powered by Supercar Blondie</strong></p>



<h2>This tiny electric motor can produce more than 1,000 horsepower</h2>



<p>The new YASA axial flux motor weighs just 28 pounds, or about the same as a small dog. </p>



<figure>
<figure><a href="https://supercarblondie.com/wp-content/uploads/YASA-tiny-electric-motor.webp" data-lightbox="159709" data-title="YASA"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="100%" height="200" data-id="159720" src="https://supercarblondie.com/wp-content/uploads/YASA-tiny-electric-motor-1024x640.webp" alt="Tiny electric motor is as powerful as four Tesla motors put together and outperforms record holder by 40%" srcset="https://supercarblondie.com/wp-content/uploads/YASA-tiny-electric-motor-1024x640.webp 1024w, https://supercarblondie.com/wp-content/uploads/YASA-tiny-electric-motor-500x313.webp 500w, https://supercarblondie.com/wp-content/uploads/YASA-tiny-electric-motor-768x480.webp 768w, https://supercarblondie.com/wp-content/uploads/YASA-tiny-electric-motor.webp 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><figcaption>YASA</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>However, it delivers a jaw-dropping 750 kilowatts of power, <a href="https://supercarblondie.com/hennessey-unveils-cadillac-le-monstre-1950s-cadillac-tribute-to-le-mans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">which is the equivalent of 1,005 horsepower</a>. </p>



<p>That’s about the same as two <a href="https://supercarblondie.com/bmw-m8-drag-race-tesla-model-3-performance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">Tesla Model 3 Performance cars</a> combined, or four individual Tesla motors.</p>



<p>In comparison, the previous record holder, which was also produced by the same company, weighed 28.8 pounds, and achieved a peak power of 550 kilowatts (737 horsepower).</p>



<p>This makes the current electric motor 40 percent better than the previous edition.</p>



<p>It can also sustain between 350 and 400 kilowatts (469–536 horsepower) continuously, meaning it’s not just built for short bursts, as it can deliver massive power all day long.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://yasa.com/news/yasa-smashes-own-unofficial-power-density-world-record-pushing-state-of-the-art-electric-motor-to-staggering-new-59kw-kg-benchmark/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title="">YASA</a>, this is achieved without using exotic or expensive materials, so the design could actually be scalable once the demand kicks in.</p>



<p>“This record demonstrates what makes YASA unique,” said CEO Joerg Miska. </p>



<p>“With three times the performance density of today’s leading radial flux motors, we’re redefining what’s possible in electric motor design.”</p>



<p>In simpler terms, the company has made a motor that is small, light, and ridiculously powerful.</p>

<h2>YASA already produces motors for many expensive cars</h2>



<p>That’s a big deal for <a href="https://supercarblondie.com/cars/ev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">EVs</a>. </p>



<p>A lighter motor means a lighter car, which means better efficiency, faster acceleration, and longer range from the same battery.</p>



<p>For EVs, every pound matters, so saving weight without compromising performance could be a gamechanger.</p>



<p>YASA, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of <a href="https://supercarblondie.com/cars/manufacturers/mercedes-benz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">Mercedes-Benz</a>, already produces motors that power some of the world’s fastest and most expensive cars. </p>



<p>These include <a href="https://supercarblondie.com/first-ever-look-at-mercedes-amg-gtxx-concept/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">the Mercedes-AMG GT XX concept</a>, and <a href="https://supercarblondie.com/ferrari-296-gtb-representing-gulf-nation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">the Ferrari 296 GTB</a>.</p>

<p>Perhaps as production scales and prices drop, these ultra-efficient motors could find their way into <a href="https://supercarblondie.com/new-303-mile-nissan-leaf-ev-becomes-the-cheapest-ev-in-the-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">everyday EVs</a>, like the Nissan Leaf EV, which is the cheapest EV in the US.</p>



<p>For now, the company’s tiny electric motor proves that big things can come in small packages, and that performance need not be sacrificed.</p>

individuals described by them as being from China's National Security Service who demanded the research being  done in Sheffield be halted.</p><p>And access to the university's websites from China was blocked, impeding its ability to recruit Chinese students, in a campaign of threats and intimidation lasting more than two years.</p><p>In an internal email from July 2024, university officials said "attempting to retain the business in China and publication of the research are now untenable bedfellows".</p><p>When the UK government learned of the case, the then Foreign Secretary David Lammy issued a warning to his Chinese counterpart that it would not tolerate attempts to suppress academic freedoms at UK universities, the BBC understands.</p><p>The issue was also raised with China's most

suit against the university, Sheffield Hallam decided not to publish a final piece of research by Prof Murphy and her team into forced labour.</p><p>And in early 2025, university administrators told her that she could "not continue with her research into supply chains and forced labour in China".</p><p>She initiated legal action against the university for failing in its duty to protect her academic freedom and she submitted a "subject access request" demanding Sheffield Hallam hand over any relevant internal documents.</p><p>The documents she obtained showed the university "had negotiated directly with a foreign intelligence service to trade my academic freedom for access to the Chinese student market," she told the BBC.</p><p>She added: "I'd never seen anything quite so

Well done Laura!"</p><p>Over the following months her unit published four reports, including into car parts and cotton for clothing, trying to trace supply chains and highlight where goods reaching western consumers may have been produced with inputs made with forced labour in Xinjiang.</p><p>China denies such practices occur.</p><p>The Chinese Embassy in London told the BBC "the Helena Kennedy Centre at the Sheffield Hallam University has released multiple fake reports on Xinjiang that are seriously flawed".</p><p>"It has been revealed that some authors of these reports received funding from certain US agencies," the Embassy added.</p><p>Prof Murphy told the BBC she has received funding over the course of her career from the US National Endowment for Humanities for work on slave narratives, the US Department of Justice for work on human trafficking in New Orleans, and more recently from USAID, the US State Department and the UK Foreign Office for her work on China.</p><p>The Chinese Embassy said the allegations of "forced labor" in her reports "cannot withstand basic fact-check".</p><p>"While presenting itself as an academic body, the Centre has in practice acted as a vehicle for politicised and disinformation-driven narratives deployed by anti-China forces," the embassy added.</p><p>The university realised it was coming in for criticism from China as far back as 2022.</p><p>An internal university email from August of that year, seen by the BBC, said China's foreign ministry had issued a statement "denouncing us as being in the 'disreputable vanguard of anti-China rhetoric'".</p><p>The email said the university had admitted 500 Chinese students in 2018, but numbers had collapsed in the pandemic and had not bounced back like it had in other markets. </p><p>It expressed concern that the Chinese government's criticisms could result in a "boycott" by prospective students and recruitment agents. </p><p>In total, the documents show Sheffield had earned £3.8m in 2021/22 from China and Hong Kong.</p><p>Later in August 2022 the university's English language testing website used by Chinese students to take tests before coming to Sheffield had been "shut down in China temporarily".</p><p>Over the next two years the pressure escalated dramatically leading university officials to write in an email in May 2024 that "the continuation of the university's scholarly activity with and in China and Hong Kong has been placed at risk because of the research activities, led by Professor Laura Murphy, in relation to alleged persecution of Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang, China".</p><p>An internal "risk summary," dated 9 December 2024, detailed what had happened.</p><p>In August 2022, China had blocked access to the university's websites. All email communication from and to the university was disabled.</p><p>It meant students in China due to study at Sheffield Hallam were unable to access the enrolment website, arrange their welcome or airport pick up in the UK, or course information.</p><p>The university said this had "undoubtedly had a negative impact on recruitment" in 23/24, with "anticipated further decline in 24/25".</p><p>And, in 2024, the intimidation began.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>"Things in Beijing have kicked off," an internal email from 18 April 2024 said.</p><p>The risk summary detailed that "three officers of the National Security Service" visited Sheffield Hallam's office in China.</p><p>A local staff member was "questioned for two hours regarding the HKC research and future publications. </p><p>"The tone was threatening and message to cease the research activity was made clear."</p><p>At another visit, security officers said the internet issues were because the Uyghur research was available on the university website.</p><p>Finally, in September 2024, the document states "a decision by the university not to publish a final phase of the research on forced labour in China was communicated to the National Security Service .. immediately relations improved and the threat to staff wellbeing appears to be removed".</p><p>Sheffield Hallam says these internal communications need to be seen in context and do not represent university policy.</p><p>Complicating things for Sheffield Hallam had been a report by its Forced Labour Lab published December 2023 into clothing supply chains connected to Xinjiang.</p><p>Smart Shirts Ltd, a Hong Kong supplier of garments with customers in the UK, brought a claim for libel, alleging it had been defamed as its name was included.</p><p>A preliminary ruling at the High Court in London in December 2024 found that report had been "defamatory".</p><p>A full trial in that case is yet to take place at which Sheffield Hallam will be able to put forward its defence to the company's claim, but the university was told by its insurers that "any defamation, libel or slander" claims linked to its entire Social and Economic Research Institute were no longer covered.</p><p>Professor Murphy had, meanwhile, built an international profile.</p></div><figure><div data-component="image-block"><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251021-134202-667692b2c6-web-2.32.2-1/grey-placeholder.png" aria-label="image unavailable"><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/a4f2/live/ed9f3490-b678-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/a4f2/live/ed9f3490-b678-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a4f2/live/ed9f3490-b678-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/a4f2/live/ed9f3490-b678-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/a4f2/live/ed9f3490-b678-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/a4f2/live/ed9f3490-b678-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/a4f2/live/ed9f3490-b678-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a4f2/live/ed9f3490-b678-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="UK Parliament Baroness Helena Kennedy KC in a purple jacket with a fur collar against a neutral grey backdrop"><span>UK Parliament</span></p></div><p data-component="caption-block"><figcaption>Baroness Kennedy says UK universities are vulnerable to pressure from China</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component="text-block"><p>Her work had been cited in the UK parliament, in Canada and in Australia.

As a Ph.D. in neuroscience and a neurosurgeon, you think about these things.”</p><p><strong>What do the findings tell us?</strong></p><p>“You could probably categorize it in in three different categories to say what can we take from this,” Zemmar said. “One is scientific, one is metaphysical and philosophical and one is spiritual.</p><p><span>“Scientifically, it's very difficult to interpret the data because the brain had suffered bleeding, seizures, swelling – and then it's just one case. So we can't make very big assumptions and claims based on this case.</span></p><p><span>“On the metaphysical side, if you have these things, it is intriguing to speculate to say that these mechanisms – these brain activity patterns that occur when we have memory recall and dreaming and meditative states – they recall just before we go to die. So maybe they're letting us have a replay of life in the last seconds when we die.</span></p><p><span>“On the spiritual side, I think it is somewhat calming. I face this at times when you have patients that pass away and you talk their families; you have to be the bearer of bad news. Right now, we don't know anything about what happens to their loved one’s brain when they're dying. I think if we know that there is something happening in their brain, that they are remembering nice moments, we can tell these families and it builds a feeling of warmth that in that moment when they are falling, this can help a little bit to catch them.</span></p><p><span>“It opens an interesting question to me on when you define death. That plays a big role for questions such as, when do you go ahead with organ donation? When are we dead? When the heart stops beating because the brain keeps going. Should we record EEG activity in addition to EKG to declare death? This is a very, very interesting question for me. When is exactly the time when we die? We may have tapped the door open now to start a discussion about that exact time onset.”</span></p></div></div>]]></description>

    <p>Thought you would be interested to know that Marius Gerbershagen has used
ecl to compile Maxima to wasm to run in a browser.  I believe it's a pretty
complete implementation with fancy TeX display of formulas and nice
graphics via gnuplot compiled to wasm.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-oxy/">https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-oxy/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45795511">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post"><article><p>2023-03-02</p><section><p>10 min read</p><img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/PBSyqFHas7ImWMdl4kWb1/1fc2829eceb9baff576b0ec6f2f105b8/introducing-oxy.png" alt=""><div><p>In this blog post, we are proud to introduce Oxy - our modern proxy framework, developed using the Rust programming language. Oxy is a foundation of several Cloudflare projects, including the <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/gateway/">Zero Trust Gateway</a>, the iCloud Private Relay <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/icloud-private-relay/">second hop proxy</a>, and the internal <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-servers-dont-own-ips-anymore/">egress routing service</a>.</p><p>Oxy leverages our years of experience building high-load proxies to implement the latest communication protocols, enabling us to effortlessly build sophisticated services that can accommodate massive amounts of daily traffic.</p><p>We will be exploring Oxy in greater detail in upcoming technical blog posts, providing a comprehensive and in-depth look at its capabilities and potential applications. For now, let us embark on this journey and discover what Oxy is and how we built it.</p>
    <p>
      <h2 id="what-oxy-does">What Oxy does</h2>
      
    </p>
    <p>We refer to Oxy as our "next-generation proxy framework". But what do we really mean by “proxy framework”? Picture a server (like NGINX, that reader might be familiar with) that can proxy traffic with an array of protocols, including various predefined common traffic flow scenarios that enable you to route traffic to specific destinations or even egress with a different protocol than the one used for ingress. This server can be configured in many ways for specific flows and boasts tight integration with the surrounding infrastructure, whether telemetry consumers or networking services.</p><p>Now, take all of that and add in the ability to programmatically control every aspect of the proxying: protocol decapsulation, traffic analysis, routing, tunneling logic, DNS resolution, and so much more. And this is what Oxy proxy framework is: a feature-rich proxy server tightly integrated with our internal infrastructure that's customizable to meet application requirements, allowing engineers to tweak every component.</p><p>This design is in line with our belief in an iterative approach to development, where a basic solution is built first and then gradually improved over time. With Oxy, you can start with a basic solution that can be deployed to our servers and then add additional features as needed, taking advantage of the many extensibility points offered by Oxy. In fact, you can avoid writing any code, besides a few lines of bootstrap boilerplate and get a production-ready server with a wide variety of startup configuration options and traffic flow scenarios.</p>
            <figure>
            
            <img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5nk7Ri6viC85BdWoRSiB9v/f40a9971fdad71cb07ee0b3aebf99fd9/image3-2.png" alt="High-level Oxy architecture" width="1999" height="1478" loading="lazy">
            
            </figure><p><i>High-level Oxy architecture</i></p><p>For example, suppose you'd like to implement an HTTP firewall. With Oxy, you can proxy HTTP(S) requests right out of the box, eliminating the need to write any code related to production services, such as request metrics and logs. You simply need to implement an Oxy hook handler for HTTP requests and responses. If you've used <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/examples/respond-with-another-site/">Cloudflare Workers</a> before, then you should be familiar with this extensibility model.</p><p>Similarly, you can implement a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model">layer 4</a> firewall by providing application hooks that handle ingress and egress connections. This goes beyond a simple block/accept scenario, as you can build authentication functionality or a traffic router that sends traffic to different destinations based on the geographical information of the ingress connection. The capabilities are incredibly rich, and we've made the extensibility model as ergonomic and flexible as possible. As an example, if information obtained from layer 4 is insufficient to make an informed firewall decision, the app can simply ask Oxy to decapsulate the traffic and process it with HTTP firewall.</p><p>The aforementioned scenarios are prevalent in many products we build at Cloudflare, so having a foundation that incorporates ready solutions is incredibly useful. This foundation has absorbed lots of experience we've gained over the years, taking care of many sharp and dark corners of high-load service programming. As a result, application implementers can stay focused on the business logic of their application with Oxy taking care of the rest. In fact, we've been able to create a few privacy proxy applications using Oxy that now serve massive amounts of traffic in production with less than a couple of hundred lines of code. This is something that would have taken multiple orders of magnitude more time and lines of code before.</p><p>As previously mentioned, we'll dive deeper into the technical aspects in future blog posts. However, for now, we'd like to provide a brief overview of Oxy's capabilities. This will give you a glimpse of the many ways in which Oxy can be customized and used.</p>
    <p>
      <h3 id="on-ramps">On-ramps</h3>
      
    </p>
    <p>On-ramp defines a combination of transport layer socket type and protocols that server listeners can use for ingress traffic.</p><p>Oxy supports a wide variety of traffic on-ramps:</p><ul><li><p>HTTP 1/2/3 (including various CONNECT protocols for layer 3 and 4 traffic)</p></li><li><p>TCP and UDP traffic over Proxy Protocol</p></li><li><p>general purpose IP traffic, including ICMP</p></li></ul><p>With Oxy, you have the ability to analyze and manipulate traffic at multiple layers of the OSI model - from layer 3 to layer 7. This allows for a wide range of possibilities in terms of how you handle incoming traffic.</p><p>One of the most notable and powerful features of Oxy is the ability for applications to force decapsulation. This means that an application can analyze traffic at a higher level, even if it originally arrived at a lower level. For example, if an application receives IP traffic, it can choose to analyze the UDP traffic encapsulated within the IP packets. With just a few lines of code, the application can tell Oxy to upgrade the IP flow to a UDP tunnel, effectively allowing the same code to be used for different on-ramps.</p><p>The application can even go further and ask Oxy to sniff UDP packets and check if they contain <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/performance/what-is-http3/">HTTP/3 traffic</a>. In this case, Oxy can upgrade the UDP traffic to HTTP and handle HTTP/3 requests that were originally received as raw IP packets. This allows for the simultaneous processing of traffic at all three layers (L3, L4, L7), enabling applications to analyze, filter, and manipulate the traffic flow from multiple perspectives. This provides a robust toolset for developing advanced traffic processing applications.</p>

            </figure><p><i>Multi-layer traffic processing in Oxy applications</i></p>
    <p>
      <h3 id="off-ramps">Off-ramps</h3>
      
    </p>
    <p>Off-ramp defines a combination of transport layer socket type and protocols that proxy server connectors can use for egress traffic.</p><p>Oxy offers versatility in its egress methods, supporting a range of protocols including HTTP 1 and 2, UDP, TCP, and IP. It is equipped with internal DNS resolution and caching, as well as customizable resolvers, with automatic fallback options for maximum system reliability. Oxy implements <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8305">happy eyeballs</a> for TCP, advanced tunnel timeout logic and has the ability to route traffic to internal services with accompanying metadata.</p><p>Additionally, through collaboration with one of our internal services (which is an Oxy application itself!) <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/geoexit-improving-warp-user-experience-larger-network/">Oxy is able to offer geographical egress</a> — allowing applications to route traffic to the public Internet from various locations in our extensive network covering numerous cities worldwide. This complex and powerful feature can be easily utilized by Oxy application developers at no extra cost, simply by adjusting configuration settings.</p>
    <p>
      <h3 id="tunneling-and-request-handling">Tunneling and request handling</h3>

    <p>We've discussed Oxy's communication capabilities with the outside world through on-ramps and off-ramps. In the middle, Oxy handles efficient stateful tunneling of various traffic types including TCP, UDP, QUIC, and IP, while giving applications full control over traffic blocking and redirection.</p><p>Additionally, Oxy effectively handles HTTP traffic, providing full control over requests and responses, and allowing it to serve as a direct HTTP or API service. With built-in tools for streaming analysis of HTTP bodies, Oxy makes it easy to extract and process data, such as form data from uploads and downloads.</p><p>In addition to its multi-layer traffic processing capabilities, Oxy also supports advanced HTTP tunneling methods, such as <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9298">CONNECT-UDP</a> and <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-masque-connect-ip/">CONNECT-IP</a>, using the latest extensions to HTTP 3 and 2 protocols. It can even process HTTP CONNECT request payloads on layer 4 and recursively process the payload as HTTP if the encapsulated traffic is HTTP.</p>

      <h3 id="tls">TLS</h3>
      
    </p>
    <p>The modern Internet is unimaginable without traffic encryption, and Oxy, of course, provides this essential aspect. Oxy's cryptography and TLS are based on BoringSSL, providing both a FIPS-compliant version with a limited set of certified features and the latest version that supports all the currently available TLS features. Oxy also allows applications to switch between the two versions in real-time, on a per-request or per-connection basis.</p><p>Oxy's TLS client is designed to make HTTPS requests to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upstream_server">upstream servers</a>, with the functionality and security of a browser-grade client. This includes the reconstruction of certificate chains, certificate revocation checks, and more. In addition, Oxy applications can be secured with TLS v1.3, and optionally mTLS, allowing for the extraction of client authentication information from x509 certificates.</p><p>Oxy has the ability to inspect and filter HTTPS traffic, including HTTP/3, and provides the means for dynamically generating certificates, serving as a foundation for implementing data loss prevention (DLP) products. Additionally, Oxy's internal fork of BoringSSL, which is not FIPS-compliant, supports the use of <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7250">raw public keys</a> as an alternative to WebPKI, making it ideal for internal service communication. This allows for all the benefits of TLS without the hassle of managing root certificates.</p>
    <p>
      <h3 id="gluing-everything-together">Gluing everything together</h3>
      
    </p>
    <p>Oxy is more than just a set of building blocks for network applications. It acts as a cohesive glue, handling the bootstrapping of the entire proxy application with ease, including parsing and applying configurations, setting up an asynchronous runtime, applying seccomp hardening and providing automated graceful restarts functionality.</p><p>With built-in support for panic reporting to Sentry, Prometheus metrics with a Rust-macro based API, Kibana logging, distributed tracing, memory and runtime profiling, Oxy offers comprehensive <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/solutions/app-performance-monitoring/">monitoring</a> and analysis capabilities. It can also generate detailed audit logs for layer 4 traffic, useful for billing and network analysis.</p><p>To top it off, Oxy includes an integration testing framework, allowing for easy testing of application interactions using TypeScript-based tests.</p>
    <p>
      <h3 id="extensibility-model">Extensibility model</h3>
      
    </p>
    <p>To take full advantage of Oxy's capabilities, one must understand how to extend and configure its features. Oxy applications are configured using YAML configuration files, offering numerous options for each feature. Additionally, application developers can extend these options by leveraging the convenient macros provided by the framework, making customization a breeze.</p><p>Suppose the Oxy application uses a key-value database to retrieve user information. In that case, it would be beneficial to expose a YAML configuration settings section for this purpose. With Oxy, defining a structure and annotating it with the <code>#[oxy_app_settings]</code> attribute is all it takes to accomplish this:</p>
            <pre><code>///Application’s key-value (KV) database settings
#[oxy_app_settings]
pub struct MyAppKVSettings {
    /// Key prefix.
    pub prefix: Option&lt;String&gt;,
    /// Path to the UNIX domain socket for the appropriate KV 
    /// server instance.
    pub socket: Option&lt;String&gt;,
}</code></pre>
            <p>Oxy can then generate a default YAML configuration file listing available options and their default values, including those extended by the application. The configuration options are automatically documented in the generated file from the Rust doc comments, following best Rust practices.</p><p>Moreover, Oxy supports multi-tenancy, allowing a single application instance to expose multiple on-ramp endpoints, each with a unique configuration. But, sometimes even a YAML configuration file is not enough to build a desired application, this is where Oxy's comprehensive set of hooks comes in handy. These hooks can be used to extend the application with Rust code and cover almost all aspects of the traffic processing.</p><p>To give you an idea of how easy it is to write an Oxy application, here is an example of basic Oxy code:</p>
            <pre><code>struct MyApp;

// Defines types for various application extensions to Oxy's
// data types. Contexts provide information and control knobs for
// the different parts of the traffic flow and applications can extend // all of them with their custom data. As was mentioned before,
// applications could also define their custom configuration.
// It’s just a matter of defining a configuration object with
// `#[oxy_app_settings]` attribute and providing the object type here.
impl OxyExt for MyApp {
    type AppSettings = MyAppKVSettings;
    type EndpointAppSettings = ();
    type EndpointContext = ();
    type IngressConnectionContext = MyAppIngressConnectionContext;
    type RequestContext = ();
    type IpTunnelContext = ();
    type DnsCacheItem = ();

}
   
#[async_trait]
impl OxyApp for MyApp {
    fn name() -&gt; &amp;'static str {
        "My app"
    }

    fn version() -&gt; &amp;'static str {
        env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION")
    }

    fn description() -&gt; &amp;'static str {
        "This is an example of Oxy application"
    }

    async fn start(
        settings: ServerSettings&lt;MyAppSettings, ()&gt;
    ) -&gt; anyhow::Result&lt;Hooks&lt;Self&gt;&gt; {
        // Here the application initializes various hooks, with each
        // hook being a trait implementation containing multiple
        // optional callbacks invoked during the lifecycle of the
        // traffic processing.
        let ingress_hook = create_ingress_hook(&amp;settings);
        let egress_hook = create_egress_hook(&amp;settings);
        let tunnel_hook = create_tunnel_hook(&amp;settings);
        let http_request_hook = create_http_request_hook(&amp;settings);
        let ip_flow_hook = create_ip_flow_hook(&amp;settings);

        Ok(Hooks {
            ingress: Some(ingress_hook),
            egress: Some(egress_hook),
            tunnel: Some(tunnel_hook),
            http_request: Some(http_request_hook),
            ip_flow: Some(ip_flow_hook),
            ..Default::default()
        })
    }
}

// The entry point of the application
fn main() -&gt; OxyResult&lt;()&gt; {
    oxy::bootstrap::&lt;MyApp&gt;()
}</code></pre>

      <h2 id="technology-choice">Technology choice</h2>
      
    </p>
    <p>Oxy leverages the safety and performance benefits of Rust as its implementation language. At Cloudflare, Rust has emerged as a popular choice for new product development, and there are ongoing efforts to migrate some of the existing products to the language as well.</p><p>Rust offers memory and concurrency safety through its ownership and borrowing system, preventing issues like null pointers and data races. This safety is achieved without sacrificing performance, as Rust provides low-level control and the ability to write code with minimal runtime overhead. Rust's balance of safety and performance has made it popular for building safe performance-critical applications, like proxies.</p><p>We intentionally tried to stand on the shoulders of the giants with this project and avoid reinventing the wheel. Oxy heavily relies on open-source dependencies, with <a href="https://github.com/hyperium/hyper">hyper</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio">tokio</a> being the backbone of the framework. Our philosophy is that we should pull from existing solutions as much as we can, allowing for faster iteration, but also use widely battle-tested code. If something doesn't work for us, we try to collaborate with maintainers and contribute back our fixes and improvements. In fact, we now have two team members who are core team members of tokio and hyper projects.</p><p>Even though Oxy is a proprietary project, we try to give back some love to the open-source community without which the project wouldn’t be possible by open-sourcing some of the building blocks such as <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/boring">https://github.com/cloudflare/boring</a> and <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/quiche">https://github.com/cloudflare/quiche</a>.</p>
    <p>
      <h2 id="the-road-to-implementation">The road to implementation</h2>
      
    </p>
    <p>At the beginning of our journey, we set out to implement a proof-of-concept &nbsp;for an HTTP firewall using Rust for what would eventually become Zero Trust Gateway product. This project was originally part of the <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/1111-warp-better-vpn/">WARP</a> service repository. However, as the PoC rapidly advanced, it became clear that it needed to be separated into its own Gateway proxy for both technical and operational reasons.</p><p>Later on, when tasked with implementing a relay proxy for iCloud Private Relay, we saw the opportunity to reuse much of the code from the Gateway proxy. The Gateway project could also benefit from the HTTP/3 support that was being added for the Private Relay project. In fact, early iterations of the relay service were forks of the Gateway server.</p><p>It was then that we realized we could extract common elements from both projects to create a new framework, Oxy. The history of Oxy can be traced back to its origins in the commit history of the Gateway and Private Relay projects, up until its separation as a standalone framework.</p><p>Since our inception, we have leveraged the power of Oxy to efficiently roll out multiple projects that would have required a significant amount of time and effort without it. Our iterative development approach has been a strength of the project, as we have been able to identify common, reusable components through hands-on testing and implementation.</p><p>Our small core team is supplemented by internal contributors from across the company, ensuring that the best subject-matter experts are working on the relevant parts of the project. This contribution model also allows us to shape the framework's API to meet the functional and ergonomic needs of its users, while the core team ensures that the project stays on track.</p>
    <p>
      <h2 id="relation-to">Relation to <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-we-built-pingora-the-proxy-that-connects-cloudflare-to-the-internet/">Pingora</a></h2>
      
    </p>
    <p>Although Pingora, another proxy server developed by us in Rust, shares some similarities with Oxy, it was intentionally designed as a separate proxy server with a different objective. Pingora was created to serve traffic from millions of our client’s upstream servers, including those with ancient and unusual configurations. Non-UTF 8 URLs or TLS settings that are not supported by most TLS libraries being just a few such quirks among many others. This focus on handling technically challenging unusual configurations sets Pingora apart from other proxy servers.</p><p>The concept of Pingora came about during the same period when we were beginning to develop Oxy, and we initially considered merging the two projects. However, we quickly realized that their objectives were too different to do that. Pingora is specifically designed to establish Cloudflare’s HTTP connectivity with the Internet, even in its most technically obscure corners. On the other hand, Oxy is a multipurpose platform that supports a wide variety of communication protocols and aims to provide a simple way to develop high-performance proxy applications with business logic.</p>
    <p>
      <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
      
    </p>
    <p>Oxy is a proxy framework that we have developed to meet the demanding needs of modern services. It has been designed &nbsp;to provide a flexible and scalable solution that can be adapted to meet the unique requirements of each project and by leveraging the power of Rust, we made it both safe and fast.</p><p>Looking forward, Oxy is poised to play one of the critical roles in our company's larger effort to modernize and improve our architecture. It provides a solid block in foundation on which we can keep building the better Internet.</p><p>As the framework continues to evolve and grow, we remain committed to our iterative approach to development, constantly seeking out new opportunities to reuse existing solutions and improve our codebase. This collaborative, community-driven approach has already yielded impressive results, and we are confident that it will continue to drive the future success of Oxy.</p><p>Stay tuned for more tech savvy blog posts on the subject!</p></div></section><div><p>Cloudflare's connectivity cloud protects <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/network-services/" rel="noreferrer">entire corporate networks</a>, helps customers build <a target="_blank" href="https://workers.cloudflare.com/" rel="noreferrer">Internet-scale applications efficiently</a>, accelerates any <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/performance/accelerate-internet-applications/" rel="noreferrer">website or Internet application</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/ddos/" rel="noreferrer">wards off DDoS attacks</a>, keeps <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/application-security/" rel="noreferrer">hackers at bay</a>, and can help you on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/" rel="noreferrer">your journey to Zero Trust</a>.</p><p>Visit <a target="_blank" href="https://one.one.one.one/" rel="noreferrer">1.1.1.1</a> from any device to get started with our free app that makes your Internet faster and safer.</p><p>To learn more about our mission to help build a better Internet, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/what-is-cloudflare/" rel="noreferrer">start here</a>.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
             

            <div><p><em>For New York’s No 1 Socialite, </em><a href="https://x.com/chengela?ref=atvbt.com" rel="noreferrer"><em>Angela.</em></a></p><p>1) Prioritize your ease of being over any other consideration: parties are like babies, if you’re stressed while holding them they’ll get stressed too. Every other decision is downstream of your serenity: e.g. it's better to have mediocre pizza from a happy host than fabulous hors d'oeuvres from a frazzled one.</p><p>2) Advertise your start time as a quarter-to the hour. If you start an event at 2:00, people won't arrive till 2:30; if you make it 1:45, people will arrive at 2:00.</p><p>3) Invite a few close friends to come 30-60 mins earlier to set up / eat dinner with you / hang out / whatever, so that when the start time approaches you’re already having fun instead of stressing that nobody will come.</p></div><p>4) Most people will only go to a party where they expect to know 3+ others already. </p><p>5) Use an app like Partiful or Luma that shows the guest list to invitees. Start by inviting your closest friends, get some yesses, then expand from there.</p><p>6) Send the invites in chat groups (or visibly cc’ed emails) to clusters of 4-5 people who know each other, so they can see that their friends are also going.</p><p>7) When inviting people individually, namedrop mutual friends who are invited or coming.</p><p>8) In a small group, the quality of the experience will depend a lot on whether the various friends blend together well. Follow your instinct on this, even if your instinct feels rude. It’s like cooking a dish, two ingredients can each be fabulous and still not go well together.</p><p>9) A large party is more like an Everything Soup: you mainly need to avoid ingredients that ruin the flavor for everyone else; beyond that you can mostly throw in whatever and see what works.</p><p>10) Regardless, try not to feel bad about not-inviting someone if your heart says they would make the party less-fun for others. Make peace with gatekeeping because if you don't exclude a small % of people you will ultimately lose everyone else. Someone can be a good person and a bad fit for your party, so don't think of it as a judgement on their soul. All of this is easier in theory than in practice.</p><p>11) Most events are better when roughly gender-balanced. Prioritize inviting people of the gender you’d likely have fewer of, then top up invites with the other. Once an event crosses a threshold (maybe 70%?) of male-or-female dominance, most people of the other gender are likely to decline (or just not-come to your next party) as a result. So there's ultimately two equilibria, "roughly gender balanced" and "extremely uncomfortably unbalanced," and you need to stay in the attraction basin for balance. To do this, keep your invite ratio at worst 60-40 in either direction, in order to prevent a downward spiral.</p><p>12) Co-host parties with someone you like a lot but who isn't in your exact social circle, so that your two friend-sets can intermingle.</p><p>13) Figure out the flake rate in your social circles (the % of people who will RSVP yes and flake on the day), and set your invite numbers with that in mind.&nbsp; In my circles, consistently 1/3rd of people who say they will be there will actually not. </p><p>14) Couples often flake together. This changes the probability distribution of attendees considerably, and so your chance of losing a quorum in a small-group setting. Small-group couple-events (e.g. 3-4 couple dinner parties) are very hard to manage in a high-flake society, as a result.</p><p>15) Create as much circulation at your party as you can. People circulate more when standing than when sitting, so try to encourage standing for those who can e.g. by having high-top tables, or taking away chairs from around tables, or leaving shelves and counter-tops open for people to rest their plates and drinks.</p><p>16) Put the food in one part of the room and the drinks in another, or spread the food and drinks out around the space, so that people have lots of excuses to move around the room.</p><p>17) If someone arrives at your party and doesn’t know anybody, welcome them and then place them with another group or person. Ideally you can pick someone they’d specifically get along well with, at second-best just someone who’s friendly and easy to talk to, but ultimately you can just insert them in any group that’s nearby and open. The main point is to prevent them having to butt in on strangers themselves, which for many people is mortifying, while your Host Privilege allows you to do it for them.</p><p>18) To leave a group conversation, just slowly step back and then step away. Don't draw attention to your leaving or you’ll be pulled back in. It feels mildly weird to do this but it’s worth it. </p><p>19) Throughout the party, prioritize introducing people to each other and hosting the people who are new or shy, even at the cost of getting less time hanging out with your best friends yourself. Parties are a public service, and the guests will (hopefully) pay you back for this by inviting you to parties of their own.</p><p>20) Let me repeat that: Parties are a public service, you’re doing people a favor by throwing them. Someone might meet their new best friend or future lover at your gathering. In the short term, lovely people may feel less lonely, and that's thanks to you. In the long term, whole new children may ultimately exist in the world because you bothered to throw a party. Throwing parties is stressful for most people, but a great kindness to the community, so genuinely pat yourself on the back for doing this.</p><p>21) The biggest problem at many parties is an endless escalation of volume.
