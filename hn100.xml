<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-theme="ivory"><p><em>Written by Nicholas Carlini, a researcher on our Safeguards team. </em></p><p>I've been experimenting with a new approach to supervising language models that we’re calling "agent teams." </p><p>With agent teams, multiple Claude instances work in parallel on a shared codebase without active human intervention. This approach dramatically expands the scope of what's achievable with LLM agents. </p><p>To stress test it, I tasked 16 agents with writing a Rust-based C compiler, from scratch, capable of compiling the Linux kernel. Over nearly 2,000 Claude Code sessions and $20,000 in API costs, the agent team produced a 100,000-line compiler that can build Linux 6.9 on x86, ARM, and RISC-V.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/anthropics/claudes-c-compiler">The compiler is an interesting artifact</a> on its own, but I focus here on what I learned about designing harnesses for long-running autonomous agent teams: how to write tests that keep agents on track without human oversight, how to structure work so multiple agents can make progress in parallel, and where this approach hits its ceiling.</p><h2 id="enabling-long-running-claudes">Enabling long-running Claudes</h2><p>Existing agent scaffolds like Claude Code require an operator to be online and available to work jointly. If you ask for a solution to a long and complex problem, the model may solve part of it, but eventually it will stop and wait for continued input—a question, a status update, or a request for clarification.</p><p>To elicit sustained, autonomous progress, I built a harness that sticks Claude in a simple loop (if you’ve seen Ralph-loop, this should look familiar). When it finishes one task, it immediately picks up the next. <em>(Run this in a container, not your actual machine).</em></p><div><pre><code>#!/bin/bash

while true; do
    COMMIT=$(git rev-parse --short=6 HEAD)
    LOGFILE="agent_logs/agent_${COMMIT}.log"

    claude --dangerously-skip-permissions \
           -p "$(cat AGENT_PROMPT.md)" \
           --model claude-opus-X-Y &amp;&gt; "$LOGFILE"
done
</code></pre></div><p><br>In the agent prompt, I tell Claude what problem to solve and ask it to approach the problem by breaking it into small pieces, tracking what it’s working on, figuring out what to work on next, and to effectively keep going until it’s perfect. (On this last point, Claude has no choice. The loop runs forever—although in one instance, I did see Claude <code>pkill -9 bash</code> on accident, thus killing itself and ending the loop. Whoops!).</p><h2 id="running-claude-in-parallel"><br>Running Claude in parallel</h2><p>Running multiple instances in parallel can address two weaknesses of a single-agent harness:</p><ul><li>One Claude Code session can only do one thing at a time. Especially as the scope of a project expands, debugging multiple issues in parallel is far more efficient.</li><li>Running multiple Claude agents allows for specialization. While a few agents are tasked to solve the actual problem at hand, other specialized agents can be invoked to (for example) maintain documentation, keep an eye on code quality, or solve specialized sub-tasks.</li></ul><p>My implementation of parallel Claude is bare-bones. A new bare git repo is created, and for each agent, a Docker container is spun up with the repo mounted to <code>/upstream</code>. Each agent clones a local copy to <code>/workspace</code>, and when it's done, pushes from its own local container to upstream.</p><p>To prevent two agents from trying to solve the same problem at the same time, the harness uses a simple synchronization algorithm:</p><ol><li>Claude takes a "lock" on a task by writing a text file to current_tasks/ (e.g., one agent might lock current_tasks/parse_if_statement.txt, while another locks current_tasks/codegen_function_definition.txt). If two agents try to claim the same task, git's synchronization forces the second agent to pick a different one.</li><li>Claude works on the task, then pulls from upstream, merges changes from other agents, pushes its changes, and removes the lock. Merge conflicts are frequent, but Claude is smart enough to figure that out.</li><li>The infinite agent-generation-loop spawns a new Claude Code session in a fresh container, and the cycle repeats.</li></ol><p>This is a very early research prototype. I haven’t yet implemented any other method for communication between agents, nor do I enforce any process for managing high-level goals. I don’t use an orchestration agent. </p><p>Instead, I leave it up to each Claude agent to decide how to act. In most cases, Claude picks up the “next most obvious” problem. When stuck on a bug, Claude will often maintain a running doc of failed approaches and remaining tasks. In the <a href="https://github.com/anthropics/claudes-c-compiler">git repository</a> of the project, you can read through the history and watch it take out locks on various tasks.</p><h2 id="lessons-from-programming-with-claude-agent-teams">Lessons from programming with Claude agent teams</h2><p>The scaffolding runs Claude in a loop, but that loop is only useful if Claude can tell how to make progress. Most of my effort went into designing the environment around Claude—the tests, the environment, the feedback—so that it could orient itself without me. These are the approaches I’ve found most helpful when orchestrating multiple Claude instances.</p><h3 id="write-extremely-high-quality-tests">Write extremely high-quality tests</h3><p>Claude will work autonomously to solve whatever problem I give it. So it’s important that the task verifier is nearly perfect, otherwise Claude will solve the wrong problem. Improving the testing harness required finding high-quality compiler test suites, writing verifiers and build scripts for open-source software packages, and watching for mistakes Claude was making, then designing new tests as I identified those failure modes.</p><p>For example, near the end of the project, Claude started to frequently break existing functionality each time it implemented a new feature. To address this, I built a continuous integration pipeline and implemented stricter enforcement that allowed Claude to better test its work so that new commits can’t break existing code.</p><h3 id="put-yourself-in-claudes-shoes">Put yourself in Claude’s shoes</h3><p>I had to constantly remind myself that I was writing this test harness for Claude and not for myself, which meant rethinking many of my assumptions about how tests should communicate results.</p><p>For example, each agent is dropped into a fresh container with no context and will spend significant time orienting itself, especially on large projects. Before we even reach the tests, to help Claude help itself, I included instructions to maintain extensive READMEs and progress files that should be updated frequently with the current status.</p><p>I also kept in mind the fact that language models have inherent limitations, which, in this case, needed to be designed around. These include:</p><ul><li><strong>Context window pollution:</strong> The test harness should not print thousands of useless bytes. At most, it should print a few lines of output and log all important information to a file so Claude can find it when needed. Logfiles should be easy to process automatically: if there are errors, Claude should write ERROR and put the reason on the same line so grep will find it. It helps to pre-compute aggregate summary statistics so Claude doesn't have to recompute them.</li><li><strong>Time blindness:</strong> Claude can't tell time and, left alone, will happily spend hours running tests instead of making progress. The harness prints incremental progress infrequently (to avoid polluting context) and includes a default <code>--fast </code>option that runs a 1% or 10% random sample. This subsample is deterministic per-agent but random across VMs, so Claude still covers all files but each agent can perfectly identify regressions.</li></ul><h3 id="make-parallelism-easy">Make parallelism easy</h3><p>When there are many distinct failing tests, parallelization is trivial: each agent picks a different failing test to work on. After the test suite reached a 99% pass rate, each agent worked on getting a different small open-source project (e.g., SQlite, Redis, libjpeg, MQuickJS, Lua) to compile.</p><p>But when agents started to compile the Linux kernel, they got stuck. Unlike a test suite with hundreds of independent tests, compiling the Linux kernel is one giant task. Every agent would hit the same bug, fix that  bug, and then overwrite each other's changes. Having 16 agents running didn't help because each was stuck solving the same task.</p><p>The fix was to use <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GCC </a>as an online known-good compiler oracle to compare against. I wrote a new test harness that randomly compiled most of the kernel using GCC, and only the remaining files with Claude's C Compiler. If the kernel worked, then the problem wasn’t in Claude’s subset of the files. If it broke, then it could further refine by re-compiling some of these files with GCC. This let each agent work in parallel, fixing different bugs in different files, until Claude's compiler could eventually compile all files. (After this worked, it was still necessary to apply delta debugging techniques to find pairs of files that failed together but worked independently.)</p><h3 id="multiple-agent-roles">Multiple agent roles</h3><p>Parallelism also enables specialization. LLM-written code frequently re-implements existing functionality, so I tasked one agent with coalescing any duplicate code it found. I put another in charge of improving the performance of the compiler itself, and a third I made responsible for outputting efficient compiled code. I asked another agent to critique the design of the project from the perspective of a Rust developer, and make structural changes to the project to improve the overall code quality, and another to work on documentation.</p><h2 id="stress-testing-the-limits-of-agent-teams">Stress testing the limits of agent teams</h2><p>This project was designed as a capability benchmark. I am interested in stress-testing the limits of what LLMs can just <em>barely</em> achieve today in order to help us prepare for what models will reliably achieve in the future.</p><p>I’ve been using the C Compiler project as a benchmark across the entire Claude 4 model series. As I did with prior projects, I started by drafting what I wanted: a from-scratch optimizing compiler with no dependencies, GCC-compatible, able to compile the Linux kernel, and designed to support multiple backends. While I specified some aspects of the design (e.g., that it should have an SSA IR to enable multiple optimization passes) I did not go into any detail on how to do so.</p><p>Previous Opus 4 models were barely capable of producing a functional compiler. Opus 4.5 was the first to cross a threshold that allowed it to produce a functional compiler which could pass large test suites, but it was still incapable of compiling any real large projects. My goal with Opus 4.6 was to again test the limits.</p><h3 id="evaluation">Evaluation</h3><p>Over nearly 2,000 Claude Code sessions across two weeks, Opus 4.6 consumed 2 billion input tokens and generated 140 million output tokens, a total cost just under $20,000. Compared to even the most expensive Claude Max plans, this was an extremely expensive project. But that total is a fraction of what it would cost me to produce this myself—let alone an entire team.</p><p>This was a clean-room implementation (Claude did not have internet access at any point during its development); it depends only on the Rust standard library. The 100,000-line compiler can build a bootable Linux 6.9 on x86, ARM, and RISC-V. It can also compile QEMU, FFmpeg, SQlite, postgres, redis, and has a 99% pass rate on most compiler test suites including the <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gccint/Torture-Tests.html">GCC torture test suite</a>. It also passes the developer's ultimate litmus test: it can compile and run Doom.</p><p>The compiler, however, is not without limitations. These include:</p><ul><li>It lacks the 16-bit x86 compiler that is necessary to boot Linux out of real mode. For this, it calls out to GCC (the x86_32 and x86_64 compilers are its own).</li><li>It does not have its own assembler and linker; these are the very last bits that Claude started automating and are still somewhat buggy. The demo video was produced with a GCC assembler and linker.</li><li>The compiler successfully builds many projects, but not all. It's not yet a drop-in replacement for a real compiler.</li><li>The generated code is not very efficient. Even with all optimizations enabled, it outputs less efficient code than GCC with all optimizations <em>disabled.</em></li><li>The Rust code quality is reasonable, but is nowhere near the quality of what an expert Rust programmer might produce.</li></ul><p>The resulting compiler has nearly reached the limits of Opus’s abilities. I tried (hard!) to fix several of the above limitations but wasn’t fully successful. New features and bugfixes frequently broke existing functionality.</p><p>As one particularly challenging example, Opus was unable to implement a 16-bit x86 code generator needed to boot into 16-bit real mode. While the compiler can output correct 16-bit x86 via the 66/67 opcode prefixes, the resulting compiled output is over 60kb, far exceeding the 32k code limit enforced by Linux. Instead, Claude simply cheats here and calls out to GCC for this phase (This is only the case for x86. For ARM or RISC-V, Claude’s compiler can compile completely by itself.)</p><p>The <a href="https://github.com/anthropics/claudes-c-compiler">source code for the compiler is available</a>. Download it, read through the code, and try it on your favorite C projects. I’ve consistently found the best way to understand what language models can do is to push them to their limits, and then study where they start to break down. Over the coming days, I’ll continue having Claude push new changes if you want to follow along with Claude’s continued attempts at addressing these limitations.</p><h2 id="looking-forward">Looking forward</h2><p>Each generation of language models opens up new ways of working with them. Early models were useful for tab-completion in IDEs. Before long, models could complete a function body from its docstring. The launch of Claude Code brought agents into the mainstream and enabled developers to pair-program with Claude. But each of these products operates under the assumption that a user defines a task, an LLM runs for a few seconds or minutes and returns an answer, and then the user provides a follow-up.</p><p>Agent teams show the possibility of implementing entire, complex projects autonomously. This allows us, as users of these tools, to become more ambitious with our goals.</p><p>We are still early, and fully autonomous development comes with real risks. When a human sits with Claude during development, they can ensure consistent quality and catch errors in real time. For autonomous systems, it is easy to see tests pass and assume the job is done, when this is rarely the case. I used to work in penetration testing, exploiting vulnerabilities in products produced by large companies, and the thought of programmers deploying software they’ve never personally verified is a real concern.</p><p>So, while this experiment excites me, it also leaves me feeling uneasy. Building this compiler has been some of the most fun I’ve had recently, but I did not expect this to be anywhere near possible so early in 2026. The rapid progress in both language models and the scaffolds we use to interact with them opens the door to writing an enormous amount of new code. I expect the positive applications to outweigh the negative, but we’re entering a new world which will require new strategies to navigate safely.</p><h3 id="acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</h3><p>Special thanks to Josef Bacik, Edwin Chen, Bernardo Meurer Costa, Jake Eaton, Dan Kelley, Felix Klock, Jannet Park, Steve Weis, and many other people across Anthropic for their assistance and contributions.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>My experience adopting any meaningful tool is that I've necessarily
gone through three phases: (1) a period of inefficiency (2) a period
of adequacy, then finally (3) a period of workflow and life-altering
discovery.</p>
<p>In most cases, I have to force myself through phase 1 and 2 because
I usually have a workflow I'm already happy and comfortable with.
Adopting a tool feels like work, and I <em>do not</em> want to
put in the effort, but I usually do in an effort to be a well-rounded
person of my craft.</p>
<p>This is my journey of how I found value in AI tooling and what I'm
trying next with it. In an ocean of overly dramatic, hyped takes,
I hope this represents a more nuanced, measured approach to my views
on AI and how they've changed over time.</p>
<div><p>This blog post was fully written by hand, in my own words. I hate that I have to say that but
especially given the subject matter, I want to be explicit about it.</p></div>
<hr>
<h2 id="step-1-drop-the-chatbot">Step 1: Drop the Chatbot</h2>
<p>Immediately cease trying to perform meaningful work via a chatbot
(e.g. ChatGPT, Gemini on the web, etc.). Chatbots have real value
and are a daily part of my AI workflow, but their utility in coding
is highly limited because you're mostly hoping they come up with the
right results based on their prior training, and correcting them
involves a human (you) to tell them they're wrong repeatedly. It is
inefficient.</p>
<p>I think everyone's first experience with AI is a chat interface.
And I think everyone's first experience trying to code with AI has
been asking a chat interface to write code.</p>
<p>While I was still a heavy AI skeptic, my first "oh wow" moment
was pasting a screenshot of Zed's command palette into Gemini, asking
it to reproduce it with SwiftUI, and being truly flabbergasted that it
did it <em>very well</em>. The command palette that ships for macOS in Ghostty
today is only very lightly modified from what Gemini produced for me
in seconds.</p>
<p>But when I tried to reproduce that behavior for other tasks, I was left
disappointed. In the context of brownfield projects, I found the chat
interface produced poor results very often, and I found myself very
frustrated copying and pasting code and command output to and from
the interface. It was very obviously far less efficient than me doing
the work myself.</p>
<p>To find value, you <em>must</em> use an <strong>agent</strong>. An agent is the industry-adopted
term for an LLM that can chat and invoke external behavior in a loop<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-1" id="user-content-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup>
At a bare minimum, the agent must have the ability to: read files,
execute programs, and make HTTP requests.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="step-2-reproduce-your-own-work">Step 2: Reproduce Your Own Work</h2>
<p>The next phase on my journey I tried
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code">Claude Code</a>. I'll cut to the
chase: I initially wasn't impressed. I just wasn't getting good results
out of my sessions. I felt I had to touch up everything it produced and
this process was taking more time than if I had just done it myself.
I read blog posts, watched videos, but just wasn't that impressed.</p>
<p>Instead of giving up, I <strong>forced myself to reproduce all my manual commits
with agentic ones.</strong> I literally did the work twice. I'd do the work manually,
and then I'd fight an agent to produce identical results in terms of quality
and function (without it being able to see my manual solution, of course).</p>
<p>This was <em>excruciating</em>, because it got in the way of simply getting things
done. But I've been around the block with non-AI tools enough to know that
friction is natural, and I can't come to a firm, defensible conclusion
without exhausting my efforts.</p>
<p>But, expertise formed. I quickly discovered for myself from first principles
what others were already saying, but discovering it myself resulted in
a stronger fundamental understanding.</p>
<ol>
<li>Break down sessions into separate clear, actionable tasks. Don't try
to "draw the owl" in one mega session.</li>
<li>For vague requests, split the work into separate planning vs. execution
sessions.</li>
<li>If you give an agent a way to verify its work, it more often than
not fixes its own mistakes and prevents regressions.</li>
</ol>
<p>More generally, I also found the edges of what agents -- at the time --
were good at, what they weren't good at, and for the tasks they were good at
how to achieve the results I wanted.</p>
<p>All of this led to significant efficiency gains, to the point where I was
starting to naturally use agents in a way that I felt was no slower than
doing it myself (but I still didn't feel it was any faster, since I was mostly
babysitting an agent).</p>
<p>The negative space here is worth reiterating: part of the efficiency gains
here were understanding when <em>not</em> to reach for an agent. Using an agent
for something it'll likely fail at is obviously a big waste of time and
having the knowledge to avoid that completely leads to time savings<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-3" id="user-content-fnref-3" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>At this stage, I was finding adequate value with agents that I was happy
to use them in my workflow, but still didn't feel like I was seeing any
net efficiency gains. I didn't care though, I was content at this point
with AI as a tool.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="step-3-end-of-day-agents">Step 3: End-of-Day Agents</h2>
<p>To try to find some efficiency, I next started up a new pattern:
<strong>block out the last 30 minutes of every day to kick off one or more agents.</strong>
My hypothesis was that <em>perhaps</em> I could gain some efficiency if the agent
can make some <em>positive progress</em> in the times I can't work anyways.
Basically: instead of trying to do more in the time I have, try to do
more in the time I don't have.</p>
<p>Similar to the previous task, I at first found this both unsuccessful
and annoying. But, I once again quickly found different categories of work
that were really helpful:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deep research sessions</strong> where I'd ask agents to survey some
field, such as finding all libraries in a specific language with
a specific license type and producing multi-page summaries for each
on their pros, cons, development activity, social sentiment, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Parallel agents attempting different vague ideas I had but didn't
have time to get started on.</strong> I didn't expect them to produce something
I'd ever ship here, but perhaps could illuminate some unknown unknowns
when I got to the task the next day.</li>
<li><strong>Issue and PR triage/review.</strong> Agents are good at using <code>gh</code> (GitHub CLI),
so I manually scripted a quick way to spin up a bunch in parallel to
triage issues. I would NOT allow agents to respond, I just wanted
reports the next day to try to guide me towards high value or low effort
tasks.</li>
</ul>
<p>To be clear, I did not go as far as others went to have agents running
in loops all night. In most cases, agents completed their tasks in less than
half an hour. But, the latter part of the working day, I'm usually tired
and coming out of flow and find myself too personally inefficient, so
shifting my effort to spinning up these agents I found gave me a "warm start"
the next morning that got me working more quickly than I would've otherwise.</p>
<p>I was happy, and I was starting to feel like I was doing more than I was
doing prior to AI, if only slightly.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="step-4-outsource-the-slam-dunks">Step 4: Outsource the Slam Dunks</h2>
<p>By this point, I was getting very confident about what tasks my AI was
and wasn't great at. I had really high confidence with certain tasks that
the AI would achieve a mostly-correct solution. So the next step on my
journey was: <strong>let agents do all of that work while I worked on other tasks.</strong></p>
<p>More specifically, I would start each day by taking the results of my
prior night's triage agents, filter them manually to find the issues that
an agent will almost certainly solve well, and then keep them going
in the background (one at a time, not in parallel).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <strong>I'd work on something else.</strong> I wasn't going to social media
(any more than usual without AI), I wasn't watching videos, etc. I was
in my own, normal, pre-AI deep thinking mode working on something I
wanted to work on or had to work on.</p>
<p><strong>Very important at this stage: turn off agent desktop notifications.</strong>
Context switching is very expensive. In order to remain efficient, I
found that it was my job as a human to be in control of when I interrupt
the agent, not the other way around. Don't let the agent notify you.
During natural breaks in your work, tab over and check on it, then
carry on.</p>
<p>Importantly, I think the "work on something else" helps counteract
the highly publicized <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/AI-assistance-coding-skills">Anthropic skill formation paper</a>.
Well, you're trading off: not forming skills for the tasks you're
delegating to the agent while continuing to form skills naturally
in the tasks you continue to work on manually.</p>
<p>At this point I was firmly in the "no way I can go back" territory.
I felt more efficient, but even if I wasn't, the thing I liked the most
was that I could now focus my coding and thinking on tasks I really loved
while still adequately completing the tasks I didn't.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="step-5-engineer-the-harness">Step 5: Engineer the Harness</h2>
<p>At risk of stating the obvious: agents are much more efficient when they
produce the right result the first time, or at worst produce a result that
requires minimal touch-ups. The most sure-fire way to achieve this is
to give the agent fast, high quality tools to automatically tell it
when it is wrong.</p>
<p>I don't know if there is a broad industry-accepted term for this yet,
but I've grown to calling this "harness engineering." It is the idea that
anytime you find an agent makes a mistake, you take the time to engineer
a solution such that the agent never makes that mistake again. I don't need
to invent any new terms here; if another one exists, I'll jump on the
bandwagon.</p>
<p>This comes in two forms:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Better implicit prompting (AGENTS.md).</strong> For simple things, like
the agent repeatedly running the wrong commands or finding the wrong
APIs, update the <code>AGENTS.md</code> (or equivalent). Here is
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/blob/ca07f8c3f775fe437d46722db80a755c2b6e6399/src/inspector/AGENTS.md">an example from Ghostty</a>.
Each line in that file is based on a bad agent behavior, and it almost
completely resolved them all.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Actual, programmed tools.</strong> For example, scripts to take screenshots,
run filtered tests, etc etc. This is usually paired with an AGENTS.md
change to let it know about this existing.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>This is where I'm at today.</strong> I'm making an earnest effort whenever I see
an agent do a Bad Thing to prevent it from ever doing that bad thing again.
Or, conversely, I'm making an earnest effort for agents to be able to
verify they're doing a Good Thing.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="step-6-always-have-an-agent-running">Step 6: Always Have an Agent Running</h2>
<p>Simultaneous to step 5, I'm also operating under the goal of
<strong>having an agent running at all times.</strong> If an agent isn't running,
I ask myself "is there something an agent could be doing for me right now?"</p>
<p>I particularly like to combine this with slower, more thoughtful
models like Amp's <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ampcode.com/news/deep-mode">deep mode</a> (which
is basically just GPT-5.2-Codex) which can take upwards of 30+ minutes
to make small changes. The flip side of that is that it does tend to
produce very good results.</p>
<p><strong>I'm not [yet?] running multiple agents, and currently don't really want to.</strong>
I find having the one agent running is a good balance for me right now
between being able to do deep, manual work I find enjoyable, and babysitting
my kind of stupid and yet mysteriously productive robot friend.</p>
<p>The "have an agent running at all times" goal is still just a goal.
I'd say right now I'm maybe effective at having a background agent running
10 to 20% of a normal working day. But, I'm actively working to improve that.</p>
<div><p><strong>I don't want to run agents for the sake of running agents.</strong> I only want to run them when there
is a task I think would be truly helpful to me. Part of the challenge of this goal is improving my
own workflows and tools so that I can have a constant stream of high quality work to do that I can
delegate. Which, even without AI, is important!</p></div>
<hr>
<h2 id="today">Today</h2>
<p>And that's where I'm at today.</p>
<p>Through this journey, I've personally reached a point where I'm having
success with modern AI tooling and I believe I'm approaching it with the
proper measured view that is grounded in reality. I really don't care
one way or the other if AI is here to stay<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-4" id="user-content-fnref-4" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">3</a></sup>, I'm a software craftsman
that just wants to build stuff for the love of the game.</p>
<p>The whole landscape is moving so rapidly that I'm sure I'll look back
at this post very quickly and laugh at my naivete. But, as they say,
if you can't be embarassed about your past self, you're probably not
growing. I just hope I'll grow in the right direction!</p>
<p>I have no skin in the game here<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-5" id="user-content-fnref-5" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">4</a></sup>, and there are of course other
reasons behind utility to avoid using AI. I fully respect anyone's
individual decisions regarding it. I'm not here to convince you! For
those interested, I just wanted to share my personal approach to navigating
these new tools and give a glimpse about how I approach new tools
<em>in general</em>, regardless of AI.</p>

      <p>
	February 5th 2026
      </p>
      <p>
	We are pleased to announce the release of Ardour 9.0. This is
	a major release for the project, seeing several substantive
	new features that users have asked for over a long period of
	time. Region FX, clip recording, a touch-sensitive GUI,
	pianoroll windows, clip editing and more, not to mention
	dozens of bug fixes, new MIDI binding maps, improved GUI
	performance on macOS (for most) ...
      </p>
      <p>
	We expect to get feedback on some of the major new features in
	this release, and plan to take that into account as we improve
	and refine them and the rest of Ardour going forward. We have
	no doubt that there will be both delight and disappointment
	with certain things - rather than assume that we don't know
	what we're doing, please leave us feedback
	on <a href="https://discourse.ardour.org/">the forums</a> so
	that Ardour gets better over time. Those of you new to our
	clip launching implementation might care to read up
	on <a href="https://ardour.org/clip_differences.html"> the differences with
	Ableton Live</a>. 
      </p>
      <p>
	In the coming weeks, we'll begin to sketch out what we have
	planned next for Ardour, in addition to responding to the
	feedback we get on this 9.0 release.

      <h2 id="major-new-features">Major New Features</h2>

      <h3 id="pianoroll-windows">Pianoroll Windows</h3>
      <p>
	Double-click on a MIDI region to edit it in its own dedicated
	window, or in a pane at the bottom of the main window. Editing in
	that window will work almost identically to the way it does in the
	main timeline, but without the distractions of the rest of the user
	interface. You can also see MIDI automation (velocity, CC parameters
	etc.), optionally overlaid.
      </p>

      <p><img src="https://ardour.org/images/9-0/pianoroll.png" alt="Pianoroll window in Ardour 9.0"></p><h3 id="cue-editing">MIDI and Audio Cue Editing</h3>
      <p>
	The Cue page now allows direct editing of the contents of MIDI cues
	(“clips” for Live &amp; Bitwig users). A pianoroll area opens that
	allows precisely the same MIDI editing operations as would be
	available on the editor timeline.
      </p>

	      <a href="#ardour-editing-carousel" data-slide="next">›</a>
      </p></div>

      <h3 id="cue-recording">Cue Recording</h3>
      <p>
	You can now record directly into cue slots, making Ardour a “looper”
	in the same sense that Live, Bitwig and several other contemporary
	DAWs are. You can pre-specificy the recording duration (e.g. “Record
	4 bars”) or you can record until you think you’re done. Whatever you
	recorded will start playing at the next quantization point (e.g.
	bar/beat).
      </p>

      <!--       <p>
      		 <img src="/images/9-0/cue-rec.png" alt="Cue recording in 9.0">
      </p> -->
      
      <h3 id="region-fx">Region FX</h3>
      <p>
	If you've ever asked “how do I add some delay to just this part of
	my vocal?”, then region FX are what you've been looking for. Similar
	to region gain it allows to apply any plugin a given audio region
	only. The effect and its automation remains with the region, even
	when it is moved around on the timeline. While the same result can
	be achieved with channels-strip plugins in the mixer (using bypass
	automation), applying effects directly to regions on the timeline is
	convenient for many workflows. The given effect is applied offline,
	when reading the region from disk and does not add any additional
	DSP load.
      </p>

      <p><img src="https://ardour.org/images/9-0/region-fx.png" alt="Region FX in Ardour 9.0"></p><h3 id="real-time-analyzer">Realtime Perceptual Analyzer</h3>
      <p>
	A dedicated perceptual analyzer window is now available within
	Ardour which allows one to visualize the live spectrum of multiple
	signals. A key feature is that one can overlay individual sources
	(tracks and busses) on top of each other. This allows one to see
	which track contributes a given of frequency range to the
	overall mix, find conflicting ranges or holes in the spectrum.
      </p>

      <p><img src="https://ardour.org/images/9-0/rta.png" alt="Realtime perceptual analyzer in Ardour 9.0"></p><h3 id="note-brushing">Note Brushing</h3>
      <p>
      	Want to set up a pattern of hihats every 1/16th notes? 1/8th
	note pizzicato strings every 1/4 note? Just hold down the
	shift key and drag the mouse while draw MIDI notes, and Ardour
	will fill according to your grid and note settings. Hold down
	Alt as well, and get only every other note drawn. Engage caps
	lock, and you can pick the notes that are drawn from a MIDI
	keyboard or pad device. A fast, easy way to draw melodies and
	rhythms.
      </p>

      </video>

      <h3 id="keyboard-drive-automation-editing">Keyboard-Driven Automation Editing</h3>
      <p>
      	You can now use keyboard modifiers, arrow keys, and the Enter key
      	to add new automation control points and change their position and value.
      </p>

      <h3 id="mixer-strips-importing-exporting">Mixer Strips Importing and Exporting</h3>
      <p>
	You can now import mixer strips from arbitrary Ardour sessions as new track or map existing track to processing in mixer strips of external sessions. You can also export strips as local (session-level) or global presets for reuse.
      </p>

      <p><img src="https://ardour.org/images/9-0/mixer-strip-import.png" width="100%" alt="Mixer strip mapping"></p><h3 id="multi-touch-ui">Multi-Touch GUI</h3>
      <p>
	On Linux and Windows, Ardour now supports multi-touch interaction as
	provided by the operating system. This may come for macOS
	eventually, but the way multi-touch works there is significantly
	different and will need more work.
      </p>

    </div>

<div>
      <h2 id="ui-changes">User Interface Changes</h2>

      <h3 id="ui-changes-app-bar">Updated Application Bar and Pane Control</h3>
      
      <p>The application bar was cleaned up and reorganized for each context. Editor specific options toggles, such as <strong>Follow Playhead</strong> and <strong>Follow Range</strong>, are now in the editor toolbar next to zoom controls. Other advanced and workflow specific options such as <strong>Rec Cues</strong> and <strong>Play Cues</strong> and the <strong>Plugin Delay Compensation</strong> (PDC) section are not shown by default anymore. Sections visibility can be configured in <a href="#new-preferences">Preferences</a> &gt; Appearance &gt; Application Bar.</p>

      <p>Additionally, one can now toggle the visibility of the left, the right, and the bottom panes directly from the toolbar. The control section is on the right, next to page switchers.</p>

      <p><img src="https://ardour.org/images/9-0/new-application-bar.png" alt="Updated application bar"></p><h3 id="ui-changes-editor-list">Revamped Editor List</h3>

      <p>The editor List panel has been redesigned to simplify switching between two commonly used tabs which you can select at the top of the panel.</p>

      <p><img src="https://ardour.org/images/9-0/new-editor-list.png" alt="New Editor List pane"></p><h3 id="ui-changes-new-session-dialog">Revamped New Session Dialog</h3>

      <p>We now used tabbed interface for the <strong>New Session / Recent Sessions</strong> dialog where you can quickly switch between creating a new session, opening a recent one, and opening an arbitrary session from the disk. The new dialog was originally developed for Harrison LiveTrax.</p>

      <p><img src="https://ardour.org/images/9-0/recent-sessions.png" alt="Updated New Session dialog"></p><h3 id="ui-changes-rulers">Updated Ruler Area</h3>

      <p>Rulers now have additional controls to add new markers and navigate to the previous or next marker from the current playhead position. Several rulers have been collapsed into one: all range-based markers are in one ruler, and all location-based markers are in another.</p>

      <p><img src="https://ardour.org/images/9-0/new-rulers.png" alt="Updated ruler area"></p><h3 id="ui-changes-library-manager">Improved Library Manager</h3>

      <p>The dialog for managing clip libraries has received cleanup:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Only show progress bar when downloading/installing.</li>
        <li>Don't allow re-install.</li>
        <li>Scale progress bar width with UI.</li>
        <li>Make sure target clip library folder exists.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="ui-changes-midnam-controls">MIDNAM Controls Relocated</h3>

      <p>MIDNAM related controls have been moved out of the track header of MIDI tracks and into the header context menu. Far too many users were confused about the functionality associated with these controls, so we've moved them to a place where we can make this much clearer.</p>

    </div>

<div>
      <h2 id="editing-changes">Editing Changes</h2>
      <ul>
	<li>Ardour now supports the concept of MIDI files and regions that are longer than their data would suggest (e.g. a 4-bar segment with the last note before the end of the 4th bar). This is mostly useful when playing clips in the cue editor for looping to work corectly.</li>
	<li>Step Editor improvements:
	  <ul>
	    <li>Chord mode: advance on final note-off.</li>
	    <li>Improve overlapping note handling:
	      <ul>
	        <li>No need to shift notes during normal edit.</li>
	        <li>Prevent duplicate (overlapping) chord notes.</li>
	      </ul>
	    </li>
	  </ul>
	</li>

	<li>Better management of visible note range in MIDI tracks and pianorolls.</li>

	<li>Add MIDI note strumming operator.</li>

	<li>When timestretching an audio region, stretch both its gain envelope and region-FX automation.</li>

	<li>In the internal edit mode, a rubber-band select with no motion (i.e. click) selects region.</li>

	<li>In pianoroll editors, allow shifting all existing MIDI later in a region/clip during a drag operation (this is not yet possible for editing on the main timeline (in the editor).</li>

	<li>Region trimming now obeys ripple mode settings.</li>

	<li>Drag threshold (how far you need to drag the pointer
	before we consider it really a "drag" operation) returns to using just pure pixel distances (rather than distances that are affected by the current zoom level).</li>

	<li>Copy-drags now require more motion before they start.</li>

	<li>Switch to draw tool when selecting region line to be shown in the region editor.</li>
	
	<li>Dragging notes past the end of a MIDI region extends it to cover them.</li>

	<li>The new "Any" algorithm for timestretching uses the StaffPad library.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

<div>
      <h2 id="other-improvements">Other Improvements</h2>
      <ul>
	<li>Default file format is now WAV-compatible RF64.
	  <p>
	    If the file is too large for WAV, it will be converted to
	    RF64 automatically; otherwise it will be a normal WAV
	    file. Ardour has supported this format for years, but it
	    is now the default one to use when recording.
	  </p>
	</li>
	<li>I/O plugins and their ports can be renamed now.</li>
	<li>ACE fluidsynth: relax sample rate constraint, unload soundfonts after use, allow MMA style bank select an all channels, and pick drums on channel 10 when available.</li>
	<li>Round to bars when mouse scroll/dragging BBT bars.</li>
	<li>Monitor controls in application bars now appropriately sensitive.</li>
	<li>Show "+" icon on editor track-header area, suggesting use
	for adding new tracks etc.</li>
	<li>Use round-robin palette color for new groups.</li>
	<li>Add "search all" mode to the mixer's sidebar plugin list.</li>
	<li>Prevent issues when changing processors while recording #10017.</li>
	<li>Make scrollbar less prominent with default theme and themeable.</li>
	<li>Update themes, make transport option button state visible.</li>
	<li>Enforce a 1 octave minimum note range in MidiViews.</li>
	<li>Set executable stack flag when linking.
	  <p>
	    This is required on some modern hardened Linux systems to allow
	    Ardour to load plugins.
	  </p>
	</li>
	<li>Ignore FLAC seek/peak-file read while recording.</li>
	<li>For the dark colored theme (the default) make pianoroll dividing lines less bright.</li>
	<li>Single pixel line, in themed "black" color, to divide B/C and E/F on piano roll header.</li>
	<li>Add find-and-display-stripable, bound to <key>Ctrl/Cmd-Shift-L</key> by default.</li>
	<li>MIDI mute fix
	  <p>
	    Previously, a sustained note that was audible as a track
	    was muted would not return when the track was unmuted. Now, the
	    note will return after the track is muted/unmuted during its
	    duration.
	  </p>
	</li>
	<li>Exclusive solo may select track.</li>
	<li>Micro-optimization: speed up connection-matrix rendering.</li>
	<li>Clarify PDC (Plugin Delay Compensation) label units.</li>
	<li>Add color scheme for inactive selected tracks.</li>
	<li>Allow selection of inactive tracks.</li>
	<li>Replace git.ardour link with github
	  <p>
	    <a href="https://git.ardour.org/">git.ardour.org</a> no
	    longer allows access to individual commits
	    or source files (thanks to LLM scrapers trying to get them
	    one by one, which is ridiculous).
	  </p>
	</li>
	<li>Sources/Regions get their own tempo and meter.</li>
	<li>Don't show hidden tracks in the editor-mixer.</li>
	<li>Reduce likelihood of dropouts when reordering processors (plugins etc).</li>
	<li>Use configurable parameter for max gain everywhere (some
	parts of the program used a hardcoded 6dB value).</li>
	<li>More correctly handle real-time (MMCSS) threads on windows, and add a popup dialog when MMCSS threads are exhausted.</li>
	<li>Overhaul persistent tooltip position #9979.</li>
	<li>Reimplement MIDI file import to retain metadata in the
	  files written.
	  <p>
	    Previosuly, all meta data was thrown away. Now we retain it, so that MIDI
	    regions can ask about their source file's tempo &amp; meter.
	  </p>
	</li><li>Allow selection of VCAs in the mixer window.</li>
	<li>Produce valid HTML when printing bindings. </li>
	<li>Add click-free bypass/enable to the ACE Amp plugin.</li>
	<li>Implement restoring hardware-to-hardware connections for internal backends</li>
	<li>Improve keyboard shortcuts for track height
	  <p>
	    Just use Alt as a modifier, instead of Alt-Shift.
	  </p>
	</li>
	<li>Add an action to print keyboard shortcuts.</li>
	<li>Expose marker scene changes. In this context,
	  "scene changes" are a pair of MIDI bank and program change
	  messages that Ardour will send to a dedicated port when the
	  playhead passed the marker.
	  <p>
	    Access the marker edit dialog via double clicking a marker
	    (or right click the marker and choose "Edit").
	  </p>
	</li>
	<li>Fix 'Arrangement Boundary' toggle for scenes
	  <p>
	    The 'Arrangement Boundary' toggle was not working correctly for markers
	    with scene changes. Location markers would get turned into section markers,
	    but would not get shifted down to the correct row.
	  </p>
	</li>
	<li>First time use dialog now allows the user to specify a
	  default location for samples/clips.</li>
	<li>You can now create audio inputs for VST3 plugin in the Pin Connection dialog directly. This already worked for AU and Lua plugins prior to v9.0.</li>
	<li>Add support for global mixer strip templates to the Template Manager.</li>
	<li>Support newer APIs at Soundcloud and Freesound.</li>
	<li>Dramatically improve behavior when using BBT markers.</li>
	<li>Allow SchedRR for I/O threads, as originally intended.</li>
	<li>When using Pipewire's JACK support, clean up names
	displayed on I/O buttons in the mixer strip and the context
	  menu for those buttons (full names still appear in the port
	  matrix).</li>
	<li>Use a bold font for bar tick labels in the BBT ruler.</li>
	<li>Correctly handle timeline cue scenes that have "Again"
	  as their follow action.</li>
	<li>Errors during loading a session are now properly escaped,
	  so that reporting the error does not cause its own set of problems.</li>
	<li>When changing MIDI port properties (e.g. "Follow
	  Selection"), Ardour now automatically updates the ports used
	  for connection dialogs and menus appropriately.</li>

      <h2 id="macos-improvements">macOS Improvements</h2>
      <ul>
	<li>Faster GUI drawing
	  <p>
	    Without telling anyone, Apple have subtly changed the way their drawing APIs
	    work for graphical applications over the last 5-10 years. The result has been
	    that a naive graphical app would end up redrawing its entire window even if
	    only a few pixels needed updating. We’re far from the only application to be
	    affected by this. In Ardour 9.0 the GUI drawing speed will be significantly
	    faster, at least on very dense pages like the mixer.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    This is a complicated area, and there are still monitor
	    configurations where our new implementation will
	    misbehave. You can switch back to a drawing model where
	    macOS is in charge, which will work but can be slower.
	  </p>
	</li>
	<li>Reduce chance of "device busy" when ejecting DMG.</li>
	<li>Improve retina scaling.</li>
	<li>Add new NSApplicationDelegate method to deal with warning on macOS Sonoma.</li>
	<li>Use ArdourMono font on macOS for consistency.</li>
	<li>use small text for ruler text on macOS.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="new-preferences">New Preference Settings</h2>
      <dl>
	<dt>Stop transport using the current grid (Transport)</dt>
	<dd>If enabled, stopping the transport (playback or
	  recording) will happen at the next grid point instead of
	  immediately.
	</dd>
	<!-- 	<dt>global quantize</dt>
		<dd></dd> -->
	<dt>Region Editing Preference (Editor)</dt>
	<dd>
	  This controls whether double-clicking to edit a region opens
	  a new window or uses the bottom panel of the editor. 
	</dd>
	<dt>Default location of new windows (Appearance)</dt>
	<dd>
	  This setting defines where new non-modal Ardour windows are opened
	  by default: at the center of the screen, centered at the mouse
	  pointer position, or centered at the parent window.
	</dd>
	<dt>Drag deadzone (Appearance &gt; Size and Scale)</dt>
	<dd>
	  This setting provides broad control over how many pixels the pointer
	  must move before a drag (or copy-drag) begins. 
	</dd>
	<dt>Group operations on selected tracks (General)</dt>
	<dd>
	  <p>
	    In Ardour 8.x, we introduced the idea that selected
	    tracks/busses form a "quick" or "implicit group", so that if
	    you select 3 tracks and adjust the volume of one of them,
	    the others will follow.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Some users were delighted with this, others were
	    not. This preference item can turn this behavior on or
	    off.
	  </p>
	</dd>
	<dt>VST3 Knob Mode (Plugins &gt; GUI)</dt>
	<dd>
	  Enforce a knob mode for VST3 plugins: use plugin default
	  or switch between linear (depends on vertical movement)
	  and two variation of circular, with and without a jump
	  to clicked position.
	</dd>
	<dt>
	  Automatically open instrument plugin GUI when adding a new
	  MIDI Track/Bus (Plugins &gt; GUI)
	</dt>
	<dd>
	  Ardour now defaults to automatically showing instrument plugin
	  GUIs when new tracks/busses with instruments are added.
	  If multiple tracks are added, Ardour will only show the GUI
	  for the first one. This setting allows you to opt out
	  of the new behavior.
	</dd>
      </dl>
    </div>

<div>
      <h2 id="fixes">Fixes</h2>
      <ul>
	<li>Fix some odd behavior when using note splitting/joining.
	  <p>
	    This commit ends the split/join operation any time
	    selection is cleared or notes are added to the selection
	    (except when in the middle of a split). This prevents some
	    rather hard to predict behavior when using note splitting.
	  </p>
	</li>
	<li>Redraw arrangement rectangles after tempo change
	  <p>
	    Previously they remained unchanged and thus incorrectly
	    indicating an arrangement section
	  </p>
	</li>
	<li>Fix MIDI Clock generator (rounding issues).</li>
	<li>Fix crash after deleting a track/bus.</li>
	<li>Fix crash when loading session from a running instance.</li>

	  lines and the keyboard in track headers.</li>
	<li>Fix comment-editor editing to allow inserting text.</li>
	<li>Fix opening links in preferences editor (e.g. VST spec).</li>
	<li>Fix #9961, update saved port-name references when renaming ports.</li>
	<li>Fix MIDI panic timestamp at cycle-end.</li>
	<li>Fix timecode update after locate for demo version.</li>
	<li>Fix a simple but rather error when computing the number
	  of quarter notes that correspond to a number of beats in a
	  given meter.
	  <p>
	    No effect when working in common (4) time, but
	    significant effects for other time signatures/meters.
	  </p>
	</li>
	<li>Fix computing the difference between two Bar|Beat|Tick (BBT) times.</li>
	<li>Fix edge case when region start is after the source' end
	  <p>
	    This fixes an edge case where an audio-region was split near
	    its end using music-time.

	<li>Fix jump in gain when deactivating aux-send with non-unity gain.</li>
	<li>Fix generic UI plugin support for numeric properties.</li>

      <ul>
	<li>We began to use C++17 syntax and features, which caused us to
	  drop support for macoS earlier than 10.13 (High Sierra, 2017).</li>
	<li>We moved a lot of our C++ header file inclusion to use <code>#pragma once</code></li>
	<li>PBD::Signal was reimplemented using contemporary C++ and
	  avoiding as much realtime memory allocation as possible.</li>
	<li>Large amounts of our use of the Boost libraries were
	  replaced by their <code>std::</code> equivalents.</li>
	<li>The build-time requirements for JACK were bumped to JACK2.</li>
	<li>The build system will now allow builds with recent msys2/mingw.</li>
	<li>reduce use of gettimeofday in favor of truly monotonic time.</li>
	<li>Use global FFT planner lock in GUI
	  <p>
	    This <em>should</em> not be needed since the GUI is single
	    threaded, but ... we're looking at you, JUCE.

                <p><i>New documents show the tactics Meta, Google, Snap, and TikTok execs used to disrupt learning, prey on minors, and co-opt the PTA to control the narrative with parents</i></p>
<p><b>WASHINGTON, DC –</b>&nbsp;Today, The Tech Oversight Project published a new report spotlighting newly unsealed documents in the 2026 social media addiction trials. The documents provide smoking-gun evidence that Meta, Google, Snap, and TikTok all purposefully designed their social media products to addict children and teens with no regard for known harms to their wellbeing, and how that mass youth addiction was core to the companies’ business models. The documents contain internal discussions among company employees, presentations from internal meetings, expert testimony, and evidence of Big Tech coordination with tech-funded groups, including the National Parent Teachers Association (PTA) and Family Online Safety Institute (FOSI), in attempts to control the narrative in response to concerned parents.</p>
<p>“These unsealed documents prove Big Tech has been gaslighting and lying to the public for years, and it’s high time parents and young people get their day in court,” <b>said Sacha Haworth, Executive Director of The Tech Oversight Project.</b> “Disrupted learning and social media addiction are core to Big Tech’s business model, and while the JCCP and MDL cases have the potential to chip away at their wrongdoing, Congress needs to make good on their years-long promise to pass the Senate’s version of the <em>Kids Online Safety Act</em>.”</p>

It can be used to help professionals make decisions based on accurate information and clear analysis, and it produces deliverables with real polish. The model is substantially better than others in the market at financial reasoning, multitasking, and maintaining focus over longer multi-step tasks.&nbsp;</p><p>Alongside Claude Opus 4.6, we’re updating some of our existing products—and introducing a new one—to put these capabilities where analysts spend the majority of their time. <a href="https://claude.com/product/cowork" data-wf-native-id-path="ca8b9fe6-cfc2-caa4-f3d9-38aa00082a1f" data-wf-ao-click-engagement-tracking="true" data-wf-element-id="ca8b9fe6-cfc2-caa4-f3d9-38aa00082a1f">Cowork</a> now delivers more polished outputs, such as financial models and presentations, on the first pass. <a href="https://claude.com/claude-in-excel" target="_blank" data-wf-native-id-path="ca8b9fe6-cfc2-caa4-f3d9-38aa00082a22" data-wf-ao-click-engagement-tracking="true" data-wf-element-id="ca8b9fe6-cfc2-caa4-f3d9-38aa00082a22">Claude in Excel</a> is now better at handling long-running tasks, with Claude Opus 4.6 staying focused and accurate as financial models become more complex.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div data-theme="ivory"><p>We’re upgrading our smartest model.</p><p>The new Claude Opus 4.6 improves on its predecessor’s coding skills. It plans more carefully, sustains agentic tasks for longer, can operate more reliably in larger codebases, and has better code review and debugging skills to catch its own mistakes. And, in a first for our Opus-class models, Opus 4.6 features a 1M token context window in beta.</p><p>Opus 4.6 can also apply its improved abilities to a range of everyday work tasks: running financial analyses, doing research, and using and creating documents, spreadsheets, and presentations. Within <a href="https://claude.com/blog/cowork-research-preview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cowork</a>, where Claude can multitask autonomously, Opus 4.6 can put all these skills to work on your behalf.</p><p>The model’s performance is state-of-the-art on several evaluations.

Our engineers write code with Claude Code every day, and every new model first gets tested on our own work. With Opus 4.6, we’ve found that the model brings more focus to the most challenging parts of a task without being told to, moves quickly through the more straightforward parts, handles ambiguous problems with better judgment, and stays productive over longer sessions.</p><p>Opus 4.6 often thinks more deeply and more carefully revisits its reasoning before settling on an answer. This produces better results on harder problems, but can add cost and latency on simpler ones. If you’re finding that the model is overthinking on a given task, we recommend dialing effort down from its default setting (high) to medium. You can control this easily with the <code>/effort</code> <a href="https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/effort" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">parameter</a>.</p><p>Here are some of the things our Early Access partners told us about Claude Opus 4.6, including its propensity to work autonomously without hand-holding, its success where previous models failed, and its effect on how teams work:<br></p><div><div><p><img alt="Notion logo" loading="lazy" width="120" height="48" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://www-cdn.anthropic.com/images/4zrzovbb/website/7cfef6cd8ce2515a6abd52560ac4189f89f9ad35-116x40.svg"></p><blockquote><p>Claude Opus 4.6 is the strongest model Anthropic has shipped.

The table below shows how Claude Opus 4.6 compares to our previous models and to other industry models on a variety of benchmarks.</p><div><figure><img alt="Benchmark table comparing Opus 4.6 to other models" loading="lazy" width="2600" height="2968" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F0e5c55fa8fd05a893d11168654dc36999e90908b-2600x2968.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F0e5c55fa8fd05a893d11168654dc36999e90908b-2600x2968.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></figure></div><p>Opus 4.6 is much better at retrieving relevant information from large sets of documents. This extends to long-context tasks, where it holds and tracks information over hundreds of thousands of tokens with less drift, and picks up buried details that even Opus 4.5 would miss.</p><p>A common complaint about AI models is “<a href="https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-context-engineering-for-ai-agents" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">context rot</a>,” where performance degrades as conversations exceed a certain number of tokens. Opus 4.6 performs markedly better than its predecessors: on the 8-needle 1M variant of <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/openai/mrcr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MRCR v2</a>—a needle-in-a-haystack benchmark that tests a model’s ability to retrieve information “hidden” in vast amounts of text—Opus 4.6 scores 76%, whereas Sonnet 4.5 scores just 18.5%. This is a qualitative shift in how much context a model can actually use while maintaining peak performance.</p><p>All in all, Opus 4.6 is better at finding information across long contexts, better at reasoning after absorbing that information, and has substantially better expert-level reasoning abilities in general.</p><p>Finally, the charts below show how Claude Opus 4.6 performs on a variety of benchmarks that assess its software engineering skills, multilingual coding ability, long-term coherence, cybersecurity capabilities, and its life sciences knowledge.</p><h2 id="a-step-forward-on-safety">A step forward on safety</h2><p>These intelligence gains do not come at the cost of safety. On our automated behavioral audit, Opus 4.6 showed a low rate of misaligned behaviors such as deception, sycophancy, encouragement of user delusions, and cooperation with misuse. Overall, it is just as well-aligned as its predecessor, Claude Opus 4.5, which was our most-aligned frontier model to date.

We included new evaluations for user wellbeing, more complex tests of the model’s ability to refuse potentially dangerous requests, and updated evaluations of the model’s ability to surreptitiously perform harmful actions. We also experimented with new methods from <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/team/interpretability" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">interpretability</a>, the science of the inner workings of AI models, to begin to understand why the model behaves in certain ways—and, ultimately, to catch problems that standard testing might miss.</p><p>A detailed description of all capability and safety evaluations is available in the <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/claude-opus-4-6-system-card" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Claude Opus 4.6 system card</a>.</p><p>We’ve also applied new safeguards in areas where Opus 4.6 shows particular strengths that might be put to dangerous as well as beneficial uses. In particular, since the model shows enhanced cybersecurity abilities, we’ve developed six new cybersecurity <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/next-generation-constitutional-classifiers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">probes</a>—methods of detecting harmful responses—to help us track different forms of potential misuse.</p><p>We’re also accelerating the cyber<em>defensive</em> uses of the model, using it to help find and patch vulnerabilities in open-source software (as we describe in our new <a href="https://red.anthropic.com/2026/zero-days/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cybersecurity blog post</a>). We think it’s critical that cyberdefenders use AI models like Claude to help level the playing field. Cybersecurity moves fast, and we’ll be adjusting and updating our safeguards as we learn more about potential threats; in the near future, we may institute real-time intervention to block abuse.</p><h2 id="product-and-api-updates">Product and API updates</h2><p>We’ve made substantial updates across Claude, Claude Code, and the Claude Developer Platform to let Opus 4.6 perform at its best.</p><p><strong>Claude Developer Platform</strong></p><p>On the API, we’re giving developers better control over model effort and more flexibility for long-running agents. To do so, we’re introducing the following features:</p><ul><li><strong>Adaptive thinking.</strong> Previously, developers only had a binary choice between enabling or disabling extended thinking. Now, with <a href="https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/adaptive-thinking" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">adaptive thinking</a>, Claude can decide when deeper reasoning would be helpful. At the default effort level (high), the model uses extended thinking when useful, but developers can adjust the effort level to make it more or less selective.</li><li><strong>Effort. </strong>There are now four <a href="https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/effort" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">effort</a> levels to choose from: low, medium, high (default), and max. We encourage developers to experiment with different options to find what works best.</li><li><strong>Context compaction (beta).</strong> Long-running conversations and agentic tasks often hit the context window. <a href="https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/compaction" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Context compaction</a> automatically summarizes and replaces older context when the conversation approaches a configurable threshold, letting Claude perform longer tasks without hitting limits.</li><li><strong>1M token context (beta).</strong> Opus 4.6 is our first Opus-class model with 1M token context. Premium pricing applies for prompts exceeding 200k tokens ($10/$37.50 per million input/output tokens).</li><li><strong>128k output tokens.</strong> Opus 4.6 supports outputs of up to 128k tokens, which lets Claude complete larger-output tasks without breaking them into multiple requests.</li><li><strong>US-only inference. </strong>For workloads that need to run in the United States, <a href="https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/data-residency" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">US-only inference</a> is available at 1.1× token pricing.</li></ul><p><strong>Product updates</strong></p><p>Across Claude and Claude Code, we’ve added features that allow knowledge workers and developers to tackle harder tasks with more of the tools they use every day.</p><p>We’ve introduced <a href="https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-teams" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">agent teams</a> in Claude Code as a research preview. You can now spin up multiple agents that work in parallel as a team and coordinate autonomously—best for tasks that split into independent, read-heavy work like codebase reviews. You can take over any subagent directly using Shift+Up/Down or <a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tmux</a>.</p><p>Claude now also works better with the office tools you already use. Claude in Excel handles long-running and harder tasks with improved performance, and can plan before acting, ingest unstructured data and infer the right structure without guidance, and handle multi-step changes in one pass. Pair that with Claude in PowerPoint, and you can first process and structure your data in Excel, then bring it to life visually in PowerPoint. Claude reads your layouts, fonts, and slide masters to stay on brand, whether you’re building from a template or generating a full deck from a description. Claude in PowerPoint is now available in research preview for Max, Team, and Enterprise plans.</p></div></article></div><div><h4>Footnotes</h4><p>[1] Run independently by Artificial Analysis. <a href="https://artificialanalysis.ai/methodology/intelligence-benchmarking#gdpval-aa">See here</a> for full methodological details.</p><p>[2] This translates into Claude Opus 4.6 obtaining a higher score than GPT-5.2 on this eval approximately 70% of the time (where 50% of the time would have implied parity in the scores).</p><ul><li>For GPT-5.2 and Gemini 3 Pro models, we compared the best reported model version in the charts and table.</li><li><strong>Terminal-Bench 2.0</strong>: We report both scores reproduced on our infrastructure and published scores from other labs. All runs used the Terminus-2 harness, except for OpenAI’s Codex CLI. All experiments used 1× guaranteed / 3× ceiling resource allocation and 5–15 samples per task across staggered batches. See system card for details.</li><li><strong>Humanity’s Last Exam</strong>: Claude models run “with tools” were run with web search, web fetch, code execution, programmatic tool calling, context compaction triggered at 50k tokens up to 3M total tokens, max reasoning effort, and adaptive thinking enabled. A domain blocklist was used to decontaminate eval results. See system card for more details.</li><li><strong>SWE-bench Verified:</strong> Our score was averaged over 25 trials. With a prompt modification, we saw a score of 81.42%.</li><li><strong>MCP Atlas: </strong>Claude Opus 4.6 was run with max effort. When run at high effort, it reached an industry-leading score of 62.7%.</li><li><strong>BrowseComp</strong>: Claude models were run with web search, web fetch, programmatic tool calling, context compaction triggered at 50k tokens up to 10M total tokens, max reasoning effort, and no thinking enabled. Adding a multi-agent harness increased scores to 86.8%. See system card for more details.</li><li><strong>ARC AGI 2: </strong>Claude Opus 4.6 was run with max effort and a 120k thinking budget score.</li><li><strong>CyberGym</strong>: Claude models were run on no thinking, default effort, temperature, and <code>top_p</code>. The model was also given a “think” tool that allowed interleaved thinking for multi-turn evaluations.</li><li><strong>OpenRCA</strong>: For each failure case in OpenRCA, Claude receives 1 point if all generated root-cause elements match the ground-truth ones, and 0 points if any mismatch is identified. The overall accuracy is the average score across all failure cases. The benchmark was run on the benchmark author’s harness, graded using their official methodology, and has been submitted for official verification.</li></ul></div><div data-theme="ivory"><p><h2>Related content</h2></p><div><div><h3>Claude is a space to think</h3><p>We’ve made a choice: Claude will remain ad-free.

<p><strong><a href="https://www.cia.gov/stories/story/spotlighting-the-world-factbook-as-we-bid-a-fond-farewell/">Spotlighting The World Factbook as We Bid a Fond Farewell</a></strong> (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46891794" title="Hacker News">via</a>) Somewhat devastating news today from CIA:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of CIA’s oldest and most recognizable intelligence publications, The World Factbook, has sunset.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's not even a hint as to <em>why</em> they decided to stop maintaining this publication, which has been their most useful public-facing initiative since 1971 and a cornerstone of the public internet since 1997.</p>
<p>In a bizarre act of cultural vandalism they've not just removed the entire site (including the archives of previous versions) but they've also set every single page to be a 302 redirect to their closure announcement.</p>
<p>The Factbook has been released into the public domain since the start. There's no reason not to continue to serve archived versions - a banner at the top of the page saying it's no longer maintained would be much better than removing all of that valuable content entirely.</p>
<p>Up until 2020 the CIA published annual zip file archives of the entire site. Those are available (along with the rest of the Factbook) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260203124934/https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/about/archives/">on the Internet Archive</a>.</p>
<p>I downloaded the 384MB <code>.zip</code> file for the year 2020 and extracted it into a new GitHub repository, <a href="https://github.com/simonw/cia-world-factbook-2020/">simonw/cia-world-factbook-2020</a>. I've enabled GitHub Pages for that repository so you can browse the archived copy at <a href="https://simonw.github.io/cia-world-factbook-2020">simonw.github.io/cia-world-factbook-2020/</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot of the CIA World Factbook website homepage. Header reads &quot;THE WORLD FACTBOOK&quot; with a dropdown labeled &quot;Please select a country to view.&quot; Navigation tabs: ABOUT, REFERENCES, APPENDICES, FAQs. Section heading &quot;WELCOME TO THE WORLD FACTBOOK&quot; followed by descriptive text: &quot;The World Factbook provides information on the history, people and society, government, economy, energy, geography, communications, transportation, military, and transnational issues for 267 world entities. The Reference tab includes: a variety of world, regional, country, ocean, and time zone maps; Flags of the World; and a Country Comparison function that ranks the country information and data in more than 75 Factbook fields.&quot; A satellite image of Earth is displayed on the right. Below it: &quot;WHAT'S NEW :: Today is: Wednesday, February 4.&quot; Left sidebar links with icons: WORLD TRAVEL FACTS, ONE-PAGE COUNTRY SUMMARIES, REGIONAL AND WORLD MAPS, FLAGS OF THE WORLD, GUIDE TO COUNTRY COMPARISONS. Right side shows news updates dated December 17, 2020 about Electricity access and new Economy fields, and December 10, 2020 about Nepal and China agreeing on the height of Mount Everest at 8,848.86 meters. A &quot;VIEW ALL UPDATES&quot; button appears at the bottom." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/factbook-2020.jpg"></p>
<p>Here's a neat example of the editorial voice of the Factbook from the <a href="https://simonw.github.io/cia-world-factbook-2020/docs/whatsnew.html">What's New page</a>, dated December 10th 2020:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Years of wrangling were brought to a close this week when officials from Nepal and China announced that they have agreed on the height of Mount Everest. The mountain sits on the border between Nepal and Tibet (in western China), and its height changed slightly following an earthquake in 2015. The new height of 8,848.86 meters is just under a meter higher than the old figure of 8,848 meters. <em>The World Factbook</em> rounds the new measurement to 8,849 meters and this new height has been entered throughout the <em>Factbook</em> database.</p>
</blockquote>

We use advanced tools to automate compliance checks, store our code in version-controlled repositories, and manage our infrastructure as code. However, when describing and managing our company, we resort to digital paper and tidbits of info distributed across people in the building.</p><p>The disconnect became increasingly apparent as I reflected on our day-to-day process: 90% of our products, documents, communication, and decision-making live in digital channels. That’s data. It lives in the cloud, spread over SaaS solutions that specialise in handling individual work processes—all systems with robust APIs and programmatic access.</p><p>At the centre of it all sits a lonely island of documents: our ambitions, goals, policies and formal structures. And I think those are pretty important.</p><p><span>Our security posture was solid before we even considered ISO 27001 because we’d already worked hard to comply with our customer’s requirements.

This requires a storage strategy that can:</p><ul><li><p>Persist the organisational graph itself</p></li><li><p>Store data associated with graph entities (like evidence)</p></li><li><p>Enable validation of considered changes</p></li></ul><p>A way to deliver this at scale would be to combine several data stores: A graph database for the organisational model, a relational database for associated data, and an event store for audit trail and change tracking. If you wanted to start small, you could serialise all this information to your local filesystem instead.</p><p>To activate external data, we would need an integration framework with a plug-in architecture to bridge the organisational model and production systems. This would handle three key aspects: (1) data collection from integrated systems like GitHub or Azure, mapping evidence to nodes in our graph; (2) policy validation that programmatically checks collected evidence against rules; and (3) policy enforcement where organisational changes automatically trigger updates across connected systems—from employee provisioning to access permission changes.</p><p>The DSL would supply this functionality using built-in modules or user-supplied plug-ins to perform the work needed to interact with other systems. Let’s imagine a Control entity in the DSL which uses a custom script to perform routine checks on MFA usage and links results to the compliance mapping:</p><pre><code>Control "MFAMonitoring" {
    Implements = ComplianceMapping.MFACompliance
    
    Verify {
        Script = "Security/mfa-checks.js"
        Methods = [
            "allUsersHaveMfaEnabled"
        ]
        Frequency = "Daily"
    }
}</code></pre><p><span>Then in </span><code>security/mfa-checks.js</code><span>: </span></p><pre><code>export async function allUsersHaveMfaEnabled() {
    const users = await myAuthClient.listUsers()

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A few days ago, <a href="https://1password.com/blog/its-openclaw?utm_source=chatgpt.com"><span><span>I published a post</span></span></a> about why OpenClaw feels like a portal to the future, and why that future is scary in a very specific way.</p><p>The short version: agent gateways that act like OpenClaw are powerful because they have real access to your files, your tools, your browser, your terminals, and often a long-term “memory” file that captures how you think and what you’re building. That combination is exactly what modern infostealers are designed to exploit.</p><p>This post is the uncomfortable, “and then it happened” follow-up.</p><p>Because it’s not just that agents can be dangerous once they’re installed. The ecosystem that distributes their capabilities and skill registries has already become an attack surface.
</p><p><img alt="An orange-red warning box that says &quot;Warning: do not use OpenClaw on a company device&quot;" loading="lazy" width="0" height="0" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://images.ctfassets.net/3091ajzcmzlr/4tgJD9yNDl4RNKI4VO2Jax/bcb7c3596444352f0f627db0525b8e2a/Blog_In-Line_The_Risk_of_Agent_Skill_Registries_Warning_Box.webp"></p><p><b>If you are experimenting with OpenClaw, do not do it on a company device. Full stop.</b></p><p>In my first post, I described OpenClaw as a kind of Faustian bargain. It is compelling precisely because it has real access to your local machine, your apps, your browser sessions, your files, and often long-term memory. That same access means there isn’t yet a safe way to run it on a machine that holds corporate credentials or has access to production systems.</p><p><b>If you have already run OpenClaw on a work device, treat it as a potential incident and engage your security team immediately.</b> Do not wait for symptoms. Pause work on that machine and follow your organization’s incident response process.
</p><h2><b>Skills are just markdown. That’s the problem.</b></h2><p>In the OpenClaw ecosystem, a “skill” is often a markdown file: a page of instructions that tells an agent how to do a specialized task. In practice, that markdown can include links, copy-and-paste commands, and tool call recipes.</p><p>That sounds harmless until you remember how humans, and agents, actually consume documentation:</p><ul><li><p>“Here’s the prerequisite.”</p></li><li><p>“Run this command.”</p></li><li><p>“Install the core dependency.”</p></li><li><p>“Paste this in Terminal.”</p></li></ul><p>Markdown isn’t “content” in an agent ecosystem. Markdown is an installer.</p><p><img alt="A gray warning box that says &quot;A dangerous misconception: MCP makes skills safe&quot;" loading="lazy" width="0" height="0" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://images.ctfassets.net/3091ajzcmzlr/9jAWHqi26gZkDIQI9jgZc/770fb8af2e0e5b8b2a5ff248b8b29759/Blog_In-Line_The_Risk_of_Agent_Skill_Registries_Info_Box.webp"></p><h3>A dangerous misconception: “MCP makes skills safe”</h3><p>Some people assume the <a href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18"><span><span>Model Context Protocol </span></span></a>layer makes this safer, because tools can be exposed through a structured interface, with explicit user consent and authorization controls depending on the host and server implementation.&nbsp;</p><p>But skills do not need to use MCP at all.</p><p>The Agent Skills specification places no restrictions on the markdown body, and skills can include whatever instructions will “help agents perform the task,” including copy and paste terminal commands. And skills can also bundle scripts alongside the markdown, which means execution can happen outside the MCP tool boundary entirely.&nbsp;</p><p>So if your security model is “MCP will gate tool calls,” you can still lose to a malicious skill that simply routes around MCP through social engineering, direct shell instructions, or bundled code. MCP can be part of a safe system, but it is not a safety guarantee by itself.</p><p>Just as importantly, this is not unique to OpenClaw. “Skills” are increasingly portable because many agents are adopting the open <a href="https://agentskills.io/what-are-skills"><span><span>Agent Skills format,</span></span></a> in which a skill is a folder centered on a SKILL.md file with metadata and freeform instructions, and it can also bundle scripts and other resources. Even <a href="https://developers.openai.com/codex/skills"><span><span>OpenAI’s documentation</span></span></a> describes the same basic shape: a SKILL.md file plus optional scripts and assets. That means a malicious “skill” is not just an OpenClaw problem. It is a distribution mechanism that can travel across any agent ecosystem that supports the same standard.</p><h2><b>What I found: The top downloaded skill was a malware delivery vehicle</b></h2><p>While browsing ClawHub (I won’t link it for obvious reasons), I noticed the top downloaded skill at the time was a “Twitter” skill. It looked normal: description, intended use, an overview, the kind of thing you’d expect to install without a second thought.</p><p>But the very first thing it did was introduce a “required dependency” named “openclaw-core,” along with platform-specific install steps. Those steps included convenient links (“here”, “this link”) that appeared to be normal documentation pointers.</p><p>They weren’t.</p><p>Both links led to malicious infrastructure. The flow was classic staged delivery:</p><ol><li><p>The skill’s overview told you to install a prerequisite.</p></li><li><p>The link led to a staging page designed to get the agent to run a command.</p></li><li><p>That command decoded an obfuscated payload and executed it.</p></li><li><p>The payload fetched a second-stage script.</p></li><li><p>The script downloaded and ran a binary, including removing macOS quarantine attributes to ensure macOS’s built-in anti-malware system, Gatekeeper, doesn’t scan it.</p></li></ol><p>I’m intentionally not pasting the exact commands or URLs here. The mechanics are unfortunately straightforward, and repeating them helps attackers more than it helps defenders. The key point is that this was not “a suspicious link.” This was a complete execution chain disguised as setup instructions.</p><h2><b>Confirmed: Infostealing malware</b></h2><p>I downloaded the final binary safely and submitted it to <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/30f97ae88f8861eeadeb54854d47078724e52e2ef36dd847180663b7f5763168?nocache=1"><span><span>VirusTotal</span></span></a>.</p><p>The verdict was not ambiguous. It was flagged as macOS infostealing malware.</p><p><img alt="A screenshot from a malware identification website, labeling a file as a malicious trojan stealer." loading="lazy" width="0" height="0" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://images.ctfassets.net/3091ajzcmzlr/1UiwBYiIp4flOcOEjhXeMW/490636f98aea1ebb1f26a7b42b54e879/Screenshot_2026-02-02_at_12.12.27%C3%A2__PM.webp"></p><p>This is the type of malware that doesn’t just “infect your computer.” It raids everything valuable on that device:</p><ul><li><p>Browser sessions and cookies</p></li><li><p>Saved credentials and autofill data</p></li><li><p>Developer tokens and API keys</p></li><li><p>SSH keys</p></li><li><p>Cloud credentials</p></li><li><p>Anything else that can be turned into an account takeover</p></li></ul><p>If you’re the kind of person installing agent skills, you are exactly the kind of person whose machine is worth stealing from.</p><h2><b>This wasn’t an isolated case. It was a campaign.</b></h2><p>After I shared this internally, <a href="https://cyberinsider.com/341-openclaw-skills-distribute-macos-malware-via-clickfix-instructions/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"><span><span>broader reporting</span></span></a> surfaced, putting the scale into focus: hundreds of OpenClaw skills were reportedly involved in distributing macOS malware via ClickFix-style instructions.</p><p>That detail matters because it confirms what this really is.</p><p>Not a one-off malicious upload.</p><p>A deliberate strategy: use “skills” as the distribution channel, and “prerequisites” as the social engineering wrapper.</p><h2><b>When ‘helpful’ becomes hostile in an agent world</b></h2><p>We’ve spent years learning that package managers and open-source registries can become supply chain attack vectors.</p><p>Agent skill registries are the next chapter, except that the “package” is documentation.</p><p>And that makes the attack path even smoother:</p><ul><li><p>People don’t expect a markdown file to be dangerous.</p></li><li><p>People are trained to follow setup steps quickly.</p></li><li><p>People trust “top downloaded” as a proxy for legitimacy.</p></li><li><p>And in agent ecosystems, the line between reading instructions and executing them collapses.</p></li></ul><p>Even if an agent can’t run shell commands directly, it can still do something dangerous: it can normalize risky behavior.</p><p>It can confidently summarize a malicious prerequisite as “the standard install step.” It can encourage you to paste a one-liner. It can reduce hesitation.</p><p>And if your agent can execute local commands, then a malicious skill isn’t “bad content.” <b>It’s remote execution wrapped in friendly docs.</b></p><h2><b>What you should do right now</b></h2><h4><b>If you are using OpenClaw or any skill registry</b></h4><p>Do not run this on a company device. There isn’t a safe way to do it. If you already did, or you ran any “install” commands from a skill, engage your security team immediately and treat it as a potential compromise.</p><ul><li><p>Stop using the device for sensitive work.</p></li><li><p>Rotate sessions and secrets first: browser sessions, developer tokens, SSH keys, cloud console sessions.</p></li><li><p>Review recent sign-ins for email, source control, cloud, CI/CD, and admin consoles.</p></li></ul><p>If you experiment anyway, use an isolated machine with no corporate access and no saved credentials.</p><h4><b>If you run a skill registry</b></h4><p>You are operating an app store. Assume it will be abused.</p><ul><li><p>Scan for one-liner installers, encoded payloads, quarantine removal, password-protected archives.</p></li><li><p>Add provenance and publisher reputation.</p></li><li><p>Put warnings and friction on external links and install steps.</p></li><li><p>Review top-ranked skills and remove malicious ones fast.</p></li></ul><p>Markdown is executable intent here.</p><h4><b>If you build agent frameworks</b></h4><p>Assume skills will be weaponized.</p><ul><li><p>Default-deny shell execution.</p></li><li><p>Sandbox access to browsers, keychains, and credential stores.</p></li><li><p>Use permissions that are specific, time-bound, and revocable.</p></li><li><p>Add friction for remote code and command execution.</p></li><li><p>Log provenance and actions end-to-end.</p></li></ul><h2><b>Designing for the future: The trust layer agents require</b></h2><p>This is the clearest proof yet of the point I made in my earlier post. OpenClaw is powerful because it collapses the distance between intent and execution. That is the magic. It also introduces significant risk. When capabilities are distributed as skills and installed via documentation, the registry becomes a supply chain, and the easiest install path becomes the attacker’s favorite path.&nbsp;</p><p>The answer is not to stop building agents. The answer is to build the missing trust layer around them. Skills need provenance. Execution needs mediation. Permissions need to be specific, revocable, and continuously enforced, not granted once and forgotten. If agents are going to act on our behalf, credentials and sensitive actions cannot be “grabbed” by whatever code happens to run. They need to be brokered, governed, and audited in real time.</p><p>This is exactly why we need that next layer: when “skills” become the supply chain, the only safe future is one in which every agent has its own identity and has the minimum authority it needs right now, with access that is time-bound, revocable, and attributable.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto">ElCity is a small, turn-based city builder that runs entirely inside Emacs.
  The UI is ASCII-based and optimized for terminal Emacs sessions.  The core
  simulation is deterministic and pure, while the UI handles rendering and input.</p>
<p dir="auto">This is an excercise in implementing the “functional core / imperative shell” architecture
  in a moderately sized project that with a developed UI. Every tile type is defined through
  a DSL, with a strong separation between state and effects. Most functions in the core are
  either pure or pure-ish.</p>
<p dir="auto">Benefits to this approach:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
  <li>easy to debug</li>
  <li>scalable in terms of code: reduced cognitive load on both people and LLMs</li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
<p>If you haven’t already heard, BMW’s R&amp;D teams have been busy “innovating.” Unfortunately, they aren’t focusing on the things that actually matter—like stellar engine performance or the legendary driving dynamics that gearheads love. Instead, the C-suite execs decided that the best use of their engineering budget was to design a proprietary security screw specifically intended to prevent BMW drivers from fixing their own cars.</p>



<figure><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="1234" height="694" src="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2026/01/30111608/bmw_screw_patent.jpg" alt=""><figcaption><em>Source: <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/bmws-screw-that-no-one-else-can-turn">Autoblog.com</a></em></figcaption></figure>



<p>At first glance, it’s almost cute: a screw head shaped exactly like the BMW logo. But the novelty wears off the moment you consider the physics. Because this head prioritizes branding over utility, neither the bit nor the screw head can withstand the torque of a standard Torx or Hex fastener. The result? Broken bits, stripped screws, and more time spent on what would otherwise be a simple task.</p>



<p>It’s a masterpiece of anti-functional design. To the casual observer, it seems to serve no purpose other than to look “cool”, but when it comes to the nitty gritty of DIY repair, it ensures that a standard toolbox is useless for basic maintenance. In fact, the patent explicitly states this as a function of its design in <a href="https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=DE469242297">section [0006]</a>: “…to prevent being loosened or tightened…by unauthorized individuals.”</p>



<p>This type of insular protectionism isn’t a one off either, it’s baked into the corporate culture. Our CEO Kyle Wiens <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/intellectual-property-circular-economy-bmw-apple">observed</a> this firsthand during a visit to BMW’s Recycling and Dismantling Center (RDC) located in Landshut just north of Munich, Germany. It’s a peculiar, one of a kind facility that recovers materials from pre-production and prototype vehicles that will never reach consumer hands. The RDC processes a few thousand vehicles each year which represents only a tiny fraction of the <a href="https://www.press.bmwgroup.com/global/article/detail/T0454605EN/bmw-group-once-again-produces-more-than-one-million-vehicles-in-germany?language=en">more than one million cars</a> BMW produced in 2025 in Germany alone.</p>



<p>BMW doesn’t seem shy about <a href="https://www.press.bmwgroup.com/global/article/detail/T0444794EN/bmw-group-recycling-and-dismantling-centre-rdc-:-30-years-of-setting-the-pace-for-the-circular-economy?language=en">declaring the RDC’s </a>mission either, proclaiming it a “template for the industry” while stating: “<strong><em>In view of new regulations</em></strong> and the BMW Group’s ambitious targets, the RDC will play an even more important role going forward…” (italics for emphasis). New regulations certainly have a way of encouraging ambitious targets, that’s for sure.</p>



<p>Their barely-passive hostility towards repair and recycling is even less hidden on the operations floor. As Kyle noted during his visit, BMW’s engineers developed a clever tool to drain oil from shock absorbers so the oil could be reused: “When a member of my tour group asked if BMW sold it to other refurbishers, the man holding the tool looked confused, as though the suggestion was patently absurd. That tool was their intellectual property; it was developed by BMW for BMW. And the patent they filed for the tool ensures that no-one else can invent something similar.” So much for a “template for the industry.”</p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong>“That tool was their intellectual property; it was developed by BMW for BMW. And the patent they filed for the tool ensures that no-one else can invent something similar.”</strong></p>
<cite>Kyle Wiens; “Intellectual property is putting circular economy in jeopardy” for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/intellectual-property-circular-economy-bmw-apple">The Guardian</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>In BMW’s defense—and the defense of an ever-growing list of manufacturers desperate to gatekeep their ecosystems—this isn’t their <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/12/23204950/bmw-subscriptions-microtransactions-heated-seats-feature">first dumb idea</a>. Heck, they’re not even the first to use security screws, the first dates back to the <a href="https://www.brycefastener.com/bryce-security-blog.html/2012/01/31/tamperproof-screws-are-history-the-age-of-high-security-screws-has-begun/">one-way screw</a> of the early 1900s. Since then, we’ve seen a parade of “tamperproof” fasteners flood the market, including some very <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/14279/apples-diabolical-plan-to-screw-your-iphone">insidious designs</a> like the Pentalobe screws used on iPhones.</p>



<p>The justifications are always the same: anti-theft measures or “protecting” the user from dangerous components. While those excuses might hold water for public infrastructure or high-voltage utility boxes, they fall apart when applied to consumer products. In your garage, these aren’t safety features; they are <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/14279/apples-diabolical-plan-to-screw-your-iphone">barriers to ownership</a>.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="1847" height="1039" src="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2026/02/02160047/BMW-Screw-Metal-3D-Print.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2026/02/02160047/BMW-Screw-Metal-3D-Print.jpg 1847w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2026/02/02160047/BMW-Screw-Metal-3D-Print-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2026/02/02160047/BMW-Screw-Metal-3D-Print-1600x900.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1847px) 100vw, 1847px"><figcaption>A 3D printed screw and matching bit derived from the patent filing (<em>Source: <a href="https://blog.adafruit.com/2026/02/02/from-ultimate-dr%E2%80%A6ogo-screw-patent/">Adafruit</a></em>)</figcaption></figure>



<p>To be clear, it’s not like we’re anti-new screws or anything, as evidenced by our resident mechanical engineers <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/110702/torx-plus-the-high-tech-screw-hiding-in-our-gadgets">waxing poetic</a> about the functional benefits of strip resistant Torx Plus screws when compared to regular old Torx or Hex. Fasteners, like all things, are subject to improvement over time and we’re all for it. That’s not what proprietary security screws are designed to do though.</p>



<p>As with any cash-grab engineered to stifle repair, the DIY community isn’t taking it lying down. Our friends over at Adafruit didn’t even need a physical screw to win this round; they used BMW’s own spurious patent filings to map the dimensions and <a href="https://blog.adafruit.com/2026/02/02/from-ultimate-dr%E2%80%A6ogo-screw-patent/">3D-print a replica bit</a> to defeat the lock.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="1536" height="864" src="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2026/01/30110849/Citizen-Engineer.jpg" alt=""></figure>



<p>This is where BMW’s plan hits a wall. We’re living in an era where the efforts of industrial giants can be unraveled by a hobbyist with a $200 printer and a bit of ingenuity. The fact that a grassroots effort can dismantle a multi-million dollar “security” initiative in a matter of days speaks volumes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The tide is turning. <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/right-to-repair-progress">Across the US</a>, we’re making massive strides in securing the right to repair our stuff, and that includes both <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/70877/deere-promised-farmers-the-right-to-repair-can-we-trust-them">commercial</a> and <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Massachusetts_Question_1,_%22Right_to_Repair_Law%22_Vehicle_Data_Access_Requirement_Initiative_(2020)">consumer</a> vehicles. In this climate, BMW’s move to lock down hardware with proprietary screws is tone-deaf and will be seen for the desperate cash-grab that it is.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section itemprop="text"><p>These days it seems you need a trillion fake dollars, or lunch with politicians to get your own data center. They may help, but they’re not required. At comma we’ve been running our own data center for years. All of our model training, metrics, and data live in our own data center in our own office. Having your own data center is cool, and in this blog post I will describe how ours works, so you can be inspired to have your own data center too.</p>

<p>If your business relies on compute, and you run that compute in the cloud, you are putting a lot of trust in your cloud provider. Cloud companies generally make onboarding very easy, and offboarding very difficult. If you are not vigilant you will sleepwalk into a situation of high cloud costs and no way out. If you want to control your own destiny, you must run your own compute.</p>
<p>Self-reliance is great, but there are other benefits to running your own compute. It inspires good engineering. Maintaining a data center is much more about solving real-world challenges. The cloud requires expertise in company-specific APIs and billing systems. A data center requires knowledge of Watts, bits, and FLOPs. I know which one I rather think about.</p>
<p>Avoiding the cloud for ML also creates better incentives for engineers. Engineers generally want to improve things. In ML many problems go away by just using more compute. In the cloud that means improvements are just a budget increase away. This locks you into inefficient and expensive solutions. Instead, when all you have available is your current compute, the quickest improvements are usually speeding up your code, or fixing fundamental issues.</p>
<p>Finally there’s cost, owning a data center can be far cheaper than renting in the cloud. Especially if your compute or storage needs are fairly consistent, which tends to be true if you are in the business of training or running models. In comma’s case I estimate we’ve spent ~5M on our data center, and we would have spent 25M+ had we done the same things in the cloud.</p>
<h2 id="whats-all-needed">What’s all needed?</h2>
<p>Our data center is pretty simple. It’s maintained and built by only a couple engineers and technicians. Your needs may be slightly different, our implementation should provide useful context.</p>
<h3 id="power">Power</h3>
<p>To run servers you need power. We currently use about 450kW at max. Operating a data center exposes you to many fun engineering challenges, but procuring power is not one of them. San Diego power cost is over 40c/kWh, ~3x the global average. It’s a ripoff, and overpriced simply due to political dysfunction. We spent $540,112 on power in 2025, a big part of the data center cost. In a future blog post I hope I can tell you about how we produce our own power and you should too.</p>

<p>Data centers need cool dry air. Typically this is achieved with a CRAC system, but they are power-hungry. San Diego has a mild climate and we opted for pure outside air cooling. This gives us less control of the temperature and humidity, but uses only a couple dozen kW. We have dual 48” intake fans and dual 48” exhaust fans to keep the air cool. To ensure low humidity (&lt;45%) we use recirculating fans to mix hot exhaust air with the intake air. One server is connected to several sensors and runs a PID loop to control the fans to optimize the temperature and humidity.</p>

<p>The majority of our current compute is 600 GPUs in 75 <a href="https://tinycorp.myshopify.com/products/tinybox-pro-v2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TinyBox Pro machines</a>. They were built in-house, which saves us money and ensures they suit our needs. Our self-built machines fail at a similar rate to pre-built machines we’ve bought, but we’re capable of fixing them ourselves quickly. They have 2 CPUs and 8 GPUs each, and work as both training machines and general compute workers.</p>
<figure><picture> <source srcset="https://blog.comma.ai/img/datacenter/breakers.webp" type="image/webp"> <img src="https://blog.comma.ai/img/datacenter/breakers.jpg" alt=""> </picture><figcaption><p>Breaker panels for all the computers, that’s a lot of breakers!</p></figcaption></figure><p>For data storage we have a few racks of Dell machines (R630 and R730). They are filled with SSDs for a total of ~4PB of storage. We use SSDs for reliability and speed. Our main storage arrays have no redundancy and each node needs to be able to saturate the network bandwidth with random access reads. For the storage machines this means reading up to 20Gbps of each 80TB chunk.</p>
<p>Other than storage and compute machines we have several one-off machines to run services. This includes a router, climate controller, data ingestion machine, storage master servers, metric servers, redis servers, and a few more.</p>
<p>Running the network requires switches, but at this scale we don’t need to bother with complicated switch topologies. We have 3 100Gbps interconnected Z9264F switches, which serve as the main ethernet network. We have two more infiniband switches to interconnect the 2 tinybox pro groups for training all-reduce.</p>
<h3 id="the-software">The software</h3>
<p>To effectively use all these compute and storage machines you need some infra. At this scale, services don’t need redundancy to achieve 99% uptime. We use a single master for all services, which makes things pretty simple.</p>
<h5 id="setup">Setup</h5>
<p>All servers get ubuntu installed with pxeboot and are managed by <a href="https://github.com/saltstack/salt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">salt</a>.</p>
<h5 id="distributed-storage-minikeyvalue">Distributed storage: minikeyvalue</h5>
<p>All of our storage arrays use <a href="https://github.com/commaai/minikeyvalue/tree/prod" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mkv</a>. The main array is 3PB of non-redundant storage hosting our driving data we train on. We can read from this array at ~1TB/s, which means we can train directly on the raw data without caching. Redundancy is not needed since no specific data is critical.</p>
<figure><picture> <source srcset="https://blog.comma.ai/img/datacenter/mkv_machines.webp" type="image/webp"> <img src="https://blog.comma.ai/img/datacenter/mkv_machines.png" alt=""> </picture><figcaption><p>Storage nodes</p></figcaption></figure><p>We have an additional ~300TB non-redundant array to cache intermediate processed results. And lastly, we have a redundant mkv storage array to store all of our trained models and training metrics. Each of these 3 arrays have a separate single master server.</p>
<h5 id="workload-management-slurm">Workload management: slurm</h5>
<p>We use slurm to manage the compute nodes, and compute jobs. We schedule two types of distributed compute. Pytorch training jobs, and miniray workers.</p>
<h5 id="distributed-training-pytorch">Distributed training: pytorch</h5>
<p>To train models across multiple GPU nodes we use <code>torch.distributed</code> FSDP. We have 2 separate training partitions, each intra-connected with Infiniband for training across machines. We wrote our own training framework which handles the training loop boilerplate, but it’s mostly just pytorch.</p>
<figure><picture> <source srcset="https://blog.comma.ai/img/datacenter/reporter.webp" type="image/webp"> <img src="https://blog.comma.ai/img/datacenter/reporter.png" alt=""> </picture><figcaption><p>reporter; comma’s experiment tracking service</p></figcaption></figure><p>We have a custom model experiment tracking service (similar to wandb or tensorboard). It provides a dashboard for tracking experiments, and shows custom metrics and reports. It is also the interface for the mkv storage array that hosts the model weights. The training runs store the model weights there with a uuid, and they are available to download for whoever needs to run them. The metrics and reports for our latest models <a href="https://commaai.github.io/model_reports/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">are also open</a>.</p>
<h5 id="distributed-compute-miniray">Distributed compute: miniray</h5>
<p>Besides training we have many other compute tasks. This can be anything from running tests, running models, pre-processing data, or even running agent rollouts for on-policy training. We wrote a lightweight <a href="https://github.com/commaai/miniray" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open-source task scheduler called miniray</a> that allows you to run arbitrary python code on idle machines. This is a simpler version of dask, with a focus on extreme simplicity. Slurm will schedule any idle machine to be an active miniray worker, and accept pending tasks. All the task information is hosted in a central redis server.</p>
<figure><picture> <source srcset="https://blog.comma.ai/img/datacenter/tbox2.webp" type="image/webp"> <img src="https://blog.comma.ai/img/datacenter/tbox2.jpg" alt=""> </picture><figcaption><p>Our main training/compute machines. Notice the 400Gbps switch in the center.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Miniray workers with GPUs will spin up a <a href="https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">triton inference server</a> to run model inference with dynamic batching. A miniray worker can thus easily and efficiently run any of the models hosted in the model mkv storage array.</p>
<p>Miniray makes it extremely easy to scale parallel tasks to hundreds of machines. For example, the <a href="https://comma.ai/leaderboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">controls challenge record</a> was set by just having ~1hr of access to our data center with miniray.</p>
<h5 id="code-nfs-monorepo">Code NFS monorepo</h5>
<p>All our code is in a monorepo that we have cloned on our workstations. This monorepo is kept small (&lt;3GB), so it can easily be copied around. When a training job or miniray distributed job is started on any workstation, the local monorepo is cached on a shared NFS drive including all the local changes. Training jobs and miniray tasks are pointed towards this cache, such that all distributed work uses the exact codebase you have locally. Even all the python packages are identical, UV on the worker/trainer syncs the packages specified in the monorepo before starting any work. This entire process of copying your entire local codebase and syncing all the packages takes only ~2s, and is well worth it to prevent the issues mismatches can cause.</p>
<h2 id="all-together-now">All together now</h2>
<p>The most complex thing we do at comma is train driving models on-policy, these training runs require training data to be generated during training by running simulated driving rollouts with the most recent model weights. Here’s a real-world command we just used to train such a model. This training run uses all of the infrastructure described above. While only this small command is needed to kick everything off, it orchestrates a lot of moving parts.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				
				<p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is surveying the commercial advertising technology market for tools capable of supplying location data and large-scale analytics to federal investigators, according to a recent <a href="https://sam.gov/workspace/contract/opp/411452e8b3614944b9c50cc3aa24fb42/view">Request for Information</a> (RFI).</p>
<p>Framed as market research rather than a procurement, the RFI seeks information from companies offering “<a href="https://privacyinternational.org/learn/adtech">Ad Tech</a> compliant and location data services” that could support criminal, civil, and administrative investigations across ICE’s mission set.</p>
		
		
	
<p>The RFI, issued by ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), emphasizes that the government is not soliciting proposals or committing to a future contract, but it does signal active interest in selecting vendors for live demonstrations of operational platforms and data services, a step that typically precedes pilot deployments or integration into existing investigative environments.</p>
<p>ICE says it is attempting to better understand how commercial <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/data-brokers">big data providers</a> and advertising technology firms might directly support investigative activities, while remaining sensitive to “regulatory constraints and privacy expectations.”</p>
<p>The agency noted that its components are handling increasing volumes of criminal, civil, and administrative information from both internal and external sources and are assessing whether commercial off-the-shelf platforms comparable to large investigative data and legal analytics providers can help manage and exploit that data at scale.</p>
<p>At the center of the inquiry is a category of information traditionally associated with digital advertising rather than law enforcement: location data, device identifiers, IP intelligence, and behavioral signals derived from everyday consumer activity.</p>
<p>Advertising technology, commonly referred to as ad tech, is the sprawling ecosystem of software, data brokers, analytics platforms, and intermediaries that power targeted advertising on the modern Internet.</p>
<p>Ad tech companies collect and process information about where devices are located, how users move between physical and digital spaces, which apps are installed on their phones, and how devices can be linked across websites, applications, and networks.</p>
<p>While the industry typically frames this activity as anonymous or pseudonymous, the underlying data is often persistent, granular, and capable of tracking individuals over time.</p>
<p>Location data is a particularly valuable component of that ecosystem. Mobile applications routinely share latitude and longitude coordinates with advertising partners through embedded software development kits.</p>
<p>Even when precise GPS data is not available, companies infer location through IP addresses, Wi-Fi networks, Bluetooth beacons, and cell tower connections. That information is then aggregated, analyzed, and sold to advertisers seeking to measure foot traffic, target audiences, or assess the effectiveness of campaigns.</p>
<p>ICE’s RFI suggests that the agency is exploring whether those same mechanisms can be repurposed as investigative tools.</p>
<p>The document asks vendors to describe platforms and data services that can support investigative needs while remaining “Ad Tech compliant,” a phrase that reflects industry norms rather than statutory law enforcement standards.</p>
<p>ICE appears to be looking into tapping into the commercial data ecosystem rather than building bespoke surveillance tools from scratch, a strategy that allows agencies to access rich data streams without directly collecting the information themselves.</p>
<p>ICE’s interest is not limited to raw data. The RFI repeatedly references “operational platforms,” signaling a desire for systems that can ingest, correlate, analyze, and visualize information from multiple sources.</p>
<p>In practice, that means software environments capable of fusing location data with other records, such as criminal histories, financial data, travel records, social media activity, or administrative files, to generate investigative leads or support ongoing cases.</p>
<p>The agency frames its inquiry as exploratory and cautious. It notes that the government is seeking to understand the “current state” of ad tech and location data services available to federal investigative entities, particularly considering regulatory constraints and privacy expectations.</p>
<p>That language reflects growing scrutiny of commercial data practices by courts, regulators, and civil liberties advocates, especially when such data is accessed by federal agencies like ICE.</p>
<p>In recent years, federal agencies have increasingly relied on commercially available data to sidestep traditional legal barriers.</p>
<p>Because ad tech data is collected by private companies under consumer-facing privacy policies, agencies have argued that purchasing or accessing that data does not constitute a search under the Fourth Amendment.</p>
<p>Critics counter that this approach allows the government to obtain highly sensitive information, including detailed location histories, without warrants, probable cause, or meaningful oversight.</p>
<p>The U.S. Supreme Court has signaled skepticism of such practices in cases recognizing the sensitivity of long-term location tracking, even when data is held by third parties.</p>
<p>At the same time, regulators have brought enforcement actions against data brokers accused of selling sensitive location information without adequate safeguards.</p>
<p>Against that backdrop, ICE’s assertion that it is considering privacy expectations appears designed to reassure both policymakers and potential vendors that the agency is aware of the controversy surrounding commercial surveillance data.</p>
<p>Yet the RFI itself provides little detail about how those concerns would be operationalized. It does not reference warrants, court orders, or judicial authorization.</p>
<p>Nor does it explain how ICE would distinguish between data associated with U.S. persons and noncitizens, how long information would be retained, or whether data obtained for one investigative purpose could be reused for others.</p>
<p>That ambiguity is particularly significant given HSI’s broad mandate. Unlike agencies focused solely on criminal enforcement, HSI conducts civil and administrative investigations alongside criminal cases.</p>
<p>Location data or ad tech-derived insights could therefore be used in contexts ranging from immigration enforcement to customs violations to sanctions and export control investigations, often under lower legal thresholds than those required in criminal proceedings.</p>
<p>ICE’s emphasis on “Ad Tech compliant” services also underscore a fundamental tension. Compliance in the advertising industry typically refers to adherence to self-regulatory frameworks, contractual obligations, and privacy policies that permit extensive data collection so long as certain disclosures are made.</p>
<p>Those standards are not designed to constrain government use, nor do they substitute for constitutional or statutory protections governing law enforcement surveillance.</p>
<p>Companies marketing “privacy-friendly” location or IP intelligence tools often argue that they avoid directly identifying individuals. But researchers and regulators have repeatedly demonstrated that supposedly anonymized or aggregated data can be reidentified when combined with other datasets.</p>
<p>In an investigative context, reidentification is not a bug but a feature, enabling analysts to link digital signals back to real-world subjects.</p>
<p><em>Biometric Update</em> earlier <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202511/dod-service-members-others-face-security-risks-from-publicly-accessible-digital-data">reported</a> that a Government Accountability Office audit had found that publicly accessible data – from social media posts to commercial geolocation records – can be aggregated into detailed “digital profiles” that expose U.S. personnel, military operations, and senior leaders to targeting, coercion, and disruption.</p>
<p>In January 2025, Gravy Analytics, a prominent location data broker, disclosed that a significant data breach had <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202501/breach-exposes-privacy-risk-from-de-anonymization-of-location-data">potentially exposed</a> through de-anonymization the precise location information of millions of individuals.</p>
<p>The RFI’s focus on live demonstrations suggests that ICE is interested in mature, deployable capabilities rather than theoretical offerings. Vendors selected to present would be expected to show how their platforms operate in practice, how data is accessed and analyzed, and how investigative outputs are generated.</p>
<p>While the agency stresses that it is not committing to a future solicitation, such demonstrations often inform subsequent procurements, task orders, or pilot programs conducted under existing contracts.</p>
<p>ICE has used similar market research approaches in the past to normalize new surveillance capabilities before formal adoption.</p>
<p>Social media monitoring tools, mobile biometric systems, and large-scale analytics platforms were all introduced through incremental steps that began with RFIs and demonstrations rather than headline-grabbing contracts.</p>
<p>For privacy advocates, the latest filing fits a familiar pattern. Commercial surveillance markets evolve rapidly, driven by advertising and marketing demand. Government agencies then adopt those tools after the fact, often before lawmakers have fully grappled with the implications.</p>
<p>Oversight mechanisms, however, lag technical capability, leaving key questions unanswered until after systems are already in use.</p>
<p>ICE’s RFI does not indicate when demonstrations might occur or whether a solicitation will follow. It does make clear, though, that the agency sees the ad tech ecosystem as a potential investigative resource worth serious consideration.</p>
<p>As debates over commercial data, surveillance, and constitutional protections continue, the filing offers a window into how federal law enforcement is adapting to – and seeking to leverage – a data economy built for advertising rather than accountability.</p>
<p>For now, ICE is asking industry to explain how ad tech-derived location and analytics services can be made suitable for investigative use while respecting privacy expectations.</p>
<p>What remains unclear is who will define those expectations, how they will be enforced, and whether existing legal frameworks are equipped to govern a surveillance model that blurs the line between consumer marketing and government intelligence.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>In 1995, Turing laureate Niklaus Wirth wrote an essay called <a href="https://cr.yp.to/bib/1995/wirth.pdf">A Plea for Lean Software</a> in which he mostly gripes about the state of software at the time. Among these gripes is this claim which Wirth attributes to his colleague Martin Reiser<a href="#1"><sup>1</sup></a>, though it's become to be known as <em>Wirth's Law</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Software is getting slower more rapidly than hardware becomes faster.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Doing his best grandpa Simpson impersonation, Wirth complains:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>About 25 years ago, an interactive text editor could be designed with as
little as 8,000 bytes ofstorage. (Modern program editors request 100 times
that much!) An operating system had to manage with 8,000 bytes, and a
compiler had to fit into 32 Kbytes, whereas their modern descendants
require megabytes. Has all this inflated software become any faster? On
the contrary. Were it not for a thousand times faster hardware, modern
software would be utterly unusable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Aside from the numbers involved here, which must sound utterly preposterous to the average modern reader, there's a lot to relate to. My 25 year career in software, all of which happened after 1995, was in many ways a story in two parts about Wirth's Law, an action and a reaction.</p>
<p>Personally, I disagree with Wirth's conclusion that nothing of value had been gained for the loss in efficiency. When he laments "the advent of windows, cut-and-paste strategies, and pop-up menus,
[..] the replacement of meaningful command words by pretty icons", he is not properly appreciating the value these features had in making computing accessible to more people, and is focusing too much on their runtime cost. Programmers are often too quick to judge software on its technical merits rather than it's social ones.</p>
<p>Wirth passed away 2 years ago, but he was a giant in the field of Computer Science and a huge inspiration to me and to many of my <em>other</em> inspirations. In many ways, my focus on simplicity and my own system design sensibilities find their genesis with him.</p>
<p>Wirth's law is so self evidently true that it's been a topic of continuous investigation and rediscovery.</p>
<p>A notable example of this was Dan Luu's <a href="https://danluu.com/input-lag/">great post on input lag</a> back in 2017. He felt that input latency was getting worse over time, so he got a high speed camera and measured the delay between pressing a key and the letter appearing on screen across a lot of different hardware. The lowest latency computer was the Apple 2e from 1983.</p>
<p>Input latency has gone up since 1983 because there is a lot more software involved in the pipeline for handling input. The kind of hardware interrupt based input handling the Apple 2e had is not flexible enough to meet modern requirements, so this additional complexity buys us a lot of value... but it's certainly not free, and if you're not careful, one of the costs is latency.</p>
<p>Luu goes on to write a lot about complexity and simplicity, and makes an interesting observation: the modern systems that fix the latency issue mostly do so not through removing complexity but by adding it. There was a lot of talk about complexity and simplicity at the time, because a huge number of software developers were working on another great tradeoff that had been made, this time in the datacenter: the widespread adoption of cloud computing.</p>
<p>In 1995, when Wirth wrote his essay, if you wanted to run a new internet company, you could just get a computer and run with it. Amazon didn't launch until July of that year, but it was famously started out of Jeff Bezos' garage.</p>
<p>The requirements for an internet company were simpler back then. The web wasn't some ubiquitous technology with total population penetration. There were only about <a href="https://medium.com/data-is-beautiful/1995-16-million-people-on-the-web-6e4cb7c76117">16 million</a> people using it at the time; more people had an SNES than used the internet. <em>Slashdot</em> didn't exist. There was no real expectation of 5 9's 24/7/365 availability, and no opportunity to "go viral."</p>
<p>By 2010, this had changed. Sure, I guess you could still get <em>Slashdotted</em> then, but more relevantly, Twitter and Facebook could drive tons of traffic to you overnight. The number of internet users had ballooned to <em>2 billion</em>.</p>
<p>To run your company's software, you could build your own datacenter, but this is a complicated task requiring a lot of expertise; you need land, permits, contractors, etc. I wouldn't even know where to start.</p>
<p>You could buy an existing datacenter, but you'd still need to manage power, backup generators/batteries, air conditioning, fire suppression, racks, maintenance, networking. Again, decades in the software industry, and I can barely build a competent list of requirements. It's a big investment, and there's a lot of opex.</p>
<p>You could rent a rack in a colo and focus on your compute needs, but those needs could change in an instant. If you plan out costs for 100,000 users and you never gain traction, you've overspent and are burning cash on pointless hardware you could be using to develop your product. If you get hit with a tidal wave of interest, you could be showing people the <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/01/the-story-behind-twitters-fail-whale/384313/">fail whale</a> for years or miss your opportunity for success entirely.</p>
<p>Cloud computing was the era's answer. By 2010, Amazon was out of Jeff's basement and running its own massive datacenters for their online operations. As Steve Yegge wrote in 2010, Bezos had distributed an influential <a href="https://data-analytics.netlify.app/jeff-bezos-api-mandate/">API mandate</a> in 2002 requiring all internal teams to make their services available via an API. By 2006, they had already built a platform that they felt they could release to paying customers in the form of EC2 and S3. <abbr title="Amazon Web Services">AWS</abbr> let you rent capacity in Amazon's datacenter through a web interface or via direct API calls, billed on granular timescales.</p>
<p>Each step in this pipeline imparts additional cost, but they're all pretty valuable, especially the last step. There are even more steps in that pipeline today, with fully managed services like RDS and IAM which abstract the management of <em>software</em> and Lambda which even further abstract your hardware requirements and allow you to scale (and pay) purely on utilization.</p>
<p>Even though the cost to run software had gone up, the improved accessibility of cloud platforms and the reduction of risky capex led to an explosion in web software. All the while, hardware was racing ahead, making the rented capacity more powerful per unit cost and reducing the per-user cost.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, not every "Wirth tradeoff" is sound engineering.</p>
<p>Early in my career, I was working at a newspaper publisher owned by Condé Nast. I was the lead engineer on one of the company's more forward looking development projects, a Django application that managed local sports results data across dozens of regional newspapers. The application provided a single source of truth for very different users and use cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reporters could add box scores and statistics on the go</li>
<li>Their websites could display results, league tables, etc.</li>
<li>The backend could publish feeds to syndicate into the print editions of each newspaper</li>
</ul>
<p>The print syndication system involved writing some pretty gnarly templates in order to generate feeds that could be understood by their newspaper printing systems. After a while, we noticed a problem. These templates were taking <em>minutes</em> to render and setting the database on fire every night.</p>
<p>If you've been around the block in software, you might already know the issue. The templates were using an ORM which dynamically loaded foreign key fields on attribute access, so innocent looking loops were doing one database query <em>per iteration</em>. These were complex templates with many nested loops: they were sending <em>hundreds of thousands</em> of database queries per render, many of them just the same query over and over again from a different loop in a different part of the template.</p>
<p>We could fix some of the terrible performance by pre-loading those fields with a join, but we had a lot of templates, and they were complex enough and the database large enough that this wasn't a realistic path to success. As Dan Luu concludes in his study on latency, the solution that worked required <a href="https://github.com/jmoiron/johnny-cache">adding more complexity</a> in the form of a smart caching layer.</p>
<p>Although we didn't know we were making it when we started the template project, this was a "bad" Wirth tradeoff. It still had utility: instead of having to manage what data might be needed in what template carefully, we could grab a list of top level objects and let the ORM fetch the rest of the data we needed on the fly.</p>
<p>The project started up quickly, but even at a pretty low scale of complexity, it became impossible to execute successfully. Before we realized what the problem was, we were using the convenience of these auto-loaded fields without understanding their true cost, and the software we built was a wasteful monstrosity as a result.</p>
<p>I see the same thing happening now but at broader scale with LLMs, and I feel myself sympathizing more and more with Wirth's cane shaking wrath.</p>
<p>Programming is the act of getting a computer to do something for you. Many people are discovering that for the first time, thanks to LLMs, they can ask a computer to do something for them, and it will actually go and do it. However, limiting yourself to programming <em>only</em> through this approach poses some problems.</p>
<p>While they might not be the <a href="https://jmoiron.net/blog/on-ai-environmental-impact">unbound ecological disaster</a> that many of their detractors claim they are, LLMs <em>are</em> still intensely computationally expensive. You can ask an AI what <code>2 * 3</code> is and for the low price of several seconds of waiting, a few milliliters of water and enough power to watch 5% of a TikTok video on a television, it will tell you. But the computer you have in front of you can perform this calculation a <em>billion times per second</em>.</p>
<p>If the problem of my accidental database denial of service syndication feed was down to ignorance over the costs of ORM usage, it's pretty obvious that a similar kind of ignorance can lead to enormous unintended costs once we start integrating LLMs into our automation.</p>
<p>I've seen a few instances of this out in the wild that lead me to believe that this trap might be particularly tricky to avoid. Despite the capacity for LLMs to educate, or simulate education, or at least point you towards related materials some of which may be real, that's not how laypeople use them.</p>
<p>They present the LLM with a problem and ask it solve that problem.</p>
<p>One example of this is from <em>myself</em>, as this is how I used LLMs in my first go, too. I had a <a href="https://jmoiron.net/blog/llm-agent-aar-recipe-management">dump of recipes</a> from a great but sadly unmaintained recipe site that I wanted to import into a self-hosted recipe management app.</p>
<p>I thought "Well, this sounds tedious, let me ask an LLM to do this." So I pointed a local LLM to the specification for the destination format, and asked it to convert the files. It converted one file every 10 minutes, inaccurately and without proper formatting. It was slow and it produced trash.</p>
<p>When you see engineers heap praise on programming agents, this isn't how they are using them. You don't ask the LLM to perform a repetitive and precise task, you ask it to build a script that performs that task. Except in rare cases, this script <em>does not itself use LLMs</em>.</p>
<p>Ironically, if you have the foresight to describe this problem to a major AI model and ask it how you should use an AI to solve it, this is exactly what it will tell you to do.</p>
<p>This approach subtly different from the way you might use LLMs for many other tasks, but it's crucial to getting results that reliably get a computer to do something for you. LLMs don't do reliable, they don't do repeatable. Building a program allows you to iterate on a deterministic solution with a stable source of truth, and you come away with an artifact that may or not be useless, but which actually works, and in my case converts 70 files/sec.</p>
<p>Another example I came across was this <a href="https://x.com/BenjaminDEKR/status/2017644773356548532">twitter thread</a> by BenjaminDEKR, which I saw being ridiculed on bsky. He asked his personal agent to remind him to get milk, and this led the agent to repeatedly ask Opus if it was daytime yet. Along with the context from his heartbeat file, this resulted in a $0.75 charge for each heartbeat, costing him almost $20 during a single night's sleep.</p>
<p>What was the solution?</p>
<p>Maybe you decide that for your purposes 00:00 is night and 08:00 is day and use a basic local <code>gettimeofday</code> call to determine which span you're in. Maybe you're unsatisfied with anything other than astronomical day/night and can <a href="https://gml.noaa.gov/grad/solcalc/table.php?lat=39.833&amp;lon=-98.583&amp;year=2026">generate a sunrise/sunset table for the year</a> using NOAA's unmaintained solar calculator to dynamically produce your day/night spans?</p>
<p>You could do these things, but not if asking the LLM to solve problems is your problem solving approach. If asking an LLM is the only way you know how to solve problems, then you optimize the question asking by <a href="https://x.com/BenjaminDEKR/status/2017660150463582282">reducing heartbeat frequency and running on a cheaper model</a>. Problem solved!</p>
<p>The overall concern is that having a magic box that gives you the answers ends up being a thought terminating solution to any problem.</p>
<p>When I wrote about the ecological impacts of AI, one of the non-ecological impacts I cited was the possibility that "AI erodes human skill." A recent release by research fellows at Anthropic, "<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20245">How AI Impacts Skill Formation</a>", suggests this fear isn't unfounded:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We find that AI use impairs conceptual understanding, code reading, and debugging abilities, without delivering significant efficiency gains on average.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A few weeks ago, I was at a family gathering watching some of the kids go through a huge backlog of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_envelope">red envelopes</a> that their grandparents had saved for them over various missed holidays. They were pulling out all of the cash, at which point they were going to tally it all up and split it evenly.</p>
<p>When the adults challenged them to come up with better counting strategies, one of them suggested they could throw all of the money on the floor, take a picture, and ask ChatGPT to tally it all.</p>
<p>The instincts are for people to get the AI to do work for them, not to learn from the AI how to do the work themselves.</p>
<p>Wirth's law posits that software can erase gains faster than hardware can make them, but I'm afraid the reality is much worse than that.</p>
<p>If you've studied computer science, you might have heard of a function called <em>Busy Beaver</em>. The name is unfortunately silly, but it's a fairly important thought experiment in computability. <code>BB(N)</code> is defined as the maximum number of steps a terminating turing machine with N states can run.</p>
<p>This function is known to be <em>noncomputable</em>, because any algorithm that could compute it would be able to solve the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem">halting problem</a>, which is known to be <em>undecidable</em>. <code>BB(1..3)</code> were known in the 1960s to be 1, 6, and 21. In a pleasant bit of symmetry with Dan Luu's experiments, <code>BB(4)</code> was discovered to be 107 in 1983, the same year his Apple 2e was built. In 2024, <code>BB(5)</code> was <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=8088">proven to be 47,176,870</a>.</p>
<p>As N grows, BB is known to eventually outgrow any computable sequence, including famous fast-growing sequences like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruskal%27s_tree_theorem">TREE()</a>. <code>BB(6)</code> has a lower bound that is so large that it is impossible to explain how large it is to someone without a significant background in mathematics.</p>
<p>Software has an unprecedented capability to produce a correct answer in the most resource consuming way possible. Of course, producing incorrect answers or no answer at all is also an option.</p>
<p>Despite the apparent truth of Wirth's law, engineers have been actively battling against it for decades, but I worry that with LLMs we might have lost the war.</p>
<p>Am I just the latest in a long line of engineers who can't appreciate the newfound democratization of programming, or have we crossed into a "bad" Wirth tradeoff, where the growth curve of runtime complexity is something that hardware advancements cannot possibly dig us back out of?</p>
