<p>Chrome has been the dominant web browser for PC and mobile for some time now. Chrome is everywhere, to the point a huge selection of <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/best-android-web-browser/">the best mobile browsers</a> are Chromium-based (Google's open-sourced version of Chrome), and just because <a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/10402/worldwide-browser-market-share-by-platform/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Chrome has been the leading choice for Android and desktop users</a>, it doesn't mean it's necessarily the best browser out there.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/chrome-using-much-ram-fix-right-now/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Chrome is known as a system hog</a> on your CPU and RAM, but unfortunately, Firefox also adds stress to your system resources. But when it comes to the best privacy and security and a cleaner browsing experience, Firefox reigns supreme over the majority of Chromium implementations.</p>

<p>But the final push to start using Firefox over Chrome might finally be thanks to the <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/firefox-mozilla-extensions-android-mobile/">enormous selection of add-ons</a> (Firefox's version of extensions) coming out next month. Chrome doesn't offer native support for extensions in its mobile app. This is where Mozilla can finally regain ground over Google, especially now that Google is so insistent on serving ads everywhere, <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/youtube-ads-european-union-law-google-meta/">like YouTube and its current security concerns</a>.</p>

<h2 id="firefox-wins-the-battle-for-best-user-privacy-and-security"> Firefox wins the battle for best user privacy and security </h2>
<p>As a non-profit project, <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/privacy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mozilla is committed to transparency and user privacy</a> through an open-source model. The advantage of running an open-source project is that the entire community can contribute to making the web a better place, plus the code is public, which means anyone can audit it.</p>

<p>Firefox also protects your privacy with its <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/enhanced-tracking-protection-firefox-desktop" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Enhanced Tracking Protection</a>. While Google has been <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-chrome-120/">taking its sweet time phasing out cookies</a>, Mozilla has been making progress with <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/mozilla-total-cookie-protection-default-firefox/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Total Cookie Protection (TCP) since 2021</a>, and it's on by default. With extra add-ons coming to Firefox, installing your favorite extensions for privacy and security will only get easier.</p>

<h2 id="installing-add-ons-on-firefox-is-only-going-to-get-better"> Installing add-ons on Firefox is only going to get better </h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/how-to-open-chrome-web-store/">Chrome Web Store</a> has plenty of extensions to improve your Chrome browsing. These extensions can help you block ads, manage passwords, and provide anti-malware tools to make internet browsing safe and more secure. Only trusted Chrome extensions make it to the Chrome Web Store. But sadly, Google doesn't extend these benefits to its mobile browser. And if you can't live without your extensions, you'd have to settle with third-party extensions on Chromium-based web browsers instead, moving you away from Chrome.</p>

<p>So far, <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/install-add-on-extension-mozilla-firefox-android/">Mozilla offers only a few select add-ons</a> (Mozilla's version of extensions) that work on Android, one of which is uBlock Origin (proving itself incredibly helpful as YouTube wages war against adblockers). But soon, Mozilla <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/firefox-mozilla-extensions-android-mobile/">will launch 200 new add-ons in Firefox 120</a>. That's a whopping 200 more than Google, bringing Firefox Mobile much closer to its Desktop sibling, something Google appears deadset against with Chrome on mobile.</p>
<!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":2,"startingPoint":1,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":2,"nbrPlacementsScanned":3,"ruleCount":1000,"degradationStartingPoint":2,"actualCount":1213} --><!-- Zone: character count repeatable. --><!-- No ads allowed! --><!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"after","adPosition":3,"startingPoint":1,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":3,"nbrPlacementsScanned":3,"ruleCount":1000,"degradationStartingPoint":2,"actualCount":0} -->

<h2 id="add-ons-ensure-firefox-brings-a-competitive-edge-to-mobile"> Add-ons ensure Firefox brings a competitive edge to mobile </h2>
<p>When using Firefox, once you plug in a few helpful add-ons, you don't have to worry about sifting through tons of ads, auto-playing videos, and pop-ups. The uBlock Origin plugin can take care of these things, and if it doesn't, you can manually tell it to. And that's just one add-on. Imagine what 200 will bring to the table. Browsing the web on mobile can be just as clutter-free as web browsing on a computer. And since we often prefer to jump into a news story as quickly as possible on our mobile devices, thanks to Firefox's use of add-ons, background clutter and every other annoyance filling our tiny screens may soon be a thing of the past.</p>
<!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. --><!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":3,"startingPoint":1,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":3,"nbrPlacementsScanned":4,"ruleCount":1000,"degradationStartingPoint":2,"actualCount":905} -->

<p>It's no secret Google loves ads; <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/266249/advertising-revenue-of-google/" target="_blank">Google generates billions of dollars from ads alone</a>. And so the vast majority of sites you read follow suit, requiring ads to keep their livelihoods in check as the pay rate continues to fall. Unfortunately, based on how important ads have become for generating revenue, there will never be a shortage of ads online.</p>
<!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. --><!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":4,"startingPoint":1,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":4,"nbrPlacementsScanned":5,"ruleCount":1000,"degradationStartingPoint":2,"actualCount":353} -->
<p>But in a world of ads, ads can still exist without being intrusive. Google doesn't care which ads you see until you use filters. We also know <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-abuse-google-ads-to-spread-malware-in-legit-software/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google can serve ads that are used for nefarious purposes</a>, which is <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/Y2022/PSA221221?=8324278624" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">why the FBI recommends using an ad blocker when online</a>. And thanks to how lucrative ads have become for Google, the company will more than likely never budge on its stance to bring extension support to mobile, as <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/435252/adblock-users-worldwide/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">most users will install adblockers</a>. But with Firefox, you can already install uBlock Origin to lockdown those ads, with 200 more add-ons coming soon to bolster the experience.</p>

<p>Google Chrome may still be everyone's favorite browser on desktop and mobile, especially with its <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/best-google-chrome-extensions/">impressive library of extensions</a> for desktops. Still, with <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/firefox-mozilla-extensions-android-mobile/">Mozilla Firefox catching up to the extension and add-on</a> game and bringing its work over to Android, Firefox has more than enough fuel to make a comeback in no time flat, especially as Google wages war <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/youtube-ads-european-union-law-google-meta/">against adblockers and its users</a>, privacy be damned. With Mozilla's recent moves ensuring Firefox takes shape as one of the most accessible web browsers around, you'd think Google would eventually pick up the pace and start making some pro-consumer moves.</p>
<!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. --><!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":5,"startingPoint":1,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":5,"nbrPlacementsScanned":6,"ruleCount":1000,"degradationStartingPoint":2,"actualCount":625} -->
<p>But products can only improve with better competition; having another web browser that turns heads may finally force Google to up its game if Firefox really makes a splash once its new add-on supports drops. So not only is it high time to give Firefox another chance as Chrome grows stale and ad-filled, you can expect hundreds of add-ons to make the Firefox browsing experience even better <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox/Releases/120" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on November 21st</a>.</p>

    Reflecting on 18 years at Google
   </h3>
<p>I joined Google in October 2005, and handed in my resignation 18 years later. Last week was my last week at Google.</p>

<p>I feel very lucky to have experienced the early post-IPO Google; unlike most companies, and contrary to the popular narrative, Googlers, from the junior engineer all the way to the C-suite, were genuinely good people who cared very much about doing the right thing. The oft-mocked "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_be_evil">don't be evil</a>" truly was the guiding principle of the company at the time (largely a reaction to contemporaries like Microsoft whose operating procedures put profits far above the best interests of customers and humanity as a whole).</p>

<p>Many times I saw Google criticised for actions that were sincerely intended to be good for society. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authors_Guild,_Inc._v._Google,_Inc.">Google Books</a>, for example. Much of the criticism Google received around Chrome and Search, especially around supposed conflicts of interest with Ads, was way off base (it's surprising how often coincidences and mistakes can appear malicious). I often saw privacy advocates argue against Google proposals in ways that were net harmful to users. Some of these fights have had lasting effects on the world at large; one of the most annoying is the prevalence of pointless cookie warnings we have to wade through today. I found it quite frustrating how teams would be legitimately actively pursuing ideas that would be good for the world, without prioritising short-term Google interests, only to be met with cynicism in the court of public opinion.</p>

<p>Early Google was also an excellent place to work. Executives gave frank answers on a weekly basis, or were candid about their inability to do so (e.g. for legal reasons or because some topic was too sensitive to discuss broadly). Eric Schmidt regularly walked the whole company through the discussions of the board. The successes and failures of various products were presented more or less objectively, with successes celebrated and failures examined critically with an eye to learning lessons rather than assigning blame. The company had a vision, and deviations from that vision were explained. Having experienced <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Dilbert_characters#Pointy-haired_Boss">Dilbert-level management</a> during my internship at Netscape five years earlier, the uniform competence of people at Google was very refreshing.</p>

<p>For my first nine years at Google I worked on <a href="https://whatwg.org/">HTML and related standards</a>. My mandate was to do the best thing for the web, as whatever was good for the web would be good for Google (I was explicitly told to ignore Google's interests). This was a continuation of the work I started while at Opera Software. Google was an excellent host for this effort. My team was nominally the open source team at Google, but I was entirely autonomous (for which I owe thanks to Chris DiBona). Most of my work was done on a laptop from random buildings on Google's campus; entire years went by where I didn't use my assigned desk.</p>

<p>In time, exceptions to Google's cultural strengths developed. For example, as much as I enjoyed Vic Gundotra's enthusiasm (and his initial vision for Google+, which again was quite well defined and, if not necessarily uniformly appreciated, at least unambiguous), I felt less confident in his ability to give clear answers when things were not going as well as hoped. He also started introducing silos to Google (e.g. locking down certain buildings to just the Google+ team), a distinct departure from the complete internal transparency of early Google. Another example is the Android team (originally an acquisition), who never really fully acclimated to Google's culture. Android's work/life balance was unhealthy, the team was not as transparent as older parts of Google, and the team focused on chasing the competition more than solving real problems for users.</p>

<p>My last nine years were spent on Flutter. Some of my fondest memories of my time at Google are of the early days of this effort. Flutter was one of the last projects to come out of the old Google, part of a stable of ambitious experiments started by Larry Page shortly before the creation of Alphabet. We essentially operated like a startup, <em>discovering</em> what we were building more than designing it. The Flutter team was very much built out of the culture of young Google; for example we prioritised internal transparency, work/life balance, and data-driven decision making (greatly helped by Tao Dong and his UXR team). We were radically open from the beginning, which made it easy for us to build a healthy open source project around the effort as well. Flutter was also very lucky to have excellent leadership throughout the years, such as Adam Barth as founding tech lead, Tim Sneath as PM, and Todd Volkert as engineering manager.</p>

<p>
<img src="https://ln.hixie.ch/media/photos/california/2015/flutter_design_document-2015-05-06-small.jpeg" alt="[Photograph]">
We also didn't follow engineering best practices for the first few years. For example we wrote no tests and had precious little documentation. This whiteboard is what passed for a design doc for the core Widget, RenderObject, and dart:ui layers. This allowed us to move fast at first, but we paid for it later.</p>

<p>Flutter grew in a bubble, largely insulated from the changes Google was experiencing at the same time. Google's culture eroded. Decisions went from being made for the benefit of users, to the benefit of Google, to the benefit of whoever was making the decision. Transparency evaporated. Where previously I would eagerly attend every company-wide meeting to learn what was happening, I found myself now able to predict the answers executives would give word for word. Today, I don't know anyone at Google who could explain what Google's vision is. Morale is at an all-time low. If you talk to therapists in the bay area, they will tell you all their Google clients are unhappy with Google.</p>

<p>Then Google had layoffs. The layoffs were an unforced error driven by a short-sighted drive to ensure the stock price would keep growing quarter-to-quarter, instead of following Google's erstwhile strategy of prioritising long-term success even if that led to short-term losses (the very essence of "don't be evil"). The effects of layoffs are insidious. Whereas before people might focus on the user, or at least their company, trusting that doing the right thing will eventually be rewarded even if it's not strictly part of their assigned duties, after a layoff people can no longer trust that their company has their back, and they dramatically dial back any risk-taking. Responsibilities are guarded jealously. Knowledge is hoarded, because making oneself irreplaceable is the only lever one has to protect oneself from future layoffs. I see all of this at Google now. The lack of trust in management is reflected by management no longer showing trust in the employees either, in the form of inane corporate policies. In 2004, Google's founders <a href="https://abc.xyz/investor/founders-letters/ipo-letter/">famously told Wall Street</a> "Google is not a conventional company. We do not intend to become one." but that Google is no more.</p>

<p>Much of these problems with Google today stem from a lack of visionary leadership from Sundar Pichai, and his clear lack of interest in maintaining the cultural norms of early Google. A symptom of this is the spreading contingent of inept middle management. Take Jeanine Banks, for example, who manages the department that somewhat arbitrarily contains (among other things) Flutter, Dart, Go, and Firebase. Her department nominally has a strategy, but I couldn't leak it if I wanted to; I literally could never figure out what any part of it meant, even after years of hearing her describe it. Her understanding of what her teams are doing is minimal at best; she frequently makes requests that are completely incoherent and inapplicable. She treats engineers as commodities in a way that is dehumanising, reassigning people against their will in ways that have no relationship to their skill set. She is completely unable to receive constructive feedback (as in, she literally doesn't even acknowledge it). I hear other teams (who have leaders more politically savvy than I) have learned how to "handle" her to keep her off their backs, feeding her just the right information at the right time. Having seen Google at its best, I find this new reality depressing.</p>

<p>There are still great people at Google. I've had the privilege to work with amazing people on the Flutter team such as JaYoung Lee, Kate Lovett, Kevin Chisholm, Zoey Fan, Dan Field, and dozens more (sorry folks, I know I should just name all of you but there's too many!). In recent years I started offering career advice to anyone at Google and through that met many great folks from around the company. It's definitely not too late to heal Google. It would require some shake-up at the top of the company, moving the centre of power from the CFO's office back to someone with a clear long-term vision for how to use Google's extensive resources to deliver value to users. I still believe there's lots of mileage to be had from Google's mission statement (<q lang="en-US">to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful</q>). Someone who wanted to lead Google into the next twenty years, maximising the good to humanity and disregarding the short-term fluctuations in stock price, could channel the skills and passion of Google into truly great achievements.</p>

<p>I do think the clock is ticking, though. The deterioration of Google's culture will eventually become irreversible, because the kinds of people whom you need to act as moral compass are the same kinds of people who don't join an organisation without a moral compass.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="http://russbishop.net/github-renamed-me">http://russbishop.net/github-renamed-me</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38380344">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>In preparation for <a href="http://www.russbishop.net/contextlocal-t">a new post</a>, I logged in to GitHub recently. I created my account two years ago in anticipation of being able to open-source more code and I wanted to reserve my name; I had a couple of forked repos but that's it. A new baby and a wife with major back surgery will do that to you. </p>

<p>Imagine my surprise when I logged in today and found that my account had been renamed. No longer was I known as <code>github.com/rbishop</code>. Instead, I was now relegated to <code>github.com/rbishop-xx</code>. </p>

<p>How <em>curious</em>.</p>

<p>I next noticed a warning about verifying my SSH key. </p>

<p><em>"Why self, I don't remember uploading an SSH key just yet"</em></p>

<p><em>"Well self, that's because you <strong>haven't</strong>"</em></p>

<p>Now I was even more <em>curious</em>. Had my account been hacked? Had I made a mistake somewhere? That's when I checked Account Settings, Security, Security History and behold two months ago:</p>

<p><img alt="Silvrback blog image" src="https://silvrback.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/5e13d149-5362-4336-b603-bdb6887d46f4/githubrename_large.png"></p>

<p><img alt="Silvrback blog image" src="https://silvrback.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/e29665d2-2220-4d46-88c3-3b0cd4be4bcd/rathjenc_key_large.png"></p>

<p>Whoever this <em>rathjenc</em> character was, he had not only renamed my account but <strong>he uploaded an SSH key, thus allowing him to modify my repos at-will.</strong></p>

<p>Just who was this rathjenc fellow?</p>

<p><img alt="Silvrback blog image" src="https://silvrback.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/c103f12c-1287-4fe3-ad03-984b35d258e5/rathjenc_large.png"></p>

<p>Now I am merely left with questions. </p>

<p><strong>Why is an official Github representative renaming accounts and modifying people's SSH keys without so much as an email to the account holder?</strong> </p>

<p>There is now a new owner of the <code>rbishop</code> name: Richard B; is he a friend of Chris? Was Chris doing his buddy a favor by kicking me off? </p>

<p>Or perhaps it's because Richard B is a member of their Developer program. Maybe people who pay more or develop Github integrations have priority on names?</p>

<p>Maybe it's just policy that you can take someone else's name if you ask <em>real nice</em> ?</p>

<p>Whatever the case, I certainly couldn't find any documentation of this forced-renaming policy on Github's website, and as we all know they're a professional organization. <a href="http://recode.net/2014/03/15/prominent-github-engineer-julie-ann-horvath-quits-claiming-gender-based-harassment/">They certainly don't have founder's non-employee wives running around intimidating employees.</a> </p>

<p>As I said earlier, how <em>curious</em>.</p>

<h2 id="link">1 Clickable link</h2>

<p>These techniques protect a clickable link that will open the user’s mail client (e.g. <a href="mailto:email@example.com">email</a>).
The link text is expected to be generic; if the <i>email address</i> appears in the link text, then the email address is additionally exposed as plain text, and you’ll need to layer on the <a href="#text">plain-text</a> obfuscation techniques.</p>


<h3 id="link-url">1.1 URL encoding</h3>
<p>Blocked 100% of spam</p>

<code>&lt;<span>a</span> <span>href</span>=<wbr><span>"mailto:<wbr><span id="link-url-output">%65<wbr>%6d<wbr>%61<wbr>%69<wbr>%6c<wbr>%40<wbr>%65<wbr>%78<wbr>%61<wbr>%6d<wbr>%70<wbr>%6c<wbr>%65<wbr>%2e<wbr>%63<wbr>%6f<wbr>%6d</span>"</span>&gt;<wbr>email<wbr>&lt;/<span>a</span>&gt;</code>
<p><label for="link-url-input">email:</label></p>

<p>This is based on a small sample size: just six bots that were observed over a one-year period.
Of those bots, <i>half</i> were able to decode HTML entitites, and URL-decoding is just as easy, so caution is advised.</p>


<h3 id="link-entity">1.2 HTML entities</h3>
<p>Blocked 50% of spam</p>

<code>&lt;<span>a</span> <span>href</span>=<wbr><span>"&amp;#109;<wbr>&amp;#97;<wbr>&amp;#105;<wbr>&amp;#108;<wbr>&amp;#116;<wbr>&amp;#111;<wbr>&amp;#58;<wbr><span id="link-entity-output">&amp;#101;<wbr>&amp;#109;<wbr>&amp;#97;<wbr>&amp;#105;<wbr>&amp;#108;<wbr>&amp;#64;<wbr>&amp;#101;<wbr>&amp;#120;<wbr>&amp;#97;<wbr>&amp;#109;<wbr>&amp;#112;<wbr>&amp;#108;<wbr>&amp;#101;<wbr>&amp;#46;<wbr>&amp;#99;<wbr>&amp;#111;<wbr>&amp;#109;</span>"</span>&gt;<wbr>email<wbr>&lt;/<span>a</span>&gt;</code>
<p><label for="link-entity-input">email:</label></p>


<h3 id="link-none">1.3 No protection</h3>
<p>Blocked 17% of spam</p>

<code>&lt;<span>a</span> <span>href</span>=<wbr><span>"mailto:<wbr><span id="link-none-output">email<wbr>@example<wbr>.com</span>"</span>&gt;<wbr>email<wbr>&lt;/<span>a</span>&gt;</code>
<p><label for="link-none-input">email:</label></p>

<p>Surprisingly, the unprotected email address appears to have blocked a spam email.
Either that message wasn’t received, or an extra message was sent to one of the protected email addresses.</p>


<h3 id="link-concatenation">1.4 Concatenation</h3>
<p><i>Still testing</i> <span>JS</span></p>

<code>&lt;<span>script</span>&gt;<wbr>document<wbr>.write(<wbr>'&lt;a href="mailto:'<wbr>+<span id="link-concatenation-output">'e'+<wbr>'m'+<wbr>'a'+<wbr>'i'+<wbr>'l'+<wbr>'@'+<wbr>'e'+<wbr>'x'+<wbr>'a'+<wbr>'m'+<wbr>'p'+<wbr>'l'+<wbr>'e'+<wbr>'.'+<wbr>'c'+<wbr>'o'+<wbr>'m'</span>+'"&gt;email&lt;/a&gt;'<wbr>);<wbr>&lt;/<span>script</span>&gt;</code>
<p><label for="link-concatenation-input">email:</label></p>

<p>This is convenient because it has no external dependencies, but it is easily broken, even by bots that don’t interpret JavaScript.</p>


<h3 id="link-rot18">1.5 Rot18</h3>
<p><i>Still testing</i> <span>JS</span></p>

<code>&lt;<span>head</span>&gt;
	&lt;<span>script</span> <span>src</span>=<wbr><span>"js/<a href="https://spencermortensen.com/articles/email-obfuscation/src/link-rot18.js">email.js</a>"</span> <span>defer</span>&gt;<wbr>&lt;/<span>script</span>&gt;
&lt;/<span>head</span>&gt;</code>
<code>&lt;<span>a</span> <span>class</span>=<wbr><span>"email"</span> <span>href</span>=<wbr><span>"znvygb:<wbr><span id="link-rot18-output">rznvy<wbr>@rknzcyr<wbr>.pbz</span>"</span>&gt;<wbr>email<wbr>&lt;/<span>a</span>&gt;</code>
<p><label for="link-rot18-input">email:</label></p>

<p>This has an external dependency and can <i>still</i> be broken by bots that don’t interpret JavaScript.
At the very least, you should change the lengths of the rotation cycles (see the source code).</p>


<h3 id="link-xor">1.6 Xor</h3>

	<!-- .entry-header -->

	
		<div data-first_letter="I">
		<p>If you read the initial reviews of Apple’s new M3-based Macs, you’d be forgiven for thinking little had changed in their CPU cores, apart from a rejigging of numbers and an increase in the maximum frequency of their P cores. As my MacBook Pro 16-inch M3 Pro arrived three days early, this article presents a tentative first look at what has changed in their CPU cores, and from that, how you might choose the right chip for your next Apple silicon Mac. Like Apple, I’m going to make comparison between M1 and M3 chips, as in most respects discussed here, M2 CPU cores didn’t change as much from those in the M1, and I’ve had and tested four different M1 models.</p>
<h4>Cluster size</h4>
<p>The most obvious difference between M1/M2 CPU cores and those in M3 chips is in the size of their clusters. In M1 and M2 chips, CPU cores are grouped into clusters of 2 or 4, within which cores share L2 cache and run at the same frequency. In M3 chips (certainly the M3 Pro, and I understand the M3 Max as well) clusters are composed of 4 (M3 basic) or 6 (Pro and Max).</p>
<p>This change has impact on chip selection.</p>
<p>macOS tries to allocate threads running at higher priorities, as set by their Quality of Service (QoS), to P cores whenever possible. This is what we want, as it ensures that the apps we’re running deliver best performance, albeit at higher power consumption. When the P cores are already fairly fully occupied, macOS may instead run high QoS threads on the E cores. While it has compensatory mechanisms for doing this (see below), it may mean that those threads run more slowly than we’d want.</p>
<p>If you already have an Apple silicon Mac and are wondering whether to upgrade to an M3 model, then you can use this as a way of working out which chip you’ll need. Load your current Mac up with the apps you normally use together when working, and watch their use in Activity Monitor’s CPU History window. If its P cores are fully occupied much of the time, and that workload often spills over to the E cores, then you should aim for an M3 with more P cores; if there’s always adequate spare capacity on the Mac’s P cores, then you probably wouldn’t get much added value from an M3 with more P cores.</p>
<p>This changed cluster size in M3 chips is significant, as it could not only have effects on performance, but also on power use. When running at full pelt, all six P cores in an M3 Pro cluster can use as much as 5.5 W, while six in an M1 Pro will use about 5.8 W.</p>
<h4>E cores</h4>
<p>From my preliminary measurements, E cores in an M3 Pro differ little from those in an M1 Pro, except for their frequency management, which is determined by macOS. M1 E cores have a maximum frequency of 2064 MHz, while those in M3 chips reach 2748 MHz. But, when running low QoS threads in the M1 Pro chip, E core frequency is set to 972 MHz, and that in the M3 Pro is 744 MHz, giving a ratio of 1.3 for M1/M3. Integer, floating point, NEON and Accelerate performance at those frequencies matches the difference in frequency, at 1.3-1.4. That means the M3’s E cores run background threads slightly more slowly than the M1 because macOS sets their frequency lower.</p>
<p>That isn’t true, though, when the E cores are being used to run high QoS threads that couldn’t be accommodated on P cores. Those are run at maximum frequency, which favours the M3 Pro by a factor of 1.3.</p>
<p>Replacing an M1 Pro with an M3 Pro thus slows background tasks, but accelerates high QoS tasks that have overflowed onto the E cores.</p>
<h4>P cores</h4>
<p>There are greater differences between the P cores in an M1 Pro and those in an M3 Pro. M1 P cores have a maximum frequency of 3228 MHz, while M3 P cores run up to a maximum of 4056 MHz, a ratio of 1.26 in favour of the M3. A similar ratio is seen for integer and floating point performance, at 1.30 and 1.28 respectively, but vector performance using NEON or Apple’s Accelerate library is faster still on the M3 Pro P core, at ratios of 1.67 and 1.63.</p>
<p>This suggests that improved integer and floating point performance is largely (if not completely) the result of increased core frequency, but that there are likely to be further improvements in vector processing. Perhaps Apple has improved the design of the NEON unit in M3 P cores.</p>
<h4>P v E</h4>
<p>Aside from any improvement in vector processing in M3 P cores, M1 and M3 cores show different patterns of performance under load. These are perhaps clearest in the two charts below. Loads were applied using AsmAttic, which here runs tight loops of floating point arithmetic that remains in-core, accessing only registers and not memory. These charts show the time taken to complete one or more threads, each running 200 million loops of assembly code. Each thread is run as if on a single core at 100% active residency, i.e. it’s one core’s worth of performance, so 6 threads will fully load a 6-core P cluster.</p>

<p>This chart shows the total time to complete running all the threads, by the number of threads (effectively the number of cores), for an M1 Pro in red, and an M3 Pro in black. These threads were all run at maximum QoS (33), so were run preferentially on P cores. Those run on the 8 P cores in an M1 Pro (red) show a near-perfect linear relationship, with each thread fully occupying one core for a period of 1.3 seconds.</p>
<p>The lower black line shows equivalent results for the 6 P and 6 E cores in an M3 Pro. For 1-6 threads, these were all run on its P cores, then on an increasing number of its E cores as well. That is quite linear up to 6 threads, where the time taken is significantly less than that of the M1 Pro. By 6 threads, that difference is over 1 second; in the time the M1 Pro took to run 5 threads, the M3 Pro had almost completed 6.</p>
<p>From 6-8 threads, the two lines run in parallel, indicating that the M3 E cores were delivering similar performance to the P cores in the M1 Pro. You wouldn’t want to run more than 8 threads, though, on the 8P + 2E cores of the M1 Pro, as they would risk displacing background threads on the two E cores. On the M3 Pro, you can go safely up to a total of 10 threads, on 6 P and 4 E cores, without compromising background threads. Indeed, because the E cluster is running at maximum frequency, background tasks might even complete more quickly under that load.</p>

<p>Differences are reversed when running low QoS threads on the E cores, as shown here, again with the 2 E cores of the M1 Pro in red, and the 6 E cores of the M3 Pro in black.</p>
<p>The frequency of the M1 Pro E cores is increased when they’re running a second thread, which accounts for the small change in total time from 1-2 threads. However, with more than 2 threads, further threads are queued, and performance suffers as a result. The 6 E cores of the M3 Pro have three times the capacity for background threads, and although running them more slowly, they cope with up to 6 threads, beyond which those threads are queued, and the time required to complete them rises more rapidly.</p>
<h4>CPU History</h4>
<p>The most accessible window you have on core load and performance is CPU History in Activity Monitor. Although it can cast light on the use of different types of core, and help you decide whether your next Mac needs more cores, it’s also seriously misleading, as shown in the screenshot below.</p>

<p>This shows what happened during two tests using my app AsmAttic: in the first, responsible for the large blocks of green in the E cores, I ran a load of 6 threads at low QoS; in the second, reflected in the much narrower blocks for the P cores below, I ran the same load of 6 threads on the P cores. When the E cores were fully loaded, their frequency was 744 MHz, that’s only a little above their idle, but when the P cores were fully loaded, they were running at close to their maximum at just under 4000 MHz. This persistent failure in Activity Monitor to take core frequency into account gives seriously misleading impressions.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<ul>
<li>There’s much more to comparing CPU cores than multi-core benchmarks.</li>
<li>If you already have an Apple silicon Mac, observe patterns of use of P and E cores during normal use to determine whether you need a Mac with more cores.</li>
<li>CPU core cluster size has changed in M3 chips, from 2-4 to 4-6, which is likely to have extensive effects on performance and power use.</li>
<li>M3 E cores appear similar to those in the M1, but have a higher maximum frequency, and are run at lower frequency for background tasks.</li>
<li>M3 P cores appear to have improved performance in the vector (NEON) unit, and have a higher maximum frequency.</li>
<li>Increased E core count increases the capacity to accommodate overflow of high QoS threads from P cores.</li>

<p>With currently reviewing the HP Z6 G5 A workstation powered by the new 96-core <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/review/amd-linux-threadripper-pro-7995wx">AMD Ryzen Threadripper PRO 7995WX</a> Zen 4 processor, one of the areas I was curious about was how well HP's tuned Microsoft Windows 11 compares to that of Linux. In this article is looking at how the Microsoft Windows 11 performance is out-of-the-box with the HP Z6 G5 A workstation as configured by HP versus a clean install of Ubuntu 23.10 with the Linux 6.5 kernel.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.phoronix.com/image-viewer.php?id=threadripper-7995wx-windows-linux&amp;image=threadripper_windows_1_lrg" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=threadripper-7995wx-windows-linux&amp;image=threadripper_windows_1_med" alt="Windows 11 on Threadripper PRO 7995WX"></a></p>
<p>Going back to the original AMD Ryzen Threadripper processors, Linux has long possessed a performance lead over Microsoft Windows. With Linux typically being the dominant OS of HPC systems and other large core count servers, the Linux kernel scheduler has coped better than various flavors of Windows when dealing with high core count processors. Paired with some early Windows issues that Microsoft and AMD has since worked through. Linux has gained a reputation of handling these HEDT systems better than Windows.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.phoronix.com/image-viewer.php?id=threadripper-7995wx-windows-linux&amp;image=threadripper_windows_3_lrg" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=threadripper-7995wx-windows-linux&amp;image=threadripper_windows_3_med" alt="AMD Ryzen Threadripper PRO 7995WX processor"></a></p>
<p>In being curious about the difference for these new Zen 4 Threadrippers and now being able to push things to the extreme with the Threadripper PRO 7995WX 96-core / 192-thread processor, I set out for some fresh benchmarks. The HP Z6 G5 A review unit was preloaded with Microsoft Windows 11 Pro as configured by HP and so it makes for a nice perspective of looking at the Windows performance as validated by the hardware vendor. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.phoronix.com/image-viewer.php?id=threadripper-7995wx-windows-linux&amp;image=threadripper_windows_2_lrg" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=threadripper-7995wx-windows-linux&amp;image=threadripper_windows_2_med" alt="Windows 11 on Threadripper PRO 7995WX"></a></p>
<p>After running through all of the Windows benchmarks of tests relevant to HEDT/workstations and that work similarly on Windows and Linux, I then set out to do the Linux benchmarks. Ubuntu 23.10 was run for providing a clean, out-of-the-box look at this common desktop/workstation Linux distribution. Benchmarks of other Linux distributions will come in time in follow-up Phoronix articles. But for the most part the Ubuntu 23.10 performance should be largely similar to that of other modern Linux distributions with the exception of Intel's Clear Linux that takes things to the extreme or those doing non-default tinkering to their Linux installations.</p>
<p><img type="image/svg+xml" width="100%" height="auto" src="https://phoronix.com/benchmark/result/amd-ryzen-threadripper-pro-7995wx---windows-11-vs-ubuntu-linux/result.svgz" alt="AMD Ryzen Threadripper PRO 7995WX - Windows 11 vs. Ubuntu Linux"></p>
<p>The HP Z6 G5 A for all testing was configured with the Ryzen Threadripper PRO 7995WX at default frequencies, 8 x 16GB DDR5-5200 Hynix RDIMMs, Samsung MZVL21T0HCLR-00BH1 NVMe SSD, NVIDIA GeForce RTX A4000 16GB graphics. A full review on the HP Z6 G5 A Threadripper workstation will be published in a separate article on Phoronix in early December.</p>
<p>From there the up-to-date Windows 11 Pro Build 22631 (H2'23) was tested against Ubuntu 23.10 with its stable release updates. Let's see how Windows and Ubuntu Linux perform on this 96-core / 192-thread Zen 4 workstation with 128GB of RAM.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Language models only really need to use an exponential fraction of their neurons for individual inferences. As proof, we present UltraFastBERT, a BERT variant that uses 0.3% of its neurons during inference while performing on par with similar BERT models. UltraFastBERT selectively engages just 12 out of 4095 neurons for each layer inference. This is achieved by replacing feedforward networks with fast feedforward networks (FFFs). While no truly efficient implementation currently exists to unlock the full acceleration potential of conditional neural execution, we provide high-level CPU code achieving 78x speedup over the optimized baseline feedforward implementation, and a PyTorch implementation delivering 40x speedup over the equivalent batched feedforward inference. We publish our training code, benchmarking setup, and model weights.

<p><a href="https://watabou.itch.io/cave-generator">Watabou’s Cave Generator</a> is one in a series of RPG-ready map generators that Watabou has created over the years. <a href="https://watabou.itch.io/">All his work</a> oozes style, but the cave generator was always the one I found most mysterious.</p>



<p>I discovered that the entire thing was exported with extremely readable javascript, so naturally I started to poke and prod. Let’s go over how it works.</p>












<p>We’ll focus on how this map is generated for version 2.0.2:</p>





<h2><span id="Getting_started"></span>Getting started<span></span></h2>



<p>The main thing to initialize are tags. These are randomly picked, but can also be set by the user.</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="285" height="300" src="https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/tags-285x300.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/tags-285x300.png 285w, https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/tags.png 550w" sizes="(max-width: 285px) 100vw, 285px"></figure></div>


<p>Tags control the later generation steps. Sometimes they switch between different algorithms, but more commonly they act as presets for numeric parameters. I’ll refer to tags <kbd>like this</kbd> when they are referenced. Some tags are mutually exclusive – e.g. only one of <kbd>small</kbd> / <kbd>medium</kbd> / <kbd>large</kbd> can be chosen.</p>



<p>Some other global parameters are randomly chosen at the start, such as chamber size and connectedness preference for area growth. This gives each dungeon a more consistent feel across the map.</p>



<p>Like all procedural generators, there is a seed parameter that controls all sources of randomness. This enables permalinks for maps by storing the seed.</p>



<h2><span id="The_hidden_grid"></span>The hidden grid<span></span></h2>



<p>It’s not obvious, but in fact everything in the generator is done on a hex grid. Let’s see the final output again, this time with all the graphical details turned off – no wobbly lines, no random rocks, no water, no superimposed square gridlines.</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="891" src="https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_6-1024x891.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_6-1024x891.png 1024w, https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_6-300x261.png 300w, https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_6-768x668.png 768w, https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_6-1536x1337.png 1536w, https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_6-2048x1783.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>


<p>Now you can see the actual specifics of the map. But how is the layout actually achieved?</p>



<h2><span id="Grid_To_Mesh"></span>Grid To Mesh<span></span></h2>



<p>After creating the hex grid, it is immediately converted into a data structure called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubly_connected_edge_list">Doubly connected edge list</a>, which is essentially a fancy way of representing a mesh of polygons and their neighbours. Everything in the generator operates on this mesh data structure – it’s not tied to hexes at all. I was able to hack in square grids without much difficulty, the author just didn’t find a use for this feature.</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="252" height="300" src="https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/square_cave_generator-252x300.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/square_cave_generator-252x300.png 252w, https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/square_cave_generator-768x914.png 768w, https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/square_cave_generator.png 835w" sizes="(max-width: 252px) 100vw, 252px"><figcaption>An output created using a square grid</figcaption></figure></div>


<h2><span id="Seed_Growth"></span>Seed Growth<span></span></h2>



<p>The majority of the map is generated with an algorithm called seed growth<sup data-fn="8b84f512-06eb-431d-9cd4-7fa20b515d17"><a href="#8b84f512-06eb-431d-9cd4-7fa20b515d17" id="8b84f512-06eb-431d-9cd4-7fa20b515d17-link">1</a></sup>. It picks a random starting location and then adds adjacent cells at random until a predetermined size has been met. This is then repeated to give several areas. Areas are not permitted to touch each other. </p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="891" src="https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_1-1024x891.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_1-1024x891.png 1024w, https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_1-300x261.png 300w, https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_1-768x668.png 768w, https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_1-1536x1337.png 1536w, https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_1-2048x1783.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>


<p>Most of the details of the generation are determined by tags:</p>



<p>The number of areas is 9-19 for a <kbd>large</kbd> map, 3-8 for a <kbd>medium</kbd> and 2-3 for a <kbd>small</kbd>. If no tags are present has a 1 in 20 chance of picking 2 or 20, otherwise it uses a random formula.</p>



<p>The size of each area is also a random function. For <kbd>hub</kbd> generations, there is one area of size 60-79, and other areas of size 8-13. For <kbd>chamber</kbd>, a random chamber size is chosen between 11-14, and then each area is randomly offset from that by 0-2. And for <kbd>burrow</kbd>, it uses formula <code>10 + 80 * pow((rand() + rand() + rand()) / 3, 3)</code> which gives rooms around size 23, but occasionally much larger.</p>



<p>When choosing which cell to add to the area, they are weighted differently according to various algorithms. By default, it weights each cell as <code>pow(c, gamma)</code> where c is the number of adjacent cells already in the area, and gamma is a random variable indicating the preference for connection. High gamma tends to cause rounder areas with fewer jutting pieces. <kbd>cavities</kbd> fixes the gamma of 6, while <kbd>coral</kbd> uses a negative gamma so each area prefers narrow tendrils. <kbd>chaotic</kbd> prefers cells with 2 connections.</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="300" height="250" src="https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_coral-300x250.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_coral-300x250.png 300w, https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_coral-1024x853.png 1024w, https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_coral-768x640.png 768w, https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_coral-1536x1280.png 1536w, https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_coral.png 1777w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"><figcaption><kbd>coral</kbd> is probably the most distinctive style.</figcaption></figure></div>


<h2><span id="Building_doorways"></span>Building doorways<span></span></h2>



<p>Now its time to connect up all the areas. First, the algorithm identifies all cells that border two elements.</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="891" src="https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_2-1024x891.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_2-1024x891.png 1024w, https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_2-300x261.png 300w, https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_2-768x668.png 768w, https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_2-1536x1337.png 1536w, https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_2-2048x1783.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>


<p>The possible area-pairs are then culled. For <kbd>tree</kbd>, a simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search">depth first search</a> ensures each area is only reachable a single way (no loops). For <kbd>connected</kbd>, if it finds 3 areas all adjacent, it disconnects one pair. Otherwise, all pairs are kept.</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="891" src="https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_3-1024x891.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_3-1024x891.png 1024w, https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_3-300x261.png 300w, https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_3-768x668.png 768w, https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_3-1536x1337.png 1536w, https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_3-2048x1783.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>


<p>For each pair, a single door cell is randomly chosen from amongst the possibilities and added to the map.</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="891" src="https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_5-1024x891.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_5-1024x891.png 1024w, https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_5-300x261.png 300w, https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_5-768x668.png 768w, https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_5-1536x1337.png 1536w, https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_5-2048x1783.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>


<h2><span id="Building_Corridors"></span>Building Corridors<span></span></h2>



<p>Some areas are randomly chosen to shrink to corridors. It prefers areas with a large number of doors for the area, and some tags, particularly <kbd>burrows</kbd>, greatly increase the chances.</p>



<p>To shrink an area, points are repeatedly removed, and flood-fill is used to ensure that the doors are all still connected, which I describe more in <a href="https://www.boristhebrave.com/2022/03/20/chiseled-paths-revisited/">Chiseled Paths Revisited</a>.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="891" src="https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_6-1024x891.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_6-1024x891.png 1024w, https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_6-300x261.png 300w, https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_6-768x668.png 768w, https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_6-1536x1337.png 1536w, https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_6-2048x1783.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>At this point, exits are chosen too, which are randomly selected from eligible border cells. Cells further from the center get higher weights. The exact number of exits can be controlled with tags <kbd>sealed</kbd>, <kbd>entrance</kbd>, <kbd>passage</kbd>, <kbd>junction</kbd>.</p>



<h2><span id="Water"></span>Water<span></span></h2>



<p>The water is simply an independent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise">Perlin noise</a>, which is compared against a threshold. It’s more obvious in v2.1.0, where you can play with a slider.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="602" height="662" src="https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_water_anim.gif" alt=""></figure>



<h2><span id="Rough_outlines"></span>Rough outlines<span></span></h2>



<p>The hexagonal nature of the walls is hidden via several steps:</p>



<ul>
<li>Every edge is subdivided</li>



<li>The outline is smoothed (“bumpiness”)</li>



<li>Vertices in corridors are moved towards the face center.</li>



<li>The points are randomly offset (“irregularity”)</li>



<li>Two more iterations of subdivision and randomness (“roughness”)</li>



<li>The boundary is converted to curves with <a href="https://observablehq.com/@pamacha/chaikins-algorithm">Chaikin’s Algorithm</a> (not shown in gif)</li>
</ul>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1077" height="746" src="https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_geometry.gif" alt=""></figure>



<h2><span id="Cosmetics"></span>Cosmetics<span></span></h2>



<p>Some random small polygons are dropped on the map to make stones and rubble. <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/hatching-in-1pdg-31716880">Dyson hatching</a> is applied near the boundary.</p>



<h2><span id="Title"></span>Title<span></span></h2>



<p>The title of each map is generated using a <a href="https://tracery.io/">Tracery</a> script. Many features contribute to the choices – “demonic” names are more likely for certain tags, and the presence of water increases the chance of damp names like “Bog”.</p>



<p>The top-level rule gives you an idea of what it’s like:</p>



<pre><code>	"name" : [
		"#compound_noun# #noun#",
		"#adj# #noun#",
		"0.2?-#noun# of #fantasy#",
		"!LARGE&amp;0.2?-#person#'s #noun#",
		"!SMALL&amp;0.1?-#noun# of #epic_noun#"],</code></pre>



<h2><span id="Glade_Mode"></span>Glade Mode<span></span></h2>



<p>Glade mode re-purposes the entire generator for making forest clearings. The main differences are the trees randomly drawn along the border, and the name generator switches to a different script. I love how you can switch it on and see the same map completely re-interpreted.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="891" src="https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_glade-1024x891.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_glade-1024x891.png 1024w, https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_glade-300x261.png 300w, https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_glade-768x668.png 768w, https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_glade-1536x1337.png 1536w, https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_glade-2048x1783.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<h2><span id="Summary"></span>Summary<span></span></h2>



<p>Oleg’s generator illustrates a common maxim in procedural generation. Great results don’t come from applying a super advanced algorithm, but rather by combining several simple rules effectively, and with an eye to the look and style you are aiming for.</p>



<p>In my opinion, Some of the rules used here, notably seed growth, and path chiseling offer a nice balance of simplicity to useful results and are generally underappreciated as techniques.</p>


<ol><li id="8b84f512-06eb-431d-9cd4-7fa20b515d17">We’ve seen “seed growth” before in my <a href="https://www.boristhebrave.com/2020/09/12/dungeon-generation-in-binding-of-isaac/">Binding of Isaac</a> article. But there’s no widely known name for this technique that I’m aware of.  <a href="#8b84f512-06eb-431d-9cd4-7fa20b515d17-link" aria-label="Jump to footnote reference 1">↩︎</a></li></ol>			</div><!-- .entry-content -->

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Federal Trade Commission has approved an omnibus resolution authorizing the use of compulsory process in nonpublic investigations involving&nbsp;products and services that use or claim to be produced using artificial intelligence (AI) or claim to detect its use.</p>

<p><span><span><span>The omnibus resolution will streamline FTC staff’s ability to </span></span></span><span><span><span>issue civil investigative demands (CIDs), which are a form of compulsory process similar to a subpoena</span></span></span>, in investigations relating to AI, while retaining the Commission’s authority to determine when CIDs are issued. The FTC issues CIDs to obtain documents, information and testimony that advance FTC consumer protection and competition investigations. The omnibus resolution will be in effect for 10 years.</p>

<p>AI includes, but is not limited to, machine-based systems that can, for a set of defined objectives, make predictions, recommendations, or decisions influencing real or virtual environments. Generative AI can be used to generate synthetic content including images, videos, audio, text, and other digital content that appear to be created by humans. Many companies now offer products and services using AI and generative AI, while others offer products and services that claim to detect content made by generative AI.</p>

<p>Although AI, including generative AI, offers many beneficial uses, it can also be used to engage in fraud, deception, infringements on privacy, and other unfair practices, which may violate the FTC Act and other laws. At the same time, AI can raise competition issues in a variety of ways, including if one or just a few companies control the essential inputs or technologies that underpin AI.</p>

<p>The Commission voted 3-0 to approve the omnibus resolution&nbsp;authorizing compulsory process in investigations related to the use of AI.</p>

<p>The lead FTC staffers on this matter are Nadine Samter and Ben Halpern-Meekin in the FTC’s Northwest Region office.</p>

              <p>AUSTIN, Texas — Scientists have discovered that bacteria can create something like memories about when to form strategies that can cause dangerous infections in people, such as resistance to antibiotics and bacterial swarms when millions of bacteria come together on a single surface. The discovery — which has potential applications for preventing and combatting bacterial infections and addressing antibiotic-resistant bacteria — relates to a common chemical element bacterial cells can use to form and pass along these memories to their progeny over later generations.</p>
<p>Researchers at The University of Texas at Austin found that E. coli bacteria use iron levels as a way to store information about different behaviors that can then be activated in response to certain stimuli.</p>
<p>The findings are published in the <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2309082120"><em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em></a>.</p>
<p>Scientists had previously observed that bacteria that had a prior experience of swarming (moving on a surface as a collective using flagella) improve subsequent swarming performance. &nbsp;The UT-led research team set out to learn why. Bacteria don’t have neurons, synapses or nervous systems, so any memories are not like the ones of blowing out candles at a childhood birthday party. They are more like information stored on a computer.</p>
<p>“Bacteria don’t have brains, but they can gather information from their environment, and if they have encountered that environment frequently, they can store that information and quickly access it later for their benefit,” said Souvik Bhattacharyya, the lead author and a provost early career fellow in the Department of Molecular Biosciences at UT.</p>
<p>It all comes back to iron, one of the most abundant elements on Earth. Singular and free-floating bacteria have varying levels of iron. Scientists observed that bacterial cells with lower levels of iron were better swarmers. In contrast, bacteria that formed biofilms, dense, sticky mats of bacteria on solid surfaces, had high levels of iron in their cells. Bacteria with antibiotic tolerance also had balanced levels of iron. These iron memories persist for at least four generations and disappear by the seventh generation.</p>

<p>“Before there was oxygen in the Earth’s atmosphere, early cellular life was utilizing iron for a lot of cellular processes. Iron is not only critical in the origin of life on Earth, but also in the evolution of life,” Bhattacharyya said. “It makes sense that cells would utilize it in this way.”</p>
<p>Researchers theorize that when iron levels are low, bacterial memories are triggered to form a fast-moving migratory swarm to seek out iron in the environment. When iron levels are high, memories indicate this environment is a good place to stick around and form a biofilm.</p>
<p>“Iron levels are definitely a target for therapeutics because iron is an important factor in virulence,” Bhattacharyya said. “Ultimately, the more we know about bacterial behavior, the easier it is combat them.”</p>
<p>The research was funded by the National Institutes of Health. Rasika Harshey, a professor of molecular biosciences and Mary M. Betzner Morrow Centennial Chair in Microbiology, is the senior corresponding author on the paper. Nabin Bhattarai, Dylan M. Pfannenstiel and Brady Wilkins, along with Abhyudai Singh of University of Delaware, also contributed to the research.</p>

Readers don't like adverts, and they like being tracked around the web even less. It's not great for publishers either - they need huge amounts of traffic, and associated ad clicks to make producing content worthwhile.</p><p>One solution is for publishers to erect a hard paywall. This means that if you want to read <em>any </em>articles on a website, you have to have a subscription and log into the site. Nothing and no-one can get past without a subscription. There are some sites that require you to create a 'free' account to make it easier to target and track your usage.</p><p>There are a few websites that operate this way. <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">The Times</a> is notably one hard holdout. While publishers using hard paywalls often have a more reliable revenue stream, there are disadvantages to operating a completely solid paywall. Search engines can't access your content, which means that your SEO is shot.</p><p>Soft paywalls operate differently, and whether or not, and how they allow you to view content depends on factors such as how many articles you've viewed this month, whether you're a bot, the source of your click, and other such metrics.</p><p>Click through from the wrong source, have the wrong user agent string, or read too many gift articles? Tough shit. It's time to buy a raft of subscriptions. Unless, of course, the articles are so-called 'buyers guides', lists of tech you can buy, best-of reviews, or other such crappy content designed to shift stock through affiliate links. In this case, you can probably read as much as you want.</p><p>The kind of paywall that shows up if your browser is using an adblock, is especially disliked.</p><h2 id="h-there-are-workarounds-for-soft-paywalls">There are workarounds for soft paywalls</h2><figure><img src="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/59/scooterman.png" alt="Someone driving past a brick wall on a scooter" width="1680" height="840" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/59/responsive/scooterman-xs.webp 300w, https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/59/responsive/scooterman-sm.webp 480w, https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/59/responsive/scooterman-md.webp 768w, https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/59/responsive/scooterman-lg.webp 1024w, https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/59/responsive/scooterman-xl.webp 1360w, https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/59/responsive/scooterman-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure><p>As soft paywalls usually kick in based on who you are, where you've come from, and what you've already read, you can fake fake some of these factors.</p><p>If you want to read a Financial Times article, for instance, you'll need to set your browser user agent to spoof as googlebot - or just go and read Google's cached version.</p><p>For other sites, you have to stop assets being loaded from certain domains or subdomains.</p><p>Of course, the simplest soft paywall relies on cookies, so it's a simple thing to right-click on links, and open them in spanky new private windows, and close the window when you're done. Some sites will even let you in if you preface the URL with "<strong>https://facebook.com/l.php?u</strong>=".</p><p>There are other hacks, and we even have a spreadsheet somewhere with a list.</p><p>But it's a chore.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The experiment offered clear evidence that, in addition to other cells, “glial cells can also sense physical forces” through this mechanosensory channel, said <a href="https://www.crick.ac.uk/research/labs/vassilis-pachnis">Vassilis Pachnis</a>, the head of the nervous system development and homeostasis laboratory at the Francis Crick Institute. Then, having sensed the change in force, they can shift the activity of neural circuits to trigger muscular contractions. “It’s a wonderful piece of work,” he said.</p>
<p>Hub cells are only one of many glial subtypes that play functional roles in the gut. Scavuzzo’s new six subtypes, added to those <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32888429/">characterized in previous research</a><u>,</u> together reveal 14 known subgroups of glia across the duodenum, ileum and colon. More are likely to be discovered in coming years, each with new potential to better explain how digestion works and enable researchers to develop treatments for a variety of gastrointestinal disorders.</p>
<h2><strong>A Pain in the Gut</strong></h2>
<p>Gastrointestinal diseases often come with a dose of pain, in addition to disruptive digestive issues. Eating the wrong food, or too much of the right one, can cause a stomachache. Those gut feelings are driven by enteric nerve cells, including glia. Because glia are now known to control the activity of immune cells, they are suspected to play a role in many gastrointestinal disorders and diseases, making them good potential targets for treatments.</p>
<p>Several years ago, Pachnis and his group found that glia are among the first cell types to respond to injury or inflammation in the mouse gut, and that tampering with enteric glial cells can also create an inflammatory response. In the gut glia seem to perform roles similar to those of true immune cells, Pachnis said, and so their dysfunction can lead to chronic autoimmune disorders and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304394023002744">inflammatory bowel diseases</a>, such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease. “Glial cells definitely play a role in the initiation, the pathogenesis and the progression of the various diseases of the gut,” he said.</p>

<p>Glia are likely involved because of their central role in communicating between the microbiome, immune cells and other gut cells. Healthy glia strengthen the intestines’ epithelial barrier, a layer of cells that keeps out toxins and pathogens and absorbs nutrients. But in patients with Crohn’s disease, glial cells don’t function properly, resulting in a weaker barrier and inappropriate immune response.</p>
<p>“Different subtypes of glia can be functioning differently or dysfunctioning in a wide range of diseases and disorders where motility is impacted,” Scavuzzo said. They have also been linked to neural inflammation, hypersensitivity in the organs and even neuron death.</p>
<p>For instance, Gulbransen and his team recently discovered that <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scisignal.adg1668">glia contribute to gut pain</a> by secreting molecules that sensitize neurons. This is likely an adaptive response intended to draw the gut’s attention to damaging substances to dispose of them, Gulbransen said, which as a side effect causes pain.</p>
<p>The findings, published today in <em>Science Signaling</em>, suggest that targeting glia could help alleviate some of the pain created by inflammatory disorders of the gut.</p>

<p>Glia themselves can also become stressed by genetic problems, exposure to metabolites from the microbiome, bad diet or other factors. Fattahi has observed that, no matter the cause, stressed enteric glia influence the entire tissue, and sometimes even damage neighboring neurons or recruit immune cells, causing additional inflammation and pain.</p>
<p>These new studies in enteric glia will go a long way toward explaining many gastrointestinal disorders that researchers have struggled to understand and treat, Sharkey said. “I’m really excited to see how these cells have evolved to become central figures in enteric neurobiology over the years.”</p>
<p>It’s becoming ever clearer that the neuron doesn’t act alone in the enteric system, he added. “It’s got these beautiful partners in glia that really allow it to do its thing in the most efficient and effective way.”</p>

Why does the moon change size when you snipe it?
</h3>


<div id="post-body-654466784851103966">
<p>The artists gave me a texture for the moon in III. I placed the moon in the sky, made sure it was visible at night and that it was a reasonable size.</p><p>A few days later 4 artists were at my desk asking me to change the size of the moon.</p><p>"No problem" I said.</p><p>It turned out they couldn't decide what the size of the moon should be. 2 of them wanted it smaller to be more realistic. The other 2 wanted it larger to be more cinematic.</p><p>This went on a bit and I suggested to make the size of the moon changeable in the game. This way they could decide in their own time and let me know the conclusion. Since I was working on the sniper rifle, I made it so that the moon toggled through 3 sizes (small, medium, large) as the player sniped it.</p><p>The artists never got back to me so I just left it in. It was still there in SA.</p>

<div>
<p>
There was a 6 weeks gap between finishing gta3 and the release. This was needed for burning the cd and distribution. In those days you couldn't patch so there was no point hanging around. The company gave the team some time off and most people took some extra time also. After the release, we started on Vice City. It was RockStar New York's idea to set the game in the 80s in Miami. Originally it was supposed to be a mission pack to gta3. Only once gta3 did as well as it did and Vice City started to look sufficiently different from gta3 was the decision made to make it a standalone game. This was quite far into the project. (maybe 6 months or so) We did the PC conversion of gta3 ourselves. This took the programmers about 6 months. In the mean time the artists and level designers were able to get straight onto Vice City. This worked well as there aren't that many code changes from gta3 to Vice whereas it did involve building a whole new city and new missions. The artists and l

<h3><a href="https://insiderockstarnorth.blogspot.com/2023/11/the-trouble-with-cheats.html">The trouble with cheats</a></h3>

<div>
<p>
(Warning: techy) The cheats in the trilogy were activated by simply typing a sequence of characters. On PC the sequence would be something like ILOVESCOTLAND to make it rain or GUNSGUNSGUNS to give the player loads of weapons. The game remembers the last 20 or so keypresses and every time a new key is pressed, these keypresses are compared with the cheats. If there is a match, the cheat will activate. The straightforward way of doing this would be to compare the string "ILOVESCOTLAND" with the string of keypresses. This approach would mean that the strings for the cheats would be in memory as readable text. Any hacker could easily find the cheats and they would all be discovered on the day of release. This is why I used 'hash codes' to store the cheats. A hash code is a number that is calculated from a string. As an example; a simple hash algorithm could add up the ASCII values of each character of the string. The hash code for ILOVESCOTLAND would be 983. For GUNSGUNS

Source: Wikipedia Commons</p></div><div><p><a href="https://www.cnu.org/node/9983">RAHUL  REJEEV</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOV. 13, 2023</p></div><div property="content:encoded" id="journal-main-content"><p><em>“Why don’t children leave the house?”</em></p>

<p>Childhood in America is losing its charm. The lack of effective transit, coupled with the lack of kid-friendly destinations and the feeling of more dangerous neighborhoods, means that today’s youth find it harder than ever to go outside, meet up with friends, and form more meaningful relationships.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A fundamental truth about American society is our heavy reliance on cars. The average American will spend over six months of their life behind a traffic light. American suburbs are dominated by wide streets, catering to cars and not people. Beyond the walkability concerns associated with car-centric urban planning, there's the fact that obtaining a driver’s license is only possible at the age of 16. Moreover, recent trends show a delay in teenagers’ pursuit of driver’s licenses. In 1983, 46.2 percent of 16-year-olds were licensed, compared to 25.1 percent in 2020. This shift can be partly due to the financial burdens of car ownership, insurance, and maintenance. Thus, for many young individuals, their desire to drive is overridden by these barriers.</p>

<p>Lack of mobility coupled with large distances means that kids are far from the places where they want to hang out. As described by Ray Oldenburg, “third places” are locations where locals can meet, interact, and relax in a place that isn’t their home or place of work. In these locations, kids get the chance to socialize and develop intellectually. American suburbs don’t have these places. I&nbsp; am currently a rising senior in high school in the US, here after spending my freshman and sophomore years in England. My friends and I lived within 10 minutes of each other and all the parks. It was easy to meet up, easy to be around people. We could meet at the local park and drink slushies by the neighborhood corner shop. It was a place where we could expect to see people we knew and have a chat. Our lack of a driver’s license didn’t hold us back.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>In England, housing is often characterized by closely situated semi-detached or terraced structures built under flexible zoning regulations. This environment allows small businesses to coexist harmoniously with residential areas, in contrast to the rigid industrial zoning common in the United States. Notably, green spaces and corner stores are thoughtfully incorporated into English neighborhoods, encouraging residents to step out of their homes. This foot traffic contributes to enhanced safety, aligning with Jane Jacobs' observation that more eyes on the streets cultivate secure environments. Parents are sometimes scared to let their kids go out in non-walkable environments, especially in America.</p>

<figure><img alt="" src="https://www.cnu.org/sites/default/files/Rahul_SemiDetatched%20PC%20Wikipedia%20Commons.png"><figcaption>Examples of semi-detached, terraced, and corner shop urbanism. Source: Wikipedia Commons</figcaption></figure><p>It’s said that people will walk up to five minutes, before they would rather drive. With this in mind, points of interest like small green spaces or bodega-type shops are essential to weave into suburbs. Having a small grocery shop or cafe close to&nbsp;home improves quality of life and encourages&nbsp;people&nbsp;of all ages&nbsp;to get out more. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Many American suburbs currently employ what’s called “Euclidean zoning” where land is zoned for one use, whether it be for single-family housing or industrial zones. Suburbs must move towards mixed-use zoning where housing, small businesses, offices, and parks can co-exist. Mixed zoning often enables multi-story and more high-density housing. Mixed zoning has the potential promise of creating housing for all ranges of people, an inclusive community with amenities within walking distance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Housing diversity near transit stops could help alleviate traffic. With more people within walking distance of public transport, ridership rises, increasing funding. This allows mass transport to run more often and new lines to be created, promoting&nbsp;transport system use that&nbsp;reduces&nbsp;congestion and commute times. Public transport is the only guaranteed way for a young person to be free and enjoy mobility. In England, my peers and I would ride from town to town, allowing us to meet up with people from other parts of the country at skateparks and public events. American youth don’t experience this level of freedom until they get their driver’s license and can afford a car, the maintenance, and insurance that comes with it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Through mixed-use zoning, the creation of pedestrian-friendly infrastructure, and better public transport, we can improve the lives of young people. Envision a new norm for American children, where they can more easily create friendships and interact with the broader world. With our lives becoming increasingly entrenched in the virtual world, it’s more important than ever that we create neighborhoods that make connecting with people in the physical world easy.&nbsp;</p>
