<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>iTerm2 includes built-in web browsing capabilities. Web browser sessions fit into iTerm2's existing window &gt; tab &gt; split pane hierarchy just like terminal sessions, allowing you to browse the web alongside your terminal work.</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<h3>Enabling the Browser</h3>

<ol>
<li>Install the <a href="https://iterm2.com/browser-plugin.html">browser plugin</a> to enable full functionality</li>
<li>Create a new profile</li>
<li>Go to <strong>Settings &gt; Profiles &gt; General</strong></li>
<li>Set <strong>Profile Type</strong> to <strong>Web Browser</strong></li>
</ol>


<p><strong>Note for Enterprise Users:</strong> Administrators can block the browser plugin by restricting bundle ID <code>com.googlecode.iterm2.iTermBrowserPlugin</code>.</p>

<h3>Disabling Browser Features</h3>

<p>If you prefer not to use browser features, you can completely hide them by setting <strong>Settings &gt; Advanced &gt; Enable browser-style profiles</strong> to <strong>No</strong>.</p>

<h2>Core Features</h2>

<h3>Navigation and Window Management</h3>

<ul>
<li>Browser profiles work within iTerm2's standard window/tab/split pane hierarchy.</li>
<li>Use hotkey windows, Open Quickly, navigation shortcuts, and per-session hotkeys as with terminal sessions.</li>
<li><strong>Exception:</strong> ⌘-[ and ⌘-] perform Back/Forward navigation instead of pane switching in browser sessions.</li>
<li><strong>Cmd+click</strong> opens links in new tabs.</li>
<li><strong>Cmd+Shift+click</strong> opens links in new vertical split panes.</li>
<li><strong>Cmd+Shift+Option+click</strong> opens links in new horizontal split panes.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Text and Selection</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Copy on selection</strong> works identically to terminal windows.</li>
<li><strong>Smart Selection</strong> works identically to terminal windows. Smart Selection Actions appear in the context menu.</li>
<li><strong>Copy Mode</strong> uses the same keystrokes as terminal sessions.</li>
<li><strong>Jump to Selection</strong> functions as in terminal sessions.</li>
<li><strong>Find</strong> supports regular expressions and case-sensitive search, just like in a terminal.</li>
</ul>


<h3>AI Integration</h3>

<ul>
<li>Link browser sessions to AI chat to discuss web pages.</li>
<li>Click hamburger menu → <strong>Ask AI</strong> to create a new AI chat with the reader-mode content of the current page attached.</li>
<li>Summarize, analyze, or ask questions about the current page.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Privacy and Security</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>/dev/null mode</strong> is a mode for browsing privately that prevents any data from being saved to disk.</li>
<li>Built-in popup blocking blocks popups not initiated by user action.</li>
<li>Simple ad blocking using WebKit content blocker rules (configure via hamburger menu → <strong>Settings</strong>).</li>
<li>CONNECT proxy support for proxy-based adblockers.</li>
<li>The existing password manager has been integrated. Browser passwords are stored separately from terminal passwords.</li>
<li>Password manager integration for 1Password, and LastPass will use your existing web passwords.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Remote Access</h3>

<ul>
<li>View files on remote hosts via SSH Integration using URLs like: <code>iterm2-ssh://example.com/home/user/file.jpg</code></li>
</ul>


<h2>Advanced Features</h2>

<h3>Bookmarks and Organization</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Named Marks</strong> act as bookmarks for specific page sections (right-click → Add Named Mark).</li>
<li>Standard bookmarks available via hamburger menu.</li>
<li>Named Marks and Bookmarks work with Open Quickly and the Named Marks Toolbelt tool.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Recording and History</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Instant Replay</strong> captures browser sessions using macOS Screen Capture API.</li>
<li>Like instant replay in terminal windows, the RAM limit is respected.</li>
<li><strong>Global Search</strong> can search across browser sessions.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Automation and Customization</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Key Bindings</strong> work in browser profiles (some terminal-specific actions are unavailable).</li>
<li><strong>Triggers</strong> match when pages finish loading with web-specific actions.</li>
<li><strong>Pointer bindings</strong> and <strong>Actions</strong> available, minus some terminal-specific options.</li>
<li><strong>Snippets</strong> insert text into a focused form field.</li>
<li><strong>Broadcast Input</strong> works across browser sessions.</li>
<li><strong>Advanced Paste</strong> available, minus some terminal-specific features.</li>
<li><strong>Composer</strong> functions in browser sessions.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Content Management</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Reader Mode</strong> is avilable in the hamburger menu.</li>
<li><strong>Distraction removal mode</strong> similar to Safari's is also in the hamburger menu.</li>
<li>Right-click → <strong>Remove Element</strong> to hide cookie panels or other unwanted elements.</li>
<li><strong>Shell &gt; Save Contents</strong> saves web pages with resources.</li>
<li>Basic auto-fill of form fields is available, using your contact card information.</li>
<li>Search suggestions in URL bar.</li>
<li>Automatic audio detection and muting.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Technical Details</h2>

<p>The browser is built on WKWebView and identifies as Safari to ensure compatibility with most websites.</p>

<h2>Limitations</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Python API</strong> No browser-specific APIs yet. <a href="https://iterm2.com/bugs">File a feature request</a> if you have ideas.</li>
<li><strong>Passkeys</strong> Not supported due to Apple-imposed WKWebView restrictions.</li>
<li><strong>Advanced ad blocking:</strong> Limited by Apple's resource fetching API restrictions.</li>
</ul>


<h2>About This Feature</h2>

<p>This feature exists because:
- Many iTerm2 features translate well to web browsing
- It provides a unified terminal and browser experience
- A former colleague suggested this idea in 2014 and I haven't been able to stop thinking about it.
- I am maybe having a midlife crisis and this is cheaper than a sports car.</p>

<p>While not intended as a primary browser, iTerm2's web capabilities provide a useful tool for integrated terminal and web workflows.</p>

        Nostr is an apolitical communication commons. A simple standard that defines a scalable
        architecture of clients and servers that can be used to spread information freely. Not
        controlled by any corporation or government, anyone can build on Nostr and anyone can use
        it.

        Like the internet itself: open and chaotic
      </h2>
      <p>
        Nostr embraces the chaos of the early internet—multiple kinds of data, diverse forms of user
        interaction and different clients providing their own perspectives over the same underlying
        information.

            <p>
              The client is the app that is running on your computer or phone, the server is
              whatever is running on a cloud somewhere with a domain name. In centralized platforms
              and other protocols, one client talks to a single server. In Nostr clients connect to
              many.

            <p>
              In Nostr, every user is represented by a secret number called a "key" and every
              message carries a digital "signature" that proves its authorship authorship and
              authenticity without the need for any authority to say so. This foundation of trust
              enables the decentralized broadcasting of information.

            The protocol is ownerless, relays are not
          </h2>
          <p>
            Nostr doesn't subscribe to political ideals of "free speech" — it simply recognizes that
            different people have different morals and preferences and each server, being privately
            owned, can follow their own criteria for rejecting content as they please and users are
            free to choose what to read and from where.

                harm others.

            Besides being a natural medium for a Twitter-like microblogging social network, Nostr
            can also be used for other purposes. And not only similar things like sharing
            <i>videos</i>, longform <i>articles</i>, <i>pictures</i> or <i>voice notes</i>. There
            are initiatives on Nostr for the development of sub-protocols that power
            <b>closed groups</b>, <b>decentralized wikipedia</b>, <b>couchsurfing</b>,
            <b>marketplaces</b> or <b>web annotations</b>; as well as protocols that don't use Nostr
            for the core data but as a coordination and discovery mechanism, such as
            <b>decentralized code collaboration using git</b>, <b>file hosting</b>,
            <b>torrent sharing</b> and <b>video livestreaming</b>.

            Nostr is an idea with a lot of open-source software around it and a large userbase, but
            not a finished, polished product that you can buy without stress. We're still pretty
            much in the phase where new programmers and early adopters are needed to help us refine
            the protocol flows and the user experience.

            What is a "protocol"?
          </summary>
          <div>
            <p>
              A protocol is like a common language that multiple different software can use to talk
              to each other, it's like <b>e-mail</b>, <b>HTML</b> or <b>HTTP</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
              When we say "protocol" we mean that there is no need to use a specific app in order to
              be in Nostr: there are many apps that talk the same language and can be used (mostly)
              interchangeably — and each has its own take on how to do and display things.
            </p>

            How does Nostr handle spam and unwanted content?
          </summary>
          <div>
            <p>
              In the default feed you never see any spam, because clients will only fetch
              information from people that <i>you</i> follow. In that sense no one can "push" spam
              into you.
            </p>
            <p>
              It's trickier when you want to see, for example, replies to your posts, in that case a
              client might be programmed to fetch anything that <i>claims</i> to be a reply
              <i>from anyone</i>, which might include spam.
            </p>
            <p>
              The way we can deal with it on Nostr is by restricting our area of contact with the
              spam: for example, some clients may easily decide to only display replies that come
              from people followed by people you follow. More refined strategies involve announcing
              and then only reading notes from relays known to be "safe" according to your criteria
              (could be relays that require payment, relays that do screening for humans, relays
              that only accept members of certain communities or political affiliations etc).
            </p>
            <p>
              There are no perfect solutions. But these do not exist anywhere, centralized platforms
              are also full of spam. Nostr at least isn't naïve and tries to build resiliency from
              the start.

            Will Nostr scale effectively with massive user adoption?

          <div>
            <p>
              Yes, Nostr is just a basic client-server architecture. And the fact that users can
              naturally spread among hundreds of different relays while clients can query dozens of
              relays that they're interested in at the same time means the network has a natural
              load balancer (which doesn't prevent a single relay from having its own internal load
              balancer either).
            </p>
            <p>
              Another (almost the opposite) concern that may be raised is with problems arising from
              clients having to connect to too many relays if the profiles being followed for
              whatever reason decide to spread way too much, but this shouldn't be a problem either
              because people tend to follow many accounts with similar content and these will tend
              to share relays. Still, if it happens, it's cheap for native apps to open many
              hundreds of WebSocket connections simultaneously (as they will be getting very few
              data in each of those). For web apps that isn't so hard, but we can still go up to a
              few hundreds without big problems. Regardless of any of that, in any complete enough
              app that wants to display a "following feed" it's already necessary to store events in
              a local database, and that will make all these issues easy to deal with as you can do
              the event requests in batches instead of all at once.

            What protections does Nostr offer against online harassment?
          </summary>
          <div>
            <p>
              Harassment is similar to spam in the sense that anyone can still create the undesired
              content and publish to the relays that accept them. All the techniques mentioned in
              avoiding spam can also be applied in this case, but if we're talking about specific
              individuals with a permanent identity and not only an army of bots in this case the
              problem becomes easier, as those individuals can just be blocked by their target and
              their content will vanish. Presumably friends of such target will also block, and
              creative solutions involving shared blocklists can be created such that some people
              don't even have to click the block button directly.
            </p>
            <p>
              Other approaches involving, for example, relays with restricted read (that can emulate
              "protected account"/"only friends" features seen in centralized platforms) can further
              improve this.

            Why not just use Mastodon/Fediverse?
          </summary>
          <div>
            <p>
              There are many problems with Mastodon, mostly due to the fact that it doesn't rely on
              any cryptography. Because it cannot do the multi-master approach of Nostr due to lack
              of cryptography, identities are assumed to be "owned" by the server, which is fully
              trusted by its tenants. Mastodon server owners can do all the harm centralized
              platforms can do to their underlings, which are completely helpless in case of
              misbehavior or even in the normal case where a server owner loses their server or
              decides to shut down for whatever reason.
            </p>
            <p>
              Worse than that, for many of its purported features, such as blocking or direct
              messages, users have to also trust owners of the other servers.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are also problems with reliance on the DNS system, but we don't have to talk
              about those.
            </p>
            <p>
              The most interesting feature of Mastodon is that by its nature it creates communities
              with shared values that grow in each of its servers. Or, should I say, that should be
              a feature if it actually worked like that. In fact these are not really communities,
              but a mashup of users that may share some interests among each other, but also have
              other interests and those other interests end up polluting the supposed "community"
              with things that do not interest the other users.
            </p>
            <p>
              Nostr, on the other hand, can create real communities around relays, specifically
              because users don't have to fully belong to those relays, but can go to them only for
              some of their needs and go to other relays for other needs.

            Why not just use Bluesky/ATProto?
          </summary>
          <div>
            <p>Bluesky has many problems, the two most pronounced are:</p>
            <ol role="list">
              <li>
                Identity centralization: all accounts belong to <b>PLC</b>, a database ran by a
                central entity that can censor at will — or, alternatively, they can belong to a DNS
                domain, which is cumbersome, also censorable, risky and is not expected to be used
                by many anyway;
              </li>
              <li>
                Data centralization: because the <code>Relay-AppView-Client</code> flow assumes only
                one canonical source of data at each step (unlike Nostr multi-master architecture)
                that source is always a server that has power to censor, shadowban, reorder data and
                so on.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              <code>Clients</code> are assumed to be dumb and trust the <code>AppView</code>, and
              here you have room for all sorts of undesired shenanigans. Then AppViews also assume
              to source their data from a single <code>Relay</code>, and here you have room for the
              same effect.
            </p>
            <p>
              You could argue that Bluesky <code>Clients</code> could become smart and start
              sourcing data from multiple <code>AppViews</code>, or from multiple Relays, or that
              the <code>AppViews</code> could rely on multiple <code>Relays</code>, or that the
              <code>Clients</code> could talk directly to the <code>PDSes</code> — and all of that
              is possible and would indeed bring solutions, but notice that if those things started
              happening Bluesky would end up becoming Nostr, except with more steps.

            Are economic incentives aligned to keep relays operational?
          </summary>
          <div>
            <p>
              Yes,

              answers it well.
            </p>
            <p>
              But basically the answer is the same as the question about scale: if users can go to
              whatever relay they want we'll see relays ran by all sorts of people and entities.
              Running servers is very cheap, and a relay can run on a $5/mo server and house at
              least a few thousand users. It's not hard to imagine relays ran by communities,
              individuals who just want to be useful to others, big organizations wanting to gain
              good will with some parts of the public, but also companies, client makers, and, of
              course, dedicated entities who sell relay hosting for very cheap.

          <p>
              It's not a feature of the world at large to be able to see or hear everything that is
              happening everywhere at all times. Nostr inherits that property from the world, making
              it so that you can only see what you focus your attention on (and you're allowed to
              see by the relay that hosts that information).

            How does search work?
          </summary>
          <div>
            <p>
              It's only possible to search on what you have seen, so search engines will always have
              to crawl some parts of the network they chose to and index those to enable public
              search. The word "chose" is employed because, as we know, there can't be a "global"
              view of the network (and no one would want such a thing anyway as it would be full of
              spam), so indexers have to choose. This is not different from Google deciding what
              websites to index.
            </p>
            <p>
              On the other hand, it's surprisingly doable for clients to store all the posts from
              people you follow, or all the posts you have seen or interacted with over time (since
              it's just text, a huge amount of notes can fit in the same space that would otherwise
              be required to store a single photo, for example) then provide local search over that.
              That kind of search will be sufficient for most of the cases you would reach out for a
              search bar in a centralized platform (which is to search for things that you have seen
              before), and perhaps even more useful since it would naturally filter out all the
              unrelated garbage.
            </p>
            <p>
              Last, niche or community-oriented relays can also provide very useful search
              capabilities by just indexing the notes they have stored locally, already filtered and
              scoped to that relay's topic or cohort (imagine searching over a Discord, Slack or
              Telegram group, for example).

            How can I discover new content from people I don't already follow if there are no

          <div>
            <p>
              The most basic way to do that is by following the natural habits used by most
              centralized social platforms users since a long time ago: by looking at the people you
              follow and whom they're interacting with.
            </p>
            <p>
              But also it's not true that Nostr doesn't have algorithms. Nostr can have algorithms
              of all kinds: manual, automatic, AI-powered or rule-based. Some of these algorithms
              can be run entirely locally on clients (for example, surfacing posts from the times
              when you were not online, or from people that make fewer posts), while other
              algorithms can be provided by all sorts of relays, either by naturally surfacing posts
              from a community of people you don't follow or by dedicated relays that have the
              stated purpose of curating content desirable for a target audience or even by
              targeting specific users.

            Is Nostr related to Bitcoin?

          <div>
            <p>
              Nostr uses the same cryptographic principles of Bitcoin and was kickstarted mostly by
              a community of Bitcoiners, so it has disproportionately attracted the attention of
              Bitcoiners at the start, but aside from that it doesn't have any relationship with
              Bitcoin. It doesn't depend on Bitcoin for anything and you don't have to know or have
              or care about any Bitcoin in order to use Nostr.
            </p>
            <p>
              What about "zaps"? Zaps are a standard for tipping Nostr content using Bitcoin that is
              implemented by some Nostr clients, but it's fully and completely optional and if you
              don't care about Bitcoin you don't have to bother about it.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After more than
<a href="https://javascript.tm/letter" rel="noopener noreferrer">27,000 people signed our open letter to Oracle</a>
about the “JavaScript” trademark, we filed a formal <strong>Cancellation Petition</strong>
with the US Patent and Trademark Office. Ten months in, we’re finally reaching
the crucial <strong>discovery phase</strong>.</p>
<p>Deno initiated this petition since we have legal standing as a JavaScript
runtime, but it’s really on behalf of all developers. If we win, “JavaScript”
becomes public domain – free for all developers, conferences, book authors, and
companies to use without fear of trademark threats.</p>
<p>We’re asking for your support through our
<a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-us-challenge-oracles-javascript-trademark/donate" rel="noopener noreferrer">GoFundMe campaign</a>
so we can put forward the strongest case possible.</p>
<h3 id="why-200k">Why $200k?</h3>
<p>Because federal litigation is expensive. Discovery is the most
resource-intensive stage of litigation, where evidence is collected and
arguments are built.</p>
<p>We don’t want to cut corners – we want to make the best case possible by
funding:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Professional public surveys</strong> that carry legal weight in front of the USPTO,
proving that “JavaScript” is universally recognized as the name of a language,
not Oracle’s brand.</li>
<li><strong>Expert witnesses</strong> from academia and industry to testify on JavaScript’s
history, usage, and meaning.</li>
<li><strong>Depositions and records</strong> from standards bodies, browser vendors, and
industry leaders showing Oracle has no role in the language’s development.</li>
<li><strong>Legal filings and responses</strong> to counter Oracle’s claims at every step.</li>
</ul>
<p>If there are leftover funds, we’ll donate them to the
<a href="https://openjsf.org/governance" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>OpenJS</strong></a> to continue defending civil
liberties in the digital space. None of the funds will go to Deno.</p>
<h3 id="oracle-officially-denies-javascript-is-generic">Oracle officially denies “JavaScript” is generic</h3>
<p>On August 6th, 2025, Oracle for the first time addressed the validity of the
trademark.
<a href="https://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?pno=92086835&amp;pty=CAN&amp;eno=16" rel="noopener noreferrer">Their response</a>
to our
<a href="https://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?pno=92086835&amp;pty=CAN&amp;eno=1" rel="noopener noreferrer">petition</a>
denies that “JavaScript” is a generic term.</p>
<p>If you’re a web developer, it’s self-evident that Oracle has nothing to do with
JavaScript. The trademark system was never meant to let companies squat on
commonly-used names and rent-seek – it was designed to protect active brands in
commerce. US law makes this distinction explicit.</p>
<p>We urge you to read
<a href="https://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?pno=92086835&amp;pty=CAN&amp;eno=1" rel="noopener noreferrer">our petition</a>
and <a href="https://javascript.tm/letter" rel="noopener noreferrer">open letter</a> to understand our arguments.</p>
<p>If we don’t win discovery, Oracle locks in ownership of the word “JavaScript.”
This is the decisive moment.</p>
<p>But this case is bigger than JavaScript. It’s about whether trademark law works
as written, or whether billion-dollar corporations can ignore the rule that
trademarks cannot be generic or abandoned. “JavaScript” is obviously both. If
Oracle wins anyway, it undermines the integrity of the whole system.</p>
<p>Let’s make sure the law holds.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>Last night, my wife looks up from her computer, troubled. She tells me she can’t log into her computer running Windows 11, as every time she enters the PIN code to her account, the login screen throws up a cryptic error: “Your credentials could not be verified”. She’s using the correct PIN code, so that surely isn’t it. We opt for the gold standard in troubleshooting and perform a quick reboot, but that doesn’t fix it. My initial instinct is that since she’s using an online account instead of a local one, perhaps Microsoft is having some server issues? A quick check online indicates that no, Microsoft’s servers seem to be running fine, and to be honest, I don’t even know if that would have an effect on logging into Windows in the first place.</p><p>The Windows 11 login screen does give us a link to click in case you forget your PIN code. Despite the fact the PIN code she’s entering is correct, we try to go through this process to see if it goes anywhere. This is where things really start to get weird. A few dialogs flash in and out of existence, until it’s showing us a dialog telling us to insert a security USB key of some sort, which we don’t have. Dismissing it gives us an option to try other login methods, including a basic password login. This, too, doesn’t work; just like with the PIN code, Windows 11 claims the accurate, correct password my wife is entering is invalid (just to be safe, we tested it by logging into her Microsoft account on her phone, which works just fine).</p><p>In the account selection menu in the bottom-left, an ominous new account mysteriously appears: WsiAccount.</p><p>The next option we try is to actually change the PIN code. This doesn’t work either. Windows wants us to use a second factor using my wife’s phone number, but this throws up another weird error, this time claiming the SMS service to send the code isn’t working. A quick check online once again confirms the service seems to be working just fine for everybody else. I’m starting to get really stumped and frustrated.</p><p>Of course, during all of this, we’re both searching the web to find anything that might help us figure out what’s going on. None of our searches bring up anything useful, and none of our findings seem to be related to or match up with the issue we’re having. While she’s looking at her phone and I’m browsing on my Fedora/KDE PC next to hers, she quickly mentions she’s getting a notification that OneDrive is full, which is odd, since she doesn’t use OneDrive for anything.</p><p>We take this up as a quick sidequest, and we check up on her OneDrive account on her phone. As OneDrive loads, our jaws drop in amazement: a big banner warning is telling her she’s using <em>over 5500% of her 5GB free account</em>. We look at each other and burst out laughing. We exchange some confused words, and then we realise what is going on: my wife just got a brand new Samsung Galaxy S25, and Samsung has some sort of deal with Microsoft to integrate its services into Samsung’s variant of Android. Perhaps during the process of transferring data and applications from her old to her new phone, OneDrive syncing got turned on? A quick trip to the Samsung Gallery application confirms our suspicions: the phone is synchronising over 280GB of photos and videos to OneDrive.</p><p>My wife was never asked for consent to turn this feature on, so it must’ve been turned on by default. We quickly turn it off, delete the 280GB of photos and videos from OneDrive, and move on to the real issue at hand.</p><p>Since nothing seems to work, and none of what we find online brings us any closer to what’s going on with her Windows 11 installation, we figured it’s time to bring out the big guns. For the sake of brevity, let’s run through the things we tried. Booting into safe mode doesn’t work; we get the same login problems. Trying to uninstall the latest updates, an option in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Preinstallation_Environment#Windows_Recovery_Environment">WinRE</a>, doesn’t work, and throws up an unspecified error. We try to use a restore point, but despite knowing for 100% certain the feature to periodically create restore points is enabled, the only available restore point is from 2022, and is located on a drive other than her root drive (or “C:\” in Windows parlance). Using the reset option in WinRE doesn’t work either, as it also throws up an error, this time about not having enough free space. I also walk through a few more complex suggestions, like a few manual registry hacks related to the original error using cmd.exe in WinRE. None of it yields any results.</p><p>It’s now approaching midnight, and we need to get up early to drop the kids off at preschool, so I tell my wife I’ll reinstall her copy of Windows 11 tomorrow. We’re out of ideas.</p><p>The next day, I decide to give it one last go before opting for the trouble of going through a reinstallation. The one idea I still have left is to enable the hidden administrator account in Windows 11, which gives you password-free access to what is basically Windows’ root account. It <a href="https://onlinecomputertips.com/support-categories/pc-troubleshooting/enable-built-in-windows-admin-account-if-you-cant-log-on-to-your-computer/">involves</a> booting into WinRE, loading up cmd.exe, and replacing utilman.exe in system32 with cmd.exe:</p><pre><code>move c:\windows\system32\utilman.exe c:\
copy c:\windows\system32\cmd.exe c:\windows\system32\utilman.exe</code></pre><p>If you then proceed to boot into Windows 11 and click on the Accessibility icon in the bottom-right, it will open “utilman.exe”, but since that’s just cmd.exe with the utilman.exe name, you get a command prompt to work with, right on the login screen. From here, you can launch regedit, find the correct key, change a REG_BINARY, save, and reboot. At the login screen, you’ll see a new “adminstrator” account with full access to your computer.</p><p>During the various reboots, I do some more web searching, and I stumble upon <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WindowsHelp/comments/1irhobe/your_credentials_arent_verified_pin_isnt_working/">a post on /r/WindowsHelp</a> from 7 months ago. The user William6212 isn’t having the <em>exact</em> same issues and error messages we’re seeing, but it’s close enough that it warrants a look at the replies. The top reply by user lemonsandlimes30 contains just two words:</p><blockquote><p>storage full</p>
<cite><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WindowsHelp/comments/1irhobe/comment/md8e7cp/">↫ lemonsandlimes30, the real MVP</a></cite></blockquote><p>And all of a sudden all the pieces of the puzzle fall into place. I instantly figure out the course of events: my wife gets her new Galaxy S25, and transfers over the applications and data from her old phone. During this setup process, the option in the Samsung Gallery application to synchronise photos and videos to OneDrive is enabled without her consent and without informing her. The phone starts uploading the roughly 280GB of photos and videos from her phone to her 5GB OneDrive account, and she gets a warning notification that her OneDrive storage is <em>a bit</em> full.</p><p>And now her Windows 11 PC enters the scene. Despite me knowing with 100% certainty I deleted OneDrive completely off her Windows 11 PC, some recent update or whatever must’ve reinstalled it and enabled its synchronisation feature, which in turn, right as my wife’s new phone secretly started uploading her photos and videos to OneDrive, started downloading those same photos and videos to her Windows 11’s relatively small root drive. All 280GB of them.</p><p><em>Storage full.</em></p><p>The reboots were done, and indeed, the secret passwordless administrator account was now available on the login screen. I log in, wait for Windows 11’s stupid out-of-box-experience thing to run its course, immediately open Explorer, and there it is: her root drive is completely full, with a mere 25MB or so available. We go into her account’s folder, delete the OneDrive folder and its 280GB of photos and videos, and remove OneDrive from her computer once again. Hopefully this will do the trick.</p><p>It didn’t. We still can’t log in, as the original issue persists. I log back into the administrator account, open up compmgmt.msc, go to Users, and try to change my wife’s password. No luck – it’s an online account, and it turns out you can’t change the password of such an account using traditional user management tools; you have to log into your Microsoft account on the web, and change your password there. After we do this, we can finally log back into her Windows 11 account with the newly-set password.</p><p>We fixed it.</p><h5>Darkest of patterns</h5><p>My wife and I fell victim to a series of dark patterns that nearly rendered her Windows 11 installation unrecoverable. The first dark pattern is Samsung enabling the OneDrive synchronisation feature without my wife’s consent and without informing her. The second dark pattern is Microsoft reinstalling OneDrive onto my wife’s PC without my wife’s consent and without informing her. The third dark pattern is OneDrive secretely downloading 280GB of photos and videos without once realising this was way more data than her root drive could store. The fifth and final dark pattern runs through all of this like a red thread: Microsoft’s insistence on forcefully converting every local Windows 11 user account to an online Microsoft account.</p><p>This tragedy of dark patterns then neatly cascaded into a catastrophic comedy of bugs, where a full root drive apparently corrupts online Microsoft accounts on Windows 11 so hard they become essentially unrecoverable. There were no warnings and no informational popups. Ominous user accounts started to appear on the login screen. Weird suggestions to use corporate-looking security USB keys pop up. Windows wrongfully tells my wife the PIN code and password she enters are incorrect. The suggestion to change the password or PIN code breaks completely. All the well-known rescue options any average user would turn to in WinRE throw up cryptic errors.</p><p>At this point, any reasonable person would assume their Windows 11 installation was unrecoverable, or worse, that some sort of malware had taken over their machine – ominous “WsiAccount” and demands for a security USB key and all. The only course of action most Windows users would take at this point is a full reinstallation. If it wasn’t for me having just enough knowledge to piece the puzzle together – thank you lemonsandlimes30 – we’d be doing a reinstallation today, possibly running into the issue again a few days or weeks later.</p><p>No sane person would go this deep to try and fix this problem.</p><p>This cost us hours and hours of our lives, causing especially my wife a significant amount of stress, during an already very difficult time in our lives (which I won’t get into). I’m seething with rage towards Microsoft and its utter incompetence and maliciousness. Let me, for once, not mince words here: Windows 11 is a travesty, a loose collection of dark patterns and incompetence, run by people who have zero interest in lovingly crafting an operating system they can be proud of. Windows has become a vessel for subscriptions and ads, and cannot reasonably be considered anything other than a massive pile of user-hostile dark patterns designed to extract data, ad time, and subscription money from its users.</p><p>If you can switch away and ditch Windows, you should. The ship is burning, and there’s nobody left to put out the fires.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>In my experience that's false, I've had multiple situations where I ask a question, it answers, then I ask a similar question but with aditional details and the response sometimes is exactly the same because it keeps using the same context.</p>

The US doesn’t care how many students use ChatGPT to cheat on homework. They care about its ability to decrypt nuclear launch codes. </p>

<p>For context the US government has invested over 300 billion in AI. In addition to 20+ billion from Facebook, 500 billion from open AI, 30 billion from Microsoft. I can go on forever.

<p>It isn’t about the bubble, or consumer use anymore, or even profits. It’s about having a smarter Ai Than China for defense. The department of defense is currently the biggest support of AI In the world, since they are responsible for 72% of the 300+ billion from the US. And they will continue spending.</p>

<p>AI said "I love the setup you have, I SEE that you have soy sauce and others"</p>

<p>I think he was supposed to say something like "What can I make with this? Maybe something Korean inspired" or similar. Reason why I think this is because he asked Meta the question and Meta basically responded back with redundancy (look at what he had on the table and what the AI was saying) or it was doing a general search and not waiting for its “cue”. He knew he messed up which is why he immediately interrupted the AI to go to the next step. He likely said something off script which didn't make sense in the sequence.</p>

<p>But the problem was, the AI likely included what to do to prepare FIRST with the dialogue it was giving, but he interrupted. The script got confused because the scripted dialogue was just following what it was told. This guy bumped it off of alignment.</p>

<p>Could've likely been first time jitters, or stage fright. Regardless, bad demo.</p>

<p>When FileVault is enabled, the data volume is locked and
    unavailable during and after booting, until an account has been
    authenticated using a password. The macOS version of OpenSSH stores all of
    its configuration files, both system-wide and per-account, in the data
    volume. Therefore, the usually configured authentication methods and shell
    access are not available during this time. However, when Remote Login is
    enabled, it is possible to perform password authentication using SSH even in
    this situation. This can be used to unlock the data volume remotely over the
    network. However, it does not immediately permit an SSH session. Instead,
    once the data volume has been unlocked using this method, macOS will
    disconnect SSH briefly while it completes mounting the data volume and
    starting the remaining services dependent on it. Thereafter, SSH (and other
    enabled services) are fully available.</p>

            <p>In new Science article, Colorado School of Mines researchers call for more research, development and policy to increase critical mineral recovery</p>
      </div><div>
      
            <p>Colorado's Climax Mine, which produces produces approximately 30 million pounds of molybdenum every year, was among the U.S. mining operations evaluated in the critical minerals analysis published today in the journal Science.</p>
      
  </div><div><p>All the critical minerals the U.S. needs annually for energy, defense and technology applications are already being mined at existing U.S. facilities, according to a <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adw8977">new analysis published today</a> in the journal <em>Science</em>.</p><p>The catch? These minerals, such as cobalt, lithium, gallium and rare earth elements like neodymium and yttrium, are currently being discarded as tailings of other mineral streams like gold and zinc, said Elizabeth Holley, associate professor of <a href="https://mining.mines.edu/">mining engineering at Colorado School of Mines</a> and lead author of the new paper.</p><p>"The challenge lies in recovery," Holley said. "It's like getting salt out of bread dough – we need to do a lot more research, development and policy to make the recovery of these critical minerals economically feasible."</p><p>To conduct the analysis, Holley and her team built a database of annual production from federally permitted metal mines in the U.S. They used a statistical resampling technique to pair these data with the geochemical concentrations of critical minerals in ores, recently compiled by the <a href="https://usgs.gov/">U.S. Geological Survey</a>, Geoscience Australia and the Geologic Survey of Canada.</p><p>Using this approach, Holley’s team was able to estimate the quantities of critical minerals being mined and processed every year at U.S. metal mines but not being recovered. Instead, these valuable minerals are ending up as discarded tailings that must be stored and monitored to prevent environmental contamination.</p><p>“This is a brand-new view of ‘low hanging fruit’ – we show where each critical mineral exists and the sites at which even 1 percent recovery of a particular critical mineral could make a huge difference, in many cases dramatically reducing or even eliminating the need to import that mineral,” Holley said.</p><p>The analysis in <em>Science</em> looks at a total of 70 elements used in applications ranging from consumer electronics like cell phones to medical devices to satellites to renewable energy to fighter jets and shows that unrecovered byproducts from other U.S. mines could meet the demand for all but two – platinum and palladium.</p><p>Among the elements included in the analysis are:</p><ul><li><strong>Cobalt (Co): </strong>The lustrous bluish-gray metal, a key component in electric car batteries, is a byproduct of nickel and copper mining. Recovering less than 10 percent of the cobalt currently being mined and processed but not recovered would be more than enough to fuel the entire U.S. battery market.</li><li><strong>Germanium (Ge):</strong> The brittle silvery-white semi-metal used for electronics and infrared optics, including sensors on missiles and defense satellites, is present in zinc and molybdenum mines. If the U.S. recovered less than 1 percent of the germanium currently mined and processed but not recovered from U.S. mines, it would not have to import any germanium to meet industry needs.</li></ul><p>The benefits of enhanced recovery are not only economic and geopolitical but also environmental, Holley said – recovering these critical minerals instead of sending them to tailings piles would reduce the environmental impact of mine waste and open more opportunities for reuse in construction and other industries.</p><p>“Now that we know which sites are low-hanging fruit, we need to conduct detailed analyses of the minerals in which these chemical elements reside and then test the technologies suitable for recovery of those elements from those specific minerals,” Holley said. “We also need policies that incentivize mine operators to incorporate additional processing infrastructure. Although these elements are needed, their market value may not be sufficient to motivate operators to invest in new equipment and processes without the right policies in place.”</p><p>Co-authors on the paper are Karlie Hadden, PhD candidate in <a href="https://geology.mines.edu/">geology</a>; Dorit Hammerling, associate professor of <a href="https://ams.mines.edu/">applied mathematics and statistics</a>; Rod Eggert, research professor of <a href="https://econbus.mines.edu/">economics and business</a>; Erik Spiller, research professor of mining engineering; and Priscilla Nelson, professor of mining engineering.</p><p>Read the full paper, <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adw8997">"Byproduct recovery from US metal mines could reduce import reliance for critical minerals,"</a> on the <em>Science</em> website.

Our survey submissions have revealed some alarming trends, including: </span><b>if you don’t have a personal or second-degree connection at Meta, your chances of restoring your content or account are likely to drop significantly.&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><span>Through the survey, we heard from activists, clinics, and researchers whose accounts were suspended or permanently removed for allegedly violating Meta’s </span><a href="https://transparency.meta.com/policies/community-standards/restricted-goods-services/"><span>policies on promoting or selling “restricted goods,”</span></a><span> even when their posts were purely educational or informational. What the submissions also showed is a pattern of overenforcement, lack of transparency, and arbitrary moderation decisions that have specifically affected reproductive health and reproductive justice advocates.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When accounts are taken down, appeals can take days, weeks, or even months (if they're even resolved at all, or if users are even given the option to appeal). For organizations and providers, this means losing access to vital communication tools and being cut off from the communities they serve. This is highly damaging since so much of that interaction happens on Meta’s platforms. Yet we saw a disturbing pattern emerge in our survey: on several occasions, accounts are swiftly restored once someone with a connection to Meta intervenes.</span></p>
<h2><b>The</b> <b>Case Studies: An Abortion Clinic</b></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.redriverwomensclinic.com/"><span>The Red River Women's Clinic</span></a><span> is an abortion clinic in Moorhead, MN. It was originally located in Fargo, North Dakota, and for many years was the only abortion clinic in North Dakota. In early January, the clinic’s director heard from a patient that she thought they only offered procedural/surgical abortions and not medication abortion. To clarify for other patients, they posted on the clinic’s page that they offered both procedural and medication abortions—attaching an image of a box of mifepristone. When they tried to boost the post, the ad was flagged and their account was suspended.</span></p>
<p><span>They appealed the decision and initially got the ad approved, yet the page was suspended again shortly after. But this time, multiple appeals and direct emails went unanswered,&nbsp;</span><span>until they reached out to a digital rights organization that</span><span>&nbsp;was able to connect with staff at Meta that stepped in. Only then was their page restored, with Meta noting that their post did not violate the policies but warning that future violations could lead to permanent removal.</span></p>
<p><span>While this may have been a glitch in Meta’s systems or a misapplication of policy, the suspension of the clinic’s Facebook account was detrimental for them. “We were unable to update our followers about dates/times we were closed, we were unable to share important information and news about abortion that would have kept our followers up to date, there was a legislative session happening and we were unable to share events and timely asks for reaching out to legislators about issues,” shared Tammi Kromenaker, Director of Red River Women's Clinic. The clinic was also prevented from starting an Instagram page due to the suspension. “Facebook has a certain audience and Instagram has another audience,” said Kromenaker, “we are trying to cater to all of our supporters so the loss of FB and the inability to access and start an Instagram account were really troubling to us.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><b>The Case Studies: RISE at Emory University</b></h2>
<p><a href="https://rise.emory.edu/"><span>RISE, a reproductive health research center at Emory University</span></a><span>, launched an Instagram account to share community-centered research and combat misinformation related to reproductive health. In January of this year, they posted educational content about mifepristone on their instagram. “Let's talk about Mifepristone + its uses + the importance of access”, read the post. Two months later, their account was suddenly suspended, flagging the account under its policy against selling illegal drugs. Their appeal was denied, which led to the account being permanently deleted.&nbsp;</span></p>
<div><p><img src="https://www.eff.org/files/2025/09/12/screenshot_2025-09-12_at_12.26.09_pm_0.png" width="1272" height="820" alt="A screenshot of an instagram post from @emory.rise that reads &quot;let's talk about mifepristone&quot; in bold black font &quot;+ its uses + the importance of access&quot; in blue" title="A screenshot of an instagram post from @emory.rise that reads &quot;let's talk about mifepristone&quot; in bold black font &quot;+ its uses + the importance of access&quot; in blue"></p><p>Screenshot submitted by RISE to EFF</p></div>
<p><span>“As a team, this was a hit to our morale” shared Sara Redd, Director of Research Translation at </span><i><span>RISE</span></i><span>. “We pour countless hours of person-power, creativity, and passion into creating the content we have on our page, and having it vanish virtually overnight took a toll on our team.” For many organizational users like RISE, their social media accounts are a repository for resources and metrics that may not be stored elsewhere. “We spent a significant amount of already-constrained team capacity attempting to recover all of the content we’d created for Instagram that was potentially going to be permanently lost. [...] We also spent a significant amount of time and energy trying to understand what options we might have available from Meta to appeal our case and/or recover our account; their support options are not easily accessible, and the time it took to navigate this issue distracted from our existing work.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Meta restored the account only after RISE was able to connect with someone there. Once RISE logged back in, they confirmed that the flagged post was the one about mifepristone. The post never sold or directed people where to buy pills, it simply provided accurate information about the use and efficacy of the drug.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><b>This Shouldn’t Be How Content Moderation Works</b></h2>
<p><span>Meta spokespersons have admitted to instances of “overenforcement” </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/24/24350967/metas-instagram-facebook-abortion-access-information-blocking-banning"><span>in various</span></a> <a href="https://www.tortoisemedia.com/2025/01/27/abortion-pill-information-censored-online-1"><span>press statements</span></a><span>, noting that content is sometimes incorrectly removed or blurred even when it doesn’t actually violate policy. Meta has insisted to the public that they care about free speech, as a spokesperson mentioned </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/11/business/abortion-groups-tech-platforms.html"><span>to The New York Times</span></a><span>: “We want our platforms to be a place where people can access reliable information about health services, advertisers can promote health services and everyone can discuss and debate public policies in this space [...] That’s why we allow posts and ads about, discussing and debating abortion.” In fact, </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/263390265553560?id=434838534925385"><span>their platform policies directly mention this</span></a><span>:&nbsp;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><i><span>Note that advertisers don’t need authorization to run ads that only:</span></i></p>
<ul>
<li><i><span>Educate, advocate or give public service announcements related to prescription drugs</span></i></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://transparency.meta.com/policies/community-standards/restricted-goods-services/"><span>Additionally</span></a><span>:&nbsp;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><i><span>Note: Debating or advocating for the legality or discussing scientific or medical merits of prescription drugs is allowed. This includes news and public service announcements.&nbsp;</span></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span>Meta also has policies specific to “</span><a href="https://transparency.meta.com/policies/ad-standards/restricted-goods-services/health-wellness"><span>Health and Wellness,</span></a><span>” where they state:&nbsp;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><i><span>When targeting people 18 years or older, advertisers can run ads that:</span></i></p>
<ul>
<li><i><span>Promote sexual and reproductive health and wellness products or services, as long as the focus is on health and the medical efficacy of the product or the service and not on the sexual pleasure or enhancement. And these ads must target people 18 years or older. This includes ads for: [...]</span></i></li>
<li><span>Family planning methods, such as:</span>
<ul>
<li><span>Family planning clinics</span></li>
<li><span>In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) or any other artificial insemination procedures</span></li>
<li><span>Fertility awareness</span></li>
<li><strong>Abortion medical consultation and related services</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><span>But these public commitments don’t always match users’ experiences.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Take the </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/23/technology/instagram-facebook-abortion-pill-providers.html"><span>widely</span></a> <a href="https://jessica.substack.com/p/instagram-is-censoring-abortion-pill"><span>covered</span></a><span> case of </span><a href="https://aidaccess.org/en/"><span>Aid Access</span></a><span>, a group that provides medication abortion by mail. This year, several of their Instagram posts were blurred and removed on Instagram, including one with tips for feeling safe and supported at home after taking abortion medication. But only after multiple national media outlets contacted Meta for comment on the story were the posts and account restored.</span></p>
<p><span>So the question becomes: If Meta admits its enforcement isn’t perfect, why does it still take knowing someone, or having the media involved, to get a fair review? When companies like Meta claim to uphold </span><a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2025/01/meta-more-speech-fewer-mistakes/"><span>commitments to free speech</span></a><span>, those commitments </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/01/metas-new-content-policy-will-harm-vulnerable-users-if-it-really-valued-free"><span>should materialize</span></a><span> in clear policies that are enforced equally, not only when it is escalated through leveraging relationships with Meta personnel.</span></p>
<h2><b>“Facebook Jail” Reform</b></h2>
<p><span>There is no question that the enforcement of these content moderation policies on Meta platforms and the length of time people are spending in “content jail” or “Facebook/Instagram jail” has created a </span><a href="https://www.thefire.org/research-learn/chilling-effect-overview"><span>chilling effect</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“I think that I am more cautious and aware that the 6.1K followers we have built up over time could be taken away at any time based on the whims of Meta,” Tammi from Red River Women’s Clinic told us.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>RISE sees it in a slightly different light, sharing that “[w]hile this experience has not affected our fundamental values and commitment to sharing our work and rigorous science, it has highlighted for us that no information posted on a third-party platform is entirely one’s own, and thus can be dismantled at any moment.”</span></p>
<p><span>At the end of the day, clinics are left afraid to post basic information, patients are left confused or misinformed, and researchers lose access to their audiences. But unless your issue catches the attention of a journalist or you know someone at Meta, you might never regain access to your account.</span></p>
<p><span>These case studies highlight the urgent need for transparent, equitable, and timely enforcement that is not dependent on insider connections, as well as accountability from platforms that claim to support open dialogue and free speech. Meta’s admitted overenforcement should, at minimum, be coupled with efficient and well-staffed review processes and policies that are transparent and easily understandable.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It’s time for Meta and other social media platforms to implement the reforms they claim to support, and for them to prove that protecting access to vital health information doesn’t hinge on who you know.</span></p>

									<p>Simmon’s map includes countries, major lakes, oceans, gulfs, seas, roads, and cities. It also features inset maps depicting Earth’s biosphere, global land cover, and bathymetry. All of these are familiar to most map readers. Yet the map may seem disorienting to many. Simmon’s map is geographically correct, yet purposely—and literally—turns convention on its head. What was once familiar becomes alien, challenging readers to look at Earth anew. It also encourages us to think more deeply about such conventions: Why is north almost always at the top of maps? And must it always be that way? Simmon’s map reminds us that it doesn’t have to be.</p><p>Simmon is not the first to create a south-up map. Others have made these maps to challenge conventions and norms. And it was only rather recently that north-up maps became so commonplace. Centuries ago, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20160614-maps-have-north-at-the-top-but-it-couldve-been-different">cartographers drew maps</a> with the top being south, east, or other orientations. These alternatives reflected the limited tools, knowledge, and practices of the time. The basic idea behind a compass (which most today recognize as a device that points north) was known to the Han and Tang dynasties of China more than 2,000 years ago. Early Chinese navigators used magnetized devices as a compass, but for them <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=CjRAiqGSJ50C&amp;pg=PA27#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">south was the dominant position</a> from which bearings were derived.&nbsp;</p><p>Deciding to put south, or north, at the top of maps is a decision of consequence. Psychologically, we <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1948550611401042">tend to view</a> things nearer the top as ‘good’ and those lower as ‘bad.’ This can influence our interpretation of maps at both global and local scales. Still, the prominence of north-up maps did not arrive deliberately to elevate the status of some areas or their rulers. It is in part a consequence of the work of Ptolemey, who first labeled his maps with calculated lines of latitude and longitude. This made it easy for others to copy, extend, and derive new maps. Each map drawn in this way would adopt Ptolemy’s orientation.</p><p>Regardless of the reasons for a given orientation and the implications that follow, Simmon’s map reminds us to challenge tradition and consider its influence. As both a map and a philosophical prompt, this example hits the mark beautifully.</p>								</div></div>]]></description>

<div data-gt-id="rich_text" data-gt-component-name="">
    




    <p data-block-key="ucxot">Textbooks are a cornerstone of education, but they have a fundamental limitation: they are a one-size-fits-all medium. The manual creation of textbooks demands significant human effort, and as a result they lack alternative perspectives, multiple formats and tailored variations that can make learning more effective and engaging. At Google, we’re exploring how we can use generative AI (GenAI) to automatically generate alternative representations or personalized examples, while preserving the integrity of the source material. What if students had the power to shape their own learning journey, exploring materials using various formats that fit their evolving needs? What if we could reimagine the textbook to be as unique as every learner?</p><p data-block-key="e8fqs">Recent advances in GenAI are bringing this vision closer to reality. Today we are excited to introduce <a href="https://learnyourway.withgoogle.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Learn Your Way</a>, now on <a href="https://labs.google/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Labs</a>, a research experiment that explores how GenAI can transform educational materials to create a more effective, engaging, learner-driven experience for every student. Here we outline the research and pedagogy underpinning Learn Your Way, with more details in the accompanying <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13348" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tech report</a>. We also report early indicators of its impact: in our efficacy study, students using Learn Your Way scored 11 percentage points higher on retention tests than students using a standard digital reader.</p>

                <h2>Grounded in learning, built for the student</h2>
            
        
        
    </p>



    <p data-block-key="ucxot">Our approach is built on two key pillars that work together to augment the learning experience: (1) generating various multimodal representations of the content, and (2) taking foundational steps toward personalization.</p><p data-block-key="7jca2">The seminal <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225249172_Dual_Coding_Theory_and_Education" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dual coding theory</a> states that forging mental connections between different representations strengthens the underlying conceptual schema in our brain. Subsequent <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0360131599000299" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">research</a> indeed showed that when students actively engage with information in various formats, they build a more robust and complete mental model of the material. Inspired by this, our approach empowers students with the agency to choose and intermix multiple formats and modalities to best help them understand the material. In addition, personalization is increasingly becoming an <a href="https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10274018" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">aspirational standard</a> in K-12 educational settings, and so our research reflects this. We aim to enhance the relatability and effectiveness of educational content by adapting it to student attributes. Moreover, we incorporate quizzing capabilities that enable us to further tailor the experience according to the learners’ real-time responses. Such personalization can be a powerful method for <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320564894_The_Role_of_Situational_Interest_in_Personalized_Learning" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">enhancing motivation</a> and <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.3102/00346543221148478" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">deepening learning</a>.</p><p data-block-key="35lic">Bringing this to life involves a layered technical approach using <a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/education/google-learnlm-gemini-generative-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LearnLM</a>, our best-in-class pedagogy-infused family of models, now integrated directly into <a href="https://blog.google/technology/google-deepmind/gemini-model-thinking-updates-march-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gemini 2.5 Pro</a>. The first layer is a unique personalization pipeline that serves as the basis for the second layer of multiple content representations. Our starting point is a textbook PDF, although our approach could be used with other forms of source material.</p>
</div>

                <h3>The personalization pipeline</h3>
            
        
        
    </p>



    <p data-block-key="ucxot">The Learn Your Way interface asks the learner to select their grade and interests (e.g., sports, music, food). The original source material is first re-leveled to the learner’s reported grade level, while maintaining the scope of its content. This is followed by the strategic replacement of generic examples with ones that are personalized to the learner’s reported interests. The resulting text serves as the basis for the generation of all the other representations, effectively propagating the personalization effect and setting up a pipeline for further personalization.</p>
</div>

                <h3>Multiple representations of content</h3>
            
        
        
    </p>



    <p data-block-key="ucxot">Following the source personalization, we generate multiple representations of the content. For some content representations, such as mind maps and timelines, Gemini’s broad capabilities are used directly. Other features such as narrated slides, require more elaborate pipelines that weave together multiple specialized AI agents and tools to achieve an effective pedagogical result. Finally, specialized tasks, such as generating effective educational visuals, proved too challenging even for state-of-the-art general-purpose image models. To overcome this, we fine-tuned a dedicated model specifically for generating educational illustrations. The combination of a powerful base model, multi-step agentic workflows, and fine-tuned components allows us to generate a wide range of high-quality multimodal representations for learning.</p>

Learn Your Way now serves as a research platform for us to conduct studies with partners around the world to explore how AI-powered transformations and personalization affects outcomes, and to ensure that what we build is effective and <a href="https://blog.google/intl/en-africa/company-news/outreach-and-initiatives/5-ways-were-bringing-ai-innovations-to-people-across-africa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">locally relevant</a>.</p><p data-block-key="rstv">Recently, we conducted a randomized controlled study with 60 students from the Chicago area, ages 15–18 and with similar reading levels. Participants were given up to 40 minutes to learn about adolescent brain development from a textbook, and randomly assigned to learn using Learn Your Way or a traditional digital PDF reader.</p><p data-block-key="e1qod">We assessed students with a quiz immediately after the study session, and with a retention test 3–5 days later, using assessments designed by pedagogical experts to be a good measure of content comprehension. We also surveyed them about the learning experience, and to gain deeper insights beyond these quantitative metrics, each student participated in a 30-minute qualitative interview where they could share more nuanced feedback about their experience.</p><p data-block-key="2tkk3">The results were compelling and statistically significant. Here are the highlights. See the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13348" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tech report</a> for more details.</p><ul><li data-block-key="1603p"><b>Positive learning outcomes:</b> The Learn Your Way group scored, on average, 9% higher on the immediate assessment following the study session.</li><li data-block-key="2plg8"><b>Better long-term retention:</b> Similarly, the Learn Your Way group scored 11% higher on the retention assessment 3-5 days later (78% vs. 67%).</li><li data-block-key="c6kod"><b>Positive user sentiment:</b> 100% of students who used Learn Your Way reported that they felt the tool made them more comfortable taking the assessment, compared to 70% in the digital reader control group. 93% said they would want to use Learn Your Way for future learning, compared to just 67% for the digital reader.</li><li data-block-key="4mg4i"><b>Valuable experience</b>: Insights from the qualitative interviews revealed that students found great value in Learn Your Way.</li></ul>

    <p data-block-key="ucxot">Our findings suggest that generative AI can be used to build learning experiences that are not only more effective but also more empowering. By evolving the static textbook into an interactive artifact and giving students greater agency over <i>how</i> they learn, we saw learning retention improve.</p><p data-block-key="88po1">This work is just the beginning of our exploration. We envision many more ways to tailor content, moving towards systems that continuously adapt to each learner's unique needs and progress. As we take our next steps towards personalized education, we will continue to ground our research in pedagogical principles, measuring the impact of AI on learning efficacy, so that in the future every student might have access to a high-quality, engaging learning experience that is custom built for them.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Yesterday, Disney-owned ABC <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/780471/disney-abc-jimmy-kimmel-live-charlie-kirk">suspended <em>Jimmy Kimmel Live</em></a> “indefinitely” for a comment Kimmel made about the response to Charlie Kirk’s death. The response from Republican commentators has been <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/politics-news/maga-reaction-jimmy-kimmel-suspension-1236374491/">predictably gleeful</a>. They’ve positioned the suspension as a reversal of “cancel culture,” a “deplatforming” that’s simply fair retaliation for antagonizing them. “Jimmy Kimmel does have Free Speech, he is free to speak just not on ABC,” posted comedian <a href="https://x.com/w_terrence/status/1968521190693019710">Terrence Kentrell Williams on X</a>.</p><p>This framing is transparently false. ABC’s suspension of Kimmel was the result of an explicit threat from President Donald Trump’s Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr, aimed at Disney and companies that worked with it. The move was effective because of the FCC’s authority to regulate broadcast TV and, perhaps more importantly, to approve communications mergers in a hyper-consolidated landscape. It was repeating a playbook Carr recently used on Disney’s fellow media giant Paramount. And it’s an unabashed attempt at the government dictating the speech of private TV networks and entertainers, as objectionable and un-American as a McCarthyist blacklist.</p><p>The starting point of all this is a pretty tame late-night show monologue. On Monday, Kimmel said the following:</p><p>“We hit some new lows over the weekend, with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it.”</p><p>The line led into a clip from last week in which Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/16/arts/television/late-night-trump-white-house-ballroom.html">responded to Kirk’s death</a> by bragging about the new White House ballroom — “he’s at the fourth stage of grief: construction,” Kimmel quipped.</p><p>Carr and other Republicans loudly interpreted the remark as claiming Tyler Robinson, who’s charged with killing Kirk, was part of MAGA. (An <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/09/16/us/tyler-robinson-charges.html">indictment released</a> Tuesday says Robinson believed Kirk was spreading “hate”; at the time of Kimmel’s monologue, the evidence was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/politics/777313/charlie-kirks-alleged-killer-scratched-bullets-with-a-helldivers-combo-and-a-furry-sex-meme">mostly confusing</a> and speculation was rife.)</p><p>On Wednesday, Carr <a href="https://x.com/bennyjohnson/status/1968359685045838041">appeared in high dudgeon</a> for an interview with conservative commentator Benny Johnson. “It appears to be some of the sickest conduct possible,” Carr intoned over a clip of Kimmel’s statement. It was also, he said, legally actionable. Broadcasters “have a license granted by us at the FCC, and that comes with an obligation to operate in the public interest,” he said. “We can do this the easy way or the hard way. These companies can find ways to change conduct and take action, frankly, on Kimmel, or there’s going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.”</p><p>Carr and Johnson walked out the threat a little further. They noted that Disney and ABC aren’t issued a central license to broadcast; licenses are granted to individual TV stations, owned in small numbers by Disney but mainly by separate companies that broadcast ABC and other networks’ programming. “FCC regulatory action focuses on these individual stations,” Carr noted. “The public interest means you can’t be running a narrow partisan circus and still meeting your public interest obligations.”</p><p>Citing rules against “news distortion” and “broadcast hoaxes,” Carr repeated that “there’s actions we can take on licensed broadcasters. And frankly, I think it’s really past time that a lot of these licensed broadcasters themselves push back on Comcast and Disney and say, ‘Listen, we are going to preempt, we are not going to run Kimmel anymore until you straighten this out, because we, a licensed broadcaster, are running the possibility of fines or license revocation from the FCC if we continue to run content that ends up being a pattern of news distortion.’”</p><p>This is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24283652/fcc-license-donald-trump-elon-musk-first-amendment-fairness-doctrine-please-vote-decoder">not how any pre-Carr FCC in recent memory</a> (or arguably before that) has defined the “public interest” requirement. If the issue is a “narrow partisan circus,” the highly partisan Fox — whose news division <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/18/23688582/fox-dominion-election-defamation-lawsuit-settled-trial-averted">settled a massive defamation suit</a> for lying about voting machine companies in 2023 — has been a stolid fixture on TV stations across the country for decades. Carr invoked rules against “news distortion” and “broadcast hoaxes,” neither of which makes logical sense as a charge against Kimmel. The bar for stripping a license is typically high — a rare example is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1979/12/07/archives/black-group-is-awarded-license-for-television-station-in.html">the 1989 revocation</a> of aggressively pro-segregationist station WLBT, which among other things, blacked out broadcasts involving civil rights.</p><p>Some commentators on the left <em>have </em>pushed for the FCC to do what Carr threatened, just with Fox instead of ABC, particularly <a href="https://prospect.org/blogs-and-newsletters/tap/2023-08-28-will-fox-lose-its-broadcast-license/">after the defamation settlement</a>. But the FCC has never pulled a station’s license as a result of this urging, and <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/09/brendan-carr-jimmy-kimmel-public-interest-1236547721/">in 2019 Carr decried</a> even Democratic commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel’s suggestion they crack down on TV and radio e-cigarette ads, saying the FCC “does not have a roving mandate to police speech in the name of the ‘public interest.’”</p><p>Carr’s statement on Wednesday was unambiguous: ABC-affiliated TV stations needed to stop airing Kimmel’s show ASAP, or they could be fined or lose their license. And the stations’ parent companies were listening. Nexstar, which owns around 200 stations and reaches roughly 39 percent of US households, <a href="https://www.nexstar.tv/nexstar-abc-affiliates-to-preempt-jimmy-kimmel-live-indefinitely-beginning-tonight/">said quickly</a> that it would no longer air <em>Jimmy Kimmel Live</em>. So did <a href="https://sbgi.net/sinclair-says-kimmel-suspension-is-not-enough-calls-on-fcc-and-abc-to-take-additional-action/">fellow giant Sinclair Broadcast Group</a>.</p><p>Those companies, particularly Nexstar, have reasons beyond station licensing to keep Carr happy. Nexstar is pushing for a $6.2 billion merger with broadcaster Tegna that would require the FCC to loosen the rules on TV station consolidation, something CEO Perry Sook <a href="https://www.newscaststudio.com/2025/08/22/nexstar-ceo-perry-sook-defends-6-2b-tegna-acquisition-as-regulatory-shift-creates-opening/">has expressed hope</a> that Trump’s “deregulatory moment” will enable.</p><p>Carr has shown himself willing to slow-walk deals with companies that earn his ire. A merger between Paramount and Skydance was not approved until Paramount subsidiary CBS <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/696422/paramount-settlement-trump-cbs-lawsuit">agreed to pay $16 million</a> to resolve a blatantly frivolous lawsuit filed by Trump. It proceeded on the grounds that Skydance promote a “diversity of viewpoints from across the political and ideological spectrum” and employ an ombudsman who would “receive and evaluate any complaints of bias or other concerns involving CBS.” CBS also ended the show of Kimmel’s fellow late-night host Stephen Colbert, a decision <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/709544/stephen-colberts-version-of-the-late-show-will-end-next-may">CBS called financial</a> that was nonetheless widely seen as a concession to Trump — and that was celebrated by Carr.</p><p>The pressure from Carr, Sinclair, and Nexstar quickly reached ABC, which made a terse announcement it had pulled Kimmel’s show off the air. Outlets with inside sources have indicated this wasn’t because of public outrage or because Kimmel’s bosses found the remarks inappropriate — <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-news/jimmy-kimmel-out-abc-charlie-kirk-comments-1235430078/"><em>Rolling Stone</em> reports</a> that “multiple execs felt that Kimmel had not actually said anything over the line.” Instead, they were “pissing themselves” over the threat of Trump administration retaliation, one source said.</p><p>Disney, too, has pressure points beyond broadcast license fines. The FCC chair has previously threatened to investigate it for having (non-“ideological,” of course) diversity programs. And as <a href="https://www.status.news/p/jimmy-kimmel-pulled-fcc-decision">Oliver Darcy of <em>Status</em> notes</a>, the company is “working to complete a high-stakes deal with the NFL, one that is crucial to the future of ESPN” and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/espn-nfl-deal-faces-regulatory-hurdles-2025-08-07/">requires regulatory approval</a> from the Department of Justice. Trump <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/attorney-general-pam-bondi-doj-hate-speech-rcna231633">incidentally told</a> an ABC journalist this week that the DOJ might “come after ABC” for “hate” offenses, responding to questions about a “hate speech” crackdown declared by Attorney General Pam Bondi after Kirk’s death.</p><p>Under the First Amendment, a government official like Carr is allowed to call Kimmel talentless or unfunny. He’s allowed to say Kimmel shouldn’t be on the air. He’s <em>not </em>allowed to accompany this with a clear threat backed by government authority. “The easy way or the hard way” isn’t healthy debate, it’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/20/24346317/trump-gangster-tech-regulation-corruption-grift">gangster talk</a>. Or more precisely, government jawboning.</p><p>Even the substantially Trump-picked, overwhelmingly conservative Supreme Court has condemned something very similar to Carr’s conduct. <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2025/09/17/cowardly-disney-caves-to-brendan-carrs-bogus-censorial-threats-pulling-jimmy-kimmel/">Mike Masnick at <em>Techdirt</em> points out</a> that a ruling last year, in the case <em>NRA v. Vullo</em>, declared flatly that “the First Amendment prohibits government officials from relying on the ‘threat of invoking legal sanctions and other means of coercion . . . to achieve the suppression’ of disfavored speech.” That’s true even if they do so through intermediaries like Nexstar rather than attacking the speaker directly.</p><p>Disney, of course, didn’t have to bow to a clearly unconstitutional threat. CEO Bob Iger and Disney Entertainment chief Dana Walden, according to <em>Status</em>, were among the latest powerful figures who made a cowardly decision to appease Carr and Trump rather than stand up for themselves and their employees in public and, if necessary, in court.</p><p>But even if there’s plenty of blame to go around, Carr’s threat is impossible to ignore — and the implicit comparisons to conservative provocateurs being banned on social media, or commentators being fired after outcry for a hateful statement, or any other example of alleged “cancel culture,” off-base. Whatever the underlying offense, this isn’t a private company independently making a business judgment about its public image and financial interests. It’s a government official inserting himself into the process of making entertainment, decreeing what a comedian is allowed to say.</p><p>Carr and Johnson aren’t denying the pressure campaign. Carr responded to a request for comment from <em>Status</em> with a grinning emoji and <a href="https://x.com/BrendanCarrFCC/status/1968449919221416427">thanked Nexstar on X</a> for “doing the right thing.” Johnson <a href="https://x.com/bennyjohnson/status/1968464339515417001">crowed on X</a> that he had “ended Jimmy Kimmel’s career” by bringing Carr on to “announce investigations into ABC and Disney.”<br>It’s unclear whether Kimmel will come back on the air at some point — but either way, the Trump administration’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/779799/republican-charlie-kirk-first-amendment-crackdown-continues">war on free speech</a> is still going strong.</p><p><em><strong>Correction:</strong> The proposed merger between Nexstar and Tegna is worth $6.2 billion, not million.</em></p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/781148/jimmy-kimmel-charlie-kirk-monologue-brendan-carr-censorship-first-amendment#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTcy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Adi Robertson</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p>We have all been there. Your software keeps growing and you feel the need to make it customizable. It is too soon for a full-blown UI with all the bells and whistles, so your pragmatic instinct suggests a text-based configuration file. Yes, that’s exactly it!</p>
<p>You rejoice knowing the software’s configuration will be trivial to version control. Your pragmatic instinct is satisfied as well; the door remains open to creating a proper UI later, since it would be merely a graphical view of your configuration’s structured data. The future is bright!</p>
<p>Now, which language should you pick for your glorious configuration file? It needs to be user-friendly, so people can inspect it and modify it with ease. JSON springs immediately to your mind, but the abundance of brackets and the lack of comments give you pause. TOML maybe? You are afraid it might be too minimal for your needs. Rolling your own language? Too impractical.</p>
<h3 id="yaml">YAML</h3>
<p>A forbidden spark lights inside your head. Any attempts to put it out are futile. It grows and grows until it finally stands ablaze before you, tempting you with its warmth: why not YAML? Yes, YAML, which is so pleasant to the eye and widely used across the industry. How could you say no to that?</p>
<p>Shivers run down your spine as you remember <a href="https://ruudvanasseldonk.com/2023/01/11/the-yaml-document-from-hell">the yaml document from hell</a>. So often have you been warned about YAML’s deceptive simplicity! It’s a traitorous mask, your elders said, behind which a dark being lurks. Don’t ever come near, it will swallow your soul when you least expect it.</p>
<p>And yet… could YAML indeed be the pragmatic solution in this particular case? We are talking about a small configuration file here. What could possibly go wrong? Surely the gods of software wouldn’t punish you for this offense? How could they ask you to swim against the current, when even renowned projects such as Kubernetes use YAML pervasively?</p>
<p>Trembling, you stretch your hand towards the forbidden fruit, reap it and take a good bite. The flavor of instant productivity fills your mouth with delight and you feel confirmed in your choice. Why did you even doubt? After a few code changes your software is configurable through a YAML file. The dopamine surge overwhelms you, and you put the icing on the cake by adding an example configuration to the project’s readme.</p>
<p>But alas, superficial satisfaction cannot last. As the years go by, the sweet flavor in your mouth turns bitter. Your software has grown. The once simple configuration file now spans more than a hundred lines. Yes, the file is pleasant to <em>look</em> at, but <em>modifying</em> it is nothing short of miserable. Why did you disregard ancient wisdom? In silence, you mourn your lost innocence and the fallen state of humanity.</p>
<p>Ah, if you could begin again.</p>
<h3 id="the-crux-of-the-problem">The crux of the problem</h3>
<p>Do you recognize yourself in this story? I have seen it play out a few times and feel like we, as an industry, have somehow come to terms with the miserable situation we are in. Once in a while you may see some brave and noble soul proposing a new configuration language, but so far none has achieved mass adoption. What is going on?</p>
<p>The crux of the problem is, in my eyes, beyond the domain of configuration language choice (i.e., YAML vs. alternatives). We seem to be approaching the very problem of configuration from a flawed starting point, setting way too low expectations for our tools. We are failing to see that configuration files are actually user interfaces, and that they should be treated as such.</p>
<p>Once you start thinking of configuration files as user interfaces, it suddenly makes sense to demand an excellent user experience for working with them. The whole point of a user interface is to make the software accessible, with mechanisms that prevent human error and guide the user down the <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/falling-into-the-pit-of-success/">pit of success</a>. We all recognize bad UX when it feels like you are fighting the computer to achieve a specific goal. In an ideal world, the computer would enhance you without getting in the way, like a <a href="https://www.pixelandtimber.com/bcl-journal/2019/7/11/bicycle-for-the-mind">bicycle for the mind</a>.</p>
<p>What would configuring software look like if our tools were rooted in the “configuration is UI” paradigm? Can we realistically dream of an ecosystem in which configuration is a joy to write and maintain?</p>
<h3 id="a-shout-out-to-kson">A shout out to KSON</h3>
<p>Having come to this point, I’m resisting the urge to present an all-encompassing theory of what configuring software could look like in the perfect world. Instead, I’d like to give a shout out to an existing open source project, which in my eyes is an excellent real-world example of the “configuration is UI” vision. I’m talking about <a href="https://kson.org/">KSON</a>, which just released its first public beta after years in the making. Feel free to check out the <a href="https://kson.org/">website</a>, or go directly to the <a href="https://kson.org/playground/">online playground</a>. That will give you a <em>much</em> better idea of the project than anything I could write here. You know what they say: show, don’t tell.</p>
<p>For those who’d rather skip the links above, let me briefly quote some paragraphs from the <a href="https://kson.org/docs/blog/2025/09/17/introducing-kson/">beta release announcement</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anywhere a human is reading or editing YAML/JSON/TOML, KSON may be used as a more effective interface on that data.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s a bold claim right there! But maybe it’s warranted, especially once you consider the sheer amount of work that has gone into the release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>KSON is a <a href="https://github.com/kson-org/kson/pull/72">verified superset of JSON</a>, has <a href="https://github.com/kson-org/kson/pull/186">native JSON Schema support</a>, transpiles cleanly to <a href="https://github.com/kson-org/kson/pull/80">YAML (with comments preserved!)</a>, and is likely available wherever you want it—current supported platforms: <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@kson_org/kson">JS/TS</a>, <a href="https://pypi.org/project/kson-lang/">Python</a>, <a href="https://crates.io/crates/kson-rs">Rust</a>, <a href="https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/org.kson/kson-jvm">JVM</a>, and <a href="https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/org.kson/kson">Kotlin Multiplatform</a>.</p>
<p>KSON is also widely available in developer tools, with support for <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kson.kson">VS Code</a>, <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/28510-kson-language">Jetbrains IDEs</a>, and anywhere you can plug in an <a href="https://github.com/kson-org/kson/blob/main/tooling/language-server-protocol/README.md">LSP</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>See the appendix at the end of this article for an example KSON document. You will notice that the language feels familiar and that it has been designed from the ground up to provide an excellent editing experience. Also, advanced language support in code editors is to me a great example of the “configuration is UI” paradigm. It lets the document come to life under your fingertips, instead of being a dead text file.</p>
<h3 id="join-the-movement">Join the movement</h3>
<p>What a breath of fresh air! I’m hoping the vision of user-friendly configuration keeps unfolding over time, be it inside the KSON project or elsewhere. We, as an industry, should really set a new standard in which it’s normal and even expected to provide a top-tier configuration editing experience. There are so many possibilities<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>!</p>
<p>In case it’s not clear yet, I’m enthusiastic about KSON. If you visit the <a href="https://github.com/kson-org/kson/">open source repository</a>, you will probably see me among the contributors to the project<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. Besides the technical merits of KSON, I’m impressed by the driving force behind it: a small community of engineers has decided to bite the bullet and craft open software configuration tools that put humans first. It truly is “a love letter to the humans maintaining computer configurations”, as it says in the repository’s tagline.</p>
<p>To me, KSON is more than a new language or a collection of tools. It is an attempt to bootstrap a developer movement based in the “configuration is UI” principle. If that resonates with you, please join us in our effort! Merely trying out KSON is already a good start. And, if you end up liking it, go use it wherever it makes sense. Finally, feel free to chat with us on <a href="https://kson-org.zulipchat.com/">Zulip</a> any time. I’m looking forward to meeting you there!</p>

One example of that is indentation handling: the code snippet above is indented in a way that makes the structure of the document evident. But, contrary to YAML, having “wrong” indentation does not break your configuration. If you were to remove or randomize the leading spaces for every line, the following would happen:</p>
<ol>
<li>The document would parse to the same object as before.</li>
<li>KSON would warn you that the document’s formatting is confusing, because the indentation doesn’t match the structure of the document (fortunately, the autoformatter can trivially fix the warning for you on save).</li>
</ol>
<p>An additional feature that is not immediately apparent here is that the embedded SQL is actually “alive”. A properly configured editor will see more than a multiline string there! It will know that it’s SQL, it will provide syntax highlighting for it, validation, and all other goodies you are used to when dealing with code.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://kson.org/">official website</a> for more information and a space to play with KSON right from your browser.</p>

<li>Samsung has confirmed the pilot program, though some Cover Screen themes will remain ad-free.</li>
</ul>
</div><p>Samsung started rolling out an <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-smart-refrigerators-ads-3598564/">update to its refrigerators that brought ads to the display</a>, whether you like it or not. The whole situation is rather surreal but not entirely unsurprising. There were some doubts that the changelog wasn’t real or that it belonged to a different product. Now, Samsung has confirmed to us that ads are indeed coming to its refrigerators.</p><div>
<p>We had reached out to Samsung for a statement, and this is what a Samsung spokesperson said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Samsung is committed to innovation and enhancing every day value for our home appliance customers. As part of our ongoing efforts to strengthen that value, we are conducting a pilot program to offer promotions and curated advertisements on certain Samsung Family Hub refrigerator models in the U.S. market.</p>

<p>As a part of this pilot program, Family Hub refrigerators in the U.S. will receive an over-the-network (OTN) software update with Terms of Service (T&amp;C) and Privacy Notice (PN). Advertising will appear on certain Family Hub refrigerator Cover Screens. The Cover Screen appears when a Family Hub screen is idle. Ad design format may change depending on Family Hub personalization options for the Cover Screen, and advertising will not appear when Cover Screen displays Art Mode or picture albums.</p>

<p>Advertisements can be dismissed on the Cover Screens where ads are shown, meaning that specific ads will not appear again during the campaign period.</p></blockquote>
<p>As the statement notes, this is a pilot program for certain Samsung Family Hub refrigerator models sold in the US. As part of the program, these refrigerators will display “promotions and curated advertisements” on certain Cover Screens when the Family Hub screen (i.e., the door display) is idle.</p></div><p>The company notes that ads can be dismissed, and dismissed ads will not appear again. The ad design format will also change depending on the Cover Screen’s personalization options. Ads will not appear when the Cover Screen displays photos or art.</p><p>From the changelog, we know that ads will be displayed on the Cover Screen for the Weather, Color, and Daily Board themes, whereas the Cover Screen for the Art and Gallery themes will not display advertisements, in line with the company’s statement.</p><p>It’s still unclear which exact refrigerators are getting the ad infestation, but Samsung’s current Family Hub-equipped lineup in the US starts at $1,800 and goes all the way up to $3,500. It doesn’t seem like users can entirely turn off ads, which is a shame. Disconnecting the fridge from the internet might stop the ads, but you will also inevitably lose out on several smart features you paid for. If you have a Samsung refrigerator with a door display, let us know in the comments how your experience has been with them, and how you feel about ads coming to them.</p><div data-container-type="content"><p>Thank you for being part of our community.

<p dir="auto">Energy-efficient AI inference framework &amp; kernels for phones &amp; AI-native hardware.
Budget and mid-range phones control over 70% of the market, but frameworks today optimise for the highend phones.
Cactus is designed bottom-up with no dependencies for all mobile devices.</p>

<p>XTX is an algorithmic trading firm: it builds statistical models that produce price forecasts for over 50,000 financial instruments worldwide. We use those forecasts to make trades. As XTX's research efforts to build better models ramped up, the demand for resources kept increasing.</p>
<p>The firm started out with a couple of desktops and an NFS server, and 10 years later ended up with tens of thousands of high-end GPUs, hundreds of thousands of CPUs, and hundreds of petabytes of storage.</p>
<p>As compute grew, storage struggled to keep up. We rapidly outgrew NFS first and existing open-source and commercial filesystems later. After evaluating a variety of third-party solutions, we made the decision to implement our own filesystem, which we called TernFS<sup><a href="#f1">[1]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>We have decided to open source our efforts: TernFS is <a href="https://github.com/XTXMarkets/ternfs">available as free software on our public GitHub.</a> This post <a href="#another-filesystem">motivates TernFS</a>, explains its <a href="#high-level">high-level architecture</a>, and then explores some <a href="#important-details">key implementation details</a>. If you just want to spin up a local TernFS cluster, head to the <a href="https://github.com/XTXMarkets/ternfs?tab=readme-ov-file#playing-with-a-local-ternfs-instance">README</a>.</p>

<h2>Another filesystem?</h2>
<p>There's a reason why every major tech company has developed its own distributed filesystem — they're crucial to running large-scale compute efforts, and liable to cause intense disruption if they malfunction. <sup><a href="#f2">[2]</a></sup></p>

<p>XTX was in the same position, so we designed TernFS to be a one-stop solution for most of our storage needs, going from relatively 'cold' storage of raw market data to short-lived random-access data used to communicate between GPU jobs running on our cluster.</p>
<p>TernFS:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is designed to scale up to tens of exabytes, trillions of files, millions of concurrent clients.</li>
<li>Stores file contents redundantly to protect against drive failures.</li>
<li>Has no single point of failure in its metadata services.</li>
<li>Supports file snapshot to protect against accidental file deletion.</li>
<li>Can span across multiple regions.</li>
<li>Is hardware agnostic and uses TCP/IP to communicate.</li>
<li>Utilizes different types of storage (such as flash vs. hard disks) cost effectively.</li>
<li>Exposes read/write access through its own API over TCP and UDP, and a Linux kernel filesystem module.</li>
<li>Requires no external service and has a minimal set of build dependencies. <sup><a href="#f3">[3]</a></sup></li>
</ul>

<p>Naturally, there are some limitations, the main ones being:</p>
<ul>
<li>Files are immutable — once they're written they can't be modified.</li>
<li>TernFS should not be used for tiny files — our median file size is 2MB.</li>
<li>The throughput of directory creation and removal is significantly constrained compared to other operations.</li>
<li>TernFS is permissionless, deferring that responsibility to other services.</li>
</ul>
<p>We started designing TernFS in early 2022 and began putting it into production in summer 2023. By mid-2024 all of our machine learning efforts were driven out of TernFS, and we're migrating the rest of the firm's storage needs onto it as well.</p>
<p>As of September 2025, our TernFS deployment stores more than 500PB across 30,000 disks, 10,000 flash drives, and three data centres. At peak we serve multiple terabytes per second. To this day, we haven't lost a single byte.</p>

<h2>High-level overview</h2>
<p>Now that the stage is set, we're ready to explain the various components that make up TernFS. TernFS' core API is implemented by four services:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Metadata shards</em> store the directory structure and file metadata.</li>
<li>The <em>cross-directory coordinator</em> (or CDC) executes cross-shard transactions.</li>
<li><em>Block services</em> store file contents.</li>
<li>The <em>registry</em> stores information about all the other services and monitors them.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the next few sections, we'll describe the high-level design of each service and then give more background on <a href="#important-details">other relevant implementation details</a>.<sup><a href="#f4">[4]</a></sup></p>

<h3>Metadata</h3>
<p>To talk about metadata, we first need to explain what metadata <em>is</em> in TernFS. The short answer is: 'everything that is not file contents.' The slightly longer answer is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Directory entries, including all files and directory names.</li>
<li>File metadata including creation/modification/access time, logical file size, and so on.</li>
<li>The mapping between files and the <a href="#block-services">blocks containing their contents</a>.</li>
<li>Other ancillary data structures to facilitate maintenance operations.</li>
</ul>
<p>TernFS' metadata is split into 256 logical <em>shards</em>. Shards never communicate with each other. This is a general principle in TernFS: each service is disaggregated from the others, deferring to the clients to communicate with each service directly.<sup><a href="#f5">[5]</a></sup></p>

<p>A logical shard is further split into five physical instances, one leader and four followers, in a typical distributed consensus setup. The distributed consensus engine is provided by a purpose-built Raft-like implementation, which we call LogsDB, while RocksDB is used to implement read/write capabilities within a shard instance.</p>
<p>Currently all reads and writes go through the leader, but it would be trivial to allow clients to read from followers, and with a bit more effort to switch to a write-write setup.</p>

<p>Splitting the metadata into 256 shards from the get-go simplifies the design, given that horizontal scaling of metadata requires no rebalancing, just the addition of more metadata servers.</p>
<p>For instance, our current deployment can serve hundreds of petabytes and more than 100,000 compute nodes with just 10 metadata servers per data centre, with each server housing roughly 25 shard leaders and 100 shard followers.</p>
<p>Given that the metadata servers are totally decoupled from one another, this means that we can scale metadata performance by 25× trivially, and by 100× if we were to start offloading metadata requests to followers.</p>
<p>TernFS shards metadata by assigning each directory to a single shard. This is done in a simple round-robin fashion by the <a href="#cdc">cross-directory coordinator</a>. Once a directory is created, all its directory entries and the files in it are housed in the same shard.</p>
<p>This design decision has downsides: TernFS assumes that the load will be spread across the 256 logical shards naturally. This is not a problem in large deployments, given that they will contain many directories, but it is something to keep in mind.<sup><a href="#f6">[6]</a></sup></p>


<h3>Cross-directory transactions</h3>
<p>Most of the metadata activity is contained within a single shard:</p>
<ul>
<li>File creation, same-directory renames, and deletion.</li>
<li>Listing directory contents.</li>
<li>Getting attributes of files or directories.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, some operations do require coordination between shards, namely directory creation, directory removal, and moving directory entries across different directories.</p>
<p>The <em>cross-directory coordinator</em> (CDC) performs these distributed transactions using a privileged metadata shard API. The CDC transactions are stateful, and therefore the CDC uses RocksDB and LogsDB much like the metadata shards themselves to persist its state safely.</p>

<p>The CDC executes transactions in parallel, which increases throughput considerably, but it is still a bottleneck when it comes to creating, removing, or moving directories. This means that TernFS has a relatively low throughput when it comes to CDC operations.<sup><a href="#f7">[7]</a></sup> <a name="block-services"></a></p>

<h3>Block services, or file contents</h3>
<p>In TernFS, files are split into chunks of data called <em>blocks</em>. Blocks are read and written to by <em>block services</em>. A block service is typically a single drive (be it a hard disk or a flash drive) storing blocks. At XTX a typical storage server will contain around 100 hard disks or 25 flash drives — or in TernFS parlance 100 or 25 block services.<sup><a href="#f8">[8]</a></sup></p>

<p>Read/write access to the block service is provided using a simple TCP API currently implemented by a Go process. This process is hardware agnostic and uses the Go standard library to read and write blocks to a conventional local file system. We originally planned to rewrite the Go process in C++, and possibly write to block devices directly, but the idiomatic Go implementation has proven performant enough for our needs so far. <a name="registry"></a></p>
<h3>The registry</h3>
<p>The final piece of the TernFS puzzle is the <em>registry</em>. The registry stores the location of each instance of service (be it a metadata shard, the CDC, or a block storage node). A client only needs to know the address of the registry to mount TernFS — it'll then gather the locations of the other services from it.</p>
<p>In TernFS all locations are IPv4 addresses. Working with IPv4 directly simplifies the kernel module considerably, since DNS lookups are quite awkward in the Linux kernel. The exception to this rule is addressing the registry itself, for which DNS is used.</p>
<p>The registry also stores additional information, such as the capacity and available size of each drive, who is a follower or a leader in LogsDB clusters, and so on.</p>
<p>Predictably, the registry itself is a RocksDB and LogsDB C++ process, given its statefulness. <a name="going-global"></a></p>
<h3>Going global</h3>
<p>TernFS tries very hard not to lose data, by storing both metadata and file contents on many different drives and servers. However, we also want to be resilient to the temporary or even permanent loss of one entire data centre. Therefore, TernFS can transparently scale across multiple <em>locations</em>.</p>
<p>The intended use for TernFS locations is for each location to converge to the same dataset. This means that each location will have to be provisioned with roughly equal resources.<sup><a href="#f9">[9]</a></sup> Both metadata and file contents replication are asynchronous. In general, we judge the event of losing an entire data centre rare enough to tolerate a time window where data is not fully replicated across locations.</p>

<p>Metadata replication is set up so that one location is the metadata primary. Write operations in non-primary locations pay a latency price since they are acknowledged only after they are written to the primary location, replicated, and applied in the originating location. In practice this hasn't been an issue since metadata write latencies are generally overshadowed by writing file contents.</p>
<p>There is no automated procedure to migrate off a metadata primary location — again, we deem it a rare enough occurrence to tolerate manual intervention. In the future we plan to move from the current protocol to a multi-master protocol where each location can commit writes independently, which would reduce write latencies on secondary locations and remove the privileged status of the primary location.</p>
<p>File contents, unlike metadata, are written locally to the location the client is writing from. Replication to other locations happens in two ways: proactively and on-demand. Proactive replication is performed by tailing the metadata log and replicating new file contents. On-demand replication happens when a client requests file content which has not been replicated yet. <a name="important-details"></a> <a name="speaking-ternfs"></a></p>
<h2>Important Details</h2>
<p>Now that we've laid down the high-level design of TernFS, we can talk about several key implementation details that make TernFS safer, more performant, and more flexible.</p>
<h3>Talking to TernFS</h3>
<h4>Speaking TernFS' language</h4>
<p>The most direct way to talk to TernFS is by using its own API. All TernFS messages are defined using a custom serialization format we call <em>bincode</em>. We chose to develop a custom serialization format since we needed it to work within the confines of the <a href="#posix-shaped">Linux kernel</a> and to be easily chopped into UDP packets.</p>
<p>We intentionally kept the TernFS API stateless, in the sense that each request executes without regard to previous requests made by the same client. This is in contrast to protocols like NFS, whereby each connection is very stateful, holding resources such as open files, locks, and so on.</p>
<p>A stateless API dramatically simplifies the state machines that make up the TernFS core services, therefore simplifying their testing. It also forces each request to be idempotent, or in any case have clear retry semantics, since they might have to be replayed, which facilitates testing further.</p>
<p>It also allows the metadata shards and CDC API to be based on UDP rather than TCP, which makes the server and clients (especially the kernel module) simpler, due to doing away with the need for keeping TCP connections. The block service API is TCP based, since it is used to stream large amounts of contiguous data, and any UDP implementation would have to re-implement a reliable stream protocol. The registry API is also TCP-based, given that it is rarely used by clients, and occasionally needs to return large amounts of data.</p>
<p>While the TernFS API is simple out-of-the-box, we provide a permissively licensed Go library implementing common tasks that clients might want to perform, such as caching directory policies and retrying requests. This library is used to implement many TernFS processes that are not part of the core TernFS services, such as <a href="#scrubbing">scrubbing</a>, <a href="#snapshots">garbage collection</a>, <a href="#migrations">migrations</a>, and the <a href="#web-ui">web UI</a>.</p>

<h4>Making TernFS POSIX-shaped</h4>
<p>While the Go library is used for most ancillary tasks, some with high performance requirements, the main way to access TernFS at XTX is through its Linux kernel module.</p>
<p>This is because, when migrating our machine learning workflows to TernFS, we needed to support a vast codebase working with files directly. This not only meant that we needed to expose TernFS as a normal filesystem, but also that said normal filesystem API needed to be robust and performant enough for our machine learning needs.<sup><a href="#f10">[10]</a></sup></p>

<p>For this reason, we opted to work with Linux directly, rather than using FUSE. Working directly with the Linux kernel not only gave us the confidence that we could achieve our performance requirements but also allowed us to bend the POSIX API to our needs, something that would have been more difficult if we had used FUSE.<sup><a href="#f11">[11]</a></sup></p>

<p>The main obstacle when exposing TernFS as a 'normal' filesystem is that TernFS files are immutable. More specifically, TernFS files are fully written before being 'linked' into the filesystem as a directory entry. This is intentional: it lets us cleanly separate the API for 'under construction' files and 'completed files', and it means that half-written files are not visible.</p>
<p>However this design is essentially incompatible with POSIX, which endows the user with near-absolute freedom when it comes to manipulating a file. Therefore, the TernFS kernel module is <em>not</em> POSIX-compliant, but rather exposes enough POSIX to allow many programs to work without modifications, but not all.</p>
<p>In practice this means that programs which write files left-to-right and never modify the files' contents will work out-of-the-box. While this might seem very restrictive, we found that a surprising number of programs worked just fine.<sup><a href="#f12">[12]</a></sup> Programs that did not follow this pattern were modified to first write to a temporary file and then copy the finished file to TernFS.</p>

<p>While we feel that writing our own kernel module was the right approach, it proved to be the trickiest part of TernFS, and we would not have been able to implement it without <a href="#block-proofs">some important safety checks</a> in the TernFS core services.<sup><a href="#f13">[13]</a></sup></p>

<h4>S3 gateway</h4>
<p>Almost all the storage-related activity at XTX is due to our machine-learning efforts, and for those purposes the TernFS' kernel module has served us well. However, as TernFS proved itself there, we started to look into offering TernFS to the broader firm.</p>
<p>Doing so through the kernel module presented multiple challenges. For starters installing a custom kernel module on every machine that needed to reach TernFS is operationally cumbersome. Moreover, while all machine-learning happens in clusters housed in the same data centre as TernFS itself, we wanted to expose TernFS in a way that's more amenable to less local networks, for instance by removing the need for UDP. Finally, TernFS does not have any built-in support for permissions or authentication, which is a requirement in multi-tenant scenarios.</p>
<p>To solve all these problems, we implemented a gateway for TernFS, which exposes a TernFS subtree using the S3 API. The gateway is a simple Go process turning S3 calls into TernFS API calls. The S3 gateway is not currently open sourced since it is coupled to authentication services internal to XTX, but we have open sourced a minimal S3 gateway to serve as a starting point for third-party contributors to build their own.</p>
<p>We've also planned an NFS gateway to TernFS, but we haven't had a pressing enough need yet to complete it.</p>

<h4>The web UI and the JSON interface</h4>
<p>Finally, a view of TernFS is provided by its web UI. The web UI is a stateless Go program which exposes most of the state of TernFS in an easy-to-use interface. This state includes the full filesystem contents (both metadata and file contents), the status of each service including information about decommissioned block services, and so on.</p>
<p>Moreover, the web UI also exposes the <a href="#speaking-ternfs">direct TernFS API</a> in JSON form, which is very useful for small scripts and curl-style automation that does not warrant a full-blown Go program.</p>

<h3>Directory Policies</h3>
<p>To implement some of the functionality we'll describe below, TernFS adopts a system of per-directory policies.</p>
<p>Policies are used for all sorts of decisions, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#reed-solomon">How to redundantly store files.</a></li>
<li><a href="#drive-type-picking">On which type of drive to store files.</a></li>
<li><a href="#snapshots">How long to keep files around after deletion.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Each of the topics above (and a few more we haven't mentioned) correspond to a certain policy <em>tag</em>. The body of the policies are stored in the metadata together with the other directory attributes.</p>
<p>Policies are inherited: if a directory does not contain a certain policy tag, it transitively inherits from the parent directory. TernFS clients store a cache of policies to allow for traversal-free policy lookup for most directories.</p>
<h3>Keeping blocks in check</h3>
<p>A filesystem is no good if it loses, leaks, corrupts, or otherwise messes up its data. TernFS deploys a host of measures to minimize the chance of anything going wrong. So far, these have worked: we've never lost data in our production deployment of TernFS. This section focuses on the measures in place to specifically safeguard files' blocks.</p>
<h4>Against bitrot, or CRC32-C</h4>
<p>The first and possibly most obvious measure consists of aggressively checksumming all TernFS' data. The metadata is automatically checksummed by RocksDB, and every block is stored in a format interleaving 4KiB pages with 4byte CRC32-C checksums.</p>
<p>CRC32-C was picked since it is a high-quality checksum and implemented on most modern silicon.<sup><a href="#f14">[14]</a></sup> It also exhibits some desirable properties when used together with <a href="#block-proofs">Reed-Solomon coding</a>.</p>

<p>4KiB was picked since it is the read boundary used by Linux filesystems and is fine-grained while still being large enough to render the storage overhead of the 4byte checksums negligible.</p>
<p>Interleaving the CRCs with the block contents does not add any safety, but it does improve operations in two important ways. First, it allows for safe partial reads: clients can demand only a few pages from a block which is many megabytes in size and still check the reads against its checksum. Second, it allows <a href="#scrubbing">scrubbing</a> files locally on the server which hosts the blocks, without communicating with other services at all.</p>

<h4>Storing files redundantly, or Reed-Solomon codes</h4>
<p>We've been talking about files being split into blocks, but we haven't really explained <em>how</em> files become blocks.</p>
<p>The first thing we do to a file is split it into <em>spans</em>. Spans are at most 100MiB and are present just to divide files into sections of a manageable size.</p>
<p>Then each span is divided into D <em>data blocks</em>, and P <em>parity blocks</em>. D and P are determined by the corresponding <a href="#directory-policies">directory policy</a> in which the file is created. When D is 1, the entire contents of the span become a single block, and that block is stored D+P times. This scheme is equivalent to a simple mirroring scheme and allows it to lose up to P blocks before losing file data.</p>
<p>While wasteful, mirroring the entire contents of the file can be useful for very hot files, since TernFS clients will pick a block at random to read from, thereby sharing the read load across many block services. And naturally files which we do not care much for can be stored with D = 1 and P = 0, without any redundancy.</p>
<p>That said, most files will not be stored using mirroring but rather using Reed-Solomon coding. Other resources can be consulted to understand the <a href="https://mazzo.li/posts/reed-solomon.html">high-level idea</a> and the <a href="https://www.corsix.org/content/reed-solomon-for-software-raid">low-level details</a> of Reed-Solomon coding, but the gist is it allows us to split a span into D equally sized blocks (some padding might be necessary), and then generate P blocks of equal size such that up to any P blocks can be lost while retaining the ability to reconstruct all the other blocks.</p>
<p>As mentioned, D and P are fully configurable, but at XTX we tend to use D = 10 and P = 4, which allows us to lose up to any four drives for any file.</p>

<h4>Drive type picking</h4>
<p>We now know how to split files into a bunch of blocks. The next question is: which drives to pick to store the blocks on. The first decision is which kind of drive to use. At XTX we separate drives into two broad categories for this purpose — flash and spinning disks.</p>
<p>When picking between these two, we want to balance two needs: minimizing the cost of hardware by utilizing hard disks if we can <sup><a href="#f15">[15]</a></sup>, and maximizing hard disk productivity by having them reading data most of the time, rather than seeking.</p>

<p>To achieve that, directory policies offer a way to tune how large each block will be, and to tune which drives will be picked based on block size. This allows us to configure TernFS so that larger files that can be read sequentially are stored on hard disks, while random-access or small files are stored on flash. <sup><a href="#f16">[16]</a></sup></p>

<p>Currently this system is not adaptive, but we found that in practice it's easy to carve out sections of the filesystem which are not read sequentially. We have a default configuration which assumes sequential reads and then uses hard disks down to roughly 2.5MB blocks, below which hard disks stop being productive enough and blocks start needing to be written to flash. <a name="block-service-picking"></a></p>
<h4>Block service picking</h4>
<p>OK, we now know what type of drive to select for our files, but we still have tens of thousands of individual drives to pick from. Picking the 'right' individual drive requires some sophistication.</p>
<p>The first thing to note is that drive failures or unavailability are often correlated. For instance, at XTX a single server handles 102 spinning disks. If the server is down, faulty, or needs to be decommissioned, it'll render its 102 disks temporarily or permanently unavailable.</p>
<p>It's therefore wise to spread a file's blocks across many servers. To achieve this, each TernFS block service (which generally corresponds to a single drive) has a <em>failure domain</em>. When picking block services in which to store the blocks for a given file, TernFS will make sure that each block is in a separate failure domain. In our TernFS deployment a failure domain corresponds to a server, but other users might wish to tie it to some other factor as appropriate.</p>
<p>TernFS also tries hard to avoid write bottlenecks by spreading the current write load across many disks. Moreover, since new drives can be added at any time, it tries to converge to a situation where each drive is roughly equally filled by assigning writing more to drives with more available space.</p>
<p>Mechanically this is achieved by having each shard periodically request a set of block services to use for writing from the registry. When handing out block services to shards, the registry selects block services according to several constraints:</p>
<ul>
<li>It never gives block services from the same failure domain to the same shard</li>
<li>It minimizes the variance in how many shards each block service is currently assigned to</li>
<li>It prioritizes block services which have more available space.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then when a client wants to write a new span, requiring D+P blocks, the shard simply selects D+P block services randomly amongst the ones it last received from the registry.</p>
<p>One concept currently absent from TernFS is what is often known as 'copyset replication'. When assigning disks to files at random (even with the caveat of failure domains) the probability of rendering at least one file unreadable quickly becomes a certainty as more and more drives fail:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.xtxmarkets.com/assets/tech/2025-ternfs-faileddisks.png" alt="Probability of data loss vs Failed disks" title="Probability of data loss vs Failed disks"></p>

<p>Copysets reduce the likelihood of data loss occurring by choosing blocks out of a limited number of sets of drives, as opposed to picking the drives randomly. This dramatically reduces the probability of data loss<sup><a href="#f17">[17]</a></sup>.  They are generally a good idea, but we haven't found them to be worthwhile, for a few reasons.</p>

<p>First, evacuating a 20TB drive takes just a few minutes, and in the presence of multiple failed drives the migrator process evacuates first the files which are present in multiple failed drives to get ahead of possible data loss. This means that for TernFS to lose data within a single data centre tens of drives would have to fail within a matter of seconds.</p>
<p>More importantly, our TernFS deployment is replicated across three data centres. This replication eliminates the chance of losing data due to 'independent' drive failures — thousands of drives would need to fail at once. Obviously, data centre wide events <em>can</em> cause a large proportion of the drives within it to fail, but having such an event in three data centres at once is exceedingly unlikely.</p>
<p>Finally, copysets are not without drawbacks or complications. Assigning drives at random is an optimal strategy when it comes to evacuating drives quickly, since the files with blocks in the drives to be evacuated will be evenly spread over the rest of the filesystem, and since we only ever need to replace the failed blocks given that we're not constrained by fitting the new set of blocks in predetermined copysets. This means that the evacuation procedure will not be bottlenecked by drive throughput, which is what enables evacuation to finish in a matter of minutes. Moreover, the algorithm to distribute drives to shards is significantly simpler and more flexible than if it needed to care about copysets.</p>
<p>However, users that wish to deploy TernFS within a single data centre might wish to implement some form of copyset replication. Such a change would be entirely contained to the registry and would not change any other component.</p>

<h4>Block Proofs</h4>
<p>We now have a solid scheme to store files redundantly (thanks to Reed-Solomon codes) and protect against bitrot (thanks to the checksums). However, said schemes are only as good as their implementation.</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, TernFS clients communicate their intention to write a file to metadata servers, the metadata servers select block services that the blocks should be written to, and the clients then write the blocks to block services independently of the metadata services. The same happens when a client wants to erase blocks: the client first communicates its intentions to delete the blocks to the right metadata shard and then performs the erasing itself.</p>
<p>This poses a challenge. While verifying the correctness of the core TernFS services is feasible, verifying all clients is not, but we'd still like to prevent buggy clients from breaking key invariants of the filesystem.</p>
<p>Buggy clients can wreak havoc in several ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>They can <em>leak data</em> by writing blocks to block services that are not referenced anywhere in the metadata.</li>
<li>They can <em>lose data</em> by erasing blocks which are still referenced in metadata.</li>
<li>They can <em>corrupt data</em> by telling the metadata services they'll write something and then writing something else.</li>
</ul>
<p>We address all these points by using what we call <em>block proofs</em>. To illustrate how block proofs work, it's helpful to go through the steps required to write new data to a file.</p>
<ol>
<li>When a client is creating a file, it'll do so by adding its <a href="#reed-solomon">file spans</a> one-by-one. For each span the client wants to add it sends an 'initiate span creation' request to the right metadata shard. This request contains both the overall checksum of the span, and the checksum of each block in it (including parity blocks).</li>
<li>The metadata shard checks the consistency of the checksum of the span and of its blocks, something it can do thanks to <a href="https://mazzo.li/posts/rs-crc.html">some desirable mathematical properties</a> of CRCs.</li>
<li>The shard picks block services for the blocks to be written in and returns this information to the client together with a signature for each 'block write' instruction.</li>
<li>The client forwards this signature to the block services, which will refuse to write the block without it. Crucially, the cryptographic signature ranges over a unique identity for the block (ensuring we only write the block we mean to write), together with its checksum, ensuring we don't write the wrong data.<sup><a href="#f18">[18]</a></sup></li>
<li>After committing the block to disk, the block service returns a 'block written' signature to the client.</li>
<li>Finally, the client forwards the block written signature back to the shard, which certifies that the span has been written only when it has received the signatures for all the blocks that make up the span. <sup><a href="#f19">[19]</a></sup></li>
</ol>

<p>Similarly, when a client wants to delete a span, it first asks the metadata shard to start doing so. The metadata shard marks the span as 'in deletion' and returns a bunch of 'block erase' signatures to the client. The client then forwards the signatures to the block services that hold the blocks, which delete the blocks, and return a 'block erased' signature. The clients forward these signatures back to the metadata shards, which can then forget about the span entirely.</p>

<p>We use AES to generate the signatures for simplicity but note that the goal here is not protecting ourselves from malicious clients — just buggy ones. The keys used for the signature are not kept secret, and CRC32-C is not a secure checksum. That said, we've found this scheme enormously valuable in the presence of <a href="#posix-shaped">complex clients</a>. We spent considerable efforts making the core services very simple so we could then take more implementation risks in the clients, with the knowledge that we would have a very low chance of corrupting the filesystem itself.</p>

<h4>Scrubbing</h4>
<p>Finally, if things go wrong, we need to notice. The most common failure mode for a drive is for it to fail entirely, in which case our internal hardware monitoring system will pick it up and migrate from it automatically. The more insidious (and still very common) case is a single sector failing in a drive, which will only be noticed when we try to read the block involving that sector.</p>
<p>This is acceptable for files which are read frequently, but some files might be very 'cold' but still very important.</p>
<p>Consider the case of raw market data taps which are immediately converted to some processed, lossy format. While we generally will use the file containing the processed data, it's paramount to store the raw market data forever so that if we ever want to include more information from the original market data, we can. So important cold files might go months or even years without anyone reading them, and in the meantime, we might find that enough blocks have been corrupted to render them unreadable.<sup><a href="#f20">[20]</a></sup></p>

<p>To make sure this does not happen, a process called the <em>scrubber</em> continuously reads every block that TernFS stores, and replaces blocks with bad sectors before they can cause too much damage.</p>

<h3>Snapshots and garbage collection</h3>
<p>We've talked at length about what TernFS does to try to prevent data loss due to hardware failure or bugs in clients. However, the most common type of data loss is due to human error — the <code>rm —rf / home/alice/notes.txt</code> scenario.</p>
<p>To protect against these scenarios, TernFS implements a lightweight snapshotting system. When files or directories are deleted, their contents aren't actually deleted. Instead, a weak reference to them is created. We call such weak references <em>snapshot</em> directory entries.</p>
<p>Snapshot entries are not be visible through the kernel module or the S3 gateway, but are visible through <a href="#speaking-ternfs">the direct API</a>, and at XTX we have developed internal tooling to easily recover deleted files through it.<sup><a href="#f21">[21]</a></sup> Deleted files are also visible through the TernFS web UI.</p>

<p>Given that 'normal' file operations do not delete files, but rather make them a snapshot, the task of freeing up space is delegated to an external Go process, the <em>garbage collector</em>. The garbage collector traverses the filesystem and removes expired snapshots, which involves deleting their blocks permanently. Snapshot expiry is predictably regulated by <a href="#directory-policies">directory policies</a>.</p>
<h3>Keeping TernFS healthy</h3>
<p>This last section covers how we (humans of XTX) notice problems in TernFS, and how TernFS self-heals when things go wrong — both key topics if we want to ensure no data loss and notice performance problems early.</p>
<h4>Performance metrics</h4>
<p>TernFS exposes a plethora of performance metrics through the HTTP <a href="https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v2/reference/syntax/line-protocol/">InfluxDB line protocol</a>. While connecting TernFS to a service which ingests these metrics is optional, it is <em>highly</em> recommended for any production service.</p>
<p>Moreover, the kernel module exposes many performance metrics itself through DebugFS.</p>
<p>Both types of metrics, especially when used in tandem, have proved invaluable to resolve performance problems quickly.</p>
<h4>Logging and alerts</h4>
<p>TernFS services log their output to files in a simple line-based format. The internal logging API is extremely simple and includes support for syslog levels out-of-the-box. At XTX we run TernFS as normal systemd services and use journalctl to view logs.</p>
<p>As with metrics, the kernel module includes various logging facilities as well. The first type of logging is just through dmesg, but the kernel module also includes numerous tracepoints for low-overhead opt-in logging of many operations.</p>
<p>TernFS is also integrated with XTX's internal alerting system, called <em>XMon</em>, to page on call developers when things go wrong. XMon is not open source, but all the alerts are also rendered as error lines in logs. <sup><a href="#f22">[22]</a></sup> We plan to eventually move to having alerts feed off performance metrics, which would make them independent from XMon, although we don't have plans to do so in the short-term. <a name="migrations"></a></p>

<h4>Migrations</h4>
<p>Finally, there's the question of what to do when drives die — and they will die, frequently, when you have 50,000 of them. While drives dying is not surprising, we've been surprised at the variety of different drive failures. <sup><a href="#f23">[23]</a></sup> A malfunctioning drive might:</p>

<ul>
<li>Produce IO errors when reading specific files. This is probably due to a single bad sector.</li>
<li>Produce IO errors when reading or writing anything. This might happen because enough bad sectors have gone bad and the drive cannot remap them, or for a variety of other reasons.</li>
<li>Return wrong data. This is usually caught by the built-in error correction codes in the hard drives, but not always.</li>
<li>Lie about data being successfully persisted. This can manifest in a variety of ways: file size being wrong on open, file contents being partially zero'd out, and so on.</li>
<li>Disappear from the mount list, only to reappear when the machine is rebooted, but missing some data.</li>
</ul>
<p>When clients fail to read from a drive, they'll automatically fall back on other drives to reconstruct the missing data, which is extremely effective in hiding failures from the end-user. That said, something needs to be done about the bad drives, and <a href="#block-service-picking">done quickly to avoid permanent data loss</a>.</p>
<p>The TernFS registry allows marking drives as faulty. Faulty drives are then picked up by the <em>migrator</em>, a Go process which waits for bad drives and then stores all its blocks onto freshly picked block services.</p>
<p>TernFS also tries to mark drives as bad automatically using a simple heuristic based on the rate of IO errors the drive is experiencing. The number of drives automatically marked as faulty is throttled to avoid having this check go awry and mark the whole cluster as faulty, which would not be catastrophic but would still be messy to deal with.</p>
<p>Moreover, drives that are faulty in subtle ways might not be picked up by the heuristics, which means that occasionally a sysadmin will need to mark a drive as faulty manually, after which the migrator will evacuate them.</p>
<h2>Closing thoughts</h2>
<p>At XTX we feel strongly about utilizing our resources efficiently. When it comes to software, this means having software that gets close to some theoretical optimum when it comes to total cost of ownership. This culture was borne out by competing hard for technological excellence when doing on-exchange trading at first, and by our ever-growing hardware costs as our business has grown later.</p>
<p>Such idealized tools might not exist or be available yet, in which case we're happy to be the tool makers. TernFS is a perfect example of this and we're excited to open source this component of our business for the community.</p>
<p>Crucially, the cost of implementation of a new solution is often overblown compared to the cost of tying yourself to an ill-fitting, expensive third-party solution. Designing and implementing a solution serving exactly your needs allows for much greater simplicity. If the requirements do change, as often happens, changes can be implemented very quickly, again only catering to your needs.</p>
<p>That said, we believe that TernFS' set of trade-offs are widely shared across many organizations dealing with large-scale storage workloads, and we hope we'll contribute to <a href="https://xkcd.com/927/">at least slowing down the seemingly constant stream of new filesystems</a>.</p>
