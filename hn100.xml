      <h3>I
        suggest watching these through immediately, even though it's a bit
        overwhelming, just to get a sense of what sorts of things are there,

        to directly utilise the scoops.</h3>

            <h3>Isn't Epic going to end up screwing me over in some way?</h3>
            You should never trust a big corporation, but probably not. Epic's
            EULA stipulates that <span>if the EULA
              changes, you don't have to agree to the new terms</span>;
            as long as you stay on the version of Unreal you're on. Combined
            with
            full access to the source code, this probably means you're pretty
            safe.
            <p>
            
            Anecdotally and as of right now, Epic tend to be chill. For
            instance, when they changed their Unreal Marketplace rev share from
            30%
            to 12%, they made it retroactive and refunded every Marketplace
            creator
            the difference on every sale they'd made. </p><p>
            
            Anything can change, so keep an eye on 'em, but you should be
            alright.</p></td>

            <h3>Unreal and Unity are not game engines in the same sense.</h3>
            Unreal, idTech, Cryengine, Source, Snowdrop, etc are game engines
            that emerged <span>from</span>
            the process of game development. Unity and Godot didn't, which is
            fine,
            but not the same thing, and using them is fundamentally different.<p>
            
            If
            you use the Half-Life Engine, you benefit from using the tools that
            shipped Half-Life; you don't go in and write your own weapon system
            and
            networking&nbsp;and savegame system. </p><p>
            
            It's the same way with
            Unreal, except you're not getting "whatever&nbsp;Epic ended up with
            when
            making Gears of War" - Epic spent 25 years supporting AAA licensees
            and
            building systems that would pretty much work for any and all of
            them,
            so <span>that's</span> what you're
            getting. It's overpowered for what you need as an indie, but that's
            good. You want to be overpowered.</p></td>

            <h3>I heard it's hard to learn!</h3>
            <br>
            It
            can be! It's huge and empowering, but it doesn't do a&nbsp;good job
            of
            teaching itself. The UI is kept "simple" in a way that means there
            are
            huge features you just won't discover unless someone tells you about
            them. <p>
            
            The forums are not great, and the entire internet is
            filled with very confidently-stated misinformation. Googling worked
            well until this year, and now it doesn't.</p><p>
            
            If you can help it, <span>you shouldn't
              try to learn it alone</span>. You should put yourself in some sort
            of Unreal learning community, like <span></span><span></span>Alex Rose's <a href="https://x.com/AlexRoseGames/status/1701618409853567137?s=20">Discord
              For Former Unity Devs</a>,
            and ask a lot of questions. I've seen people go from zero to

            <h3>What's the payment situation? 5% gross doesn't sound great!</h3>
            It's free until you make a million bucks USD, and only after <span>that</span>
            is it 5% gross, and only in quarters where you made more than
            $10,000
            USD. So most folks never end up paying anything. There are no
            subscription fees or anything. To clarify, if you make a million
            bucks,
            and then one dollar, you only owe them five cents.<p>
            
            If this still
            sucks to you, you can talk to them about a custom license with
            custom
            terms. There's an email link on their website somewhere.</p><p>
            
            <span>Make sure you fill out the <a href="https://epicgames.formstack.com/forms/release_form">Release
                Form</a> when you release your game</span>. Otherwise you might
            have to pay royalties sooner than $1M, apparently. Take you five
            minutes.</p><p>
            
            If you're making "linear content", like movies, TV, etc, Unreal is
            literally just free.</p></td>

            <h3>Don't roll-your-own everything.</h3>
            <br>
            Check the system you want to make doesn't exist already. If it does
            exist, but seems bad, <span>you probably
              haven't looked hard enough at it yet</span>.
            They aren't banging rocks together at Epic. You think you can make a
            better animation system or whatever, you're wrong. Quit it, you're
            gonna hurt your team.<p>
            
            That
            said, not everything in Unreal rules. I don't like Unreal's
            Behaviour
            Trees, I think they're really bad. I built my own AI system instead
            of
            that which I think is real good. Maybe you can too! </p></td>

            <h3>I heard C++ sucks!</h3>
            <br>
            Maybe, but Unreal's C++ is pretty different to C++ elsewhere. It's
            easier. Give it a shot even though you dread it.<p>
            
            Most
            games, though, don't need much, if any, C++ - you can build and ship
            an
            entire solid, maintainable, performant, complex game in Blueprint. </p><p>
            
            Check out <strong><a href="https://www.tomlooman.com/unreal-engine-cpp-guide/">Tom
                Looman's Complete Guide to Unreal C++</a></strong>, that guy
            knows what he's doing.</p><p>
            
            <span>The most important thing is not to
              be dogmatic</span>.
            C++ and Blueprint both have their place. If you find yourself
            insisting that someone move all their Blueprint to C++ "for
            performance", you
            have become the villain. Nativisation and optimisation are not the
            same thing.<br>

            <h3>What's the deal with platforms? Consoles? Epic Launcher?&nbsp;</h3>
            You
            can put your games on any platform or console, they're all well
            supported, and nothing is mandatory. If you sell on EGS, which you
            don't have to, those sales
            don't contribute to the revenue thresholds above. Porting to
            consoles
            is easier here than on other engines.&nbsp;</td>
          <td>
            <h3>Porting to consoles isn't an outsource job here.</h3>
            It
            can be, of course, but Unreal is built to target every platform from
            one project. Fortnite is on Switch, Android, iOS, Xbox, Playstation,
            PC, and maybe something else, and that is&nbsp;<span>all
              built out of one project</span>.
            You can do this too. For the most part it "just works". Stuff like
            "make the textures lower res on the Switch, depending on the asset"
            is
            all built-in and easy. <a href="https://cohost.org/joewintergreen/post/2839494-game-dev-post-porti">I
              did the Switch port of Adios in a week.</a>&nbsp;<p>
            
            Bear
            in mind you'll have to go through the console's signing process to
            get
            the secret source code you need to compile the engine for it. It
            tends
            not to be difficult. Whole engine's on Github by the way.</p></td>
          <td>
            <h3>I heard Blueprint sucks!</h3>
            Blueprint actually rules. Look, I get it - why would a visual
            scripting thing be good? They're all shit! I agree.<p>
            
            Blueprint is the only one that's any good. It's amazing. It will
            also <span>help you learn the engine</span>.
            Everything you do there will be applicable to C++. No matter who you
            are, you should start in Blueprint. It's
            100% true that you can build an entire game in Blueprint. Yeah, with
            multiplayer. Yeah, performantly. Yeah, maintainably. It's not just
            for
            rapid prototyping. </p><p>
            
            Be a snob about Blueprint at your peril. I've helped a lot of people
            get good at Unreal and get hired for it, and Blueprint-related
            recalcitrance is the number one way people screw themselves -
            without realising, they sentence themselves to months of wasted time
            and frustration only to mould themselves into the type of Unreal
            user who sabotages any team they're on. Swallow your pride and look
            at some nodes.</p></td>

            you
            do on Unity. Like you don't need Rewired; Unreal's input systems are

            sort of true in the first half of UE3. By UE4 it wasn't true in any

            You
            can make anything in any genre with equal ease. If in doubt, look up

            Unreal

            this

            Yeah,
            totally. Just make a game as usual but with an orthographic camera.
            If
            you want sprites instead of animated meshes, there's a system called
            Paper2D for dealing with sprites, and it doesn't get a lot of
            updates
            or do much with animation, but there's also a system called PaperZD
            (on
            the marketplace) that does a lot more. As of 5.3, all the latest
            lighting features work with orthographic - lumen, virtual
            shadowmaps,
            etc.</td>

            <h3>Unreal&nbsp;introduces new systems carefully.</h3>
            If something new comes into Unreal, usually it's initially marked <span>Experimental</span>.
            This means Epic don't recommend relying on it for production.
            Eventually it will lose that label, and then it's safe to use in a
            shipping game. <p>
            
            Presumably out of an abundance of caution, some
            features stay Experimental for a lot longer, even though they're
            good
            to go and are used in many shipped games. Ask around if you're
            unsure
            how safe an "experimental" feature is.</p><p>
            
            Also, all the new stuff
            is optional, it doesn't replace old features. Lumen and Nanite are
            new

            years ago. Other than Pixel Streaming, you don't have much recourse

            with various quirks (eg, you only get MSAA on Forward). But your
            assets
            don't care about this - the renderers all look the same, and you can

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p>A friend and I were recently lamenting the strange death of OKCupid. Seven years ago when I first tried online dating, the way it worked is that you wrote a long essay about yourself and what you were looking for. You answered hundreds of questions about your personality, your dreams, your desires for your partner, your hard nos. Then you saw who in your area was most compatible, with a “match score” between 0 and 100%. The match scores were eerily good. Pretty much every time I read the profile of someone with a 95% match score or higher, I fell a little bit in love. Every date I went on was fun; the chemistry wasn’t always there but I felt like we could at least be great friends.</p><p>I’m now quite skeptical of quantification of romance and the idea that similarity makes for good relationships. I was somewhat skeptical then, too. What I did not expect, what would have absolutely boggled young naive techno-optimist Ivan, was that 2016-era OKCupid was the best that online dating would ever get. That the tools that people use to find the most important relationship in their lives would get worse, and worse, and worse. OKCupid, like the other acquisitions of Match.com, is just another Tinder clone - see face, swipe left, see face, swipe right. A digital nightclub. And I just don’t expect to meet my wife in a nightclub.</p><p>This isn’t just dating apps. Nearly all popular consumer software has been trending towards minimal user agency, infinitely scrolling feeds, and garbage content. Even that crown jewel of the Internet, Google Search itself, has decayed to the point of being unusable for complicated queries. Reddit and Craigslist remain incredibly useful and valuable precisely because their software remains frozen in time. Like old Victorian mansions in San Francisco they stand, shielded by a quirk of fate from the winds of capital, reminders of a more humane age.</p><p>How is it possible that software gets worse, not better, over time, despite billions of dollars of R&amp;D and rapid progress in tooling and AI? What evil force, more powerful than Innovation and Progress, is at work here?</p><p><span>In my six years at Google, I got to observe this force up close, relentlessly killing features users loved and eroding the last vestiges of creativity and agency from our products. I know this force well, and I hate it, but I do not yet know how to fight it. I call this force the </span><em>Tyranny of the Marginal User</em><span>.</span></p><p>Simply put, companies building apps have strong incentives to gain more users, even users that derive very little value from the app. Sometimes this is because you can monetize low value users by selling them ads. Often, it’s because your business relies on network effects and even low value users can help you build a moat. So the north star metric for designers and engineers is typically something like Daily Active Users, or DAUs for short: the number of users who log into your app in a 24 hour period.</p><p><span>What’s wrong with such a metric? A product that many users want to use is a good product, right? Sort of. Since most software products charge a flat per-user fee (often zero, because ads), and economic incentives operate on the margin, a company with a billion-user product doesn’t actually care about its billion existing users. It cares about the </span><em>marginal user </em><span>- the billion-plus-first user - and it focuses all its energy on making sure that marginal user doesn’t stop using the app. Yes, if you neglect the existing users’ experience for long enough they will leave, but in practice apps are sticky and by the time your loyal users leave everyone on the team will have long been promoted.</span></p><p>So in practice, the design of popular apps caters almost entirely to the marginal user. But who is this marginal user, anyway? Why does he have such bad taste in apps?</p><p>Here’s what I’ve been able to piece together about the marginal user. Let’s call him Marl. The first thing you need to know about Marl is that he has the attention span of a goldfish on acid. Once Marl opens your app, you have about 1.3 seconds to catch his attention with a shiny image or triggering headline, otherwise he’ll swipe back to TikTok and never open your app again.</p><p><span>Marl’s tolerance for user interface complexity is </span><em>zero</em><span>. As far as you can tell he only has one working thumb, and the only thing that thumb can do is flick upwards in a repetitive, zombielike scrolling motion. As a product designer concerned about the wellbeing of your users, you might wonder - </span><em>does Marl really want to be hate-reading Trump articles for 6 hours every night? Is Marl okay?</em><span> You might think to add a setting where Marl can enter his preferences about the content he sees: less politics, more sports, simple stuff like that. But Marl will never click through any of your hamburger menus, never change any setting to a non-default. You might think Marl just doesn’t know about the settings. You might think to make things more convenient for Marl, perhaps add a little “see less like this” button below a piece of content. Oh boy, are you ever wrong. This absolutely </span><em>infuriates</em><span> Marl. On the margin, the handful of pixels occupied by your well-intentioned little button replaced pixels that contained a triggering headline or a cute image of a puppy. Insufficiently stimulated, Marl throws a fit and swipes over to TikTok, never to return to your app. Your feature decreases DAUs in the A/B test. In the launch committee meeting, you mumble something about “user agency” as your VP looks at you with pity and scorn. Your button doesn’t get deployed. You don’t get your promotion. Your wife leaves you. Probably for Marl.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F620ac008-64a0-400f-99f7-55eb6af9fd12_1330x1332.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel="nofollow ugc noopener"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F620ac008-64a0-400f-99f7-55eb6af9fd12_1330x1332.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F620ac008-64a0-400f-99f7-55eb6af9fd12_1330x1332.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F620ac008-64a0-400f-99f7-55eb6af9fd12_1330x1332.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F620ac008-64a0-400f-99f7-55eb6af9fd12_1330x1332.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F620ac008-64a0-400f-99f7-55eb6af9fd12_1330x1332.png" width="1330" height="1332" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/620ac008-64a0-400f-99f7-55eb6af9fd12_1330x1332.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1332,&quot;width&quot;:1330,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:2796504,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F620ac008-64a0-400f-99f7-55eb6af9fd12_1330x1332.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F620ac008-64a0-400f-99f7-55eb6af9fd12_1330x1332.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F620ac008-64a0-400f-99f7-55eb6af9fd12_1330x1332.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F620ac008-64a0-400f-99f7-55eb6af9fd12_1330x1332.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>all hail King Marl!</figcaption></figure></div><p>Of course, “Marl” isn’t always a person.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/14/arm_ipo/">https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/14/arm_ipo/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37509427">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>The long anticipated Arm flotation is set to kick off today with shares being offered to the public at $51 apiece, putting a value on the company of $54.5 billion.</p>
<p>Britain's chip design and licensing outfit said in a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.arm.com/company/news/2023/09/arm-announces-pricing-of-initial-public-offering">statement</a> that its shares are expected to begin trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market in New York on September 14 under the symbol ARM.</p>
<p>There has already been huge interest in this IPO, which resulted in Arm closing orders for shares a day earlier than planned this week due to its stock being more than five times oversubscribed, according to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ft.com/content/3bc383db-a0c2-4e30-81c4-d09a185605c2">Financial Times</a>. This interest could push the share price higher than the initial $51 once trading begins.</p>

    

<p>At this price, the IPO is reportedly set to raise about $4.9 billion for Arm’s parent company, Softbank, which is less than the $8-$10 billion the Japanese investment outfit had previously said it hoped to generate. Softbank itself <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ft.com/content/1dd470c2-be80-4887-83cc-87be93100a12">posted</a> a record $39 billion loss earlier this year.</p>

        


        

<p>Arm will continue to remain under the control of Softbank after the stock sell off, however, as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/05/01/arm_ipo_confirmed/">reported</a> by <em>The Register</em> earlier this year when the chip designer first filed for its public listing. Softbank issued a statement saying that: "SBG (Softbank) intends that Arm will continue to be a consolidated subsidiary of SBG following the completion of the proposed initial public offering."</p>
<p>The valuation of Arm at $54.5 billion is also lower than the $60-$70 billion that Softbank was said to be aiming for, a figure based on the estimated value of the proposed sale of Arm to GPU maker Nvidia at the time <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/02/08/arm_cancels_sale_to_nvidia/">the deal fell through</a> last year. It is still likely to make it the largest IPO in the US this year, however.</p>

        

<p>That proposed sale fell through due to the "significant regulatory challenges" it faced from authorities in various countries, as well as opposition from other tech companies who feared that Nvidia might limit access to Arm technology for other licensees.</p>
<p>The IPO has instead generally met with broad approval, with many big names in the industry such as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/08/09/softbank_q1_2023_arm_ipo/">Apple, Samsung, and Intel</a> stepping up to take a sizable stake in the Brit chip company.</p>

</ul>
<p>This is one reason why the UK government was hopeful that the IPO might be a dual-listing, with Arm shares going up for sale on the London stock exchange as well as New York. Those <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/03/06/fca_rules_arm_listing/">hopes were dashed</a> earlier this year, when the company confirmed it would list only in the US, blamed by some on financial red tape.</p>
<p>According to <a target="_blank" href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Markets/IPO/SoftBank-puts-stamp-on-Arm-IPO-as-Mizuho-wins-top-underwriter-spot">Nikkei Asia</a>, the IPO has four lead underwriters, comprising Barclays, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, and Mizuho USA. There is also a second tier of banks, including Bank of America and Citigroup. ®</p>

Last year, Utah’s legislature passed several conservation measures<em>,</em> including a $40m trust to support lake preservation projects. But Abbott and his colleagues, who authored a sobering report on the lake in January, found that those measures increased flows to the lake by just 100,000 acre feet in 2022.

<p>Posted on <strong>2023-09-14</strong> by PostgreSQL Global Development Group</p>
<p><span><i></i> PostgreSQL Project</span>

</p>

<p>September 14, 2023 - The PostgreSQL Global Development Group today announced the
release of PostgreSQL 16, the latest version of the world's most advanced open
source database.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/release-16.html">PostgreSQL 16</a> raises its
performance, with notable improvements to query parallelism, bulk data loading,
and logical replication. There are many features in this release for developers
and administrators alike, including more SQL/JSON syntax, new monitoring stats
for your workloads, and greater flexibility in defining access control rules for
management of policies across large fleets.</p>
<p>"As relational database patterns evolve, PostgreSQL continues to make
performance gains in searching and managing data at scale," said Dave Page, a
PostgreSQL Core Team member. "PostgreSQL 16 gives users more methods to scale-up
and scale-out their workloads, while giving them new ways to gain insights and
optimize how they manage their data."</p>
<p>PostgreSQL, an innovative data management system known for its reliability and
robustness, benefits from over 25 years of open source development from a global
developer community and has become the preferred open source relational database
for organizations of all sizes.</p>
<h3>Performance Improvements</h3>
<p>PostgreSQL 16 improves the performance of existing PostgreSQL functionality
through new query planner optimizations. In this latest release, the
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/parallel-query.html">query planner can parallelize</a>
<code>FULL</code> and <code>RIGHT</code>
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/queries-table-expressions.html#QUERIES-JOIN">joins</a>,
generate better optimized plans for queries that use
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/functions-aggregate.html">aggregate functions</a>
with a <code>DISTINCT</code> or <code>ORDER BY</code> clause, utilize incremental sorts for
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/queries-select-lists.html#QUERIES-DISTINCT"><code>SELECT DISTINCT</code></a>
queries, and optimize
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/sql-expressions.html#SYNTAX-WINDOW-FUNCTIONS">window functions</a>
so they execute more efficiently. It also improves <code>RIGHT</code> and <code>OUTER</code>
"anti-joins", which enables users to identify rows not present in a joined
table.</p>
<p>This release includes improvements for bulk loading using
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/sql-copy.html"><code>COPY</code></a> in both single
and concurrent operations, with tests showing up to a 300% performance
improvement in some cases. PostgreSQL 16 adds support for
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNECT-LOAD-BALANCE-HOSTS">load balancing</a>
in clients that use <code>libpq</code>, and improvements to vacuum strategy that reduce the
necessity of full-table freezes. Additionally, PostgreSQL 16 introduces CPU
acceleration using <code>SIMD</code> in both x86 and ARM architectures, resulting in
performance gains when processing ASCII and JSON strings, and performing array
and subtransaction searches.</p>
<h3>Logical replication</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/logical-replication.html">Logical replication</a>
lets users stream data to other PostgreSQL instances or subscribers that can
interpret the PostgreSQL logical replication protocol. In PostgreSQL 16, users
can perform logical replication from a standby instance, meaning a standby can
publish logical changes to other servers. This provides developers with new
workload distribution options, for example, using a standby rather than the
busier primary to logically replicate changes to downstream systems.</p>
<p>Additionally, there are several performance improvements in PostgreSQL 16 to
logical replication. Subscribers can now apply large transactions using parallel
workers. For tables that do not have a <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/ddl-constraints.html#DDL-CONSTRAINTS-PRIMARY-KEYS">primary key</a>, subscribers can use B-tree
indexes instead of sequential scans to find rows. Under certain conditions,
users can also speed up initial table synchronization using the binary format.</p>
<p>There are several access control improvements to logical replication in
PostgreSQL 16, including the new
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/predefined-roles.html">predefined role</a>
<code>pg_create_subscription</code>, which grants users the ability to create new logical
subscriptions. Finally, this release begins adding support for bidirectional
logical replication, introducing functionality to replicate data between two
tables from different publishers.</p>
<h3>Developer Experience</h3>
<p>PostgreSQL 16 adds more syntax from the
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/functions-json.html">SQL/JSON</a> standard,
including constructors and predicates such as <code>JSON_ARRAY()</code>, <code>JSON_ARRAYAGG()</code>,
and <code>IS JSON</code>. This release also introduces the ability to use underscores for
thousands separators (e.g. <code>5_432_000</code>) and non-decimal integer literals, such
as <code>0x1538</code>, <code>0o12470</code>, and <code>0b1010100111000</code>.</p>
<p>Developers using PostgreSQL 16 also benefit from new commands in <code>psql</code>. This
includes
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/app-psql.html#APP-PSQL-META-COMMAND-BIND"><code>\bind</code></a>,
which allows users to prepare parameterized queries and use <code>\bind</code> to
substitute the variables (e.g <code>SELECT $1::int + $2::int \bind 1 2 \g</code>). </p>
<p>PostgreSQL 16 improves general support for
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/collation.html">text collations</a>, which
provide rules for how text is sorted. PostgreSQL 16 builds with ICU support by
default, determines the default ICU locale from the environment, and allows
users to define custom ICU collation rules.</p>
<h3>Monitoring</h3>
<p>A key aspect of tuning the performance of database workloads is understanding
the impact of your I/O operations on your system. PostgreSQL 16 introduces
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/monitoring-stats.html#MONITORING-PG-STAT-IO-VIEW"><code>pg_stat_io</code></a>,
a new source of key I/O metrics for granular analysis of I/O access patterns.</p>
<p>Additionally, this release adds a new field to the
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/monitoring-stats.html#MONITORING-PG-STAT-ALL-TABLES-VIEW"><code>pg_stat_all_tables</code></a>
view  that records a timestamp representing when a table or index was last
scanned. PostgreSQL 16 also makes
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/auto-explain.html"><code>auto_explain</code></a> more
readable by logging values passed into parameterized statements, and improves
the accuracy of the query tracking algorithm used by
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/pgstatstatements.html"><code>pg_stat_statements</code></a>
and <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/monitoring-stats.html#MONITORING-PG-STAT-ACTIVITY-VIEW"><code>pg_stat_activity</code></a>.</p>
<h3>Access Control &amp; Security</h3>
<p>PostgreSQL 16 provides finer-grained options for access control and enhances
other security features. The release improves management of
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/auth-pg-hba-conf.html"><code>pg_hba.conf</code></a> and
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/auth-username-maps.html"><code>pg_ident.conf</code></a>
files, including allowing regular expression matching for user and database
names and <code>include</code> directives for external configuration files.</p>
<p>This release adds several security-oriented client connection parameters,
including <code>require_auth</code>, which allows clients to specify which authentication
parameters they are willing to accept from a server, and
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNECT-SSLROOTCERT"><code>sslrootcert="system"</code></a>,
which indicates that PostgreSQL should use the trusted certificate authority
(CA) store provided by the client's operating system. Additionally, the release
adds support for Kerberos credential delegation, allowing extensions such as
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/postgres-fdw.html"><code>postgres_fdw</code></a> and
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/dblink.html"><code>dblink</code></a> to use authenticated
credentials to connect to trusted services.</p>

						<p>Firstly, I'd like to express how appalled my team and I are by Adobes lack of service around this issue. We are now seeking help on this forum as we simply cannot get through to Adobe via phone/email. We've been handed around to 13+ different representatives on the phone, we've been transferred to numerous people and then hung up on, we’ve been put on hold and then hung up on, and we've been provided a support email to contact (support@adobe.com) which does not work. This has been going on for about 3 weeks now. To say the least, we a absolutely disgusted by the support, so I really hope this reaches someone at Adobe or a community member who could kindly help us instead.&nbsp;</p><p>We have used the font <a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/proxima-nova#licensing-section" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Proxima Nova</a> on a website for our client using the <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/nz/fonts/using/add-fonts-website.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adobe Web Project</a> method. Our client is now being harassed and threatened by a company called The Type Founders who claim to work on behalf of the owner of the font (who we believe are legitimate). They are claiming that we have illegally downloaded the font Proxima Nova, and are incorrectly using it by ‘self hosting’. We have access to this font through Adobe Fonts, and are using it on this website through Adobe Web Project (as mentioned). This company are claiming that we need to purchase the font in order to continue using it. Just to note, since this issue arose we have removed the font temporarily until the matter is resolved.</p><p>The one useful Adobe representative we spoke to on the phone last week mentioned that numerous people are having trouble with the Adobe licencing with this particular font. She said that Adobe may not have the appropriate licencing for this font listed on the website – unsure if this is reliable information or not, but thought I’d mention, as if this is the case, there should be more information clearly visible on the font’s webpage about how to use it correctly.</p><p>From our understanding, we have used the font in the correct way (according to the Adobe Web Project method). However, our client does not have an Adobe subscription, so we concerned that we are not covered by the Adobe licence due to this:&nbsp;<a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/fonts/using/font-licensing.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://helpx.adobe.com/fonts/using/font-licensing.html</a>.</p><p>What we’d like to know is, have we used the font incorrectly and what can we do? Is this company ‘The Type Founders’ even legitimate like we believe them to be or should we just ingore their email? Our client is intimidated and stressed, and we’d like to have a clear answer for them.</p><p>We’d also like to know how other studios around the globe use Adobe fonts on client websites. Do your clients create Adobe accounts every time you use an Adobe font on their website?</p><p>We’d really appreciate some help on this. Thank you.</p>

<p>Ethan Marcotte’s new book, “<a href="https://abookapart.com/products/you-deserve-a-tech-union">You Deserve a Tech Union</a>,” is a compelling and galvanizing read — not just for tech workers, but for anyone who is union-curious (or even union-skeptical).&nbsp;</p>

<p>The book provides a mix of practical guidelines and steps that one can take to form a union, along with inspiring stories from present-day unionization efforts that capture the imagination about what’s possible. There’s also a historical perspective through stories from the past that demonstrate some of the wins that unions have already brought us.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of those stories is the <a href="https://www.zinnedproject.org/materials/bread-and-roses-strike-story/">1912 Lawrence Textile Strike</a><strong>,</strong> also known as the Bread and Roses Strike:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“One group of women was said to have carried a sign bearing words from the suffrage activist Helen Todd: “We want bread, and roses too.” Their slogan was a call not just for basic subsistence, but for a life of dignity.”</p>
<cite>Ethan Marcotte</cite></blockquote>
<p>Ethan Marcotte is a veteran web designer, writer, consultant, and all-around thoughtful human being, known for coining the term “<a href="https://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design/">responsive web design</a>” in 2010. His unique perspective on the state of tech organizing today is the result of work in the tech industry for over two decades, where he has lacked the protections he now advocates. “I’ve been self-employed for most of my career, so I’ve never been in a union,” he says. ”But organized labor is something I’ve always cared deeply about.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>The book describes an evolution in consciousness that mirrors that of many other tech-worker organizers. After the 2016 presidential election, the tech industry saw a surge of activism when workers began to recognize the work they had produced could potentially be abused to harm people. “Those harms had always been there, of course,” he says. “But I think 2016 brought those harms into sharp relief for a lot of people, and a lot of worker-led organizing and activism followed over the next couple of years.”</p>
<p>Ethan vividly recalls the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/01/technology/google-walkout-sexual-harassment.html">2018 Google walkouts</a> as a moment when he started seriously thinking about documenting this tectonic shift in the industry. “I’ve never seen anything like that before: 20,000 tech workers taking to the streets to demand systemic change at work,” he says. “It was inspiring.”</p>
<p>The book includes material drawn from interviewing workers from across the tech industry at every level of union formation, discussing why they unionized, how they structured their campaigns, and what challenges they faced. Several workers mentioned they felt overwhelmed at first and that they weren’t sure how to get started.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“That’s something I want this book to help with: to make the process more clear to others, while shining a light on the people who have unionized their workplaces,” he says. “My hope is that these two things will help readers see ‘forming a union’ as something that’s possible for them, while giving them some resources and materials to get them started on their way… I wanted to write this book because the worker organizing we’re seeing right now has been the single most hopeful thing I’ve seen come out of the tech industry. Tech workers are actually seeing their status as workers. What’s more, they’re recognizing there’s power in that status, and moving together to make change: not just in their workplaces, but also in the industry at large.”</p>
<p>The book is not a detailed organizing manual, and it’s not a how-to guide. “You Deserve a Tech Union” does<strong><em> </em></strong>have practical lessons and resources in it, and the longest chapter is<strong><em> </em></strong>about how to form a union in the United States. But generally, Ethan says, “I was trying to focus more on the why.” There’s a real momentum building, and we’re so excited this book has come out now, as more tech workers are becoming comfortable recognizing that unionizing is a path that’s available to them.</p>
<p>The following is our edited interview with Ethan.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>EWOC</strong>: I’m really curious about your interest in labor organizing as someone who’s self-employed and doesn’t have co-workers or a boss in the traditional sense. Did it stem from your general interest and research into the tech industry?</p>
<p><strong>Ethan</strong>: Oh, well, I’ve been employed full-time before, here and there: I worked in Higher Ed for a time, had a fair bit of agency experience, and so on. But unions were a big part of my life, growing up: I didn’t have a union family, but I was taught by union members, and I received medical care from union members. Maybe most importantly, I had a teacher and mentor who was a big influence on me, and he was firmly pro-union. I saw my first ever <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Workers_of_the_World">Wobbly</a> poster on the halls of his house, before I even really knew what it was. So I guess union stories and histories were something that I was raised on, even if I didn’t understand the politics all that much.</p>
<p>But getting back to your first question, asking why I wrote this book? It’s really been led by the simple fact that there is this wave of organizing in tech. I mean, unions were something I always cared about — but it’s not about me. It’s about workers at companies like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23732782/kickstarter-union-organizing-good-enough-job-excerpt">Kickstarter</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22307671/glitch-workers-sign-historic-collective-bargaining-agreement-cwa">Glitch</a> and <a href="https://technical.ly/company-culture/nava-pbc-tech-union/">Nava</a> and more, who decided that a union needed to exist at their workplaces.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In other words, these workers felt this is a direction that the industry needed to move in. At the end of the day, this book is documenting something that is already happening in the tech industry — and from where I’m sitting, it’s a movement that only seems to be gaining steam. That’s why I decided to write the book.</p>
<p><strong>EWOC</strong>: There’s a narrative in places like Google, where an abundance of personal amenities are provided for employees like laundry services, meals, coffee, bean bag chairs etc., a narrative of “We want to provide for you, and we’re a family, and whatever grievances you have can be solved internally between you and your manager.” This narrative also pervades the nonprofit and higher education sectors and serves to make certain people wary of unions, especially if they’re relatively happy in their workplace or have strong relationships with their supervisors and co-workers.</p>
<p><strong>Ethan</strong>: My book is primarily geared towards folks who are at least curious about the idea of unions. But for tech workers who might be skeptical of why they’d need to unionize, I do hope there’s some material in there that’s useful to them. Because for me, it really comes back down to these two questions that I ask early on in the book: “What do you like about your job? What would you change about it if you could?”</p>
<p>Once you’ve answered those questions, there are some more that follow on from that: “How would you keep the things you like from changing? And if there are things you wish were different, how would you change them?” It can be helpful to put aside some of the benefits you mention — the free laundry services, the easy access to free food, and so on — and take an inventory of what’s actually guaranteed to you at work. And maybe to start thinking about what should be guaranteed to you.</p>
<p>For some workers, those questions can be a useful first step toward organizing and to building power collectively.</p>
<p><strong>EWOC</strong>: I found it interesting how you connected technology all the way back to industrialization and other forms of advancements that have been introduced to the workplace and threatened labor in all industries, not just tech workers. In your book, you reference the work of Ursula Franklin, a research physicist who often spoke about the potential negative effects of technology. Here’s a quote of hers from your book.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“[Once] a technology achieves institutionalized status, it reshapes people’s labor — and people’s lives — on a dramatic, industrial scale. A technology may promise liberation at first — but inevitably, people are captured by it. Exploited.”</p>
<cite>Ursula Franklin</cite></blockquote>
<p><strong>Ethan</strong>: Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>I mean, across all the interviews I had for the book, very few people I spoke with grew up with a direct connection to organized labor. Most of the tech workers I spoke with felt they’d always been supportive of unions but didn’t connect them to the tech industry, that tech workers didn’t “need” unions. After all, we’re generally paid well, we often receive good benefits, and we weren’t working in physically dangerous working conditions.</p>
<p>Generally, I think there’s a preconception that tech, as an industry, is somehow different from all the other industries that have ever come before it. Stepping into that history of recognizing that we are workers, and as such, we can be exploited as workers was important for me, and I hope it’s useful for others, too.</p>
<p><strong>EWOC</strong>: We’re seeing this profoundly across many industries: the UAW fighting for a just transition to EV technology or the threat of AI for WGA and SAG-AFTRA members. You recently published an <a href="https://www.wbur.org/cognoscenti/2023/08/15/hollywood-writers-actors-strike-generative-artificial-intelligence-ethan-marcotte">op-ed about AI</a> and its effects on labor, and you discuss this in your book as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beyond the threat of technology on white-collar and blue-collar workers alike, there’s a tendency to exclude creative types — writers, actors, intellectuals, etc. — from the working class, and to see them as having an elite status of employment. There’s a tendency to view tech workers and their struggles in the same way.</p>
<p><strong>Ethan</strong>: It’s easy for folks to look at the SAG-AFTRA and WGA strikes, and think, “Oh, why are they picketing? It’s Hollywood: they’re all pulling down JJ Abrams’ or Brad Pitt’s salaries.”<em> </em>But that’s not true, not by a long shot. <a href="https://www.democracynow.org/2023/7/14/sag_aftra_strike_begins">87% of SAG-AFTRA members make less than $26,000 a year</a>.</p>
<p>I think the same bias applies to the tech industry, too: when some people hear “tech worker,” they might think of software engineers making hundreds of thousands of dollars a year at a massive corporation. But not every tech worker is an engineer, and not everybody works at Google. Folks who work in trust and safety, or in content moderation, somebody who works at a small digital agency, whose clients are exclusively small businesses, they’re all tech workers.</p>
<p>There are definitely layers of privilege in tech work — absolutely. But at the end of the day, all tech workers deserve a union.</p>
<p><strong>EWOC</strong>: I’d like to expand on this idea about deserving the protections of a union. Your book is called, “You Deserve a Tech Union.” Organizers often find themselves having to sell these basic tenets to workers that we deserve a decent salary, we deserve a workplace that respects us, we deserve healthcare, we deserve to retire at a reasonable amount of time before we die, as if we have to give ourselves permission to join a union and be in this fight. There’s a passage in the book where you discuss the ideals of a meritocracy and individualism within the tech industry and how that can be antithetical to the ideals of a collective.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I realize that for some tech workers, this idea of solidarity can feel like a difficult concept to accept. And I get it, truly. For me, I wonder if some of that difficulty lies in the fact that the idea runs counter to the stories the tech industry tells itself about “meritocracy”: about the brilliant self-starters who struck out alone, and who achieved dizzying successes simply and solely <em>because</em> they were so brilliant and talented and motivated, all without help from anyone else. We’ve bought into this idea of the talented individualist so thoroughly that our stories tend to brush away all the privileges they enjoyed, or the assistance they received: the family that supported them, the wealth they inherited, the educational institutions they had access to. Somehow, our fables focus solely on the child, rather than on the village that raised them.”</p>
<cite>Ethan Marcotte</cite></blockquote>
<p>Additionally, corporations have further alienated their employees by hiring a majority workforce of part-time or contract employees, which reinforces this impression that they can abdicate their responsibilities of providing adequate benefits, a safe workplace, and job security. Do you think that this alienation makes it challenging for contract employees at these large tech companies to participate in a union?</p>
<p><strong>Ethan</strong>: One of the cornerstones, and frankly original sins of the tech industry, is its reliance on contract work. This applies to contracted knowledge workers, of course. But the so-called “gig economy” is deeply, deeply intertwined with the successes of the tech industry today. Because we can’t really talk about the people who drive for Lyft or Uber as being somehow distinct from the corporate profits of Lyft or Uber. That’s why I wanted to end the book on dramatically expanding the definition of “tech worker”: these contract workers are tech workers, just as much as the engineers and designers who build those platforms.</p>
<p>However, there are very few legal protections available to these contract workers; that is one of those many areas where American labor laws are stacked against us. That’s why I’ve been so inspired by the push — and I know EWOC has been a big part of this too — to use <a href="https://workerorganizing.org/premajority-unionism/">pre-majority unions</a> as a platform for helping connect contract workers with the means to unionize themselves. At <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2023/02/google-layoffs-union-alphabet-youtube-protest.html">Alphabet</a> and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/11/tech/apple-store-union-negotiations-begin/index.html">Apple</a>, their pre-majority unions work to provide an avenue to unionization for more marginalized tech workers at those companies. That’s been great to see.</p>
<p><strong>EWOC</strong>: We also know that creating a two-tiered employee system is another way for employers to breed resentment and divide us. Another powerful excerpt from the book explains</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“A union’s power isn’t derived from its individual members, from its size, or even from its goals—or rather, its power isn’t <em>only</em> derived from those things. By establishing a union, you and your fellow workers acknowledge that the well-being of every union member is bound up in the well-being of every single other union member. And that acknowledgment is the heart of a union in a very real, practical sense. A union is powerful precisely because of that interconnectedness between workers—that solidarity.”</p>
<cite>Ethan Marcotte</cite></blockquote>
<p>I wholeheartedly agree with this understanding of solidarity. We’ve seen where large majority unions, who are not fighting for the most vulnerable members in the group with that same “we’re all in this together”<strong><em> </em></strong>attitude, can start seeing weaknesses in the campaign.</p>
<p><strong>Ethan</strong>: Absolutely. Solidarity isn’t just a buzzword: there’s a real power to be held there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That’s why it’s important to note that some of these contracting firms and services have been organizing for quite some time, longer than “traditional” tech workers have been. Whether it’s shuttle bus drivers at Google or contract cafeteria workers, there are tech workers who’ve been fighting for contracts for years. There’s a history there that we can draw from, and learn from — if we’re willing to listen to the workers who’ve led the way.</p>
<p><strong>EWOC</strong>: A common practice for white-collar workers to make any improvements in their working conditions is to find another job and use it as leverage for their current job; but more often than not, most workers, if they have the means, just find another job and quit. At EWOC, one of our mottos is “<a href="https://workerorganizing.org/workers-quitting-jobs-great-resignation-2021/">Don’t quit, organize!</a>” It’s a concept that’s been repeated by notable labor organizers, but it’s a concept that’s anathema to today’s working professionals. You also reinforce that idea in your book.</p>
<p>“A union gives you options beyond simply leaving your job, or hoping it gets better; instead, it puts a mechanism in your hands that allows you and your fellow workers to help <em>shape</em> your job into something better. It’s a mechanism through which you and your coworkers can collectively—and quite literally—build power<em>.</em>”<em> </em>Ethan Marcotte</p>
<p><strong>Ethan</strong>: While I was researching the book, the conversations I had with tech workers really underlined for me just how much unacknowledged precarity there is in tech work — that there aren’t a lot of guarantees. That’s especially true after the past year, where literally <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/07/tech-industry-layoffs-2023/">hundreds of thousands of people have lost their jobs</a>. That this isn’t an industry where your work is guaranteed to be there next month, much less next year. And frankly, I think folks are tired of that.</p>
<p>They want some guarantees.</p>
<p>They want some stability.</p>
<p>They want work that is going to treat them with dignity and respect.</p>
<p>And for some people, that absolutely does mean better pay because many people are dramatically underpaid in this industry. But it doesn’t stop there. I’m reminded of Kickstarters’ new contract, which has just-cause protections. And that’s a huge milestone for workers in the tech industry. What’s more, it makes me excited to see what kind of contracts come down the road in the future.</p>

          <p>
            Geolocation is the process of mapping IP addresses to a geographical location defined by latitude and
            longitude. There are many use-cases for geolocation intelligence that are demanded by online businesses and
            service
            providers:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Targeted Advertising</strong> - Allows advertisers to serve ads that are geographically relevant
              to users. By knowing the approximate location of an IP address, advertisers can deliver targeted
              advertisements based on the user's location, such as promoting local events, services, or products.</li>
            <li><strong>Fraud Detection and Prevention</strong> - By knowing the geolocation of an IP address, unusual
              login attempts or unusual financial transactions can be detected and blocked. For example, if a banking
              account is normally used by a IP address from country A and there is suddenly a login attempt from country
              B, the login attempt can be denied or the user can be asked for additional verification.</li>
            <li><strong>Content Localization</strong> - Websites and apps often want to deliver localized content to
              users. Based on the user's location, websites can provide region-specific information, language
              preferences, or display prices in the local currency.</li>
            <li><strong>Digital Rights Management and Compliance</strong> - Content providers use IP geolocation
              intelligence to
              enforce digital
              rights management (DRM) policies and regulations or restrictions. Those providers may restrict access to
              content based on the user's
              geographic
              location, ensuring compliance with licensing agreements and copyright restrictions.</li>
            <li><strong>Network Security</strong> - IP geolocation plays a role in network security by providing
              insights into the origin of potential threats. Security systems can use IP geolocation data to identify
              and block suspicious IP addresses or implement access controls based on geographic regions.</li>
            <li><strong>Analytics and Insights</strong> - IP geolocation data can be valuable
              for analyzing user
              behavior and trends. Businesses can gain insights into where their customers are located, which can inform
              marketing strategies, expansion plans, and product development.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 id="geolocation-not-fully-accurate">IP Geolocation Accuracy</h3>

          <p><em>Why is IP geolocation sometimes not accurate in general?</em></p>

          <p> In some cases, allocated IPv4 and
            IPv6 networks are distributed geographically and thus one network can have multiple geographical
            locations. Furthermore, many networks are distributed geographically by design. Examples of such
            geographically disparate networks are mobile networks or
            satellite networks.</p>
          <p>For example, how exactly would you geolocate the IP ranges belonging to the satellite Internet from
            <a href="https://www.starlink.com/">Starklink from SpaceX</a>? Find out by yourself by inspecting
            Starlink's <a href="https://api.ipapi.is/?q=AS14593">AS14593</a>.
          </p>

          <p>In other cases, IP networks are reassigned or reallocated by Regional Internet Registries or IP leasing
            companies
            (such as <a href="https://www.ipxo.com/lease-ips/">IPXO</a> or <a href="https://ipbroker.com/en/services/ip-leasing/">ipbroker.com</a>) and the
            geolocation
            completely
            changes as soon as a IP address is assigned a new owner.</p>

          <p>It turns out that the process of geolocating IP addresses is a complicated endeavour. However, the accuracy
            that
            can be obtained is too good to
            be ignored in any IP address API.</p>

          <h2 id="how-to-build-a-geolocation-database">How to build a IP Geolocation Database from
            Scratch?</h2>

          <p><span>
              <i></i>
            </span>
            The reminder of this page makes a deep dive into the technicalities of creating a geolocation database from
            scratch. If
            you are only
            interested in downloading the geolocation database, you can do so <a href="https://ipapi.is/geolocation.html">here</a>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Each IP address in the Internet is owned or administered by an organization. Regional Internet Registries
            (RIR's) such as <a href="https://www.arin.net/">ARIN</a> or <a href="https://www.apnic.net/">APNIC</a> store
            ownership information in their WHOIS databases.
          </p>

          <p>
            However, WHOIS records don't
            necessarily include geolocation information for allocated networks. Furthermore, organizations that
            own networks can use those networks in any geographical location they end up choosing. Even worse, those
            organizations can assign networks to any third-party organization or lease IP blocks to other
            entities. Therefore, it is inherently tricky to geolocate IP addresses and thus geolocation is often not
            accurate.
          </p>

          <p>Having said that, the task to find and collect geolocation information can be divided into three
            different
            sub-tasks:</p>

          <ol>
            <li><strong>Extract Geolocation Data from WHOIS Records Directly</strong> - WHOIS records often include
              direct
              geolocation information about IP addresses. WHOIS attributes such as <code>geoloc</code> and
              <code>geofeed</code> can be used to derive self-published geolocation knowledge about IP addresses.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Interpolate Geolocation Knowledge from WHOIS Records</strong> - Often it is
              possible to derive and interpolate geolocation information from WHOIS attributes indirectly. For example,
              organizations
              that are administratively responsible for a network have to provide their postal address in
              WHOIS
              records.
              Sometimes, this postal address is also the geographical location of the organization's networks.</li>
            <li><strong>Consider Open Source Geolocation Projects</strong> - Many entities invested considerable
              resources into the geolocation problem and they provide their geolocation information for free. <a href="https://ipmap.ripe.net/">RIPE IPmap</a>, <a href="https://github.com/massimocandela/geofeed-finder">geofeed-finder</a> and <a href="https://opengeofeed.org/">OpenGeoFeed</a> are good examples of such valuable
              open source projects.</li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            After compiling a raw geolocation database from the above sources, it may have incomplete or inconsistent
            records.
          </p>
          <p>
            The collected geolocation data may be incomplete since records with country and city information don't
            always
            include coordinates. Vice versa, sometimes raw records with coordinates don't have country and city
            information.
            If raw
            records only contain a
            country,
            the
            accuracy cannot be higher than on country level.
          </p>

          <p>
            Therefore, geolocation
            data needs to be enriched and transformed into a
            common format. This process is extremely important and is achieved by using open source geographical
            databases
            such as the ones from <a href="https://www.geonames.org/">geonames.org</a> or <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">openstreetmap.org</a>.
          </p>

          <p>Put differently, the data enrichment task is to either:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>Find the latitude and longitude from a given city and country pair. Example: What are the
              coordinates for <code>US, San Francisco</code>?
            </li>
            <li>And on the other hand, if only the latitude and longitude is given, the task is to obtain the closest
              city for those coordinates. Example: What is the city and country
              for the coordinates <code>52.524526 13.410037</code>?</li>
          </ol>

          <p>The next sections describe all the major steps that need to be followed in order to build a geolocation
            database
            from scratch.</p>

          <h2 id="geolocation-data-from-whois">Extract Geolocation Data from WHOIS Records
            Directly</h2>

          <p><span>
              <i></i>
            </span>
            This section describes how the different WHOIS databases from the five major Regional Internet
            Registries
            (RIR's)
            provide direct geolocation support for IP networks in their WHOIS records.
          </p>

          <p>By analyzing and parsing WHOIS data from all five Regional Internet Registries, many IP
            addresses can be mapped to a geographical location. Since each RIR has their own WHOIS database format,
            each RIR
            needs to be treated distinctively. In the next sections, it will be discussed how geolocation
            information is provided in each of the five different WHOIS databases.</p>

          <h3 id="geolocation-ripe-ncc">Geolocation in RIPE NCC</h3>

          <p>The RIPE NCC database has two different attributes that provide geolocation information for
            <code>inetnum</code> and <code>inet6num</code> objects. The <code>inetnum</code> and <code>inet6num</code>
            objects assign an IP network to an organization. It is suggested to read the RIPE
            documentation about <a href="https://apps.db.ripe.net/docs/04.RPSL-Object-Types/02-Descriptions-of-Primary-Objects.html#description-of-the-inet6num-object"><strong>inetnum
                and inet6num
                objects</strong></a>.
          </p>

          <p>
            As mentioned, there are two different attributes in <code>inetnum</code> and <code>inet6num</code>
            objects that allow to provide geolocation information to IP networks:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>The <code>geoloc</code> attribute</li>
            <li>The <code>geofeed</code> attribute</li>
          </ol>

          <h4>The <code>geoloc</code> attribute</h4>

          <p>The first attribute is the <a href="https://www.ripe.net/manage-ips-and-asns/db/tools/geolocation-in-the-ripe-database"><strong>geoloc
                attribute</strong></a>. The <code>geoloc</code> attribute simply contains latitude and longitude
            coordinates
            in string format (Example: <code>"47.855374 12.132041"</code>).
          </p>

          <p>
            The <code>geoloc</code> attribute is defined in the <a href="https://apps.db.ripe.net/docs/04.RPSL-Object-Types/02-Descriptions-of-Primary-Objects.html#description-of-the-inetnum-object">RIPE
              Database
              Docs</a> as follows:
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            <strong>“geoloc:”</strong> - The geolocation coordinates for the resource in decimal degrees notation.
            Format is latitude
            followed by longitude, separated by a space. Latitude ranges from [-90,+90] and longitude from [-180,+180].
            All more specific objects to the inetnum object containing this attribute inherit this data.
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            For example, the <code>inetnum</code> object for the IP address <code>217.72.221.0</code> includes the
            <code>geoloc</code> attribute. The WHOIS
            record below can be obtained via any <code>whois</code> client with the terminal command
            <code>whois 217.72.221.0</code>:
          </p>

          <pre><code>inetnum:        217.72.221.0 - 217.72.221.255

geoloc:         47.855374 12.132041
language:       DE</code></pre>

          <p>
            So what does the above WHOIS record reveal? The responsible organization of the network
            <code>217.72.221.0 - 217.72.221.255</code> is komro GmbH and the <code>geoloc</code> attribute claims that
            the network
            is located at the
            coordinates
            <code>47.855374 12.132041</code>. Those coordinates point to <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/47%C2%B051'19.4%22N+12%C2%B007'55.4%22E/@47.8835257,11.9134016,10.69z/data=!4m4!3m3!8m2!3d47.855374!4d12.132041?entry=ttu">Rosenheim,
              a city close to Munich in Germany</a>.
          </p>

          <p>
            What is the total coverage of the <code>geoloc</code> attribute for all <code>inetnum</code> and
            <code>inet6num</code> objects in the RIPE NCC database?
          </p>

          <p>
            At the time of writing in July 2023, there were 4,190,644
            <code>inetnum</code> and 819,381 <code>inet6num</code> objects in the RIPE NCC database. But only 114,389
            <code>inetnum</code> or <code>inet6num</code> objects contained the <code>geoloc</code> attribute.
          </p>

          <p>
            Therefore, the
            overall coverage of the <code>geoloc</code> attribute is <strong>only 2.3%</strong>.
            However, more and more organizations start using the <code>geoloc</code> attribute, therefore it is useful
            to start collecting it.
          </p>

          <h4>The <code>geofeed</code> attribute</h4>

          <p>
            Another method to provide geolocation information in the RIPE NCC database is the <a href="https://ripe82.ripe.net/presentations/84-RIPE82_geofeed.pdf"><strong>geofeed attribute</strong></a>.
          </p>

          <p>
            The <code>geofeed</code> attribute is defined in the <a href="https://apps.db.ripe.net/docs/04.RPSL-Object-Types/02-Descriptions-of-Primary-Objects.html#description-of-the-inetnum-object">RIPE
              Database
              Docs</a> as follows:
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            <strong>"geofeed:"</strong> - Contains a URL referencing a CSV file containing geolocation data for the
            resource. The geofeed
            format is defined in <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc8805/">RFC
              8805</a>.
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            The value of the geofeed attribute is a HTTPS url that points to a file that contains
            geolocation
            information. The format of such geofeed files is specified in <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc8805/">RFC
              8805</a>. Currently, there are two different ways to provide such a geofeed url in WHOIS records:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>One way is to use a
              dedicated attribute <code>geofeed</code> with the geofeed url as value</li>
            <li>The other method is to use the <code>remarks</code> attribute to
              specify the geofeed property.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            An example of using the <code>remarks</code> attribute to specify a geofeed url
            would be:
          </p>

          <pre><code>inetnum:        178.237.189.0 - 178.237.191.255
netname:        OOOSET-NET
descr:          OOO SET
remarks:        INFRA-AW
remarks:        Geofeed https://github.com/is1581/geofeedset/blob/main/ip4set.csv
country:        RU</code></pre>

          <p>
            Using the <code>remarks</code> attribute requires to specify the geofeed url in the format
            <code>Geofeed {URL}</code> in order to indicate that the url points to a <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc8805/">RFC
              8805</a> geofeed file.
          </p>

          <p>
            The next example illustrates how the <code>geofeed</code> attribute is used in the RIPE NCC database.
            The terminal command
            <code>whois 193.56.36.0</code> returns a WHOIS record that follows the <code>geofeed:</code> attribute
            format:
          </p>

          <pre><code>inetnum:        193.56.36.0 - 193.56.36.255

          <p>
            As the WHOIS record above reveals, the geofeed url for the network <code>193.56.36.0 - 193.56.36.255</code>
            is <a href="https://ip-gfd.airbus.com/geofeed.csv">https://ip-gfd.airbus.com/geofeed.csv</a>.
            How does such a <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc8805/">RFC

          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>The first column is the IP Prefix. Often, Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation is used for the
              IP Prefix column, but it is not necessarily a requirement. Example:
              <code>Singapore</code>
            </li>
            <li>The second column is the country as Alpha2code. Example:
              <code>SG</code>
            </li>
            <li>The third column is the ISO region code
              conforming to ISO 3166-2. Example:
              <code>SG-01</code>
            </li>
            <li>The fourth column is a city in free format. Example:

            What is the total coverage of the <code>geofeed</code> attribute for all <code>inetnum</code> and
            <code>inet6num</code> objects in the RIPE NCC database?
          </p>

          <p>
            At the time of writing in July 2023, there were 6643 occurrences of geofeed urls in <code>remarks</code>
            attributes and 2035 WHOIS records
            had the
            <code>geofeed</code> attribute.
            Therefore, the
            overall coverage of geofeed urls is <strong>only 0.17%</strong>. However, geofeed files usually include more
            than one network, therefore, there are more networks with geolocation information than there are geofeed
            urls. Hence, the coverage number of <strong>0.17%</strong> is misleading here.
          </p>

          <h3 id="geolocation-arin">Geolocation in ARIN</h3>

          <p>
            A not so recent article from 2018 discusses <a href="https://www.arin.net/blog/2018/06/11/ip-geolocation-the-good-the-bad-the-frustrating/">Geolocation
              in ARIN</a>. The conclusion of this article is that geolocation is inherently difficult. It seems that
            ARIN does not provide much assistance to external entities that are looking to geolocate IP addresses.
          </p>

          <p>
            Geolocation in the ARIN database for <code>NetRange</code> objects is provided via geofeed urls in
            <code>Comment</code> attributes. There <a href="https://www.arin.net/participate/community/acsp/suggestions/2022/2022-15/">was a request</a> to add
            a dedicated geofeed property, but it was denied
            since adding geofeeds over <code>Comment</code> or <code>Remark</code> attributes is
            deemed sufficient.
            For example, when looking up the IP address
            <code>whois 96.43.200.0</code>, the following WHOIS record is obtained from ARIN:
          </p>

          <pre><code>NetRange:       96.43.192.0 - 96.43.223.255

          <p>
            Geofeed urls follow <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc8805/">RFC 8805</a> and the format of those
            <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc8805/">RFC 8805</a> files was already discussed in the section
            about RIPE NCC.
          </p>

          <p>
            The ARIN database currently doesn't make use of the <code>geoloc</code> attribute as it is the case in the
            RIPE NCC database.
          </p>

          <h3 id="geolocation-lacnic">Geolocation in LACNIC</h3>

          <p>
            LACNIC is much more supportive when it comes to geolocation compared to ARIN. LACNIC hosts a
            <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc8805/">Geofeed Service</a> that provides members the
            possibility to provide geolocation information for IP addresses they own. A good part of LACNIC members
            provided geolocation information which is publicly available at <a href="https://milacnic.lacnic.net/lacnic/geofeeds">milacnic.lacnic.net/lacnic/geofeeds</a>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Furthermore, the LACNIC WHOIS database already provides geolocation information (accurate to city level) by
            default. The LACNIC database can be downloaded from their FTP server: <a href="https://ftp.lacnic.net/lacnic/dbase/">ftp.lacnic.net/lacnic/dbase/</a>
          </p>

          <p>
            As can be seen in the LACNIC database excerpt below, LANIC provides city and country information for all
            <code>inetnum</code> and <code>inet6num</code> objects:
          </p>

          <pre><code>inetnum: 190.5.128/19

          <h3 id="geolocation-afrinic">Geolocation in AFRINIC</h3>

          <p>
            According to the <a href="https://afrinic.net/support/whois">AFRINIC support page</a>, AFRNIC does not
            provide geolocation services and
            does not have any formal or
            operational relationship with any geolocation provider.
          </p>

          <p>Nevertheless, AFRINIC also supports the usage of geofeed urls in
            <code>remarks</code> attributes similar as in the RIPE NCC database.
            For example, when looking up the IP address with the command
            <code>whois 102.222.84.0</code>, the following WHOIS record is obtained:
          </p>

          <pre><code>inetnum:        102.222.84.0 - 102.222.84.255

          <p>
            In conclusion, AFRINIC provides geolocation information with the same attributes as with RIPE.
          </p>

          <h3 id="geolocation-apnic">Geolocation in APNIC</h3>

          <p>
            APNIC provides roughly the same support for geolocation as RIPE NCC. According to a <a href="https://afrinic.net/support/whois">APNIC article about geolocation</a>, they support the
            <code>geoloc</code> attribute and the geofeed urls via the <code>remarks</code> attribute.
          </p>

          <p>
            Furthermore, APNIC seems to be quite open to improve the geolocation support as one of their publications
            suggests: <a href="https://meetings.apnic.net/30/pdf/Lepinski-APNIC-30-Geolocation-Registry.pdf">"Do we
              need a registry for IP
              geolocation information?"</a>.
          </p>

          <p>For example, when looking up the IP address with the command
            <code>whois 203.152.49.0</code>, the following WHOIS record is obtained from APNIC:

          <h2 id="interpolating-geolocation-data-from-whois">Interpolate Geolocation Knowledge from

              <i></i>
            </span>
            This section describes how WHOIS attributes that were never directly intended for geolocation purposes can
            be
            used to derive geolocation intelligence. This process is inherently error prone, but the obtained results
            are too accurate to be ignored.
          </p>

          <p>
            WHOIS data from the five Regional Internet Registries is the most accurate data source for IP addresses. The
            main purpose of WHOIS is to provide registrant information for organizations that own Internet
            numbers such as IP addresses or AS numbers. As such, WHOIS databases also often include the postal
            addresses
            and
            countries of the organization's headquarter or administrative location.
          </p>

          <p>
            Often, the postal address of an organization is also the geographical location where their IP addresses are
            used. This is of course not always the case. The administrative postal address of large
            organizations often doesn't correspond with the location of all the organization's IP addresses.
          </p>

          <p>
            In the next sections, for each of the five RIR's, an IP address example where the WHOIS data can be used
            to derive
            geolocation information will be discussed (positive example).
          </p>

          <p>
            Additionally, a counterexample where WHOIS
            meta data is
            misleading
            will be provided (negative example). If applicable, a conclusion will be drawn from the examples.

          <p>According to many different IP geolocation services, the IP address <code>185.212.53.138</code> is located
            in the city of Erkrath in Germany with coordinates <code>51.22235, 6.9083</code>.</p>

          <p>
            When looking at the above WHOIS record, it becomes clear that there are many different attributes that could
            be used to extract the city name "Erkrath" or the country "Germany":
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>The country can be extracted from the <code>country</code> attribute: <code>DE</code></li>
            <li>The city can be extracted from the <code>netname</code> attribute:
              <code>PUMPENTECHNIK-ERKRATH-NET</code>
            </li>
            <li>The city can also be extracted from the <code>descr</code> attribute:
              <code>Pumpentechnik Erkrath GmbH + Co. KG</code>
            </li>
            <li>And the <code>address</code> attribute also reveals the city name:
              <code>Max-Planck-Str. 28, 40699 Erkrath</code>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Certainly, it is very hard to extract the city name from the <code>netname</code> and <code>descr</code>
            attributes, since those names have a free format. However, the <code>address</code> attribute can be easily
            used to parse out the location, since postal adresses have a much stricter format.
          </p>

            Another positive example is provided to illustrate that the <code>descr</code> attribute can often be used
            for geolocation purposes.
            When looking up the IP address <code>139.98.0.0</code> with <code>whois</code>, the following

          <p>According to most geolocation services, the IP address <code>139.98.0.0</code> is located in the city of
            Sarpsborg in Norway. This corresponds with what the <code>descr</code> attribute of the above WHOIS record
            states. Even better, the WHOIS record above provides a full address which allows for very accurate
            geolocation.
            This is an example that underlines the usablilty of the <code>descr</code> attribute for accurate

            The <code>address</code> attribute from above shows that the administrative location of the organization
            "Proximus" is located at <code>Boulevard du Roi Albert II, 27, B-1030 Bruxelles, Belgium</code>.
          </p>

          <p>
            However, most geolocation providers place the IP address <code>109.134.237.140</code> in other Belgian
            cities such as Hasselt, Grimbergen or Wuustwezel. Therefore, if we would use the <code>address</code>
            attribute from this WHOIS record, we would obtain a sligthly wrong geolocation. However, using Bruxelles as
            geolocation is still better than picking the wrong country or even a wrong continent. This example shows why
            geolocation providers often have
            approximative accuracy.

            <strong>Conclusion</strong>

          <p>
            Having seen the three examples from above, what attributes can be used from the RIPE NCC database to
            interpolate geolocation information from <code>inetnum</code> and <code>inet6num</code> objects?

            have at least three attributes that can potentially be used to derive geolocation information:
          </p>

            <li>The <code>country</code> attribute (Only yields country level accuracy)</li>
            <li>The <code>descr</code> attribute</li>
            <li>The <code>netname</code> attribute (Unreliable and hard to parse)</li>
            <li>The <code>address</code> attribute (Strictly speaking an attribute of the role object and not
              <code>inetnum</code> and <code>inet6num</code>)
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            The <code>country</code> attribute is defined in the <a href="https://apps.db.ripe.net/docs/04.RPSL-Object-Types/02-Descriptions-of-Primary-Objects.html#description-of-the-inetnum-object">RIPE
              Database
              Docs</a> as follows:
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            <strong>“country:”</strong> - This identifies a country using the ISO 3166-2 letter country codes. It has
            never been specified what this country represents. It could be the location of the head office of a
            multi-national company or where the server centre is based or the home of the End User. Therefore, it cannot
            be used in any reliable way to map IP addresses to countries.
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            The explanation above speaks for itself. It is somewhat safe to use the <code>country</code>
            attribute for geolocation, since the accuracy of country level information is rather coarse and thus the
            room of mistakes is reduced. Put differently: Since most multinational organizations have at least one
            postal address for each country, those organizations often use the postal address of the same country where
            the IP networks are actually used.
          </p>

          <p>
            The <code>descr</code> attribute is defined in the <a href="https://apps.db.ripe.net/docs/04.RPSL-Object-Types/02-Descriptions-of-Primary-Objects.html#description-of-the-inetnum-object">RIPE
              Database
              Docs</a> as follows:
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            <strong>“descr:”</strong> - A short description related to the object.
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            Therefore the contents of the <code>descr</code> attribute could be anything, since RIPE NCC does not
            strictly define what this value represents. It turns out that the <code>descr</code> attribute is often used
            by organizations to provide location and address information for the network. In conclusion, the
            <code>descr</code> attribute is very useful in order to derive geolocation information from it.
          </p>

          <p>
            Additional information can be provided for <code>inetnum</code> and <code>inet6num</code> objects
            with the <code>role</code> object. Therefore, it is also interesting to discuss the role object.
          </p>

          <p>
            The <code>address</code> attribute of role objects is defined in the <a href="https://apps.db.ripe.net/docs/04.RPSL-Object-Types/03-Descriptions-of-Secondary-Objects.html#description-of-the-role-object">RIPE
              Database
              Docs</a> as follows:
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            <strong>“address:”</strong> - This is a full postal address for the role represented by this object.
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            Even though <code>address</code> attributes can have high geolocation accuracy, the <code>address</code>
            attribute specifies the postal address of a role object. The <code>inetnum</code> and <code>inet6num</code>
            objects can have an address assigned via a role object, since the postal address of a company is not
            necessarily the location where the IP addresses are used.
          </p>

          <p>
            However, as the
            negative example from above proofs, it is a mistake to assume that IP addresses have the same geolocation as
            the
            postal address of a <a href="https://apps.db.ripe.net/docs/04.RPSL-Object-Types/03-Descriptions-of-Secondary-Objects.html#description-of-the-role-object">role

          <p>
            Most IP geolocation providers locate the IP address <code>192.42.152.0</code> in the city of Minneapolis in
            the US. This corresponds with the <code>City</code>, <code>StateProv</code>, <code>PostalCode</code> and
            <code>Country</code>
            attributes of the above WHOIS
            record.
            Thus, the above example shows that those attributes can be used to geolocate the network

          <p>
            Most IP geolocation providers locate the IP address <code>136.32.0.0</code> in San Antonio in Texas.
            However, if we would have used the above WHOIS record for geolocation, we would have taken the head office
            from Google in Mountain View, California for geolocation. This would obviously have been a mistake.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Conclusion</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            It seems that using the following ARIN WHOIS attributes is somewhat reliable if the organization is
            small or centered in only one location:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li><code>Address</code> attribute</li>
            <li><code>City</code> attribute</li>
            <li><code>StateProv</code> attribute</li>
            <li><code>PostalCode</code> attribute</li>
            <li><code>Country</code> attribute</li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            Examples for small organizations are universities, hospitals and governmental ministries. Those
            organizations
            use the IP
            addresses of <code>NetRange</code> objects the at the same
            location as their administrative postal address. This is not the case with larger businesses or nation wide
            organizations that own many <code>NetRange</code> objects.

          <p>
            It is not necessary to derive geolocation information from LACNIC WHOIS records, since LACNIC provides full
            geolocation support in their WHOIS database as <a href="#geolocation-lacnic">discussed
              earlier on this page</a>.

            AFRINIC has the same WHOIS database format as RIPE NCC, so the same principles apply as for <a href="#derive-geolocation-ripe-ncc">RIPE NCC</a>.
          </p>

          <p>In short, it is possible to use the <code>country</code> or <code>descr</code> attribute from <a href="https://apps.db.ripe.net/docs/04.RPSL-Object-Types/02-Descriptions-of-Primary-Objects.html#description-of-the-inetnum-object">inetnum</a>

            objects from the AFRINIC database to interpolate geolocation information.
          </p>

          <p>
            Furthermore, the <code>address</code> attribute from <a href="https://apps.db.ripe.net/docs/04.RPSL-Object-Types/03-Descriptions-of-Secondary-Objects.html#description-of-the-role-object">role
              objects</a> can also be used to derive geolocation
            information. The <code>address</code> attribute specifies the postal address of a role, which is often used
            to specify ownership of a network.
          </p>

          <h3 id="derive-geolocation-apnic">Geolocation Interpolation in APNIC</h3>

          <p>

            Several open source geolocation projects are explored in this section. Open source projects are often the
            basis for many commercial geolocation projects. Especially the contributions from RIPE NCC, APNIC and ARIN
            are reviewed,
            since those Regional Internet Registries provide the best support for geolocation.
          </p>

          <h3 id="ripe-ip-map">RIPE IPmap</h3>
          <p>
            <a href="https://ipmap.ripe.net/">RIPE IPmap</a> is (<em>was</em> - it seems that the it is not longer
            maintained) an API that provides
            geolocation data for core Internet
            infrastructure. RIPE IPmap uses several different engines to infer geolocation for IP addresses. RIPE IPmap
            is a system for active (live) IP geolocation, which means that each IP has to be geolocated actively, which
            can be a time consuming process.
          </p>

          <p>
            The most interesting engine from RIPE IPmap is called <code>latency</code> and <code>single-radius</code>
            engine. The <code>latency</code> engine uses measurements from <a href="https://atlas.ripe.net/">RIPE
              Atlas</a> to provide a latency radius for the geolocation of an IP address. Put differently, by using
            hundreds of geographically distributed latency measurement servers from <a href="https://atlas.ripe.net/">RIPE
              Atlas</a>, it is possible to estimate the location of an IP address by triangulating with minimum
            RTT
            measurements. The <a href="https://ipmap.ripe.net/docs/01.manual/#latency-and-single-radius">RIPE IPmap
              documentation</a>
            provides a full description for the latency engine.
          </p>

          <p>It is quite straightforward to understand how the <code>latency</code> engine works in practice. If a
            certain IP address needs to be geolocated, latency measurements can be either obtained by actively pinging
            the IP address or by recording the RTT of incoming connections (passive). The minimum latency sets an upper
            threshold for the maximal
            possible distance due to the definition of the speed of light in fiber optic medium.
          </p>

          <p>
            <code>reverse-dns</code> is another RIPE IPmap engine that uses the hostnames from PTR records in order to
            geolocate IP
            addresses. The <a href="https://ipmap.ripe.net/docs/01.manual/#reverse-dns">RIPE IPmap
              documentation</a> explains how the <code>reverse-dns</code> engine works. Essentially, the idea is
            to extract city level geolocation from PTR records of hostnames. For example, the following traceroute
            output reveals
            how hostnames from routers indicate their geogrpahical location:
          </p>

          <pre><code>ae59-300.edge9.frankfurt1.level3.net (62.67.4.229)  31.713 ms  29.638 ms

11  att-level3-washington12.level3.net (4.68.62.30)  119.936 ms  122.603 ms *</code></pre>

          <p>In the traceroute dump from above, it can be seen how the IP <a href="https://api.ipapi.is/?q=62.67.4.229">62.67.4.229</a> is located in
            Frankfurt (Germany) and the IP <a href="https://api.ipapi.is/?q=4.68.62.30">4.68.62.30</a> in Washington
            (USA) according to their respective
            hostnames.</p>

          <p>
            The RIPE IPmap database can be downloaded from here: <a href="https://ftp.ripe.net/ripe/ipmap/">https://ftp.ripe.net/ripe/ipmap/</a>
          </p>

          <p>
            The database has the
            following CSV format: <em>ip, geolocation_id, city_name, state_name, country_name, country_code_alpha2,
              country_code_alpha3, latitude, longitude, score</em>
          </p>

          <p>
            Unfortunately, while the ideas of RIPE IPmap are certainly still good, the project's accuracy and coverage
            degraded considerably according to the <a href="https://massimocandela.com/">former maintainers website</a>.
            It seems like there are no new contributions to RIPE IPmap since 2019.

            </span>
            Often the raw geolocation information obtained from WHOIS data or geofeeds don't include all the meta
            data
            necessary to populate all geolocation fields that the database provides. In this section, it is
            explaind how raw
            geolocation data is enriched by considering third party sources.
          </p>
          <p>
            This data enrichment process is
            achieved by using open source geographical databases such as:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.geonames.org/">geonames.org</a></li>

          </ul>

          <p>
            The data enrichment process can be divided into two cases:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>For those raw records where only city and country geolocation information is given, there is a need to
              find the latitude and
              longitude (coordinates) from a given city and country. <strong>Example:</strong> What are the geographical
              coordinates for <code>US, San Francisco</code>?</li>
            <li>On the other side, if only the latitude and longitude is available in the raw data, the goal is to
              obtain the closest city
              and country
              for those coordinates. <strong>Example:</strong> What is the closest city and country
              for the coordinates <code>52.524526 13.410037</code> (if there is a city at all close to those
              coordinates) ?</li>

<p>California, the home to many of tech's biggest companies and the nation's most populous state, is pushing ahead with a right-to-repair bill for consumer electronics and appliances. After unanimous votes in the state Assembly and Senate, <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB244">the bill</a> passed yesterday is expected to move through a concurrence vote and be signed by Governor Gavin Newsom.</p>
<p>"Since Right to Repair can pass here, expect it to be on its way to a backyard near you," said iFixit CEO Kyle Wiens <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/81914/california-just-became-the-third-state-to-pass-electronics-right-to-repair?vgo_ee=+yp32UzWRxiCpCfFlz7NX4XoB8DXLHyFH4hw+B7BWSID:3z5jlSe5zQew1t+RAzvFB9paMOMc63jI">in a statement</a>. iFixit, a seller of repair parts and tools and advocate for right-to-repair laws, based in San Luis Obispo, California, was joined in its support for the California repair law by another California company with a history of opposing repair laws: Apple. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/08/hell-freezes-over-as-apple-supports-right-to-repair-bill/">The consumer tech giant's letter urging passage of the bill</a> was surprising, to say the least, though Apple said that the bill's stipulations for "individual users' safety" and "product manufacturers' intellectual property" were satisfactory.</p>
<p>California's bill goes further than right-to-repair laws in other states. Rather than limiting its demand that companies provide parts, tools, repair manuals, and necessary software for devices that are still actively sold, California requires that vendors provide those items for products sold after July 1, 2021, starting in July 2024. Products costing $50 to $99.99 must be accompanied by those items for three years, and items $100 and more necessitate seven years. The bill also provides for stronger enforcement mechanisms, allowing for municipalities to bring superior court cases rather than contact the state attorney general.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>There are some concessions and potential pitfalls, however. Pricing of parts and tools is left at "fair and reasonable terms." The bill requires repair vendors that are "not an authorized repair provider" to "provide a written notice of that fact" to customers and to "disclose if it uses replacement parts that are used" or third-party. Apple specifically advocated for consumer notice of third-party parts and unauthorized repair in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/23/apple-lends-support-to-california-state-right-to-repair-bill/">its letter supporting the bill</a>.</p>
<p>Along with repair laws going into effect in 2024 in California, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/12/weakened-right-to-repair-bill-is-signed-into-law-by-new-yorks-governor/">New York</a>, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/05/minnesota-enacts-right-to-repair-law-that-covers-more-devices-than-any-other-state/">Minnesota</a> (along with bills <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/04/colorado-governor-signs-tractor-right-to-repair-law-opposed-by-john-deere/">focused on agriculture</a> and powered wheel chairs in Colorado), there are repair laws underway in Europe involving <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/03/tech-makers-must-provide-repairs-for-up-to-10-years-under-proposed-eu-law/">repair services</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/06/eu-wants-readily-removable-batteries-in-devices-soon-but-what-does-that-mean/">removable batteries</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/10/usb-c-mandate-moves-forward-in-eu-wireless-charging-regulation-could-follow/">USB-C standardization</a>, and other aspects of repair and sustainability. With three large states and Europe as a whole moving to enforce repairable design and after-purchase care, manufacturers may choose to offer compliant products everywhere, rather than divide their offerings.</p>
<p>Apple, notably, made a point of the increased repairability and durability of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/09/apples-new-iphone-15-pro-gets-new-chips-better-cameras-and-a-titanium-frame/">the titanium-framed iPhone 15</a> announced yesterday.</p>

<h2 id="xfce_wayland_development_roadmap">Xfce Wayland Development Roadmap</h2>

<p> This design document is intended for Xfce developers to begin brainstorming ideas for future development. This is a work in progress and does not imply any future implementation commitments.

<h2 id="short_term_plans">Short Term Plans</h2>
<div>

<p>
For Xfce 4.18, the plan is to ensure our applications are working acceptably on Wayland (those that already work or can be made to work with low effort). So, basically start testing with Weston and see if all menus, etc behave normally and ifdef Xlib code.
</p>

</div>

<h2 id="long_term_goals">Long Term Goals</h2>
<div>

<p>
It is not clear yet which Xfce release will target a complete Xfce Wayland transition (or if such a transition will happen at all).
Below is a list of larger tasks which would need to be done in some way for such a transition to occur.
</p>

<p>
Some of them are mostly agreed on by the Xfce devs, others are somewhat controversial (or no decision has been made so far).
</p>
<hr>

</div>

<h3 id="agreed">Agreed</h3>
<div>
<ul>
<li><p> Do not depend on XWayland</p>
<ul>
<li><p> No xsettings</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p> Use wlroots over libmutter</p>
<ul>
<li><p> keep posibillity to run xfdesktop and xfce4-panel as separate components</p>
</li>
<li><p> Prevent dependency on libgnome-desktop</p>
</li>
<li><p> xfce4-panel and xfdesktop have been ported to Wayland using wlroots. There is also an <a href="https://github.com/adlocode/xfwm4/tree/wayland" title="https://github.com/adlocode/xfwm4/tree/wayland" rel="ugc nofollow">unofficial port of xfwm4</a> in progress.</p>
</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<hr>

</div>

<h3 id="topics_under_discussion">Topics under discussion</h3>
<div>
<ul>
<li><p> What about X11 backward compatibility?</p>
<ul>
<li><p> As long as Nvidia does not support Wayland (by providing open drivers), it would be good to keep X11 backward compatibility (nouveau driver usually is slower)</p>
</li>
<li><p> Wayland compositors which were written from scratch like Weston or sway will never run as a x11 window manager. But others which started as x11 window managers such as kwin or mutter still keep their x11 window management code</p>
</li>
<li><p> We do not have the resources to maintain our own Wayland compositor</p>
</li>
<li><p> FreeBSD provides <a href="https://hikari.acmelabs.space/" title="https://hikari.acmelabs.space" rel="ugc nofollow">https://hikari.acmelabs.space</a>, not sure what is the situation for OpenBSD (possibly libinput missing?)</p>

<li><p> On Wayland the panel cannot use GtkSocket/GtkPlug any more to run plugins as external (separate processes). Initially, to advance in the porting of other features, it is enough to run them as internal (same process as the panel, so the crash of a plugin causes the panel to crash). If we want to get this back “natively” afterwards, it seems that we'll have to make the panel a Wayland compositor to some extent (<a href="https://wayland.freedesktop.org/docs/html/ch02.html#sect-Compositors-Embedding-Compositor" title="https://wayland.freedesktop.org/docs/html/ch02.html#sect-Compositors-Embedding-Compositor" rel="ugc nofollow">Embedding Compositor</a>, see also <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wayland/wayland-protocols/-/issues/74" title="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wayland/wayland-protocols/-/issues/74" rel="ugc nofollow">Allow embedding foreign wl_surfaces</a>). For the moment the socket/plug structure has been reproduced on Wayland using the layer-shell protocol and D-Bus, which, although not native, has the merit of simplicity and of reusing what exists (see also <a href="https://mail.xfce.org/pipermail/xfce4-dev/2022-October/033092.html" title="https://mail.xfce.org/pipermail/xfce4-dev/2022-October/033092.html" rel="ugc nofollow">https://mail.xfce.org/pipermail/xfce4-dev/2022-October/033092.html</a>).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p> Regarding tray icons, the panel already implements the freedesktop.org StatusNotifierItem specification. Though the plugins don't use those yet. Some plugins could be ported to do so. –&gt; We would need some sample skeleton to start from to make it easier for contributors. </p>

<p>
GTK doesn't appear to do anything special if you set a window to be override-redirect or always-on-top.  Window positioning isn't (always) controllable by the app on Wayland.

<h4 id="xfce4-screenshooter">xfce4-screenshooter</h4>
<div>

<p>
Wayland does not specify a native interface for the compositor for taking screenshots yet. Though there is a DBUS <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> offered by gnome(mutter?) for a <a href="https://github.com/flatpak/xdg-desktop-portal" title="https://github.com/flatpak/xdg-desktop-portal" rel="ugc nofollow">desktop portal</a> and as well wlroots has a screenshot protocol
</p>

<p>
So for xfce4-screenshooter there are the following options:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
</li>
<li><p> Add support for the wlroots screenshot protocol (link?)</p>
</li>
<li><p> wait until wayland specifies a native interface (see <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wayland/wayland/-/issues/32" title="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wayland/wayland/-/issues/32" rel="ugc nofollow">here</a>), and use it when available (Would make alot of sense for many applications, e.g. any video conferencing tool for screencast, so they dont need to implement multiple <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>'s)</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Note that backends for xdg-desktop-portals are as well in development for kde and wlroots:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
</li>
<li>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Currently (Feb 2020) both <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>'s will give screenshots of the whole screen to any client. So far the user has not to approve a screenshot / give permission to specific applications (like e.g. on android). So the security is comparable to the X-Server.

<h2 id="testing">Testing</h2>
<div>

<p>
Info about testing specific components.
</p>

<p>
Regarding the version to test: master, or latest dev release would be best, though latest stable release as well will do. Currently there is not much difference for most components. If you dont test master, best add info on which version you tested.
</p>

<p>
If you run a NVidia GPU, you will need to use the “Nouveau” driver for testing, Since the proprietary NVidia driver does not provide Wayland support. (Though some things might work in some cases)
</p>

<p>
In general, XWayland only is relevant if native Wayland does not work.
</p>

</li>
<li><p> If run in a terminal emulator, make sure at least the component to test isn't already running in your X11 session (e.g Thunar as daemon)</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://johnnydecimal.com">https://johnnydecimal.com</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37506640">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 id="a-system-to-organise-projects">A system to organise projects</h2>
<h4 id="we-have-lost-control-of-our-data">We have lost control of our data</h4>
<p>I believe that we are creating more data than we can manage.</p>
<p>The primary output of most workers is information. Day after day we produce more. <em>That is our job.</em></p>
<p>Yet we have utterly neglected the task of organising, sorting, and managing it.</p>
<p>I have not seen a corporate system in the last decade that was not totally broken because of the volume of unmanaged information.</p>
<h2 id="search-doesnt-help">Search doesn’t help</h2>
<p>At one point we thought that search would get us out of this mess. But search does not solve the corporate information problem.</p>
<p>File systems are disparate; the level of duplication is already too great; and the cues that Google uses to determine what’s useful — the links that are the fabric of the internet — just don’t exist at work.</p>
<p>You <em>can</em> search for things, but the results are garbage.</p>
<h2 id="find-your-stuff-again">Find your stuff again</h2>
<p>And so the purpose of Johnny.Decimal is simple.</p>
<p>It enables you to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>find things</strong></li>
<li><strong>quicker,</strong> with</li>
<li><strong>less stress,</strong> and</li>
<li><strong>more confidence</strong> than you can today.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will be able to find the <strong>latest</strong> and <strong>only</strong> version of a thing.</p>
<p>You will be confident that your file system is not strewn with duplicate versions that are being independently updated.</p>
<p>You will finally be in control of your project’s data.</p>
<h2 id="its-time-to-get-organised">It’s time to get organised</h2>
<p>There are a couple of core concepts, and they’re so simple you’ll wonder why you haven’t thought of them before.</p>
<p>It’s worth mentioning at this point that <strong>all of this is free,</strong> and it’s possible to implement it without any additional tools.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="step-1-divide-everything-in-to-ten-things">Step 1: Divide everything in to ten things</h2>
<ol>
<li>Take everything you need to organise and sort it in to, at most, ten large buckets.</li>
<li>Make sure the buckets are unambiguously different.</li>
<li>Put a label on each bucket.</li>
</ol>
<p>This forces you to group things quite broadly, but that’s the point.</p>
<p><strong>We call these buckets your <u>areas</u>.</strong></p>
<p>An area might be <code>Project management</code> or <code>Documentation</code>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="step-2-in-each-area-divide-in-ten-again">Step 2: In each area, divide in ten again</h2>
<p>Go through each of your new <strong><u>areas</u></strong> and repeat the process.</p>
<p><strong>This creates your <u>categories</u></strong>.</p>
<p>A category within the <code>Project management</code> area might be <code>Schedule</code>.</p>
<p>A category within <code>Documentation</code> might be <code>System design</code>.</p>
<p>Now we have ten areas which contain ten categories each. That’s a hundred categories <strong>at the very most</strong>. It’s very unlikely you will end up with a hundred categories.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="categories-are-the-key">Categories are the key</h2>
<p>What’s a category? It’s just a collection of stuff. Project schedules. Test plans. Design documents. Security reviews. Contracts.</p>
<p><strong>Any type of work you do can become a category.</strong></p>
<p>The point is that you’ve <em>defined</em> these categories, each of which is contained within a broader area. You do this when you set up your system, which we’ll get to shortly.</p>
<h3 id="we-give-each-category-a-number">We give each category a number</h3>
<p>Remember they’re grouped in tens, so our first ten categories will be numbers <code>10-19</code> and they will all be related to each other.</p>
<p>Let’s say <code>10-19</code> is our <code>Project management</code> area.</p>
<p>Category <code>11</code> might be <code>Scope</code>, <code>12 Schedule</code>, and so on.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="bring-in-the-numbers">Bring in the numbers</h2>
<p>A Johnny.Decimal number looks like this:</p>
<p><code>42.12</code> <code>12.03</code> <code>53.17</code></p>
<p>They’re short, memorable, and can be spoken out loud.</p>
<p><strong>They’re always two digits, a decimal point, and two more digits.</strong></p>
<p>Say it like “forty-two twelve” or “twelve dot oh-three”.</p>
<h2 id="before-the-decimal-category">Before the decimal: category</h2>
<p>The decimal point is there to break the number up, but more importantly to remind you that <strong>the number before the decimal is the important part.</strong> It’s the category.</p>
<p>The category’s number tells you which area it’s in. If your category starts with the digit <code>1</code>, that’s something to do with <code>Project management</code>.</p>
<p>At a glance, you know what the number contains. You’ll be astonished at how many of your category numbers you remember.</p>
<h2 id="after-the-decimal-id">After the decimal: ID</h2>
<p>The number after the decimal is just a counter. <strong>We call it the ID:</strong> it starts at <code>.01</code> and increases with each thing you create.</p>
<p>In these examples, <code>42.12</code> is the 12th thing you’ve saved in your <code>42</code> category.</p>
<p>The 3rd thing you’ve saved in your <code>12 Schedule</code> category might be <code>12.03 Schedule baseline March 2023</code>.</p>
<p><strong>The ID doesn’t have any relevance to the item itself</strong> – remember, it’s just a counter.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="i-get-the-idea-but-why-bother">I get the idea, but why bother?</h2>
<p>Many, many reasons.</p>
<h2 id="organise-your-files">Organise your files</h2>
<p>The most obvious use of Johnny.Decimal is in organising your folder structure.</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot of a macOS Finder window showing a hierarchical folder structure." srcset="https://johnnydecimal.com/img/11.01-finder-sample-company-expanded.jpg 2x" src="https://johnnydecimal.com/img/11.01-finder-sample-company-expanded.jpg" loading="lazy"></p><p>This is a folder structure for a generic IT project. (The reasoning behind the folder naming structure will be explained later.)</p>
<p>Notice how we have five areas, each with a couple of categories. None of the areas or categories overlap. <strong>There’s only one place anything can ever be.</strong></p>
<p>Even if you weren’t familiar with this folder structure, you’d be able to find your way to the system design directory.</p>
<h2 id="standardise">Standardise!</h2>
<p>Stop reinventing the wheel. I use the same <code>10-19 Project management</code> structure for every project. I have it committed to memory. (This is how I can find my scope statement in ten seconds.)</p>
<p>This one is modelled on PMP®. Either copy it, or adapt for whatever framework you use.</p>
<h2 id="nothing-is-more-than-two-clicks-away">Nothing is more than two clicks away</h2>
<p>An important restriction of the system is that <strong>you’re not allowed to create any folders inside a Johnny.Decimal folder.</strong></p>
<p>This means that you’ll never get lost in layers upon layers of folders. It also makes you create quite specific folders for each thing, ensuring that you can always find what you want.</p>
<h2 id="tell-people-where-things-are">Tell people where things are</h2>
<p>“Hey Kristy, where can I find the test case for this component?”<br>
“Forty-one dot twelve.”</p>
<p>Thanks, Kristy.</p>
<h2 id="fix-your-email">Fix your email</h2>
<p>Put the Johnny.Decimal number <a href="https://johnnydecimal.com/10-19-concepts/12-advanced/12.01-managing-email/">in your email subject</a> and you’ve instantly categorised everything. Your colleagues will think you have mystical powers because you’ll actually be able to find email again.</p>
<h2 id="display-it-on-printed-copies">Display it on printed copies</h2>
<p>Rather than including the complete file path on printed documentation, just add the Johnny.Decimal number.</p>
<h2 id="open-files-and-folders-instantly">Open files and folders instantly</h2>
<p>Because your folders contain the Johnny.Decimal number, you can open them without reaching for the mouse.</p>
<h3 id="mac-users">Mac users</h3>
<p>Press <code>Cmd + Space</code> to bring up <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT204014">Spotlight</a>. Type a Johnny.Decimal number. Press Return.</p>
<p>(If you like this sort of thing, check out <a href="https://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a>.)</p>
<h3 id="windows-users">Windows users</h3>
<p>Hit the Windows key. Type a Johnny.Decimal number in the Search box. Press Return.</p>
<h3 id="command-line-users">Command-line users</h3>
<p>Tab completion becomes a joy when your folders start with structured, predictable numbers. Or use a <a href="https://johnnydecimal.com/10-19-concepts/12-advanced/12.04-working-at-the-command-line/">small shell script</a> to pop you in to any folder instantly:</p>
<div id="terminal-container"><p><span>~ $</span><span> cjd 11.01</span></p><p><span>11.01 Scope statement $</span><span>█</span></p></div>
<h2 id="tag-things-in-real-life">Tag things in real life</h2>
<p>Managing physical objects? Write the Johnny.Decimal number on a sticky note.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="sold-lets-go">Sold? Let’s go</h2>
<p>By now you either <a href="https://johnnydecimal.com/10-19-concepts/11-core/11.02-areas-and-categories/">see the power of this and want more</a>, or you’re <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=chickens+on+the+beach&amp;t=osx&amp;iax=images&amp;ia=images/">confused and sad</a>.</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://noyb.eu/en/how-mobile-apps-illegally-share-your-personal-data">https://noyb.eu/en/how-mobile-apps-illegally-share-your-personal-data</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37506386">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
                    

<p><strong>Today, <em>noyb </em>filed three complaints in France against Fnac (the largest electronics store in France), the real estate app SeLoger and the Under Armour subsidiary MyFitnessPal. The companies’ apps illegally access and share users’ personal data with third parties for sophisticated analytics as soon as the apps are opened. Users don’t even have the choice to consent to or prevent the sharing of their data. This approach is unlawful.</strong></p>

<ul><li><a href="https://noyb.eu/sites/default/files/2023-09/Complaint%20Fnac%20FR_redacted.pdf">Example complaint against Fnac (FR)</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://noyb.eu/sites/default/files/2023-09/Complaint%20Fnac%20EN_redacted.pdf">English auto-translation of the example complaint</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://noyb.eu/sites/default/files/2023-09/Methodology_redacted.pdf">Methodology and technical specifications for the network traffic capturing and analysis</a></li>
</ul><p><strong>Transmission by default.</strong> The complainant installed the popular apps MyFitnessPal, Fnac and SeLoger on their Android smartphone. Once opened, the applications immediately began to collect and share personal data, including Google’s unique Advertising ID (AdID), the model and brand of their device and local IP address with third parties. Such extensive data collection allows the profiling of users in order to show them personalized ads and marketing campaigns to increase the revenue for the mentioned companies.</p>

<p><strong>No Consent.</strong> Under the ePrivacy Directive, the mere access or storage of data on the user’s terminal device is only allowed if users give their free, informed, specific and unambiguous consent. Two out of the three mobile apps did not display a consent banner when launching the app. The third app presented a banner that theoretically gave the complainant the choice of giving or withholding their consent. In reality, the transmission of their personal data began without any interaction on their part – and before they even had a chance to think about consent.</p>

<p>Ala Krinickytė, Data Protection Lawyer at <em>noyb</em>: <span><em>“Every app needs consent to track you. Instead, they use “data collection and tracking by default”. In contrast to tracking on websites, mobile apps have seen almost no enforcement so far.”</em></span></p>

<p><strong>Detailed tracking.</strong> Information such as the AdID is unique and linked to a specific person’s device. This allows advertisers and other third parties to single out users and allows them to target users in the future. Some app providers even track the user behavior outside their applications. This allows them to enrich the collected data with even more information about the user’s life.</p>

<p><strong>First result of a wider investigation.</strong> The way these apps handle their users’ data is symptomatic of a wider problem in the mobile apps environment. Although these applications often have millions of users, they don’t bother to comply with EU privacy laws – but share private data with third parties (including ad brokers) in order to monetize the data of their users. According to <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/soups2021-kollnig.pdf">research by Konrad Kollnig and others</a>, only 3.5 % of all apps gave users a real choice to decline consent.</p>

<p>Ala Krinickytė, Data Protection Lawyer at <em>noyb</em>: <em>“The illegal collection and sharing of users' personal data is a widespread problem in the mobile apps environment. It is key that the supervisory authorities now take appropriate action to put an end to this practice.”</em></p>

<p><strong>Analysis of mobile app privacy violations</strong>. In order to obtain evidence for the above-mentioned violations, a technical analysis of the smartphone apps’ network traffic was required. The network traffic capturing and analysis were conducted using the <a href="https://pts-project.org/">PiRogue Tool Suite</a> developed by the Defensive Lab Agency. You can find the detailed methodology <a href="https://noyb.eu/sites/default/files/2023-09/Methodology_redacted.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Deletion of data and a possible fine</strong>. <em>noyb </em>requests the CNIL to order MyFitnessPal, Fnac and SeLoger to delete all data that has been unlawfully processed. In addition, all recipients of the complainant’s data must be informed that the complainant has requested the deletion of any links, copies or replications of their personal data. Given the seriousness of the allegations and the potentially large number of individuals affected, <em>noyb </em>also suggests that the competent authority should impose a fine. These complaints are just the beginning: <em>noyb </em>is planning to file more complaints against mobile app companies in the future in order to stop the illegal sharing of user data.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-target="readme-toc.content">
            <article itemprop="text"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">I Shamefully Paid For Sublime Text</h2>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Overview</h2>
<p dir="auto">This repository is a testament to my audacious and unapologetic act of shelling out some hard-earned cash for Sublime Text. That's right, I willingly parted with my money for a text editor. Brace yourself for this thrilling saga of financial irresponsibility.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Why Sublime Text?</h2>
<p dir="auto">I mean, why not? It's a text editor that doesn't expect you to sacrifice a goat. It's like finding an inexplicable attachment to a text editor quietly waiting for you to discover its brilliance. No fanfare or confetti's—just a silent presence, pure, unadulterated functionality making itself indispensable. It's the kind of friend who never judges your messy code but helps you clean it up without a fuss.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">The Guilt Trip</h2>
<p dir="auto">For the longest time, I was living life on the edge, using Sublime Text without paying a single cent. Each "Ctrl + S" brought a pang of guilt, reminding me of my unpaid dues. It had been my loyal companion through thick and thin, and I had given it nothing in return. But here's the catch, Sublime Text casually shows you a dialog box with a reminder:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">"Would you like to purchase a license now?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Polite. Innocent. But in reality, a guilt trip in digital disguise. A sarcastic, rhetorical question which actually says <em>"After limitlessly trying all my features, how about you do the right thing?"</em></p>
<p dir="auto">The guilt became too much to bear, and I finally gave in to the pressure. I paid for it, not because I had to, but because I wanted to make amends.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">What I Got</h2>
<p dir="auto">Nothing. Absolutely nothing. I must admit, my life didn't change dramatically after I paid for Sublime Text. Sure, the reminder was gone but there was no grand parade or fanfare. Instead, I received:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>A peculiar sense of satisfaction and embarrassment, all rolled into one</li>
<li>The satisfaction of supporting a product that silently deserved recognition for equally supporting me for so long</li>
<li>A license key, a digital souvenir to remind myself of my guilt trip</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p dir="auto">That's it! You've successfully read a story about someone who shamefully paid for Sublime Text.
This repository stands as a monument to my somewhat questionable decision-making process, a reminder that even the staunchest proponents of free software can find themselves succumbing to a persuasive dialog box.</p>
<p dir="auto">So, if you're still using Sublime Text for free, fear not, as you are in the majority. But if you ever find yourself in a moment of weakness, remember this story of a developer who shamefully paid for a text editor.</p>

As a result, I do not have any first-hand experience choosing an off-the-shelf game engine. It’s not a decision I’ve ever had to make, and I don’t keep up with the latest developments across the myriad of engine options.</span></p><p><span>But I do follow game business trends to a certain extent, and </span><a href="https://twitter.com/cmuratori/status/1611148509100797954" rel="">for</a><span> </span><a href="https://twitter.com/cmuratori/status/1524580933357035521" rel="">well</a><span> </span><a href="https://twitter.com/cmuratori/status/1524143572164915201" rel="">over</a><span> a year now, I’ve been warning that Unity’s relationship with game developers would inexorably change for the worse.</span></p><p><span>This was not based on any inside knowledge. It was based solely on the financials they report, and the kinds of statements they make to investors in their earnings calls. If you </span><a href="https://s26.q4cdn.com/977690160/files/doc_financials/2023/q2/Unity-Software-Inc-_Earnings-Call_2023-08-02_English.pdf" rel="">read these regularly</a><span>, you get a very good sense for what a company’s priorities are in two ways: one, because you hear how they are pitching their future to investors; and two, because you can see how far in the hole they are financially, so you know whether they are likely to make major business model changes.</span></p><p><span>In Unity’s case, paying attention to their quarterly investor materials tells you many things that aren’t as common knowledge as they should be. As a small example, most developers think Unity is primarily in the business of selling game engines. They’re not! </span><em>Less than half their revenue</em><span> comes from game engines. </span><em>Over half</em><span> comes from advertising</span><em>.</em><span> Their bottom line is </span><em>more affected by the advertising market than it is by how many developers buy their engine.</em></p><p><span>There are many things like this you learn when you dig into their investor materials. In my opinion, </span><em>none</em><span> of their fundamentals boded well for Unity’s future as a game engine on which to base a game company — hence my tweets (“X’es”?) on the subject.</span></p><p><span>A few months after </span><a href="https://twitter.com/cmuratori/status/1524143572164915201?lang=en" rel="">I posted that Unity seemed likely to be absorbed</a><span>, Unity </span><a href="https://blog.unity.com/news/unity-ironsource-merger-growing-great-mobile-games" rel="">merged with IronSource</a><span>, a controversial company that has been </span><a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/07/24/most-troubling-thing-about-unitys-ironsource-deal/" rel="">accused of developing malware</a><span>. This was the first indication that things might (unfortunately) be going the way I had anticipated.</span></p><p><span>Now, less than a year later, Unity has </span><a href="https://blog.unity.com/news/plan-pricing-and-packaging-updates" rel="">announced</a><span> that they will be </span><em>retroactively</em><span>(!!) changing their license terms in order to charge game developers a substantial per-unit fee, despite </span><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/theres-no-royalties-no-f-ing-around-riccitiello" rel="">explicitly disavowing “royalty-like” structures in the past</a><span>. This move has sent shockwaves through the developer community, as one of Unity’s differentiating factors </span><em>was</em><span> that they only charged an up-front cost for their platform.</span></p><p><span>Developers are understandably upset by this move. Unity </span><em>already</em><span> charges high per-seat monthly rates to professional developers. At $185/mo, Unity Pro is </span><em>twenty-six times</em><span> as expensive as a subscription to Office365, and </span><em>three times</em><span> as expensive as Adobe’s “all apps” Creative Cloud subscription. At $250/mo, Unity Enterprise is among the most expensive end-user SaaS offerings a game developer might see — more expensive even than Autodesk’s Maya and 3DS MAX.</span></p><p><span>Yet despite these SaaS offerings being less expensive than Unity, to the best of my knowledge they have never tried to demand anything like a royalty from their paying customers. If they did, it didn’t last, because they do not charge any </span><em>today</em><span>.</span></p><p>Even if Unity ends up backpedaling due to backlash from this decision, it seems unlikely that developers will trust Unity going forward. Many are wondering if they should switch engines now to avoid relying on an untrustworthy partner for their core technology.</p><p><span>But switch engines </span><em>to what</em><span>?</span></p><p><span>Switching engines </span><em>from</em><span> Unity requires knowing what engine you might switch </span><em>to.</em><span> To that end, I was recently asked on X what I recommend as an engine for people who want to switch away from Unity. Since I have no opinions on this, I went ahead and asked developers to weigh in:</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2915c6f4-bcfd-4988-a13c-55c7fda78de8_586x303.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2915c6f4-bcfd-4988-a13c-55c7fda78de8_586x303.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2915c6f4-bcfd-4988-a13c-55c7fda78de8_586x303.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2915c6f4-bcfd-4988-a13c-55c7fda78de8_586x303.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2915c6f4-bcfd-4988-a13c-55c7fda78de8_586x303.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2915c6f4-bcfd-4988-a13c-55c7fda78de8_586x303.png" width="586" height="303" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2915c6f4-bcfd-4988-a13c-55c7fda78de8_586x303.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:303,&quot;width&quot;:586,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:34807,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2915c6f4-bcfd-4988-a13c-55c7fda78de8_586x303.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2915c6f4-bcfd-4988-a13c-55c7fda78de8_586x303.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2915c6f4-bcfd-4988-a13c-55c7fda78de8_586x303.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2915c6f4-bcfd-4988-a13c-55c7fda78de8_586x303.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>To make it easier for people to explore the responses, I tallied how many times each alternative engine was mentioned, and I’ve prepared a list </span><strong>from most-mentioned to least-mentioned</strong><span>.</span></p><p><span>I’ve also tried to summarize a little bit about what the engine seems to be “about”, but, take that with a </span><em>huge</em><span> grain of salt. As I’ve said multiple times now, </span><em>I don’t use</em><span> off-the-shelf-engines, so I have no first-hand knowledge here. If I’ve summarized anything inaccurately, please let me know in the comments, so I can correct it!</span></p><p>I’ve also tried to include the “scripting language” supported by each platform where applicable, so that people can quickly see if the engine directly supports a particular scripting language they know. Because they often don’t have official names, I’ve used “visual” if the platform has a built-in flowchart-like visual scripting language.</p><p><strong><a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="">Godot</a></strong><span> (C#, GDScript, visual). By far the most-mentioned alternative to Unity, Godot seems in many ways to be an open-source response to Unity: less focused on high-end engine features than something like Unreal, and more focused on being quick and easy to spin up for beginners. Common complaints seem to be that it is “not quite there yet” — perhaps because of bugs and missing features compared to Unity — and that it lacks first-class support for consoles, a feature most professional game developers now need. But it has been used in some recent notable games (</span><em>Brotato</em><span> and </span><em>Dome Keeper</em><span>), and it seems to have decent momentum behind it.</span></p><p><strong><a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US" rel="">Unreal</a><span> </span></strong><span>(visual). The Unreal Engine needs no introduction. A hefty percentage of the AAA releases in any given year run on one version or another of Epic’s flagship engine. Although it offers a host of AAA features like Nanite, Lumen, and Metahuman, common complaints are that its complex nature makes it more difficult to get started, and requires more technical expertise to work with. However, as </span><a href="https://www.flibitijibibo.com/" rel="">Ethan Lee</a><span> — who </span><em>does</em><span> have a ton of experience working with off-the-shelf-engines — </span><a href="https://gist.github.com/flibitijibibo/035087d8736441786b10e8c3879d50dd" rel="">wrote a few months back</a><span>, apparently shipping a game on Unreal is actually </span><em>easier</em><span> these days in many ways than shipping one on Unity if you’re aiming for a quality release.</span></p><p><strong><a href="https://defold.com/" rel="">Defold</a><span> </span></strong><span>(Lua). Mentioned almost as many times at Godot and Unreal was an engine I’d never heard of, Defold. Apparently this is a good engine to check out if you’re developing 2D or mobile games, and it appears that </span><em>tons</em><span> of mobile-style games have been shipped on it. If you’re looking for more of a 3D engine, it is probably not what you’re looking for.</span></p><p><strong><a href="https://www.raylib.com/" rel="">RayLib</a></strong><span>. RayLib is not an engine per se, but rather a library suite that allows you to quickly build games (and apps) in a native language like C++. It was mentioned multiple times, so it seems like DIY devs enjoy using this library — but, people looking for a turnkey solution with a full editor like Unity probably won’t be interested.</span></p><p><strong><a href="https://o3de.org/" rel="">Open 3D</a></strong><span> (Lua, visual). This is actually CryEngine, which was licensed by Amazon and made into LumberYard, which was then abandoned by Amazon and made into Open 3D, which is now maintained as open-source. So, if you like CryTek, you might be very interested in Open3D! However, being a descendant of a highly-specialized AAA-focused engine does suggest it might have a harder learning curve, so it’s unclear how much of an option this is for less technical developers.</span></p><p><strong><a href="https://gamemaker.io/en" rel="">GameMaker</a></strong><span> (GML, visual). For 2D games, GameMaker is an evergreen favorite, and very beginner-friendly. Many famous 2D games were made with GameMaker — </span><em>Undertale</em><span>, </span><em>Forager</em><span>, </span><em>Hyper Light Drifter</em><span>, </span><em>Gunpoint</em><span>, </span><em>Hotline Miami</em><span>, and </span><em>Spelunky</em><span>, just to name a few. If you don’t need 3D or fancy lighting, it seems like a solid choice. But for anything more technically demanding, GameMaker unfortunately seems to top out quickly.</span></p><p><strong><a href="https://unigine.com/" rel="">Unigine</a></strong><span> (C#). Though not primarily targeted at games, Unigine was mentioned multiple times as an option, and they do list games as a first-class application of their SDK. How useful a simulation-oriented SDK would be to someone coming from Unity, however, is an open question.</span></p><p><strong><a href="https://bevyengine.org/" rel="">Bevy</a></strong><span>. For Rust aficionados, the most commonly mentioned engine was Bevy. Presumably, if you’d like to program games in Rust, this would be an interesting one to check out, despite not yet establishing much of a pedigree. That said, it also doesn’t seem to ship with a complete editing environment, but rather some embeddable tools for putting editing in the game itself. This might be more of a hard sell for people coming from Unity’s integrated editing environment.</span></p><p><strong><a href="https://flaxengine.com/" rel="">Flax</a></strong><span> (visual). Like Defold, I’d never heard of Flax, but it touts a surprisingly large feature set, and provides integrated editing capabilities out of the box. However, it doesn’t seem like there are many (or any?) notable games shipping on this engine yet, which leaves a bit of a question mark as to its viability.</span></p><p><strong><a href="https://www.cocos.com/en" rel="">Cocos</a></strong><span> (JavaScript/TypeScript). Another full-featured engine with an integrated development environment, the modern-day Cocos suite is apparently the same tool lineage that was used fifteen years ago to make </span><em>FarmVille</em><span>. Although I wasn’t able to find out much about this engine, it does appear to still be mobile-focused.</span></p><p><strong><a href="https://www.stride3d.net/" rel="">Stride</a><span> </span></strong><span>(C#). Although it was mentioned multiple times, I had a hard time finding out much about this engine. Apparently, this is Silicon Studio’s Paradox engine, which was renamed Xenko, and then later renamed Stride. I’m not sure if any notable games have shipped on it, but like Unity, it is a C#-focused engine, and comes with a full editing environment.</span></p><p><strong><a href="https://www.monogame.net/" rel="">Monogame</a><span> </span></strong><span>(C#). Microsoft’s XNA was one of the most successful game-development-targeted SDKs ever made, spawning </span><em>Bastion</em><span>, </span><em>Owlboy</em><span>, </span><em>Timespinner</em><span>, </span><em>Magicka</em><span>, </span><em>Axiom Verge</em><span>, </span><em>Serious Sam Double D</em><span>, and of course, </span><em>Stardew Valley</em><span>. Being Microsoft, they responded to this overwhelming success by </span><em>canceling the project</em><span>. Thankfully, community developers picked up the slack, and Monogame is the result. A reimplementation of the XNA 4 API, it continues to be a popular base SDK for C# developers.</span></p><p><strong>And that’s not all</strong><span>. In addition to the platforms listed above — which were mentioned multiple times — there were several others mentioned only once, so I did not include them in the list. But that doesn’t mean they aren’t worth checking out! If you’re looking for more platforms to evaluate, the other ones people mentioned were: </span><a href="https://www.construct.net/en" rel="">Construct</a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.ogre3d.org/" rel="">Ogre3D</a><span>, </span><a href="https://solar2d.com/" rel="">Solar2D</a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.harfang3d.com/en_US/" rel="">HARFANG 3D</a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.cryengine.com/" rel="">CryEngine</a><span>, </span><a href="https://fna-xna.github.io/" rel="">FNA</a><span>, </span><a href="https://libgdx.com/" rel="">libGDX</a><span>, </span><a href="https://love2d.org/" rel="">LÖVE</a><span>, </span><a href="https://fyrox.rs/" rel="">Fyrox</a><span>, </span><a href="https://c4engine.com/" rel="">C4Engine</a><span>, </span><a href="https://hazelengine.com/" rel="">Hazel</a><span>, </span><a href="https://wickedengine.net/" rel="">Wicked</a><span>, </span><a href="https://tellusim.com/" rel="">TelluSim</a><span>, and </span><a href="https://heaps.io/" rel="">heaps.io</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>The biggest thing I realized when compiling this list was that </span><em>most developers probably don’t know what all their options actually are</em><span>. I bet a lot of people use Unity by default, not because they actually looked at all these other engines and determined that Unity </span><em>in particular</em><span> was best for their game or studio.</span></p><p><span>I think a huge help to everyone right now would be if developers could </span><em>share their experiences</em><span> with alternative engines. What kind of project did you use it for? How did development go? Are there any particular links to tutorials or educational materials that might help people get started? Do you know of any good overviews?</span></p><p>I am leaving this comment section open to everyone, so anyone who has experience to share can leave it in the comments below. Please try to be polite and helpful! And most of all, please try to give honest guidance to people about the engines you’ve used. That way people looking to make the switch can make a well-educated decision about which platform is best for them.</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

<p>I spent some time (in Fall 2023) reading about solar deployment. Some facts that struck me:</p>

<ul>
<li>Solar deployment is now running at about $500 billion per year, which means that about 0.5% of global GDP is being spent on solar deployment. This figure is up an improbable 43% Y/Y. <i>Source: <a href="https://about.bnef.com/blog/renewable-energy-investment-hits-record-breaking-358-billion-in-1h-2023/">BloombergNEF</a></i>

<img src="https://patrickcollison.com/static/files/solar/q2-23.jpg" width="400">
</li>

<li>If one takes at face value the estimate that the world will deploy 300–400 GW of solar in 2023 (<a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/renewable-energy-market-update-june-2023/executive-summary">IEA</a>), and that 1 MW of solar =~ 5 acres, we're deploying roughly 3–4 acres of solar per minute.</li>

<li>54% (29.1 GW) of the new electricity generation capacity in the US in 2023 will be solar. The next biggest category is battery storage. We'll add more than 4x more solar than natural gas, the leading fossil fuel-based category. <i>Source: <a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=55419">EIA</a></i>
<ul><li>
    As of September, the estimate <a href="https://www.solarpowerworldonline.com/2023/09/2023-will-be-the-biggest-installation-year-for-solar-in-the-united-states-ever/">increased</a> to 32 GW, representing a 52% increase over 2022.
</li></ul>
</li>

<li>In the EU, solar additions in 2022 (41 GW) were up 47% from 2021 (28 GW). <i>Source: <a href="https://www.solarpowereurope.org/press-releases/new-report-reveals-eu-solar-power-soars-by-almost-50-in-2022">SolarPower Europe</a></i></li>

<li>At peak, renewables provide up to ~90% of California's electricity. Of renewable sources in California, solar is by far the largest. <i>Source: <a href="https://www.gridstatus.io/live/caiso">GridStatus.io</a></i>

<!--**Help support the continued development of RPG in a Box!**
<br/>
As shown in the following graphic, I've decided to set a goal that I thought would be fun to work towards, and which will hopefully generate more interest in the engine. I chose free movement (i.e. character movement not restricted to a grid) since it wasn't a part of my original vision for RPG in a Box, but over time has become something that I'd like to pursue in the long-term. This goal doesn't change anything with current or future development plans - it would only open up the possibility of implementing free movement into the engine sooner rather than later. But most importantly, this could have a major impact on how much longer I can continue to develop RPG in a Box from here on out. Your help in spreading the word is appreciated so much! Thank you for your patience throughout the years and continuing to have faith in me and in this project.

		<p>Or: What happens when Newton’s laws are violated</p>
<p>Recently, I read a book called <i><strong>Newton and the Counterfeiter</strong></i>, subtitled <i><strong>The Unknown Detective Career of the World’s Greatest Scientist</strong></i>. It focuses on an awesome phase of Isaac Newton’s later career that, like his pursuits in alchemy, gets little mention in most accounts. The story, of Newton’s job as Warden of the Mint and his efforts bringing criminals to justice, contains many elements of a modern crime thriller: including an ingenious arch-adversary, Newton visiting the gin houses of London in disguise, personally interrogating suspects, playing good cop–bad cop, and using every trick in the book, before the book had been written. The story begins, as many of them do, at the beginning.</p>
<h2>The beginning</h2>
<p>Isaac Newton, 55 years old and just recovered from his nervous breakdown, was looking for a post in the city (London), having lived in the village of Cambridge ever since his student days. As a Great Man now, he had already been rewarded with a seat in parliament (the only thing ever recorded spoken by him is a request to close the window), but it appeared harder to get him a job. Finally, his friends pulled the right strings, and Newton moved in as Warden of the Mint in 1696.</p>
<p>The job was meant to be a sinecure (he had been promised that the position “has not too much business to require more attendance than you may spare”), and no one expected him to do anything special. Today though, we can look back and confidently say that Newton is the greatest Warden the Mint ever had. Unfortunately, this is not saying much, because it appears Newton is also the only good Warden the Mint ever had.</p>
<h2>The Mint</h2>
<p>The Royal Mint at the time had two officials in charge, both appointed by the king and with no well-defined hierarchy between them. The Warden of the Mint, with a salary of 400-odd pounds a year, was in charge of the Mint’s facilities, and the Master of the Mint, with a salary of 600 pounds a year plus (more substantial) a percentage of every coin made, was in charge of the actual production of new coins.</p>
<p>When Newton moved in as Warden, the Master was the notoriously corrupt and incompetent Thomas Neale, who was so lost in his gambling habit and his numerous enterprises that the operations of the Mint were, well, not in mint condition.</p>
<p>This was a bad time, because counterfeiting, clipping, and arbitrage had weakened the economy to the extent that there was a shortage of cash everywhere, most tax payments and trade had stopped, panic was rising, and civil war was imminent.</p>
<h2>Counterfeiters</h2>
<p>Counterfeiting was easy money, and everyone took to it. The government declared it high treason, a hanging offence, but this only made juries more reluctant to hang their peers. Of those counterfeiters who were brought to trial, many escaped conviction, even one of them through a wonderful incompetence defence:</p>
<blockquote><p>
        [I]nept counterfeiters attempting to exploit the currency crisis supplied the Old Bailey with a constant diet of rapidly dispatched defendants. Perhaps the most spectacular display of incompetence came from an unnamed “inhabitant of the parish of St. Andrews Holbourn,” brought to trial accused of copying French coins. His work was astonishingly awful, and he was acquitted, the jury accepting his rather bold argument that the poor quality of his work confirmed that “he had tryed to Coin with Pewter as aforesaid for Diversion, or the like, but never was concerned in Coining any manner of Money.” Few others tried this defense.
</p></blockquote>
<h2>The Great Recoinage: Newton takes over</h2>
<p>Faced with no alternative, the government had decided that the Mint would recoin everything — the Great Recoinage was to take place. It aimed to melt and restrike, in three years, more coins than it had produced in three decades. How anyone expected it to happen with Neale in charge of it is a mystery. As the recoinage began, it quickly turned into a farce, and it was clear to everyone that it would be an impossible task.</p>
<p>Newton saw what was happening, and couldn’t stand it. He read up on the history of the Mint, studied its operations, studied Neale, accumulated all the knowledge necessary, and somehow intimidated and pushed Neale aside in a bloodless coup, and took over the Great Recoinage himself. He streamlined the production, conducting probably one of the earliest “time-and-motion studies” (he synchronized workers’ operations to the rate of their heartbeat), running the mint from 4am to midnight, and finished the “clearly impossible task” ahead of schedule.</p>
<h2>Warden duty</h2>

<p>After saving the country from economic ruin, by doing something that wasn’t even his own job, Newton finally turned to a duty that his post actually came with — protecting the currency, by “enforcing the King’s law in and around London for all crimes committed against the currency”. This meant doing a policeman’s work — or rather, that of “a criminal investigator, interrogator, and prosecutor rolled into one”. He found the idea distasteful, not to mention the kind of men he would have to come in contact with, and requested that this be assigned to someone else, but when his request was denied he turned to the task in all seriousness.</p>
<p>Despite having hardly been a man of the world until then, he very quickly figured out what he had to do, better than anyone else had done. (In the mere four years he was Warden, he got dozens of counterfeiters hanged.)</p>
<p>He descended into the underworld … hiring men to go undercover, interrogating suspects, planting informers in prisons, the works. To avoid issues of jurisdiction he got himself appointed Justice of the Peace for nineteen counties surrounding London. Most criminals (one is almost tempted to say <em>victims</em>) were entirely unprepared against this kind of systematic prosecution, “utterly unprepared to do battle with the most disciplined mind in Europe”.</p>
<p>Except one.</p>
<h2>Arch-nemesis</h2>
<p>William Chaloner, counterfeiter, confidence trickster, and various things besides, the ingenious man who would one day challenge Sir Isaac Newton, had started small. He had set out from home — or had been thrown out — as a youth to apprentice under a nail-maker, where he learnt the basics of counterfeiting instead. Arriving in London with its oppressively exclusionary guild system, he somehow managed to survive, going through a series of professions including being a quack doctor, progressing to fortune teller, and then becoming a locator of stolen goods, at which he succeeded through the infallible trick of being the one to have stolen them in the first place.</p>
<p>[One of his most heinous sources of money was the following. Jacobite sedition—supporting the return of the deposed King James, over the reigning William of Orange—was treason and punishable with death, and there was a reward for those who gave up seditioners to the king. Chaloner tricked various printers into printing Jacobite propaganda, then used that as evidence to turn them in to be hanged, and claim his reward.]</p>
<p>Finally he turned to his true calling, that of counterfeiting. After coining a great deal of money (he once claimed to have produced more than thirty thousand pounds in his life, about four million pounds in today’s money) and getting caught a couple of times — once escaping conviction by turning informer, and the other time by coming up, along with his co-accused, with such a delightfully tangled mess of accusations and cross-accusations that everyone was let go out of confusion — he began to look for more safer avenues. He realised that for a man of his skill, making good counterfeit coins wasn’t the problem; having it untraceable back to him was. In an audacious plan, he realised that the safest place from which to pass his money was the Mint itself, and resolved to get into it.</p>
<p>He printed a couple of pamphlets giving advice to the government on how to prevent counterfeiting — here his expertise was all too evident — and even once gave a speech in parliament. Newton ignored him at first and denied him entry even to look at the machines in the mint, until Chaloner lost patience and decided to attack the man himself. (He alleged that the mint was making side money by participating in counterfeiting itself. The worst part was, some of these accusations were true: some dies <em>had</em> disappeared from the mint. Newton was put on trial and forced to defend himself, and nearly lost his job.)</p>
<p>Big mistake.</p>
<p>Newton was finally annoyed, and made it his goal to destroy him. Over the next two years, he devoted much of his life to ruining Chaloner’s. With customary ruthlessness, he set about accumulating evidence and witnesses. By now Chaloner was in custody again — bank notes and a Malt Lottery had just come into existence, and of course he counterfeited them — so he was out of the way. Newton got spies and informers planted in all the right places, he tracked down old contacts of Chaloner — friends, female coiners he’d had affairs with, wives of former associates — and subpoenaed (or just intimidated) them into giving testimony, anticipated who would try to flee to Scotland when, and prepared an impenetrable web of evidence. It is more complicated than that, and Chaloner still did his best from behind bars and the whole cat-and-mouse game has more details than I have any remaining patience to go into now :-), but you can read about them in the book. Chaloner was brought to trial. He tried every defence in succession, from pleading innocence to madness to pointing out (validly) that he was being tried by a Middlesex jury for crimes committed in London. He was convicted nevertheless, and after Newton ignored all the piteous mercy petitions he wrote, was  hanged, drawn and quartered.</p>
<h2>Newton’s later years</h2>
<p>In 1699 the worthless Neale finally died, and Newton became Master of the Mint on Christmas Day, his 57th birthday. The responsibilities of the job had already been <i>de facto</i> handled by Newton for years, but Neale had gained all the proceeds from the coining — 22,000 pounds. Newton now became the only recorded Warden to become Master. Although the Great Recoinage was over, the Mint still was in production, and Newton made 3500 the first year. He finally gave up his Cambridge professorship which he had still retained, went on to become genuinely rich for the first time, and seems to have led a contented life. Much later he lost 20000 pounds in the South Sea Bubble, the world’s first stock market crash — Newton is attributed to have said: “I can calculate the movement of the stars, but not the madness of men”.</p>
<p>He was knighted in 1705, the first scientist to be knighted (though possibly for political reasons rather than either his science or Mint work), and died in 1727, aged 84. Despite being one of the greatest and most influential scientists of all time, he wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>
I don’t know what I may seem to the world, but as to myself, I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the sea shore, and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered around me.

            <div>
                    <p>On August 29, 2023, Retool notified 27 cloud customers that there had been unauthorized access to their accounts. If you’re reading this and you were not notified, don’t worry – your account was not impacted. <strong>There was no access to on-prem or managed accounts. </strong>Nevertheless, here’s what happened, with the hope that this will help apply the lessons we’ve learned and prevent more attacks across the industry.</p><h2 id="what-happened">What happened</h2><p>On August 27, 2023, we fell victim to a spear phishing attack. The attacker was able to navigate through multiple layers of security controls after taking advantage of one of our employees through a SMS-based phishing attack. </p><p>Several employees received targeted texts, claiming that a member of IT was reaching out about an account issue that would prevent open enrollment (which affects the employee’s healthcare coverage). The timing coincided with a recently announced migration of logins to Okta, and the message contained a url disguised to look like our internal identity portal. Almost all employees didn’t engage, but unfortunately one employee logged into the link provided by the attackers.</p><p>The following is a transcription of the message:</p><p><em>Hello A, This is B. I was trying to reach out in regards to your [payroll system] being out of sync, which we need synced for Open Enrollment, but i wasn’t able to get ahold of you. Please let me know if you have a minute. Thanks</em></p><p><em>You can also just visit https://retool.okta.com.[oauthv2.app]/authorize-client/xxx and I can double check on my end if it went through. Thanks in advance and have a good night A.</em></p><p>After logging into the fake portal – which included a MFA form – the attacker called the employee.</p><p>The caller claimed to be one of the members of the IT team, and deepfaked our employee’s actual voice. The voice was familiar with the floor plan of the office, coworkers, and internal processes of the company. Throughout the conversation, the employee grew more and more suspicious, but unfortunately did provide the attacker one additional multi-factor authentication (MFA) code. </p><p>The additional OTP token shared over the call was critical, because it allowed the attacker to add their own personal device to the employee’s Okta account, which allowed them to produce their own Okta MFA from that point forward. This enabled them to have an active GSuite session on that device. Google recently released the <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2023/04/google-authenticator-now-supports.html?ref=retool.com">Google Authenticator synchronization feature</a> that syncs MFA codes to the cloud. As <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35690398&amp;ref=retool.com">Hacker News noted</a>, this is highly insecure, since if your Google account is compromised, so now are your MFA codes. </p><p>Unfortunately Google employs dark patterns to convince you to sync your MFA codes to the cloud, and our employee had indeed activated this “feature”. If you install Google Authenticator from the app store directly, and follow the suggested instructions, your MFA codes are by default saved to the cloud. If you want to disable it, there isn’t a clear way to “disable syncing to the cloud”, instead there is just a “unlink Google account” option. In our corporate Google account, there is also no way for an administrator to centrally disable Google Authenticator’s sync “feature”. We will get more into this later.</p><p>We use OTPs extensively at Retool: it’s how we authenticate into Google and Okta, how we authenticate into our internal VPN, and how we authenticate into our own internal instances of Retool. The fact that access to a Google account immediately gave access to all MFA tokens held within that account is the major reason why the attacker was able to get into our internal systems.</p><p>Getting access to this employee’s Google account therefore gave the attacker access to all their MFA codes. With these codes (and the Okta session), the attacker gained access to our VPN, and crucially, our internal admin systems. This allowed them to run an account takeover attack on a specific set of customers (all in the crypto industry). (They changed emails for users and reset passwords.) After taking over their accounts, the attacker poked around some of the Retool apps.</p><p>After learning of the attack, we immediately revoked all internal authenticated sessions (Okta, GSuite, etc) for employees, locked down access to the affected accounts, notified the affected customers, and restored their accounts to their original state (with original email addresses), reverting the 27 account takeovers. <br></p><p>As an aside, we’re glad that not a single on-premise Retool customer was affected. Retool on-prem operates in a “zero trust” environment, and doesn’t trust Retool cloud. It is fully self contained, and loads nothing from the cloud environment. This meant that although an attacker had access to Retool cloud, there was nothing they could do to affect on-premise customers. It’s worth noting that the vast majority of our crypto and larger customers in particular use Retool on-premise. <br></p><p>With the attack scope defined, let’s dig into what we learned, starting with our biggest point of vulnerability: software-based OTPs for MFA.<br></p><h2 id="beware-of-%E2%80%9Cmfa%E2%80%9D">Beware of “MFA”</h2><p>We have an internal Retool instance used to provide customer support; this is how the account takeovers were executed. The authentication for this instance happens through a VPN, SSO, and a final MFA system. A valid GSuite session alone would have been insufficient. </p><p>The fact that Google Authenticator syncs to the cloud is a novel attack vector. <strong>What we had originally implemented was multi-factor authentication. But through this Google update, what was previously multi-factor-authentication had silently (to administrators) become single single-factor-authentication</strong>, because control of the Okta account led to control of the Google account, which led to control of all OTPs stored in Google Authenticator. We strongly believe that Google should either eliminate their dark patterns in Google Authenticator (which encourages the saving of MFA codes in the cloud), or at least provide organizations with the ability to disable it. We have already passed this feedback on to Google.</p><h2 id="sharing-our-lessons">Sharing our lessons<br></h2><p><strong>Social engineering can affect anyone</strong></p><p>Social engineering is a very real and credible attack vector, and anyone can be made a target. If your company is large enough, there will be somebody who unwittingly clicks a link and gets phished. Especially as social engineering evolves (with AI and deepfakes, but also with more personal information being available on the internet), educating, preventing, and testing (via red teams) your employees regarding phishing attacks will become ever more important.</p><p><strong>Preventing systematic failures</strong></p><p>Even with perfect training and awareness of these attacks, mistakes will happen. Just like preventing a junior engineer from accidentally dropping the production database, there need to be systems in place to prevent human error from impacting the overall system. SMS as a second-factor has been rightly criticized for being too vulnerable to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIM_swap_scam?ref=retool.com">SIM swapping attacks</a>. Time-based one-time password (TOTP), while resilient to SIM swapping, is still vulnerable to the same social engineering threat vectors.</p><p>Hardware security keys– using <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido2/?ref=retool.com">FIDO2</a> provide resilience to these threats. A code can’t be disclosed to an attacker– since there isn’t a code to share in the first place! </p><p><strong>Defense in depth</strong></p><p>We’re equipped with many levels of protection, including multiple MFA codes, multiple lines of defense (Okta account, VPN, internal admin system, etc.). That said, technological solutions only go so far, and we believe that adding a human-in-the-loop is necessary (although again, not sufficient, given deepfakes) for important actions. We oftentimes bias towards technological solutions because they’re easy to self-serve, but ultimately, anything that can be done by an employee can be socially engineered out of that employee too. <br></p><p>We have already implemented this at Retool internally, and expect to implement this in Retool — the product — so our customers have access to building these kinds of human-in-the-loop workflows too. <br></p><p><strong>Trust as little as possible</strong></p><p>This incident only affected a very small subset of Retool cloud customers– no on-prem or managed accounts were impacted. We intentionally architected <a href="https://retool.com/self-hosted/?ref=retool.com">Retool on-prem</a> such that it doesn’t trust Retool cloud. Retool on-prem makes no contact to Retool cloud; it is fully self-hosted (the front-end, back-end, storage, etc. are all within your own VPC). This way, customers are fully in control of their security (as well as when they update), and do not need to trust Retool. Even though our cloud systems were compromised, there was no way for attackers to compromise Retool on-premise. We are fortunate we architected on-premise this way. <br></p><p>The vast majority of our customers in more sensitive industries (e.g. crypto, healthcare, finance, etc.) use our on-premise solution, and we encourage our customers to consider it, if security is important.<br></p><p><strong>Understand your threat model</strong></p><p>Retool is in the unique position of being a platform where you can build any sort of software imaginable. However, that also means that customers still need to treat building in Retool with the same care and attention to security that traditional codebases require.<br></p><p>We encourage you to understand your own threat model: if you are operating in an industry where apps have access to dangerous, irreversible actions, we strongly recommend customers to integrate further protections. For example, we encourage customers to require separate MFA tokens to execute actions (a first-class primitive in Retool), or escalation flows that require multiple employees to approve actions above certain thresholds (soon to become a first-class primitive in Retool). When we examined our forensics, customers who built secure apps and understood their threat matrix were effective at repelling the attack, even despite the account takeovers.</p><h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion<br></h3><p>This situation was challenging. It’s embarrassing for the employee, disheartening to cybersecurity professionals, and infuriating for our customers. For those reasons, these kinds of attacks are difficult to talk about, but we believe that they should be addressed in the open. There are clear risks here that the industry needs to address (e.g. the dark patterns in Google Authenticator). Our hope is that by publishing these attack vectors we can make the industry overall more aware, and enable cybersecurity professionals to harden their own systems. </p><p><em>Editor's note: We are actively working with law enforcement and a third party forensics firm.</em></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-target="readme-toc.content">
            <article itemprop="text"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Unity Engine to Godot Engine exporter</h2>
<p dir="auto">This is an experimental script that allows you to convert all scenes in your Unity project into a Godot project. It is not aimed at doing everything automatically, only things that can be converted decently.
It's only a proof of concept on simple 2D games for now, and a ton of work remains to be done if it were to support everything else.
While there are always cases where conversion is ambiguous and things to do manually, it's still fun to at least have the ability to automate this to some extent.</p>
<p dir="auto">I have other projects to work on so I won't work much on this tool for now, and I am aware that there is an abysmal amount of features it could support^^ But feel free to hack around with it and improve it if you like the idea.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How to install</h2>
<p dir="auto">Copy this repository in your Unity project, inside a folder named <code>Editor</code>, and you should see a new <code>Godot</code> menu with options in it.</p>
<p dir="auto">Although it should not modify anything in the project, it's up to you to preserve your data if anything wrong happens :p</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Some challenges</h2>
<p dir="auto">Here is a random list of things I had to take choices, for which workarounds may or may not exist.
There may be a lot more, but you can get an idea of what this tool has to get through:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">Unity only has <code>Camera</code>, but Godot has <code>Camera2D</code> and <code>Camera</code> for 3D. Choosing which one is ambiguous, so for now I create the 2D version of the camera is orthographic AND if a hint is enabled in the exporter for 2D projects. Also, in Unity, cameras also act as viewports, which is another separate node in Godot, so I'm not sure how to even convert those. Other components are ambiguous too, such as <code>Light</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Godot has separate engines for 2D and 3D, but Unity only has 3D transforms with ortho camera. So the tool tries to guess what usage a GameObject is for by looking at its components. For example, if it has <code>SpriteRenderer</code>, or any of its children does, then the GameObject is converted to a <code>Node2D</code>. Otherwise, it becomes a <code>Spatial</code>. In some cases, it becomes a blank <code>Node</code> in cases where dimensions are irrelevant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Unity uses components attached to GameObjects for its functionality, but Godot uses a node tree directly. That means a single GameObject with several components may convert into one node and several child nodes. If a GameObject only has a Transform and one component, a shortcut is taken to only produce a single Godot node, eliminating the unnecessary nesting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Unity defines rigidbodies as components, but in Godot it is recommended to have such bodies as parent nodes because they control the position of their children, so instead of adding <code>RigidBodies</code> as a child nodes, they are have to be promoted as parent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Unity can have multiple scripts on the same GameObject, but Godot can only have one per node. So the converter takes the first script it finds to the root node, and create children <code>Nodes</code> for each additional script. You may have to have a manual look after conversion if you use composition a lot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Converting scripts is very complicated, so the tool rather creates stub scripts for each of them so it can still attach them to the proper final nodes, and attempts to preserve serialized variables. For example, when converting to GDScript, a C# script will be parsed for its variables which will be written as <code>export</code> on top of an empty GDScript, and the rest or the original source code is written as a big comment below them. This allows to keep configurations and keep track of what the script should be.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">In Sprite texture resources, Unity allows to define a scaling between pixel coordinates and world coordinates, which is 100 by default, making sprites very small. Godot uses pixels as units at all times, so the plugin attempts to undo this scaling.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Unity can subdivide a 2D texture into sprites, so this almost always translates to Godot as <code>AtlasTextures</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Unity uses a left-handed coordinate system, and in 2D its Y axis stays upwards. In Godot, the Y axis in 2D is downwards, so the tool attempts to invert positions (not working as best as it could at the moment)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Godot has no terrain system as of now, but a plugin exists for heightmaps which does not require recompilation. So the plugin could be packaged in the output project, and Unity terrains could be mostly converted to that format.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Things requiring a recompilation of Godot cannot be supported, for example the Admob module needs to be integrated into Godot manually by recompiling the engine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Unity and Godot both support prefabs and nested prefabs, but I haven't worked in this part yet. On Unity side it should be a matter of using <code>PrefabUtility</code> to detect if a game object is actually an instance of a prefab, and it needs some research to see which delta-modifications are supported both by Unity and Godot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">As of 3.1 Godot only saves non-default values in scene data, but this tool can't afford to know them all, so scenes generated by it may be larger than if you had created them in Godot. Saving them from Godot might get rid of the redundancy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Unity can imports 3D models as "fixed" prefabs, a bit like Godot does, so I am not sure if the tool should generate scenes for those, or let Godot do it</p>
</li>
</ul>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After their previous controversy with license changes, in 2019, after disagreements with Improbable, unity updated their Terms of Service, with the following statement:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When you obtain a version of Unity, and don’t upgrade your project, we think you should be able to stick to that version of the TOS. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>As part of their "commitment to being an open platform", they made a Github repository, that tracks changes to the unity terms to "give developers full transparency about what changes are happening, and when"</p>

<p>Well, sometime around June last year, they silently deleted that Github repo.</p>

<p>April 3rd this year (slightly before the release of 2022 LTS in June), they updated their terms of service to remove the clause that was added after the 2019 controversy. That clause was as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Unity may update these Unity Software Additional Terms at any time for any reason and without notice (the “Updated Terms”) and those Updated Terms will apply to the most recent current-year version of the Unity Software, provided that, if the Updated Terms adversely impact your rights, <strong>you may elect to continue to use any current-year versions of the Unity Software</strong> (e.g., 2018.x and 2018.y and any Long Term Supported (LTS) versions for that current-year release) according to the terms that applied just prior to the Updated Terms (the “Prior Terms”). The Updated Terms will then not apply to your use of those current-year versions unless and until you update to a subsequent year version of the Unity Software (e.g. from 2019.4 to 2020.1). If material modifications are made to these Terms, Unity will endeavor to notify you of the modification.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This clause is completely missing in the new terms of service. </p>

<p>This, along with unitys claim that "the fee applies to eligible games currently in market that continue to distribute the runtime." flies in the face of their previous annoucement of "full transparency". They're now expecting people to trust their questionable metrics on user installs, that are rife for abuse, but how can users trust them after going this far to burn all goodwill?</p>

<p>They've purposefully removed the repo that shows license changes, removed the clause that means you could avoid future license changes, then changed the license to add additional fees retroactively, with no way to opt-out.

<p>The first-of-its kind shop will now enter in collective bargaining negotiations with the studio</p>
				</div><div><p>
	<span><a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/visual-effects/" id="auto-tag_visual-effects" data-tag="visual-effects">Visual effects</a> workers</span>  at <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/marvel/" id="auto-tag_marvel" data-tag="marvel">Marvel</a> Studios have voted to form a <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-features/marvel-visual-effects-workers-union-fight-wandavision-black-panther-1234807406/">first-of-its-kind union</a> with the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	The Marvel VFX shop not only enjoyed a historic victory, but a landslide one as well: All votes cast in the election — held by mail between Aug. 21 and Sept. 11 — were in favor of unionizing, with none against. Anna George, an assistant coordinator at Marvel, spoke about watching the votes get tallied yesterday, saying, “It was so emotional hearing the yes’s and knowing we were fighting for what we deserve. What a powerful moment!”</p>



<p>
	Sarah Kazuko Chow, a VFX coordinator at Marvel, added: “I grew up dreaming of working on Marvel films, so when I started my first job at Marvel, I felt like I couldn’t complain about the unpaid overtime, the lack of meal breaks, and the incredible pressure put on VFX teams to meet deadlines because I was just supposed to be grateful to be here at all. But the reality is that every worker deserves rights, and joining IATSE means we don’t have to choose between the job we love and having identities outside of our work.”

	</p>




<p>
	Following the successful vote with the NLRB, Marvel’s VFX union will now enter into collective bargaining negotiations with Marvel. A start date for those negotiations hasn’t been announced yet. &nbsp;</p>



<p>
	A rep for Marvel and its parent company Disney did not immediately return <em>Rolling Stone</em>’s request for comment.</p>



<p>
	Underpinning the union drive were the poor working conditions visual effects professionals have endured on Marvel productions, including a lack of pay equity, grueling hours, understaffing, excessive requests for changes, and unfair turnaround times.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	Mark Patch, a former VFX worker at Marvel who now organizes VFX crews for IATSE, recently told <em>Rolling Stone</em>, “We’ve seen [that] the lack of guardrails and protections has created an environment where the employer has unlimited control of our whole lives.”&nbsp;

<p>
	VFX crews have been a crucial part of film and TV productions since the introduction of visual effects in the first <em>Star Wars </em>films of the 1970s. But while many other backstage/behind-the-scenes crews and professions (such as production designers, editors, lighting, make-up, and props) have long been unionized under the IATSE umbrella, VFX workers largely remained non-union.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	Marvel’s VFX crew was the first to break that barrier with the announcement last month that they planned to hold a union vote. They were quickly followed by their <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-news/walt-disney-visual-effects-vfx-crew-file-to-unionize-1234813567/">colleagues at Walt Disney Pictures</a>, who filed for a vote with the NLRB at the end of August (the results of that election are expected on Oct. 2).&nbsp;These union drives also pointedly come amidst a historic dual strike for two of Hollywood’s most prominent unions, the <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-news/writers-strike-wga-labor-day-message-chris-keyser-1234818024/">Writers Guild of America</a> and the <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-pictures/actors-strike-hollywood-stars-picket-lines-1234800423/">Screen Actors Guild</a>.</p>

<div id="the-editor">
<h2>The editor<a href="#the-editor" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Godot Engine provides a rich-featured editor that allows you to build your games.
The pictures below display the default layouts of both editors with colored blocks to indicate common functionalities.</p>
<p><img alt="../../_images/unity-gui-overlay.png" src="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.1/_images/unity-gui-overlay.png">
<img alt="../../_images/godot-gui-overlay.png" src="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.1/_images/godot-gui-overlay.png"></p><p>While both editors may seem similar, there are many differences below the surface.
Both let you organize the project using the filesystem,
but Godot’s approach is simpler with a single configuration file, minimalist text format,
and no metadata. This makes Godot more friendly to VCS systems, such as Git, Subversion, or Mercurial.</p>
<p>Godot’s Scene panel is similar to Unity’s Hierarchy panel but, as each node has a specific function,
the approach used by Godot is more visually descriptive. It’s easier to understand
what a scene does at a glance.</p>
<p>The Inspector in Godot is more minimal, it shows only properties.
Thanks to this, objects can expose more useful parameters to the user
without having to hide functionality in language APIs. As a plus, Godot allows animating any of those properties visually.
Changing colors, textures, enumerations, or even links to resources in real-time is possible without needing to write code.</p>
<p>The Toolbar at the top of the screen is similar in both editors, offering control over project playback.
Projects in Godot run in a separate window, rather than inside the editor
(but the tree and objects can still be explored in the debugger window).</p>
<p>This approach has the disadvantage that in Godot the running game can’t be explored from different angles
(though this may be supported in the future and displaying collision gizmos in the running game is already possible),
but in exchange has several advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Running the project and closing it is fast (Unity has to save, run the project, close the project, and then reload the previous state).</li>
<li>Live editing is a lot more useful because changes done to the editor take effect immediately in the game and are not lost (nor have to be synced) when the game is closed. This allows fantastic workflows, like creating levels while you play them.</li>
<li>The editor is more stable because the game runs in a separate process.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, Godot’s top toolbar includes a menu for remote debugging.
These options allow deployment to a device (connected phone, tablet, or browser via HTML5),
and debugging/live editing on it after the game is exported.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-scene-system">
<h2>The scene system<a href="#the-scene-system" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This is the most important difference between Unity and Godot and the favourite feature of most Godot users.</p>
<p>Working on a ‘level’ in Unity usually means embedding all the required assets in a scene
and linking them together with components and scripts.</p>
<p>Godot’s scene system is superficially similar to Unity. A ‘level’ consists of a collection of nodes, each with its own purpose: Sprite, Mesh, Light, etc. However, in Godot the nodes are arranged in a tree. Each node can have multiple children, which makes each a subscene of the main scene.
This means you can compose a whole scene with different scenes stored in different files.</p>
<p>For example, think of a platformer level. You would compose it with multiple elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bricks</li>
<li>Coins</li>
<li>The player</li>
<li>The enemies</li>
</ul>
<p>In Unity, you would put all the GameObjects in the scene: the player, multiple instances of enemies,
bricks everywhere to form the ground of the level and then multiple instances of coins all over the level.
You would then add various components to each element to link them and add logic in the level: For example,
you’d add a BoxCollider2D to all the elements of the scene so that they can collide. This principle is different in Godot.</p>
<p>In Godot, you would split your whole scene into three separate, smaller scenes, and instance them in the main scene.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>A scene for the Player alone.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Consider the player as an element we’d like to use in different parent scenes (for instance ‘level’ scenes). In our case, the player element needs at least an AnimatedSprite node. This node contains the sprite textures necessary for various animations (for example, a walking animation).</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>A scene for the Enemy.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>An enemy is also an element we’d like to use in several scenes. It’s almost the same
as the Player node. The only differences are the script (it needs ‘AI’ routines to generate the enemy’s behaviour)
and the sprite textures used by the AnimatedSprite node.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>A Level scene.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>A Level scene is composed of Bricks (for platforms), Coins (for the player to collect) and a
number of instances of the Enemy scene. Each instance is a node in the Level scene tree. These instances are separate enemies,
which initially have shared behaviour and appearance as defined in the Enemy scene. You can set different properties for each Enemy node (to change its color, for example).</p>
<p>4. <strong>A Main scene.</strong>
The Main scene would be composed of one root node with 2 children: a Player instance node, and a Level instance node.
The root node can be anything, generally a “root” type such as “Node” which is the most global type,
or “Node2D” (root type of all 2D-related nodes), “Spatial” (root type of all 3D-related nodes) or
“Control” (root type of all GUI-related nodes).</p>
<p>As you can see, every scene is organized as a tree. The same goes for nodes’ properties: you don’t <em>add</em> a
collision component to a node to make it collidable like Unity does. Instead, you make this node a <em>child</em> of a
new specific node that has collision properties. Godot features various collision types nodes, depending on the usage
(see the <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.1/tutorials/physics/physics_introduction.html#doc-physics-introduction"><span>Physics introduction</span></a>).</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What are the advantages of this system? Wouldn’t this system potentially increase the depth of the scene tree? And doesn’t Unity already allow you to organize GameObjects by putting them inside empty GameObjects?</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul>
<li>Godot’s system is closer to the well-known object-oriented paradigm: Godot provides a number of nodes which are not clearly “Game Objects”, but they provide their children with their own capabilities: this is inheritance.</li>
<li>Godot allows the extraction of a subtree of a scene to make it a scene of its own. So if a scene tree gets too deep, it can be split into smaller subtrees. This is better for reusability, as you can include any subtree as a child of any node. Putting multiple GameObjects in an empty GameObject in Unity does not provide the same functionality.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="project-organization">
<h2>Project organization<a href="#project-organization" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><img alt="../../_images/unity-project-organization-example.png" src="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.1/_images/unity-project-organization-example.png"></p><p>There is no perfect project architecture.
Any architecture can be made to work in either Unity and Godot.</p>
<p>However, a common architecture for Unity projects is to have one Assets folder in the root directory
that contains various folders, one per type of asset: Audio, Graphics, Models, Materials, Scripts, Scenes, and so on.</p>
<p>Since Godot allows splitting scenes into smaller scenes, each scene and subscene existing as a file in the project, we recommend organizing your project a bit differently.
This wiki provides a page for this: <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.1/getting_started/workflow/project_setup/project_organization.html#doc-project-organization"><span>Project organization</span></a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="where-are-my-prefabs">
<h2>Where are my prefabs?<a href="#where-are-my-prefabs" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A prefab as provided by Unity is a ‘template’ element of the scene.
It is reusable, and each instance of the prefab that exists in the scene has an existence of its own,
but all of them have the same properties as defined by the prefab.</p>
<p>Godot does not provide prefabs as such, but the same functionality is provided by its scene system:
The scene system is organized as a tree. Godot allows you to save any subtree of a scene as a scene file. This new scene can then be instanced as many times as you want, as a child of any node.
Any change you make to this new, separate scene will be applied to its instances.
However, any change you make to the instance will not have any impact on the ‘template’ scene.</p>
<p><img alt="../../_images/save-branch-as-scene.png" src="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.1/_images/save-branch-as-scene.png"></p><p>To be precise, you can modify the parameters of an instance in the Inspector panel.
The nodes that compose this instance are initially locked. You can unlock them if you need to by
right-clicking the instance in the Scene tree and selecting “Editable children” in the menu.
You don’t need to do this to add <em>new</em> child nodes to this node.
Remember that any new children will belong to the instance, not to the ‘template’ scene on disk.
If you want to add new children to every instance of your ‘template’ scene, then you should add them in the ‘template’ scene.</p>

<div id="design">
<h3>Design<a href="#design" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Unity supports C#. C# benefits from its integration with Visual Studio and has desirable features such as static typing.</p>
<p>Godot provides its own scripting language, <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.1/getting_started/step_by_step/scripting.html#doc-scripting"><span>GDScript</span></a> as well as support
for <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.1/getting_started/scripting/visual_script/index.html#toc-learn-scripting-visual-script"><span>Visual Script</span></a> and <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.1/getting_started/scripting/c_sharp/c_sharp_basics.html#doc-c-sharp"><span>C#</span></a>.
GDScript borrows its syntax from Python, but is not related to it. If you wonder about the reasoning for a custom scripting language,
please read the <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.1/getting_started/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_basics.html#doc-gdscript"><span>GDScript basics</span></a> and <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.1/about/faq.html#doc-faq"><span>Frequently asked questions</span></a> pages. GDScript is strongly attached to the Godot API
and doesn’t take long to learn: Between one evening for an experienced programmer and a week for a complete beginner.</p>
<p>Unity allows you to attach as many scripts as you want to a GameObject.
Each script adds a behaviour to the GameObject: For example, you can attach a script so that it reacts to the player’s controls,
and another that controls its specific game logic.</p>
<p>In Godot, you can only attach one script per node. You can use either an external GDScript file
or include the script directly in the node. If you need to attach more scripts to one node, then you may consider two solutions,
depending on your scene and on what you want to achieve:</p>
<ul>
<li>either add a new node between your target node and its current parent, then add a script to this new node.</li>
<li>or, you can split your target node into multiple children and attach one script to each of them.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, it can be easy to turn a scene tree to a mess. Consider splitting any complicated scene into multiple, smaller branches.</p>
</div>
<div id="connections-groups-and-signals">
<h3>Connections: groups and signals<a href="#connections-groups-and-signals" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>You can control nodes by accessing them via script and calling built-in
or user-defined functions on them. You can also place nodes in a group
and call functions on all nodes in this group. See more in the
<a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.1/getting_started/step_by_step/scripting_continued.html#doc-scripting-continued"><span>scripting documentation</span></a>.</p>
<p>Nodes can send a signal when a specified action occurs. A signal can
be set to call any function. You can define custom signals and specify
when they are triggered. See more in the <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.1/getting_started/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_basics.html#doc-gdscript-signals"><span>signals documentation</span></a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="script-serialization">
<h3>Script serialization<a href="#script-serialization" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Unity can handle script serialization in two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Implicit: All public fields in a class are automatically serialized if the type is a serializable type (<code><span>Dictionary</span></code> is not serializable).</li>
<li>Explicit: Non-public fields can be serialized using the <code><span>[SerializeField]</span></code> attribute.</li>
</ul>
<p>Godot also has a built-in script serialization system, but it works only explicitly.
You can serialize any serializable type (<a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.1/tutorials/misc/binary_serialization_api.html#doc-binary-serialization-api"><span>built-in and various engine types</span></a>,
including <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.1/classes/class_array.html#class-array"><span>Array</span></a> and <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.1/classes/class_dictionary.html#class-dictionary"><span>Dictionary</span></a>) using the <code><span>export</span></code> keyword.
See the <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.1/getting_started/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_basics.html#doc-gdscript-exports"><span>exports documentation</span></a> for details.</p>
<p>Unity also has a data type called <code><span>ScriptableObject</span></code> used to serialize custom asset objects.
Its equivalent in Godot is the base class for all resources: <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.1/classes/class_resource.html#class-resource"><span>Resource</span></a>.
Creating a script that inherits <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.1/classes/class_resource.html#class-resource"><span>Resource</span></a> will allow you to create custom serializable objects. More information about resources can be found <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.1/getting_started/step_by_step/resources.html#doc-resources"><span>here</span></a>.</p>

<div id="using-godot-in-c">
<h2>Using Godot in C++<a href="#using-godot-in-c" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Godot allows you to develop your project directly in C++ by using its API, which is not possible with Unity at the moment.
As an example, you can consider Godot Engine’s editor as a “game” written in C++ using the Godot API.</p>
<p>If you are interested in using Godot in C++, you may want to start reading the <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.1/development/cpp/introduction_to_godot_development.html#doc-introduction-to-godot-development"><span>Developing in
