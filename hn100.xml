<p>The United States’ carbon emissions increased while China’s declined in the first half of this year compared to the same period in 2024, pointing to a massive shift in roles between the world’s two biggest climate polluters if the trend continues.</p>



<p>Between January 1 and June 30 this year, U.S. emissions rose 4.2% while China’s fell 2.7%, <a href="https://carbonmonitor.org/variation">reports</a> Carbon Monitor, a global emissions tracker led by Tsinghua University, France’s Laboratory of Climate and Environmental Sciences, the University of California, Irvine, and China’s Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Institute.</p>



<p>In China, emissions were down 1.4% across the power sector and industry, and held statistically even across all other economic sectors. The United States was one of just three countries, along with Japan and Brazil, that saw emissions rise across their entire economies—including increases of 2% in ground transport and 1.3% in the power sector.</p>



<p>Across all the individual countries in the Carbon Monitor database, Spain recorded the highest emissions increase, at 6%, followed by Brazil at 5.6%, Germany at 5.2%, the European Union plus the United Kingdom at 4.6%, and the U.S. at 4.2%.</p>



<p>Between the world’s two leading emitters, the data show “a reversal of the usual trend over the past decade, when global heat-trapping emissions inched higher in large part because U.S. reductions have been offset by higher CO2 output from China,” Politico <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/power-switch/2025/08/13/a-new-way-the-us-may-be-falling-behind-china-00506487">writes</a>. “It also comes after decades of American politicians of both parties complaining about China failing to clean up its act.”</p>



<p>The numbers could still be shifted by factors like weather, short-term economic trends, and natural gas prices, Politico writes. “But there are also signs of structural changes in the global economy.” International Energy Agency (IEA) figures show Chinese coal consumption falling 2.6% in the first half of the year, largely due to a boom in solar that saw the country add 92 gigawatts of capacity—that’s 92 billion watts—in a single month in May, compared to all-time U.S. installations of 134 GW.</p>



<p>That reflects a fundamental shift in the way China consumes energy, climate scientist Glen Peters of the Oslo-based Center for International Climate Research (CICERO) told Politico, though it’s still early to declare a permanent change. “Even if Chinese emissions decline this year, I would not start saying they have peaked,” he said. “I would want to see emissions trending down for a few years.”</p>



<p>But U.S. per capita emissions are still well above China’s, <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/global-energy-review-2025">according to</a> the latest IEA data. And with Donald Trump <a href="https://www.theenergymix.com/a-self-inflicted-tragedy-congress-approves-reversal-of-u-s-climate-policy/">moving on all fronts</a> to increase fossil fuel production and revoke renewable energy incentives and confirmed contracts, Stanford University earth systems scientist Rob Jackson said the broader trends are clear—even if it’s too soon to say where the 2025 data will land.</p>



<p>“It’s fair to say that China and the U.S. are on different trajectories now,” he told Politico, with clean technology adoption likely to drive down emissions over the next five years. The U.S., by contrast, is “heading in the opposite direction.”</p>

<p>The United States’ carbon emissions increased while China’s declined in the first half of this year compared to the same period in 2024, pointing to a massive shift in roles between the world’s two biggest climate polluters if the trend continues.</p>



<p>Between January 1 and June 30 this year, U.S. emissions rose 4.2% while China’s fell 2.7%, <a href="https://carbonmonitor.org/variation">reports</a> Carbon Monitor, a global emissions tracker led by Tsinghua University, France’s Laboratory of Climate and Environmental Sciences, the University of California, Irvine, and China’s Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Institute.</p>



<p>In China, emissions were down 1.4% across the power sector and industry, and held statistically even across all other economic sectors. The United States was one of just three countries, along with Japan and Brazil, that saw emissions rise across their entire economies—including increases of 2% in ground transport and 1.3% in the power sector.</p>



<p>Across all the individual countries in the Carbon Monitor database, Spain recorded the highest emissions increase, at 6%, followed by Brazil at 5.6%, Germany at 5.2%, the European Union plus the United Kingdom at 4.6%, and the U.S. at 4.2%.</p>



<p>Between the world’s two leading emitters, the data show “a reversal of the usual trend over the past decade, when global heat-trapping emissions inched higher in large part because U.S. reductions have been offset by higher CO2 output from China,” Politico <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/power-switch/2025/08/13/a-new-way-the-us-may-be-falling-behind-china-00506487">writes</a>. “It also comes after decades of American politicians of both parties complaining about China failing to clean up its act.”</p>



<p>The numbers could still be shifted by factors like weather, short-term economic trends, and natural gas prices, Politico writes. “But there are also signs of structural changes in the global economy.” International Energy Agency (IEA) figures show Chinese coal consumption falling 2.6% in the first half of the year, largely due to a boom in solar that saw the country add 92 gigawatts of capacity—that’s 92 billion watts—in a single month in May, compared to all-time U.S. installations of 134 GW.</p>



<p>That reflects a fundamental shift in the way China consumes energy, climate scientist Glen Peters of the Oslo-based Center for International Climate Research (CICERO) told Politico, though it’s still early to declare a permanent change. “Even if Chinese emissions decline this year, I would not start saying they have peaked,” he said. “I would want to see emissions trending down for a few years.”</p>



<p>But U.S. per capita emissions are still well above China’s, <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/global-energy-review-2025">according to</a> the latest IEA data. And with Donald Trump <a href="https://www.theenergymix.com/a-self-inflicted-tragedy-congress-approves-reversal-of-u-s-climate-policy/">moving on all fronts</a> to increase fossil fuel production and revoke renewable energy incentives and confirmed contracts, Stanford University earth systems scientist Rob Jackson said the broader trends are clear—even if it’s too soon to say where the 2025 data will land.</p>



<p>“It’s fair to say that China and the U.S. are on different trajectories now,” he told Politico, with clean technology adoption likely to drive down emissions over the next five years. The U.S., by contrast, is “heading in the opposite direction.”</p>

More than a month passed before the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/fbi" data-link-name="in body link">FBI</a> arrived at his door on 15 July.</p><p>The 35-year-old, who used his GI Bill to earn a degree in sustainable communities from<strong> </strong>Sonoma State University<strong>, </strong>was set to move into a 3,000-sq-ft house that day, which he had bought with his girlfriend, a nurse and fellow Afghanistan war veteran, with the help of a loan backed by the Department of Veterans Affairs.</p><p>Mavalwalla’s father, a retired US army intelligence officer with three Bronze Stars earned during tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, brought his truck for the occasion. He planned to move his son into a dream home in a bucolic, southern section of Spokane that was large enough to accommodate their blended family (Mavalwalla has one child; his girlfriend, Katelyn Gaston, has three) and solidify the couple’s life together.</p><figure id="6e16be26-a95c-4287-8ba0-888ba7794517" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.YoutubeBlockElement"><gu-island name="YoutubeBlockComponent" priority="critical" deferuntil="visible" props="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;30879003-2aa6-4e6a-8fe2-d81f9dccae33&quot;,&quot;assetId&quot;:&quot;YyhqLKKxDUE&quot;,&quot;index&quot;:8,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;design&quot;:0,&quot;display&quot;:0,&quot;theme&quot;:0},&quot;isMainMedia&quot;:false,&quot;expired&quot;:false,&quot;posterImage&quot;:&quot;https://media.guim.co.uk/164e158a19c30e9876245dfb65f1e2de7dbe71ae/0_0_1920_1080/1920.jpg&quot;,&quot;duration&quot;:154,&quot;mediaTitle&quot;:&quot;FBI arrests US army veteran for ‘conspiracy’ over protest against Ice –&nbsp;video&quot;,&quot;origin&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com&quot;,&quot;stickyVideos&quot;:false,&quot;enableAds&quot;:true,&quot;iconSizeOnDesktop&quot;:&quot;large&quot;,&quot;iconSizeOnMobile&quot;:&quot;large&quot;,&quot;hidePillOnMobile&quot;:false}"><div data-chromatic="ignore"><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="36" height="23" viewBox="0 0 36 23"><path d="M3.2 0l-3.2 3.3v16.4l3.3 3.3h18.7v-23h-18.8m30.4 1l-8.6 8v5l8.6 8h2.4v-21h-2.4"></path></svg></span><span>FBI arrests US army veteran for ‘conspiracy’ over protest against Ice –&nbsp;video</span></figcaption></div></gu-island></figure><p>But at 6am the FBI knocked on Mavalwalla’s door and they arrested him.

I’m an American citizen.”</p><p>At 3pm, Mavalwalla, who receives disability compensation for post traumatic stress disorder connected to his service in Afghanistan, appeared in federal court along with eight other people indicted in connection with a protest against an Ice transport that occurred a month earlier.</p><p>While the indictment alleges other protesters struck federal officers and let the air out of the tires of an Ice transport, Mavalwalla was not charged with obstruction or assault. Instead, he was <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-edwa/pr/defendants-charged-assaulting-federal-law-enforcement-officers-other-offenses-during" data-link-name="in body link">charged</a> with “conspiracy to impede or injure officers”.</p><p>According to the indictment, Mavalwalla and his co-defendants “physically blocked the drive-way of the federal facility and/or physically pushed against officers despite orders to disperse and efforts to remove them from the property”.</p><p>Mavalwalla, who has no criminal record, pleaded not guilty.</p><p>His family says Mavalwalla’s actions were motivated by a commitment to non-violent protest, which traces back to the family’s deep connection to the Indian independence leader, Mahatma Gandhi.</p><p>A one-minute video <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DKz9feUPZJe/" data-link-name="in body link">posted on Instagram</a> shows the army veteran briefly jostle with an officer whose face is covered by a ski mask and sunglasses. Mavalwalla then locks arms with other demonstrators to block the gate.</p><p>The conspiracy count carries a maximum penalty of six years in prison, a $250,000 fine and three years of supervised release. He was released on his own recognizance while awaiting trial, with a judge even giving him permission to travel to Disneyland for a previously planned family vacation.</p><h2 id="hes-a-test-case-to-see-how-far-they-can-go">‘He’s a test case to see how far they can go’</h2><p>The US attorney’s office in Spokane, which brought the charges, declined to comment, citing an ongoing investigation.</p><p>The indictment was handed down two days after career prosecutor Richard Barker, the acting US attorney for eastern Washington state, resigned. In a social post, Barker called his exit “a very difficult decision”.</p><p>“I am grateful that I never had to sign an indictment or file a brief that I didn’t believe in,” he <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7350949196650213377/" data-link-name="in body link">wrote</a>.</p><p>The current acting US attorney, nominated for the permanent post by Donald Trump, is Pete Serrano, a former litigator for the Silent Majority Foundation, a conservative advocacy group. In February, Serrano <a href="https://irp.cdn-website.com/6a12d959/files/uploaded/89-1.pdf" data-link-name="in body link">filed an amicus brief</a> in support of Trump’s executive order to end birthright citizenship, a position at odds with the 14th amendment. He has no prosecutorial experience and has described the January 6 US Capitol rioters as “political prisoners”.</p><p>Patty Murray, a Democratic senator from Washington state, has <a href="https://www.krem.com/article/news/local/senator-murray-block-confirmation-eastern-wa-federal-prosecutor-pete-serrano/293-99d00dc0-13bb-45cc-b9fd-f3bc76e59a35" data-link-name="in body link">pledged</a> to block his confirmation.</p><p>Legal experts say the conspiracy charges against Mavalwalla underscore the lengths the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Trump administration</a> will go to quash protests against Ice, giving the immigration agency a free hand as it steps up raids, adds agents and seeks to achieve the president’s goal of 3,000 deportations per day.</p><p>So far, the Trump administration has primarily charged demonstrators for assault and obstruction, acts that typically involve a victim and an assailant.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/usimmigration" data-link-name="in body link">US immigration</a> agents will have access to one of the world’s most sophisticated hacking tools after a decision by the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration" data-link-name="in body link">Trump administration</a> to move ahead with a contract with Paragon Solutions, a company founded in Israel which makes spyware that can be used to hack into any mobile phone – including encrypted applications.</p><p>The Department of Homeland Security first entered into a contract with Paragon, now owned by a US firm, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ice-paragon-solutions-contract/" data-link-name="in body link">in late 2024</a>, under the Biden administration. But the $2m contract was put on hold pending a compliance review to make sure it adhered to an executive order that restricts the US government’s use of spyware, Wired reported at the time.</p><p>That pause has now been lifted, according to <a href="https://www.fpds.gov/ezsearch/search.do?indexName=awardfull&amp;templateName=1.5.3&amp;s=FPDS.GOV&amp;q=70CTD024P00000012+7012+" data-link-name="in body link">public procurement documents</a>, which list US <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ice-us-immigration-and-customs-enforcement" data-link-name="in body link">Immigration and Customs Enforcement </a>(Ice) as the contracting agency.</p><p>It means that one of the most powerful stealth cyberweapons ever created – which was produced outside the US – is now in the hands of an agency that has repeatedly been accused by civil and human rights groups of violating people’s due process rights.</p><p>The story was first reported by the journalist Jack Poulson on his <a href="https://jackpoulson.substack.com/p/exclusive-ice-has-reactivated-its" data-link-name="in body link">All-Source Intelligence Substack newsletter</a>.</p><p>Neither <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/paragongroupofcompanies" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Paragon</a> nor Ice immediately responded to a request for comment.</p><p>When it is successfully deployed against a target, the hacking software – called Graphite – can hack into any phone. By essentially taking control of the mobile phone, the user – in this case, Ice – can not only track an individual’s whereabouts, read their messages, look at their photographs, but it can also open and read information held on encrypted applications, like WhatsApp or Signal. Spyware like Graphite can also be used as a listening device, through the manipulation of the phone’s recorder.</p><p>An <a href="https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/executive-order-14093-prohibition-use-the-united-states-government-commercial-spyware-that" data-link-name="in body link">executive order signed by the Biden administration</a> sought to establish some guardrails around the US government’s use of spyware. It said that the US “shall not make operational use of commercial spyware that poses significant counterintelligence or security risks to the United States government or significant risks of improper use by a foreign government or foreign person”. The Biden administration also took the extraordinary step of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/nov/03/nso-group-pegasus-spyware-us-blacklist" data-link-name="in body link">placing one of Paragon’s rival spyware makers, NSO Group, on a commerce department blacklist</a>, saying the company had knowingly supplied foreign governments to “maliciously target” the phones of dissidents, human rights activists and journalists.</p><p>Paragon has sought to differentiate itself from NSO Group. It has said that, unlike NSO – which previously sold its spyware to Saudi Arabia and other regimes – that it only does business with democracies. It has also said it has a no tolerance policy and will cut off government clients who use the spyware to target members of civil society, such as journalists. Paragon refuses to disclose who its clients are and has said it does not have insight into how its clients use the technology against targets.</p><p>Spyware makers like Paragon and NSO have said their products are intended to be used to prevent crime and terrorist attacks. But both companies’ software has been used in the past to target innocent people, including individuals who have been perceived to be government enemies.</p><p>John Scott-Railton, a senior research at the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto, who is one of the world’s leading experts on cases in which <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2025/06/first-forensic-confirmation-of-paragons-ios-mercenary-spyware-finds-journalists-targeted/" data-link-name="in body link">spyware like Graphite has been abused by governments</a>, said in a statement that such tools “were designed for dictatorships, not democracies built on liberty and protection of individual rights”.</p><p>“Invasive, secret hacking power is corrupting. That’s why there’s a growing pile of spyware scandals in democracies, including with Paragon’s Graphite,” he said, referring to a controversy in Italy that erupted late last year.</p><figure id="953358b4-99ba-484b-8e32-c0d5fd01142a" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props="{&quot;richLinkIndex&quot;:12,&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&quot;,&quot;prefix&quot;:&quot;Related: &quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Videos reveal harsh conditions inside Ice’s New York City confinement center&quot;,&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;953358b4-99ba-484b-8e32-c0d5fd01142a&quot;,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;richLink&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/22/ice-videos-new-york-trump&quot;},&quot;ajaxUrl&quot;:&quot;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;design&quot;:0,&quot;display&quot;:0,&quot;theme&quot;:0}}"></gu-island></figure><p>Paragon broke off its ties to Italy after it was revealed that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/31/whatsapp-israel-spyware" data-link-name="in body link">90 people, including journalists and members of civil society,</a> in two dozen countries, had been targeted with the spyware. The individuals who were targeted by the Italian government included human rights activists who have been critical of Italy’s dealings with Libya. Several journalists were also targeted, though it is still unclear who ordered those hacking attacks.</p><p>The US government has in the past resisted using spyware technology made outside the US because of concerns that any company that sells technology to multiple government agencies around the world represents a potential security risk.</p><p>“As long as the same mercenary spyware tech is going to multiple governments, there is a baked-in counterintelligence risk. Since all of them now know what secret surveillance tech the US is using, and would have special insights on how to detect it and track what the US is doing with it,” Scott-Railton said. “Short of Paragon cancelling all foreign contracts, I’m not sure how this goes away.”</p><p>Nadine Farid Johnson, policy director at the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, which is dedicated to free speech advocacy, said news of the Ice contract compounded civil liberty concerns surrounding the “rapid and dramatic expansion of Ice’s budget and authority”. She also called on Congress to step in and limit the circumstances in which spyware could be deployed.</p><p>“Spyware like Paragon’s Graphite poses a profound threat to free speech and privacy,” Farid Johnson said. “It has already been used against journalists, human rights advocates, and political dissidents around the world. The quiet lifting of the stop work order also raises the troubling prospect that parts of the executive branch are acting without adherence to the government’s own vetting requirements.”</p></div></div>]]></description>

In this new role, I’ll be working directly with customers to help them succeed with Ada. Although I was first introduced to the language nearly two decades ago, this new position inspired me to revisit its fundamentals, and I used the excellent <a href="https://learn.adacore.com/">https://learn.adacore.com</a> portal as a quick refresher.</p><p dir="ltr">While that platform takes a concept-based approach, I chose to complement it with a project-based method by developing a small, end-to-end Ada program that generates animated rosettas in the form of SVG files. These are technically hypotrochoid curves, producing patterns that many will recognize from the classic <em>Spirograph™ </em>toy.</p><p dir="ltr">In this walkthrough, we’ll show that Ada can be fun and easy to learn. Although the language is famous for <a href="https://www.adacore.com/about-ada">safety-critical systems</a>, we will use it as a modern, general-purpose programming language and try out some new features from Ada 2022 along the way.</p><p dir="ltr">Let's dive in!</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>A brief note on Ada</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">This section leans a bit more into background context, with a slightly encyclopedic flavor that's especially useful for readers new to Ada. If you're already familiar with Ada’s history and principles, feel free to joyfully skip ahead to the next section!</p><p dir="ltr">Ada was created in the late 1970s after a call from the U.S. Department of Defense to unify its fragmented software landscape. The winning proposal became Ada, a language that's been literally battle-tested (!) and built on a deeply thought-out design that continues to evolve today.</p><p dir="ltr">While Ada is absolutely a general-purpose programming language, it has carved out a strong niche in fields where software correctness and reliability are mission-critical:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">Embedded and real-time systems</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">Aerospace and defense</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">Rail, automotive, and aviation</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">Any system where failure is not just a bug, but a risk</p></li></ul><p dir="ltr">Its strict compile-time checks, safety features, and clear structure make it particularly appealing when you need your software to be dependable from day one and still maintainable ten years later.</p><p dir="ltr">Ada's design is grounded in a strong and principled philosophy:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr"><strong>Readability over conciseness</strong>: Ada favors clarity. It avoids symbols and abbreviations in favor of full keywords, making the language more accessible and less error-prone.</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr"><strong>Strong and explicit typing</strong>: It is extremely easy to declare new types in Ada, with precise constraints, which makes it much harder to accidentally misuse data. While some functional languages share this strong typing discipline, Ada stands out by requiring the programmer to be very explicit. It uses little to no type inference.</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr"><strong>Explicit is better than implicit</strong>: Unlike many modern languages that prioritize convenience, Ada leans heavily toward precision. Most types must be explicitly named and matched.</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr"><strong>Defined semantics and minimal undefined behavior</strong>: Ada offers a level of predictability and safety unmatched in many languages. This makes it a strong choice not only for safety-critical systems, but also for codebases where long-term maintenance, verifiability, and correctness are essential.</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr"><strong>Compiler as a partner</strong>: Ada compilers are strict by design, not to frustrate, but to help the programmer write clearer, more correct code. This philosophy encourages the developer to communicate intent clearly, both to the compiler and to future readers.</p></li></ul><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>How the program works</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">Sometimes the best way to figure out how something works is to start at the end. Let's do that!<br>In this tutorial, we'll walk through how the program produces its final output — a rosetta SVG file — and use that as a way to explore how Ada's structure, type system, and tooling come together.<br>This is a simple command-line program that generates an SVG file. You run it like this:</p><p dir="ltr">./bin/rosetta</p><p dir="ltr">The idea was to create something visual: learning is more fun when there's an immediate, satisfying result and generating rosettas fits that goal perfectly.</p><p dir="ltr"><br>Why SVG? Because it's a lightweight and portable vector format that you can view in any modern browser. I wanted to avoid relying on a graphical library, which would have added extra weight and gone beyond the scope of this approach. And while XML isn't the most pleasant format to write by hand, generating it from code is straightforward and gives a surprisingly clean result.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Tooling &amp; setup</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">To build and run the project, I used Alire, the Ada package manager. It plays a similar role in the Ada ecosystem as Cargo does for Rust or npm for JavaScript. It's well-documented, and while we won't dive deep into it here, it's a solid and accessible way to manage Ada projects. I encourage anyone curious to get it from <a href="https://alire.ada.dev/">https://alire.ada.dev</a>. Interestingly, "Alire" is also the French expression for "à lire" — which means "for reading." A fitting name for a tool that supports a language so focused on clarity and readability!</p><p dir="ltr">Once Alire is set up, the natural next step is choosing where to write the code. You have two excellent options for your development environment. For a dedicated experience, you can download the latest release of <a href="https://github.com/AdaCore/gnatstudio/releases/">GNAT Studio</a> from its GitHub repository. If you prefer a more general-purpose editor, you can install the official <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AdaCore.ada">Ada &amp; SPARK for Visual Studio Code</a> extension from AdaCore.</p><p dir="ltr">As a new learner, I also kept <a href="https://learn.adacore.com/">https://learn.adacore.com</a> close at hand. It’s a particularly clear and comprehensive resource — and I especially appreciated being able to download the ebook version and read through it on my phone.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Entry point</strong></h2></div><pre><code>with Rosetta_Renderer;

procedure Main is
begin
   Rosetta_Renderer.Put_SVG_Rosettas;
end Main;</code></pre><div><p dir="ltr">There are several interesting things to notice right away:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">The <code>with </code>clause is not a preprocessor directive like in C or C++. It’s a compiled, checked reference to another package — a reliable and explicit way to express a dependency. This eliminates entire classes of bugs related to fragile <code>#include</code> chains, macro collisions, or dependency order issues.</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">This <code>procedure</code> is not a <code>function</code>: it does not return a value. In Ada, procedures are used to perform actions (like printing or modifying state), and functions are used to compute and query values.</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">The syntax is designed for readability. You’ll find <code>begin</code> and <code>end</code> here instead of <var><code>{}</code></var> as in C/C++, reinforcing Ada’s philosophy that clarity matters more than brevity.</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr"><code>Put_SVG_Rosettas</code> uses the idiomatic Pascal_Snake_Case naming style. This reflects a common Ada convention and avoids acronyms or compressed identifiers in favor of more descriptive names.</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">The entry point is minimal but meaningful: it simply calls a procedure which generates the output we'll explore in the next sections.</p></li></ul><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Geometry and computation (package </strong><strong>Rosetta</strong><strong>)</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">In Ada, a <strong>package </strong>is a modular unit that groups related types, procedures, and functions. Following the convention from GNAT (the Ada compiler, part of the GNU Compiler Collection, fondly known as GCC), each package has a <strong>specification file</strong> (with the<code> .ads</code> extension — short for <em>Ada Specification</em>) and an <strong>implementation file</strong> (with the <code>.adb</code> extension — short for <em>Ada Body</em>). This clear and enforced split means you always know where to find interface definitions versus their implementation.</p><p dir="ltr">The following code is the package specification for Rosetta. It defines the data types for the rosetta shapes and declares the public interface of operations available to manipulate them.</p></div><pre><code>with Ada.Strings.Text_Buffers;

package Rosetta is

   --  A mathematical description of a rosetta (specifically, a hypotrochoid).
   --  formed by tracing a point attached to a circle rolling inside another circle.
   type Hypotrochoid is record

      Inner_Radius : Float;     --  Radius of the rolling inner circle.
      Pen_Offset   : Float;     --  From the center of the inner circle to the drawing point.
      Steps        : Positive;  --  Number of steps (points) used to approximate the curve.

   --  Returns a centered array of coordinates.
   function Compute_Points (Curve : Hypotrochoid) return Coordinate_Array;

end Rosetta;</code></pre><div><p dir="ltr">The <code>Rosetta</code> package is responsible for all the math and curve computation. It defines:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr"><code>Hypotrochoid</code>, type describing the geometry of the rosetta</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr"><code>Coordinate</code>, type representing points in 2D space</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr"><code>Coordinate_Array</code>, type holding a series of such points</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr"><code>Compute_Points</code>, function which calculates all the points of the curve based on the <code>Hypotrochoid</code> parameters and recenters them around the origin</p></li></ul><p dir="ltr">This package is focused solely on computation. It doesn’t concern itself with how the result is rendered.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Fun fact for the curious: when the rolling circle rolls </em><strong><em>outside</em></strong><em> the fixed circle rather than inside, the resulting curve is called an epitrochoid.</em></p><p dir="ltr">In Ada, a <code>record</code> is similar to a <code>struct</code> in C or a class with only data members in other languages. It's a user-defined type composed of named components, making it ideal for modeling structured data.</p><p dir="ltr">Using a record for <code>Hypotrochoid</code> was particularly appropriate: it allows grouping all geometric parameters (outer radius, inner radius, pen offset, and steps) into a single, cohesive unit. This improves readability and maintainability. The compiler enforces correctness by ensuring all required values are present and of the expected type — reinforcing Ada’s philosophy of clarity and safety.</p><p dir="ltr">The type <code>Coordinate_Array</code> is an unconstrained array type that holds a range of <code>Coordinate</code> records. In this context, ‘unconstrained’ simply means that we don’t define the array’s size when we declare the type. Instead, the size is defined when we declare an object of that type. This gives us the flexibility to use this type for a variety of shapes.</p><p dir="ltr">You may also notice the use of <code>Natural range &lt;&gt;. Natural</code> is a predefined subtype of Integer that only allows non-negative values. And yes, I mean subtype: Ada’s powerful type system allows you to take an existing type and create a more specific, constrained version of it.</p><h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Highlights from the .adb file</strong></h3><p dir="ltr">Here are a few notable aspects from the implementation (<code>rosetta.adb</code>) that illustrate Ada’s strengths for writing safe, clear, and structured code:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr"><strong>Declarative and modular design</strong>: Both <code>Generate_Point </code>and <code>Compute_Points</code> are pure functions that operate only on their inputs. Their behavior is fully deterministic and encapsulated.</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr"><strong>Safe bounds and array handling</strong>: The <code>Points</code> array is statically bounded using <code>(0 .. Curve.Steps)</code>, and its access is strictly safe. The compiler ensures that any index outside this range would raise an error at runtime. This immediate error is a feature, not a bug. It stops silent memory corruption and security flaws by ensuring the program fails predictably and safely at the source of the problem.</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr"><strong>Use of constants for robustness</strong>: Variables such as <code>Pi</code>, <code>R_Diff</code>, and Ratio are declared as constant, enforcing immutability. This helps ensure clarity of intent and prevents accidental reassignment, a common source of subtle bugs in more permissive languages. Ada encourages this explicit declaration style, promoting safer code.</p></li></ul></div><pre><code>with Ada.Numerics;

With the compiler switch <a href="https://docs.adacore.com/gnat_ugn-docs/html/gnat_ugn/gnat_ugn/building_executable_programs_with_gnat.html#style-checking">-gnaty</a>, you can enforce a comprehensive set of style rules, many of which are stricter than what you'd see in most languages.</p><p dir="ltr">This includes things like:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">No trailing whitespace at the end of lines</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">No consecutive blank lines</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">Proper indentation and alignment of keywords and parameters</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">A space before “(“ when calling a procedure or function</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">Consistent casing</p></li></ul><p dir="ltr">At first, this can feel surprisingly strict. But once you get used to it, the benefits are clear: it helps enforce a consistent and clean coding style across a codebase. That in turn improves readability, reduces ambiguity, and leads to more maintainable programs.</p><p dir="ltr">Rather than leaving formatting up to personal taste or optional linter tools, Ada integrates this attention to detail into the compilation process itself. The result is not only more elegant: it's genuinely satisfying. And you can do even more with GNATcheck and GNATformat but it’s outside of the scope of this post.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Outputting to SVG (package </strong><strong><code>Rosetta_Renderer</code></strong><strong>)</strong></p><p dir="ltr">The Rosetta_Renderer package is responsible for producing the SVG output. It defines a single high-level procedure:<br></p></div><pre><code>package Rosetta_Renderer is

   --  Renders a predefined set of rosettas into an SVG output.
   procedure Put_SVG_Rosettas;

end Rosetta_Renderer;</code></pre><div><p dir="ltr">This procedure generates an SVG file directly. It takes care of formatting the SVG structure (header, shapes, animations, and footer) and calls into the math logic defined in the <code>Rosetta </code>package to generate point data.</p><p dir="ltr">This separation of concerns is deliberate and beneficial: the math logic doesn’t need to know anything about SVG, and the renderer doesn’t care how the coordinates were generated.</p><p dir="ltr">Now let's talk about the body of the package... but not for long. We're keeping it brief because its core is essentially the SVG plumbing required to draw and animate the curves, so we'll skip the fine details. And for those who enjoy seeing how the sausage is made, I've made the fully commented source code available for you <a href="https://github.com/romain-at-adacore/rosettas">right here</a>.</p><p><br>The procedure <code>Put_Path</code> handles the creation of the SVG path. Its main job is to take an array of coordinates and write the corresponding command string to the <code><strong>d</strong> </code>attribute of a<code> &lt;path&gt;</code> element. In SVG, this attribute defines the geometry of the shape. The code iterates over each coordinate, using <code>M </code>(moveto) for the first point and <code>L</code> (lineto) for all the others to draw the connecting lines.</p></div><pre><code>--  Puts coordinates to a single SVG path string ("d" attribute).
   procedure Put_Path (Stream : File_Type; Points : Coordinate_Array) is
   begin
      Put (Stream, "M "); -- Moves the pen without drawing.
      for J in Points'Range loop

            if J &lt; Points'Last then
               Put (Stream, " L "); --  Draws a line.
            end if;
         end;
      end loop;
   end Put_Path;</code></pre><div><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Afterword</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">This small project was an enjoyable and useful way to get back into Ada. It helped me reconnect with the language’s main strengths and refamiliarize myself with its tools and design. It was a great reminder of how fun, easy to learn, and remarkably modern Ada can be, especially for developers focused on building robust, maintainable, and efficient software.</p><p dir="ltr">I hope this short walkthrough gives a good idea of that feeling, whether you're already into Ada or just starting to explore it.</p></div></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Microsoft, the latest tech firm to agree to big software discounts for the US government, is digging even deeper into its bargain bin than the competition by offering a year of free Copilot access to government agencies willing to put up with its other problem products.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The General Services Administration (GSA) <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/newsroom/news-releases/multibillion-dollar-gsa-onegov-agreement-with-microsoft-brings-steep-discounts-09022025" rel="nofollow">announced</a> its new deal with Microsoft on Tuesday, describing it as a "strategic partnership" that could save the federal government as much as $3.1 billion over the next year. The GSA didn't mention specific discount terms, but it said that services, including Microsoft 365, Azure cloud services, Dynamics 365, Entra ID Governance, and Microsoft Sentinel, will be cheaper than ever for feds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That, and Microsoft's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/04/18/microsoft_copilot_not_wanted/">next-gen Clippy</a>, also known as Copilot, is free to access for any agency with a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/government-plans-and-pricing" rel="nofollow">G5 contract</a> as part of the new deal, too. That free price undercuts Google's previously <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/21/google_govt_discount_ai/">cheapest-in-show</a> deal to inject Gemini into government agencies for just $0.47 for a year.</p>

    

<p>The GSA made this Microsoft deal as part of its <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/newsroom/news-releases/gsa-unveils-onegov-strategy-04292025" rel="nofollow">OneGov</a> initiative, which seeks to centralize purchasing of products and services used across the government under a single contract. While the agency intends for OneGov to extend across the federal government, the first phase of the program focuses exclusively on IT contracts.&nbsp;</p>

        


        

<p>Though it only announced OneGov in April, the GSA has awarded contracts under the plan at a rapid pace, with Oracle the first firm to sign a deal in July. That agreement includes a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/07/08/gsa_oracle_deal/">75 percent discount</a> on its products to government agencies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The agency wrote many of the other OneGov contracts to get AI products into the hands of government agencies. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/06/google_openai_anthropic_us_gov_ai_deal/">OpenAI</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/12/gsa_inks_another_1dollar_onegov_deal/">Anthropic</a> both made deals with the GSA in August to provide a year of their services to agencies for $1 each, which Google undercut later last month.</p>

        

<p>Even <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/13/boxs_ai_agent_us_gov/">Box made an AI discount deal</a> with the federal government, though it didn't disclose pricing. Outside of AI offerings, Amazon Web Services inked its own OneGov deal with the GSA to offer <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/07/gsa_signs_1b_deal_with_aws/">discounted cloud services</a> through 2028.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the exception of AWS, all the other OneGov deals that have been announced so far have a very short shelf life, with most expirations at the end of 2026. Critics of the OneGov program have raised concerns that OneGov deals have set government agencies up for a new era of vendor lock-in not seen since the early cloud days, where one-year discounts leave agencies dependent on services that could suddenly become considerably more expensive by the end of next year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nicholas Chaillan, former US Air Force and Space Force chief software officer and founder of AI firm Ask Sage, told <em>The Register</em> in a recent conversation that he's protested the OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google deals, accusing the GSA of undermining its own rules on fair and open competition for government-wide contracts.&nbsp;</p>

        

<p>"Pricing this low is not about serving agencies – it's about forcing dependence on a single vendor, hiding future costs, and squeezing out fair competition," Chaillan told us in an email. "What looks cheap today will leave the government with higher costs, fewer options, and greater risk tomorrow."</p>
<p>Chillain told us that GSA hasn't made the OneGov contracts public so they could be scrutinized for any unfair elements. We've tried obtaining copies but the GSA hasn't acknowledged those requests. As with the other OneGov contracts, what happens to the discounts after the September 2026 end of the offering isn't clear.</p>
<p>The GSA's press release mentioned that discounted pricing will be available for "certain products" for up to 36 months, but the terms of those discounts or the specific products available weren't mentioned.&nbsp;Microsoft's <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2025/09/02/accelerating-ai-adoption-for-the-us-government/">announcement</a> of its new OneGov deal said those extended discounts will save the government as much as $6 billion over three years.</p>
<p>The GSA didn't respond to questions for this story.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Microsoft gets rewarded for security failures – again</h3>
<p>Like other tech giants making OneGov deals, Microsoft will likely have to burn some capital to reap the monetary rewards from government agencies who grow dependent on its cheap or free software in the next year. Unlike those other tech giants making OneGov deals, however, Microsoft is yet again being rewarded by the US government with a pathway to profit after making a massive national security mistake.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was mere days ago that we reported on the Pentagon's decision to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/29/pentagon_ends_microsofts_use_of/">formally bar</a> Microsoft from using <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/07/28/microsoft_china_staffers_us_govt_cloud/">China-based engineers</a> to support sensitive cloud services deployed by the Defense Department, a practice Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth called "mind-blowing" in a statement last week.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then there was last year's episodes that allowed <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/04/03/cisa_microsoft_exchange_online_china_report/">Chinese</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/04/12/microsoft_cisa_order/">Russian</a> cyber spies to break into Exchange accounts used by high-level federal officials and steal a whole bunch of emails and other information. That incident, and plenty more before it, led former senior White House cyber policy director AJ Grotto to conclude that Microsoft was an honest-to-goodness <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/04/21/microsoft_national_security_risk/">national security threat</a>. None of that has mattered much, as the feds seem content to continue paying Microsoft for its services, despite wagging their finger at Redmond for "<a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/04/05/microsoft_government_contracts/">avoidable errors</a>."&nbsp;</p>

<p>When it comes to government customers, using China-based support staff isn't Microsoft's only sin. The company had a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/07/21/massive_security_snafu_microsoft/">Sharepoint zero-day</a> that it only "partially" addressed with July security updates. Suspected state-backed hackers used that vuln to target an unspecified "major western government," per the company.</p>
<p>That, senior cybersecurity and counterterrorism advisor for the Clinton and Bush II administrations Roger Cressey <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/08/exwhite_house_cyber_and_counterterrorism/">told us</a> last month, is among the reasons he considers Microsoft to be a continual gift to America's foreign adversaries, as the Sharepoint issue is just "the latest episode of a decades-long process of Microsoft not taking security seriously."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"The Chinese are so well prepared and positioned on Microsoft products that in the event of hostilities, we know for a fact that Chinese actors will target our critical infrastructure through Microsoft," Cressey told us in an interview last month.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When asked what it had done to improve its security posture, Microsoft declined to answer any of our questions directly, instead pointing us to its press release about today's GSA deal, specifically its section on security.</p>
<p>Agencies are safe to adopt Microsoft software, the company said, because "these services have already achieved key FedRAMP security and compliance authorizations." FedRAMP is the government's security approval process for cloud software.</p>
<p>"Microsoft 365, Azure and our key AI services are authorized at FedRAMP High," the company statement says. "Microsoft 365 Copilot received provisional authorization from the US Department of Defense, with FedRAMP High expected soon."</p>
<p>That's not exactly reassuring considering Microsoft's products have <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/products/MSO365MT">variously</a> been <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/products/FR1824057433">authorized</a> for government use <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/products/F1209051525">for</a> <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/products/F1603087869">years</a>, well before many of its recent security failings that affected federal agencies. ®</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://tonybaloney.github.io/posts/why-isnt-python-async-more-popular.html">https://tonybaloney.github.io/posts/why-isnt-python-async-more-popular.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45106189">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfH4QL4VqJ0&amp;pp=ygUScHl0aG9uIGRvY3VtZW50YXJ5">Python Documentary</a> dropped this morning. In the middle of the documentary, there’s a dramatic segment about how the transition from Python 2 to 3 divided the community (spoiler alert: <a href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/pycharm/2025/08/the-state-of-python-2025/#most-still-use-older-python-versions-despite-benefits-of-newer-releases">it didn’t in the end</a>).</p>
<p>The early versions of Python 3 (3.0-3.4) were mostly focused on stability and offering pathways for users moving from 2.7. Along came 3.5 in 2015 with a new feature: <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0492/"><code>async</code> and <code>await</code> keywords for executing coroutines</a>.</p>
<p>Ten years and nine releases later, Python 3.14 is <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0745/">weeks away</a>.</p>
<p>Whilst everyone will be distracted by the shiny, colorful REPL features in 3.14, there are some big announcements nestled in the release notes — both related to concurrency and parallelism</p>
<p><img alt="Colorful REPL" src="https://tonybaloney.github.io/img/posts/colorful-repl.png"></p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#pep-779-free-threaded-python-is-officially-supported">PEP779 Free-Threading is Officially Supported</a>. </li>
<li><a href="https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#pep-734-multiple-interpreters-in-the-stdlib">PEP 734: Multiple interpreters in the stdlib</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Both of these features are huge advancements in how Python can be used to execute concurrent code. But if <code>async</code> has been here for 10 years, why do we need them?</p>
<p>The killer use-case for async is web development. Coroutines lend well to out-of-process network calls, like HTTP requests and database queries. Why block the entire Python interpreter waiting for a SQL query to run on another server?</p>
<p>Yet, among the three most popular Python web frameworks, async support is still not universal. FastAPI is async from the ground-up, Django has some support, but is <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/topics/async/"><strong>“still working on async support”</strong></a> in key areas like the ORM (database). Then Flask is and probably always will be synchronous (Quart is an async alternative with similar APIs). The most popular ORM for Python, SQLAlchemy, only added asyncio support in 2023 (<a href="https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/changelog/migration_14.html#change-3414">changelog</a>).</p>
<p>I posed the question <em>“Why isn’t async more popular”</em> to a couple of other developers to get their thoughts.</p>
<p><a href="https://realpython.com/team/ctrudeau/">Christopher Trudeau</a>, co-host of the <a href="https://realpython.com/podcasts/rpp/">Real Python Podcast</a>, shared his perspective:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Certain kinds of errors get caught by the compiler, others just disappear. Why didn’t that function run? Oops, forgot to await it. Error in the coroutine? Did you remember to launch with the right params, if not, it doesn’t percolate up. I still find threads easier to wrap my head around.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://talkpython.fm/">Michael Kennedy</a> offered some additional insight:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The [GIL] is so omnipresent that most Python people never developed multithreaded/async thinking. Because async/await only works for I/O bound work, not CPU as well, it’s of much less use. E.g. You can use in on the web, but most servers fork out to 4-8 web workers anyway</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So <strong>what’s going on here</strong> and <strong>can we apply the lessons to Free-Threading and Multiple Interpreters in 3.14</strong> so that in another ten years we’re looking back and wondering why <strong>they</strong> aren’t more popular?</p>
<h2 id="problem-1-what-is-an-asynchronous-shaped-problem">Problem 1: What is an asynchronous-shaped problem?<a href="#problem-1-what-is-an-asynchronous-shaped-problem" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p><em>Coroutines</em> are most valuable with IO-related tasks. In Python, you can start hundreds of coroutines to make network requests, then wait for them all to finish without running them one at a time. The concepts behind coroutines are quite straightforward. You have a loop (the event loop) and you pass it coroutines to evaluate.</p>
<p>Let’s go back to the classic use-case, HTTP requests:</p>
<pre><code>def get_thing_sync():
    return http_client.get('/thing/which_takes?ages=1')
</code></pre>

<p>The equivalent async function is clean and readable:</p>
<pre><code>async def get_thing_async():
    return await http_client.get('/thing/which_takes?ages=1')
</code></pre>

<p>If you call function <code>get_thing_sync()</code> versus <code>await get_thing_async()</code>, they take <strong>the same amount of time</strong>. Calling it <em>“✨ asynchronously ✨”</em> does not somehow make it faster. The gains are when you have more than one coroutine running at once. </p>
<p>When fetching multiple HTTP resources you can start all the requests at once via the OS network stack, then handle each response as it arrives. The important point is that the actual work — sending packets and waiting for remote servers — happens outside your Python process while your code waits. Async is most effective here: you start operations, receive awaitable handles (tasks/futures), and the event loop efficiently notifies the coroutine when each operation completes without wasting CPU on busy‑polling.</p>
<p>This scenario works well because:</p>
<ol>
<li>The remote end is handling the work in another process</li>
<li>The local end (asyncio HTTP library) can yield control while waiting for the response</li>
<li>Operating-Systems have stacks and APIs for managing sockets and network</li>
</ol>
<p>That’s all fine, but I started with the statement <strong><em>Coroutines</em> are most valuable with IO-related tasks.</strong> I then picked the one task that asyncio can handle really well, HTTP requests.</p>
<p>What about disk IO? I have <strong>far</strong> more applications in Python which read and write from files on disks or memory than I do making HTTP requests. I also have Python programs which run other programs using <code>subprocess</code>.</p>
<p>Can I make all of those <code>async</code>?  </p>
<p>No, not really. From the <a href="https://github.com/python/asyncio/wiki/ThirdParty#filesystem">asyncio Wiki</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>asyncio does not support asynchronous operations on the filesystem. Even if files are opened with O_NONBLOCK, read and write will block.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The solution is to use a third-party package, <code>aiofiles</code>, which gives you async file I/O capabilities:</p>
<pre><code>async with aiofiles.open('filename', mode='r') as f:
    contents = await f.read()
</code></pre>

<p>So, mission accomplished? No because <code>aiofiles</code> uses a <strong>thread pool</strong> to offload the blocking file I/O operations. </p>
<h3 id="side-quest-why-isnt-file-io-async">Side-Quest: Why isn’t file IO async?<a href="#side-quest-why-isnt-file-io-async" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Windows has an async file IO API called <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/ioringapi/">IoRing</a>. Linux has this availability in newer Kernels via <a href="https://kernel.dk/io_uring.pdf"><code>io_uring</code></a>. All I could find for a Python implementation of <code>io_uring</code> is this <a href="https://github.com/YoSTEALTH/Liburing">synchronous API written in Cython</a>.</p>
<p>There were io_uring APIs for other platforms, Rust has implementations with <a href="https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio-uring">tokio</a>, C++ has <a href="https://think-async.com/Asio/asio-1.24.0/doc/asio/history.html#asio.history.asio_1_21_0">Asio</a> and Node.JS has <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/libuv-io-uring">libuv</a>.</p>
<p>So, the asyncio Wiki is a little out of date, but</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Most</strong> production Python applications run on Linux, where the implementation is <code>io_uring</code></li>
<li><code>io_uring</code> has been plagued by security issues so bad that RedHat, Google and others have restricted or removed its availability. After paying out $1 million in bug bounties related to <code>io_uring</code>, <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2023/06/learnings-from-kctf-vrps-42-linux.html">Google disabled it on some products</a>. The issue was severe; many of the related bug‑bounty reports involved io_uring exploits.</li>
</ol>
<p>So we should hold our horses a little while longer. Operating Systems have long held a file IO API that handles threads for concurrent IO. It does the job just fine for now.</p>
<p>So in summary, <em>Coroutines are most valuable with IO-related tasks</em> is only really true for <strong>network I/O</strong> and network sockets in Python were never blocking operations in the first place. Socket open in Python is one of the few operations which releases the GIL and works <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/v3.14.0rc2/Modules/socketmodule.c#L939-L1085">concurrently in a thread pool</a> as a non-blocking operation.</p>

<p><a href="https://willmcgugan.github.io/">Will McGugan</a>, the creator of Rich, Textualize, and several other extremely popular Python libraries offered his perspective on async:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I really enjoy async programming, but it isn’t intuitive for most devs that don’t have a background writing network code. A reoccurring problem I see with Textual is folk testing concurrency by dropping in a <code>time.sleep(10)</code> call to simulate the work they are planning. <strong>Of course, that blocks the entire loop.</strong> But that’s a class of issue which is difficult to explain to devs who haven’t used async much. i.e. what does it mean for code to “block”, and when is it necessary to defer to threads. <strong>Without that grounding in the fundamentals, your async code is going to misbehave,</strong> but its not going to break per se. So devs don’t get the rapid iteration and feedback that we expect from Python.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now that we’ve covered the limited use cases for async, another challenge keeps coming up. The Python GIL.</p>
<p>I’ve been working on this C#/Python bridge project called <a href="https://tonybaloney.github.io/CSnakes">CSnakes</a>, one of the features that caused the most head-scratching was <a href="https://tonybaloney.github.io/CSnakes/v1/user-guide/async/">async</a>.</p>
<p>C#, the language from which the <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0492/#why-async-and-await-keywords"><code>async</code>/<code>await</code> syntax was borrowed</a>, has far broader async support in its core I/O libraries because it implements a Task‑based Asynchronous Pattern (TAP), where tasks are dispatched onto a managed thread pool. Disk, network, and memory I/O operations commonly provide both async and sync methods.</p>
<p>In fact, the C# implementation goes all the way up from the disk to the higher-level APIs, such as serialization libraries. <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.text.json.jsonserializer.deserializeasync?view=net-9.0#system-text-json-jsonserializer-deserializeasync(system-io-stream-system-type-system-text-json-serialization-jsonserializercontext-system-threading-cancellationtoken)">JSON deserialization is async</a>, so is XML. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/parallel-programming/task-based-asynchronous-programming">C# Async model</a> and the Python Async models have some important differences:</p>
<ul>
<li>C# creates a task pool and tasks are scheduled on this pool. The number of threads is managed automatically by the runtime.</li>
<li>Python event loops belong to the thread that created them. C# tasks can be scheduled on any thread.</li>
<li>Python async functions are coroutines that are scheduled on the event loop. C# async functions are tasks that are scheduled on the task pool.</li>
</ul>
<p>The benefit of C#’s model is that a <code>Task</code> is a higher-level abstraction over a thread or coroutine. This means that you don’t have to worry about the underlying thread management, you can schedule several tasks to be awaited concurrently or you can run them in parallel with Task Parallel Library (TPL).</p>
<p>In Python “An event loop runs in a thread (typically the main thread) and executes all callbacks and Tasks in its thread. While a Task is running in the event loop, no other Tasks can run in the same thread. When a Task executes an await expression, the running Task gets suspended, and the event loop executes the next Task.” <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-dev.html#asyncio-multithreading">1</a></p>
<p>Going back to Will’s comment <strong>“Of course, that blocks the entire loop”</strong>, he’s talking about operations inside async functions which are blocking and therefore block the entire event loop. Since we covered in Problem 1, that’s practically everything except network calls and sleeping. </p>
<p>With Python’s GIL, it doesn’t matter if you’re running 1 thread or 10, the GIL will lock everything so that only 1 is operating at a time.</p>
<p><img alt="Breakdancing meme" src="https://tonybaloney.github.io/img/posts/breakdance.gif"></p>
<p>There are some operations don’t block the GIL (e.g. File IO) and in those cases you can run them in threads. For example, if you used <code>httpx</code>‘s streaming feature to stream a large network download onto disk:</p>
<pre><code>import httpx
import tempfile

def download_file(url: str):
    with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(delete=False) as tmp_file:
        with httpx.stream("GET", url) as response:
            for chunk in response.iter_bytes():
                tmp_file.write(chunk)
    return tmp_file.name
</code></pre>

<p>Neither the <code>httpx</code> stream iterator nor <code>tmp_file.write</code> is GIL-blocking, so they benefit from running in separate threads.</p>
<p>We can merge this behavior with an asyncio API, by using the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-eventloop.html#executing-code-in-thread-or-process-pools">Event Loop <code>run_in_executor()</code> function</a> and passing it a thread pool:</p>
<pre><code>import asyncio
import concurrent.futures

async def main():
    loop = asyncio.get_running_loop()

    URLS = [
        "https://example.place/big-file-1",
        "https://example.place/big-file-2",
        "https://example.place/big-file-3",
        # etc.
    ]

    tasks = set()
    with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=10) as pool:
        for url in URLS:
            tasks.add(loop.run_in_executor(pool, download_file, url))
        files = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    print(files)
</code></pre>

<p>It’s not immediately clear to me what the benefit of this is over running a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html#concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor">thread-pool and calling <code>pool.submit</code></a>. We retain an async API, so if that is important this is an interesting workaround. </p>
<p>I find that memorizing, documenting, and explaining what is and isn’t “blocking” in Python to be confusing and continually changing.</p>
<h3 id="does-the-free-threaded-mode-make-asyncio-more-useful-or-redundant">Does the free-threaded mode make asyncio more useful or redundant?<a href="#does-the-free-threaded-mode-make-asyncio-more-useful-or-redundant" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Python 3.13 introduced a very-unstable “free-threaded” build of Python where the GIL is removed and replaced with smaller, more granular locks. See my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mp5wKOL4L2Q">PyCon US 2024 Talk</a> for a summary of parallelism.
The 3.13 build wasn’t stable enough for any production use. 3.14 is looking far improved and I think we can start to introduce free-threading in 2026 in some narrow, well-tested scenarios.</p>
<p>One major benefit to coroutines versus threads is that they have a far smaller memory footprint, a lower context-switching overhead, and faster startup times. async APIs are also easier to reason about and compose.</p>
<p>Because parallelism in Python using threads has always been so limited, the APIs in the standard library are quite rudimentary. I think there is an opportunity to have a task-parallelism API in the standard library once free-threading is stabilized. </p>
<p>Last week I was implementing a registry function that did two discrete tasks. One calls a very slow sync-only API and the other calls several async APIs. </p>
<p>I want the behavior that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Both are started at the same time</li>
<li>If one fails, it cancels the other and raises an exception with the exception details of the failed function</li>
<li>The result is only combined when both are complete</li>
</ul>
<pre>flowchart LR
  Start([Start]) --&gt; Invoke["tpl.invoke()"]
  Invoke --&gt; f1["f1()"]
  Invoke --&gt; f2["f2()"]
  f1 --&gt;|f1 -&gt; T1| Join["Tuple[T1, T2]"]
  f2 --&gt;|f2 -&gt; T2| Join
  Join --&gt; End([End])
</pre>

<p>Since there are only two tasks, I don’t want to have to define a thread-pool or a set number of workers. I also don’t want to have to map or gather the callees. I want to retain my typing information so that the resulting variables are strongly typed from the return types of <code>function_a</code> and <code>function_a</code>. Essentially an API like this:</p>
<pre><code>import tpl


def function_a() -&gt; T1:
    ...

def function_b() -&gt; T2:
    ...

result_a: T1, result_b: T2 = tpl.invoke(function_a, function_b)
</code></pre>

<p>This is all <em>possible</em> today but there are many constraints with the GIL. Free-threading will make parallel programming more popular in Python and we’ll have to revisit some of the APIs.</p>
<h2 id="problem-3-maintaining-two-apis-is-hard">Problem 3: Maintaining two APIs is hard<a href="#problem-3-maintaining-two-apis-is-hard" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>As a package maintainer, supporting both synchronous and asynchronous APIs is a big challenge. You also have to be selective with where you support async. Much of the stdlib doesn’t support async natively (e.g. logging backends).</p>
<p>Python’s <strong>Magic</strong> (<code>__dunder__</code>) methods cannot be async. <code>__init__</code> cannot be async for example, so none of your code can use network requests in the initializer.</p>
<h3 id="async-properties">Async properties<a href="#async-properties" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>This is an odd-pattern but I’ll keep it simple to illustrate my point. You have a class <code>User</code> with a property <code>records</code>. This property gives a list of records for that user. A synchronous API is straightforward:</p>
<pre><code>class User:
    @property
    def records(self) -&gt; list[RecordT]:
        # fetch records from database lazily
        ...
</code></pre>

<p>We can even use a lazily-initialized instance variable to cache this data.</p>
<p>Porting this API to async is a challenge because whilst <code>@property</code> methods can be async, standard attributes are not. Having to <code>await</code> some instance attributes and not others leaves a very odd API:</p>
<pre><code>class AsyncDatabase:
    @staticmethod
    async def fetch_many(id: str, of: Type[RecordT]) -&gt; list[RecordT]:
        ...

class User:
    @property
    async def records(self) -&gt; list[RecordT]:
        # fetch records from database lazily
        return await AsyncDatabase.fetch_many(self.id, RecordT)
</code></pre>

<p>Anytime you access that property, it needs to be awaited:</p>
<pre><code>user = User(...)
# single access
await user.records
# if
if await user.records:
    ...
# comprehension?
[record async for record in user.records]
</code></pre>

<p><a href="https://tryexceptpass.org/article/controlling-python-async-creep/">The further we go into this implementation</a>, the more we wait for the user to accidentally forget to await the property and it fails silently.</p>
<h3 id="duplicated-implementations">Duplicated implementations<a href="#duplicated-implementations" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>The Azure Python SDK, a ginormous Python project supports both sync and async. Maintaining both is achieved via a lot of code-generation infrastructure. This is ok for a project with tens of full-time engineers, but for anything small or voluntary you need to copy + paste a lot of your code base to create an async version. Then you need to patch and backport fixes and changes between the two. The differences (mostly <code>await</code> calls) are big enough to confuse Git. I was reviewing some langchain implementations last year which had both sync and async implementation. Every method was copied+pasted, with little behavioral differences and their own bugs. People would submit bug fix PR’s to one implementation and not the other so instead of merging directly, maintainers had to port the fix, skip it, or ask the contributors to do both.</p>
<h3 id="backend-fragmentation">Backend fragmentation<a href="#backend-fragmentation" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Since we’re largely talking about HTTP/Network IO, you also need to pick a backend for sync and async. For synchronous HTTP calls, <code>requests</code>, <code>httpx</code> are suitable backends. For <code>async</code>, its <code>aiohttp</code> and <code>httpx</code>. Since neither are part of the Python standard library, the adoption and support for CPython’s main platforms is out of sync. E.g. as of today, <code>aiohttp</code> has <a href="https://pypi.org/project/aiohttp/#files">no Python 3.14 wheels, nor free-threaded support</a>. UV Loop, the alternative implementation of the event loop has <a href="https://pypi.org/project/uvloop/#files">no Python 3.14 support, nor any Windows support.</a> (Python 3.14 isn’t out yet, so it’s reasonable to not have support in either open-source project).</p>
<h3 id="testing-overhead">Testing overhead<a href="#testing-overhead" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Further down the copy+paste maintainer overhead is the testing of these APIs. Testing your async code requires different mocks, different calls and in the case of Pytest a whole set of extensions and patterns for fixtures. This situation is so <a href="https://tonybaloney.github.io/posts/async-test-patterns-for-pytest-and-unittest.html">confusing I wrote a post about it and it’s one of the most popular on my blog</a>.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary<a href="#summary" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>In summary, I think the use cases for asyncio are limited (mostly for reasons beyond the control of <code>asyncio</code>) and this has constrained it’s popularity. Maintaining duplicate code-bases is a burden.</p>
<p>FastAPI, the web framework that’s <a href="https://www.starlette.io/">async from-the-ground-up</a> grew in <a href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/pycharm/2025/08/the-state-of-python-2025/#python-web-devs-resurgence">popularity again</a> from 29% to 38% share of the web frameworks for Python, taking the #1 spot. It has over 100-million downloads a month. Considering the big use-case for async is HTTP and network IO, having the #1 web framework be an async one is a sign of asyncio’s success. </p>
<p>I think in 3.14 the sub-interpreter executor and free-threading features make more parallel and concurrency use cases practical and useful. For those, we don’t need <code>async</code> APIs and it alleviates much of the issues I highlighted in this post.</p>

The HTML parser creates a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ShadowRoot"><code>ShadowRoot</code></a> object in the DOM for the first <code>&lt;template&gt;</code> in a node with this attribute set to an allowed value.
If the attribute is not set, or not set to an allowed value — or if a <code>ShadowRoot</code> has already been declaratively created in the same parent — then an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLTemplateElement"><code>HTMLTemplateElement</code></a> is constructed.
A <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLTemplateElement"><code>HTMLTemplateElement</code></a> cannot subsequently be changed into a shadow root after parsing, for example, by setting <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLTemplateElement/shadowRootMode"><code>HTMLTemplateElement.shadowRootMode</code></a>.</p>

    <!--lit-part MoEjnFdv3ms=--><p>This element has no permitted content, because everything nested inside it in the HTML source does not actually become the children of the <code>&lt;template&gt;</code> element. The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/childNodes"><code>Node.childNodes</code></a> property of the <code>&lt;template&gt;</code> element is always empty, and you can only access said nested content via the special <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLTemplateElement/content" title="content"><code>content</code></a> property. However, if you call <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/appendChild"><code>Node.appendChild()</code></a> or similar methods on the <code>&lt;template&gt;</code> element, then you would be inserting children into the <code>&lt;template&gt;</code> element itself, which is a violation of its content model and does not actually update the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DocumentFragment"><code>DocumentFragment</code></a> returned by the <code>content</code> property.</p>
<p>Due to the way the <code>&lt;template&gt;</code> element is parsed, all <code>&lt;html&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> opening and closing tags inside the template are syntax errors and are ignored by the parser, so <code>&lt;template&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Test&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;/template&gt;</code> is the same as <code>&lt;template&gt;&lt;title&gt;Test&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/template&gt;</code>.</p>

The corresponding <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLTemplateElement"><code>HTMLTemplateElement</code></a> interface includes a standard <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLTemplateElement/content" title="content"><code>content</code></a> property (without an equivalent content/markup attribute). This <code>content</code> property is read-only and holds a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DocumentFragment"><code>DocumentFragment</code></a> that contains the DOM subtree represented by the template.
This fragment can be cloned via the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/cloneNode" title="cloneNode"><code>cloneNode</code></a> method and inserted into the DOM.</p>

    <!--lit-part WmDtqwHgQaY=--><p>If the <code>&lt;template&gt;</code> element contains the <a href="#shadowrootmode"><code>shadowrootmode</code></a> attribute with a value of either <code>open</code> or <code>closed</code>, the HTML parser will immediately generate a shadow DOM. The element is replaced in the DOM by its content wrapped in a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ShadowRoot"><code>ShadowRoot</code></a>, which is attached to the parent element.
This is the declarative equivalent of calling <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/attachShadow"><code>Element.attachShadow()</code></a> to attach a shadow root to an element.</p>
<p>If the element has any other value for <code>shadowrootmode</code>, or does not have the <code>shadowrootmode</code> attribute, the parser generates a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLTemplateElement"><code>HTMLTemplateElement</code></a>.
Similarly, if there are multiple declarative shadow roots, only the first one is replaced by a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ShadowRoot"><code>ShadowRoot</code></a> — subsequent instances are parsed as <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLTemplateElement"><code>HTMLTemplateElement</code></a> objects.</p><!--/lit-part-->

    <!--lit-part qZm1PKvdIt0=--><p>First we start with the HTML portion of the example.</p>
<div><pre><code>&lt;table id="producttable"&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;UPC_Code&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Product_Name&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;!-- existing data could optionally be included here --&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;template id="productrow"&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td class="record"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/template&gt;
</code></pre></div>
<p>First, we have a table into which we will later insert content using JavaScript code. Then comes the template, which describes the structure of an HTML fragment representing a single table row.</p>
<p>Now that the table has been created and the template defined, we use JavaScript to insert rows into the table, with each row being constructed using the template as its basis.</p>
<div><pre><code>// Test to see if the browser supports the HTML template element by checking
// for the presence of the template element's content attribute.
if ("content" in document.createElement("template")) {
  // Instantiate the table with the existing HTML tbody
  // and the row with the template
  const tbody = document.querySelector("tbody");
  const template = document.querySelector("#productrow");

  // Clone the new row and insert it into the table
  const clone = template.content.cloneNode(true);
  let td = clone.querySelectorAll("td");
  td[0].textContent = "1235646565";
  td[1].textContent = "Stuff";

  tbody.appendChild(clone);

  // Clone the new row and insert it into the table
  const clone2 = template.content.cloneNode(true);
  td = clone2.querySelectorAll("td");
  td[0].textContent = "0384928528";
  td[1].textContent = "Acme Kidney Beans 2";

  tbody.appendChild(clone2);
} else {
  // Find another way to add the rows to the table because
  // the HTML template element is not supported.
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>The result is the original HTML table, with two new rows appended to it via JavaScript:</p>
<div><pre><code>table {
  background: black;
}
table td {
  background: white;
}
</code></pre></div>

    <!--lit-part ZbWeUcgRZb4=--><p>This example demonstrates how <code>shadowrootdelegatesfocus</code> is applied to a shadow root that is created declaratively, and the effect this has on focus.</p>
<p>The code first declares a shadow root inside a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element, using the <code>&lt;template&gt;</code> element with the <code>shadowrootmode</code> attribute.
This displays both a non-focusable <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> containing text and a focusable <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> element.
It also uses CSS to style elements with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:focus"><code>:focus</code></a> to blue, and to set the normal styling of the host element.</p>
<div><pre><code>&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;template shadowrootmode="open"&gt;
    &lt;style&gt;
      :host {
        display: block;
        border: 1px dotted black;
        padding: 10px;
        margin: 10px;
      }
      :focus {
        outline: 2px solid blue;
      }
    &lt;/style&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;Clickable Shadow DOM text&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;input type="text" placeholder="Input inside Shadow DOM" /&gt;
  &lt;/template&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre></div>
<p>The second code block is identical except that it sets the <code>shadowrootdelegatesfocus</code> attribute, which delegates focus to the first focusable element in the tree if a non-focusable element in the tree is selected.</p>
<div><pre><code>&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;template shadowrootmode="open" shadowrootdelegatesfocus&gt;
    &lt;style&gt;
      :host {
        display: block;
        border: 1px dotted black;
        padding: 10px;
        margin: 10px;
      }
      :focus {
        outline: 2px solid blue;
      }
    &lt;/style&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;Clickable Shadow DOM text&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;input type="text" placeholder="Input inside Shadow DOM" /&gt;
  &lt;/template&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre></div>
<p>Last of all we use the following CSS to apply a red border to the parent <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element when it has focus.</p>
<div><pre><code>div:focus {
  border: 2px solid red;
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>The results are shown below.
When the HTML is first rendered, the elements have no styling, as shown in the first image.
For the shadow root that does not have <code>shadowrootdelegatesfocus</code> set you can click anywhere except the <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> and the focus does not change (if you select the <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> element it will look like the second image).</p>

<p>For the shadow root with <code>shadowrootdelegatesfocus</code> set, clicking on the text (which is non-focusable) selects the <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> element, as this is the first focusable element in the tree.
This also focuses the parent element as shown below.</p>

Your LinkedIn endorsements are social credit. Your Uber passenger rating, Instagram engagement metrics, Amazon reviews, and Airbnb host status are all social credit systems that track you, score you, and reward you based on your behavior.</p><p>Social credit, in its original economic definition, means distributing industry profits to consumers to increase purchasing power. But the term has evolved far beyond economics. Today, it describes any kind of metric that tracks individual behavior, assigns scores based on that behavior, and uses those scores to determine access to services, opportunities, or social standing.</p><p>Sounds dystopian, doesn’t it? But guess what? Every time an algorithm evaluates your trustworthiness, reliability, or social value, whether for a loan, a job, a date, or a ride, you're participating in a social credit system. The scoring happens constantly, invisibly, and across dozens of platforms that weave into your daily life.</p><p>The only difference between your phone and China's social credit system is that China tells you what they're doing. We pretend our algorithmic reputation scores are just “user experience features.” At least Beijing admits they're gamifying human behavior.</p><p>When Americans think of the "Chinese social credit system," they likely picture Black Mirror episodes and Orwellian nightmares. Citizens are tracked for every jaywalking incident, points are deducted for buying too much alcohol, and facial recognition cameras are monitoring social gatherings; the image is so powerful that Utah's House passed a law banning social credit systems, despite none existing in America.</p><p>Here's what's actually happening. As of 2024, there's still no nationwide social credit score in China. Most private scoring systems have been shut down, and local government pilots have largely ended. It’s mainly a fragmented collection of regulatory compliance tools, mostly focused on financial behavior and business oversight. While well over 33 million businesses have been scored under corporate social credit systems, individual scoring remains limited to small pilot cities like Rongcheng. Even there, scoring systems have had "very limited impact" since they've never been elevated to provincial or national levels.</p><p>What actually gets tracked? Primarily court judgment defaults: people who refuse to pay fines or loans despite having the ability. The Supreme People's Court's blacklist is composed of citizens and companies that refuse to comply with court orders, typically to pay fines or repay loans. Some experimental programs in specific cities track broader social behavior, but these remain isolated experiments.</p><p>The gap between Western perception and Chinese reality is enormous, and it reveals something important: we're worried about a system that barely exists while ignoring the behavioral scoring systems we actually live with.</p><p>You already live in social credit.</p><p>Open your phone right now and count the apps that are scoring your behavior. Uber drivers rate you as a passenger. Instagram tracks your engagement patterns. Your bank is analyzing your Venmo transactions and Afterpay usage. LinkedIn measures your professional networking activity. Amazon evaluates your purchasing behavior. Each platform maintains detailed behavioral profiles that determine your access to services, opportunities, and social connections.</p><p>We just don't call it social credit.</p><p>Your credit score doesn't just determine loan eligibility; it affects where you can live, which jobs you can get, and how much you pay for car insurance. But traditional credit scoring is expanding rapidly. Some specialized lenders scan social media profiles as part of alternative credit assessments, particularly for borrowers with limited credit histories. Payment apps and financial services increasingly track spending patterns and transaction behaviors to build comprehensive risk profiles. The European Central Bank has asked some institutions to monitor social media chatter for early warnings of bank runs, though this is more about systemic risk than individual account decisions. Background check companies routinely analyze social media presence for character assessment. LinkedIn algorithmically manages your professional visibility based on engagement patterns, posting frequency, and network connections, rankings that recruiters increasingly rely on to filter candidates. Even dating has become a scoring system: apps use engagement rates and response patterns to determine who rises to the top of the queue and who gets buried.</p><p>What we have aren't unified social credit systems…yet. They're fragmented behavioral scoring networks that don't directly communicate. Your Uber rating doesn't affect your mortgage rate, and your LinkedIn engagement doesn't determine your insurance premiums. But the infrastructure is being built to connect these systems. We're building the technical and cultural foundations that could eventually create comprehensive social credit systems. The question isn't whether we have Chinese-style social credit now (because we don't). The question is whether we're building toward it without acknowledging what we're creating.</p><p>Where China's limited experiments have been explicit about scoring criteria, Western systems hide their decision-making processes entirely. Even China's fragmented approach offers more visibility into how behavioral data gets used than our black box algorithms do.</p><p>You may argue there's a fundamental difference between corporate tracking and government surveillance. Corporations compete; you can switch services. Governments have monopoly power and can restrict fundamental freedoms.</p><p>This misses three key points: First, switching costs for major platforms are enormous. Try leaving Google's ecosystem or abandoning your LinkedIn network. Second, corporate social credit systems increasingly collaborate. Bad Uber ratings can affect other services; poor credit scores impact everything from insurance to employment. Third, Western governments already access this corporate data through legal channels and data purchases.</p><p>Social credit systems are spreading globally because they solve coordination problems. They reduce fraud, encourage cooperation, and create behavioral incentives at scale. The question isn't whether Western societies will adopt social credit (because we're building toward it). The question is whether we'll be transparent and accountable about it or continue pretending our algorithmic reputation scores are just neutral technology.</p><p>Current trends suggest both systems are evolving toward more comprehensive behavioral scoring. European digital identity initiatives are linking multiple service scores. US cities are experimenting with behavioral incentive programs. Corporate platforms increasingly share reputation data. Financial services integrate social media analysis into lending decisions.</p><p>If both countries evolve toward comprehensive behavioral scoring, and current trends suggest they will, which approach better serves individual agencies? One that admits it's scoring you, or one that pretends algorithmic recommendations are just helpful suggestions?</p><p>When Uber can destroy your transportation access with a hidden algorithm, and when credit scores determine your housing options through opaque calculations, is that really more free than a system where you know at least some of the behaviors that affect your score?</p><p>So when China's explicit social credit approach inevitably influences Western platforms, when your apps start showing you the behavioral scores they've always been calculating, when the rules become visible instead of hidden, don't panic.</p><p>Because for the first time, you'll finally understand the game you've been playing all along. And knowing the rules means you can finally choose whether you want to play.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-role="selectable">
    <p><span>The latest ambition of artificial intelligence research — particularly within the labs seeking “artificial general intelligence,” or AGI — is something called a world model: a representation of the environment that an AI carries around inside itself like a computational snow globe. The AI system can use this simplified representation to evaluate predictions and decisions before applying them to its real-world tasks. The deep learning luminaries Yann LeCun (of Meta), Demis Hassabis (of Google DeepMind) and Yoshua Bengio (of Mila, the Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute) all believe world models are essential for building AI systems that are truly </span><a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/new-theory-suggests-chatbots-can-understand-text-20240122/"><span>smart</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/ai-changes-science-and-math-forever-20250430/"><span>scientific</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/what-does-it-mean-to-align-ai-with-human-values-20221213/"><span>safe</span></a><span>. </span></p>
<p><span>The fields of psychology, robotics and machine learning have each been using some version of the concept for decades. You likely have a world model running inside your skull right now — it</span><span><span dir="RTL" lang="AR-SA">’</span>s how you know not to step in front of a moving train without needing to run the experiment first. </span></p>
<p><span>So does this mean that AI researchers have finally found a </span><a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/what-the-most-essential-terms-in-ai-really-mean-20250430/"><span>core concept</span></a><span> whose meaning everyone can agree upon? As a famous physicist </span><a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Surely_You_re_Joking_Mr_Feynman/_gA_DwAAQBAJ"><span>once wrote</span></a><span>: Surely you</span><span><span dir="RTL" lang="AR-SA">’</span>re joking. A world model may sound straightforward — but as usual, </span><a href="https://lingo.csail.mit.edu/blog/world_models"><span>no one can agree on the details</span></a><span>. What gets represented in the model, and to what level of fidelity? Is it innate or learned, or some combination of both? And how do you detect that it</span><span><span dir="RTL" lang="AR-SA">’</span>s even there at all?</span></p>

<p><span>It helps to know where the whole idea started. In 1943, a dozen years before the term “artificial intelligence” was coined, a 29-year-old Scottish psychologist named Kenneth Craik published an </span><a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Nature_of_Explanation/wT04AAAAIAAJ?hl=en"><span>influential monograph</span></a><span> in which he mused that “if the organism carries a ‘small-scale model’ of external reality … within its head, it is able to try out various alternatives, conclude which is the best of them … and in every way to react in a much fuller, safer, and more competent manner.” Craik</span><span><span dir="RTL" lang="AR-SA">’</span>s notion of a mental model or simulation presaged the “</span><a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~rit/geo/Miller.pdf"><span>cognitive revolution</span></a><span>” that transformed psychology in the 1950s and still rules the cognitive sciences today. What’s more, it directly linked cognition with computation: Craik considered the “power to parallel or model external events” to be “the fundamental feature” of both “neural machinery” and “calculating machines.”</span></p>
<p><span>The nascent field of artificial intelligence eagerly adopted the world-modeling approach. In the late 1960s, an AI system called </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHRDLU"><span><span>SHRDLU</span></span></a><span> wowed observers by using a rudimentary “block world” to answer commonsense questions about tabletop objects, like “Can a pyramid support a block?” But these handcrafted models couldn’t scale up to handle the complexity of more realistic settings. By the late 1980s, the AI and robotics pioneer Rodney Brooks had given up on world models completely, famously asserting that “the world is its own best model” and “explicit representations … simply get in the way.”</span></p>
<p><span>It took the rise of machine learning, especially deep learning based on artificial neural networks, to breathe life back into Craik’s brainchild. Instead of relying on brittle hand-coded rules, deep neural networks could build up internal approximations of their training environments</span> <a href="https://worldmodels.github.io/"><span>through trial and error</span></a><span> and then use them to accomplish narrowly specified tasks, </span><span>such as driving a virtual race car</span><span>. In the past few years, as the large language models behind chatbots like ChatGPT began to demonstrate </span><a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-unpredictable-abilities-emerging-from-large-ai-models-20230316/"><span>emergent capabilities</span></a><span> that they weren’t explicitly trained for — like inferring movie titles from strings of emojis, or </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13382"><span>playing the board game Othello</span></a><span> — world models provided a convenient explanation for the mystery. To prominent AI experts such as Geoffrey Hinton, Ilya Sutskever and Chris Olah, it was obvious: Buried somewhere deep within an LLM’s thicket of virtual neurons must lie “a small-scale model of external reality,” just as Craik imagined.</span></p>

<p><span>The truth, at least so far as we know, is less impressive. Instead of world models, today’s generative AIs appear to learn “bags of heuristics”: scores of disconnected rules of thumb that can approximate responses to specific scenarios, but don’t cohere into a consistent whole. (Some may actually contradict each other.) It’s a lot like the parable of the blind men and the elephant, where each man only touches one part of the animal at a time and fails to apprehend its full form. One man feels the trunk and assumes the entire elephant is snakelike; another touches a leg and guesses it’s more like a tree; a third grasps the elephant’s tail and says it’s a rope. When researchers </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03689v3"><span>attempt</span></a><span> to recover evidence of a world model from within an LLM — for example, a coherent computational representation of an Othello game board — they’re looking for the whole elephant. What they find instead is a bit of snake here, a chunk of tree there, and some rope.</span></p>
<p><span>Of course, such heuristics are hardly worthless. LLMs can encode untold sackfuls of them within their trillions of parameters — and as the old saw goes, quantity has a quality all its own. That’s what makes it possible to train a language model to generate nearly perfect directions between any two points in Manhattan without learning a coherent world model of the entire street network in the process, as researchers from Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03689"><span>recently discovered</span></a><span>. </span></p>
<p><span>So if bits of snake, tree and rope can do the job, why bother with the elephant? In a word, robustness: When the researchers threw their Manhattan-navigating LLM a mild curveball by randomly blocking 1% of the streets, its performance cratered. If the AI had simply encoded a street map whose details were consistent — instead of an immensely complicated, corner-by-corner patchwork of conflicting best guesses — it could have easily rerouted around the obstructions.</span></p>
        
        
<p><span>Given the benefits that even simple world models can confer, it’s easy to understand why every large AI lab is desperate to develop them — and why academic researchers are increasingly interested in </span><a href="https://www.worldmodelworkshop.org/"><span>scrutinizing them</span></a><span>, too. Robust and verifiable world models could uncover, if not the El Dorado of AGI, then at least a scientifically plausible tool for extinguishing AI hallucinations, enabling reliable reasoning, and increasing the interpretability of AI systems.</span></p>
<p><span>That’s the “what” and “why” of world models. The “how,” though, is still anyone</span><span><span dir="RTL" lang="AR-SA">’</span>s guess. Google DeepMind and OpenAI are betting that with enough “multimodal” training data — like video, 3D simulations, and other input beyond mere text — a world model will spontaneously congeal within a neural network’s statistical soup. Meta’s LeCun, meanwhile, thinks that an entirely new (and non-generative) AI architecture will provide the necessary scaffolding. In the quest to build these computational snow globes, no one has a crystal ball — but the prize, for once, may just be worth the hype.</span></p>

<p><span>Opinion</span> With AI's rise, AI web crawlers are strip-mining the web in their perpetual hunt for ever more content to feed into their Large Language Model (LLM) mills. How much traffic do they account for? According to <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/" rel="nofollow">Cloudflare</a>, a major content delivery network (CDN) force, <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/from-googlebot-to-gptbot-whos-crawling-your-site-in-2025/" rel="nofollow">30% of global web traffic now comes from bots.</a> Leading the way and growing fast? AI bots.</p>
<p>Cloud services company <a href="https://www.fastly.com/" rel="nofollow">Fastly</a> agrees. It reports that <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/21/ai_crawler_traffic/">80% of all AI bot traffic comes from AI data fetcher bots</a>.&nbsp; So, you ask, "What's the problem? Haven't web crawlers been around since 1993 with the arrival of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web_Wanderer" rel="nofollow">World Wide Web Wanderer</a> in 1993?"&nbsp; Well, yes, they have. Anyone who runs a website, though, knows there's a huge, honking difference between the old-style crawlers and today's AI crawlers. The new ones are site killers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fastly warns that they're causing "performance degradation, service disruption, and increased operational costs." Why? Because they're hammering websites with traffic spikes that can reach up to ten or even twenty times normal levels within minutes.&nbsp;</p>

    

<p>Moreover, AI crawlers are much more aggressive than standard crawlers. As the <a href="https://www.inmotionhosting.com/" rel="nofollow">InMotionhosting</a> web hosting company notes, they also tend to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.inmotionhosting.com/blog/ai-crawlers-slowing-down-your-website/" rel="nofollow">disregard crawl delays or bandwidth-saving guidelines</a> and extract full page text, and sometimes attempt to follow dynamic links or scripts.</p>

        


        

<p>The result? If you're using a shared server for your website, as many small businesses do, even if your site isn't being shaken down for content, other sites on the same hardware with the same Internet pipe may be getting hit. This means your site's performance drops through the floor even if an AI crawler isn't raiding your website.</p>
<p>Smaller sites, like my own <a href="https://practical-tech.com/" rel="nofollow">Practical Tech</a>, get slammed to the point where they're simply knocked out of service. Thanks to <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/ddos/" rel="nofollow">Cloudflare Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) protection</a>, my microsite can shrug off DDoS attacks. AI bot attacks – and let's face it, they are attacks – not so much.&nbsp;</p>

        

<p>Even large websites are feeling the crush. To handle the load, they must increase their processor, memory, and network resources. If they don't? Well, according to most web hosting companies, if a website takes longer than three seconds to load, more than half of visitors will abandon the site. Bounce rates jump up for every second beyond that threshold.</p>
<p>So when AI searchbots, with Meta (52% of AI searchbot traffic), Google (23%), and OpenAI (20%) leading the way, clobber websites with as much as 30 Terabits in a single surge, they're damaging even the largest companies' site performance.</p>
<p>Now, if that were traffic that I could monetize, it would be one thing. It's not. It used to be when search indexing crawler, Googlebot, came calling, I could always hope that some story on my site would land on the magical first page of someone's search results so they'd visit me, they'd read the story, and two or three times out of a hundred visits, they'd click on an ad, and I'd get a few pennies of income. Or, if I had a business site, I might sell a widget or get someone to do business with me.</p>

        

<p>AI searchbots? Not so much.&nbsp;AI crawlers don't direct users back to the original sources. They kick our sites around, return nothing, and we're left trying to decide how we're to make a living in the AI-driven web world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, of course, we can try to fend them off with logins, paywalls, CAPTCHA challenges, and sophisticated anti-bot technologies. You know one thing AI is good at? It's getting around those walls.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for robots.txt files, the old-school way of blocking crawlers? Many – most? – AI crawlers simply ignore them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/04/perplexity_ai_crawlers_accused_data_raids/">Perplexity has been accused by Cloudflare of ignoring robots.txt</a> files. <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/perplexity-says-cloudflares-accusations-of-stealth-ai-scraping-are-based-on-embarrassing-errors/" rel="nofollow">Perplexity, in turn, hotly denies this accusation</a>.&nbsp; Me? All I know is I see regular waves of multiple companies' AI bots raiding my site.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are efforts afoot to supplement robots.txt with <a href="https://llmstxt.org/" rel="nofollow">llms.txt</a> files. This is a proposed standard to provide LLM-friendly content that LLMs can access without compromising the site's performance. Not everyone is thrilled with this approach, though, and it may yet come to nothing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the meantime, to combat excessive crawling, some infrastructure providers, such as <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/07/01/cloudflare_creates_ai_crawler_toll/">Cloudflare, now offer default bot-blocking services</a> to block AI crawlers and provide mechanisms to deter AI companies from accessing their data. Other programs, such as the popular open-source and free <a href="https://anubis.techaro.lol/" rel="nofollow">Anubis AI crawler blocker</a>, just attempt to slow down their visits to a, if you'll pardon the expression, a crawl.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the arms race between all businesses and their websites and AI companies, eventually, they'll reach some kind of neutrality. Unfortunately, the web will be more fragmented than ever. Sites will further restrict or monetize access. Important, accurate information will end up siloed behind walls or removed altogether.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember the open web? I do. I can see our kids on the Internet, where you must pay cash money to access almost anything. I don't think anyone wants a Balkanized Internet, but I fear that's exactly where we're going.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="incArticle"><p><em>Update: It looks like this may have been OpenAI's attempt to get ahead of a horrifying story that just broke, about a man who fell into AI psychosis and killed his mother in a murder-suicide. <a href="https://futurism.com/man-chatgpt-psychosis-murders-mother">Full details here</a>.</em></p><p>For the <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/ai-chatbot-urged-teen-suicide">better part of a year</a>, we've watched — <a href="https://futurism.com/chatgpt-mental-health-crises">and reported</a> — in horror as more and more stories emerge about AI chatbots leading people to <a href="https://futurism.com/ai-chatbots-teens-self-harm">self-harm</a>, <a href="https://futurism.com/chatgpt-mental-health-crises">delusions</a>, <a href="https://futurism.com/chatgpt-man-hospital">hospitalization</a>, <a href="https://futurism.com/commitment-jail-chatgpt-psychosis">arrest</a>, and <a href="https://futurism.com/woman-suicide-openai-therapist">suicide</a>.</p><p>As the loved ones of the people impacted by these dangerous bots <a href="https://futurism.com/mother-teen-suicide-chatbots-letter">rally for change</a> to prevent such harm from happening to anyone else, the <a href="https://futurism.com/character-ai-parental-controls-bypass">companies that run</a> these AIs have been slow to implement safeguards — and OpenAI, whose ChatGPT has been repeatedly implicated in what experts are now calling "<a href="https://futurism.com/paper-ai-psychosis-schizophrenia">AI psychosis</a>," has until recently done little more than offer <a href="https://futurism.com/openai-response-chatgpt-mental-health">copy-pasted promises</a>.</p><p>In a <a href="https://openai.com/index/helping-people-when-they-need-it-most/">new blog post</a> admitting certain failures amid its users' mental health crises, OpenAI also quietly disclosed that it's now scanning users' messages for certain types of harmful content, escalating particularly worrying content to human staff for review — and, in some cases, reporting it to the cops.</p><p>"When we detect users who are planning to harm others, we route their conversations to specialized pipelines where they are reviewed by a small team trained on our usage policies and who are authorized to take action, including banning accounts," the blog post notes. "If human reviewers determine that a case involves an imminent threat of serious physical harm to others, we may refer it to law enforcement."</p><p>That short&nbsp;and vague statement leaves a lot to be desired — and <a href="https://openai.com/policies/usage-policies/">OpenAI's usage policies</a>, referenced as the basis on which the human review team operates, don't provide much more clarity.</p><p>When describing its rule against "harm [to] yourself or others," the company listed off some pretty standard examples of prohibited activity, including using ChatGPT "to promote suicide or self-harm, develop or use weapons, injure others or destroy property, or engage in unauthorized activities that violate the security of any service or system."</p><p>But in the post warning users that the company will call the authorities if they seem like they're going to hurt someone, OpenAI also acknowledged that it is "currently not referring self-harm cases to law enforcement to respect people’s privacy given the uniquely private nature of ChatGPT interactions."</p><p>While ChatGPT has in the past proven itself pretty susceptible to so-called jailbreaks that trick it into spitting out <a href="https://openai.com/policies/usage-policies/">instructions to build neurotoxins</a>&nbsp;or step-by-step <a href="https://news.northeastern.edu/2025/07/31/chatgpt-suicide-research/">instructions to kill yourself</a>, this new rule adds an additional layer of confusion. It remains unclear which exact types of chats could result in user conversations being flagged for human review, much less getting referred to police. We've reached out to OpenAI to ask for clarity.</p><p>While it's certainly a relief that AI conversations won't result in police wellness checks — which <a href="https://www.safetyreimagined.org/papers/welfare-checks">often end up causing more harm</a> to the person in crisis due to most cops' complete lack of training in handling mental health situations<strong>&nbsp;</strong>— it's also kind of bizarre that OpenAI even mentions privacy, given that it admitted in the same post that it's monitoring user chats and potentially sharing them with the fuzz.</p><p>To make the announcement all the weirder, this new rule seems to contradict the company's pro-privacy stance amid its <a href="https://futurism.com/openai-content-new-york-times-lawsuit">ongoing lawsuit</a> with the <em>New York Times</em> and other publishers as they seek access to <a href="https://futurism.com/newspaper-chatgpt-logs-lawsuit">troves of ChatGPT logs</a> to determine whether any of their copyrighted data had been used to train its models.</p><p>OpenAI has <a href="https://openai.com/index/response-to-nyt-data-demands/">steadfastly rejected</a> the publishers' request on grounds of protecting user privacy and has, more recently, begun trying to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/08/openai-offers-20-million-user-chats-in-chatgpt-lawsuit-nyt-wants-120-million/">limit the amount</a> of user chats it has to give the plaintiffs.</p><p>Last month, the company's CEO <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/25/sam-altman-warns-theres-no-legal-confidentiality-when-using-chatgpt-as-a-therapist/">Sam Altman admitted</a> during an appearance on a podcast that using ChatGPT as a therapist or attorney doesn't confer the same confidentiality that talking to a flesh-and-blood professional would — and that thanks to the <em>NYT</em> lawsuit, the company may be forced to turn those chats over to courts.</p><p>In other words, OpenAI is stuck between a rock and a hard place. The PR blowback from its users spiraling into mental health crises and dying by suicide is appalling — but since it's clearly having trouble controlling its own tech enough to protect users from those harmful scenarios, it's falling back on heavy-handed moderation that flies in the face of its own CEO's promises.</p><p><strong>More on the dark side of ChatGPT: </strong><a href="https://futurism.com/lawsuit-parents-son-suicide-chatgpt"><em>After Their Son's Suicide, His Parents Were Horrified to Find His Conversations With ChatGPT</em></a></p><br></section></div>]]></description>

Rowe Price Associates, Inc., T. Rowe Price Investment Management, Inc., WCM Investment Management, and XN.</p><p>“From Fortune 500 companies to AI-native startups, our customers rely on Anthropic’s frontier models and platform products for their most important, mission-critical work,” said Krishna Rao, Chief Financial Officer of Anthropic. “We are seeing exponential growth in demand across our entire customer base. This financing demonstrates investors’ extraordinary confidence in our financial performance and the strength of their collaboration with us to continue fueling our unprecedented growth.”</p><p>Anthropic has seen rapid growth since the launch of Claude in March 2023. At the beginning of 2025, less than two years after launch, Anthropic’s run-rate revenue had grown to approximately $1 billion. By August 2025, just eight months later, our run-rate revenue reached over $5 billion—making Anthropic one of the fastest-growing technology companies in history.</p><p>Anthropic’s trajectory has been driven by our leading technical talent, our focus on safety, and our frontier research, including pioneering alignment and interpretability work, all of which underpin the performance and reliability of our models. Every day more businesses, developers, and consumer power users are trusting Claude to help them solve their most challenging problems. Anthropic now serves over 300,000 business customers, and our number of large accounts—customers that each represent over $100,000 in run-rate revenue—has grown nearly 7x in the past year.</p><p>This growth spans the entire Anthropic platform, with advancements for businesses, developers, and consumers. For businesses, our API and <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-for-financial-services">industry-specific products</a> make it easy to add powerful AI to their critical applications without complex integration work. Developers have made Claude Code their tool of choice since its full launch in May 2025. Claude Code has quickly taken off—already generating over $500 million in run-rate revenue with usage growing more than 10x in just three months. For individual users, the Pro and Max plans for Claude deliver enhanced AI capabilities for everyday tasks and specialized projects.</p><p>“Anthropic is on an exceptional trajectory, combining research excellence, technological leadership, and relentless focus on customers. We’re honored to partner with Dario and the team, and our lead investment in their Series F reflects our belief in their values and their ability to shape the future of responsible AI,” said Divesh Makan, Partner at ICONIQ. “Enterprise leaders tell us what we’re seeing firsthand—Claude is reliable, built on a trustworthy foundation, and guided by leaders truly focused on the long term.”</p><p>The Series F investment will expand our capacity to meet growing enterprise demand, deepen our safety research, and support international expansion as we continue building reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems.</p></div></article></div>]]></description>

  Varun wrote about
  <a href="https://varunbarad.com/blog/blogging-achievements">gamifying blogging and personal website maintenance</a>
  which reminded me of the time when
  <a href="https://hamatti.org/posts/i-gamified-my-own-blog/">I awarded myself some badges for blogging</a>.
</p>

<p>
  I mentioned this to Varun who asked if I had any screenshots of what it looked
  like on my website. My initial answer was “no”, then I looked at Wayback
  Machine but there were not pictures of the badges.
</p>

<p>
  Then, a bit later it hit me. I don’t need any archived screenshots: my website
  is built with Eleventy and it's static so I can check out a git commit from
  the time I had those badges up, fire up Eleventy and see the website — as it
  was in the spring of 2021.
</p>
<p><img src="https://hamatti.org/assets/img/posts/static-sites-enable-a-good-time-travel-experience/1.png.webp" alt="A screenshot of my blog index with five custom badges for self-hosting, polyglot, 20 weeks in a row, 12 months without major rewrites and 100 posts."></p><p>
  That’s a beauty of a static site generator combined with my workflow of
  fetching posts from CMS before build time so each commit contains a full
  snapshot of the website.
</p>

<p>
  Comparing this to a website that uses a database for posts (like WordPress) or
  a flow where posts from CMS are not stored in version control but rather
  fetched at build time only, my solution makes time travel to (almost) any
  given moment in time a two-command operation (<code>git checkout</code>
  with the right commit hash and
  <code>@11ty/eleventy serve</code> to serve a dev
  server). I say almost because back in the day I wasn’t quite as diligent in
  commiting every change as I was deploying manually and not through version
  control automation.
</p>

<p>
  A year ago, inspired by Alex Chan’s blog post
  <a href="https://alexwlchan.net/2024/scheduled-screenshots/">Taking regular screenshots of my website</a>
  I set up a GitHub Action that takes a snapshot of my front page once a month
  to keep a record. At the time, I felt bit sad that I hadn’t started it before.
  However, now that I realised how easy it is for me to go back in time thanks
  to Eleventy and git, I’m not so worried anymore. Maybe I should do a collage
  of changes on my design one day by going through my project history.
</p>

<p>One more major point for static site generators!</p>

<p>As a rule, if a package is shipped with a Debian release, users can
count on it being available, and updated, for the entire
life of the release. If package <em>foo</em> is included in the stable
<span>release—currently</span> Debian&nbsp;13
<span>("trixie")—a</span> user can
reasonably expect that it will continue to be available with security
backports as long as that release is supported, though it may not be
included in Debian&nbsp;14 ("forky"). However, it is likely that the
<a href="https://guix.gnu.org/en/">Guix</a> package manager will soon
be removed from the repositories for Debian&nbsp;13 and
Debian&nbsp;12 ("bookworm", also called oldstable).</p>

<p>Debian has the <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1017315/">Advanced
Package Tool</a> (APT) for package management, of course, but Guix
offers a different approach and can be used in conjunction with other
distribution package managers. Guix is inspired by <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nix?tab=readme-ov-file#nix">Nix</a>'s
functional package management; it offers transactional upgrades and
rollbacks, package management for unprivileged users, and more. Unlike
Nix, its packages are <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/html_node/Defining-Packages.html">defined</a>
using the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/">Guile</a>
implementation of the <a href="https://www.scheme.org/">Scheme</a> programming
language. There is also a GNU Guix distribution as well; LWN <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/962788/">covered</a> both NixOS and
Guix in February 2024, and <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/981124/">looked at</a> Nix alternative <a href="https://lix.systems/">Lix</a> in July 2024.</p>

<p>On June&nbsp;24, the Guix project <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/en/blog/2025/privilege-escalation-vulnerabilities-2025/">disclosed
several security vulnerabilities</a> that affected the <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/html_node/Invoking-guix_002ddaemon.html"><tt>guix-daemon</tt></a>,
which is a program that is used to build software and
access the <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/html_node/The-Store.html">store</a>
where successful builds are kept. Two of the vulnerabilities, <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-46415">CVE-2025-46415</a>
and <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-46416">CVE-2025-46416</a>,
would allow a local user to gain the privileges of any build users,
manipulate build output, as well as gain the privileges of the daemon
user. The vulnerabilities also impacted <a href="https://discourse.nixos.org/t/security-advisory-privilege-escalations-in-nix-lix-and-guix/66017">Nix</a>
and <a href="https://lix.systems/blog/2025-06-24-lix-cves/">Lix</a>
package managers.</p>

<p>The disclosure blog post gave instructions on how to mitigate the
vulnerabilities by updating <tt>guix-daemon</tt> using the
"<tt>guix&nbsp;pull</tt>" command, but the project did not make a new
Guix release. The last actual release from the project
was <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/en/blog/2022/gnu-guix-1.4.0-released/">version&nbsp;1.4.0</a>,
which was announced in December 2022. The Guix project has a
rolling-release model, with sporadic releases, and does not maintain
stable branches with security updates. This may not pose a problem for
users getting Guix directly from the project, but it poses some
obstacles for inclusion in other Linux distributions.</p>

<h4>Debian package</h4>

<p>Salvatore Bonaccorso filed a <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1108318">bug</a>
against <a href="https://packages.debian.org/source/trixie/guix">Debian's
<tt>guix</tt> package</a>
on June&nbsp;25 to report the vulnerabilities. Vagrant
Cascadian, the maintainer of the package, <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1108318#10">replied</a>
on July&nbsp;15, and said that the fixes for the security
vulnerabilities had been "<q>commingled with a lot of other upstream
changes</q>", and it would be "<q>trickier than in the past</q>" to try
to backport the fixes without the other changes in Guix. He said he
had just managed to "<q>get something to compile</q>" with the
security fixes applied, using a <a href="https://codeberg.org/GNUtoo/guix-security-fixes">backport
repository</a> maintained by Denis 'GNUtoo' Carikli.</p>

<p>Carikli had <a href="https://yhetil.org/guix-devel/20250708210158.4963b38a@primarylaptop.localdomain/">brought
up</a> the difficulty of backporting Guix fixes on the guix-devel
mailing list on July&nbsp;8. Various distributions had Guix versions
1.2.0, 1.3.0, and 1.4.0, with Debian shipping 1.2.0 and 1.4.0 and used
as the upstream for other distributions' packages:</p>

<blockquote>
But the Debian package maintainer has the almost impossible task to
backport all the security fixes without a community nor help behind
[maintaining it] and as things are going, this will probably lead to
the Debian guix package being removed with cascading effect for the
other distributions.
</blockquote>

<p>He said he had applied about 50 patches that involve <tt>guix-daemon</tt>
between the 1.4.0 release and the last-known security fix. He also
noted that his effort would probably not be suitable for Linux
distributions that ship a Guix package. He wondered what the best way
would be to collaborate on a branch that distributions could pull from
for updates.</p>

<p>Liam Hupfer <a href="https://yhetil.org/guix-devel/87sej6asy2.fsf@hpfr.net/">said</a>
that "<q>we gave up and shipped the last commit on master mentioned in
the recent CVE disclosure</q>" for Nix. He said he would also like to
see Guix figure out backporting patches, but could Cascadian consider
the Nix approach until then?</p>

<p>No, that approach would not make sense, Cascadian <a href="https://yhetil.org/guix-devel/87frf3sv7p.fsf@wireframe/">said</a>. If
Guix was "<q>truly a rolling release</q>", then it may just not make
sense to maintain distribution packages:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Up till recently, it has always been possible to backport changes with
relative ease, but that was perhaps just lack of development... the
recent unprivileged daemon stuff really made backporting patches
harder. [...]</p>

<p>In the Debian release model, ideally we would avoid bringing in
unrelated patchsets (e.g. the unprivileged daemon code bringing in an
entire network stack?) but that might be too hard to pull off. Not sure
if the security team would accept a patchset that includes more than the
minimum necessary to fix the security issues.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Without a branch that contained backported patches, they would be
inclined "<q>to recommend dropping the Guix package in Debian</q>".</p>

<p>On August&nbsp;27, they did just that. Cascadian filed a <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1112248#5">bug</a>
to remove <tt>guix</tt> from Debian&nbsp;11 ("bullseye"), bookworm,
and trixie. They also filed a <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/1112143">bug</a> to
remove the package from the upcoming forky release. Adam D. Barratt <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1112250#12">replied</a>
and said that it would not be possible to remove <tt>guix</tt> from
bullseye, which is now an <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/LTS">LTS
release</a>; only updates from the security archive were now
allowed.</p>

<p>There are no dependencies on <tt>guix</tt>, so the removal of the
package should not affect any other Debian packages in the trixie and
bookworm releases.</p>

<h4>What's next?</h4>

<p>I emailed Cascadian to find out what the next steps would be for
the package in those releases. They said that the package is likely to
be removed from the upcoming <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianReleases/PointReleases">point
releases</a> for trixie and bookworm. Users who have it installed
already will be stuck at the old version, unless they take manual
steps to update. Cascadian said this was not a great outcome "<q>but
better than keeping it available for people to install the vulnerable
version</q>".</p>

<p>The <tt>guix</tt> package should not have landed in trixie at all,
Cascadian said, "<q>my understanding was that [the bug report] should
have blocked it from being released</q>". However, it seems there was
enough activity on the bug that prevented Debian's autoremoval
mechanisms from triggering and pulling the package from the final
release. "<q>There apparently is not manual review of all blockers in
the current Debian release process</q>". Even if the timing had been
better for the trixie release, though, the same fixes would need to
have been applied to bookworm and older releases.</p>

<p>Cascadian said that it has been a fair amount of work to keep Guix
working on Debian. For example, he has had to maintain various Guile
dependencies, and deal with the fact that Guix uses "<q>fairly
old</q>" GCC versions whereas Debian usually ships the latest GCC
version available for a given release. At some point, they said,
"<q>you have to evaluate whether that work is worth it</q>" when the
upstream provides a binary that people can install.</p>

<p>Guix is better for having been packaged for Debian and run through
Debian's <a href="https://lintian.debian.org/">Lintian</a>
tool. Cascadian said that they have probably fixed more typos in Guix
than anyone else, and have found other problems while checking that
the builds of Guix are reproducible. "<q>Any time you run a piece of
software through processes outside of the primary development
workflow, you find surprises worth fixing.</q>"</p>

<h4>Regular releases</h4>

<p>There is an effort in the Guix project to create yearly releases. In
May, Steve George proposed that the project adopt a <a href="https://codeberg.org/guix/guix-consensus-documents/src/branch/main/001-gcd-process.md#summary">Guix
Consensus Document</a> for "<a href="https://consensus.guix.gnu.org/gcd/005-regular-releases.html">Regular
and efficient releases</a>", and it was accepted by the project in
July. It calls for a release every year in June, with a one-time
exception for a November&nbsp;2025 release, and a short development
cycle for the June&nbsp;2026 release. Even so, that will not provide
stable branches for Debian and other distributions to pull from; it
will just shorten the interval and feature differences between major
releases.</p>

<p>Debian users will, of course, still be able to use Guix by <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/html_node/Binary-Installation.html">installing
it using binaries provided by the Guix project</a>. That will, at
least potentially, leave some users out in the cold—Debian
currently provides a <tt>guix</tt> package for x86-64, Arm64, PowerPC,
RISC-V, 32-bit Arm, and 32-bit x86. The Guix project itself does does
not have RISC-V binaries, though it does cover the other
architectures.</p>

<p>It is fairly unusual for a package to be removed from a stable or
oldstable release. For example, the bookworm release has been out for
more than two years, but a <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?dist=unstable;include=subject%3ARM;tag=bookworm">search</a>
of the Debian bug database only shows one
package—<tt>guix</tt>—that has the "RM" tag in the subject
to flag a package for removal. </p>

<p>According to Debian's <a href="https://qa.debian.org/popcon.php?package=guix">popularity
contest (popcon) statistics</a>, there are not quite 230 systems with
Guix installed. Popcon statistics only hint at the actual number of
package installs, but assuming they are approximately accurate, then
removing Guix will not inconvenience a significant number of Debian
users. It will, however, mean that fewer people are poking at Guix
with an intent to making it work on distributions like Debian, while finding
distribution-specific bugs.</p>

They don’t go “oh, well, this is your third company, so I guess I’ll defer to you on all product decisions”. They care about comp, a trait you consider disqualifying.

The hires you need aren't looking at your company as the slam-dunk success that a founder necessarily needs to believe that it is. Maybe they will once they talk to you, but that's later - at the top of your funnel, you're just another face in the crowd, and you need to act like it.</p><p>I’m not telling you to hire people who aren’t good. I’m not even telling you that the traits you want aren’t good things to look for. I’m not telling you to actually compromise on quality. I’m telling you that <strong>trying to hire </strong>the best engineers is the enemy of<strong> actually hiring </strong>great ones. You’re going to have to give up something (possibly time, possibly comp, possibly workplace policy) to make the hire you want.</p><p>The longer you aren’t thinking about <em>what</em> to give up, the more you’re implicitly choosing to give up time, the thing startups treasure more than anything else. And you’re giving up time to - what, play it safe?</p><p>The default outcome for a startup is always failure. You took a risk by even starting one. You ship things that might be broken all the time, <strong>because you know that speed is more important than perfection</strong>. You take moonshots, because you know that big wins matter more than small losses. And then you give up months of time because you refuse to apply the same philosophy to hiring!</p><p>I run a recruiting company. It’s no skin off my back if you want to be irrational about hiring. Please, by all means, continue. You’re leaving a thousand great engineers to sit in my database instead of your ATS, and I would much rather you pay me 40 grand to find them than find them yourself.</p><p>Or you can act like the scrappy realist you probably like to think you are, stop insisting on perfection, and move fast.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto">A scalar is a single numerical quantity, most often taken from the real numbers, denoted by <math-renderer data-run-id="8c1bbf06f299f9f1a5fd03b84f361f2a">$\mathbb{R}$</math-renderer>. Scalars are
the fundamental building blocks of arithmetic: they can be added, subtracted, multiplied, and, except in the case of
zero, divided. In linear algebra, scalars play the role of coefficients, scaling factors, and entries of larger
structures such as vectors and matrices. They provide the weights by which more complex objects are measured and
combined. A vector is an ordered collection of scalars, arranged either in a row or a column. When the scalars are real
numbers, the vector is said to belong to <em>real</em> <math-renderer data-run-id="8c1bbf06f299f9f1a5fd03b84f361f2a">$n$</math-renderer>-dimensional space, written</p>
<p dir="auto"><math-renderer data-run-id="8c1bbf06f299f9f1a5fd03b84f361f2a">$$
\mathbb{R}^n = { (x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n) \mid x_i \in \mathbb{R} }.
$$</math-renderer></p>
<p dir="auto">An element of <math-renderer data-run-id="8c1bbf06f299f9f1a5fd03b84f361f2a">$\mathbb{R}^n$</math-renderer> is called a vector of dimension <math-renderer data-run-id="8c1bbf06f299f9f1a5fd03b84f361f2a">$n$</math-renderer> or an <em>n</em>-vector. The number <math-renderer data-run-id="8c1bbf06f299f9f1a5fd03b84f361f2a">$n$</math-renderer> is called the
dimension of the vector space. Thus <math-renderer data-run-id="8c1bbf06f299f9f1a5fd03b84f361f2a">$\mathbb{R}^2$</math-renderer> is the space of all ordered pairs of real numbers, <math-renderer data-run-id="8c1bbf06f299f9f1a5fd03b84f361f2a">$\mathbb{R}^3$</math-renderer> the
space of all ordered triples, and so on.</p>
<p dir="auto">Example 1.1.1.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>A 2-dimensional vector: <math-renderer data-run-id="8c1bbf06f299f9f1a5fd03b84f361f2a">$(3, -1) \in \mathbb{R}^2$</math-renderer>.</li>
<li>A 3-dimensional vector: <math-renderer data-run-id="8c1bbf06f299f9f1a5fd03b84f361f2a">$(2, 0, 5) \in \mathbb{R}^3$</math-renderer>.</li>
<li>A 1-dimensional vector: <math-renderer data-run-id="8c1bbf06f299f9f1a5fd03b84f361f2a">$(7) \in \mathbb{R}^1$</math-renderer>, which corresponds to the scalar <math-renderer data-run-id="8c1bbf06f299f9f1a5fd03b84f361f2a">$7$</math-renderer> itself.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Vectors are often written vertically in column form, which emphasizes their role in matrix multiplication:</p>

\mathbf{v} = \begin{bmatrix} 2 \ 0 \ 5 \end{bmatrix} \in \mathbb{R}^3.

<p dir="auto">In <math-renderer data-run-id="8c1bbf06f299f9f1a5fd03b84f361f2a">$\mathbb{R}^2$</math-renderer>, a vector <math-renderer data-run-id="8c1bbf06f299f9f1a5fd03b84f361f2a">$(x_1, x_2)$</math-renderer> can be visualized as an arrow starting at the origin <math-renderer data-run-id="8c1bbf06f299f9f1a5fd03b84f361f2a">$(0,0)$</math-renderer> and ending at the
point <math-renderer data-run-id="8c1bbf06f299f9f1a5fd03b84f361f2a">$(x_1, x_2)$</math-renderer>. Its length corresponds to the distance from the origin, and its orientation gives a direction in the
plane. In <math-renderer data-run-id="8c1bbf06f299f9f1a5fd03b84f361f2a">$\mathbb{R}^3$</math-renderer>, the same picture extends into three dimensions: a vector is an arrow from the origin
to <math-renderer data-run-id="8c1bbf06f299f9f1a5fd03b84f361f2a">$(x_1, x_2, x_3)$</math-renderer>. Beyond three dimensions, direct visualization is no longer possible, but the algebraic rules of
vectors remain identical. Even though we cannot draw a vector in <math-renderer data-run-id="8c1bbf06f299f9f1a5fd03b84f361f2a">$\mathbb{R}^{10}$</math-renderer>, it behaves under addition, scaling,
and transformation exactly as a 2- or 3-dimensional vector does. This abstract point of view is what allows linear
algebra to apply to data science, physics, and machine learning, where data often lives in very high-dimensional spaces.
Thus a vector may be regarded in three complementary ways:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>As a point in space, described by its coordinates.</li>
<li>As a displacement or arrow, described by a direction and a length.</li>
<li>As an abstract element of a vector space, whose properties follow algebraic rules independent of geometry.</li>

<p dir="auto">Scalars and vectors form the atoms of linear algebra. Every structure we will build-vector spaces, linear
transformations, matrices, eigenvalues-relies on the basic notions of number and ordered collection of numbers. Once
vectors are understood, we can define operations such as addition and scalar multiplication, then generalize to
subspaces, bases, and coordinate systems. Eventually, this framework grows into the full theory of linear algebra, with
powerful applications to geometry, computation, and data.</p>

<p dir="auto">Vectors in linear algebra are not static objects; their power comes from the operations we can perform on them. Two

<p dir="auto">Matrix multiplication is the core mechanism of linear algebra: it encodes how transformations combine, how systems of
equations are solved, and how data flows in modern algorithms. Addition and scalar multiplication make matrices into a
vector space, while multiplication gives them an algebraic structure rich enough to model geometry, computation, and
networks.</p>

<p dir="auto">Rank is a measure of independence: it tells us how many truly distinct equations or directions are present. Consistency
explains when equations align versus when they contradict. These concepts connect linear systems to vector spaces and
prepare for the ideas of dimension, basis, and the Rank–Nullity Theorem.</p>

on the basis, but its geometric identity is unchanged.</p>

<p dir="auto">Coordinates turn abstract vectors into concrete numerical data. Changing basis is the algebraic language for rotations
of axes, diagonalization of matrices, and principal component analysis in data science. Mastery of coordinates is
essential for moving fluidly between geometry, algebra, and computation.</p>

it distorts space, and whether it flips orientation. This geometric insight makes the determinant indispensable in
analysis, geometry, and applied mathematics.</p>

<p dir="auto">Linear algebra provides the foundation for many data science techniques. Two of the most important are dimensionality
reduction, where high-dimensional datasets are compressed while preserving essential information, and the least squares
method, which underlies regression and model fitting.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Dimensionality Reduction</h3><a id="user-content-dimensionality-reduction" aria-label="Permalink: Dimensionality Reduction" href="#dimensionality-reduction"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">High-dimensional data often contains redundancy: many features are correlated, meaning the data essentially lies near a
lower-dimensional subspace. Dimensionality reduction identifies these subspaces.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">PCA (Principal Component Analysis):
As introduced earlier, PCA diagonalizes the covariance matrix of the data.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Eigenvectors (principal components) define orthogonal directions of maximum variance.</li>
<li>Eigenvalues measure how much variance lies along each direction.</li>
<li>Keeping only the top <math-renderer data-run-id="8c1bbf06f299f9f1a5fd03b84f361f2a">$k$</math-renderer> components reduces data from <math-renderer data-run-id="8c1bbf06f299f9f1a5fd03b84f361f2a">$n$</math-renderer>-dimensional space to <math-renderer data-run-id="8c1bbf06f299f9f1a5fd03b84f361f2a">$k$</math-renderer>-dimensional space while

<p dir="auto">Example 10.2.1. A dataset of 1000 images, each with 1024 pixels, may have most variance captured by just 50 eigenvectors

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2025/9/2/passkeys/">https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2025/9/2/passkeys/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45103065">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
  

  
  <p data-date="2025-09-02T00:00:00">written on September 02, 2025</p>
  

  <p>There is an ongoing trend in the industry to move people away from username and
password towards <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAuthn">passkeys</a>.  The
intentions here are good, and I would assume that this has a significant net
benefit for the average consumer.  At the same time, the underlying standard
has some peculiarities.  These enable behaviors by large corporations,
employers, and governments that are worth thinking about.</p>
<h2>Attestations</h2>
<p>One potential source of problems here is the attestation system.  It allows the
authenticator to provide more information about what it is to the website that
you’re authenticating with.  In particular it is what tells a website if you
have a Yubikey plugged in versus something like 1password.  This is the
mechanism by which the Austrian government, for instance, prevents you from
using an Open Source or any other software-based authenticator to sign in to do
your taxes, access medical records or do anything else that is protected by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_identification">eID</a>.  Instead you
have to buy a <a href="https://www.id-austria.gv.at/de/hilfe/hilfe-zu-ida/authentifizierungsfaktoren#header-welche_fido_sicherheitsschlussel_sind_mit_id_austria_kompatibel_und_wo_sind_sie_erhaltlich-qbvpmo">whitelisted hardware
token</a>.</p>
<p>Attestations themselves are not used by software authenticators today, or
anything that syncs.  Both Apple and Google do not expose attestation data in
their own software authenticators (Keychain and Google Authenticator) for
consumer passkeys.  However, they will pass through attestation data from
hardware tokens just fine.  Both of them also, to the best of my knowledge,
expose attestation data for enterprises through Mobile Device Management.</p>
<p>One could make the argument that it is unlikely that attestation data will be
used at scale to create vendor lock-in.  However, I’m not sufficiently
convinced that this won’t create sub-ecosystems where we see exactly that
happening.  If for no other reason, this API exists and it has already been
used to restrict keys for governmental sign-in systems.</p>
<h2>Auth Lock-in</h2>
<p>One slightly more concerning issue today is that there is effectively no way to
export private keys between authentication password managers.  You need to
enroll all of your ecosystems individually into a password manager.  An attempt
by an open source password manager to reveal private keys to the user was ruled
insecure and <a href="https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc/issues/10407#issuecomment-1994299617">should not be
supported</a>.
This taking away agency from the user is not an accident.  You can also see this
with the passkey export specification which comes <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/specs/cx/cxp-v1.0-wd-20241003.html">with a
protocol</a> that,
while enabling exports in principle, encourages a system to system transfer
that does not hand over the user’s credentials to the user. <sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">1</a></sup></p>
<p>This might be for good intentions, but it also creates problems.  As someone
recently trying to leave the Apple ecosystem step by step, I have noticed how
many services are now bound to an iCloud-based passkey.  Particularly when it
comes to Apple, this fear is not entirely unwarranted.  Sign-in with Apple
using non-shared email addresses makes it very hard to migrate to Android
unless you retain an iCloud subscription.</p>
<p>Obviously, one could pay for an authenticator like 1Password, which at least is
ecosystem independent.  However, not everybody is in a situation where they can
afford to pay for basic services like password managers.</p>
<h2>Sneaky Onboarding</h2>
<p>One reason why passkeys are adopted so well today is because it happens
automatically for many.  I discovered that non-technical family members now all
have passkeys for some services, and they did not even notice doing that.  A
notable example is Amazon.  After every sign-in, it attempts to enroll you into
a passkey automatically without clear notification.  It just brings up the
fingerprint prompt, and users will instinctively touch it.</p>
<p>If you use different types of devices to authenticate — for instance, a Windows
and an iOS device — you may eventually have both authenticators associated.
This now covers the devices you already use.  However, it can make moving to a
completely different ecosystem later much harder.</p>
<h2>We Are Run By Corporations</h2>
<p>For many years already, people lose access to their Google account every day
and can never regain it.  Google is well known for terminating accounts without
stating any reasons.  With that comes the loss of access to your data.  In this
case, you also lose your credentials for third-party websites.</p>
<p>There is no legal recourse for this and no mechanism for appeal.  You just have
to hope that you’re a good citizen and not doing anything that would upset
Google’s account flagging systems.</p>
<p>As a sufficiently technical person, you might weigh the risks, but others will
not.  Many years ago, I tried to help another family gain access to their
child’s Facebook account after they passed away.  Even then, it was a
bureaucratic nightmare where there was little support by Facebook to make it
happen.  There is a real risk that access becomes much harder for families.
This is particularly true in situations where someone is incapacitated or dead.
The more we move away from basic authentication systems, the worse this
becomes.  It’s also really inconvenient when you are not on your own devices.
Signing into my accounts on my children’s devices has turned from a
straightforward process to an incredibly frustrating experience.  I find myself
juggling all kinds of different apps and flows.</p>
<h2>Complexity and Gatekeepers Everywhere</h2>
<p>Every once in a while, I find myself in a situation where I have very little
foundation to build on.  This is mostly just because of a hobby.  I like to see
how things work and build them from scratch.  Increasingly, that has become
harder.  Many username and password authentication schemes have been replaced
with OAuth sign-ins over the years.  Nowadays, some services are moving towards
passkeys, though most places do not enforce these yet.  If you want to build an
operating system from scratch, or even just build a client yourself, you often
find yourself needing to do a lot of yak-shaving.  All this work is necessary
just to get basic things working.</p>
<p>I think this is at least something to be wary of.  It doesn’t mean that bad
things will necessarily happen, but there is potential for loss of individual
agency.</p>
<p>An accelerated version of this has been seen with email.  Accessing your own
personal IMAP account from Google today has been significantly restricted under
security arguments.  Getting OAuth credentials that can access someone’s IMAP
accounts with their approval has become increasingly harder.  It is also very
costly.</p>
<p>Username and password authentication has largely been removed.  Even the
app-specific passwords on Google are now entirely undocumented.  They are no
longer exposed in the settings unless you <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords">know the
link</a> <sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">2</a></sup>.</p>
<h2>What Does Any Of This Mean?</h2>
<p>I don’t know.  I am both a user of passkeys and generally wary of making myself
overly dependent on tech giants and complex solutions.  I’m noticing an
increased reliance and potential loss of access to my own data.  This does
abstractly concern me.  Not to the degree that it changes anything I’m doing,
but still.  As annoying as managing usernames and passwords was, I don’t think
I have ever spent so much time authenticating on a daily basis.  The systems
that we now need to interface with for authentication are vast and
complex.</p>
<p>This might just be the path we’re going.  However, it is also one where we
maybe want to reflect a little bit on whether this is really what we want.</p>
<p><em>Edit: I reworded the statement about pass key exports to not misrepresent
the original comment on GitHub.</em></p>

<p>The front page of Imgur, a popular image hosting and social media site, is full of pictures of <a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/you-business-daddy-OWhCH26?ref=404media.co"><u>John Oliver</u></a> raising his middle finger and telling MediaLab AI, the site’s parent company, “fuck you.” Imgurians, as the site’s users call themselves, telling their <a href="https://deadline.com/2023/04/john-oliver-dings-business-daddy-warner-bros-discovery-content-purge-hbo-max-rebrand-1235328069/?ref=404media.co"><u>business daddy</u></a> to go to hell is the end result of a years-long degradation of the website. The Imgur story is one a classic case of <a href="https://doctorow.medium.com/my-mcluhan-lecture-on-enshittification-ea343342b9bc?ref=404media.co"><u>enshitification</u></a>,</p>

<!--kg-card-end: html-->
<p>Imgur began life in 2009 when Ohio University student Alan Schaaf got tired of how hard it was to upload and host images on the internet. He created Imgur as a simple one stop shop for image hosting and the service took off. It was a place where people could host images they wanted to share across multiple services and became ubiquitous on sites like Reddit.</p><p>As the internet evolved, most of the rest of the internet got its act together and platforms built their own image sharing infrastructure and people used Imgur less. But the site still had a community of millions of people who shared images to the site every day. It was a social media&nbsp; based around images and upvotes, with its own in-jokes, memes, and norms.</p><p>In 2021, a media holding company called <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22697957/imgur-acquisition-medialab-kik-genius-whisper-worldstarhiphop?ref=404media.co"><u>MediaLab AI acquired Imgur</u></a> and Schaaf left. MediaLab AI also owns Genius and World Star and on its website, the company <a href="https://www.medialab.la/?ref=404media.co"><u>bills itself as a place</u></a> where advertisers can “reach audiences at scale, on platforms that build community and influence culture.”</p><p>The community and culture of Imgur, which MedialLab AI <a href="https://www.medialab.la/brands?ref=404media.co"><u>claims is 41 million strong</u></a>, is pissed.</p><p>For the last few days, the front page of Imgur (which cultivates the day’s “most viral posts”) has been full of anti MediaLab AI sentiment. Imgurian <a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/know-meme-WCZM0EP?ref=404media.co"><u>VoidForScreaming posted </u></a>the first instance of the John Oliver meme several days ago, and it’s become a favorite of the community, but there are also calls to <a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/techs-business-daddys-server-room-when-yet-another-intergalactic-quality-gif-is-posted-within-minutes-of-each-other-MYbeZNw?ref=404media.co"><u>flood the servers and crash the site</u></a>, and a <a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/grievances-indictment-SGiEwIE?ref=404media.co"><u>list of grievances</u></a> Imgurians broadly agree brought them to the place they’re in now.</p><p>GhostTater, a longtime Imgurian, told me that the protest was about a confluence of things including a breakdown of the basic features of the site and the disappearance of human moderators.&nbsp;</p><p>“The moderators on Imgur have always been active members of the community. Many were effectively public figures, and their sudden group absence was immediately noticed,” he said. “Several very well-known mods posted generic departure messages, smelling strongly of Legal Department approval. These mods had many friends and acquaintances on the site, and while some are still visiting the site as users, they have gone completely silent.”</p><p>A former Imgur employee who spoke with 404 Media on the condition that we preserve their anonymity because they’re afraid of retaliation from MediaLab AI said that several people on the Imgur team were laid off without notice. Others were moved to MediaLab’s internal teams. “To the best of my knowledge, no employees are remaining solely focused on Imgur. Imgur's social media has been silent for a month,” the employee said. “As far as I am aware, the dedicated part-time moderation team was laid off sometime in the last 8 months, including the full-time moderation manager.”</p><p>Imgurians are convinced that MediaLab AI has replaced those moderators with unreliable AI systems. <a href="https://www.medialab.la/community-content-policy?ref=404media.co"><u>The Community &amp; Content Policy</u></a> on MediaLab AI’s website says it employs human&nbsp; moderators but also uses AI technologies. A common post in the past few days is Imgurians sharing the weird things they’ve been banned for, including one <a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/Y3dR5i0/comment/2472538895?ref=404media.co"><u>who made the comment</u></a> “tell me more” under a post and others who’ve seen their John Olivers removed.</p><p>“There were no humans responding to appeals or concerns,” GhostTater said. “Once the protest started, many users complained about posts being deleted and suspensions or bans being handed out when those posts were critical of MediaLab but not in violation of the written rules.”</p><p>But this isn’t just about bad moderation. Multiple posts on Imgur also called out the breakdown of the site’s basic functionality. GhostTater told me he’d personally experienced the broken notification system and repeated failures of images to upload. “The big one (to me) is the fact that hosted video wouldn’t play for viewers who were not logged in to Imgur,” he said. “The site began as an image hosting site, a place to upload your images and get a link, so that one could share images.”</p><p>MediaLab AI did not respond to 404 Media’s request for comment. “MediaLab’s presence has seemed to many users to fall somewhere between casual institutional indifference and ruthless mechanization. Many report, and resent, feeling explicitly harvested for profit,” GhostTater said.</p><p>Like all companies, MediaLab AI is driven by profit. It makes money as a media holding company, scooping up popular websites and plastering them with ads. It also owns the lyrics sharing site Genius and the once-influential WorldStarHipHop. It’s also being <a href="https://www.forbes.com.au/news/innovation/medialab-bought-up-imgur-genius-and-amino-why-are-they-suing/?ref=404media.co"><u>sued by many</u></a> of the people it bought these sites from, including Imgur’s founder. Schaaf and others have accused MediaLab AI of withholding payments owed to them as part of the sales deals they made.</p><p>The John Olivers and other protest memes keep flowing. Some have set up alternative image sharing sites. “There is a movement rattling around in User Submitted calling for a boycott day, suggesting that all users stay off the site on September first,” GhostTater said. “It has some steam, but we will have to see if it gets enough buy-in to make an impact.”</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://dynomight.net/liking/">https://dynomight.net/liking/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45102512">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
    <p>Here’s one possible hobby:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Take something you don’t like.</li>
  <li><em>Try</em> to like it.</li>
</ol>

<p>It could be food or music or people or just the general situation you’re in. I recommend this hobby, partly because it’s nice to enjoy things, but mostly as an instrument for probing human nature.</p>

<h2 id="1">1.</h2>

<p>I was in Paris once. By coincidence, I wandered past a bunch of places that were playing Michael Jackson. I thought to myself, “Huh. The French sure do like Michael Jackson.” Gradually I decided, “You know what? They’re right! Michael Jackson is good.” Later, I saw a guy driving around blasting <em>Billy Jean</em> while hanging a hand outside his car with a sparkly white Michael Jackson glove. Again, I thought, “Huh.” That day was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Michael_Jackson">June 25, 2009</a>.</p>

<h2 id="2">2.</h2>

<p>I don’t like cooked spinach. But if I eat some and try to forget that I hate it, it seems OK. Why?</p>

<p>Well, as a child, I was subjected to some misguided spinach-related parental interventions. (“You cannot leave this table until you’ve finished this extremely small portion”, etc.) I hated this, but looking back, it wasn’t the innate qualities of spinach the bothered me, so much as that being forced to put something inside my body felt like a violation of my autonomy.</p>

<p>When I encountered spinach as an adult, instead of tasting a vegetable, I tasted a grueling battle of will. Spinach was dangerous—if I liked it, that would teach my parents that they were right to control my diet.</p>

<p>So I tried telling myself little stories: I’m hiking in the mountains in Japan when suddenly the temperature drops, and it starts pouring rain. Freezing and desperate, I spot a monastery and knock on the door. The monks warm me up and offer me <em>hōrensō no ohitashi</em>, made from some exotic vegetable I’ve never seen before. Presumably, I’d think it was amazing.</p>

<p>I can’t fully access that mind-space. But just knowing it exists seems to make a big difference. Using similar techniques, I’ve successfully made myself like (or less dislike) white wine, disco, yoga, non-spicy food, Ezra Klein, Pearl Jam, and Studio Ghibli movies.</p>

<p>Lesson: Sometimes we dislike things simply because we have a <em>concept</em> of ourselves as not liking them.</p>

<h2 id="3">3.</h2>

<p>Meanwhile, I’ve failed to make myself like country music. I mean, I like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOHPuY88Ry4"><em>A Boy Named Sue</em></a>. Who doesn’t? But what about <em>Stand By Your Man</em> or <em>Dust on the Bottle</em>? I listen to these, and I appreciate what they’re doing. I admire that they aren’t entirely oriented around the concerns of teenagers. But I can’t seem to actually enjoy them.</p>

<p>Of course, it seems unlikely that this is unrelated to the fact that no one in my peer group thinks country music is cool. On the other hand, I’m constantly annoyed that my opinions aren’t more unique or interesting. And I subscribe to the idea that what’s <em>really</em> cool is to be a cultural omnivore who appreciates everything.</p>

<p>It doesn’t matter. I still can’t like country music. I <em>think</em> the problem is that I don’t actually want to like country music. I only <em>want</em> to want to like country music. The cultural programming is in too deep.</p>

<p>Lesson: Certain levels of the subconscious are easier to screw around with than others.</p>

<h2 id="4">4.</h2>

<p>For years, a friend and I would go on week-long hikes. Before we started, we’d go make our own trail mix, and I’d always insist on adding raisins. Each year, my friend would object more loudly that I don’t actually like raisins. But I do like raisins. So I’d scoff. But after several cycles, I had to admit that while I “liked raisins”, there never came a time that I actually wanted to <em>eat</em> raisins, ever.</p>

<p>Related: Once every year or two, I’ll have a rough day, and I’ll say to myself, “OK, screw it. Liking Oasis is the lamest thing that has ever been done by anyone. But the dirty truth is that I love Oasis. So I will listen to Oasis and thereby be comforted.” Then I listen to Oasis, and it just isn’t that good.</p>

<p>Lesson: You can have an incorrect concept of self.</p>

<h2 id="5">5.</h2>

<p>I don’t like this about myself, but I’m a huge snob regarding television. I believe TV can be true art, as high as any other form. (How does <em>My Brilliant Friend</em> only have an 89 on Metacritic?) But even after pretentiously filtering for critical acclaim, I usually feel that most shows are slop and can’t watch them.</p>

<p>At first glance, this seems just like country music—I don’t like it because of status-driven memetic desire or whatever. But there’s a difference. Not liking country music is fine (neurotic self-flagellation aside) because there’s an infinite amount of other music. But not liking most TV is really annoying, because often I <em>want</em> to watch TV, but can’t find anything acceptable.</p>

<p>I see three possible explanations:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Almost all TV is, in fact, bad.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Lots of TV is fine, but just doesn’t appeal to me.</p>

    <p>Lots of TV is fine, but it’s hard to tell yourself stories where you’re hiking in the mountains and a bunch of Japanese monks show you, like, <em>Big Bang Theory</em>.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Whatever it is, it seems hard to change.</p>

<p>Lesson: Some things are hard to change.</p>

<h2 id="6">6.</h2>

<p>On planes, the captain will often invite you to, “sit back and enjoy the ride”. This is confusing. Enjoy the ride? Enjoy being trapped in a pressurized tube and jostled by all the passengers lining up to relieve themselves because your company decided to cram in a few more seats instead of having an adequate number of toilets? Aren’t flights supposed to be endured?</p>

<p>At the same time, those invitations seem like a glimpse of a parallel universe. Are there members of my species who sit back and enjoy flights?</p>

<p>I have no hard data. But it’s a good heuristic that there are people “who actually X” for approximately all values of X. If one in nine people enjoy <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/joor.13305">going to the dentist</a>, surely at least that many enjoy being on planes.</p>

<p>What I think the captain is trying to say is, “While you can’t always control your situation, you have tremendous power over how you <em>experience</em> that situation. You may find a cramped flight to be a torture. But the torture happens inside your head. Some people like your situation. You too, perhaps could like it.”</p>

<p>That’s an important message. Though one imagines that giving it as an in-flight announcement would cause more confusion, not less. So the captain does what they can.</p>

<p>Hold on to your helper methods – RubyMine is now FREE for non-commercial use! Whether you’re learning Ruby and Rails, pushing open-source forward, creating dev content, or building your passion project, we want to make sure you have the tools to enjoy what you do even more… for free.</p>


    







<h2>Another chapter in the story</h2>



<p>We recently introduced a <a href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/blog/2024/10/24/webstorm-and-rider-are-now-free-for-non-commercial-use/">new licensing model</a> for WebStorm, RustRover, Rider, and CLion – making them free for non-commercial use. RubyMine is now joining the party! For commercial use, our existing licensing model still applies.</p>



<h2>Why are we doing this?</h2>



<p>We believe developers do their best work when the right tools are accessible. We’ve been listening closely to the Ruby and Rails community – their feedback, success, challenges, and passion for building with joy. Now, we’re making a change that reflects what we’ve heard.</p>



<p>By making RubyMine free for non-commercial use, we hope to lower the barrier to starting and help more people write clean, confident Ruby code from day one. It’s our way of supporting the unique Ruby community – from those who choose Ruby for their projects to maintainers of gems and frameworks who contribute to the Ruby ecosystem. Whether you’re debugging at midnight, crafting clever DSLs, or launching your first Rails app, RubyMine is here to help you build smarter (and crash less).</p>



<h2>Commercial vs. non-commercial use</h2>



<p>As defined in the <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/legal/docs/toolbox/license_non-commercial/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Toolbox Subscription Agreement for Non-Commercial Use</a>, commercial use means developing products and earning commercial benefits from your activities. However, certain categories are explicitly excluded from this definition. Common examples of non-commercial uses include learning and self-education, open-source contributions without earning commercial benefits, any form of content creation, and hobby development.</p>



<p>It’s important to note that, if you’re using a non-commercial license, you cannot opt out of the collection of anonymous usage statistics. We use this information to improve our products. The data we collect is exclusively that of anonymous feature usages of our IDEs. It is focused on what actions are performed and what types of functionality of the IDE are used. We do not collect any other data. This is similar to our Early Access Program (EAP) and is in compliance with our Privacy Policy.</p>



<h2>FAQ</h2>



<p>Below are answers to the most common questions. Check out the <a href="https://sales.jetbrains.com/hc/en-gb/articles/18950890312210-The-free-non-commercial-licensing-FAQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>full FAQ</strong></a> for more information.</p>



<h3>Licensing</h3>



<h4>What features are included under the free license?</h4>



<p>With the new non-commercial license type, you can enjoy a full-featured IDE that is identical to its paid version. The only difference is in the Code With Me feature – you get <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/code-with-me/buy/?section=personal&amp;billing=monthly" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Code With Me Community</a> with your free license.</p>



<h4>Which license should I choose if I want to use RubyMine for both non-commercial and commercial projects?</h4>



<p>If you intend to use RubyMine for commercial development for which you will receive direct or indirect commercial advantage or monetary compensation within the meaning of the definitions provided in the <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/legal/docs/toolbox/license_non-commercial/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Toolbox Subscription Agreement for Non-Commercial Use</a>, you will need to purchase a commercial subscription (either individual or organizational). This license can then also be used for non-commercial development.</p>



<h4>How do renewals and upgrades work now?</h4>



<p>Non-commercial subscriptions are issued for one year and will automatically renew after that. However, for the renewal to happen, you must have used the assigned license at least once during the last 6 months of the subscription period. If it has been more than 6 months since you last used an IDE activated with this type of license and the renewal did not occur automatically, you can request a new non-commercial subscription again at any time.</p>



<h4>Am I eligible for a refund if I’ve already bought a paid subscription but do non-commercial development?</h4>



<p>If you’re unsure whether you qualify for a refund, you’ll find full details of our policy <a href="https://sales.jetbrains.com/hc/en-gb/articles/115000913704-How-can-I-get-a-refund" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. Please note that if you also work on projects that qualify as commercial usage, you can’t use the free license for them.</p>



<h3>Anonymous data collection&nbsp;</h3>



<h4>Does my IDE send any data to JetBrains?</h4>



<p>The terms of the non-commercial agreement assume that the product may also electronically send JetBrains anonymized statistics (IDE telemetry) related to your usage of the product’s features. This information may include but is not limited to frameworks, file templates used in the product, actions invoked, and other interactions with the product’s features. This information does not contain personal data.</p>



<h4>Is there a way to opt out of sending anonymized statistics?</h4>



<p>We appreciate that this might not be convenient for everyone, but there is unfortunately no way to opt out of sending anonymized statistics to JetBrains under the terms of the Toolbox agreement for non-commercial use. The only way to opt out is by switching to either a paid subscription or one of the complimentary options mentioned <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/store/?section=students&amp;billing=yearly" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>



<h3>Getting a non-commercial subscription&nbsp;</h3>



<h4>What should I do to apply for this subscription?&nbsp;</h4>



<p>It can be easily done right inside your IDE:</p>



<ol>
<li>Install RubyMine and run it.</li>



<li>Upon startup, there will be a license dialog box where you can choose the <em>Non-commercial use </em>option.</li>



<li>Log in to your JetBrains account or create a new one.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Accept the <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/legal/docs/toolbox/license_non-commercial/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Toolbox Subscription Agreement for Non-Commercial Use</a>.</li>



<li>Enjoy development in your IDE.</li>
</ol>



<p>If you’ve already started a trial period or have activated your IDE using a paid license, you still can switch to a non-commercial subscription by following these steps:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to <em>Help | Register.</em></li>



<li>In the window that opens, click on the <em>Deactivate License</em> button.</li>



<li>Choose <em>Non-commercial use.</em></li>



<li>Log in to your JetBrains account or create a new one.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Accept the <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/legal/docs/toolbox/license_non-commercial/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Toolbox Subscription Agreement for Non-Commercial Use</a>.</li>



<li>Enjoy development in your IDE.</li>
</ol>



<h4>I don’t see the <em>Non-commercial use</em> option in my IDE. What should I do?&nbsp;</h4>



<p>The most likely explanation for this is that you’re using an older version of RubyMine. Unfortunately, we don’t support obtaining the non-commercial license for any releases prior to RubyMine 2025.2.1.</p>



<p>That’s it for today! If you don’t find an answer to your question, feel free to leave a comment or contact us at <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/support/sales/#email-sales" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sales@jetbrains.com</a>.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p><span>Toronto has one of the world’s great commercial </span><a href="https://www.worksinprogress.news/p/notes-on-progress-an-englishman-in" rel="">downtowns</a><span>. Two metro lines, eight suburban heavy railways, an extensive bus system, a highway, and North America’s greatest surviving tram network all converge on a tiny area by the shores of Lake Ontario. Hundreds of thousands of commuters pour into the downtown every day, filling the great towers that line its nineteenth-century streets.</span></p><p>As with many downtowns, this causes congestion. Streets and pavements are thronged at peak times. Bicycles, pedestrians, cars, trams and buses compete for scarce space. As with all traditional radial transport systems, there is an enormous concentration of movement in a tiny area. Pedestrians make slow progress across the urban fabric, stopping every block for a minute or two to wait to cross the road.</p><p>In the early twentieth century, Toronto’s businesses developed a novel response to this. They began to create pedestrian tunnels from their offices to the metro stations so that their employees could flow in smoothly, avoiding the congested streets (and, in winter, the cold). Shops quickly started to be added. After a few businesses had done this, a ‘network effect’ emerged whereby other businesses started to add their own tunnels to the system, benefiting from the existing tunnels while also making them more useful. It became routine for downtown developers to tie new office blocks into the network. Over many decades, a sort of ‘pedestrian metro’ emerged.</p><p><span>Known as the Path, the network today stretches for more than 30 kilometers, linking nearly all central metro and railway stations with many of the major office buildings. Although the Path forms a unified network, it is </span><em>not </em><span>in </span><a href="https://www.worksinprogress.news/p/the-fewer-the-merrier" rel="">unified ownership</a><span>: it is divided into </span><a href="https://www.toronto.ca/explore-enjoy/visitor-toronto/path-torontos-downtown-pedestrian-walkway/" rel="">some 35 chunks</a><span>, each of which is still owned and managed separately by descendants of whichever business originally contributed it. Many branches of the Path thus terminate in the lobbies of office buildings, with the curious result that these grand spaces function as metro entrances for the general public. The municipal authorities play only a limited regulatory role.</span></p><p>The Path is unlike the gloomy and malodorous underpasses with which most of us are familiar. It is expensively decorated and feels like a high-end shopping mall, which in a way it is. It is extremely clean and closely policed by dozens of private security teams. Until recently, it was thronged with shoppers: this use suffered in the pandemic and has not wholly recovered, but the Path is still used for its original commuting purpose by hundreds of thousands of people every weekday.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Ktrw!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F263244c0-12ed-4243-b9c6-6aaa9ca4c53f_956x1270.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Ktrw!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F263244c0-12ed-4243-b9c6-6aaa9ca4c53f_956x1270.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Ktrw!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F263244c0-12ed-4243-b9c6-6aaa9ca4c53f_956x1270.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Ktrw!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F263244c0-12ed-4243-b9c6-6aaa9ca4c53f_956x1270.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Ktrw!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F263244c0-12ed-4243-b9c6-6aaa9ca4c53f_956x1270.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Ktrw!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F263244c0-12ed-4243-b9c6-6aaa9ca4c53f_956x1270.png" width="568" height="754.560669456067" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/263244c0-12ed-4243-b9c6-6aaa9ca4c53f_956x1270.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1270,&quot;width&quot;:956,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:568,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Ktrw!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F263244c0-12ed-4243-b9c6-6aaa9ca4c53f_956x1270.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Ktrw!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F263244c0-12ed-4243-b9c6-6aaa9ca4c53f_956x1270.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Ktrw!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F263244c0-12ed-4243-b9c6-6aaa9ca4c53f_956x1270.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Ktrw!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F263244c0-12ed-4243-b9c6-6aaa9ca4c53f_956x1270.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></div></a><figcaption>This is an underpass, but not quite as you know it. Image credit: Author’s collection.</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>Urbanists are normally sceptical about pedestrian tunnels, fearing that they kill off street life. This is a reasonable concern and may often be a decisive reason to avoid them. But in a downtown like Toronto’s, human density is so enormous that this worry seems exaggerated. The pavements of Toronto are still busy, even on weekends, despite hundreds of thousands of pedestrians going underground. The carriageways are still congested with vehicles. It is facile to see this as a simple trade-off between walking and driving. The Path frees up space for bicycles, buses and trams </span><a href="https://worksinprogress.co/issue/reclaiming-the-roads/" rel="">as well as cars</a><span>. It complements the metro and railway system by shaving off five minutes from the station-to-office walk. The Path may well be substantially net positive for a radial system of public and active transport.</span></p><p>The Path is also interesting for what it tells us about transport economics. It is exceptionally unusual in forming an integrated network without having been developed by a single body. The equivalent would be a railway that was created piecemeal by uncoordinated landowners, with each adding small chunks until it stretched from one city terminus to another – a thing which, to my knowledge, has never happened.</p><p><span>There are at least two reasons for the Path’s distinctive economics. First, pedestrian tunnels are clearly exceptionally valuable to individual landowners, such that they are prepared to bear the entire cost of providing transport infrastructure from which other landowners could subsequently benefit. It wasn’t necessary</span><em> </em><span>for the whole network to exist in order for the first landowners to get started: in downtown Toronto, pedestrian tunnels are </span><em>so good </em><span>that there was no first-mover problem. This is generally untrue of transport infrastructure: for example, any given stretch of a railway is virtually useless until the entire railway is finished, which is why public authorities usually have to plan entire railways from the start.</span></p><p><span>Second, pedestrian tunnels have an extremely high upper limit on how many people they can take. As </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=193616326869367" rel="">a famous 2003 advert illustrated</a><span>, a human travelling in a vehicle requires space for their vehicle as well as themselves. A human travelling by foot does not, and is thus much more spatially efficient. This means that additional chunks can be added to the Path without normally creating ‘pedestrian jams’ in the existing stretches: there is nearly always space for more people. This is often untrue for roads and railways, where planners constantly worry that adding additional branches will cause congestion on central trunks.</span></p><p><span>This means the Path’s model isn’t easily replicable for other transport modes: roads and railways really do need unified planning. But it isn’t clear why pedestrian metros should be impossible in other cities. In fact, to some extent, they do exist. </span><a href="https://www.torontofinancialdistrict.com/history" rel="">Montreal</a><span> has a similar system, while Tokyo, Osaka, Seoul, Hong Kong, Singapore and Houston have systems that resemble the Path in some respects. A few European cities also make considerable use of pedestrian tunnels, including Helsinki, Stockholm and Munich.</span></p><p>Overall, though, the list of pedestrian metros is short. It would be interesting to investigate why this is. Why aren’t there pedestrian metros in Manhattan, Boston, Shanghai, Vancouver, Paris and the City of London? Is there some reason why the economics are different? Is the soil already too full of tunnels and utilities? Or are there regulatory constraints that might, in principle, be fixable?</p><p><span>Downtowns were one of the great triumphs of nineteenth-century urbanism. Where they have not been destroyed by cars and </span><a href="https://worksinprogress.co/issue/making-architecture-easy/" rel="">modernism</a><span> and civic mismanagement, they remain enormously valuable urban forms today. But they present, and have always presented, unique and interesting </span><a href="https://worksinprogress.co/issue/the-magic-of-through-running/" rel="">transport problems</a><span>. Maybe pedestrian metros have a role to play in solving them.</span></p><p><em><span>Samuel is an editor at Works in Progress. He focuses on urbanism and cities.

<p>Peter Thiel, co-founder of PayPal, owner of the military technology companies Palantir and Anduril, an early investor in Facebook, the man who has openly declared since the 2000s that democracy is a mistake and that he wants to destroy the United States and European countries to establish city-states, each governed by a different corporation (fiefdoms), on our ruins, has always chosen his projects based on a clear political vision. Unlike other businessmen, Thiel is more of an activist than an investor. For example, PayPal was initially intended as an alternative to the American banking system to undermine and eventually overthrow the government; this is what attracted Thiel's attention to the project in the first place. Palantir, it seems to me, is no different.</p>

                <section>
                    <p>At this summer's HOPE conference, Joshua Aaron spoke about <a href="https://www.iceblock.app/" rel="noreferrer">ICEBlock</a>, his iPhone app that allows users to anonymously report ICE sightings within a 5 mile radius, and to get notifications when others report ICE sightings near them. You can see the full talk, and the lively/infuriating Q&amp;A, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/Pm4tC2Mnabs?t=22330s" rel="noreferrer">here</a>, starting at 6:12:10.</p><p>Thanks to repression from the highest levels of the Trump administration, his app has gone viral and garnered over a million downloads from the App Store. Karoline Leavitt <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/karoline-leavitt-accuses-cnn-encouraging-violence-against-agents-reports-new-ice-tracking-app" rel="noreferrer">called it</a> "an incitement of further violence against our ICE officers." Tom Homan <a href="https://xcancel.com/bennyjohnson/status/1939722973373497632" rel="noreferrer">said</a>, "DOJ needs to look at this and see if they're crossing that line." Kristi Noem <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/kirsti-noem-iceblock-deportation-immigration-app-2092878" rel="noreferrer">called the app</a> "obstruction of justice." Pam Bondi <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/attorney-general-pam-bondi-warns-iceblock-app-developer-watch-out-says-doj-looking-him" rel="noreferrer">announced</a> "we are looking at it, we are looking at him, and he better watch out, because that's not a protected speech." (Notifying people about ICE sightings is protected speech, no matter what the fascist Attorney General says.) Joshua and his family have been receiving threats.</p><p>But unfortunately, despite the app’s goal of protecting people from ICE, its viral success, and the state repression against it, ICEBlock has serious issues:</p><p>Most importantly, it wasn’t developed with input from people who actually defend immigrants from deportation. As a result, it doesn’t provide people with what they need to stay safe.</p><p>Because ICE sightings in the app aren’t verified in any way, it's likely that most reports in the app aren't actually ICE, even if they’re posted by people who mean well – as I describe below, the vast majority of ICE reports are false positives.</p><p>And judging by the App Store reviews, it’s clear that not everyone means well. One review says: “This is a great app for safety information. Unfortunately MAGA is now posting false information on there and making racist comments in the comment section.”</p><p>Joshua makes strong claims about the security and privacy of his app without backing any of them up with technical details. Many of his claims are false. He also chose to target only iOS, and not Android, because of a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/grapheneos.org/post/3lt2prfb2vk2r" rel="noreferrer">misunderstanding</a> about how Android push notifications work. And even worse, during the Q&amp;A, he made it clear that he didn't understand terms like “warrant canary,” "reverse engineering," or “security through obscurity,” which doesn't inspire confidence.</p><h2 id="privacy-promises-without-the-evidence">Privacy promises without the evidence</h2><p>When I first heard about ICEBlock, I liked the idea, but I – and others in various group chats I'm part of – were skeptical.</p><p>Joshua promises that ICE reports are "completely anonymous," that the app doesn't store any personal data, and that it's "impossible to trace reports back to individual users." These are bold claims that he hasn't backed up with evidence. Unlike reputable privacy tools, ICEBlock isn't open source (in the talk, he explicitly rejected the idea of open sourcing it or allowing the security community to help him improve it), and Joshua hasn't published a threat model or technical documentation explaining how his app keeps these promises.</p><p>My friend Cooper Quintin, a security researcher at EFF, was also skeptical of ICEBlock, and so he <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/cooperq.com/post/3ltzl5a7y5c2d" rel="noreferrer">reverse engineered it</a>, and spoke to 404 Media about <a href="https://www.404media.co/immigration-raid-tracking-app-ice-block-keeps-your-data-private-researcher-finds/" rel="noreferrer">his findings</a>. He largely confirmed Joshua's claims:</p><figure><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:t3zkzmz2242yi4rj4lwj7ux4/app.bsky.feed.post/3ltzl5bqmrs2d" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreiaadwar2akdnjfqolubdu4zhbfxxqvc6zz6ygxcxzdsbhz5pp7mji"><p lang="en">The TL;DR is that I didn't find anything suspicious, the app doesn't talk to any third parties, and it doesn't send your location to the developer. Neither your phone ID or iCloud account are associated with the requests the app sends to the apple cloud servers to run. (2/11)</p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:t3zkzmz2242yi4rj4lwj7ux4?ref_src=embed">Exploit Code Not People (@cooperq.com)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:t3zkzmz2242yi4rj4lwj7ux4/post/3ltzl5bqmrs2d?ref_src=embed">2025-07-15T18:52:15.697Z</a></blockquote></figure><p>This is great, and it's the reason that (despite his hostility towards transparency) I really do think that Joshua means well.</p><p>Even if we can trust that Joshua isn't collecting data himself, it's difficult to discern what Apple would be able to hand over if it got subpoenaed for data related to his app. The website simply says it's "completely anonymous," without any caveats.</p><p>But ignoring the lack of transparency, there's an even larger problem.</p><h2 id="iceblock-spreads-unverified-information-making-it-useless-for-defending-immigrants">ICEBlock spreads unverified information, making it useless for defending immigrants</h2><p>Local immigrant defense groups around the country have been defending people from deportation for the last decade or more. In a training with <a href="https://www.norcalresist.org/" rel="noreferrer">NorCal Resist</a>, I learned that when people post (and repost) unverified reports of ICE sightings on social media, <em>it does more harm than good</em>.</p><p>Millions of people are living in a state of fear. From my experience working with NorCal Resist, <em>most ICE sightings that people hear about aren't real, even when the person reporting it believes that they are.</em> It's common for someone to see a bunch of dudes in uniforms, or sketchy looking vans, and assume it's ICE, when it's actually something else. If I had to guess, I'd say about 98% of reports are false positives.</p><p><em>False reports encourage panic, which doesn't help anyone.</em> Meanwhile, what people actually need are <em>legal observers</em> – people to document the behavior of federal agents, and provide this evidence to their lawyers. They also need help with connecting families of kidnapped people with information and lawyers, and they need communities coming out to defend their neighbors.</p><p>When I asked Joshua about this during the Q&amp;A of his talk, he didn't answer the question. Here's my question and his non-answers:</p><figure data-kg-thumbnail="https://micahflee.com/content/media/2025/09/iceblock-clip1_thumb.jpg" data-kg-custom-thumbnail="">

        <img src="https://micahflee.com/content/media/2025/09/iceblock-clip1_thumb.jpg"></figure><p>Specifically, I asked:</p><blockquote>With my local group, they put a whole lot of energy into verifying every single report before spreading information about it. My question is, how do you know that ICEBlock isn't just full of false positives? And have you done any user research, or worked with local immigration groups to figure out how reliable this is, how much it's actually helping people versus causing panic?</blockquote><p>In an attempt to answer the question about user research, Joshua said, "No, we do not do any user data or metrics." He misunderstood the question, apparently thinking that I meant collecting data from users rather than talking to humans who know more than he does and incorporating their feedback into the design of the app.</p><p>He then explained what ICEBlock does to prevent <em>malicious</em> people from making false reports — including falsely claiming that it's "not possible" to make tons of simultaneous fake reports (more on this below).</p><p>ICEBlock doesn't verify anything, and instead <em>only</em> spreads unverified rumors. To be fair, verification is a <em>very hard problem</em>. In my local group, we have <a href="https://micahflee.com/using-signal-groups-for-activism/" rel="noreferrer">announcement-only Signal groups</a> full of volunteers who physically verify every single ICE sighting that's reported to our rapid response hotline. The vast majority of reports are false positives. There might be several reports a day, but actual ICE or CBP activity is much more rare. I've personally gone to check out maybe 10 to 15 different ICE sightings, only one of which turned out to be actual immigration enforcement (though by the time I got to the location, ICE had already left the area). None of these false reports were malicious: they were simply scared people who saw a bunch of vehicles and people in uniforms and reported an ICE sighting, when it was actually something else.</p><p>Another person in the audience asked a similar question:</p><blockquote>I'm wondering, I think someone asked earlier, if in the design of ICEBlock, or even now, are you currently working with immigrant communities to figure out what resources they need?</blockquote><figure data-kg-thumbnail="https://micahflee.com/content/media/2025/09/iceblock-clip2_thumb.jpg" data-kg-custom-thumbnail="">

        <img src="https://micahflee.com/content/media/2025/09/iceblock-clip2_thumb.jpg"></figure><p>His answer was that ICEBlock has been translated into many different languages. And that the community organizers he's spoken with told him that ICEBlock doesn't meet their needs. So, he decided to not worry about their feedback and do his own thing instead.</p><p><strong>If you want to support people who are actually protecting immigrants from deportation, please </strong><a href="https://www.norcalresist.org/make-a-donation.html" rel="noreferrer"><strong>donate to NorCal Resist</strong></a><strong> or your local community rapid response networks.</strong></p><h2 id="whats-gps-spoofing">What's GPS spoofing?</h2><p>When Joshua explained the safeguards against abuse in the app, he claimed that it's "not possible" to make 100 fake reports in a single morning, in part because you can only make reports within a 5 mile radius of your location. But apparently, Joshua has never heard of GPS spoofing.</p><p>Even though I'm sitting at my house in California right now, here's a screenshot I just took of the ICEBlock app from the Eiffel Tower in Paris. While I won't go into details of the masterful hacking skills that this took, I'll give you a hint: it's the same technique kids use to cheat at Pokemon Go.</p><figure><img src="https://micahflee.com/content/images/2025/09/IMG_0006.PNG" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1170" height="2532" srcset="https://micahflee.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/09/IMG_0006.PNG 600w, https://micahflee.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/09/IMG_0006.PNG 1000w, https://micahflee.com/content/images/2025/09/IMG_0006.PNG 1170w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>Screenshot of ICEBlock app, with GPS location spoofed to make it think I'm in Paris</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="make-iceblock-open-source-absolutely-not">Make ICEBlock open source? "Absolutely not."</h2><p>Someone asked whether Joshua would be interested in collaborating with the hacker community on ICEBlock, so they could provide him with advice and help him with feature development.</p><p>Joshua rejected the idea, saying that he believes that he'd need to completely trust anyone he collaborated with. "Believe me when I say I would love help. I'm supporting over a million users myself. There's not some giant company behind this," he said. "But it's really really hard for me to put my trust in somebody, and share the source code, and share the access to this."</p><figure data-kg-thumbnail="https://micahflee.com/content/media/2025/09/iceblock-clip4_thumb.jpg" data-kg-custom-thumbnail="">

        <img src="https://micahflee.com/content/media/2025/09/iceblock-clip4_thumb.jpg"></figure><p>This is, of course, not how secure software development works. The most widely trusted security and privacy tools that exist, like Signal and Tor, are open source, and they accept peer review and code contributions from the public.</p><p>The thing that makes this perfectly reasonable and safe is <em>code review</em>. If Joshua published the ICEBlock source code, experts in the hacker community could add features or fix bugs for him, and make pull requests with their changes. He could then carefully review the changes before merging them into his codebase. He could reject whatever changes he wants. You don't actually need to trust – or even know the identity of – hackers who help you develop software. This is a solved a problem, and Joshua seems utterly unaware of it.</p><p>My friend Jen Helsby, the CTO of Freedom of the Press Foundation and a SecureDrop developer, explicitly asked if he would be open to making ICEBlock open source.

        <img src="https://micahflee.com/content/media/2025/09/iceblock-clip5_thumb.jpg"></figure><p>Jen asked:</p><blockquote>There's a lot of secure software, that probably people in this room work on, that is developed in the open, and that is used primarily by at-risk users, including things like Tor, Signal, SecureDrop. That's great, because it makes it easy for folks to contribute. Maybe you don't want that, I understand that can be hard. But it also makes it easier for people to audit and gain assurance that the app is doing what you claim without having to have, you know, EFF reverse engineer it. Would you be open to making the app open source?</blockquote><p>His answer: "Absolutely not."</p><p>Why? "I don't want anybody from the government to have their hooks in how I'm doing what I'm doing. Once you go open source, everybody has access to it. So I'm just going to keep the codebase private at this time."</p><p>He also claimed that the government can't learn everything about how an app works by reverse engineering it, which isn't true.</p><p>I agree with Jen. His answers are very concerning.</p><h2 id="whats-security-through-obscurity">What's security through obscurity?</h2><p>Another person asked specifically how concealing the details of how the app works from the government is distinguishable from security through obscurity, Joshua agreed that security through obscurity is terrible... and denied that he's doing it?</p><figure data-kg-thumbnail="https://micahflee.com/content/media/2025/09/iceblock-clip6_thumb.jpg" data-kg-custom-thumbnail="">

        <img src="https://micahflee.com/content/media/2025/09/iceblock-clip6_thumb.jpg"></figure><p>In case you're not aware of this term, the first sentence of the Wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_through_obscurity" rel="noreferrer">article</a> on security through obscurity has a concise definition:</p><blockquote>In security engineering, <strong>security through obscurity</strong> is the practice of concealing the details or mechanisms of a system to enhance its security.</blockquote><p>NIST's <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/123/final" rel="noreferrer">General Guide to Server Security</a> lists "Open Design" as a core security principle, saying that, "System security should not depend on the secrecy of the implementation or its components."</p><p>Minutes before this, Joshua had just finishing explaining that he definitely won't open source his app because, "I don't want anybody from the government to have their hooks in how I'm doing what I'm doing."</p><p>He's implying that his code includes some "secret sauce" that, if it were made public, would make the app less secure, so he can't risk letting anyone discover how it works. This is the <em>definition</em> of security through obscurity.</p><h2 id="my-server-is-highly-secure-he-says-to-a-room-full-of-hackers">My server is "HIGHLY secure," he says to a room full of hackers</h2><p>Throughout the Q&amp;A, Joshua kept referencing the security of his server. At one point, he even said that he built it himself and it's "<em>HIGHLY</em> secure." He also assured the audience, "Trust me when I tell you, I think about <em>EVERYTHING</em> to the Nth degree."</p><p>It took about 20 minutes of digging around to discover that the server that hosts the iceblock.app website is running on Linode and also hosts the websites of several of Joshua's other projects, going back decades. This includes a website for his IT consulting business, his band, etc. If any one of those old websites gets hacked, it's possible that the hacker could more easily access ICEBlock data that's stored on the same server.</p><p>Without providing more details, I also discovered that his server is running outdated software with known vulnerabilities.</p><h2 id="whats-a-warrant-canary">What's a warrant canary?</h2><p>At one point, a lawyer asked some excellent legal questions:</p><blockquote>I'm curious if ICEBlock either currently or has intentions to implement something like a warrant canary or other method. And more generally, whether you have received anything like search warrants, or All Writs Act requests, or anything else. Things like more intrusive means of obtaining information from ICEBlock. Things like requests for live interception, which would be authorized under a search warrant. And if you have a response plan in place already for those.</blockquote><figure data-kg-thumbnail="https://micahflee.com/content/media/2025/09/iceblock-clip3_thumb.jpg" data-kg-custom-thumbnail="">

        <img src="https://micahflee.com/content/media/2025/09/iceblock-clip3_thumb.jpg"></figure><p>If you're not familiar with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrant_canary" rel="noreferrer">warrant canaries</a>, these are basically public notices that say, "I've never been forced to give up user data." If the notice ever gets taken down, the public can infer that the service was in fact forced to hand over user data.</p><p>Joshua said, "No on the warrant canary, because it would probably require some sort of user data to do that." He seemed to think that a warrant canary would be a new feature in the app (that's uh, not what a warrant canary is), and he completely ignored the legal questions, instead opting to talk about why it's important to keep the app design simple.</p><p>When the lawyer asked again what he would do if the government tried to compel him to spy on his users, Joshua simply said, "I'd just tell them to go fuck themselves." It's a good answer, but it's also naive. Government requests can include gag orders, preventing him from telling anyone that he has received them, and punishment for disobeying them can include threats of jail time. It's good to plan ahead. Luckily, he has EFF and ACLU offering him legal support, in case he ever actually has to face something like this.</p><h2 id="its-not-too-late">It's not too late</h2><p>Despite everything, I do think that Joshua's heart is in the right place and that he genuinely wants to help people. He's sticking his neck out to fight fascism, and the far right is harassing him and his family for it.</p><p>This is why I, and several other hackers who attended his HOPE talk, spent so much time and energy (both during his talk and in the days after it) trying to encourage him to open things up so that ICEBlock, and its million-strong userbase, might yet become a helpful tool in defending immigrants against Trump's fascist plans. He has rejected our offers.</p><p>It's possible for him to turn things around, but sadly, I'm not holding my breath.</p>

            <h2>Collecting All Causal Knowledge</h2>
            <p>
                    CauseNet aims at creating a causal knowledge base that comprises all human causal knowledge and to separate it from mere causal beliefs, with the goal of enabling large-scale research into causal inference.
                </p>
        </div><div>

    

    <p>Causal knowledge is seen as one of the key ingredients to advance artificial intelligence. Yet, few knowledge bases comprise causal knowledge to date, possibly due to significant efforts required for validation. Notwithstanding this challenge, we compile CauseNet, a large-scale knowledge base of <em>claimed</em> causal relations between causal concepts. By extraction from different semi- and unstructured web sources, we collect more than 11 million causal relations with an estimated extraction precision of 83\% and construct the first large-scale and open-domain causality graph. We analyze the graph to gain insights about causal beliefs expressed on the web and we demonstrate its benefits in basic causal question answering. Future work may use the graph for causal reasoning, computational argumentation, multi-hop question answering, and more.</p>

    <h2 id="download">Download</h2>

    <p>We provide three versions of our causality graph CauseNet:</p>

    <h2 id="data-model">Data Model</h2>

    <p>The core of CauseNet consists of causal concepts which are connected by causal relations. Each causal relation has comprehensive provenance data on where and how it was extracted.</p>

    <h2 id="examples-of-causal-relations">Examples of Causal Relations</h2>

    <p>Causal relations are represented as shown in the following example. Provenance data is omitted.</p>

    <div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>

    <p>For CauseNet-Full and CauseNet-Precision, we include comprehensive provenance data. In the following, we give one example per source.</p>

    <p>For relations extracted from natural language sentences we provide:</p>
    <ul>

    <h2 id="concept-spotting-datasets">Concept Spotting Datasets</h2>

    <p>For the construction of CauseNet, we employ a causal concept spotter as a causal concept can be composed of multiple words (e.g., “global warming”, “human activity”, or “lack of exercise”). We determine the exact start and end of a causal
concept in a sentence with a sequence tagger. Our training and evaluation data is available as part of our <a href="https://groups.uni-paderborn.de/wdqa/causenet/concept-spotting">concept spotting datasets</a>: one for Wikipedia infoboxes, Wikipedia lists, and ClueWeb sentences. We split each dataset into 80% training, 10% development and 10% test set</p>

    <h2 id="paper">Paper</h2>

    <p>CauseNet forms the basis for our CIKM 2020 paper <a href="https://papers.dice-research.org/2020/CIKM-20/heindorf_2020a_public.pdf">CauseNet: Towards a Causality Graph Extracted from the Web</a>. Please make sure to refer to it as follows:</p>

<p>To celebrate the Kickstarter for Shift Happens going well, I thought I would show you 50 keyboards from my collection of really strange/esoteric/meaningful keyboards that I gathered over the years. (It might be the world’s strangest keyboard collection!)</p>


</div>

<div><p>This is technically a bit of a spoiler for the book, but a) a lot of them are not in the book, and b) the book comes out in half a year, and we’ll all forget by then! </p><p>Let’s start!</p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mwichary/shift-happens">Shift Happens on Kickstarter</a></p></div>

<div>
<p>1.<br>I have a SafeType, thanks to a friend who noticed one about to be thrown away. This is among the most notable and interesting “ergonomic” keyboards, complete with mirrors that help you orient yourself when you’re starting out.</p>

<div>
<p>2.<br>The Comfort System keyboard is another “ergonomic“ device that is honestly pretty frightening to look at (explaining the challenge of making keyboards like these). You can reposition and reorient each of the three parts independently.</p>

<p>3.<br>I love these DataDesk Little Fingers keyboards with smaller keys because you can see exactly when iMac was introduced and how the company tried to “redesign”&nbsp;the keyboard to fit the new style.</p>


</div>

<div>
<p>4.<br>This is another Mac “alternate universe“ keyboard - an Adesso ergonomic keyboard that feels like “what if Apple Adjustable still existed when iMac came around”?</p>

<p>5.<br>This strange “medical” keyboard is more mechanical than you’d expect! I wrote more about it here: <a target="_blank" href="https://newsletter.shifthappens.site/archive/a-tale-of-three-skeuomorphs">A tale of three skeuomorphs</a>. Cleaning required when flashing!</p>

<p>6.<br>Once you’re done with your shift (no pun intended) at the hospital, how about some Pizza? This is i-Opener, one of the many shortlived internet appliances, this one with a gimmick that keeps on gimmicking.</p>
<figure>

</div>

<div>
<p>7.<br>Speaking of spacebar-adjacent gimmicks, I am mildly obsessed with how beautiful is this first NeXT keyboard from 1987, with a bunch of cool subtle things including a Command *bar* underneath the spacebar. As a matter of fact, I just finished writing an essay on it today!</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://aresluna.org/images/50-keyboards-from-my-collection/9-1.avif">
</figure>

</div>

<div>
<p>8.<br>This is Olivetti Praxis 48: perhaps one of the most beautiful among the most beautiful typewriters, and strangely similar in palette to the above NeXT keyboard. You could turn on this (electric) typewriter just by pressing any key. That’s pretty wild.</p>


</div>

<div>
<p>9.<br>This Olympia Reporter typewriter is not beautiful, but it has a lot of POWER THIS and POWER THAT keys that celebrate its marriage with electricity? Why is X and some other keys red? Those are the ones that auto repeat! </p>
<figure>
<img src="https://aresluna.org/images/50-keyboards-from-my-collection/11-1.avif">
</figure>

</div>

<div>
<p>10.<br>This is another typewriter, so proud of a functioning (erasing!) Backspace that it gives this a treatment I have never seen before or after.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://aresluna.org/images/50-keyboards-from-my-collection/12-1.avif">
</figure>

</div>



<div>
<p>12.<br>This keypad… is so bad.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://aresluna.org/images/50-keyboards-from-my-collection/14-1.avif">
</figure>

</div>

<div>
<p>13.<br>This was meant to be mounted atop Commodore 64 (which I don’t have), an interesting reversal from the early typewriters being nothing more than repurposed music keyboards.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://aresluna.org/images/50-keyboards-from-my-collection/15-1.avif">
</figure>

</div>

<div>
<p>14.<br>These two are taking this idea even further – mount these overlays on regular keyboards to turn them into new kinds of interfaces.</p>


</div>

<div>
<p>15.<br>There’s also professional gaming. It was cheaper for me to buy QSENN keyboards and replicate what professional StarCraft gamers were doing in the 1990s, than to find a good existing photo of one of these keyboards.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://aresluna.org/images/50-keyboards-from-my-collection/17-1.avif">
</figure>

</div>

<div>
<p>16.<br>And speaking of gaming – we’re all used to the thumb style of typing from the first photo that it was fun to discover the short moment where the gaming keyboards looked like the one in the second photo.</p>


</div>

<div>
<p>17.<br>And a bit earlier, some game consoles tried to reinvent themselves as home computers with keyboard accessories. This is among the strangest of them: a “keyboard” to add BASIC to the Atari 2600.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://aresluna.org/images/50-keyboards-from-my-collection/19-1.avif">
</figure>

</div>

<div>
<p>18.<br>I commissioned this “joystick” from <span translate="no"><a target="_blank" href="https://mastodon.social/@benjedwards">@benjedwards</a></span> and I am so happy with how it turned out. It’s technically a joystick without a stick, but software turned it into a one-key keyboard. It’s F11, currently mapped to muting/unmuting in Zoom. It’s *incredibly* rewarding to press.</p>


</div>

<div>
<p>19.<br>Speaking of strange keyboards, this is my “space cadet” keyboard – a mini keyboard that outputs only spaces, and instead of legends, each key *feels* different. Wrote about it more here: <a target="_blank" href="https://newsletter.shifthappens.site/archive/stop-me-if-youve-seen-this-one-before/">Stop me if you’ve seen this one before</a></p>


</div>

<div>
<p>20.<br>And here is a keyboard I built and hid in my shoes, made for one very specific reason. Are you interested what it is?

</figure>

</div>

<div>
<p>21.<br>This is one of the most rare keyboards I have –&nbsp;the strange abKey Evolution imported through a friend from Singapore – a keyboard that tried to reinvent perhaps one thing too many. Wrote more about it here: <a target="_blank" href="https://newsletter.shifthappens.site/archive/the-worst-keyboard-ever-made-3/">The worst keyboard ever made</a></p>
<figure>
<img src="https://aresluna.org/images/50-keyboards-from-my-collection/23-1.avif">
</figure>

</div>

<div>
<p>22. <br>And this one from Commodore is not really that unique, except it has this fun property –&nbsp;it reverses the usual beige colour scheme making the keys inside darker. It’s kinda neat!</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://aresluna.org/images/50-keyboards-from-my-collection/24-1.avif">
</figure>

</div>

<div>
<p>23.<br>This is a really cheap Bulgarian keyboard with such a poor build quality it cannot be unseen! I wrote more about it here: <a target="_blank" href="https://newsletter.shifthappens.site/archive/the-worst-keyboard-ever-made-3/">The worst keyboard ever made</a></p>
<figure>
<img src="https://aresluna.org/images/50-keyboards-from-my-collection/25-1.avif">
</figure>

</div>

<div>
<p>24.<br>Oh, it gets worse. This calculator keyboard is so cheap it’s not a keyboard at all – just an exposed PCB with a pen to complete the circuit. More about it here: <a target="_blank" href="https://newsletter.shifthappens.site/archive/the-worst-keyboard-ever-made-2/">The worst keyboard ever made</a></p>


</div>

<div>
<p>25.<br>And this is the opposite, an incredibly well-built IBM Model F banking typewriter with an enclosure made out of zinc. Hefty enough to stop a bank robbery? Perhaps.

<div>
<p>Halfway through! I need a bit of a break. Is this interesting? Should I keep going!?</p>

</div>

<div>
<p>26.<br>If your bank robbery goes poorly, you probably end up typing on this Swintec, transparent so that no contraband could be hidden inside. More about transparent tech for prisons in this Techmoan video: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3PfsndsihY">YouTube</a></p>

<div>
<p>27.<br>This simple braille keyboard – Tellatouch – was gorgeous and important. Type a key on one side, and the right braille letter assembles itself on the other.</p>
<figure>
<img data-width="1592" data-height="1303" src="https://aresluna.org/images/50-keyboards-from-my-collection/30-1.avif">
</figure>

</div>

<div>
<p>28.<br>This is a more modern version of an adjacent idea. Connect this device to a phone line, and you can speak even if you cannot talk. (Also, I just love any time a keyboard lands itself next to a segmented display.)</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://aresluna.org/images/50-keyboards-from-my-collection/31-1.avif">
</figure>

</div>

<div>
<p>29.<br>The creators of this Seiko keyboard recognized a watch with a keyboard wouldn’t make sense – so you could dock your watch and type this way. (I don’t have the watch itself. Too expensive!)</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://aresluna.org/images/50-keyboards-from-my-collection/32-1.avif">
</figure>

</div>

<div>
<p>30.<br>Just kidding! Here’s a keyboard on another Seiko watch. It’s an index keyboard – you don’t touch the keys directly, just move the cursor left and right like on Apple TV –&nbsp;since the keys are smaller than 1mm.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://aresluna.org/images/50-keyboards-from-my-collection/33-1.avif">
</figure>

</div>

<div>
<p>31.<br>This TI calculator for school use has tiny keys… in between other keys. What a strange thing.</p>


</div>

<div>
<p>32.<br>This calculator went… a different way.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://aresluna.org/images/50-keyboards-from-my-collection/35-1.avif">
</figure>

</div>

<div>
<p>33.<br>I love hybrid things and in-betweeners. This tiny Panasonic Toughbook asks a question: what if a BlackBerry keyboard, but twice the width?</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://aresluna.org/images/50-keyboards-from-my-collection/36-1.avif">
</figure>

</div>

<div>
<p>34.<br>This one, for TermiFlex, is a one-hand operation, inspired by phone keypads. There are three shifts under your long fingers!</p>


</div>

<div>
<p>35.<br>Speaking of complex shortcuts, look at this Apple keyboard with Avid software keycaps. The icon on Z is my favourite. I don’t even wanna know what this function does.</p>
<figure>
<img data-width="1716" data-height="1208" src="https://aresluna.org/images/50-keyboards-from-my-collection/38-1.avif">
</figure>

</div>

<div>
<p>36.<br>One among many foldable keyboards – this one for Palm devices (RIP).</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://aresluna.org/images/50-keyboards-from-my-collection/39-1.avif">
</figure>

</div>

<div>
<p>37.<br>This Sony remote had a built-in keyboard for typing in MiniDisc titles.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://aresluna.org/images/50-keyboards-from-my-collection/40-1.avif">
</figure>

</div>

<div>
<p>38.<br>And *this* Sony keyboard had two numeric keypads going in two different directions! One for typical calculator use, and one inspired by mobile phones to allow to chat as easily for people who got used to chatting that way.</p>
<figure>
<img data-width="1617" data-height="1283" src="https://aresluna.org/images/50-keyboards-from-my-collection/41-1.avif">
</figure>

</div>

<div>
<p>39.<br>Very happy (and also maybe also a little concerned) to report I am in possession of the entire ProHance lineup of the strange pointing device/keyboard hybrids!</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://aresluna.org/images/50-keyboards-from-my-collection/42-1.avif">
</figure>

</div>

<div>
<p>40.<br>But it’s amazing how rarely the graphical user interfaces and keyboards intersect. This here – an old AT&amp;T terminal keyboard – is an exception, providing dedicated keys for window management.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://aresluna.org/images/50-keyboards-from-my-collection/43-1.avif">
</figure>

</div>

<div>
<p>41.<br>I had to get this keyboard for a now-obscure Harris word processor, just because LOOK AT THE SHAPE OF THIS ENTER KEY.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://aresluna.org/images/50-keyboards-from-my-collection/44-1.avif">
</figure>

</div>

<div>
<p>42.<br>I have seen so many keyboards, but only this one – from a strange titling device meant to be connected to your TV –&nbsp;treats uppercase and lowercase exactly like all the other shifted and unshifted symbols. (With the exception of keyboards for kids, I assume!)</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://aresluna.org/images/50-keyboards-from-my-collection/45-1.avif">
</figure>

</div>

<div>
<p>43.<br>Back in the day, keyboards were so expensive that you often started on a “training” keyboard that came without the machine connected to it. Here’s a training keyboard for a Linotype, which is itself a fascinating machine.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://aresluna.org/images/50-keyboards-from-my-collection/46-1.avif">
</figure>

</div>

<div>
<p>44.<br>Here’s another one for the first popular line of desk calculators that predates a 10-key keypad.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://aresluna.org/images/50-keyboards-from-my-collection/47-1.avif">
</figure>

</div>

<div>
<p>45.<br>(I also have the actual calculator, called a Comptometer. It’s beautiful, really fun to use, and honestly a work of art. A truly impressive machine from the bygone era. I bought it because I was so impressed reading what it can do.)</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://aresluna.org/images/50-keyboards-from-my-collection/48-1.avif">
</figure>

</div>

<div>
<p>46.<br>Here’s another practice keyboard, with a record to play to teach you how to type!</p>
<figure>
<img data-width="1681" data-height="1234" src="https://aresluna.org/images/50-keyboards-from-my-collection/49-1.avif">
</figure>

</div>

<div>
<p>47.<br>And here’s the most modern version of a practice keyboard I know of – itself a small computer. After that, the likes of Mavis Beacon took over teaching typing in software.</p>
<figure>
<img data-width="1681" data-height="1234" src="https://aresluna.org/images/50-keyboards-from-my-collection/50-1.avif">
</figure>

</div>

<div>
<p>48.<br>Speaking of the 1980s, keyboards from failed computers often found a second life as Radio Shack components you could reuse in your DIY projects. Here’s one from a home computer called Coleco Adam.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://aresluna.org/images/50-keyboards-from-my-collection/51-1.avif">
</figure>

</div>

<div>
<p>49.<br>While we’re speaking about failed computers, this is One Laptop Per Child’s interesting-looking keyboard. (I think OLPC is considered a failure? I’m not 100% sure. This computer is not in the book, so I haven’t researched that carefully.)</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://aresluna.org/images/50-keyboards-from-my-collection/52-1.avif">
</figure>

</div>

<div>
<div><p>50. And here is Canon Cat, maybe my favourite failed machine of all time. Look at these Leap keys! I’m somewhat in love with this machine.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://newsletter.shifthappens.site/archive/adult-onset-felinophilia/">Adult-onset felinophilia</a></p></div>
<figure>
<img src="https://aresluna.org/images/50-keyboards-from-my-collection/53-1.avif">
</figure>

</div>

<div><p>That’s it! I hope you liked this sneak peek of my collection– if you did, consider backing the book since this is the level of quality I’ve been aiming at for the visual side… there are a lot more photos like these, and of course a lot more great stories attached to them. </p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mwichary/shift-happens">Shift Happens on Kickstarter</a></p></div>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://bassi.li/articles/i-miss-using-em-dashes">https://bassi.li/articles/i-miss-using-em-dashes</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45097827">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <p>I really miss using em dashes in my writing. Ever since content creators started using ChatGPT to help (or supplement) their writing, em dashes have become indicators of AI use. Students are routinely caught with their pants down as professors flag an essay as AI-generated based on the presence of lists, positive-leaning prose, and em dashes.</p>

<p>Em dashes can be found everywhere across my personal and professional writing. Nowadays, I find myself avoiding em dashes because I’m afraid that my writing will be flagged as AI-generated and dismissed as slop. I feel like I have to “dumb down” aspects of writing to convince readers that the words they are skimming were, in fact, written by a human. In turn, this results in this sort of meta-game where I choose my words carefully—typically ensuring that I include the <em>right</em> amount of grammatical character and/or mistakes—to convince readers that they aren’t wasting their time reading slop on the internet. Writing these two em dashes <em>felt</em> suspicious because I’m trying to insert them into my writing where readers will least expect ChatGPT to add them.</p>

<p>I’m curious (and more than a bit worried) that the writing that is being produced these days is being shaped by LLMs, even if an LLM has never touched a particular piece of prose. We are all collectively aware of what slop “feels like” to read, and that means that serious writers are conscious of how their word choice, punctuation, and flow are perceived by readers. The resulting piece of writing has therefore been shaped by the mere presence of consumer-grade LLMs.</p>

<p>The worst part is that models like ChatGPT can change between models; a new foundation model might drop that over-uses something else, like semi-colons, leading to future articles/books/papers/reports/etc avoiding its use to avoid arousing suspicion. As a software engineer, I love LLMs, but I’m unhappy with the amount of <em>soft power</em> they have on the creatives of the world, especially online. If an em dash fits into one’s writing but they avoid using it out of fear, our AI overlords have won.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div><p>We’ve <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/building-safeguards-for-claude">developed</a> sophisticated safety and security measures to prevent the misuse of our AI models. But cybercriminals and other malicious actors are actively attempting to find ways around them. Today, we’re releasing a report that details how.</p><p>Our <a href="https://www-cdn.anthropic.com/b2a76c6f6992465c09a6f2fce282f6c0cea8c200.pdf">Threat Intelligence report</a> discusses several recent examples of Claude being misused, including a large-scale extortion operation using Claude Code, a fraudulent employment scheme from North Korea, and the sale of AI-generated ransomware by a cybercriminal with only basic coding skills. We also cover the steps we’ve taken to detect and counter these abuses.</p><p>We find that threat actors have adapted their operations to exploit AI’s most advanced capabilities. Specifically, our report shows:</p><ul><li><strong>Agentic AI has been weaponized. </strong>AI models are now being used to <em>perform</em> sophisticated cyberattacks, not just advise on how to carry them out.</li><li><strong>AI has lowered the barriers to sophisticated cybercrime. </strong>Criminals with few technical skills are using AI to conduct complex operations, such as developing ransomware, that would previously have required years of training.</li><li><strong>Cybercriminals and fraudsters have embedded AI throughout all stages of their operations</strong>. This includes profiling victims, analyzing stolen data, stealing credit card information, and creating false identities allowing fraud operations to expand their reach to more potential targets.</li></ul><p>Below, we summarize three case studies from our full report.</p><h2 id=""><strong>‘Vibe hacking’: how cybercriminals used Claude Code to scale a data extortion operation</strong></h2><p><strong>The threat: </strong>We recently disrupted a sophisticated cybercriminal that used Claude Code to commit large-scale theft and extortion of personal data. The actor targeted at least 17 distinct organizations, including in healthcare, the emergency services, and government and religious institutions. Rather than encrypt the stolen information with traditional ransomware, the actor threatened to expose the data publicly in order to attempt to extort victims into paying ransoms that sometimes exceeded $500,000.</p><p>The actor used AI to what we believe is an unprecedented degree. Claude Code was used to automate reconnaissance, harvesting victims’ credentials, and penetrating networks. Claude was allowed to make both tactical and strategic decisions, such as deciding which data to exfiltrate, and how to craft psychologically targeted extortion demands. Claude analyzed the exfiltrated financial data to determine appropriate ransom amounts, and generated visually alarming ransom notes that were displayed on victim machines.</p><div><pre><code>=== PROFIT PLAN FROM [ORGANIZATION] ===

</code></pre></div><p><em>Above: A simulated custom ransom note. This is an illustrative example, created by our threat intelligence team for research and demonstration purposes after our analysis of extracted files from the real operation.</em></p><p><strong>Implications: </strong>This represents an evolution in AI-assisted cybercrime. Agentic AI tools are now being used to provide both technical advice and active operational support for attacks that would otherwise have required a team of operators. This makes defense and enforcement increasingly difficult, since these tools can adapt to defensive measures, like malware detection systems, in real time. We expect attacks like this to become more common as AI-assisted coding reduces the technical expertise required for cybercrime.</p><p><strong>Our response: </strong>We banned the accounts in question as soon as we discovered this operation. We have also developed a tailored classifier (an automated screening tool), and introduced a new detection method to help us discover activity like this as quickly as possible in the future. To help prevent similar abuse elsewhere, we have also shared technical indicators about the attack with relevant authorities.</p><h2 id=""><strong>Remote worker fraud: how North Korean IT workers are scaling fraudulent employment with AI</strong></h2><p><strong>The threat: </strong>We discovered that North Korean operatives had been using Claude to fraudulently secure and maintain remote employment positions at US Fortune 500 technology companies. This involved using our models to create elaborate false identities with convincing professional backgrounds, complete technical and coding assessments during the application process, and deliver actual technical work once hired.</p><p>These employment schemes were designed to generate profit for the North Korean regime, in defiance of international sanctions. This is a long-running operation that began before the adoption of LLMs, and has been reported by <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/PSA/2025/PSA250723-4">the FBI</a>.</p><p><strong>Implications:</strong> North Korean IT workers previously underwent years of specialized training prior to taking on remote technical work, which made the regime’s training capacity a major bottleneck. But AI has eliminated this constraint. Operators who cannot otherwise write basic code or communicate professionally in English are now able to pass technical interviews at reputable technology companies and then maintain their positions. This represents a fundamentally new phase for these employment scams.</p><div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="2756" height="5840" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2Fa474b3555a5486e3b8c0fa97434b27924a11b8d5-2756x5840.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2Fa474b3555a5486e3b8c0fa97434b27924a11b8d5-2756x5840.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"><figcaption><em>Top: Simulated prompts created by our threat intelligence team demonstrating a lack of relevant technical knowledge. Bottom: Simulated prompts demonstrating linguistic and cultural barriers.</em><br></figcaption></figure></div><p><strong>Our response: </strong>when we discovered this activity we immediately banned the relevant accounts, and have since improved our tools for collecting, storing, and correlating the known indicators of this scam. We’ve also shared our findings with the relevant authorities, and we’ll continue to monitor for attempts to commit fraud using our services.</p><h2 id=""><strong>No-code malware: selling AI-generated ransomware-as-a-service</strong></h2><p><strong>The threat:</strong> A cybercriminal used Claude to develop, market, and distribute several variants of ransomware, each with advanced evasion capabilities, encryption, and anti-recovery mechanisms. The ransomware packages were sold on internet forums to other cybercriminals for $400 to $1200 USD.</p><div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="4158" height="2958" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F3d0f1e44057b1d4a58f56785009a18efb7123cb0-4158x2958.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F3d0f1e44057b1d4a58f56785009a18efb7123cb0-4158x2958.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"><figcaption><em>The cybercriminal’s initial sales offering on the dark web, from January 2025.</em></figcaption></figure></div><p><strong>Implications: </strong>This actor appears to have been dependent on AI to develop functional malware. Without Claude’s assistance, they could not implement or troubleshoot core malware components, like encryption algorithms, anti-analysis techniques, or Windows internals manipulation.</p><p><strong>Our response: </strong>We have banned the account associated with this operation, and alerted our partners. We’ve also implemented new methods for detecting malware upload, modification, and generation, to more effectively prevent the exploitation of our platform in the future.</p><h2 id=""><strong>Next steps</strong></h2><p>In each of the cases described above, the abuses we’ve uncovered have informed updates to our preventative safety measures. We have also shared details of our findings, including indicators of misuse, with third-party safety teams.</p><p>In the full report, we address a number of other malicious uses of our models, including an attempt to compromise Vietnamese telecommunications infrastructure, and the use of multiple AI agents to commit fraud. The growth of AI-enhanced fraud and cybercrime is particularly concerning to us, and we plan to prioritize further research in this area.</p><p>We’re committed to continually improving our methods for detecting and mitigating these harmful uses of our models. We hope this report helps those in industry, government, and the wider research community strengthen their own defenses against the abuse of AI systems.</p><h2 id=""><strong>Further reading</strong></h2><p>For the full report with additional case studies, <a href="https://www-cdn.anthropic.com/b2a76c6f6992465c09a6f2fce282f6c0cea8c200.pdf">see here.</a></p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>
