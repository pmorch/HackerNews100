<p>That's what my dad said when I asked what was wrong with our home internet connection. "The Wi-Fi only works when it's raining."</p>
<figure>
  

  

  

  
  <img src="https://predr.ag/processed_images/wifi-router-on-balcony-cropped.74b365103ecb7814.jpg" alt="Illustration of a Wi-Fi antenna attached to the exterior of an upper floor of an apartment building. It's currently raining, and the Wi-Fi is working flawlessly.">
</figure>
<p>Let's back up a few steps, so we're all on the same page about the <em>utter ridiculousness</em> of this situation.</p>
<p>At the time, I was still a college student — this was over 10 years ago. I had come back home to spend a couple of weeks with my parents before the fall semester kicked off. I hadn't been back home in almost a full year, because home and school were on different continents.</p>
<p>My dad is an engineer who had already been tinkering with networking gear longer than I'd been alive. Through the company he started, he had designed and deployed all sorts of complex network systems at institutions across the country — everything from gigabit Ethernet for an office building, to inter-city connections over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line-of-sight_propagation">line-of-sight</a> microwave links.</p>
<p>He is <em>the last person on Earth</em> who would say a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magical_thinking">"magical thinking"</a> phrase like that.</p>
<p>"What?" I uttered, stunned. "The Wi-Fi only works while it's raining," he repeated patiently. "It started a couple of weeks ago, and I haven't had a chance to look into it yet."</p>
<p>"No way," I said. If anything, <a href="https://www.microwave-link.com/microwave/rain-fade-on-microwave-links/">rain makes wireless signal quality <em>worse</em></a>, not <em>better</em>. Never <em>better</em>!</p>
<p>Two weeks without reliable internet? I started a speed-run through the stages of grief...</p>
<h2 id="denial">Denial</h2>
<p>I pulled open my laptop and started poking at the network.</p>
<p>Pinging any website had a 98% packet loss rate. The internet connection was still up, but only in the most annoying "technically accurate" sense. Nothing loads when you have a 98% packet loss rate! The network may as well have been dead.</p>
<p>I was upset. I had just started dating someone a few months prior, and she was currently on the other side of the planet! How was I to explain that I couldn't stay in touch because it wasn't raining?<label for="sn-mobile-internet"></label>

<span>Mobile data at the time was <em>exorbitantly</em> expensive, so much so that I didn't have a data plan at all for my cell service at home. I couldn't just use my phone's data plan to work around the problem, like one might do today in a similar situation.</span>
</p>
<p>I was pacing around the house, fuming. Grief, stage two!</p>
<p>That's when the rain started.</p>
<h2 id="bargaining">Bargaining</h2>
<p>Like a miracle, within 5 minutes of the rain starting, the packet loss rate was down to 0%!</p>
<p>I couldn't believe my eyes! I was ready for the connection to die at any second, so I opened a million tabs at once — as if I don't normally do that anyway...</p>
<p>The rain held up for about an hour, and so did the internet connection.</p>
<p>Then, 15 minutes or so after the rain stopped, the packet loss rate shot back up to 90%+. The internet connection went back to being unusable.</p>
<p>I was ready to do just about anything to get more rain.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the weather stayed grey and murky for the next few days. Each time, the pattern stayed the same:</p>
<ul>
<li>The rain starts, and not even a few minutes later the internet connection is crisp and fast.</li>
<li>The rain stops, and within 15 minutes the internet connection is unusable again.</li>
</ul>
<p>As much as I hated to admit it, the evidence was solid. The Wi-Fi only works when it's raining!</p>
<p>At this point, I had a choice to make.</p>
<p>I could keep going through the stages of grief: I could sulk and plan my calls with my girlfriend around the weather forecast.</p>
<p>Or, I could break out of that downward spiral and get to the bottom of what was going on.</p>
<p>"<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magical_thinking">Magical thinking</a> be damned! Am I an engineer or what?" I told myself.</p>
<p>That settled it. I wasn't going to take this lying down.</p>
<h2 id="determination">Determination</h2>
<p>Some context on our home networking setup is in order.</p>
<p>Remember how my dad's company had extensive experience with networking solutions? Well, we had a fancy networking setup at home too — and it had worked flawlessly for the best part of 10 years!</p>
<p>My dad's office had a very expensive, very fast<label for="sn-contemporaneous"></label>

<span>For the time, of course.</span>
 commercial internet connection. The home internet options, meanwhile, weren't great! In my family, we are often stubbornly against settling for less unless there's absolutely no other choice.</p>
<p>The office and our apartment were a few blocks away from each other along a small hill, with our second-floor apartment holding the higher ground. With a bit of work, my dad set up a line-of-sight Wi-Fi bridge — <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-range_Wi-Fi">a couple of high-gain directional Wi-Fi antennas pointed at each other</a> — between the office and our apartment. This let us enjoy the faster commercial internet connection at home!</p>
<p>I started poking around the network to figure out where the connection was breaking down.</p>
<p>The local Wi-Fi router at home was working well — no packets lost. The local end of the Wi-Fi bridge was fine too.</p>
<p>But pinging the remote end of the Wi-Fi bridge was showing a 90%+ packet loss rate — and so did pinging any other network device behind it. Aha, there's something wrong with the Wi-Fi bridge!</p>
<p>But <em>what</em>? And why <em>now</em>, when the system had been working fine for almost 10 years, rain or shine?<label for="sn-work-experience"></label>

<span>Maybe <a href="https://predr.ag/blog/mediocrity-can-be-a-sign-of-excellence/#years-of-experience-vs-experience-in-those-years">years of work experience isn't a good metric</a> here either 😄</span>
</p>
<p><em>How</em> can a rain storm <em>fix</em> a Wi-Fi bridge, anyway?</p>
<p>So many confusing questions. Time to get some answers!</p>
<h2 id="debugging">Debugging</h2>
<p>Like any experienced engineer, the first thing I tried was turning everything off and then on again. It didn't work.</p>
<p>Then I checked all the devices on the network individually:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maybe one of the devices has gone bad with age? Nope.<label for="sn-diagnostics"></label>

<span>I physically connected my laptop to each device's local Ethernet, then ran diagnostics, pinged the devices over the wired connection, etc.</span>
</li>
<li>Maybe a cable got unseated or came loose? Nope.</li>
<li>Maybe a power brick has become faulty over time? Nope.</li>
<li>Maybe an automatic firmware update failed and broke something? Nope.</li>
<li>Maybe an antenna connector has corroded from spending years outdoors? Nope.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unlike debugging software, a lot of this hardware debugging was annoyingly <em>physical</em>. I had to climb up ladders, trace cables that hadn't been touched in 10 years, and do a lot of walking back and forth between our home and my dad's office.</p>
<p>On my umpteenth back-and-forth walk, as I was bored and exasperated, I started noticing how much our neighborhood had changed in the many years I hadn't been living at home full-time.<label for="sn-boarding-school"></label>

<span>Before college, I spent four years at a boarding high school. I was on our national math and programming teams for the <a href="https://www.imo-official.org/">IMO</a> and <a href="https://ioinformatics.org/">IOI</a>), so I even spent most of each summer away from home at prep camps and at the competitions themselves.</span>
 Many of the little neighborhood shops were new. Many houses had gotten a fresh coat of paint. Trees that used to be barely more than saplings had grown tall and strong.</p>
<p>Then it hit me.</p>
<h2 id="realization">Realization</h2>
<p>I ran home and climbed up onto the scaffolding holding up the Wi-Fi bridge's antenna. I was hanging precariously off the side of our apartment building, two stories up in the air.<label for="sn-safety-harness"></label>

<span>In retrospect, a safety harness would have been a good idea... Things people do for internet! Don't forget, a girl was involved too — I wasn't doing this merely for Netflix or Twitter.</span>
</p>
<p>Then I looked downhill, at the antenna that formed the second half of the Wi-Fi bridge.</p>
<p>Or at least, <em>toward</em> the antenna, because I couldn't see it — a tree in a neighbor's yard was in the way! Its topmost branches were swaying back and forth in the line-of-sight between the antenna pair.</p>
<p><em>Bingo!</em></p>
<h2 id="the-problem-and-the-fix">The Problem and the Fix</h2>
<p>Here's what was going on.</p>
<p>Many years ago, we installed the Wi-Fi bridge. For a long time, everything was great!</p>
<p>But every year, our neighbor's tree grew taller and taller. Shortly before when I came back home that summer, its topmost branches had managed to reach high enough to interfere with our Wi-Fi signal.</p>
<p>It was <em>only barely</em> tall enough to interfere with the signal, though!</p>
<p>Every time it rained, the rain collected on its leaves and branches and <em>weighed them down</em>. The extra weight bent them out of the way of the Wi-Fi line-of-sight!<label for="sn-fresnel"></label>

<span>Interestingly, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line-of-sight_propagation#Impairments_to_line-of-sight_propagation">objects <em>outside</em> the straight line between antennas can still cause interference</a>! For best signal quality, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresnel_zone">Fresnel zone</a> between the antennas should be clear of obstructions. But perfection isn't achievable in practice, so RF equipment like Wi-Fi uses techniques like error-correcting codes so that it can still work without a perfectly clear Fresnel zone.</span>
</p>
<p>Each time the rain stopped, the rainwater would continue to drip off the tree. Slowly, over the course of 15ish minutes, that would unburden the tree — letting it rise back up into the path of our bits and bytes. That's when the Wi-Fi would stop working.</p>
<p>The fix was easy: upgrade our hardware. We replaced <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11g-2003">our old 802.11g devices</a> with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11n-2009">new 802.11n ones</a>, which took advantage of new <del>magic</del> math and physics to make signals more resistant to interference.<label for="sn-beamforming"></label>

<span>One such piece of magic new to 802.11n Wi-Fi is called "<a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/80211ac-a-survival/9781449357702/ch04.html">beamfoming</a>" — it's when a transmitter can use multiple antennas transmitting on the same frequency to shape and steer the signal in a way that improves the effective range and signal quality. Modern Wi-Fi does beamforming with only a few antenna elements, but if we scale that number way up we get <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phased_array">a phased array antenna</a>. Ever wondered how come <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/spacex-reveals-next-gen-starlink-dish-for-residential-users">Starlink antennas are flat</a> and not a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_dish#Gallery">"dish" like old satellite TV antennas</a>? They use phased arrays to aim their signal at <a href="https://www.space.com/starlink-satellite-train-how-to-see-and-track-it">the Starlink satellites streaking across the sky</a> — without any moving parts. <del>Magic!</del> Physics!</span>
</p>
<p>A few days later, the new gear arrived and I eagerly climbed back up the scaffolding to install the new antennas.</p>
<p>A few screws, zip ties, and cable connections later, the Wi-Fi's "link established" lights flashed green once again.</p>
<p>This time, <em>it wasn't raining.</em></p>
<p>All was well once again.</p>

	  		<p>Electrical baby toys are interesting to disassemble and look at how it’s made. Not up to the point of screwing out the PCB, decapping the chips and trying to reverse-engineer the ROM—I’m sure that’s interesting too—but just on a basic mechanical level. Companies like VTech and Clementoni apply simple but clever techniques for their systems to provide just enough variation while keeping the production costs low.</p>
<p>Consider the Baby Clementoni puzzle farmer themed laying board game. The board is divided into four sections, where our toddler can place three plastic blocks in their correct respective place in and around the farm. It’s just the plastic mold that keeps the puzzle pieces in place. But these pieces can also be inserted into the central mechanism that’ll emit a charming sound, identifying the piece: if our daughter manages to insert the cat piece, it’ll say <em>miauw</em>, and if that was the bird, you’ll hear chirping. How does it do that?</p>

</figure>

<p>The central system simply registers switch presses. It comes with 4 small switches, and the bottom size of the plastic puzzle pieces are cut out in a way that it’ll press a certain combination of those switches. That means there are <code>2^4</code> or 16 possible combinations. But wait! There are only 12 puzzle pieces. Does that mean you can buy an expansion? We categorized each puzzle number and came to the conclusion that there are three unregistered binary combinations:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Binary</th>
<th>Puzzle Piece</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>1100</code></td>
<td>Cow</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>1011</code></td>
<td>Rabbit</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>0010</code></td>
<td>Cat</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>0100</code></td>
<td>Rooster</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>1110</code></td>
<td>Frog</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>0101</code></td>
<td>Chicken</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>0110</code></td>
<td>Horse</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>1000</code></td>
<td>Farmer</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>1010</code></td>
<td>Sheep</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>0011</code></td>
<td>Bird</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>0111</code></td>
<td>Duck</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>0001</code></td>
<td>Dog</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Then there’s of course <code>0000</code> which shouldn’t trigger any sound since it’s the default state, meaning we’re left with <code>1111</code>, <code>1001</code>, and <code>1101</code> as unassigned ones. Would pressing that combination of switches crash the whole thing? Nope! Clementoni’s engineers were smart enough to “catch” that error: triggering one of the unknown states by forcing a combination with your fingers emits a bloop followed by a voice saying “uh-oh!”. It made me laugh—good catch indeed!</p>
<p>You have to design these things a bit more robust: a baby or toddler mashing in plastic pieces without care in practice means our cow regularly sounds like the rooster, and our dog like the chicken: sometimes, the switches are stuck, and sometimes, the plastic pieces trigger <code>1</code>s next to the ones they’re supposed to trigger. In that case, having a fail-safe “uh-oh” seems like a good idea.</p>
<p>VTech uses this unique-combination-of-trigger mechanism in many of their products: on their <a href="https://www.vtechnl.com/onze-merken/zoef-zoef-dieren">Zoef Zoef Dieren</a> animals, cars, and water amusement park. That last one is more interesting, as the figures are round, meaning the plastic notches at the bottom pressing the buttons to identify the figurine have to take rotation into account. A <code>010010</code> and a <code>100100</code> and a <code>001001</code> produces different numbers (18, 36, 9), but it’s the same little hippo.</p>

</figure>

<p>Bit rotation can be implemented using a combination of bit shifting and or operations, and on a hardware level, with different locical XOR ports. That’s of course just one way, and you still need a way to identify the number without confusing it with another figure. Although I don’t think that last was implemented: if you select your starting bits in a smart way, there won’t be any overlap. The identification system here uses 14 bits, and all of the figures have either 6 or 7 <code>1</code>s, making it even possible to completely ignore bit rotation and just rely on the relative position of the enabled bits to do the identification. I’m of course merely guessing at this point.</p>
<p>The VTech animals of the zoo and farm emit a different sound based on the position where you put them in the zoo/farm. For example, before their feed tray, on the track itself, small plastic notches again press on the switches below the animals on wheels, triggering the correct “I love corn, yummy!” reaction.</p>
<p>Until you go off track, or the track breaks, that is.</p>
<p>So what happens when you press an unknown combination of buttons on VTech toys? Unfortunately, nothing. What a letdown and missed opportunity! Instead of putting in an easter egg like the Clementoni puzzle board, the VTech <em>Zoef Zoef</em> animals, <em>Toet Toet</em> cars, steam train blocks, and wobbly water fun figurines all go silent. Italian versus Chinese humor, perhaps?</p>
<p>That said, this article proves we have way too many battery-powered toys that make noise…</p>

<p><em>It’s <a href="https://www.aprilcools.club/">April Cools</a>! It’s like April Fools, except instead of cringe comedy you make genuine content that’s different what you usually do. For example, last year I talked about <a href="https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/weird-things-you-can-buy/">the strangest markets on the internet</a>. This year I went down a different rabbit hole.</em></p>

<p>Daniel has been a <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/top5names.html">top 5 baby name twice since 2000</a>. There are <a href="https://www.mynamestats.com/First-Names/D/DA/DANIEL/index.html">over 1.5 million Daniels</a>  in the United States (and almost 100,000 last-name Danielses). There are who knows how many Dans, Dannies, and Daniellas out there. “Daniel” is, by any way you slice it, a very modern name.</p>

<p>It may be the oldest attested name in common use.</p>

<hr>

<p>Last year was Chicago’s last <a href="https://blockclubchicago.org/2023/10/23/why-is-the-newberry-library-ending-its-popular-book-fair/">Newberry Library book sale</a>. Part of my haul was several collections of ancient literature:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/tale-of-daniel/img/books.jpg" alt="Three books, two on Egypt, one on near-east"></p>

<p>I’m interested in ancient history, which shouldn’t be a surprise to anybody who reads this blog. And I love how their literature reflects the modern human experience. Take this lament carved in a pyramid from the Egyptian Middle Kingdom:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have heard the words of Imohotep and Hardedef \ Whose sayings are recited whole. \ What of their places?</p>

<p>Their walls have crumbled, \ Their places are gone, \ As though they had never been! (<a href="https://archive.org/details/MiriamLichtheimAncientEgyptianLiteratureVolI">pg 196</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This anonymous poet, writing 4500 years ago, shares our fears about losing our past and of our memories being forgotten. Beautiful.</p>

<p>But I found something far more relevant in the Mesopotamian literature.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/tale-of-daniel/img/books2-crop.jpg" alt=""></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Straightway Daniel the Raphaman … gives oblations to the gods to eat (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ancient-Near-East-Anthology-Pictures/dp/0691002002">pg 118</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Daniel</strong> the Raphaman</p>

<p><strong>DANIEL</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The story comes from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tale_of_Aqhat">Tale of Aqhat</a>, pulled out of the ruins of a forgotten city, estimated to approximately 1350 BCE. That’s a hundred years older than the oldest known <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_bone_script">Chinese writing</a>, one <em>thousand</em> years older than the book of Daniel, and thirty-four hundred years before today. I needed to know if this was the <em>same</em> name, transmitted across cultures, stretching 3400 years of unbroken “Daniels” to our modern day. Is this where “Daniel” comes from, or is just a strange coincidence?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I’ve done some historical work before, but all of it was in software, a “history of the modern world”. I decided to try anyway. This is what I’ve put together from reading books and trawling JSTOR.<sup id="fnref:JSTOR"><a href="#fn:JSTOR">1</a></sup></p>

<p>This is the tale of Daniel.</p>

<h3 id="ugarit">Ugarit</h3>

<p>Obviously, finding an unbroken lineage of specific Daniels across three millennia is impossible. Instead, I want to learn if the name was in the “cultural consciousness”. If so, we can be modestly confident that <em>real people</em> are getting named Daniel, like how real people are being named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khaleesi_%28given_name%29">Khaleesi</a> today.</p>

<p>So let’s start with where the name was first found. <strong>Ugarit</strong> was a port city of the shores of Ras Shamra, unknown until 1928. Scholars believe that it was a city of roughly 8,000 people and the capitol of a kingdom of 20,000 (<a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/43303580">ref</a>). While never a great power, Ugarit was <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctv2npq9cv.12?seq=4">a fairly “literate” society</a>  and had <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctv2npq9cv.5?seq=18">extensive trade relations</a> with all of the regional powers.</p>

<p>Along with a trove of archaeological material (pots and doodads), excavators also found large collections of clay tablets. Like with many Bronze Age civilizations, most of these recovered documents are either religious, diplomatic, or administrative. That’s because clay tablets are expensive and only reserved for important matters. Most of these were dated to very approximately 1500-1200 BCE.</p>

<p>But also in that collection, we found three piece of literature. The first, the Baal Cycle, tells of how Baal Hadad became one of the great gods of the Ugaritic pantheon. The second, the Legend of Keret, probably matters a lot to another person chasing a completely different white whale, but doesn’t matter to me. The final one, the one that started this obsession of mine, is the Tale of Aqhat.</p>

<p>I found this picture in the <a href="https://digitallibrary.usc.edu/CS.aspx?VP3=SearchResult&amp;VBID=2A3BXZ8ODTDTD&amp;PN=1&amp;WS=SearchResults#/SearchResult&amp;VBID=2A3BXZ79NBNBN&amp;PN=1&amp;WS=SearchResults">InscriptiFact collection</a>. Sadly no digital transcription! It tells of the story of the great hero Aqhat, who was loved and murdered by the goddess Anath. But I don’t actually care about any of that, I’m only after the Daniel. I’m <em>pretty sure</em> this is Daniel’s name:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/tale-of-daniel/img/daniel-zoom-markup.png" alt=""></p>

<p>I have a few friends who can read cuneiform, so I asked if any understood this text. I found out 1) that’s like asking a person who “can read ASCII” if they can understand Spanish, and 2) this is <em>not actually</em> cuneiform. It’s just an alphabet that <em>looks</em> like cuneiform.</p>

</center>


<p>Aqhat’s father is 𐎄𐎐𐎛𐎍. Left to right: D, N, ‘I, L. “Judged by El”, El being the chief God in the Ugaritic pantheon.</p>

<p>The name <em>could</em> be older than this text, since most early written myths were first oral traditions. This is just the first time the name “Daniel” is attested. The name <em>could</em> also be a lot younger, at least the modern name. The old name could just be an unusual coincidence, like how people in both England and China have the last name “Lee”.<sup id="fnref:China"><a href="#fn:China">2</a></sup> For “Daniel” to be that old, it’s not enough for the Ugarits to have had the name, it has to <em>come from</em> them, in a chain of Daniels reaching into present.</p>

<p>And here we run into a problem. We know roughly how old the tablets are because we know roughly when the city collapsed. By cross-referencing names of Egyptian rulers that appear in Ugarit tablets with the much better preserved Egyptian corpus, historians estimate that the city collapsed around 1190 BCE. This corresponds with the “Bronze Age Collapse”, a cataclysmic era where dozens of cities and kingdoms in the region are turned to ruins. Scholars still don’t have a clear picture why.</p>

<p>Regardless of the <em>why</em>, the Ugarites disappeared from history. The name Daniel would have to be carried by a new generation.</p>

<p>But this is also where the chain breaks.</p>

<h3 id="phoenicia">Phoenicia</h3>

<p>The Ras Shamra find was a one-in-a-million miracle, an enormous corpus of about 40,000 words, roughly as much as one Harlequin romance novel. After that? Well, here’s the <a href="https://www.hillelwayne.com/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadad_Statue">Hadad Statue</a>:</p>

<center>
<figure> 
  <img src="https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/tale-of-daniel/img/hadad-statue.jpeg" title="A statue of a god. The bottom has faint inscriptions.">

  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadad_Statue#/media/File:Statue_of_Weather_God_Haddad.jpg">(source)</a>

  </figcaption>
</figure>
</center>


<p>If you look closely, you can see the bottom is covered in faint writing. The language is “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samalian_language">Samalian</a>”, one of the many languages in the region. The engraving is roughly 400 words long and represents <em>over half of all Samalian.</em> This essay is four times longer than the Samalian corpus.</p>

<p>So what happened? It’s easy to imagine the Bronze Age Collapse turning the broader region into a Stone Age wasteland, but the archaeological evidence suggests the opposite. Rather, it points to a <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/3632872">rapid economic recovery of the region</a>, with new kingdoms soon establishing a large number of seafaring trade routes. Eventually they’d come in contact with the Greeks, who’d call all of the many distinct groups “Phoenicians”.</p>

<p>But we know so little of what the “Phoenicians” (in all their languages) wrote because of <em>how</em> they wrote it. Instead of Ugarit’s clay tablets, the Phoenicians used papyrus. Papyrus is lighter and cheaper, but also rots after a few decades. The fragments of text we do have— with one big exception— are engravings.<sup id="fnref:preservation"><a href="#fn:preservation">3</a></sup> Inscriptions on tombs, statues, weapons, etc. This is a major problem for historians, but an even bigger problem for <em>me</em>, because it makes the question of Daniel impossible to answer.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, we can look for clues that the same stories persisted, even if we don’t have concrete evidence. Let’s start with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadad_Statue#Text">first two lines</a> of the Hadad statue:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>𐤀𐤍𐤊 𐤐𐤍𐤌𐤅 · 𐤁𐤓 · 𐤒𐤓𐤋 · 𐤌𐤋𐤊 · 𐤉𐤀𐤃𐤉 · 𐤆𐤉 · 𐤄𐤒𐤌𐤕 · 𐤍𐤑𐤁 · 𐤆𐤍 · 𐤋𐤄𐤃𐤃 · 𐤁𐤏𐤋𐤌𐤉‎· 𐤒𐤌𐤅 · 𐤏𐤌𐤉̇ ·· 𐤀̇𐤋𐤄𐤅 ·· 𐤄𐤃𐤃 · 𐤅𐤀𐤋 · 𐤅𐤓𐤔𐤐 · 𐤅𐤓𐤊𐤁𐤀𐤋 · 𐤅𐤔𐤌𐤔 · 𐤅𐤍𐤕𐤍 · 𐤁𐤉𐤃𐤉</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the “Phoenician alphabet”—the same one that inspired the Greek alphabet— which many distinct cultures in the region used for their own languages. Unlike Ugaritic, it’s read right-to-left. Scholars don’t think this alphabet descended from Ugaritic, but the two writing systems are closely related: the same sounds appear in roughly the same places in the alphabet.<sup id="fnref:order"><a href="#fn:order">4</a></sup> Here’s the translation (from wiki):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am Panamuwa, son of Qarli, king of Y’DY, who have erected this statue for Hadad in my eternal abode (burial chamber). The gods Hadad and El and Rašap and Rākib-El and Šamaš supported me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The same gods, El and Baal Hadad, are important gods in the Ugarit corpus! And this is coming four hundred years after the fall of Ugarit. It suggests the Baal Hadad and El weren’t local gods to the Ugarits, but regional gods, part of a shared culture. The tale of Aqhat could have been preserved as a literary tradition, just on sources we don’t have anymore. And with Aqhat comes his dad(niel).</p>

<p>To get out of the Daniel dark ages, we have to look at a different inscription found 600 miles away.</p>

<p>Like the Hadad statue, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesha_Stele">Misha Stele</a> is one of our only sources on a long-dead language. In this case, Moabite. It’s a distinct language from Samalian but this uses the same Phoenician alphabet. Here’s a sample (also from wiki):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have built its gates and I have built its towers. I have built the palace of the king, and I made the prisons for the criminals within the wall. And there were no wells in the interior of the wall in Karchah. And I said to all the people, ‘Make you every man a well in his house.’ And I dug the ditch for Karchah with the chosen men of Israel.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="israel">Israel?</h3>

<p>Yes, Israel.</p>

<p>The Greeks called this region Phoenicia, but the locals always called it <em>Canaan</em>. The same “Canaan” from the Bible. The Israelites were a Canaanite population with Canaanite religions: Israel literally means <a href="https://www.thetorah.com/article/jacob-is-renamed-israel-twice-why-does-the-name-jacob-remain">One who fought El</a>. Slowly, over years and centuries, they developed their own ethnic identity. At some point, there were two Israelite kingdoms: the kingdom of Israel/Samaria in the north and the kingdom of Judah (where we get “Jew”) in the south.</p>

<p>Israel was conquered in 720 BCE while the kingdom of Judah limps along, in one form or another, until 130 CE.<sup id="fnref:date"><a href="#fn:date">5</a></sup> And it’s through the people of Judah that we have the best corpus of that region’s writing.</p>

<p>The Torah, or “Old Testament”, is a 300,000 word corpus of ancient Hebrew, chronicling the stories, religious practices, and history (mythic and attested) of the Jews.<sup id="fnref:orthodox"><a href="#fn:orthodox">6</a></sup> It’s the reason we can decipher the scant inscriptions of other Canaanite languages like Moabite, Samalian, and <a href="https://forward.com/culture/182321/cracking-the-ugaritic-code/">even Ugaritic itself</a>!</p>

<p>And it’s where the tale of Daniel continues.</p>

<h3 id="judah">Judah</h3>

<p>Quick recap on Daniel so far: we know the Ugarites wrote about a son of Daniel, the Canaanites (nee Phoenicians) shared a culture with the Ugarites, and the Israelites shared a culture with the Canaanites.</p>

<p>In 600 BCE, the Neo-Babylonian empire conquered Judah, which leads to the sixty year “Babylonian exile” of Jews from Canaan. It’s <em>allegedly</em> during this time that we get the collection of prophecies known as the “Book of Ezekiel”.<sup id="fnref:Ezekiel"><a href="#fn:Ezekiel">7</a></sup> Mostly it’s about how the Jews lost the favor of God and will one day earn it back, and with it redemption.</p>

<p>Far, <strong>far</strong> more importantly, it marks the triumphant return of Daniel.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Son of man, if a land sins against Me by trespassing grievously, I shall stretch forth My hand upon it and break its staff of bread, and I shall send famine upon it and cut off from it both man and beast. Now should these three men be in its midst- Noah, <strong>Daniel</strong>, and Job-they would save themselves with their righteousness, says the Lord God.<sup id="fnref:translations"><a href="#fn:translations">8</a></sup> — Ezekiel 14:13-14</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Daniel is written (דנאל). As a distant descendent of Phoenician, Hebrew reads right-to-left: Daled, Nun, Aleph, Lamed. “God judged me.” Same meaning as the Ugaritic name, same letters as 𐎄𐎐𐎛𐎍.</p>

<p>I’m amazed that the same meaning can be preserved across so many centuries. But I also want to be as thorough as possible. Two names, eight hundred years apart, with the same meaning, is still not enough for me. I still worry that it could just be an enormous coincidence that two cultures in the same region, speaking sister languages, came up with the same <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onomastics">name-meaning</a>.</p>

<p>Ezekiel provides the missing link. In the Torah, both Noah and Job are treated as pious men, but critically, <em>neither are Israelites</em>.<sup id="fnref:job"><a href="#fn:job">9</a></sup> Making Daniel part of the trio implies he was also a righteous non-Jew.</p>

<p>Ezekiel would expect people would know who “Daniel” was if he used that name. This would make sense if Daniel was, say, a righteous figure in the broader Canaanite folklore. At least the Tale of Aqhat implies he was a righteous and just man who was worthy of El’s blessing. He prayed for a son and his wish was granted. He’d be a distinct character, a known righteous non-Israelite, which Ezekiel used as a point of reference.</p>

<p>A tenuous chain, I know, but enough to persuade me at least. <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1517522">Enough to persuade other scholars too</a>. It may be the best we’ll ever do.</p>

<p>We can finally use the Bible to establish that Daniel wasn’t just a folkloric name, but a name people actually used. From the Book of Ezra:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And these are the heads of their father’s houses and the lineage of those who ascended with me in the kingdom of King Artaxerxes from Babylon. Of the sons of Phinehas, Gershom: of the sons of Ithamar, <strong>Daniel</strong>; of the sons of David, Hattush. — Ezra 8:1-2</p>

<p>And these were the sons of David who were born to him in Hebron: the firstborn, Amnon, to Ahinoam the Jezreelitess; the second, <strong>Daniel</strong>, to Abigail the Carmelitess. — Chronicles 3:1</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If they’re using Daniel as the name of a minor son of a minor figure, it’s probably a real name.</p>

<h3 id="the-false-daniel">The False Daniel</h3>

<p>But now we have a problem.</p>

<p>The Ezekiel Daniel has four letters. But all of the later Daniels have <em>five</em>: Daled, Nun, <em>Yud</em>, Aleph, Lamed (דניאל) .</p>

<p>It’s still possible to read the four-letter version as “Daniel” but it’s more likely to be “Danel” or “Danil”. And, Ezekiel’s Daniel being closest to the Ugaritic DN’IL, suggests that DN’IL was <em>also</em> “Danel”. That’s how most modern scholars now transliterate the name.</p>

<p>So yes, I may have been chasing a false Daniel this whole time. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LMr5XTgeyI">Theophanu is not Tiffany</a>, after all. Maybe “Daniel” is <em>at best</em> attested from 600 BCE, putting it in contention with things like Debrah and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhou_dynasty">Zhou</a>. There is a <em>tradition</em> to pronounce the Ezekiel DN’IL as “Daniel”, so it could be the actual pronunciation and the Yud was added later. I don’t know when the tradition started, though. At the very least, this strengthens the connection between Ezekiel’s דנאל and the Ugarite’s 𐎄𐎐𐎛𐎍: Ezekiel was working off a different name than the rest of the Torah authors.</p>

<p>Then again, maybe this is all just quibbling over specifics. The Latin alphabet wasn’t meant for Canaanite names, and the Hebrew alphabet wasn’t meant for Ugaritic ones. The Biblical שרה could be Romanized as “Sarah” or “Sara”, חנכה could be Hannukah, Channuka, or Chanukah. Maybe it doesn’t matter whether 𐎄𐎐𐎛𐎍  is דניאל or Danel or דנאל or Daniel. It’s still the same name.</p>

<p>Regardless, we’re following a chain, and there’s still one more link.</p>

<h3 id="from-daniel-to-today">From Daniel to Today</h3>

<p>There’s one last question here: lots of people use Torah names, like Sarah and Benjamin and David. But many Torah names, like Tamar and Yehuda and Hillel, are only used by Jews. Why is Daniel in the former group and not the latter?</p>

<p>I’d speculate that the difference is how likely it is for a <em>Christian</em> reader to encounter the name. “Adam” appears in the first book of Genesis, while Shamgar is a minor figure in the book of Judges. Christians would most likely encounter names that appear either really early, have entertaining stories, or are directly relevant to the New Testament.</p>

<p>And here’s where we finally get to the last link between then and now: the Book of Daniel. Like the Book of Ezekiel, this recounts the story of someone living during the Babylonian exile. <em>Unlike</em> Ezekiel, it was pretty clearly <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/3209969">written four hundred years after</a> the exile. Daniel contains an awful lot of prophecies that <a href="https://www.thetorah.com/article/chanukah-daniel-11-and-the-rabbis-limited-knowledge-of-history">seem <em>very</em> relevant to the Greek occupation</a> (the one that leads to the story of Channukah).  The most famous of them is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophecy_of_Seventy_Weeks">prophecy of 70 weeks</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And you shall know and understand that from the emergence of the word to restore and to rebuild Jerusalem until the anointed king [shall be] seven weeks, and [for] sixty-two weeks it will return and be built street and moat, but in troubled times. — Daniel 9:25</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Later writers took this to be a prophecy about <em>Jesus</em>. I don’t admit to understand <em>how</em> it’s supposed to be about Jesus, but it is. So the book of Daniel is really important in Christian thought. This kept  the name “Daniel” in the Christian mainstream for the next 2000 years, carrying it across the world to  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Gabriel_Fahrenheit">Europe</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniyal_Mirza">India</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Nushiro">East Asia</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Paiola">South America</a>, all the way to the present daytoday. The end of a 3400 year chain.</p>

<hr>

<p>So that’s the story of the name of Daniel, from an ancient clay tablet to the millions of Daniels alive now.</p>

<p>I want to reiterate that <strong>I’m not a trained historian</strong> and almost certainly got a lot of details wrong. Also, this isn’t and wouldn’t pass peer review. Don’t cite this for a class paper. Happy April Cools!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p>Scientists at a recently opened cancer institute at <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/cambridge" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Cambridge</a> University have begun work that is pinpointing changes in cells many years before they develop into tumours. The research should help design radically new ways to treat cancer, they say.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.earlycancer.cam.ac.uk/" data-link-name="in body link">Early Cancer Institute</a> – which has just received £11m from an anonymous donor – is focused on finding ways to tackle tumours before they produce symptoms. The research will exploit recent discoveries which have shown that many people develop precancerous conditions that lie in abeyance for long periods.</p><p>“The latency for a cancer to develop can go on for years, sometimes for a decade or two, before the condition abruptly manifests itself to patients,” said Prof Rebecca Fitzgerald, the institute’s director.</p><p>“Then doctors find they are struggling to treat a tumour which, by then, has spread through a patient’s body. We need a different approach, one that can detect a person at risk of cancer early on using tests that can be given to large numbers of people.”</p><p>One example of this is the <a href="https://www.nhsinform.scot/tests-and-treatments/non-surgical-procedures/cytosponge/" data-link-name="in body link">cytosponge</a> – a sponge on a string – which has been developed by Fitzgerald and her team. It is swallowed like a pill, expands in the stomach into a sponge and is then pulled up the gullet collecting oesophagus cells on the way. Those cells that contain a protein, called TFF3 – which is found only in precancerous cells – then provide an early warning that a patient is at risk of oesophageal cancer and needs to be monitored. Crucially, this test can be administered simply and on a wide scale.</p><p>This contrasts with current approaches to other cancers, added Fitzgerald. “At present, we are detecting many cancers late and are having to come up with medicines, which have become incrementally more expensive. We are often extending life by a few weeks at a cost of tens of thousands of pounds. We need to look at this from a different perspective.”</p><p>One approach being taken by the institute – which is to be renamed the Li Ka-shing Early <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/cancer" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Cancer</a> Institute after the Hong Kong philanthropist who has supported other Cambridge cancer research – focuses on blood samples. Provided by women as part of past screening services for ovarian cancer and kept in special stores, these samples have now been repurposed by the institute. “We have around 200,000 such samples and they are a goldmine,” said Jamie Blundell, a research group leader at the institute.</p><p>Using these samples, researchers have identified changes that differentiate those donors who have subsequently been diagnosed with a blood cancer 10 or even 20 years after they provided samples, with those who did not develop such conditions.</p><p>“We are finding that there are clear genetic changes in a person’s blood more than a decade before they start to display symptoms of leukaemia,” said Blundell. “That shows there is a long window of opportunity that you could use to intervene and give treatments that will reduce the odds of going on to get cancer.”</p><p>Cancers grow in stages and by spotting those with cells that have taken an early step on this ladder, it should be possible to block or hamper further developments. The crucial point is that at this early stage there is time for doctors to take action and avoid them having to deal with a cancer at a late stage when it has spread.</p><p>A similar strategy is being taken by Harveer Dev, another group leader, who has investigated men who have had their prostates removed. His team are now developing biomarkers that will provide better ways to pinpoint those who are likely to suffer poor outcomes from prostate cancer, one of the most common tumours in the UK.</p><p>“Our pilot data suggests that these tests may be much better than existing PSA tests and will be crucial in spotting those who with prostate cancer that is likely to progress,” said Dev.</p><p>Pinpointing those at risk of cancer – for example, people from families who have an inherited predisposition to tumours – will form a key part of the institute’s strategy. In addition, it will focus on finding ways to reduce cancer risks, as well as ensuring treatments can be widely administered.</p><p>A woman had, in her 80s, decided to leave the university £1m for cancer research, Fitzgerald said. “However, she lived until she was over 100 and only died recently, so we only just got that donation. We want to understand what makes some live into very old age while others get cancer, so more people can live as long as she did.”</p></div></div>]]></description>

It’s the fundamental industry on which everything else is built. We take it for granted. In 1989, 35% of the entire software industry was manufacturing systems. Back then, services, hand holding, customization, and consulting were necessary to get the systems to where they are today. What was the first massive burst in productivity from technology has stagnated into incremental diminishing returns and exponentially increasing complexity. We can only continue to add complexity for so much longer until the whole system collapses. "Any intelligent fool can make things bigger and more complex. It takes a touch of genius and a lot of courage to move in the opposite direction." Manufacturing is important. We must deliver a touch of technological genius to reintroduce simplicity, efficiency, and integration.

        <p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-ab594e69-758c-6bf4-fc3a-34822961400f"><span>At the edge of Aneyoshi, a small village on Japan’s northeastern coast, a 10-foot-tall stone tablet stands, carved with a dire warning to locals.</span></span></p>

<p><span>"High dwellings are the peace and harmony of our descendants," the rock slab says. "Remember the calamity of the great tsunamis. Do not build any homes below this point."</span></p>

<p><span>While the Aneyoshi tablet might be the most straightforward, so-called “tsunami stones” dot Japan’s coastline, warning the carvers’ descendants to seek high ground after earthquakes in case they foreshadow destructive waves. The stones vary in degrees of repair, with most dating back to around 1896, when two deadly tsunamis killed about 22,000 people, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/21/world/asia/21stones.html?_r=2">Martin Fackler writes for <em>The New York Times</em></a>.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-ab594e69-758c-6bf4-fc3a-34822961400f"><span>“The tsunami stones are warnings across generations, telling descendants to avoid the same suffering of their ancestors,” Itoko Kitahara, a historian of natural disasters at Ritsumeikan University in Kyoto, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/21/world/asia/21stones.html?_r=2">told Fackler in 2011</a> after an earthquake killed nearly 29,000 people. </span></span><span>“Some places heeded these lessons of the past, but many didn’t,” Kitahara </span><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/21/world/asia/21stones.html?_r=2">told Fackler</a><span>.</span></p>

<p><span>Over the decades, the stones’ warnings were disregarded or forgotten by many as coastal towns boomed and people placed their faith in massive seawalls built by the Japanese government. But in some places like Aneyoshi, residents still heeded the tsunami stones’ warnings.</span></p>

<p><span>"Everybody here knows about the markers. We studied them in school," 12-year-old Yuto Kimura told <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/ancient-stone-markers-warned-of-tsunamis/">the Associated Press in 2011</a>. "When the tsunami came, my mom got me from school and then the whole village climbed to higher ground."</span></p>

<p><span>Aneyoshi’s tsunami stone is the only one found that explicitly describes where to build houses, but centuries of tsunamis have also left their marks on the names of places in the region, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/21/world/asia/21stones.html?_r=2">Fackler writes</a>. While some places have names like “Valley of the Survivors” and “Wave’s Edge” that might indicate ground high enough to escape a massive wave, places that weren’t so lucky might instead be named “Octopus Grounds,” after the sea life left behind in the rubble.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-ab594e69-758c-6bf4-fc3a-34822961400f"><span>"It takes about three generations for people to forget. Those that experience the disaster themselves pass it to their children and their grandchildren, but then the memory fades," Fumihiko Imamura, a professor in disaster planning at Tohoku University, <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/ancient-stone-markers-warned-of-tsunamis/">told the AP</a>.</span></span></p>



<p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-ab594e69-758c-6bf4-fc3a-34822961400f"><span>Four years later, <a href="http://www.livescience.com/39110-japan-2011-earthquake-tsunami-facts.html">parts of Japan are still recovering</a> from the March 2011 tsunami, with about 230,000 people still living in temporary housing. The tsunami and accompanying earthquake were also responsible for the Fukushima Daiichi disaster, when equipment damaged during the &nbsp;disaster triggered a nuclear meltdown</span></span></p>

<p>Here is a simple process for shipping software projects that works. First, decompose the project into a stream<a href="#footnote-1AV3" id="ref-1AV3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> of headlines. Then pick an aggressive date to ship the first headline and work like hell to meet that date. Have everyone work only on one headline at a time– the upcoming one. Ignore everything else. Don’t work on anything that doesn’t help you ship the headline. Once the headline is shipped, switch to the next headline in the stream and repeat. That’s all, you can fire your agile consultant.</p>
<p>A headline is a very short sentence that contains only the highest order bit, with all the other bits culled. Imagine you bump into someone on the street after not having seen them for a few months and they ask what you’ve been up to. What kinds of responses work well in this situation?<span></span> <span>“</span>I trekked through Southeast Asia”,<span></span> <span>“</span>I switched jobs”,<span></span> <span>“</span>I got married”. Software release headlines work the same way.<span></span> <span>“</span>You can now rent VMs through an <span>API</span><span></span><span>”</span>,<span></span> <span>“</span>we rolled out <span>FSD</span> autopilot”,<span></span> <span>“</span>Treasury is available in India”.</p>
<p>Headline driven development works really well for three reasons.</p>
<p>First, headlines is how humans process change. If you ever found your users confused, your boss frustrated, your investors anxious, your peers indifferent– these problems go away when you organize communication around a stream of headlines. But it doesn’t work as an afterthought. Communicating through headlines but developing in some other way is like leading a double life. It gets too messy. So to communicate with headlines you must develop with headlines too.</p>
<p>Second, it makes it easy to ruthlessly prioritize. If you can credibly ship a headline without something, cut that something. For example, suppose you’re working on your Southeast Asia trek headline and you’re planning to visit six countries. Can you credibly say to your friends<span></span> <span>“</span>I trekked through Southeast Asia” only having visited five countries instead of six? Obviously yes. So one of the countries gets cut. How about four countries? Repeatedly go through this exercise and stop before the credibility of the headline is at risk. You want to do the minimum possible amount of work that still leaves the headline credible.</p>
<p>Third, the deadline effect is real. Most of the work in college happens at midnight before the project is due. The industry isn’t that different. So simulating class assignments turns out to be a very effective way to ship quickly. You need a discrete chunk of work, with an arbitrary deadline<a href="#footnote-2AV3" id="ref-2AV3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>, and a binary outcome. You get this with headlines– a headline has either shipped by a given timestamp or it hasn’t.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p>The discrete Fourier transform (DFT) is one of the most important algorithms in modern computing: it plays a key role in communications,  image and audio processing, machine learning, data compression, and much more. Curiously, it’s also among the worst explained topics in computer science. For example, the Wikipedia article on the matter assaults the reader with around three dozen cryptic formulas, but offers no accessible explanation how or why the algorithm works.</p><p>My goal today is to change this. Let’s start with the basics: DFT takes a time-domain waveform — for example, an audio track — and turns it into frequency-domain data: a series of sine wave intensities that describe the underlying signal. If summed back together, these sine waves of different frequencies, phases, and magnitudes should faithfully recreate the original waveform.</p><p><span>To illustrate the utility of DFT, let’s have a look at a conventional waveform representation of a </span><a href="https://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/police.mp3" rel="">🔈 police siren</a><span> next to its frequency-domain treatment.

For example, when it comes to music, we can easily isolate specific instruments, remove unwanted AC hum, or pitch-shift the vocals. With the edits done, we can then convert the data back to to the time-domain waveform. Indeed, the infamous Auto-Tune pitch corrector, employed by some pop singers to cover up the lack of skill, is one of many applications of DFT.</p><p>To get it out of the way, let’s start with the official formula — which to a layperson, is rather opaque:</p><div data-component-name="Latex"><p><span>\(F_k = \sum\limits_{n=0}^{N-1} s_n \cdot e^{-i 2 \pi k\frac{n}{N} }\)</span></p></div><p><span>In this equation, </span><em><span>F</span><sub>k</sub></em><sub> </sub><span>is the DFT value (“coefficient”) for a particular frequency bin </span><em>k. </em><span>Bin numbers are integers corresponding to fractions of the input sample rate.

Imagine a mechanical arm rotating at a constant angular speed. The arm is holding a pen that makes contact with a piece of drawing paper.

We can even quantify the component’s magnitude by measuring the deviation of the shape from the center of rotation.</span></p><p><span>The discrete Fourier transform boils down to this exact operation. It takes a sequence of </span><em>N</em><span> values in the input window and distributes them radially in two dimensions at a given speed, completing </span><em>k </em><span>rotations. It then sums the resulting coordinates (the ∑ part). The distance from the center of rotation to the computed midpoint is the magnitude of the calculated frequency component; the angle of the vector is the (sometimes disregarded) phase of the waveform. Note that some popular online sources mistakenly state that the </span><em>x</em><span> axis component is the magnitude; this is incorrect.</span></p><p><span>This algorithm can be implemented with polar coordinates — angle and distance — mimicking what we did above.

    out_buf[bin_no] = sum;
  }

}</code></pre></blockquote><p><span>The code accepts and outputs complex numbers; for real number inputs, </span><em>in_buf</em><span> can be changed to </span><em>double*</em><span>. To convert the resulting complex coefficients in </span><em>out_buf</em><span> to magnitude, call </span><em>cabs(). </em><span>To get phase information (in radians), use </span><em>carg().</em></p><p><span>Let’s start with the maximum frequency range. If the input data consists of real numbers, the DFT will produce useful output only up to the so-called Nyquist frequency — that is, one half of the sample rate. This frequency component can be found in the bin at </span><em>k = N/2</em><span>.  The coefficients above that can and sometimes need to be computed — but perhaps a bit surprisingly, they just contain mirrored data from the lower-frequency bins.</span></p><p>To understand why this is happening, consider the following animation of our rotating arm. In the video, the arm is spinning so fast in relation to the input sample rate that successive samples are placed more than 180° apart. In fact, the angular distance is 330°, suggesting that we’re running the DFT at ~92% of the input sample rate:</p><div id="vimeo-923565902" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;923565902&quot;,&quot;videoKey&quot;:&quot;e1f3e178d8&quot;,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true}" data-component-name="VimeoToDOM"><p><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/923565902?autoplay=0&amp;h=e1f3e178d8" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" loading="lazy"></iframe></p></div><p>After watching the clip, it should become clear that the end result is identical to what would be produced by a much slower arm spinning in the opposite direction.</p><p>The coefficient mirroring behavior is an artifact of the DFT algorithm, but the curse of the Nyquist frequency itself is not. It’s a fundamental bandwidth limitation for signal sampling techniques: above it, there’s simply not enough samples available to faithfully discern the frequency. The Nyquist limit is the reason why music is commonly recorded at ~44 kHz, even though our hearing only goes up to about 20 kHz (and only on a good day).</p><p>The other limitation of DFT has to do with frequency separation. A discrete Fourier transform that could use an infinitely-long sample window would have perfect selectivity — that is, it would be able to precisely discern chosen frequencies while rejecting everything else. In practice, DFT is run on finite sample windows, causing each bin to pick up something extra.</p><p><span>To understand the cause, let’s assume we’re doing DFT with bins spaced three hertz apart — i.e., </span><em><span>F</span><sub>0</sub></em><span> is the DC component, </span><em><span>F</span><sub>1</sub></em><span> is 3 Hz, and </span><em><span>F</span><sub>2</sub></em><span> is 6 Hz. The </span><em><span>F</span><sub>1</sub></em><span> bin is always calculated by completing a single turn (the timing expression is </span><em>k × 2π</em><span> and </span><em>k = 1). </em><span>But with an input signal frequency of 2 Hz, we’d need three turns to form a closed shape. Instead, we run out of time — and out of input samples — by the time we’ve drawn only one off-center lobe:</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F168cb46f-d1b4-4d94-840d-3af82284702d_1200x1200.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F168cb46f-d1b4-4d94-840d-3af82284702d_1200x1200.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F168cb46f-d1b4-4d94-840d-3af82284702d_1200x1200.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F168cb46f-d1b4-4d94-840d-3af82284702d_1200x1200.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F168cb46f-d1b4-4d94-840d-3af82284702d_1200x1200.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F168cb46f-d1b4-4d94-840d-3af82284702d_1200x1200.png" width="1200" height="1200" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/168cb46f-d1b4-4d94-840d-3af82284702d_1200x1200.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1200,&quot;width&quot;:1200,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:41860,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F168cb46f-d1b4-4d94-840d-3af82284702d_1200x1200.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F168cb46f-d1b4-4d94-840d-3af82284702d_1200x1200.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F168cb46f-d1b4-4d94-840d-3af82284702d_1200x1200.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F168cb46f-d1b4-4d94-840d-3af82284702d_1200x1200.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption><em><span>The limitations of DFT: a nearby frequency creeping into the F</span><sub>1 </sub><span>bin.</span></em></figcaption></figure></div><p><span>In practice, the plot ends up badly off-center only if the two frequencies are quite close to each other.

Nothing stops us from calculating ad-hoc DFT coefficients for any non-integer </span><em>k </em><span>in between, but these “partial-turn” bins don’t extract any new, finer-grained information from the system. If you need better frequency discrimination, you gotta up the window size.</span></p><p><span>This brings us to temporal resolution: the transform needs a certain number of samples to work. Selectivity aside, at the very minimum, you must use a window long enough so that the bottom bin (</span><em><span>F</span><sub>1</sub></em><span>) corresponds to the lowest frequency you wish to discern; for example, if you have a 44 kHz audio stream and want to measure down to 20 Hz, you need a window of 2,200 samples — spanning 50 milliseconds — per each DFT.</span></p><p>Yet, within that chosen time window, the algorithm just outputs frequency intensities; this doesn’t make it easy to pinpoint when a particular tone starts or ends, or whether its intensity is going up or down. Indeed, sharp signal discontinuities within the analysis window produce wide-spectrum “halos” that are hard to interpret as any specific frequency.</p><p>It follows that various workarounds, such as the use of overlapping windows, weighted sampling, or specialized aliasing methods might be necessary to get acceptable temporal resolution in certain applications; audio processing tends to be one of them.</p><p><span>The inverse discrete Fourier transform is conceptually simple. It boils down to generating waveforms for to every previously-calculated frequency bin, adjusting their magnitude and phase in accordance with the DFT-produced </span><em><span>F</span><sub>k</sub></em><span> coefficients, and then summing the results to recreate the contents of the time-domain sample window (</span><em><span>s</span><sub>0</sub></em><span> to </span><em><span>s</span><sub>N-1</sub></em><span>). </span></p><p>Here’s the IDFT formula that does just that:</p><div data-component-name="Latex"><p><span>\(s_n = \frac{1}{N} { \sum\limits_{k=0}^{N-1} F_k \cdot e^{i{{2 \pi n \frac{k}{N} }}} } \)</span></p></div><p>Note the similarity of this equation to the forward DFT formula. There is an important symmetry in respect to inputs and outputs at the core of the algorithm; this is known as orthogonality. In a mildly mind-bending sense, the frequency domain is just the time domain turned “inside out”.</p><p>Here’s a simple implementation of IDFT in C:</p><blockquote><pre><code>void idft(complex* out_buf, complex* in_buf, uint32_t len) {

  for (int s_no = 0; s_no &lt; len; s_no++) {
    complex sum = 0;
    for (int bin_no = 0; bin_no &lt; len; bin_no++)
      sum += in_buf[bin_no] * cexp(2 * I * M_PI * s_no * bin_no / len);
    out_buf[s_no] = sum / len;
  }

}</code></pre></blockquote><p><span>As earlier, if working with real-number signals, </span><em>out_buf</em><span> can be declared as </span><em>double* </em><span>instead.</span></p><p>Remarkably, forward DFT followed by IDFT is lossless - i.e., it gets you the exact same time-domain data that you started with. In practice, some attention should be paid to the precision of floating-point calculations to avoid cumulative errors, but it’s usually not a big deal.</p><p><span>The DFT is perfectly adequate except for one tiny problem: even if we precompute the exponentiation part, the algorithm still involves </span><em>K × N </em><span>complex-number multiplications. Because the number of computed bins (</span><em>K</em><span>) is frequently the same as window size (</span><em>N</em><span>), some computer science buffs with a penchant for vagueness describe the computational complexity of DFT as </span><em>O(n²)</em><span>.</span></p><p><span>This is where fast Fourier transform (FFT) comes to play; FFT is still a discrete Fourier transform and it produces the same results, but the calculation is cleverly optimized for large input windows and for the </span><em>K = N</em><span> use case (the algorithm can’t be used to selectively compute only some frequency bins). </span></p><p><span>The performance gains are due to a technique known as the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooley%E2%80%93Tukey_FFT_algorithm" rel="">radix-2 Cooley-Tukey algorithm</a><span>. The derivation of this optimization is somewhat involved, but on a high level, it involves iteratively splitting the full DFT calculation into smaller sub-sums, and then exploiting the fact that the </span><em><span>e</span><sup>-i2</sup></em><sup>π</sup><em><sup>kn/N</sup></em><span> expression is periodic — it literally goes in circles! — to factor out many redundant multiplications. For larger windows, the resulting complexity of FFT approaches </span><em>O(n ⋅ log₂ n</em><span>), which is a pretty substantial improvement.</span></p><p><span>Numerous reference FFT implementations exist for </span><a href="https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform" rel="">almost every language imaginable</a><span>; a particularly clean, minimalistic C implementation for power-of-two window sizes is as follows:</span></p><blockquote><pre><code>void __fft_int(complex* buf, complex* tmp, 
               const uint32_t len, const uint32_t step) {

}

void in_place_fft(complex* buf, const uint32_t len) {
  complex tmp[len];
  memcpy(tmp, buf, sizeof(tmp));
  __fft_int(buf, tmp, len, 1);
}</code></pre></blockquote><p><span>Turning this code into inverse FFT (IFFT) boils down to removing the minus sign in the </span><em>cexp(…) </em><span>expression and dividing the final values by </span><em>len. </em></p><p><span>Again, in practical applications, it would be wise to precompute the results of complex exponentiation; the value depends only on the </span><em>pos </em><span>index and the chosen window size.</span></p><p>Discrete cosine transform can be thought of as a partial, real-numbers-only version of DFT. Just like discrete Fourier, it converts time-domain samples into a frequency spectrum. And just like DFT, it gets there by multiplying input data by cosine waveforms and then summing the results to obtain a bunch of binned coefficients.</p><p>That said, this description falls a bit short; the algorithm differs from discrete Fourier in a handful of interesting ways. First, let’s have a look at the usual formula for DCT-II, the most common variation of DCT:</p><div data-component-name="Latex"><p><span>\(F_k = \sum\limits_{n=0}^{N-1} s_n \cdot cos ( \pi k { n + \frac12 \over N} )\)</span></p></div><p><span>If you scroll back to the DFT equation, you might notice that in the formula above, </span><em>k</em><span> is multiplied by π (180°) instead of 2π (360°). In effect, the waveform-generating part uses an interleaved pattern of full-turn and partial-turn bins, running at half the frequency of DFT and putting F</span><sub>N-1 </sub><span>at the Nyquist limit. This change isn’t just about being more efficient: if you try to switch the timing expression back to </span><em>2π</em><span>, the entire algorithm goes sideways and many frequency bins start reading zero. In a moment, we’ll discuss why.</span></p><p><span>The other new element is the </span><em>+½</em><span> offset in the timing expression. Recall that sample numbers run from </span><em>n = 0</em><span> to </span><em>N - 1</em><span>, so dividing </span><em>n </em><span>by </span><em>N </em><span>leaves a gap on the upper end of the range. A +</span><em>½ </em><span>shift centers the waveform; the symmetry is important for making the inverse function work. Discrete Fourier doesn’t use this because its symmetry comes from the more basic relationship between cosine and sine in the complex plane.</span></p><p>The usual inverse DCT-II (IDCT-II) formula is:</p><div data-component-name="Latex"><p><span>\(s_n = \frac{1}{N} \sum\limits_{k=0}^{N-1} F_k \cdot w_k \cdot cos [ \pi (n + \frac12) {k \over N} ]\)</span></p></div><p><span>The </span><em><span>w</span><sub>k</sub></em><span> value is</span><em> 1</em><span> for the DC bin (</span><em>k = 0</em><span>) and 2 for all the subsequent partial-turn bins (</span><em>k &gt; 0</em><span>). You might encounter variants that put </span><em><span>w</span><sub>k</sub></em><span> and the scaling factor (</span><em>1/N</em><span>) in the forward DCT formula instead; heck, some authors split the factors between DCT and IDCT. These changes result in differently-scaled coefficients, but the overall operation is the same.</span></p><p>Now, let’s examine the fundamental mechanism of discrete cosine transform. Imagine we’re working with one second’s worth of data sampled at 2 kHz. With DFT, we get N / 2 = 1,000 usable frequency bins before hitting the Nyquist limit (1 kHz); bin spacing is 1 Hz. With the cosine transform, we’re getting N = 2,000 bins representing DC to Nyquist in 0.5 Hz increments. </p><p><span>Let’s pick the 4 Hz bin (</span><em><span>F</span><sub>8</sub></em><span>). First, consider what happens if we’re analyzing an input signal that’s running at 8 Hz. The image shows the reference 4 Hz waveform for the bin (blue), followed the input frequency (green), and then the computed product of the two (red). The product is centered around the </span><em>x</em><span> axis, so the DCT coefficient is zero:</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feed1e143-eb67-4342-9a18-906a2be4bb92_2092x1024.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feed1e143-eb67-4342-9a18-906a2be4bb92_2092x1024.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feed1e143-eb67-4342-9a18-906a2be4bb92_2092x1024.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feed1e143-eb67-4342-9a18-906a2be4bb92_2092x1024.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feed1e143-eb67-4342-9a18-906a2be4bb92_2092x1024.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feed1e143-eb67-4342-9a18-906a2be4bb92_2092x1024.png" width="1456" height="713" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/eed1e143-eb67-4342-9a18-906a2be4bb92_2092x1024.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:713,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:130190,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feed1e143-eb67-4342-9a18-906a2be4bb92_2092x1024.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feed1e143-eb67-4342-9a18-906a2be4bb92_2092x1024.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feed1e143-eb67-4342-9a18-906a2be4bb92_2092x1024.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feed1e143-eb67-4342-9a18-906a2be4bb92_2092x1024.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption><em>DCT: mismatched frequencies.</em></figcaption></figure></div><p><span>But what if the frequencies (and phases) match?

Within this “partial-turn” bin’s measurement window, the average product is positive. If we go to the next “full-turn” bin (5 Hz), the product of the waveforms is once again zero.</p><p><span>In other words, DCT bins encode magnitude </span><strong>and</strong><span> phase information, just not always where we’re expecting it. This explains why the transform needs twice as many bins — and why trying to increase their spacing to match DFT breaks the algorithm.</span></p><p>This messy encoding scheme makes discrete cosine transform a fairly poor tool for most signal analysis tasks. That said, it’s great for fast, space-efficient compression algorithms where the aesthetics of the frequency-domain representation don’t matter much. A classic example is the JPEG image format, which performs DCT on 8×8 pixel tiles and then quantizes (i.e., reduces the precision of) the calculated coefficients to make them easier to compress using conventional lossless compression (Huffman coding). </p><p>Oh — if you wish to experiment with DCT-II, a simple implementation is included below:</p><blockquote><pre><code><code>void dct(double* out_buf, double* in_buf, uint32_t len) {

  for (uint32_t bin_no = 0; bin_no &lt; len; bin_no++) {
    double sum = 0;
    for (uint32_t s_no = 0; s_no &lt; len; s_no++)
      sum += in_buf[s_no] * cos(M_PI * bin_no * (s_no + 0.5) / len);
    out_buf[bin_no] = sum;
  }

}

void idct(double* out_buf, double* in_buf, uint32_t len) {

  for (uint32_t s_no = 0; s_no &lt; len; s_no++) {
    double sum = 0;
    for (uint32_t bin_no = 0; bin_no &lt; len; bin_no++)
      sum += in_buf[bin_no] * cos(M_PI * (s_no + 0.5) * bin_no/ len) *
             (bin_no? 2 : 1);
    out_buf[s_no] = sum / len;
  }

<p>On Friday, researchers revealed the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/03/backdoor-found-in-widely-used-linux-utility-breaks-encrypted-ssh-connections/">discovery</a> of a backdoor that was intentionally planted in xz Utils, an open-source data compression utility available on almost all installations of Linux and other Unix-like operating systems. The person or people behind this project likely spent years on it. They were likely very close to seeing the backdoor update merged into Debian and Red Hat, the two biggest distributions of Linux when an eagle-eyed software developer spotted something fishy.</p>
<p>"This might be the best executed supply chain attack we've seen described in the open, and it's a nightmare scenario: malicious, competent, authorized upstream in a widely used library," software and cryptography engineer Filippo Valsorda <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/filippo.abyssdomain.expert/post/3kouaom62oi2b">said</a> of the effort, which came frightfully close to succeeding.
</p><p>Researchers have spent the weekend gathering clues. Here's what we know so far.</p>
<p><b>What is xz Utils?</b></p>
<p>xz Utils is nearly ubiquitous in Linux. It provides lossless data compression on virtually all Unix-like operating systems, including Linux. xz Utils provides critical functions for compressing and decompressing data during all kinds of all kinds of operations. xz Utils also supports the legacy .lzma format, making this component even more crucial.</p>
<p><b>What happened?</b></p>
<p>Andres Freund, a developer and engineer working on Microsoft’s PostgreSQL offerings, was recently troubleshooting performance problems a Debian system was experiencing with SSH, the most widely used protocol for remotely logging into devices over the Internet. Specifically, SSH logins were consuming too many CPU cycles and were generating errors with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/04/what-we-know-about-the-xz-utils-backdoor-that-almost-infected-the-world/link">valgrind</a>, a utility for monitoring computer memory.</p>
<p>Through a combination of sheer luck and Freund’s careful eye, he eventually discovered the problems were the result of updates that had been made to xz Utils. On Friday, Freund took to the Open Source Security List to disclose the updates were the result of someone intentionally planting a backdoor in the compression software.</p>
<p><b>What does the backdoor do?</b></p>
<p>Malicious code added to xz Utils versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 modified the way the software functions when performing operations related to lzma compression or decompression. When these functions involved SSH, they allowed for malicious code to be executed with root privileges. This code allowed someone in possession of a predetermined encryption key to log into the backdoored system over SSH. From then on, that person would have the same level of control as any authorized administrator.</p>
<p><b>How did this backdoor come to be?</b></p>
<p>It would appear that this backdoor was years in the making. In 2021, someone with the username JiaT75 made their <a href="https://github.com/libarchive/libarchive/pull/1609">first known commit</a> to an open-source project. In retrospect, the <a href="https://github.com/libarchive/libarchive/pull/1609">change</a> to the libarchive project is suspicious, because it replaced the safe_fprint funcion with a variant that’s long been recognized as less secure. No one noticed at the time.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>The following year, JiaT75 submited a patch over the xz Utils mailing list, and almost immediately, a never-before-seen participant named Jigar Kumar joined the discussion and argued that Lasse Collin, the longtime maintainer of xz Utils, hadn’t been updating the software often or fast enough. Kumar, with the support of Dennis Ens and several other people who had never had a presence on the list, pressured Collin to bring on an additional developer to maintain the project.</p>
<p>In January 2023, JiaT75,made their <a href="https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/pull/7">first commit</a> to xz Utils. In the months following, JiaT75, who used the name Jia Tan, became increasingly involved in xz Utils affairs. For instance, Tan replaced Collins's contact information with their own on oss-fuzz, a project that scans open-source software for vulnerabilities that can be exploited. Tan also requested that oss-fuzz disable the ifunc function during testing, a change that prevented it from detecting the malicious changes Tan would soon make to xz Utils.</p>
<p>In February of this year, Tan issued commits for versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 of xz Utils. The updates implemented the backdoor. In the following weeks, Tan or others appeal to developers of Ubuntu, Red Hat, and Debian to merge the updates into their OSes. Eventually, one of the two updates made its way into the following releases, <a href="https://www.tenable.com/blog/frequently-asked-questions-cve-2024-3094-supply-chain-backdoor-in-xz-utils">according to</a> security firm Tenable:</p>

<p><b>Can you say more about what this backdoor does?</b></p>
<p>In a nutshell, it allows someone with the right private key to hijack sshd, the executable file responsible for making SSH connections, and from there to execute malicious commands. The backdoor is implemented through a five-stage loader that uses a series of simple but clever techniques to hide itself. It also provides the means for new payloads to be delivered without major changes being required.</p>
<p>Multiple people who have reverse engineered the updates have much more to say about the backdoor.</p>
<p>Developer Sam James provided <a href="https://gist.github.com/thesamesam/223949d5a074ebc3dce9ee78baad9e27">this overview</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>This backdoor has several components. At a high level:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">The release tarballs upstream publishes don't have the same code that GitHub has. This is common in C projects so that downstream consumers don't need to remember how to run autotools and autoconf. The version of build-to-host.m4 in the release tarballs differs wildly from the upstream on GitHub.</li>
<li aria-level="1">There are crafted test files in the tests/ folder within the git repository too. These files are in the following commits:
<ul>
<li aria-level="2">tests/files/bad-3-corrupt_lzma2.xz (<a href="https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/commit/cf44e4b7f5dfdbf8c78aef377c10f71e274f63c0">cf44e4b7f5dfdbf8c78aef377c10f71e274f63c0</a>,<a href="https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/commit/74b138d2a6529f2c07729d7c77b1725a8e8b16f1"> 74b138d2a6529f2c07729d7c77b1725a8e8b16f1</a>)</li>
<li aria-level="2">tests/files/good-large_compressed.lzma (<a href="https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/commit/cf44e4b7f5dfdbf8c78aef377c10f71e274f63c0">cf44e4b7f5dfdbf8c78aef377c10f71e274f63c0</a>,<a href="https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/commit/74b138d2a6529f2c07729d7c77b1725a8e8b16f1"> 74b138d2a6529f2c07729d7c77b1725a8e8b16f1</a>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li aria-level="1">A script called by build-to-host.m4 that unpacks this malicious test data and uses it to modify the build process.</li>
<li aria-level="1">IFUNC, a mechanism in glibc that allows for indirect function calls, is used to perform runtime hooking/redirection of OpenSSH's authentication routines. IFUNC is a tool that is normally used for legitimate things, but in this case it is exploited for this attack path.</li>
</ul>
<p>Normally upstream publishes release tarballs that are different than the automatically generated ones in GitHub. In these modified tarballs, a malicious version of build-to-host.m4 is included to execute a script during the build process.</p>
<p>This script (at least in versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1) checks for various conditions like the architecture of the machine. Here is a snippet of the malicious script that gets unpacked by build-to-host.m4 and an explanation of what it does:</p>
<pre>if ! (echo "$build" | grep -Eq "^x86_64" &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1) &amp;&amp; (echo "$build" | grep -Eq "linux-gnu$" &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1);then</pre>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">If amd64/x86_64 is the target of the build</li>
<li aria-level="1">And if the target uses the name linux-gnu (mostly checks for the use of glibc)</li>
</ul>
<p>It also checks for the toolchain being used:</p>
<pre>if test "x$GCC" != 'xyes' &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1;then
exit 0
fi
if test "x$CC" != 'xgcc' &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1;then
exit 0
fi
LDv=$LD" -v"
if ! $LDv 2&gt;&amp;1 | grep -qs 'GNU ld' &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1;then
exit 0</pre>
<p>And if you are trying to build a Debian or Red Hat package:</p>
<pre>if test -f "$srcdir/debian/rules" || test "x$RPM_ARCH" = "xx86_64";then</pre>
<p>This attack thusly seems to be targeted at amd64 systems running glibc using either Debian or Red Hat derived distributions. Other systems may be vulnerable at this time, but we don't know.</p></blockquote>
<p>In an online interview, developer and reverse engineer HD Moore confirmed the Sam James suspicion that the backdoor targeted either Debian or Red Hat distributions.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>“The attack was sneaky in that it only did the final steps of the backdoor if you were building the library on amd64 (intel x86 64-bit) and were building a Debian or a RPM package (instead of using it for a local installation),” he wrote.</p>
<p>Paraphrasing observations from researchers who collectively spent the weekend analyzing the malicius updates, he continued:</p>
<blockquote><p>When verifying an SSH public key, if the public key matches a certain fingerprint function, the key contents are decrypted using a pre-shared key before the public key is actually verified. The decrypted contents are then passed directly to system.</p>
<p>If the fingerprint doesn't match or the decrypted contents don't match a certain format, it falls back to regular key verification and no-one's the wiser.</p>
<p>The backdoor is super sneaky. It uses a little-known feature of the glibc to hook a function. It only triggers when the backdoored xz library gets loaded by a /usr/bin/sshd process on one of the affected distributions. There may be many other backdoors, but the one everyone is talking about uses the function indirection stuff to add the hook. The payload was encoded into fake xz test files and runs as a shellcode effectively, changing the SSH RSA key verification code so that a magic public key (sent during normal authentication) let the attacker gain access</p>
<p>​​Their grand scheme was:</p>
<p>1) sneakily backdoor the release tarballs, but not the source code</p>
<p>2) use sockpuppet accounts to convince the various Linux distributions to pull the latest version and package it</p>
<p>3) once those distributions shipped it, they could take over any downstream user/company system/etc</p></blockquote>
<p>Additional technical analysis is available from the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/filippo.abyssdomain.expert/post/3kowkezwz6g2q">above</a> Bluesky thread from Valsorda, <a href="https://doublepulsar.com/inside-the-failed-attempt-to-backdoor-ssh-globally-that-got-caught-by-chance-bbfe628fafdd">researcher Kevin Beaumont</a> and <a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/29/4">Freund’s Friday disclosure</a>.</p>
<p><b>What more do we know about Jia Tan?</b></p>
<p>At the moment, extremely little, especially for someone entrusted to steward a piece of software as ubiquitous and as sensitive as xz Utils. This developer persona has touched dozens of other pieces of open-source software in the past few years. At the moment, it’s unknown if there was ever a real-world person behind this username or if Jia Tan is a completely fabricated individual.</p>

<p>In a world first, Austin Health clinicians have implanted an electrical nerve stimulation device into a patient with Crohn’s disease to prevent inflammation recurring after surgery.</p>
<p>The device, developed and manufactured by the Bionics Institute in collaboration with researchers at The Florey and The University of Melbourne, could put Crohn’s sufferers<br>
into long-term remission.</p>
<p>Crohn’s disease is a condition that causes inflammation to the lining of the gut. Most patients with Crohn’s eventually require bowel surgery to remove sections of gut<br>
damaged by inflammation. However, the disease frequently returns, requiring further surgery.</p>
<p>Crohn’s sufferers are also often at the mercy of life-long drug therapies to manage symptoms.</p>
<p>Co-investigator and team leader Professor John Furness, head of The Florey’s Digestive Physiology and Nutrition Laboratories, said this breakthrough therapy could transform the lives of people suffering from Crohn’s disease.</p>

<figure id="attachment_12355" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-12355"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://florey.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/John-Furness-resized-1280x907.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="907"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-12355">Professor John Furness</figcaption></figure>
<blockquote>
<p>“By stimulating anti-inflammatory nerves and addressing inflammation early, the recurrent inflammation and associated scar tissue development can hopefully be prevented altogether, meaning patients will avoid the cycle of surgery and recovery.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Associate Professor Peter De Cruz, Austin Health’s Director of Inflammatory Bowel Disease Service said Crohn’s disease can have significant impacts on the lives of Australians throughout some of the best years of their lives.</p>
<p>“Australia has among the highest incidence of Crohn’s disease in the world, and affects young people in their 20s to 30s at a time when they are trying to study, enter the workforce or commence families.”</p>
<p>Professor James Fallon, CTO and Head of Research at the Bionics Institute leads the team that developed the groundbreaking device, which was this month implanted onto the vagus nerve of Crohn’s patient, Anthony Becker.</p>
<p>Mr Becker has suffered from Crohn’s disease for as long as he can remember, now into his 40s and with a young family, he is determined to tackle the disease head-on to ensure he maintains a quality of life that is free of surgeries.</p>
<p>Anthony was the first patient to receive the stimulation device earlier this month, and despite being on medication for a number of years, he still required surgery.</p>
<p>If this treatment proves successful, he may never need additional surgical treatments to keep his Crohn’s disease at bay.</p>
<p>Professor James Fallon said: “The vagus nerve controls many functions in the body, such as digestion, heart rate and the immune system. The device is made up of tiny electrodes that stimulate the vagus nerve to trigger the body’s natural defences and prevent inflammation from damaging the gut.</p>

Picture: The Bionics Institute</figcaption></figure>
<p>“We have designed the device to be a set-and-forget treatment powered by a small battery under the skin, hopefully allowing patients to continue<br>
their lives without the fear of further surgery.”</p>
<p>“Up to 80 per cent of Crohn’s sufferers will require surgery at some point in their lives. It’s hoped that eventually this new device will work as a set and forget, allowing patients to continue with their lives without the fear of ongoing treatment with medication,” said Associate Professor Peter De Cruz.</p>
<p>If successful, this study will confirm safety and efficacy of the device for Crohn’s sufferers and provide data to understand if remission can be sustained after surgery.</p>

<p>The hearts of the Super Nintendo</p><hr>


<p>When I start studying a vintage system, the first thing I like to do is understand how its components work together at the hardware level<a name="back_1" href="#footnote_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>.
</p>


<p>Every computer has at least one heart which beats the cadence to all the other chips. The <b>C</b>lo<b>CK</b> output pin is connected to a copper line which spreads to most components, into their <code>CLK</code> input pin.</p>

<p>If you are mostly a software person like me, you may have never noticed it but all kinds of processors have a <code>CLK</code> input pin. From CPUs (Motorola 68000<a name="back_2" href="#footnote_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>, Intel Pentium<a name="back_3" href="#footnote_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>, MOS 6502<a name="back_4" href="#footnote_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>), to custom graphic chips (Midway's DMA2<a name="back_5" href="#footnote_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a>, Capcom CPS-A<a name="back_6" href="#footnote_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a>/CPS-B<a name="back_7" href="#footnote_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a>, Sega's Genesis VDP<a name="back_8" href="#footnote_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a>) to audio chips (Yamaha 2151<a name="back_9" href="#footnote_9"><sup>[9]</sup></a>, OKI msm6295<a name="back_10" href="#footnote_10"><sup>[10]</sup></a>), they all have one.</p>


<p>How is the CLK generated?</p><hr><p>The <code>CLK</code> can be generated by two types of components. One is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_oscillator#:~:text=The%20crystal%20oscillator%20circuit%20sustains,and%20size%20of%20the%20crystal">crystal oscillator</a> which usually looks like a flattened capsule. The others are named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceramic_resonator">ceramic resonators</a>. These are <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/snes_hearts/ceramic_resonator_sideview.webp">vertical</a> capacitor which look less high-tech than the crystals (and they also happen to drift over time).
</p>




<p>Let's open it already!</p><hr><p>With this in mind, let's peek inside a Super Nintendo. Can you find the <code>CLK</code> generators on a SNES motherboard? Clue: There are two.</p>

<img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/snes_hearts/Nintendo_SNS-CPU-GPM-02_SNES_Motherboard.webp" width="3095" height="3447" id="mobo"><span><i><small>
<a href="https://consolemods.org/wiki/SNES:SNES_Model_Differences">Source</a>. Click the image to find the CLK generators.
</small></i></span>



<p>Two hearts</p><hr><p>In the X2 slot, the blue thingy is a <code>24.576</code> MHz ceramic resonator. It is located on the side where the audio chips are so it sets the pace of the <b>A</b>udio <b>P</b>rocessing <b>U</b>nit.</p>

<p>In the X1 slot, the yellow one is labeled <code>D21L3</code>. It is a <code>21.300</code> MHz oscillator. It is located near (and sets the pace of) the CPU and the <b>P</b>icture <b>P</b>rocessing <b>U</b>nit.</p>


<p>Documentation discrepancies</p><hr><p>Looking at the Super Nintendo developer guide<a name="back_11" href="#footnote_11"><sup>[11]</sup></a> reveals it does not match our observations.</p>

The diagram shows not two but three oscillators (there is one feeding the CIC chip, responsible for copy-protection). We are missing one!</p>

<p> Moreover, the frequency for the CPU/PPU is documented as <code>21.47727</code>MHz but we found a <code>21.300</code>Mhz oscillator (this is a PAL motherboard, an NTSC one would have featured a <code>21.500</code>Mhz oscillator).</p>

<p>What is going on here?</p>


<p>CPU/PPU: From <code>21.500</code>MHz to <code>21.47727</code>MHz</p><hr><p>If we look at the motherboard again, we will notice a red component in the lower left, just next to the oscillator. This red thingy is a variable capacitor (some people also call it a trimmer capacitor) which turns the <code>21.500</code> MHz frequency into <code>21.47727</code> MHz.</p>

<p>Why did the designers make it adjustable? The likely answer is that Nintendo feared the oscillator would deteriorate over time, and technicians would be able to tune it. They may not have been wrong since a common issue for the Super Nintendo console is to render in black and white. The solution is often to adjust the capacitor (or replace the oscillator)<a name="back_12" href="#footnote_12"><sup>[12]</sup></a>.
</p>

<p>Dividers</p><hr><p>There are only two "master" clocks in the console but none of the processors use them. What happens is that these masters go into dividers to create new clocks. The Ricoh 5A22 CPU for example, runs at 1/6 of the master clock, which results in <code>3.579545</code>MHz. Luckily, the SNES community (and <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/snes_hearts/%3Ca%20href=" https:="" problemkaputt.de="" fullsnes.htm#snestimingoscillators"="">nocash</a> in particular) has documented all these dividers<a name="back_13" href="#footnote_13"><sup>[13]</sup></a>.</p>

  Expansion Port    8.192MHz  (<span color="blue">24.576</span>MHz/3)  
</pre>

<p>In total there are fifteen clocks in the Super Nintendo. Hopefully this solves the mystery of the "missing" oscillator from the documentation.</p>

<p>Enhancement chips</p><hr><p>The <code>SYS-CLK</code> (21.47727MHz) line is fed into the cartridge port. This signal is normally not needed by the components in the cartridge. These are made of ROM containing the game instructions and assets which don't need a clock signal. So why route it there?</p>

<p>The answer is that it allows cartridges to embed processors of their own, called enhancement chips<a name="back_14" href="#footnote_14"><sup>[14]</sup></a>. The most famous of these games is StarFox which features a "mario" SuperFX processor. The MARIO version has an internal divider which halves the clock to <code>10.738635</code>MHz. Later, GSU-1, versions ran at the full <code>21.47727</code>MHz clock.</p>

<p>
<b><u>Trivia:</u></b> There is a second CLK line fed into the cartridge. It is <code>CIC-CLK</code> (3.072MHz) which is fed in the CIC chip located in the cartridge<a name="back_15" href="#footnote_15"><sup>[15]</sup></a>.</p> 


<p>However <code>SYS-CLK</code> (21.47727MHz) was not always suitable. Some games, like Megaman 2 and 3 used a CX4 enhancement chip for graphic effects. If we open a MM2 PCB, we find a <code>20</code> MHz oscillator (X1 slot) which feeds the CX4 <code>CLK</code> pin.

It is highly advanced.</p><figure><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@johnmoeses?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">John Moeses Bauan</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p id="bc92">OpenSSH runs on almost 20 million IPs as of today, and is almost 10 times more prevalent than RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol).

Nobody noticed the problem. Additionally, a request was opened to make the threat actor a Linux kernel module maintainer for XZ Embedded.</p></div><div><h2 id="6991">Q&amp;A</h2><p id="06e7"><strong>Do I need to panic? </strong>No. As an assurance piece, orgs can check they aren’t using the latest unstable releases of Debian and Fedora — but they very likely aren’t.</p><p id="0020">Andres caught the problem — which has allowed it to be evicted from the Linux distribution ecosystem before any stable releases.. released.</p><p id="dc2b">How did Andres find the problem? Well, let us go to Andres:</p><blockquote><p id="118f">“I was doing some micro-benchmarking at the time, needed to quiesce the system to reduce noise. Saw sshd processes were using a surprising amount of CPU, despite immediately failing because of wrong usernames etc. Profiled sshd, showing lots of cpu time in liblzma, with perf unable to attribute it to a symbol. Got suspicious. Recalled that I had seen an odd valgrind complaint in automated testing of postgres, a few weeks earlier, after package updates.</p><p id="3d72">Really required a lot of coincidences.</p><p id="70c0">One more aspect that I think emphasizes the number of coincidences that had to come together to find this:</p><p id="61a5">I run a number “buildfarm” instances for automatic testing of postgres. Among them with valgrind. For some other test instance I had used -fno-omit-frame-pointer for some reason I do not remember. A year or so ago I moved all the test instances to a common base configuration, instead of duplicate configurations. I chose to make all of them use -fno-omit-frame-pointer.</p><p id="edd9">Afaict valgrind would not have complained about the payload without -fno-omit-frame-pointer. It was because _get_cpuid() expected the stack frame to look a certain way.</p><p id="5750">Additionally, I chose to use debian unstable to find possible portability problems earlier. Without that valgrind would have had nothing to complain.</p><p id="7ad7">Without having seen the odd complaints in valgrind, I don’t think I would have looked deeply enough when seeing the high cpu in sshd below _get_cpuid().”</p></blockquote><p id="858a">A couple of points here. First of all, the world owes Andres unlimited free beer. He just saved everybody’s arse in his spare time. I am not joking.</p><p id="5599">Nobody else had raised concerns, and I don’t believe any existing security tooling or processes would have caught this (I realise there will be a torrent of vendors claiming they detect this… but they will detect this <em>now that somebody told them</em>).</p><p id="4a8e">Because Andres privately researched the issue and got the Linux distributions to take it seriously, he averted this reaching any kind of wide (or even small) deployment in the real world.</p><p id="aaa1">Also, Andres had a unique testing environment and a set of coincidental setup issues which allowed him to discover the issue. I don’t know of anybody else has this setup.</p><p id="a458">When I installed a vulnerable Linux box, I had to double check it was actually vulnerable as I wouldn’t even see a speed issue. For me, it was a completely transparent backdoor — where sshd was running from disk as usual, with the usual file hash and no extra network activity.</p><p id="c395"><strong>How advanced was the threat actor? </strong>The backdoor attempt was a very serious one, with a very high bar of knowledge, research, development and tradecraft to reach this far into the Linux ecosystem. Additionally, changes made by the threat actor on Github span multiple years, and include things like introducing functions incompatible with OSS Fuzzer due to outstanding small issues since 2015, then getting OSS Fuzzer to exclude XZ Utils from scanning last year. The backdoor itself is super well put together, and even includes the ability to remotely deactivate and remove the backdoor via a kill command. Several days in, despite global focus, I haven’t seen anybody who has finished reverse engineering it.</p><p id="22fd"><strong>Who did it?</strong> Your mum. Just kidding, it was GCHQ in Cheltnam. Just kidding, it was Russia. Just kidding, it was China. Just kidding, it was America. Just kidding, it was definitely your mum.</p><p id="f5c3"><strong>We should stop using open source and only buy American vendor products! </strong>Yeah, good luck with that.</p><figure></figure><p id="3aea"><strong>We should start funding every open source project! </strong>Yeah, good luck with that.. I’ll start saving for my trip to Mars.</p><p id="a175"><strong>This is a wake up call around cybersecurity! </strong>People will have forgotten about it in a week. Except for LinkedIn, who will still be talking in an echo chamber about supply chain in four decades.</p><p id="2e14"><strong>So what can we do? </strong>First of all, if you rely on <em>any </em>software, you have a risk of insider threat. Be it open source, closed source, or your own in house developers — if people add backdoors and nobody notices, that’s a problem.</p><p id="6d06">Secondly, <strong><em>a core issue here is systemd in Linux</em></strong>. libsystemd is linked to all systemd servies, which opens a rich attack surface of third party services to backdoor. That is what the threat actor abused here. It mean they didn’t need to backdoor systemd, which has a rich development community paying attention — instead they relied on liblzma loading XZ, which is much further down the chain, where nobody was paying attention.</p><p id="71dd">There’s a plot twist. This issue request in systemd was opened today:</p><p id="1efe">But the fix for this was <em>already in train before the XZ issue was highlighted</em>, and long before the Github issue. The fix stopped the XZ backdoor into SSH, but hadn’t yet rolled out into a release of systemd.</p><p id="2482">I believe there’s a good chance the threat actor realised this, and began rapidly accelerated development and deployment, hence publicly filing bug reports to try to get Ubuntu and such to upgrade XZ, as it was about to spoil several years of work. It also appears this is when they started making mistakes.</p><p id="e9ae"><strong>We’re all doomed!!!1! The supply chain will end the world!11! I really want to panic!!! </strong>No. Panic helps nobody. It’s also important we keep things in perspective, e.g. this one was spotted and averted.</p><p id="b2b5">Let’s just keep doing the good SBOM work at CISA, and stop doing stunts around Huawei and such — Huawei is a speck of dust compared to the issues around tens of thousands of unpaid developers writing the core of the world’s most critical infrastructure nowadays.</p><p id="9ee5">Work around tightening systemd and other core Linux dependencies needs to continue. There’s probably more that needs to be done around EDR detection on Linux, e.g. injection into ssh that nobody detected? Detect it. In truth, Linux EDR products are significantly less robust than Windows EDR products. Ask me how I know.</p><p id="1afa">The reality is that all development has a risk of insider account abuse, and that includes open source.</p><figure></figure><p id="50eb">We should also acknowledge that open source developers are largely unpaid, and face significant amounts of online abuse from users of the software. This is not the first time an open source package has been hijacked after a maintainer was added – it actually happens all the time in Python repositories and such, and has been one of the leading causes of infostealers and coin miners in development pipelines. It is absolutely not a surprise that somebody is targeting open source compression libraries that systemd loads.. and it is also sadly not a surprise that people online bully the creators of these libraries, either.</p><p id="f608">There are no easy fixes.. we should just try to reduce the risk and calmly work some solutions.</p><p id="2267">Other reading:</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p>I did take some notes which I’ll present below, but this isn’t a full how-to. I used <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/iBook+G4+12-Inch+800+MHz-1.2+GHz+Hard+Drive+Replacement/166">iFixIt’s guide</a> plus occasional reference to the official Apple Service Source repair guide (those are not strictly public but can be had from your favorite abandonware site).</p>
<p>For this year’s <a href="https://marchintosh.com/">#MARCHintosh</a>, I decided to replace my iBook G4’s 30 GB spinning-rust hard drive with an SSD.</p>
<p><a href="https://marchintosh.com/"><img decoding="async" width="192" height="102" alt="The #Marchintosh logo, depicting a smiling compact Mac icon with a four-leaf clover and a stripe of six-color Apple rainbow." srcset="https://boredzo.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/MARCHintoshLogo@1x.png, https://boredzo.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/MARCHintoshLogo@2x.png 2x" src="https://boredzo.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/MARCHintoshLogo@1x.png"></a></p>
<p>This was my second SSD upgrade, as I’d previously <a href="https://boredzo.org/cubehd">replaced my G4 Cube’s hard drive with an SSD</a>. (The pictures on that page show a hard drive because, before the SSD upgrade, I’d replaced the Cube’s hard drive with <em>another hard drive</em>, and that was what I originally documented on that page. Then, after that, when I decided to upgrade to an SSD, I used my own tutorial. iFixIt didn’t exist yet.)</p>
<p>I rather despise working on laptops, though this wasn’t as bad as I’d worried it would be. (Upgrading the memory in my Mac mini was harder. I pointedly did that as soon as the machine arrived so that it would be done and I’d never need to open the machine back up for the rest of its life.)</p>
<p>The thing that motivated me to go forward with it was that the iBook was absolutely filthy. It had been Mom’s, and she was a smoker in her life; she would routinely be smoking a cigarette and working on the computer, and getting so absorbed in the latter that ash would fall from her cigarette onto and into the computer. So I resolved to clean the disassembled parts as well as upgrade the storage.</p>
<p>For the cleaning, I mostly used paper towels wetted with diluted all-purpose cleaner. A couple small spots of deposited nail polish were resolved with cotton pads soaked with nail polish remover. It worked fine, at least so far—if I’ve started some chemical process of plastic deterioration, I don’t know it yet.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="504" height="378" alt="The iBook in question, closed, and visibly dirty even on the outside." src="https://boredzo.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_7672@2x.jpg" srcset="https://boredzo.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_7672@1x.jpg, https://boredzo.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_7672@2x.jpg 2x"><br>
Before cleaning.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="504" height="378" alt="The iBook in question, closed, now thoroughly cleaned and spiffy." srcset="https://boredzo.org/blog/archives/2024-03-31/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_7760@1x.jpg, https://boredzo.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_7760@2x.jpg 2x" src="https://boredzo.org/blog/archives/2024-03-31/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_7760@1x.jpg"><br>
After cleaning.</p>
<p>Once I decided the project was go, I also added in a memory upgrade, because it was less than $20 and I was already buying stuff from OWC for the operation anyway. The machine had 512 MB of RAM; now it has 1 GB. (Plus the 128 MB on the logic board.)</p>
<p>One key difference from the Cube upgrade: The iBook, being a laptop, doesn’t have as much space for the upgraded drive. The Cube had some wiggle room taken up by brackets; the iBook has basically none. In the Cube, I installed a standard-size SATA SSD plus a SATA-to-PATA adapter; in the iBook, that wouldn’t have fit.</p>
<p>So my first thought was an M.2 SSD, that being the form factor that today’s computers generally use. I ran into a problem: There are like three different signaling protocols that all run over the M.2 form factor, and M.2 correspondingly has three different keying combinations to guard against protocol mismatches (an incompatible SSD won’t physically fit, though an SSD that fits isn’t necessarily compatible). I noped out of trying to sort that out.</p>
<p>What I went with instead was mSATA. This form factor is kind of dying off as M.2 takes over, but Kingston still sells mSATA SSDs directly from their own website, and I found a suitable adapter on Amazon. (I buy from alternatives like Micro Center or direct from manufacturers whenever possible, but it wasn’t in this case. The manufacturer’s website links to their Amazon store.)</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="606" height="340" alt="The two-and-a-half-inch spinning-rust hard drive, and the mSATA SSD in its IDE adapter, side by side in my hand." srcset="https://boredzo.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_7735@1x.jpg, https://boredzo.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_7735@2x.jpg 2x" src="https://boredzo.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_7735@1x.jpg"><br>
The old spinning-rust drive is 30 GB; the new SSD is 256 GB.</p>

<h3>What’d I put in there?</h3>
<p>Here’s the bill of materials I ended up with:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://shop.kingston.com/collections/solid-state-drives/products/kc600-ssd-1?variant=40836176576704">Kingston 256GB mSATA SSD</a> (you could go bigger, but I cheaped out)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ableconn-IIDE-MSAT-2-5-Inch-Converter-Aluminum/dp/B017VQT5YW/132-2787373-3000614">Ableconn mSATA to IDE adapter</a></li>
<li><a href="https://eshop.macsales.com/item/OWC/2700DDRS1GBA/">OWC 1 GB PC2700 RAM SO-DIMM</a> (the original Apple DIMM was PC2100, so this was a speed upgrade as well as a size upgrade)</li>
<li><a href="https://eshop.macsales.com/item/OWC/MS8U3SSD120/">OWC external FireWire SSD</a> to reinstall the OS from, since this machine can’t boot from USB and I don’t trust the internal optical drive to not eat the next disc I put in it</li>
</ul>
<p>… and as I write this up now, I notice that OWC has now discontinued that last product. Did I buy the last one or something?</p>
<p>(It feels like OWC is moving away from selling products for older Macs, having now discontinued their last FireWire product AFAIK, and I’m bummed. At a time when the retro Mac community is resurgent, we can use every source for quality gear for our old Macs that we can get.)</p>
<p>For tools, I mostly used <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/products/essential-electronics-toolkit">one of iFixIt’s toolkits</a>, plus <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/products/precision-screw-extractor-set">the screw extractor set they sell</a>. I also found <a href="https://www.artsupplywarehouse.com/products/daylight-halo-table-magnifying-lamp%7CDAYU25200.html">a lighted magnifier</a> extremely helpful.</p>
<p>I also used <a href="https://coriolis-systems.com/">iPartition</a> to set up the external SSD with the Tiger and Leopard boot DVDs and various other things (including a copy I’d already made of the HDD).</p>
<h3>Hiccups</h3>
<h4>Hiccup #1: The case of the borked screw</h4>
<p>One of the three M2 (i.e., 2mm, i.e., <em>really tiny</em>) screws on the right side of the keyboard tray was visibly rusted and seemingly damaged. Trying to unscrew it (including a couple of attempts with the wrong size driver) damaged it further.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="504" height="283" alt="The inside of the keyboard tray. There are two screws in the rear and forward corners, and a third in the center. The forward screw has some visible rust on its head." srcset="https://boredzo.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_7696@1x.jpg, https://boredzo.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_7696@2x.jpg 2x" src="https://boredzo.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_7696@1x.jpg"><br>
This was after I’d already worked over that third screw a bunch. It was even more rust-covered at first.
</p>
<p>I looked at a bunch of options and asked for ideas on Mastodon. A couple of people recommended precision screw extractors (much smaller and a different type than the kind you drill into a screw). I bought <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/products/precision-screw-extractor-set">the set that iFixIt sells</a>, which it turns out is <a href="https://www.centraltools.com/58-0675-4pc-screw-extractor-reversible-set.html">OEM’d by Moody Tools</a>.</p>
<p>The second extractor bit I tried, one of the smaller ones, worked perfectly, and drove the screw out as easily as the normal drivers did the undamaged screws. Thus I was unblocked and able to continue toward the hard drive.</p>
<p>I did encounter a second rusted screw near the latch mechanism. This I was able to clean with a few things, including a nylon-brush bit on a Dremel, without damaging the head. That screw came out and went back in with no further fuss.</p>
<h4>Hiccup #2: The case of the stuck installer</h4>
<p>After I got everything back together, the Tiger DVD wouldn’t boot. After either the verbose spew or the spinner, the OS switches to the normal GUI with a blue background, and should then show the Installer on that background—but it would get stuck at the blue background, with no window and no cursor.</p>
<p>On a whim, I tried Leopard (not a supported OS on this machine), and was pleasantly surprised to find that the iBook booted that DVD happily. Moreover, that it <em>worked</em>.</p>
<p>Leopard’s installer refused to install, of course, but it let me cancel and access the rest of the utilities—including Terminal, from which I was able to run <code>system_profiler</code>. Here, I figured, I could at least see whether any of my new hardware was showing up.</p>
<p>And the answer was <em>no</em>. Well, that was a let-down! The RAM slot read as empty (it definitely wasn’t), and querying the PATA bus <em>hung</em>.</p>
<p>I decided to try switching back to the original Apple DIMM, since it’s easier to get to the RAM than the hard drive. When I put the original DIMM back in, I noticed that it sat farther into the slot than the upgrade DIMM had been.</p>
<p>“HMMMMMM.”</p>
<p>So I popped it back out and re-upgraded the RAM. Sure enough, with a bit more attention to this detail, the new DIMM went into the slot exactly as far as the Apple DIMM had.</p>
<p>And when I booted the machine up again… everything worked. The new RAM showed up. PATA no longer hung.</p>
<p>“Hmm. PATA doesn’t hang anymore. Was that where Tiger was hanging?”</p>
<p>Yup! Or similar enough, anyway. It fixed the problem; Tiger’s installer was now unblocked.</p>
<h4>Hiccup #3: The case of the 512 MB partition map</h4>
<p>One of my goals for this machine is to try to cajole it into booting Mac OS 9 even though that isn’t supported, so I wanted to make sure to install the disk drivers that Mac OS 9 needs onto the SSD. This is an option in Disk Utility of that era… except it wasn’t showing up, presumably because this is a machine that (officially) can’t boot Mac OS 9 anyway, so why would it need that?</p>
<p>(The original hard drive had Mac OS 9 drivers installed. Maybe Panther was more permissive about that.)</p>
<p>Now, there is a second way to get Mac OS 9 drivers installed: <code>hdiutil create</code> has an option, <code>-layout 'UNIVERSAL HD'</code>, that sets up the image with a partition map containing a full set of Mac OS 9 drivers for every then-imaginable device interface, from SCSI to ATA to FireWire. (There is also <code>'UNIVERSAL CD'</code>, which gives a different set of drivers.)</p>
<p>So my plan was:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a RAM disk using <code>hdiutil create -nomount ram://262144</code> (that creates a 128 MB RAM disk), since I had nothing writable that I wasn’t about to obliterate (besides thumb drives), and I had plenty of RAM.</li>
<li>On the RAM disk, create a sparse disk image with the “UNIVERSAL HD” format and sized to the number of blocks <code>diskutil info</code> reported for the SSD.</li>
<li>Attach that disk image with <code>-nomount</code> so I can munge its contents directly.</li>
<li>Use <code>pdisk</code> to edit its partition map, specifically to create all the partitions I wanted.</li>
<li>Use <code>newfs_hfs</code> to format each of the partitions as HFS+J (or plain HFS+ in the case of the OS 9 partition).</li>
</ol>
<p>Problem: Whenever I attached the sparse disk image, pdisk showed that the partition map was set for a 512 MB storage device, not a 256 GB storage device. It doesn’t offer any way to change that, even in the advanced options.</p>
<p>Solution: This was apparently a Tiger bug, because when I rebooted back into the Leopard DVD, the same series of steps worked perfectly.</p>
<p>So I had to do my partitioning and formatting in Leopard, then reboot back to the Tiger DVD to install the OS.</p>
<h3>Results</h3>
<p>Well, the first sign of success was that the Tiger installation—from the FireWire SSD to the IDE SSD—only took 15 minutes. If you’ve ever installed old Mac OS X from a CD or DVD to a spinning-rust drive, you’ll remember it definitely takes longer than that.</p>
<p>My informal test of the HDD’s speed before the operation showed about 30 MB/sec write speed (<code>dd if=/dev/zero bs=10485760 of=test</code>, followed by math to convert its output to MB/sec because Tiger’s <code>dd</code> doesn’t have <code>status=progress</code>). After the upgrade, I found out about <a href="http://xbench.com/">Xbench</a>, and ran that, and it showed about 90 MB/sec write speed in most cases, which is basically saturating the UDMA100 interface. So, with the caveat that the methodologies of the two tests aren’t the same, I feel comfortable saying I tripled my throughput.</p>
<p>Tiger certainly feels way faster than ever before on this machine. The progress-bar portion of the boot process is now a tiny fraction of it, as the progress bar goes from 0 to 100% in about a second.</p>
<p>I’m very happy with the upgrade. I plan to see if I can convince the machine to boot from a Mac OS 9 partition (not a supported configuration—the machine came with a special version of Panther) or install Leopard (also not supported; this machine officially only supports Panther and Tiger plus Classic).</p>

</p>
<h4>Note #1: Drive bay shock bumpers</h4>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="504" height="283" alt="The IDE adapter (with mSATA SSD installed on the far side of it) sitting half-in the iBook's drive bay. Two black rubber washers are permanently affixed inside the drive bay, near the corners of the drive." srcset="https://boredzo.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_7737@1x.jpg, https://boredzo.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_7737@2x.jpg 2x" src="https://boredzo.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_7737@1x.jpg"><br>
Note the rubber bumpers inside the drive bay, inside the front of the machine. The heads of the screws on that side of the drive bracket (or the IDE adapter replacing it) rest <em>inside</em> these bumpers. There’s also a bracket with matching bumpers on the other side, which should be transferred from the old drive to the new one.</p>
<h4>Note #2: Reinstalling the feet</h4>
<p>The iBook’s feet have a design that ensures there’s only one way to reinstall them. You’ll need to pay attention to it when putting the feet back in, to ensure you don’t put them in crooked.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="504" height="283" alt="View through the lighted magnifier of one of the recesses where a foot is about to be reinstalled. There's a ridge on the inside of one quadrant of the recess." srcset="https://boredzo.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_7740@1x.jpg, https://boredzo.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_7740@2x.jpg 2x" src="https://boredzo.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_7740@1x.jpg"><br>
<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="504" height="283" alt="The metal ring that surrounds one foot, as seen from the underside that sits in the recess. There are three pillars from the outside-facing ring down to the bottom where the screw-hole is. One of those pillars has a lip carved out of it." srcset="https://boredzo.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_7742@1x.jpg, https://boredzo.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_7742@2x.jpg 2x" src="https://boredzo.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_7742@1x.jpg"><br>
The lip in this foot ring mates to the ridge in the recess. If the foot ring isn’t properly aligned, it won’t sit in the recess evenly. Don’t force it! Pull it out, look for the keying, and turn it so it’s correctly positioned.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="504" height="283" alt="Photo of the recess with the ring installed—so now we're viewing it from the exterior side rather than the interior side. Inside the ring is a well with three keys.

More keying. As before, pay attention and make sure you’re lined up, and back off and try again rather than trying to force it in.</p>

<p>
I just wrote 84 new matrix multiplication kernels for
<a href="https://github.com/mozilla-Ocho/llamafile">llamafile</a> which
enable it to read prompts / images faster. Compared to llama.cpp, prompt
eval time with llamafile should go anywhere between 30% and 500% faster
when using F16 and Q8_0 weights on CPU. The improvements are most
dramatic for ARMv8.2+ (e.g. RPI 5), Intel (e.g. Alderlake), and AVX512
(e.g. Zen 4) computers. My kernels go 2x faster than MKL for matrices
that fit in L2 cache, which makes them a work in progress, since the
speedup works best for prompts having fewer than 1,000 tokens.

</p><h3>Background</h3>

<p>
llamafile is a local LLM project I started with Mozilla back in Nov
2023. We're using
<a href="https://justine.lol/cosmo3/">Cosmopolitan Libc</a> to package
<a href="https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/">llama.cpp</a> as a
single-file cross-platform binary that runs on six OSes for AMD64 and
ARM64, while making gentle modifications. I believe that by improving
the core technology, we can give our users the best possible llama.cpp
experience, while helping both projects reach a broader audience.
Mozilla has been giving me the resources to do this.

<p>
When I first got into LLMs, my workstation was an austere Hewlett
Packard running Alpine with a spinning disk, slow RAM, an AVX2
processor, and no GPU. What I liked about llama.cpp is they were the
first LLM project that cared about people like me. So I started
volunteering full time and collaborated with guys like Slaren to
<a href="https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/pull/613">introduce
mmap()</a> support, which made weights load instantly using half as much
RAM. It was a leap forward for local LLMs at the time, but did little to
improve evaluation speed. Most of the inference code was written by
Georgi Gerganov himself, and it's so good that it'd take me another year
to finally improve upon. Now that I have, let's see how much faster
things go on my old Hewlett Packard.

<p>
Here we see that, on Skylake, llamafile users can expect to see a 2x
speedup and llama.cpp users can expect 50% better performance. Please
note this only applies to certain weights. So far, I've only written
optimized kernels for the q8_0, f16, q4_1, q4_0, and f32 data types. I
think both q8_0 and f16 are really solid choices. Possibly even f32 if
you've got plenty of RAM. That's because my new kernels change the
rules. They're doing such a good job fixing the memory bandwidth quants
always solved, that quantization could become the bigger bottleck. That
would be great news for the future of local language models, since it
means less need to trade away knowledge for speed.

You don't need a large computer to run a large language model. One of
the best personal computers available in stores today is the Raspberry Pi. They
deliver good performance at a great price and consume very little power.

Raspberry Pi released their fifth edition a few months ago and it's
outrageously fast compared to their previous model. They also introduced
support for the ARMv8.2 dotprod and fp16 arithmetic ISAs, which are very
useful for LLMs. Those two features alone enabled llama.cpp to achieve a
10x performance boost for f16 weights last year. This week I teased out
another 2x performance boost on top of that, by using a kernel that I
originally intended for AVX512. You wouldn't think a kernel designed for
beefy data center equipment would work out for a teensy tiny little
Raspberry Pi, but it actually fit hand in glove since both CPUs have 32
vector registers.

</p><p>
It's worthwhile to note that the new ARMv8.2 fp16 ISA may introduce more
errors than usual, since it causes llamafile to use fp16 words and we
aren't using techniques like <a href="https://justine.lol/matmul/kahan.gif">Kahan summation</a> for
computing dot products. So Q8_0 weights actually end up having slightly
better perplexity, because it uses the dotprod ISA which lets us updot
signed 8-bit integers into a 32-bit compute type which absorbs errors.
However this doesn't mean the faster fp16 weights can't be useful. Many
developers in this field view the differences as negligible.

</p><p>
For example, let's say you want to setup an email server on your pihole
and have TinyLLaMA filter spam. It's possible to
<a href="https://www.postfix.org/FILTER_README.html">configure Postfix

llamafile command.

There are several important things happening here:

</p><ul>

  <li>
    <code>--temp 0</code> turns off the random number generator (we
    don't want improvisation for a spam filter)

  </li><li>
    Here we see why prompt eval time is king. Token generation speed
    (eval time) doesn't matter for this use case, since we're using
    the <code>--grammar</code> flag to force the LLM to only print a
    single "yes\n" or "no\n" token.

  </li><li>
    I piped the original email through <code>links -codepage utf-8
    -force-html -width 400 -dump /dev/stdin</code> which reduced the
    number of tokens and removed hidden HTML content that was put there
    by the spammer to make the email look like ham to naive Bayesian
    filters.

  </li><li>
    The <code>-c 0</code> flag configures TinyLLaMA to use the maximum
    context size, which is 2048 tokens. That's the largest prompt we can
    give it. To help avoid feeding in too much text, you can pipe the
    email through <code>sed 's/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*/ /g' | dd bs=1
    count=7000</code> to remove superfluous spaces and place an upper
    limit on its size.

</li></ul>

<p>
Please note that spam filtering is just the tip of the iceberg. I've
always thought that "generative ai" is a misnomer, because language
models (more commonly known as "The Algorithm") have always been used by
tech companies in the past to extract knowledge, curate information, and
rank content. That requires reading rather than writing. AI has never
traditionally needed to talk that much, because the English language
just isn't that useful at the scale tech companies operate. Even if you
could generate English summaries for exabytes of text a millionth its
size, that would still be more words than any team could hope to read in
a lifetime.

Gamers have the highest quality expectations of any value consumer, so
any hardware built for them is usually pretty good. In the machine
learning industry, we have thrived for years repurposing hardware that
was intended for gamers. If it weren't for their important contribution,
the AI Winter may have needed to last another ten years. So a few months
ago, I asked a gamer to build me a computer that can replace my old
Hewlett Packard.

<p>
I think Alderlake is a great CPU but it's popularly misunderstood, as
evidenced by how easily I quintupled its float16 performance. Unlike
ARMv8.2, I was able to do that without introducing rounding errors,
since my x86 kernels use a float32 compute type internally. This means I
can have an even smarter spam filter. For example, when I run
my <code>spam.sh</code> shell script, it only takes 420 milliseconds,
which is 7x faster than my Raspberry Pi 5. That's right, when it comes
to small workloads, this chip is able to finish before CUDA even gets
started.

</p><p>
Alderlake owners can also look forward to the fact that llamafile takes
special care to not run on your efficiency cores. This is one of the
things that helps llamafile to go faster than llama.cpp. It also means
you can run LLMs around the clock and there's still plenty of resources
leftover for the other programs on your computer. The reason why that's
important is because llama.cpp dispatches threads in lockstep, which
would have meant that if any <code>1</code> core takes longer than the
others to do its job, then all other <code>n</code> cores would need to
busy loop until it completed.

</p><p>
However the greatest feature of this microprocessor is how quickly it
can build all 2.6 million lines of code in the Cosmopolitan monorepo. My
Hewlett Packard always took 64 seconds, but this gaming computer does it
in 20. It actually took 35 seconds originally; what made it faster is was applying
<a href="https://www.thermal-grizzly.com/en/conductonaut/s-tg-c-001-r">liquid
metal</a> and AI overclocking. Another reason systems code is so fast on
the Alderlake is there was a fire fight between the hackers and
scientists in the creation of this CPU, and the hackers won. I hope
they'll strike out a better compromise on AVX512 in the future, but
overall I'm very happy with this chip, since I believe it represents
significant progress over previous models.

If there's a personal computer with the most class, it would definitely
be the Mac Studio. Gaining the performance advantage here was harder for
me, because it's the hardware platform the llama.cpp developers care
about most, plus I'm working with a handicap due to my choice to use
Stallman's compiler instead of Apple's proprietary tools.

<p>
I wouldn't want to pick a fight with an Apple user, because their M2
microprocessor turns llamafile into a firehose of synthetic content. The
trick Apple used to do it is leveraging their vertical integration. If
you buy a Mac Studio and look inside, you'll discover that they put the
RAM DIMMs <em>inside</em> the CPU. It makes latency-bound operations
like token generation go much faster, because the CPU no longer needs to
make all these long distance phone calls. However, in terms of sheer
flops (as measured by prompt tok/sec), we can see that compared to my
much cheaper Intel computer, the M2 Ultra only exposes 30% more compute
via the ARM ISA. You need to go through their proprietary frameworks
like Metal and Accelerate if you want to access anything more. If you
have xcode installed, then llamafile by default will compile a small
stub module which does just that, since despite my values I'm happy to
help you get in front of any closed source library standing between you
and your silicon.

</p><p>
One important thing to know if you're considering buying a Mac Studio is
that, like the Windows Executive, XNU does a really good job keeping
your desktop stable, and that means protecting your system from you. It
takes me 45 seconds on Mac Studio to compile the Cosmo monorepo, due to
all these safety features; but if I fork bombed it, I'd be surprised if
Netflix skipped a single frame. My <code>spam.sh</code> script also goes
430ms, which is slower than Intel. However none of this concerns me,
since I've seen the way Asahi Linux is able to unleash the M2's full
potential.

While llamafile cares deeply about helping the GPU poor, it offers a
first-class experience to the 1% too. The AMD Ryzen Threadripper PRO
7995WX was just launched several months ago and it's the most expensive
CPU money can buy right now. It'll set you back $10,000 but you get 96
cores of AVX512, based on the Zen4 architecture.

<p>
Here we see that, despite only being twice the price, the 7995WX x86 ISA
offers 7x more raw compute power than the M2 Ultra ARM ISA, and nearly
the same token generation speed, which is likely thanks to its 384mb L3
cache. When I bought this chip, I had to expand support in llama.cpp for
bfloat16 and AVX512 before I could fully test its capabilities. My work
means you can now run LLaMA 2.8x faster on Zen4 than you could before.

</p><p>
One thing I like about AVX512 is that Google's Gemma model can
<a href="https://github.com/google/gemma.cpp/issues/23">solve math
riddles on AVX512 but not on AVX2</a> because the bigger vectors usually
make it easier to reduce rounding errors. Its <code>VDPBF16PS</code>
instruction helps us updot bf16 similar to VNNI and ARM dotprod. Having
native support for bf16 is nice, since models like Mistral and TinyLLaMA
distribute weights using bfloat16 as their canonical format. If we were
to convert bf16 to fp16, then only 13% of the numbers that are possible
can be accurately represented. In practice, it matters little, since
99.71% of the numbers Mistral 7b uses are among that 13%. However I
believe that llamafile should deliver, to the best of its ability,
whatever number of bits are being claimed. Especially when doing so also
enables us to better exploit the capabilities of our hardware. Adding
bf16 support is my first big step towards improving that.

</p><p>
Please be warned that a lot of people who bought this Threadripper ran
into issues with sketchy RAM. I had to RMA the first DIMMs I bought for
this computer, because most of them died and I was getting 5 eval tokens
per second with Mistral. I've been having better luck with a new full
kit of eight sticks that just arrived today. When I run <code>sysbench
memory run</code> it reports 10,033,424 mops, which is oddly faster than
my Mac Studio where 9,892,584 mops is reported, however my Intel
computer does 14,490,952. I expected my Threadripper's RAM to have that
speed since both set of components advertised 6400 MT/s with the same
timings, but I'm told that I traded this away to have 256GB of ECC. As
for disk speed, <code>dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/output bs=128k count=50k;
rm -f /tmp/output</code> reports 1.6 GB/s which is 3.6x slower than my
Mac Studio, and 3x slower than my Intel (which has the same M.2 stick).
I'm told that Intel and Apple are just better at this, but I wish I
understood why.

</p><p>
Last but not least, it runs my <code>spam.sh</code> script in 323ms and
builds the whole Cosmo monorepo in 13 seconds. It's actually capable of
building it faster, since this is the first time I've ever seen my build
config being constrained by an individual artifact blocking the critical
path. I never thought I'd live to see the day. I'm also puzzled that
llamafile v0.6.2 is somehow managing to do 93 tokens per second; that's
40% faster than my M2. It's exciting news, since after reviewing the
breadth of this blog post, I would have wept if there were no more
optimizations possible.

Both Mozilla and myself felt it would be worthwhile to contribute these

There are dozens of mathematical operations a transformer model needs to
perform in order to generate text, e.g. rope, transpose, reshape,
softmax, rms_norm, etc. All of the performance improvements I described
above, were achieved by focusing exclusively on a single one, which
is <code>GGML_OP_MUL_MAT</code>, because that's what my Linux Perf
profiler told me llamafile spends 95% of its time doing.

</p><p>
So what is this matrix multiplication thing? We shall start by defining
the most important algorithm in the world using the pythonic dialect of
Python that is most popular with developers today:

</p><pre><span>def</span> <span>matmul</span>(A, B):
  <span>assert</span> <span>len</span>(B) == <span>len</span>(A[0])
  <span>return</span> [[<span>sum</span>(A[i][l] * B[l][j]
               <span>for</span> l <span>in</span> <span>range</span>(<span>len</span>(B)))
           <span>for</span> j <span>in</span> <span>range</span>(<span>len</span>(B[0]))]
          <span>for</span> i <span>in</span> <span>range</span>(<span>len</span>(A))]
</pre>

<p>
As we can see, it's just three for loops and a multiply-add. How hard
could it be?

</p><p>
On my workstation (which I call meatball), the code above goes a
screeching 0.042 gigaflops. Most Python programmers are smart enough to
know that they should delegate tasks like these to a library
like <code>np.matmul</code>, which goes 29 gigaflops. NumPy achieves its
speed using FORTRAN which for generations has been favored
by <a href="https://justine.lol/dox/pascal.txt">real programmers</a>
who've led us to believe these libraries are something mysterious
chiseled in stone by the hand of Moses himself; but if we look at the
FORTRAN code NumPy actually uses, then it really isn't all that
complicated and could clearly benefit from some revision.

In order to do better than 47 gigaflops on CPU, most C++ developers are
smart enough to know they should use a BLAS library. Mightiest of the
open source BLAS is <a href="https://github.com/flame/blis/">BLIS</a>
which is funded by Microsoft, Intel, Texas Instruments, AMD, HPE,
Oracle, Huawei, Facebook, ARM, and the National Science Foundation.

</p><blockquote>
"Any time somebody outside Intel beats MKL by a nontrivial amount, I
report it to the MKL team. It is fantastic for any open-source project
to get within 10% of MKL... [T]his is why Intel funds BLIS development."

<p>
That's very impressive. Matrix multiplication is the practical
application of hardware that hardware makers care about optimizing most.
Since nobody knows more about Intel hardware than Intel, I imagine it's
not everday that somebody manages to challenge Intel for supremacy on
their own platform. Based on my own evaluation, what BLIS says is true.
However that is only true for single-threaded performance. Their
multithreading mode is still experimental, but if I use
a <code>./configure</code> flag to turn it on, then I'm able to boost
performance to 85 gigaflops.

</p><p>
llama.cpp had the important insight that less is more when it comes to
linear algebra. The alpha and beta parameters are never used, so they're
always set to to 1 and 0. The op graph for LLMs are designed in such a
way that the A matrix is almost always transposed and B is almost never
transposed, which means inner dimension dot product can vectorize over
contiguous memory. The m/k dimensions are usually evenly divisible by
64. While generating tokens, n=1 is usually the case, which makes matmul
a de facto matvec for the performance most people care about. BLAS
libraries usually hurt more than they help for matrix-vector
multiplication, because it's so computationally simple by comparison.
Sort of like the difference between downloading a movie and pinging a
server. Matrix vector multiplication is an operation where latency (not
throughput) is the bottleneck, and the bloat of fancy libraries has a
measurable impact. So llama.cpp does something like this, which goes 233
gigaflops.

            C[ldc * j + i] = d;
        }
}
</pre>

<p>
This gives us the best possible token generation speeds. However
llama.cpp's Achilles heel on CPU has always been prompt processing
speed, which goes much slower. That's because chewing through prompts
requires bona fide matrix-matrix multiplication. Being able to do this
fast is important if you care about text summarization and LLaVA image
processing. That's the reason why support for countless BLAS libraries
has been added to llama.cpp over the past year. The most formidable of
them is Intel's Math Kernel Library (MKL) which goes 384 gigaflops.

</p><p>
The difference between 233 versus 384 gigaflops may not seem like much,
at least not compared to Python, but it's a tremendous gulf. MKL is also
closed source and proprietary. We aren't even allowed to disassemble it
and try to reverse engineer how it works. Intel has been developing math
kernels for fifty years and they hold the secrets they've acquired very
close to their chest. But even if our desire for performance was so
great that we were willing to overlook the ethics of an open source
project spending the majority of its time inside a proprietary blob, the
simple fact of the matter is that integrating foreign BLAS libraries
into llama.cpp isn't that practical, due to the way its threading model
works. In order to improve prompt processing speed, we must figure out
the trick BLAS libraries use, and implement it in a scrappy
dependency-free way that stays true to llama.cpp's roots.

</p><p>
I believe the trick with CPU math kernels is exploiting instruction
level parallelism with fewer memory references. If you compile the
example above with <code>-O3 -ffast-math -march=native</code> then the
code your compiler generates should look like this:

</p><pre><span>void</span> <span>SLLMM</span>(<span>int</span> m, <span>int</span> n, <span>int</span> k,
           <span>const</span> <span>float</span> *A, <span>int</span> lda,
           <span>const</span> <span>float</span> *B, <span>int</span> ldb,
           <span>float</span> *C, <span>int</span> ldc) {
<span>#pragma omp parallel for collapse(2) if (m * n * k &gt; 300000)</span>
    <span>for</span> (<span>int</span> i = 0; i &lt; m; ++i)
        <span>for</span> (<span>int</span> j = 0; j &lt; n; ++j) {
            <span>__m256</span> c = _mm256_setzero_ps();
            <span>for</span> (<span>int</span> l = 0; l &lt; k; l += 8)
                c = _mm256_fmadd_ps(_mm256_loadu_ps(A + lda * i + l),
                                    _mm256_loadu_ps(B + ldb * j + l), c);
            C[ldc * j + i] = hsum(c);
        }
}

<p>
So what llama.cpp usually does when it wants to improve things, is it'll
unroll the innermost loop like this:

</p><pre><span>void</span> <span>SLLMM2</span>(<span>int</span> m, <span>int</span> n, <span>int</span> k,
           <span>const</span> <span>float</span> *A, <span>int</span> lda,

<span>#pragma omp parallel for collapse(2) if (m * n * k &gt; 300000)</span>
    <span>for</span> (<span>int</span> i = 0; i &lt; m; ++i)
        <span>for</span> (<span>int</span> j = 0; j &lt; n; ++j) {
            <span>__m256</span> c0 = _mm256_setzero_ps();
            <span>__m256</span> c1 = _mm256_setzero_ps();
            <span>for</span> (<span>int</span> l = 0; l &lt; k; l += 16) {
                c0 = _mm256_fmadd_ps(_mm256_loadu_ps(A + lda * i + l + 0),
                                     _mm256_loadu_ps(B + ldb * j + l + 0), c0);
                c1 = _mm256_fmadd_ps(_mm256_loadu_ps(A + lda * i + l + 8),
                                     _mm256_loadu_ps(B + ldb * j + l + 8), c1);
            }
            C[ldc * j + i] = hsum(c0) + hsum(c1);
        }
}
</pre>

<p>
That may slightly improve numerical stability, but it does very little
to enhance performance, since modern CPUs are perfectly capable of
speculatively executing future loop iterations on their own. What we
want to do instead is unroll the <em>outer</em> loop. The advantage of
doing this becomes clear if we consider how it enables us to share
the <code>a0</code> register load across multiple floating point
operations.

Vectorized outer product with OpenMP goes 810 gigaflops on my Alderlake
i9-14900K with 6400 MT/s RAM when multiplying a 513×512 with a 512×512
matrix. That is twenty eight years of progress per Moore's law compared
to Python. It's clearly optimal since my CPU is listed as only being
capable of going
<a href="https://nanoreview.net/en/cpu/intel-core-i9-14900k">780

hand, MKL processes this matrix size at 295 gigaflops on my machine.

<p>
But does the C function above generalize to all matrix sizes? Nope. If I
bump the complexity up from 512 to 1024, then I'm pretty much back at
square one, not doing much better than a naive kernel, and MKL wins once
more. I personally don't view this as too problematic, since llama.cpp
by default processes prompts in modestly sized batches, and a kernel
should only need to be good for its intended size. It's also only a
matter of time until I unriddle the tricks needed for optimal tiling and
cache locality that can make my kernels scale.

</p><h3 id="threads">
  <a href="#threads">How I Got Multiple Threads to Work</a>
</h3>

<p>
Now to incorporate this into llamafile, we can't use OpenMP for the same
reason we can't use BLAS libraries. The kernel must be harmonized with
the way llama.cpp works. Its threading model is very similar to GPUs.
Ops in the model graph are processed one by one. A thread is spawned for
each core. Threads are restrained by a spinlock barrier and then set
loose to compute different parts of an output matrix in parallel as soon
as the next op is ready for execution. The id of each thread is
called <code>ith</code> and the number of threads is
called <code>nth</code>. There are no futexes or semaphores, because
kernel scheduling would greatly reduce tokens/sec. If we were to have
the <code>ith=0</code> thread call a BLAS API that spawned threads of

can work within this model by defining a new kernel framework.

You need to run the following command on Linux in order to benchmark
llamafile reliably. It also helps a little bit with timings to run as
root, but that shouldn't be necessary.

</p><pre><span>echo</span> performance | sudo tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor
</pre>

<p>
On Apple Silicon, I needed to build llama.cpp using the following
command in order to get it to run in CPU mode.

</p><pre>make -j32 LLAMA_NO_ACCELERATE=1 LLAMA_NO_METAL=1
</pre>

<p>
Some of you might be surprised that I didn't write my kernels in
assembly like BLIS does, especially given my history of projects
like <a href="https://justine.lol/matmul/github.com/jart/blink">blink</a>, <a href="https://justine.lol/sectorlisp2/">SectorLISP</a>
and <a href="https://justine.lol/sectorlambda2/">SectorLAMBDA</a>. The truth is I've been
coding in assembly this whole time. I configured Emacs so I can push a
button, and the disassembly for the C++ code I'm working on will pop up
on the screen in a few milliseconds. I know anyone whose codebase has
slow build times doesn't possess this advantage, which has made me
famous. Once I figure out how to do that for .cu files, I'll be
unstoppable.

</p><h2 id="credits">

<p>
I learned how to write math kernels by renting
<a href="https://vast.ai/">Vast</a> VMs and watching
<a href="https://ahgamut.github.io/">Gautham Venkatasubramanian</a>
and
<a href="https://github.com/mrdomino">mrdomino</a> develop CUDA kernels
in a tmux session. They've been focusing on solving a much more
important challenge for llamafile, which is helping it not have a
mandatory dependency on the cuBLAS: the reigning supreme linear algebra
library of such speed, accuracy, and ferocity that it could only have
been written by the prince of darkness himself. You're encouraged to
follow our ongoing progress on GitHub.

Congratulations on reading this far. I'd like to extend an invitation
for you to join us on the
<a href="https://discord.gg/Va7WsS56x3">Mozilla AI Discord</a>, where
you can ask questions and hang out with me, folks from Mozilla, and
others in the llamafile community.

            <span>Abstract:</span>The evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and GPT-4 has sparked discussions on the advent of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). However, replicating such advancements in open-source models has been challenging. This paper introduces InternLM2, an open-source LLM that outperforms its predecessors in comprehensive evaluations across 6 dimensions and 30 benchmarks, long-context modeling, and open-ended subjective evaluations through innovative pre-training and optimization techniques. The pre-training process of InternLM2 is meticulously detailed, highlighting the preparation of diverse data types including text, code, and long-context data. InternLM2 efficiently captures long-term dependencies, initially trained on 4k tokens before advancing to 32k tokens in pre-training and fine-tuning stages, exhibiting remarkable performance on the 200k ``Needle-in-a-Haystack" test. InternLM2 is further aligned using Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and a novel Conditional Online Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (COOL RLHF) strategy that addresses conflicting human preferences and reward hacking. By releasing InternLM2 models in different training stages and model sizes, we provide the community with insights into the model's evolution.

In what is likely one of the largest breaches of trust in the free software ecosystem, this backdoor is likely to have been put in by Jia Tan, a long-time maintainer of xz. Throughout his tenure as a maintainer, Jia remained relatively mysterious — as is not uncommon in the community, little beyond his name (which is likely a lie) is known about him. Generally, anonymity in the free software sphere is a good thing: software is inherently based on accomplishment and merit, and there is no reason to know anything about a person’s identity. However, in this case, where someone built up the trust of a community for years and then abused it, it is interesting to see who they are. Luckily for us, Jia’s activity does provide some metadata which we can potentially use to learn more about him. So here’s an analysis on what we can learn from his work patterns and time zone.</p><p><span>What is to be learned from times? The conditions under which software is created! Think about the wide range of things that time patterns tell us about — there are people who are paid to do code and those who work on it as a hobby. Those in some areas code during different times as others. There are holidays, sleep schedules, and work-life balance— code is not exempt from these. Understanding when someone codes helps us understand </span><em>why</em><span> and </span><em>where</em><span> they are coding for. Figuring these out can give us a much better idea about why and who did this.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The following analysis was conducted on JiaT75’s (</span><a href="https://github.com/JiaT75?tab=overview&amp;from=2021-12-01&amp;to=2021-12-31" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">https://github.com/JiaT75?tab=overview&amp;from=2021-12-01&amp;to=2021-12-31</a><span>) commits to the XZ repository and their time stamps.</span></p><p>Let’s first address the elephant in the room: Yes, you can change Git timestamps to whatever you want. It doesn’t even take a degree in cybersec to do — setting the environment variables GIT_AUTHOR_DATE and GIT_COMMITTER_DATE as you commit is enough. If you forget and haven’t pushed yet, you can even change the date later as you amend the commit.</p><p>However, plausibly forging time data is actually hard: You shouldn’t push a commit that you made to look as though it was made in the future, and you also shouldn’t set a date that is so far in the past that the commit looks older than online discussions that it references. This means you will often not be able to change the time without adding latency, i.e., withholding commits and thus delaying project development -- and even then, getting it right every time is hard. After all, everyone who develops software knows how tempting it is to type the magic words “git commit” without having properly checked everything.</p><p>An easier way than actually changing the time would be to change only the time zone! Ideally, you would change it to something that still leads to somewhat plausible hours. For example, someone who works during regular European office hours but claims to be on the East Coast would likely raise some suspicion, as 11 am Central European Time is 5 AM Eastern, and who regularly works in the early morning? For a hacker, it is much more plausible to work in the afternoon and late at night, so someone who keeps regular office hours would want to change into a time zone about five hours ahead or so (so they start working at 2 pm (9 am real-time) and end at 10 pm (5 pm real time)).</p><p>I think that is what Jia Tan did. Based on his name, he wanted people to believe he is Asian — specifically Chinese— and the vast majority of his commits (440) appear to have a UTC+08 time stamp. The +0800 is likely CST, the time zone of China (or Indonesia or Philippines or Western Australia), given almost no one lives in Siberia and the Gobi desert.</p><p>However, I believe that he is actually from somewhere in the UTC+02 (winter)/UTC+03 (DST) timezone, which includes Eastern Europe (EET), but also Israel (IST), and some others. Forging time zones would be easy — no need to do any math or delay any commits. He likely just changed his system time to Chinese time every time he committed.</p><p>We see him usually working 9 am to 6 pm (adjusted to EET). This makes much more sense than someone working at midnight and 1 am on a Tuesday night (non-adjusted, using UTC+08).</p><p>Except sometimes, he forgot to change his time zone. There are 3 commits and 6 commits, respectively, with UTC+02 and UTC+03. The UTC+02 time zones match perfectly with the winter time (February and November), while the UTC+03 matches with summer (Jun, Jul, and early October). This matches perfectly with the daylight savings time switchover that happens in Eastern Europe; we see a switch to +0200 in the winter (past the last weekend of October) and +0300 in the summer (past the last Sunday in March). Incidentally, this seems to be the same time zone as Lasse Collin and Hans Jansen.</p><p>OK, you say. That is one theory, but maybe not a plausible one at this point. What if he just flew from wherever he lived in UTC+08 to EET sometimes? Well, it turns out that when we take a closer look, we see that this is not plausible. Let’s analyze the few times when Jia was recorded in a non-+0800 time zone. Here, we notice that there are some situations where Jia switches between +0800 and +0300/+0200 in a seemingly implausible time. Indicating that perhaps he is not actually in +0800 CST time, as his profile would like us to believe.&nbsp;</p><p>Notably, on 6 Oct 2022, we see two commits, one at 21:53:09 +0300 followed by another at 17:00:38 +0800. If we do the math, there is about an 11-hour difference between the two commits. However, a flight from China to anywhere in Eastern Europe or the Middle East takes at least 10-12 hours raw flight time, and likely much longer, considering non-stop flights between these locations are rare.</p><p>Even more damning, on Jun 27, 2023, we see the following: one commit at  23:38:32 +0800, another at 17:27:09 +0300. This is only a difference in a matter of minutes!</p><p><span>There is also one more vital clue to which country he worked in: Holidays. We notice that Jia’s work schedule and holidays seem to align much better with an Eastern European than a Chinese person. Disclaimer: I am not an expert in Chinese holidays, so this very well could be inaccurate. I am referencing this list of bank holidays: </span><a href="https://www.bankofchina.co.id/en-id/service/information/latest-news/2022/public-holidays-in-china-hk-and-the-us-in-2023.html" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">https://www.bankofchina.co.id/en-id/service/information/latest-news/2022/public-holidays-in-china-hk-and-the-us-in-2023.html</a></p><p>Chinese bank holidays (just looking at 2023):</p><p>- Working on 2023, 29 September: Mid Autumn Festival</p><p>- Working on 2023, 05 April: Tomb Sweeping Day</p><p>- Working on 2023, 26, 22, 23, 24, 26, 27 Jan: Lunar New Year</p><p>Eastern European holidays:</p><p>- Never working on Dec 25: Christmas (for many EET countries)</p><p>- Never working Dec 31 or Jan 1: New Years&nbsp;</p><p>To further investigate, we can try to see if he worked on weekends or weekdays: was this a hobbyist or was he paid to do this? The most common working days for Jia were Tue (86), Wed (85), Thu (89), and Fri (79).</p><p>Again, none of this is rock-solid evidence for anything — but we thought this was an interesting enough observation to post. Based on this, “Jia” most likely worked regular office hours and was based somewhere in UTC+02/03 (e.g. EET).</p><p>Update (Mar 31): Thank you all for your great feedback! We slightly updated the post: We switched around the times from the two commits where time zones change too quickly (our point stands; we just reversed the examples). We also clarified that UTC +02/03 includes a wider geographical range than just Eastern Europe.</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>
