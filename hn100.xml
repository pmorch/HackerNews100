<p>Factorio is a game where you crashed on a planet with your space-craft. You have to built a new rocket and leave this planet again. In order to do so you will need to mine metals and built yourself a factory, make labs to do research, and built machine that make other machines, and finally combine all of this to make rockets, satellites, rocket fuel, trains, flying robots, oil products, steam engines, plastics, electronic chips, iron, copper, uranium centrifuging, solar panels etc etc. An incredibly complicated game where the key idea is that you automate this entire process using machines in your factory.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVvXv1Z6EY8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVvXv1Z6EY8</a> .</p>
<p>To do research you need to manufacture research-packs which are created from other resources, which might also be created from other resources etc. etc. </p>
<p>Here is some code that interprets the Factorio wiki:</p>

<p>Let's ask the dependency tree for the first science pack:</p> 
<pre>out1 = FindDependencyTree["https://wiki.factorio.com/Science_pack_1"];
Graph[out1["Vertices"], VertexShape -&gt; out1["LabelRules"], 
 VertexSize -&gt; {"Scaled", 0.05}]
</pre>
<p><img src="https://community.wolfram.com//c/portal/getImageAttachment?filename=2381Factorio_1.png&amp;userId=73716" alt="enter image description here"></p>
<p>To make Science pack 1, we need gears and copper plates. And to make gears we need iron plates. The iron and copper plates are made from iron and copper ore. </p>
<p>This is still relatively simple, let's look at the other science packs:</p> 
<pre>out2 = FindDependencyTree[
   "https://wiki.factorio.com/Science_pack_2"];
Graph[out2["Vertices"], VertexShape -&gt; out2["LabelRules"], 
 VertexSize -&gt; {"Scaled", 0.05}]
out3 = FindDependencyTree[
   "https://wiki.factorio.com/Science_pack_3"];
Graph[out3["Vertices"], VertexShape -&gt; out3["LabelRules"], 
 VertexSize -&gt; {"Scaled", 0.05}]
out4 = FindDependencyTree[
   "https://wiki.factorio.com/Military_science_pack"];
Graph[out4["Vertices"], VertexShape -&gt; out4["LabelRules"], 
 VertexSize -&gt; {"Scaled", 0.05}]
out5 = FindDependencyTree[
   "https://wiki.factorio.com/Production_science_pack"];
Graph[out5["Vertices"], VertexShape -&gt; out5["LabelRules"], 
 VertexSize -&gt; {"Scaled", 0.05}]
out6 = FindDependencyTree[
   "https://wiki.factorio.com/High_tech_science_pack"];
Graph[out6["Vertices"], VertexShape -&gt; out6["LabelRules"], 
 VertexSize -&gt; {"Scaled", 0.05}]
</pre>
<p>Resulting in:</p>

<p>To summarize, let's combine all the graphs:</p> 
<pre>o = {out1, out2, out3, out4, out5, out6};
Graph[Union @@ o[[All, "Vertices"]], 
 VertexShape -&gt; Union @@ o[[All, "LabelRules"]], 
 VertexSize -&gt; {"Scaled", 0.02}, ImageSize -&gt; 1000, 
 AspectRatio -&gt; 1/GoldenRatio]
</pre>
<p><img src="https://community.wolfram.com//c/portal/getImageAttachment?filename=Factorio_All.png&amp;userId=73716" alt="enter image description here"></p>
<p>As you can see the dependencies are very complex to get all the research packs. Of course there are many things you need to create with your machines, think of transport belts, trains, mining, steam generation, and energy production, water and other chemicals etc etc. </p>
<p>One of the most expensive parts is a satellite (to guide your rocket):</p> 
<pre>out = FindDependencyTree["https://wiki.factorio.com/Satellite"];
Graph[out["Vertices"], VertexShape -&gt; out["LabelRules"], 
 VertexSize -&gt; {"Scaled", 0.05}]
</pre>

<p>I hope you like this little exploration on Graphs and Factorio. We could also use Mathematica's Graph technology to design balanced belt splitter designs: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/tz2Jc3p.png">http://i.imgur.com/tz2Jc3p.png</a> ! I will leave that for some other time. For now, explore the different buildings or parts, for example have a look at the rocket silo:</p> 
<pre>out = FindDependencyTree["https://wiki.factorio.com/Rocket_silo"];
Graph[out["Vertices"], VertexShape -&gt; out["LabelRules"], 
 VertexSize -&gt; {"Scaled", 0.05}]
</pre>
<p>If you haven't played already be careful it is an incredibly addicting game!</p>

I don’t just want to keep everything – I want to keep stuff that I’m actually going to look at again. As part of that process, I’m trying to be better about organising my files. Keeping something is pointless if I can’t find it later.</p> <p>Over the last year or so, I’ve been creating static websites to browse my local archives. I’ve done this for a variety of collections, including:</p> <ul> <li>paperwork I’ve scanned</li> <li>documents I’ve created</li> <li>screenshots I’ve taken</li> <li>web pages I’ve bookmarked</li> <li>video and audio files I’ve saved</li> </ul> <p>I create one website per collection, each with a different design, suited to the files it describes.

The HTML file uses the metadata to render the grid of images. </figcaption> </figure> <p>I’m deliberately going low-scale, low-tech. There’s no web server, no build system, no dependencies, and no JavaScript frameworks. I’m writing everything by hand, which is very manageable for small projects. Each website is a few hundred lines of code at most.</p> <p>Because this system has no moving parts, and it’s just files on a disk, I hope it will last a long time. I’ve already migrated a lot of my files to this approach, and I’m pleased with how it’s going. I get all the simplicity and portability of a file full of folders, with just a bit of extra functionality sprinkled on top.</p> <hr> <h2 id="how-did-i-get-to-static-websites">How did I get to static websites?</h2> <p>Before static websites, I tried other approaches for organising my files, but they never stuck.</p> <p><strong>I’ve made several attempts to use files and folders, the plain filesystem.</strong> Where I always struggled is that folders require you to use hierarchical organisation, and everything has to be stored in exactly one place. That works well for some data – all my code, for example – but I find it more difficult for media. I could never design a hierarchy that I was happy with. I’d stall on organising files because I was unsure of which folder to put them in, and I ended up with a disorganised mess of a desktop.</p> <p>I much prefer the flexibility of keyword tagging. Rather than put a file in a single category, I can apply multiple labels and use any of them to find the file later. The macOS Finder does support tagging, but I’ve always found its implementation to be a bit lacklustre, and I don’t want to use it for anything serious.</p> <p><strong>When I was younger, I tried “everything buckets” like <a href="https://www.devontechnologies.com/apps/devonthink">DEVONThink</a>, <a href="https://evernote.com/">Evernote</a>, and <a href="https://www.barebones.com/products/yojimbo/">Yojimbo</a>.</strong> I&nbsp;know lots of people like this sort of app, but I could never get into them. I always felt like I had to wrap my brain around the app’s way of thinking – changing myself to fit the app’s approach, not the other way round.</p> <p><strong>Once I had some programming experience, I tried writing my own tools to organise my files.</strong> I made at least a dozen attempts at this, the last of which was <a href="https://alexwlchan.net/2019/my-scanning-setup/#how-did-i-create-an-app-to-tag-my-pdfs">docstore</a>. Building my own tool meant I got something that was a closer match to my mental model, but now I was on the hook for maintenance. Every time I upgraded Python or updated macOS, something would break and I’d have to dive into the the code to fix it. These tools never required a lot of ongoing work, but it was enough to be annoying.</p> <p>Every time I gave up on an app, I had another go at using plain files and folders. They’re the default way to organise files on my Mac. They’re lightweight, portable, easy to back up, and I expect to be able to read them for many years to come. But the limited support for custom metadata and keyword tags was always a deal breaker.</p> <p><strong>At some point I realised I could solve these problems by turning folders into mini-websites.</strong> I could create an HTML file in the top-level folder, which could be an index – a list of all the files, displayed with all the custom metadata and tags I wanted.</p> <p>This allowed me to radically simplify the folder structure, and stop chasing the perfect hierarchy. In these mini-websites, I use very basic folders – files are either grouped by year or by first letter of their filename. I only look at the folders when I’m adding new files, and never for browsing. When I’m looking for files, I always use the website. The website can use keyword tags to let me find files in multiple ways, and abstract away the details of the underlying folders.</p> <p>HTML is low maintenance, it’s flexible, and it’s not going anywhere. It’s the foundation of the entire web, and pretty much every modern computer has a web browser that can render HTML pages. These files will be usable for a very long time – probably decades, if not more.</p> <p>(I still have the first website I made, for a school class in 2006. It renders flawlessly in a modern browser. I feel safe betting on HTML.)</p> <h2 id="emphasis-on-tiny">Emphasis on “tiny”</h2> <p>I’m doing a lot of this by hand – organising the files, writing the metadata, building the viewers. This doesn’t scale to a large collection. Even storing a few hundred items this way takes a non-trivial amount of time – but I actually like that.</p> <p>Introducing a bit of friction is helping me to decide what I really care about saving. What’s worth taking the time to organise properly, and what can’t I be bothered with? If I don’t want to take even a minute to save it, am I going to look at it again? But if I do save something, I’ve become more willing to take time to write proper metadata, in a way that will make it easier to find later.</p> <p>I used to have large, amorphous folders where I collected en masse. I had thousands of poorly organised files and I couldn’t find anything, so I never looked at what I’d saved. Now I have tiny websites with a few hundred items which are carefully selected and usefully described.</p> <p>Even though I usually love automation, I’m enjoying some of the constraints imposed by a more manual process.</p> <h2 id="prior-art">Prior art</h2> <p>Using a static website like this isn’t new – my inspiration was <a href="https://alexwlchan.net/images/2024/twitter_account_export.png">Twitter’s account export</a>, which gives you a mini-website you can browse locally. I’ve seen several other social media platforms that give you a website as a human-friendly way to browse your data.</p> <p>I think this could be a powerful idea for digital preservation, as a way to describe <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Born-digital">born-digital</a> archives. All the benefits of simplicity, longevity, and low maintenance are even more valuable in a memory institution where you want to preserve something for decades or centuries. (And HTML is so low-tech, you can create a basic HTML website on any computer with just the built-in notepad or text editor. No IT support required!)</p> <p>It’s been exciting to explore this idea at work, where we’re building larger static websites as part of our <a href="https://www.flickr.org/programs/content-mobility/data-lifeboat/">Data Lifeboat project</a>. This is a way to package up an archival sliver from Flickr. Where my local archives are typically just a list view, the website inside a Data Lifeboat has more pages and functionality. And while I was finishing this article, I saw a <a href="https://social.coop/@edsu/113306537369602233">post from Ed Summers</a> about creating static sites as a way to preserve Historypin.</p> <p>I’d love to this static websites get more use as a preservation tool.</p> <hr> <p>I already have a lot of files, which are sprawled across my disk. I’d love to consolidate them all in this new approach, but that would be a tremendous amount of work. My colleague Jessamyn wrote about this <a href="https://www.librarian.net/stax/5585/be-organized-from-the-very-beginning/">in a follow-up to my digital decluttering article</a>: <em>“no one is ever starting at the beginning, not in 2024”</em>.</p> <p>Rather than moving everything at once, I’m doing a little at a time. As I create new files, I’m saving them into static websites. As I look for older files, I’m pulling them out of their existing storage and moving them into the appropriate static site folder.</p> <p>I’m enjoying this approach, so I’m going to keep using it. What I particularly like is that the maintenance burden has been essentially zero – once I set up the initial site structure, I haven’t had to do anything to keep it working.</p> <p>If you’ve never written a website and it’s something you want to try, have a look at Blake Watson’s new book <a href="https://htmlforpeople.com/">HTML for People</a>. <em>“I feel strongly that anyone should be able to make a website with HTML if they want. This book will teach you how to do just that.”</em>. I love that philosophy. I’m only a third of the way through, but already I can tell this is a great resource.</p> <p>For a long time, I thought of HTML as a tool for publishing on the web, a way to create websites that other people can look at. But all these websites I’m creating are my local, personal archives – just for me. I’m surprised it took me this long to realise HTML isn’t just for sharing on the web.</p> </article> </div></div>]]></description>

		<p>WASHINGTON – Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) today joined Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) in introducing the Traveler Privacy Protection Act of 2023 to safeguard Americans from facial recognition screenings that the federal government is implementing at airports across the country. The bill would repeal the Transportation Security Administration’s (TSA) authorization to use facial recognition and prevent the agency from further exploiting the technology and storing traveler’s biodata.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>“Every day, TSA scans thousands of Americans’ faces without their permission and without making it clear that travelers can opt out of the invasive screening. The Traveler Privacy Protection Act would protect every American from Big Brother’s intrusion by ending the facial recognition program,”&nbsp;</b>said Kennedy.</p>
<p><b>“The TSA program is a precursor to a full-blown national surveillance state. Nothing could be more damaging to our national values of privacy and freedom. No government should be trusted with this power,”</b>&nbsp;said Merkley.</p>
<p>Despite the TSA calling its plan to implement facial scans at more than 430 U.S. airports voluntary, passengers are largely unaware of their ability to opt out. Moreover, TSA does not effectively display notices at its check points to inform travelers that they have such an option.</p>
<p>To rectify this, the Traveler Privacy Protection Act of 2023 would:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Require explicit congressional authorization in order for the TSA to use facial recognition technology in the future.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Immediately ban the TSA from expanding its pilot facial recognition program.</li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Require TSA to end its pilot facial recognition program and dispose of facial biometrics.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sens. Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.),&nbsp;Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) and&nbsp;Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) also cosponsored the legislation.</p>
<p>Text of the Traveler Privacy Protection Act of 2023 is available&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kennedy.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/e/f/efa63480-f3dc-4784-ba69-8eb939200840/18EA84B59548F1A7D02E38AFD33271C4.bur23a41.pdf" title="https://www.kennedy.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/e/f/efa63480-f3dc-4784-ba69-8eb939200840/18EA84B59548F1A7D02E38AFD33271C4.bur23a41.pdf">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/992055/">https://lwn.net/Articles/992055/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41875792">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>
Rust has a plethora of smart-pointer types, including reference-counted
pointers, which have special support in the compiler to make them
easier to use. The Rust-for-Linux project would like to reap those same benefits
for its smart pointers, which need to be written by hand to conform to
the
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/718628/">
Linux kernel
memory model</a>. Xiangfei Ding
presented at Kangrejos about the work to enable custom
smart pointers to function the same as built-in smart pointers.
</p>

<p>
Ding showed the specific "superpowers" that built-in smart pointers have in his
<a href="https://kangrejos.com/2024/SmartPointer%20and%20PinCoerceUnsized.pdf">
slides</a>:
unsizing and dynamic dispatch. Unsizing allows the programmer
to remove the length of an array behind a pointer from its type,
turning
a <tt>Ptr&lt;[T; N]&gt;</tt> (bounds-checked at compile time) into a
<tt>Ptr&lt;[T]&gt;</tt> (bounds-checked at run time). This needs special support because slices
(values of type <tt>[T]</tt>) do not have a known size at compile time; therefore the compiler
needs to store the size somewhere at run time. The compiler could store the size
in the pointed-to allocation, but that would require reallocating the array's
memory, which would be expensive. Instead, the compiler stores the size
alongside the pointer itself, as a fat pointer. On nightly Rust compilers, users
can enable an experimental feature and then have their
pointer type implement
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.CoerceUnsized.html"><tt>CoerceUnsized</tt></a>
to indicate that it supports that.
</p>

<p><a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/992336">
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2024/xiangfei-ding-small.png" alt="[Xiangfei Ding]" title="Xiangfei Ding">
</a></p><p>
The second superpower is called
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.DispatchFromDyn.html"><tt>DispatchFromDyn</tt></a>
and allows converting a <tt>Ptr&lt;T&gt;</tt> into a <tt>Ptr&lt;dyn
Trait&gt;</tt> when <tt>T</tt> implements <tt>Trait</tt>. This has to do with
the way that Rust implements dynamic dispatch — a value of type <tt>Ptr&lt;dyn
Trait&gt;</tt> uses a dispatch table to find the implementation of the method
being invoked at run time.
That method expects to receive a <tt>self</tt> pointer. So converting a smart
pointer to use dynamic dispatch only works when the smart pointer can be used as
a <tt>self</tt> pointer.
</p>

<p>
These features are both experimental, because the Rust project is still working
on their design. Ding explained that there is an
<a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/3621-derive-smart-pointer.html">
RFC</a> aimed at stabilizing just enough for the Linux kernel to use, without
impeding the development of the features. The RFC would add a new macro
that makes it trivial for
a smart pointer satisfying certain requirements to implement the
necessary traits, no matter what the final forms of the traits end up looking
like. That would let the kernel start using its custom smart pointers on stable
Rust sooner rather than later.
</p>

<p>
There is one catch — implementing these features for a smart-pointer type with a
malicious or broken
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.Deref.html">
<tt>Deref</tt></a> (the trait that lets a programmer dereference a value)
implementation could break the guarantees
Rust relies on to determine when objects can be moved in memory.
This is of particular importance to
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/pin/struct.Pin.html"><tt>Pin</tt></a>,
which is a wrapper type used to mark an allocation that cannot be moved.
It's not hard to write smart-pointer types that don't cause problems,
but in keeping with Rust's
commitment to ensuring safe code cannot cause memory-safety problems, the RFC
also requires programmers to use unsafe (specifically, implementing an
<tt>unsafe</tt>
<a href="https://users.rust-lang.org/t/understanding-the-marker-traits/75625/3">
marker trait</a>) as a promise that
they've read the relevant documentation and are not going to break <tt>Pin</tt>.
With that addition, the code for a smart-pointer type would look like this:
</p>

<pre>    // Use Ding's macro ...
    #[derive(SmartPointer)]
    // On a struct that is just a wrapper around a pointer
    #[repr(transparent)]
    struct MySmartPointer&lt;T: ?Sized&gt;(Box&lt;T&gt;);

    // Implement Deref, with whatever custom logic is needed
    impl&lt;T: ?Sized&gt; Deref for MySmartPointer&lt;T&gt; {
        type Target = T;
        fn deref(&amp;self) -&gt; &amp;T {
            ...
        }
    }

    // And then promise the compiler that the Deref implementation is okay to
    // use in conjunction with Pin:
    unsafe impl&lt;T: ?Sized&gt; PinCoerceUnsized for MySmartPointer&lt;T&gt; {}
</pre>

<p>
Andreas Hindborg asked for some clarification about why the marker trait is
needed. <tt>Deref</tt>
is supposed to be simple, Ding explained. Usually, someone writing a
smart-pointer type would have a normal pointer stored in their type; when implementing
<tt>Deref</tt>, they can just use the normal pointer. But it's technically
possible to implement something more complicated than that. In this case, you
could have a <tt>Deref</tt> implementation that actually moves data out of the
object pointed to and stores something else there. This would not normally be a problem,
except when the smart pointer is contained in a <tt>Pin</tt>, which is supposed
to prevent the value from being moved. If the <tt>Deref</tt> implementation
moves the value anyway, then that would be undefined behavior. The unsafe marker
trait is a promise to the compiler that the programmer has not done that.

<p>
The new macro is available on nightly Rust, although Ding says that it needs a
bit more testing in order to stabilize, as well as some additional documentation
which he is working on. Miguel Ojeda asked how soon the macro might be
stabilized; Ding answered that it should be quite soon. He will make a
stabilization report shortly, and then it is just a matter of checking off the
requirements.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
   <h2 data-level="1" id="ratio"><span>1. </span><span>Rationale</span><a href="#ratio"></a></h2>
   <p>C has the <code><c- n="">CHAR_BIT</c-></code> macro which contains the implementation-defined number of bits in a byte, without restrictions on the value of this number. C++ imports this macro as-is. Many other macros and character traits have values derived from <code><c- n="">CHAR_BIT</c-></code>. While this was historically relevant in computing’s early days, modern hardware has overwhelmingly converged on the assumption that a byte is 8 bits. This document proposes that C++ formally mandates that a byte is 8 bits.</p>
   <p>Mainstream compilers already support this reality:</p>
   <ul>
    <li data-md="">
     <p>GCC <a href="https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/blob/e7380688fa5917011c3fb85b5e06fb00f776a95d/gcc/genmodes.cc#L837">sets a default value of <code><c- mi="">8</c-></code></a> but <a href="https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Agcc-mirror%2Fgcc%20BITS_PER_UNIT%20path%3A%22gcc%2Fconfig%2F%22&amp;type=code">no upstream target changes the default</a>;</p>
    </li><li data-md="">
     <p><a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/7ec32094933bbf0201ea0670209c090a00bf8d83/clang/lib/Frontend/InitPreprocessor.cpp#L1103">LLVM sets <code><c- n="">__CHAR_BIT__</c-></code> to <code><c- mi="">8</c-></code></a>; and</p>
    </li><li data-md="">
     <p><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/data-type-constants">MSVC defines <code><c- n="">CHAR_BIT</c-></code> to <code><c- mi="">8</c-></code></a>.</p>
   </li></ul>
   <p>We can find vestigial support, for example GCC dropped <a href="https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/commit/a4a4b1d36476aaa60ebd05db0dfd16145dc72338#diff-d074f0fa705c64c47c773f7a884ecf60ee9699c1dbff6295c5ca535558b9a8b8">dsp16xx in 2004</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/commit/c7bdf0a6af41a480ecb6a103636ef9069721c0bd#diff-5386a7d0786c0a34dfad58442a8bfa9225ac1b3db899af287bf610d5be7360e9L94">1750a in 2002</a>. Search <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22define+BITS_PER_UNIT%22+-%22define+BITS_PER_UNIT+8%22">the web for more evidence</a> finds a few GCC out-of-tree ports which do not seem relevant to modern C++.</p>
   <p><a data-link-type="biblio" href="#biblio-posix" title="The Open Group Base Specifications Issue 8">[POSIX]</a> has mandated this reality since POSIX.1-2001 (or IEEE Std 1003.1-2001), saying:</p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>As a consequence of adding <code><c- b="">int8_t</c-></code>, the following are true:</p>
    <ul>
     <li data-md="">
      <p>A byte is exactly 8 bits.</p>
     </li><li data-md="">
      <p><code><c- n="">CHAR_BIT</c-></code> has the value 8, <code><c- n="">SCHAR_MAX</c-></code> has the value 127, <code><c- n="">SCHAR_MIN</c-></code> has the value -128, and <code><c- n="">UCHAR_MAX</c-></code> has the value 255.</p>
    </li></ul>
    <p>Since the POSIX.1 standard explicitly requires 8-bit char with two’s complement arithmetic, it is easier for application writers if the same two’s complement guarantees are extended to all of the other standard integer types. Furthermore, in programming environments with a 32-bit long, some POSIX.1 interfaces, such as <code><c- n="">mrand48</c-><c- p="">()</c-></code>, cannot be implemented if long does not use a two’s complement representation.</p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>To add onto the reality that POSIX chose in 2001, C++20 has only supported two’s complement storage since <a data-link-type="biblio" href="#biblio-p0907r4" title="Signed Integers are Two’s Complement">[P0907r4]</a>, and C23 has followed suit.</p>
   <p>The overwhelming support for 8-bit bytes in hardware and software platforms means that software written for non-8-bit byte is incompatible with software written for 8-bit bytes, and vice versa. C and C++ code targeting non-8-bit byte are incompatible dialects of C and C++.</p>
   <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX#POSIX-certified">Wikipedia quotes</a> the following operating systems as being currently POSIX compliant (and therefore supporting 8-bit bytes):</p>
   <ul>
    <li data-md="">
     <p>AIX</p>
    </li><li data-md="">
     <p>HP-UX</p>
    </li><li data-md="">

    </li><li data-md="">
     <p>VxWorks</p>
    </li><li data-md="">
     <p>vz/OS</p>
   </li></ul>
   <p>And many others as being formerly compliant, or mostly compliant.</p>
   <p>Even StackOverflow, the pre-AI repository of our best knowledge (after Wikipedia), <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2098149/what-platforms-have-something-other-than-8-bit-char">gushes with enthusiasm about non-8-bit byte architectures</a>, and asks <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6971886/exotic-architectures-the-standards-committees-care-about">which exotic architecture the committee cares about</a>.</p>
   <p>Why bother? A few reasons:</p>
   <ul>
    <li data-md="">
     <p>The complexity of supporting non-8-bit byte architectures sprinkles small but unnecessary burden in quite a few parts of language and library;</p>
    </li><li data-md="">
     <p>Compilers and toolchains are required to support edge cases that do not reflect modern usage;</p>
    </li><li data-md="">
     <p>New programmers are easily confused and find C++'s exotic tastes obtuse;</p>
    </li><li data-md="">
     <p>Some seasoned programmers joyfully spend time supporting non-existant platforms "for portability" if they are unwise;</p>
    </li><li data-md="">
     <p><a href="https://x.com/SebAaltonen/status/1843630586063413672">Our language looks silly</a>, solving problems that nobody has.</p>
   </li></ul>
   <p>One reason not to bother: there still are processors with non-8-bit bytes. The question facing us is: are they relevant to modern C++? If we keep supporting the current approach where Bytes"R"Us, will developers who use these processors use the new versions of C++?</p>
   <p>A cut-the-baby-in-half alternative is to mandate that <code><c- n="">CHAR_BIT</c-> <c- o="">%</c-> <c- mi="">8</c-> <c- o="">==</c-> <c- mi="">0</c-></code>. Is that even making anything better? Only if the Committee decides to keep supporting Digital Signal Processors (DSPs) and other processors where <code><c- n="">CHAR_BIT</c-></code> is not <code><c- mi="">8</c-></code> but is a multiple of <code><c- mi="">8</c-></code>.</p>
   <p>This paper cannot succeed without mentioning the PDP-10 (though noting that PDP-11 has 8-bit bytes), and the fact that some DSPs have 24-bit or 32-bit words treated as "bytes." These architectures made sense in their era, where word sizes varied and the notion of a byte wasn’t standardized. Today, nearly every general-purpose and embedded system adheres to the 8-bit byte model. The question isn’t whether there are still architectures where bytes aren’t 8-bits (there are!) but whether these care about modern C++... and whether modern C++ cares about them.</p>
   <h2 data-level="2" id="c"><span>2. </span><span>Impact on C</span><a href="#c"></a></h2>
   <p>This proposal explores whether C++ is relevant to architectures where bytes are not 8 bits, and whether these architectures are relevant to C++. The C committee might reach a different conclusion with respect to this language. Ideally, both committees would be aligned. This papers therefore defers to WG14 and the SG22 liaison group to inform WG21.</p>

<p><b>The Japanese <i>Fifth Generation Project</i> in computer technology was an 
attempt to leapfrog Western computer expertise and create an entirely new 
computer technology. Although the generation terminology is a bit murky, there 
was the general perception that there had been a a number of <i>generations</i> 
of computer design and the accompanying operating methods. 
</b></p><p><b>The first generation 
was the mainframe computers created by Sperry Rand and IBM during and after World 
War II. They were hard-wired to carry out the desired sequence of computations. 
John Von Neumann and Herman Goldstine showed how hard wiring could be replaced by an 
internally stored program. Machine language program was feasible but oh so 
tedious. Assembly language programming was a great advance in its day. Mnemonic 
commands could be <i>assembled</i> and <i>compiled</i> into the machine language 
coding required by the computers. But assembly language programming was still 
almost unbearably tedious so when John Bachus and his group created Fortran 
(short for Formula Translation) and John McCarthy created LISP (short for List 
Processing) it was a whole new day in computer technology, a new generation. 
Fortran became the language for routine number crunching and still is to some 
extent despite the development of other more sophisticated computer languages. 
McCarthy's LISP had an entirely different career. It was founded upon a bit of 
esoteric mathematics called the <a href="https://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/lambda.htm">Lambda Calculus</a>. LISP 
had a value at the fringes of computer technology, in particular for what became 
known as <i>Artificial Intelligence</i> or AI. AI researchers in the U.S. made 
<a href="https://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/lisp.htm">LISP</a> their standard. While was LISP was mathematically sophisticated it was 
almost terminally <i>klutzy</i> in its terminology. Standard operations 
such as finding the head of a list and the tail of a list were known as CAR and 
CDR, for cumulative additive register and cumulative decrement register. 
Outsiders could easily mistake the klutziness of LISP for primitiveness.
 In 
Europe a new computer language was developed called <a href="https://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/prolog.htm">PROLOG</a> (short for logic 
programming) that was slicker than LISP and had potential for AI.
 
</b></p><p><b>The Japanese Fifth Generation project was a collaborative effort of the 
Japanese computer industry coordinated by the Japanese Government that intended 
not only to update the hardware technology of computers but alleviate the 
problems of programming by creating AI operating systems that would ferret out 
what the user wanted and then do it. The Project chose to use PROLOG as the 
computer language for the AI programming instead of the LISP-based programming 
of the American AI researchers. 
</b></p><p><b>The <i>New York Times</i>' story on the demise of the Fifth Generation Project ran 
with a picture carrying the following caption: 
</b></p><blockquote><b>"Ten years ago we faced criticism of being too reckless," said 
Kazuhiro Fuchi, Fifth Generation's head. "Now we see criticism from inside and 
outside the country because we have failed to achieve such grand goals." 
</b></blockquote><b>
<p>The story itself was as follows: 
</p><p>Tokyo June 4.--A bold 10-year effort by Japan to seize the lead in computer 
technology is fizzling to a close having failed to meet many of its ambitious 
goals or to produce technology that Japan's computer industry wanted. After 
spending $400 million on its widely heralded Fifth Generation computer project, 
the Japanese Government said this week that it was willing to give away the 
software developed by the project to anyone who wanted it, even foreigners. 
</p><p>Machines That Would Think 
</p></b><p><b>That attitude is a sharp contrast to the project's inception, when it spread 
fear in the United States that the Japanese were going to leapfrog the American 
computer industry. In response, a group of American companies formed the 
Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation, a consortium in Austin, 
Texas, to cooperate on research. And the Defense Department, in part to meet the 
Japanese challenge, began a huge long-term program to develop intelligent 
systems, including tanks that could navigate on their own. Now, with a debate in 
the United States about whether the Government should help American companies 
compete, the Fifth Generation venture is a reminder that even Japan's highly 
regarded Ministry of International Trade and Industry can make mistakes in 
predicting what technologies will be important in the future. The problem for 
Japan is that the computer industry shifted so rapidly that the technological 
path the Fifth Generation took-- which seemed a wise choice in 1982-- turned out 
to be at odds with the computer industry's direction by 1992. In a sense, 
Japan's ability to stay the course in pursuit of a long-term payoff-- usually 
considered one of the country's strongest assets-- turned into a liability. A 
similar challenge for Japan may now be arising in high-definition television. 
Japan's HDTV system, which has been in development for two decades, is now 
coming to market just as some engineers believe that major shift to digital 
television technology will make the Japanese analog approach obsolete. Yet 
interest in joining government-industry projects continues in Japan. Another 
computer technology program, called the Real World Computing project, is getting 
underway. Executives here said that such programs could lead to valuable results 
even if no useful products emerge from the pipeline. A benefit of the Fifth 
Generation project, for instance, is that it trained hundreds , perhaps 
thousands, of engineers in advanced computer science. </b>

Most probably aren’t even on 16.4 or <em>16.anything </em>😱—they’re probably still using Postgres 15 or an even older version. 😭 With Postgres, it’s not like the latest Call of Duty, where everyone wants the update the moment it’s available.</p>



<p>Why don’t more people upgrade?</p>



<p>There are many reasons for this, but it comes down to two core issues: Postgres works and upgrades suck.</p>



<h2 id="the-foundational-greatness-of-postgres">The foundational greatness of Postgres</h2>



<p>We at Neon are embedded in the Postgres world. <a href="https://neon.tech/blog/top-3-features-in-postgres-17">Our team has worked on Postgres 17</a> and we’re all excited about all the new features and optimizations. But the entire point of Neon is acknowledging that most developers aren’t like us—they aren’t all about the database. For an average developer, the database is just a tool.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And Postgres has been a great tool since many versions before 17. For what most developers need, older versions of Postgres are more than capable. The core functionality of Postgres has been there for many years. This foundational strength is what allows developers to build robust, scalable applications without worrying about the underlying database version.</p>



<p><strong>This doesn’t mean that Postgres hasn’t improved. </strong>We’ll show you a tool later in this post that will allow you to see this much more clearly. </p>



<p>For example, let’s say you’re currently on version 12. Since then, Postgres performance alone has improved significantly: </p>



<ul>
<li><a href="http://v/">Postgres 13</a> improved performance for queries that use aggregates or partitioned tables</li>



<li><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/14.0/">Postgres 14</a> brought numerous performance improvements for parallel queries, heavily concurrent workloads, partitioned tables, logical replication, and vacuuming</li>



<li><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/15.0/">Postgres 15</a> offered performance enhancements, particularly for in-memory and on-disk sorting</li>



<li><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/16.0/">Postgres 16</a> improved the performance of vacuum freezing and logical replication from replicas</li>
</ul>



<p>These under-the-hood improvements are critical for building better applications. <a href="https://rmarcus.info/blog/2024/04/12/pg-over-time.html">Tail latency dropped by half</a> (over a second) between Postgres versions 8 and 16:</p>



<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXchs45eq_Qd7frywBYmtMrXuj5Hvdf2bWXyRCAclDPWvqlqsexeRdt0hIYG5T6EcQDg_AjN4xZ-sB8wfGDBiQvSw7y4_6DebxJzTmXfUgLXFvZ9fhMH_pa1eWUK4lE2pVHmHvU1Ro8658nT714M4bntkyN2?key=whimhCY7Z8YO4kaKWqIxOg" width="575" height="401"></p>



<p>This is without counting the security improvements, bug fixes, and of course new features. The new versions have brought support for the SQL <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/sql-merge.html">MERGE</a> command, SQL/JSON constructors and identity functions, parallelized vacuuming of indexes…&nbsp;</p>



<p>But now, to look at the other side of the coin: Unless you either a) are really reaching the limits of Postgres performance and are looking for any possible improvements or b) particularly need some newly added functionality, Postgres 12 probably works <em>fine</em> for you already.</p>







<p>So that’s the first reason many Postgres users hesitate to upgrade: Postgres is already great as it is. But we’d be fooling ourselves if we didn’t also acknowledge how painful it can be to update major versions of Postgres, especially for large production databases.</p>



<p>Minor updates are fine, and they’re completely covered for you by many managed Postgres services like Neon—<a href="https://neon.tech/docs/postgresql/postgres-version-policy">you don’t even have to think about them</a>. But updating a major version is a different game. Major versions of Postgres might introduce changes that aren’t backward compatible (something that doesn’t happen with minor versions) meaning that it’s much harder for Postgres companies to simply upgrade you automatically.</p>



<p>This doesn’t mean that it’s impossible to simplify this process. At Neon, we’ve put a lot of thought into <a href="https://neon.tech/docs/postgresql/postgres-upgrade">making it easier for you to upgrade</a>—for example, by supporting logical replication—and <strong>we’re working on a one-click Postgres upgrade feature so you can upgrade with minimal downtime. Not only that, but with Neon you’ll upgrade within a branch to ensure things work, and then upgrade your production with the least amount of interruption as possible. (Keep an eye on 2025 roadmap).</strong></p>







<p>To put things into perspective, let’s look at two public stories of companies that performed Postgres upgrades, jumping multiple major versions while managing databases of considerable size in production: <a href="https://knock.app/blog/zero-downtime-postgres-upgrades">Knock</a> (they upgraded from Postgres 11 to 15) and <a href="https://retool.com/blog/how-we-upgraded-postgresql-database">Retool</a> (from Postgres 9 to 13). These are big leaps that need to be made strategically.</p>



<p>Here’s what these companies had to do:</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Assessment and planning.</strong> They evaluated their database sizes and workloads (Retool had a 4 TB database; Knock managed multiple databases). Objectives like minimizing downtime and upgrading before end-of-life were set. They chose their target Postgres versions and crafted detailed project timelines and risk assessments.</li>



<li><strong>Set up replication.</strong> New database instances running the target Postgres versions were spun up and logical replication from the old to the new databases was established. Retool used <a href="https://www.citusdata.com/blog/2017/12/08/citus-warp-pain-free-migrations/">Warp</a> for parallel processing to expedite the initial dump and restore, while Knock created custom publications and subscriptions for incremental migration.</li>



<li><strong>Migrate data incrementally.</strong> Tables were categorized based on size and update frequency. Small tables were added to replication and synchronized quickly. For large, append-only tables, they used separate publications with copy_data = false and then backfilled. Custom migration strategies were considered for large, frequently updated tables.</li>



<li><strong>Testing and verification.</strong> Thorough testing was performed on the new database versions. They compared row counts and sample data between old and new databases, ran load tests to verify performance, and conducted multiple dry runs in staging environments.</li>



<li><strong>Application changes.</strong> After testing, they modified their applications to support connections to both old and new databases. Mechanisms were implemented to switch traffic from the old to the new databases, such as using feature flags.</li>



<li><strong>cutover strategy.</strong> The cutover was scheduled during low-traffic periods. Retool used a maintenance window aiming for about one hour, while Knock achieved near-zero downtime with a brief pause in new queries.</li>



<li><strong>Post-migration tasks.</strong> Afterward, they verified data integrity and application functionality, optimized the new databases (e.g., reindexing, vacuuming), monitored performance in the following days, removed old replication setups, and decommissioned the old databases.</li>
</ol>



<p>Yep. That’s a lot of work. There’s no way around that. Upgrading a production Postgres database that’s multiple versions behind requires a significant investment of time and resources. For many organizations, this level of effort can be daunting, so they often postpone upgrades until absolutely necessary.</p>







<p>Despite all this, we still want to encourage you to <em>upgrade, upgrade, upgrade</em>!&nbsp;Don’t worry too much, <strong>we’ll make this process so much easier! </strong>(Remember the 2025 roadmap!)</p>



<p><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/postgresql-17-released-2936/">If the great new functionality in Postgres 17 isn’t enough to convince you</a>, here are some other reasons:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>You’ll eventually have to do it anyway. </strong>Postgres versions have a lifecycle, and support for each version eventually ends (5 years after its initial release).&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>It’s more difficult to jump many versions at once. </strong>The longer you wait to upgrade, the more versions you’ll have to leap over when you finally do. It’s best to jump as many versions as you can when you do upgrade but if you wait for 5 or more versions there will be many compatibility issues and breaking changes ahead.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Your app might fall behind. </strong>Newer versions of Postgres come with performance optimizations and new functionalities that can enhance your applications. By sticking with an older version, you might be missing out on improvements that could make your system faster and more efficient.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Compatibility. </strong>New frameworks, libraries, and tools might come out without compatibility for the older version of Postgres you might be working with. Updated APIs or extensions might not be backward compatible, preventing you from integrating certain tools or requiring complex workarounds.</li>
</ul>







<p>Part of the lack of inspiration around upgrading comes from the hassle of manually comparing release notes between versions and figuring out how many improvements you’re missing. To make this easier, we’ve built a tool: <a href="https://pgversions.com/">https://pgversions.com/</a></p>



<figure><video autoplay="" controls="" loop="" src="https://neondatabase.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/pgversions.mov"></video></figure>



<p>This tool helps you quickly identify the improvements you’re missing by running an older Postgres version. For example, if you’re running Postgres 16.1, a quick search using pgversions.com tells you that you’re missing:</p>



<ul>
<li>4 security improvements</li>



<li>177 bug fixes</li>



<li>24 performance improvements</li>



<li>10 new features</li>
</ul>



<p>If <a href="https://pgversions.com/">pgversions</a> inspires you to finally upgrade, the <code>How to upgrade</code> section in the report will point you toward the right docs for different providers.</p>







<p>If you’re running an older version of Postgres and thinking there’s plenty more time. We know it’s tempting to procrastinate, but don’t let technical debt haunt you. <a href="https://neon.tech/docs/postgresql/postgres-upgrade">Follow this guide to plan to upgrade your Neon database to Postgres 17</a> and just cross it off your to-do list.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Are you running an older version of Postgres where they don’t offer the latest versions? A migration to Neon could mean upgrading and <a href="https://neon.tech/blog/how-dispatch-speeds-up-development-with-neon-while-keeping-workloads-on-aurora">switching to a better development environment</a>.

<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">The recent breakthrough successes in machine learning are mainly attributed to scale: namely large-scale attention-based architectures and datasets of unprecedented scale.
This paper investigates the impact of training at scale for chess.
Unlike traditional chess engines that rely on complex heuristics, explicit search, or a combination of both, we train a 270M parameter transformer model with supervised learning on a dataset of 10 million chess games.
We annotate each board in the dataset with action-values provided by the powerful Stockfish 16 engine, leading to roughly 15 billion data points.
Our largest model reaches a Lichess blitz Elo of 2895 against humans, and successfully solves a series of challenging chess puzzles, without any domain-specific tweaks or explicit search algorithms.
We also show that our model outperforms AlphaZero's policy and value networks (without MCTS) and GPT-3.5-turbo-instruct.
A systematic investigation of model and dataset size shows that strong chess performance only arises at sufficient scale.
To validate our results, we perform an extensive series of ablations of design choices and hyperparameters.</p>

        <section>
            <p>I realize that many people may not know or care who or what Matt Mullenweg and WordPress are, or why some people <a href="https://mathewingram.com/2ge?ref=torment-nexus.mathewingram.com" rel="noreferrer">are upset about them</a>, but after giving it a lot of thought (okay, about 10 minutes of thought) I decided to write about it anyway. I'm writing this newsletter in part for an audience — in other words, you the reader, and others like you — so when I'm deciding what to write about, I do try to take into account what you might be interested in reading about. But I'm also writing this newsletter for myself, and in this case what I care about trumps (sorry) what my readers may or may not be interested in. And I think this is about something important that goes beyond just WordPress.</p><p><em><strong>Update</strong>: After publication, Matt sent me a message on Twitter with a link to </em><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1chvLtOjUrXOmeqcfVO_voDKq5GnWvIYpfOl_oxCsdlQ/?ref=torment-nexus.mathewingram.com" rel="noreferrer"><em>a Google doc</em></a><em> that lists some corrections and clarifications related to some of my comments here. My response is at the end of this post.</em></p><p>I care about Matt Mullenweg and WordPress for a number of reasons, some personal and some professional. On the personal side, I've been using WordPress to publish <a href="https://mathewingram.com/2gf?ref=torment-nexus.mathewingram.com" rel="noreferrer">my blog</a> for more than two decades now, and I've helped countless others with their WordPress-powered blogs and websites over the years. It has its quirks, but it is a great system. I've tried Drupal and Squarespace and literally everything else, and I keep coming back to WordPress. On the non-personal side, the Columbia Journalism Review — where I was the chief digital writer for about seven years, <a href="https://mathewingram.com/2gg?ref=torment-nexus.mathewingram.com" rel="noreferrer">until a month or so ago</a> — runs on WordPress, as do hundreds of thousands if not millions of other websites (WordPress likes to boast that it powers more than 40 percent of the sites on the web.)</p><p>Not long after I started using WordPress for my blog, which was in 2004 or so — after experimenting with Typepad and Blogger and other publishing systems — I cofounded a Web 2.0 conference in Toronto <a href="https://mathewingram.com/2gh?ref=torment-nexus.mathewingram.com" rel="noreferrer">called Mesh</a>, and one of the speakers we invited to the very first one was Matt Mullenweg, the creator of WordPress, who was then just 21 years old. I have a very clear memory of Matt sitting at a table with my friend Om Malik (whose Gigaom blog network I would later join) and others, while I tried to get a friend to stop using a local company's terrible blog-publishing software and switch to WordPress.</p><p>I had a huge amount of respect for Mullenweg then, and I still do now. He not only created a great publishing system but then gave it away as open-source software, although he also set up a for-profit company called Automattic that sold a commercial version of the software and blog-hosting services through <a href="https://mathewingram.com/2gi?ref=torment-nexus.mathewingram.com" rel="noreferrer">wordpress.com</a> (the nonprofit arm was housed at <a href="https://mathewingram.com/2gj?ref=torment-nexus.mathewingram.com" rel="noreferrer">wordpress.org</a>.) Despite that respect, or perhaps because of it, I am surprised — and more than a little disturbed — by what has been going on over the past few weeks. I have seen a side of Matt I was unaware of, and it's not pretty.</p><figure><img src="https://torment-nexus.mathewingram.com/content/images/2024/10/image-1.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1920" height="1271" srcset="https://torment-nexus.mathewingram.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/10/image-1.png 600w, https://torment-nexus.mathewingram.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/10/image-1.png 1000w, https://torment-nexus.mathewingram.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/10/image-1.png 1600w, https://torment-nexus.mathewingram.com/content/images/2024/10/image-1.png 1920w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h2 id="pay-up-or-else">Pay up or else</h2><p>For many, the first rumblings of any discord in the WordPress ecosystem started with a speech Mullenweg <a href="https://mathewingram.com/2gk?ref=torment-nexus.mathewingram.com" rel="noreferrer">gave at WordCamp</a>, the annual get-together of WordPress users, on September 20th. After talking about the vision behind and benefits of open-source software, Mullenweg started talking about those who don't give back to the community and just take advantage of the open source ecosystem and how WordPress users should "vote with your dollars." It seemed — not just to me, but to others who were in attendance — a little out of step with the rest of his uplifting comments.</p><p>The same day, Mullenweg had expanded on those thoughts in a blog post on the wordpress.org website, in which he named WP Engine — a large commercial website-hosting company — <a href="https://mathewingram.com/2gl?ref=torment-nexus.mathewingram.com" rel="noreferrer">as the target of his ire</a> and called them a "cancer to WordPress." WP Engine, he said, had not contributed much to the open-source community, and had also been misusing the WordPress and related trademarks for years by not licensing them. After his remarks, WP Engine sent a <a href="https://mathewingram.com/2gn?ref=torment-nexus.mathewingram.com" rel="noreferrer">cease-and-desist</a> letter to Automattic and Mullenweg, who <a href="https://mathewingram.com/2gm?ref=torment-nexus.mathewingram.com" rel="noreferrer">sent</a> <a href="https://wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Cease-and-Desist-Letter-to-Automattic-and-Request-to-Preserve-Documents-Sent.pdf?ref=torment-nexus.mathewingram.com" rel="noreferrer">one</a> back — and then WordPress <a href="https://mathewingram.com/2go?ref=torment-nexus.mathewingram.com" rel="noreferrer">shut off</a> WP Engine's ability to access the open-source project's database, meaning anyone using WP Engine would be unable to update plugins. </p><p>So far, this sounds like a classic commercial dispute, with a big company — WP Engine is controlled by Silver Lake, a private equity fund with $100 billion in assets — taking advantage of a small nonprofit, and Mullenweg playing the role of the plucky little founder protecting his baby from being taken advantage of. But the reality is somewhat different. For one thing, WP Engine competes with WordPress.com, which is owned by Automattic — <a href="https://mathewingram.com/2gp?ref=torment-nexus.mathewingram.com" rel="noreferrer">a $7.5-billion company</a> that has given Matt <a href="https://mathewingram.com/2gq?ref=torment-nexus.mathewingram.com" rel="noreferrer">a net worth of</a> about $400 million. Also, the marks that WP Engine was accused of misusing are held by the nonprofit, but Automattic has an exclusive license to use them, which seemed to come as a surprise to many.</p><p><strong>Update</strong>: I think it's important to note that WP Engine has been using WordPress trademarks for over a decade now, and neither Matt nor Automattic nor the nonprofit ever mentioned that they were infringing on them until two weeks ago, at least not publicly. Automattic also invested in WP Engine at one point <a href="https://mathewingram.com/2hw?ref=torment-nexus.mathewingram.com" rel="noreferrer">not that long ago</a>, and Matt <a href="https://mathewingram.com/2hv?ref=torment-nexus.mathewingram.com" rel="noreferrer">spoke at a conference</a> that WP Engine put on last year, and talked about how WP Engine was the kind of corporate partner that others should emulate. So what changed? Is it just that Automattic is not producing enough revenue to <a href="https://mathewingram.com/2hu?ref=torment-nexus.mathewingram.com" rel="noreferrer">pacify its private equity</a> shareholders, who have funded the company through a number of financing rounds?</p><p>It gets worse, from my perspective at least. Wordpress.org, which is the online home of the nonprofit open-source part of the ecosystem, and through which all the licensing and other activities flow, is owned and controlled by Mullenweg — not through Automattic, but by him personally. "Wordpress.org belongs to me," as he <a href="https://mathewingram.com/2gr?ref=torment-nexus.mathewingram.com" rel="noreferrer">put it in an interview</a>. That probably made sense when Matt first created them as a 19-year-old software developer, but now it looks like the CEO of a multibilion-dollar corporation is using his control of a theoretically open-source foundation to extort money from a competitor.</p><p>Is extort too strong a word? Perhaps. But in <a href="https://mathewingram.com/2gs?ref=torment-nexus.mathewingram.com" rel="noreferrer">the lawsuit</a> that WP Engine has filed against Automattic and Mullenweg there are copies of text messages that Matt sent to the CEO of WP Engine just before his speech at WordCamp, offering to alter his talk to something more innocuous if WP Engine paid Automattic 8 percent of its revenues annually, which would <a href="https://mathewingram.com/2gt?ref=torment-nexus.mathewingram.com" rel="noreferrer">amount to about</a> $32 million (Automattic has published a memorandum of understanding that said <a href="https://mathewingram.com/2gu?ref=torment-nexus.mathewingram.com" rel="noreferrer">paying 8 percent</a> of its revenues to hire staff to work on WordPress would also be acceptable, although Mullenweg says that deal is now <a href="https://mathewingram.com/2gv?ref=torment-nexus.mathewingram.com" rel="noreferrer">off the table</a>.)</p><figure><img src="https://torment-nexus.mathewingram.com/content/images/2024/10/image-2.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="1067" srcset="https://torment-nexus.mathewingram.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/10/image-2.png 600w, https://torment-nexus.mathewingram.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/10/image-2.png 1000w, https://torment-nexus.mathewingram.com/content/images/2024/10/image-2.png 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h2 id="a-godawful-mess">A godawful mess</h2><p>There are other somewhat incriminating-sounding messages in the WP Engine <a href="https://mathewingram.com/2gs?ref=torment-nexus.mathewingram.com" rel="noreferrer">statement of claim</a>: in one, Mullenweg threatens to tell the media that the CEO of WP Engine talked to Matt about quitting WP Engine to join Automattic (something WP Engine lawsuit says is untrue.) Mullenweg has also posted about the situation on <a href="https://mathewingram.com/2gw?ref=torment-nexus.mathewingram.com" rel="noreferrer">a public Hacker News forum</a>, which seems, er.... unwise at best (at one point, a poster who says he is a lawyer actually advises Mullenweg to <a href="https://mathewingram.com/2gx?ref=torment-nexus.mathewingram.com" rel="noreferrer">stop talking</a> so he doesn't further incriminate himself, but he continues.) And a former Automattic staffer who was critical of Mullenweg's actions in a Medium post says that the Automattic CEO threatened <a href="https://mathewingram.com/2gy?ref=torment-nexus.mathewingram.com" rel="noreferrer">her with legal action</a>.</p><p><strong>Update</strong>: There have been more developments since I wrote this that raise questions about Matt's motivation. Among them are the fact that WordPress (i.e. Matt) <a href="https://mathewingram.com/2hx?ref=torment-nexus.mathewingram.com" rel="noreferrer">seized control of</a> a popular plugin developed and maintained on behalf of WP Engine, which even some diehard WordPress supporters found difficult to justify. WordPress said it was a security vulnerability that hadn't been patched, and that the software's terms of use allows it to take over plugins that aren't being maintained, but others pointed out that the <a href="https://github.com/wordpress/wporg-plugin-guidelines/blob/trunk/guideline-18.md?ref=torment-nexus.mathewingram.com" rel="noreferrer">spirit of the terms</a> suggests that WordPress is only supposed to do this in extreme situations.</p><p>Matt also wrote an incredibly mean-spirited post after David Heinemeir Hansson of 37signals <a href="https://mathewingram.com/2hy?ref=torment-nexus.mathewingram.com" rel="noreferrer">criticized his actions</a> related to WP Engine, saying Matt was "doing open source dirty." In Matt's original post, he made fun of how little money Hansson and his partners have made from their software (and also slipped in a piece of misdirection by saying that the WordPress foundation controls the trademarks, which is technically true, but as I described above, Matt controls the commercial use of those marks.) Matt later took down his post — which you can <a href="https://mathewingram.com/2hz?ref=torment-nexus.mathewingram.com" rel="noreferrer">still see via</a> archive.is — and said he got carried away because "vicious, personal, hateful words poisoned my brain."</p><p>It's pretty clear that Matt sees what he is doing as protecting WordPress, and forcing a no-good corporation to cough up some dough after years of taking advantage of the community (he <a href="https://mathewingram.com/2gz?ref=torment-nexus.mathewingram.com" rel="noreferrer">says he has been</a> trying to negotiate with WP Engine for more than a year now, while WP Engine says it <a href="https://mathewingram.com/2h0?ref=torment-nexus.mathewingram.com" rel="noreferrer">gives back</a> to WordPress in a number of ways.) To some observers like me, however — and to <a href="https://mathewingram.com/2h1?ref=torment-nexus.mathewingram.com" rel="noreferrer">some</a> <a href="https://mathewingram.com/2h2?ref=torment-nexus.mathewingram.com" rel="noreferrer">other</a> <a href="https://mathewingram.com/2h3?ref=torment-nexus.mathewingram.com" rel="noreferrer">longtime</a> <a href="https://mathewingram.com/2h4?ref=torment-nexus.mathewingram.com" rel="noreferrer">members</a> of the <a href="https://mathewingram.com/2h5?ref=torment-nexus.mathewingram.com" rel="noreferrer">WordPress</a> <a href="https://mathewingram.com/2h6?ref=torment-nexus.mathewingram.com" rel="noreferrer">ecosystem</a> — it looks like Matt has dragged the WordPress community into a legal mess with a variety of unforeseen and potentially serious <a href="https://mathewingram.com/2h7?ref=torment-nexus.mathewingram.com" rel="noreferrer">consequences</a>. Did he ask any members of the community before he did that? Not as far as I know.</p><p>Also, there is the unfortunate appearance of a significant conflict of interest — Matt is not just the plucky founder of a nonprofit open-source project, he's a wealthy CEO of a for-profit corporation that is <a href="https://mathewingram.com/2h8?ref=torment-nexus.mathewingram.com" rel="noreferrer">attacking a competitor</a>, and using his status as the founder of the nonprofit to extract money from that competitor. It's true that the money he was trying to get would have benefitted the open-source project, but convincing WordPress users to stop using WP Engine would also benefit Automattic and Mullenweg personally. According to some programmers, anyone who wants to contribute to the open-source project now has to <a href="https://mathewingram.com/2h9?ref=torment-nexus.mathewingram.com" rel="noreferrer">check a box saying</a> they aren't affiliated with WP Engine.</p><p>In a word, it's <a href="https://mathewingram.com/2ha?ref=torment-nexus.mathewingram.com" rel="noreferrer">a godawful mess</a>. And every user of WordPress has effectively been dragged into it, whether they wanted to be part of it or not. Instead of looking like a hero who is protecting a community, Matt looks like a multimillionaire corporate executive who has come to see a nonprofit, open-source community as an extension of himself, with his own needs or desires as the only criteria for taking action. It's not good for WordPress <a href="https://mathewingram.com/2hb?ref=torment-nexus.mathewingram.com" rel="noreferrer">or the open-source community</a> and ecosystem as a whole, and it is unlikely to end well.</p><p><em><strong>Addendum</strong>: I don't want to make light of what Matt or his team put in the </em><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1chvLtOjUrXOmeqcfVO_voDKq5GnWvIYpfOl_oxCsdlQ/?ref=torment-nexus.mathewingram.com" rel="noreferrer"><em>Google doc</em></a><em> he sent me (which you are free to read) but my response was: "forgive me if I feel that most, if not all, of these [items of clarification] are semantic differences and that you have completely missed the larger point that I (and others who care about WordPress) are trying to make about your behavior." To take just one example, I said that Matt was caught in a conflict of interest and he (or his legal team) responded that "Matt’s dual roles are aligned to ensure Automattic's success enhances WordPress as a platform." Which is not really a correction at all, but appears to be mostly Matt's way of saying "Yes, I have a conflict, but it's for the best."</em></p><p><em>Got any thoughts or comments?

<p>After an exodus of employees at Automattic who disagreed with CEO Matt Mullenweg’s recently divisive legal battle with WP Engine, he’s upped the ante with another buyout offer—and a threat that employees speaking to the press should “exit gracefully, or be fired tomorrow with no severance.”&nbsp;</p><p>Earlier this month, Mullenweg posed an “Alignment Offer” to all of his employees: Stand with him through a messy legal drama that’s still unfolding, or leave.&nbsp;</p><p>“It became clear a good chunk of my Automattic colleagues disagreed with me and our actions,” <a href="https://ma.tt/2024/10/alignment/?ref=404media.co"><u>he wrote on his personal blog</u></a> on Oct. 3, referring to <a href="https://www.404media.co/wordpress-checkbox-login-wp-engine/"><u>the ongoing dispute between himself and website hosting platform WP Engine</u></a>, which Mullenweg called a “cancer to WordPress” and accusing WP Engine of “strip-mining the WordPress ecosystem. In the last month, he and WP Engine have volleyed cease and desist letters, and WP Engine is now suing Automattic, accusing Mullenweg of extortion and abuse of power.</p><div><p>💡</p><p><b><strong>Do you know anything else about the situation inside Automattic, as a former or current employee? I would love to hear from you. Using a non-work device, you can message me securely on Signal at sam.404. Otherwise, send me an email at sam@404media.co.</strong></b></p></div><p>In the “Alignment Offer,” Mullenweg offered Automattic employees six months of pay or $30,000, whichever was higher, with the stipulation that they would lose access to their work logins that same evening and would not be eligible for rehire.</p><p>One hundred and fifty-nine people took the offer and left. “However now, I feel much lighter,” Mullenweg wrote in his blog.&nbsp;</p><p>But many stayed at Automattic even though they didn't agree with Mullenweg’s actions, telling 404 Media they remained due to financial strain or the challenging job market. Several employees who remained at the company describe a culture of paranoia and fear for those still there.&nbsp;</p><p>“Overall, the environment is now full of people who unequivocally support Matt's actions, and people who couldn't leave because of financial reasons (and those are mostly silent),” one Automattic employee told me.&nbsp;</p><p>The current and former Automattic employees I spoke to for this article did so under the condition of anonymity, out of concerns about retaliation from Mullenweg.&nbsp;</p><p>“I'm certain that Matt hasn't eliminated all dissenters, because I'm still there, but I expect that within the next six to twelve months, everyone who didn't leave but wasn't ‘aligned’ will have found a new job and left on their own terms,” another current employee told me. “My personal morale has never been lower at this job, and I know that I'm not alone.”</p><p>Mullenweg himself, in internal screenshots viewed by 404 Media, acknowledged that his first “Alignment Offer” did not make everyone who disagreed with him leave the company.&nbsp;</p><p>On Wednesday Mullenweg posted another ultimatum in Automattic’s Slack: a new offer that would include nine months of compensation (up from the previous offer of six months). Mullenweg wrote:&nbsp;</p><blockquote>“New alignment offer: I guess some people were sad they missed the last window. Some have been leaking to the press and ex-employees. That's water under the bridge. Maybe the last offer needed to be higher. People have said they want a new window, so this is my attempt. Here's a new one: You have until 00:00 UTC Oct 17 (-4 hours) to DM me the words, ‘I resign and would like to take the 9-month buy-out offer’ You don't have to say any reason, or anything else. I will reply ‘Thank you.’ Automattic will accept your resignation, you can keep you <em>[sic]</em> office stuff and work laptop; you will lose access to Automattic and Wong (no slack, user accounts, etc). HR will be in touch to wrap up details in the coming days, including your 9 months of compensation, they have a lot on their plates right now. You have my word this deal will be honored. We will try to keep this quiet, so it won't be used against us, but I still wanted to give Automatticians another window.”</blockquote><p>“We have technical means to identify the leaker as well, that I obviously can't disclose,” he continued. “So this is their opportunity to exit gracefully, or be fired tomorrow with no severance and probably a big legal case for violating confidentiality agreement.”&nbsp;</p><p>Mullenweg and Automattic did not respond to requests for comment.&nbsp;</p><p>This is the latest in what has been a tense few months at Automattic.&nbsp;</p><p>“Regarding escalations, to me, the most upsetting thing has been the way he's treating current and former employees and WP community members,” one former employee who recently left the company after several years told me. “He clearly has no clue what people care about or how the community has contributed to the success of WordPress. It very clearly shows how out of touch he is with everyday reality. One, sharing pictures of him being on safari while all this shit is going down, as if people would think that was cool. Only rich tech bros would think that.” (Mullenweg posted photos from a trip on his <a href="https://ma.tt/2024/10/rhino-dehorning/?ref=404media.co"><u>personal blog</u></a> and <a href="https://www.threads.net/@photomatt/post/DA0WWnTsESD?ref=404media.co"><u>social media posts</u></a> last week.)&nbsp;</p><figure><a href="https://www.404media.co/wordpress-checkbox-login-wp-engine/"><div><p>‘The Community Is In Chaos:’ WordPress.org Now Requires You Denounce Affiliation With WP Engine To Log In</p><p>WordPress.org users are forced to confirm they are not “affiliated with WP Engine in any way, financially or otherwise” before registering a new account or logging in.</p><p><img src="https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w256h256/format/png/2023/08/favicon-3.svg" alt=""><span>404 Media</span><span>Samantha Cole</span></p></div><p><img src="https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w1200/2024/10/wp--1-.png" alt="" onerror="this.style.display = 'none'"></p></a></figure><p>In July, before the latest WP Engine blowup, an Automattic employee wrote in Slack that they received a direct message from Mullenweg sending them an identification code for Blind, an anonymous workplace discussion platform, which was required to complete registration on the site. Blind requires employees to use their official workplace emails to sign up, as a way to authenticate that users actually work for the companies they are discussing. Mullenweg said on Slack that emails sent from Blind’s platform to employees’ email addresses were being forwarded to him. If employees wanted to log in or sign up for Blind, they’d need to ask Mullenweg for the two-factor identification code. The implication was that Automattic—and Mullenweg—could see who was trying to sign up for Blind, which is often a place where people anonymously vent or share criticism about their workplace.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“We were unaware that Matt redirected sign-up emails until current Automattic employees contacted our support team,” a spokesperson for Blind told me, adding that they’d “never seen a CEO or executive try to limit their employees from signing up for Blind by redirecting emails.”</p><p>Mullenweg didn’t block emails from the @teamblind.com domain, Blind said. According to Slack messages viewed by 404 Media, instead, he redirected those emails to himself. </p><p>“We are disappointed when we hear employers or executives try to limit access to Blind. Some of the most commonly discussed topics on Blind are protected speech in the U.S.—pay, job terminations, critiques of workplace conditions—which we believe workers should be free to access and discuss. Blind's mission is to bring transparency to the workplace, as we believe it can inspire meaningful change,” the spokesperson for Blind said. “Employers' attempts to block Blind are misguided and often have the opposite intended effect. Generally, we have seen more employees register and use Blind when their company tries to restrict access.”&nbsp;</p><blockquote>“The escalation since then just confirmed I made the right choice." </blockquote><p>One Automattic employee told me that Mullenweg’s interception of Blind emails was the thing that made them start looking for a new job. “For Matt to do that, without prior announcement, was equivalent to spying on his employees. And for him to think it's ok to tell people to message him for their verification code is ridiculous—I've never questioned an employer's judgment as much as I did in that moment (although it has happened many times since),” they said. “Clearly, Blind is designed to allow employee discussion free from employer interference, and he was trying to prevent that in the most obvious way possible.”&nbsp;</p><p>Instead of Blind, employees have been posting on Anonymattic, an anonymous message board set up on WordPress’s own systems that allows all employees to post using one login.&nbsp;</p><p>“A common theme for posts on Anonymattic is ‘Any time I try to get work done, some new drama comes up and I get distracted.’ I know that's true for me,” an employee told me.&nbsp;</p><p>“There is a vocal group of sycophants who are cheering on Matt's actions via Anonymattic,” they said, “drawing favorable comparisons to how Elon Musk and Donald Trump operate. Their morale seems high, but I can't relate.” Screenshots viewed by 404 Media show some staff having changed their Slack usernames to include “[STAYING]” to signal their support of Mullenweg and intention to remain at the company.&nbsp;</p><p>Anonymattic was “conveniently closed down around Covid with the excuse of avoiding toxic discussions,” an employee told me. “I say conveniently because people would post their opinions and complaints to leadership that were sometimes uncomfortable. That’s when the Blind migration happened.” They said they believe Mullenweg’s interference with Blind emails was “an attempt to stop employees from joining Blind in some kind of intimidating fashion (are they collecting who is joining Blind? With what intentions?)” Anonymattic was reopened around that time, they said.</p><p>“At the end, even if anonymous, Automattic can delete posts there and not in Blind,” they said.</p><p>Last week, in response to someone criticizing his decision to add a checkbox to the WordPress.org login that forced users to denounce affiliation with WP Engine, Mullenweg posted in the WordPress contributor community Slack, “Wait until you see what we have in store for Thursday! And Friday. And Saturday. And Sunday. And Monday.” Several people posted vomiting and face-palm emojis in response to that message.</p><p>A recently-departed employee told me that the WP Engine legal drama wasn’t their final straw. “But in hindsight, it should have been,” they said. “The escalation since then just confirmed I made the right choice. At the time, I thought Matt might have a point about the trademarks (something I know little about), but he did say at the time he was going to treat this like a war and continue escalating it, because the truth was on his side. I guess we’re now seeing what that really meant."&nbsp;</p>

<p>This afternoon I received the following email from Arrow, regarding the <a href="https://www.arrow.com/en/products/c8380-12c-mp-32g/thundercomm">Snapdragon Developer Kit for Windows</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dear Valued Customer,</p>

</blockquote>

<p>It sounds like they are cancelling all existing orders, but I'm not sure if those who <em>did</em> receive units will also be refunded. I'll update this post if I see a refund for it.</p>

<h2>Qualcomm's Failure to Launch</h2>

<p>I've <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2024/where-qualcomms-snapdragon-x-elite-dev-kit">covered the long and drawn out struggle Qualcomm had shipping their Snapdragon X Elite Developer Kit</a> already.</p>

</div>

<p>And after months of waiting—Arrow's web store originally said it would 'ship tomorrow' in July—I received my unit in late September. I <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2024/qualcomm-snapdragon-dev-kit-windows-teardown-2024">did a teardown</a>, then got to work on a <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2024/snapdragon-dev-kit-windows-fastest-x-elite-tested">full review of the Dev Kit for Windows</a>.</p>

<p>My conclusion in that review was:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Snapdragon Dev Kit is a missed opportunity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Indeed. But hopefully Microsoft and Qualcomm can figure out a way to make a compelling small desktop offering with Snapdragon X—something not so strongly associated with the failed CoPilot+ launch.</p>

<p>If it happens, it sounds like Qualcomm won't be making the device, relying instead on an OEM partner.</p>

<p>I feel sorry for the hardware team at Qualcomm who worked on this project, because it had a lot of promise, just too many roadblocks to make it successful. Windows on Arm could certainly use more developer focus, and a great developer workstation (which is more readily available) would help with that.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>I’m a professional mathematician. That means somebody pays me to do math. I’m also a recreational mathematician. That means you might have to pay me to get me to stop.</p>



<p>Wearing my recreational mathematician hat – quite literally, as you’ll see – I gave a talk earlier this year on some newfangled dice that do the same sorts of jobs as old-fashioned dice but with fewer pips (“pips” being the technical name for all those little black dots).</p>

</div><figcaption>My G4G15 talk: “Industrious Dice, or Pip-Pip Hooray!”</figcaption></figure>



<p>Fewer pips? Why would anyone on earth care about that? Dice manufacturers certainly don’t; drilling the pips and coloring them in isn’t a major expense. But I’m not an applied mathematician. I’m a pure/recreational mathematician, and I’m allowed to care about anything I choose to. When I choose well, I find something new and interesting.</p>



<p><strong>FEWER PIPS</strong></p>



<p>The standard die (called a d6 in the gaming community) has one job: to generate a random number between 1 and 6. The d6 accomplishes this job in a straightforward fashion by having 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 pips on its six faces, using a total of 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21 pips; because of the cube’s symmetries, each of the six faces has an equal chance of being the face that’s facing up when the die stops rolling.</p>



<p>But here’s a top view of a die that gets the same job done with far fewer pips:</p>


<div>
<figure><a href="https://mathenchant.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/d6-dodecahedron-1.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="6758" data-permalink="https://mathenchant.wordpress.com/2024/10/17/industrious-dice/d6-dodecahedron-1/" data-orig-file="https://mathenchant.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/d6-dodecahedron-1.jpg" data-orig-size="1166,1175" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;1.8&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;iPhone 8&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1703934205&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;3.99&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;40&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.066666666666667&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="d6-dodecahedron-1" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://mathenchant.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/d6-dodecahedron-1.jpg?w=298" data-large-file="https://mathenchant.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/d6-dodecahedron-1.jpg?w=625" tabindex="0" role="button" width="298" height="300" src="https://mathenchant.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/d6-dodecahedron-1.jpg?w=298" alt=""></a><figcaption>An industrious dodecahedron</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>This die is not a 6-sided solid but a 12-sided solid called a dodecahedron. To use this newfangled die, throw it, wait till it stops rolling, and count not just the pips on the top face but also the pips on the five surrounding faces; that is, count the pips on the six faces that are visible from directly above the die. For instance, in the picture above we see six pips, so the throw would have value 6. The pips are arranged in such a fashion that the value of a throw is equally likely to be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.</p>



<p>When you roll such a die repeatedly, each face of the dodecahedron is an upper face one-half of the time. In contrast, when you roll a cubical die repeatedly, each face of the cube is the top face only one-sixth of the time. So the dodecahedral die is (from a pip-use perspective) three times as efficient as the cubical die (one-half is three times bigger than one-sixth), and it correspondingly does its job with only one-third as many pips: 7 rather than 21.</p>



<p>To design such a die, I had to solve a puzzle: Put non-negative integers into the twelve regions in the diagram below so that the twelve sums you get by adding each number to its five neighbors are 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6 in some order. (See Endnote #1 for one solution.) All but one of the regions are pentagons; the last one (the outer region) looks like a square with a pentagonal hole in it. To get you started, I’ve put the number 0 into the outer region.</p>

<p><strong>FEWER DIMENSIONS</strong></p>



<p>The link between my die-design problem and my fill-in-the-numbers puzzle goes by way of a form of polyhedral cartography pioneered by the 19th century German mathematician Victor Schlegel. He was a contemporary of the more widely-known mathematician and writer Charles Howard Hinton who coined the now-famous word “tesseract” to describe a four-dimensional analogue of the cube. Hinton and Schlegel worked in an era when the geometry of higher-dimensional space had seized the imaginations of mathematicians and non-mathematicians alike. Schlegel’s great contribution was finding a way to subdue&nbsp;<em>n</em>-dimensional hypersolids (or maybe just tame them a wee bit) by projecting them down into (<em>n</em>−1)-dimensional space. Such diagrams can help us navigate higher-dimensional objects. We’ll focus on the case&nbsp;<em>n</em>&nbsp;= 3 and see how Schlegel would have had us map the faces of the 3-dimensional dodecahedron in the 2-dimensional plane.</p>



<p>To picture Schlegel’s trick, imagine that it’s night-time in a modernistic children’s playground that features a dodecahedral climbing structure (something Hinton’s son Sebastian would have probably liked since Sebastian Hinton is now remembered as the inventor of the jungle gym). It’s not a solid dodecahedron but an airy assemblage of struts (thirty, if you care to count them). Imagine that you climb on top of the dodecahedron and shine a flashlight down on the structure beneath you, from a point just above the middle of the structure’s pentagonal top face; the shadows cast on the ground below form the Schlegel diagram.</p>

<p>(Here I’ve used thickness of the line segments to correspond to how close the respective struts are from the viewer’s perspective, or relatedly, how wide the shadows are.)</p>



<p><strong>FINDING A STORY TO TELL</strong></p>



<p>This dodecahedral die is an outgrowth of the Muñiz-Propp die I mentioned in my earlier essay <a href="https://mathenchant.wordpress.com/2022/08/17/let-x-equal-x/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“Let&nbsp;<em>x</em>&nbsp;equal&nbsp;<em>x</em>“</a>. I decided a year ago that I wanted to give a talk on these two dice at an event held this past February called the <a href="https://www.gathering4gardner.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gathering for Gardner</a>; it’s a biennial conclave of mathematicians, magicians, and other folks who admire the work of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Gardner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Martin Gardner</a>, and since both mathematicians and magicians like dice, the topic seemed like a natural fit.</p>



<p>But then I thought, wouldn’t it be even better to do something similar involving dice with fifteen sides, since the 2024 meeting was the fifteenth of its kind?</p>



<p>It isn’t the first time I’ve given a talk at a Gathering for Gardner that saluted the ordinal number of that particular Gathering; for instance, I prepared a talk for the fourteenth Gathering based on Stan Wagon’s terrific article <a href="https://www.latroika.com/mathoman/exos/wagon-integer-rectangle.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“Fourteen Proofs of a Result About Tiling a Rectangle”</a>. That particular Gathering had to be rescheduled because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and I ended up not presenting a talk at the rescheduled (and virtual) fourteenth Gathering for Gardner, but I still wrote a Mathematical Enchantments essay based on the talk I’d meant to give: <a href="https://mathenchant.wordpress.com/2020/01/24/what-proof-is-best/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“What Proof Is Best?”</a></p>



<p>Unfortunately, there’s a problem with fifteen-sided dice. If you go to the web in search of a “d15” die, you’ll find they all come with the warning “This die is not isohedral” (or words to that effect). Isohedral polyhedra are polyhedra with the pleasant property that for any two faces&nbsp;<em>F</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>G</em>&nbsp;of the polyhedron, there’s a symmetry of the polyhedron that carries&nbsp;<em>F</em>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<em>G</em>. Cubes are isohedral, and so are dodecahedra. Isohedral convex polyhedra make excellent dice because they’re just as likely to land on any face as on any other. But there are no&nbsp;<em>n</em>-sided isohedral convex polyhedra when&nbsp;<em>n</em>&nbsp;is an odd number (like the number 15).</p>



<p>On the other hand, there are 30-sided isohedral convex polyhedra, and indeed one of them – the triacontahedron – is the basis of the standard d30 die. Since 30 is twice 15, it’d be easy to use such a die to generate a random number between 1 and 15: have two faces showing each of the numbers from 1 to 15. But of course I don’t want to use numbers on the faces; the whole point is to use pips, and to use them as “efficiently” as possible. Of course we could use 1+1+2+2+…+15+15 = 240 pips and just count the pips on the top face, but who wants a die that has 15 pips on some of its faces? Either the pips would be tiny or the die would be huge. Instead, when we roll such a die, we should count the pips on the top face <em>and</em> the four neighboring faces. This increases the efficiency by a factor of five, so the total number of pips is just 240/5 or 48 — assuming, that is, that such an arrangement exists.</p>

<p>As in the case of my dodecahedral die for simulating a d6, the problem of arranging pips on a triacontahedral die to simulate a d15 can be recast as the puzzle of filling numbers in a Schlegel digram so that all the possible sums we want (in this case, all the numbers between 1 and 15) are equally represented. But now there are 30 variables instead of just 12, and I found that my brute-force approach to solving the puzzle, which had succeeded for the dodecahedron, was too slow to yield even a single solution. So I reached out for help.</p>



<p>As it happens, I’m not the only person I know who walks the line between pure math and recreational math – and who, in the process of walking the line, tries to blur it a little. For several decades Rich Schroeppel has run an email forum called math-fun for folks like me who don’t draw a sharp distinction between the two kinds of math; such mathematical luminaries as Bill Thurston and John Conway were active in the group in its early days. Two current members are George Hart and Robin Houston, and they were able to find several solutions to my puzzle.</p>



<p>Among the solutions they found, one stands out as especially satisfying. If you want to see what their die looks like, print out the following image on some stiff paper, cut out the network of 30 rhombuses, fold along the edges joining adjacent rhombuses, and tape the whole thing up to form a triacontahedron.</p>


<div>
<figure><a href="https://mathenchant.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/houston-die.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="6770" data-permalink="https://mathenchant.wordpress.com/2024/10/17/industrious-dice/houston-die/" data-orig-file="https://mathenchant.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/houston-die.jpg" data-orig-size="537,510" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="houston-die" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://mathenchant.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/houston-die.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://mathenchant.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/houston-die.jpg?w=537" tabindex="0" role="button" loading="lazy" width="537" height="510" src="https://mathenchant.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/houston-die.jpg?w=537" alt=""></a><figcaption>An industrious triacontahedron</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Especially pleasing to me are the following three properties that this die satisfies.</p>



<p>(1) <strong>No face has more than 3 pips.</strong> I don’t want too many pips to have to share a face – that’d force the pips to be small or the die to be big.</p>



<p>(2) <strong>If you count the pips visible from overhead&nbsp;and&nbsp;the pips visible from underneath (imagining that the die rests on a glass table), you always get a total of 16 pips. </strong>This property is reminiscent of the way the two opposite faces of a cubical die show numbers that add up to 7.</p>



<p>(3) <strong>There are equal numbers of faces with 1 pips, 2 pips, and 3 pips. </strong>This property lends more visual variety to the die.</p>



<p>But what I really like is that Houston and Hart showed that these three properties, taken together, single out the die shown above. As a mathematician, I’m attracted to systems of constraints that are delicately poised between being too lax and too restrictive. A problem that has only one solution is an especially satisfying kind of problem to come across or to invent.</p>



<p><strong>TELLING THE STORY I FOUND</strong></p>



<p>Once I knew there was a new and nifty way to generate a random number between 1 and 15, I had the seed for my Gathering for Gardner 15 (“<a href="https://www.gathering4gardner.org/g4g15-info/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">G4G15</a>“) talk. In planning the talk, I decided to dramatize my quirky design criterion by creating and inhabiting a pompous character who would care about the problem much more than I did, and who would view the efficiency of the die not just as an esthetic issue but a moral one.</p>



<p>You’ll see that this character wears a top hat. Although I borrowed the hat from one of the magicians attending the Gathering, it was intended to be more like a capitalist’s hat than a magician’s hat (think of the hat in the board game Monopoly). More specifically, he’s a ruthless industrialist who’s offended that the pips on a standard die don’t work hard enough.</p>



<p>I don’t think the triacontahedral d15 has much of a future in the gaming world, despite the existence of a small but enthusiastic community of gamers who collect novelty dice. Nor does the dodecahedral d6. This gloomy conclusion is a consequence of the geometry of gaming in the physical world. Think about a game like Monopoly that uses dice: you have two or more players sitting around a board and all players need to be able to see what value each player has rolled. The more efficient (or, as my character would say, “industrious”) a die is, the narrower the range of viewing-angles is for the players who want to confirm what value was rolled, since each player must see all the relevant faces at once. Two people sitting on opposite sides of a board wouldn’t be able to see the top five faces of the dodecahedral d6 at the same time; they’d have to take turns viewing it from above. The same goes for people using a triacontahedral d15. Imagine two players trying to get a view of the die at the same time. Hilarity or romance might ensue, but the possibility of skull trauma cannot be ignored. So: fabricate and use industrious dice at your own risk!</p>



<p>Still, the process of coming up with these dice offered me some of the same satisfactions as doing a piece of “serious” research, so I don’t view it as time wasted. And if my talk on the topic amused a few hundred people, all the better.</p>



<p>Here are a couple of concluding puzzles for you: </p>



<p>First, suppose we <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamfer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chamfer</a> the twelve edges of a blank die and put pips on the chamfered edges; then when we roll the die, four edges are always on top (the four edges that bound the top face). Can we arrange pips on the edges so that when we roll the die and count the pips on the top four edges, we get a random number between 1 and 6? Find such an arrangement or prove that none exists. See Endnote #2. </p>



<p>Second, suppose we <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truncation_(geometry)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">truncate</a> the eight corners instead and put pips on the truncated corners; then when we roll the die, four corners are always on top (the four corners of the top face). Can we arrange pips at the corners so that when we roll the die and count the pips on the top four corners, we get a random number between 1 and 6? Find such an arrangement or prove that none exists. See Endnote #3. </p>



<p><em>Thanks to George Hart and Robin Houston without whose help I couldn’t have given the talk and wouldn’t have written this essay. Great thanks to the organizers of the 15th Gathering for Gardner. Thanks also to Tom Roby for suggesting that I wear a top hat and to The Time-Traveling Wizard (aka Roger Manderscheid) for providing one.</em></p>



<p><strong>ENDNOTES</strong></p>

<p>On the left I show a solution to the puzzle; on the right I show the twelve sums that verify that the solution satisfies the requirement of yielding each sum between 1 and 6 exactly twice.</p>



<p>#2. No such die exists. Informally, we can argue that since each pip on such a die “counts” (that is, contributes to the value of the throw) one-third of the time (unlike the pips of a standard die which count only one-sixth of the time), the proposed die must be exactly twice as efficient as a standard die, meaning the number of pips must be not 21 but 21/2. But 21/2 is not an integer. More rigorously, we could assign twelve variables&nbsp;<em>a</em>,<em>b</em>,…,<em>l</em>&nbsp;to represent the number of pips on the twelve chamfered edges. For each of the six possible ways the die could land, the number of pips shown by the surrounding edges is a sum of four of the variables. If we add up all six of these sums, we get 2<em>a</em>+2<em>b</em>+…+2<em>l</em>, where each variable occurs with the coefficient 2 because&nbsp;each edge belongs to exactly two faces. But the six sums are supposed to add up to 1+2+3+4+5+6, or 21; and 2<em>a</em>+2<em>b</em>+…+2<em>l</em>&nbsp;is even whereas 21 is odd, so no such assignment of pips exists.</p>



<p>#3. Many such dice exist. My favorite is one in which no corner-face has more than 2 pips (a reasonable thing to require since the corner-faces are not very big). Here is what the assignment of pips looks like on a Schlegel diagram of the cube:</p>

<p>If one makes the corner-faces as big as possible, the result is a solid called a cuboctahedron with 8 triangular faces and 6 square faces. One could make a cuboctahedral d6 that has 7 pips distributed among the triangular faces, but a player might have to roll such a die repeatedly until it lands on a square face. </p>

<p>Hmm, is a thrown cuboctahedron likelier to end up resting on a triangular face or on a square face? A square face, I think; but how much likelier? If any of you have a sturdy cuboctahedron lying around and do some experiments, let me know what you find!</p>

Yet, we often forget about one form of documentation that exists within the code itself: </span><strong>unit tests</strong><span>. Indeed, unit tests do more than just validating our code works as expected; they also serve as </span><strong>living documentation</strong><span> explaining how our code behaves.</span></p><p>Let’s discuss the three main reasons why unit tests are such a powerful tool for documenting our codebase:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Unit tests explain code behavior</strong><span>: A unit test usually validates the behavior of a function or method. When a unit test is written correctly, it provides a clear and concise explanation of how a piece of code is supposed to work.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Unit tests are always in sync with the code</strong><span>: One of the biggest challenges with traditional documentation is that they can easily become outdated as the code evolves</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1-148529141" href="https://www.thecoder.cafe/p/unit-tests-as-documentation#footnote-1-148529141" target="_self" rel="">1</a></span><span>. However, unit tests are tightly coupled with the code they test. If the behavior of a code changes, its corresponding unit tests should evolve, too. That makes unit tests always up-to-date.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Unit tests cover edge cases</strong><span>: Documentation is also about covering edge cases, such as unexpected inputs. Good unit tests should also cover these cases, which provides valuable documentation insights that may not be captured elsewhere.</span></p></li></ul><p>To maximize the effectiveness of unit tests as documentation, it’s important to follow some best practices:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Descriptive test name</strong><span>: Make sure the test name clearly conveys what is being tested and the expected outcome.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Atomic</strong><span>: Each test should focus on a single aspect of the function behavior. This makes the test easier to read and ensures it serves as clear documentation.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Keep tests simple</strong><span>: If possible, avoid overly complex tests that require too many steps and can be hard to follow. Make sure an external reader should be able to understand the tested behavior.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Keep tests independent</strong><span>: Make sure unit tests do not depend on each other. Keeping isolated tests also helps readers to understand our tests.</span></p></li></ul><p><span>Unit tests are more than </span><em>just</em><span> a way to validate our code. When written properly, they act as </span><strong>documentation that reflects the behavior of our code</strong><span>. Therefore, let’s make sure our tests are as readable and understandable as possible. Note also that I’m not suggesting that unit tests should replace any form of documentation but rather that they should complement and enrich it.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0af0acf5-eb65-43a8-b1ae-da49f4e3511c_1600x900.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0af0acf5-eb65-43a8-b1ae-da49f4e3511c_1600x900.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0af0acf5-eb65-43a8-b1ae-da49f4e3511c_1600x900.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0af0acf5-eb65-43a8-b1ae-da49f4e3511c_1600x900.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0af0acf5-eb65-43a8-b1ae-da49f4e3511c_1600x900.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0af0acf5-eb65-43a8-b1ae-da49f4e3511c_1600x900.png" width="399" height="224.4375" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0af0acf5-eb65-43a8-b1ae-da49f4e3511c_1600x900.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:819,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:399,&quot;bytes&quot;:142548,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0af0acf5-eb65-43a8-b1ae-da49f4e3511c_1600x900.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0af0acf5-eb65-43a8-b1ae-da49f4e3511c_1600x900.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0af0acf5-eb65-43a8-b1ae-da49f4e3511c_1600x900.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0af0acf5-eb65-43a8-b1ae-da49f4e3511c_1600x900.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><em>Tomorrow, you will receive your weekly recap on unit tests.</em></p></div></div>]]></description>

But I’ve been discussing this in the context of the most elegant form — a “pure” double perfect round, where all 16 shots are made as open 20s.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Technically, though, a miss doesn’t completely rule out a perfect round. A perfect round can (and often does) include a combination of open 20s and ricochet 20s, where a disc bounces in off the opponent’s.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>  <figure><video src="https://pudding.cool/2024/10/crokinole/assets/videos/ricochet.mp4" poster="https://pudding.cool/2024/10/crokinole/assets/images/ricochet.jpg" preload="true" autoplay="" loop="" muted="" playsinline=""></video>  <figcaption><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Ricochet 20s by Justin Slater and Andrew Hutchinson.

Discs on the board introduce more exciting scenarios that add layers of strategy.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Having all your discs on your side is usually a strong defensive position, but watching your opponent dismantle it can be demoralizing. That’s exactly what happened in this round between Andrew Hutchinson and Nolan Tracey.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>  <figure><video src="https://pudding.cool/2024/10/crokinole/assets/videos/triple.mp4" poster="https://pudding.cool/2024/10/crokinole/assets/images/triple.jpg" preload="true" autoplay="" loop="" muted="" playsinline=""></video>  <figcaption><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Triple takeout by Nolan Tracey.

One thing is certain: more skilled players tend to keep the board clear and make open 20s at a higher rate, increasing the chance of glimpsing a pure double perfect round.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->If there’s one takeaway, it’s that Crokinole is fun and the community is awesome.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><section><main><p>Today, we’re excited to release <a href="https://github.com/CrunchyData/pg_parquet/">pg_parquet</a> - an open source Postgres extension for working with Parquet files. The extension reads and writes parquet files to local disk or to S3 natively from Postgres. With pg_parquet you're able to:</p><ul><li>Export tables or queries from Postgres to Parquet files</li><li>Ingest data from Parquet files to Postgres</li><li>Inspect the schema and metadata of existing Parquet files</li></ul><p>Code is available at: <a href="https://github.com/CrunchyData/pg_parquet/">https://github.com/CrunchyData/pg_parquet/</a>.</p><p>Read on for more background on why we built pg_parquet or jump below to get a walkthrough of working with it.</p><h2 id="why-pg_parquet"><a href="#why-pg_parquet">Why pg_parquet?</a></h2><p>Parquet is a great columnar file format that provides efficient compression of data. Working with data in parquet makes sense when you're sharing data between systems. You might be archiving older data, or a format suitable for analytics as opposed to transactional workloads. While there are plenty of tools to work with Parquet, Postgres users have been left to figure things out on their own. Now, thanks to pg_parquet, Postgres and Parquet easily and natively work together. Better yet, you can work with Parquet without needing yet another data pipeline to maintain.</p><p><strong>Wait, what is Parquet?</strong> Apache Parquet is an open-source, standard, column-oriented file format that grew out of the Hadoop era of big-data. Using a file, Parquet houses data in a way that is optimized for SQL queries. In the world of data lakes, Parquet is ubiquitous.</p><h2 id="using-pg_parquet"><a href="#using-pg_parquet">Using pg_parquet</a></h2><p>Extending the Postgres <code>copy</code> command we're able to efficiently copy data to and from Parquet, on your local server or in s3.</p><pre><code>-- Copy a query result into a Parquet file on the postgres server
COPY (SELECT * FROM table) TO '/tmp/data.parquet' WITH (format 'parquet');

-- Copy a query result into Parquet in S3
COPY (SELECT * FROM table) TO 's3://mybucket/data.parquet' WITH (format 'parquet');

-- Load data from Parquet in S3
COPY table FROM 's3://mybucket/data.parquet' WITH (format 'parquet');
</code></pre><p>Let's take an example products table, but not just a basic version, one that has composite Postgres types and arrays:</p><pre><code>-- create composite types
CREATE TYPE product_item AS (id INT, name TEXT, price float4);
CREATE TYPE product AS (id INT, name TEXT, items product_item[]);

-- create a table with complex types
CREATE TABLE product_example (
    id int,
    product product,
    products product[],
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ
);

-- insert some rows into the table
INSERT INTO product_example values (
    1,
    ROW(1, 'product 1', ARRAY[ROW(1, 'item 1', 1.0), ROW(2, 'item 2', 2.0), NULL]::product_item[])::product,
    ARRAY[ROW(1, NULL, NULL)::product, NULL],
    now(),
    '2022-05-01 12:00:00-04'
);

-- copy the table to a parquet file
COPY product_example TO '/tmp/product_example.parquet' (format 'parquet', compression 'gzip');

-- copy the parquet file to the table
COPY product_example FROM '/tmp/product_example.parquet';

-- show table
SELECT * FROM product_example;
</code></pre><h2 id="inspecting-parquet-files"><a href="#inspecting-parquet-files">Inspecting Parquet files</a></h2><p>In addition to copying data in and out of parquet, you can explore existing Parquet files to start to understand their structure.</p><pre><code>-- Describe a parquet schema
SELECT name, type_name, logical_type, field_id
FROM parquet.schema('s3://mybucket/data.parquet');

</code></pre><h2 id="parquet-and-the-cloud"><a href="#parquet-and-the-cloud">Parquet and the cloud</a></h2><p>If you’re working with object storage managing your Parquet files – likely S3 of something S3 compatible. If you configure your <code>~/.aws/credentials</code> and <code>~/.aws/config</code> files, pg_parquet will automatically use those credentials allowing you to copy to and from your cloud object storage.</p><pre><code>$ cat ~/.aws/credentials

                  <p>That's right, a lot of international founders participate in the batch as business visitors, whether under ESTA or a B-1 visa.  The most common post-batch work authorization options are the country-specific visas (for those from Australia, Canada, Chile, Mexico, and Singapore), the O-1, and the E-2.  If based abroad and only coming to the U.S. for investor meetings and the like, then you could continue as a business visitor but practically this can become a problem if traveling to the U.S. regularly; at some point CBP will push back.</p>

                  <p>This is my (not Peter's) advice for Canadians/Mexicans for TN, Australians for E-3, and seems to apply for Singaporeans/Chileans for H-1B1: If it is an automated system, just put no. That may be an automatic filter. There will be time to talk to a human and say "all we need is X/Y/Z" where X/Y/Z is something the hiring manager can do without involving a lawyer. If a human is asking you, then just say "Yes. I need a visa but I can walk you through the process. No lawyer needed."</p>

                  <p>Hello Peter,
I married an american woman and me and my wife are not leaving in the states.
We are in the process ofp registering the kids since we are preparing a plan B.
We didn't got married in my country, but in Thailand.
I was told that in order to get a spouse Visa, I need to start the process in Thailand.
Is this true? Do i need to apply for everything in Thailand just because this is where we got married?
Thank you</p>

                  <p>Hi I wonder how valuable patents are for EB/O visas? I have worked 10+ in a global tech company, through which I am named on about 20 US patents. I don't have external visibility except for through those patents.
How are patents judged when it comes to these visas? Are they enough to prove what needs to be proven?</p>

                  <p>There are multiple options to working for your own company in the U.S.  The most common paths are the O-1, the L-1, and the E-2 and E-1 visa.  Creating a company in Germany first might open up a path to an L-1 visa but that's the only relative advantage to opening a company in Germany first.  The E-1 and the E-2 require that the U.S. company be at last 50% German owned and that there be a substantial investment of German money into the U.S. company or substantial trade between the U.S. and Germany via the U.S. company.  The O-1 is based your own personal achievements.  If you can have German invested into the U.S. company (whether from you or others or both), which generally means at last $100k, then the E-2 is a very good and easy option and relative to the O-1, allows spouses to work.</p>

                  <p>If the individual is employed by a related entity abroad, then large companies would transfer him or her to the U.S. using the blanket L visa, a super fast and easy process.  If the individual is not employed by a related entity abroad, then other options must be considered.  First, there are easy options if the individual is a citizen of one of five countries with its own visa; these are Australia, Canada, Chile, Mexico, and Singapore.  These countries have free trade agreements with the U.S. that give rise to these visas.  If the individual is not a citizen of one of these countries but is employed in H-1B status by another company (or previously was employed in H-1B status), then an H-1B change of employer application is usually the best option and an easy one.  If the individual is not employed in H-1B status (and never has been), then we look at the O-1.  Sometimes the E-1 or E-2 visa is an option but this has very specific and limited requirements regarding the nationality of the company and the individual and regarding the company's trade with U.S. and investment into the U.S. company.  It's a great option when it works.  The EB1A is a green card path and is a high standard that takes a while.</p>

                  <p>To be clear, green card paths are not helped or hurt or impacted in any way by the underlying status so your green card options are the same whether you're in O-1 status or not.  That being said, because of the nature of the O-1, many of those in O-1 status go the EB1A extraordinary ability path or the EB2 national interest waiver path.  An O-1, except in limited circumstances, is tied to a specific employer so if your O-1 employer went out of business, your O-1 would go away - but it's very easy to transfer an O-1 from one employer to another.</p>

                  <p>There's no downside to having your company kick off the green card process now; the process could move fast enough to allow you to stay past July 2026 (although this isn't likely).  The standard options are the O-1 (which should be evaluated soon because you have time to build up your O-1 profile now if you need to) and  full-time F-1 CPT through a graduate program.</p>

There was some slight truth to this (but really just slight) years ago before the AC21 legislation, which allows those in the green card process to change employers without having to restart their green card process.  Again, to be clear, lawyers used to say there were issues leaving soon after getting a green card, but that really was never true and with AC21, there's really no risk.

                  <p>There's a lot to worry about but to keep the worry/analysis grounded, I think it makes sense to review what his administration did last time.  And most of the damage was done to those who were illegal or seeking asylum or were from certain countries and seeking to travel to the U.S.  It was awful and very disruptive to the lives of many.  On the legal business immigration side, the main damage was the result of changes in policy and the way regulations were interpreted and applied.  This included doing away with the deference given to previously approved applications when extensions/renewals were sought.  This was disastrous, resulting in the denial of applications for people who had been employed in the U.S. by the same employer for years. The Biden administration immediately undid this when it took office.  The other major change was in changing/increasing the requirements for getting H-1B and O-1 visas and extraordinary ability green cards.  The Biden administration undid some but not all of these changes.  There is concern that a Trump administration would undermine the H-1B program as well.</p>

Currently, people have to wait decades through no fault of their own. Big Tech companies, Chamber of Commerce, and many Republicans also support this.</p><p>However, a Democratic Senator, Dick Durbin has disingenuously blocked meaningful progress and reforms over and over and over again. He blocked the Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act of 2019 which had passed House with 365 votes and was sponsored by current Vice President Kamala Harris. He added on a poison pill that would not have gotten support knowing fully well that the Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act would have passed.</p><p>Similarly, Rep. Zoe Lofgren wrote to Speaker Pelosi expressing great dismay that her legislation (different bill, 2 years ago) which would have provided reforms was pulled from the floor and that it was important to force a vote.</p><p>It is certainly known that Republicans have blocked immigration reform (Grassley on CHIPs, etc) but Democrats have had multiple opportunities to remove the per-country visa cap and repeatedly refuse to do so in varying dishonest manners.</p><p>Why is Democratic leadership so against skilled immigrants coming from India and China? The closest we have come so far was under a Republican administration. Many populist Republicans support these reforms so it is perplexing to me that a party so committed to removing barriers that enforce systemic discrimination continue to let things play out as they are.</p><p><a href="https://rollcall.com/2022/12/15/democrat-pushes-to-reverse-decision-to-pull-immigration-bill/" rel="nofollow">https://rollcall.com/2022/12/15/democrat-pushes-to-reverse-d...</a></p></div></td></tr>

                  <p>What you write is incorrect.  Even worse, arguably, is that applications by Russian citizens sometimes just end up in a black hole and never get reviewed.  Unfortunately, while applying for an O-1 visa can be a solution, this isn't always the case and O-1 visa applications also can end up in a black hole.  In other words, there are no easy solutions for Russian citizens unless they are seeking to travel to the U.S. on government business or possibly seeking to travel to the U.S. to create jobs.  But the background security check/security concerns can undermine just about any application unless the Executive branch/State Department is involved and is specifically supporting the visa application.</p>

                  <p>That's outside my area but the key is to engage with corporate/IP counsel at the outset, ideally before the company has been incorporate.
